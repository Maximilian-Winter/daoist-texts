# Daoist Texts Collection - English Translations

## About This Collection
This repository contains over 850 Daoist texts translated into English, including:
- 254 texts from the Daozang (道藏 - Daoist Canon)
- ~600 additional Daoist texts
- Complete works including the Eight Immortals Attain the Dao (八仙得道傳) in 100 chapters

## Translation Methodology
These texts were translated using AI-assisted translation technology, carefully styled to match the classical translation approach of James Legge (1815-1897), the renowned Scottish sinologist known for his translations of Chinese classics. Legge's formal Victorian prose style, with its scholarly precision and slight archaism, was chosen to convey the dignity and philosophical depth of these religious texts while maintaining readability for modern audiences.

The AI translation process aimed to preserve:
- The formal register appropriate for religious and philosophical texts
- Consistent terminology across related texts
- The balance between literal accuracy and readable English prose that characterized Legge's work
