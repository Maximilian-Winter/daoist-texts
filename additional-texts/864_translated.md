# The Text of Observing and Upholding the Eight Precepts during Fasting

Master Lu of the Song Dynasty, cultivating Stillness, respectfully presented:

The Primordial Heavenly Worthy, the Limitless Great Way, responsive and efficacious in spiritual sanctity, all the divine and bright spirits. Now there are good men and good women who desire to observe and uphold the Eight Precepts and keep a pure fast for one day and one night, employing this to examine and govern body and mind, to extinguish the sins and vexations of the three karmas. Therefore the Twelfth chapter of the Scripture of Penetrating the Spirits says: ‘Fasting is urgently for the purpose of harmonizing and perfecting body and mind.’ When body and mind are harmonious and perfect, disorder and ruin are guarded against. The arising causes are many, but in general there are eight:

1. Not to take life to maintain oneself.

2. Not to indulge in carnal desire for pleasure.

3. Not to steal the possessions of others to supply oneself.

4. Not to speak falsehoods to display one’s abilities.

5. Not to be intoxicated with wine to gratify oneself.

6. Not to lie promiscuously upon high and broad beds.

7. Not to use fragrant oils in general as adornment.

8. Not to engage in singing and dancing as a performer.

Today, if good men and good women can avoid transgressing these eight matters, then the eight disorders have no occasion to arise, and thus the eight achievements will naturally be established. If established long and not lost, life is prolonged and preserved, and spiritual powers become penetrating and clear. Therefore fasting is to observe the Eight Precepts, to contemplate the truth and practise the Way, unimpeded and without end, with manifest efficacy and speedy accomplishment, all as expected. Now, having completed the acceptance, again prostrate and rise, respectfully take the precepts and withdraw.
