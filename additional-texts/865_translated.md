# The Scripture of One Hundred and Eighty Precepts Spoken by the Most High Lord Lao

In the latter days of the Zhou, in the time of King Nan, the Way of Great Peace and the Teaching of Great Purity first appeared. The Lord Lao came to Langya, and bestowed the Way upon Lord Gan. Lord Gan received the method of the Way, and thereby attained it; he was honored with the title of Perfected Man. He also transmitted the Scripture of Great Peace in one hundred and seventy scrolls, and the Ten Sections of the Jiazi. Afterwards, Lord Bo, grievously ill, took the Way from Lord Gan for the protection of his sickness; his malady was removed and cured, and he also thereby attained the Way, and was honored as a Perfected Man. Even now in Langya there is a magnolia tree, the place where the two lords Gan and Bo dwelt.

In the time of King You, Lord Lao taught Hu Huan; when about to enter Hanzhong, he passed Langya, where Lord Gan had the good fortune to see Lord Lao.

Lord Lao said to Lord Gan: “I before bestowed upon thee assistance for saving lives, caring anxiously for the myriad people, and appointed men and women as sacrificial ministers, broadly transforming the ignorant, distributing disciples, so that above they might move the heart of Heaven, below they might stir the spirits of Earth, and bring joy to the hearts of kings. But of late I have observed from my distant vantage, ten thousand myriad li away, that these men and women sacrificial ministers, relying on the honored position of the Lord Lao, are covetous of wealth and lustful, self-willed and self-serving, mutually reproving each other. Each claims that his heart is upright, while saying the others are not true, that it is profitable to be supported, and desires men to serve himself. They hate those who walk the same Way, envy the virtuous and resent the talented, are arrogant and unruly, and oppress the people. They say that hereafter they will follow me, and that my Way is most correct, and that the others are not true. All these things are ill-founded; therefore I have come to speak with thee.”

Gan Ji bent the head and kowtowed again and again, prostrating himself on the ground a hundred times, and said humbly: “Most High, from this day forth whither shall I go? The great crimes of these men and women sacrificial ministers cause their ranks to be empty; they, having received the protection of the Way, may attain ascension, and at the end of life escape the suffering of the nine underworld prisons. Not only the ministers, but also the myriad people. The people know not, and the faults of the ministers and the errors of the servant are truly in myself. I beseech the Most High to pardon the past errors, and appoint me to cultivate future good. I, Gan Ji, am guilty of a capital crime, a capital crime.”

Lord Lao said: “Be at ease and composed; sit. I fear that in the decline of the Great Way the myriad people will lose their lives. If one or two ministers die and enter the nine abyssal regions below, it is not a great grief. I only lament the suffering of the myriad people. Thou must listen well, and record in thy heart, so that thou mayest make the precepts for later generations, commanding all men and women sacrificial ministers to reform their former conduct, and follow the good from this time forth.”

Lord Lao said: “Though men live up to ten thousand years, if they do not hold fast to the precepts and rules, what are they but like old trees and decayed stones? Better one day holding the precepts to be men of virtue, and then dying to aid the heavenly officers, their bodies dissolving and ascending as immortals. The common people die burdened with grievous crimes, to no benefit of their spirits; their spirits only suffer punishment. The ministers must clearly observe and practice this.”

Then he said: “Hear all ye ministers, and understand. Among the myriad people under heaven there is none who abides long. Men are born and die; things come to be and pass away. The sun rises and sets; the moon waxes and wanes. From ancient times until now, who can endure? Only virtue and morality endure! Now the moon is also good, today is also good, this time is also good, the sages are also good, Master Jia is also good, disciples are also good, all the myriad spirits are complete, the officials and soldiers all present. Now I, for the sake of the sages, thinking upon the lives of the myriad people, bestow upon Wang Jia prohibitions, precepts, and heavy rules, which are to be read thrice over.”
