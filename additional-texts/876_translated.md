# The Marvelous Responses to Reading and Reciting the Scripture of Purity and Tranquillity (Collected Accounts)

## I. The Purity and Tranquillity of Virtue — Untouched by Raging Fire

In the first year of the Qingyuan reign, there was a man named Sun Shou, who dwelt within the thickets by the sea, subsisting by hunting. One day, suddenly a fire arose in the thicket; the smoke and flames spread across the sky, and the trees were all consumed by the blaze. Yet a small grove remained untouched by the fire, flourishing abundantly.

Sun Shou felt astonished and drew near to inquire into the cause. Approaching, he found within the thicket a secluded altar; he pushed open the door and saw an old man, about seventy years of age, sitting upright before a table, reading aloud a scroll of scripture.

Sun Shou advanced, saluted, and inquired, “Old sir, what are you reading?” The old man, surprised, asked, “Who is it that comes to me?” Sun Shou answered, “I am a hunter by the sea; a great fire just now swept the thicket, yet your dwelling and surrounding grove remain unscathed and safe; I came to see the reason.” The old man said, “I have dwelt here for over four hundred years, and have never met with flood or fire.” Sun Shou further asked, “What scripture do you recite?” The old man replied, “It is the Scripture of Constant Purity and Tranquillity, spoken by the Supreme Elder Lord.” Sun Shou asked, “What is this Scripture of Purity and Tranquillity?” The old man said, “Please sit; I will explain it to you in detail. The term ‘purity and tranquillity’ refers to virtue. Thus my body is pure and tranquil, because I hold fast to the practice of simplicity.”

“That which is pure and gentle is the preservation of the Way; that which is clear and adapts endlessly is the transformation of the Way; purity and tranquillity, as broad as the great sea, is the virtue of the Way. I can maintain this purity and commune with the great Dao, transforming without end; what fear have I of fire? Clarity and turbidity, motion and stillness, all follow the transformations of the great Dao without ceasing. If I maintain this Way of purity and tranquillity, what disaster can harm me?”

Upon hearing the old man expound the great Dao, Sun Shou at once cast away his bow and arrows, bowed to the old man, and entreated to be taught the Scripture of Purity and Tranquillity, thereby awakening to the true Way. Later, his fame spread throughout the land.

## II. The Ceasing of the Sea-Waves — Entirely Relying on Purity and Tranquillity

In the Tang dynasty, there was a man named Bai Yun Zhe, a Grand Marshal of Zhu Yang County. Once, he was ordered to transport grain to Liaodong by ship. On the way, great winds and waves arose, the surging billows darkened the view, and all aboard were filled with terror. Suddenly a divine voice was heard, saying, “Lord Zhe frequently recites the Scripture of Constant Purity and Tranquillity spoken by the Supreme Elder Lord. Now, at this perilous moment, why do you not hasten to recite it?”

Hearing this, Ren Zhe quickly recited the scripture thirty times. As he recited, streams of golden light continuously burst forth from his mouth, which all aboard saw simultaneously. Before long, the wind and waves ceased, and Ren Zhe returned safely.

Upon returning home, Ren Zhe invited Taoist priests to perform the Yellow Register observance, giving thanks for divine grace. He also had three thousand copies of the Scripture of Purity and Tranquillity carved and printed, diffusing them to all directions. Ren Zhe lived to the age of one hundred and nineteen, passing away peacefully without illness.

## III. The Soul Enters Fengdu — Salvation through Meritorious Recitation

During the reign of Emperor Gaozong in the Linde years, there was an official named Dou Dexuan. Once, on a mission to Yangzhou, while crossing the Huai River by boat, they had already moved several dozen paces from shore when a figure was seen standing by the riverbank, thin and haggard in appearance. Dou Dexuan said to the boatman, “He looks pitiful; let him board and I will ferry him across.” The boatman brought the boat close to shore, and the man boarded. Along the way, Dou Dexuan ordered food and drink to be offered to him. When the boat docked, Dou Dexuan mounted his horse to leave, but the man followed closely for several li.

Dou Dexuan was curious and asked where he was going. The man replied, “I am no living man, but the emissary of the ghost city Fengdu, now hastening to Yangzhou to seize the soul of Dou Dexuan.”

Dou Dexuan was greatly alarmed, hastily dismounted, and bowed to the ghost envoy, saying, “I am Dou Dexuan indeed!” Then, weeping, he asked how he might escape.

The envoy asked, “Do you recite any scriptures?” Dou Dexuan answered, “I have long recited the Scripture of Constant Purity and Tranquillity, spoken by the Supreme Elder Lord.” The envoy said, “No wonder. I see the Dao permeates your body; your heart is merciful and compassionate toward the poor. I thank you for the food you gave me on the boat; this grace I cannot repay, so I grant you a month's reprieve. The sins pursued by the netherworld I shall bear. You must diligently recite the Scripture of Purity and Tranquillity ten thousand times within a month; surely then will divine spirits descend to save you.”

Having spoken thus, the envoy vanished. Dou Dexuan devoted himself day and night to reciting the scripture without rest. After thirty days, the ten thousand recitations were complete. He returned home, set up an incense altar, and continued his recitations. Then the envoy appeared again, saying, “Although you have recited ten thousand times, your life has ended. For the food you gave me, the netherworld blamed me and punished me with thirty stripes.” The envoy removed his upper garment, revealing marks of punishment. Dou Dexuan lay down and soon expired; his soul followed the envoy through the northern gate. After traveling some ten li, they came upon a city overgrown with thorns. Then they saw an official hall with guards at the gate, solemn in countenance; a plaque bore the four characters ‘Fengdu Northern Headquarters’. The envoy said, “Wait here; I shall return shortly.”

Presently he returned, saying, “Because of the merit of your recitations, the Jade Emperor has sent an imperial edict. The Fengdu Great Emperor is greatly pleased.”

At this time, an official in purple robes came forth, grasped Dou Dexuan’s hand, and led him into the hall. The Fengdu Great Emperor held a cold jade tablet; before the incense altar lay a purple clay edict glowing with golden light. The Great Emperor received the edict, and the envoy led Dou Dexuan to bow in salutation. The Great Emperor said, “You are truly a man of supreme virtue! From youth you have recited the Scripture of Purity and Tranquillity and performed wide acts of kindness. Heaven has recorded your name. Today, in recognition of your merit, all the punishments for sinners in Fengdu Hell are reduced by one degree. Moreover, your lifespan is extended by twelve years. Now the envoy shall escort you back.” Dou Dexuan bowed in thanks, and the Great Emperor bowed in return.

The envoy led Dou Dexuan into a golden hall, whereupon Dou Dexuan suddenly revived, seeing kin and household weeping around him. They said, “You have been dead three days.” Reflecting on the events, Dou Dexuan believed the great Dao was true and was thus delivered from misfortune. He then became a Taoist in the Jingling Temple, practicing the Way of Purity and Tranquillity.

Twelve years later, a purple cloud descended from the heavens; Dou Dexuan saw a youth clad in green, leading two white cranes, alighting in his courtyard. The youth said, “This day is your ascent; mount the cranes’ backs!”

Dou Dexuan mounted a crane and ascended to heaven. Afterwards, his courtyard was filled with a fragrant aroma that lasted over a month. Dou Dexuan left a poem upon his ascent:

> Human affairs are many and vexing,  
> Vanity and gain are unbearable to behold.  
> Learn to understand purity and tranquillity herein,  
> When merit is full, ascend and become a heavenly official.

## IV. Reciting Scripture to Relieve Grievances — Souls Born to Heaven

Song Zhixuan of Fang Prefecture was an assistant military officer of Qing Prefecture. Once, upon arriving at a certain place, the people told him that one house was uninhabitable, haunted by ghosts who frequently wrought mischief; six or seven out of ten residents perished. Zhixuan, a follower of the Dao and upright in heart, had loved to recite the Scripture of Constant Purity and Tranquillity from youth, deeply understanding its meaning and practicing it in body and action. He did not believe in such spectres. He told the people, “I shall dwell here; what demon can harm me?”

He resolutely took up residence and wrote a poem of Master Lü for others to see, saying:

> One pill of the golden elixir ensures longevity;  
> One must possess true lead, refined with Jia and Geng.  
> Fire takes the marrow of the southern red phoenix;  
> Water seeks the essence of the northern black turtle.  
> The cauldron chases the central soil of the four seasons;  
> The medicine follows the three origins and the eight trigram courses.  
> Fasting and merit achieve the nine transformations;  
> By holding purity and tranquillity, ghosts and spirits are startled.

That night, Zhixuan sat upright, cultivating breath and energy, the room filled with red light, silently reciting the scripture. At the second watch, suddenly a woman appeared before him, hair dishevelled, face stained with blood. Zhixuan asked, “Who are you?” The woman said, “I am the ghost who came before to seek justice.”

Falling down and weeping, she said, “This is truly my blessing! Today I have met a man of the Dao who will listen to my grievances. Ten years ago I was the wife of Liu, an officer. My husband was sent abroad and did not return; his brother-in-law forced me to illicit relations, but I died rather than comply. My corpse was thrown into a privy in the northwest corner of the hall, foul and unclean. Whenever anyone dwells here, I wish to tell them my grievance and ask for justice. But they have no Dao within; most are scared to death upon seeing me. You recite the Scripture of Purity and Tranquillity, your merit is great; please show mercy and help me gain redress!”

Zhixuan said, “I have just arrived as an official, only three days in office. I will find a way to save you; go back for now.” The woman then vanished.

Three days later, Zhixuan ordered an excavation in the northwest privy but found no corpse. That night he again sat upright, burned incense, and recited the scripture. Before the second watch, the ghost appeared once more. Zhixuan asked, “I had men search as you said but could not find your body; why?” The woman said, “Dig two feet northwards and you will find my remains.”

The next day, indeed a corpse was unearthed there. Zhixuan recited scriptures in dedication, wrapped the body in clean clothes, and chose a burial site.

That night, the ghost appeared again, now clean and free from blood. By lamplight, she bowed and thanked Zhixuan.

Zhixuan asked, “Since you were murdered, why do you not seek revenge?” The woman said, “The man who killed me is the steward in Jiangzhou. From youth he recited the Scripture of Purity and Tranquillity. I have petitioned the netherworld for many years but to no avail.”

Zhixuan said, “I will tell him to hold fast to fasting and rites, write Yellow Registers and White Charters, and offer up prayers to save you to heaven; will this relieve your grievance?”

The woman bowed again, saying, “I am most grateful!” and then vanished.

Zhixuan requested leave and journeyed to Jiangzhou, meeting Liu Silu and detailing the case fully. He said, “You are a steward; how can you do such a thing? I hear you recite the Scripture of Purity and Tranquillity, showing a heart of the Way. Yet you committed this evil. Have you not heard that while the law punishes openly, spirits punish secretly? If you do not mend your ways, your retribution is eternal!”

Liu Silu was greatly alarmed, saying, “Thank you for coming so far to free me from retribution; how dare I go against your kindness!” He gave generously, inviting over a hundred Taoist priests to perform the Yellow Register Great Rite for seven days and nights. He also printed ten thousand copies of the Scripture of Purity and Tranquillity, distributing them among the faithful.

At midday that day, a woman appeared holding a fine horse with ten thousand scrolls of scripture on its back, saying, “By the merit of the scripture and rites, and by imperial command, I enter the Zhu Ling Immortal Palace to refine my primordial spirit and become an immortal of the Southern Palace. I lived long in the world; Song Zhixuan will soon also become immortal.” With these words, she ascended to heaven.

Zhixuan and Liu Silu became fellow practitioners of the Sacred True Dao. After returning home to Fang Prefecture, Zhixuan saw a green phoenix bird in his courtyard; immediately burning incense and bathing, he mounted the green phoenix and also ascended.

Zhixuan left a poem as follows:

> In the next life, enlightened by the Pure Scripture,  
> Removing sin and aiding the weak, escaping punishment.  
> Today, borne on the power of merit and virtue,  
> Refining spirit and form in the Zhu Ling Palace.

## V. Reciting Scripture and Abstaining from Food — Cultivating the Dao to Become Immortal

In the Tang dynasty, Yuan Tong of Tianshui loved the Dao from childhood, diligently reciting the Scripture of Constant Purity and Tranquillity daily, forty-nine times each day. At twenty years of age, he was conscripted by An Lushan; after defeat, Yuan Tong escaped alone, lost and starving in the mountains, exhausted and without food, he silently recited the scripture until too weak, he closed his eyes to await death.

Suddenly, a youth clad in azure appeared, bearing a bowl of rice filled with a fragrance indescribable.

Yuan Tong ate his fill; the youth said, “The perfect man nourishes his belly with pure qi; ordinary men nourish theirs with filth. The perfect man cultivates spirit and energy, keeping body and mind tranquil; the ordinary man indulges desires, thinking this pleasure. You have loved the sacred Way from youth and persevered, practicing and reciting the Scripture of Constant Purity and Tranquillity, and have attained great merit. The Supreme Elder Lord sent me to bring you a divine medicine; henceforth, you will cultivate the sacred Way using spirit and no longer need earthly food. Your name has been removed from the black death register and recorded in the Zhu Ling Longevity Palace. The Way of Purity and Tranquillity is indeed not empty!” Having spoken, he vanished.

Yuan Tong no longer ate, and obtained six supernatural powers and wisdom. He lived into the reign of Emperor Zhezong of the Song dynasty. In the time of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang, over five hundred years, his appearance remained like that of a man in his thirties. Often seen wandering by the Luo River, he recited the scripture ceaselessly. No one ever saw him eat; he was called “Sir Purity.” If anyone was ill, he touched them and healed them at once, earning the title “Touch Heals.”

One day outside Chongjing Gate, he sang loudly:

> You abide in chaos, I abide not;  
> You abide in filth, I abide not.  
> You go east and west, how can you live?  
> Attaining the Way, five hundred years,  
> Severing evil demons and delight.  
> Riding clouds and cranes’ backs,  
> To the Jade Emperor’s Heavenly Palace,  
> Forever dwelling in the Pavilion of Untroubled Ease.

Upon finishing, an immortal crane flew down; Yuan Tong mounted its back and ascended on a cloud. People looked up to see. A paper fell from the sky, upon which was written “The Way of Purity and Tranquillity is born.”

## VI. Seeking a Wife in the Netherworld — Borrowing a Corpse to Return to Life

During the Qingli years of the Song dynasty, an official named Han was stationed at Yun Prefecture. He had a daughter, twenty-six years old, married to Wang Jian, a high-ranking official. Han’s daughter, pregnant, stayed at her parents’ home. At the third watch of night, strange sounds were heard in the northwest corner of the hall. The maids slept, but Han’s daughter could not.

Suddenly a general appeared, clad in battle armor, holding a golden spear, saying, “I am General Wei of the Jin dynasty, who has dwelt here for centuries. You dare make this your birthing chamber; the blood and foul air offend me. If you do not move within three days, I will kill you; mark my words.” Han said, “I will move.” The general then vanished.

Next morning Han told her maids to inform her father. Han said, “Women are weak in inner qi and prone to illusions; how can such things be?” He refused to move her, adding maids to watch her.

At the third watch the general appeared again; the maids saw and fled in terror. The general angrily said, “I warned you; if you are not gone by tomorrow, I will kill you!” Han said, “I will move tomorrow.” The general vanished.

Next morning the maids told Han. Han said, “A woman not yet seven days postpartum cannot be moved; it is but illusions from weakness.” The maids said, “We saw it.” Han replied, “You women are superstitious.” He refused to move her.

That night the general appeared again, saying, “I warned you thrice; you refuse to leave.” Han and maids said they reported to Han but he would not move her. The general, enraged, stabbed Han in the chest; she cried out and died. Her father heard, came running with a sword, found her dead, and grieved deeply. He wrote to her husband, Wang Jian, who hurried home. Ten li west of Sizhuang Town, he saw a woman approaching and recognized her as his wife.

Wang dismounted and asked, “How are you here?” His servants also saw the deceased wife. The woman said, “I was killed by General Wei of Jin. I have come here and cannot seek justice. You, as husband, could not protect me.” She wept. Wang wished to embrace her, but she said, “Men and ghosts differ paths; do not come close. I hear there is a man named Tian in this town who has recited the Scripture of Constant Purity and Tranquillity from childhood, practicing the Way of Purity and Non-action, able to communicate with the spirits and possessing heavenly virtue. You must seek him to save me from the netherworld!”

Wang sought out Tian and told him the matter. Tian said, “Good, I will pray to Heaven and Earth to rescue your wife.” He led Wang to a quiet chamber. At the first watch, Tian donned court robes, held a jade tablet, burned incense, lit seven lamps, knelt before the lamps, and recited incantations.

Suddenly a heavenly soldier appeared, saying, “I bring the edict of the Jade Emperor; you may take this to the netherworld.” He laid down the edict and vanished. Tian said, “I now bear the Jade Emperor’s edict and will go with you to Fengdu to seize General Wei.”

Tian laid a clean mat for Wang to lie upon; Wang soon lost consciousness, and his soul departed. Tian sat in meditation, causing his spirit to leave the body, and led Wang’s soul forth. After several li, they saw a great city, dusk-darkened, with many iron-armored soldiers bearing weapons. Upon seeing Tian, they saluted.

Entering, a red-robed messenger reported urgently; many saw Tian and showed great respect, whispering, “Master Tian has come to the netherworld.” Soon a youth in green, bearing ceremonial arms, stood in order; the Fengdu Great Emperor appeared. All saluted Tian. The ghost envoy asked Wang, “Who are you, and why here?” Wang said, “I am Master Tian’s attendant.” The envoy asked no more.

In the hall, Tian and the Great Emperor faced each other; Tian presented the Jade Emperor’s edict. Wang and the many ghost attendants worshipped. Soon a youth in blue announced, “The god of games shall go to the netherworld to seize the Jin ghost General Wei.” They saw a man in golden mail armor with a sword, who took the order and left. Shortly, a ghost attendant reported, “General Wei has been captured.” The Great Emperor commanded, “Bring him to the hall.”

Many ghost soldiers escorted a man before the hall. The Great Emperor said, “You are a hundred-year ghost. In life, you killed many living beings and did not repent; now you harm the living world.” Wei said, “I warned her many times; she would not leave. In anger, I killed her. I beg the Great Emperor to pardon my crimes for my merits while alive.” The Emperor said, “You dare kill as a ghost; what merits? Three hundred blows and exile to Beiyin Mountain for a thousand years.” The ghost soldiers struck him with iron rods, his cries unbearable. After, a ghost official said, “By the edict of the Great Emperor, you are sent to Yin Mountain.”

The Emperor asked where Han’s soul was. Ghost soldiers brought it before the hall. The envoy said, “Her body is destroyed; she may borrow another body to return to life.” The magistrate examined the records, finding Han’s allotted lifespan was sixty-six years, with forty years remaining. The daughter of the Qingzhou County official Wang, named Shouniang, aged twenty-six, had died; her body was available for Han to borrow.

The Great Emperor granted permission to release them. Tian and Wang returned. Suddenly Wang awoke. Tian said, “Sir, keep this matter secret!” Wang thanked Tian and asked how he could journey the netherworld. Tian said, “I recite the Scripture of Constant Purity and Tranquillity, and by faith and practice in it, unite with Heaven and Earth. The scripture says: ‘He who is always pure and tranquil, Heaven and Earth all return to him.’ Upon your return, hasten to Qingzhou to find Wang’s household and reclaim your wife.”

Wang parted from Tian. On the way, his wife Han had already returned to life. Three days after Shouniang’s death, she revived, saying, “I am the daughter of Han the official; my father is now governor of Yun Prefecture.” Before Wang reached Wang’s house, Shouniang said, “My husband Wang has come!” Her voice was unlike the old. Wang explained the events to Wang’s household, then went with his wife to Yun, visiting her parents. Her voice was exactly as before. Both suddenly realized the truth of the great Dao, dispersed their wealth, printed over one hundred thousand copies of the Scripture of Purity and Tranquillity, circulated them, and held grand rites of the Yellow Register to thank Heaven and Earth.

Afterwards, Wang and his wife visited Tian and thanked him. Tian said, “You may both cultivate the Way.” Wang resigned his post, donned Taoist robes, and served at the Fude Temple in Chang’an; his wife became a Taoist nun at the Yujing Temple. Both lived to one hundred and twenty years, departing peacefully.

## VII. Insatiable Greed — Dispelling by Purity and Tranquillity

The Emperor Yizong of Tang had a daughter, Princess Tongchang, married to Wei Fuma. The princess found the palace uncomfortable; the emperor granted her a residence more splendid than the palace, with golden towers and jade pavilions, and gave her five million strings of treasury coins. Yet she remained unsatisfied, saying her home lacked treasures.

The emperor brought all treasures from the palace to her, refurbishing her house with golden railings, jade water basins, gemstone-inlaid golden basins, silver wire bird cages, crystal and glass beds and tables. Still she complained of no food supplies.

The emperor gave her the best rice and flour from the treasury; she next said the house lacked curtains and drapes. The emperor sent pearl curtains and a medicinal charm that warmed in winter and cooled in summer. He also gave her a nine-phoenix jeweled hairpin glowing with nine colors when worn.

When the princess traveled, she rode a vehicle of seven treasures adorned with five-colored jewels and fragrant sachets containing cold-expelling, evil-dispelling, and dust-repelling incenses, all tribute from foreign lands. The carriage was covered with multicolored jewels, gold and silver, glass, crystal, and agate, shaped into dragons and phoenixes, with pearl and gem tassels on all sides. Atop was a jade lotus with a golden pearl radiating a three-foot-high glow, strings of gold and jade hanging with heavenly music.

Each journey filled the air with fragrant breezes, lasting over half a year. Despite her wealth, the princess was dissatisfied, thinking earthly riches could not compare to the immortals’ land of Penglai, and thus fell ill. Raised in the palace, she rigorously recited the Scripture of Constant Purity and Tranquillity. She summoned the imperial physician Mi Zong to treat her; at night she gave him a two-inch incense candle to take home. The aroma was sharp and spread widely; neighbors in two or three hundred steps could smell it. The incense smoke formed shapes of ornate pavilions and flowers, each flower strange and wondrous.

The princess was gravely ill; attendants brought the scripture and precious incense called “Tongtian incense” in a jade box, burning it and reciting scripture. Before seven recitations were complete, two attendants in vermilion said, “The Eastern Mountain Great Emperor summons you to Tai Mountain Mansion.” The princess said, “I am a princess; how can you take me?” She ordered attendants to seize the emissaries, but they seemed invisible.

The attendants said, “This is the netherworld’s matter; who cares if you are the emperor’s daughter?” They carried the princess away as if out the north gate of Chang’an. After some li, the princess said her feet ached and could go no farther. An attendant led a white horse to her. They traveled over a hundred li in darkness to a great city where people moved about. The princess said, “I am hungry.” The attendant said, “Food here melts to fire and burns the viscera; do not taste it.”

They saw dozens of men and women, naked, being branded by hellish ghost officers with red-hot iron tools, their blood flowing, bodies turning to bloody mud. A wind blew; they were restored, and the torment continued. The princess closed her eyes in fear. She asked the ghost officers what crimes caused such punishment. They said, “These people indulged excessively in luxury and never knew contentment.” The princess asked, “And what of me?” They said, “You are like them.”

Soon a horned ghost officer came with an iron hammer, ordering the princess to strip. She protested being a princess, but he said, “This place knows no rank; strip quickly.” Reluctantly, she removed her royal garments, reciting the Scripture of Constant Purity and Tranquillity. The officer grew impatient, tearing her clothes; her body burned as if in hot oil. She fervently recited to the point of “three poisons extinguished” and saw a golden light; the officers worshipped the sky. Then appeared the Supreme Ultimate Master Ge Xianweng.

The Immortal said, “In the Palace of Supreme Purity, I heard someone reciting the Scripture of Constant Purity and Tranquillity in the netherworld. From the first scroll’s recitation, the sages of the Three Purities knew; the Supreme Elder Lord sent me to descend to hell to pardon sinners who recite.”

The princess bowed deeply, saying, “I am the daughter of Emperor Yizong of Tang who recited the scripture.” The Immortal asked, “What sin caused your descent?” The officers said, “Greed.”

Soon many ghost officers said, “The Fengdu Great Emperor arrives!” He led the netherworld officials in salutation. The Immortal shone brightly, illuminating the netherworld.

The Supreme Ultimate Immortal Ge Xianweng said, “Do not harbor excessive desire. The Supreme Elder says: ‘No sin is greater than desire.’ Desire is the root of licentiousness. Also, ‘No sin is greater than greed.’ Greed breeds jealousy. The sin of greed is the gravest; small it destroys the self, great it ruins the family. The worldly ignorant do not understand purity; they know not that contentment is the way to nourish life. They only seek delicacies and fine dress, not realizing their pleasures harm their lives. They think themselves rich and glorious, but in truth bring disaster.

By creating all manner of evil karma, how can one avoid descending into hell? Knowing now the suffering of hell, why not have dealt with the world through emptiness and purity, practicing kindness, loyalty, filial piety, harmony, thrift, and gentleness? Purity unites with the Dao. Do not crave luxury; hold fast to simplicity. Luxury is the cause of hell; thrift the foundation of heaven.”

The Immortal said, “I now save you from hell. Will you renounce your love of luxury upon return?” The princess bowed repeatedly, promising, “I will reform.”

The Immortal asked, “Can you uphold the Five Precepts, Ten Virtues, Six Fasts, Three Meetings, Five Seasonal Sacrifices, and Five Taboos?” She said, “I will.”

The Immortal said, “Those who uphold can become heavenly officials; those who do not become lower ghosts.”

He explained the Five Precepts:

1. No killing.  
2. No indulgence in desire.  
3. No deceit.  
4. No stealing.  
5. No licentiousness.

The Ten Virtues:

1. Filial piety to parents.  
2. Loyalty and respect to ruler and teachers.  
3. Forgetting selfishness for the benefit of all.  
4. Restraining anger and improper thoughts.  
5. Ceasing disputes and removing malice.  
6. Self-sacrifice to aid the poor.  
7. Constantly considering how to benefit others.  
8. Planting trees by roads and wells for others.  
9. Promoting peace and removing violence.  
10. Praising and reciting the Dao, scriptures, and masters, expounding for others, and cultivating good thoughts.

Those who practice these have heavenly protection, avoid disaster, and gain blessings. The key is perseverance and sincerity.

She asked, “What are the Six Fasts?” The Immortal said, “The first, eighth, fourteenth, fifteenth, twenty-ninth, and thirtieth days of each month.”

She asked, “What are the Ten Fasts?” The Immortal said, “The first, eighth, fourteenth, fifteenth, eighteenth, twenty-third, twenty-fourth, twenty-eighth, twenty-ninth, and thirtieth days of each month. These ten days are those of the Ten Directions Compassionate Heavenly Lords who save all souls suffering in the three netherworlds.”

She asked, “What are the Three Meetings?” The Immortal said, “The seventh day of the first month is the Upper Meeting; the seventh day of the seventh month is the Middle Meeting; the fifth day of the tenth month is the Lower Meeting.”

She asked, “What are the Five Seasonal Sacrifices?” The Immortal said, “The first day of the first month is the Heavenly Sacrifice; the fifth day of the fifth month is the Earthly Sacrifice; the seventh day of the seventh month is the Dao and Virtue Sacrifice; the fifth day of the tenth month is the People’s Year Sacrifice; the twelfth month is the Nobles’ Sacrifice.”

She asked, “What are the Five Taboos?” The Immortal said, “The first is the Jiazi day, when the Supreme One records human sins; the second is Gengshen day, when the Three Corpses report sins; the third is one’s birth day, when the Northern Dipper records merits; the fourth is the eight solar terms, when deities record good and evil; the fifth is the Three Origins days, when Heaven, Earth, and Water officials record sins and blessings.”

The Supreme Ultimate Immortal Ge Xianweng said, “On these days one may hold rituals and fasts, recite scriptures, make offerings, and pray for blessings.”

The princess bowed again, saying, “I will remember and follow the great Way’s warnings.”

The Immortal then shone brightly, illuminating the netherworld; all sinful souls were born to heaven. At last, the Immortal called a youth in blue to escort the princess back to life, then ascended. The Fengdu Great Emperor and all netherworld spirits rejoiced.

The youth led the princess to a golden gate and pushed her inside. She suddenly awoke, lying on a jade bed with embroidered quilts, seeing her husband and attendants weeping by her side.

She rose. The attendants said, “Princess, you have slept long; we dared not disturb you.” The princess said, “Wealth is like a flame in stone; glory like a leaf floating on water; time like a dream of southern branches.”

After speaking, the princess was healed. She donned court robes, entered the palace, reported to the emperor, and returned all treasures to the treasury, begging permission to become a Taoist nun. The emperor, surprised, heard her tale of the netherworld and was pleased, granting permission and converting the Chongxian Faction’s Golden Immortal Temple to the Jade True Temple.

Since entering, the princess never left, barring all visits from nobles and family, guarding the gates. Daily she recited the Scripture of Constant Purity and Tranquillity without neglect.

Three years later, she saw the Supreme Ultimate Immortal Ge Xianweng appear amidst red light, saying, “Your ascent approaches; prepare your merit.” Then he vanished. The princess held a Yellow Register Great Rite. On the night of the Lantern Festival, phoenixes and cranes descended; the moon shone clear amid fragrant breezes. The princess mounted a phoenix and rose. She left a poem:

> How fare life and destiny? Do not exceed in luxury.  
> Keep chastity, health, thrift, peace;  
> Be upright, and avoid calamity.  
> Fate is fleeting, scarce and precious.  
> Break the nests of dispute,  
> Unlock the chains of fame and profit.  
> Clear the mind and seize the nature, yet do not hurry;  
> Thoughtfully consider highs and lows, joys and sorrows.  
> Awaken swiftly, for life is but a dream.

People praised the princess as a sage, copying her poems and offering tribute throughout the capital.

## VIII. The Divine Pill of Purity — The Venus Star’s Response

In the Southern Song, Prime Minister Yuan Tianfu was very greedy. Whenever court matters arose, large or small, he insisted on receiving money first. One day on the street, he saw two men fighting drunk; one was killed. Yuan said to the killer, “If you pay a thousand rolls of silk, I will guarantee no capital punishment.” The man produced only eight hundred. Yuan said, “Then I cannot help; you must die.”

The slain man’s family offered a thousand rolls; fearing death, the killer gave Yuan twelve hundred rolls. The family could not bribe much. Yuan adjudged the man’s crime as drunken manslaughter, sparing death, but ordered sixty blows and released him.

Yuan oppressed the people; they had no recourse. He amassed wealth, building mansions adorned with thousands of pounds of gold, silver, jewels, even surpassing the emperor’s palaces; his courtyard filled with beauties; meals cost hundreds of strings. Yuan delighted in pleasure and alchemy, seeking more wealth.

One day, a Taoist appeared, claiming to know the art of turning stone to gold. Yuan invited him in respectfully. The Taoist said, “Bring me some wine first.” Yuan retorted, “If you show no skill, demanding wine first, your desire is too strong.” The Taoist said, “You plunder wealth everywhere, oppress people, have thousands of rooms, treasure-filled vaults, thousands of beauties, and deep lust. Who has more desire? Yet you call me greedy; how laughable!”

Angered, Yuan ordered guards to seize the Taoist, who suddenly vanished, leaving a poem:

> Wealth, glory, high office and great merit,  
> All from self-love, awaiting the iron pavilion’s cover.  
> The household established, the King of Hell awaits.  
> How to escape? How to resolve debts?  
> Difficult indeed, hard to avoid human debts.

Yuan was gloomy, returning alone to his pavilion and fell asleep. In dreams, he saw a piece of gold, eagerly grasped it, but suddenly fell down a cliff into darkness. After long darkness, he saw light and hundreds wearing chains and shackles, many ghost soldiers pressing stones upon them.

A sign read “Prison of Greed.” Suddenly a white-clad man with dishevelled hair approached, saying, “Minister Yuan, you come late; we have awaited you long.” Yuan asked, “Who are you?” The man said, “I am the man killed in drunken brawl; you took bribes to spare the killer. Now you must return my life!” Yuan was terrified, tried to flee, but was seized and forced to repay his debts. Some brought a huge stone and pressed it on him; others bound his limbs, ready to crush him. Suddenly a voice commanded, “Stop! This man’s life is not yet due; six years more remain; release him for now!”

Yuan turned to see the Taoist who taught him alchemy, who sat with him on the stone, saying, “I am the Venus Star of the Upper Realm. You hold high office but do not cultivate virtue, indulging vain desires; this is the root of calamity.” Yuan said, “I am grateful for your rescue; I shall never forget.” The Taoist asked, “Have you recited any scripture?” Yuan said, “I have recited the Scripture of Constant Purity and Tranquillity.” The Taoist said, “No wonder Dao surrounds you; the scripture’s power far exceeds mine. Have you not heard, ‘Always dispel desire and the mind is tranquil; clear the mind and the spirit is pure’?”

“Come, sit, and I will explain. Sounds, sights, and pleasures tempt the ears and eyes; fragrant tastes tempt nose and tongue; comfort and ease tempt the body; all arise from desire. If desire is not dispelled, the spirit wanders, ambition dissipates, organs suffer. Those addicted to sensual pleasures live in confusion, harming body and mind without knowing pain, mistaking it for pleasure.”

“Few can turn back and save their lives. Therefore the sages see clearly and do not look confused; hear silently and do not listen confusedly; close the mouth and do not speak confusedly; abandon false thoughts and calamity naturally ceases. They preserve life and disregard outside things. Thus the sages have great power but do not display it lightly; they live in poverty and follow the Way, without desire. Those who cling to possessions live in fear, fearing loss, and so cannot live freely and easily.”

“The great Dao is void, natural, vast qi. If one cherishes life, the Dao’s nature is preserved. If the heart does not pursue externals, the Dao will be revealed. You must ponder this early and late.”

Having heard, Yuan rose, thanked the Taoist, and departed. Suddenly he heard his name called and saw the slain man chasing him. Yuan fainted and awoke in sweat and fear, realizing it was but a dream.

He then awoke to realize wealth causes calamity and desire is the root of sin. He resigned his office, opened granaries to feed the poor, sent maids home or married them off, and donated his mansions to build temples.

He changed his fine robes to coarse cloth, ate simple food, recited the Scripture of Constant Purity and Tranquillity, and cultivated for ten years. One day he dreamed the Taoist returned, saying, “You have practiced the Way over ten years, rare indeed. Your debts are cleared but you have not yet attained the Way.”

“True renunciation of desire and forgetfulness of greed makes a clear spirit, a tranquil nature, and thus an immortal. Your name is now in the upper realm of Bi Luo, in the Zhu Ling Immortal Palace. I give you a divine pill; take it now.” Yuan took the pill. The Taoist said, “Henceforth you will not hunger nor eat earthly food. The Inner Scripture says: ‘If eating continues, the body will not be light; if sensual pleasures continue, spirit will not be clear; if thought continues, the heart will not be calm; if the heart is not calm, spirit is not clear; if spirit is not clear, the Dao cannot be achieved.’ This is not about torturing the body by external practice, but about a clear and pure heart; this is the Way of immortals and the path to longevity. Thus cultivation is of the heart.”

The Supreme Elder Lord says, “The Dao is realized by the mind; the mind is illumined by the Dao. When the mind is clear, the great Dao naturally descends; when the Dao descends, the divine spirit dwells within. Like an oil lamp shining bright; light arises from the flame, the flame burns the wick, the wick is nourished by oil, and the oil is stored in the lamp. Without lamp, oil, wick, and flame, whence comes the light?”

“Likewise, the Dao depends on spirit for brilliance; spirit depends on the heart for peace. Man has heart; hence Dao can be fulfilled. Without spirit, body, and heart, whence comes the Dao? The divine spirit sees, hears, knows, and perceives, analyzing the principles of life; this is the mystery of divinity. Remember this well; one day we shall meet in the Zhu Ling Palace.” Having spoken, the Taoist vanished.

Yuan cultivated with techniques of dragon and tiger interweaving, yin and yang separation, five elements joining and separating, water and fire completing their task. He built a room for cultivation. Three years later, on the Double Ninth Festival, Yuan’s work was complete; he ascended in flight. When people opened the door, he was gone; only the Scripture of Purity and Tranquillity and a poem titled “Sending to Tang Duo Ling” remained:

> How fare life and destiny? The root and source tightly locked.  
> Guard the yang soul and yin spirit, all consumed.  
> Circulating fire through heaven’s circuit to brew the great medicine.  
> Look to the ocean depths, see the red waves.  
> High and low pass fleetingly; wealth and honor cast like dice.  
> When merit is full, ride phoenix and dragon to Bi Luo,  
> Attend the Jade Emperor and join the immortal ranks.

## IX. Judgment at Mount Tai — Purity Dispels Error

In the Zhenguan years of Tang, an official named Shen Hui was very greedy, often plundering the people’s wealth; he was investigated and exiled to a place called Zhulan. He often recited the Scripture of Constant Purity and Tranquillity from dawn to dusk. After recitation, he faced Mount Tai, bowed, prayed, and vowed, “Great Virtuous Heavenly Lord, I have no other wish but to return home.” The son of the Tai Mountain Prefect, called Bingling Gong, was traveling at Mount Hua and heard of Shen Hui’s recitation, saying in the void, “This man is rare indeed!” He reported to the Prefect, who said, “This is good.” So Shen Hui was summoned to the Mount Tai Prefect’s side chamber.

At noon, Shen Hui sat when a red-robed official came, saying, “The Prefect summons you.” Shen Hui asked, “Which Prefect?” The official said, “The East Mountain Prefect.” Shen Hui alarmed hurriedly dressed and followed. They came to the hall guarded by armored soldiers. The official told Shen Hui to wait while he reported. Soon a messenger appeared, saying, “The Prefect wishes to see you.” Shen Hui entered the “Morning Light Palace,” where golden curtains hung, guarded by ghost soldiers in gold armor.

Two green-clad youths parted the curtain, revealing a man seated in the center, wearing a traveling cap and a blue dragon robe, holding a cold jade tablet. Beside him stood a man about thirty, in gold hat and blue jade belt. They invited Shen Hui up. Trembling, Shen Hui advanced and bowed.

The Prefect slightly returned the bow and bade him sit. The Prefect said, “All who do evil are harmed by ghosts if not killed by men. You were punished for your greed. Having recited the Scripture of Constant Purity and Tranquillity over ten thousand times in one year, you have accumulated great merit and may meet me. The Heavenly Emperor forbids your return to rebirth. You recite and remember the scripture; if you understand and act accordingly, teaching others, your merit grows. Then if you cannot become a Supreme Immortal you may become a divine spirit; if not a divine spirit, a terrestrial immortal; if not a terrestrial immortal, a ghost immortal; and would no longer return to the cycle of birth and death.”

After speaking, a red-robed official laid scrolls on the desk, saying, “Mu Rengui seeks an audience; he is your maternal uncle.” Shen Hui looked away. The Prefect said to Mu Rengui, “Greatest error is desire; greatest calamity is greed; greatest sin is murder. You have all three; how can you be pardoned?”

The Prefect ordered ghost soldiers to punish him. Shen Hui saw two soldiers bring an iron bed and order Mu Rengui to strip. Before he finished, officers pricked his face causing half to burn; clothes removed, they pinned him to iron bed and burned beneath. His body charred to ash. A soldier fanned him; his body restored but chained.

Shen Hui rose, asking, “Can my uncle be saved?” The Prefect said, “Those who wrong others causing death cannot be pardoned.” Bingling Gong said, “Only if the wronged woman consents, and great merit is accumulated on earth, and prayers are made, and the Supreme Elder Lord commands the wronged to ascend, can pardon be given.”

Shen Hui said, “If I make Mu Rengui repent, remove his six desires and three poisons, hold the Supreme Yellow Register Great Rite and the Heavenly Lord’s forgiveness ceremonies, causing the wronged Zhao woman to ascend, can Mu Rengui be relieved?” The Prefect said, “Yes. Mu Rengui has five years left; two souls in hell bear sin, one soul guards the body which is covered in sores. After five years, life ends. After punishment in hell, he will be born as pig or sheep, or human, then executed.”

Hearing this, Shen Hui recited the Scripture of Constant Purity and Tranquillity; its radiance shook hell. The Prefect feared the scripture’s power and said, “You may return. Do not cherish desire or the three poisons. Give thanks for pardon. On return, persuade Mu Rengui to reduce desire. This suffices.” An official said, “I will escort you.” They came to a river; the official shouted. Shen Hui awoke in cold sweat, his family weeping. He stood and said, “Truly there are ghosts and spirits!” and warned all, “No more desire!” He carefully recited scripture; three days later, a general amnesty pardoned many sentenced to death and exile, and Shen Hui returned home.

He went to find his uncle, who lay ill three months with sores and blood-soaked bedding. The uncle said, “I dreamed you saved me.” He confessed his sins, held the Yellow Register Great Rite, printed ten thousand scriptures, distributed to the faithful, and held recitation assemblies to accumulate merit.

One midday, a woman appeared to thank him, leaving a poem:

> Years of grievances unredressed,  
> Today you held the great rite.  
> Six desires and three poisons extinguished,  
> By merit ascending to the heavens.

Shen Hui bowed to the sky.

Within half a month, the uncle’s sores healed; he regained strength. Shen Hui recited a poem:

> Six desires hard to extinguish, three poisons not ended,  
> Seeking cunning gains in haste.  
> When all are spent, who will bear impermanence?  
> Wealth piled high, at journey’s end nothing taken.  
> Sorrowful are past evil deeds—reflect well.  
> How to escape Fengdu’s judgment? No way to bargain.  
> Like winter melon frost-bitten in autumn.  
> I urge all to awaken swiftly,  
> And seek the land of pure joy.  
> When merit is full, join the Zhu Ling Palace,  
> Clear and bright, refining true yang.

The uncle believed the netherworld’s justice was true. He wrote a poem:

> Wisdom is no match for reflection,  
> Add not to six desires and three poisons.  
> After gathering honey from flowers,  
> Who knows for whom the bitterness is?

Shen Hui said, “Time flies like lightning; how can one not cultivate?” They embraced, resigned office, built a hut on Mount Tiantai with grass, sat daily reciting the Scripture of Constant Purity and Tranquillity three hundred times, and both attained immortality in their nineties.

## X. Accumulating Merit through Scripture Recitation — Blessings and Peace

In the Tang, a man named Liu Huaizhen, styled Daoyu, was made Prefect of Leling in Hebei in the second year of Taiping. Upon arrival, he was greedy, accepting two to three million in bribes, with no mercy, plundering the people without doing good. The people lamented, “Poor, poor, drained of marrow and sinew, better to meet the white-tufted tiger of the southern mountains than Liu Huaizhen.”

Such suffering endured! Later he became Prefect of Dingzhou; the people feared him. His wife said, “You have earned enough. Now you are first rank, a local lord, how long can your life be? How can you not cultivate merit for the next life?” Liu inquired how to cultivate. She said, “Officials rise by merit accumulated over lifetimes; if this life neglects merit, the next suffers; if one cultivates merit, fortune follows.” Liu agreed.

His wife said, “In my dressing room are jewels and gold worth over a million. Use them to build temples and Taoist shrines, maintain twenty or thirty monks and Taoists, support their meals and needs. First, you gain merit; second, accumulate wealth for next life; third, the state and people see your charity; fourth, without taking from the people, you earn praise. This is preservation and merit accumulation.” Liu was pleased, used the jewels to buy thirty acres and wood, and began construction, taking two years to finish temples, halls, and scripture pavilions with all sacred images.

Liu and wife daily burned incense, sought blessings, bought five acres for permanent residence, spending over a million strings. Though no people’s money was taken, he still secretly plundered. He failed to dispel desire. One day he said, “Though I built a blessed hall without taking from the people, I know not the cause and effect of the next life!” His wife asked, “How can one know?” He often thought, “I have accumulated great merit and sincerely sought blessings; why are the immortals unresponsive?”

One midday nap, Liu dreamed a Taoist entered, scolding him, “Though your halls are built with your money, you plunder the people; how can you have blessings? Now a first rank official, and you expect blessings for the next life; your greed is too great! These blessings have been given to Zhang Xiaopo at the south gate of Dingzhou.” Liu asked, “Why did she receive blessings?” The Taoist said, “Zhang bought grain cheap and sold at the same low price when prices rose; he often recited the Scripture of Constant Purity and Tranquillity, helped others, cherished life; his merit surpasses your buildings.” The Taoist vanished.

Awakening displeased, Liu summoned Zhang Xiaogong and Xiaopo, finding their deeds matched the Taoist’s words. Liu understood, resigned, and cultivated the Way of Purity, dispelling desire, living simply with his wife, teaching Daoist scriptures, and lived to one hundred twenty-nine.

## XI. Wealth Perceived as Emptiness — The True Realm of Penglai

In the Tang, a man named Liu Zichu failed the southern palace exam during the Dali years. Instead of reflecting, he led a dissipated life, frequenting brothels. Soon his money ran out; others despised him, and he barely had enough for necessities. His health declined, vigor faded.

One day, preparing to commit suicide at the east gate, he failed, sat beneath a large willow, silently reciting the Scripture of Constant Purity and Tranquillity thrice, near death. Suddenly a Taoist with green headband, white robe, and straw sandals came and sat beside him, carrying a bamboo basket, handsome in appearance. He said, “I see Dao in you; why such distress?” Liu opened his eyes and rejoiced, saying, “I am a scholar in my prime, twice failed exams by fate, so gave up, spent all money, unable to live, no home or food. I suffer greatly!” He fainted. The Taoist took two dates from the basket, helped him eat; Liu felt no hunger and thanked him. The Taoist said, “You have the appearance of great fortune.” Liu said, “Yet my heart is troubled; true men care for the spirit, wealth is but fleeting.” The Taoist said, “I can help you attain fortune; close your eyes!” Liu obeyed, felt his body float and his head grow dizzy.

Suddenly he saw a man in purple official robes holding an elephant scepter, sent by the King of the Fuyu Kingdom, summoning Liu as son-in-law. Liu said, “I am a scholar from Yishui near Donghai, twice failed exams, alone and poor; why should I be a royal son-in-law?” The envoy led Liu outside the east gate; about a dozen in brocade hats and robes bowed to him, brought horses with jade saddles and golden reins, surrounded by green canopies and red flags, escorting him on horseback.

Liu rejoiced and rode with many attendants and horses. After over eight hundred li, they reached a city sparsely populated, with beautiful scenery and several hundred officials in red and purple robes bowing. They proceeded to a jewel-adorned pavilion surrounded by mists. Suddenly a mounted man came forth, saying, “Prince Consort, proceed to the East China Hall!” The hall had crystal glass windows, red decorations, blooming flowers; many beautiful women played stringed instruments.

That night, Liu slept in the hall, the bell tolled from high tower, moonlight and breeze pleasant. A beautiful woman came to summon him to meet the princess, bringing a treasure box with a jeweled robe and a fine horse. A company of women from Wu and Yue sang and escorted him to a purple palace with golden steps and strict guards. The curtains were drawn and drums sounded; the King of Fuyu ascended the throne, wearing a splendid hat and dragon robe, flanked by palace maids with pheasant fans. A proclamation called, “The prince consort is summoned to court.” Liu was led to bow. The king said, “My beloved daughter Yin Fang will marry you today.” Liu received the imperial edict and held a grand banquet.

That night, the wedding chamber was brightly lit with numerous colorful robes and quilts. Palace maids brought a girl of sixteen, more beautiful than Xi Shi or Chang’e. Liu marveled and married her. Next morning, the king made Liu Marquis of Wuan, Commander of the Three Provinces and Governor of Wuan County. For ten years Liu governed well, fathering two sons, his fame spreading. Later he became Grand Marshal of the Southern Expedition, leading tens of thousands to victory. For his merit, the emperor granted him a golden mountain; five years later his sons were ennobled, and the family prospered.

Yet joy turned to sorrow. Three years later, his wife died; two years later, his sons died. Liu grieved deeply. Then slander accused him of rebellion; the emperor ordered him to return. Liu dared not resist and met the emperor. The emperor said, “You were once a scholar struggling to live. I made you prince consort and king for fifteen years. Why rebel?” Liu said, “I am but a commoner; thanks to your grace, I dare not rebel.” The emperor said, “Evidence is firm; what say you?” Soldiers were ordered to boil Liu alive. His clothes were stripped for cutting meat and boiling in hot soup. Liu begged to return to common life, denied. As the knives began, boiling oil roared; Liu cried out in pain and suddenly awoke— it was a dream.

The Taoist beside him said, “Why did you faint?” Liu, sweating and trembling, told the dream. The Taoist said, “You recite the Scripture of Constant Purity and Tranquillity, which says, ‘Look inward at the mind, and there is no mind; look outward at the form, and there is no form; look afar at things, and there are no things. Having realized these three, one sees only emptiness.’ You are a poor man with desires. Your position and all these are false, like a dream, only emptiness is real. If you seek wealth, you are made king and given a golden mountain!” Liu understood, saying, “Life is illusory; why lament beauty?” He thanked the Taoist, who said, “In three years we shall meet at Penglai; if you persist in the scripture, you will fulfill your wish.” He vanished.

Because he ate a date, Liu no longer hungered, found a quiet place, built a grass hut, and sat in cultivation, undistracted, reciting for three years. One day a white crane descended; Liu mounted and flew away, leaving three poems:

The first, “Colors are bright flowers but brief”:

> Do not disdain the bright flowers;  
> Their light and beauty are like floating clouds.  
> Better to realize the profound principle:  
> The heart without heart, the Way is clear.

The second, “Form is like illusion and not lasting”:

> Form is empty form; do not hold it dear.  
> Attached to household and deeds, all falls to emptiness.  
> Better to realize the profound principle:  
> Form without form, the Way is clear.

The third, “Things are fleeting as borrowed and not enduring”:

> White jade and gold are emptiness.  
> Come empty-handed, leave empty-handed.  
> Better to realize the profound principle:  
> Things without things, the Way is clear.

## XII. Tested a Thousand Times — Purity Leads to Immortality

In the Tang’s Tianbao years, a scholar named Li Tong, over fifty, repeatedly failed the imperial exams. Daily he recited the Scripture of Constant Purity and Tranquillity, understanding much, almost eating and sleeping with the scripture, always reciting.

One day his wife died; he only sighed. His only son died a year later; Li said, “I am finally free of bonds!” He drank and composed poetry. Friends admonished, “A wife is one’s companion for life; burial together is normal. You show little grief; your son dies and you quickly forget. How can you be a father?”

Li said, “I heard Zhuangzi beat a basin to celebrate his wife’s death, and did not weep at his son’s death; this is true understanding. Why lament? The Scripture says: ‘Look inward at the mind, and there is no mind; outward at the form, no form; afar at things, no things. Having realized these three, one sees only emptiness. Observe emptiness as emptiness; emptiness empties nothing; what is emptied is nothing; nothing is also nothing; nothing is also nothing; tranquil and constant.’ The true constant emptiness is the great Dao. If the Dao is true constant emptiness, what have I to grieve?”

Li divided his property to the poor, gave land to neighbors, built a stone chamber on Mount Hua with grass and stones, reciting the Scripture daily, eating herbs, firmly cultivating.

After three years, his heart was steadfast and moved the Supreme Elder Lord, who sent an immortal to convert Li. The immortal, disguised as a Taoist, entered the chamber and asked seven times about his experience; Li did not reply. The Taoist said, “Though the Dao cannot be expressed in words, silence does not mean attainment; those who talk endlessly of their gains have but small arts. One who cultivates must first adapt to all mundane affairs without disorder. Then sit quietly and observe the self; any arising thought must be swiftly dispelled, all wandering thoughts extinguished.”

“The Scripture says: ‘Observe emptiness as emptiness, emptiness empties nothing; what is emptied is nothing; nothing is also nothing; nothing is also nothing; tranquil and constant.’ One must first empty the heart of all things, not be ensnared by externals, to reach tranquil constancy.” Li thanked the Taoist, asking for teaching.

The Taoist said, “The foremost is to extinguish the restless heart and preserve the observing mind. Not to rise thoughts is to hold ‘empty mind’, not to cling is ‘resting mind.’”

“Do not seek wisdom hastily in stillness; haste harms nature and wisdom. Without effort, true wisdom comes. True wisdom is not deceit; the greatest wisdom appears foolish. This is the basis of stillness and wisdom and the only path to the limitless Dao. Excessive thought breeds evil; spirits take fair forms to confuse you according to your thoughts.”

He told Li, “If you can settle your heart, always be calm and pure, your cultivation will succeed.” Li said, “I can.” The Taoist said, “Tomorrow I will teach you; now I leave.” He vanished.

Next morning, the Taoist returned; Li welcomed him. Li said, “I am a dull scholar, who only knows emptiness, like plucking strings on wood.” The Taoist said, “I will refine an elixir; you must guard the furnace, remain silent and calm. Can you?” Li said, “I can.” The Taoist placed the furnace, took an iron pot, put elixirs inside, breathed on it facing the sun, and lit the fire.

He cautioned, “Sit south of the furnace, practicing ‘Observe emptiness as emptiness… tranquil and constant’. If a thousand demons come to disturb, regard them as nonexistent. If you speak or move, the elixir fails and your Dao will not be achieved. I will return in three days; then the elixir will be complete. We will take it and ascend as immortals. Remember my words.”

Li sat calmly. Soon, dark clouds gathered, thunder roared, winds blew, and heavy rains flooded the chamber. Li did not move; the water rose to his neck but did not enter the furnace nor his mouth and nose. Soon the water receded.

Then fires burned the hills; the chamber nearly caught. Li sat still, without fear or resentment. The fire soon died out.

Next came many hungry ghosts of varied colors and terrifying faces, threatening to eat Li if he spoke; Li remained silent, and they vanished.

Then came hungry tigers; Li ignored them; they sniffed and left.

Then venomous snakes entwined his body; he remained unmoved. A beautiful young woman came to seduce him; he was unmoved. Then thirty armed robbers entered, threatening to eat his heart; Li remained silent. They departed.

Then appeared a man dressed as an emperor, holding a cold jade tablet, followed by the fearful ox-headed jailer with iron fork, shouting, “King Yama has arrived; why do you not rise to greet him?” The jailer was to impale Li if he did not speak.

The king said, “Bring his wife.” Soon she was brought. The king said, “If she persuades her husband to speak, her suffering ends.” She said, “Husband, we are close; if you speak, I will be free; if not, I suffer.” Li remained silent.

The king said, “This stubborn man’s wife shall be sawed in two before his eyes!” The jailers tore her apart, blood flowing; she wailed. Li did not speak.

The king said, “Bring his son.” The son was brought. The king said, “I will tear you to pieces!” The son said, “Father, be merciful! My mother suffers because you do not speak. If you speak, I will be saved.” Li was unmoved.

The king, enraged, ordered his soul taken.

Li felt dizzy and found his soul born in the daughter of the Lord of Qi Prefecture, beautiful but mute. At eighteen, called “the mute girl,” she was married to the third son of Ma Yuanwai. He liked her beauty and accepted her muteness. After three years, she bore a son. One day Ma came home drunk, said, “Your son is mute; what use?” He dragged the boy by the foot, blood spat on her face. She cried, “How bitter my fate! How pitiful my son!”

Li awoke in the chamber; the furnace glowed red, sparks scattered, thunder roared. The Taoist came, saying, “The elixir was about to complete but your cry spoiled it. It cannot be refined. You have not reached tranquil constancy.” The Taoist lamented, “What a pity! I will return in six years.”

He wrote a poem for Li:

> Slightly study profound principles, ask your disciple;  
> Elixir cooks, true lead reveals colorlessness.  
> Crane nature leisurely soars to Bi Luo,  
> Dao heart is still, skill is seen.  
> Dragon’s roar heralds auspicious light on golden summit,  
> Tiger’s howl sends auspicious wind to jade furnace.  
> Six years hence, work complete,  
> Tranquil constant enters the immortal city.

The Taoist said, “In six years, recite the Scripture of Constant Purity and Tranquillity well; only then can you become immortal. Remember my words!” Then he vanished.

Li hung a heavy stone in the chamber, sitting beneath it reciting scripture unmoved. After six years, the Taoist reappeared riding a phoenix. Li, joyful, saluted and rode away with his master.

Midair, he composed:

> Observe emptiness; emptiness is true emptiness.  
> When emptiness is none, none is also free.  
> None is none; tranquil constant;  
> Ride the whale’s back to heaven.

He also composed a poem:

> Studying books and learning for over fifty years, snow on my head.  
> No name on the golden list; trust scholars bring harm.  
> Wife dead, son gone; no time for love; enter the Dao.  
> Deeply thank master’s words; tranquil constant ascends to the nine heavens.

## XIII. Nie Churen

In the first year of Song Xining, in Yi Prefecture, there lived a famous physician named Nie Churen. He was steady and handsome, over thirty, able from childhood to recite the Scripture of Constant Purity and Tranquillity and deeply understand its meaning. He charged all patients equally, regardless of wealth. People called him a savior of suffering.

Once an official named Huang invited him to treat his wife’s illness. She was young and beautiful, trying to seduce Nie during diagnosis. He avoided her and prescribed medicine for madness, then left. Days later, she feigned illness and asked for treatment. Nie declined due to other duties. Repeated requests were declined, but once, urgently summoned, he came.

He avoided her gaze and said, “You are healthy, what disease?” She said, “My husband is away; come tonight and I will treat you well. I dream of you every night!” Nie understood, left quickly; she called but he ignored her.

That night, someone knocked, saying, “A patient is ill; doctor come!” Nie opened the door; it was the woman. She seized him, saying, “If you consent, I will make you rich; if not, I will die here no longer the official’s wife.” Helpless, he agreed. He led her to a low wall, grabbed her hand, jumped over, and fled to a southern mountain, reciting the Scripture and cultivating earnestly, without desire.

The city god of Qi Prefecture heard and reported to the official in charge of lifespan, granting Nie a life to one hundred twenty and immortality. Meanwhile, Huang’s wife’s lifespan was reduced to fifty; her soul was bound in the netherworld, suffering illness and stomach pain as the jailers bound her to iron pillars, slit her belly, and washed out her heart to cleanse lust. She endured three years of pain.

The jailers said, “You have seven years of such punishment; three remain; then your three souls descend to hell; even rebirth will be as a woman’s belly.” She asked how to be saved; jailers said, “Hold Yellow Register rites, turn from evil to good; recite the Scripture daily; then punishment ends.” She asked, “Is this true?” They said, “Yes! Reform, accumulate merit, repent lust sins. The Heavenly Lords’ words are true. Repent and do not sin again!”

The official pitied his wife and arranged Yellow Register rites, chanting a thousand scrolls of the “Nine Netherworlds Sin Removal Repentance,” printing ten thousand copies of the Scripture and distributing widely. Thus the spirits pardoned her sin and she recovered.

She recalled her lustful past and said many commit lustful sins, countless in number. She told the official, “When Wu Zetian ruled Tang, she had illicit relations with monks and was sent to the poison snake hell.” He asked, “What punishment?” She said, “In hell, clothes and hats are stripped; thrown into scorpion pits; stung painfully; only then can they dress and leave.” He asked, “How long?” She said, “One hundred years; then rebirth as a prostitute.” She urged her husband, “Do more good and refrain from evil; retribution is real!” He realized and they cultivated together, reciting one hundred times daily, resigned office, built a chamber, and cultivated nine years until ascending. They left two poems:

> (1)  
> Fengdu hell is unbearable to see,  
> Frightening all who gaze.  
> Thousands of deaths and rebirths,  
> Difficult are the roads of the living.

> (2)  
> When desire ceases, desire no longer arises,  
> Cultivate purity, clear and bright.  
> Emptiness is truly empty,  
> The heavenly realm is but in the heart’s reform.
