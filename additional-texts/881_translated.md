# The Manifestations and Responsive Deeds of the Thunder Deity

According to the report in the *Southeast Express*: On the afternoon of the twenty-sixth day of the eighth month of the year 2008, in Donghan, Fuqing of Fujian Province, a certain man, surnamed Xu, holding an iron rod, swore to Heaven that if he truly owed money, he would be struck by thunder. Yet one minute later he was indeed struck by lightning. Fortunately, after urgent treatment he was out of danger. Three years before, a friend’s wedding had occasioned Xu to entrust Huang to give a gift of five hundred yuan; but gradually Xu forgot this matter, and Huang, aggrieved, uttered complaints before friends. On that afternoon, Huang came to Xu’s home with a wooden staff to demand the debt; Xu, likewise armed with an iron rod, refused to acknowledge owing money for the sake of face. At last Huang declared that if Xu dared to swear by Heaven that he did not owe money, then Huang would forgo the money. Xu, hearing this, swore publicly that if he truly owed money he might be struck by thunder. Unexpectedly, one minute later Xu was indeed felled by lightning! The border guards of Lianfeng, Fuqing, received the alarm and sent the man to hospital for rescue; the doctors confirmed that the man had indeed been injured by lightning. The doctors informed the border guards that the electric charge at that time was slight, and did not cause fatal injury. After treatment, Xu finally escaped death. From this example we learn: whispers among men are heard by Heaven as thunder; in a dark chamber where conscience is troubled, the divine eye is as swift as lightning. Whatever a mortal thinks or intends, Heaven, Earth, ghosts and spirits all know and see. Moreover, one must not rashly utter solemn oaths; when a man swears, there are Heaven, Earth, ghosts and spirits to witness and bind him; if he violates his oath, the consequences are most grave.

There was a man in my village named Luo Jiting, a scholar of reckless disposition, who did not believe in cause and effect. He often wrote on walls many words without cause or reason, chiefly to disparage Buddhism and Daoism, expounding upon the sayings of Han Yu and Ouyang Xiu. Though utterly idle and frivolous, he was yet unconscious of his errors. In the early years of the Republic, he lodged at the Wu Family Temple in Rongzhou to teach. Early autumn, daily he took his students to catch frogs and shrimps. One day he caught more than a hundred, put them in the kitchen, then went out on some business. His wife, Madam Zhu, unable to bear the many frogs, skinned them alive and set them free. On return, Luo Jiting beat Madam Zhu without cease; she, enraged, hanged herself; Luo Jiting, continuing in anger, stamped upon the corpse and cursed without end. Suddenly dark clouds gathered, thunder roared and rain poured; after one bolt of lightning the sky cleared. Luo Jiting was found scorched all over, his body and head separated into two parts; Madam Zhu revived and is still alive and well. This was in the first year of the Republic. At the time I was serving in Chengdu, recalling that my great-grandfather Zilan had recorded this in a written command. After twenty years, I had long forgotten it; now on the occasion of the coming of fellow villager Mr. Gu Yazhai, who studied present-day affairs, many say that being struck by lightning is but an electric shock, and that cause and effect or retribution do not exist. Mr. Yazhai related this matter in detail, urging me to record it for study. Mr. Gu was brother-in-law to Luo Jiting and witnessed the event.

In our village there were two brothers who, their father having died early, were raised by their mother who begged at the gates until they came of age and married. But these two brothers were notorious for their unfilial conduct and rebellion. Especially the elder and his wife, who were hated by all. They not only refused to feed their aged mother, driving her from the door, but often beat her cruelly, so that the old woman was near death, and no admonition could move them. At last, the old mother was tormented to death.

Not long after the mother’s death, on a certain day in the fifth month of the lunar calendar of the year 1946, at noon, there was a thunderstorm. The two brothers sat smoking on the bed in the hall, while the elder’s wife washed dishes in the kitchen. When the rain ceased, people came out to sit and enjoy the cool air at the doorway. I was then ten years old and playing with some children at the gate. Suddenly a clap of thunder was heard, and a fireball, somewhat larger than a basketball, fell at the door of their house, then rolled inside. There was a great crash and a cloud of smoke rose, obscuring all view. We children were terrified and crouched on the ground motionless. Then shouts were heard, “The Jin family has been struck by lightning!” People rushed from all directions to the door. As the smoke cleared, the younger brother was found kneeling strangely some ten meters away on the threshing floor; the elder and his wife had been struck dead, one in the hall, the other in the kitchen.

The villagers applauded the death of the pair struck by thunder, saying: “This is the inevitable end of those unfilial to their parents. If men do not punish, Heaven does. Truly, evil shall receive its due reward.”

A woman, if she be devoid of womanly virtues to the extent that she stands astride the wall to curse her neighbours, may be considered a thorough scold; if she add to this the abuses of her husband and harshness to her parents-in-law, she is indeed a disgrace among women. One Zhang of the Northwest (real name withheld) was such a person, dreaded by neighbours on all sides; even slight offence brought forth her coarse and foul abuse. Zhang often had illicit affairs; her husband died young, leaving her with a pitiable mother and three daughters. After her husband’s death, her evil habits grew worse, her words to her mother-in-law were more abusive than those of the most vulgar harlot, and her blows upon the mother-in-law were more frequent than upon swine or dogs. Strange to relate, though a woman unafraid of heaven or earth, she would tremble at the sound of thunder. One afternoon, having just abused her mother-in-law, a sudden clap of thunder, like the cracking of the roof’s big poplars, caused her to hide in bed and wail piteously without cease. Her three children wrapped their mother in quilts, climbed upon her, covering her with their bodies. They heard the earth shake with a great roar; the poplars on the roof snapped together, the ridge of the house was broken; then the clouds dispersed and the thunder ceased. The three dutiful daughters pulled out their frightened mother from the bed, but she still babbled incoherently. Neighbours came to see, and the children told what had happened.

My aunt’s old home had a woman who, while washing her face at the pond, suddenly saw several flags stuck behind her back, like a warrior on a stage. Others could not see them, which amazed her. An elder told her this was the mysterious and terrible “death flag”; those upon whom it is planted are to be struck by thunder, for they have committed grievous evil in conscience. Has she been unfilial to her mother-in-law? If so, she should drink the wash water of her mother-in-law’s feet or the water used to rinse her shoes, swear to henceforth be filial to her, and must fulfil this oath, then the death flag will silently disappear, and thunder will no longer strike her. The woman did not believe this and did not comply; not long after she was struck by lightning and died a dreadful death. In the neighbouring Song village, a woman in like case, hearing this warning, was greatly afraid, drank her mother-in-law’s foot-wash water, became filial, and gradually the flag disappeared; thereafter she was safe. In our native place it is generally held that only those who do grievous evil or are unfilial to their parents incur Heaven’s retribution by thunder. Before this, there is warning; the death flag is that warning. If at that time the person sincerely repents and acts accordingly, the calamity may be averted. Good and evil have their retribution; this is Heaven’s principle.

In the yihai year of Kangxi, Su Prefecture was flooded. A pregnant woman, her husband ill and unable to provide food, took her three-year-old son into the city to borrow rice, and obtained four dou. About a mile from home, rain fell heavily, and she took shelter at the door of a house where a child lived. The pregnant woman, exhausted, could no longer carry the rice nor her son, and entrusted the child to watch the rice sack, with agreement to bring the son home and return for the rice. The child, consulting his mother, hid the rice. The pregnant woman, coming back unable to find the rice, dared not return home, and hanged herself beside the house. Her husband, bereft of support, soon died. The following year in June, the child who hid the rice, now moved with his parents to Yangyu Alley in the city, suddenly spoke ghostly words: “I have already reported you; the Thunder God will punish you!” Within three days, lightning and thunder struck, killing the mother and child in the courtyard, their bodies embraced together. This was on the third day of the seventh month of the bingzi year of Kangxi.

A man in Jiangxi made his living by herding ducks. His mother died and his father was old. The man disliked his father’s idleness and often abused him. One day, while abusing his father, a clap of thunder lifted the man into the courtyard. Villagers came to see him; his beard, hair, and clothes were burned by thunderfire, his mind confused, unable to speak or move. A local man able to read the “Thunder Writing” advised quickly to look under the cooking pot; there was indeed an unusual red seal inscription. Upon examination, it read “Thunder Warning: Unfilial.” Neighbours then invited a Daoist to perform rites of fasting and repentance on his behalf; the man knelt before his father, and after three days he began to speak. From that time he reformed and became a filial son. These two cases are similar: one was killed, the other injured, showing that those who rebel and are unfilial surely suffer evil retribution. If guilty, one must repent. Strangely, marks remained on their bodies called “Thunder Writing” by the ancients. This shows that in the vast universe nothing is without wonder; many inscrutable and miraculous events occur beyond the explanation of modern science. I earnestly advise all to believe in what is true rather than disbelieve, and to hold reverence for Heaven, Earth, ghosts and spirits.
