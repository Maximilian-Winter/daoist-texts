# The Scripture of the Harmony of the Three (Exposition Directing the Inner Nourishment of Nature)  

When one is about to nourish the nature and prolong life and delay the appointed time (of death), one must carefully consider the latter end, and beforehand take thought of the beginning. That which man is endowed with to serve as a body is originally one and void. The primordial essence is diffusely scattered, and depends upon the vital breath to be established at the first. Yin and Yang form the measure, wherein reside the souls and spirits. The Yang spirit is the daily soul, the Yin spirit the monthly spirit. The soul and spirit are reciprocally the dwelling and habitation. The nature presides within, fixedly placed in the secret chamber of Yin and Yang; the feelings and passions preside without, building the enclosing walls and ramparts. When the walls and ramparts are complete, then men and things are at rest. At this time the passions are harmonized with Heaven and Earth. Heaven (Qian) moves straight and upright, the vital breath spreads and the essence flows; Earth (Kun) is still and contracting, being the abode of the Way. The male is firm and applies force then withdraws; the female is soft and transforms and nourishes. The nine returns and the seven revolutions, the eight returns and the six abodes—male white and female red, metal and fire mutually bound. Then water fixes fire, the beginning of the five elements. The highest good is like water, pure and without blemish. The image of the Way is true and difficult to portray. It transforms and diffuses, each dwelling alone. Like the egg of a fowl, white and black combined, lengthwise one inch, taken as the beginning. The four limbs and five viscera, sinews and bones are all complete. After the full ten months, it emerges from its membrane. The bones are weak and pliable, the flesh smooth as lead.  

Lead: originally like a kind of candy.  

The ancient immortals say: "To cultivate nature, first cultivate life; then enter the scripture of cultivation. To cultivate life and not cultivate nature is the first disease of cultivation." For nature is Yin, life is Yang; Yin and Yang act together, and only by cultivating both nature and life can one enter the wondrous state where body and spirit are both subtle and combined with the true Way. Therefore before cultivating nature, one must urgently cultivate life; and having completed life, then one should cultivate nature. There is none who cultivates life not and surpasses the ordinary; none who cultivates nature not and attains saintship. The Immortal Elder, in teaching the way of nourishing nature, first says: "When one is about to nourish nature, one must first prolong life and delay the appointed time." This is to show that if one wishes to nourish the nature, one cannot but first prolong life. If one be of superior wisdom and sharp understanding, then without waiting to cultivate life, one cultivates nature directly, completes all at once, and straightway ascends to the saintly realm. Yet such men of superior wisdom are few, and those of middling and low capacity many. If one does not first cultivate life, but immediately nourishes nature, it is as if one is but the Yin of the self; if there be a slightest leak, there will be the danger of casting away the body within the body. Therefore one must first cultivate the way of acting and returning to firmly establish the foundation of life; then proceed to embrace the unity of non-action in order to consummate the ancestral nature. When nature and life are both perfected, the original life is indestructible and endures as long as Heaven and Earth. But the way of prolonging life is to delay the appointed time. To delay the appointed time means to delay one's time of death. One who can delay the appointed time can thereby prolong life. But if one desires to delay the appointed time, one must carefully consider how one dies. To consider how one dies, one especially must first take thought of how one lives. Life is first, death is last. Confucius said: "If one does not know life, how can one know death?" For if one does not know how to live, then one does not know how to die; when one knows how to live, one knows how to die. If one can know the mechanism of life and death, then to delay death and prolong life is not difficult.  

Originally man is endowed with a body, which is fundamentally one and void. Through the ordinary father and mother, man and woman in coition, the primordial essence and vital breath are established from nothingness to being. The male breath belongs to Yang, the female breath to Yin; Yin and Yang two breaths interpenetrate, and the souls and spirits of man and woman dwell therein. The soul is the Yang spirit like the sun, the spirit the Yin spirit like the moon; the soul and spirit are reciprocally the dwelling and habitation. The soul belongs to nature, presiding within, fixed in the secret chamber of Yin and Yang; the spirit belongs to essence, presiding without, building the outer city walls and ramparts. Yin and Yang's place within is like the five viscera and six entrails; the city walls and ramparts are like the four limbs and hundred bones without. When the ramparts and walls are complete, men and things can dwell at peace within. At this time of Yin-Yang interpenetration, man and woman unite by their feelings, as Heaven above and Earth below. Heaven and Earth correspond; Heaven moves and is upright, the vital breath spreads and essence flows; Earth is still and contracting, being the abode of the Way. The male is the firm Way, exerting force and withdrawing; the female is the soft Way, transforming and nourishing. The superior breaths of Yin and Yang condense and form the image; the embryonic origin is already formed. Nine is the number of metal, seven that of fire, eight that of wood, six that of water. Nine returns and seven revolutions, eight returns and six abodes; the breaths of metal, wood, water, and fire all enter the embryo. Nine returns and seven revolutions, eight returns and six abodes differ from the doctrine of reversal and return in usage. This returning means the breaths of male and female, Yin and Yang, return to the embryo, entering from without to within. The male's essence is white, belonging to metal; the female's blood is red, belonging to fire. The breaths of metal and fire are mutually bound and gathered in one place; within metal there is the breath of water, within fire the breath of wood, so water fixes fire. Fire refines metal, water aids fire, wood nourishes fire, metal nourishes water; metal, wood, water, and fire mutually influence and transform each other, wherein is true earth, the origin of the five elements. Though the embryo contains the transformations of the five elements, at the time of Yin-Yang interpenetration, secretly there is a point of innate creation entering within, giving birth to water. This water is born before Heaven and Earth, pure and without spot. It is the image of the Way, true and difficult to portray, containing the utmost void and the utmost being, the utmost emptiness and the utmost reality. The essence and blood of male and female cannot make the work without this water. This water is formless yet able to generate form; therefore its transformations are unfathomable. First it transforms into water and produces kidneys; second it transforms into fire and produces the heart; third it transforms into wood and produces the liver; fourth it transforms into metal and produces the lungs; fifth it transforms into earth and produces the spleen. It transforms and distributes, each dwelling alone. Yet though they dwell alone, the breaths of the five elements still gather in one place, like the egg of a fowl, white and black combined. Black is Yin, white is Yang; Yin and Yang correspond, one breath mixed and contained. Therefore it is said lengthwise one inch, taken as the beginning. The beginning is the root; one breath is the root. When the root is established, then the branches and trunk arise. Hence it is said "the four limbs and five viscera, sinews and bones are complete." This means the four limbs, five viscera, sinews, and bones are all formed and completed by the transformation of one breath. After ten full months, the breath is sufficient and form complete, it emerges from the membrane, bones weak and pliable, flesh smooth as lead. Thus is the way of human birth. If a man clearly understands this principle of body birth, harmonizes his true Yin and true Yang, cultivates backwards and completes the single breath in the embryo, forming the sacred embryo, tending it for ten months, having a body outside the body, creation is by himself, and he can thereby delay death and prolong life. Ah! Cultivation backwards is the way of immortality, indeed not easy to know; the forward way is the way of human birth, also difficult to understand. If one knows the way of human birth, then in the reversal lies the way of immortality. How is it that men do not carefully consider the way of human birth and rashly imagine to learn immortality? Is this not cause for sighing?  

The male of the Kan trigram is the moon, the female of the Li trigram is the sun. The sun bestows virtue, the moon diffuses light; the moon receives the sun's transformation, the body is not impaired or injured. When Yang loses its accord, Yin intrudes upon its brightness, the waxing and waning obscure and eclipse one another, Yang loses its form, Yin overcomes and disaster arises. Male and female mutually assist, drawing in and breathing out to nourish the seed. Male and female intermix, seeking their like. Metal changes into water, water's nature is flowing and circumspective; fire changes into earth, obstructing water's course. The male moves outward and exerts, the female is still and hides within; if overflowing and exceeding the season, she holds him fast. The spirit (Po) restrains the soul (Hun), not allowing licentiousness. Neither cold nor hot, advancing and retreating in accord with the season, both obtain harmony, and both manifest their tokens and signs.  

The previous section spoke of the way of human birth, dependent upon Yin and Yang interpenetrating and forming. This section extends the analogy and confirms the way of cultivating immortality; if Yin and Yang do not interpenetrate, the spiritual embryo does not form. For the Kan trigram is male, its body Yin, symbolizing the moon; the Li trigram is female, its body Yang, symbolizing the sun. The moon is originally black in body, pure Yin without Yang, borrowing the sun to give light; every month at the end of the dark and beginning of the new moon, it meets with the sun. The sun bestows virtue, the moon diffuses light; the moon receives the sun's transformation, so the black body is enlightened and uninjured. This is the natural course of sun and moon meeting in due time. If the sun and moon fail to keep their accord, stray from the regular law, Yin mistakes Yang, the moon's Yin energy injures the sun's body; waxing and waning cause moon eclipses, obscuring its brightness; Yang loses its form, Yin overcomes and disaster arises. For the way of sun and moon is to move obliquely; at the time of meeting, the sun is below and the moon above; the sun's rays strike the moon, and the moon produces light. If they meet from north to south or east to west, their bodies face each other and obscure their light; Yin and Yang contend and fail to harmonize. At the new moon there is a solar eclipse, at the full moon a lunar eclipse. The solar eclipse is Yin covering Yang; the lunar eclipse is Yang covering Yin. Both solar and lunar eclipse arise from Yin and Yang being excessive over each other.  

Similarly, male and female mutually assist, one inhaling and one exhaling, and thus nourish the seed. All things, male and female mixed, like with like unite to beget offspring. These are the ways of Yin and Yang intermingling, ceaseless procreation. Again, as metal changes into water, water's nature is flow and circulation, unceasing and forming order; fire changes into earth, earth is thick and obstructive, damming water so that water cannot flow. Again, male moves actively and outwardly exerts, female is still and within hides. If the male lusts for the female excessively, the union is inordinate and exceeds the season, losing the male's essential movement, the male is restrained by the female. These two, though Yin and Yang harmonize, are not in harmony, producing destruction within life and bringing forth disaster. From this observation it is known that Yin and Yang prize harmony and union, but especially harmony in just measure. To obtain the just measure is true Yin and true Yang; failing to obtain the just measure is false Yin and false Yang. The distinction between true and false lies only in the just measure or its absence. The cultivator uses the true feelings of the spirit (Po) to rouse the spirit (Hun). The Po is the mind of the Way, the firm emotion of true knowledge; the Hun is the human mind, the soft nature of spiritual knowledge. The soft nature governs advance and retreat with little restraint; encountering things it lingers, seeing scenes it arouses feelings. The firm emotion is resolute and decisive, with dominion. The Po uses the Hun, with the firmness of emotion and softness of nature, then the human mind is tranquil and the mind of the Way manifests. Nature and feeling harmonize, firmness and softness are one breath. Yet though the mind of the Way controls the human mind, to gain the softness and compliance of the human mind is enough. If one controls too much, always treating the human mind as a matter, then the mind of the Way will be obscured, the utmost clarity becomes darkness; within the mind of the Way, the human mind seizes opportunity and arises, nature and feeling become discordant, good fortune turns to misfortune. Hence it is said, "One must not be licentious and extravagant." Neither cold nor hot means nature is not disturbed and feeling not confused. "Do not forget, do not assist" is the work. Advance and retreat in due time means to lay aside the evil and preserve sincerity, holding to the middle and using the way of expedience; neither too great nor too small, both circles complete, each obtains harmony, doing no harm to the other and benefiting oneself. Nature and feeling express truth; Yin and Yang mingle and form; this is confirmed in the way of the sun and moon combining their tokens and proceeding.  

The ospreys cry softly on the islets of the river; the modest and virtuous lady is the gentleman's good mate. The male is not solitary, the female does not dwell alone. The black tortoise and the serpent wind and support each other, to show the male and female must mutually assist. Suppose two females dwell in one chamber, both exceedingly fair; if Su Qin were to speak and Zhang Yi act as matchmaker, displaying persuasive tongues, unfolding fair words, and sincerely harmonizing hearts, making them husband and wife, yet with dishevelled hair and decayed teeth, they would never truly know each other. If medicines are not of the same kind, differing in name and type, severed and unevenly divided, losing their principles and order—though the Yellow Emperor tend the furnace, Tai Yi hold the fire, the Eight Lords cast and refine, and Huainan adjust and harmonize; though they establish the cosmos and raise altars, jade forms the steps, the qilin’s fat and phoenix's grease are prepared, one kneels long and prays to the spirits, bathes and fasts, hoping for some hope—still it is like patching a pot with glue, or applying clay to a sore; removing cold by adding ice, removing heat by applying decoctions; flying tortoise and dancing serpent, yet the more they are so, the more discordant they become.  

Severed and unevenly divided: originally separated doses.  

The previous section said that Yin and Yang must correspond and advance and retreat in due time to successfully cultivate the Way. This section speaks of the harm of solitary Yin or scanty Yang, all the evil of non-conforming kinds, to enlighten men to turn from evil to correctness. The Yi says: "The Way is called one Yin and one Yang." Because there is Yin and Yang, and Yin and Yang correspond, it is called the Way. Solitary Yin or scanty Yang, Yin and Yang each partial, is not called the Way. Therefore the sage Xuan deleted the poems and took the "Guan Ju" chapter as the foremost, to show the Way of the gentleman, beginning with husband and wife. The way of husband and wife is the way of Yin and Yang creation. All things in Heaven and Earth, sentient and insentient, those female are all Yin, being female or wives; those male are all Yang, being male or husbands. One female and one male, one feminine and one masculine, one wife and one husband, one Yin and one Yang, mutually require each other, and thus there is creation. In man, man and woman dwell together and beget; in things, tortoise and serpent entwined conceive their kind. Taking these two, the principle of female and male mutually requiring each other, feminine and masculine uniting, can be analogically inferred. Suppose two females dwell in one chamber, both exceedingly fair, and are married; how can they truly know each other and beget? This principle is clear and easy to see. The blind men who cultivate the Way in the world know not the principle of Yin and Yang union, the way of female and male mutual requirement, forsaking their own true Yin and true Yang nature-life root, and seek from outside themselves things of other kinds. Some flow into gathering and fighting, some err in thinking furnace and fire; some set up altars and worship the Dipper and court the True; some fast and pray to the shades, hoping to prolong life and avoid death. Yet it is like patching a pot with glue or applying clay to a sore. It is like flying tortoise and dancing serpent—can it not be more discordant? The Immortal Elder in this section first mentions "Guan Ju," tortoise and serpent, the principle of female and male mutual requirement, then points out the error of different kinds, enlightening later students; it may be called utmost compassion. All blind men can thereby understand.  

The highest virtue is non-action, not seeking by examination. The lower virtue acts, its use never ceases. To know the white and keep the black, the spirit and brightness come of themselves. White is the essence of metal, black the basis of water. Water is the pivot of the Way, removing number and name to one. The beginning of Yin and Yang, mysterious and containing the yellow sprout. The lord of the five metals, the northern River Chariot. Therefore lead is black outside and white within, containing the golden splendour; robed in coarse clothes yet holding jade, outside a madman. Metal is the mother of water, mother hidden in the child embryo. Water is the child of metal, the child conceals the mother's womb. The perfect man is most subtle, seeming to be, seeming not to be. Like the great abyss, sometimes sinking, sometimes floating. Retiring and distributing, each guards its own corner. The white of gathering is first born into the void chamber; the red of making is then used to burn the metal. Refined as the external guard, the true abode is within the white. Square and round, a inch in diameter, mixed and mutually bound. Born before Heaven and Earth, lofty and venerable. Beside it are walls and towers, resembling the Penghu Isle. Circling and closing, four ways hesitant. Guarding tightly and firmly, blocking off treachery and evil. The curved pavilions communicate, to guard against the unexpected. One may be without thought, but not without worry or toil. The spirit and vital breath fill the chamber, none can detain them. Those who guard prosper, those who lose perish. Movement, stillness, rest—always together with man.  

Golden splendour: originally yellow splendour. Mutually bound: originally mutually supporting. Curved pavilions: originally curved pavilions.  

The previous section said that to cultivate the Way one must seek things of the same kind to accomplish the matter. If not of the same kind, there is no success. But cultivation has two methods: one to perfect the Way and all its matters; one to extend life by technique. The highest virtue completes the form by the Way, embraces the origin and guards the unity, practicing the Way of non-action, and so can finish the matter. Hence it is said, "The highest virtue is non-action, not seeking by examination." The lower virtue extends life by technique, by endeavouring and calming, practicing the Way of action, and thus can return to the origin. Hence it is said, "The lower virtue acts, its use never ceases." That the highest virtue does not seek by examination is because such a person’s true nature is uninjured, the guest breath does not enter. If one suddenly awakens to the original nature, without cultivation or attainment, transcending that shore, the work of examination and seeking is of no use. The lower virtue never ceases to act because the original nature is impaired, knowledge is opened; though one can suddenly awaken to the original nature, one cannot at once subdue and follow it, so one must use the gradual path of cultivation and the work of increase and decrease. Increase and again increase, decrease and again decrease, until there is nothing more to increase or decrease. When righteousness is refined and benevolence mature, then one enters the place of rest; this is the precious source of the use which never ceases. The highest and lower virtue differ in rank; therefore their uses differ. If the lower virtue reaches the point where righteousness is refined and benevolence mature, then it also returns to the same path as the highest virtue. The so-called sometimes at ease and acting, sometimes useful and acting, sometimes forced and acting, is the attainment of success. To clarify the point of the lower virtue’s use never ceasing: the use never ceasing is the way of returning from the afterborn to the innate. Returning from the afterborn to the innate is to know the white and guard the black. White is the pure and clear mind of the Way; black is the obscure human mind. To know the white is for the mind of the Way to be real; to guard the black is for the human mind to be void. When the mind of the Way is real, true knowledge constantly remains; when the human mind is void, spiritual knowledge is correct. True knowledge and spiritual knowledge are both united as one, firmness and softness correspond. Within is a faint image, in the dark is essence, and spirit and brightness come of themselves. Spirit and brightness are the innate true one breath, also called the innate true one essence, also called the valley spirit. The valley spirit is the spirit of the mixture of Yin and Yang breaths. When Yin and Yang are dispersed, this spirit is obscure, its body black and losing brightness, as if spirit and brightness had departed. When Yin and Yang correspond, this spirit is clear, its body white and regains brightness, as if spirit and brightness had come. Therefore it is said, "To know the white and keep the black, spirit and brightness come of themselves." What is meant by white being the essence of metal, black the basis of water? The true knowledge which the mind of the Way possesses is true feeling, its virtue originally firm and strong, being the thing of the Heaven trigram, symbolized by the essence of metal. The spiritual knowledge which the human mind contains is true nature, its virtue originally gentle and soft, being the thing of the Earth trigram, symbolized by the basis of water. Spiritual knowledge originally does not belong to water but to fire; because spiritual knowledge is contained in the human mind, if it can guard the blackness of the human mind, then the human mind is extremely void, tranquil, and steadfast. Spiritual knowledge is gentle and soft, the evil fire is extinguished, and it connects with true knowledge in vague obscurity; in the dimness there is transformation, and harmonious qi steams forth, producing the true one water, and this black is the basis of water. Water is born of Heaven One, the pivot of the Way, lord of the five metals, the root of Yin and Yang, containing the yellow sprout within, having the proper breath of the northern River Chariot. How is this known? The spiritual knowledge of the human mind is void and tranquil, guest breath does not come; the true knowledge of the mind of the Way is revealed, the vital breath returns again; like grass and trees sprouting in the earth, its colour yellow and tender, its substance pure water; therefore called the yellow sprout. Because its Yang qi rises by water, it is also called River Chariot; because its Yang qi is born from Yin, it is also called spirit and brightness; in truth the yellow sprout, River Chariot, and spirit and brightness are all images of the true knowledge of the mind of the Way, a point of firm and upright breath. To compare: black lead, black outside white inside, holding golden splendour within; like one robed in coarse clothes but holding jade, outside a madman. Man from the innate joins with the afterborn; wild feelings give rise to desire water, metal is the mother of water. Returning from the afterborn to the innate, black contains white, the essence-one water again produces the true feeling of true knowledge, and the mother is hidden in the child embryo; this water again produces metal. The essence-one water borrows true feeling to be born; water is the child of metal, the afterborn operates the true feeling of innate metal, producing essence-one water; the child again contains the mother's womb; metal again produces water. Metal producing water is following its desire, to allure the other's joy, afterborn obeys Heaven's time. Water producing metal is reversing its mechanism, to confirm my precious life, innate and heaven obstruct not. Metal and water mutually produce, following and reversing both used without harm to each other; the perfect man is born amid them. The perfect man is what above is called spirit and brightness, also called the sacred embryo, being the innate void true one breath condensed to form an image. This perfect man is most divine and subtle, neither form nor emptiness, both form and emptiness. Sometimes sinking, silently unmoving; sometimes floating, sensing and thus communicating. Form and emptiness not held fast, motion and stillness natural; utmost void yet containing utmost being, utmost emptiness yet containing utmost reality; the breaths of Yin and Yang and the five elements, all are complete. Therefore it is said to retire and distribute, each guarding its own corner. When the sacred embryo condenses, the perfect man has form; five origins and five virtues, mixed as one breath; five things and five thieves, each guarding its own corner. Not only do they not harm the Way, but they assist the Way. The white of gathering is at the first the void chamber producing white, the sacred embryo condensing. The red of making is then used to refine metal, the sacred embryo is firm. Refined into the external guard, the external elixir is completed. The true abode within the white, the internal elixir is clear. Square and round, an inch in diameter, outside round and inside square, yet inside and outside one breath. Mixed and mutually bound, spirit condenses and qi gathers; spirit and qi mix, inside and outside as one. Spirit and qi mixed, one subtle spirit, the law realm open and unobstructed. Born before Heaven and Earth, lofty and venerable; creation cannot bind it, all things cannot bend it; entering true emptiness without obstruction, the harmonious one middle realm; therefore it is said to resemble Penghu Isle. At this place, perfectly round and shining brightly, good knowledge and good power, again reveals the original face at birth. Having secured the origin, one must guard against dangers and perils, firmly crossing and sealing, called beside it the walls and towers. Circling and closing, four ways hesitant, to guard against external calamities, that no external things enter. Guarding tightly and firmly, blocking off treachery and evil, to remove internal thieves, the inner thoughts do not come out. The curved pavilions communicate, to guard against the unexpected, careful about what is unseen, fearful of what is unheard. Nothing hidden is not illuminated, nothing minute is not entered; like the curved pavilions communicating, dark and light are one, not allowing the slightest evil breath to remain in the heart. One may be without thought, but not without worry or toil; use use amid non-use, exert effort in non-effort, not with sorrow or toil forcing it. Only without thought and non-action, essence-one holding to the middle. The above admonitory words are to warn the learner to be cautious at the critical time, not allowing the slightest slackness, lest one bring calamity upon oneself. For the sacred embryo condenses and spirit and breath are sufficient, Yang at its utmost must be Yin, easily producing calamity. Guard it, then the ten months the embryo is complete, elixir hot and flourishing; lose it, then in a moment the breath withdraws and the spirit flies and is lost. Therefore the sage here lets the fire stop the wheel. Using the way of the Yin talisman, firmness with softness aids; one movement one stillness, one rest one breath, always together with the Way. Abandoning action and entering non-action, having completed life then completing nature, the final work is in the living body below. This is the work of the lower virtue, its use never ceasing; by exertion returning to the way of nature; when one attains nature of itself, then with the highest virtue it is the same matter. The above speaks of the principle of life; below speaks of the principle of nature; the learner should take heed.  

Within, to nourish oneself, be calm, quiet, void. Preserve the origin hidden and bright, inwardly illuminating the form body. Close and block its Dui, build firm the spirit root. The three lights sink, warming and nourishing the seed pearl; look upon it and you see it not, near and easy to seek. Diligent and acting on it, day and night without rest. Conceal food for three years, lightly move and travel far. Cross fire and not be scorched, enter water and not be wet. Able to preserve and able to let go, long joy and without care. The Way is complete, virtue accomplished, latent waiting the time. Tai Yi then summons, removes to the central isles. When功 is full, ascends above, receives the tally and obtains the chart.  

The way of cultivating Reality requires nature and life both to be cultivated, and the work must be in two stages. The external medicine is to complete life, the internal medicine is to complete nature. External medicine seizes creation from without, to restore the innate; internal medicine preserves the original truth within, to transform the afterborn. The innate is for escaping the illusory body; the afterborn is for escaping the dharma body. Men of the world are confused and do not know the marvelous meaning of the words set forth by sages; they mistake external medicine for furnace fire, internal medicine for solitary cultivation. They do not know that innate true Yang comes from void and non-being, belonging to that which is outside; therefore called external medicine. When the innate comes and returns to root and life, it belongs to me; therefore called internal medicine. The distinction between inside and outside, the boundary of nature and life, both arise together but have different names, both called origin of the origin. The beginning of this section raises "within to nourish oneself," so the principle of inside and outside is clear. This accords exactly with the beginning of the scripture, "When one is about to nourish nature, one must first prolong life and delay the appointed time." Oneself means nature. When the Golden Elixir is accomplished, the foundation of life firmly established, one urgently cultivates nature to escape the dharma body. The way of cultivating nature is to refine spirit and return to void. Hence this section directly points forth: "Within to nourish oneself, be calm, quiet, void." The way of nourishing nature requires one to settle oneself in emptiness, quiet the heart in non-being, to forget body and mind both, aiming certainly to reach the subtlety of body and spirit united with the true Way. Preserve the origin hidden and bright, inwardly illuminating the form body, means to veil brightness and nurture obscurity, truly holding to the middle. Close and block its Dui, build firm the spirit root, means to cherish breath and nourish spirit, concentrating essence and unity. The three lights sink, warming and nourishing the seed root, means essence, breath, and spirit, the three treasures and quintessence, all gathered within, guarding the Elixir field, not leaving it for a moment. The original root, spirit root, seed pearl are all other names for the sacred embryo. The sacred embryo has breath but no substance; hence it is said, "Look upon it and you see it not." Though unseen, it is near to my body, close in the heart-chest. What men do not know, but oneself alone knows, one must continuously keep as if present, not forget, not assist, working diligently and without rest, day and night. When the ten months elixir is ripened and all Yin is stripped away, then comes the time of emancipation; a body outside the body. Further performs three years of suckling work, restrains breath to strengthen spirit, nourishes season to firm form, then coming and going is free, lightly moving and travelling far, crossing fire not scorched, entering water not wet, gathering forms and remains, dispersing transforms and vanishes. Without disaster or difficulty, long joy and without care. At this place, the Way is achieved and virtue completed. Tai Yi then summons, removes to the central isles, the blessed land and grotto, sharing Heaven's blessings with the multitude of perfected ones. Then returning to the world, accumulating功 and accumulating行, when three thousand功 are full and eight hundred行 completed, the Jade Emperor issues the decree, the Purple Palace receives the office, the great man's work is finished.
