# The Commentary on the Treatise of the Unity of the Three

The Treatise of the Unity of the Three is a work of few words but great in the Way; its language is subtle, yet its purport profound. It enumerates the Five Emperors as founders of the established order, and associates the Three Sovereigns with the establishment of government. Yet if the distinctions between ruler and minister be wide, and there be no standard between high and low, the sequence of government will not attain to perfect peace. The method of Fushi is laid down, yet it cannot achieve longevity. The learning that nourishes the nature does not prolong the years. When it comes to the analysis of Yin and Yang, the adjustment of their minutest weights, the phases of the sun and moon in their cycles, the formation of the trigrams into images, the transformations wrought by male and female, the interplay of firmness and softness, motion and rest, the dividing of rice and salt, all are confirmed by the Book of Changes. The intention is strong, and therefore this commentary is made to transmit it to later worthies. Only he who comprehends the great image can surely attain longevity. To strengthen oneself and increase the body, those who pursue this Way should give special heed thereto.
