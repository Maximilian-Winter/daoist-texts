# The Discourse on Symbolic Speech

The study of cultivating the true (nature) in the ancient classics often speaks much of the way of non-action, but rarely mentions the way of action. Yet the way of non-action is apprehended only by the highest sages who suddenly comprehend its full and perfect mastery; with one understanding, they grasp a hundred matters, and immediately ascend into the realm of the holy. But those of middling or inferior nature, dull and heavy of root and dust, with narrow perception and insight, if they follow the way of non-action, their strength is insufficient; they cannot utterly empty themselves of all conditions, and so cannot directly cross to the other shore.

In the Later Han, Master Wei Boyang, the immortal elder, took the Dao of the Changes and composed the "Can Tong Qi" (Kinship of the Three), guiding those of middling and inferior rank by means of forms to illustrate formlessness, and by means of shape to allegorize the shapeless. Thus the names of the Golden Elixir arose, along with lead and mercury, sand and silver, black hare, dragon and tiger, infantile beauty, medicines, furnace and cauldron, cooking and refining, and so on — all the symbolic methods of alchemy. Since then, all those who have attained the Way have taken the Can Tong as their ancestor and composed elixir scriptures to expound its wondrous principles; their intent has always been to aid later scholars, so that they may refer to it, and borrow from it in order to confirm this.

Yet the later scholars, not investigating the meaning of the allegories, nor seeking the principle of the symbols, on seeing mention of the Golden Elixir, lead and mercury, furnace and cauldron, suspect these to be substances to be ingested, and so fall into the fire of the furnace; on seeing the black hare and dragon and tiger, suspect these to be internal organs, and so fall into the imaginings; on seeing the sayings of this family and that family, yin and yang, male and female, suspect these to be the inner elixir, and so fall into the taking and gathering; on seeing the discourse of opposition and reversal, suspect these to be forced operations, and so fall into the turning of the rotations; on seeing the teaching of cultivating nature through non-action, suspect this to be annihilation, and so fall into obstinate emptiness; on seeing the teaching of cultivating destiny through action, suspect this to be mere manipulation, and so fall into attachment to appearances. All such sects are like calling a deer a horse, or a bird a phoenix; not only are they without benefit to nature and life, but they harm nature and life. Is this the meaning of the ancient masters when they took symbols to illustrate their words?

Now a symbol is a likeness — it speaks of this thing and resembles that thing, that matter and resembles this matter. Let us take for example matters which all men at present see and know in common. Consider cooking food and drink: the pot is the cauldron; the stove is the furnace; the water stored in the pot, the fire burning beneath the stove; the fire is originally an upward flame, the water is originally a downward flow; now the water in the pot is above, the fire beneath the stove is below — water and fire are reversed, mutually assisting each other, and thus food and drink are cooked. This is the common symbol of water and fire mutually aiding.

Man’s hard nature is impatient and restless, and when moving it belongs to fire; the soft nature is slow and quiet, and when at rest it belongs to water. To use softness to nourish hardness, and hardness to attain softness, hardness and softness mutually balanced, neither restless nor slack, returning to the mean and the upright — the great Way is thus easily accomplished. This is the principle of the divine water and divine fire mutually aiding. Taking the symbol of common water and common fire mutually aiding, the principle of the divine water and divine fire mutually aiding is thereby shown clearly.

Again, if a man’s family estate is originally abundant, but he does not keep within his proper bounds and spends away his wealth until it is nearly exhausted, and then suddenly knows himself, repents, and with bitter mind and diligent labour lays himself to business and life, gradually accumulating wealth, the property increasing from little to much, in the end his family estate is restored. This is the symbol of returning to the origin and restoring the root. The human body’s spirit and vital energy are originally full and perfect; when committed to the acquired (afterborn), following its creation and transformation, exhausting essence and wearing out spirit, the primordial energy declines and the original basis is consumed to depletion. If one knows to change one’s face and renew one’s mind, to restrain anger and obstruct desire, to reject evil and maintain sincerity, and gradually apply effort, there will in the end be a time of returning to the root and restoring the destiny. This is the principle of returning to the origin and restoring the root. Taking the symbol of men of the world returning to the origin and restoring the root, the principle of the Way of cultivation returning to the origin and restoring the root is thereby shown clearly.

Again, in the world men and women come together in match; two become one, and they can give birth to sons and grandsons. This is the symbol of the human way of ceaseless generation. The human body’s yin and yang are balanced, two becoming one, and they can give birth to immortals and Buddhas. This is the principle of the elixir way of ceaseless generation. Borrowing the symbol of human generation, the principle of the elixir way of generation is thereby shown clearly.

The elixir scriptures all borrow symbols to illustrate principles, teaching men to distinguish the principles by means of the symbols, not teaching men to forsake the principles and proceed to fabricate in the symbols.

Now men do not fathom the principles, but only regard the symbols; how lamentable! The elixir scriptures have very many symbolic speeches; the student should proceed from the symbols to exhaust the principles, so as to obtain the symbol and forget the words, obtain the meaning and forget the symbol — this is what may be hoped for.
