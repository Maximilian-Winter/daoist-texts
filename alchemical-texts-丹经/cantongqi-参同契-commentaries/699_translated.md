# Discourse on the Fire and Its Seasoning

What the Danjing and Zishu speak of as fire and its seasoning is but a metaphor for the principles governing the order of cultivation and practice. For the power of cultivation has its precedence and sequence, its urgency and leisure, its advance and retreat at proper times. It is not fitting that what should come first come after, nor that what should come after come first; nor that what should be urgent be delayed, nor that what should be delayed be urgent; nor that what should advance retreat, nor that what should retreat advance. Just as the fire in the furnace burns the medicine, there are times for the martial and civil arts to advance, retreat, halt, and suffice. Therefore, the order of application in the cultivation of the True is taken as the image of fire's seasoning. Yet, the application of effort in its seasoning is not bound by year, month, day, or hour. At every moment, it is to be practised, advancing when it should advance, retreating when it should retreat, urging when it should urge, moderating when it should moderate, pressing forward when it should press forward, withdrawing when it should withdraw, adapting to the times with flexibility, not allowing the slightest error.

That which should come first is the rigor within; that which should come after is the defense without; that which should be urgent is the earnestness in exertion; that which should be moderate is the gentle nurturing; that which should advance is when Yang is insufficient and must be increased; that which should retreat is when Yin is just arising and must be withdrawn. This is the true principle of fire's season, and not the saying of the alchemist that at the hour of the Rat one advances Yang fire, at the hour of the Horse one withdraws Yin charm, and at the hours of the Rabbit and Rooster one should bathe; nor that at the Winter Solstice one advances Yang fire, at the Summer Solstice advances (or rather withdraws) Yin charm, and at the Spring and Autumn Equinoxes one should bathe. Heaven has its Rat, Horse, Rabbit, and Rooster; man has his Rat, Horse, Rabbit, and Rooster. Can man’s Rat, Horse, Rabbit, and Rooster be the same as Heaven’s Rat, Horse, Rabbit, and Rooster? The Rat, Horse, Rabbit, and Rooster of the human body exist in every moment. The ancient classics say: 'There is no need to seek the Rat and Horse at the edge of Heaven; within the body there is a Yang born.' For Yang born is the Rat; Yin born is the Horse; the union of Yang and Yin is the Rabbit; the union of Yin and Yang is the Rooster. This is called the living Rat, Horse, Rabbit, and Rooster, not the dead Rat, Horse, Rabbit, and Rooster at the edge of Heaven. The Four Hundred Characters of the Golden Elixir say: 'The fire’s season requires not the hour; the Winter Solstice is not at the Rat; and as for the bathing method, the Rabbit and Rooster are only empty comparisons.' The Treatise on Awakening the True says: 'Though one know cinnabar and black lead, one knows not the fire’s season; in general, all depends on the power of cultivation; a hair’s breadth of difference and the Elixir is not formed.' They say the Winter Solstice is not at the Rat; they say the Rabbit and Rooster are empty comparisons; they say that a hair’s breadth of difference prevents the formation of the Elixir — thus it is clear that the Rat, Horse, Rabbit, and Rooster at the edge of Heaven are not meant. If it were so, then in the twelve hours only four are for cultivation, and the remaining eight are abandoned and unused; how could there be no error even to a hair’s breadth? The Mirror of Medicine says: 'In one day, the twelve hours, wherever the mind reaches, all may be made use of.' It is evident that year, month, day, and hour, every moment, are to be employed in cultivation and practice, guarding against danger and calamity, allowing not the slightest difference. As for the sixty-four hexagrams’ fire seasons, these also indicate the methods of Yin and Yang’s advance and retreat, teaching men to add and diminish according to the time and to use their efforts with flexibility, not instructing men to proceed according to the order of the sixty-four hexagrams. The Treatise on Awakening the True says: 'The images set forth in the hexagrams are the original forms; when the image is attained, forget the words, and the meaning is clear. The confused world grasps only the image, but acts in accord with the hexagrams’ breath, hoping to ascend. In reading the book, one must understand the ancients’ intention in choosing images and framing words; when the meaning is obtained, the image may be forgotten.'

The Way of cultivating the True, in thousands of scriptures and countless treatises, is all metaphorical speech. Though the images chosen may not be the same, they all serve to expound Yin and Yang’s sequence, the true and false of medicines, and the principles of fire’s season; beyond these there is no other teaching. I, having obtained instruction from the Master, truly comprehend the meaning within the images, and dare not be selfish; I wish to present to the discerning friends the essential points of the Alchemical Scriptures, to illustrate truly, to analyse right and wrong, to dispel the doubts of learners, and the rest may be inferred accordingly.

### The Countenance in the Womb

Before man is born of his parents, when the Yin and Yang of male and female mingle and respond, in the profound depths there is a point of vital energy coming forth from the void — this is what is called the Ancestral Breath of the True One of the Pre-Heaven. This energy enters into the essence and blood, fusing essence and blood into one; formless it becomes form; without substance it becomes substance; within are the five viscera and six bowels; without are the five senses and hundred bones. It changes and transforms naturally and completes itself. Even the mother who bears the child knows not the reason for this. The later learners not understanding this principle doubt that as the fetus is in the womb, the umbilical cord connects to the mother’s breath, and the mother breathes and so breathes the child, gradually changing into form. This is not so. The breath of inhaling and exhaling is the post-Heaven Qi. How can the post-Heaven Qi change essence and blood into form? Moreover, how can the breath enter the fetus within the womb? What is little known is that within the mother’s womb there is only the Pre-Heaven One-Point Ancestral Breath, indistinct and confused. At first it condenses the fetus; thereafter it nourishes the fetus; and finally it completes the fetus. Beginning and end are all accomplished by this Ancestral Breath, without mixture. At this time, though there is human form, there is not the human Way; heaven and earth, all things, water, fire, weapons, cannot harm it; the seven emotions, six desires, five thieves, and four appearances cannot approach. To reach the real state, it is but emptiness. Ancient Immortals teach men to cultivate the Way by returning to the countenance before birth, before the parents formed the body — that is, to return to the state of emptiness, without sound or smell. Without sound or smell is the Unlimited; the Unlimited is the limitlessness of nothingness, that is, the state of non-being.

### The Infantile Countenance

When man is in the mother’s womb, after ten months the fetus is complete, the fruit ripened, the stalk loosened; breaking the membrane it comes forth, feet towards Heaven, head towards Earth, with a cry of 'wa!' Then it receives the post-Heaven Qi, which enters by the mouth and nose, descends into the Qi Sea, and unites with the Pre-Heaven Original Qi. The Pre-Heaven is the body; the post-Heaven is the function. The post-Heaven borrows the Pre-Heaven in respiration, and the Pre-Heaven borrows the post-Heaven in sustaining the blood vessels. Not only this: at the cry of 'wa!' the karmic consciousness of transmigration also enters the orifices, blending with the Pre-Heaven Original Spirit into one. The Original Spirit borrows the conscious spirit for existence, the conscious spirit borrows the Original Spirit for spirituality. Yet being newly born, though there is post-Heaven Qi and post-Heaven Spirit, the Pre-Heaven governs the post-Heaven, the post-Heaven follows the Pre-Heaven; the two blend, confused and turbid, without thought or knowledge, one True only. Ancient Immortals teach men to grasp the place of birth, that is, to grasp the infantile countenance. The ignorant say that the place of birth is the mother’s birth passage; this is incorrect. The beginning of birth, the infantile countenance, is pure and unblemished, the embryo of sages and worthies, the root bud of Immortals and Buddhas. Hence birds do not peck it, tigers and rhinoceroses do not injure it. The reason it is not harmed is because it is without mind. Without mind, life and death do not hinder it; what calamity or trouble can there be? This is the image of the utmost beginning. The utmost beginning is the extremity of the beginning, unmingled with the post-Heaven. Though mingled with post-Heaven, it is purely Pre-Heaven managing affairs, because it is at the utmost beginning, beginning from nothingness.

### The Child’s Countenance

Man, from infant gradually grows, able to walk and run, able to speak and understand, following men’s guidance; this is called the child, also called the juvenile. The infant has no knowledge or understanding; the child has knowledge and understanding, no longer a floating cloud in empty space. Having knowledge and understanding is the progress from the utmost beginning to the Great Ultimate. The Great Ultimate is the greatest extremity of greatness; the greatest extreme must have the least; when Yang reaches its extreme, Yin arises. But the least is not yet born, Yin has not yet arisen. The least not born, Yin not arisen, is still Pre-Heaven in operation, post-Heaven latent. Though there is knowledge and understanding, the root-dust is not yet aroused, the guest Qi has not yet intruded; one drinks only milk, clothes oneself only against cold; joy, anger, sorrow, and delight arise and vanish as they please; wealth and poverty, success and failure, are unknown and unperceived; one follows nature without extraneous thought. This too is the embryo of sages and worthies, the root bud of Immortals and Buddhas. The foolish do not know and take the child to be the infant; it is not so. The infant is the red child; the child is a youth. Though both possess innocence, their status is not the same; knowledge differs. Hence the ancient Immortals all teach a return to the origin and the source as the infant’s original countenance, and not the childish countenance of the juvenile.

### The Discrimination of Yin and Yang

As man grows from child, at sixteen years of age Qi is full; Yang reaches its extreme and Yin is born; day by day it pierces one orifice; Yin and Yang separate, each occupying one side; within the true there is false; knowledge gradually opens; good and evil are distinguished; this is the Great Ultimate distinguished and Yin and Yang divided. The so-called sixteen years is like the Moon’s first and last quarter; the two quarters united form the image of full brightness and roundness. It signifies the Pre-Heaven Yang’s extremity, like the Great Ultimate; Yang at its extreme must have Yin, like the Great Ultimate divided, and Yin and Yang separated. The ignorant, not understanding this account of sixteen years and the birth of Yin, suspect that the young man at sixteen has lost essence by emission. This is not so. Observe the world’s young men — some at fourteen or fifteen emit essence, some at sixteen or seventeen, some at eighteen or nineteen; the years and amount of essence differ. It may be known that the number sixteen, sixteen years, has no relation to man’s age, but rather refers to the fullness and completion of Qi.

### The Positioning of the Five Elements

When Yin and Yang divide, the Five Elements also become scattered. The Five Elements are the five Qi of Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth. In Pre-Heaven, Earth begets Metal, Metal begets Water, Water begets Wood, Wood begets Fire, Fire begets Earth; the Five Elements are one Qi, manifesting as the five virtues of Benevolence, Righteousness, Propriety, Wisdom, and Faith. In Post-Heaven, Earth overcomes Water, Water overcomes Fire, Fire overcomes Metal, Metal overcomes Wood, Wood overcomes Earth; the Five Elements injure one another, manifesting as the five thieves of joy, anger, sorrow, fear, and desire. When the Five Elements are united, the five virtues are complete and Yin and Yang are mixed as one; when the Five Elements are scattered, the five thieves arise and Yin and Yang are discordant. When the Five Elements divide, the conscious spirit gradually arises, the root-dust gradually emerges, the true retreats, the false takes power; the child’s countenance is lost. The ignorant do not know, and suppose the five viscera to be the Five Elements; this is not so. The five viscera are material and turbid substances, the lodging place of the Post-Heaven Five Elements, not the garden of virtue of the Pre-Heaven Five Elements. If the five viscera were the Five Elements, how could they divide or unite? Moreover, the Five Elements have Pre-Heaven and Post-Heaven distinctions; Pre-Heaven precedes birth, Post-Heaven follows birth; Pre-Heaven gives birth to sagehood, Post-Heaven gives birth to manhood. Though two sets of Five Elements are distinguished as prior and subsequent, both are living; they are not fixed in position. How can the turbid substances of the five viscera be the Five Elements?

### The Post-Heaven in Operation

Yin and Yang divided, Five Elements scattered; when Post-Heaven mingles, Pre-Heaven retires; thus one receives the nature given by Qi and temperament, and the external habits and dust arise. The six gates of the senses, gate by gate, invite thieves; the seven emotions sow seeds of sin, each generating calamity. The once pure white body gradually admits Yin Qi within. When Yin Qi enters, it grows, while Yang Qi diminishes; it grows longer and longer, it disappears more and more; following its desires, it reaches everywhere. The ignorant do not know, and suppose that the nature of Qi and temperament is the true nature; this is not so. The true nature is the nature of Heaven’s decree, belonging to Pre-Heaven, beneficial to man; the nature of Qi and temperament is man’s nature, arising from Post-Heaven, harmful to man. How can Post-Heaven nature be the same as Pre-Heaven nature?

### Pure Yin Without Yang

Post-Heaven in operation, Yin advances and Yang retreats, day after day, year after year; within, myriad desires bring ruin; without, myriad things draw one; attacked within and without, Yang Qi is exhausted; the body is pure Yin; the three treasures are wasted; the soul and spirit are difficult to preserve. How can one not die? The ignorant do not know, and resign their fate to Heaven, supposing it to be so. But man’s dependence is on Yang Qi. One point of Yang Qi, not exhausted, one does not die; one point of Yin Qi, not pure, one does not die. To follow Yin Qi and exhaust Yang Qi is to seek death; what concern is it of Heaven? The above seven diagrams all follow the course of creation, the Way of giving birth to man.

### Refining the Self and Establishing the Foundation

The Way of cultivating the True is the Way of returning. To return is that which has gone away yet returns; to restore is that which Yang has lost and again obtains. This is within pure Yin, returning to its original true Yang. Man, from the time Post-Heaven is in operation, is pure Yin throughout the body; Pre-Heaven Yang Qi is consumed utterly. Without the power of return, how can that which is not have become, that which is lost be again gained? The power of return begins with refining the self and establishing the foundation. To refine the self is to refine the root-dust of karmic transmigration, the temperament and partial nature, and all the habitations of foreign Qi; this is the work of restraining anger and obstructing desire, of conquering self and restoring propriety. If one can restrain anger and obstruct desire, conquer self and restore propriety, then there is no thought or care, no movement or wavering; the foundation is firm. Just as in building a house one must first establish the foundation, and the foundation firm, wood and brick made by man can bear all. Refining the self is within establishing the foundation; establishing the foundation is not apart from refining the self. The ignorant do not know, supposing refining the self to be guarding the mind, and establishing the foundation to be closing the essence; this is not so. The work of refining the self is the essential point of the Way of the Elixir from beginning to end, up to the time when Yin is exhausted and Yang is pure; then the work of refining the self is complete. If before the time of Yin’s exhaustion and Yang’s purity, the refining of self must not cease. If one says guarding the mind and closing the essence is refining the self and establishing the foundation, can this complete the great matter of the Golden Elixir? The ancient Immortals say: 'Returning the Elixir is in one moment; refining the self requires ten months.' From this it is clear it is not guarding the mind and closing the essence.

### The True Heart of Heavenly Goodness

Refining the self and establishing the foundation is not forcing or striving, not labouring painfully; it is necessary to recognize the True Heart of Heavenly Goodness, borrowing this True Heart to refine the self. Then in the darkness there appears a ray of Yang light, called the True Spirit. When the True Spirit appears, right and wrong, true and false, are clearly distinguished; one is not dragged by desires, nor sullied by worldly ties; refining the self is very easy. If one cannot recognize the True Heart, then good and evil cannot be separated, right and wrong confused; thus mind controlling mind is still the human mind acting; forcing and striving. The saying 'removing delusions only adds sickness, approaching true thus is also error' is apt. How can one reach the place of no-self? The ignorant do not know, mistaking the human mind for the True Heart; this is not so. The True Heart has no mind; the mind without mind is the Heavenly Good Heart. Having this Heavenly Good Heart, what difficulty is there in conquering the self? The Hundred-Character Stele says: 'In motion and rest, know the ancestor and master; when there is no matter, whom seek further?' The Yellow Crane Ode says: 'Within the seven sorts of cinnabar, without the true seed, moment by moment it is hard to maintain.' Sanfeng says: 'In establishing the foundation, one must use the bladder and bellows; in refining the self, one must yet have the true lead.' The true seed of the ancestors, the bladder and bellows, the true lead, are all other names of the Heavenly Good Heart. Alas! The Heavenly Good Heart, how easy is it to know? If one knows it, one obtains the one, and all affairs are complete.

### Yang Grows and Yin Diminishes

Recognizing the Heavenly Good Heart, the master sits steadily in the centre; the Way lessens daily, the work increases daily; Yang Qi gradually grows, Yin Qi gradually diminishes; growing and growing, diminishing and diminishing, until there is nowhere else to grow or diminish, this is the utmost work. The ignorant do not know, supposing that sitting in stillness and non-action, in silence and emptiness, that Yang Qi grows by itself and Yin Qi diminishes by itself; this is not so. Returning the Elixir is restoring Yang within Yin. If one relies on sitting still in non-action, in silence and emptiness, to restore Yang, how can Yang come of itself? How can Yin retire of itself? The Treatise on Awakening the True says: 'Though one know cinnabar and black lead, one knows not the fire’s season; in general, all depends on the power of cultivation; a hair’s breadth of difference and the Elixir is not formed.' From this one may know the Way of advancing Yang and retreating Yin.

### The Clustering of the Five Elements

As Yang grows and Yin diminishes, one must know also the clustering of the Five Elements. When the Five Elements cluster, the Great Way may be hoped for. The work of clustering is to return from the Post-Heaven Five Elements to the Pre-Heaven Five Elements. The Post-Heaven Five Elements injure one another; the Pre-Heaven Five Elements generate one another. To return is, amid injury, to bring forth generation. The generation of the Five Elements is the natural principle; it is the unity of the Five Elements, the harmony of the Four Symbols. The ignorant do not know, supposing that by the mind guiding the Qi of the heart and kidney, joining above and below, moving the Qi of liver and lung, uniting left and right, one clusters the Five Elements; this is not so. The Qi of the five viscera are all material things, turbid substances of Post-Heaven; there is growth and decay; how can they condense into an imperishable treasure of life?

### The Mixture of Yin and Yang

The Five Elements arise from the division of Yin and Yang; the clustering of the Five Elements, united as one, is Yin and Yang mixed as one. Yin and Yang mingled, the Golden Elixir has form; it is still the child’s countenance, but only Post-Heaven Qi, not yet transformed away. Yet though not yet transformed away, Pre-Heaven returns, Post-Heaven follows; this does no harm. From here, a further stage of work ensues, and the Golden Elixir may be completed. The ignorant do not know, supposing that the joining of heart and kidney, the union of Ren and Du channels, or the union of male and female is Yin and Yang mixed; this is not so. The Golden Elixir is condensed from the Pre-Heaven void Qi; how can tangible Post-Heaven blood and flesh condense it?

### The Unified Qi

Yin and Yang return and blend, the child’s countenance is restored; from here one employs the natural true fire, burning away the residual Post-Heaven Yin, returning to the state of no knowledge and no awareness. Spirit is hidden, Qi gathered; this is called the man having conception. This conception is the infantile countenance, the place where the body receives Qi, the utmost beginning, the Great One containing the true Qi. The ignorant do not know, gathering cinnabar and plucking plum kernels, swallowing and eating to form the holy embryo; this is not so. If one says cinnabar and plum kernels can form the holy embryo, what is formed is only a clot of blood and a lump of flesh, a ghost fetus hastening death; what else can be hoped for?

### The Vast Void of the Great Space

The holy embryo condensed, added to ten months’ nurturing, applying the natural true fire, roasting, steaming, and refining, from subtle to full, from tender to firm; all Yin is stripped away, the fetus is perfect and the Elixir complete. The fruit ripens, the stalk loosens, suddenly breaking chaos, bursting forth the pure and clear Dharma body, leaping into the vast void of Great Space, transcending the three realms. This is the countenance before birth, that is, the countenance of the Unlimited. The Way returns to the Unlimited; form and spirit both are wondrous; joining the Way to the True — this is what the man of greatness accomplishes. The ignorant do not know, supposing that gazing into a mirror to manifest spirit, or silently contemplating the crown of the head, or facing a wall to forget form, or casting out Yin spirit, are the like; this is not so. The spirit that escapes the Golden Elixir’s transformation is the Yang Spirit; all the spirits produced by stillness are the Yin Spirit. The Yang Spirit lasts for myriad years, neither born nor dying; the Yin Spirit, unrefined by fire, departs the body and reenters it. The myriad gates and ten thousand portals, if not touched by the Way of the Golden Elixir, though able to let out and take in the Yin Spirit at will, knowing the past and foreseeing the future, cannot escape transmigration. After countless kalpas, it will all come to nothingness.

The above seven diagrams all proceed against creation’s course; this is the Way of cultivating Immortality.

Among the fourteen diagrams, the matters of following the course and reversing the course may be known generally. Below, I take out the essential metaphorical words, distinguish right and wrong, point out the true meaning, and thereby show the learner that such things may be apprehended in the mind.
