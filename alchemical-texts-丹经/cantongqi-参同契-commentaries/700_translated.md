# The Treatise on Symbolic Speech Concerning the Dispelling of Doubt, Volume the Lower

### The Golden Elixir

Gold is that which is firm, hard, lasting, and indestructible; the Elixir is that which is round, perfect, bright, pure, and without defect. The ancient immortals borrowed the name Golden Elixir, to signify the original nature of perfect brightness and true spirit. This nature in the Confucian school is called the Great Ultimate; in the Buddhist school, it is named Perfect Enlightenment; in the Daoist school, it is called the Golden Elixir. Though named differently in the three, in truth it is but one thing. Confucians cultivate it and become sages; Buddhists cultivate it and become Buddhas; Daoists cultivate it and become immortals. The saints of the three teachings all regard the original true nature as the root of the Way. The ignorant do not know, and sometimes employ the five metals and eight stones, smelting and refining to make a medicine called Golden Elixir — this is not so. The true nature lies in the great furnace of creation; it is refined by fire to maturity, enduring as long as heaven and earth, shining as brightly as sun and moon; how could ordinary worldly substances accomplish this?

### The Heart of Heaven and Earth

The chief point in cultivating the true is to recognize the Heart of Heaven and Earth. The Heart of Heaven and Earth is the True Mind of Goodness of Heaven, as spoken of before. This mind is vague, dim, and deep; it does not lightly manifest in phenomena; only when there is an empty chamber giving birth to whiteness, and in the darkness sudden brightness appears, does it begin to show its outline. Heaven belongs to Yang, Earth to Yin; the Heart of Heaven and Earth is that Yin does not separate from Yang, nor Yang from Yin; it is the mind of their union. When Yin and Yang unite, this mind is present; when Yin and Yang separate, it is absent. It is neither form nor emptiness; it is form and emptiness; neither existence nor non-existence; it is existence and non-existence. Form and emptiness are without hindrance; existence and non-existence do not stand; this is the subtle existence in true emptiness. To know this mind and to guard it without losing it is to have established the great root; the rest are matters of ease. The ignorant do not know, and all buzz about on their fleshy lumps of stubborn mind, sometimes considering the restless mind to be the Heart of Heaven and Earth, sometimes the tranquil mind, sometimes the mind fixed in the centre palace — all these are not so. The stubborn mind is the postnatal, selfish desire of the human heart; the restless mind is attached to being, the tranquil mind attached to non-being, the fixed mind attached to images. Such minds are as far removed from the Heart of Heaven and Earth as heaven is from earth. For the Heart of Heaven and Earth, motion and stillness are one; it is silent and unmoving, yet responsive and through-communicating; responsive and through-communicating, yet silent and unmoving — can this be called the stubborn mind of the fleshy lump?

### The Waning Moon Furnace

The waning moon is the crescent moon shaped like an upturned moth’s eyebrow. When the moon is at its darkest, it is succeeded by new brightness; this signifies that in the deepest stillness of man, suddenly the root of heaven appears, called the Dao Heart, resembling the image of the waning moon. The furnace is the vessel in which fire is moved; by reason of its Dao Heart’s yang brilliance, it can refine the yin qi of the body. Hence it is metaphorically called the furnace; in truth, the Dao Heart is the Heart of Heaven and Earth. Speaking of substance, it is the Heart of Heaven and Earth; speaking of function, it is the Dao Heart. One thing with two names. The ignorant do not know, some regard the horizontal bone beneath the elixir field as the waning moon furnace, or mistake the single curved stroke of the character for heart as the waning moon furnace, or follow military metaphors to take the female birth gate as the waning moon furnace — all are mistaken. The waning moon furnace is the radiance of the Dao Heart. Wherever this light shines, all evils are extinguished; it enables one to become sage, it enables one to become immortal. The Purple Yang Elder says: “Do not be encumbered by the elixir furnace and waste time; to refine the medicine you must seek the waning moon furnace.” He further says: “Within the waning moon furnace the jade pistil grows; in the cinnabar cauldron the mercury lies level; only after the fire’s power is harmonized can the yellow sprout grow gradually.” Thus may the meaning of the waning moon be understood.

### The Cinnabar Cauldron

Cinnabar is the colour of fire; because fire can refine and transform all things, removing the old and bringing forth the new, men use the cauldron as its emblem. Fire as a thing is most spiritual and most divine; there is nothing it does not transform. This signifies that the divine light shines everywhere and that nothing is accomplished without it. Yet there is the Original Spirit and the Conscious Spirit; the Conscious Spirit can ruin the Way, while the Original Spirit can complete the Way. The Conscious Spirit carries the dust of many kalpas; it borrows the Original Spirit’s radiance to produce delusion, yet does not abandon life and therefore does not cease. The great practice of cultivation requires governing the Conscious Spirit by the Original Spirit. When the Conscious Spirit does not arise, the evil fire is extinguished; when the evil fire is extinguished, the true fire arises; when the true fire arises, harmonious qi spreads, vitality never ceases, and the Great Way may be hoped for. The ignorant mistake the clear and lively Conscious Spirit for the Original Spirit — such is false. The Original Spirit is the spirit that is not spirit, most true in its spirituality, most spiritual in its truth; the clear and lively spirit is a spirit that is spirit, yet though spiritual, it is false; the spirituality in the false is the seed of reincarnation. The ancient immortals say: “The beginningless kalpas’ cycle of birth and death is called the Original Man by the ignorant.” The Origin of Birth and Death is the Conscious Spirit.

### The Gate of the Primal Yin

The Primal is Yang, firm, and active; the Yin is Yin, soft, and still. The Gate of Primal Yin is the orifice of Yin and Yang, the gate of firmness and softness, the pass of motion and stillness; it is without position or place, without form or image. It resembles a curved shell, an empty suspended orifice, in a place where the five elements do not reach, in the realm where the four great elements do not rest. It is utmost non-being containing utmost being, utmost emptiness containing utmost solidity; it is one orifice amidst the union of Yin and Yang. The ignorant mistake the mouth and nose for the Primal Yin; this is wrong. The mouth and nose are the gates of respiration, not the gates of Yin and Yang’s ingress and egress. The union of Yin and Yang births immortals and Buddhas; can the breath of mouth and nose produce immortals and Buddhas? The Awakening to the True says: “Few in the world know the Gate of Primal Yin; do not rashly assign mouth and nose to it.”

### The One Orifice of the Primal Pass

The Primal Pass is the supremely primal and wondrous pass; it is also named the Door of Life and Death, the Chamber of Life and Death, the Boundary of Heaven and Man, the Gate of Punishment and Virtue, the Orifice of Being and Non-Being, the Cavity of Spirit and Qi, the Place of Emptiness and Solidity, the Crossroads, and many other names; all are but ways to describe this one orifice. The Primal Pass is another name for the Gate of Primal Yin; because Yin and Yang are here, it is called the Gate of Primal Yin; because it is primal, wondrous, and unfathomable, it is called the Orifice of Primal Pass — in truth all these are but this one orifice. The ignorant do not know; some take the region below the heart above the kidneys as the Primal Pass, some the centre of the navel, some the tailbone, some the paired vertebrae on either side of the spine — all these are wrong. The Primal Pass has no fixed position; if it had a fixed position it would not be the Primal Pass. Chen Xubai says that the place where thought arises is the Primal Pass; this seems so but is not. The place where thought arises has already fallen into the postnatal realm of form; how can it be called the Primal Pass? Now I clearly point out to the multitude: in the midst of vagueness and dimness, where being and non-being mutually enter, the Awakening to the True says: “Amongst the vague and dim one seeks for form; within the darkness one seeks the true essence; being and non-being enter each other here; not yet seen, how can one imagine it formed?” The Four Hundred Characters further say: “This orifice is no common orifice; heaven and earth unite and form it; it is called the cavity of spirit and qi; within is the essence of Water and Fire.” This indeed refers to the one orifice of the Primal Pass.

### The Spirit of the Valley

The Spirit of the Valley is the spirit of the empty valley, commonly called the Cliff Child. Because the two mountains rise high, with a valley between, when one cries aloud the voice echoes in the valley, hence the name Spirit of the Valley. Cultivators borrow this to signify the spiritual spirit of the human body’s emptiness and subtlety. The heart is empty and thus spiritual; when not empty, not spiritual; spirit issues from emptiness, also called the Spirit of the Valley. Spirit is without form or image, spiritual and unfathomable. That which is still and unmoving, responsive and through-communicating, is this spirit; that which condenses the holy embryo is also this spirit. The ignorant mistake the spirit residing in the celestial valley for the Spirit of the Valley, or spirit guarding the Yellow Court for the Spirit of the Valley — all are mistaken. If the spirit dwells in the celestial valley or guards the Yellow Court, then it is not empty; how can there be spirit? Without emptiness there is no spirit; how can it be called Spirit of the Valley? The Awakening to the True says: “To obtain the Spirit of the Valley and live forever, one must rely on the Primal Yin to establish the root. When the true essence has returned to the golden chamber, a single ray of spiritual light never departs.” The union of the Primal Yin and the centre is emptiness; emptiness means the true spirit always abides and is not darkened. The true essence, spiritual light, and Spirit of the Valley all signify one and the same true spirit.

### The Golden Cauldron and Jade Furnace

The Golden Cauldron is a hard, firm, and solid thing, symbolizing man’s resolute and single-minded intention, able to bear the meaning of the Way; it is also called the Dry Cauldron. The Jade Furnace is gentle and tranquil, symbolizing gradual progress in one’s work, able to bear the meaning of longevity; it is also called the Moist Furnace. The ignorant do not know; they cast iron cauldrons, construct mud furnaces, burn and refine metals and stones, vainly hoping to form the elixir — this is not so. The cauldrons and furnaces of form can only refine the ordinary medicine of form, but cannot refine the immortal medicine of formlessness. The ancient immortals say: “The cauldron is originally without cauldron, the furnace is also not furnace.” What is called furnace and cauldron is the work of cultivation; only by the combined use of firmness and softness can the work be accomplished. It is like those who refine: there cannot be a cauldron without a furnace, nor a furnace without a cauldron; only when both are complete can the medicine be made.

### The Black Crow and White Hare

At noon there is the Golden Crow, which is Yin within Yang; at night there is the Jade Hare, which is Yang within Yin. The sun, in the hexagram, is Li, external Yang and internal Yin, signifying the meaning of firmness containing softness; the moon, in the hexagram, is Kan, external Yin and internal Yang, signifying softness containing firmness. The Way of the Golden Elixir takes only the softness within firmness, the firmness within softness, the two great medicines of true Yin and true Yang; they melt and fuse into one qi to form the elixir. These are called medicines because true Yin and true Yang can restore youth and prolong life. As for the entwining of turtle and snake, the harmony of water and fire, these are also of the same principle, but are casual images to confirm the way of the union of true Yin and true Yang. The ignorant do not know, and suspect that the words Black Crow and White Hare mean to orally inhale the essence of sun and moon, or to gaze at the essence of sun and moon — this is not so. Heaven has its sun and moon, man his sun and moon; man’s true Yin and true Yang are his Black Crow and White Hare sun and moon. The sun and moon essences at the edge of heaven are far from me; how can they be gathered? If one says they can be gathered, what is gathered is evil qi outside the body; in time it will cause internal swelling and external blindness; no benefit but harm ensues.

### The Meeting of Dragon and Tiger

The dragon’s nature is soft; it governs living things; it belongs to wood; in the hexagram it is Zhen, symbolizing softness in man. Zhen is originally Yang but symbolizes softness; Yang is less, Yin more. The tiger’s nature is firm; it governs killing things; it belongs to metal; in the hexagram it is Dui, symbolizing firmness in man. Dui is originally Yin but symbolizes firmness; Yin is less, Yang more. This nature and emotion; when separated, become the qi of passions and dust, harming life; when harmonized, become true nature and true emotion, promoting life. The meeting of dragon and tiger is thus the seeking of emotion by nature, the return of emotion to nature, the union of nature and emotion. As for the Eastern family’s daughter and the Western household’s youth, matched as husband and wife, eldest son and youngest daughter, the two families united, the joining of metal and wood — all are images to signify this meeting of true nature and true emotion. The ignorant do not know, and take the liver as dragon, the lung as tiger, and manipulate liver and lung qi at the centre of the navel, or at the elixir field or the Yellow Court, as the mating of dragon and tiger — this is not so. They do not know that the liver and lung qi are all postnatal qi of form; not only can they not condense in one place, but if forcibly gathered, they will become a poisonous parasite, incurable and hastening death; how foolish is this!

### The Inversion of Kan and Li

The Kan hexagram is external Yin and internal Yang; the Li hexagram is external Yang and internal Yin. Internal Yang is water; internal Yin is fire. The elixir way takes the Yang within Kan to fill the Yin within Li; it uses water to aid fire. This is called water above fire, fire below water; the inversion of Kan and Li. It symbolizes the divine water of the true knowledge of the Dao, which dispels the evil fire of human spiritual knowledge. My true knowledge is dark outside and bright inside, like Kan with external Yin and internal Yang; my spiritual knowledge is bright outside and dark inside, like Li with external Yang and internal Yin. Using true knowledge to control spiritual knowledge, and spiritual knowledge to follow true knowledge, true spirit is one; condensing to form the elixir is like the inversion of Kan and Li, water and fire aiding each other. As for the images of infant, beautiful woman, black lead, and red mercury, they merely symbolize the union of true knowledge and spiritual knowledge. The ignorant do not know, and point to the kidney as Kan, the heart as Li, and operate kidney qi upward to the heart, heart qi downward to the kidney, calling this the inversion of Kan and Li; others take the inner elixir of the chamber and use male and female as infant and beautiful woman, male below and female above, as the inversion of Kan and Li; others, the alchemists, use black lead to make mercury, or fire under the furnace and water stored above the cauldron, as the inversion of Kan and Li, water and fire aiding each other. All this is mistaken. The Way of cultivating the true is to cultivate the true; all forms, dregs, deviant conducts, and ugly acts are false and not true, how can they accomplish the true?

### The Inversion of the Five Elements

The five elements in proper order generate each other: wood generates fire, metal generates water; in inversion, fire generates wood, water generates metal. Fire producing wood signifies wood that is eternal and indestructible; like wood encountering fire, refined to charcoal, entering the earth to be eternal. Water producing metal signifies metal that is eternal and indestructible; like scattered metal melted in a furnace to form blocks, shining with extra brightness. Fire producing wood symbolizes that man’s nature is refined in the great furnace, becoming an unshakable nature; water producing metal symbolizes that man’s true emotion crosses the sea of desire, enduring without stain or impurity. The ancient immortals say that the proper sequence of the five elements corresponds to the fiery pit of the dharma realm; the inversion of the five elements corresponds to the seven treasures of the great earth. The ignorant do not know, and arbitrarily move east and west, patch below and mend above, push forward and move backward, calling this the inversion of the five elements — this is false. They do not know that the body is pure Yin; internally the heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys; externally the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and body; all are false things. When the throat qi breaks, all that is left is a heap of foul bones and flesh; where is anything true? If one uses these false things to vainly seek to understand nature and life, how can this be accomplished?

### The Matchmaker Yellow Matron

The Yellow Matron is the central Earth Mother; because she can regulate Yin and Yang, harmonize the Four Images, she is called the Yellow Matron. The elixir texts borrow this to signify the true intention and true faith in man, able to harmonize nature and emotion, and nourish the spirit. True intention and true faith are the Yellow Matron within my body, that which penetrates reason in the Yellow Middle. The ignorant do not know, and take the use of intention to move the five viscera qi to unite as the Yellow Matron Matchmaker. Worse, some wicked persons use a talkative old woman to harass men and women in lust, taking a virgin’s first menses plum as the Yellow Matron Matchmaker — this is very wrong. True earth has no place, true intention has no form; all things are born from it, all reason is contained in it; able to unite the three families and gather the five elements, hence named Yellow Matron Matchmaker. How can this be the meaning of the intention of thought, the name of a witch old woman?

### The Two Eight Strings

Between the dark and new moon, the moon meets the sun; on the third day a faint light appears, on the eighth day Yin is half Yang, like a bowstring, called the upper string. On the sixteenth day the moon is full. On the nineteenth day a faint black appears inside the Yin womb; on the twenty-third day Yang is half Yin, like a bowstring, called the lower string. The upper string receives the eight taels of gold within water; the lower string receives the eight taels of water within gold. Two eights make one pound; gold and water mutually rest, Yin and Yang unite — this image is borrowed in elixir texts to signify the just balance of firmness and softness, neither biased nor leaning, utter centrality and rectitude. The ignorant do not know, some take a man’s sixteenth year as the two eights, when the two strings’ qi is full, and thus forcefully close the Yin essence; some take eight taels of black lead and half a pound of mercury as the material of the two eight strings, and refine and ingest them — all this is mistaken. The Four Hundred Characters say: “Upper string gold eight taels, lower string water half a pound; the two strings combine their essence, and the Dry and Moist bodies are formed.” The two strings are one Yin and one Yang. Dry firmness is Yang; Moist softness is Yin; Yin and Yang paired, Dry and Moist bodies formed; the elixir essence has image. Thus the meaning of the two strings is understood.

### The Millet Pearl

Before man is born in the body, within the embryonic sac, all is confusion, darkness, and muddle; only a single qi revolves about, nothing else. This is called the Great One containing the true qi. This qi is most divine and most subtle, most empty and most spiritual; it is utmost non-being yet contains utmost being. The Three Origins, Eight Trigrams, Four Images, and Five Elements are all contained within it. Although formless, it can transform; therefore transformation is infinite. The five viscera, six bowels, nine orifices, and one hundred bones are all naturally established because of its most divine and most subtle, most empty and most spiritual quality. It is also called True Spirit, or the spirit that is not spirit. When within the mother’s womb, the one qi containing the true is called true qi; when it issues from the mother’s womb, the spirit containing one qi is called spirit qi. One qi is the substance, which is true emptiness; true spirit is the function, which is subtle existence. True qi and true spirit, true emptiness and subtle existence, though named differently, are but one truth. This truth is formless, imageless, soundless, odorless; it cannot be transmitted by words or painted by brush. Its image is like that of a millet grain, small indeed; hence the ancient immortals all call this truth the Millet Treasure Pearl. Though called millet, it does not have the form of millet; because it has a particle of spiritual qi hidden in the centre, it is so named millet; because it has a particle of millet’s spirit and contains chaos and void, embracing all the three realms, it is called the Millet Pearl. Ultimately, it is the primal qi before heaven and earth were differentiated. The ignorant do not know, and take a woman’s first menses plum as the Millet Pearl, or a cultivator’s spirit residing in the bright hall, whose eyes scatter outward, as the Millet Pearl — all false. The millet pearl of primal chaos is the spiritual treasure that gives birth to sages and worthies, that perfects immortals and Buddhas; how could it be the turbid blood substance or the light of imagined thought? The Four Hundred Characters say: “Chaos embraces the void; the void embraces the three realms; tracing to the root source, it is the size of a millet grain.” The Elder Sanfeng says: “Who does not know it? Who cannot do it? All confusion lies in the millet grain of primal chaos.”

### The Fire Duration Hexagram Images

The elixir scriptures all borrow the sixty-four hexagrams as the symbols of the yin and yang charms of the fire method; they take the two hexagrams Qian and Kun as the cauldron and furnace, adopting their firmness and softness as substance; the two hexagrams Kan and Li as the medicines, adopting their firmness, softness, and centrality as function; again, the two hexagrams Gou as the boundary of Yin and Yang, taking their respective times of firmness and softness movement; the two hexagrams Tun and Meng as the beginning of creation, taking their requirement that when firing advances one must employ firmness, when firing retreats one must employ softness; Jìwei is the end of creation, taking firmness as the yang fire, not too much, softness as the yin charm, not too little. The other fifty-four hexagrams follow naturally from the use of these ten hexagrams Qian, Kun, Kan, Li, Gou, Tun, Meng, Jìwei in fire operation. In brief, it all comes to the matching of Yin and Yang, their union into one, returning to the image of original unity and completeness. The ignorant do not know this, and forcibly apply the sixty-four hexagrams to year, month, day, and hour — this is false. Heaven and earth, Yin and Yang, and creation are one qi moving in succession, cycling endlessly; how could this be done by the sixty-four hexagrams? The sixty-four hexagrams are the sages’ observation of heavenly and earthly images, embodying Yin Yang creation; they are the explanation and annotation of Yin Yang creation. The creation of the human body corresponds to the creation of heaven and earth and has its own sixty-four hexagrams; how can one be bound by words and images?

### The Gate of My Birth

When the moon reaches the southwest, it is at the extreme of darkness and birth of brightness; the southwest belongs to Kun, the pure Yin direction. Beneath pure Yin, a Yang is secretly born; there is the image of Kun above and Zhen below; in the hexagram it is Fu; in the month it is the waning moon; both signify that in perfect stillness suddenly the heavenly heart appears; also called Dao Heart, also called the True Mind of Goodness of Heaven, that which was previously called the waning moon furnace. If one sees this heart and guards it without losing it, one uses it to advance Yang and retreat Yin, like a cat catching a mouse; Yang will surely grow, Yin will surely recede; when Yin is exhausted and Yang pure, one is immortal. Hence the southwest Kun position is called the Gate of My Birth. The ignorant do not know, and take a woman’s birth gate as the Gate of My Birth — this is not so. The birth gate is the place of giving birth to people; how can it give birth to immortals?

### The Door of My Death

When the moon reaches the northeast, the Yang light is about to vanish; the northeast belongs to Gen; Yin qi is about to become pure; Yang light is slight; there is the image of Gen above and Kun below; in the hexagram it is Bo; in the month it is the Fu bowl; both signify the meaning of the guest qi peeling away and consuming the true origin. If there is a man who is transcendent, courageous, and resolute, who suddenly awakens and turns back, he may use this little remainder of Yang to bring light to break darkness; with effort in cultivation, he will not find it difficult to return to origin and revert to the root. All ordinary men, confused and not awakened, follow the Yin qi to peel away Yang; when Yang is exhausted and Yin pure, how can they not die? The Book of Changes says: “In the northeast friends are lost.” The elixir scriptures also call this Door of My Death. The ignorant do not know, and take a woman’s birth gate as the Door of My Death — this is not so. The gates of birth and death are both invisible and imageless portals; because following Yin leads to death, reversing Yang leads to life, they are named birth gate and death door; in truth there is only one orifice. The ancient immortals call this the Gate of Life and Death. Though named gate, it has no position or place; it is a forced name. The Awakening to the True says: “One must take the door of death as the door of life; do not cling to the birth gate as the death gate. When one understands the killing principle and returns and reverses, then one knows that harm is reversed to give birth to grace.” Thus the meaning of the birth gate and death door is known.

### The Orifice of Action

The Way of Action is the work of observing the orifice of desire. To observe the orifice is to observe the orifice of Yin and Yang creation; borrowing the postnatal to return to the prenatal, harmonizing the Four Images, gathering the five elements, gathering medicines, advancing fire, returning the elixir, to the forming of the embryo; the order of the work is all within it. Without a true master to transmit by word and heart, a hair’s difference causes a thousand li error. The ignorant do not know, and manipulate qi and blood on the postnatal illusory skin bag, thinking this is the Way of Action — this is not so. The Way of the Golden Elixir is the learning of the prenatal; it can reverse Yin and Yang, steal creation, return the flow of qi, invert heaven and earth; a Way prenatal and unopposed by heaven — how can it be accomplished by making and doing with the postnatal body of form and substance? The Elder Zhengyang says: “Tears, saliva, essence, qi, blood, and fluids, all seven spiritual substances are Yin. If one takes these as the root of the elixir, how can one ascend to the Jade Capital?” The Purple Yang Elder says: “Swallowing essence and taking in qi is the human way; there is a formula for creating transformation and life. Without the true seed in the cauldron, still one boils water and fire in an empty wok.” Alas! The golden shrimp and toad, the jade old crow, only true masters recognize them. The Way of Action is not easily known.

### The Subtlety of Non-action

The Way of Non-action is the work of observing the subtlety of desirelessness; it is the matter after the holy embryo is condensed. It is the quiet observation of the subtle changes of qi. After the holy embryo is condensed, the postnatal has returned to the prenatal; only the work of bathing and nourishing is used; do not forget or assist; use the natural true fire to fumigate and steam; changes come of themselves; formless produces form; formlessness produces substance; the melon is ripe and the stalk falls off; the infant appears; all previous work of cooking and martial fire is abandoned and no longer used. The ignorant do not know what is meant by ultimate nature and life, what cultivation is, and learn some side-door and crooked small methods, and then enter the mountains to meditate, or close the gate and fix the spirit, thinking this is non-action — this is not so. Nature and life must be cultivated together; the work must have two stages; the two stages are first action to understand life, then non-action to understand nature; how can mere empty sitting and fixing the spirit accomplish nature and life? The Awakening to the True says: “Do not enter the mountain before refining the return elixir; inside and outside the mountain all is no lead; these treasures every family has, but fools do not fully understand.” It further says: “To begin with action no one sees; when reaching non-action all begin to know. They only see non-action as the essential subtlety; how can they know that action is the root?”

Thus it is known that action and non-action each have their time, each have their function, and are very different.

### Mixing with the World and Harmonizing the Light

Mixing with the world and harmonizing the light is the work of the great recluse in the market and court. Mixing with the world is to mingle among the vulgar so that men do not know; harmonizing the light is to harmonize but not be the same, to be in the dust yet come forth from the dust. To be able to mix with the world and harmonize the light, externally round and able to respond to things, internally square and having mastership; following the worldly law and cultivating the Dao law, manifesting and concealing, opposing and conforming, without obstruction or hindrance, following the Way is easy. The ignorant do not know, and sometimes think mixing with the world and harmonizing the light is the work of daytime, and cultivation of stillness is for nighttime — this is not so. If this were so, to follow the vulgar would be permitted, but to mix with the vulgar not permitted; to veil the light would be permitted, but to harmonize the light not permitted. The Way of mixing with the world and harmonizing the light has the power to seize the creation of heaven and earth, to steal the secret of Yin Yang birth and death; how could it be easily known, easily practised?

### Medicine Returning to the Earth Cauldron

Earth is gentle and warm, able to nourish things; the cauldron governs cooking and stewing, able to complete things. The cauldron is named from earth; it is the vessel for nourishing and completing things, not the usual earth and not the usual cauldron. Medicine returning to the earth cauldron signifies the union of Yin and Yang, the condensation and nourishment of the holy embryo. To nurture the holy embryo depends entirely on a single intention that does not scatter; to hold firmly to the mean, Yin and Yang correspond, neither biased nor leaning; hence it is also named the earth cauldron. Ultimately, it is but the single character “middle.” Guarding this middle is the wonderful secret of nurturing the holy embryo. The ignorant do not know, some dig earth furnaces to nurture cinnabar, take mercury from cinnabar, and call the earth furnace the earth cauldron; some make mud furnaces and ash pools, burn lead in ash pools to separate silver, and call the ash pool the earth cauldron — these are all mistaken. Zi Ye says: “True earth has no place, true intention has no form; only the middle earth cauldron, formless and imageless, without place or position, because it can complete the holy embryo, is named cauldron; how could it be the named cauldron of earth?”

### Condensing the Holy Embryo

The holy embryo is the embryo of the holy man; it is the infant’s original face without consciousness or knowledge. The Way attains no consciousness or knowledge; the hundred spirits assemble, the myriad conditions cease; confusion and murkiness enter the realm of vagueness and dimness; there is self-movement entering non-action. The ignorant do not know; some take the mingling of heart fluids and kidney qi at the Yellow Court as the holy embryo; some take the spirit residing in the central palace as the holy embryo; some circulate qi upward and downward, resting in the elixir field as the holy embryo — all are mistaken. The holy embryo has no form and no substance; though named embryo, in truth there is no embryo to be seen; embryo is only a metaphor for the condensation and unscattered true spirit. If qi and blood are forcibly condensed into an embryo, it is a ghost embryo hastening death, not a holy embryo of longevity.

### The Completion of the Embryo in Ten Months

The embryo is complete in ten months, signifying that spirit is full and qi abundant, that root and dust are removed, guest qi digested, Yin exhausted and Yang pure; it is like a woman’s pregnancy, which requires ten months to complete. The elixir way uses “ten months to complete the embryo” by taking its meaning that after the holy embryo is condensed, one must guard against peril and danger, bath and nourish, and await its perfection without defect before ending; it is not to be taken as a fixed term of ten months. The ignorant do not know, and suspect that the words “ten months” mean circulating qi, or storing thought, or concentrating spirit, and imagine the forming of the embryo, taking ten months as the fixed term — this is not so. The Way of cultivating the true, from gathering medicines, cooking and refining, forming elixir and embryo, to completing the way and changing the embryo, requires unlimited effort; how can it be fixed to ten months? Thus ten months is but symbolic speech.

### The Appearance of the Infant

The appearance of the infant is called the liberation and transformation of the holy embryo. The holy embryo is the law-body hidden within the coloured body; liberation and transformation is the law-body born within the coloured body. Because another law-body is born within the coloured body, like an ordinary woman bearing a child after ten months, it is named infant. When the infant appears, there is a body outside the body, leaping out beyond the three realms, not within the five elements; it escapes reincarnation, and shares the same longevity as heaven and earth, the same age as sun and moon. The ignorant do not know, and take the true Yang in Kan as the law-body infant, or the essence and qi in the kidney as the law-body infant — this is not so. The infant in Kan is Yang within Yin; the law-body infant is the true union of Yin and Yang; as for kidney qi, it is evil fire in the kidney, and has no meaning of infant; how may they be confused? The Awakening to the True says: “The infant is one containing true qi; ten months to complete the embryo and enter the holy foundation.” The Four Hundred Characters say: “When husband and wife come together, in the bridal chamber clouds and rain arise; after one year a child is born, each one able to ride a crane.” Thus the meaning of the law-body infant is known.

### Changing Furnace and Exchanging Cauldron

When the Great Way is complete, and there is a body outside the body, both form and spirit subtle, one has attained the position of great saint, and the furnace and cauldron are no longer used; what need is there to change furnace and exchange cauldron? The reason for changing furnace and exchanging cauldron is still to hide the law-body in secret nurture, to transform its spiritual powers. What furnace is changed? What cauldron is exchanged? The ethereal void of Yi is the cauldron; non-action is the furnace; and the former Dry Cauldron, Moist Furnace, Cinnabar Cauldron, Waning Moon Furnace, all medicines, are altogether unused. Only the law-body is used. The law-body dwells in void and non-being, self-transforming and self-changing; the more empty, the more spiritual; the more non-existent, the more wondrous; wondrous beyond measure, changes without end; what is called son and grandson and great-grandson and branch. Upon reaching this position, cease work; break the void; leap to the realm of Great Luo — then it is appropriate. Later students, having not obtained the true transmission, sometimes suspect that having a body outside the body is the utmost reach of the Way — this is not so. The Song of Knocking on the Lines says: “One thing is non-being, following the manifest Way, the five directions reveal the true man’s visage; immortal boys and girls welcome with coloured clouds; the Five Wisdom Palace has the true proclamation.” From this it is known that the law-body’s myriad transformations are the utmost skill.
