# Poems on Dispelling Doubt: Fifty Seven-Character Quatrains

### Departure from the World

The affairs of the world are all unreal,  
Among worldly ties, love and favour most harm the body;  
With one stroke severed, no entanglement remains,  
Freed from the scene, become your own true self.

### Refining Sleep

To sleep little is not to refine the sleep demon;  
Forgetting meals, forsaking rest, to sever the vines and creepers.  
All attachments swept away, the heart becomes pure and still,  
Day and night long slumber—what is there to fear?

### Merit and Practice

In cultivation, first accumulate virtue,  
Great merit and deep practice move Heaven itself.  
Foolish men laugh, serving only themselves,  
Without merit or practice, they dream to become immortals.

### The Golden Elixir

Innate nature is called the Elixir,  
Refined in the furnace of the Eight Trigrams into a pellet.  
The world’s lost seek external medicines,  
Swallowing meals in vain, dreaming to ascend to the clouds.

### The Original Pass

The Original Pass is a single orifice few know,  
Misty and dim, containing the Two Principles.  
Go with the flow to leave the road of vexation,  
Reversing the course is the foundation of sages.

### Knowing the Spirit

Thought and spirit are called the Knowing Spirit,  
Seeds of reincarnation bearing roots of dust.  
The foolish all play with wandering souls,  
At last, who can discern the true master?

### Yang Essence

Yang essence, a secret point in the Form Mountain,  
Recognise the truth and your visage shall abide.  
Neither in the heart nor in the kidneys,  
Neither void nor form, hidden within the Original Pass.

### Innate Qi

Innate Qi dwells in primal chaos,  
No form, no image, yet not void.  
To recognise the original true face of birth,  
Then know I have a master within me.

### Prior and Posterior Heaven

Before birth of the body is called Prior Heaven,  
Once born, qi and form connect.  
Prior sages and later men divide two paths,  
One must carefully distinguish the partial from the whole.

### The First Scripture

The First Scripture is the treasure of Prior Heaven,  
Dim and vague, the true unified essence.  
Pure white, spotless, a clear and clean thing,  
Do not use turbid blood to counterfeit a good name.

### The Three Medicines

The Great Medicine is threefold: essence, qi, and spirit,  
Formed things are not the original truth.  
Most refined, most pure, ethereal and spiritual,  
Refined into the adamantine great Dharma body.

### Nature and Life

Nature and life originally divide Prior and Posterior Heaven,  
At birth the body falls to earth, defined as partial and whole.  
Posterior nature and life follow Heaven’s fate,  
Seize the Prior Heaven and I wield authority.

### The Heart of Heaven and Earth

Where hides the heart of Heaven and Earth?  
Yin and Yang excite and reveal a round light.  
Cooked and ripened in the cauldron of emptiness,  
In ten thousand ages, not damaged nor diminished.

### Heart of the Way and Heart of Man

Man’s heart is like iron, the Heart of the Way is gold,  
Measure carefully in subtle danger and small sips.  
Transforming and lucid, no high or low,  
The source is living water, distinct from Yin and Yang.

### Before Birth

Before the birth of the body who knows?  
Quietly and silently in chaotic time.  
Four images and five elements have not yet arrived,  
Confused as one qi without male or female.

### At First Birth

What is the matter of first birth’s face?  
Prior and Posterior Heaven, one qi harmonised.  
No perception, no knowledge, no stain,  
Seeds of Buddha and Immortal, cradle of sages.

### Another’s Home

Another’s home is not another’s home,  
Mistakenly regarded, a great difference.  
My child is lost outside,  
Call once and faces appear as at father’s side.

### Self and Other

The Scripture says: distinguish self and other, Yin and Yang,  
Neither form nor void, a pure and clean village.  
Those who plunder elixirs with evil arts,  
In the village of fireworks, spoil the heavenly goodness.

### Companions

Companions must be divided as internal and external cause,  
In the body are two or three companions,  
Outside companions likewise assist and support,  
Free from the cycle of rebirth and the dust of kalpas.

### External Protection

All seek external protection hoping for success,  
Buying cauldrons, cooking lead, chasing the wind in confusion.  
How can they know Heaven’s secret and transcend mundane methods?  
Borrow such great power to suppress the foolish and ignorant.

### The Nine Cauldrons

The nine numbers of Qian and Yuan are pure Yang,  
The nine cauldrons refine the returning elixir.  
Evil and confused seekers guess the female cauldron,  
Determinedly cast into the iron-walled village.

### Drawing In and Controlling

To draw in and control Prior Heaven there is a secret method,  
Strike the zither, beat the bamboo, see the Void Sovereign.  
Where colour and sound make noise, no hindrance,  
At hand twist back the Northern Dipper’s light.

### Reversal

Reversing Yin and Yang is no difficulty,  
Should be done in stillness with spirit observation.  
When the Way’s heart is not obscured, man’s heart perishes,  
Standing firm one ascends the hundred-foot pole.

### Time of Fire

Operating the fire skill has no fixed time,  
Morning diligence, evening vigilance, sever the Three Corpses.  
Beware of danger and risk, always be tranquil,  
Respond to things without confusion, harming not nor benefiting.

### Hexagrams and Images

The Scripture of Fire Time speaks of the Zhou Yi hexagrams,  
Pushing lines and holding images are all false.  
Mostly one must comprehend the principle of Yin and Yang,  
Advance and retreat as time suits, command as you will.

### Furnace of Heaven and Earth

The Qian cauldron and Kun furnace are in my body,  
Do not seek causes from outside.  
Hardness and softness, two matters without interval,  
Forge the true qi of Prior Heaven.

### The Waning Moon Furnace

Asked what is the Waning Moon Furnace,  
In blackness there is whiteness, dim yet reviving.  
Clearly points out the mother of the returning elixir,  
Awakening men who have no recognition.

### The Vermilion Cauldron

Cultivating truth relies on the Vermilion Cauldron,  
Neither iron, nor gold, nor silver from the mountains.  
Recognise the spirit-bright subtle thing,  
Take the new and reject the old, see primordial benevolence.

### The Earthen Pot

Is the earthen pot made from earth?  
Centre and correct place is true name.  
Wood, metal, water, fire all gathered here,  
Nurturing the primal pearl, shining through the night.

### The Dipper Handle

By observing the Dipper handle’s circuit round the heavens,  
One at last comprehends where life’s source lies.  
Twist the root of the foot and turn it over,  
Then in the fire appears the golden lotus.

### The Two Strings

The lower string is water, the upper string is metal,  
Merely to harmonise Yin and Yang.  
If indeed hardness and softness are harmonised,  
Within appears the heart of Nirvana.

### Ren and Gui

Ren water is Yang, Gui water is Yin,  
How many learners pursue this subtlety?  
The pivot moves, divides true and false,  
Remove the turbid, leave the clear, produce white gold.

### Refining Oneself

To cultivate and refine oneself is foremost,  
Abandon desire, forget affection, sever myriad ties.  
The six thieves and three Pengs all cut away,  
Clean and pure, one elixir field.

### Laying the Foundation

Resolute and firm intention is laying the foundation,  
Body and mind unmoved is most wondrous.  
In spite of disasters and calamities,  
Still water without waves, all things depart.

### Lead and Mercury

True mercury is not the world’s mercury,  
True lead is not the lead from mountains.  
One feeling, one nature, the medicine of Prior Heaven,  
Refined and forged, returning root and great restoration.

### Ying and Cha

The Cha maid hides the Li, not truly real,  
The infant in Kan is also difficult to follow.  
Now speak the secret of Yin and Yang orifices,  
Capable of reality and vacuity, producing the Dharma body.

### Kan and Li

Do not seek Kan and Li toward north or south,  
Fire nature flies upward, water flows downward.  
If the two could reverse,  
Water rises, fire descends, forming the elixir head.

### Zhen and Dui

Dui is not the western land, nor Zhen the eastern,  
Nature confused, passion bewildered, qi differs.  
Comprehend passion’s return to the law of nature,  
In a moment see the true master of myself.

### Zi and Wu

Zi and Wu, do not seek sun and moon,  
Within the body is another compass.  
Yin and Yang, movement and stillness always present,  
In calmness constantly listen to the ancient sound.

### Mao and You

The Scripture of Bathing speaks of Mao and You times,  
Forms of two qi without flaw or bias.  
Fools do not understand the meeting of Yin and Yang,  
Morning and evening divide, sitting quietly.

### The Yellow Matron

Male and female matched require the Yellow Matron,  
Wu and Ji form the jade tablet of creation’s nest.  
If asked the true message of the Yellow Matron,  
One sincere response harmonises the five elements.

### Returning the Elixir

Why is cultivating the elixir called returning the elixir?  
The five qi separate, each single and distinct.  
Brightness and goodness return to the beginning and all gather,  
Body and mind unmoved, forged into a ball.

### Elixir Ripened

When the elixir has returned there is another method,  
No need to add or subtract or increase Yang again.  
Naturally the divine fire is refined in the furnace,  
Bursting forth is a particle of light connecting with Heaven.

### Holy Embryo

The holy embryo is not a formed fetus,  
Qi gathers, spirit condenses, a true seed planted.  
Beware of danger and risk, always be cautious,  
If careless in return, disaster will arise.

### Shedding the Fetus

The holy embryo sheds transformation and becomes wholly true,  
Ten months of effort nurturing the grain spirit.  
Yang qi utterly pure, Yin qi exhausted,  
From empty space leaps forth an immortal.

### Action and Non-action

Action is not merely playing with the skin bag,  
All contrivances suffer injury.  
How can one know the true subtle secret of the heart?  
Spirits and demons cannot fathom the twisting of Yin and Yang.

### Non-action

Non-action is not to fix on stubborn emptiness,  
Still one must not forget nor aid the work.  
Pull out the seeds of rebirth and death,  
Within only one divine child remains.

### Returning to Gòu

At Yin’s extreme, return to Yang requires advancing fire,  
Pure Yang operates Gòu carrying Yin talisman.  
Yin talisman and Yang fire without error,  
Refine out the Prior Heaven’s Taiji diagram.

### Culture and Force

Mighty force subdues demons as martial refining,  
Humble heart nurtures qi as literary cooking.  
Know bad luck and good fortune, change with time,  
Everywhere gold shines, dazzling and bright.

### Harmonising the Light

Harmonising light mingled with the world is secret Heaven’s machine,  
Great power of the spirit’s skill is truly rare.  
Always respond, always clear, always free,  
At all times cast off the old and don new garments.
