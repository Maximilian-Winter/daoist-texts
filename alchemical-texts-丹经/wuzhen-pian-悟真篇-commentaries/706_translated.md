# Postscript to the Treatise on Realizing the Truth

I take it that men, in being born, all owe their existence to delusive feelings. Having a body, there is trouble; but if there be no body, whence trouble? If one desires to escape trouble, there is nothing better than to embody the Perfect Way; if one desires to embody the Perfect Way, there is nothing better than to illumine the Original Mind. The mind is the substance of the Way; the Way is the function of the mind. If a man can observe the mind and contemplate his nature, then the clear and perfect substance will of itself appear, and the function of non-action of itself be consummated. Without borrowing external effort, suddenly he transcends the other shore. Is it not because the mirror of the mind is bright and clear, the pearl of the spirit broad and luminous, that he can cause all appearances to instantly depart, with no speck of dust adhering, the source of mind at freedom, decided that no birth takes place? Yet the man who illumines his mind and embodies the Way cannot have his nature burdened by the body, nor his truth disturbed by external circumstances; then how can swords and arms wound him, or tigers and rhinoceroses harm him, or great fires and floods cause him fear? The heart of the sage is like a bright mirror to the scene, reflecting but not receiving; he responds to things as they arise, harmonious but without vocalizing; thus he can overcome things without being injured. This is what is called the supreme and most real subtle Way.

Originally the Way had no name; the sages forcibly gave it a name. The Way originally had no words; the sages forcibly gave it words. If then the names and words were silent, the flowing of time would have no means to recognize its substance and return to its truth. Therefore the sages established teachings and set forth words to make the Way manifest; hence the Way is made manifest through words, and words return to the Way and are then forgotten. How is this? This Way is most subtle and most minute; the common people's root nature is confused and dull; they cling to their body and hate death but delight in life; therefore in the end they find it difficult to realize it. Huang and Lao grieved for their greed and attachment, and so by the art of cultivating life, following their desires, gradually guided them step by step. The key to cultivating life lies in the Golden Elixir; the key to the Golden Elixir lies in the Pool of Spirit and Water. Hence the teachings of the Tao Te Ching and the Yin Fu (Secrets of the Hidden) have been widely spread in the world, for men delight in their lives. Yet their words are obscure and their principles profound; though students recite their texts, none understand their meaning. Unless they meet a perfect person who imparts the secret formula, though they consider and weigh a hundred kinds, they can never achieve their work and complete their task. Is it not that scholars are as numerous as cow’s hair, but those who attain are as rare as the unicorn’s horn?

Boduan met his master at Chengdu in the year of Ji-You; he was taught the methods of the Elixir. Afterwards, thrice he transmitted the teaching to no man; thrice he suffered calamities, none of which ceased within twenty days. Recently he recalled his master’s warning: “If at any time one comes to loosen your reins and unbind your fetters, you should then impart to him; all others you must not permit.” Thereafter he desired to unravel the named records, but was troubled because this Daoist did not know faith; therefore he composed this Treatise on Realizing the Truth, recounting the beginning and end of the Elixir methods. When it was issued, seekers gathered round; seeing their earnestness, his heart could not bear to refuse, so he selected and imparted to them. Yet those to whom he imparted were none but men of no great power to sustain the unstable and rescue the drowning, no generous and special men who could be benevolent and illumine the Way. When he met calamity the second time, his heart yet knew not; when the third time came, he then reflected upon his former errors. Thus he knew the great Elixir method is most simple and most easy; though the ignorant and mean may obtain it and practise it, they can immediately transcend the saintly realm. Therefore Heaven’s purpose is secret and cherished, and does not permit light transmission to unworthy men. But Boduan did not obey his master’s words, repeatedly divulging Heaven’s secret; because he has a body, therefore he oft meets reproof and calamity. Such is the deep warning of Heaven, so divine and swift; how dare he not fear and bear the responsibility? From now on, he must hold his tongue and bind his speech; though cauldrons and caldrons be before him, though swords be at his neck, he will no longer dare to speak.

This Treatise on Realizing the Truth sings the full meaning of the great Elixir, the medicines, and the subtlety of the fire’s timing, all without omission. If a man of good will has the bones of an immortal from the beginning, when he reads it his wisdom and thought will be clear; he may seek the text and explain its meaning, and need not rely on Boduan’s humble oral instruction. In this way, it is Heaven’s gift, not Boduan’s casual transmission. As for the closing song which praises the matter of seeing nature, it is the supreme and most subtle Way of perfect enlightenment spoken of above. Yet the Way of non-action, first aiding things, though manifesting profound essentials, never causes fault. How then is it that the common man, because of the thickness or thinness of his karma, the sharpness or dullness of his root nature, though hearing one sound, forms diverse opinions? Therefore the Dharma treasures expounded by Shakyamuni and Manjusri are none but one vehicle; but the hearers, according as their measure of understanding, naturally form the difference into three vehicles. Henceforth, if there be a man of keen and vigorous root nature who sees and hears this Treatise, he will know that Boduan obtained the most supreme meaning of the one vehicle from Bodhidharma and the Sixth Patriarch, and can, by means of one word, awaken to all laws. If his habitual tendencies remain, he will return to middling or low views; but this is not Boduan’s fault.
