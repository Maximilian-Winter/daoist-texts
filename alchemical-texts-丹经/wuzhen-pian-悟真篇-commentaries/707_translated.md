# The Direct Teaching of Awakening to the True, Volume One

### Sixteen Seven-character Regulated Verses Illustrating the Number Two Eight

The number two eight is the number sixteen. According to the month’s waxing moon, in the water is metal weighing eight liang; at the waning moon, in the metal is water weighing eight liang; the two eights make one jin. The metal and water are balanced and harmonious, their radiance neither partial nor biased, perfectly central and correct. The alchemical methods take as their emblem these two phases of the moon. He who cultivates the Great Way regards the yang within yin as true yang, that is, the waxing moon; and the yin within yang as true yin, that is, the waning moon. The yang within yin is the harmony of yang and yin; the yin within yang is the harmony of yin and yang. True yin and true yang join and form one; this is called two eight making one jin, the metal elixir taking shape. The sixteen verses of the regulated measure express the two eight, and thus express this.

### Verse One

Seek not the Great Way while lost on the path;  
Though burdened with worthy talent, is this the manly course?  
A hundred years pass like lightning on stone,  
A lifetime is but a bubble floating on water.  
Only greedy for profit and rank, seeking fame and display,  
Unconscious of the face’s withering and wasting away.  
Ask then, though gold piles like mountains high,  
Can the impermanence be purchased or brought nigh?

All the dusty world is the realm of sound and colour,  
The land of fame and profit, taking bitterness for joy, falsehood for truth,  
Wasting essence and exhausting breath, digging away life itself — only death remains.  
To awaken and transcend this is the perfect man;  
To know not and be ensnared within is the deluded man.  
Therefore, those of antiquity who attained the Way of the Immortal and True,  
In youth were filial and friendly at home, thus completing human relations;  
By forty years walked the Way of unmoved mind, thus preserving life.  
A hundred years of time are stolen in a moment; a lifetime of honour and disgrace flies by in a blink.  
If one does not know to return to the root and restore the source,  
To return to the root and recover the life, when the great limit arrives,  
Though gold piles up, one departs with empty hands.  
The Old Immortal said: 'Ask then, though gold piles like Mount Tai,  
Can the impermanence be bought or brought nigh?'  
Truly, this is the bell and drum of awakening, startling all alike.

### Verse Two

Though man’s life be set for a hundred years,  
Premature death, poverty, or success none can foresee.  
Yesterday on the street a horse still paced,  
Today in the coffin the corpse already lies.  
Wife and wealth forsaken are not yours,  
Can sin and karma deceive thyself?  
Great medicine seeks not to be met by chance,  
To know it and not refine is foolish ignorance.

Men struggle for name and gain, day and night without rest,  
Thinking their life measure endless, long to enjoy ease and peace.  
How know they the length or shortness of heaven’s span?  
Success or failure none can foresee.  
Do not say the world is rare in centenarians,  
Even if one reach a hundred years, death’s wilderness is inevitable.  
Often seeing men suddenly vanish,  
On the road, mid laughter, struck down by sudden death, innumerable.  
Alas! When eyes open, wealth and wife are mine,  
Greed unsatisfied; when closed, all is empty,  
Nothing to carry away, only countless sins borne back.  
Better to see through worldly matters early,  
Seek swiftly a wise master, to find the great medicine.  
If by chance the great medicine is met,  
This is great blessing and great root.  
Resolutely apply force in cultivation,  
Then can one pass from death into life, and understand impermanence.  
But if met and yet unwilling to cultivate,  
This is self-destruction and folly,  
Equal to those who see not through the world, and also doomed to perish —  
What worth is such knowledge?

### Verse Three

To learn the Immortal must be to learn the Heavenly Immortal,  
Only the Golden Elixir is supreme and perfect.  
When the two substances meet, feelings and nature unite,  
All the five elements complete, dragons and tigers entwined.  
Originally the fifth and sixth earthly branches are the marriage bond,  
Thus the husband and wife dwell in joyful union.  
Only await accomplishment to ascend the northern palace,  
In ninefold rosy clouds to ride the phoenix and soar.

The foregoing two verses teach men to see through worldly affairs,  
Urgently seek the great medicine, to escape birth and death.  
The way to escape birth and death is the path of the Immortal.  
But there are many grades of Immortal:  
Those who understand nature and transcend yin and spirit, are ghostly immortals;  
Those who understand fate and retain form to dwell in the world, are earth immortals;  
Those who understand both nature and fate, have a body beyond body, form and spirit both wondrous, and unite with the Tao in truth, are heavenly immortals.  
Ghostly immortals, though of yin spirit, come and go freely,  
Yet their dwelling is not firm, still subject to the peril of losing and regaining the body.  
Earth immortals can retain form and dwell in the world,  
Yet their Dharma body cannot be freed, still burdened with illusory form and physical things.  
Both suffer once in death or once in life, and fail to transcend birth and death fully.  
Only heavenly immortals shed illusory form and become Dharma body,  
Surpassing creation, beyond birth and death,  
Able to escape birth and death, sharing heaven’s longevity, eternal and imperishable.  
Those who desire to escape birth and death must learn to be heavenly immortals.  
To begin to learn heavenly immortals, there is no way but the Great Way of the Golden Elixir.

Gold is the solid, firm, imperishable substance;  
The elixir is the mixed and unobstructed image.  
Firm, imperishable, mixed and unobstructed, fused into one qi,  
Like the void and roundness of heaven, unfathomable, embracing all, harmed by none.  
Therefore when the Way is accomplished, it is called the heavenly immortal;  
Because it is eternal and imperishable, it is called the golden immortal;  
Because it is hidden and manifest, unfathomable, it is called the spirit immortal.  
In truth, the golden immortal and spirit immortal are altogether the heavenly immortal.  
To cultivate heavenly immortals, abandoning the Great Way of the Golden Elixir, there is no other method.  
This Golden Elixir is the spirit root received from heaven,  
Most good with no evil, good knowledge and good ability,  
A perfect and flawless spiritual root, condensed from the innate supreme yang qi.  
Within it are yin and yang, concealed five elements;  
Having qi but not substance, unlike the tangible, turbid things of the later heaven.  
When refined by the yin symbol and yang fire to maturity, it is forever imperishable,  
Called the Seven Returns and Nine Reversions, the Golden Liquid Great Reverting Elixir.  
The Golden Elixir is another name for the mixed original nature,  
Not other than original nature, yet there is one more Golden Elixir besides.  
This elixir all possess, each complete,  
In sages it is no more, in the common no less,  
The seed of immortals and Buddhas, the root of sages and worthies.  
Yet without fire refinement, extreme yang must turn to yin, extreme perfection must decline, falling into the later heaven.  
Knowledge opens and private desires mix, qi and substance arise and heavenly goodness darkens;  
Good knowledge and good ability all turn to bad, no longer pure and white in their body.  
Therefore the ancient sages established the way of the Golden Elixir return,  
So that all return home to acknowledge their ancestor, restoring what was originally theirs.

How to say return? Return means what was lost comes again; restore means what was lost is regained.  
The original spiritual root darkens because yin and yang are not harmonized, the five elements injure one another.  
If indeed yin and yang unite, the five elements cluster,  
Still the same old lump, perfectly complete, the original thing.  
The two substances are one firm and one soft, one strong and one yielding, one true knowledge, one spiritual knowledge, one true feeling, one spiritual nature.  
True knowledge dwells in the Tao heart, governing strength and vigour, issuing forth as true feeling;  
Spiritual knowledge is hidden in the human heart, governing gentleness and compliance, containing spiritual nature.  
If true knowledge and spiritual knowledge separate,  
The strong is no longer strong, the yielding no longer yielding,  
Firm and soft lose their measure, true feeling and spiritual nature become false feeling and false nature.  
If true knowledge and spiritual knowledge unite,  
Strength is where strength should be, compliance where compliance should be,  
Firm and soft respond to the time;  
False feeling and false nature turn into true feeling and true nature.  
The Old Immortal said: 'When the two substances meet, feelings and nature unite;  
Is this not most clear and distinct?'

The five elements are the five qi of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth.  
These five qi in the earlier heaven are the five origins: original nature, original feeling, original essence, original spirit, original qi.  
In the later heaven they become the five things: wandering soul, ghostly soul, yin essence, discerning spirit, and deluded thought.  
The five origins have the five virtues of benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and faith;  
The five things have the five passions of joy, anger, sorrow, pleasure, and desire.  
The full five elements, earlier and later heaven mixed and clustered, unify the five origins governing the five things.  
The dragon is yang, governing life energy, belonging to the east and wood, in humans it is nature;  
The tiger is yin, governing killing energy, belonging to the west and metal, in humans it is feeling.  
If the five elements are not harmonized, each acts on its own nature;  
The five origins change to five things, the five virtues become five thieves;  
The dragon in the east and the tiger in the west, nature is confused and feeling bewildered,  
The qi of killing cuts the qi of life.  
If the five elements are complete, they all return to nature,  
The five things change to five origins, the five thieves change to five virtues.  
Dragons coil and tigers crouch, nature settles and feeling forgets,  
This is true feeling and true nature, killing qi also becomes life qi.

The way of elixir cultivation is but to regulate firm and soft,  
Making them fit to be strong and compliant, nature and feeling united.  
Nature and feeling united, yin and yang meet, five elements complete,  
Still the integral heavenly principle, most good without evil, good knowledge and good ability,  
The original thing, and the Golden Elixir restored.  
But after the original scatter, nature east, feeling west, firm and soft unmatched,  
If there be no regulating substance, communication broken off, each cut off from the other,  
They will never know one another.

The substance that regulates is the two soils wu and ji.  
Wu earth moves actively, belongs to yang; Ji earth is still, belongs to yin.  
Silent and unmoving is Ji earth; responsive and communicating is Wu earth.  
Wu and Ji earth correspond to true faith among the five virtues.  
True faith is central and nature settles; true settling applied outwardly makes feeling harmonious.  
Nature settled and feeling harmonious, nature and feeling return to the root, like husband and wife united in joy.  
Benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom all return to one faith;  
Nature, feeling, and spirit meet in one qi.  
Three families see one another, five qi attend the origin, return to origin and root,  
Golden Elixir condenses, also called the holy embryo;  
Then add the upward skill to enter non-action from action.  
Ten months of warm nurturing, firm and sealed,  
Drawing out excessive strong feelings, adding lacking compliant nature.  
Using true fire, morning gathering and evening obscure, refining away later heaven yin qi.  
From no substance comes substance, from subtle to manifest, qi sufficient and spirit complete.  
With a thunderclap the golden cicada sheds its shell;  
There is a body outside the body, success achieved and fame gained,  
Ascending to the northern palace to ride the phoenix,  
Soaring to pure yang immortality, is this not joy!

Alas! The original true nature is called the Golden Elixir,  
The four great elements are the furnace refining it into a pellet.  
He who awakens attains the saintly rank;  
He who is deluded sinks ten thousand kalpas.  
Those with aspiration, can they not strive?

### Verse Four

This method is true and subtle, yet more true,  
All because I alone differ from men.  
Knowing confusion comes from parting from water and fire,  
Who understands the fixed host and guest in floating rise and fall?  
The golden cauldron hopes to retain cinnabar and mercury,  
The jade pool first sinks the silver in water.  
Spirit’s work moves fire not all day,  
Manifesting deep pond’s daily sun.

The foregoing verse says that to refine the Golden Elixir,  
Nature and feeling must unite, and the five elements be complete,  
Then success is possible. But the medicine is easy to know, the fire and timing most difficult.  
Fire and timing are the stages of cultivation.  
Master Lü said: 'The highest virtue completes the form by the Way, it is the unbroken supreme yang;  
The lower virtue extends life by technique, relying on the already formed water and fire.'  
Those of lower virtue must use method and technique to attain it.  
Method is technique. Without method or technique one cannot return to the root and restore the source,  
The life foundation is unstable and the Great Way hard to complete.  
Therefore the Old Immortal said: 'This method is true and subtle, yet more true,  
All because I alone differ from men.'  
If the method be called true and subtle, it is the utmost true and subtle method;  
If the method be true, it can steal yin and yang, seize creation and transformation, reverse birth and death, and invert the qi mechanism.  
If the method be subtle, spirits and ghosts cannot fathom, yarrow stalks and tortoise shells cannot divine,  
Earlier heaven and heaven itself do not oppose it, later heaven complies with heaven’s time;  
This is the Way of saints and sages, not any other side-door or small method that can glimpse its bounds.  
Wherein lies the subtlety of refining the true method?  
In inversion alone.  
Inversion means inverting yin and yang, counteracting creation and transformation.

Water and fire: water is kan, dark outside and bright inside; fire is li, bright outside and dark inside.  
Fire’s inner darkness is true yin, man’s spiritual knowledge hidden in the human heart;  
The human heart moves and spiritual knowledge flies, like fire’s upper flame.  
Water’s inner brightness is true yang, man’s true knowledge residing in the Tao heart;  
The Tao heart hidden in darkness, true knowledge concealed, like water’s underflow.  
Using inversion is to produce the Tao heart and settle the human heart.  
When Tao heart arises, true knowledge is strong and vigorous, and the concentrated water rises;  
When human heart settles, spiritual knowledge is gentle and compliant, and the overblazing fire descends.  
Water above, fire below, water and fire mutually assist.  
Spiritual knowledge is nature, nature belongs to wood, wood’s nature is soft and floats easily.  
True knowledge is feeling, feeling belongs to metal; metal feeling is firm and sinks easily.  
Spiritual knowledge floats and acts as host, among the true there is false;  
True knowledge sinks and is unmanifest as guest, false hides true; this is the regular course.  
Settling the host and guest means to make true knowledge’s feeling the host, causing what sinks to rise;  
Make spiritual knowledge’s nature the guest, causing what floats to sink.  
Host and guest reverse repeatedly, and metal and wood meet.  
Water and fire mix, metal and wood unite.  
Tao heart strong, human heart compliant,  
True knowledge and spiritual knowledge combine, nature and feeling accord, how can Golden Elixir not form?  
But these true and subtle methods are neither form nor emptiness,  
They must be done in the place known to oneself alone and unknown to others, hence called self-knowledge and also who knows.  
No man knows and self knows, this is the theft of the secret.  
No one in the world can see it or know it.  
This Way has sequence and urgency; if one knows not the subtle use of sequence and urgency,  
Though one can recognize the medicine, inversion will be hard to apply and host and guest unstable.  
Therefore it is said: 'The golden cauldron hopes to retain cinnabar and mercury,  
The jade pool first sinks the silver in water.'

Gold is the firm and strong substance; jade is the gentle and soft substance;  
The cauldron is the object for refining medicine; the pool is for nurturing fire.  
The golden cauldron and jade pool symbolize the Way of True Cultivation, with firmness and softness as its body.  
The human heart belongs to li (fire), li is originally the gan (heavenly stem) body, thus the golden cauldron.  
It contains the fire of earth two as spiritual knowledge, the central thing of the kun family of gentleness and compliance, the original good ability.  
The human heart is originally empty, clear and bright,  
But upon mixing with later heaven discerning spirit, gives rise to delusion, seeing forms and stirring dust,  
Like mercury in cinnabar, flying when heated and hard to keep.  
The Cantong Qi calls this the sun flowing pearl, always attempting to leave man.  
The Tao heart belongs to kan (water), kan is originally the kun body, thus the jade pool.  
It contains the water of heaven one as true knowledge, the firm and upright thing of the kan palace, the original good knowledge.  
Because of falling into later heaven, guest qi acts, correct qi recedes, yang sinks into yin, true is disguised as false, immersed in the sea of desire, good knowledge obscure, like silver in water, almost lost and barely present.  
Silver belongs to metal class, silver in water is metal concealed in water.  
This metal in earlier heaven is original nature’s good knowledge; in later heaven is Tao heart’s true knowledge.  
Because of its true knowledge, most firm and vigorous, it is called true lead;  
Because of its true knowledge, becoming immortal and attaining the Way, it is called true seed.  
Ancient sages all took this great medicine to understand nature and life.

Though spiritual knowledge in the human heart moves easily,  
If governed by the Tao heart’s true knowledge, then spiritual knowledge returns to truth and does not flee;  
The Cantong Qi calls this finally obtaining golden splendour which then mutually supports another.  
The Yellow Crane Ode says: 'Within fire seven kinds of cinnabar; without the true seed it is hard to keep.'  
The seven cinnabars are tears, saliva, essence, fluid, qi, blood, and liquid.  
They are unstable because human heart’s spiritual knowledge is unstable.  
But human heart’s instability is because Tao heart is lost, and so unstable.  
If one wishes to keep spiritual knowledge of the human heart, one must first bring down the Tao heart’s true knowledge.  
Below true knowledge and true seed, there is a master, not confounded by mixed qi.  
Human heart’s spiritual knowledge naturally condenses and does not scatter.  
Using Tao heart to govern human heart, human heart obeys Tao heart,  
True knowledge controls spiritual knowledge, spiritual knowledge nourishes true knowledge.  
Firm and soft match, strong and compliant as one, nature and feeling harmonize,  
Within half a time it forms a bright perfect pearl, spirit light shining brightly.  
All yin and evil qi cannot harm it,  
Therefore it is said: 'Spirit work moves fire not all day,  
Manifesting deep pond’s daily sun.'

Spirit work means the spirit’s silent movement, the work of cautious solitude.  
Fire means true knowledge and spiritual knowledge, the harmonious qi of firm and soft united.  
Moving fire means being careful of what is unseen, fearing what is unheard.  
Moving this true knowledge and spiritual knowledge, firm and soft united,  
Not allowing a single dreg to remain in the heart.  
This spirit work of fire is like a pole standing out in the sun, a shout echoing through the valley.  
If one is willing, without waiting all day, one can return yang from yin,  
Like the sun rising on a deep pond, yin qi naturally recedes.  
The most important words in the poem are 'hope to retain' and 'first sink'.  
Within these is the meaning of preempting and controlling host and guest.  
To recognize this meaning is to invert yin and yang, harmonize the four images,  
Reverse the palm of the Yi, the other alchemical image.  
Outer elixir is another name for return elixir, because it has gone and comes again, lost and regained,  
Returning from the outside to the inside, hence called outer elixir or return elixir.  
When return is complete, it is inner elixir; this is the distinction of inner and outer.

### Verse Five

Tiger leaps and dragon soars, rough winds and waves,  
Central true position produces the mysterious pearl.  
If born on the branch, it will surely ripen,  
If the seed is in the belly, how can it differ?  
South and north sects invert the hexagram’s image,  
Morning and evening fire and timing unite the heavenly pivot.  
Know that great hermits live in the market,  
Why must one guard stillness alone in deep mountains?

The foregoing verse speaks of return elixir matters.  
This verse speaks of the great elixir Way.  
The great elixir Way is a timely功.  
This time unites with heaven and earth in virtue,  
With sun and moon in brightness,  
With the four seasons in sequence,  
With ghosts and spirits in fortune and misfortune.  
Hard to meet, easy to err,  
If not cautious, the earlier heaven true one qi is gained and lost again.  
Earlier heaven true one qi is the return elixir.  
Because of return elixir, it is the two qi of firm and soft joined.  
Therefore true one qi is not other than return elixir.  
When return elixir is attained, Tao heart is firm and vigorous, human heart gentle and compliant,  
True knowledge and spiritual knowledge are mixed into one, round and bright, shining clear.  
Still it is the beginning of life, good knowledge and good ability,  
Silent and unmoving, responding and communicating, the original face of things.  
This thing is called true lead because of its firm nature;  
Because of its vital qi, it is called the mighty tiger.  
True lead and mighty tiger are altogether a vast righteous qi, most good without evil,  
Holding the unchanging good knowledge and good ability of heaven’s truth.  
Having attained this truth again, one must restore this truth  
To the time before birth of parents, where the five elements do not reach,  
Then one can accomplish an eternal and imperishable heavenly truth.  
Therefore when truth is restored, warm and nurture it, seal it securely,  
Utmost emptiness and stillness, yang qi sufficient, stillness turns to movement,  
The spiritual seed appears; as Master Lü said, 'Middle sky leak eternal, warm warm lead cauldron, light shines through the curtain.'  
At this time the yang light emerges from the cave, mighty as a tiger, unstoppable,  
Quickly use the true nature’s hollow and spiritual fire to greet it.  
Hollow spiritual fire is called the female dragon.  
Tiger leaping and dragon soaring is the sign of yin and yang fighting and gathering.  
Rough winds and waves are tiger leaving the cave and wind arising, dragon leaving the pond and waves rising,  
The meaning of yin and yang contending.  
When dragon and tiger meet, nature and feeling unite, form one, enter the centre.  
The earlier heaven qi comes from emptiness, condenses into a millet grain,  
The holy embryo takes shape.  
The holy embryo is the valley spirit; the valley spirit is the spirit of the mysterious female joining as one.  
Yang mystery is tiger feeling, yin female is dragon nature.  
Nature and feeling unite and the holy embryo forms,  
The original female stands and the valley spirit lives.  
When reaching this place, acting is done and non-action appears,  
No need to make further effort, let it be natural.  
If born on a branch, it will surely ripen;  
If the seed is in the belly, it will surely be produced.  
But the holy embryo condensed, though requiring non-action,  
Still must have the skill of guarding against danger and trouble, must not be unknown.  
South and north sects invert the sealing image; south is fire, north is water.  
The holy embryo condenses, warm qi steams, water and fire return to their source,  
Cooking each other naturally, use no forgetting and no aiding.  
Morning and evening fire and timing unite the heavenly pivot; morning is the head of the day when yang qi acts,  
Evening is the head of the night when yin qi acts.  
The heavenly pivot is the mechanism of yin and yang qi, employing yang when yang is present, employing yin when yin is present.  
Fire and timing advance and retreat, secretly matching the morning and evening mechanism,  
The work of daily vigilance and nightly alertness.  
Do not forget, do not aid, daily vigilance and nightly alertness,  
Warm and nurture for ten months, change the later heaven hexagrams,  
Escape the earlier heaven Dharma body.  
My life is mine, not heaven’s.  
This Way is cultivated among humankind, done in worldly dust,  
Great scheme and function, real and practical功,  
Not empty non-action and quiet extinction study.  
Therefore it is said one must know: great hermits dwell in dusty markets,  
Why must one keep stillness alone in deep mountains?

### Verse Six

Everyone has the medicine of long life,  
Yet all deluded throw it away in vain.  
When sweet dew descends, heaven and earth unite,  
Where the yellow sprout grows, water and fire meet.  
The well frog may say there is no dragon’s cave,  
The fence sparrow may dispute the phoenix’s nest.  
When the elixir matures, gold fills the house;  
Why seek herbs or learn to burn straw?

The previous three verses on return elixir and great elixir, medicine and fire timing, are detailed and complete.  
But fearing students mistake the Golden Elixir as burnt mundane things,  
This verse follows closely to remind them.

The Golden Elixir is the original good knowledge and good ability of man’s nature.  
All have it, each perfect,  
In sages it does not increase, in commoners it does not decrease,  
No need to seek outside, it is naturally present.  
If willing, one straight ascends the holy city,  
Nature settles and life condenses, eternal and imperishable;  
This is the original good knowledge and ability, the great medicine of long life.  
All deluded men do not investigate the true principle of sages,  
Do not trace the root of nature and life,  
Abandon what is near and seek afar,  
Reject truth and accept falsehood,  
Waste their lives in vain,  
Till old age achieve nothing,  
Throw themselves away in vain,  
Is this not lamentable and sorrowful!

Man’s original good knowledge is the strong virtue, received from heaven, it is heaven;  
Original good ability is the compliant virtue, received from earth, it is earth;  
Original clear and bright spirit is spiritual nature, formed from earth’s qi, it is fire;  
Original pure and unmixed essence is true feeling, formed from heaven’s one qi, it is water.  
If man can be firm and compliant as one,  
Then heaven and earth unite in him, like sweet dew sprinkling the heart, troubles vanish.  
If man’s spirit is not exhausted,  
Then water and fire meet in him, like yellow sprouts growing, original qi restored.  
When sweet dew descends, the heart is clear;  
When yellow sprouts grow, the mind is still;  
Heart clear, mind still, good knowledge and ability, one spiritual true nature, suspended in empty space, silent and unmoving, responding and communicating, always appropriate and calm,  
Creation cannot shift, myriad things cannot bend,  
My life is mine, not heaven’s.  
The way of long life lies here;  
How can the well frog know of the dragon’s cave,  
How can the fence sparrow know the phoenix’s nest?  
Hearing of medicine and fire timing,  
They suspect it to be the straw-burning method, strange and absurd, doing all manner of things.  
Not knowing that when the great elixir matures, gold and jade fill the halls,  
Preserving life and integrity, wealth and rank beyond compare.  
All the mundane dregs and substances, what are they to be sought after?

### Verse Seven

To know where the medicine is born,  
Look only southwest to find the native place.  
Lead meets guǐ and must be gathered swiftly,  
Gold after full moon is not fit to taste.  
Send it back to the earthen cauldron, firmly sealed,  
Next enter the flowing pearl, paired and matched.  
The medicine weighs one jin, needing two eights,  
Adjust fire and timing, entrusting yin and yang.

The foregoing poem says everyone has the medicine of long life,  
But did not say where and when the medicine is born;  
Therefore this verse reveals the source and time of the medicine;  
Diligent students should always practice and be cautious of fire timing.

Southwest is the kun direction, where the month’s dark end revives,  
Where yin reaches its extreme and gives birth to yang,  
In humans this is the time of utmost stillness and first movement.  
This utmost stillness movement is when the great medicine appears.  
But the movement is not the external guest qi of passion and desire,  
Nor the internal heart thoughts and intentions,  
But the heavenly heart of good knowledge, the Tao heart of true knowledge.  
Heavenly heart good knowledge and Tao heart true knowledge,  
Because they transcend the mundane and enter the holy,  
Bring life from death, so they are likened to medicine;  
Because at utmost stillness, all conditions cease,  
Heavenly heart good knowledge and Tao heart true knowledge  
Show a little radiance revealing their hint,  
So they are likened to the place where medicine is born;  
Because heavenly heart good knowledge and Tao heart true knowledge  
Are white amid black, come from the void, movement born of stillness,  
Like a river having a source,  
Therefore they are likened to the source of the medicinal river.  
This medicine in earlier heaven is heavenly heart good knowledge,  
In later heaven it is Tao heart true knowledge.  
Tao heart is the shadow of heavenly heart;  
True knowledge is the shadow of good knowledge.  
Because heavenly heart sinks into later heaven, cannot always remain,  
Sometimes appears, sometimes does not, called Tao heart;  
Because good knowledge sinks into desire’s sea, light and qi darken,  
Sometimes bright, also called true knowledge.  
After returning, Tao heart is still heavenly heart, true knowledge is still good knowledge,  
Sometimes appears, sometimes bright, this is the native place of Tao heart and true knowledge.  
There is sometimes appearance and occasional brightness, with a little earlier heaven true one life energy remaining.  
Using this little life energy, cultivate in reverse,  
How difficult is it that from Tao heart and true knowledge one returns to heavenly heart and good knowledge?  
But to return is not difficult, one must know that stillness extreme leads to movement, the river source place.  
Laozi said: 'Achieve utmost emptiness, keep utmost stillness, all things arise together, I watch their return.'  
The Yi says: 'Return the Way, seven days come again.'  
All refer to this river source where Tao heart and true knowledge are born.

Knowing now the medicine’s river source,  
One must know when to begin.  
The subtle use of elixir cultivation is but to take the single taste of Tao heart as elixir mother,  
Because Tao heart is firm and vigorous, having true knowledge’s feeling,  
It is likened to true lead, lead containing silver, black outside white inside.  
Within Tao heart is true knowledge, clear outwardly,  
Therefore immortals compare Tao heart and true knowledge to true lead.  
Reluctant to point and explain openly,  
Zheng Zhizhong feared thieves might steal it.  
This Tao heart true knowledge is buried in passion and desire, deeply sunk, cannot emerge itself.  
Knowing the river source, one can gradually gather and return it.  
The method of return still seeks within passion and desire.  
True knowledge is born of heaven one, pure and very clear yang water, ren water.  
Passion and desire are born of earth six, dregs and turbid yin water, gui water.  
Ren water is hidden within gui water, not born of gui water, and not manifest; true lead unseen.  
Lead meets gui born means yin and yang qi meet, gui just born but not yet acting.  
Ren water not scattered, true knowledge not obscured, hasten to gather and return to the suspended embryo cauldron,  
Then passion and desire cannot act and will vanish.  
Zhang Sanfeng said: 'One must gather flowers blooming outside the wall.'  
Gold after full moon means once true knowledge returns,  
Borrowing this point of true feeling of true knowledge, increase and increase, enter firm and vigorous, pure essence.  
Like silver refined from lead, bright and clear in colour.  
At this place, good knowledge and good ability, bright and unclouded,  
Straight or bent responding to things, leaping and following without hindrance.  
Walking with confidence, every step right path,  
Like a full moon shining in the sky, illuminating the three thousand worlds,  
Reaching the hidden and the dark, able to work without additional功,  
Abandoning action to enter non-action.  
If one does not know fire timing, holding on to fullness without end,  
Perfect roundness must decline, brightness must turn to darkness,  
Like the moon after full, yang producing yin.  
True knowledge is harmed, the true obscured and false coming,  
All being later heaven dregs, how can one taste them?

Therefore when true knowledge is complete,  
Hasten to send it to the central earthen cauldron,  
Seal it firmly, not allowing a bit to leak,  
Again with a point of hollow spiritual flowing pearl from original nature to match,  
Borrow yin to aid yang, use emptiness to nourish substance,  
Guard against danger and misfortune.  
Expect to reach firm and soft as one, yin and yang balanced.  
Two eight numbers complete, not more nor less,  
Entering the mine to exhaust pure gold, without a trace of qi or substance.  
But to reach two eight complete, all depends on adjusting fire timing,  
Knowing old and young, knowing stop and suffice, discerning fortune and misfortune, recognizing urgency and leisure.  
When time to advance yang, then advance yang; when time to move yin, then move yin.  
Great and small without harm, both countries complete.  
Naturally earlier heaven true one qi comes from emptiness,  
Condensing without dispersal, the holy embryo takes shape.  
Adjusting and regulating fire timing is exactly by firm and soft not ceasing to regulate it.  
Medicine weighs one jin, firm and soft both return to upright,  
Two eight correspond, yin within yang and yang within yin,  
Yin and yang mixed, firm and soft all transformed, silent and unmoving, responding and communicating;  
Responding and communicating, silent and unmoving, eternally imperishable.  
Alas! The moon is full and preserved in the formula,  
When the time comes the mystery is transmitted in the heart.  
Medicine itself is hard to know, fire timing is also not easy to understand,  
May students not urgently seek a true master?  
This poem on medicine, fire timing, return elixir, great elixir subtle use, all included,  
Among the sixteen poems this is the most important.  
Readers must carefully study, not lightly let a word pass.  
If there is some understanding, then confirm a true master,  
By one word know all methods.

### Verse Eight

Cease refining the three yellows and four spirits,  
If seeking many herbs, still not true.  
When yin and yang find their types, then they communicate,  
Two eight correspond and naturally unite.  
At the pond bottom the red sun, yin monsters vanish,  
On the mountain top the white moon, medicine sprouts anew.  
People must know true lead and mercury,  
Not common sand or quicksilver.

This verse speaks of true lead and true mercury,  
The two medicines combined can accomplish the Golden Elixir.  
Yet some doubt that the Golden Elixir is a tangible thing of the world,  
Burnt and refined, so this verse follows closely to say:  
'Cease refining the three yellows and four spirits,  
If seeking many herbs, still not true.'  
The three yellows are litharge, realgar, and orpiment;  
The four spirits are cinnabar, quicksilver, lead, and saltpeter.  
The three yellows, four spirits, and many herbs are not of our kind,  
How can they receive life? How can they understand nature?  
Unable to receive life and understand nature, it is all vain, not the true Way.  
The Three Analogues say: 'Like kind easily applies功, unlike kind hard to功.'  
Man is born holding the two qi of heaven and earth,  
Within the body is the qi of yin and yang, the virtue of yin and yang.  
Yang is firm, yin is soft; firm virtue governs life, soft virtue governs nature.  
Yang firm and yin soft are the source of nature and life.  
Like kind means yang regards yin as kind, yin regards yang as kind.  
When yin and yang find their kind, firm and soft correspond,  
Like husband and wife long parted suddenly meeting, none fail to communicate.  
Two eight means yang within yin is true yang, firm and vigorous and upright;  
Yang within yin is true yin, soft and compliant and upright.  
Firm and soft both return to upright, yin and yang correspond,  
Neither bias nor lean, naturally unite and are close, fused into one qi, condensing and not dispersing.

When yin and yang find their kind, two eight correspond,  
Later heaven returning to earlier heaven, Tao heart firm and vigorous, human heart soft and compliant,  
True knowledge and spiritual knowledge unite,  
The one point of original good knowledge and ability appears from no thought.  
Like the red sun rising from pond bottom, yin monsters vanish;  
Like the crescent moon hanging high on mountain top, medicine sprouts fresh.  
Because correct qi is born, evil qi naturally recedes,  
True reappears and false disappears.  
Pond bottom red sun, mountain top white moon,  
Both depict true yang appearing, heavenly heart again seen.  
Heavenly heart again seen, knowledge and ability both good,  
This is called Golden Elixir.  
This Golden Elixir is our original true yin and true yang,  
Firm and soft combined into a net,  
The true treasure of nature to life,  
How can it be mundane sand and quicksilver refined?

### Verse Nine

Within yang is yin essence lacking firmness,  
Cultivating only one thing turns frail and weak.  
Laboring body and pressing shadow is not the Way,  
Taking in qi and eating rosy clouds is all madness.  
The world vainly seeks to subdue lead and mercury,  
When will the dragon and tiger be subdued?  
I urge you to grasp the place of birth,  
Return to root and source, this is the king of medicines.

This verse says the Golden Elixir is not the external three yellows and four spirits, nor common herbs and things;  
Therefore cultivators must cultivate within the body alone.  
Little do they know, after losing earlier heaven true yang,  
What remains in the body is yin essence within yang.  
Yin essence is not only the essence of mutual communication.  
All tears, saliva, fluids, blood, qi, are yin essence.  
Its nature is not firm; if the body exists it exists, if the body dies it dies,  
Following illusory form’s existence and non-existence.  
If cultivating this yin essence within yang alone, wanting to preserve life and integrity,  
One only feels weak and frail; the matter can hardly succeed.  
The world’s laboring body and pressing shadow, taking qi and enjoying rosy clouds,  
Are not refining yin essence, or supplementing yin essence,  
And are distant from the Way, the more they cultivate the farther
