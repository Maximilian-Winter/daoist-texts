Sixty-four quatrains in seven-character verse, following the sixty-four hexagrams of the Zhou Yi.

### On the Cauldron and Furnace: Two Poems

The First

First take Heaven and Earth as the cauldron and vessel; next seek the medicine of the Black Rabbit to cook.  
Once the two things are driven back to the Yellow Way, how can the Golden Elixir fail to be born?

Heaven (Qian) is strength; its image is taken as that of the sky; Earth (Kun) is submission; its image is taken as that of the earth. In man, they represent the natures of firmness and gentleness. The sun’s center has a black spot, being Yin within Yang; in the hexagrams it is Li, which is Yang without and Yin within; its inner Yin is the true Yin, the spiritual knowledge hidden in the human heart. The moon has a rabbit, being Yang within Yin; in the hexagrams it is Kan, which is Yin without and Yang within; its inner Yang is the true Yang, the true knowledge possessed by the Way-heart of man.

To first take Heaven and Earth as the cauldron and vessel, is to employ firmness and gentleness as the body of the Elixir’s making. Next to seek the medicine of the Black Rabbit to cook, is to use true knowledge and spiritual knowledge as the means of the Elixir’s making. To refine true knowledge without falsehood is to bring firmness to the central rectitude; to refine spiritual knowledge without error is to bring gentleness to the central rectitude. When firmness and gentleness both return to the central rectitude, the Way-heart strengthens, the human heart submits; true knowledge and spiritual knowledge unite as one, as when driving the Black Rabbit back to the Yellow Way. The Yellow Way is the middle Way, the path of the sun’s course. The moon travels nine ways; these nine ways are the four ways of blue, vermilion, white, and black, each doubled, making eight beyond the Yellow Way; the moon and sun meet, their paths intersect and form nine ways. The meeting place of sun and moon is called the return of the two things to the Yellow Way. At man’s birth, there is but one nature of good knowledge and good ability, pure spirit; there is yet no human heart, nor Way-heart. After intercourse, human heart and Way-heart divide, and the distinction of true and spiritual knowledge arises.

The human heart is all that moves with perception; perception is spiritual knowledge. The Way-heart is all that is not deluded by circumstances; non-delusion is true knowledge. The human heart can only possess spiritual knowledge, not true knowledge; its nature is soft, therefore it is called Yin. The Way-heart possesses true knowledge and also spiritual knowledge; its qi is firm, therefore it is called Yang. Though the sage has a human heart, so also the common man has a Way-heart. The sage has a human heart because he cannot extinguish perception; the common man has a Way-heart because there is a place within him not darkened. The difference of sage and common man is that true spirit is one, with knowledge and perception, able always to be undarkened. The common man is separated in true spirit, having knowledge and perception, yet cannot but be darkened. Moreover, the human heart has the spirit of cognition hidden within; cognition borrows spirit and produces falsehood, seeing appearances and producing emotions, like waves blown by wind; the spirit returns to the false, and the human heart is in peril.

The human heart is in peril; evil qi grows strong and right qi grows weak; the Way-heart is not manifest, and the Way-heart is but faint. Cultivate the Way and refine the Way-heart’s true knowledge of firmness, returning to the central rectitude; temper the human heart’s spiritual knowledge of gentleness, returning to the central rectitude. The coming together of firmness and gentleness, strength and submission, the one essence and the one spirit, holding to the middle, good knowledge and good ability, the natural principle flowing as one qi — how can the Golden Elixir fail to be born? The Golden Elixir is the congealing of the two qi, firmness and gentleness; true and spiritual knowledge returning to the central rectitude, Heaven and man mingling as one, like a precious pearl suspended in empty space, illuminating everywhere. The Golden Elixir has form, rising from subtlety and growing from birth to ripeness; how can it fail to liberate?

The Second

Fixing the furnace and setting the cauldron is by the law of Heaven and Earth; refining essence and spirit to make soul and spirit.  
Gathering and dispersing vaporous clouds form transformation; dare one treat the profound mysteries lightly?

The furnace is for producing fire, the cauldron for refining medicine. The Way of the Golden Elixir follows the Earth’s gentleness as the furnace, proceeding step by step; it follows Heaven’s firmness as the cauldron, fiercely cooking and hastily refining. Able to be firm and gentle, able to be strong and submissive; with determined intention, the longer the better; firm and fixed, unmoved and unshaken; able thus to gather medicine and produce fire. The human heart’s spiritual knowledge is outer Yang and inner Yin, like the sun’s essence, the sun’s essence shining outward; the Way-heart’s true knowledge is like the moon’s radiance, hidden within. Spiritual knowledge, outer Yang, belongs to the soul; true knowledge, outer Yin, belongs to the spirit. Spiritual knowledge is essence of soul — that which is spiritual in spirit; true knowledge is the radiance of spirit — that which is spirit in spirit. Spiritual spirit contains falsehood; spirit that is not spirit contains truth within falsehood. Refining essence and spirit is to remove falsehood from true spiritual knowledge of the human heart, and to bring forth truth from the false of the Way-heart. When false spirit is removed and true spirit fixed, the soul does not fly away but is controlled; when true knowledge appears and false knowledge is extinguished, the spirit does not scatter but is controlled. When soul and spirit are controlled, true and spiritual knowledge, nature and character unite, condensing as one qi; vapour and mist blend and harmonize, gathering and dispersing in transformation, silent and unmoving, yet responsive and thus communicating; each step and every movement is the heavenly secret. This mystery is beyond words and description.

### On the Waning Moon Furnace: Two Poems

The Third

In vain to toil at the furnace of elixir; to refine medicine, seek the waning moon furnace.  
There is a natural true fire and time; no need for firewood, charcoal, or blowing.

The Waning Moon appears on the third day of each month, showing a hook of light in the Earth (Kun) direction; its light wanes and rises, hence called the Waning Moon. In man, it signifies utmost quietude, with a single point of Yang light revealed, like the Waning Moon; in the hexagrams it is Zhen — "On the third day the thunder emerges in Geng, by the curved riverbank the moonlight shines bright." This single ray of Yang light is none other than the Way-heart’s light. The difficulty in the Way of the Elixir is the Way-heart. When the Way-heart appears, the heavenly principle shines forth, firmness gradually stirs; mountains, rivers, and earth become all spiritual medicine, taken at hand, and everything is in accord. Medicine is fire, fire is medicine; there is a natural furnace of creation and transformation, a true fire, wherefore need there be stoking of the furnace with firewood, charcoal, or blowing?

The Fourth

In the Waning Moon furnace, the jade pistil grows; in the cinnabar cauldron, mercury lies level.  
Only after the fire’s power is harmonized can the yellow sprout be planted and grow.

The Waning Moon furnace is the Way-heart mentioned before. The jade pistil — jade is gentle and belongs to Yin; pistil is luminous and belongs to Yang. The jade pistil is Yang within Yin, symbolizing the true knowledge of the Way-heart. The cinnabar cauldron symbolizes the human heart. Mercury is a flowing and unstable substance, belonging to Yin, that is Yang within Yin, symbolizing the spiritual knowledge of the human heart. The Way-heart always manifests, true knowledge is undarkened, and the spiritual knowledge of the human heart naturally becomes calm, unable to soar; next employ the power of harmonization, using the true fire of the Way-heart to refine away the false spirituality of the human heart and return it to empty spirit. Heaven and man act as one; true and spiritual knowledge unite as one; knowledge arrives and intention is sincere — this is called the Yellow Sprout. The Yellow Sprout is the seed of true spirit; its spirit nourished by the earth’s warmth, like grass in the soil; a sprout with yellow colour, hence the name Yellow Sprout. True and spiritual knowledge, after the fire’s power is harmonized, return to the central rectitude and enter the upper central cauldron; with further nurturing by true intention, after ten months of qi, it naturally matures and liberates.

### On True Lead: Four Poems

The Fifth

To swallow saliva and receive qi is the way of man; only when there is substance can creation and transformation proceed.  
If there be no true seed in the cauldron, it is as if boiling water and fire in an empty vessel.

The Way-heart’s true knowledge possesses the innate true and one qi. It is symbolized by lead, the true seed of sages and worthies, the seed of those who become Buddhas and immortals. To cultivate the Great Elixir, this true seed must not be forsaken; there is nothing else. Worldly men deluded embrace merely the body, tangible and visible; swallowing saliva and receiving qi, they claim cultivation, unaware that all the body produces is the dregs of the later heaven, how can this bring forth the Elixir of innate spirit and sanctity? This is as if the cauldron has no true seed, but is boiling only water and fire in an empty vessel.

The Sixth

To harmonize lead and mercury is to complete the Elixir; neither great nor small do they harm, both nations intact.  
If you ask what true lead is, the toad’s light shines all day over the western streams.

The Golden Elixir is formed from the Way-heart’s true knowledge, the true lead, and the human heart’s spiritual knowledge, the true mercury. To cultivate the Golden Elixir, first adjust lead and mercury. The Way-heart is firm and belongs to Yang, being large; the human heart is soft and belongs to Yin, being small. Without the Way-heart, the human heart borrows spirit to produce falsehood and can ruin the Way; if controlled by the Way-heart, clarity and undarkening assists the Way. The Way-heart is indispensable, but the human heart must not be extinguished; only prevent the human heart from falsely using its spirit. The ancients taught to kill the false spirit of the human heart, not to kill its true spirit. If one does not distinguish true from false and kills all, then one falls into the teaching of stubborn emptiness and extinction. To injure the small is to harm the great; Yin and Yang separated, life force and breath broken, how can the Great Elixir and the Great Way be made? Hence it is said “Neither great nor small hurt, both nations intact.” Both nations intact are the human heart’s spiritual knowledge and the Way-heart’s true knowledge, united as one; true knowledge governs spiritual knowledge, spiritual knowledge conforms to true knowledge; the true spirit does not scatter, good knowledge and good ability remain, the heavenly principle is complete, the original nature fully clear, and the Golden Elixir is formed.

True knowledge and spiritual knowledge are the totality of good knowledge and good ability; in the innate they are called good knowledge and good ability, in the later heaven they are called true knowledge and spiritual knowledge. To return from the later heaven to the innate, true knowledge is good knowledge, spiritual knowledge is good ability. True and spiritual knowledge were originally one family, no difference. Through intercourse with later heaven, a point of innate good knowledge is lost outside, belonging to another family; the good ability of our own family’s spirit is mixed and impure, shifting and unstable. To return to the root and restore the origin, one must seek out a trace of truth in the false knowledge and bring it back to our own family, so that spiritual knowledge is undarkened. This true knowledge is firm and strong, symbolized as true lead. True knowledge has the innate true and one qi, also symbolized as gold in water and light in the moon. Gold in water and light in the moon signify Yang within Yin. But this true knowledge before return remains in another family, not ours, hence the toad’s light shines all day over the western streams. The moon has a golden toad; the toad’s light is the moon’s light, symbolizing true knowledge which is dark outside but bright within. It shines all day to the west but not to the east, clearly illuminating that side. The immortal’s later poem says: “Golden sir is originally the son of the East House, sent to the Western Neighbour as a fosterling.” This exactly means the toad’s light shining all day over the western streams. If the student can truly know that the toad’s light shines all day over the western streams, it is indeed to know the whereabouts of true knowledge, then it can shine to the east and meet spiritual knowledge. Alas! To follow death is to perish; to oppose death is to live — often it teaches men to seek in vain, how easy is it to know true knowledge?

The Seventh

Before refining the return Elixir, do not enter the mountain; inside and outside the mountain there is no lead.  
Such a supreme treasure is found in every family, but fools do not fully recognize it.

To avoid the world and leave the dust, to enter the mountains and cultivate stillness, is a matter for after the Elixir’s return. The ignorant enter mountains and cultivate stillness, thinking it grants longevity. The Way of longevity requires the one true lead for effect. But true lead must be sought in the world of dust. If one enters the mountains to cultivate, inside and outside the mountains all is Yin qi; how can true lead, the utmost Yang, be found there? True lead is the innate spiritual root, also called Heaven’s root, also called the essence and qi of true oneness, also called lead in the water, gold in the water, white in black, soul in spirit, black tiger, golden sir, the immortal formula of another family. The ancients took many images, converging on reality — it is but an image of the Way-heart.

This Way-heart, when manifest, is the wondrous true knowledge; when hidden, it is the pure true void; every person possesses it, each is perfect and complete; among sages it is not increased, among commoners it is not diminished; every family has it. Yet though every family has it, it is not their own; for it cannot be seen nor used. Because every family has it but it is not their own, fools meet it but fail to recognize it; they pass it by face to face. At the end of the Ming dynasty Peng Haogu did not grasp this truth, taking the phrase “every family has it” to mean the female cauldron. More recently Zhi Jizi annotated and commented with the “Three Peaks Collection,” thus confusing and misleading later students to great fault.

The Eighth

When bamboo breaks, one must mend it with bamboo; to hatch chicks one must use eggs.  
All else unlike is but vain labour; how much better to combine true lead with the holy mechanism.

Bamboo breaks and bamboo mends; to hatch chicks one must use eggs, a similitude. The “Three Similarities” says: “Like kinds are easy to apply effort to, unlike kinds are hard to make skillful.” If it is not of the like kind, it is not a true seed; all other efforts are vain labour. The Great Way of the Golden Elixir is the work of sages. To learn of sages, one must seek the seed of sages, the true lead of true knowledge. With this true knowledge cultivating the Great Way, none fail to match the sages’ mechanism. The sage’s mechanism is the unmingled heavenly principle; true knowledge is without not knowing and without falsehood, able to restore the heavenly principle; hence it is called to combine with the sage’s mechanism. Once combined with the sage’s mechanism, one is a sage; how is it that students will not submit their hearts?

### On the Use of Lead

The Ninth

Empty heart and solid belly, both profound in meaning; only the empty heart needs to recognize the heart.  
Better to refine lead and first solidify the belly, and so gather up a hall of gold.

The Way of the Golden Elixir is empty heart and solid belly, two undertakings. Empty heart is to empty the human heart, the work of cultivating nature; solid belly is to solidify the Way-heart, the work of cultivating life. Empty heart and solid belly open nature and life; their meaning is profound. To empty the heart one must know the heart. The heart includes the human heart and the Way-heart. The human heart should be empty, not solid; the Way-heart should be solid, not empty. If one does not distinguish true from false heart, and empties all, not only is life not understood, but nature is not understood. To recognize the heart, one need not empty the human heart, but must first refine the Way-heart of true lead to solidify the belly. When the belly is solid, meaning gathers and arises, the guest qi naturally disperses and the human heart naturally empties. The four images harmonize, the five phases accumulate; gold and jade fill the hall; the treasure of life arrives at hand; one can empty the human heart and nurture the Way-heart, understand the nature’s root, and return to the land of no-where.

### On Not Using Lead

The Tenth

Using lead, do not use common lead; using true lead, also cast it away.  
This is the true mystery of using lead; to use lead but not use it is truly spoken.

The method of Elixir cultivation depends on taking true lead as the principal. But lead is not one: there is common lead and there is true lead. Common lead comes from the mountains; it is tangible and turbid, unrelated to us. True lead is stored and produced in the home; it is intangible Way-heart, of our own kind. Since antiquity, the highest immortals who transcend the ordinary and enter the sagehood rely on the power of true lead of the Way-heart; hence it is said, “Using lead does not mean common lead.” But though the Way-heart is the innate true treasure, it arises from the later heaven; there are times to use it and times not to use it. Before the Elixir is formed, one must borrow the true knowledge of the Way-heart to control the spiritual knowledge of the human heart. When the human heart is fixed, spiritual knowledge undarkened, Way-heart and human heart move and rest as one; true and spiritual knowledge correspond to void and substance; the sacred embryo is formed; then it is urgent to withdraw the firmness of the Way-heart and gently nurture the embryo’s breath. The use of the Way-heart is to control the human heart; when the human heart is calm, the spirit of cognition is extinguished; good knowledge and good ability are still and unmoving; responsive and thus communicating; true spirit alone remains, bright and undarkened. The Way-heart is no longer used; it is able to be and not to be, and all things return to emptiness. Lu Ziye said: “The method of using lead is like a fishnet or rabbit trap.” Fish and rabbits depend on the net and trap to be caught; once caught, the net and trap are useless. The mystery of using lead lies just here. If one does not know the secret of using lead, when the Elixir is formed yet still employs the Way-heart, inevitably the Way-heart is used but the human heart arises again; the true spirit scatters, the Golden Elixir is gained and lost again; hence it is said “Using true lead but casting it away.” The secret of using lead but not using it can be understood from this.

### On Lead and Mercury

The Eleventh

Dreaming to visit West Flower and reaching the Ninth Heaven, the Perfected One gave me the Treatise on Originality.  
Within it is simple and easy, no many words; it only teaches men to refine mercury and lead.

The Great Way of the Golden Elixir is most simple and easy, with no many words, only refining the Way-heart’s true knowledge and the human heart’s spiritual knowledge. When the Way-heart’s firmness returns to central rectitude, the Way-heart remains; by true knowledge it controls spiritual knowledge. When the human heart’s gentleness returns to central rectitude, the human heart remains calm; by spiritual knowledge it cherishes true knowledge. Firmness and gentleness correspond; true and spiritual spirits unite; this is called lead and mercury joining and the Golden Elixir congealing. The method is most simple and easy, brief and not complex; even common people can thereby rise to sagehood. But many lack great virtue and fortune, and cannot easily attain it. If one has great virtue and fortune, and meets a Perfected One who points out the simple and wonderful method, it is like waking from sleep, knowing that the great medicine is in oneself and not elsewhere; picking it up at hand, all is as wished. The immortal spoke of dreaming of West Flower as a teaching with profound meaning, not mere words; West Flower being the place where true gold is produced. Flower is the brightness of true gold. The Ninth Heaven is the realm of pure Yang without Yin. True gold is the image of true knowledge. In darkness, suddenly true Yang light appears; taking this true knowledge back to our family, uniting with spiritual knowledge, refining by fire until reaching the pure Yang without Yin realm, called the Seven Returns and Nine Reversions; the golden liquid Great Elixir — is it indeed but a dream?

### On the One Qi from Emptiness and Nothingness

The Twelfth

The Way from Emptiness and Nothingness produces one qi; from one qi arise Yin and Yang.  
Yin and Yang again unite to form three bodies; the three bodies renew and produce myriad things.

The Way of nature and life, the Way of creation, is the Way of ceaseless birth and death. Tracing its origin, it arises from Emptiness and Nothingness and produces one qi; from one qi are born Heaven and Earth, Yin and Yang; Yin and Yang again unite therein, containing one qi and forming three bodies. Once the three bodies are formed, one qi moves, Yin then Yang, Yang then Yin, thus myriad things are born. Like the growth of grass and trees, first a bud springs from the earth — this is the one qi born from Emptiness and Nothingness; then it breaks earth and opens two petals — this is Yin and Yang produced from one qi; then from between two petals a stalk shoots — Yin and Yang unite to form three bodies; thence branches and leaves grow — the three bodies give birth to myriad things. Heaven and Earth know that all things, sentient and insentient, arise from this Emptiness and Nothingness and One Qi, all following the Way of creation. If the cultivator knows to follow the Way of creation, and yet cultivates against it, returning myriad to three, three to two, two to one, one to Emptiness, then silence and scentlessness are attained.

### On Kan and Li

The Thirteenth

Kan is thunder and lightning cooking the gold-water formula; fire is kindled on Kunlun, Yin and Yang.  
If the two things again unite and harmonize, naturally the Elixir ripens, the fragrant body all over.

Kan and thunder are the image of fire in water, likened to the Way-heart’s true knowledge, discovered in darkest places; the place of discovery is one’s living seed. Cooking and rumbling are images of uncertainty. The gold-water formula is the Way-heart’s true knowledge, the essence and oneness of true feeling, containing both gold and water qi. Kunlun in the west is the ancestor of myriad mountains, the place where true gold is produced. When the Way-heart’s true knowledge emits in the darkest place, like flashing lightning, sudden brightness and darkness, wavering and uncertain, difficult to keep and easy to lose, one must quickly employ the fire of Li’s empty spirit to welcome it; then true and spiritual knowledge, character and nature, love each other, Yin and Yang unite; there arises the innate spiritual medicine, turning to the natural true fire, refining away later heaven’s turbidity, pure gold sans ore; the Golden Elixir ripens, swallowing and taking it one’s bones change, the pure body appears; fragrant wind fills the world — how much more than fragrant body alone!

### On Wu and Ji

The Fourteenth

If Li and Kan do not have Wu and Ji, though containing the four images, no Elixir is made.  
Only because each holds true earth, does the Golden Elixir have return and reversal.

Kan is water, in man the primal essence, issuing in wisdom; gold hidden in water is, in man, true feeling, issuing in righteousness. Li is fire, in man the primal spirit, issuing in propriety; fire born of wood, in man the primal nature, issuing in benevolence. The Way-heart has the image of Kan; the human heart has the image of Li; Way-heart and human heart have the four natures of metal, wood, water, and fire. But the four natures are distinct; to cause one qi to be generated depends on the work of Wu and Ji. Wu is Yang earth, the primal qi, issuing in faith; Ji is Yin earth, intention, issuing in desire. Kan receiving Wu in the Way-heart is faith; Li receiving Ji in the human heart is intention. To correct the heart, first make intention sincere; when intention is sincere, Ji earth is settled and the human heart is calm. To walk the Way, first establish faith; when faith is established, Wu earth appears and the Way-heart manifests. If the Way-heart lacks faith, the human heart is not sincere, though there be benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom, they do not regard each other; the stored nature, feeling, and spirit oppose each other; how can the supreme spirit and holy Elixir be made? Hence the cultivator must make sincerity of intention and establish faith the chief task; when intention and faith are established, the Way-heart manifests, the human heart is right, both harmonize and respond, Yin and Yang correspond; the innate qi comes from Emptiness and Nothingness, condenses and becomes a grain of millet. When dispersed, it again gathers; when gone, it again returns. Hence it is said, “Only because each holds true earth, does the Golden Elixir have return and reversal.” The work of Wu and Ji is great indeed.

### On Reversing Kan and Li

The Fifteenth

The sun dwelling in Li’s place is turned female; Kan matched to the Toad Palace is yet male.  
If one does not understand the meaning of this reversal, do not speak arrogantly with narrow views.

The sun dwelling in Li’s place (one text has Li dwelling in the sun’s place) — spiritual knowledge is originally Yang, but brightness is external and darkness internal, each attracting guest qi. When the sun dwells in Li’s place, it is Yang outside and Yin inside, thus turned female. True knowledge is originally Yin, but external darkness and internal brightness, possessing correct qi. When Kan is matched to the Toad Palace, it is Yin outside and Yang inside, yet male. The human heart born of later heaven borrows spirit and produces falsehood; the Way-heart’s innate truth is hidden; it is as if the woman is chief and the man has abdicated.

The Way of Elixir is to use the Way-heart’s true knowledge to control the human heart’s spiritual knowledge; to use the human heart’s spiritual knowledge to conform to the Way-heart’s true knowledge. Male is firm, female is gentle; the man rules, the woman obeys; no great matter is ever unaccomplished. If one does not understand this reversal, one does not recognize the Way-heart’s true knowledge nor the human heart’s spiritual knowledge; one is confused and mixed, both taking falsehood as true. Do not arrogantly discuss with narrow views, deceiving self and others.

The Sixteenth

Take the solid heart within Kan, and illumine the Yin within Li’s belly;  
From this change arises the firm body of Qian, hidden and soaring all by the heart.

All by (one text “entirely by”, another “moreover by”)  
The solid heart in Kan is the Way-heart’s true knowledge; the Yin in Li’s belly is the human heart’s spiritual knowledge. Take out the true Way-heart of Kan, and illumine the spiritual human heart of Li. In an instant, Yin energy is consumed and Yang energy returns; the original face of Qian is revealed; our good knowledge and good ability nature restored; silent and unmoving, responsive and thus communicating; responsive and communicating, silent and unmoving. Therefore it is said, “From this arises the firm body of Qian, hidden and soaring all by the heart.” The body is not the phantom body’s form, but the true body of the Dharma-body. The Dharma-body is original nature. At man’s birth, a point of true spirit nature, round and bright, firm and upright, pure with no dregs. Like the three wonders of Qian hexagram, a symbol of pure Yang with no Yin; after intercourse with later heaven, innate goodness is dimmed, spiritual qi false; as in Qian hexagram, the void produces Li, the solid produces Kan in the Kun hexagram. The void within is the departing true; the solid within is the trapped true. To take Kan to fill Li is to return to innate truth, to restore the original true spirit nature of the day before; as Li is sealed and again transformed to Qian. When true spirit is restored, the master is in hand; always responding and always pure; moving left or right, nothing is inappropriate; hidden and soaring — how can it not be all by the heart? Later generations who do not understand this, take “to take Kan to fill Li” to mean taking kidney qi to mingle with the heart; or after taking kidney qi, rising and then falling to lodge in the crimson palace. Alas! Strange, strange indeed! The heart and kidney are not Kan and Li. To take Kan and Li as heart and kidney is extreme folly.

### On the Five Phases

The Seventeenth

The dragon mercury comes from the Li place; the tiger lead is born in the Kan direction.  
The two things arise from child producing mother; the Five Phases altogether must enter the centre.

“Arising from” (one text “emerging from”)  
Zhen is the dragon, the wood mercury; Dui is the tiger, the metal lead. Li is fire; Kan is water. The dragon mercury arises from Li place, wood arising in fire; the tiger lead is born in Kan place, metal born in water. The wood born of fire is ever an imperishable wood; the metal born of water is ever an uncorrupted metal. Wood produces fire, and fire in turn produces wood; metal produces water, and water in turn produces metal — this is called child producing mother. The ancient classics say: "When the Five Phases do not proceed in order, the dragon comes forth from the fire; when the Five Phases are reversed, the tiger is born in water." Man’s qi nature is unstable, like the mercury’s floating nature; if the primordial spirit’s fire refines away the dregs, the qi nature transforms and true nature appears, ever unmoving. Man’s false emotions are heavy, like the lead’s sinking nature; if the pure water cleans away the dust, false emotions vanish and true feelings condense, ever emotionless. Not only this, when qi and nature transform, there is no nature fire; spirit of cognition extinguished and primordial spirit always born; desires vanish, no lustful thought; turbid essence transformed and primordial essence without leak. True nature appears, true feeling condenses, primordial spirit born, primordial essence firm. Nature, feeling, and spirit return to one qi; benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom return to one faith — this is called the perfection of the Five Phases. When the Five Phases are perfected and united, it is one in the whole; this is called the Five Phases entering the centre. If the Five Phases are lacking east or west, lost south or north, separately seeking medicines, then how is it possible to cultivate and complete the Golden Elixir? The line in the poem “the Five Phases altogether must enter the centre” is the point of concern. If the Five Phases do not enter the centre, then they are scattered and the Golden Elixir does not form. If the Five Phases enter the centre, then the Five Phases become one qi and the Golden Elixir is naturally formed; should the student not first understand the Five Phases?

### On the Two Strings

The Eighteenth

The moon has just the half-wheel bright on the horizon; already the dragon’s roar and tiger’s growl sound.  
It is well to apply effort to cultivate the two eights; within one hour the Elixir will be complete.

The Golden Elixir is the dragon nature and tiger feeling, the two-string qi joined. First take the upper string’s metal eight taels as the Elixir’s mother; next take the lower string’s wood half a catty to complete the sacred embryo. What are the two strings? The moon from the third day has Yang born; to the eighth day there is Yang within Yin, half a “G”, its flatness like a string, resembling a bow string “D”; because its Yang light is above, it is called the upper string. The full moon at the fifteenth day is “O”; the sixteenth day is one Yin embryo; the eighteenth day is one Yin manifest; by the twenty-third day, half a Yin within Yang “D”, flat as a string and like a bow string “G”; because its Yang light is below, it is called the lower string. The moon’s Yang light comes from the west, the tiger belongs to metal, metal is in the west; thus the eighth day of the moon is the tiger’s string qi. The moon’s Yin body comes from the east, the dragon belongs to water, wood is in the east; thus the twenty-third day of the moon is the dragon’s string qi. The true knowledge’s feeling is firm, symbolized by the tiger, like the Yang light of the moon; the spiritual knowledge’s nature is gentle, symbolized by the dragon, like the moon’s Yin body. True knowledge’s firm feeling advances to central rectitude, like the Yang light born of the moon’s upper string, being metal eight taels; spiritual knowledge’s gentle nature retreats to central rectitude, like the Yin body receding in the moon’s lower string, wood eight taels. When the moon has just the half-wheel bright on the horizon, this is the time true knowledge’s firm feeling advances to central rectitude. When true knowledge advances to central rectitude, gentleness contains firmness; spiritual knowledge is controlled by true knowledge and cannot soar; Yang rules Yin and Yin submits to Yang; thus there is the effect of dragon’s roar and tiger’s growl, the same voice responding, the same qi seeking each other. At this time, it is well to apply effort to cultivate, using Yang to help Yin, making spiritual knowledge gentle and also returning to central rectitude. Spiritual knowledge returning to central rectitude, gentleness within firmness; true knowledge and spiritual knowledge both return to central rectitude; the two eights of the two strings are sufficient, Yin and Yang correspond, firmness and gentleness are as one; within one hour the Elixir will be complete. But if the two eights are not sufficient, whether too much Yang and too little Yin, or too little Yang and too much Yin, none can complete the Elixir. Only when Yin and Yang are balanced and neither偏 nor倚, called central rectitude, can the Elixir be completed within one hour. The work of one hour is not easily attained; if not practiced for many years, one cannot suddenly reach this state.

### On Harmonization

The Nineteenth

On Mount Hua’s cliff the mighty tiger roars; beneath Fusang’s sea the female dragon moans.  
Yellow Granny herself understands the match, sending them to be husband and wife with one heart.

Mount Hua is in the west, Fusang in the east; tiger is metal feeling, dragon is wood nature; at birth, nature is originally united, metal and wood together; after intercourse with later heaven, falsehood arrives and truth is darkened; nature and feeling divide, as dragon to east and tiger to west. The tiger called mighty is metal feeling firm; the dragon called female is wood nature gentle. Yet though true feeling is separated by false feeling, true nature covered by false abode, true feeling and true nature always desire to meet. Mountain-top tiger roars, sea-bottom female dragon moans; Yin and Yang are separated, but secretly connect — separation and secret connection — able to meet, yet without harmonizing substance, so they cannot unite. Yellow Granny is also called True Earth, also True Intention, also Faith. When true faith appears, intention is sincere and heart is right; falsehood leaves and truth comes; feeling returns to nature; in a moment nature and feeling unite, like matchmakers communicating between two families, sending them to be husband and wife with one heart.

The Twentieth

The red dragon and black tiger dwell each west and east; the four images meet in Wu and Ji.  
From here Fuxu can operate and employ; who says the Golden Elixir is not accomplished?

Wood can produce fire; fire and wood are one family, hence called red dragon; metal can produce water; metal and water one family, hence called black tiger. Metal, wood, water, and fire are the four images; Wu and Ji are earth; earth can harmonize the four images; the four images plus earth are the Five Phases. But when the Five Phases proceed in order, it is the law of the fire pit of the Dharma Realm; when reversed, it is the Seven Treasures of the great earth; it depends on man’s operation. The Way-heart’s true knowledge’s feeling moves, called “return”; the law is to advance Yang fire to make the Elixir; the human heart’s spiritual knowledge’s nature is still, called “meeting”; the law is to retreat Yin charmed to nurture. When the time is to use Yang, use Yang; when the time is to use Yin, use Yin. Yang firm and Yin submissive, use nine and six according to time; true knowledge and spiritual knowledge unite as one and enter the centre; the Five Phases gather and cluster; the Golden Elixir accomplishes itself naturally.

### On Dragon and Tiger

The Twenty-first

The white tiger of the western mountain is raging mad; the blue dragon of the eastern sea is irresistible.  
Grasping the two in both hands, force them to fight to death and transform into a lump of purple-gold frost.

Two hands (one text “two beasts”)  
True knowledge’s feeling and spiritual knowledge’s nature, though innate, have fallen to later heaven; principle and desire are mixed; truth and falsehood have long been separated; they cannot instantly tame each other; hence it is said the white tiger of the western mountain rages mad, the blue dragon of the eastern sea is irresistible. But the Way of the Golden Elixir has the method of borrowing falsehood to cultivate truth, using truth to transform falsehood. The method is to follow desires, lead gradually, enter a lower layer of dead work; the unharmonious will come to harmony; the discordant will come to accord; the longer the time the stronger the power; false emotions vanish; true emotions arise; qi and nature dissipate; true emotions appear; falsehood perishes forever; truth remains always. Emotionless emotion is true emotion; natureless nature is true nature. True emotion and true nature unite as one; heart dead and spirit alive; without recognition or knowing; following the sovereign’s law, they transform into a lump of purple-gold frost. Gold is a firm and indestructible substance; gold becoming purple is from intense fire refining; purple gold transforming into frost, form and substance both vanish, perfectly one qi, transcending Yin and Yang.

### On Refining Self: Three Poems

The Twenty-second

First observe the five thieves of Heaven; next examine the earth to settle the people.  
When the people are settled and the state rich, then seek battle; after battle, then the sage appears.

To observe Heaven is to observe our heavenly nature; to clarify the five thieves is to understand the mutual injury of the Five Phases; to examine earth is to examine the ground of our heart; to settle the people is to settle spirit, soul, spirit, and intention in their places. The Way of Elixir cultivation begins with refining the self; the key is to first observe heavenly nature. If heavenly nature is not darkened, the five thieves cannot deceive. Next examine the ground of the heart; if the heart is pure and clear, the five things are all settled; if all five are settled, essence is firm and spirit complete, soul fixed and spirit calm. Sincerity of intention is called the wealth of the state; then battle the five thieves and expel the many shadows. Yin qi transforms into Yang qi; the killing force becomes the living force; the sage may appear. The sage is the original face of good knowledge and good ability, also called the sacred embryo. The five thieves subdued become the five origins; issuing forth as the five virtues; silent and unmoving, responsive and communicating, without recognition or knowing, following the sovereign’s law — is this not the sacred embryo? The poem’s emphasis on battle has deep meaning; the five thieves reside in the heart and act on Heaven; without great power of law to fight Heaven, they cannot be subdued. Battling is to exert great power, to issue forth great mechanism, courage and endeavor, stronger the longer and more forceful; not to abandon halfway. The ancient immortals said: “Not a single strand of Yang qi exhausted, one does not die; not a single strand of Yin qi exhausted, one does not become immortal.” Refining self must be so thorough as to exhaust not a single strand of Yin qi; the Five Phases mix and transform, pure gold extracted before ending.

The Twenty-third

The commander must divide left and right armies; let the other be general, I the subordinate.  
I urge you at the battlefront not to lightly despise the enemy, lest our priceless treasure be lost.

The Way of refining self cannot suddenly succeed; one must follow desires and gradually lead. The portals of true spirit are long closed, habits deep-rooted; the five thieves cause harm, not in a day or two; hardest to quell them. The commander dividing left and right armies, letting the other be the general and I the subordinate, means to firmly yield if one would take. I urge you at the battlefront not to lightly despise the enemy, lest our priceless treasure be lost, means to take from others without losing oneself. Guard against dangers within; diligently refine without; then falsehood may be removed, truth preserved; what worry is there that the Great Way will not be accomplished?

The Twenty-fourth

Fire is born of wood, inherently sharp; if you do not study thoroughly, do not rashly attack.  
Calamities arise from it harming oneself; it is necessary to subdue and seek the Golden Sir.

Man acts with later heaven; spirit of cognition holds sway; the five-phase qi in the body; the roots of vexations and dust carried through kalpas; and the present habitual defilements and filth all arise at once. Without great power and great methods, how can one attack and conquer them all? If one does not study the true principle, yet rashly attempts to use mind to control mind, attacking too fiercely, sometimes fire meets fire and both ignite; one cannot attack the enemy but is attacked by the enemy; not only useless but harmful. Like fire born of wood, calamity arises and must be controlled; wood is burned by fire and injures its own growth. The “San Tong” says: “The sun flows with pearls, always seeking to remove others; at last attaining golden radiance, they turn and mutually depend.” Golden radiance is the Way-heart. The Way-heart is not the heart of the heart; it arises from the innate true body; it possesses true knowledge’s feeling, firm and upright qi, which nothing can deceive. When the Way-heart’s brightness appears, all evil flees; its decisiveness and firmness are like the sharpness of gold. Therefore it is named the Golden Sir. To study the true principle is to study how gold controls wood. The Great Elixir has Golden Sir as master; if abandoning Golden Sir and trying to refine self, one only brings calamity. Thus Zhang Sanfeng said: “When refining self, one must use true lead.” True lead and Golden Sir are both other names for the Way-heart.

### On Golden Sir

The Twenty-fifth

Golden Sir is originally the son of the East House; sent as a fosterling to the Western Neighbour for growth.  
Recognizing him and calling him back to the house to nurture, pairing him with the house’s daughter to form a kinship.

Calling (one text “calling”) ; forming kinship (one text “pairing”)  
Golden Sir is the Way-heart’s true knowledge already mentioned. True knowledge is true feeling. Man’s nature and feeling are originally one family, with no distinction; in substance it is nature; in function it is feeling. Feeling is nature; nature is feeling; they arise together with different names, not two. After intercourse with later heaven, nature and feeling migrate; true feeling is darkened and false feeling arises. Firm and upright qi is obscured by guest qi, no longer belonging to me. Like a son of the East House, but fostered by the Western Neighbour. Fostered by the Western Neighbour does not mean we never meet; only that when seen, we do not recognize. If one is determined, thoroughly investigating principle, recognizing the truth, one calls and it comes forth, like echo in an empty valley, without effort; moreover nurtured in secret chamber, constantly guarded, paired with the lovely house’s true nature daughter, Yin and Yang united as one qi, forming kinship, still the East House’s property. The lovely daughter is the house’s daughter, namely the spiritual knowledge’s nature. Nature is originally Yang, yet called female, because nature governs gentleness, symbolized by wood, hence called lovely daughter; feeling is originally Yin, yet called male, because feeling governs firmness, symbolized by metal, hence called Golden Sir. Golden Sir long since went outside; once he returns home and meets lovely daughter, an extraordinary affection arises, none ever failing to produce the Elixir. Hence the “San Tong” says: “When Golden returns to nature, then it is called returning Elixir.” Gold and wood together, feeling and nature united, that is the returning Elixir; there is no other returning Elixir.

### On Lovely Daughter

The Twenty-sixth

Lovely daughter walks her appointed path; the front is short and the rear is long.  
Returning she enters Yellow Granny’s chamber, marrying Golden Sir as her old husband.

The lovely daughter is the spiritual knowledge’s nature explained previously. Because she enters the human heart of later heaven, where cognition dwells, she cannot but be false in the true, producing falsehood from spirit, flying with fire; wandering uncertain, coming and going without fixed time, unknown to her own dwelling. To cultivate the Golden Elixir, one must first cause this point of spirit nature to walk the path it should; empty the spirit but not darken it, so the spirit returns to true spirit. Front short means to seek feeling by nature; rear long means to nourish truth by spirit. To seek feeling by nature is the wondrous sudden Elixir, hence short; to nourish truth by spirit is the ten-month nurturing, hence long. When short is appropriate, be short; when long is appropriate, be long; this is called having one’s own path. Following one’s path, the Golden Elixir is hoped for. But first must one extinguish cleverness and destroy wisdom, return light and reflect. With this point of spirit nature settled in the central correct place, it is said she returns and enters Yellow Granny’s chamber. Yellow Granny’s chamber is the place of neither偏 nor倚, the abode of central rectitude. When spirit nature is central and correct, heart is right and intention sincere; sincere intention is true faith; true faith does not wander outside. Thus by nature seeking feeling, feeling returns to nature, nature and feeling love each other, unite as one qi; this is called marrying Golden Sir as old husband. “Old husband” is no common phrase, but has deep meaning. The Way of Elixir cultivation begins with spirit nature inviting true feeling; true feeling then makes spirit nature unmoved; spirit nature itself returns to truth. Later, with spirit nature restraining true feeling, one must nurture true feeling in a realm of pure Yang without Yin, then is enough. Like old husband and old wife, husband and wife together till old age, no breaking or shattering midway. This is the meaning of the long rear; the student must investigate deeply.

### On Fire and Time: Two Poems

The Twenty-seventh

Though you know cinnabar and black lead, if you do not know fire and time it is as idle.  
Mostly relying on cultivation’s power, a hair’s difference means no Elixir formed.

The Way of Return Elixir is to take cinnabar and black lead, refining them into treasure to prolong life. Cinnabar is the point of empty spirit in Li, that is spiritual knowledge belonging to human heart; black lead is the point of firm upright qi in Kan, that is true knowledge belonging to Way-heart. Because the human heart’s spiritual knowledge is bright outside and dark inside, bright is fire, fire’s colour is red, hence symbolized by cinnabar; because the Way-heart’s true knowledge is dark outside and bright inside, dark is water, water’s colour is black, hence symbolized by black lead. These are formless and imageless cinnabar and lead, not the tangible and visible cinnabar and lead of the world. Once true and spiritual knowledge of cinnabar and lead are known, they can be taken at hand without difficulty. Yet to take them, one must refine them; to know the medicine but not the method of refining is no better than not knowing. Hence it is said: “Though you know cinnabar and black lead, if you do not know fire and time it is as idle.” The Golden Elixir depends entirely on the work of fire and time. Fire is the power of cultivation; time is the order of cultivation. Taking medicine requires knowing old and young; refining medicine requires knowing the season. There is the fire and time of literary cooking; the fire and time of martial refining; the fire of beginning and the fire of ending; advancing Yang fire and retreating Yin fire; fire of return Elixir and fire of Great Elixir; fire of increase and decrease; fire of nurturing. There are many fires and times; one must have thorough enlightenment, knowing beginning and end, to succeed. If off by a hair, missing by a thousand li, and yet desiring to form the Elixir, it is difficult indeed.

The Twenty-eighth

The Treatise on Agreement and the Song expound the utmost truth; they do not put fire and time into words.  
To know the formula’s mysterious place, one must discuss it carefully with the immortals.

Since ancient times the immortals and sages, in the Treatise on Agreement and the Song, speak most fully and closely on cultivation’s medicines, fire, and time, their truth without falsehood. Though they speak, they cannot speak fully; though they say, they cannot say completely. How can they not put fire and time into words? Yet the Treatise on Agreement and the Song are deep and profound; sometimes speaking of nature, sometimes of life, sometimes of medicine, sometimes of fire; sometimes of fire for cultivating life, sometimes for cultivating nature; sometimes of external fire, sometimes of internal fire — not that they do not speak of fire and time, but their words are scattered and disorderly. Without meeting a wise master to collect and outline, to draw together and raise, one cannot know it. Hence it is said, they do not put fire and time into words. Also it is said, one must carefully discuss it with immortals. This teaches men to study the Treatise on Agreement and the Song, and to seek verification from masters; one must not leave these texts unread and rely solely on masters; nor rely solely on the texts and not seek masters. If the Treatise on Agreement and the Song had no fire and time, how could they be said to expound the utmost truth? Generally students must read these texts and also seek masters. Reading the texts clarifies right and wrong, true and false; broadens knowledge and insight; and seeking masters verifies the reason of what is discerned and seen. Both study and master are indispensable.

### On Gathering Medicine and Time of Fire

The Twenty-ninth

On the fifteenth of the eighth month enjoy the toad’s radiance; this is the time of strongest golden essence.  
When the single Yang first moves, it is proper to advance fire without delay.

“First moves” (one text “first arises”)  
At mid-autumn the golden essence is strongest; the Way reaches firmness and central rectitude; original nature is round and bright. The work of round and bright is all in the Way-heart. The single Yang first moving is the Yang light of one true knowledge of the Way-heart, just moving but not yet greatly moving; the heavenly root just appearing. At this time, it is urgent to begin fire, take it into the furnace of creation, gradually gather and refine, from subtle to manifest; from one Yang to all six Yang pure and complete, like the mid-autumn moon, especially bright, shining through the universe. “Do not delay” are urgent words; the Way-heart’s true knowledge light is rare and easily lost; if one delays, the light qi disperses; face to face one misses it.

### On Drawing Out and Adding Fire

The Thirtieth

When the single Yang first moves to forge the Elixir, the lead cauldron gently shines inside the curtain.  
At the beginning of receiving qi it is easy to get; in drawing out and adding, one must carefully guard against danger.

This poem closely follows the last. When one Yang first moves, and is gathered in the cauldron, the heart is calm and qi even; the empty chamber produces whiteness; brilliance gathers within, darkness produces brightness; like shining inside a curtain. Cui Gong said: “Receiving qi is auspicious; guard against it turning inauspicious.” The coming of one Yang is easy, but completeness is hardest; one must guard against danger, use drawing out and adding to assist, in order to succeed. Drawing out means to remove excess human heart spiritual knowledge; adding means to increase the Way-heart’s true knowledge lacking. Drawing out and adding repeatedly, until there is nowhere to draw or add; the human heart does not arise; the Way-heart always remains; true and spiritual knowledge unite; inner and outer brightness; then there will be no midnight storms. At first the Way-heart recovers, Yang qi is weak, Yin qi is strong; without the work of drawing out and adding, even a little slackness, gaining and then losing again. Thus the work of drawing out and adding is precious; the work of drawing out and adding is the work of guarding against danger. Guarding against danger is not outside drawing out and adding; guarding against danger is within drawing out and adding; these two are one matter, the student must focus attention.

### On Nurturing Fire

The Thirty-first

The mysterious pearl has form as it follows Yang’s birth; Yang at peak, Yin consumed, gradually peeling away form.  
When ten months’ frost flies, the Elixir is ripe; at this time even gods and ghosts must be amazed.

The mysterious pearl is the utmost Yang pearl, the round and bright undarkened object; another name for the Golden Elixir, the original nature of man’s good knowledge and good ability. This original nature is silent and unmoving, responsive and communicating, symbolized by the mysterious pearl. This pearl is a point of firm true knowledge of the Way-heart, gathered by meaning and formed as image, again giving birth, vast qi filling, brilliance complete, Yang at its peak. When Yang is at peak, Yin must connect it; Yin is consumed and form peeled away, using Yin to nourish Yang, transforming away Yang’s dryness. The gradual peeling requires ten months of work. Ten months’ nurturing extracts ore and refines pure gold, transforming to spiritual frost, true void yet containing wondrous existence, wondrous existence yet containing true void, without recognition or knowing, following the sovereign’s law; like frost flying with empty colour, neither grasping being nor non-being; and the Elixir is ripe. Upon this stage, creation cannot restrain; myriad things cannot move; the work is done among men, recorded in Heaven; how can gods and ghosts not be amazed?

### On Forming the Embryo

The Thirty-second

After the former string and before the later string, the medicine’s taste is even and the qi’s image complete.  
Gathered and returned to the furnace, refined and nurtured, self-cooked and self-boiled.

The former string is Yang within Yin, true knowledge returning to central rectitude; the later string is Yin within Yang, spiritual knowledge returning to central rectitude. True and spiritual knowledge both return to central rectitude; firmness and gentleness correspond; their corresponding place is after the former string and before the later string. At this time, true and spiritual knowledge, neither great nor small harmed, both nations intact; within which arises one point of innate spiritual sprout. The medicine’s taste is even; Yin and Yang mixed; urgent to take it and put it into the furnace of creation, refining and picking the true, forming the sacred embryo. At this stage medicine is fire, fire is medicine; with ten months nurturing, there is natural true fire cooking and boiling; from subtlety to manifestation; formless giving birth to form.

### On Yin and Yang Returning to the Centre

The Thirty-third

The eldest son first drinks wine of the West; the maiden first opens the flower of the North.  
If the green maiden and the young man meet, in an instant they are locked in the Yellow House.

The eldest son is Zhen; the wine of the West is metal and water. The third day of the moon appears in the Geng direction; under Yin, one Yang is born; in hexagrams Zhen; hence it is said the eldest son first drinks wine of the West. The maiden is Dui; the flower of the North is the golden flower born in water. The moonlight is born from Dui to Kun; Yin within Yang appears; hence it is said the maiden first opens the flower of the North. Both lines speak of the appearance of one Yang. “First drinks” means never before drinking, but now suddenly drinking; “first opens” means the previous was not fully open, now just opening. The first drink and first open both express the idea that the Way-heart’s true knowledge is difficult to keep and hard to find. The Way-heart has long been buried, true knowledge darkened; suddenly in utmost stillness, it is found, like first drinking wine and first opening flower. This is the moment of return; a fine night and good meeting, not to be missed; one must take advantage of the moment to take it, and combine with spiritual knowledge; lock it in the central Yellow Court chamber; husband and wife meet and naturally produce the Elixir. Spiritual knowledge is nature, Yin within Yang, belonging to wood; wood is the colour green; hence spiritual knowledge is represented as the green maiden. When true knowledge and spiritual knowledge meet, united as one qi, naturally they return to the centre. But though they return, if one does not know to lock them up, there is danger of coming together and separating again. Having locked and sealed tightly the door, those that are not united must be joined; those united must remain united. Zhang Sanfeng said: “The East House’s daughter, the West House’s man, are paired as husband and wife entering the bridal chamber; Yellow Granny urges drinking of sweet nectar, a day is a drunken revel.” The words “lock” and “seal” have the function of guarding against danger; for when Yin and Yang first meet, nature and feeling are not yet pure and one; one must not forget and not assist, strictly guarding; so there is no leakage; the Golden Elixir naturally condenses from emptiness. This is the heavenly secret, not known to masters who are not wise.

### On Bathing

The Thirty-fourth

In the months of rabbit and rooster, the punishment reaches the door, the medicine’s image.  
At this stage the Golden Elixir should be bathed; if fire is added, it will surely incline to danger.

The Golden Elixir (one text “Golden Sand”)  
The month of the Rabbit, being Vernal Equinox, Yang qi rises at the centre of Heaven and Earth; the month of the Rooster, being Autumnal Equinox, Yin qi rises at the centre of Heaven and Earth. Spring belongs to wood, the life qi, the virtue; autumn belongs to metal, the destroying qi, the punishment. Virtue is the cause of life; punishment is the cause of completion. Without punishment there is no completion of virtue; without virtue there is no full punishment. With punishment and virtue, Heaven and Earth’s creation and transformation flow as one qi, circulating without end. The cultivator’s Way-heart is firm, returning to central rectitude, like Autumn Equinox; spiritual knowledge’s gentleness returns to central rectitude, like Spring Equinox; true and spiritual knowledge both return to central rectitude, like Spring virtue and Autumn punishment. The strength of true knowledge controls the human heart’s evil qi; the gentleness of spiritual knowledge nurtures the Way-heart’s right qi. When firmness is proper, be firm; when gentleness is proper, be gentle; not missing the time; then firmness and gentleness are central and rectified, like Spring Equinox and Autumn Equinox, each having its time. Hence it is said “in the months of rabbit and rooster.” Firmness containing gentleness, gentleness containing firmness, firmness and gentleness are as one; then true spirit does not scatter; like Spring virtue and Autumn punishment, they alternate and operate; hence it is said “punishment and virtue reach the door, the medicine’s image.” When the Way is at firmness and gentleness central and rectified, the Way-heart always remains; the human heart is utterly still; true knowledge is most spiritual; spiritual knowledge is most true. True and spiritual spirit unite as one; good knowledge and good ability; the Golden Elixir has form; one may bathe and nurture it, and remove the firewood from beneath the furnace. Otherwise, if one does not know to stop, but still adds fire, the firmness is excessive, gentleness insufficient; firmness and gentleness remain not central or rectified; medicine withers and Elixir is injured; incline and danger, how can one escape?

### On Literary Cooking and Martial Refining

The Thirty-fifth

The sun and moon meet once in thirty days; by the method of changing days, the spirit’s work is attained.  
To guard the city and fight in the field, know the good and evil; increase spiritual sand to fill the cauldron red.

The moon has no light; borrowing light from the sun. Twelve meetings of sun and year; thirty days in a month; one meeting between new moon and full moon. Man’s true knowledge is buried, pure Yin without Yang, like the moon’s darkness; it must borrow spiritual knowledge to produce light. When spiritual and true knowledge meet, it is like sun and moon meeting in thirty days. The Perfected One imitates the image of sun and moon meeting, placing thirty days into one day, and one day into one hour. One hour stirs firmness, borrowing human heart to generate Way-heart; by Way-heart control human heart; by spiritual knowledge nurture true knowledge. Taking the primal qi at the end of chaos as the Elixir’s mother; following the divine mechanism of Yin and Yang changes as the time of fire. This Way has literary cooking and martial refining. Guarding the city is literary cooking; fighting in the field is martial refining. When literary, be literary; when martial, be martial; this is auspicious. When literary but martial, or martial but literary, this is inauspicious. Literary fire is turning light back inward, discarding cleverness and destroying wisdom, focusing and nurturing right qi, like guarding a city. Martial fire is punishing anger and blocking desire, removing falsehood and preserving sincerity, fiercely removing guest qi, like fighting in the field. Knowing literary and martial, understanding good and evil; if need be, use martial fire; if not, use literary fire. Literary fire and martial refining exhaust Yin qi and purify Yang qi; true and spiritual knowledge unite, transforming into good knowledge and good ability, wondrously realizing original nature; round and bright, shining and clear; pure and naked, red and brilliant; silent and unmoving, responsive and communicating; responsive and communicating, silent and unmoving; utterly heavenly principle; utterly free of human desire. Like spiritual sand filling the cauldron red, the sand becoming spirit, qi and nature all transformed; neither colour nor void, neither being nor non-being; pure clear Yang qi; taking it cures illness and prolongs life, removes disaster and averts difficulty, restoring original nature; empty spirit undarkened, true void wondrous existence; creation cannot limit, Yin and Yang cannot restrain, myriad things cannot harm; such is it. Yet in the world there are those who know good and evil but do not submit their hearts to use spirit’s power.

### On Hexagram Meaning: Two Poems

The Thirty-sixth

Without the coming together of refusal and acceptance, myriad things are full; the hexagrams of difficulty and ignorance receive birth and growth.  
If one obtains the meaning within, do not seek symbols; if one investigates all lines, one vainly serves emotions.

Qian over Kun (), Heaven’s qi descends from above; Earth’s qi rises from below; Yin and Yang do not meet, this is refusal. Kun over Qian (), Earth’s qi descends from above; Heaven’s qi rises from below; Yin and Yang meet, this is acceptance. When refusal reaches its extreme, acceptance comes; Yin and Yang only just meet; myriad things arise and fill the universe. Difficulty () is Kan over Zhen below, water with thunder; Yin within Yang arises, dispersing Yin and producing life. Ignorance () is Gen over Kan below, mountain over water; Yang trapped in Yin, nurturing Yang and producing things. Refusal and acceptance are passing and blocking; difficulty and ignorance are birth and growth. Passing and blocking, birth and growth, are all the coming and going of Yin and Yang. The movement of Yin and Yang, the passing and blocking of myriad things, birth and growth, all are natural and not forced. The Way of cultivation: if firmness and gentleness are not united, that is refusal; if firmness and gentleness are united, that is acceptance. When firm, then advance firmness to cultivate truth, that is difficulty; when gentle, then operate gentleness to nurture truth, that is ignorance. To know passing and blocking, able to cultivate and nurture, firmness and gentleness used with time, changing to make the sixty-four hexagrams, is all within one’s heart and mind.

Generally, the hexagram’s image produces the meaning; when the meaning is obtained, one may forget the image. If one does not know the meaning of the hexagram, but clings to the image, insisting on one, two, or three Yang to proceed with acceptance, or one, two, or three Yin to oppose refusal, the explanation of three Yang producing acceptance is almost reasonable; but three Yin opposing refusal is difficult indeed. Moreover, there is the concept, by the Heavenly Zi time, that the Yang qi moves in Kan and guards the kidney, called Morning Difficulty; at noon, Yang qi is limited and stops, guarding the heart, called Evening Ignorance. Alas! To say that refusal and acceptance, difficulty and ignorance, sixty-four hexagrams and all lines can be fully applied thus, is but vainly serving emotions. The ancient immortals said: “No need to seek Zi or Wu at the horizon; one Yang is born within oneself.” This is clear proof for those applying hexagrams and lines; the student must carefully consider.

The Thirty-seventh

Within the hexagram, the images are the original ritual form; obtaining the meaning, forget the words and the meaning is naturally clear.  
The whole world is confused, only clinging to the image; yet applying the hexagram’s qi, hoping to ascend.

Obtaining image (one text “obtaining meaning”); clinging to image (one text “clinging to mud image”)  
The sixty-four hexagrams, 384 lines, only explain Yin ritual and Yang ritual, central and not central, balanced and unbalanced forms. If one obtains the meaning of Yin and Yang, balanced and unbalanced, one can harmonize Yin and Yang, and combine the hexagram image. Alas! The confused of the world do not investigate meaning, but cling to image, insisting on Morning Difficulty and Evening Ignorance, beginning with difficulty and ignorance, ending with completion and incompletion, applying the hexagram’s qi, hoping to attain the Way and ascend, foolish indeed.

Little do they know that the ancient immortals, when speaking of Morning Difficulty and Evening Ignorance, taught that Yang’s birth is difficulty, Yang’s fall is ignorance. Yang’s birth is like morning light of day; Yang’s fall is like dusk of night. When Yang is born, immediately advance Yang fire to gather Yang, this is Morning Difficulty; when Yang falls, immediately operate Yin charm to nourish Yang, this is Evening Ignorance. Completion and incompletion teach that when Yin and Yang unite, it is completion; when Yin and Yang do not unite, it is incompletion. When Yin and Yang unite, the Golden Elixir congeals; the Yang fire work is done; in completion one must guard against incompletion, the work of Yin charm must be used. When Yin and Yang do not unite, the Golden Elixir does not congeal; Yin charm is useless; in incompletion one must urgently bring about completion, the work of Yang fire must be done. This is the meaning hidden in the hexagrams; applying it to the other sixty hexagrams, all are changes of one Yin and one Yang; hence it is said, “Obtain the meaning, forget the words, the meaning is naturally clear.” If one understands the meaning of hexagrams, the heavenly barrier is in hand, the earth’s axis is in heart; step by step all is the Way; no need to cling to hexagram images and yet combine hexagram images by oneself. Alas! Golden toad and jade crow, to know the truth is to be a true practitioner.

### On Geng and Jia

The Thirty-eighth

Heaven and Earth’s fullness and emptiness each has its time; only by discerning waxing and waning can the mechanism be known.  
Ever since Geng and Jia clarified the decree, killing the three corpses the Way may be hoped for.

The Way of Heaven and Earth is the Way of fullness and emptiness. When fullness reaches its extreme, emptiness occurs; when emptiness reaches its extreme, fullness occurs; each has its time. The cultivator who can carefully discern fullness and emptiness’s real principle and can overcome emptiness and nurture fullness, then is said to know the mechanism of waxing and waning. To overcome and consume emptiness is the mechanism of emptiness; to nurture and give life to fullness is the mechanism of fullness. Yet overcoming and nurturing are never apart from true knowledge’s feeling and spiritual knowledge’s nature. True knowledge’s feeling is firm, belonging to Geng metal; spiritual knowledge’s nature is gentle, belonging to Jia wood. Firmness controls the outside and subdues guest qi; gentleness dwells within and nurtures innate truth. Using firmness and gentleness together, cultivating within and without, this is called Geng and Jia clarifying the decree. When the decree is clear, firmness and gentleness are proper; waxing and waning follow time; right qi overcomes and evil qi transforms; no thought arises; outside things do not enter; no eye, ear, mouth, tongue, body, or mind; no colour, sound, scent, taste, touch, or law; pure and naked; red and brilliant — this is called killing the three corpses. Killing the three corpses, all shadows transform; Great Way may be hoped for. This poem’s point is on discerning waxing and waning, knowing the mechanism. To discern is to examine minutely, not missing the smallest; with profound work and long time one can see the truth. When the truth is seen and is at hand, one can control it; only then can one wax and wane. To wax and wane is to know the mechanism; if one cannot wax and wane, one cannot be said to know the mechanism. Not knowing the mechanism means not having thoroughly examined the principle; how can one clarify the decree and kill the three corpses? Hence the study of right heart and sincere intention rests entirely on investigating things and extending knowledge.

### On the Original Female: Two Poems

The Thirty-ninth

To gain the Valley Spirit and never die, one must rely on the Mysterious Female to establish the root foundation.  
True essence returns to the Golden Chamber; one point of spirit light never departs.

The Valley Spirit is the one qi of innate emptiness, also called the sacred embryo. This qi is neither colour nor void; it is both colour and void; in the dim obscure, one cannot see or hear it, nor grasp it; it is the boundary of Way-heart and human heart, the root of true and spiritual knowledge, the root of firm feeling and gentle nature; giving birth to Heaven, Earth, and man. Confucians call it “Great Ultimate,” or “Utmost Good,” or “Utmost Sincerity”; Buddhists call it “Perfect Enlightenment,” or “Dharma Body,” or “Tower Benefit”; Daoists call it “Golden Elixir,” or “Sacred Embryo,” or “Valley Spirit.” In fact it is man’s original good knowledge and good ability, the spirit of the empty valley made manifest. This Valley Spirit, fallen into later heaven, Yin and Yang divided, falsehood acting, truth retreating; the Valley Spirit is buried as if dead.

To cultivate the Golden Elixir, one must awaken this Valley Spirit; to awaken the Valley Spirit, one must first harmonize Yin and Yang; if Yin and Yang do not harmonize, the Valley Spirit does not congeal. Yuan is Yang, the firm and upright feeling; Pin is Yin, the gentle and submissive nature. Where there is firmness and gentleness, the Valley Spirit is long-lived; the root of immortality is established. The Valley Spirit is the central rectitude of firmness and gentleness, the two strings’ qi, united and conjoined. The two strings conjoined, in dim obscure, there is something; this is called the essence of true oneness. The essence of true oneness is another name for the Valley Spirit. Before refining, it appears and disappears, called true essence; after refining, congealed and not scattered, called Valley Spirit. When true essence returns to the Golden Chamber, the essence is one, and the Valley Spirit congeals. When the Valley Spirit congeals, the Way-heart always remains, the human heart is subdued, true and spiritual knowledge unite; good knowledge and good ability, the heavenly principle complete, silent and unmoving, responsive and communicating; responsive and communicating, silent and unmoving, always responding and always still; one point of spirit light never departs. Spirit light never departing is the Valley Spirit never dying. Valley Spirit never dying is the immortal’s saying: “One grain of Golden Elixir swallowed into the belly, then know my life is not ruled by Heaven.” The Valley Spirit, true essence and spirit light, is still one thing, only distinguished as formed or not; it is not three things; the student must know.

The Fortieth

The gate of the Mysterious Female is rarely known in the world; only mistaken for the mouth and nose’s false workings.  
Though you breathe in and out for a thousand years, how can you gain the Golden Crow clutching the Rabbit?

Many years (one text “a thousand years”)  
Laozi said: “The Valley Spirit never dies; this is called the Original Female.” The gate of the Original Female is called the root of Heaven and Earth. Yuan is Yang of Qian, the virtue of firmness; Pin is Yin of Kun, the virtue of gentleness. Yang moves, Yin is still; the movement and stillness of the Valley Spirit is the gate of the Original Female. This gate gives birth to Heaven, Earth, and all beings; from nothing contains everything; from emptiness contains
