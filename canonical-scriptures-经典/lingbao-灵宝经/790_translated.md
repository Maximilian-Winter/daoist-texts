#### The Golden Scripture of the Great Possession of the Three Treasures

The Lord of Heavenly Treasure is the revered god of the Great Cave; the Venerable Lord of Heavenly Treasure is the ancestral qi of the Lord of Heavenly Treasure. This Venerable Lord is the qi of the Primordial Supreme Jade Void of the Great and Boundless Mixed Cave, comprising ninety-nine thousand nine hundred ninety billion qi. Later, in the first year of Longhan, was born the Lord of Heavenly Treasure, who at the time of issuing the scripture bore the name of the Most Exalted Great Possession of the Jade Pure Palace.

The Lord of Lingbao is the revered god of the Mysterious Cave; the Venerable Lord of Lingbao is the ancestral qi of the Lord of Lingbao. This Venerable Lord is the qi of the Red Mixed Boundless Primordial Mysterious Supreme Purple Void, numbering ninety-nine million nine hundred ninety-nine thousand qi. Later, at the opening of the chart in Longhan, was born the Lord of Lingbao; after one kalpa, to the first year of Chiming. At the time of issuing the scripture to save men, he bore the title of Supreme Clarity Mysterious Capital of Jade Capital Seven Treasures Purple Tenuity Palace.

The Lord of Divine Treasure is the revered god of the Cave of Spirits; the Venerable Lord of Divine Treasure is the ancestral qi of the Lord of Divine Treasure. This Venerable Lord is the qi of the Dark Stillness Mysterious Penetration Primordial Supreme Clear Void, numbering ninety-nine million nine hundred ninety thousand qi. Later, in the first year of Chiming, was born the Lord of Divine Treasure; after two kalpas, to the first year of the Supreme Emperor, at the time of issuing the scripture, he bore the title of Three Sovereigns Cave Spirit Supreme Clarity Supreme Ultimate Palace.

Though these three titles differ in year and name, they are originally one, divided into the three primordial qi, which govern. The Three Treasures are all the revered gods of the three qi, called the birth of the three qi; the three titles together give birth to nine qi. The nine qi come forth before the Great Void, hidden within the empty cave; without light nor image, without form nor name, without colour nor thread, without sound nor voice, guiding and governing the world, opening the mysterious penetration; the three colours of chaos, sometimes existing and sometimes vanishing. Their movement follows extreme numbers; the three qi open light, the qi is clear, lofty and pure; accumulated yang forms the heavens, qi congeals as dregs, accumulated stagnation forms the earth. The nine qi are arrayed in order; the sun, moon, stars and constellations, yin and yang, five phases, people and all things, all receive generation. The myriad transformations of heaven and earth, if not nurtured by the Three Origins and guided by the nine qi, no one can bring them forth. The three qi are the reverence of heaven and earth; the nine qi are the root of all things; therefore, the three combine to form virtue, the utmost of heaven and earth. Man is born in the womb; the Three Origins nurture him, the nine qi conjoin to form shape. Therefore in the ninth month the spirit is spread abroad, the qi is full and able to sound, the voice still possesses spirit; the nine heavens declare their celebration. The Great One holds the tally, the Emperor commands and assigns the orders, recording the registers; the officer of fate determines the reckoning; the Five Emperors oversee birth; the Holy Mother guards the chamber; the gods of heaven and the spirits of earth stand guard in the three realms. The Nine Heavens' commanding officer stands in court, facing east, reading the "Precious Chapter of the Birth of Spirits in the Nine Heavens" nine times; if male, the myriad spirits chant in reverence; if female, the myriad spirits chant in homage; the male officer of fate respectfully consents; the female officer of fate respectfully obeys; thus is life born. If the Nine Heavens' commanding officer does not give the order, the myriad spirits will not chant in reverence or consent, and life shall never be born. For a man to be born anew in the human path, to bathe his form in the sun, astonishing heaven and earth, is a dignity difficult to surpass. The heavenly essence and earthly spirits, the three realms all come together, yet do not lightly regard it. When it is time for birth, it is not disgraceful; therefore, they can love the form, preserve the spirit, esteem the qi, strengthen the root, and never die or decay, but attain to immortality; flesh and spirit fly together, ascending to the Three Purities, harmonizing with the combined virtues of the three qi and the nine qi altogether. But though man is born, if he himself does not honour his qi, esteem his form, treasure his life, cherish his spirit, he brings death and decay upon himself, departing from his true original.

The "Chapter on the Birth of Spirits in the Nine Heavens" is the flying mysterious qi of the Three Caves; the three combine to form sound, conjoin to form the spirit script, mixing the myriad gods, hidden in rhyme and secret names, giving birth to qi and binding form — the natural chapter. The Lord of Heavenly Treasure chants it to open the light of heaven and earth. The Lord of Lingbao chants it to open the soul of the nine abysses and long night. The Lord of Divine Treasure chants it to govern myriad spirits. The Great One chants it to complete body and spirit. The Emperor chants it to bind form. The Nine Heavens chant it to produce men. The scholars chant it to ascend to heaven. The ghosts and spirits hear it and ascend. The common man hears it and attains longevity. The dark souls hear it and open to salvation. The withered and decayed hear it and emit smoke. The infants hear it and gain speech. The dead bones hear it and return to man. The mystery of the Three Treasures is profound; the roots of myriad creatures are born from it; therefore it is unknown to ghosts and gods, but heard by common men. Those who study the higher way aspire to immortality; when they have attained release of the corpse, extinguishing and transmigration, they finally return to the immortal way; the form and spirit are united, not apart, both entering the true Dao. Without this scripture, the womb binds and stagnates, death qi fixes the root; true vision is not kept, birth qi has no passage; the nine gates are barred; the body does not engender spirit, merely receiving a form, as if carrying qi for a journey. Those who learn this method can sit to attain naturalness. The Three Treasures are revered, the Nine Heavens are supremely true, secret in the Great Possession, the ninefold golden frame, purple yang jade platform. Unless at the opening of heaven and earth, this scripture will not be revealed. The Primordial Sovereign forbids its reading; those who secretly obtain it will suffer the wind blade for myriad kalpas, their souls extinguished with no birth. To follow the rules and reverence it, body and spirit become immortals. In the palace of the Three Origins, there are names written in gold, characters carved in purple; those born in the future, destined to be immortals of the Three Purities, shall obtain this scripture. If the destiny and fate coincide, they shall bring gold treasures, serve their master with loyalty, take the oath by the rules, close the heart and reverence the practice, carefully avoiding negligence or light disclosure, or the wind blade will test the body.

Method of cultivation: a thousand days of long fasting, disengaged from human affairs, all worldly desires exhausted, pacify the mind and silently recite, hold pure incense and observe the precepts, enter the chamber facing east, knock the teeth nine times, regulate the sound and straighten the qi, recite the precious chapter. Once recited, the voice is heard in the Nine Heavens. Twice recited, heaven and earth set in reverence. Thrice recited, the three realms pay respect. Four times, the heavenly kings descend as immortals. Five times, the Five Emperors pay homage to the True. Six times, the demons are bound. Seven times, the stars and constellations halt their gates. Eight times, the dark night brightens. Nine times, all the heavens come near; all the gods and spirits guard the pavilion. One recitation penetrates heaven, the original womb proclaims and connects. Two recitations resound on earth, the womb unties and unbinds the root. Three recitations bring divine rites, the soul gate refines immortality. Four recitations, the heavenly kings descend as immortals, the spirit gate closes. Five recitations, the Five Emperors pay homage to the True, the treasury is pure and cool. Six recitations, the demon kings submit, the stomach canal produces fluid. Seven recitations, the stars and constellations shine bright, the orifices open to hearing. Eight recitations, the dark night shines forth, the three divisions and eight scenes, completing shape and spirit. Nine recitations, all the heavens come near, the three gates, five viscera, six bowels, nine palaces, golden towers, jade chambers, twelvefold gates, purple doors, jade thresholds, thirty-six thousand joints, root and source primordial, at once giving birth to spirit. Nine recitations make one round; one round completed, the three realms call the name, the Five Emperors distinguish and separate, called the True Person. Ten rounds connect the qi, govern the myriad spirits, demon kings protect and recommend, arrayed in the higher heavens. One hundred rounds connect spirit, sitting to attain naturalness, the Great One bestows talisman, the Primordial Lord receives birth. One thousand rounds connect the spirit, sitting, standing, departing; jade boys and jade girls, serve east and west. Ten thousand rounds complete the way, gallop the dragon chariot, ascend the white sun in the morning.

The Primordial Heavenly Venerable dwells tranquil and retired, reclining in the Cloud Palace Yellow Chamber, within the seven treasures canopy. He cultivates simplicity and nurtures purity, polishing the mysterious, bending over to study the birth of spirits, managing the subtle great chaos, whistling loudly through the Nine Heavens. At this time, the Flying Heaven Great Saint, the Boundless Divine King, Jade Assistant Supreme Steward, and Four Attendants of the Morning court, observe the pure fasting and establish the festival, attending at his side. Leaning on a jade countenance and subtle feelings, raising spiritual eyes and opening the chest, secretly holding the spirit chapter and leaping with joy, feeding on celestial sounds and receiving life, daring to seize the opportunity and understand the gathering, facing the spiritual gaze and opening the heart. Then the Flying Heaven Great Saint, Boundless Divine King, advances and bows, touching his head to the ground, saying: "Humble servant is fortunate to meet and to gaze upon the Divine Pavilion, not counting shortcomings, daring to cleanse the obscure rules, deeply comprehending the condensed mystery, attaining the rank of Divine King. Overall commanding life and death, leading the heavenly immortals, rewarding and supervising the seven awakenings, gazing afar to distant places, presiding over the Supreme Steward, attending the morning court. Now at the turning of the great cycle, the date approaches Jia-Shen, the great flood sweeps away filth, calamities fill the sky, the Three Officials beat the brush, sorting all kinds entering, calculating merits and demerits, good and evil to be divided. From Chiming to the first year of the Supreme Emperor, relying on the Yuan Yang Jade Vault, those to be saved should number two hundred and forty thousand. After Kaihuang, till Jia-Shen, the heavens select and arrange, the immortal officers fall vacant, officials do not fill posts, wandering and scattered, all should select men. According to the Yuan Yang Jade Calendar, in the three dynasties, additionally calculating those with hearts to accumulate goodness and build merit, praised by the three realms, protected by the Five Emperors, their name recorded in the heavens, ten thousand are taken to fill their charges. Moreover, twelve thousand are separately chosen to fill reserve posts. Such precedent; some by former names in the mysterious chart, some by bone images merged with immortals, some by extinction and transmigration of the wheel, some by devotion to the Three Treasures, good works thoroughly reaching heaven, some by offerings to the Three Treasures, praised by the Three Officials, some by cultivating fasting and observing precepts, merit and virtue accumulating and moving, some by scattering wealth and treasures, establishing Daoist halls, some by rescuing and comforting the poor and needy, delivering heavenly men, some by building merits and filling posts for the Three Masters, the heavenly officials have records, calculation registers, the Three Officials correspond, all reverse-writing the seeds of names, distinctions above and below, leaving no fraction. Also the office of the Nine Abysses, governed by the Eastern Flower Azure Palace Nine Dragons talisman command, extracting the jade vault male and female dead souls, with former good names, merit sufficient to receive release, taking thirty-two thousand to fill after the Jia-Shen purge, opening the people of the Great Possession. At such time, life and death meet, good and evil are separated; those passing are truly joyous. Yet the Three Officials are strict, writings are numerous, the Dragon Gate receives gatherings, the Bird Mother supervises immortals, myriad saints manifest their chariots, day and night unceasing, merit and demerit equal, causing life and death no partiality; this confusion and noise are also the servant’s concern. The great date is close, events occur and fail, always fearing one day to meet the public tribunal. Humbly hearing the Heavenly Venerable fashion great compassion transformation, pitying all living beings, opening the secret of the Nine Heavens to aid the people. The clear rules and prohibitions are not for humble servants to hear and discuss. Yet the great number has its season; Jia-Shen approaches its end; the cycle of transmigration hastens; the great law should be enacted. To cause those with heart to hear in the calculations, to hear the law’s sound, to open and reveal in sight and hearing, to encourage and transform the unawakened. Thus, respectfully presenting, fearing to offend the heavenly countenance, praying for pity and granting what was not before heard.

Then the Heavenly Venerable laid hand on the desk, raised himself high in spirit, looked upward reciting the Mysterious Chapter, whistling and chanting the gems of jade. After a long while, suddenly sighed: "The supreme model is vast and boundless; the principle is subtle and profound; the Way reaches the heavy mystery; the qi crowns the divine firmament; to the utmost difficult to express; the marvel also hard to surpass. Since you hold the imperial office, receiving the charge of Divine King, flying in heaven’s wings to the jade pavilion, four auxiliaries attending at the bright wheel, gazing afar and surveying all, commanding the endless, harmonizing myriad transformations, caring for and measuring the living beings. Now the great cycle is at its turning, the three and five announce the time, the hundred and six respond to the opportunity, the Yang Nine excites, the great spring beats waves, myriad disasters afflict heaven, the four palaces select and appoint to fill the ranks. The three dynasties were confused and disorderly; good and evil should be divided. You must labor your mind for the living, weary yourselves for the Three Officials; in the time of rising and falling, matters must be opened and enabled. Now entrusted to you; you must apply yourself. The precious scripture is wondrous and weighty, the nine heavens’ sacred sound, bestowed on the supreme saint; not heard by ghosts or gods. Clearly true and having standard, once every forty thousand kalpas it is enacted. Now, violating the prohibition, it is entrusted to you; keep it secret; do not lightly transmit. Ascend and command the Nine Heavens’ commanding officer, attend the jade attendant, open the purple yang jade book, the cloud brocade sack, bring out the “Jade Chapter on the Birth of Spirits in the Nine Heavens.” The four auxiliaries take their places, the five elders supervise the truth, the Great One commands the stars, the Jade Emperor sings the covenant; one obeys and bows to the clear truth, facing south long kneeling, and thus entrusts to the Flying Heaven Boundless Divine King. When the ritual is complete, all the heavens return to their places.

The Heavenly Venerable again admonished the Flying Heaven Divine King: "This chapter of the Nine Heavens is the qi of the Three Caves’ flying mystery, the three meetings form sound, conjoining to form true script, mixing the myriad gods, hidden in rhyme and secret names. Therefore the Great One surveys and nurtures the ten directions, comprehends the Mysterious Void, opens the oath in red and blue. From countless kalpas of cause and condition, former names and imperial charts, no one may see it. Those who catch sight of the pages are the nine ancestors all immortals. They select and choose those among men destined to be immortals; within seven hundred years, pure fasting a thousand days, bringing gold and silk and swearing heart, following the covenant to transmit. Careful and there will be blessing; negligent and there will be calamity. Blessing extends to the nine ancestors, virtue as great as mountains and seas; calamity will test and flow for countless kalpas, agony in poisonous broth, wind blades executing punishment; can one not be cautious?"

#### Efficacy of Reciting the Scripture

Mount Qingcheng in Shu is the meeting place of immortals. Formerly the Shu ruler Meng Chang went to pray, seeing the female spirit Mago, at the fasting altar side. The magistrate of Qingcheng presented a beautiful woman of the Zhang family, who was then accepted and named Lihua, dwelling together in the Venerable Lord’s temple. Suddenly one night there was thunder and lightning, violent rain and strong wind, lifting and overturning the buildings, scattering them into the air; Zhang died and was buried beneath the mountain. Several decades later at the Lantern Festival, the Daoist Li Ruochong of the Venerable Lord’s temple returned at night and rested before the mountain. Suddenly in the bamboo shade a woman wailed and came forth, approaching Ruochong, composing a poem: "Lying alone through autumn, hair fallen, cicada’s call; wind in the white poplar, sleepless; clear thoughts on past favours of the pepper chamber, tears wet the clothes, spoiling the green hairpin." Finishing speaking, she wept again and withdrew. Ruochong returned to the temple, seeing in the Venerable Lord’s hall men in robes and red shoes, all facing north standing as if in audience. In the corridor beneath the hall were arranged prisoners; the jailers led a woman, bound to an iron pillar, beating her; crying out in pain, slowly he observed it was the one he met before the mountain. Soon a good spirit by sword pointed to Ruochong, saying: "Tonight at the Lantern Festival the Heavenly Official from the Five Mountains Venerable Lords conducts the inspection of life and death offenses; it is not proper to stand long. Ruochong then secretly withdrew till dawn, reporting to his master Tang Dongqing. Tang said: "Do you know? This is Zhang Lihua. Formerly favoured here, she profaned the Supreme Truth, thus met this guilt. Having told you by poem, you should save her." Ruochong asked: "By what method can she be saved?" "Only to turn the ‘Chapter of the Birth of Spirits in the Nine Heavens’ nine times, presenting the golden tally and white tablet, she may escape this suffering and be reborn." By chance meeting the shepherd Lu Chou of Linqiong who prepared a yellow tally, Ruochong then set the tablets and petitions, recited the scripture ten times, threw offerings at the altar, thus saving her. Upon reciting the ninth chapter, at the time of burning the tablets, Ruochong turned and burned them. The next day at Zhang’s burial place, four lines of sand characters appeared: "The tally officers hastily knock the night gate, then follow the golden tablets out of the dark realm. Having received the master’s recommendation and mercy not shallow, she attained the nine times scripture of spirit birth."

Ruochong carefully observed: The Most High bestows teachings, pitying all living beings, thus establishing a door for rescue, to aid the path of life and death. Alas, those in the world who desire to save and deliver the departed should truly revere this jade text as the swiftest path to liberation. Carefully inscribed at the scripture’s end is an exhortation to venerate and serve.
