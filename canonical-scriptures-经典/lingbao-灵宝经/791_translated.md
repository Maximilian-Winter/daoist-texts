# The Scripture of the Three Treasures of Great Abundance, Born of the Nine Heavens of Spiritual Treasure by Nature: The Golden Book

The name of the scripture is The Scripture of the Three Treasures of Great Abundance, Born of the Nine Heavens of Spiritual Treasure by Nature. The author is unknown. It is compiled by excerpting the first half of the Scripture of the Nine Heavens’ Birth of Spirits. It is contained in one scroll. The source text is from the Catalogue of the Dongzhen Division of the Orthodox Daoist Canon.

The Lord of Heavenly Treasure is the august spirit of the Great Cavern; the Elder of Heavenly Treasure is the ancestral qi of the Lord of Heavenly Treasure. The Elder is the mixed and vast primal original supreme jade emperor’s qi, numbering ninety-nine trillion, nine hundred ninety billion qi. Later, in the first year of the Dragon Han era, the Lord of Heavenly Treasure was transformed and born; at the time of the scripture’s issuing, he was titled the Most High Great Abundance of the Jade Pure Palace.

The Lord of Spiritual Treasure is the august spirit of the Cavern Profundity; the Elder of Spiritual Treasure is the ancestral qi of the Lord of Spiritual Treasure. The Elder is the red mixed great primal original supreme jade void qi, numbering ninety-nine million, nine hundred ninety-nine thousand, nine hundred ninety-nine qi. Later, at the opening of the Dragon Han era, the Lord of Spiritual Treasure was transformed and born; after one kalpa, in the first year of Chi Ming, the scripture was issued to save men; at that time he was titled the Supreme Pure Mysterious Capital of Two Capitals and the Seven Treasures Purple Tenuity Palace.

The Lord of Spirit Treasure is the august spirit of the Cavern Spirit; the Elder of Spirit Treasure is the ancestral qi of the Lord of Spirit Treasure. The Elder is the dark silent mysterious thorough primal supreme jade void qi, numbering ninety-nine million, nine hundred ninety thousand qi. Later, in the first year of Chi Ming, the Lord of Spirit Treasure was transformed and born; after two kalpas, in the first year of the Supreme Sovereign, the scripture was issued; at that time he was titled the Three Sovereigns Cavern Spirit Supreme Clear and Supreme Ultimate Official.

Though these three titles differ in age and appellation, they are essentially one. They divide into the three primordial qi of Profound Origin, and govern the Three Treasures; all are august spirits of the three qi, called the birth of the three qi. The three titles collectively give birth to nine qi, which issue forth before the Great Void, concealed within the cavity of emptiness. They have no light nor image, no form nor name, no colour nor trace, no sound nor voice. The Dao moves and governs the world, opening and developing the profound thoroughfare, three colours in chaos, appearing and disappearing. The movement proceeds to its utmost, and the three qi open the light. The qi is pure, lofty, and clear; accumulating yang it forms heaven; qi condenses and stagnates, forming earth. The nine qi arrange themselves rightly; the sun, moon, stars and constellations; yin and yang, the five elements; the people and all things receive their generation. Heaven and earth’s myriad transformations are nurtured not by the three origins, but guided by the nine qi; no one else can produce them. The three qi are the august ones of heaven and earth; the nine qi are the root of myriad things. Therefore the three combine into virtue, the utmost of heaven and earth. Man is born within the womb; the three origins nurture and nourish him; the nine qi form his shape; hence the nine-month spirit diffuses qi full and able to sound; sound surpasses spirit and substance; the nine heavens acclaim and celebrate. The Great One holds the tally; the sovereigns rank and order commands; the registrar records the registers; the destiny masters determine the calculations; the Five Emperors supervise births; the holy mother guards the chambers; the heavenly spirits and earthly deities of the three realms all watch and guard. The Nine Heavens Marshal stands in the courtyard facing east, reading the Scripture of the Nine Heavens’ Birth of Spirit Treasure nine times; if a man, then myriad spirits sing homage; if a woman, myriad spirits sing devotion; if a man, the destiny master reverently consents; if a woman, the destiny master reverently obeys; thus is life given. If the Nine Heavens Marshal does not pronounce the command chapter, and myriad spirits do not sing homage and consent, life is not born. The man who receives rebirth in the human way, bathing in the great sun, startles heaven and shakes earth; even the noble find it hard to surpass. Heaven’s nature and earth’s spirits, the three realms come together, yet they do not lightly act. When time to be born arrives, they do not act meanly. Hence he who loves his form, preserves his spirit, esteems his qi, and strengthens his root, shall never perish but attain spirit-immortality; flesh and spirit shall mount together, ascending to the Three Purities; this is to unite virtue with the three qi, and to combine the nine qi all together. But man receives life yet cannot esteem his qi, honour his form, treasure his destiny, or love his spirit; he brings death and destruction upon himself, departing from his true origin only.

The Chapter of the Nine Heavens’ Birth of Spirits is the flying profound qi of the three caverns, three combined into sound, forming spirit writing; mingling with the myriad spirits, concealing rhyme and inner names, generating qi and shaping form—this is the chapter of nature. The Lord of Heavenly Treasure recites it to open the light of heaven and earth. The Lord of Spiritual Treasure recites it to open the soul of the nine netherworlds’ long night. The Lord of Spirit Treasure recites it to govern myriad spirits. The Great One recites it to perfect body and spirit. The Sovereign recites it to form shape. The Nine Heavens recite it to give birth to man. The scholar recites it to ascend to heaven. The ghost spirits hear it to ascend and transfer. The vulgar hear it to prolong their existence. The dark soul hears it to open salvation. The decayed and corrupt hear it to release smoke. The infant hears it to gain speech. The dead remains hear it to return to manhood. The mysteries of the Three Treasures are the root of myriad things; thus they are not known by ghosts and spirits but heard by the vulgar. Those who study the higher Dao aspire to immortality, and when they achieve release from the corpse, extinguishing transmigration and turning the wheel, they finally return to the way of immortality, with body and spirit united and not separated, both entering the true Dao. Without this scripture, the womb is blocked and stagnant; death qi fixes the root; true images are not preserved; life qi cannot flow; the nine gates are barred; body cannot generate spirit; one only receives a form, as if lodging qi and moving. Those who learn this method may sit to attain nature spontaneously; the Three Treasures are honored, the Nine Heavens true in utmost reality, kept secret in the Great Abundance’s ninefold golden pattern of Purple Yang Jade Terrace. Unless heaven and earth first open, this scripture shall not issue. It is a forbidden scripture of the Primordial; not known to ghosts or spirits; those who steal it shall suffer ten thousand calamities of the wind blade, their souls shall die without birth. Follow the rules and reverence it; body and spirit together become immortals. In the Palace of the Three Origins there is a golden tablet inscribed with purple characters containing the scripture; those to be born again as Three Purities immortals shall attain this scripture. Those with the destined affinity shall bring gold treasure and present it to the master, faithfully follow the rules and covenant, close their hearts and practice reverently, and must not lightly disclose it lest the wind blade test them.

Method of Cultivation: Observe long fasting for a thousand days, withdrawing from worldly affairs; all dust and leakages exhausted; humble the mind and silently recite; hold pure incense and keep the precepts; enter the chamber facing east; knock the teeth nine times through; regulate the voice and correct the qi; chant the precious chapter. When chanted once, the voice is heard in the Nine Heavens; twice chanted, heaven and earth make reverence; thrice chanted, three realms pay homage; four times chanted, the heavenly kings descend as immortals; five times chanted, the Five Emperors attend the truth; six times chanted, the demons bind their bodies; seven times chanted, the stars and constellations suspend their gates; eight times chanted, the dark night brightens; nine times chanted, all under heaven arrive, and all spirits guard the pavilion. One round penetrates heaven, the origin of the womb declares and communicates; two rounds resound the earth, the womb’s knot resolves the root; three rounds spirit honours, the soul gate refines immortality; four rounds the heavenly kings descend, the po gate closes; five rounds the Five Emperors attend the truth, the treasury is clear and cool; six rounds demons submit and comply, the stomach tube generates fluids; seven rounds stars and constellations shine brightly, the orifices open to wisdom; eight rounds the dark night reveals light, the three departments and eight scenes, perfect body and spirit; nine rounds all under heaven arrive, the three passes, five viscera, six bowels, nine palaces, golden towers, jade chambers, twelvefold doors, purple gates, jade pavilions, thirty-six thousand joints, root origin and primal beginning, at once giving birth to spirit. Nine rounds make one complete circuit; one circuit finished, three realms proclaim the name; the Five Emperors distinguish and separate; called the perfect person. Ten circuits pass qi, command myriad spirits, the demon king protects and recommends, arrayed above the heavens. One hundred circuits open spirit, sitting to teach nature spontaneously, the Great One grants the tally, the original lord receives birth. One thousand circuits open the spirit, sitting between life and death, immortal boys and jade maidens serve east and west. Ten thousand circuits complete the path, flying the dragon chariot, ascending the white sun in the morning.

The Primordial Heavenly Sovereign at this time dwells in quiet leisure, lying resting within the Yellow Chamber of the Cloud Palace, in the seven-treasure curtain; serene and simple, pure and true, absorbed in the essence of the cavern, bending over to study the born spirit, managing the subtle great chaos, howling through the Nine Heavens. At this time the flying heavenly great saints, the Infinite Spirit Kings, the Jade Aides and Supreme Officials, the Four Assistants attending morning, observe pure fasting and establish the festival, serving at his side. They rely on jade-like countenances for subtle responsiveness, look up with spiritual eyes to open dignity, secretly grasp the spirit chapter and leap with joy, feast on celestial sounds and receive birth, daring to seize the opportunity and comprehend, venturing with spiritual glance and opening the heart. Then the flying heavenly great saints and Infinite Spirit Kings advance and salute, bow their heads and say, addressed to the Heavenly Sovereign: 'The humble minister is fortunate to meet and serve the spiritual pavilion; not shirking narrowness and smallness, but daring to cleanse the dark ford; again to comprehend condensed profundity; to rise to the rank of spirit king, to govern life and death, to command heavenly immortals, to reward and oversee the seven awakenings, to survey distant regions, to attend the supreme officials, and to serve the morning attendants. Now is the time to seize the occasion and respond; to tread the nine great suns, to understand the cavern’s mysteries and secret talismans; to soothe the people; the great cycle is about to begin; the reckoning ends at Jia Shen; the vast flood washes away filth; disasters fill the heavens; the Three Officials drum their pens, distinguish the various kinds of men, reckon merits and faults, and apportion good and evil.' Since Chi Ming to the first year of the Supreme Sovereign, according to the Original Yang Jade Chest, those to be saved number two hundred and forty thousand. After Kai Huang, counting to Jia Shen, the heavens choose in order; the immortal registers are empty and void; officials and clerks unfilled; wandering and scattered duties; all must select persons. According to the Original Yang Jade Calendar, during the Three Dynasties there is further reckoning; those who mindfully accumulate good and build merit, are raised by the three realms, protected by the Five Emperors, their names in Heaven above; ten thousand are taken to fill their duties. Another twelve thousand are selected to fill reserve posts. Such is the example, some by former names and mysterious charts, some by bone likeness matching immortals, some by causes and conditions of extinction and transmigration, some by devoted love of the Three Treasures, good merits filling heaven, some by offerings to the master treasure and acclaim by the Three Officials, some by cultivating fasts and observing precepts, merits accumulating and inspiring, some by scattering wealth and treasures, establishing Daoist halls, some by rescuing and comforting the poor and needy, aiding the salvation of heavenly men, some by building merit to fill the Three Masters’ duties; the heavenly officials have names, reckonings and registers; the Three Officials correspond, all names entered in reverse order, ranked from top to bottom with no omission. Also the Office of the Nine Netherworlds, governed by the Eastern Flower Blue Palace Nine-Dragon Tally, commands to extract the Nine Netherworld Jade Chest; male and female dead souls, with former names and good merit, deserving to receive salvation, number three hundred and twenty thousand, to fill the ranks after Jia Shen’s expulsion, opening the people of Great Abundance. At this time life and death meet, good and evil are judged; those who deserve it truly rejoice. But the Three Officials are strict, writings complex; the Dragon Gate holds meetings; the Bird Mother supervises immortals; myriad saints manifest their chariots; day and night without rest; merits and faults balanced; life and death unbiased. This confusion is my worry. The great season is close; events occur in turn; I always fear one day to suffer the punishment of the public office. I humbly hear that the Heavenly Sovereign creates great compassionate transformations, bestows pity on all beings, opens the mysteries of the Nine Heavens to aid the people, reveals the laws and prohibitions, which the humble minister may not dare to hear. Yet the great reckoning is fixed; Jia Shen draws near its end; the cycle and salvation hasten; the great law must be put in practice, so that those with heart may, amid reckoning, hear the law’s sound, be enlightened in sight and hearing, and be encouraged and transformed before awakening. Thus I lay this forth, fearing to offend the heavenly countenance, and earnestly praying for compassion, to grant what has not been heard.

Then the Heavenly Sovereign lifted his tall desk, concentrated his spirit and meditated afar; looked up and recited the cavern chapter, howling and chanting in brilliant tones. After a long while, suddenly he sighed: 'The supreme model is vast and boundless; its principle subtle and profound; the Dao reaches the heaviest mysteries; qi crowns the heavenly firmament; it is extremely hard to speak of; the marvel is difficult to surpass. Since you hold the imperial office, charged with the duty of spirit king of flying heavens, winged at the jade palace’s four officials, assisting the bright wheel, gazing afar and surveying, leading and summing the infinite, harmonizing myriad transformations, caring for and reckoning the people; now the great cycle is about to open, the three and five announce the time, one hundred and six respond to the opportunity, yang nine excites and arouses, the great spring drums waves, myriad disasters afflict heaven, the four palaces select and elect to fill the ranks of the people. The Three Dynasties were confused and chaotic; good and evil must be divided. You should labor your mind for the people, weary amid the rise and fall of the Three Officials; matters must be opened and enabled. Now I entrust them to you; be diligent. The precious scripture is subtle and weighty; the spiritual sound of the Nine Heavens; bestowed on the supreme sage; not known to ghosts or spirits. The clear and true pattern appears once in forty thousand kalpas. Now, braving the prohibitions, I entrust it to you secretly; do not lightly transmit it. Summon the Nine Heavens Marshal, attendant immortal jade youth; open the Purple Yang Jade Register, embroidered pouch; issue forth the Scripture of the Nine Heavens’ Birth of Spirit Jade Chapter. The four assistants take their places; the Five Elders oversee the truth; the Great One commands the stars; the Jade Emperor sings the covenant; all rely on the reverence and clarity of true records; facing south, kneel long; and entrust it to the Flying Heaven Infinite Spirit King. After the ritual is complete, the heavens return to their stations.

The Heavenly Sovereign solemnly told the Flying Heaven Spirit King: 'This chapter of the Nine Heavens is the flying profound qi of the three caverns, the three meet in sound, forming the true writing, mingling the myriad spirits, concealing rhyme and inner names. Therefore the Great One practices observation, nurturing life in all directions, leading understanding of the cavern void, opening the oath and cinnabar painting; by countless kalpas and causes and conditions, the former names of emperors and charts may not be seen. Those who obtain the glance at the chapters, the nine ancestors all become immortals. Choose those among men suitable to be immortals; in seven hundred years, observe one thousand days of pure fasting, bring gold and silk, swear the heart and covenant to transmit it. Be careful and you will enjoy blessings; neglect and calamity will come. Enjoy blessings and fortune extending to the nine ancestors, virtue weighing as mountains and seas; invite calamity and be reckoned through countless kalpas, suffer the poison soup, the wind blade cutting and punishing—can you not be careful?'

#### The Chapter of the Primordial Azure Pure Heavenly Treasure

The Primordial Cavern is empty and void, the three qi refined at the upper gate. Purple visage contemplates the great void, four brightnesses plant spirit roots. Wondrous transformation issues forth the eastern jade, three flutter and rise to the western Kunlun. Called the Response of Nine Profound Purities, the Five Blossoms girdled with brocade clouds. The departing net dazzles the spirit lamp, seven essences shine in the northern mystery. Fluttering and soaring above the pure capital, splendid and august is the One Sovereign. Lofty and resplendent is the Most High Chapter; feathered youths are busy and diverse. Flowing fragrance is originally without colour, penetrating into the myriad immortal throngs. Turning left through three flowing kalpas; turning right through nine heavenly gates. Golden splendour with tasselled jade youths; the eight winds dance the empty wheel. The four seasons have no pause in their machinery; blue and white early brightness divides. Ninety-nine renew the kalpa cycle; three threes pass one spring. Heaven and earth have their final meeting; secret impulse returns to overturning. Cavern clarity, the orthodox One method; strictly observing six astronomical texts. Peace returns to emptiness and no-thing; serving and supporting the later sage sovereign.

#### The Chapter of the Primordial White Yu and Remaining Spiritual Treasure

Spiritual wind rises at the western gate; brocade clouds arise at the eastern jade. Three qi shine on the jade islet; flowing fragrance rides the eastern light. Jade splendour scatters with the wind; suddenly brightening the nine clear realms. Forests of soaring shine on the red sun; yellow waters chase the moon’s birth. Within is the child gathering herbs, wearing feathers and donning flying blue. Whirling scenes command myriad winds; carefree banquets on green carriages. Overall commanding nine empty wheels; moving and opening myriad measures. Left commands the three heavenly texts; right commands six heavenly soldiers. Inspecting qi returning to the cavern void; sixfold degrees respond to the cycle’s tipping. The kalpa cycle has its meeting; who can measure defeat or success? Vast waves wheel the spiritual poles; the six directions leave no form behind. White corpses drift the long flow; solitary souls cause renewed spirit. Sad is this coming and going; then perceiving the orthodox law’s light. To learn to add refined cultivation; Eastern Flower binds the jade name. Gladly there are those of the White Tablet, who together rejoice in great peace.

#### The Chapter of the Profound Yellow and Great Vermilion Spirit Treasure

The cavern gate moves the heavenly axis; five qi wheel the three subtleties. Purple gates spit forth jade tablets; golden gates admit the spirit’s radiance. Eight meetings mingle true winds; dazzling brightness and double names open. Beyond the nine clear heavens at the horizon; lofty and high the divine returns. Three colours return to emptiness and no-thing; four seasons respond in jade territory. The river marquis has drummed the pen; the five elements secretly push each other. Six degrees have no final kalpa; the cycle’s peak rides qi returning. Ten thousand demons spread over heaven; fierce villains finally show their might. The people bear disasters and shock; piling corpses make men lament. Wonderful indeed is the orthodox law’s text; the principle of the kalpa is bright and never declines. The utmost time serves to welcome and receive; bound in the Nine Heavens’ flight. I make a pact with you for great peace, releasing the heart and flying without wings.

Thus ends The Scripture of the Three Treasures of Great Abundance, Born of the Nine Heavens of Spiritual Treasure by Nature.
