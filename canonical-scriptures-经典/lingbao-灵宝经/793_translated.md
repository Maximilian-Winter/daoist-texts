#### Prefatory Explanation to the Scripture of the Chapter of the Divine Birth of the Nine Heavens of Natural Lingbao of the Cavernous Mystery

On the Profound Meaning

Originally, the teachings of the Three Caverns and One Vehicle are divided into three great classes: first, the prefatory division; second, the orthodox sectarian division; third, the popular transmission division. Now this scripture is the spiritual writing formed from the qi of the natural Three Caverns, not discoursed by man; therefore the scripture’s title is not prefixed by the title of the Supreme One, nor does its beginning contain the words of the Way; no division of preface is established, nor mention of time or place. The so-called Cavernous Mystery Lingbao is the designation by the expositor that the Way contained therein belongs under the principal division. From the scripture’s beginning to the official of the Supreme Clarity and Supreme Ultimate, it narrates the original traces of the Three Treasures. From this, although the three appellations differ in era and title, their essence is one and the same, differing only from their true origin. It speaks of the Three Qi as the origin of Heaven and Earth and myriad transformations, and that man shares the same root and unites virtue therewith. The inner text is divided into five chapters: the first from these three appellations to the opening light’s praise and proclamation of transformation; the second from the pure and lofty qi to the joint reception of generation, distinguishing the ritual forms and establishing the foundation of the Three Powers; the third from the myriad transformations of Heaven and Earth to the extremity of Heaven and Earth, thus gathering traces and revering the root; the fourth from man’s reception of life to the end of non-birth, speaking of man’s penetration of the Three Powers and the crucial reunion of rebirth; the fifth from man to the true origin, lauding and earnestly exhorting cultivation. Next, from the chapter on the birth of the gods of the Nine Heavens to what is heard, it praises the origin of the chapter, whose merits are boundless. It is divided within into four chapters: the first from the Nine Heavens to the chapter of Nature, praising the chapter’s naturalness, its entirety of body and utility; the second from Heaven Treasure to the birth of man, speaking of the merits of reciting the chapter and the mysterious responses according to measure; the third from the scholar to the selection of men, speaking of the multitude’s returning to the faith, with responses and measure for self-benefit; the fourth from the Three Treasures to what is heard, returning to the root and reverting to silence. Next, from the husband learning the superior Way to ascending in the morning, it praises the teaching and cultivation of merits and their differences, divided within into six chapters: the first from the husband learning the superior Way to sitting in order to attain Nature, lauding encouragement and equal raising; the second from the Three Treasures to the same immortals, speaking of secrecy and reverence; the third from the Three Origins to examining the body, exhorting prior goodness and warning against careless transmission; the fourth from cultivation to the treasure chapter, abandoning affairs and entering the Way, purifying the heart and contracting to the origin; the fifth from one recitation to the birth of the divine at one time, speaking of acting according to the law of the Way and gradual merits; the sixth from nine recitations to one circuit to ascending the morning, this being the sequence of degrees and differences, culminating in the ultimate fruition. The foregoing is the orthodox sectarian division. Since this scripture takes Nature as its principle, no preface division is first established; here at last the sequence of issuing the scripture is set forth. From the Primordial Heavenly Lord to the bestowal of what was unuttered is one section, divided into nine chapters: the first from the Primordial Heavenly Lord to the resounding Nine Heavens, arbitrarily establishing time and place, displaying the appearance and ceremony; the second from this time to the opening of the heart, in which the Divine King responds to the opportunity and will present his own questions; the third from this to attending the morning, arranging the ceremony and opening inquiry, explaining his own office; the fourth from the appropriate time to the division of good and evil, taking advantage of the time to arouse pity and proclaim responsibility to aid good; the fifth from Chiming onward to filling the storage official, explaining the selection of men in the Three Dynasties to fill the positions of immortals; the sixth from such example to none omitted, clarifying the sequence of cause and effect and elucidating the degrees and orders; the seventh from the nine nether palaces to opening the great multitude, explaining the migration and selection of prior goodness to fill the peaceful populace; the eighth from this time to also the minister’s concern, clarifying the different considerations at the meeting and worrying loss of equality; the ninth from the great moment come to the bestowal of what was unuttered, opening heart and self-responsibility, imploring the essentials of the law. Next, from the Heavenly Lord to caution against careless transmission, clarifying the occasion and manner of issuing the scripture. The middle division has two chapters: the first from this Heavenly Lord to the wondrous and difficult transcendence, clarifying the Heavenly Lord’s response to the opportunity and praising the Way about to be delivered; the second from the son’s taking imperial rank to caution against careless transmission, in which the Heavenly Lord praises and exhorts diligence and secrecy. The foregoing is the prefatory division. From issuance of the command to restoration of rank is the division of popular transmission of the law, fully describing the ceremony and regulations. The middle division has two chapters: the first from issuance of the command to the Divine King is the issuing of the command and transmission of the scripture, with all spirits present and ceremony observed; the second says when the ritual is finished, the heavens return to their seats, then after conferring the scripture the ceremony is gathered in and silence restored. This is the popular transmission division. Next, from the Heavenly Lord’s repeated admonition to the need for utmost caution, it praises the great secrecy and then presents the chapter.

Explanation on the Meaning of the Nine Heavens

The “Yuan Dong Yuli Chapter” says: The chaos of primal unity is vast and deep, the great Brahman Miro; the Heavens are not yet divided. The Nine Yang are darkly combined, the Three Causes revolve nine times, six transformations and seven circuits; the Primordial begins to take form; in the first of the Five Eons of transformation, the Brahman Primordial Ancestor Morning Dao Lord commands the Heavenly Origin and governs the Five Eons. Hence the Yuan Dong is so called to name the ancestral qi. The Yuli (Jade Calendar) is so called to record the Heavenly Origin and the turning of the eons five times, returning to one. From the one qi divides, the Three Causes become nine, like dragons and dragonflies, coiling in nine ways, counting the origin of the Nine Yang Ancestral Qi. The Supreme One uses three nines to govern Brahman, three fives to govern the Origin, combining into forty-two qi; three times nine is twenty-seven, three times five is fifteen, together making forty-two. It begins with the green Heaven Ancestral Qi, indicating the origin of the East where the green begins, responding to the Nine Yang Wood King’s beginning, hence the East subdivides into nine qi to govern the heavenly realm, the eon named Dragon Han. Next the Nine Causes repeat; the yang qi opens and shines, red characters flow with light, distributing the five degrees, the mysterious chart and cinnabar script. The Supreme uses three times five, three turns of the red flower, combining twenty-four qi; three times five is fifteen, three times three is nine, together making twenty-four. It begins with the South Cinnabar Heaven Ancestral Qi, indicating the origin of southern cinnabar light, responding to the Three Yang Fire King’s beginning; hence the South divides into three qi to govern the heavenly realm, the eon named Chi Ming. Next the Nine Origins accumulate again; the central yellow transforms the Origin, the Heavenly Weave circuits around, Brahman Origin governs five. The Supreme uses five times five three circuits, mixed yang twelve, combining fifty-two qi; five times five is twenty-five, five times three is fifteen, plus twelve numbers, together making fifty-two. It begins with the Middle Yellow Heaven Ancestral Qi, indicating the origin of central spiritual yellow splendour, responding to the Five Yang Earth King’s beginning; hence the Centre divides into twelve qi to govern the heavenly realm, the eon named Shang Huang. Next the Nine Origins repeat cause; the simple brightness initiates yang, seven lights shine and illuminate Brahman, five weaves govern Heaven. The Supreme uses seven times five three turns, combining thirty-six qi; three times seven is twenty-one, three times five is fifteen, together making thirty-six. It begins with the Simple Spiritual Heaven Ancestral Qi, indicating the origin of western simple bright light, responding to the Seven Yang Metal King’s beginning; hence the West divides into seven qi to govern the heavenly realm, the eon named Yan Kang. Next the Nine Causes complete the cycle; chaos transforms and returns to the root, the one qi initiates brightness. The Supreme uses two times five multiplied by thirteen, accumulating primordial yang to combine thirty qi, saying two times five multiply as ten, thrice that ten, together making thirty. It begins with the North Mysterious Heaven Ancestral Qi, indicating the origin of mysterious dark upper light, responding to the One Yang Water King’s beginning; hence the North divides into five qi to govern the heavenly realm, the eon named Kai Huang. The “Guishan Xuanlu” says: The Heavenly Lord gathers the Yuan Dong qi to compose the Yuli book, taking Dragon Han as the initial eon, Chi Ming as the middle eon, and Yan Kang as the final eon. The “Lingzhang Jing” says: Dragon Han follows the Yan Kang border, the eon named Chi Ming. The Supreme dwells at the beginning of chaos, riding the prenatal qi, the ancestor of myriad transformations, accumulating yang to form Heaven. Yang numbers are odd; Heaven’s number is twenty-five: one, three, five, seven, nine. One dwells in the North; one and six have no fixed place, placed in the Centre, as the beginning of distribution. The middle position faces South; hence the sequence of qi distribution begins in the South. Next, three occupies the South; it cannot lack its opposite. Hence North is the opposite of South; and next five occupies it. The prenatal distribution of qi is all in reverse numbers. Qi has extension and contraction; hence positions have reverse and forward order, and the reverse is thereby forward. Hence from the North to the West, next seven occupies it; from the West to the South, next nine occupies it. The East obtains the number nine, ending and beginning here; this nine is the origin of myriad things and the basis of the posterior Heaven’s application. Numbers end at nine and transform at thirty-six. Three, five, seven, nine make twenty-four, arrayed about the four directions; the Centre has no place for one or six, void in the middle, operating twelve qi, to make thirty-six. The prenatal distribution of qi begins with one from the Centre. The posterior Heaven’s operation of qi uses five occupying the middle position. One begins and ends; hence doubling one makes two; one extends and one contracts, hence doubling five makes ten, combining to twelve. Numbers transform to thirty-six; twenty-four are arrayed outside, obtaining one and surrounding three as two, hence the twelve numbers preserved in the Centre. Thirty-six is the transformation of nine; hence the five eons are divided, all heavenly realms speak of nine. Observe the law of the five sons returning to geng: gengzi occupies one yet contains the twelve branches’ full qi, also one principle. The five sons’ origin is the West’s Jiazi metal seven number meeting geng; North’s Bingzi water five number meeting geng; South’s Wuzi fire three number meeting geng; East’s Renzi wood nine number meeting geng; Centre’s Gengzi earth is the unmoving one, to which the four sons return, hence uniting the twelve earthly branches’ qi. Why must geng be met? Because it is the transformation of the qi’s number. Then the number combined of five directions, what is it? It also begins from the Centre, emptily governing the four directions’ numbers; hence three, five, seven, nine are in the four directions, the root of twenty-four qi, without place for one or six, divided among the four directions, each obtaining seven, making twenty-eight constellations’ origin. One and six originally call the North, because one is the Heaven’s origin, six is the Earth’s origin, and five is the number of the Centre, hence no fixed position. Each of the four directions has its equipment, so that one and five mutually appear in the Central North, combining their number as six. One is the beginning of the number of birth; six is the beginning of the number of completion; hence the Primordial dwells there as the origin of generation. The union of twenty-four with twenty-eight is the fifty-two combined in the Centre. The prenatal numbers are distributed in reverse, hence beginning South before North, West before East, like the sequence of three, five, seven, nine. The posterior Heaven’s qi proceeds in order; hence Wood, then Fire, then Earth, then Metal, then Water, are the operation of the five eons. The Supreme hides one in the Centre as the origin of resources; one hidden means six functions. Thus it sums the six of the four directions and distributes on the southern face as twenty-four; adding six more to the North makes thirty; next West’s thirty-six and East’s forty-two also add six. Six is already used; further hidden use makes forty-two and thirty-six, thirty-six and thirty, thirty and twenty-four; twenty-four is the four directions’ three, five, seven, nine. Dividing and combining, combining and dividing, this is the utmost mystery of creation and transformation. The so-called responders lie in their directions, accordingly responding to their numbers. This Supreme hides the Heavenly One and divides the heavenly realm, reusing its six as the origin of myriad transformations and generation.

#### Exposition on the Scripture of the Chapter of the Divine Birth of the Nine Heavens of Natural Lingbao of the Cavernous Mystery, Scroll One

Composed by Daoist Guishan Dong Sijing of Qingyuan Tianqing Temple

Explanation of the Scripture’s Title

This scripture is the spiritual writing formed from the flying mysterious qi of the Three Caverns’ natural qi, transcending visual and auditory perception, emerging beyond the surface of names and words, revered by myriad spirits and honoured by myriad sages. It is secreted in the Purple Yang Jade Terrace of the Mysterious Capital. Because the Flying Heavenly Divine King pitied the disasters of the late world, numbered nine hundred and six, he personally worshipped the Heavenly Lord and earnestly requested proclamation. Thereupon the High Perfect Ones descended and bestowed it; the world obtained it and transmitted it. The so-called Cavernous Mystery Lingbao is the designation of one division among the Three Caverns. The Chapter of the Divine Birth of the Nine Heavens of Nature is a title of one item in that division. The Three Caverns are Dongzhen, Dongxuan, and Dongshen. Dong means emptiness and communication without externality; Xuan means mysterious and unfathomable; this is the original body of the Way, embracing and penetrating the Three Powers, blending all existence and not to be questioned. Lingbao is a representation of the formlessness of divine transformation, honoured by myriad sages. In man, it means unobstructed penetration, called Dong; responsive without obstruction, called Xuan; divine wisdom and transformation, called Ling; qi condensed and wondrous, called Bao. Nature Nine Heavens Divine Birth means naturally clear in its body, nine heavens show its traces, divine birth manifests its function. Its body is a mixture, arising without dependence, hence called Nature. Nine is the yang number starting with one and ending with nine. Heaven is the trace in which principle is lodged. Divine birth is by Heaven decreed to man, that is, to birth the divine. The spirit is formless; it must obtain the qi of the Nine Heavens, then it can lodge and have infinite wondrous uses. Chapter means the writing brightly arranged into sections. Scripture is the name of recording the Way, a canon always in operation through eternity.

Heavenly Treasure Lord is the honoured deity of the Great Cavern; Heavenly Treasure Elder is the ancestral qi of the Heavenly Treasure Lord.

This speaks the origin of teaching and trace. The master of the Dongzhen teaching is Heavenly Treasure as trace, ancestral qi as root. Ancestral qi is the qi of the Great Mixed Cavernless Supreme High Jade Emperor. Heavenly Treasure Lord is the ancestor of myriad ways, hence the venerable deity of the Great Cavern. Heaven means profound mystery, taking nature as principle, hence called Heaven. Treasure is a title of utmost preciousness. Lord is a title of supreme honour, meaning respected by all living beings. Not called the venerated deity of Dongzhen, but called Great Cavern because the Three Caverns are not yet divided, taken as the Great Cavern. Like the two forms not yet divided, called chaos. The venerated deity means its master; lofty and unbounded, revered as supreme. Qi mother mingled and formed, unfathomable called spirit; this is the rational qi. Also called Elder, the master and most honoured and foremost of the qi.

Elder is the qi of the Great Mixed Cavernless Supreme High Jade Emperor, ninety-nine trillion and nine hundred ninety billion qi. Later, in the first year of Dragon Han, Heavenly Treasure Lord was generated; at time of issuing the book called the Supreme High Great Having Jade Clarity Palace.

Great Mixed Cavernless means mingled as not divided; cavern means emptiness and communication; great means utmost vastness; none means true void. This reveals the original body of the Great Way, deep and penetrating, born before Heaven and Earth, truly without form to be grasped, hence called Great Mixed Cavernless. But if only said Great Mixed Cavern and not None, then Great Mixed Cavern would almost be reduced to a thing, insufficient as origin of Heaven and Earth and myriad things. If only said None and not Great Mixed Cavern, then None would revert to emptiness and silence, insufficient as pivot of yin-yang myriad transformations. Called Yuan means unified and principal, and is the basis of generation. High and Supreme Jade Emperor’s qi is the base of the Three Treasures; all appear as words and names; hence commonly called Supreme; but tracing back, Jade Clarity is highest, hence added title High Supreme. Emperor means illustrious; King means encompassing virtue. This subtle root, though again spirit and void, has the virtue of splendour and encompassing, is the ancestor of qi, supreme and precious, where principle lodges. Ninety-nine trillion and nine hundred ninety billion qi is before chaos, having no years to record, therefore only called qi, numbers accumulated to this, then the Dragon Han eon opens. Nine is the yang number. Scripture says: accumulated yang forms Heaven. Dragon Han first year gave birth to Heavenly Treasure Lord. Dragon Han is the name of the first eon, belonging to the Eastern heavenly realm. The first year is the initial time, not the present year count. Transformation and birth means having but no form, no form but having essence, not born of form, hence called transformation. As the “Dongshen Jing” says: wondrous image without form, responsive with body, true essence wondrous qi, transforming into appearance. The latter two sayings agree. This is the image without image, not form of form, only the Way is the body, not belonging to emptiness or existence. Issued book means at the beginning of the Dragon Han eon, issuing the Dongzhen twelve divisions’ books. Moreover, at that time, persons not yet appearing, how could there be books? One must know this text is the condensation of qi. When qi arises, the book is complete; the reason for the qi is the principle of the book. High Supreme Great Having Jade Clarity official is the place of Heavenly Treasure Lord’s governance.

Lingbao Lord is the venerated deity of Dongxuan; Lingbao Elder is the ancestral qi of Lingbao Lord.

This Lingbao Lord is the master of Dongxuan teaching; all meanings seen before. Elder is the red mixed Great None Supreme Mysterious Jade Void qi, ninety-nine million nine hundred ninety-nine thousand qi. Red is the colour of the South. This means the bright lustre of colour, also indicating the forthcoming image of the red writing. Yet although there are four colours but not divided, hence said red mixed. Since stated red mixed, it can be named in existence. Also stated Great None, it can be named in non-existence. Now combined and spoken, it shows true void and wondrous existence, mixed without interval, being the origin of myriad transformations. The “Duren Jing” says: mixed cavern red script, without supreme truth. Also this meaning. See above for Jade meaning. Void means the body is originally empty and hollow, fully possessing the virtue of supreme jade. Principle exists but not really as form or vessel, always called self empty communication.

Later, at Dragon Han open chart, born Lingbao Lord. The scripture one eon to Chi Ming first year issued the book “Duren”, called Supreme Clarity Mysterious Capital Jade Capital Seven Treasures Purple Subtle Palace.

Previously, Dragon Han first year gave birth to Heavenly Treasure Lord; now Dragon Han open chart gives birth to Lingbao Lord. The first year is the initial eon, called open chart as transformation origin manifesting, the writing already revealed and Lingbao Lord born at this time. Chi Ming is the name of the second eon, belonging to the Southern heavenly realm. Scripture one eon is the Dragon Han eon. This Lingbao Lord was born in the midst of Dragon Han and issued the book at the beginning of Chi Ming. Adding “Duren” (to save man) means Lingbao Lord is truly the ancestor of transmission and salvation. Mysterious Capital Jade Capital Seven Treasures Purple Subtle official is the office governed by Lingbao Lord, also the place where scriptures are hidden.

Divine Treasure Lord is the venerated deity of Dongshen; Divine Treasure Elder is the ancestral qi of Divine Treasure Lord. Elder is the dark silent mysterious communication primordial supreme jade void qi, ninety-nine million nine hundred ninety thousand black qi. Later, at Chi Ming first year gave birth to Divine Treasure Lord; the scripture two eons to Shanghuang first year issued the book, called Three Sovereigns Dongshen Supreme Clarity Supreme Ultimate Palace.

Divine means transformation unfathomable, transcendent without burden. The Treasure Lord’s explanation is the same as before. Dongshen teaching master is Divine Treasure as trace, dark silent mysterious communication primordial supreme jade void qi as root. Dark means obscure in Han, silent means calm and peaceful, mysterious means not obstructed, communication means unobstructed. This reveals the subtle root, though dark and desolate and four extremes, deep and calm and peaceful, yet always communicating without obstruction, truly without retardation. Remaining meanings as before. Commonly called Yuan, because all equal as the chief of myriad good, the original beginning of myriad transformations. But these three, the former two Yuan both called Great None, the latter two qi both called Jade Void; the Yuan in the middle and qi both encompassed, is the root above; the qi below is rooted in the middle; hence the middle Yuan and qi both combine the two, is it not the way for one stream to circulate without interval? In Chi Ming first year born Divine Treasure Lord, scripture two eons to Shanghuang first year issued the book, called Three Sovereigns Dongshen Supreme Clarity Supreme Ultimate Palace. The scripture has Dragon Han and Chi Ming as two eons; Shanghuang is the Central eon’s name, when Dongshen teaching master descends, the Three Sovereigns Dongshen Supreme Clarity Supreme Ultimate official is the name of his residence. Carefully observe the accumulation of qi of the three origins, their numbers differing. From Shangyuan to Zhongyuan the numbers reduced are already greatly unequal, and below even less than above; it can be seen the pace of transit accelerates, like a person’s body shrinking, growing stronger, then growing old.

Although these three appellations differ in years and titles, their essence is one and the same. Divided into the mysterious primordial three qi to govern the Three Treasures; all three qi’s venerated deities are called birth of the three qi; the three appellations combined produce nine qi.

From non-being to being, being is forcibly named. From one to three, three not separated from one. Though the three origins’ appellations differ, their essence is the same, returning to one. Year difference is the division of Dragon Han, Chi Ming, and Shanghuang; title difference is the distinction of Jade Clarity, Supreme Clarity, and Supreme Clarity (Taoist ranks). Yet actually rooted in the Primordial ancestral qi, summing in Dongzhen’s superior way. Hence it is said their essence is one. When receiving them one does not see their head, following them one does not see their tail; is this not the utmost subtlety of the body? When numbered by year and named by qi, are not these traces named? Yet the traces never leave the body, and the body never is differently described. Divided into the mysterious primordial three qi to govern. Or referring to the “Seven Signs of Chaos”: one qi divides into mysterious primordial three qi, governing the Three Treasures. Then to govern the Three Treasures is a sentence not yet settled. Above says these three appellations, below says the essence is one; this subsumes the three as one. Also says division into three qi is one becoming three. The “Three Heavens True Law Scripture” says: Primordial qi is blue, blue qi refined and pure called Clear Subtle Heaven; Yuan qi is white, white qi refined and pure called Yu Yu Heaven; mysterious qi is yellow, yellow qi refined and pure called Great Red Heaven. The three qi are all born in emptiness and cavity, dividing one into three to govern the Three Heavens’ administration, then to guide and command the world. The Three Treasures are Heavenly Treasure, Lingbao, and Divine Treasure. These are the masters among qi, called venerated deities. The three qi are the mysterious primordial. Numbered birth of the three qi means each appellation again produces three qi, hence three appellations combined produce nine qi. The “Zhengfa Jing” says: The three heavens being established, primordial qi produces chaos, chaos qi produces blue, blue qi refined and pure produces Yudan Limitless Heaven; chaos qi produces cavern, cavern qi red, producing Limitless Longevity Heaven; cavern qi produces bright, bright qi blue, producing Brahma Supervising Xu Yan Heaven; yuan qi produces vast, or written as light, vast qi green, producing Doushu Heaven; vast qi produces light, light qi yellow, producing Not Proud Joy Heaven; light qi produces conceal, conceal qi white, producing Transformation Responsive Voice Heaven; mysterious qi produces fusion, fusion qi produces Brahma Assist Heaven; fusion qi produces flame, flame qi green, producing Clear Bright Heaven; flame qi produces develop, develop qi black, producing No Thought Heaven. The nine qi are all born within the upper three qi, with the upper qi differing by nine hundred million eons. In man’s body, the three qi and three treasures are the primordial spirit, primordial qi, primordial essence, residing in man’s three dantian, dividing and residing in nine palaces.

The nine qi arise before the supreme emptiness, hidden within the cavity. No light, no image, no form, no name, no colour, no trace, no sound, no voice.

The “True Scripture of Dispelling Demons and Guarding the One” says: One is called the Beginning of Non-Being, that is Jade Clarity; Two is called Yuan Dong, that is Supreme Clarity; Three is called Mysterious Emptiness, that is Supreme Ultimate. These arise before supreme emptiness, originating in the Beginning of Non-Being unseen qi, called primordial spirit. Hidden within the cavity, this is called Yuan Dong and Mysterious Emptiness, called primordial qi and primordial essence. At this time, looking at it one does not see, hearing it one does not hear. Therefore no light, no image, no form, no name, no colour, no trace, no sound, no voice. Beholding it at the beginning, it is void and without mark, at first no sound or smell to seek. Yet the principle of yin-yang movement and stillness, all are contained therein. This is why it is the root of guidance and governance of the world.

To guide and govern is to enlighten and to control. If there is a cause making it so, this is the pivot of mysterious operation, the record and order of creation; the two forms open and the three qi transform and communicate. The three colours are blue, white, and yellow. The three qi are beginning, yuan, and mysterious. When these three colours are united as one, obscure and chaotic, about to divide but not yet divided, sometimes existing and sometimes not, sometimes separated and sometimes united, suddenly present and suddenly absent, when the darkness has lasted long, the operation pushes forward and numbers correspond. When the numbers are fulfilled, qi opens light. The light and pure belong to yang, therefore float above and are lofty and pure; accumulating they become Heaven. The heavy and turbid belong to yin, therefore stagnate below and condense sediment; accumulating they become Earth. From the opening light of the three qi to the formation of Heaven and Earth, all is its sequence.

The nine qi arrange correctly: sun, moon, stars and constellations, yin and yang, five elements, people and things, all receive generation. The next chapter distinguishes ritual forms and establishes the foundation of the Three Powers.

This speaks that the nine qi are the root of myriad things, as the scripture states. The “Zhengfa Jing” says: three times three produce nine origins. To arrange is to be ordered; to be correct is to be constant and not perverse. In the midst of chaos, splendidly ethical, not borrowing from each other, nor invading each other, this is the unified principal and the gathered origin. The sun is the essence of the great yang; the moon is the essence of the great yin. The stars, according to the “Star Scripture Preface”, are born of the Earth’s body and their essence emitted to Heaven. The constellations are the arranged stars. Yin and yang are the motions and stillness, extension and contraction of the primordial qi, from which yin and yang are divided. The five elements have their substance in the Earth and their qi moving in Heaven. Speaking of substance, their birth sequence is water, fire, wood, metal, earth. Speaking of qi, their movement sequence is wood, fire, earth, metal, water. Even the multitude of people and things, all arise from the nine qi arranged correctly.

Heaven and Earth and myriad transformations are truly nurtured by the three origins, guided by the nine qi; none can be born without them. The three qi are honoured by Heaven and Earth; the nine qi are the root of myriad things; therefore the three united form virtue, the extremity of Heaven and Earth. The next chapter speaks of gathering traces and revering the root.

Nurture means to cherish and nourish; guide means to push and operate. Gods, spirits, divine emperors, born of Heaven and Earth, can only be nurtured by the three origins. The forms of things flow and shape, each correct in nature and destiny, can only be guided by the nine qi. This is the reason for recording and ordering creation and flowing through ancient and modern, being the honour of Heaven and Earth and the root of myriad things. The three united form virtue, the extremity of Heaven and Earth means three and nine, nine and three, returning again to one. The “Zhengfa Jing” says: from nine return to one, entering the Way’s truth. Considering their origin of creation and nurture, one knows the true virtue of the three origins is a complete unity, void and without mark, standing supreme before Heaven and Earth, and serving as the norm of Heaven and Earth’s myriad transformations. Therefore, their bestowing to myriad things is without lack or surplus, called descending the heart.

Man’s reception of life in the womb is nurtured by the three origins, the nine qi condense form; hence the nine-month divine distribution, qi full and able to sound. Sound is also the spirit gate complete. The Nine Heavens proclaim celebration. Taiyi holds the tally; the emperor commands the ranking of fate. Records and registers are kept; the five emperors supervise life; the holy mother guards the chamber. Heavenly spirits and Earthly deities guard the three realms. The Nine Heavens Si Ma are in the courtyard, facing East reading the Nine Heavens Divine Birth Treasure Chapter’s nine recitations. Males have myriad spirits chanting reverently; females have myriad spirits chanting in service. Males have the director of fate respectfully promising; females have the director of fate respectfully obeying. Thus life is born. The Nine Heavens Si Ma do not descend the fate chapter; myriad spirits do not chant reverently, then life will not be born. The next chapter speaks of man’s penetration of the Three Powers, the vital meeting of rebirth.

The three qi are honoured by Heaven and Earth; the nine qi are the root of myriad things. Only man is born in the womb, sharing the endowment of Heaven, Earth, and myriad things; therefore he is most spiritual and uniquely precious, being the heart of Heaven and Earth. The three origins nurture, thus born and nurtured by Heaven and Earth, being their master; man obtains this as nature, holding the inherent goodness. The nine qi condense form, circulating between two, bestowing to myriad things, being the root and origin of myriad things; man obtains their correctness as his body, the source of condensed form. Nine months sufficient, qi of the Nine Heavens completely descends; spirit is lodged in this qi, blending without interval; hence qi full and spirit also pervading the whole body. Sound is the excitation of spirit qi. To hold sound is to take spirit and complete it. The Nine Heavens proclaim celebration, because Heaven regards living beings as heart; therefore the Nine Heavens’ emperors, through their qi’s unceasing flow, accomplish the growth of man and praise and rejoice. Taiyi holds the tally; the “Taidan Yinshu” says: Taiyi, the prince, Baiyuan, director of fate, Tao Kang, five gods ascend to the Purple Chamber, each offering a green jade table, upon which are five talismans, presenting in order to the emperor. This means Taiyi holding the tally is the chief of five gods. The “Great Dong Yu Jing” says: Taiyi the divine master, holds the omen tally book on the left. Taiyi is the spirit of returning to the womb and beginning form; named as effort in the day; man’s first birth holds the tally and mixes myriad gods. After birth, he guards man’s jade pillow under the mud ball’s rear gate. Emperor commands the ranking of fate, master of records and registers; Emperor Fenglingfan is also called Jiangzi Lingfan, named Seven Spirits or Divine Elder, grading and dividing fate’s ranks. Man having been born, guards between the eyebrows in the purple gate’s outer palace. Master of records is the recording master; registers means the writing of the fate register. Director of fate determining calculation is the central director of fate elder, also named Li Ming, first fixing the calculations. After form is born, guards the red palace in man’s heart chamber at the blood gate. The five emperors supervise birth, being the emperors of the five directions. Qing Emperor is Diao Liang Ji; Chi Emperor is Chang Lai Jue; Bai Emperor is Peng or called Zhang An Xing; Hei Emperor is Bao Cheng Chang; Huang Emperor is Lin Xu Fu or called Han Guang Lu. They all supervise man’s birth together. Holy mother guards the chamber, being the holy mother of the Nine Heavens, guarding the chamber and room. Heavenly spirits and Earthly deities guard the three realms. In Heaven called spirits because of their unfathomable yin-yang; on Earth called deities because of their decay manifesting to man. The three realms are upper, middle, and lower, Heaven, Earth, and Water three realms’ spirits. Fully assembled and guarding, meaning none fail to reverently protect. The Nine Heavens Si Ma is the chief celestial Si Ma Bingsheng, Baichengxu born. The courtyard is the central position; East is the direction of life’s qi. The nine recitations are the chapter’s sufficient number. Males chant reverently and with respectful promise, meaning honour and celebration. Females chant in service and with respectful obedience, meaning joy and compliance. This distinguishes respect and humility, high and low. Fate chapter means the nine chapters. The so-called not descending the fate chapter means not born at the end; for contrary and favorable, auspicious and inauspicious, life and death are one mechanism; hence reverse this and cannot be born. ○ The above gods’ names come from the “Three Heavens Lords’ Records”.

Man obtains returning birth in the human path, washing form by the sun, startling Heaven and shaking Earth, his honour hard to surpass. Heavenly truth and Earth gods, the three realms all present, are likewise not light. At birth time, also not base.

Returning birth means Heaven’s principle mingled and human’s innate possession; obtaining it is birth, losing it is death. Hence born in the human path, Heaven’s principle returns. Washing form by the sun means departing extreme yin and bathing in extreme yang. The Shu commentary says: Having just obtained the human body, one must go to the South Cinnabar Fire refining pool, wash with the true yellow flower water, then take the body and enter the abode, then can become man. Not called yellow flower but sun. Yellow flower is the essence of yang, in the sun’s upper pavilion, also named Cave Yang Palace. Within is a pool of flowing fire; the pool has true yellow flower water, into which heavenly men often pour to wash the form and visage, coexisting therein. ○ Man’s spirit unites with the Three Treasures’ virtue, qi with the nine heavens same root, head and feet resembling Heaven and Earth, seven orifices responding to the three lights, three powers communicating, their mechanism one. It is fitting to startle Heaven and shake Earth, honour is hard to surpass, the three realms all present, are not light, at birth time, also not base. Then to be human, can one not honour oneself?

Therefore one can cherish the form, preserve the spirit, honour the qi, strengthen the root, never dying or decaying and obtaining divine immortality; flesh and bone fly together, ascending to the Three Purities, uniting with the three qi’s virtue and nine qi’s concomitance. But man obtains life and does not honour his qi, nor value his form, nor treasure his fate, nor cherish his spirit, thus bringing death and decay, departing from his true origin. The next chapter praises earnest exhortation to cultivation.

Moreover, man’s form resembles Heaven and follows Earth, responds to the Three Powers and embodies the Five Elements; blood and qi’s nourishment, wisdom’s dependence, can it be unloved? Yet form is not mere form; it must have that which makes form persist. Therefore one must also preserve the spirit. The “Nanhua Jing” says: pure and unmixed, still and unchanging, bland and without action, moving thus according to Heaven, this is the way of nourishing the spirit. To honour its qi is to be frugal and not dare to misuse. To strengthen its root is to guard it and not depart from its origin. Hence it is said: guard the centre and embrace the one, completely accord with Heaven. This is the meaning of never dying and decaying. Thus it begins with loving form and ends with practicing form; begins with preserving spirit and ends with exhausting spirit; then riding cloud qi to roam Supreme Clarity, uniting with the three qi’s virtue and nine qi’s concomitance. If one reverses this, how soon is decay and separation from the true origin? It is self-inflicted. ○ From the three appellations to this, divided into five chapters.

The Chapter of the Divine Birth of the Nine Heavens is the flying mysterious qi of the Three Caverns, three united into sound, condensing spiritual writing, mingling myriad gods, hidden rhyme and inner names, producing qi and condensing form; a chapter of nature. The previous chapter praises Nature’s complete body and utility.

This states the chapter’s writing is the united flying mysterious qi of the Three Caverns, condensing into sound, hence called three united into sound, condensing spiritual writing, mingling myriad gods, hidden rhyme and inner names, and having the function of producing qi and condensing form. Hidden rhyme is the hidden rhyme of the various heavens; inner names are the inner names of myriad gods.

Heavenly Treasure recites it to open Heaven and Earth’s light. Lingbao recites it to open the soul of the long night of the Nine Netherworlds. Divine Treasure recites it to govern myriad spirits. Taiyi recites it to complete body and spirit. Emperor recites it to condense form. Nine Heavens recite it to give birth to man. The previous chapter says reciting the chapter’s merits, mysterious responses according to measure. Scholars recite it to ascend Heaven.

Heavenly Treasure Lord manifested at the beginning of Dragon Han; at that time above was no colour again, below no abyss again, vast and deep great Brahman, boundless and without light. Heavenly Treasure opened and differentiated by the Chapter of Nature; then arranged highs and lows, Heaven and Earth opened light. Lingbao Lord manifested at Dragon Han open chart, ancestor of saving man, thus opening the soul of the long night of the Nine Netherworlds. Divine Treasure Lord manifested at Chi Ming first year, truly master of myriad gods, thus said to govern myriad spirits; govern meaning total command. Taiyi is the chief of myriad gods; thus reciting it completes spirit within the body. Emperor is Fenglingfan. Condense form means condensing qi into form. Nine Heavens means emperors of the Nine Heavens. The foregoing is to speak the merits of reciting the chapter, the act benefiting others. Reciting and hearing correspond; reciting is bestowing benefits, hearing is receiving benefits. Scholars dwell between the six opposites, thus benefiting themselves; when successful, then benefiting others. Although according to usage, merits differ, yet truly one Way.

Ghosts and spirits hearing it ascend and advance. Ordinary men hearing it extend life. Wandering souls hearing it open salvation. Withered and rotten hearing it emit smoke. Infants hearing it gain speech. Dead bones hearing it return to man. The previous chapter speaks of the multitude’s returning and relying, responses and measure for self-benefit.

Emitting smoke is like warm air rising to vapor, to produce life. Smoke is the harmonized qi. The “Great Dong Jing” says: seven mysteries arise again, how much more the vapor of light. 

The three treasures’ divine mysteries are the root of myriad things’ birth. Hence not known by ghosts and spirits, but heard by ordinary men. The previous chapter says ghosts and spirits hearing it ascend and advance, ordinary men hearing it extend life; now it says not known or heard by ghosts, spirits, or ordinary men, why? Because the previous spoke of the nine chapters’ profound功, which is the Way’s most manifest use; here discusses the three treasures’ divine mystery, the Way’s most subtle essence. Root is like grass and trees’ roots, unseen by man, yet truly the basis of growth and flourishing. Yet the earlier said ghosts and spirits hearing it ascend and advance and ordinary men hearing it extend life, but now says not known or heard by ghosts and spirits or ordinary men, why? Because the former spoke of the nine chapters’ profound功, the Way’s most manifest use; this speaks of the three treasures’ divine mystery, the Way’s most subtle essence. ○ From the Chapter of the Divine Birth of the Nine Heavens to this, divided into four chapters.

The husband learns the superior Way, hopes and longs for immortals, and obtains corpse liberation, extinction and transmigration, finally returning to the immortal Way, form and spirit united, not separated, all entering the Way truth.

The “Eight Element True Scripture” says: Supreme Way Three, Upper True Way Seven, Middle True Way Six, Lower True Way Eight. And the nine chapters are the gate of the Great Cavern; the cave scriptures are in the upper true Way’s fifth grade; therefore called superior Way. Corpse liberation is the five liberations’ kind. Extinction transmigration wheel means, as the “Duren Jing” says, the late learning’s Way is shallow, the immortal grade not complete, operation corresponds to extinction and transmigration. It also says the transmigration wheel is not extinguished, then obtaining spirit and immortals. Learning and longing are things sought but not attained; hence sometimes corpse liberation and extinction transmigration wheel. Yet if with this intention and learning unceasingly, finally must return to the immortal Way, thus obtaining form and spirit united, not separated, both entering the Way truth. All learning’s功 must reach the Way truth, then is the ultimate place. Yet to reach Way truth, this text is indispensable.

Without this text, the womb’s formation stagnates, death qi firmly rooted, true brightness not guarded, living qi irregular, nine gates blocked, body not born spirit, merely receiving form, as if qi were lodged and acting. Learning this method, one may sit and attain Nature. The prior chapter praises encouragement to equality.

Man is born in the womb, all receiving qi of the Nine Heavens, condensing to become man. Having been born, the womb contains twelve nodes, coiling around the five viscera. The five viscera stagnate gates, knots cannot be untied, nodes cannot be extinguished. Hence man’s sickness arises from knot stagnation, man’s life ends from knot firmness. The “Qingling Yang An Yuanjun Daojing” says: five viscera hundred knots cause myriad diseases; mysterious one Lin Xu opens gates and unties knots; knots break and disease scatters; spirit and essence overflow; immortal Way daily advances, death Way daily ceases. Each chapter in the Great Cavern has this meaning. Because if the womb root is not severed, it is hard to escape reincarnation; if knots untied not, no living qi may arise. This is the crucial secret of divine birth, first task of true cultivation. Merely receiving a form, as if lodging qi and acting, means though having this body, ignorance of the Way of divine birth, what difference from a walking corpse? Knowing this text and sitting to advance this Way, then mingling myriad gods, transforming into the One Emperor, entering non-being and producing being, dancing the empty mysterious wheel, sitting to attain Nature, surely not in error.

The three treasures are venerated, the Nine Heavens most true, secret in the Great Having, Nine-fold golden lattice Purple Yang Jade Terrace. Without opening Heaven and Earth, the text does not appear. The Primordial forbids the book; ghosts and spirits do not hear it. To steal it is ten-thousand eons of wind blades, soul
