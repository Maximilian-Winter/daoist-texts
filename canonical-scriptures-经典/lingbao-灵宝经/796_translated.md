### The Supreme Mysterious Spiritual Treasure of the Many Heavens: The Innate Sounds of the Jade Characters of Nature, Scroll One

#### The Great Brahman’s Hidden Words: The Infinite Mysterious Chapter Jade Formula

The Celestial True Sovereign said: ‘The “Heavenly Book Jade Characters” condense the mysterious qi of flight to form the spiritual script, combining the eight gatherings to form sounds, harmonizing the five combinations to complete the chapter. When the great cycle opens, the exquisite jade manifests spontaneously; the divine wind plays in emptiness, the harmonious sounds resound throughout the caverns, shining brightly above the many heavens and radiantly illuminating the profound Void, transforming together with the Dragon River, unveiling the crimson brightness at Yankan.  
Refining water and fire amid life and death, enduring through countless kalpas, opening the eight celestial enclosures in the dark nexus, planting spiritual radiance in the sun, the two principles hold to discern, the three illuminations distribute.  
The Supreme Sage rides upon it with radiance, the Five Mountains treasure it with spirit; all obtain life thereby, and nations prosper and enjoy peace thereby.  
Vast and majestic is the great model, lofty and revered the highest honour; from the One comes the Non-Being, the root of Heaven and Earth. Those who obtain it do not die; those who serve it endure; those who treasure it descend in truth; cultivating it, one becomes an immortal; crossing death’s remnants through the long night, refining the living soul in the vermilion palace.  
The wondrous transformative script issues from Nature, mingled but not turbid, clarified but not purified, destroyed but not extinguished, extinguished but reborn, noble and elegant, the ancestor of the countless emperors of the supreme Void, mighty and vast, hard to name.’
