The Primordial Heavenly Worthy said: When the Red Brightness first opened, and Chaos began to divide, the primal thread unfolded and the Most High composed it. The Dragon Han was dark and obscure; the red characters brilliant and splendid — a natural heavenly text, subtle and difficult to expound. It dwells in the mystery of mysteries, called the Sea True, the Dragon King Elder. The King of the Sea True is the truth within the sea, his place therein covered by star vapors, thus named the Mysterious Origin. One hundred and eighty spirit seas, each with over ten thousand vast springs, the springs connect to water sacs, which press forth and create thirty-two minor heavens. At that time, destruction was intended; the mountains and seas overturned together, the Eight Might spewed poison, water and fire sought to be born, the sea wandered and spun, mountains raged and collapsed, the Dragon King rushed through valleys, the flood dragons and horned serpents tumbled the ocean. The Dragon King’s attendants were the Three Officials, various lords with respective Dao, recording the edict of Supreme Mystery. The Sea True was in turmoil throughout the seas, sealing and blocking cavern gates. The Spirit Treasure Heavenly Worthy, the Primordial Most High Perfected, summoned the Eight Might, subdued the Dragon King. The red-charactered jade formula contains texts to ferry life and death, to awaken all sentient beings; its brightness is a precious secret, to avert disaster and calamity, to be used for a thousand days in practice. The year’s established days of Zi and Wu (Midnight and Noon) observe the Way, burning incense and turning scriptures, calling upon the Eight Might, the Dragon King Elder, who hears the scripture with joy, lowering his head and closing his eyes. Those who receive the summoned scripture avoid disaster and calamity. At the eight seasonal nodes ascending the mountains, the four seasons cast into the abyss, great and small kalpas arrive; by talisman cast into the ford, the Dragon King attends and welcomes, the bird mother guides and escorts, ascending to the Jade Capital, bearing the Jade Emperor.

The Primordial Heavenly Worthy said: The thirty-two heavens contain altogether one hundred and eighty seas, and also thirty-two water sacs of mountain seas. The Dragon King Elder roams and surveys seas, mountains, caverns, and abysses, seeing what may be ferried, seeing what may attain immortality, composing the “Eight Might Summoning Dragon Dragon King Repelling Flood and Quelling Flame Mysterious Scripture.” It is constantly used in technique; those who practise it attain extended years and corpse liberation, escape the ten sufferings and eight hardships, rescue the seven ancestors, ascend to the Southern Official’s Vermilion Mound Forest, naturally eating and drinking, their dead bodies returning to spirit.

The Primordial Heavenly Worthy, by the Most High Mysterious Ferrying Perfected, at the eight seasonal days ascends the mountain to summon the Dragon King Elder of the seas, reciting the eight contracts and summons texts and talismans.

Used according to the season: on the day of the Beginning of Spring use a green silk ribbon nine cun long, inscribe in cinnabar the names of states, prefectures, counties, villages, the years, the sealed masters’ names, some A wearing the three divisions and eight appearances; the heavenly immortals and earthly truths constantly reside within the body. Pray that on the Beginning of Spring day, the name may be presented to Supreme Mystery, to erase the death register, sever the root of guilt.

On the Beginning of Spring day, recite the four directions’ chants, using the summons text as before.

'O Dragon Han Venerable, courageous and mighty High Spirit King. All the cavernous spirit treasures summon the Dragon King Lord. The Demon King Elder presides, Primordial Most Holy Spirit.

Command might to restrain the eight poisons, extinguish the flood, halt the flame and smoke. Carefree and void, dispersed, body producing water, fire, and light. The great movement convenes deliverance; kalpas merge into one lifespan.'

On the Spring Equinox day recite, along with summons text and talisman, using the previous method.

'Abyss connects to Dragon Arrival Venerable, water mother sustains flying clouds. All empty spirit mountains sink, vast and boundless not one remains. Red town severs the vat ridge, east well conceals splendid ford.

Mysterious and harmonious jade maidens, spirit consorts six Jia persons. Hollow and not admitting the worthy, spirit emperor returns to the nine mysteries. Diligent and reverent morning work, to ferry and attain the Dao Venerable.'

On the Beginning of Summer day use a crimson silk ribbon eight cun long, inscribe in cinnabar as above.

'Red brightness jade characters arise, great subtlety, intense gloom. Correct light adorns cloud scenery, comeliness not abundant. Transforming among men on the Way, who is the most true house?'

Pray to escape the five hardships, command and summon the heavens’ demons. The Dragon King carries the talisman forth, seas become dust and sand. The spirit mountain does not collapse, blessed land further refines the fetus.

On the Summer Solstice day use crimson silk ribbon eight cun, write as above.

'Void Emperor receives spirit flight, great firmament nine mysteries above. Wind and cloud conceal faintness, recite the Five Mountains artificer. Blessed land in river ravines, spirit mountains have caverns still.

Immortal fungus many wondrous medicines, refine and ingest to generate light and image. Distributed throughout treasure gardens, pearls and jade guard spirit stores. Tridacna, crystal glaze, amber, diamond mirror.'

On the Beginning of Autumn day use white plain silk six cun, write as above.

'Bright and shining is the Great White constellation, towering crags and ridges. Dragon King cleaves the heavenly river, all seas united at once. Thirty-two heavenly truths, each wears the Mighty Dragon Scripture.

Passing beyond Dragon Han, learners ascend Jade Clarity. Observing conduct spewing poison and hunting, rinsing fragrance, watering crowns and tassels. Vast and boundless cliffs, distant and great spirits.'

On the Autumn Equinox day use white plain silk six cun, write as above.

'Kalpa movements intercross heavens, great images no longer born. Ten directions’ Spirit Treasure Venerables, called Perfected Forms. Three Caverns serve the Dao Origin, true subtle Most High scriptures.

Wearers enter emptiness, reciting all Supreme Clarity. Dao is the most true central venerable, ferrying endless lifespan. Most true returns to this nothingness, learners cultivate and fly to Supreme Clarity.'

On the Beginning of Winter day use black silk five cun, write as above.

'Spirit birds disorder Dragon Han, phoenix and horned serpent no longer descend. Blessed head three platforms abode, titles and stations truly mourn forgetting. Spirit mountain to scholar, bearing tally consulting master craftsman.

Holding it to roam and enjoy, dispel demons reciting Bright Mirror. Three origins Primordial Patriarch, composing and summoning Dragon King. Eight Might disperses poisonous breath, seas without surge or tumult.'

On the Winter Solstice day use black silk five cun, write as above.

'Great Brightness shines on the ten directions, all heavens ready to collapse. Spirit deeds great vehicle sect, seas send forth great waves. Ascending to Jade Capital base, descending to abyss cave villages.

Wriggling flying crawling kinds, all follow the road. Hostile demons gird themselves, receive admonition and practise treasure scriptures. Wheel turning changes nature, bodies with no equal form.'

Recite the eight seasonal texts, each according to its season.

The four seasons’ summons text method:

On the days of the four seasons — Spring Jia Yin, Summer Jia Wu, Autumn Jia Shen, Winter Jia Zi — drop into water slips with one golden dragon mouth and two jade beads. The west water faces east, that is the Spirit Sea source. Facing due north, recite the contract thrice, linking the dragon beads, place vermilion characters on blue silk in the water. Again urge the one hundred and eighty spirit seas’ great true Eight Might not to release poison; the Dragon King carries the talisman, then the sound reaches. If no form is seen, the water itself will have strange sounds and waves, that is the spirit. One should observe it for thirty-two years, the Eight Might attend and welcome, the Dragon King guides.

Repeated edict and summons ritual:

The Three Primes of Great Mystery, Great Element, Great Subtlety; the Primordial Most True; the High Light Master; the Mysterious Harmonious Jade Maidens; the Spirit Consort Ladies; some A first enfeoffed some sea god king, to protect abyss and sky floods, water disasters. Now at some appointed time, presenting and commanding the golden dragon and jade beads, to assist the former lord, praying for registration on the emperor’s roster, deleting the root of death.

On the four seasonal days, drop water slips with red characters on blue paper, facing north, reciting the four contracts in Brahma-sound.

The Hymn to the Three Primes of Great Mystery, Great Element, Great Subtlety, first:

The Most High Cavernous Mysterious Text, the Three Primes Spirit Treasure Truth. Primordial breathes forth jade formula, that is the ancient speech. The Eight Might accompany poisonous breath, exterminating devils, common dust.

True Way has hollow cave, exalted and mysterious primal qi venerable. In a moment passing six degrees, soaring body attends Supreme Mystery. One hundred and eighty seas boil, Dragon Han opens flood gates.

Abyss connects to Han heads, human-bird spirit mountain roots. Horned beasts, flood dragons, whales brave, vast guarding cavern texts. Observing and seeing learned immortal guests, pathways releasing flame and smoke.

Urging and hastening the dense thread, recording and binding morning. Yang light no longer bright, Yin essence no longer clear. One hundred and six yang ends, great and small kalpas reborn.

Hymn to the Three Primes, second:

The Eight Might Dragon King Spirits, born in the world without surnames. Breathing out eight poisons from qi, not ferrying no Dao men. Foolish kinds not dispelled, all meet the five suffering courts.

Corpse lying throughout lands, white bones exposed on roads. Spirit mountains full of common filth, all are ministers of vexation. While alive not cultivating scripture, hearing the law but not digesting.

Diligently striving to exterminate foolish kinds, wriggling flying multitudes. Past lives suffer this fate, now pray to be free from guilt.

Hymn to the Primordial Most True, third:

Vast Dragon Han abode, dim spirit mountain gloom. Vast heavens’ mansions, chaos’ primal qi born. Quiet secluded cavern palace, towering spirit true court.

Floating high immortal scholar, pure and upright fundamental record. Dragon scales in abyss source, tiger and leopard hiding in fields. Not seeing learned masters, yet hearing careless sounds.

Hungry gulp primal qi, thirsty drink mysterious jade essence. Holding and nurturing withered bones and substance, to ferry endless lifespan.

Hymn to High Light Master, fourth:

Dark abyss vast palace, chanting pouring boundless cliff. Constellations fall at once, stars transform to escape. Forbidden primal root wild, Ding Emperor no enduring base.

Floating and sinking at will revolving, scorched and withered each has its time. At dawn no nothing succeeds, myriad kalpas come again. Man’s flesh suddenly life ends, highest laws measure disasters.

Turning and migrating on Void Emperor’s road, billion years are but a moment. Body wears Eight Might decrees, to dispel Eight Elements disasters.

The Primordial Heavenly Worthy accompanied by the Dragon King Elder, the Dragon Han many truths, Eight Might drawing, dragon scales, tiger leopards, lions repelling evil, horned dragons and phoenixes, swans and herons, all come together to Nanyang Cavern Terrace’s Seven Treasure Palace, ascend and observe great abyss. Then the serene and vacant Heavenly Worthy elaborated and summoned the Eight Might Dragon Scripture, talisman texts, diagrams, eulogies, to confer upon the unawakened, clearly recording practice secrets and receiving the method, treasures and jade passed on, secret upon secret, lightly disclosed to eliminate the body.

The Eight Might talisman text, used in Spirit Treasure fasts, wearing this talisman chapter, all truths are led forward, demon kings have no interference.

The Eight Might talisman text method: use true sandalwood eight cun long, four cun wide, white ground silk brocade, one chi long, four cun wide, stored in a pouch. Wear at fasting, with three divisions and eight spirits on the left, talisman text on the right.

In the talisman text, vermilion characters are all square and correct.

The Great Dao Lord said: The Most High Primordial Lord and Supreme Emperor Limitless Great Emperor Lord, journeyed upon Kunlun Jade Capital mountain, also with Wonderful Conduct Perfected, Great True Lord, Great True Elder, from Five Mountains and Four Rivers various immortal truths, each two thousand four hundred persons descending together. Thereupon respectfully invited the Heaven Emperor, Earth Emperor, and Human Emperor Lords, together descending to Mysterious Capital Mountain, officials surrounding the terraces and gates, listening to the spreading and expounding of the law. At that time there was Dragon Abyss Elder, called Dragon Lord, again riding and leading tens of thousands of dragons, coming to the Three Sovereigns Great Emperor Lord, hearing good law, and performing meritorious deeds. They sighed saying: the unsurpassed Dao virtue, originally self-existent, supreme void and beyond all, the great vehicle one hundred and six kalpa transport limitless transformation, exhorting goodness to spread and save life and death, diligently guiding. Also there were nine thousand six hundred billion true Dao, accumulating merit and virtue beyond reckoning, also by Dao transformation instructing life law, wielding power and expedient means, universally ferrying and rescuing all evil death roots. Men practise the four benevolences of heart, ferrying and helping harm and calamity, heaven and earth withering, people wailing. The Dragon Lord further transforms, going to the western river desert beyond, Limitless Yu Abyss land with tens of millions of dragons, bearing water riding clouds, widely spreading over the world, universally receiving great flood moistening and sprinkling. The Five Mountains and Four Rivers gods universally raise clouds and nets, shading heaven covering earth, ferrying and saving the world’s dryness and thirst. In days accumulated, water and land universally permeated and moistened, rivers and valleys full, vast and boundless. At that time also the upper heaven sent twenty-four million coloured maidens, leading from the Most High Most High Limitless Great Emperor Lord, covering heaven descending, composing songs and dances, travelling within the four seas, rejoicing in the people receiving celebration’s joy. The country’s mandate peaceful, the world’s people all, none not rejoicing and leaping, each voice harmonising with another. At that time the Great Dao Lord, Dao Virtue Lord, Great Emperor Lord, three venerated perfect spirit men, high sage Wonderful Conduct Perfected, Heavenly Emperor Great Sovereign, countless myriads of myriads of myriads of hosts came to personally attend. Golden boys and jade maidens countless tens of millions, bearing incense and flowers, covering heaven descending, attending the three venerated four truths, Most High Limitless Primordial Lords, Great Emperor Great Venerable Lords, Golden Boys and Jade Maidens, incense and jade maidens, howling and singing with majesty, with the billions of gods on earth and heaven, and with tens of millions of coloured maidens, all advancing before the Great Emperor’s three venerated seats, long kneeling with solemnity.

At that time, the Dragon Lord also brought tens of millions of dragons, to prostrate before the Great Emperor. After a long while, the Dragon Lord reported to the Great Emperor: The three lords acknowledge the Three Sovereigns’ creation and transformation, since opening the world, have not encountered the Yang nine hundred and six cycles. Now after the flood water drought, nine thousand nine hundred years, the withered Yang hides in abyss, water mother flees and hides. Therefore, the withered Yang conceals light beneath the nine springs, flame barriers rise within the eight extremes. The myriad people are dried and exhausted, loudly calling to heaven, lamenting and complaining. The dead from drought and famine, more than half of the world’s three parts, burning and desiring to perish. After three years, all evil and rebellion will end. Also summoned Dragon Lord orders Yu Abyss to command Dragon Lord, directing tens of millions of dragons, to spread heavenly nets, bearing water sprinkling the fields. Within ten days and months, all drought-dead will revive. Within the land, only one-tenth of the people remain as seed, inspected and questioned as to why alone they survive, withered yet not extinct. The seed people said: We who endure drought cruelly yet not perish, are precisely receiving the Three Officials’ inspection, ancestors having accumulated good merit, family honours extended. Also one’s own cultivation of self, rarely erring, accumulating diligent merits, protected by heavenly officials, nurtured by earth spirits. By this the cultivators should rank among partial immortals, being singled out for distinction. When driving away the fire refining beginning, the heaven earth water Three Officials, examine the ancestral accumulated merits, covering oneself, merits and diligence recorded, southern palace leaving name, descendants in times of calamity, thrice appeal. The Southern Mountain Lord Flame Barrier envoy fully sees the salvation grace, and entreats the Heavenly Emperor Fire Pearl envoy, flowing fire flying refining golden true tiger talisman, Great Unity Vajra radiant treasure seal, guiding spirit true phoenix pattern true talisman guarding, sprinkling and brushing, thus obtaining flame flight. Immortal sages and Golden Mouth Great Bird also come to ferry, gaining escape and rebirth warnings in disaster, result of accumulated good deeds, feeling protection of good luck. Can one not diligently cultivate fast and rectitude? The Dragon Lord said: The accumulated merit all comes from the Dao. Whoever wishes to build merit and accumulate virtue should rely on the Most High Spirit True Three Treasures’ fast, accumulating years and months, diligently practising without weariness; the Fate Manager reports good merit to Heaven, the Heavenly Emperor’s office records merits, conquering three disasters and five hardships to obtain release, fasting merit especially weighty, can one not be diligent? The root of living life is established. Now compiled as the Most High Eight Might Summoning Dragon Scripture, to perform invitation and blessing of dragons in the upper scroll, recording root origins explained in the lower scroll.

The Great Dao Lord said: The transport thrives and prospers, arising from drought, thus sings this hymn:

Vast Dragon Lord, receiving heaven’s utmost spirit. Encountering Yang nine, one hundred and six collapses. Ten thousand surnames burnt withered, thirsty dying in abyss court. Looking up to heaven calling out, seeking pity for disaster’s thorn.

Knocking and beseeching sorrowful calling, vexing candle heaven truth. Upper heaven responding, calling and summoning Dragon King. Group dragons flee their bodies, hide light and conceal forms. Sealed in Yu Abyss, cliff stone grindstone.

Eight Might stern edicts, commanding summons together. If there be Dragon Lords, girding five stars. Point knocking at Yu Abyss, group dragons flying and howling. Rectifying and guarding tens of millions, bearing attained merit and name.

Gathering and restraining rain masters, cloud nets ascending to capital. Three days and three nights, sprinkling abyss pure and still. Crops flourishing, ten thousand people receiving life. Four seasons harmonizing, all prosper and peaceful.

The Great Dao Lord said: To praise the Dragon Lord’s great merit, his virtue is majestic indeed. The expounders have practice, clearly have five precept texts, as follows:

Instruction to lead with much benevolent heart, Heaven’s Dao opens the dark. To cherish and relieve worries and troubles, meritorious deeds flow to later generations. Dao does not neglect human merit, worries arise from men’s failure to strive.

Alas how comes the present time carved, the virtuous heart is scattered. Diligently exhort to cultivate goodness, beyond measure pity disasters seize. Dragon Might merits great, blessings bear heaven’s spirit.

Ferrying and saving all under heaven, none do not receive blessing and honour. Yang nine having obtained exemption, one hundred and six also pacified. Withered evil sprinkled with moisture, vexed turbidity becoming clear.

Eight Might command fate talisman, treasure seal and imperial jade. All are poison controlling seals, might diminishing hunting demon soldiers. Dragon King casts aside river bank, group dragons emerge and roar.

Accumulated goodness ten thousand blessings descend, long fast praising voice. None not come from goodness, might arrives at upper spirit. Blessings descend like heavenly thunder, deaf and sick all receive hearing.

Blind also open sight, lame obtain upright walking. Good ones aided by spirits, evil ones punished by ghosts and thieves. Dao bases on goodness, virtue shines with faith.

Benevolence and filial piety heaven’s love, diligence and Dao life does not collapse.

The Dao Lord said: Dragon Lord’s merit is weighty and great, can be called good indeed; it is the ancestral merit heaven’s heart, none not moved. Moreover spirit true most true praise precepts’ beauty. The Dao Lord spoke to Dragon Lord: You inherit ancestral merit, merit already manifest, thus for the benefit of multitudes. And lately your labour and diligence, among the Three Treasures, the expression of merit. You attentively listen to my precepts, consider my words, and should further broadly expound the Great Dao Primordial Lord’s law. The words are most essential, should practise unlimited good law.

The Dragon Lord said: What is the great good practice? I desire to hear and heed, then will again receive precept words, proclaim throughout the ten directions, encourage advancement of good heart, so as not to weary. Thereupon the Most High Great Dao Lord answered Dragon Lord: There is yet another method, those who practise the good Daoist, their appearance complete, obtaining from Dao true masters’ treasured scriptures. The Three Sovereigns’ Cavern Perfected have Great True great precept cinnabar slips and ink tally, and Three Sovereigns Jade Clarity secret writings, Supreme Clarity cinnabar scriptures flying stone invisible, spirit marvelous child cinnabar secret arts, also their truth. The Dao’s marvelous truth, recorded in heaven earth primal registers, their words clear. The essentials of flying immortals, utmost and weighty, can one not be diligent? Good cultivation of mindfulness. The words of the highest Dao, the practice of utmost faith’s root. Great goodness majestic, restraining the lesser vehicle’s laws, should be forbidden and limited. Should have moderation. Where moderation stops, its might is the great vehicle’s practice, observing all and all sentient beings’ Three Treasures’ merits, giving them gradual development. The Dragon Lord has ancestral merit accumulating virtue, separately there are thirty-three precepts, bearing the thirty-two heavens’ rites. The precepts all encourage goodness’ beginning. Again there are sixteen matters to advance wisdom, manifest and spread diligent benevolence. What are the sixteen advancing wisdom? Those practising good deeds in multitudes, complete as truth, precept words without deficiency, forbearance not called forbearance, truly advancing to excellence and concentration, all practices complete, wisdom, feeling, and faith, practice all sufficient, serving as Dao, roaming quiet joy gates, leisurely equipped with six virtuous methods, most possessing ten goods. Adorning body, mouth, and mind with virtue and conduct, knowing sufficiency and joy in quiet body, three self-exhortations to advance, cultivating inner and outer good, encouraging various virtues, also cultivating sixteen practice method matters. Should receive auspicious blessings, manifest great wisdom heart, reward merit in the Great Dao’s world. Bestowing and spreading wisdom, flowing transformation to later generations. Also Dragon Lord has good wisdom heart’s twenty-two matters, also causing removal of improper intentions, preserving great vehicle’s will, high and pure. The Supreme Clarity removes turbidity, suppresses the common, does not speak of mixed matters, does not practise unlawful, discards evil, holds all wisdom, cultivates good laws, his Dao is open, his Dao is great. Dragon Lord’s might already controlled, already entered great vehicle, how much more the Most High? Dragon Lord further practises twenty-two matters, able to advance wisdom leaps, able to trust and follow heart, cannot be overcome by demon officials and evil common and external Dao, descending and repelling them. What is called leaping beyond the common man’s heart? My mind and will are fierce and steady, the things guarded are surely firm, strong practice not falling, heart not wearying. When leaping it is just as heaven earth might spirit might ghost, might common might false, might poisonous might hunting, might not might object, Eight Might talismans, therefore have images. Might is like great Vajra firm practice thus called. Dao says: Dragon Lord Perfected has twenty-two leap methods, able to have might, not causing leap rigidity, achieving universal wisdom heart. All demons and demon external evil external Dao dare not violate Dragon Lord’s leap control. Dao does not act in vain, therefore has rules and rites.

The Dao said: The river and sea raise waves, sun scorches and dries, flood combines four quarters, cloud arises and makes rain. Calm wind halts and pours, commanding dragon true, might vibrating times, group dragons startled flying, clouds halt and fog gathers, opening and clearing the universe, moistening drought and orange, five fragrances spread in court, correct great Dao great brightness. Great good practice, can be called good indeed.

The Great Dao Lord said: The Dragon Lord Perfected also having exerted might, summoned group dragons, at that time first sacrifice and toil for great Dragon King, offering river god wind elder and rain master, also blessing dragon chanting river elder water god Yu Abyss envoy, thrice reciting blessings, fasting three days, by river streams flowing chanting this upper scroll covenant text. When offering sacrifice, oath and seeking dragon life, also attending with reverence and humility the river elder Five Mountains Four Rivers gods. Can be called heaven and earth qi descending, earth qi rising, great flood flow, must join yin and yang virtues, two instruments mutually responding, four seasons following. Five Mountains bowing body, four seas darkly united, river god directing dragon, Yu Abyss cavern overflowing, eight gates opening, the way accomplished, great merit.

Great Primordial Perfected Dragon Lord said: Already received four seasonal sprinkling orders dragon method, have not yet seen five brightness transformations, what are the five brightness? One is the upper cavern desireless brightness, two is that other and self heart will brightness, three is five reach nine harmonies brightness, four is wisdom responding opportunity brightness, five is far-seeing ten directions bright unhindered violation brightness — these are the five brightness caverns. The five brightness illuminations ascend, receiving the Three Sovereigns Five Stars’ essence, next receiving Five Mountains Four Rivers’ spirits, then receiving five fragrance ganoderma flower brightness. The five fragrance brightness, crossing seas and foreign lands, one plant five roots, one stem five branches, one branch five leaves, interval five nodes, five by five corresponding, thus immortals name it. The five fragrance wood, burned ten days, ascending through nine emperors’ heavens, has great benevolent heart, virtue transforming saint.

The Great Dao Lord further said to Dragon Lord: Announce and transform good methods, if there be those fond of pleasure, cultivating fast and seeking Dao, having feeling and faith, may practise the essential Dao, then can generally confer it, to illuminate law and transform spirits, so that later worthies might have clarity and unbroken good meaning. Thereupon Dragon Lord receives command, mounts dragon flying gathering Yu Abyss Dragon Pool, leading and commanding group dragons to descend to various countries, universally causing all under heaven needing water and drought to follow the upper scroll scripture to announce oath and offer sacrifice to water officials river gods and such; then Dragon Abyss Elder shall open pool clouds, rise bearing water sprinkling and pouring.

The Great Dao Lord said: Command Perfected Dragon Lord to use at times when not needed, according to usual to supply, giving heavenly immortals flying immortal officials, each according to their usual heavenly official feather insignia, not petitioning at times to seek rain water matters, desiring to fast and turn Dragon King scriptures upper and lower scrolls. Making their voice and breath sorrowful and urgent, facing river waters flowing chanting each seven times. Then ritual masters praise Brahma chants good, all causing river gods to move, group dragons sorrowful and urgent, veiling red bodies descending to appear in east and west directions. Within three days response arrives, then daylight raises brightness and night is clear, to communicate clear response.

The Great Dao Lord further commanded Dragon Lord Perfected: If when fasting there is great drought, dust raised everywhere, accumulating months and days, excessive yang not moistening, again should command and summon Dragon Lord to petition rain and bestow. According to upper scroll covenant scripture chant lower scroll seven times, mournful and beautiful, heavenly truth Dragon Lord suddenly mounts dragon descending. According to upper scroll, should chant upper scroll lower scroll, one day and one night each, each seven times. Offering sacrifice and oath to river god Dragon Lord seeking to dispatch group dragons into four seas rivers, flying descending and ascending bearing water, roaming and performing widespread in heaven midst, great flood pouring for three days, rain sprinkling three nights. First arrange incense lamps weaving night and day, then rain bestowal blowing and calling immediately arrives, true added without measure branches, accumulated branches magnificent. Holy king virtue conduct, great goodness ascending, transforming and changing beyond usual ends, commanding summons difficult. Matter completed quickly dispatched, this Dragon Lord spirit transformation clear and quiet sprinkling response, if not supreme sovereign of the land, how could this be effected? Vast and level, not arrogant without pride.

The Dao True Most High words, also have four sorts of great good deed merit; what are the four deeds? The Dao said: As one cultivates purity and quiet, that is the first deed. One applies heart to Dao will, that is the second deed. One benevolently transforms and succeeds, that is the third deed. One establishes merit and expediently ferries and saves multitude lives, that is the fourth deed. Those who cultivate the four merit grades, what are they? The Dragon Lord Perfected said: There are eight direct deeds, like carrying out Eight Might command summoning orders, all from upright Dao heart equivalence. As for unlawful matters, therefore not allowing already good persons to see unlawful cases. When entering should clearly announce it, announcing goodness not universal, each by Brahma lord not informing disciples and masters fault. The masters’ responsibility.

Perfected Dragon Lord said: Also heard that Dao has three realms. What are the three realms? Diligently cultivating virtue, in void and non-being should act, in formless realms, already entirely pure, obtaining pure self nature and life, also able to transcend the Dharma realm. The Dharma realm is pure, thus number realms pure, number realms pure, thus innumerable realms pure, innumerable realms struggling, thus obtaining three realms pure. Three realms pure, thus eye consciousness realm pure, eye consciousness realm pure, thus mind consciousness realm pure, mind consciousness realm pure, thus obtaining empty realm pure, empty realm pure, thus all Dharma realms pure. Because of this purity, all Dharmas equally pure, like emptiness emptiness equally pure, thus obtain sentient beings pure through all purity, thus obtain sentient beings preserve through all purity, thus there is not a second, also not clinging to two no two purity, thus Dao is pure, by this called pure highest Dao.

Perfected Dragon Lord further said: Dao speaking is also non-existent, all thoughts also do not think Dao, all thoughts entirely pure, as if ascending to supreme silence there, forever no so-called no gate. Thought should have no thought, no thought Dao, also no consciousness thought, its Dao entirely non-existent, entering the dark. Practising this no thought, no thought Dao most true indeed. If Dragon Lord Perfected wishes to practise this Dao pure intention, should clearly know pure conduct, also cause body mouth mind pure conduct to produce breath. From non-being the mysterious receives existence, called life Dao, root of Dao.

Perfected Dragon Lord said: What is called body conduct utmost? Dao said: Body conduct coming and going life law, coming is inexhaustible law, present is scene law, end is inexhaustible law. The inexhaustible is called body conduct. Also body law arises from condition meeting, when condition old then void no thought, cool and no thought, thus faint, Dragon Lord now wishes to model law, observe body as such Dao, cannot but diligently strive to obtain true Dao.

The Great Dao Lord said: Dragon Lord Perfected, if riding this pure heart, born in the desire realm, and in the form realm with various heavens together among multitudes of Brahmas, quiet and advancing without agitation, this is Dragon Lord Perfected able to with heavens spirits and men transform and guide by expedient means. Or born in form realm but desire realm appears and has form. Again with heavens thoughts sentient beings wandering, sitting and rising unaware, having labour and laziness, multitudes of sentient virtuous also do not self-despise. They by this conduct pure and fixed, correct heart receiving it, in the upper Dao none not flying in mysterious void.

The Great Dao Lord said: The Perfected already entirely conforms to nature’s conduct, has a pure and clear body; the practitioner then is truly great. Having fixed the body, further does not follow stopping to fix what arises, thus having advancing and retreating heart, not receiving true called. The example is like the unsurpassed Perfected teaching transformation beginning, also has good expedient means. If a Daoist is resolute to understand purity, flying and transforming without form, can be called diligent cultivation, Dao does not neglect man.

The Great Dao Lord said: Also heard Dragon Lord Perfected’s teaching beginning, with not practising to seek Dao practice. Not practising no practice to imagine Dao practice, thus can know Dao’s conduct. Also not practising to hope for Dao practice, also fundamentally not seeking practice to understand. Some by bone method already grasp this origin, not practising what arises, hoping toward Dao to practise not practising conduct, extinguishing and ferrying also no understanding of death and life Dao. Practising or not practising, holding thought always in Dao, is it not clear? Dao will be clear.

The Highest Dao said: Turning void true three caverns Dharma wheel, limitless dragon scriptures, also draft dragon joyful leaping. Dragon Lord further said:

True Dao not distant, three five again return. Clear sky awaiting rain, seeking rain summoning dragon. Dragon Lord once descends, howling and singing loud. Sprinkling moistening drought seedlings, what is asked not trivial. Yu Abyss river official, Five Mountains high peaks. Expounding law teaching, only goodness is loyalty. Filial piety rising, world without peer. Moderation law made, some awaken by dragon. Dragon Lord once descends, none not rectified. Command talisman summon truth, also obtain demon king. Ten thousand ghosts extinguish light, spirit herbs bowing body. Severing five ways, ascending high peaks. Also produce fasting texts, teaching children and ignorant. Flowing water golden talisman, radiant treasure seal. Left gird six Jia, right wear seals. Only recollect three realities, hold in breast. Aspiring Dao diligent fasting, what question flying void. Flying void Dao long, long teaching calm.

Dao if not practising obtained, how suddenly with practice imagine. Seeking Dao returning void no, at times must establish shape image. Worries man will not firm, therefore arise following light. Not delight seeking Dao practice, dispelling all filth and ruin. True Dao entirely no practice, pure returns to demons. If there is arising practice, spirit sincerity wonder often. Dao says no self thought, self thought utterly without shadow. Ceasing thought comes from void, void comes with real life. Child can cultivate good transformation, good transformation causes true spirit. Who knows true Dao precious, golden elixir in child’s form. Nurturing mysterious brightness below, lifespan extended and long. What for pursuing short life, not willing to abandon primal essence. Primal essence very easy to know, safely stored in mysterious city. Interval opening sun and moon below, sounding bell gathering officers and soldiers. Who can understand thus, in imagining Three Primes court. Not understanding seeking my Dao, instead disaster punishes. Body perishes knife mountain peak, disgrace ruins Dao name. Why not cultivate fasting rectitude, ten thousand years exempt from drifting. Only worry merit not accumulated, not worry accumulate not complete. Great Dao not false speech, fear you incur guilt. Therefore open Three Caverns treasure, exhort you to nurture longevity and peace. Surpassing five hardships suffering, immortal flying imperial court. I and you mutually know, who knows true can hear.

Dragon Lord Perfected said: I receive Most High Great Emperor’s Dao, personally bear unsurpassed true law, diligently cultivate fast rectitude, diminish self and spread charity. You desire to ferry body, must first ferry others. You desire to perfect body, must first perfect others. You desire to honour self, must first honour others. You desire to respect self, must first respect others. You desire to stand self, must first stand others. You desire to humble self, must first humble others. You desire to teach self, must first teach others. You desire to manage self, must first manage others. You desire to save self, must first save others. You desire to reach self, must first reach others. You desire to communicate self, must first communicate others. You desire to enjoy self, must first enjoy others. You desire to be full self, must first fill others. You desire to be generous self, must first be generous others. You desire to be first self, must first be first others. You desire to govern self, must first govern others. You desire to settle self, must first settle others. You desire to be kind self, must first be kind others. You desire to be filial self, must first be filial others. Humble and diligent body and harmonious countenance, morning and evening respectfully serving my veneration, seeing others venerating elders, respectfully as I venerate elders, heart present mouth reciting Dao, ever wishing humbly to serve diligently, change taste to sweet and advance, not departing from morning and evening, cold ice not clothing first, should clothe elders first, practising these eighteen goods, should thoroughly reach the upper heaven. Having wealth not hoarding, opening granary benefitting the poor, yearly several thousand hu, all used to save the distressed and poor. Dragon Lord in youth practised this, moved and enlightened by upper heaven, upper heaven desires loyalty and filial piety, life extended granted, extended tenfold counted, life past dragons come to meet. Accumulating goodness and filial piety effects, benevolent heart greatly benefits poor, Dragon Pride truly difficult to bear, bowing to him as Dragon Lord. Rising and falling at will, roaming and chanting wherever going. Also transforming appearing in forms, changing light everywhere connected. Also teaching all, warning awakening later school children, practising much benevolence and thought. Seeing worthy none not respectful, highest sage supplements Perfected, just beginning to transform the world. Merit accomplished roaming four seas, Five Mountains all about. Attaining immortal Dao leaving names, practice accumulating in later generations, transforming and awakening later worthies. World’s end many disasters rampant, diligently fasting to ferry body. If able to nurture three lives, Dao refining in Three Primes. Sitting upright thinking my Dao, roaming banqueting on Kunlun. Not yet able to ascend mysterious void, yet delights roaming earth immortals. Not envious of human world pleasures, roaming Five Mountains’ peaks. Then refining golden liquid, flying ascending creating Imperial Heaven. Why not diligently cultivate fast, sinking into vulgar world. Hundred ghosts assault and attack, fearing damage to heaven’s life years. Thought after thought good continuous, bestowing kindness saving poor. Heaven’s Dao not false precept, urging you to make good causes. To do good trouble not long, accumulating virtue blessing life extended.
