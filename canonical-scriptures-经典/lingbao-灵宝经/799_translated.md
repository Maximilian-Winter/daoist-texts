The Primordial Celestial Worthy, in the first year of the Kaihuang era, on the first day of the seventh month at noon, upon the mountain Fuluo of Yucha in the Western Nayu Kingdom, in the grove of long mulberry trees, conferred to the Supreme Dao Lord the Wisdom Highest Grade Great Precept Dharma Text. At that time, the Dao Lord, having received the precepts, arose, faced north, laid his head to the ground, turned his heart to the ten directions, then facing east prostrated himself. The Celestial Worthy said to the Supreme Dao Lord: Now I shall proclaim the Dharma sound, to open the enlightenment of all beings, to resolve calamities and remove sufferings for men and women, to request blessings and save lives, to extract all roots of suffering. Thus the living shall see the Way, the body shall escape the eight hardships, the dead shall rejoice, and drink of the Heavenly food, be born early among men, become the Wheel Turning Holy King. Those who cultivate the fast and seek the Way shall all with one heart request and observe the ten precepts, hear them carefully and not forget, meditate intently and silently, thoroughly contemplate the natural, not allow mixed thoughts to disturb body and spirit. Those able to do thus shall then listen tranquilly.

The Celestial Worthy spoke:

The first precept is: The heart shall not harbour evil jealousy; let no shadow of darkness arise. Guard the mouth, be cautious with faults; keep remembrance fixed on the Dharma.

The second precept is: Observe benevolence and do not kill; pity and aid all living beings; extend mercy and broadly save, moistening and reaching all.

The third precept is: Observe chastity, yield and defer; do not commit lust or theft; always practice good thoughts; harm yourself to aid others.

The fourth precept is: Do not indulge in lust or desire; keep heart restrained from licentiousness; preserve chastity and caution; act without stain.

The fifth precept is: The mouth shall utter no evil words; speech shall not be ornate or flowery; inward and outward be just and straight; commit no fault with the tongue.

The sixth precept is: Reduce wine and practice moderation; harmonize qi and nature; do not harm the spirit; avoid all evil.

The seventh precept is: Do not envy others’ superiority; avoid contention for merit and fame; in all things be humble and yielding; withdraw yourself and measure others.

The eighth precept is: Do not criticize the scriptures and teachings; do not slander the holy texts; with a sincere heart receive the Dharma; always as if before the gods.

The ninth precept is: Do not quarrel with tongue and speech; do not criticize the four classes; heaven and men resent such; injury befalls spirit and noxiousness.

The tenth precept is: In all acts and deeds be equal-hearted; harmony among men and reverence from spirits; conduct all as usual.

The Celestial Worthy said: Those who cultivate and observe these precepts always accord with the heavenly heart. Constantly practice great mercy; wish to save all in this calamitous world; be humble and respect the teaching; do not be negligent. Better to keep good and die than to do evil and live. Thus without retreat one may obtain salvation from the five paths, avoid the three evils, be protected by the heavens and revered by myriad spirits. Long fast and observe precepts, and naturally attain deliverance in the world. The Supreme Dao Lord, full of joy and fear, bowed and accepted the command.

The Celestial Worthy said: Those who study and practice the Way, cultivate the fast and act in the Way, open salvation for heaven and men, and do all good works, should observe the twelve approvable principles, thus obtaining salvation in the world. You should follow them, thus obtaining true reality and finally entering non-action with all wishes fulfilled.

The first is: See the true scriptures and the Dharma that opens salvation for all; thus awaken the intention of the Way, and wish that later generations may ascend to the Great Sage.

The second is: Always practice the heart of compassion; wish that all may universally see and hear; open salvation broadly with no obstacle or obscurity.

The third is: Delight in the scriptures and teachings; read deeply and widely; have a firm and clear will; open and enlighten the ignorant.

The fourth is: Respect and receive the teacher’s instruction; widely open encouragement and transformation; let them enter the Dharma wall and avoid the path of blindness.

The fifth is: Have faith in the profound mysteries; honour the scriptures and formulas; recite them morning and evening without weariness.

The sixth is: Not pursue glory and splendour; sever worldly ties; concentrate the heart and fix the will; all efforts rest in the Dharma.

The seventh is: Diligently recite the great scriptures; wish for all; widely open bridges; make causes for future lives.

The eighth is: Always give rise to a good heart; be not perverse nor false; have no envy nor harm; no evil nor jealousy.

The ninth is: In the place of incarnation, always meet the holy age; meet the Spirit Treasure Dharma teaching; encounter without ceasing.

The tenth is: Keep the body pure and hold precepts; cultivate the fast and establish merit; broadly save all beings; all shall obtain deliverance.

The eleventh is: Study broadly and widely; proclaim the Cavern Dharma; forewarn heaven and men; universally enable enlightenment and salvation.

The twelfth is: Always be with bright teachers; encounter them life after life; receive instruction and proclaim transformation; save countless people; all good hearts shall obtain the true Way.

The Celestial Worthy said: The method of cultivation for the scholar is to observe the twelve approvable precepts. If with one heart one carries out these good thoughts, in life after life one will see the holy texts, and bind fate with the Way. The friends of the heavens alone transcend the three realms without obstruction; long leaving the three evils, five paths, and eight hardships. Myriad spirits pay reverence and protection; earth deities guard the gates; the doors are pure and solemn; myriad calamities do not afflict. This is called sitting upright and obtaining the Way. Diligently practice and recite; widely proclaim among the learners so all may with one heart enter the Dharma gate.

The Celestial Worthy said: The Way is honoured and the Dharma is subtle; the human body also is precious. Therefore the Way opens the Dharma and leaves precepts in writings to save the human form. When the human form is thus saved, it rises to be equal with the Way. It is fitting to be refined in action, hold fast to the fast and observe precepts; have a plain heart and silent meditation; have clear and distinct resolution; single-mindedly return and fix attention without duality; cleanse the six organs; be moderate and do not taste excess; inside and outside be clear and void; all accord with the natural. On these fasting days, holding incense and making vows, responding with heart’s utmost, the Four Heavenly Guardians and the Ten Hosts of Mighty Spirits immediately descend to act; they observe and listen to the supreme sound and reflect your heart. If precepts and the Way are practiced, all merits are recorded by the heavens; fortune and misfortune are manifested. The Way does not fail men; diligently practice and hear truly; let not demonic words deceive.

The Celestial Worthy said: If good men and good women can awaken the natural intention of the Way, enter the Dharma gate, receive my ten precepts, and practise the twelve approvable principles, they shall be disciples of the Great Way pure faith, equal in merit with the Flying Immortals. The Flying Immortals are those who have not obtained the Way; these disciples of the Great Way ten transformations are Flying Immortals in the void, driving the chariots of the heavens. Pure faith disciples, seen in the world, may be free from vexations, deliver from all sufferings, have bodies entering light, forms internally clear and straight, summon ghosts and command spirits, subdue demons and spirits; at ten transformations they become Flying Immortals. If at the first transformation they advance with diligence, never relaxing or retreating, performing all merits and virtues, long fasting and hardship, morning and evening without weariness, they shall become Flying Immortals and thereby advance, transcending the three realms, becoming Supreme True Men of Shangqing.

The Celestial Worthy said: Those who receive my ten precepts and practise the twelve approvable shall all bow and declare: Pure faith disciples, from now receive the precepts, with one heart observe and practise, dare not disbelieve, return homage to the ten directions. Those able to do thus see the world’s gates flourishing; all obtain health and strength; earth deities attend and guard; three realms welcome; seven ancestors’ soul spirits ascend to the Southern Palace; clothed and fed in heavenly kitchens; early obtain rebirth; return to the gate of earthly kings; life after life unbroken, bound with the Way. The Celestial Worthy said: To establish the fast and practise the Way, the four heavenly emperors drive the flying clouds and green ploughs; eight scenic jade banners; attended by True Men and Jade Maidens, hand-held blossoms scattering; leading with phoenix songs; following with heavenly bells; white cranes and lions; howling and singing; burning incense and scattering blossoms; floating in the air and arriving; reverently worshipping and practising the Way; observing and hearing the Dharma sound. The Heavenly Kings descend and myriad spirits bow; can this not fully realize the Dharma? One must first receive the ten precepts, then practise the Way; orderly and elegant steps; quiet heart and closed intention; sitting, rising, lying, breathing; never departing from the rules. The Heavenly Kings rejoice and record names in Shangqing; it may be said that obtaining the Way lies within the mind.

The Wisdom Closing the Six Passions Highest Grade Precept

The first precept is: Eyes shall not widely gaze about, nor be disturbed by various colours; lose no pupil and fail not the iris; the light shall be clear and thorough.

The second precept is: Ears shall not hear disorder; confuse not the five tones; harm not the spirit; reject evil sounds and crying.

The third precept is: Nose shall not widely smell; mingle not foul and fishy scents; easily produce turbidity; form not be clear and straight.

The fifth precept is: Hands shall do no evil; steal not others’ things; greed for profit enters oneself; calamity comes unawares.

The sixth precept is: Heart shall have no love or desire; shake not the five spirits; harm not the essence nor lose black (energy); body and hair become bewildered and wild.

The Celestial Worthy said: These six precepts are the great afflictions of the body. Those born as men and women, though receiving human forms, yet if the six passions are impure, not seeing the scriptures and teachings, not hearing the Dharma sound, bodies unawakened, sink in the gates of sin, their lives shortened, do not complete heavenly years, dwell long in evil paths — this is greatly pitiable. Therefore these precepts are spoken to open salvation for heaven and men, good hearts with faith, single-mindedly returning homage, respectfully observing the holy teaching, closing the gates of evils; then the form enters the void, the six penetrations of wisdom. The six penetrations of wisdom are: thorough seeing, thorough hearing, thorough void, thorough emptiness, thorough clarity, thorough subtlety — these are the six penetrations, penetrating all without exception. The six passions become calm and peaceful; the spirit returns naturally; essence self-arises and is firm; life span long and extended; finally not dying.

Enjoyment never ceases; life after life cause and effect; one transformation receives reward; equal merit with Flying Immortals; transcend the nine transformations of the wheel; gradually enter the Great Way; disciples of ten transformations recorded in the heavens; seven ancestors ascend together; born above in heaven; clothed and fed with blessings; born among men; Wheel Turning Divine King; constantly dwelling in the gate of blessings.

The Celestial Worthy said: These ten good encouragement precepts, unless one is a disciple of the Great Way ten transformations, none can practise. Those able to practise are equal in merit with Flying Immortals; hearts with six penetrations of wisdom alike; thoroughly empty. After death all may fly in clouds; multitude of saints drive their chariots; wander the ten directions. From this without slacking obtain place and become immortal kings; seven ancestors depart the dark night; ascend to Southern Palace; clothed and fed in heavenly kitchens; receive blessings naturally. Their Dharma is lofty and subtle; save countless people; majestic great transformation; difficult to surpass.

The Celestial Worthy said: The six penetrations of wisdom are: Heaven is thorough seeing; Earth is thorough hearing; East is thorough void; West is thorough emptiness; South is thorough clarity; North is thorough subtlety. The six penetrations are thorough and far-reaching, boundless and without end; cannot be grasped or exhausted; all-embracing and all-containing. Those having the qi of six senses always communicate six wisdoms; man who realizes the six penetrations then has six senses clear. Control the six passions, cause man naturally to abandon all roots of evil, generate all good thoughts; the heart embodies six wisdoms, and naturally attains immortality.

The Celestial Worthy said: The root of the Way, to deliver those amid ten sufferings and eight hardships, one must receive great precepts, cultivate fast and establish virtue, found good merits; be praised by the three realms, observed by the heavens; the body is all delivered, the Way all accomplished. Without receiving great precepts, merely fasting long, or cutting off grains and resting supplies, hiding and retreating in mountain forests, seeking to save the fleshly body without six penetrations of wisdom practice, only losing merit, without cause to accomplish. Good men and women, with utmost sincerity, diligently seek to hear and receive. Now this scripture is spoken, widely opening salvation; all let the ten directions universally hear the Dharma sound.

The Celestial Worthy said: Heaven is thorough seeing; thus heavenly eye wisdom is high and wisdom thorough and infinite. From above and below, all four directions; nothing not illuminated, nothing not clear; though called one wisdom, yet all five colours are included. Heaven’s thorough seeing is natural, thus without harm; men follow heaven; the eye has a vermilion pupil also with five colours of light. If man does not hold precepts, six senses darken; do not communicate with human apertures; wisdom is not opened; wide gazing at five colours causes the pupil to flutter; light dims and clouds; causing blindness. Therefore this precept is spoken to deliver heaven and men; all men and women to hear the Dharma sound. If one desires to surpass and obtain long life, one must observe this precept, diligently practise and not forget. Beware many coloured thoughts; licentious eye spirit; always self-control; cherish the pupil; think true and quiet; enable sudden wisdom; thoroughly observe the void; hold precepts and control oneself; then five colours return to the body. When five colours return naturally, no harm occurs; preserve your life span; obtain infinity.

The Celestial Worthy said: Earth is thorough hearing; wisdom far and hearing deep; thus respond to heaven above and penetrate below all four directions; nothing not exhausted, nothing not heard. Though called one wisdom, all five sounds are included. Earth’s thorough hearing is natural; producing the five sounds; unmoved and thus without harm. Man is like earth; in the ear are the five sounds’ spirits. If man does not hold precepts, wisdom will not proceed; do not confuse the five sounds. The five sounds cause five spirits to flutter; ears become empty and wasted; roaring and sorrowful crying. Five spirits lament and weep; causing deafness. Therefore this precept is spoken to deliver heaven and men; all men and women may universally hear the Dharma sound. If one desires long life, one must hold great precepts; control ear spirit; do not hear many unlawful sounds; quietly listen to wonderful scriptures and true Dharma verses; enable wisdom; thoroughly sound in vast emptiness; hold precepts and control oneself; then five sounds return to the body. When five sounds return naturally, ears hear no evil sounds; preserve life span; obtain longevity.

The Celestial Worthy said: East is thorough void; beginning of yang arising from emptiness; wisdom bright and clear; thus called thorough void. The void is unobstructed; thorough and hard to exhaust; the qi of beginning blue; though called one wisdom, all five mixtures are included. Void receives all; therefore no harm. Man though having form, the form also follows void. The nose has yellow tranquillity, dispelling evil spirits. Man not holding precepts, wisdom does not communicate; not entering wisdom; must not eat foul and fishy foods. The foul and fishy blackness causes obstruction and blockage of the nose spirit; the acupuncture channels easily broken; clear passage not open. Therefore this precept is spoken to deliver heaven and men; all men and women may hear the Dharma sound. To deliver from the ten sufferings and eight hardships, one must observe this precept; control the nose spirit; do not receive much foulness; cleanse the clear channels; guide and lead life channels; clear wisdom; thoroughly qi entering void; hold precepts and control oneself; then all qi returns to the body; all channels mingle; long preserve body and life; finally not destroyed or harmed.

The Celestial Worthy said: West is thorough emptiness; lesser yin blackness; no surpassing emptiness; wisdom subtle and bright; thus called thorough emptiness. Emptiness is unobstructed; thorough and hard to exhaust; lesser yin black; though called one wisdom, all five tastes are included. Emptiness enters all; emptiness contains all. Man though following emptiness, if body does not hold precepts, wisdom does not communicate. Wisdom not entered, then five tastes cause harm; greedily eating grease and smoke, then five spirits are disturbed; causing disorder and short life span. Therefore this precept is spoken to deliver heaven and men; all men and women universally hear the Dharma sound. To obtain long life, surpass all calamities, one must observe this precept; control the five spirits; carefully avoid greed for five tastes; sweet and greasy smoke; cleanse the five viscera; always keep cool; body with wisdom; then five tastes harmonize and fragrant; inside and outside peaceful and balanced; life span unharmed.

The Celestial Worthy said: South is thorough clarity; greater yang blackness; qi issuing from clarity; wisdom clear and bright; opening gates and thoroughly clear. Therefore the South has the Red Emperor’s thorough yang court; refining all things; receiving refinement and becoming bright. Man not holding precepts, wisdom does not communicate. Wisdom not communicating, then heart and spirit move; arise love and desire; cause man to be bewildered and wild; lose spirit and harm life; life span cannot be long. Therefore this precept is spoken to deliver heaven and men; all men and women universally hear the Dharma sound. To obtain long life and surpass calamities, one must observe this precept; control heart and spirit; remove feelings and cast away desires; abandon dust and enter clarity; bright wisdom; six senses opening channels; body entering thorough clarity; with qi natural; preserve your life span; obtain eternal long existence.

The Celestial Worthy said: North is called thorough subtlety; born of mystery; wisdom far and deep; subtle and thoroughly true; secretly inspecting sin and blessing; master of life’s origin; hand moves the four seasons; above responding to heavenly passes; heavenly passes ever turning; hand likewise moves. The hand has great spirit; meeting birth’s fullness; moving the four elements; observing man’s decay and completion. Man not holding precepts, wisdom not communicating; then shaking and moving man’s heart; all evils arise; hand acts unawares; greed and theft self-propelled; causing short life span; not completing heavenly years. Therefore this precept is spoken to deliver heaven and men; desiring long life and surpassing evil roots, one must observe this precept; control hand spirit; bright wisdom; heart self-illuminated; hand not greedy nor stealing; evil roots not born; respond to heaven and follow blackness; body entering nature; preserve your life span; eternally obtain long existence.

The Wisdom Merits and Recompenses Highest Grade Precepts say: Distribute offerings and support the Three Treasures and holy scriptures. One coin or more is seventy-four thousand fold recompense; ten thousand or more, recompense is incalculable. Names recorded in the heavens; body ascends as Supreme Ten Transformations disciple; seven ancestors ascend; become companions of the heavens.

The precept says: Distribute offerings to Dharma teachers’ robes, copy scriptures, establish quiet places. One coin or more is thirty-two thousand fold recompense; ten thousand or more, recompense is incalculable. Generation after generation wise and bright; constantly meet bright teachers; born in noble households; seven ancestors all companions of the Supreme.

The precept says: Distribute offerings to Dharma teachers and Daoists for incense, oil and fasting meals. One coin or more is twenty-four thousand fold recompense; merit large, recompense heavy. Generation after generation abundant; never in want; seven ancestors joyful and peaceful; constantly eating heavenly kitchens.

The precept says: Distribute offerings to mountain reclusive Daoists. One coin or more is twelve thousand fold recompense; merit large, recompense heavy. Generation after generation constantly meet holy teachers; see the Way and Dharma teachings; seven ancestors all gain friendship of the five emperors.

The precept says: Distribute offerings to pure faith disciples for incense, candles and fasting meals. One coin or more is thirty-two thousand fold recompense. Generation after generation joy; no suffering seen; seven ancestors ascend heaven; free and at ease; constantly dwelling in blessings.

The precept says: Distribute offerings of wealth and treasures to build temples and halls. One coin or more is twenty-four thousand fold recompense; merit large, recompense large. Generation after generation wise and bright; enjoyment never ceases; seven ancestors all enter the land without affliction.

The precept says: Distribute offerings to heaven and men poor and needy. One coin or more is twelve thousand fold recompense; merit large, recompense large. Generation after generation rich and noble; joy without end; seven ancestors all receive four-sided heavenly kitchens; clothed and fed naturally.

The precept says: Distribute offerings to all living beings; harm self to supply food. One coin or more is six thousand two hundred fold recompense. Generation after generation descendants flourishing; households prosperous; seven ancestors avoid hell; ascend natural blessings.

The Celestial Worthy said to the Supreme Dao Lord: The highest grade precepts of wisdom and merit are such that men and women of heaven and earth, who awaken the natural intent of the Way, sacrifice self and distribute, open and expand the field of blessings; merit is very great. The merit of one act is repaid ten thousand fold. The principle of recompense is clear as sun and moon; either seen in this life or in the next; but blessings differ and do not necessarily come together. Among them some calculate merit to offset faults; some use virtue to atone for sin; some for ancestors remove penalties. Thus recompense is not immediately manifest. The Three Officials and Nine Courts record man’s merit and fault, missing not a fraction. Sometimes sins are removed in advance, body does not commit faults, yet later merits are not clear, no different from the ordinary. This depends on one’s body receiving the day and month, and responding to heaven’s liberation; then the blessings. Though thus shifting, seven ancestors’ soul spirits have ascended heaven; blessings gathered later; no error. Clearly tell men and women to know recompense; heavenly Way is true; good heart and faith; diligently practise without slack; one can obtain deliverance and receive endless blessings.

The Celestial Worthy said to the Supreme Dao Lord: The heavens’ highest saints, utmost true great spirits, heavenly emperors, and the past dust and sand of men who have attained the Way, all have obtained through distributing and spreading virtue, doing good works; when merit is fulfilled and virtue sufficient, good recompense comes; rotation never ceases. All obtain true Way; transcend the three realms; freely roam the great Luo heaven of Shangqing; in the jade capital, mysterious terrace, seven jewel forest. At this time all know that distributing merit is not lost; joy is natural; life after life boundless. The offerings are but small; blessings boundless. In the latter age false and thin, human nature is stingy and greedy; only know to accumulate; heavy burdens for oneself; none can awaken heart to perform these merits. When merit is not accumulated, sins daily grow; long distant blessing hall; sinking into gates of sin; revolving in the five paths and eight hardships. Lost blessings in the world have no return; men and women mutually bind; do not recognize the origin of past fate; seeing their soul spirits, greatly pitiable and painful. Now for the heavens these precepts are spoken; all men and women may universally hear the Dharma sound; open salvation of all beings; cause entry to blessings.

The Celestial Worthy said: I have gone through the heavens, earth, and hell; among men and women the guilty are made prisoners in dark prisons; none but those who first did not see the clear precepts; saw and did not act; or acted but did not follow; turn back in regret; return to gates of sin; or born and commit evil; do not meet good causes; or do not know to distribute and scatter; arise heart to build merit; widely make blessing fields; only know to commit sin; wander in the three lower paths and eight hardships. Reflecting on their ignorance, greatly pitiable and painful. Therefore these precepts are spoken to open salvation for heaven and men; all men and women may universally hear the Dharma sound; know to arise the Way heart; establish good merit; to extract all suffering; bind with the Way; all obtain joy and peace; freely at ease naturally.

The Supreme Dao Lord received the precepts from the Primordial Celestial Worthy; opened salvation for all heavens; all directions and borderlands; merit accomplished; transmitted to the heavenly kings; ten directions great sages; Supreme Emperor Taiwei; Four Extremes True Men; Eastern Flower Palace’s various great spirits; Jade Maiden group immortals; universally cause proclamation and communication; aid salvation in coming lives; cause hearing of Dharma sound. Then all heavens without exception rejoiced; good, good indeed.
