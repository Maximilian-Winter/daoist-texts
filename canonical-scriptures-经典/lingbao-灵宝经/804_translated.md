The Supreme Cavern Mysterious Spiritual Treasure Scripture of Wisdom, Fixed Intention, and Subtle Communication

At that time, the Spiritual Treasure Heavenly Venerable was quietly abiding in the Purple Tenuity Palace of the Seven Treasures of Primordial Yang in the Mysterious Capital. His spirit was tranquil and profound, silent and inactive. Within the Purple Tenuity Palace, light shone both within and without, illuminating boundlessly; the hundred harmonies of precious incense were fragrant without burning, the incense and light entwined and gathered, surging and overflowing the void, drifting and flowing, diffusing without end. The adorned radiance was remote and luxuriant, soft, moist, clear, and cool — cool, strange, and refined, beyond the power of words or inscription. The celestial music of Heaven’s balance was great, myriad kinds interweaving.

Suddenly, the Heavenly Venerable at first did not look around, but thought upon the beginning of the myriad transformations, how the primal essence was the same, each arising from the vapourous Qi, condensed into spirit. The spirit’s origin was pure and clear, serene without mixture; yet once it received and took form, the form was defiled by the six emotions. Once the six emotions were tainted, the movements became corrupt and filthy, bewildered by what was seen, darkened in attachment. Worldly affairs and conditions arose in sequence. Attracted and drawn were the sins and filth, accumulated through the ages, cycling within the three realms, drifting and forgetting to return; revolving through the five paths, sinking for long without awakening. The infant embraces pain and poison, unable to know itself; the roaming spirit is anxious and fearful, treading only upon sin. Compassion arose in the heart without ceasing. Reflecting upon the origin of receiving and taking, the principle is pitiable. Then the Heavenly Venerable sent for his attendants, summoning the Left Mysterious Perfected and the Right Mysterious Perfected. In a moment, the two Perfected stood promptly and respectfully arrived, prostrated and paid reverence, then took their seats. After a long pause at their places, they spoke plainly and fully.

Thereupon the Heavenly Venerable said: The meaning of mutual constraint I now wish to reach to you. I have previously contemplated the origin of the myriad beginnings thus. Such principles are yet able to be rescued. You two worthy ones have already set forth great compassion and great mercy; ought you not also to share this intent? The two Perfected answered: The myriad multitudes are in misery, always in their own localities, and each has already acted; the teaching and transformation are intricate; sins and blessings are fully explained; the principles reach their utmost. Yet there remain the obstinate and foolish, who forever do not believe themselves; even if there be a slight faith, presently they relapse, and before a full month has passed, they become lax again. This is also what Your Highness most sagely perceives and chooses; what then shall be done?

The Heavenly Venerable said: Although they be lax, if there be but one faith at the time, the blessing is not slight. You two sages have planted this merit; you should encourage it. The two Perfected said: We are uncertain how further to respond; must we surely make them awaken?

The Heavenly Venerable replied: These people are dark and ignorant; to show them the broad road, with verbose and fragmented words, is beyond their capacity of wisdom. Wisdom cannot endure it, and so gives rise to laxity of heart. Now I desire to present the essential and simple words, to clearly show them, so that it may be otherwise. The two Perfected then descended from their seats, bowed before the Heavenly Venerable, and said: We do not know what matters are simple and essential, whereby to open their awakening.

The Heavenly Venerable said: You both resume your seats. I desire to communicate the secret formula of subtle thought and fixed intention. The essentials are simple and easy; from the easy one may attain awakening — is this not a delight? The two Perfected asked: Is the subtle thought and fixed intention a scripture?

The Heavenly Venerable said: It has no written characters. The two Perfected said: Then these disciples meet a wall and are greatly ignorant; without written characters, how can they attain awakening?

The Heavenly Venerable answered: At this moment all scriptures and books originally have written characters. Is not today’s speech also a scripture? The two Perfected said: We earnestly beseech to hear, that we may at once write it down.

The Heavenly Venerable said: Imagine that some people, numbering a thousand or ten thousand, desire to obtain treasure, hearing that the sea contains great abundance. Each prepares vessels, sometimes barges, sometimes boats, a thousand or a hundred, sailing on the great sea; sometimes a thousand or ten thousand li, sometimes near, sometimes far. There are hundreds and thousands of islets and reefs, innumerable islands; some lie within the waters, many precious treasures abound, even to the extent of uncountable seven treasures’ refined light. The light reaches the colour of the heavens, each differing and the same. Sailing boats and companions are so many, and when the wind is about to rise, those who do not perceive the light say, “Let us set forth,” but know not whither.

The Heavenly Venerable further said: Can these boats and companions obtain the treasure?

The two Perfected said: Without a guide, all are without foreknowledge; not discerning the treasure’s light, they wander about in confusion; this journey is very difficult. They must surely reach everywhere, dig everywhere, sometimes strive with great effort in the waters, and perhaps they may succeed.

The Heavenly Venerable said: Those who learn the Way and do not obtain the secret formula of subtle thought and fixed intention are like these people, unaware of the treasure’s light, yet desiring treasure. What pity is this!

The Heavenly Venerable further said: Among such a multitude, suddenly there is one who well discerns the treasure’s light; the treasure’s light surges to the heavens, visible from ten thousand li as if held in the palm. Although many are present, none can see it; the one who sees the light well raises the sail and departs first; all the boats follow him, directly reaching the treasure, and all then obtain the famed seven treasures, each loaded to the brim, returning to their place. The companions say: Thanks to the guide, now we repay our debt. Then each boat gathers its treasures, valuing them at billions and thousands, given as a return of gratitude; is not this delight?

The two Perfected said: What profit is comparable?

The Heavenly Venerable said: Those who learn the Way, obtaining this secret formula of subtle thought and fixed intention, rightly are like those who perceive the treasure’s light.

The Heavenly Venerable further said: Long ago, countless kalpas past, the reign of the heavenly king came to an end; it was time again to change men. The heavenly token of investiture appeared; those who obtained it became the Son of Heaven. Then a good physiognomist saw on a mountain this token of light. On that night, the heavens rained heavily; torches would not stand; the light shone dimly, yet men could not see it. The physiognomist told the villagers: The token of the Son of Heaven is in this mountain. The villagers hearing this all secretly went, but in the dark could not obtain it. The learner had not the secret formula of subtle thought and fixed intention; he was like a blind man wandering. The physiognomist, hearing that men could not see the token, went himself, and immediately obtained it, then ascended the heavenly throne. If a man obtains this secret formula of subtle thought and fixed intention, his mind and intent become fixed; his seeking of the Way is exact and true, as the physiognomist was good at discerning treasure. Do not lightly disclose it; those who lightly disclose it incur the sins of both guardian and guilty, the sin is hard to trace. Therefore, it is not only slighting a scripture but slighting the Way itself. Those who accept the learning should be cautious, cautious indeed. The two Perfected hearing this were exceedingly joyful and responsive in their hearts, wishing only to hear more.

The Heavenly Venerable said: Therefore, wishing to tell you, how can I conceal it? I say the secret formula. Know that within the three realms and the three times all is empty; knowing this emptiness of the three times, though possessing the body, all ought to return to emptiness. Clearly understanding the principle of returning to emptiness, one can forget the body. He who can forget the body, how can he still love the body? Since the body is no longer loved, then he can love nothing at all, only the Way is loved. He who can love the Way, the Way also loves him. He who obtains the Way and loves it begins truly to return. Subtle thought and fixed intention — the principle is completed here. This returns from the two halves to one, the original one, returning to truth; the Way’s accomplishment daily rises; are we not then free from sorrow and toil?

The Heavenly Venerable further said: The joining of two halves into one has five meanings; do you know them? The two Perfected answered: We know. Is it not that from that clear and empty Qi, through the mingling and interchanging, the halves descend, and by these four halves unite into one? Is it not that by this apparent one there may be evil, thereby attracting the natural Qi, sinking into the three paths? Is it not that by goodness, leaving these four halves, one returns to the Great Void, recovers the clear and empty Qi, restores the two halves, and dwells in nature?

The Heavenly Venerable said: You have grasped it. Now I will show the diagram of the turning of two halves in the void, presenting it before the Left Perfected.

Diagram of Two Halves

Also called the True Writing of Subtle Thought and Fixed Intention.

Ritual implements: twenty-four thousand in currency; five taels of gold; one segment each of five-colour patterned scarves; five taels of plain silk; one bolt each of five-direction patterned silk; one bright mirror; a patterned silk for one’s life destiny; one remainder of the year’s reckoning; a pair of golden buttons. Nearly a thousand kinds. The recipient must be trustworthy, carefully counting twelve folds of transmissions; if the transmission is incomplete, it violates the rule and the penalty is fourfold. If the recipient’s faith is insufficient, and unexpectedly the Qi is low and weak, the sin is the same as for violating the transmission; Daoists living in cold retreats are not considered.

Disciple of the Supreme Clarity, one so-and-so, bearing the letter according to law, receives the secret formula, and his mind is fixed and returns half back upwards, so as not to mislead the soul; drinking the elixir, all is one in faith. The two Perfected said: This is indeed simple and essential; only thus is enlightenment granted. Such a subtle and wonderful meaning, as yet unawakened, is beyond gratitude to the Heavenly Venerable for his accomplishment and aid; it is only to hold and bear, and not to be thanked with mere words of today’s humble speech.

The Heavenly Venerable said: Though obtained this formula, one must base oneself on the Ten Precepts. After bestowing the two halves’ secret, next come the Ten Precepts. The presiding master sits southwards; the disciple facing the master bows thrice, saying: I wish to see accomplishment; grant me the Ten Precepts, that I may observe them all my life, and swear not to transgress. Then kneeling long, with the mind holding the presence of the great saints of the ten directions above, he reverently receives them. The master burns incense and gives the precepts:

1. Not to kill, but to think of all beings.

2. Not to commit adultery, nor violate another’s wife.

3. Not to steal, nor take unjust wealth.

4. Not to deceive, for good and evil shall be recompensed.

5. Not to become intoxicated, always thinking of pure conduct.

6. To maintain harmony among kin and relatives, with no estrangement.

7. To rejoice in seeing others do good deeds.

8. To help and make merit when seeing others in sorrow.

9. When others wrong me, to seek no revenge.

10. To have no hope for all those not yet attained to the Way.

These are the Ten Precepts. The recipient says: Disciple so-and-so receives them, and will observe them all his life. Then he bows to the master, and the ceremony is complete.

The Heavenly Venerable said: Those who can receive these Ten Precepts and cultivate accordingly, the heavenly officers of the ten directions will all protect them; they will surely attain the Way. If you are pressed by the cares of the world, and cannot fully attend to all ten, nine, eight, seven, six, down to five, select what you can. Yet even the blessings of the five precepts are difficult to measure. You should widely exhort the multitude weighed down by heavy sins to hear it, even if they do not rejoice, yet not let one or two threads remain; patiently awaken them. If they again become lax, their days will grow more bitter, because their sins are deep; what can be done? The two Perfected said: If there be good men resolved to diligently cultivate, this matter is fortunate and unoccupied; what more need be sought to hasten the Way?

The Heavenly Venerable said: The general teaching and ritual are hidden in the Three Registers and Three Primal Precepts. The Three Registers are the beginning of many scriptures; having appeared in the world, they ought also to descend in sequence. The two Perfected said: Are the Three Registers the Golden Register, Jade Register, and Yellow Register?

The Heavenly Venerable said: Yes, yes. These are teachings beyond form. The utmost principle of subtle thought and fixed intention is to know the wondrous awakening of the Three Primes as one without two; there is both Way and Hell; pray for the seven mysterious sufferings, and also ferry those not yet seen. At that time, in the upper void, someone chanted:

This law is truly profound and wondrous,  
Freeing you from the labours of nine ancestors.  
If this person be not taught, the Way is parted from men.  
Not human and yet hastening to teach,  
Seeing the world and being tested,  
Death descends to the three sufferings,  
Ten thousand kalpas of regret are of no avail.

Those who uttered this chant in the void feared that foolish men might get the scripture and scorn it. Or they might borrow to copy it, or display the book to beg of men. Thus, those with heart and intent had no place to put faith; the Bridge of Law was broken. Therefore be especially cautious, especially cautious. Then the two Perfected mutually said in their hearts: This secret formula is brilliant; hearing it is profound awakening; yet the long and tedious words do not open understanding; what is this thing?

The Heavenly Venerable, knowing their thoughts, replied: You two worthy ones know that all good and evil have causes and conditions; you should receive from me — that is why. I shall explain it to you; be silent and listen. In the ancient past, a time long gone, numberless as the sands of the Ganges, faith beyond measure, in infinitely remote kalpas, there was a worthy and faithful Daoist named Le Jingxin, a wealthy man of vast possessions, wealth beyond reckoning. He greatly believed in the Way and virtue, abiding quietly in contemplation, his heart and mouth swearing: “Though I be so rich, this all comes from blessing; I bear Heaven and Earth, and it is proper to repay the kindness.” The heart of repaying kindness was truly deep, but he did not yet know by what means. From his outer chamber he returned and asked his wife, and explained thus: The Way does not need wealth; what then shall be done? The wife said: The Way arises from the heart; where shall one seek the Way? One should but supply what the Daoists lack at the beginning, that the Daoists attain their fasting and precepts, and promote the Way’s affairs; is this not repaying kindness? Having heard his wife’s words, he was pleased and awakened. At that time there was a Daoist south of the mountain, who constantly fasted and lived in the mountains, perpetually reciting scriptures, living over two hundred li from Jingxin’s home. Jingxin long heard of this person and often yearned to go; he said to his wife: I shall go there to ask what he lacks, and supply according to his wishes; I shall provide surplus, not letting it run out, and also send a small gift. The wife said: That is good; even on the day of death there is support. If not thus, when the body dies and the spirit departs, there is no help. Jingxin then opened his storehouse, bringing forth fine incense, delicate cloth, white felt, auspicious cotton and silk, bedding felts and tents, also ornaments and clothing, gold, silver, and copper vessels, all the finest; and various medicines, many kinds, except ten slaves, preparing ten loads, going to the Daoist’s place. His words were plain and full; as he set forth his offering, he now bore the small gift, presenting it to the Daoist, also giving the head of the ten slaves for cleaning and sweeping. The Daoist accepted it, and Jingxin departed. Returning home, he told his wife all as it was. Hearing that the Daoist had accepted, the couple rejoiced beyond measure. From now on they made it their custom.

In short time, Jingxin and wife had a son named Fajie, aged seventeen. When tending to his parents’ illness, as they neared death, they said to their son: “I have obtained abundant wealth, unlimited possessions, all from the Way. I swear to repay limitless kindness. The Way does not require wealth; only supply for the Daoists is needed. I have lately entered the mountains, and all the provisions are as you see. Now the family property suffices for you; do not neglect it.” Fajie, weeping and sobbing, distressed and troubled, cried aloud to Heaven, falling and rising, gasping for breath, embracing his parents and weeping. Again he said: “Father and mother, you have thus obtained blessing. As you near death, your goodness does not wane. Though the Heavenly Way be distant, how can it fail to respond? I only hope you immediately ascend to the hall of blessing, attaining the highest honour. When I later also reach the end of life, we shall surely meet, all in the Way’s rank.” Then his parents passed away. Fajie wailed loudly and lost breath; after a long while he revived. Because of his father and mother, the family’s harmony and good fortune were united. Though honouring the Daoist first, he also aided kin and clansmen, all near and far benefited. At that time, all who saw kin or not kin, near or far, hastened to go; even the household servants were many. Seeing Fajie and the elders showing filial piety with pure heart and solemn vow, all looked on each other, tears flowing in streams, unable to stop. Thus a fortunate man so fares; when life ends, what then?

Fajie afterwards reverently turned to the Way’s heart, naturally adding to his service and respect, supplying the Daoists, rescuing the poor and giving relief to travellers, and to all beings, a hundredfold of those before. No slightest income came in; expenditures were broad; poverty ensued. His offerings to the Daoists he wished not to connect; as the Daoists aged and had no other place, daily burning incense, he remembered his master who supplied them, and thus poverty followed. Only hoping the Heavenly Way would accept his sincere heart; now old and weak, how to repay it? The Daoists customarily on the last day of the month at the sixth hour would perform the Way; he often felt Fajie in his heart, and sent a letter, calling Fajie to come speak. The letter said: “You bow to your master; at this month’s end, according to usual, one day and six hours of Way practice; no more is needed; come and join us in cultivating merit. Though the blessing be long, it must not be neglected.” Fajie received the letter, rejoicing and saying: “Fajie bows; the Daoist accepts the day’s fasting and will obey command.” When the letter left, he counted the food and stores in the home, all empty; nothing remained.

Remembering his father’s dying injunction, his sadness deepened. He sought to sell the house and land. The house was high and broad, not for common men to dwell, only fit for kings. The king again had his palace; some said this house’s power was exhausted, others said it was inauspicious; none would buy. He wished to sell, fearing that if another owned it, he would never again enter the mountain or see the Daoist. Fajie and his wife dwelt with two sons; the elder Yinzhu, aged eleven, the younger Ciyin, called Anu, just eight years old. Both were comely and upright, peerless and unmatched; their breathing and chanting were as jade sounds; their gait and manners were virtuous and abundant; though young, they were diligent, replying to near and far, revering relations, skilled in calligraphy and speech, each standing out among men. Their aunt, greatly wealthy and without male heir, always delighted in these boys, without elder or younger brothers, only wishing to have one able to serve her; she lent one million in money, coveting the boys, caring not for cost. Fajie suddenly recalled and asked his wife: I once heard your sister loved my son; do you now wish this? The wife did not know the meaning of his question and answered: Better all die than have such a son sold before our eyes; to sell a son to live only increases sorrow and thought; thus would be death indeed; there is no such reason. He said: I do not sell the son to supply food or body, but for the Daoists in the mountain, to supply their needs. Have you forgotten the dying injunction of our forefathers? The wife wiped tears, knelt and answered: Though impoverished, it is truly in the heart; if so, the matter is of blessing and virtue, and indeed the forefather’s injunction; how can it be otherwise? The wife said: If the ritual is somewhat neglected, we should bring the son to report to your sister. When mother and son were about to depart, the son knelt to his father and said farewell, then spoke thus to his father: “I shall go far from beneath your knees; my fondness is boundless; I hope father in your comings and goings will look upon me. Our natures arise from within; we embrace and weep together.” Anu and grandfather, moved to the utmost, Yinzhu held his brother’s head, loudly weeping, saying: “The matter of blessing and virtue I also shall not long survive; words cannot fully express it.” Seeing his sons thus, the father’s heart was also shaken; fearing his wife’s regret, he said to her: “Now let us go to your sister, pledge one hundred thousand money for a month’s term, hoping the house will be sold, and the son redeemed. If by the term he is not redeemed, he will long be with your sister.” Thus, compelled by affection, the mother and son set forth. The mother reached her sister’s home, fully explained the pledge and the son’s meaning; the sister hearing this rejoiced greatly, and gave all the money to make fifty thousand, sent three carts carrying the sister and money, and returned the son. Ciyin knelt to his mother to bid farewell; the father made such merit, and would surely attain the Way; before this was achieved, he wished his grandparents well, hoping that in their comings and goings they would look upon him. Ciyin wished to comfort his aunt, but restrained his tears. His mother near boarding the carriage, departing afar and near, the affection of mother and son could not be severed; though not crying aloud, mother, son, and aunt all wept a hundred streams of tears. Then Ciyin knelt before his aunt and said: “Now I am your child, no different from your own. When men separate there is still bewilderment and confusion; I hope aunt will forgive me. I now wish to beg a thousand money to give to father, separately sent by grandmother’s carriage.” The aunt pitied the child’s sentiment, and was more respectful; she then considered and gave him one hundred thousand money, saying: “Take this to give; it may suffice.” Freely given. Ciyin knelt and said: “You give too much money,” and told his mother: “Six ten-thousands I give to grandfather and grandmother; this is the heart of the slave, to supply the two elders, the daily funds; this is but little; I hope to supply by myself, and not use otherwise; two ten-thousands I give to my elder brother, hoping he will diligently supply and watch; the rest twenty thousand I send to the Daoist in the mountain, hoping my father, mother, brother, and aunt will always share blessings.” He did not say “together” or “sharing,” also fearing to offend his aunt’s feelings. The mother returned home, remembering her son; the brothers cherished one another greatly; eating, resting, and playing, and in their comings and goings never differing; when one had a special taste, they shared; never eating alone. One day separating, “Now I alone return, for blessing’s sake.” Yinzhu behind was very anxious; hearing mother obtained much money back, knowing brother did not return, wiped tears and covered his face, knelt and asked mother: “Grandmother and slave parted, slave wept as if…” The mother wished to suppress the thought, but said: “No weeping.” The aunt always remembered your brothers and rejoiced at their meeting, holding them closely, feeding many fruits, smiling and bidding farewell, sending you money.” Yinzhu knew he surely would weep; the grandmother comforted him. He liked to sleep with grandfather; now alone there, unaccustomed, he must surely miss grandfather and aunt. Just now parted from grandmother; how could he not weep? Thereupon he sighed: “The two brothers suddenly part; father and mother for the Way; the Way must remember them; each will surely strengthen the other.” Saying thus, sighing and weeping, tears falling over his face, gasping, unable to stop.

Fajie then supplied market offerings and food, and added a large gift to the Daoists. The Daoists were amazed and asked whence this came. Fajie dared not conceal, and answered fully. The Daoists said nothing, and all feasted together. When the feast ended, Fajie took leave and returned home, suddenly seeing all the various storehouses — gold, silver, pearls, jade, money, silk, cotton, cloth, brocade, and coloured silks; rice stores, food vessels, granaries for grain — all were full. He asked his wife, who said: “Not official deposits; it suddenly appeared.” The couple were at once fearful and joyful, sometimes fearing a dream, sometimes Heaven’s grace; they could not calm their minds. Fajie again entered the mountains and asked the Daoists, reporting all. The Daoists answered: “I, poor Daoist, last night lectured outside; in the middle of the night I dreamed of a man holding a true material wish-fulfilling treasure, giving it to you, and you accepted it. I thought it a good omen, but dared not learn it, fearing the matter was not ripe. The others at the feast called me a babbler; now indeed it is so; this is Heaven’s grace; how could men dare to seize it? You are respectful and your faith is manifest in the mysterious and distant; enough to attract this; doubt is not needed; only avoid suspicion.” Fajie said: “I still wish to tell the king, to let him know if this may be so.” The Daoist said: “Good.” Fajie told the king, who answered: “You are diligent and transcend the world; how could Heaven not respond? This is Heaven’s grace; how could men dare to seize it? Only do not fear, and have no suspicion of me.” Fajie returned home, told his wife and brother, and explained all. The king and the Daoist spoke with one voice; this was indeed Heaven’s grace, increasing trust. Thus they succeeded and prospered, blessings eternal without end.

Thereupon the Heavenly Venerable asked the two Perfected: Do you know these three-time men? The two Perfected answered: This matter is long past; indeed unknown to us.

The Heavenly Venerable said: At that time Le Jingxin was myself; Fajie is the Left Mysterious Perfected; Fajie’s wife is the Right Mysterious Perfected. Do you somewhat recall the kindness of ancient nurture, leading to today’s situation, and mutual awakening? This is its cause. The two Perfected hearing the teaching began to awaken; though recalling this matter, their understanding was clear without obscurity; yet it was distant and long ago. Before words finished, suddenly a cloud sedan with eight colours appeared; the two rode together, attended by immortal boys and jade maidens, playing the great celestial music, coming from southeast, stopping before the Heavenly Venerable, bowing; then turning to bow to the two Perfected. The two then realized: these are the two brothers who once breathed. Now the attendant Mistress of the Court, is she not the ancient lady of the Heavenly Venerable, the earlier parent? After the seating was arranged, they were to go to pay their respects.

The Heavenly Venerable said: Yes, do you know? The two Perfected said: To sell one’s son to supply the Way is indeed suffering.

The Heavenly Venerable said: Such folk have no measure; some sell themselves to supply the Way; some cast themselves before starved tigers; some cut flesh to feed birds; some kill themselves to offer to worms; some pledge their wives and children; some give their heads to men. Such examples are endless through kalpas, too many to tell. Why so? All these are true real men who have attained the Way, jointly making themselves visible, exhorting and transforming the ignorant; their bodies no longer pain; they see the principle of men. Sometimes these are illusions; this is not strange. Thus, when telling of Yinzhu, Ciyin brothers, and their three generations of six persons, they were all then mere mortals, yet able thus. This is indeed a rare comparison; thus I tell it. The two Perfected said: Truly as the teaching states, we have obtained the essence of the many scriptures; each rejoices, and thinks: if any have slight affinity, they will surely joyfully receive it. Then they said to the Heavenly Venerable: Now going forth to spread this scripture, we do not know the weight of ritual and faith; we carefully ask you above.

The Heavenly Venerable said: You have not yet fully understood; it is very proper to ask. For this reason, there is great and profound secret law, hidden; thus it is not spoken of at once. You all listen carefully and wisely; this prohibition is strictest; be careful not to err.

The Heavenly Venerable then told the Right Mysterious Perfected: You having received this scripture, may choose persons to transmit it without ritual faith. He also told the Left Mysterious Perfected: You having received this scripture, shall follow the ritual and faith, employing money, silks, and other items, all according to the rule. This law comes from the condensed thought of the Great Lord of Vast Emptiness and Primal Simplicity, treasured and cultivated by the elders of the five directions. The recipient separately brings five fen of gold, five taels of plain silk, to offer to the spiritual elders of the five directions. The patterned silk for life destiny, longevity one hundred and twenty years, reckoning one remainder of the year; for lords and kings one bolt; for common men one zhang; for the poor one chi. These three kinds must be carefully complete. If lacking and forcibly accepted, the recipient is guilty, with increase or decrease according to poverty or wealth. The Left Mysterious Perfected doubted and complained to the Heavenly Venerable: The Right Mysterious Perfected accepts this scripture without ritual tokens, yet sees the envoy severely reprimand so; the scripture and law are one yet differ; how can this be explained?

The Heavenly Venerable said: It is not partiality; you do not yet know. The myriad multitudes differ; each heart is different; thus two paths are opened, yet they return to one. Therefore, right Mysterious disciples are monks and laymen; laymen universally practice begging, using breaking evil as the bridge of law; those able to give receive ten thousandfold blessing. Therefore now when bestowing the scripture, ritual faith is not emphasized. Your disciples now, even if stationed to guard, relying on begging to ferry men, if men have nothing to give, they add to their sin; with no manifest faith, how can they be ferried? Hence the establishment of ritual faith. The reward of ritual faith is immeasurable, like a scripture without end; it does not hinder the Right Mysterious’s giving of blessings.

The Heavenly Venerable further said: The Right Mysterious disciples who give to laymen, can diminish their giving of wealth to men; their blessings are ten thousandfold, yet ten thousandfold has an end. The Left Mysterious disciples bearing faith and receiving scripture, this is faith in the Way, thus giving wealth to the Way. Hence their blessings are like the scripture without end. Though the Left Mysterious Perfected follows the teaching, his heart yet does not fully grasp the principle that blessings are like the scripture without end; what then is the principle?

The Heavenly Venerable, perceiving his thoughts, said to the great sage: You have doubts? Have no suspicion. Therefore it is said blessings are like the scripture without end. Why so? Suppose you obtain this scripture, write it out one copy, pass it to one person, ten persons, a hundred persons, millions, billions uncounted; each person writes one copy, infinite copies, spreading without limit. You would still have the ritual faith’s reward; such is endless. Suppose now you give one or ten thousand gold to the master to receive the scripture; afterward obtain blessings like the scripture without end, continually without exhaustion; fearing some disciple might fail to awaken, this is but an analogy. The reward of faith in scripture, according to the faith amount, is like a good well; even if there be a great drought over the world, with the source cut off a hundred zhang deep, the well remains full; the master of the well has enough to use, and gives to others; hundreds or thousands of millions, all the townsfolk, may freely draw and receive salvation without limit, ending without exhaustion. This is the natural endless reward.

The Heavenly Venerable said: Since you can believe the Way, and use the Way’s faith, you can believe scripture, reducing and restraining body and mouth to receive scripture; the wealth reward is endless; therefore it is called immeasurable, adding the blessing of trusting the Way. The blessing of trusting the Way makes one’s spirit intelligent and wisdom like the scripture without end. For example, one lamp, turning into one hundred lamps, one thousand lamps, ten thousand lamps, billions upon billions of lamps, innumerable lamps, illuminating throughout the void. The first lamp’s light is not diminished; this is blessing, wisdom without end. You should universally tell those who receive scripture, guiding them with wisdom, awakening all. Thus the well and lamps are not alone sufficient, yet suffice by themselves. The Left Mysterious Perfected again doubted, saying: If the whole world have a great drought, a hundred zhang without source, how can the well still be full? He wished to ask but dared not.

The Heavenly Venerable already knew the Left Mysterious’s meaning, and again said: That is why it is called a good well. At that time, among the void, many immortals and great saints listened to the teaching; billions upon billions all awakened and unanimously praised it. Each praise of blessing advanced blessing three grades. The Left Mysterious Perfected’s doubt was resolved, his understanding broad and clear; he knew the responsibility of scripture and faith was an even greater principle. He descended from his seat and bowed, saying: Now I have begun to awaken.

At that time, the two rode a cloud sedan, being the ancient Yinzhu and Ciyin brothers, hearing the essential words, immediately with twelve hundred immortal boys and jade maidens, prostrated presenting to the Left Mysterious Perfected, asking to receive the secret formula. The Left Mysterious Perfected then granted the two the secret formula of subtle thought and fixed intention. The two believed and understood, and entered the third grade of immortality. At that time the twelve hundred immortal boys and maidens, seeing the two receive scripture and attain the Way, each then removed their precious jewels and necklaces, presenting them to the Left Mysterious Perfected, asking to receive the honored scripture. Having received it, they read it through once; their spirits opened and awakened, knowing the three realms are empty, blessings will end, and all should repent. The twelve hundred then within their bodies transformed and entered immortality.

At that time in the void was a heavenly man, doubting the Heavenly Venerable’s parable, saying: Those who learn the Way and do not obtain the secret formula of subtle thought and fixed intention are like entering the sea to gather treasures without a guide. Also saying: Like a fool entering an empty mountain to seek the Son of Heaven’s token, setting thus, at the beginning of creation there was no such scripture; how then could the Heavenly Venerable Great Saint attain the Way?

Having such thought, the Heavenly Venerable knew. He replied to the heavenly man: You have not yet entered the heavenly ranks; how can you understand far the cause of creation? Those who attained the Way before the scripture and law appeared were all simple and honest, conduct following nature; natural conduct accords with principle; darkness accords with principle, naturally mysterious awakening. The reason for mysterious awakening has no written characters; they were gathered into a scripture to inform later generations; what cause for suspicion? Like a man fallen into hell, does he first need hell’s law? The heavenly man praised: The holy venerable’s words awaken my ignorance. Then he repented and thanked, advancing one grade in immortality.

At that time there were twelve youths, at leisure enjoying the world, daily gathered, making fine food, drinking merrily and playing, sometimes discussing the difficulty or ease of the Way. The Heavenly Venerable with the Way’s eye remotely saw these men; in their former lives they had been teachers, but secretly withheld the secret scripture; hence disciples’ hearts about the Way were also hesitating; therefore, slight affinity, yet possible to ferry. The Heavenly Venerable then transformed into a mortal, passing through the assembly, begging food, and spoke to the youths, again discussing as before. One said: I have often followed my elder brother to Mount Anle, seeing the Daoists all bearing the Ten Precepts, solemn and excellent. Thus after death, the soul and spirit’s place will not be empty. But it is difficult for men to fully observe the Ten Precepts. The transformed man said: Observing these is easy; breaking them is difficult. The men heard and all agreed. They asked how it is that observing the precepts is easy, but breaking them difficult. The transformed man said: Upright conduct is as a precept; not fearing the Son of Heaven nor ghosts and spirits; how then is it not easy? Those who break the precepts fear all, and fear ghosts and spirits; how then is it not difficult? Then the twelve youths all had intention of the Way, thinking for themselves. One, fond of wine, said: For me, only wine is hard to give up. It is my nature’s liking; I dare not count. Why? When I first take the elixir, on the day of dispersing hair, only wine can loosen me, so I dare. The transformed man said: The hair-dispersing is the medicine; it nourishes the four elements; medicinal wine may be passed; only do not overdo, at most as usual. One said: For me also it is possible; but false speech is very difficult. Why? Because sometimes there are secret matters of the body, or respect for elders must be concealed; if men ask, one cannot but deceive; to deceive is to break the precept. Thus it is difficult. The transformed man said: There is concealment and disclosure in affairs; speech has expediency; this is also passable; but do not reverse good and evil, do not speak of others’ faults, words hurt others. One said: For me all is easy except the precept against stealing. Even the smallest is a breach of the eye. The transformed man said: Great matters are difficult; the small between them is not less easy to be cautious of. Then he recited this verse:

Why not accept the stealing precept? Without accepting it stealing is also hard.  
Who says in darkness and ignorance? Within is a recording officer for theft.  
Taking year by year double, double without leniency.  
Hands holding copper coins, burning mouth, cooking heart and liver.  
Once told of this pain, the whole year the heart is sore.  
Why not accept this precept, and keep it surely intact?  
My faith and his faith, everywhere there is no unease.  
Calmly sitting to summon spirits, forever enjoying long years of joy.

One said: For me all is easy; only the precept against lust is hardest to cut off. Because I once practiced this, often following my elder brother to feasts. At the feast, it was said: One day of diligence, nothing is unreasonable; and that after death one must surely receive the blessing of these fasts and precepts. But at night, this I pity, yet repeatedly indulge, though bitterly checked, unconsciously it occurs; often so, this is hardest. The transformed man said: Lust is but imagination; imagination is all emptiness; what colour is there? But first observe your body, know it is nothing; then know no colour; how can one not endure? Also lust is like drinking salt water; the more you drink, the more thirsty you are; only death can end it; what is there of satisfaction? Then the transformed man said this verse:

Lust is fiercer than thirst; small endurance may pass.  
Why drink salt water? Salt water only makes thirst worse.  
If you can skillfully understand thirst, then drink heavenly sweet dew.  
Sweet dew fragrant and pungent, flowing throughout the body.  
Heavenly beings follow the scent and descend; mysterious intent naturally awakes.  
Calmly, peacefully, forever inactive, long preserve the nine heavens’ blessing.

One said: For me all is possible; only the precept against killing is hardest. My nature likes to look at chickens; one meal without meat has no taste, and after several days I grow thin. The transformed man said: The wise man’s fat is a burden; thinness lightens the body; why use fat? Then he said this verse:

The wise man forbids killing, nor harbours thoughts of killing.  
Though beings be tiny, they all delight in life and growth.  
How can one harm their lives to nourish oneself?  
To nourish oneself, now a verse, accumulating your natural ease.  
Long sinking in the three paths, bitter and then born again.  
Good and evil each have causes, like a call and its echo.  
Why not change this conduct, with a compassionate heart as reward?  
The true man embraces the Way, roaming freely, observing the measure of things.

Having spoken this verse, the transformed man appeared in great majestic transformation, appearing in the Way’s guise, attended by officials, playing celestial music unsurpassable and unnamable, above. All saw this, mingled joy and fear, and heard the essential teaching; their minds opened and awakened. All went together to the Left Mysterious Perfected, requesting to receive the scripture and the Ten Precepts. The Perfected also, with the Way’s eye, saw these men’s former lives and causes, and the reason for their difficulty in awakening; the Heavenly Venerable descended with many explanations to awaken them; thus he made the establishment. Not to bestow it now, because they have affinity but cannot fully cut off; only to say to meet the next day to bestow. The next day, the next day, endlessly. The youths said among themselves: Our lives are hard to keep; we cannot again be as before; the next day, the next day. They each fasted with ritual faith and prepared to depart, earnestly and bitterly begging, saying: We bow and strike ourselves, blood flows in great measure; yet we must not cease. The Left Perfected’s compassionate heart surely will grant us. They said:

Men born so and so, bowing and begging the Way, striking themselves,  
Today’s day, time flows away; always fearing slight Qi,  
Suddenly as if blind; blind and without light;  
Long night is hard to pass, lonely and distressed; seeking release nowhere.  
Humbly hearing the Heavenly Venerable’s exposition of subtle thought and fixed intention,  
With Ten Precepts and law, simple words and essential matters, no detail left out.  
The diligent ones eagerly hope to receive and obey;  
Morning received, evening gone, forever without regret.  
If again delayed, day passes day, the mushroom’s brief life,  
Unknown tomorrow, good or ill.  
Such subtle interest first appears in ten thousand generations;  
Meeting now, now to delay, like blind men catching sparrows,  
In the hand and then gone; though after ten thousand kalpas, how can it be met again?  
Hence utterly exhausted, prepare faith according to law;  
The terms as on the left, respectfully bow and present, earnestly seeking accomplishment. Respectfully submit.

Five taels of gold as base,  
Five taels plain silk,  
Life-destiny patterned silk, yearly remainder, nearly a thousand,  
Five dou of rice,  
One bundle of firewood;  
Five kinds as required.

Thus ends the Supreme Cavern Mysterious Spiritual Treasure Scripture of Wisdom, Fixed Intention, and Subtle Communication.
