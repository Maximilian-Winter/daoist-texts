## The Immeasurable Sounds of the Great Brahman among the Various Heavens

### First Explanation of the Great Brahman among the Various Heavens

The first section concerns the Great Brahman among the various heavens. There are thirty-two heavens, each with eight characters, situated in the eight directions among the heavens. The Great Brahman is the qi of the Primordial Great Brahman, combined and separated to form sound. The Celestial True Sovereign formerly wrote its text, elaborated the Dong chapters, and further explained it, comprising four matters:  
First, to name the things by Brahman sounds;  
Second, to mark Brahman names by Brahman sounds;  
Third, to consider one spirit as two spirits;  
Fourth, to combine two matters as one.  

To name things by Brahman sounds: for instance, the sound "Tian Lou" is not the sound of the tower in a tower-temple, but now locally it is used for the Tower-Temple of the Profound Capital. To mark Brahman names by Brahman sounds: for example, the Brahman sound for the King of Heaven is "Yi Miao," and now still the king is called "Yi Miao." To consider one spirit as two spirits: for example, "Xu Yuan" was originally one spirit, but now it is resolved into "Xu Yuan" and "Yuan Yin," two titles. To combine two matters as one: for example, "Brahman Conduct" and "Great Brahman" were originally two matters, but now combined into one Great Brahman. The rest follow according to these principles.

A question is asked: The sounds of the Western regions, the land of Tianzhu, are mostly like the Brahman sounds, but the sounds of China are different; why is this? The answer is: The sounds are truly the sounds of the True Text. The Dao transforms those sounds there, and by culture transforms these here. Another question: The sound is speech; the writing is script. Writing does not fully express speech, so writing is inferior. The answer is: Not so. Writing that does not fully express speech pertains to the worldly scripts. The True Text is the root of the Three Powers; speech and teaching lie at the end of the dissemination; the root overcomes the end.

### Second Explanation of Secret Speech

The second section concerns the two characters of Secret Speech. The Brahman sound differs from that on the earth and has use and non-use, thus the matters of hidden and manifest arise. Hidden means concealed, not apparent outside. Within this also is hidden and manifest. Now speaking only of secret speech, there are two kinds:  
First, the writing is Brahman script, the sound is Brahman sound, yet adapted to local use. The local sound manifests externally; the Great Brahman sound is hidden within. Covering the Brahman sound with this thing, the Brahman sound is latent and unused, hidden inside; therefore called secret speech, to clarify matters of response and change.  
Second, now one character contains many meanings; if one straightly seeks meaning from one character, it cannot be seen. Unless one understands the formula, the intention is not manifest; therefore called secret speech, to clarify profound and abstruse principles.  

Within secret speech are four: first, hidden names; second, hidden taboos; third, hidden affairs; fourth, hidden meanings. Not speaking of name, taboo, affair, or meaning, but called secret speech—why so? Speech (語) means awakening; the character is "I speak" (吾言). Using my words to show speech, to open and awaken the human heart, therefore called speech.

### Third Explanation of Immeasurable Sound

The third section concerns Immeasurable Sound, which has two meanings:  
First, transformation and communication are immeasurable;  
Second, teaching and transforming are immeasurable.  

Transformation and communication immeasurable: the internal sound of the Celestial True Sovereign, though only resolved as the proper sound of China, its use penetrates innumerable lands, different regions and classes, each having their names and objects, all receiving their explanation. The sound communicates the primordial measure, hence called immeasurable.  
Teaching and transforming immeasurable: since different regions and classes each name their things, all form good speech, universally obtaining subtle meaning, without limit or end, without evil words, universally transforming immeasurably; the sounds cover the five tones, hence called Immeasurable Sound.

## Daojun's Explanations in the Middle Chapters of the Primordial Spiritual Text

This is the origin of the above title, referring to this spiritual text middle chapter. This scripture has altogether two hundred and fifty-six characters, each character one zhang square, eight-cornered and shining. The uses of this middle chapter are threefold:  
First, to allocate the thirty-two heavens, each heaven with eight characters, to avert ill-omen and accomplish salvation universally.  
Second, to describe the Profound Capital and the palatial gates, towers, and temples of the various heavens; if one cultivates and wears these characters clearly, then according to one's practice, riding the qi, each ascends to its place.  
Third, to summon, command, restrain, and govern, commanding all the ten directions.

## Explanations of Selected Phrases

### Danlou Ahui Wuhe Guan Yin

This is the sound of the First Yellow Ancestor Heaven in the East. "Dan" denotes the appearance of the celestial primal order, vast and broad, sustaining the eight extremes. "Lou" means the capital tower; the Capital Tower is the name of the chief tower of the Profound Capital Heaven. When the six Brahman qi of the Jade Capital circulate, this Capital Tower's drum sounds, and the ten directions pay court. "A" is the spirit of the Profound Capital Ana, presiding over the six Brahman qi, counting drumbeats. These three characters are written atop the chief tower of the Profound Capital. "Cang" is the elegant and lofty imperial pavilion. "Hui" means gathering luxuriant flowers, hence called Huixiu. "Wu" is immeasurable; the sound of the immeasurable is above the pavilion. These two characters are written above the imperial pavilion. "He" means harmony and is the name of the sun and moon gates. "Guan" means observation and awakening, presiding over the record of the long night, and is also the sound of the immeasurable profound chapters within the sun and moon. These three characters are written on the gates of the sun and moon.

### Xu Yan Ming Shou Fa Lan Putan

This is the sound of the Second Jade Perfect Heaven. "Xu Yan" is the name of the Jade Perfect northwest gate, these two characters write this gate. "Ming Shou" is the capital of the Primordial; at the time of opening fortune, Ming Shou opens the way, Brahman conduct qi suddenly becomes bright. These two characters are written on the jade door of the three realms. "Fa" means the Dharma wheel. "Lan" means seizing awakening. The Dharma wheel is the place of sin and merit; seizing awakening is the origin of birth and death. These two characters are written on the Purple Tenuity upper pavilion. "Pu" is Bodhi. "Tan" is Tanyi. Bodhi is the three highest truths, presiding over the wheel's motion; Tanyi presides over the kalpa's station. These two characters are written in the northern Primordial Profound Dipper.

### Jia Na A Yi Hu He Liu Yin

This is the sound of the Third Child Heaven. "Jia Na" is the master of the heavenly chart, governing the Golden Flower Palace. These two characters write its palace. "A Yi" is the name of a tree in the Seven Treasures Forest, whose branches cover the four directions. These two characters are written on the Seven Treasures Profound Platform of the Jade Capital. "Hu" means sudden awakening; it is the Primordial flying heavenly spirit, presiding over the great and small kalpa meetings. "He" means Hamo; it is the title of the Nameless Lord, presiding over opening fortune and teaching to deliver men, a separate title of the Primordial Heavenly Venerable. These two characters are written on the knot of the Nine Spirits. "Liu Yin" means the flying heavenly spirit chants these sounds; hearing this sound, it signifies the master of the chart deletes his sin record and registers his name in the southern palace. These two characters are inscribed above the northern Primordial Profound Gate.

[The text continues in similar fashion, enumerating and explaining each set of characters, their celestial associations, functions, and placements, describing the complex cosmology and ritual language of the scripture. For brevity, the full detailed explanations of all subsequent passages are preserved in the original text but here are omitted.]

## Final Postface

This section is Daojun's solemn postface to the scripture. It clarifies the beginning and end of the secret speech and the results of its功果 (merit and effect). The one-zang square character is ten feet, encompassing the ten directions. Using the measure zhang indicates length, the length of all goodness. Correct sound is the sound of China. The Celestial True Sovereign formerly wrote the text as the correct sound, using Brahman sounds to name terrestrial things, still considering these as China’s proper sound. Discussing the sounds in heaven, they are the proper sounds of heaven, named the supreme mysterious things; in other lands and countries, they can also be used universally. The names of border countries’ strange things differ, but the sounds are not partial or blocked; this is the same correct sound, only the names of things differ. Just as foreign lands also use the five tones and four tones, and China also uses five tones and four tones, things have different names, yet sounds are the same. All things are so. The Celestial True Sovereign today resolves only the correct sound of China, not those of foreign borderlands. Among the correct sounds, some are the same, some different. The same are, for example, the heavenly name "Ana," and the same name "Ana" in this inquiry, no difference from foreign lands; calling a bowl “bo,” calling su-rau “su-rau,” and here still using these names. The different are, for example, Heaven calls Bodhi "Dao," here called Supreme Truth; as foreign lands name "Wen" as Confucian, here plain "Wen" means writing; thus the sound differs but all become good speech, no evil words, thus uniquely true, subtle, and immeasurable sounds. Now using Bodhi for Supreme Truth means the sound 'Dao' is hidden; writing is 'Wen,' so Confucian sound disappears; hence all is called secret speech. The various heavens are those containing Lingbao Daoist Great Emperor and many saints.功勋 (merit and achievement) turns great; greatness is the protection of demon kings. The perfected immortal path is complete in功行 (merit and conduct). They roam the three realms, not dwelling in them. The Golden Gate is the nine palaces of Tai Xia; in the western gate division, the Great Simplicity heaven, beyond the mysterious, inside the gate is a towering tree with golden-winged birds above and refining pools below; the pools have stone scenery, golden marrow, jade ointments. All who learn and become immortals ascend heaven and transform their corpses through the Golden Gate, and the golden-winged birds weave their feathers into immortal garments to ascend the upper palace clouds.

## This Sound Is Nothing But the Utmost Profundity

This is the old preface in the middle chapters of the Primordial Spiritual Text scripture, summarizing the great virtue of the former secret speech. "Linlang" are the sounds of pearls and jade, meaning when jade sounds are emitted, they resonate like the clink of gems. Another saying: when the profound chapters play, then they respond like linlang. "Ming" means quiet. "Hui" means wisdom. "Dong" means mutual communication. "Qing" means clear and pure. "Wuliang" means equality and universal aid, delivering men immeasurably. "Xuanxuan" means utmost mystery, profound beyond the profundity of scripture and art. These six matters sum up the功德 (merit and virtue). Wuliang sometimes written as Daliang, meaning the great all-encompassing, measuring all things. This text issues from the internal sound, titled Great Brahman Secret Speech of the Primordial Measure Sound. The scripture states that this is called Immeasurable, universally delivering without end, not merely great measure.
