The Scripture of the Cavernous Profundity, Spiritual Treasure, and Immeasurable Salvation of Men: Mantras and Pronunciations

In holding the Supreme Cavernous Profundity Spiritual Treasure Immeasurable Ten Divisions of the Venerable Scripture, one should face east and perform three bows; then face north standing, turn left to face east again, and click the teeth thirty-six times. Imagine the five-coloured clouds filling the chamber; the Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Lion, Black Tortoise, Vermilion Bird, and Phoenix all guarding the front and rear; the Jade Maidens and Immortal Children, the Five Emperors and Divine Officers, the celestial troops numbering nine hundred million, forming a guard to the right and left. Then one should sway the body three times and complete the recitation of the scripture, then proceed to bow from the south side, as at the beginning.

The foregoing is taken from the Golden Register of Simple Scriptures.

Whenever opening the Spiritual Essence and reciting the scripture, incense should be burned, the ceremonial garb properly arranged, and the scripture saluted according to the ritual. The spell to be chanted is thus:

Silent, silent, utmost non-origin,  
Void standing, the kalpa-blade Ah.  
Radiant is the cavernous profound text,  
Who can fathom this remote and secret?

Once entering the great vehicle path,  
Who counts the many kalpas?  
Neither birth nor extinction,  
Desire to be born is the lotus flower.

Surpassing the three worlds’ fellows,  
Compassionate heart, loosing worldly nets.  
The perfect man’s supreme virtue,  
Generations become immortal houses.

The foregoing is taken from the Supreme Ultimate Treasure Mantra. The same spell and method apply to holding the Scripture on the Chapter of Vital Spirit.

The "Supreme Cavernous Profundity Spiritual Treasure Immeasurable Salvation of Men, Highest Grade Marvelous Scripture" is the law of man and Tao conjoined, comprehensively distinguishing all abodes and assemblages. It is the supreme law of the highest generation, the king of laws, and the transforming master promulgated by the Tao Lord. The Cavernous Profundity Spiritual Treasure is the general title of the ten divisions, and the Immeasurable Salvation of Men the individual heading of one scroll. "Supreme" is the greatest of laudations. "Highest" is the epitome of loftiness. Loftiness is to occupy the summit without peer; greatness is beyond all measure. To manifest the noble virtue and dignity of the sage body, to exhaust principle and subtlety, to turn and return without measure, difficult to conceive or speak, hence called Supreme Highest. "Cavernous" means void and unobstructed, broad and effortless, surveying the clear and distant, manifest and penetrating afar. "Profound" means subtle, deep and remote, wondrously silent and pure, principle reaching into the dim, secret, and distant. "Spiritual" means refined, bright and vigorous, wisdom illuminating perfectly, responding to all changes and corresponding to the entirety of nature's fitness, truly wise encompassing myriad mechanisms. "Treasure" means precious, excellent, exalted and glorious; when disseminated its image forms heaven and earth; when lending Qi it contains birth, transformation, and nurture. "Immeasurable Salvation of Men"—"immeasurable" means without number; "salvation" means to cross over and aid; "men" is the designation of beings. This signifies the salvation of heaven and men to the utmost measure without quantity; all who ascend and advance enter the marvelous gate, accomplishing mindfulness and returning to the unmanifest. The Highest Grade Marvelous Scripture began from the unoriginated, spoken first and foremost; among all grades it is marked above; the original source is ever serene; hence called Marvelous Scripture. Pursuing this intent, the meaning encompasses immeasurability, clarifying the immeasurable, having fivefold significance: first, the body immeasurable; second, virtue immeasurable; third, might immeasurable; fourth, grades immeasurable; fifth, sound immeasurable.  
Body immeasurable: the venerable source and origin of heaven is long and ancient, inherently difficult to know; or truly it responds in two bodies, provisional and actual, two wisdoms; hence it takes the name of Dragon Han, that is the formless sun; when called Kaihuang, it is styled Primordial Beginning; adapting teachings according to occasions, providing medicine for ailments, responding universally without exhaustion; the Origin is nowhere—this is the first original body and measure.  
Virtue immeasurable: the body dwells in primordial Yang, serene in spirit, quiet and vast, mouth containing five colours, radiance illuminating the great thousandfold worlds, able to enable the receiver of the Dharma pearl to hear the Highest Scripture—this is the second immeasurable virtue.  
Might immeasurable: the sage embraces sun and moon, determines Yin and Yang, returns mountains and settles streams, adjusts and harmonizes Qi order, cutting off thousands of heads, subduing devils and demons, millions of shapes, evil does not disturb the right—this is the third immeasurable might.  
Grades immeasurable: if we speak of worldly things, all have ranks and orders, some high, some low, few or many; now the sage responds to things according to conditions, neither high nor low, following opportunity and convenience, neither less nor more, difficult to measure by high or low, nor to obtain by few or many; therefore no grades, grades are immeasurable—this is the fourth original measure of grades.  
Sound immeasurable: the sage expounds by speechless teaching, teaching without limit; soundless echoes, echoes without end; enabling through kalpas awakening and enlightenment, men and heaven clearly hear; hence called Great Brahma Secret Language, the sound immeasurable; also called the sound within heaven—this is the fifth immeasurable sound.  
Briefly stated in outline, such is the meaning.

The foregoing is taken from the Preface to the Ten Divisions of the Spiritual Treasure of the Cavernous Origin.

The "Four Extremes Bright Rules" say: whenever reciting the scripture, the heart and eyes must correspond; the eyes must not look idly; the heart must have no wandering thoughts. Always have the volume and phrases completed without interruption; neither omit nor alter the heavenly sound. Three offenses are absolutely forbidden to immortals; five offenses or more cause death and suffering in the three paths of hell and the five torments for myriad kalpas. The "Hidden Notes" say: after reading five hundred words, click the teeth three times, lick the upper and lower lips with the tongue, swallow saliva three times; this prevents exhaustion and clears the voice; without this method, energy is wasted and spirit fatigued.

The foregoing is taken from the Preface to the Inner Affairs and Mental Work of the Spiritual Treasure of the Cavernous Profundity.

Among men many recite the Scripture of the Cavernous Profundity Spiritual Treasure Primordial Measure Salvation of Men; though they have spells of blessing and imagining, few understand the regulation and measure. Now again fully explained, so that it may be known. From the title downward it descends the Primordial True Scripture, being the Tao Lord’s supplementary praise, suitably following the Ten Divisions of the Cavernous Profundity. To preserve remembrance of the inner sounds, one must follow this method. Now it is fully enumerated as follows.

When reading to the words of the Tao, next follow the text below, preserving thought, blessing, and recitation of ministers and the first and second (heavenly) officials. If for oneself, one should not say so; for others, one should not say so; because the minister's mind cannot be dual. If for oneself and others, one should follow this text. When finished, draw in the Qi thirty-two times, slowly drawing in the Qi of the Thirty-two Heavens, then recite according to the law.

This scripture the Supreme Great Tao Lord received from the Primordial Heaven Venerable, transmitted teachings to the world. The Tao Lord composed the front preface, middle preface, and rear preface; altogether three prefaces. The front preface begins from the Tao words of old when reciting the scripture facing the utmost east; the middle preface begins after the Song Chapter of the Three Realms; these two chapters both are utmost clear utmost words. The rear preface begins from these heavens within to the Great Measure Profound Profound. The scripture has two chapters, from Primordial Cavernous Profundity to the enumerated words of Highest Clarity; and the later chapter from Primordial Cavern Jade Calendar to the end involving disaster and the Seven Ancestors. Its Great Brahma secret language is not counted among the two chapters; some take the scripture as a chapter and the secret as two chapters—this is also mistaken. The middle preface says: recite the scripture ten thousand times, then one can attain the Tao. The utmost clear utmost words, this is the secret language profound and deep, not included among the two textual chapters, as is known. The reader and reciter should have faith in the heart without doubt; when功 is complete and the Tao perfect, one will naturally understand, men and heaven sharing blessings, preservation and demise imbued with grace; how can one not be mindful? How can one not be diligent? Records of spiritual efficacy of the Profound Gate, collections of Daoist efficacy, holding this scripture obtains efficacy records, all have transmitted and preserved; true practitioners should diligently carry it out.
