# The Supreme Cavern Profound Spirit Treasure Boundless Salvation of Men, Superior Grade Scripture and Method

Scripture Name: The Supreme Cavern Profound Spirit Treasure Boundless Salvation of Men, Superior Grade Scripture and Method. Collected Annotations by Chen Chunrong of the Southern Song. Five Scrolls. Source Edition: The Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Tradition, Cavern of Truth Division, Jade Secrets Category.

Careful Note on the Spirit Treasure Scripture and Method: There are nine grades of yin merit, as well as the dispelling and removal of calamities, and prayers for blessings for oneself, deeds to rescue from calamity, and preservation of the person. The Primordial Heavenly Honoured One sits in emptiness floating above the five-coloured lion, dwelling in the sunlight. He is father and mother of heaven and earth, king of the realm and heavenly phenomena; one may recite these words with the spirit. For the upper dantian, recite with the spirit four thousand times. For calamities and others, one may recite with the heart. For the middle dantian, recite with the heart three thousand times. For all departed and lost spirits, one may recite with the qi. For the lower dantian, recite with the qi three thousand times. Each time of holding in thought must attain ten recitations. Ten recitations constitute one cycle; one hundred recitations make ten cycles. Every ten words one knocks the teeth to summon the spirit; every hundred words one swallows saliva to harmonize the qi. If a single word is incorrect, return thirty words prior and recite them; if a word is omitted or added, repeat fifty words prior and recite them anew. When reciting, lower the voice; when chanting, sing aloud and clearly with chant-tones, making the sound and phrases complete, not hastening for the sake of tally. Always cause the spirit and soul to be joyful and clear, with incense and qi continuous and uninterrupted within the room. If the voice and tone are ornate and beautiful but hurried to pursue the number of recitations, there will be no spiritual response; reciting the scripture with an empty corpse, wishing to fly away or sink, is not only without benefit but also invites the error of light recitation.

The Jade Table Immortal Descends to Write

Before confusion and chaos were resolved, there dwelt within the unity of the spirit; the great mass was divided, embracing within the treasure of three births. Scattered it became qi; gathered it formed text; permeating the void of the cavern, weaving through the surface of the mysterious profound. The primordial strand flows and unfolds, establishing the essence-root of heaven and earth; myriad models expand, spreading the blood veins of yin and yang. The five writings universally planted, the three luminaries equally bright, opening the thirty-two layers of heaven, binding countless paths of qi, thereby preserving and mastering the cycles of kalpa, assisting and supporting the august plan. It is the secret of returning life and raising the dead, the essential subtlety for entering sagehood and transcending the mundane. It unfolds the Three Caverns, all speaking of creation; teaching one realm, all reaching non-action. The spirit treasure is concealed within the field of the body; millet pearls are received into the nature’s ground. One thought raised leads into the great floating Li land; opening the multilayered tower, ascending the fragrant Xiao terrace. Always intimate with one’s own void sovereign, instantaneously awakening to the Primordial heart of mind. All myriad beings become immortal true spirits; myriad spirits all call themselves great saints of longevity.

Chapter of Initiating Movement

The Primordial Heavenly Honoured One

Note: The Primordial Heavenly Honoured One is the response title of the Void Sovereign. From the true origin of response, it is called Proof Cultivation, subtle thought from the hidden source, uniquely possessed by one’s own nature. The Cavern Spirit Scripture says: the subtle image is formless, response and perception have form, the true essence’s qi transforms and forms appearance.

When speaking of this scripture, circle ten times to summon the ten directions.

The Primordial Heavenly Honoured One is the master of Dao and Dharma; in this kalpa, he opens the plan and issues teaching, speaks the Dharma and transmits the scripture. First he circles to summon the ten directions’ heavenly perfected, then ascends the seat. The method says: the Primordial Heavenly Honoured One is the original self and primordial spirit, master of the one body.

Chapter of True Response

One should first approach the seat, from Zi to Wu text lifting.

The seat is the empty profound seat. It is said at the start one should approach the seat.

Heavenly perfected great spirits, Supreme Pure texts.

Primordial supreme truth, perfected of nine grades.

Imperial note: these come forth from the three realms, unbeholden to cultivation, without rank or karma, highest perfected.

Supreme holy and high respect, Jade Pure text.

Middle primordial holy respect, perfected of nine grades.

Imperial note: these have cultivation and proof, rank and karma, highest holy.

Wondrous Conduct Real Person, Supreme Clear text.

Lower primordial immortal perfected, perfected of nine grades.

Imperial note: these are the perfected who make primordial primordial, all within the Jade Pure realm, beyond the three realms of heaven. These three titles of heavenly perfected, compared to the one body, belong to the upper section of the eight scenic spirit qi.

Countless hosts, riding the void to come, flying clouds and cinnabar heavens, green chariots and jade wheels, feathered canopies shading, flowing essence and jade light. Hai text.

Flowing essence jade light is the image of the nine-coloured sphere. Also called sun and moon qi, spirit treasures of heaven. Can be gathered and refined, to nourish and become true.

Five-coloured luxuriant You text,

Cavern shining the great void.

Chapter of Fixed Extremes, fixed observation method. Great cavern realm.

Seven days and seven nights, various heavens, sun, moon, stars, constellations, jade balance, momentarily stopping the wheels.

The Profound Master says: Since it is said the sun and moon stop their wheels, how then is the count of seven days and seven nights divided? It is the subtle application and spirit power of the heavenly honoured, the transformation mechanism and response caused thereby. This subtle holy response is the heavenly honoured’s external transformation: the sun and moon do not move, stars do not traverse, the jade balance and the jade scale momentarily stop their wheels, and day and night are not manifest. In truth, the internal movement of the governing function never pauses. Thus the Jade Morning brightens the count of seven days and nights, which is not the human-world seven days and nights. In inner speech, great fixed spirit light, clearly seen in the Jade Pure realm, has the power of seven days and seven nights. The sun and moon stop their wheels; the eyes do not blink. This is neither the blind eye nor inner sight nor front sight; it is the long gaze of seven days and nights, stopping the eye’s blinking, illuminating the three parts, inside and outside fully clear. The qi and blood of the one body circulate through the hundred joints and meridians, yin and yang guarding and defending, all connected with the three parts of pulse and breath. The breath is the person’s one body jade balance and jade scale. The four reaches are the jade balance, the three parts the jade scale; as the jade balance does not move, the sun and moon fix their scenes, the stars stop their wheels. The four reaches do not arrive, the three parts do not breathe, the qi and blood of the one body do not circulate.

Imperial note: still and peaceful, united with the spirit qi.

Four stars are the jade balance, three stars are the jade scale.

Diagram of the Jade Balance and Jade Scale

One breath and one inhalation are the four reaches, altogether six cun. One breath two reaches, one inhalation two reaches, each three cun. One reach is fifteen fen; the meridians and latitudes of heaven and earth, vertical and horizontal fifteen, thus the Emperor entrusted the Yellow Emperor the River Map.

The Spirit Treasure Inner Image Pillal Text says: The qi of a person going back and forth is the breath. When a person breathes one breath and one inhalation, it is one pulse. Within one pulse, yin and yang divide; breathing out is brightness, yang, day; inhaling is obscurity, yin, night. The seven orifices breathe, seven days; the seven orifices inhale, seven nights. The heavenly mechanism does not move, the spirit focuses the eyes, the pulse fixes the heart; thus the seven days and nights, the sun, moon, stars, constellation, jade balance and jade scale momentarily stop their wheels.

The spirit wind is silent,

No blowing breath enters or leaves.

Mountains and seas conceal clouds, Zi text.

No obscuring bright delusive thoughts.

Heaven without floating shadow,

Clear and tranquil.

Four black bright and clear. Mao text.

Naturally warm, cool, cold, hot.

One realm’s earth,

Is like one body.

Mountains, rivers, forests, and trees,

Are like four limbs, a hundred vessels, hair, pores and orifices, defence and bones.

Level and equal, no longer high or low. All the earth becomes green jade, without differing hues.

One enters the realm of fixed Dao, serene and clear nature, inside and outside the one body all like green jade, without one speck of dust.

The Profound Master says: Fixing observation for seven days, not knowing day or night, observing the mind without mind, this is the mind of true origin; observing the form without form, this is the original true form of cognition. Mind and form both absent, entering the path of formlessness, this is great fixity; spirit light clear and bright, seeing the Jade Pure realm, having the power of seven days and seven nights.

The multitude of perfected attend the seat. Jade Pure text.

The heavenly honoured by great method summons, the ten directions’ heavenly perfected all assemble in response, as if gathering the sea of spirit qi and storing breath in the dantian; then thirty-six thousand spirit officials attend on every side.

Chapter of Returning to Origin

The Primordial Heavenly Honoured One sits in mystery floating above the five-coloured lion, Wu text.

The Profound Master says: The heavenly honoured floats in emptiness, which is the self’s primordial spirit residing in the Jade Pure palace. The mystery seat is the seat of the Dharma body. The lion is the awe-inspiring spirit of the Primordial. These five qi bow to the crimson palace; the wondrous formation of spirit joins to form the lion; the heavenly honoured rides it to descend into the dantian, left blue, right white, front red, rear black, middle yellow; thus there is the image of the five-coloured lion, forming the five elements.

After reciting the scripture once, the mighty saints of the heavens simultaneously affirm it well. At this time a realm’s men and women deaf and ill, their ears all opened and clear.

Heaven one produces water, it is the qi of Kan conceived in Qian metal. The saints of the heavens simultaneously affirm it well; myriad spirits all at once rejoice. The realm’s men and women is the Dharma body’s yin and yang two qi. Deafness is of Kan, which is the ear, thus it is assigned. The Profound Master says: In the ultimate Dao, the term deaf means not knowing true illness beyond sound; to not hear sound, even great hearing is deaf.

Imperial note: What is deaf? It is because the ear does not receive the virtue of goodness. When one hears the heavenly honoured speak the Dharma, then the heavenly ear opens and is clear, the Dharma sound flows and resounds, fully unobstructed. The rest agree with this statement.

After two recitations, the blind regain sight.

Earth two produces fire, it is the qi of Li conceived in Xun wood. Li is the eye, the eye corresponds to the heart; when the heart is darkened by things, it is blind. Following the Dao, the heart opens and the mind is enlightened, no thing can cloud it.

After three recitations, the mute can speak.

Heaven three produces wood, it is the qi of Zhen conceived in Gen water. Gen is the mountain; the mountain is high and the earth thick, springs issue therefrom.

After four recitations, the lame, the sick, and the accumulated afflicted all can rise and walk.

Earth four produces metal, it is the qi of Dui conceived in Kun earth. To rise and walk is the form of standing; the nature of wood is present.

After five recitations, long-standing illnesses and chronic disorders instantly recover form.

Heaven five produces earth, it is the Li that bears the Wu and the earth qi conceived in Li.

After six recitations, white hair returns to black, fallen teeth regenerate.

Heaven one produces water, completed by earth six.

After seven recitations, old persons return to youth, young persons all become strong.

Earth two produces fire, completed by heaven seven.

After eight recitations, women conceive, birds and beasts bear embryos; those born and unborn all obtain generation.

Heaven three produces wood, completed by earth eight. Returning east to the place of Zhen as sand, it is the union of Gen and Zhen, and wood is formed in water. Sand is mercury responding to lead qi and solidifying.

After nine recitations, the earth store releases, metal and jade reveal form.

Earth four produces metal, completed by heaven nine. Returning west to the Dui direction is metal; it is the union of Kun and Dui, and metal is formed in earth, for mercury returns to the earth cauldron and becomes treasure.

After ten recitations, withered bones regenerate, all rise to maturity. At this time, all in the realm, men and women, without exception incline their hearts and all receive protection and salvation, all obtain longevity.

Heaven five produces earth, completed by earth ten.

The Profound Master says: The heavenly honoured reciting the scripture ten times is the way of the five elements generating; first the five elements giving birth count, then the five elements completing count, the ten revolutions returning spirit method. To understand the way is longevity; to use the way is to prove these ten auspicious great accomplishments.

Chapter of Repeated Profundity

The Way says: At this time the Primordial Heavenly Honoured One

Reiterates the heavenly honoured circling reciting scripture to summon the ten directions, emphasizing the order of their directions.

First recitation of the scripture is Zhen text, the Eastern limitless boundless grade supreme perfected multitude, floating to arrive.

Tai’an Hall, Village of Receiving Goodness World.

Tenth recitation, Chen above Si below, Lower limitless boundless grade supreme great perfected multitude, floating to arrive.

Cavern Abyss Nine Fortifications, Correct Progression Touring Brahman Four Sounds, Thirty-Six Palaces, Earth Officials’ Offices, Northern Feng Palaces.

Ten cycles completed, the ten directions' limitless heavenly perfected great spirits all arrive simultaneously. The realm’s men and women incline their hearts and venerate; those arriving are like fine rain and dense mist; the countless multitudes, half the realm, the earth all partly sunken, not to be restrained. Thus the Primordial suspends a precious pearl, hands both lifted in Jade Pure text. As large as millet grain, suspended in the void profound, five zhang above the earth.

The Profound Master says: The heavenly honoured bestows the mysterious great transformation, suspending a precious pearl in the void profound, the knot of its suspension unknown. Millet grain is the fragrance of five grains’ essence. Five zhang above the earth means removed from the five desires, five dusts, five aggregates, five colours, five fragrances, five sounds, departing the five turbid worlds, outside the five element counts, thus able to enter the mystery of the void profound.

Annotation by Xue Youqi: The precious pearl symbolizes the Dao, also the same as the meaning of the mysterious pearl. Millet grain is the chief of five grains, the source of living beings; it means that receiving the scripture is like gaining the very sustenance of life. Once the five impurities are left, there is no more multitudinous breath; once the five elements are not used, one forever departs mutual harm. Naturally one attains long life and long vision, obtains the Dao and becomes true.

The Primordial ascends leading heavenly perfected great spirits, supreme holy respect, wondrous conduct real person, ten directions limitless supreme perfected great spirits, countless multitudes, all enter the precious pearl. The heavenly beings gaze upward, seeing only the vigorous entering the pearl’s mouth; once inside the pearl’s mouth, their whereabouts are unknown.

The heavenly perfected, supreme holy respect, wondrous conduct supreme truth, their qi merges with the Way’s subtlety, their essence merges with the Way’s truth; therefore able to follow the heavenly honoured to ascend and enter the void profound millet pearl. The heavenly being’s body not yet perfect truth cannot enter together, only gazing upward. Moreover lower rank lesser immortals have the wonderful subtlety of a mustard seed containing Mount Sumeru, suspending the pot of heaven and earth; how much more the great saintly heavenly honoured, who promulgates the great teaching, manifests divine transformations. Speaking in the ultimate Dao, one realm is likened to one body; the sunken and tilted earth indicates the Dao’s tilt and tilt, not fully one body, hard to call the mystery of profound repetition. The heavenly beings are myriad spirits. The heavenly perfected great spirits, supreme holy respect, wondrous conduct real persons are the three primordial spirits. The heavenly honoured is the self primordial spirit, master of the one body. In inner scene subtle Dao speech, it is the Jade Pure precious pearl immortal embryo transformation method.

The realm’s people disperse broadly, the earth returns to level and right, no longer tilted or sunken. The Primordial then within the precious pearl recites the scripture to completion, the perfected overseeing the salvation confer it upon me.

The Primordial recites the scripture within the precious pearl, all saints enter. At this time only the Dao Lord is saved; the Dao Lord receives this scripture; hence it is said conferred upon me. I am the Dao Lord’s self appellation.

At this time joy and celebration are inexpressible. The ritual matters roughly complete, all heavens return to their places. In a moment, quiet without lingering sound. At this time the heavenly beings encounter the scripture and method, universally obtaining salvation, fulfilling their original years without harm. The sunken earth returns to veneration, all practice good mind. No killing or harming,

Removing body karma sins.

No envy or jealousy,

Removing heart karma sins.

No lechery or theft,

Removing body karma sins.

No greed or desire,

Removing heart karma sins.

No hatred or revulsion. Meaning no ornate speech, no evil voices.

Again removing heart karma sins. These twelve great precepts must be received and held by all who cultivate and recite this scripture.

Unified in compassion and love, different bones become kin, realm peaceful and people abundant, rejoicing in happiness and great peace.

Chapter of Expounding Brahman

When the scripture first issues teaching, one realm embracing the Dao, with utmost sincerity, respecting ritual and veneration, all obtain worldly salvation. Hands both lifted in Jade Pure text here release.

Declaration of Secret Chapter

The Way says: All those spoken of within the Primordial Heavenly Honoured’s recitation are various heavens’ supreme lords. Their inner name is the hidden rhyme sound, also the secret name of demon kings, the hundred spirits’ hidden name, not common worldly words.

Chapter of Supreme Holiness

The supreme holy is complete,

The supreme holy merges with the Dao’s subtlety, merits and virtues completed.

The true person penetrates the profound and subtle, able to understand its chapters, reciting them ten times.

Ten recitations make one cycle, one hundred make ten cycles; reciting the scripture should follow the law of ten cycles.

The heavens sing from afar, myriad emperors set rites, rivers and seas silent, mountains and peaks hiding clouds.

No inhalation or exhalation.

The sun and moon stop their scenes,

Eyes do not blink.

The jade balance does not move,

Pulse does not breathe. This is also the great fixity method.

The demons bind forms, ghost spirits perish. Jade Pure text.

The Profound Master says: Within the six caves of Fengdu, inside and outside twelve palaces, the demon kings are demons, also called hordes of demons. These demons ruin men’s good nature, attach to men’s evil deeds, disturb those who study, worldly beasts and birds, five elements’ refined beings, transformed into ghosts and demons. These factions differ in form and species, their spirits like men. Also there are outside path demons and spirits and tormenting ghosts, transforming into heavenly honoured spirits and true persons, confusing good men and Daoists. Read carefully and do not lose your way, lest you fall into this stream.

Returning the corpse and raising the dead, white bones become men.

The Profound Master says: The true person can penetrate the profound and subtle, understand the great cavern secret within the scripture, obtain ten grades of responsive merit; this is the true person’s rank.

Chapter of Supreme Learning

The supreme learning person,

Heart firm as metal and stone, conduct fierce as water and fire, heaven and earth cannot surpass, ghosts and spirits cannot confuse, conduct beyond what men can do, seeming to have and yet not have, these are those named immortals below the supreme ultimate.

Reciting ten cycles, then five emperors attend guard, three realms bow, demon spirits lose their eyes, ghosts and monsters perish. Jade Pure text. Salvation of those near death, severance and obtaining life.

The Profound Master says: The supreme scholar reciting thus obtains six grades of merit.

Why so? Because the scholar’s impure qi is not yet eliminated, the body not yet fully true, summoning and commanding the ten directions’ Jade Pure texts, power yet not commanding heavenly governance.

Heavenly governance means the sun, moon, five planets, and seven heavenly officers.

Virtue can subdue and control earth gods, bind and suppress demons, Jade Pure text. But only the dead are turned away; rebirth is not obtained.

The scholar’s bone and body not true, impure qi remains, cannot command heavenly phenomena, only obtains three grades of merit; this is the supreme scholar’s rank.

Chapter of Encouragement to the Dao

Lightly reciting this chapter, the body suffers calamity.

Without fasting, cleansing, bathing, carrying incense and reciting, one obtains the guilt of calamity.

Offering respectful worship, the doorway prospers, generations flourish, with good cause and affinity, myriad disasters do not touch, spirits protect the door. Jade Pure text.

Offering respectful worship obtains five grades of good fruits.

Chapter of Praising the Profound

This scripture is exalted and wondrous, unrivalled in the Jade Capital, boundless salvation of men, the source of myriad ways, majestic great model, virtue hard to excel.

Chapter of Cultivating Recitation

The Way says: Whoever recites this scripture ten times,

All reciters, regardless of high or low rank, who can recite carefully and hold to ten cycles.

The heavens all assemble, myriad ancestors countless, suffering spirits and tormenting ghosts all instantly receive salvation, ascend to the vermilion palace, each attaining nine years.

Three Primordial grades and precepts, the vermilion hill’s rank of salvation of men, has five levels. Nine years is the middle blessing rank. Great blessing is three years; small blessing twenty-four years.

Receiving transformation and rebirth, becoming noble persons. And those who love to learn the supreme scripture, when功滿德就, all become spirits and immortals, fly ascending to the golden palace, feast in the Jade Capital.

The Profound Master says: Masters who receive the scripture but do not cultivate or hold it, only reciting ten cycles, achieve this mysterious response. This speaks of one’s own功德果報, saving myriad ancestors and tormenting ghosts ascending the vermilion officialdom, in accordance with vermilion hill rank, nine years receiving transformation and rebirth becoming noble persons. If one’s past spirit is clear, not losing its root, and able to love learning the supreme scripture, one’s own功德 full to the days, flies ascending to Supreme Clear heaven, feasting in the great Luo Jade Capital. This is the rank of those who recite ten cycles.

Chapter of Upper Learning

The upper learning person,

Hearing the way moves to action, seeing the secret learning of the Dharma, never abandoning from beginning to end, cold and heat not failing, these are those named immortals below the Supreme Clear’s nine palaces.

Cultivating and reciting this scripture,

Cultivating the way within, reciting the scripture without.

All receive salvation, fly ascending to the southern palace.

The Profound Master says: The upper learning person cultivates and recites, but cannot save myriad ancestors, only obtains self salvation; this is the rank of the upper person.

Common People Reciting

Common people are those of the usual path, not men of distinction.

They prolong life and years, later all obtain the method of corpse liberation. The soul and spirit temporarily extinguished, without entering hell, immediately regaining form, roaming the great void.

Going to the master to receive scripture and recite, only obtains prolonged life and corpse liberation; this is the common people’s rank. From true to this, there are five ranks; thus the grades differ.

Chapter of Subtle Delight

This scripture is subtle and wondrous, universally saving without end, all heavenly beings do not fail to receive blessing, boundless blessings, life and death receive grace.

Chapter of Oath of Effectiveness

Treasured from on high, not transmitted below, the supreme person bears the golden treasure, pledges mind and swears to heaven then transmits. Lightly revealing or carelessly neglecting, calamity touches nine ancestors, long servitude to ghost officials.

Previously light recitation harms the body; later light leakage harms nine ancestors. The Profound Master says: If lightly divulging, carelessly neglecting the mysterious methods, falsely divulging not human, not abiding by time limits and privately transmitting, or abiding by time limits but not fasting, or receiving oaths but leaking secret prohibitions, causing light negligence and disbelief in the mysterious text, all enter the middle penalty. Calamity touches nine ancestors, long servitude to ghost officials, the underworld officials who command ghosts. The Five Mountains sweep the mountains, Fengdu commands servants, rivers and mountains alternate governance, these are the ghost officials’ tasks. Also there are those driving thunder and lightning, heavenly officials’ servants; carrying sand and bearing stones, earth officials’ servants; stirring waves and drawing depths, water officials’ servants; these three officials’ followers.

Chapter of Mysterious Bureau

Attending scripture are the Five Emperors, Jade Boys and Jade Girls twenty-four persons,

Red Apricot, Zhen text. Ink Black, Kan text. Ground Truth, Dui text. Wax and Wax, Li text. Spirit Treasure. The central text manipulates and fixes, drawing five directions’ qi blowing.

Defence and guard divine texts, protecting the bodies of those receiving the scripture. The central text expels secrets.

Eastern nine qi blue spirit opening way boy, blue spirit jade girl; southern three qi cinnabar spirit opening way boy, cinnabar spirit jade girl; western seven qi bright spirit opening way boy, bright spirit jade girl; northern five qi profound spirit opening way boy, profound spirit jade girl; central one qi yellow spirit opening way boy, yellow spirit jade girl, each twenty-four persons. These five directions’ five old emperors each dispatch jade boys and jade girls, totaling two hundred and forty persons, attending guard and protection.

The Profound Master says: These are the gods of the five elements, four seasons, nine officers, twenty-four qi, all residing within the body.

Chapter of Three Primordial

The Way says: In the first month long fast,

Fast means the body has no miscellaneous burdens, the heart does not wander outside, inside and outside are clear and empty, embracing the origin and guarding unity, completing this month; thus called long fast.

Recite and chant this scripture,

Recite with lowered voice, chant aloud with chant tone.

For the upper world’s departed souls, severing earthly servitude, rescuing to the upper southern palace.

The Profound Master says: The first month is when the Upper Primordial Heavenly Official meets the Earth and Water two officials at the Upper Primordial Purple Tenuity Palace, examining all merits and faults, called the meeting for merit and promotion month; suitable for rescuing ancestors and departed souls, severing the bonds of the three followers.

In the seventh month long fast, recite and chant this scripture, the body obtains immortality, the heavens record names, yellow registers and white slips, deleting death and ascending life.

The seventh month is when the Middle Primordial Earth Official meets the Heaven and Water two officials at the Middle Primordial Yang Terrace Palace, examining merits and faults, called the celebration birth middle meeting month; suitable for rescuing oneself, the heavens recording names, thereby obtaining immortality. The yellow register is the heaven’s golden register. The white slip is the register of the dead. Called the golden register for ascending life, the white slip deletes the death character.

In the tenth month long fast, recite and chant this scripture, for the king and emperor, lord and minister, father and son, to secure and settle the realm’s fortune, to preserve heaven’s permanence, unbroken through generations, always for the sovereign to keep his place, and the people to call it great peace.

The tenth month is when the Lower Primordial Water Official meets the Earth and Heaven two officials, the various heavens and earths, various water true saints and immortals, star and constellation palace bureaus, ghost and spirit lords, universally examining all merits and faults, good and evil, at the eastern extremity of heaven’s tail gate, the source of leaked water at the clear and cool mansion. Called the universal examination and establishment birth great meeting month; suitable for national prayers for peace, emperor’s sacred fortune, and by law securing the place afflicted by disaster, so the people call it great peace. The method also says: The first month belongs to Yin, Yin is the ghost path; thus it rescues the ancestors.

According to the Mind Holding Formula: Water begins to be born, fire grows at Yin, water and fire both complete, refining and saving dead souls, jade eyes refining essence, yellow blossoms cleansing form. The seventh month belongs to Shen, Shen is the human gate; thus one rescues oneself.

According to the Mind Holding Formula: The completion number of fire, water and earth grow in Shen. This is the completion number, therefore obtains salvation. The tenth month belongs to Hai, Hai is the heavenly gate; thus above is the emperor’s securing and settling the realm’s fortune, below is minister and commoner protecting peace.

According to the Mind Holding Formula: The completion number of earth, the growth of wood in Hai, wood is the ancestral qi, therefore is father and son. The completion number of earth, therefore is emperor and realm lord.

On
