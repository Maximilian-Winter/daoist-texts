# The Sublime Scripture of Limitless Salvation of the Spirit Treasure

The Supreme Wondrous Scripture of Limitless Salvation of the Primordial Beginning

The Way speaks:

In former times, amidst the Primordial Azure Heaven, at the Blue Firmament’s silent song, upon the great floating Land of Multitudes, receiving the salvation of the Primordial Beginning, the Limitless Supreme Grade, the Primordial Heavenly Venerable was about to expound this Scripture. Having circled ten times, to summon the ten directions, they first approached the seat. The Celestial Beings of Heaven, great spirits, the Highest Sages, exalted and venerable, the Marvelous-Walking Perfected, unnumbered hosts, came riding the void. They flew on clouds of cinnabar and vermilion, in green chariots and jade wheels, with feathered canopies spreading shade. Streams of essence and jade radiance flowed, the five colours luxuriantly vigorous, brilliantly illuminating the vast firmament. Seven days and seven nights. The heavens’ sun and moon, the constellation stars, the pivot of the celestial sphere, the jade balance stood still; the divine winds were silent and tranquil; mountains and seas concealed clouds; the heavens were without floating obscurations; the four airs were bright and clear. One realm of earth and soil, mountains, rivers, forests, and trees, all levelled to one rank, with no more high or low; the soil was all fashioned of jade, with no differing hues. The multitude of perfect beings attended the seat; the Primordial Heavenly Venerable’s suspended seat floated upon the five-coloured lion.

After speaking the Scripture once, the great saints of the heavens simultaneously praised it; at that time, all the deaf and ill of one realm, their ears were opened and keen.

After speaking the Scripture twice, the blind were given sight.

After speaking the Scripture thrice, the mute were enabled to speak.

After speaking the Scripture four times, the lame and afflicted who were bound and imprisoned all rose and walked.

After speaking the Scripture five times, the chronically ill and incurable, all at once recovered their forms.

After speaking the Scripture six times, white hair turned black, fallen teeth grew anew.

After speaking the Scripture seven times, the aged were restored to youth, and the young were all strengthened.

After speaking the Scripture eight times, women conceived; birds and beasts bore within them; both those born and unborn obtained formation.

After speaking the Scripture nine times, the earth’s hidden treasures were revealed, gold and jade appeared in form.

After speaking the Scripture ten times, withered bones were restored to life, all rising as men.

At that time, all men and women of that realm, with hearts bent in reverence, received protection and salvation, all attaining longevity.

The Way speaks:

At that time, the Primordial Heavenly Venerable,

Having spoken the Scripture once, from the east there came the Limitless Supreme Grade Most True Great Spirits, unnumbered hosts floating in the air.

Having spoken the Scripture twice, from the south came the Limitless Supreme Grade Most True Great Spirits, unnumbered hosts floating in the air.

Having spoken the Scripture thrice, from the west came the Limitless Supreme Grade Most True Great Spirits, unnumbered hosts floating in the air.

Having spoken the Scripture four times, from the north came the Limitless Supreme Grade Most True Great Spirits, unnumbered hosts floating in the air.

Having spoken the Scripture five times, from the northeast came the Limitless Supreme Grade Most True Great Spirits, unnumbered hosts floating in the air.

Having spoken the Scripture six times, from the southeast came the Limitless Supreme Grade Most True Great Spirits, unnumbered hosts floating in the air.

Having spoken the Scripture seven times, from the southwest came the Limitless Supreme Grade Most True Great Spirits, unnumbered hosts floating in the air.

Having spoken the Scripture eight times, from the northwest came the Limitless Supreme Grade Most True Great Spirits, unnumbered hosts floating in the air.

Having spoken the Scripture nine times, from above came the Limitless Supreme Grade Most True Great Spirits, unnumbered hosts floating in the air.

Having spoken the Scripture ten times, from below came the Limitless Supreme Grade Most True Great Spirits, unnumbered hosts floating in the air.

Having completed the tenfold circuit, the Limitless Celestial Beings of the ten directions simultaneously arrived.

The men and women of one realm, bent in heart and reverence, came as fine rain and dense mist. Unnumbered hosts occupied half the realm; the earth was all sunken and uneven, not to be restrained. Then the Primordial Venerable suspended a precious pearl, as large as a millet grain, in the mysterious void, five zhang above the earth. Primordial ascended, leading the Celestial Beings of Heaven, Highest Sages, Marvelous-Walking Perfected, the Limitless Supreme Grade Most True Great Spirits of the ten directions, and unnumbered hosts, all entering the precious pearl. The heavenly beings looked up, seeing only a vigorous flow entering the pearl's mouth; once inside, the place was unknown. The people dispersed widely; the land became level and even, no longer sunken. Within the pearl, the Primordial Venerable spoke the Scripture to completion; the perfect beings supervised the salvation and delivered it to me. At that time, joy and celebration were beyond words; the ritual affairs were roughly accomplished; the heavens returned to their places; in a moment, silence remained without echo. At that time, the heavenly beings, encountering the Scripture’s law, universally attained salvation. Their original years were complete, without harm; the whole land bent in reverence, all practising benevolence, not killing nor harming, not envying nor resenting, not lewd nor stealing, not greedy nor desirous, not hateful nor severing; their words were not ornate, their mouths without evil sounds; equally compassionate and loving, strange kinship made kin; the realm was peaceful and the people prosperous; joy and great peace prevailed.

When the Scripture first emerged, it taught one realm in the Way; those with aspiring hearts and sincere devotion, revering rites and respect, all attained to saving the world.

The Way speaks:

The Primordial Heavenly Venerable, within the words of the Scripture, are the inner names and hidden tones of the Celestial Emperors, also the secret taboo names of the Demon Kings and the hundred spirits; they are not common words of the world. The Highest Sage having become Perfected, comprehending the mysterious and penetrating to the subtle, is able fully to understand its passages.

Reciting it ten times, the heavens sing from afar; myriad emperors arrange rites; rivers and seas are silent; mountains swallow clouds; sun and moon suspend their light; the celestial sphere does not move; demons are restrained; ghostly spirits are extinguished; corpses return to life; white bones become men.

The diligent scholar, reciting it ten times, has the five emperors as guards, the three realms bow in homage, demon spirits lose their sight, ghostly elves are extinguished, salvation descends to the dying; death is cut off and life attained.

Because of this, the scholar whose defilements are not yet dispersed, whose body has not yet penetrated the true, summons the ten directions and restrains without governing the heavens; his moral conduct may subdue the earth spirits and bind the demon spirits, but still death cannot be changed. If he recites lightly this passage, his body will suffer harm; but if he offers respect and reverence, his gates will flourish; generations prosper, linked to good causes; ten thousand calamities do not touch him; the spirits guard his gates. This Scripture is revered and wondrous, unique in the Jade Capital, saving limitless persons, the source of myriad ways, majestic and great Brahma, whose virtue is hard to surpass.

The Way speaks:

Whoever recites this Scripture ten times, the heavens all arrive; countless ancestors and spirits of suffering and pain all immediately receive salvation, ascending to the Vermilion Palace. Their term is nine years; receiving transformation and rebirth, they become noble persons. Those who delight in studying the Scripture, when their merit is full and virtue complete, all become immortals, flying up to the Golden Pavilion, roaming and feasting in the Jade Capital. Those of higher learning who cultivate and recite this Scripture all immediately receive salvation, soaring to the Southern Palace. The common people who recite it extend their lives and years; later they all attain the way of corpse liberation, their soul and spirit temporarily extinguished, without passing through hells, immediately regaining form and roaming the vast void. This Scripture is subtle and wondrous, universally saving without end; all the celestial beings receive blessings; boundless fortune, life and death receiving favour, treasured by the heavens, not transmitted to later ages; only the highest scholars in their halls of gold transmit it with sincere hearts sworn to heaven. If lightly revealed or carelessly neglected, disasters fall upon nine ancestors, long conscription to ghostly officials.

Attending the Scripture are the five emperors, jade boys and jade maidens, each twenty-four in number, arranging and guarding the divine script, protecting the bodies of those receiving the Scripture.

The Way speaks:

In the first month, a long fast is held, reciting this Scripture, for the departed souls of former generations, severing the earth’s bonds, ascending to the Southern Palace. In the seventh month, a long fast is held, reciting this Scripture, the body receives immortality; the heavens record the names; yellow registers and white slips delete death and promote life. In the tenth month, a long fast is held, reciting this Scripture, for kings and emperors, rulers, ministers, and fathers and sons; securing and stabilizing the realm’s destiny; preserving heaven’s enduring existence; generations unbroken; always rulers over men; calming and securing their regions; the people acclaim great peace. On the eight festival days, reciting this Scripture, one attains the Nine Palaces’ Perfected. On the day of one’s destiny, reciting this Scripture, the soul and spirit become pure and upright, the myriad airs endure; without passing through suffering and vexation, the body has brightness. The three realms’ attendants, the five emperors’ commanders, myriad gods bow in homage, their names written in heaven; when merit is full and virtue complete, they ascend to the Supreme Clarity.

The Way speaks:

On the day of practicing the Way, one should bathe with fragrant water, fast and enter the chamber, facing east, knocking the teeth thirty-two times to communicate with the Thirty-two Heavens; with heart bowing thirty-two times, closing eyes and contemplating: sitting amidst the blue, yellow, and white clouds of qi, within and without deep mystery; there are the Azure Dragon and White Tiger, Vermilion Bird and Black Tortoise, Lion and White Crane, arrayed on right and left; the sun and moon shine brightly, illuminating the chamber; a round image grows at the nape of the neck, its radiance shining in all directions, thus clear and manifest.

The secret mantra is: Supreme Mysterious Origin, Most High Dao Lord, summon from within my body the three and five functionaries, the left and right officers, attendant fragrant jade boys, communicators jade maidens, the Five Emperors bearing talismans, the incense officials of the day, each thirty-two persons; open and ward off what is spoken; today is auspicious and joyful; long fast in the pure hall; cultivating and practicing the supreme Scripture; limitless salvation of persons; may what is invoked ascend fully, directly approaching the Supreme Thirty-two Heavens Primordial Beginning Highest Emperor, Supreme One.

Having ended, draw qi thirty-two times and recite the Scripture facing east.

First, the Desire Realm Flying Void Sound

The human way is vast and distant. The immortal way vast and wild. The ghostly way delightful. When man is born, the immortal way esteems life. The ghostly way esteems ending.

The immortal way is always auspicious. The ghostly way is always inauspicious. Supreme Supreme Clarity spiritual briskness. Sorrowful song bright in great void.

Only wishing the immortal way to be accomplished; not wishing the human way to be impoverished.

Northern Capital Spring Stream Mansion. Within are myriad ghostly hosts. Only wishing to restrain human counting; cutting off human life gates.

Ah Man’s Song of the Cave Chapter. To take captive Northern Luo Feng; binding and reciting demon spirits; cutting off six ghostly edges.

The heavens all wide and vast. Our way daily flourishing.

Second, the Form Realm Demon King’s Sound Chapter

Lofty high and extended. Bright qi four directions. Brahma practices the heavens. Circling the ten directions. Limitless great gods. All from my body.

I have the cave chapter. Ten thousand times becoming immortal. The immortal way esteems salvation. The ghostly way interlinks. Heaven and earth vast and wild. Defilement thick and dense.

Three realms delightful. Passing beyond long enduring. Body saved from my realm. Form entering natural. This moment delightful. All by my grace.

Dragon Han vast. How can there be separate truth? My realm is hard to save. Therefore composing cave script. Transforming flying void. To test your body.

Success and failure slack and retreat. How many are saved? Laughing at your not being saved. Therefore a song leader.

Third, the Form Realm Demon King’s Song says:

Above the three realms. Vast great Luo. No colour root above. Clouds layers lofty. Only Primordial Beginning. Home of great kalpa.

Departments govern my realm. Commanding the Mysterious Capital. Passing beyond my realm. Deep entering Jade Void. My position supreme king. Upholding guards of demons.

Countless changes in the void. Defilement scattered blossoms. Few preserve truth. Many are confused. Immortal way hard to fix. Ghostly way easy to deviate.

Human way is heart. Surely not by others. Immortal way esteems reality. Human way esteems appearance.

You do not delight in immortal way. How can the three realms pass? Its desire turns five paths. What shall I do again?

Above the three realms, in the flying void, the demon king’s song and sound, the sound joins cave chapters. Recited one hundred times, named saved at Southern Palace; recited one thousand times, demon king guards and escorts; ten thousand times all ways complete; flying ascending in void; crossing and saving the three realms; position ascending to immortal duke; hearing the spiritual sound; demon king revering form; commanding earth spirits; attendants guarding and escorting; pulling open the earth gates; the five sufferings and eight hardships; seven ancestors ascending and transforming; forever leaving ghostly officials; soul saved at Vermilion Tomb; undergoing refinement and rebirth; this is called boundless; universally saving without end.

There are secret scriptures of the upper heaven, universally revered by the heavens; careless and slow falling to hell; calamity reaching seven ancestors.

The Way speaks:

These two chapters are both the heavens’ emperors and spiritual demon kings’ secret sounds; all are words of great Brahma; not common words of the world; words without rhyme or splendour; tunes without ornament; therefore called profound and mysterious, hard to seek and examine. Treasured by the heavens, secret in the Mysterious Capital, the Purple Micro Upper Palace, relying on mysterious methods through forty thousand kalpas for transmission; if there be a perfect person who fasts with treasures of gold and jade, with heart remaining true to the pattern, informing and pledging the ten heavens, then afterwards it may be delivered.

The Way speaks:

The operation and destiny of heaven and earth likewise have their endings; the sun, moon, and five planets likewise wax and wane; the most holy divine men also have rest and decline; the humblest disciple likewise has sickness and injury. Whenever these calamities occur, the kindred qi all together should unite in fasting, six times burning incense, ten times turning the Scripture; blessings and virtue immediately descend; dispelling all misfortunes; limitless texts universally saving without end.

The Way speaks:

The humble disciple’s Way is shallow; perhaps the immortal grade is not yet full; the destiny is extinguishing and salvation; the body passes through the Great Yin; at the time of passing, fellow disciples and perfect persons come to burn incense and recite Scripture ten times, thus saving the corpse form in accord with the method; the soul and spirit ascend directly to the Southern Palace; according to their learning and merit, counted by days, they attain rebirth; revolving wheel not extinguished; thereby attaining immortality.

The Way speaks: The operation of heaven and earth ends, also one should fast and burn incense and recite Scripture; stars and constellations err in their course; sun and moon lose their dark and light; also one should fast and burn incense and recite Scripture; the four seasons lose their course; yin and yang not harmonizing; also one should fast and burn incense and recite Scripture; the ruler of the nation has calamity; wars and revolutions arise; also one should fast and burn incense and recite Scripture; epidemics and poisons spread; multitudes die and are injured; also one should fast and burn incense and recite Scripture; teachers and friends have passed away; also one should fast and burn incense and recite Scripture. Thus, abstinence, fasting, and Scripture recitation have very great merit; above dispelling heavenly calamities; preserving and stabilizing emperors and kings; below averting poisons and harms; saving the multitudes; relying on life and death; their blessings hard to surpass; therefore called limitless, universally saving heaven and men.

The Way speaks:

Whoever has this Scripture, can serve heaven and earth, emperors and kings and multitudes; practising this merit and virtue; on days of calamity, generate the vow to fast and burn incense, recite Scripture ten times; all recorded by the heavens; myriad gods attend and guard; right separates perfect persons; able to become sage lords and ministers of the Golden Pavilion. The heavens record the person’s merits and demerits; no slightest loss; the heaven’s demon king also recommends your person attaining the way; this is profound and clear supreme words.
