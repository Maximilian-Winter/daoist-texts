The Yellow Silk Chapter of the Lingbao Refining and Transcendence for the Five Immortals to Pacify Spirits and Guard Souls

The Most True Great Master, the Red Emperor of Lingbao and Dongxuan, the humble servant certain Jia bows and presents: To the Most High Supreme One Qi, One Qi, the Most High Supreme without Limit, without Crest, without Colour, without Light, Vast and True Great Way, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy; the Thirty-two Emperors, the Supreme Great Way Lord, Jade Majesty of the Highest Purity. The servant, receiving the Primordial Great Transformation, petitions that all the heavens open forgiveness for the dark prisons of hell, the three paths, the five sufferings, hungry ghosts, and the death-souls, that they all emerge from the long night into all brightness. When the imperial Way is thus perfected, the dead bodies return to man, the three realms become pure and solemn, and the earth palaces be at peace. I pray, through extinction and transcendence, to entrust the corpse to the Great Yin, to lodge the form with the Earth Official. My功 modest, virtue slight, for those not yet received, all are to be assigned the Female Azure Talisman’s mandate, to be governed according to their leaders, to be comforted and consoled, provided with guard and support, not to be disturbed, so as to be returned and entrusted to human birth.

The script in golden seals and jade texts is delivered to the Dark Harmony Jade Maiden, with the agreement that the present shall be new, reverently serving the great law, without deviation. Though heaven and earth’s great cycles proceed, the text remains clear.

Now, receiving the old canon of the Female Azure Upper Palace, declaring the holy Way, for certain disciples of clear faith from a certain district, county, and village, men and women named certain Jia, of such and such age, born under Bingwu, registered under the Red Emperor, receiving Qi in the seventh month, the Alchemy Heaven taking Yang. The prior功 incomplete, still dwelling in the defiled world, stained by dust and filth, thus to be extinguished and transcended. Entrusted to Great Yin, lodged with the Earth Official. Now in a certain village of the Middle Heaven, a palace is established as a dwelling,功 slight and virtue little, unable to return by itself. Now pressed and driven by the Earth Palace, no peace or accommodation, the soul flies and the spirit scatters, the corpse form without lodging. I respectfully follow the text of the Most True Great Law in golden seals and jade texts, to petition above the natural heavens for the Female Azure talisman, commanding below the Nine Earth Officials of the Central Heaven to pacify and guard the form and body of certain Jia in his earthly residence. I request the descent of the Nine Qi Azure Heaven Blue-Spirit Living Divine Perfected from the Eastern Sacred Mountain Immortals, riding upon the azure dragon with ninety million steeds, bearing the Nine Qi Heavenly Script Azure Emperor Female Azure Talisman command; commanding below the Nine Earth Officials of the Eastern Village to open the long night’s palace of the Nine Nether Hells, to extract the soul and spirit of certain Jia, returning them to his former dwelling; those who should transform, transform; those who should transcend, transcend; those who should be reborn, be reborn; those who should return, return. For those not yet reborn, clearly pacify the corpse form, comfort and guard them, not to be disturbed. As per the Female Azure text, with azure-patterned silk of ninety feet, or nine feet, to offer to the Nine Qi Heavenly Lord, as the token of extraction and transcendence.

Again, I present five taels of gold, or fifty catties of iron, to offer to the Five Emperors, to pacify and guard the five directions. Certain Jia should now, according to the regulations for opening transcendence, have each of the Nine Earth Officials attend according to their jurisdiction, to manage guard and service, provide what is necessary and what is not, to cause the form to be at peace, the spirit not to scatter. When功 is completed, he shall return to the old dwelling, receive the ferry, and be reborn. May the Five Emperors nourish and soothe with the Great Harmony Original Essence, guide the Qi and nurture the spirit, provide the Three Illuminations to drink, the Mysterious Flow to pour. The Jade Ganoderma replenishes itself, its brilliance early and bright, the fragrance early and full, the soul roams the Upper Purity, clothing and food arise naturally, descending to attach to the palace and residence, merging with the radiance, never to be far apart, sharing transformation and birth.

This day a great celebration, transcending countless persons, opening transcendence for all, none do not comply, honoring and receiving the ancient law, enumerating功 before the heavens. Whoever violates the Female Azure shall lose their office and be punished in body, pledging as before the old system, the Golden Dragon messenger travels, respectfully reporting. The humble servant certain, with reverence and fear, death penalty, death penalty, bows twice and reports.

Empty three lines, servant named certain, belonging to a certain county, district, and village.

The Most High Supreme One Qi, One Qi, the Most High Supreme without Limit, without Crest, without Colour, without Light, Vast and True Great Way, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, the Thirty-two Emperors, the Supreme Great Way Lord, Supreme Purity Jade Majesty.

The Great Year certain Jiazi, certain month, certain day, certain hour, at certain place, a yellow plain statement submitted, presented on golden dragon.

According to the old Female Azure canon, this text is written with vermilion brush on yellow silk, performed at the place where the deceased lies, facing north at the hour of the Rat, burning five fragrant incense sticks, applying the five pacifications and then offering the yellow silk chapter, the exposed text overnight. At dawn next day, burying the text in the four directions to pacify spirits and secure the form. Those who practice it, the Female Azure text says: The nine ancestors’ dark souls all immediately emerge from the long night, entering the light, the Three Officials judge and record names in Heaven, providing them with kitchen and meals, for thirty-two years all return to their former forms and are reborn. Those not yet returned, their corporeal forms and old dwellings become guarded by the Five Emperors, protected by the local deities, comforted and consoled, undisturbed. Not beyond a hundred years, none fail to be transformed and reborn and returned to the human path. The three realms’ registers have their clear divisions. The wise penetrate the utmost principles, examine good and evil, meet cause and effect, and know that words are not false. The foolish take fate as fixed and deny this. The Three Officials suffer destruction, how pitiful indeed!

The Heavenly True Imperial Person says: Formerly in the Red and Bright Heaven there was a Taoist surnamed Zheng, styled Ren’an.功 and virtue incomplete, he died in the north of the Changshan barbarians. His son Zhongming mastered the Dark Harmony Master, using this text to pacify Ren’an’s corpse form and palace for thirty years. Ren’an was transcended and should have returned to among men, but was burned by hunters; his form and bones rose in anger. Now he is the Southern Palace Red Emperor Laojun. The traces of his attainment, now inscribed in the Supreme Ultimate Southern Pavilion, are indeed clear.

The Heavenly True Imperial Person says: Formerly in the Land of Good Endurance there was a Taoist surnamed (Wang+Huang), styled Xinran, apprenticed to the Impermanence Youth, received the Lingbao Extinction and Transcendence Heaven Ascension transmission.功 and virtue insufficient, he died in the Qingyuan Mountains, his corpse buried on the isles of flowing life. Impermanence Youth used this text to pacify his corpse form; after a hundred years, encountering floods, he was washed away and thus transformed and born. Now he is titled the Primordial Spiritual Old Lord, the Southern Palace records his Way traces in the Purple Tenuity Pavilion.

The Heavenly True Imperial Person says: Formerly in the Abandoned Worthy World there was a Taoist surnamed Hao, styled Fuming. In youth he loved mountains and waters, abandoning home to travel afar.功 and virtue incomplete, he died beneath the Earth Mirror Mountain. His son Shaoxin went to the Northern Enclosure Master, receiving this text to pacify Fuming’s corpse form for seven hundred years, refined by water and fire, and so returned to among men. Later apprenticed to the Black Text Master, receiving the ascension transmission, now is the Mysterious Old Emperor. The Southern Palace now records his Way traces in the Northern Primal Mysterious Window.

The Heavenly True Imperial Person says: In the Middle Primordial Heaven in the southern floating Li world, there was a Taoist surnamed Wang, styled Duming. In youth he traveled for study, received from Master Tu Zhen the five chapters of text for heavenly ascension transmission.功 and virtue insufficient, he died in the eastern mountain Guangling. His son Jingxiu went to Dai Zhongjun, received this text to pacify the corpse form for ninety years, met the great desolation of the eastern mountain, the people dug the earth for food, unearthed his corpse, and he immediately transformed and was born. Later he succeeded in the Way and ascended heaven, becoming the Perfected Jingxiao.

The Heavenly True Imperial Person says: All these gentlemen accumulated learning in extinction and transcendence, their Way功 on the verge of completion, and thus received this text to return to birth among men. They all transcended the void steps of emptiness, ascended to the Golden Palace, receiving the title Nature itself. Yet they are not distant and remote, as common folk cannot understand. Considering the nearer ones: Yanmengzi apprenticed to Master Ye Guang, Gaogiuzi apprenticed to Master Shi Gong, Master Hongya, apprenticed to the Golden Mother, all received the Lingbao Extinction and Transcendence Five Refinements method and heavenly ascension transmission. Yanmengzi died at Changqiu Mountain in Lue County, Yuyang. Gaogiuzi died at Gaofu Mountain in Wunxi County, Zhongshan. Master Hongya died at Lang Mountain in Gusu County, Wuwei. All received this text to pacify their tombs; Yanmengzi’s tomb collapsed after forty years and the form transformed, later entering the Great Cave of Meng Mountain’s Golden Court, receiving the text as Immortal Minister. Gaogiuzi’s tomb was opened after seventy-two years, the coffin rotted and form flew, now becomes Perfected of the Central Sacred Mountain. Master Hongya’s tomb opened after one hundred and twenty years, corpse and form soared, receiving the text as Perfected of Qingcheng. These worthies all received the extinction and transcendence method, the heavenly ascension transmission, and the Way of Spirit Pacification; thus attaining exalted emptiness, soaring purity, soaring among high clouds, roaming and feasting in the Purple Tenuity, receiving the title Perfected. These nearer events are no longer remote transmissions. The Primordial Heavenly King orders the opening of the Primordial Treasury, informing the Supreme Ultimate Immortals, those who encounter it will have their past lives recorded through myriad kalpas, their names entered in the Upper Purity, and should obtain the immortal Way. How can the heavens and men not heed the Female Azure’s voice, hiding it as a treasure?
