In the "Orthodox Daoist Canon," it is divided into two scriptures, namely, "The Supreme Guide and Lead of the Three Luminaries Precious and True Sublime Scripture"; and "The Supreme Guide and Lead of the Three Luminaries Nine Transformations Sublime Scripture," both included in the Department of Cavernous Truth in the main text classification. Now they are combined into one.

## The Supreme Guide and Lead of the Three Luminaries Precious and True Sublime Scripture

At the time of the Primordial Celestial Venerable, within the Red Bright World, the Alchemical Spirit Land, in the Vermilion Phoenix City, in the Palace of Radiant Mist, He presides over the Hall of the Three Energies and the Elixir Blossoms. Together with the great sages of the heavens, the most true and venerable spirits, the Five Old Emperors, the Later Sages of the Golden Palace, the Three Pure Ones of the Primordial Pole, the Highest Sage of the Lofty Reverence, the Eastern Floral Great Emperor, the Western Spiritual Golden Mother, the thirty-two Heavenly Emperors, the eighty-one Heavenly Lords, the Mysterious Harmonious Spirit Consorts, the Great Bright Jade Maidens, and the countless without number, they regulate the origin of heaven, control the great floods, weigh the calamities and fortunes, according to the Registers of the Three Origins tally, delivering all beings. The three realms and nine netherworlds, the submerged and diverse species, all spirits acclaim peace and all behold the Dharma gates. The hells are tranquil and calm, the eight shadows open and clear, the accumulated diseases are dispelled and swept away, the record of sins is erased and destroyed, all foresee the heavenly light, and all receive great joy. In the boundless worlds of the ten directions, receiving the majesty and spirit of the Dao, in a moment, all together come.

At that time, from the extreme east and west afar, suddenly a miraculous light arose and shone above the great void, entering the Dharma assembly. Nine colours were brilliant and elegant, sparkling with fresh splendour, resplendent and flowing with fragrance, beyond the power of close inspection. There were heavenly lords and emperors, perfected immortals, jade maidens and jade youths, and followers of heaven and men, all with round countenances, walking upon lotus flowers, filling the two directions, arriving simultaneously. Having entered the assembly, they saluted the Celestial Venerable, burned incense and scattered blossoms, made offerings and paid homage. When the ritual was complete, each withdrew to their own place, seating themselves according to rank at the left and right sides.

Then the Most True (Tai Zhen) raised his faith, the Divine Kings bore banners, heavenly music and empty songs intermingled, myriad varieties of sounds produced, shaking and startling heaven and earth, joy and gladness beyond words. Before the assembly was finished, the Universal Virtue Sublime Practitioner rose from his seat, walked calmly and gracefully, and went directly before the Dao. He bowed his head and made obeisance, addressing the Celestial Venerable: "Now within this assembly there are two groups from east and west, their forms and spirits extraordinary, their countenances perfect and dignified, their movements composed, their miraculous lights brilliantly shining. What sect and practice do they cultivate? Under whose teaching? By what cause have they attained this rank? I humbly request you to instruct me, teaching what has not been heard, that I may inform others."

The Celestial Venerable replied: "Universal Virtue Sublime Practitioner, thou hast attained the rank of the upper truth, having passed through many kalpas, the grades of saintliness, the orders of the true fruit of cultivation, internal and external, high and low, shallow and deep practices, all are clearly perceived by thee without omission. The cultivation of the two groups likewise is to be fully set forth. Thy question arises because within this assembly there are young saints and true youths, as well as first-stage immortals, whose study is not yet extensive. Seeing those groups arriving, they have silent doubts. Thou also wishest to reveal their cultivation, to manifest it to later disciples, hence this question, widely for future generations, to open and unfold the wondrous gate, creating great Dharma benefit. This mind of thine is broad and universal, inconceivable. Sit again and listen attentively, I will tell thee.

The transformation of the Great Dao is prior to prior, neither being nor non-being, most profound and silent, hard to hear or see, neither form nor emptiness, subtle, mysterious, deep, without end or beginning, it will manifest and open transformation, gradually display creation. In the great void of darkness and silence, first the Dao energy is divided, a slight form appears, clear and turbid differing: the clear floats as Heaven, the turbid thickens as Earth. The two energies are distinguished, one Yin, one Yang; Yin and Yang, the utmost essence, combine to form the Sun and Moon. The Yang attains to nine, the Sun contains nine rays; the Yin attains to ten, the Moon divides ten colours. The Moon is swift and restless; the Sun is slow and relaxed; the Moon cuts and completes; the Sun generates and transforms. The two images alternate, illuminating in the midst, all things respond and communicate, producing creation beneath. Moreover, by the two images combining energy, the Sun and Moon divide essence, dispersing as stars and constellations, fixed as rivers and mountains; the five planets and Big Dipper interlace in heaven, to regulate order and command the hidden and manifest. All things great and small are struck by them. Among the Sun, Moon, and stars, each has palaces and mansions, sovereigns, ministers, officers, governing and administering their duties. Immortal ranks and divine officials, officers of merit and fault, all within their domains, none lacking arrangement.

Among these officials, some receive energy to arise, some accumulate merit to transfer office, some follow their cultivation and learning, attesting their ranks, altogether called the Three Luminaries, responding to the Dao’s transformation. All have natural jade characters, the script of the Eight Assemblies, hiding the secrets of the Three Palaces, not transmitted to the world; now shall I bestow them to thee, to descend and transform living beings. This is named Guiding and Leading the Three Luminaries, to wear and govern true energy, according to prescribed pledges and observances, practicing by the law. Eighteen years in all, upon completion of功 (merit), one attains the Dao, energy and Dao unite, lifespan infinite. Those of both directions who long cultivate this Dao, with功 full and virtue complete, form and spirit rise together, dwelling in the Three Luminaries’ Palace, belonging to the Three Luminaries’ quarters, their form and appearance brilliant and glowing, radiance splendidly diffused, differing from the common gods and immortals. If功 be accumulated without ceasing, transferring rank according to grade, from the Three Luminaries’ subordinate immortals, also ascending to saintly rank, together with the Three Caverns cultivating and receiving, all matters are mysteriously the same. This law existed since countless kalpas past, in the boundless beginning, together with the Jade Pure Saintly Teaching, transforming all heavens, the two views and three vehicles, equally without difference; do not entertain doubts regarding the Great Dao.

Then ordering the chief classic officers, the guardian true Grand Historian, the registrar and supervisor of pledges, the highest officials, the jade officers of the four departments, and the officers in charge, they opened the Morning Splendour Precious Hall, bearing the Elixir Scene Jade Box, producing the Three Luminaries’ Supreme Chapters, the jade characters of the Eight Heavens, the Nine Transformations and Eight Assemblies, subtle and wondrous secret writings, according to the Four Poles manifest arrangements, bestowed them upon Universal Virtue Sublime Practitioner. The heavens in office, myriad saints arrayed in order, the three realms and four directors, all looked on and admired. Then Universal Virtue Sublime Practitioner faced north, knelt long, bowed, and received the scripture; all spirits of heaven and earth together proclaimed it good. Then carved it upon white jade tablets, inscribed in gold characters, stored upon the Platform of Yuyi and Pavilion of Jielin. Within four hundred years, it was transmitted to three persons.

Having received the scripture fully, the Celestial Venerable said: "The two groups arriving, the Sun and Moon immortals, guiding and governing the Three Luminaries, verifying and attaining true rank, their form and spirit clear and thorough, illumining the assembly. According to the observations of the assembly, it is very wondrous; yet among the various manifestations of the directions, and among all true immortal lights and appearances, not yet are they uniquely distinguished. Let no doubt or division arise, lest you lose good功. In a moment you will see the Primordial Celestial Venerable, and the multitudes of humans and heavens; each in their bodily aspect produces subtle lights, penetrating the great void, blending heaven and earth, various colours and forms, changes unending, like the Seven Treasures Mountain, shining a hundred thousand suns, mingled with sun and moon hosts, without distinction."

The Celestial Venerable said to Universal Virtue Sublime Practitioner: "The profound功 of the Great Dao produces and transforms myriad things; according to forms and endowments, each has shallow and deep degrees. Laws are sent down to respond to occasions, opening deliverance to all; according to opportunity they cultivate, also with differences. Myriad transformations differ, but all return to one Dao. The Dao itself is without two; returning to the One Origin, at the time of uniting with the Dao, one forgets even this One. No attachment to self or other, no binding to being or non-being, deep silence and rarefaction, apart from words and thoughts. Kalpas have an end; this Dao always remains. Dwelling in the wondrous gate is named attaining the Dao." Having spoken thus, he ordered the heavenly chariot to return to the Great Luo. The assembly of gods and immortals, heavenly beings and highest sages, the three realms within and without, having thoroughly understood the true meaning, bowed to the great void, saluted, and withdrew.
