The Supreme Spiritual Treasure Treatise on Lingzhi Herbs

Secretly, the art of prolonging life has its origin in the taking of elixirs for immortality. The book Hong Bao Wan Mi states: "The immortals make use of spirits." Thus, Guangchengzi dwelt upon Mount Kongtong, demonstrating the Way of governance and imparting it to Xuanyuan. Chisongzi ascended the Kunlun Palace, taking the water jade and instructing the Yan Emperor. He followed the wind and rain up and down, thoroughly examining portentous signs; he wandered through famous mountains, observing grasses and trees, expounding and verifying the obscure and mysterious. Lingzhi, also called the spiritual forms, appear in myriad varieties, truly difficult to distinguish; therefore, illustrations and records with descriptions are given to be sought out and examined, that one may attain the path of immortality.
