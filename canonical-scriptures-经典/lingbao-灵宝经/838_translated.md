## The Supreme Cavernous Mysterious Spirit Treasure Wisdom Original Vow Great Precept Highest Grade Scripture

### The Supreme Ultimate Immortal Lord Questions the Supreme Ultimate Dharma Master

The Immortal Lord, in the quiet fasting chamber on Mount Tiantai, reverently bowed and worshipped, and inquired of the Mysterious Spirit Master, Supreme Ultimate Great Void True Person: "Your disciple is fortunate to attend before the Celestial Venerable. Though my words are humble, threading through myriad kalpas, penetrating the source of the Dao, surpassing the joy of the Great Extreme, none truly explain it. Yet the Mysterious has a slight liking for the way of immortals soaring by day; my heart contemplates the Highest Sage, constantly imitating him. The great scripture is subtle and remote, its exquisite mysteries difficult to comprehend. Pray reveal the secret formula; open my dark ford, so that I may thoroughly traverse the void and boundlessness, where being and non-being both exhaust. Recently, I have not fathomed the cause of life and former lives, the root of karma and conduct. Now I beseech the Celestial Venerable to enlighten what remains uncomprehended."

At that time, the Supreme Lofty Mysterious True Person chanted and walked the void in the cavernous chapter, his countenance joyous and tranquil, his golden visage shining forth with a smile, and said: "This youth has cultivated the Dao through countless kalpas, attaining the jade name of the Supreme Ultimate, entrusted among the wise men, destined to walk alone in the Jade Capital, transcending the three realms. Lofty indeed is the responsibility of the Supreme Immortal Lord. Therefore, with compassion for heaven and man, and care for later scholars, he often aids beings externally, possessing virtue without seeking fame; appointed in the Mysterious Capital, certainly not in vain. He said to the Supreme Ultimate True Person: 'You have received the command of the Supreme Void Emperor Dao Lord to be his teacher and protector; you must also fully instruct in the profound mysteries of the Great Cavern. Is it necessary to relate all at length? I am entrusted only to serve as the chief instructor of the capital, the handling of the scroll is left to you.'"

The Supreme Ultimate True Person answered: "This child is an innocent person, his name carved on a golden tablet, his talent and nature clear and far-reaching, his appearance bright as the Supreme, profound and cavernous in the void; thus he is fit for the Immortal Lord’s charge, to propagate the great and broad Dao. I humbly receive this teaching, but I am ashamed to be unworthy as his master craftsman. The Supreme has commanded it; how dare I not exhaust my store? The unity of all mysteries depends upon the Dharma Master."

The Supreme Ultimate True Person said: "The Dao is non-being. Its weaving is without end. If you seek it, it is near yourself; yet again it is non-existent. By means of existence one enters non-existence, by accumulated thought one attains the wondrous. The myriad things, like illusions, all should return to emptiness. The human body is likewise; when the body dies, the spirit departs. To illustrate: like a house, when the house is ruined, man cannot stand; when the body collapses, the spirit cannot dwell. Therefore one must regulate thought to fix the will, quiet the body to pacify the spirit, preserve the precious qi, let thought and consideration be both forgotten; in deep meditation and inward vision, body and spirit become one. When body and spirit unite, one is near to the true body. This indeed arises from the karmic conduct of former lives, accumulated thoughts and feelings, works benefiting all, virtue shading myriad things, the turning of causes and conditions, the correspondence of guilt and blessing, the extinction of life and death, the interplay of rank, the inclination of wisdom and folly, the deception of wealth and poverty, the manifestation of good and evil; the suffering is boundless, all obtained by human conduct and vow. It is not Dao, nor Heaven, nor Earth, nor Man, nor the works of the myriad things; it is precisely the heart. Once fixed on this, it is also difficult to extricate oneself. The weak and lost, few truly believe in the Dao, many are bound by fate; they do not accumulate good and fix their thought, cultivate virtue in the body, but seek to neglect virtue and forget the body, forcibly grasping external things—how can this be obtained? Having failed, none do not harm their bodies. Therefore, those who have the Dao take it from their own bodies and do not seek it from others. The scripture says: ‘Cultivate the body, then virtue is true,’ thus it is said. To learn the Dao without receiving the great wisdom, the practice, the original vow, and the highest grade great precept, there is no affinity with the Superior Immortals. You have karmic destiny, thus you see this scripture. Its words are secret and hidden; establish belief and effect in the heart, then transmit it; do not rashly show it to the unbelieving. When unbelief arises, strange thoughts will surely arise. Once strange thoughts arise, guilt and fault are obtained mutually; therefore it is hidden in non-being, to be revealed only to those who respond as Immortal Kings. At that time, clouds and dragons danced, the heavens scattered blossoms, fragrant smoke arose, mountains and seas were tranquil in waves, alike things were silent, ghosts and demons vanished, spirits and devils were subdued, the five sufferings all resolved, long liberation from hell, the wicked turned to good, belief and obedience received blessings. Then the Supreme Ultimate was commanded to attend the scripture, and the immortal Liu Wenjing unfolded the clouds and reported it, then bestowed the scripture."

## The Wisdom Original Vow Great Precept Highest Grade

The Supreme Ultimate True Person said: "In former lives, revering scripture masters, orally reciting and bodily practising, giving alms to those in distress, wishing joy in the Three Treasures, filial to rulers and parents, longing for mountains and waters, dwelling among worthy scholars with a humble heart and the Dao, burning incense and scattering blossoms, protecting and delivering all beings, cultivating virtue to repair faults, trusting and obeying fate, quietly reflecting and enduring passions; such conduct may ascend to immortality and save the world; in lower realms it may cause rebirth among wealth and honor. Born as a respected person, with noble appearance and bright talents, possessing the Dao of human conduct, nothing is lacking. Those rich and noble in the world laugh at poverty and lowliness, now repay with poverty and lowliness; those fond of killing repay with premature death; those exceedingly beautiful laugh at ugliness, now repay with ugliness; those clever in the world do not teach others, now repay with stupidity; those often healthy laugh at sickness, now repay with lingering illness; those unfaithful to the Dao laugh at scriptures and teachings, now repay with base folly, long separated from the Dao; those who seize others’ husbands now repay with few orphans; those who seduce women now repay with widows and bachelors; those who vow as husband and wife but cannot be born together as humans, dying as lower ghosts, now repay their original intention, forming evil diseases. Without the great Dharma, none can resolve these karmic knots or dispel such evil diseases. Fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, spouses, rulers, teachers, friends—all these are thoughts of former lives, desires as conditions, revolving and mutually generating, none without correspondence. Therefore it is said, ‘The dependence and opposition are hard to exhaust.’ Only those who learn the immortal Dao should also forget conditions, utterly extinguish birth and death, together return to the Mysterious, and enter the wondrous gate. Only those able thus can be spoken to as students of the Dao.

When seeing one’s household and wife and children, one should wish that all promptly abandon desire and captivity, restrain the mind and observe precepts; when seeing those who drink wine, wish all to be restrained at the gate of life, so as to keep far from calamity and disorder; when seeing courtesans, wish all to guard purity, endure desires, and admire the worthy and chaste; when seeing lascivious persons, wish all to remove and abandon evil thoughts, raise the heart and forbid transgressions;

Daoists, sitting and lying, always wish for us, the four great elements combined with virtue, united in the true Dao, long residing in the Mysterious Capital, teachers and friends naturally, delivering to the ten directions, the world receiving grace, freedom without action, penetrating the wondrous gate."

## Three Ritual Blessings

The True Person’s Secret Formula says: "Attending scripture, immortal children and jade maidens hearing these blessings are all joyful and protect their bodies." This great scripture uses these blessings in all its worship and obeisance. Those who deeply meditate and worship the scripture also mentally bless its words, which are the secret blessings of the Superior Immortal.

- "Delight in the Dharma as a wife, love the scripture like pearl and jade.  
Keep precepts restraining the six passions; think of the Dao to dismiss desires.  
Indifference and upright qi resting, tranquil and silent spirit.  
Heavenly demons respect and protect, generations receive great blessings."

- "Flourishing is the family and country, thriving is the Dharma and Dao.  
Heaven and man share this vow, drifting into the great vehicle.  
By the mind establish fields of blessing, the Dharma wheel rises lightly.  
The seven ancestors born in heaven, my body soars in daylight."

- "Great Dao is cavernous, void, and mysterious; where thought exists, nothing is not fulfilled.  
Refining the substance to immortal truth, thus forming the adamantine body.  
Transcending the three realms is difficult; the five sufferings of hell are resolved.  
All return to the Supreme Scripture; quietly reflect and bow in worship."

## This Precept is Named the Wisdom Hidden Scripture, Dao Practice Original Vow Highest Precept Treasure True Grade. The Supreme Void Emperor transmitted to the Supreme Great Dao Lord; the Dao Lord transmitted to the Supreme Subtle Emperor; the Emperor transmitted to the Nine Subtle Supreme True; the Supreme True transmitted to the Supreme Ultimate Great Dharma Master; and transmitted to the Supreme Ultimate Lofty Immortal Lord, but not made known to the lesser immortals. Three transmissions over a thousand years; if there is no Supreme Ultimate Golden Tablet Immortal name, none shall encounter this scripture or precept. Daoists shall turn and receive it; if attained, keep it secret and reverently uphold it. Ten Supreme Immortal Children attend to view the precept, guarding disciples’ bodies. At times there are worthy scholars, believers both male and female, bearing signs not to close the holy words. On their birth signs, Jiazi, Gengshen, and the Eight Festivals, they fast and recite once each.

The Supreme Ultimate True Person said: "To learn the way of ascending to immortality, one must establish 1,200 good deeds without return; to establish 3,000 deeds is to ascend in broad daylight. All assist those who ought to die in difficulty; giving benefit to such persons is especially good. To learn the Dao is to cause all to act in accord with the law, widely build fields of blessing, and arouse a great compassionate heart; in movement and stillness, always arise Dao intent. If such be done, with breathing exercises and medicinals, wearing talismans, reading scriptures, and focused thought, without weariness lifelong, how could there be no attainment of immortality? Those without such virtue, taking medicine and wearing talismans, reading scriptures and fasting, perish in their end without proof." The learned scholar should clearly understand these essentials.

The Supreme Ultimate True Person said: "Establishing 300 good deeds may obtain long-lasting earthly immortality; if even one deed be incomplete, one must begin again, losing all prior merit. Those who always have the thought in their heart and loins, this is so. You lead men to do good, that itself is good merit."

The Supreme Ultimate True Person said: "Always think on chanting, scripture recitation, great compassion in action, ancestors before self, spreading good and transforming evil, severing all connections, extinguishing thought and guarding emptiness, mind like the Great Mysterious, seeking only the Dao—thus may one be said to speak of the way of spirits and immortals."

The Supreme Ultimate True Person said: "In former days I received the Supreme Ultimate Wisdom Ten Good Encouragements and Meritorious Precepts from the Supreme Great Dao and the Void Emperor, venerated and cultivated generation after generation, practicing the great Dharma, delivering men easily; this is the field of natural blessing. The Supreme widely teaches heaven and man; now each obtains original vow and first enters the Dharma gate, abiding in non-action, no longer suffering the ten sufferings and eight difficulties; guilt ceases and dissolves; hell rests; the three officials are peaceful and quiet; generations flourish and rejoice; all escape the net; future lives are peaceful and secure; the nature of heaven is tranquil; wishes follow as one. The precepts are as above, transmitted to the worthy and faithful."

## Ten Good Encouragements Precepts

- Encourage reverence and respect for the Three Treasures; nourish Dharma Masters; so that men in the world become gentlemen, worthy and filial, of great talent, lofty and noble, born as respected persons, flourishing their clans.

The Three Treasures mean the Dao, scriptures, and teachers. They can nourish life and teach goodness, serving as models for men; this is called Dharma Masters.

- Precept: Encourage the copying and writing of scriptures, so that men are intelligent in all generations, broadly learned in wondrous deeds, constantly living in holy times, seeing all scriptures and teachings, able to recite chapters and verses.

- Precept: Encourage the building of fasting and quiet halls, so that men’s families in all generations are noble, bodies ascend to heaven, food and drink are natural, always abiding in non-action.

- Precept: Encourage offering incense and oil to aid the poor, so that men in all generations flourish in fragrance, clean and bright, with noble features and lofty heavenly disposition.

- Precept: Encourage Dharma Masters’ robes, so that men in all generations remain elegant, freely wandering in China, not falling to barbarians, men and women proper, wearing crowns and jade pendants.

- Precept: Encourage kings, parents, and subjects in loyalty and filial piety, so that men in all generations have many descendants, men and women worthy and learned, no longer suffering hardships.

- Precept: Encourage fasting and quiet recitation of scriptures, so that men in all generations do not fall into hell, but ascend to heaven, reverently seeing all saints, quickly returning to original form, transforming and being born in royal families, in accordance with their wishes, playing and adorning fully, the seven ancestors rejoicing together, all good conditions complete, beginning and end in glory and joy, the Dharma wheel turning, attaining the path of immortality.

- Precept: Encourage all to learn scriptures, so that men in all generations have penetrating talent and wisdom, movement and stillness with dignity, always teachers of men.

This precept is named the Supreme Wisdom Encouragement Essential Precept Highest Grade; all are spoken in the Great Wisdom Scripture’s upper scroll, the Dharma transmitted by the Supreme Ultimate True Person to govern Dao practice. Those with karmic blessings, upon seeing these words, should keep and reverently uphold them secret. Rashly showing to unbelievers brings calamity to the world; dying as lower ghosts, locked in hell, revolving through five sufferings; future lives losing human path. The same applies to those who destroy scriptures and precepts.

The Supreme Ultimate True Person said: "The greatest evils in human conduct are jealousy, killing, greed, luxury, pride, and lust. If these exist in the heart, surely they harm one’s lifespan. To clutch these while learning immortality—is this not sorrowful?"

The Supreme Ultimate True Person said: "The Dao and virtue number five thousand characters, the great scripture. This Dao penetrates heaven, earth, and man; all things follow it to their beginning and end. Superior men who receive and recite it become Supreme Immortal Kings; middling men become flying immortals; inferior men become turning-wheel holy royal family, not entering hell, always born in blessed countries. When life’s end comes, the Heavenly Emperor’s cloud chariot welcomes souls and spirits, resting in blessed halls. This delivery of beings is countless, impossible to fully describe."

Formerly there was a woman who received and recited this scripture; her husband was always angry, but she did not relent. The woman thus ascended to heaven by day; the husband died and entered hell, undergoing examination for many years. The woman flew and watched, instructing him to read the Dao and virtue scripture; now he is to be saved. At that time, heaven and man flew down; the Governor of Mount Tai called and questioned him; he fully answered: "I was often taught by the woman and reverenced this scripture; she ascended to immortality—I therefore sought aid because of past kindness." The Governor said: "Though you did not study, you often reverenced the Great Dao and respected the scripture and Dharma; you may be sent to the hall of blessing and given kitchen food; in a thousand years you shall be born among men and may receive and recite this scripture." The man said: "If I may be born human, I will certainly receive this scripture and seek to save the world." After a thousand years he was born among men, at age thirteen took delight in the five thousand characters, studied under masters and received recitation formulas; a bright talent, the king invited him respectfully, but he did not accept; he thus ascended to immortality by day. His ancestors respected scripture, his virtuous wife helped him; all because of past karmic kindness.

Formerly there was a wise and enlightened Daoist, fasting in a quiet chamber, unable to obtain midday meal. At that time, common family men and women respected and delighted in the Great Dharma, moved by this Daoist’s endurance of hunger and scripture recitation, daily setting up midday meals, coming to listen to the scripture; the Daoist pitied their faith, transmitted the scripture to men and women, taught the formulas, all recited it ten thousand times. The Supreme Dragon Chariot descended to receive him; he ascended to heaven by day. Such examples are many, not all recorded. Although ordinary men cannot learn the immortal Dao, all may receive the five thousand characters, reverence and respect, thus reaching the Dao of non-action, preserving life in the world, bringing peace and joy to families, dying their path and born in heaven, no longer in the prisons of three officials and hell. The secret lies in faith and liking; thus this great blessing may be obtained.

The Great Cavern True Scripture, Supreme Cavernous Mysterious Hidden Book Treasure Scripture, must not be transmitted to ordinary persons; all must be those who can learn immortality, who should cultivate and recite it. If lightly transmitted to common folk, they will be imprisoned with the seven ancestors and grandparents in hell, undergoing five poisons’ examination. Beware, beware.

The Supreme Ultimate True Person said: "The confusion of men is to turn away from ancestors, competing with ghosts and spirits, and killing life to seek life. Is not this turning far from life? In life they do not cultivate goodness or regulate their bodies, endure cutting away desires; at death they lavishly bury their remains, not knowing that soul and spirit have already suffered five poisons, imprisoned in hell, tormented in the three paths, revolving through the five ways. Life in the world is brief, yet they amass wealth without limit, never sufficient, a heavy burden for oneself. Blessings exhausted, guilt arrives, body dies and name vanishes, wealth scattered like dust in a fierce wind. Daoists hold fasting, burn incense, read scriptures; these are the great affairs of the world. Yet many do not wish to see, though seeing as if not seeing. They hear sorcerers and ghost speech, all giving them rich offerings. Fasting and quietude bring blessings; sorcerers’ singing and dancing invite calamity. The calamity reaches both them and me; souls and spirits both suffer examination and punishment, disasters without end, coming and going through the three evils, suffering beyond words. After guilt, in future lives they fall as beasts, losing the human path. Even if they return to human birth, they are lowly; some lack six roots, some are ugly in form and substance, foul in qi and stench, male or female, ignorant and hateful, abandoned by all, wandering the world, suffering hunger and cold until death. Such persons all suffer for the sins of former lives, coming from beasts and just returning to the human path. If in this life one endures hardship and sweet poverty, repents past and cultivates future, seeks and serves the Dharma to liberate oneself, one also sees gradual repayment in this life, in the next life receiving great blessing, born in families of wealth and nobility, perfect appearance, noble and majestic features, radiant brilliance, all see and delight, compassionate, truthful and fond, talented and far-sighted, desiring sons and daughters, according to my original vow. Seeking good friends for causes and conditions and knowledge, all shall surely meet in the dark assembly, becoming brothers, descendants, and pupils, so that generations are worthy and filial, revolving and mutually generating, never ceasing. Therefore it is said, ‘Dependence and opposition of causes and conditions—who knows their extremes?’ Also it is said descendants must maintain unceasing ancestral rites, this is what is meant."

The Supreme Ultimate True Person said: "The Way of Profound Simplicity, the ancients cultivated it to prolong life and increase lifespan, thus attaining longevity. Now men do the opposite, wasting years and shortening life, inviting premature death. Can they still blame sorcery? The guilt is their own; is it not sorrowful?"

The Supreme Ultimate True Person said: "Those who learn the Dao first are filial to their parents, loyal to their rulers, compassionate to their servants, truthful to their friends, their words reliable, admonishing evil and promoting good, without ‘this’ or ‘that’, without selfishness, not violating external teaching, able to serve the human path. Next they abstain from wine, sounds, colours, jealousy, killing, luxury, and pride. Next they cut off the five pungent spices, fat meats, and flavourful dishes. Next they cause thought and reflection to be combined and dark, the mind intimate with purity and emptiness. Next they take food to rest the roots, keep the great precepts, firm in substance, diligent in will, guiding and leading the prenatal breath, exhaling and inhaling harmoniously, cultivating and building merit, enduring what others cannot endure, cutting away what others cannot cut, walking where others cannot walk, dwelling where others cannot dwell, wearing what others cannot wear, eating what others cannot eat, guarding what others cannot guard, learning what others cannot learn. When the Dao practice is thus, then one may be stabilized by spiritual medicine, feast on cloud buds, corpses and worms sink and fall, filth and leakages are extinguished, the three palaces cleansed, the five viscera at peace. Then one will fast long and think deeply, quietly chant the Cavernous Scriptures, delight in all wonders, concurrently with elixirs. Such as these, how could there be no way to ascend to immortality?"

The Celestial Venerable said to the Supreme Ultimate True Person: "If one does not cultivate human conduct, is not loyal to parents and rulers, indulges in wine and lust, kills and is greedy and cruel, proud and luxurious, deceives the worthy and good, borrows and does not repay, even a little of such conduct long continues, and cannot reform, but desires to embrace it, using fasting and precepts to learn the Dao, hoping for the flesh to fly—does this not bring sorrow? Such a person will long dwell in hell, tread on the five poisons, on mountains of knives and swords, in boiling fire and scorching flames, cooked and boiled in five bodily parts, seeking death but not obtaining it, hungry eating iron, thirsty drinking fire, exposed to cold and ice, flesh torn and bone cut, handed to the three officials, exiled to mountains and seas, bearing earth and stones, whipped and scourged, examined and punished, fully passing through the three disciples and five ways, coming and going in the ten sufferings and eight difficulties, the pain boundless, impossible to fully express."

The Supreme Ultimate True Person said: "Such a person is inferior even to external learners among ordinary men, who cultivate benevolence and righteousness, reverence and faith in Dao and virtue, following only good. They entrust themselves to transformation and change with the times, wandering freely within the domain, pure and at ease; when their life ends, they enter blessed abodes, not passing through prisons and hell. They may become spirits or gods. Future lives among men do not lose original vow, turning and obtaining roots of faith, binding bonds with sages and worthies, filth and burdens gradually exhausted, finally entering the immortal Dao."

The Supreme Ultimate True Person said: "The trouble is men obtain full human path but do not cultivate virtue and nurture nature to perfect their fate; the trouble is they hear scriptures but do not believe; the trouble is they believe scriptures but covet wealth and do not receive them; the trouble is they receive scriptures but do not study and recite; the trouble is they study and recite but do not practise the matters; the trouble is they practise the matters but do not persist in the Dao; the trouble is they serve masters but do not maintain it to the end; the trouble is they take medicine but have not harmonized the middle breath; the trouble is Dao practice is incomplete but they boast and seek to ascend; the trouble is fasting and reading scriptures, dwelling in remote mountains but cannot bear the sorrow. These ten troubles are in men’s bodies; if not guarded against, the body will not be saved. Therefore it is said: 'A great trouble is to have a body for me.' This is what is meant. Is it not to be considered? Is it not to be considered?"

The Supreme Ultimate True Person transmitted the scripture, expounded the Dharma, and explained the precepts to the end, singing of the pains of the three disciples and five ways, sighing in these words:

"The three powers and myriad things, dependence and opposition each has its term.  
Beginnings and ends await the number of kalpas, blessings exhausted, heaven and earth collapse.  
Coming and going through the five ways, suffering indeed, more death and birth.  
Revolving among the three disciples, departure and calamity together."

"The great worthy must guard these precepts, endure nature and restrain passion.  
Fools do not believe the Dharma, guilt and pain always beset themselves.  
My thought for the world is unceasing, thus I again solemnly declare.  
If you wish to cross this trouble, return to the Supreme Scripture."

"Guilt and blessing do not come from others, surely arise from your own body.  
The great worthy therefore holds his mouth shut, wishing to sever all evil ties.  
Extinguish thought and return to forgetfulness, dependence and opposition await long extinction.  
Propagate the Dao to pacify the world; finally the true reality shall be seen."

"Lust and jealousy are the chief calamities, the utmost trouble that destroys the body.  
To cherish and nourish such persons, surely leads to early death and mutilation.  
Knowing evil yet not reforming it, how can this be pleasing to the Dao?  
Harbor poison daily, fasting uprightly, causes me long sighs."

"Karmic destiny is reliable indeed, the weak and lost say there is none.  
All desire to see what is before the eyes, passing over and then say it is distant.  
The great worthy understands the Dao’s teaching, sorrowful and compassionate for the foolish.  
Pensively thinking of your suffering, diligently causing me anxiety."

"Human life is already exhausted, like fire in grease.  
The four great elements temporarily meet, the five substances are borrowed for a time.  
The prime of life should diligently learn, hasten to seek to preserve self and I.  
Blessings exhausted, body and spirit scatter, darkly descending to hell below.  
The Highest Sage fears this, hence seeks the Dao to cross this calamity."

"Learning immortality is urgent, revering precepts restrains passion and heart.  
Void and vast, upright qi abides, immortals and sages seek each other.  
If one does not believe the Dharma words, why dwell in mountain forests?"

"The great worthy delights in scripture and precepts, receiving them as treasures of the body.  
Studying is always late and hard; managing the body regrets not early.  
Comparing to opening hidden mysteries, suddenly years are old.  
Holding the scroll, absorbing its utmost, will add death’s pain and trouble.  
Therefore, in youthful age, abandon the world to learn the Dao."

The Supreme Ultimate True Person said: "When I formerly learned the Dao, I received it from the Supreme Void Emperor, reverently upheld and cultivated it, thus becoming a True Person. Daoists who wish to receive my great precept texts, the master first reads once through to show their heart. Those who are truly students of immortality must bring faith and come to the master’s gate, then fast and meditate for three days, think on the Dao and precepts; thus is the great transmission. This precept is utmost and heavy; each has powerful divine guardians protecting the person. Be cautious, be cautious."

The Immortal Lord said: "This great precept is bestowed on those learning the immortal Dao. They seek the world’s extraordinary; all things should return to emptiness, all are Dharma, to rely on to cross the three disciples’ sufferings and obtain the Dao. Those who meet it, you are fulfilling vows. Those who receive it should follow it and not neglect diligent cultivation." The Immortal Lord received the precepts on the Day of Original Uprightness and composed this ode:

"Dark the famed mountains in quietude,  
Gazing on steep cliffs and crags.  
White snow veils the front court,  
Strong wind blows through eastern woods.  
Facing the Celestial Venerable’s countenance,  
Deep mysteries absorbed and scattered.  
Pitying men falling into sin,  
Sorrowing that the heart does not leave it.  
Turning away from scripture and precepts to believe evil demons,  
Abandoning fasting and quietude for fine wine and music.  
Turning the five ways and three disciples,  
Experiencing hell’s gloom and depth.  
These sufferings are hard to speak of,  
More death and life to endure,  
Only Dao and virtue save beings,  
Why wait for trouble and not seek?"

The Immortal Lord gave instruction to disciple Zheng Siyuan: "When young I wandered among famous mountains, stepping on cliffs near beasts, enduring great hardship, restraining passion and dismissing thought, reducing speech and giving alms. Later I became a man, cherished the Dao and pacified the world, constantly cultivating compassion and love, thinking of the Dao to preserve truth, never daring to substitute it. I fasted and purified for a year without end; on the winter solstice, a heavenly spirit descended and granted me the great scripture and supreme immortal Dao. The heavenly spirit commanded me to fast long and quietly, recite according to scripture, learn it in order, and thus become a True Person. The scriptures and Dao I once received are esteemed by the Supreme, not those learned by lesser immortals. Throughout kalpas they have always been passed by supreme immortals, Immortal Lords, Immortal Kings, and Immortal Nobles, not only myself. My ancestors and you have together made this vow, practising good works diligently without slackness, attaining immortal names in the Mysterious Capital. Now we are teachers and friends, thus mutually transmitting. When I pass away there will be kind-hearted benefactors who delight in the Dao to come to my gate; you shall entrust to them this present Dao enterprise, all matters proceeding in accord; the Dharma shall be recorded and transmitted generation after generation. This is because of karmic kindness in past lives. You should entrust one copy to a worthy disciple. If no such person, one copy shall be sealed and placed in the Five Great Mountains." This is the Supreme Ultimate True Person’s secret formula; you must keep it secret, be cautious, and ponder it.
