# The Scripture Entitled “Immortals’ Inquiry into the Fundamental Practice and Causes, Difficulties among the Assembly of Sages” (Dunhuang Edition)

The name of the scripture is: Immortals’ Inquiry into the Fundamental Practice and Causes, Difficulties among the Assembly of Sages. It is also briefly called the “Scripture of Fundamental Practice and Causes” or the “Scripture of Difficulties among the Assembly of Sages.” The author is unknown, but it is roughly dated to the Eastern Jin period. It forms one of the ancient “Lingbao Scriptures.” The original is one scroll. There are two editions: the Dunhuang edition and that in the “Orthodox Taoist Canon,” the texts of which differ somewhat; both are preserved here. The base text is taken from Dunhuang manuscript P. 2454.

In the year [illegible], in the year of Gengshen, on the first day of the first month, at the hour Renzi, [illegible], in a quiet chamber, meditating upon the Dao.

At midday on that day, there were thirty-three Earth Immortal Taoists, who came to the hall to burn incense, to pay respects to the scripture, and to circumambulate. When all was finished, they each returned to their former places and dwelt in tranquillity. The Immortal then withdrew from his seat and requested to inquire: “We, the underlings, have studied the Dao for many ages, accumulating nine hundred years until now. Yet we, though called Earth Immortals, have no office, and scatter in the mountains and forests. The Heavenly Venerable first raised the Dao, and formerly bestowed upon me the title of Tai Ji Left Immortal Duke, so I should ascend the Supreme Jade Capital, enter the Golden Palace, and pay homage to the Most High Void Sovereign. But I do not understand what meritorious deeds in past lives have led to this, nor what scripture to follow. Thus I beseech you to explain the origin of our past destinies, and the fundamental causes and conditions.”

The Immortal Duke answered after a moment: “What you ask is remote and profound. Sit again, I will now tell you. When the two instruments (yin and yang) have been divided, there arise essence and dross, merit and demerit, longevity and heaven, wealth and poverty, prosperity and decline, myriad affairs and forms, human participation in the Three Elements, the wise and foolish, the talented and slow-witted — all these depend upon the fundamental practices cherished by man, and the establishment of aspiration and virtue. You fellows, in your former lives studied the Dao and received scriptures, but your achievements were slight, your aspirations narrow: you sought only to save yourselves, not to save others; you learnt but did not teach; you sought the Dao but did not care that others should obtain it; you did not believe the great scriptures of vast and distant words; you did not observe fasting and abstinence; you did not follow the Three Caves Masters, but delighted in the Lesser Vehicle teachings. Hence you obtained the way of Earth Immortals, the technique of corpse liberation. Yet your coming and going is at will; you live long and are undying, but have not transcended the three realms, only wandering the ten directions, and looking up to the Supreme Jade Capital and Golden Palace. If you desire speedily to ascend and fly to the heavens of Shangqing, you must establish further merit, rescue kings and peoples from disasters, calamities, and afflictions, and when your great merit is complete, the Supreme One will bestow upon you the invitation. Therefore Peng Zu lived eight hundred years, An Qi Sheng a thousand, Bai Shi Sheng three thousand years; they therefore wander among the common folk, all because their past life’s study of the teachings was but slight in merit. Some live ten thousand years in mountain caves and yet have not ascended to heaven; you have but a few hundred years, what is there to call long? Immortals who are secret in the mountains and forests, practising hidden virtue and ascending to immortality; or those who perform corpse liberation, entrusting their form and reducing their burden, often manifest in the world and are the ones spoken of in books and scriptures, but these are few indeed.”

At that time there was an Immortal surnamed Ji, styled Facheng. The Immortal Duke pointed to him and said: “He was my disciple in a former life, yet had not seen the root of his past destiny. I can cause you to understand the affairs of your former lives.” Facheng said: “Yes, yes, Heavenly Venerable.” Presently he understood, clasped his hands and made obeisance: “Your disciple Facheng, having not comprehended the Fundamental Practice, prays for your compassion.”

The Immortal Duke said: “In the time of Emperor Yao, you followed me into Mount Song to study the Dao. Your aspirations were small and you hoped for speed; you often mocked my words as vain and deceitful, my hopes remote and my practice difficult; you lamented that Xu You and Chao Fu severed their bond with Mount Ji, resigned the abdication of Yao, and repented their luxurious regrets — all these you found unsettling. I constantly exhorted you to study the Dao of Shangqing, but you did not follow. Though drinking the sea, you could not fill your belly; though knocking on stones, you could not obtain jade. Xu and Chao early ascended to the Tai Ji Palace; I now have the post of Left Immortal Duke, yet you alone remain an Earth Immortal, merely undying. Your virtue approaches but a few steps — are you not vexed? Now you know that my words have foundation, and believe without deception.” Facheng, ashamed, recalled this not long past, and his heart was clear. Formerly disobedient to instruction, now his lament was deep, and he longed to be lifted up, to serve the cloud chariots and hold the reins, to face the Heavenly Countenance — thus was the meeting of his past destiny.

The Immortal Duke said: “Your excellence and height is sufficient to ascend to Heaven, but how could you follow me to the Tai Ji Palace and attend the Supreme Jade Capital and Golden Palace? I have no regrets.” The Immortal again asked the Immortal Duke: “Is the fundamental practice of past lives fully complete, or if not, pray explain it.”

The Immortal Duke said: “My forebears experienced the workings of merit and demerit, reincarnation and transformation of shape; to relate it fully would be endless. If you desire to know, I may briefly mention a corner. I was formerly born a noble, trampling on poverty and lowliness, oppressing the weak with power; dying, I entered Hell. Afterwards born a petty man, poor, diseased, lonely and cold. Then I formed the thought: ‘What past destiny have I followed to bring this hardship? What past destiny had merit to enjoy wealth and honour?’ I thought of doing good, but my heart was not purified; my anxieties and toxins were hard to speak. I died and ascended to the Hall of Blessings. Afterwards born in a wealthy family, treasures were abundant, nothing lacking, yet cruel servants and slaves brought suffering; on death I entered Hell to be judged. When the Three Officials completed their judgment, I was born a low servant, watching human breath, serving others, and was often whipped and scourged, suffering bitter torments, enduring all tortures. Then I thought: ‘What crime of my past life causes me to be such a low servant?’ I supplied my private possessions to the poor, revered the Taoists, offered incense and oil in worship, only wishing to be born in a noble family and die ascending the Hall of Blessings, with food and clothing natural. Afterwards born a noble, I again persecuted living beings, using fish and crab as servants; dying, I entered Hell, passing through the mountains of knives and trees of swords, boiling in water and swallowing fire, enduring all five torments; after punishment was complete, I was born a pig or sheep, repaying old grievances. Afterwards I took the form of a lowly person, foul and detested, cheating people’s wealth without returning it, dying and going to Hell. Later I was born a cow, repaying men by labour, offering my flesh as food. Afterwards changing form to a middle person, treasures were close at hand; at this time I thought of doing merit, constantly supported Taoists, reverently received scriptures and precepts, humble and lowly, giving alms to the poor and distressed, following the Dao in all matters, hearing good and wishing to follow it; at eighty years I died and immediately ascended to the Hall of Blessings, with food and clothing from Heaven’s kitchen. Afterwards born a noble, I cultivated fondness for martial valour, persecuted others; yet I still reverenced and obeyed Taoists, believed in the highest laws; dying, I entered Hell and was judged. Then the Supreme One gave teaching: ‘Though this man committed persecution, since he has entered Hell, in life he believed the law, reverenced the Dao, and gave alms to the poor and distressed; now we will forgive his judgement, and permit him to ascend to the Hall of Blessings and receive food from Heaven’s kitchen.’ Afterwards born a noble, I resented impending doom; at that time I formed vows and thoughts of Dao, reverenced and received the teachings, practised hidden virtue, rescued the distressed, governed by Dao, showed compassion to beings, supported Taoists, served my lord with loyalty, served ministers with propriety, constantly thought to abandon fame and forsake emolument; thus I escaped enemies, died and ascended to Heaven’s hall. Afterwards born again a noble, reverencing and believing still more carefully, though talent was lacking; then I formed the thought to burn incense, wishing that my future life might be wise and bright, understanding profound and wondrous meanings, and become a Taoist, dying and ascending the Hall of Blessings. Afterwards born in the Central Lands, I became a Taoist Master, wearing robes and vestments, holding precepts and practising the Dao. At that time I lectured on scriptures and was wise, thus respected by many Masters. Then I thought: ‘In this one life I cannot attain the Dao; better to be a woman, quiet and at leisure.’ At death I was born a woman, fair of form, bright of mind, eloquent and articulate. Then I prepared fasts and studied scripture; thus I formed the thought to be a man, talented and broad, understanding the profound and vast, penetrating the subtle and rare, and wished to serve a king and interact with Taoists. In my intent and wishes, I wandered the mountains and waters, had ample pleasure in music and women, often lectured on scriptures, died and ascended to Heaven’s hall, with food and clothing natural. Soon after born in a royal house, as a Crown Prince, indulging in the palaces, inheriting the royal estate; at times I invited Taoists, worthy Confucians and scholars, to observe rites and lecture on the Dao, cultivating solemn calm and quiet, freely indulging my desires; the nation was secure and the people prosperous, solemn and without disturbance. At this time, the three ministers all formed vows: ‘In the future I will be a Taoist, and you a recluse.’ They were Wei Mi, Zhu Fa Kai, Zheng Siyuan, Zhang Tai, all wishing to be Taoists, all aspiring to ascend to immortality and deliver the world, to sever royal affairs and die ascending directly to Heaven’s hall, with food and clothing from Heaven’s kitchen. I in the future was a recluse, Wei Mi, Zhang Tai and others likewise Taoists, all entering the mountains to seek the Dao and immortality. Then I became teacher to many, aspiring to the Great Vehicle practice, constantly fasting and reading scriptures, carrying treasures, visiting great Masters, receiving the Three Caves great scriptures, supporting and offering, fasting and practising the Dao, taking food and breathing exercises. Because the causes and conditions were not complete, my life ended and I was born at Taiyin, again born a worthy family, again a Taoist Master, again receiving fellow students and mutual teaching, again receiving the great scriptures, fasting and practising the Dao. Therefore the highest sages eagerly watch, deficient in the true teachings given to me. At that time Wei Mi, Zhang Tai all attended the seat; today they accompany me — this is the fundamental vow of past lives and causes. All the immortals were not without understanding; the four seats sighed and then exclaimed: ‘Heavenly Venerable High One, having sought the Dao long and accumulated many kalpas and years, thus obtaining the rank of Immortal Duke, surely there is reason. Now we fully see that our past deeds were slight in merit, and that our reception of scriptures was little; how then should we blame ourselves for seeking higher immortality? Hereafter we should consider receiving the great Cave scriptures, diligently practise compassion, rescue all who are distressed, in hope of ascending to Heaven.’ The Immortal Duke said: ‘If you do not observe the Supreme Cave scriptures, the myriad wonders will have no accomplished principle; each thinks to be diligent and to do great merit, to rescue all suffering — with such resolve, why fear that you will not quickly ascend to Heaven? But if you desire to ascend the Supreme Golden Palace, still the day has not come.’ The Immortal Duke said: ‘I have trodden everywhere, not recorded in writing, diligently and painfully beyond words, only now have I received reward.’ The Immortal inquired: ‘When formerly entering Dongting with the High One, to see the separate palace of the Heavenly King, and first ascending Mount Mao, I saw a company of Immortals seeking to follow the High One to watch the spectacle; what sort of Immortals are these, that there are so many?’ The answer was: ‘Those Immortals are all Immortals of famous mountains and caves, but there are few now. Have you not seen Kunlun, Penglai, Zhongshan, Songgao, Huayue, Lingniao — all great mountains and caves, where there are countless Immortals?’

The Immortal said: ‘I know not where Dongting leads.’ The answer was: ‘It leads to all the great mountains above, and to the Great Sea, North Feng, Mount Tai, the Five Sacred Mountains; there is nothing it does not connect.’ Five Immortals said they had returned to Jvqu Mountain; is that the homeland of the High One? The answer was: ‘Jvqu Mountain is what I see when I raise my eyes; it is a fine mountain to the left of the river. It is the western gate of the Nine Springs of Dongting; below the cave platform is about thirty li; the palaces shine like the sun; this is the number thirty-six of the small heavens. It rejects foul air; Taoists who walk upright may dwell there. There are always people. Formerly Master Mao attained the Dao; he is now at that mountain cave palace on the mountain, in the void, called the Empty Cave, where he established the Mysterious Palace Temple, the dwelling of Immortals.’

The Immortal asked: ‘Recently ascending the Xuánpǔ Palace of Kunlun, attending the seat, I saw the Zhengyi Perfected One, the Three Heavens Master Zhang Daoling, descending his seat, with Fengdu officials receiving him; the three realms bowed; the heavens paid respects; the dragon carriage shone in the void in movement and stillness; his neck bore round radiance; his body produced heavenly light; his writing was brilliant and resplendent. What meritorious deeds in past lives caused him to attain the Dao and be thus distinguished? I wish to hear.’ The answer was: ‘The Heavenly Master’s fundamental practice was also the toil of many kalpas; fasting and reading scriptures, promoting the Dao greatly and generously; modelling the mystery and truth; delighting in the subtle and rare; revolving the wheel to seek the Dao, especially surpassing me. It cannot be fully told. His aspiration was the great scriptures, his practice the great Dao; hence he obtained the post of Three Heavens Master, the title of Supreme Zhengyi Perfected One. Is it not great?’ At that time the Eastern Flower Blue Youth and the assembly of Immortals all in the Songgao caves chanted scriptures in quiet fasting. Those beginning to learn, hearing the Immortal Duke speak of the fundamental practice, none did not reflect on the great law for self-discipline.

The Blue Youth said: ‘The Immortal Duke’s wonderful discourse, words remote and matters essential, are trustworthy and to be honoured.’ The assembly of Immortals made obeisance and said: ‘We desire to follow these words.’ The Blue Youth said: ‘Formerly with you I received reports and favours, and until now have never forgotten. You have accepted the Supreme One’s bestowal; I should have first cultivated reverence, and affection for intimacy; not yet fully displaying myself; often turning and tossing; I wish not to be solitary in this feeling.’ The Immortal Duke said: ‘Formerly offending you, I deeply regret and am ashamed; increasing my humility, when will my heart cease? Though deficient and unworthy before the highest sages, the evidence is manifest in books and commands, and I am ashamed beyond endurance. Together with you I practise Dao and virtue, wandering the three realms, ever thinking of untroubled ease, roaming the profound void — this is the respect of the public house; why mention it further? But when I seek the high post, the distant day becomes near; yet there is attachment and regret — what then?’ 

The Blue Youth answered: ‘With head bowed, I have many times received your kindness and am comforted.’ The Immortal Duke said: ‘The Heavenly Master says on the fifteenth day of every month, one should fast in quiet chambers, read the received Dao scriptures and the immortal and Taoist traces, all for the later sage’s people; born in this age, is it not joyful? On the day of one’s birth, read scriptures, and do not engage in worldly affairs; these are the essentials of seeking immortality. The Daoists have many such matters, which are what men venerate. The great secret lies in the Emotional Elixir, the practice conforming to the Profound Teaching; yet wishes may not be fulfilled.’
