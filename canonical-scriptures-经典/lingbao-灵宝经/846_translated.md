Supreme Cavernous Mysterious Spiritual Treasure Admonition of Karma Fundamental Practice, Highest Grade Sublime Scripture

The Dao speaks: In ancient times, I dwelt in the Jade Terrace amid the Celestial Cavernous Altar of Danling, where I received the primal One Golden True Dharma Wheel, Admonition of Karma Fundamental Practice, Highest Grade, with the appellation of the Most High and Supreme and Cavernous Mysterious Great Dharma King who forever abides in the Jade Clarity, Supreme Great Enclosure Capital, commanding the Flying Celestials. The功 of the Dharma Wheel and the root of the admonition of karma opens the field of birth and death for all beings, the source of heavenly and human sin and blessing, bearing the three vehicles, ascending the steps of the Supreme Clarity, the tenfold perfected Man, brightness piercing the dark night, extending wide through the Ten Directions, turning the root of the Ten Evils, causing all to follow the Ten Good Deeds, all thereby attaining the direct birth into the boundless Great Enclosure Heaven; those who can follow thus shall obtain the true Dao.

The Dao speaks: I constantly, with the turning of the times, descend with the Flying Celestials of the Ten Directions to the primal birthplace of great blessing, the Cavernous Treasure Court, where I open this Dharma Wheel, the Ten Good Dharma Gates, causing all Ten Evils to be removed by the Dharma, and by this turning of the Dharma Wheel ascending to the heavens, all attain wondrous communication and the broad illumination of the fundamental practice. Of past karmic causes and conditions, I observe Heaven and Earth, and it is rare indeed to find such a man; unless he be of the utmost virtue, how can he serve thus?

The Dao speaks: The utmost practice of admonition of karma is for the virtue most exalted and far-reaching: the Golden True fundamental practice, the source of perpetual existence. One should rightly hold to good mindfulness; the demons dare not speak; all delusions and confusions are cut off; the heavenly beings attend to the true; for those beings who are evil, thou shalt not follow them, for their roots of sin are deep, and they must enter into my Dharma Wheel. When they bring forth calamity, contend not with them; to fall into the three evils is hard to recover from. Those who obstruct the Dao are ignorant; those who envy others are self-punishing; those who slander others have but just emerged from the animal path. Those who delight in lustful pleasures have not yet severed the root of the six kinds of beasts from their former karma. The greedy and cruel injure themselves; the greedy for taste swallow poison: such is the root of cruelty, one should keep far from it.

The Dao speaks: When the Primordial One Celestial Venerable was about to speak the admonition of karma fundamental practice, he pointed with his hand into the void of the Ten Directions, commanding the summoning of the Flying Celestial Kings of the Ten Directions, the Most True Sovereign Persons, the Flying Celestial Infinite Divine Kings, the Wondrous Practice Perfected Men, the Supreme Jade Emperor, the Infinite Great Saintly Venerable Spirits, the thirty-six Heavenly Emperors, the Heavenly Most True, the Nine Palaces Perfected Men, the Five Elders Supreme True, the Heavenly True and Earthly Immortals, the Infinite World Immortal Jade Maidens, the innumerable Great Saintly Multitude, the Officials of the Three Realms, the Three Primal True Law Officers and their attendants, the multitudes of the Unrestrained—all at one time journeyed together, riding the void and came, ascending to the Jade Capital of Celestial Light, the Four Bright Purple Canopy surrounding Heaven, their might and efficacy overwhelming, streaming over the Ten Directions, illuminating the heavens, burning incense and scattering flowers, flying the profound steps in emptiness, circling thrice returning to place, bowing their heads to pay homage to the true, ascending together the Golden True Dharma Wheel fields, looking up to the Dharma voice, none not joyful, all unanimously praising goodness.

The Dao speaks: The unsurpassed Golden True sincere karma is the universal flourishing root of sincere practice; men are very rare indeed to attain it. The celestial principle and wondrous purpose, the Most True practice of the highest, all the heavenly and human beings, born in empty calamities, create myriad evils, all released by evil means. The secret lies in the heart; establish the Dao field; universally turn the Dharma Wheel; illuminate the six paths; liberate heavens and men; lonely souls and suffering spirits ascend together to the blissful heavens, rejoicing lifelong, enduring through kalpas, all by the grace of the Dharma Wheel of the highest grade. At that time the great saints and multitudes of the heavenly Unrestrained simultaneously praised goodness, circling thrice to the left, folding hands in salutation, humbly receiving the admonition.

The Celestial Venerable said to the great saints and multitudes: I open the Golden True Dharma Wheel, operating transformation of causes; there are many difficulties, the hardest is the body. The body of utmost virtue is also but the domain of a country; the use of it may bring disaster; the mind is able to create; therefore it penetrates the realm of concealment and constraint; through the gates of good and evil only the perfect man knows and perceives, attains Dao and no action; if one can follow thus, faithfully receive and not forget.

The Celestial Venerable said to the great saints and multitudes: The primal qi is subtle and light; its movement is not pure; the fundamental karma is easy to create; movement leads to loss of the body; from the arising of the five hearts, the Ten Evils are born; long lost to the poisonous blade, who can awaken? Self-suffering is the pain. I am the source for turning and liberating birth and death of the heavenly and human beings of the Ten Directions; the Ten Good Deeds are fully established; awakening to all the causes of future births, humbly receiving admonition of karma, one immediately attains the true Dao.

The Celestial Venerable said to the Dao Lord: I open the Dharma Wheel of highest grade Golden True admonition of karma, the Ten Good Deeds original root, the gate of myriad practices; if thou follow it, all should humbly listen. Then the Dao Lord respectfully folded hands and humbly received the sincere text.

The Sincere Text says:  
First grade: Rightly observe the multitudes’ wondrous root, all attain spiritual power of karma.  
Second grade: Rightly hear the profound and wondrous sound, spirits inform the Ten Directions.  
Third grade: Rightly know the entering of incense light, spiritual power and numinous qi remain.

Seventh grade: Rightly contemplate no dual delusion, spiritual power is the realm of right Dao.

Ninth grade: Rightly fix the form and shadow unmoving among multitudes, spiritual power is wondrous awakening.  
Tenth grade: Rightly possess form and spirit, firm and bright, holding right, spiritual power is profound and wondrous.

The Celestial Venerable said: Golden True highest grade Ten Perfect spiritual power admonition of karma is the head of myriad practices, holding right the Ten Directions, the root of boundless subtle communication. I open the Dharma Wheel and therefore expound its text to cross kalpa calamities and obstructed birth and death; all thereby turn and ascend, attaining perpetual existence and true Dao accomplishment, never again seeing the gate of Ten Evils.

The Celestial Venerable said: The Golden True fundamental practice Ten grades, the merit of highest goodness.

The Celestial Venerable said to the Dao Lord: This is the unsurpassed Golden True fundamental practice of highest grade, purified and refined, empty and tranquil, universally called supreme karma. One who can thus act, Golden True is to be expected. I observe the heavenly and human beings, one in ten thousand; unless they be perfect men, none can follow.

The Celestial Venerable said: Golden True practice Ten grades, always able thus, myriad good deeds fully established.  
First grade: One who sees five colours but does not crave, lustful wind does not blow.  
Second grade: One who hears five sounds but does not listen, demon winds self-remove.

The Celestial Venerable said to the Dao Lord: I open the Golden True highest grade Dharma Wheel admonition of karma fundamental practice of the Ten Directions; if the heavenly and human beings can thus be, they are equal in功 with the Ten Sages, able to enter the realm of perpetual existence Dharma, attain Dao naturally, lifelong bright, celebrating through countless kalpas, blessings flowing to myriad generations, ever abiding with the Dharma Wheel without cessation.

The Celestial Venerable said: I open the Dharma Wheel of the Ten Sages’ fields.

Second grade turns through, knowing the world’s existence or not, good or evil events, position ranked as Awakened Sage.

Those heavenly and human beings knowing their hymns, cultivating fasting, incense offerings, and salutation recitations, the Dharma King descends truth; Dao accomplishment is not distant.

The Celestial Venerable said to the Dao Lord: I open the Dharma Wheel to turn the Ten Evil fields, highest grade blessings,功 limitless; quiet the heart and cease imagining, this is the highest virtue. Hearing music not hearing, floating gaudy beautiful colours, this is the root of Ten Evils; form is not everlasting, wealth not long preserved; the true Dao is unsurpassed; therefore I open the Dharma Wheel. The world has desires seeking truth and abandoning vulgar causes, preserving and strengthening primal qi, condensing plain naturalness; demonic arrivals opposing, beware speech and do not speak, evil arises and confusion, finally entering the Dharma Wheel; those who obstruct the Dao suffer, future bodies thus.

The unsurpassed Flying Celestial Dharma Wheel turning and liberating Ten Suffering grades Jade Scroll hymn is as follows:

Looking over the Ten Directions, immeasurable roots of sin, flowing with Ten Sufferings, body scorched and rotting, great and small connected, kalpas of torment, poisonous blade wounds the body, sinking through nine nights, difficult to return, reflecting on Ten Good Deeds, mindful of causes, enduring sharp pain, wind knives come and go, swallowing shade and poison, soul and spirit without rest; looking up to the unsurpassed, Flying Celestial Dharma Wheel opens liberation highest grade, turning through promotion, glorifying body at Jade Court, wondrous communication of Ten Heavens, Infinite Worlds, penetrating knowledge of conditions, cultivating sincere karma, bowing before the Dao.

The human heart pure, Ten Good Deeds descend; if born greedy karma evil, mind and things not pure; if harboring evil, thou shalt correct it. The Three Primes enforce the law, near within the body; secret matters all gathered, reported upwards to the heavens, the examining officers swiftly come, sitting to examine illness and harm. Try to follow the fundamental practice, goodness should be followed; no hearing of inverted views; thus know no cause; rightly possess form and spirit; morning and evening with reverence, true Dao descends, liberates thy blissful heavens.

Seventh grade: born body unfilial and unkind, birth and death difficulty;  
Eighth grade: born body in lawless country difficulty.  
These eight difficulties all arise from former bodies’ accumulated causes, emerging from Ten Sufferings, then born into Eight Difficulties. But the perfect man of highest virtue always with Ten Good Deeds as a standard for the future, born into Ten Directions boundless blissful halls. Those ignorant with inverted views always base themselves on the Ten Evils, causing birth and death to lose the Ten Good Deeds, one birth and one death, kalpas of suffering, always arising the Eight Difficulties retribution. I open the Dharma Wheel to liberate these people.

The unsurpassed Flying Celestial Dharma Wheel turning Eight Difficulties highest grade Jade Scroll hymn is as follows:

The evil is deep and grave, all due to former bodies harming myriad living things and boundless sentient beings’ lives, causing birth in those paths to repay past causes, one birth one death, karma matching its cause; now turning bodies, universally entering good roots, self-awakening to be born, all causes and conditions, birth and death receive grace, none not rejoicing.

The Celestial Venerable said: The Dharma Wheel opens and liberates the Three Evil Paths fields.  
First grade: hell closed and tormented;  
Second grade: hungry ghosts eating each other’s vexation suffering;  
Third grade: beasts of burden, mutual hatred and striking poison.  
Such as these, if sentient beings can transform, are born in the Three Evils;  
First grade born in the worm;  
Second grade born in the crow;  
Third grade born in the beast.  
Former body karma is the root of primal transgression, its sin heavy, causing this evil, accumulating through kalpas, deserving this retribution. I open the highest grade immeasurable Dharma Wheel to universally liberate these evils, returning to the gate of blessing.

The unsurpassed Flying Celestial Dharma Wheel Three Evil Paths highest grade Jade Scroll hymn is as follows:

Observing the Ten Directions middle, Infinite Worlds’ people;  
The proud and wealthy fear not sin, delighting in harming sentient beings;  
Uprising to attack their sovereigns, heedless of future suffering;

Raising hands followed by sword trees, blood flowing like stars;  
Sitting waiting in boiling cauldron, iron spikes piercing the body;  
Turning face entering hungry ghosts, hearing only cries of sorrow;  
Looking up at iron nets, feet stand in burning fire court;  
Six kinds of beasts mutually tearing and cutting, repaying past lives;  
Only seeing Ten Blessing Heavens riding light bearing full moon;  
Carefree outside the Three Realms, reciting the Three Treasures Sutra;  
Dharma King myriad good deeds, universally opening immeasurable功;

The Celestial Venerable said to the Dao Lord: I open the Dharma Wheel to turn the Ten Deviant and Unright Paths fields, highest grade practice. Behold, sentient beings’ greed and desire are inexhaustible; they cast their lives into the Ten Evils, entangle body and mind with suffering thoughts, enslaving themselves with crimes, discord filling Heaven and Earth, form and name becoming Dao, unlawful and false birth, promiscuity and evil qi, born without good teaching, death must have heavy review, kalpas casting body to butchery, birth and death coming and going, long abiding in blind paths, lifelong evil speech, disease and torment, finally returning to the Eight Gates.

Surveying all conditions, mystical transformation great motion,  
Together before true Dao.

The Celestial Venerable said to the Dao Lord: This Jade Scroll hymn is enshrined in the Unsurpassed Golden True Mysterious Palace, the Ten Directions golden boys and mysterious girls, each ten true, guarding and preserving the spiritual text, constantly following the great motion turning Ten Directions right Dao Dharma Wheel, reciting its hymn, voice penetrating the Ten Directions, the Nine Heavens primal sovereign folding hands in praise, Unsurpassed Jade Emperor bowing and saluting, then great luminous Dharma gate, to liberate the heavens, Infinite Worlds, myriad lives, all attaining body ascending Ten Right Paths blissful halls, all conforming to true Dao. The heavens’ great saints and most true who know their hymns, fasting and reciting, all attain liberation of multitudes’ suffering, also able to protect kalpas unmoved, firmly securing spiritual root.

The Celestial Venerable said to the Dao Lord: I open the Dharma Wheel Ten Turning fields, highest grade immeasurable true fundamental practice; none but the Dharma Wheel can turn it. Preserve truth and uphold Dao, with hope for these multitudes; from the first kalpa of beginning, those attaining Dao all enter the Dharma Gate, cultivate highest virtue, position reaching most true; none seen who are proud or rich yet hope to be born in heaven. I observe the Ten Directions multitudes, much clinging and knotting; wealth and treasures though precious, in the end cannot make men attain Dao; accumulating rare treasures must have leftover calamities; content in poverty and delight in Dao is the true treasure; on the day of Dao’s accomplishment, the Dao Lord descends a sign. Body clad in nine-colored precious robe, seven-colour flying gauze skirt, head wearing heaven-penetrating treasure crown, feet wearing jade-patterned lion shoes, neck bearing twin blazing heavenly lights, above covered by flowing bright treasure canopy, body ascending seven-treasure chariot, riding golden dragon, surpassing unsurpassed Dao realm, flourishing in feathered ceremonial dress, mighty light fragrant and neat, Brahma practice in great void, heavenly truths on left and right, hands holding ten supreme spiritual banners; the heavens all respectfully offer natural music and dance, burning incense scattering flowers, filling the Ten Directions; multitudes of true ones descend to welcome the sign; Jade Clarity heavenly treasure receiving position, perpetual Golden True.  
At that time truly delighting in this. These men all content in poverty and uphold Dao, thus attaining this; worldly customs flourish, insufficient for greed. Body engaged in Ten Evils, wealth immediately scattered; vast wealth, ultimately a poison gate. I open the Dharma Wheel, universally announcing to the Ten Directions Flying Celestial Most True, liberating the Ten Directions, Infinite Worlds, all sentient beings, all attaining accomplishment of fasting功 Tenfold Perfected Men.

The Celestial Venerable said: The Dharma Wheel opens Ten Turning most true fields.  
First grade: one who upholds admonition is an Earth Immortal;  
Able to cultivate Dharma admonitions, turns to second grade, becoming roaming Immortal;  
More focused on right heart, turns to third grade, becoming Immortal;  
Complying with admonition karma, turns to fourth grade, becoming Flying Immortal;  
Constantly following Sutras and admonitions, not transgressing multitudes, turns to fifth grade, becoming Spirit Immortal;  
Cutting off greed for taste, long fasting, reciting scriptures and holding precepts, turns to sixth grade, becoming Divine Immortal;  
If able to be free from lustful desire, equal in practicing all功德, abandoning heart and embracing plainness, turns to seventh grade, becoming True Immortal;  
Building heart broadly thinking of Ten Directions, always practicing rescue of distress, speech without fault, benefiting beings without bias, turns to eighth grade, becoming Flying Celestial Perfected Man;  
Guarding the one without movement, holding ten thousand good deeds, reverently mindful of Dharma admonitions, always as before gods, turns to ninth grade, becoming Supreme Perfected Man;  
Always able to eat mist and drink qi, austere practice cultivating Dao, reciting scriptures and incense offerings, morning and evening opening and enlightening Ten Directions, universally aiding boundless beings, benefiting Heaven and Earth, never wearied, turns to tenth grade, becoming unsurpassed Supreme Clarity Perfected Man.  
All things are naturally without mind; if one can practice the Eight Admonitions,  
One obtains功 with the Ten Directions Flying Celestials; how much more in holding the Ten Admonitions karma fundamental practice?  
But at the end kalpa sentient beings only break admonitions, how can there be those able to cultivate?  
Man’s five pollutions, numerous coarse practices; the perfect man upholds, regarding it as lifelong treasure; the coarse man receives and hopes for worldly high position, destroying the Ten Good Deeds’ practice, taking long to return to Ten Evils path; but men presume to bear Dao, not Dao bearing men; never have I seen those with heart seek and not obtain.
