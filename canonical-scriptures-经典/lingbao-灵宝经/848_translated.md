# The Great Offering Scripture of the Supreme Cavernous Mysterious Spiritual Treasure of the Three Primal Ones of the Jade Capital and Mysterious Metropolis

Title of the Scripture: The Great Offering Scripture of the Supreme Cavernous Mysterious Spiritual Treasure of the Three Primal Ones of the Jade Capital and Mysterious Metropolis. No original author is indicated. In Tang times, Xuan Yi in his Treatise on Verification calls this scripture “Created by the Daoist Liu Wudai, analogous to the Ullambana Festival.” The original text is one scroll, included in the Dongxuan section of the Zhengtong Daozang, a text with annotations and commentaries. There is also a Dunhuang fragment numbered S3061, without annotations. The present edition takes the Daozang text as the base, collated with the Dunhuang version.

The Great Offering Scripture of the Supreme Cavernous Mysterious Spiritual Treasure of the Three Primal Ones of the Jade Capital and Mysterious Metropolis

As for the Perfect Man’s subtle origin, it issues before the myriad phenomena; the great sage’s deep source transcends the six directions and beyond. Neither born nor perishing, surpassing the reach of hearing and seeing, without waiting or acting, beyond shape and name. Though profound, dark, mysterious and utterly unattainable, yet able to respond and transform without form; distant and vast as the void, yet truly aiding and benefiting all beings. Now, manifesting in the present as a golden form within the Golden Gate, displaying a hundred thousand dharma bodies; complete with jade slips in the Jade Capital, opening the essential scriptures of the five directions. Nothing but serves as bridge and path for all beings, enlightening the confused masses, responding to causes and conditions, stirring the mechanism and guiding transformation.

At this time, the Spiritual Treasure subtle origin is pure principle, calm and even; yet all sentient beings violate the true and lose the real, indulging in empty thoughts and false views, roaming in the six emotions, entangled in the nets of attachment, thus their karma sinks into the five turbidities, the sea of suffering boundless; wandering through the three paths, birth and death in their vast expanse. Unless led by the Perfect Man, there is no way out of suffering.

Our great sage, the Celestial Venerable, whose wisdom pervades emptiness and existence, whose rank surpasses the utmost heavens, whose Way penetrates the great net, opens the gate of myriad mysteries, reveals the realms of profound mystery, able with compassion to save beings, ever skilful in delivering men. Therefore, taking form in the West, manifesting in Shanyang, preaching beneath the mulberry forest.

Offering treasures of jade to adorn, emitting wondrous signs amid clouds and mist, scattering spiritual incense through the pure realm. Everywhere opening subtle marks, smiling as he exhales the five lights; encircling and illuminating the heavens, shining the divine radiance through the ten realms. Pitying the beings suffering in evil destinies, in the dark three paths, overwhelmed by eight hardships, at the request of the Dao Lord, he reveals the cause of evil and retribution, expounds the signs preceding fortune and misfortune, and discusses the merit and practice of deliverance.

Therefore he unfolds this Great Offering of the Mysterious Metropolis, to teach men and heavens alike. He universally wishes that the five paths may remove the root of sin, that the four births may restore their registration of life.

This scripture is titled The Great Offering Scripture of the Supreme Cavernous Mysterious Spiritual Treasure of the Three Primal Ones of the Jade Capital and Mysterious Metropolis. A scripture is grounded in responsive influence, its substance is compassionate rescue, its function is the expression of vows. Yet the present title explanations vary in detail, some generally interpreting the two vehicles, others briefly treating the three treasures, all are later conjectures unrelated to the original intention of the scripture’s title. Now, having investigated the name and principle, examined the matters and traces, we set forth its essentials in a single phrase, dividing the title into two parts. The first six characters are the general title; the last eight clarify its specific title. Within the general title, two parts appear: first, the characters “Supreme” indicate the Celestial Venerable’s holy name, showing the sage who speaks it; second, “Cavernous Mysterious Spiritual Treasure” reveals the profound name of the supreme teaching, clarifying the orthodox dharma taught.

First, the exalted holy name: “Supreme” means great and grand, indicating its essence; “Upper” means esteemed, indicating its virtue. This shows that the Celestial Venerable’s virtue is lofty and unsurpassed, his essence vast and infinite, both virtue and essence revealed, thus called Supreme.

Second, clarifying the orthodox dharma, “Cavernous” means thorough and uniting; “Mysterious” means deep and far-reaching. This says the scripture’s subtle principle is profound and clear, the true path vast and unbounded, penetrating without obstruction, united without separation — hence “Cavernous.” Deep and difficult to fathom, far and endless — hence “Mysterious.” Thus called Cavernous Mysterious. “Spiritual Treasure” means spirit-transforming and unfathomable; “Treasure” means precious and valuable. This says this wondrous scripture’s principle is subtle and mysterious, spirit-transforming and unfathomable, encouraging practitioners to treasure it. Thus the Tao Te Ching says: “I have three treasures, precious and to be held.” This is its meaning.

Next, the specific title is also in two parts. The first eight characters “Three Primal Ones Great Offering” indicate the scripture’s purpose. The latter single character “Scripture” indicates the general designation of dharma teaching.

The first clarifies the scripture’s purpose: The Three Primal Ones wish to manifest the retribution of good and evil, the subtle methods of admonition and encouragement, therefore the Upper, Middle, and Lower Primal Ones are described to explain this. All sentient beings, birth and death registration, the records of good and evil, are all under the Three Primal Ones’ nine offices — the three officials of heaven, earth, and water — examining and verifying merits and demerits with no error. The three Primal Ones are: the fifteenth day of the first month is the Upper Primal One, the Heavenly Official’s inspection; the fifteenth day of the seventh month is the Middle Primal One, the Earthly Official’s inspection; the fifteenth day of the tenth month is the Lower Primal One, the Water Official’s inspection. All sentient beings are under the governance of these three officials of heaven, earth, and water.

Thus, the fifteenth day of the first month is the Upper Primal One, the Heavenly Official’s audit. Yang begins on November the first, Yang beings on the third day of the first month; three Yang make Qian. Qian is Heaven’s function. The heavenly way’s numbers complete in the first month, thus the Heavenly Officials mainly undertake the audit. Similarly, the fifteenth day of the seventh month is the Middle Primal One, the Earthly Official’s audit. Yin begins on May the first, Yin two begins on the second of the sixth month, Yin three begins on the seventh month; three Yin make Kun. Kun is Earth’s function. In July Kun Qi is dominant; thus all Earthly Officials undertake the audit. The fifteenth day of the tenth month is the Lower Primal One, the Water Official’s audit. The tenth month is Hai, belonging to the north; the north is Kan, Kan is water’s place; it is precisely the time when the Water Official builds his reign, thus all Water Officials undertake the audit. The three Primal Ones signify the source. These three officials are the basis of all things’ functioning, thus called the Three Primal Ones.

The Jade Capital is the name of the mountain realm of the Three Pure Ones. The Mysterious Metropolis is the palace name in the Great Net Heaven. The Great Offering refers to this scripture’s universal audit of men and heavens, modeled on the Great Offering Methods of the Mysterious Metropolis, to rescue and redeem all lost spirits, wishing its practice to be widespread, hence called the Great Offering. It shows the Celestial Venerable’s compassion for all beings, hence the emission of divine light. The Dao Lord pities the masses, and to transmit the scripture explains the officials of heaven, earth, and water, the three officials, nine offices, one hundred and twenty departments, four supervisors, five emperors who examine and record the various officials, each ascending at the dawn of the Three Primal Ones to the Mysterious Metropolis officials to audit and determine good and evil in men and heavens, sorting the birth and death registration books. All good deeds are recorded, the underworld’s punishments and banishments have no redemptions. The scripture fully records the proper methods of deliverance. Therefore, from the sovereign down to the common people, if they meet this treasure scripture and practice according to its text, exploring its flowers, fruits, and myriad fragrant flavours, fully furnishing all earthly rare and wondrous objects, arranging emotions and fostering resolve, constructing great offering trays, various decorations, devoutly offering, the ten directions’ saints will clearly witness and distinguish; the Three Generations’ Celestial Venerables, flowing grace to give and receive — this is the scripture’s stated purpose.

The latter clarifies the general designation of dharma teaching. Tracing through the Three Caverns’ true texts, the seven divisions of mysterious teaching, examining their titles, the simple name is “scripture.” Thus “scripture” is the general name of dharma teaching, the grand model of the Perfect Man. The excellence of scripture is great indeed; it is the vessel and ship of all varieties.

However, scriptures are of many kinds, roughly three. First, the Five Virtues and Three Primal Ones, condensed in cloudy seals, casting rays in eight directions, secret and wondrous texts. Second, green forests and violet pens, golden slips with jade letters, wrapped in phoenix patterns, stored in the seven treasures’ mysterious terrace, sometimes in mountain caves, sometimes above the heavens. Third, slips and silk papers, seal and clerical script as time requires, transmitted and circulated, seen in practice through the ages. Though also three traces, the subtlety differs; all are the Celestial Venerable’s expounding in fullness, all able to heal sickness, all named good medicine.

The meanings and instructions of the scripture are of many paths. Setting forth their essentials, they are briefly explained as four:

First, the path; second, the way; third, the method; fourth, the constant.

The first, the path, means that the Three Generations’ Celestial Venerables and the ten directions’ saints all obtain the Way through path scriptures and precepts; hence it is called path.

The second, the way, can open and pass through all things, guide and reach the four births, serve as the bridge of study, the essential way of true cultivation; hence called way.

The third, the method, is that which is the subtle and wondrous purpose, leading to the subtle essence; able to regulate all living beings, model the saints; hence called method.

The fourth, the constant, means not only the subtle principle is deep and remote, calm and condensed, but also the Three Generations’ Dharma Kings’ unalterable transmissions. Having these four meanings, it is rightly called scripture.

Within this single scroll also are four parts:

First, from the beginning to the thorough illumination of the heavens, called the preface division;

Second, from then the saints descend, to the difficulty of deliverance, called the correct discourse division;

Third, from then the Supreme Dao Lord receives the command, to the end of the praise, called the general transmission division;

Fourth, from then the holy assembly, called the conclusion.

Within the preface division are five parts:

First, the gathering of the Celestial Venerable and disciples;

Second, from all being in the Western Jade Kingdom, clarifying the pure land’s location;

Third, from the spreading of golden offerings and white jade-edged steps, to the full account of the land’s adornment;

Fourth, from yellow clouds fourfold entwined and purple mists thrice wound, showing auspicious signs;

Fifth, at this time the Celestial Venerable smilingly manifests his majesty.

The Great Offering Scripture of the Supreme Cavernous Mysterious Spiritual Treasure of the Three Primal Ones of the Jade Capital and Mysterious Metropolis

The Primordial Celestial Venerable, with the Supreme Dao Lord, the ten directions’ great saints, flying heavenly kings, and 7,240 children, are all in the Western Jade Kingdom, on Mount Yucha, the floating Luo peak among the long mulberry forest.

Explanation: This is the opening of the teaching and the origin of the path, fulfilling the sights of the wise and saints; it is the first, showing the gathering of the Celestial Venerable and disciples, clarifying the pure land’s location. The Primordial Celestial Venerable is the great name of the utmost saint, the great title of generation; his depth reaches the boundless ocean, hard to speak of. Near teachings and traces justify his title. “Primordial” means the very first; “Celestial Venerable” expresses his loftiness. Thus called Primordial Celestial Venerable. The Supreme Dao Lord is the sage who has attained the Way. The flying heavenly kings are the spirits of free wisdom. The children have no desires within, no seeking without; their essential nature is intact, calm and condensed. All are in the Western Jade Kingdom, Mount Yucha, Floating Luo peak. This is the pure land’s location, the wondrous realm of the Jade Capital, the upper firmament of the blue void. Also said of the land’s people: pure and clean white, like white jade, freshly arrayed in frost, hence called the Jade Kingdom. Further, the mountain named Yucha, the peak called Floating Luo, the forest with long mulberry, forms the title. The scripture’s place of preaching is thus fully stated. Like Confucius fixing the book, Laozi expounding scripture at Hangu Pass — once the holy men of scripture are named, their places of teaching and residence are also made evident, with their rare and precious attributes.

Golden offerings spread upon the earth, white jade edging the steps, seven treasures sparkling, light shining like the sun; yellow clouds fourfold entwined, purple mists thrice wound, fragrant light entwined with the blue, overflowing the void.

Explanation: This is the Celestial Venerable’s dwelling place, the third part describing the land’s adornment and showing auspicious signs. “Spread” means to cover. The place where he preaches is wholly spread with gold, the steps’ edges bound with white jade. The seven treasures are gold, silver, lapis lazuli, coral, amber, agate, and pearl. “Sparkling” is another name for jade. The Celestial Venerable’s dwelling is adorned with many treasures, splendid and beautiful, radiating brilliance, shining through the ten directions, illuminating the heavens, bright as sun and moon, hence “light shining like the sun.” The yellow clouds fourfold entwined, purple mists thrice wound denote auspicious signs. Yellow is the central region’s color. Also true colors present auspiciousness, joyous clouds manifesting signs, all gathered at once from four sides, thick and dense, surrounding the path.

Again, purple air and light mists, swirling thrice, the spiritual wind fans, fragrant vapors pervade, thick and dense through the void, as an offering.

Explanation: Without further ado, speaking of the purple mist, vermilion and black mixed make purple mist. Vermilion stands for yang, the Way; black for yin, virtue. The Celestial Venerable’s virtue and Way are like a compassionate cloud, shading all beings, grace as great as parents’. Yet the upper heaven’s treasures, refined and elegant decorations, their retribution is natural and unlike mundane things; the music and wonder also respond in distinction.

The great heavenly music, wondrous and refined tones, myriad sounds interweaving.

Explanation: Heavenly music means the natural wondrous sound. Great music means extraordinary melody. Hence wondrous and refined tones. “Myriad sounds interweaving” means the sounds played come naturally, a thousand and ten thousand modes entertaining the Celestial Venerable. The heavens present their treasures and play refined music; the Celestial Venerable rejoices, manifesting his spiritual form.

The Celestial Venerable smiling, five-colored radiance issues from his mouth, illuminating the heavens.

This is the Venerable’s joy manifesting his spiritual form, the fifth part showing the manifestation of majesty. From the beginning to here is the entire preface division. The Celestial Venerable is ever mobile; thus always smiling, shining like the spring scene, wherever his grace reaches, all are illuminated. But with clear Dao eye, the assembly of saints all together can suitably see.

At that time, the saints all gathered in one place, universally seeing worlds without limit in the ten directions, both hells and heavens.

This means the saints riding the Venerable’s majesty, in hell none fail to behold. “At that time” means when the Venerable preaches. “The saints” is a general term; all together universally see, unaware of the punishments in hell.

Prisoners and exiles, hungry ghosts and dead spirits, naked and without clothing, necks and feet bound with chains.

This shows the beings’ past karma, failing to cultivate good roots, committing all evil, dying and entering hell and hungry ghost paths, naked and emaciated, heads and necks shackled. Yet hungry ghosts and dead spirits have no clothing; around their necks are locks, on their feet chains. They do not know the bitterness in between is extreme.

Standing on sword trees, heads wearing fire mountains.

These are consequences received according to causes and conditions; it is not only hunger and nakedness, but also bearing iron staffs, standing on sword trees, heads wearing fiery mountains, burning and cutting with pain unbearable. Or heads burning coals, feet standing on knife mountains, forced and driven by iron staffs, limbs bound with chains, unable to move, for myriad kalpas enduring this punishment. Such beings, having suffered this pain, what other types remain unknown?

Small and large bound together, five bodies rotten and decayed, heads and faces scorched and burned, boiled and soaked in cauldrons, countless pains cutting their bodies.

Explanation: Such appearances can be known from the text, all owing to past lives shooting birds, killing beings, setting nets, flying hawks and running dogs, hollowing wombs and probing eggs, cooking in cauldrons, committing many offenses, thus receiving these retributions.

Golden hammers wildly beating, no rest in eating or breathing, hungry eating charcoal, thirsty drinking fiery essence.

This is the karma of evil beings, many crimes committed; hoarding food excessively, the hungry ghost’s retribution body. In hunger seeking food, eating becomes fire and charcoal; in thirst seeking to drink, water becomes fiery essence. This is due to stinginess and greed, blocking merits. All scriptures clearly state this, not only said here.

For myriad kalpas continually in the hungry ghost path. The assembly’s compassion praises infinite good deeds, at once raising hands and snapping fingers, respectfully saluting and seeking the sound of the saving Sages, wishing for lives of generations not to be stingy or greedy, blocking merit, receiving such retribution. Not only in the hungry ghost path, but also in other places, wandering in the three paths and five sufferings.

This says not only one place of retribution, but also wandering throughout the three paths and eight hardships, all pervasive. The three paths are the hell path, the animal and hungry ghost paths. The five sufferings are embracing the copper pillar, treading on knife mountains, circling sword trees, entering boiling cauldrons, swallowing fire and charcoal. Along with the three path hells, these are called the eight hardships. Yet the saints’ compassion is ever mindful; since such pain is so severe, questions arise, next is the inquiry.

The Dao Lord bows and reports to the Celestial Venerable: Not yet knowing these sinners, in their lives what sins and causes arose to suffer such bitter pain? Humbly requesting the Venerable to graciously instruct, to reveal the unheard, that if enlightened, they may gratefully receive the holy grace.

This shows the Dao Lord asking, wishing all the unenlightened to know and hear. The Dao Lord is a sage, already aware of karma and retribution; here he asks to instruct and thus to teach beings. Having asked of causes, how does the Venerable answer?

The Venerable said: These sinners all arise from past causes not seeing the bright teaching, not hearing the dharma’s sound; stingy and greedy without measure, killing the innocent; mouth says one thing, heart another; imprisoning and restraining sages; drinking wine and eating meat; disturbing the five spirits.

This is the cause explained by the Celestial Venerable and Dao Lord. All such words are the evil karma of beings. Yet the Great Dao’s Celestial Venerable is compassionate in rescue, his divine light spreading everywhere, shining far in the ten directions; thus he has the Dao Lord bear his majesty, the questions once known, he respectfully pleads to fully explain causes. This karma and obstruction of sinners are former offenses, not seeing the bright and holy teaching, not hearing the true dharma’s spiritual sound; only busy with stinginess and greed, not honoring merit, closing the path to heaven, causing hell’s cause, immersed in the river of attachment, wandering birth and death. The five spirits are the five visceral spirits of soul, spirit, essence, and will. Yet drinking wine and eating meat, the karma is deep; not only disturbing the five spirits, but also revolving through the eight hardships, so that the six roots and three karmas broadly commit offenses, hiding evil and latent resentment, body and mind unwholesome, wantonly killing life, greed and stinginess without cause, losing the Way and straying from truth, not knowing return and dedication; once entering hell, never to escape.

Cursing and abusing, shouting to deities, deceiving masters and misleading the Way, defiling and insulting the three luminaries, usurping the ruler and killing the father, invading and oppressing clan and kin.

Such meaning is clear. But in cursing, hoping former men to early ruin, calling gods and blowing ghosts, nothing not done. Such words are many and cannot be fully recounted. These words indicate past life foolishness and arrogance, heart without awe, increasing pride, sometimes deceiving or mocking masters, slandering true saints, defiling sun and moon, slighting stars and constellations, disloyal as minister, unfilial as son, usurping and killing the ruler and father. Sages abhor this, taking the gradual harm, hence called usurp and murder. The Book of Changes says: minister killing ruler, son killing father, not a matter of one day or night, but gradually arising. Usurp means to seize, murder to kill. Sages hate it, changing its name.

Harboring flattery and deceit, not remembering all beings, secretly stealing and robbing, babbling without cause, cutting and seizing merit and virtue for one’s own gain. Unwilling to give alms, scattering alms to the poor. Now receiving this pain to repay old grudges.

Their eyes are such; these all are deeds done among men, their meaning can be known. Flattery means seeking favour. Alms giving means using what one has to relieve others’ urgency, distributing evenly, called alms. Zhuangzi says: “Green wheat grows on the mountain slopes; if it does not give to others, how shall it carry pearls in death? In life it fears attack and robbery; in death it fears the digging up of tomb and coffin.” But worldly evil karma is very many, difficult to exhaust in speech; in general outline, the categories include such as these.

The Celestial Venerable then speaks in sequence a verse.

The Venerable, following the previous questioning and answering order, reiterates the meaning, explaining in detail, the verse’s name is “verse.” A verse is another name for praise. Reiterating its meaning, hence in the Book of Changes it is called a verse.

“Usurping and killing ruler and father, killing the innocent; in death struck with golden hammers, iron staffs never leaving the body.”

This is the verse’s text. In the previous text usurp and murder was last; now in the verse it is first. But ruler and father are of supreme importance from antiquity, without killing among the three thousand rules; hence the verse names these first. This reiterates the meaning of usurping ruler and father in the main text.

“Entering others’ homes in darkness, plundering their wealth; souls die in the underworld prison, unable to leave through myriad kalpas.”

This meaning can be understood. Hence the Zhuangzi says: “Those who do evil in the open are punished by men; those who do evil in darkness are punished by ghosts. Those clear to men and ghosts can pass unscathed.” Thus knowing the underworld is not deceivable, the spirit way hard to cheat; all offenses are recorded without loss, good and evil’s retribution follows like shadow and form; once plunged into the three paths, for myriad kalpas there is no release. This reiterates the main text’s stealing and robbery sin.

“Luxurious and lustful, defiling the three luminaries; souls suffer imprisonment, future lives are insane and mad.”

This explains bodily karma and sin. It says that evil-doers indulge without limit, greedy for lust and desire; seeking subtle and smooth, offending sun, moon, and stars, not respecting the three luminaries. After punishment, when reborn as man, though given human body, they suffer madness and folly in retribution. This clarifies bodily karma sin. Next is mouth karma, then intention, as follows.

“Fierce and violent in speech, causing strife among relatives; dying suffering molten copper poured down throat; future lives always barking as dogs.”

This explains mouth karma. Those with mouth karma speak deceitfully, spreading false words, stirring strife among relatives, making right into wrong, breaking harmony, creating troubles and misfortunes, harming others; dying entering hell, molten copper poured into mouth; after death reborn as dogs, always barking at people.

“Eating lives of beings, drinking wine and disordering the five spirits; dying suffering in boiling cauldrons, iron staffs never leaving the body.”

This refers to those eating others’ lives, drinking wine and eating meat, heedless of beings, causing the five visceral spirits to become confused and disordered; mouth greedy and gluttonous, unaware of karma and retribution following them; at death sinking into hell, boiling cauldrons and fiery coals, body seared, countless pains joining, never leaving the body. This reiterates the main text’s drinking and eating meat sin.

“Babbling with falsehood as truth, deceiving and enticing the foolish for self-benefit; dying suffering tongue pulled out, future lifeless speech.”

This refers to liars, practicing deceit, cheating and misleading the foolish for self-benefit, cunningly plotting many devices, always acting unlawfully for self-interest. After death their souls sink to hell, suffering tongue-pulling punishment; after sin’s completion and rebirth, left mute. This clarifies the sin of false speech, covering the main text’s babbling without cause.

“Deceiving masters, not believing the Way; shouting to gods and spirits; wandering through three paths, future lives as beasts.”

This refers to deceiving and confusing teachers, slandering true saints, scorning the three treasures, defiling spiritual scriptures, causing distinctions in the Way; speaking roughly and harshly, cursing and abusing words, calling on gods and blowing horns; binding evil karma, falling into the three paths, revolving through death and birth. After punishment, rebirth in six beasts’ forms, sinking and delayed in many bodies, losing the human path. This clarifies the sin of deceiving heaven, covering the main text’s deceiving masters and shouting to gods.

“Slandering and striking sages, flattery and twisting without cause; dying falling to poisonous beasts’ stings; restless without any joy.”

This refers to slander and defamation, secretly attacking sages, flattering and cunningly plotting, spreading falseness; taking on bee and wasp bodies, or becoming snakes, vipers, and poisonous insects; successively spreading, restless and filthy, suffering birth after birth, no knowledge of joy. From fierce violent speech to here sums up mouth karma’s retribution.

Below follows intention karma:

“Reducing and cutting merit and virtue, encouraging stingy greed; dying as hungry ghosts, hungry and thirsty, drinking fiery essence.”

This clarifies intention karma. Though venerating goodness, reducing self and body, giving alms and making scriptures and images for preservation; yet some greedy among men cut off merit and virtue. Though temporarily profiting self, the sin follows like shadow and form; at death falling to hungry ghosts, hungry then eating fire and charcoal. The sin of greed brings such retribution, myriad kalpas and thousands of lives, never hearing the name of pure water, hungry eating charcoal, thirsty drinking fiery essence. This clarifies greed sin, covering main text’s cutting merit for self-benefit.

“Disrespecting elders, not revering the Daoists; future life low and base, reborn in six beasts’ forms.”

This clarifies right and wrong, self and other; not revering teachers, insulting elders, and thus reborn lowly. Born without reverence for the three treasures, dying in six beasts’ bodies. Karma follows without omission. Or born in border lands, lowly and distant barbarians, though receiving human body, never hearing the three treasures’ names, the true scripture and right dharma, rarely meeting the holy teaching and spiritual scripture, how can they see it? Cutting merit and virtue thus far clarifies intention karma.

The Venerable having spoken the verse, the Dao Lord bows and requests.

Having the Venerable spoken this verse, the Supreme Dao Lord advances, bows, and reports to the Celestial Venerable: “Today’s meeting is joyous beyond words. The Venerable graciously condescends, revealing the root of sin. Not yet knowing these sinners, all have dependents, present relatives; indeed for the present body there are no descendants.”

The Venerable having finished the verse, the Dao Lord doubts and will ask: if not taught deliverance, beings have no way out of suffering’s gate. Hoping for the method of saving, thus earnestly requests; advancing bows and salutes, respectfully speaking. The Celestial Venerable compassionate, grants to instruct and guide; hearing the command, rejoicing beyond words. The Dao Lord also knows sentient beings’ genders and descendants, unbroken through generations; wishing to teach their offspring, to save ancestors, thus raises inquiry to arouse later meaning.

The Celestial Venerable said: Though men and women bear past karma roots, not cultivating merit, not making causes and conditions, how can they be exempt? Revolving and increasing, sinking in the field of sin, countless kalpas’ hardship, no way to return. All evil fully committed, hope to return is endless.

The Venerable said: Their descendants, men, women, and children, lacking merit, have only hell causes and conditions, revolving and multiplying, increasingly heavy; finally sorrowful souls suffering, sinking and delayed, falling back into filth of sin, the heart field planted with former evil karma. Also, those accumulating evil grow sins like wild thornbush fields; even if five grains and good sprouts fall therein, finally engulfed and lost, unable to grow shoots or fruit; hence called field of sin. The Venerable, seeing the depth of hell’s sin, will speak of the difficulty of rescue to evoke further inquiry.

The Dao Lord bows and again asks the Venerable: What causes bring release from all suffering? What merit and virtue lead to return among men?

Explanation: The Dao Lord pities beings sinking in hell, again asks to establish merit fields, wishing filial sons and obedient grandchildren to remember ancestors’ suffering, loving brothers and obedient younger brothers to recall kin’s ruin, reducing family wealth to mutually rescue. Hence this question is raised, emphasizing merit fields. Below the Venerable explains the sins, differing in class, to create the Great Offering deliverance method. This is divided in three parts:

First, sins are many and diverse, ultimately hard to rescue;

Second, the Primordial’s audit to make them recognize and return to veneration;

Third, at that time all follow the ritual, urged to imitate.

The Venerable said: These sinners’ crimes are many and varied, not of one kind. If one wishes deliverance, it is also difficult to be the same. No one’s power can suffice to save and exempt.

This is the first, clarifying sins are many and diverse, ultimately hard to rescue. The Venerable says their karma roots follow, sin roots hard to remove, but establishing merit and planting fields is a broad wish unshifting, expiating sin and removing calamity. Not by quantity of merit alone can one overcome. If by one person’s power, multitudes of evil cannot be saved. Hence those who do evil are ultimately hard to save; unless many accumulate causes and plant merit fields, without relying on many causes, how can deliverance be achieved? Having thus merit, what is desired? Next follows merits.

One should follow the Mysterious Metropolis Great Offering method, on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, the Middle Primal One’s time, Earth Official’s audit, selecting many, sorting good and evil; all the heavenly great saints universally come to the palace, arranging the kalpa counts; human and ghost records, hungry ghosts and prisoners all assembled at once.

This is the second part, making them recognize and return to veneration. It means the Celestial Venerable’s Three Primal One great meeting day, along with the nine offices’ audit reason, fully explaining the morning of examination, entrusting the officials to decide good and evil; so that future beings, according to this Three Primal One day, each ascends to emulate the Jade Capital Mysterious Metropolis Great Offering ritual, offering to the Three Generations’ Celestial Venerables, ten directions’ saints, nine mysteries, seven ancestors, dharma realm beings, all gaining the cause of deliverance and liberation. This fifteenth day of the seventh month is the Middle Primal One, Earth Official’s audit day. The ten directions’ saints all gather; thus Heavenly, Water Officials and all departments, five hundred and fifty-five million five thousand five hundred and fifty-five billion sages all assemble, arranging kalpa numbers, inspecting sinners’ degrees of guilt and rank, intending to on this day offer supply, redeem parents and ancestors’ spirits; the ritual’s use is unknown.

By day and night burning incense and lamps, illuminating the heavens and nine underworlds, through the long night in the eight gates. Making the Mysterious Metropolis Great Offering, imitating Jade Capital Mountain, gathering various flowers and fruits, according to five colors, using all wondrous and rare worldly items, Daoist utensils and treasures, silk and brocade, ornaments and dress, ten excellent banners, canopies and adornments, offering implements, delicacies and drinks, myriad fragrant flavours; presenting to the saints and Daoists.

Explanation: This is the third, showing the ritual of practice and urging imitation. The five colors are blue, yellow, red, white, black. Interweaving these five colored banners to make flags and canopies, adorning offerings. The Venerable seeing the hell sinners’ suffering, moved for countless kalpas, thus commands filial care for parents, collecting all worldly rare and wondrous fruits and items, imitating the Mysterious Metropolis Jade Capital, as implements of offering, presented to the ten directions’ saints and Daoists, rescuing and redeeming the past ancestors’ hell suffering. May the nine mysteries, seven ancestors, dharma realm beings, relying on this cause of offering, also protect the heaven’s retribution. He wishes to bend the ten directions’ saints and Daoists to create what merit?

On this day and night reciting this scripture, the ten directions’ great saints jointly chant the spiritual chapters; prisoners and hungry ghosts all obtain liberation, together full, free from all suffering, returning to human realm. Without this, delivery is difficult.

Explanation: The Venerable broadly expounds the dharmas, hoping to urge causes. Fearful that true faith is rare, thus repeatedly entrusting. Whenever the Great Offering is ordered, he commands inviting the dharma masters to daily six times fast and lecture. “Day and night” means the present night of the fifteenth day of the seventh month. On this day fasting and lecturing should be done, burning incense and lamps, illuminating the heavens and nine underworlds, within the eight gates. The nine underworlds are the nine hells; the eight gates are the eight hardships, all places where beings suffer punishment. At this Three Primal Ones all-day, imitating Mysterious Metropolis Jade Capital Great Offering method, fully furnishing all worldly rare and wondrous fruits and flavours, myriad fragrant tastes, offering to the Three Treasures.

Then the ten directions and Daoists, moved by these supreme words, chant and recite, up to the nine hundred million, down through the six heavens, hell sinners all at once liberated. After my past and future, east is not utterly good, west not utterly evil; suffering county gentlemen will occupy the great Qin.

Explanation: When the Venerable spoke this scripture, he said after my past there will be successive teachers, generation after generation, always a sage wise king, inheriting the Three Treasures. East is not utterly good, west not utterly evil means the east is not purely good without evil, the west not purely evil without good. “Suffering county gentlemen” refers to Laozi’s incarnation, the mysterious jade girl cutting her left armpit and born in Chen County’s Suffering County, hence the name. At the birth, walking nine steps in the directions, then able to speak, self-claimed Li family; heaven and earth, only I alone supreme. Then nine dragons leap from the earth, spouting water to bathe. The dragon’s place became nine wells, still seen today. Also said Laozi incarnate in the three realms’ fire house and sea of suffering, also a suffering county. “Will occupy the great Qin” means the western India region’s other name. “Will” means to go. Laozi went west to flowing sands, reaching Yanbin, teaching Buddhist doctrine to transform the Rong customs. The Later Han History says: Laozi spoke the Buddhist sutras to transform the Rong customs. The Buddhist sect values purity; now the Buddhist sutras are those spoken by Laozi, but due to monastics’ ignorance, mistaken additions and false meanings, former sages confused, later men forged and reversed the truth, leading each other astray, the pure teaching thus spoiled.

Chinese texts compete, deceit and error multiply. The pure and scattered become diluted, evil and false flourish. The limitless world’s men and women, by nature habitually stingy and greedy, die as hungry ghosts, souls hungry and thirsty, given food they cannot eat, turning into dust.

Explanation: The heretical errors not yet cut off, proceeding in fraudulence, the Limitless World is this land’s name, also named Yanfu world. But the land’s beings are delicate and strange, perverse and inverted, confused and muddled, already stingy and greedy, self and other confused, die as hungry ghosts, repaying past offenses, turning from food into dust, seen but unable to enter mouth.

Great kalpas’ hardship, sinking in misery and ruin. Revolving through the five paths, repaying past grudges. Therefore now tell, should follow this. Future men and women should be diligent and strive, exerting effort, not to be cause of sin.

Explanation: Great means vast. Saying through vast kalpas always in hungry ghosthood. Even if suffering further and released, reborn in lowly houses, revolving through five paths, never able to become sage. The five paths are heaven, human, animal, hell, hungry ghost. The Venerable further urges the Dao Lord to say: Future men and women should restrain themselves, mind diligent in resolve, not making sin cause. Sin cause is karma. Saying men’s good and evil actions reap respective retribution, like farming and harvesting, each according to kind, spring sowing autumn harvest, hence sin field.

At that time the Supreme Dao Lord received the command, bowed and saluted, and spoke a verse.

This is called the Path Naming Portion. “At that time” means when the Venerable finished preaching and entrusted the former Dao Lord. The Supreme Dao Lord having heard the Venerable speak this Great Offering deliverance scripture, and the present and future life admonitions, diligently teaching, announcing the transmigration, bowed before the Venerable, praising its beauty, upholding the wondrous meaning, rejoicing beyond words. Goodness is inconceivable; therefore he spoke a verse.

“In past lives had cause to meet, now able to see the Celestial Venerable; first telling the present kalpa ended, then warning the future kalpa’s faults.”

Explanation: This is the Dao Lord’s own joy; thus he made a verse, praising the Venerable’s past, present, and future life path causes meeting; thus able to personally receive the supreme Way, to behold the Venerable. Also granted instruction on causes for deliverance, giving teachings and commands, quickly turning the dharma wheel, vowing to diligently practice, not to slack. Past and future kalpas all under Dao’s grace. The “future kalpa’s faults” are his second point. The latter Dao Lord admonishes beings’ greed, anger, and ignorance sins, thus speaking this verse. Yet those greedy like to accumulate wealth, seeking broadly possessions, only pursuing arrogance and luxury, not honoring merit, heart without compassion, not thinking of beings, in this life not planting merit fields, after death sinking into evil paths; such retribution is surely without doubt. All such are past lives not cultivating good works, later suffering their calamities; such is the depth of future kalpa’s faults.

“Diligently practice the supreme Way, do not resent the world; greed and desire cause great harm, anger and ignorance bring calamity.”

Explanation: This verse admonishes sins of greed, anger, and ignorance. The Dao Lord wishes to awaken the confused multitude, thus composing this praise explaining their origins, sources of fortune and misfortune. Greed is the body’s accumulated trouble; anger and ignorance are the roots of ruin. Hence briefly stating their cause, urging to cut them off. Also the Dao Lord having opened the Celestial Venerable’s teaching, then expounds it, as admonition for the future; but wealth, colour, fame, and gain are the source of calamity; greed, anger, and ignorance are the root of self-destruction. How can this be cultivating truth, obstructing human conduct, or losing merit fields? If these three poisons do not arise, the six roots remain pure; that is the way of cultivation, not touched by dust, can be the bridge to deliver suffering; what disaster else?

Cutting off vexation barriers, the three karmas are naturally free; evil demons cannot disturb, how then encounter hell’s hardship?

Explanation: Vexations arise from causes of the three karmas; evil demons disturb arising from the six roots. Only by embracing the Way and holding true can dust touch not adhere. Like the beginning of disorderly mind, lust is first. Hell’s cause is rooted in evil lust. If one wishes to cut off vexations, then one must be free and seek the cause of long-lasting happiness, which is the six roots unsoiled. If one can cultivate the Venerable’s teaching, always on the Mysterious Metropolis Great Offering days offering to the ten directions’ Venerables, then roaming before the Golden Gate, long free of hell’s affliction.

Roaming the jade garden, rising steps in the seven treasures’ park; wandering free, without desire, bowing and saluting the Celestial Venerable.

Explanation: The Dao Lord says if future people on the Three Primal Ones’ days cultivate fasting and lecturing, following the Mysterious Metropolis offering method, offering to the ten directions’ great saints and Daoists, their merits established, they gain the Venerable’s favour, roaming the upper realm Western Jade Kingdom, where treasures are unending, past departed souls all freed from suffering, not falling into the three paths. Then follows the assembly of saints rejoicing and circling.

At that time, the ten directions’ saints hearing the Venerable’s wondrous dharma and cause for deliverance, hearing the unheard, awakening the unawakened, then together praising, rejoicing and faithfully practicing.

Chanting and reciting in the void, circling and revolving, bowing and saluting, praising the Celestial Venerable. The Supreme Dao Lord and ten directions’ saints, having spoken verses, what instruction does the Venerable still give?

The Supreme Dao Lord and ten directions’ great saints having chanted verses, the Venerable said: On the Three Primal Ones’ fasting days, all must lecture and recite this scripture, diligently cultivate and bow, practice the Way six times a day, with incense, water and cleanliness, abstaining from taste, interior and exterior calm and even, indifferent and non-action, not engaging in worldly affairs, first granting the ten precepts, tranquil mind closing thought, contemplating spirit and recalling truth, imagining the existence of the dharma. Then the saints all at once bow and request to receive the precepts.

Explanation: This is the Venerable’s compassion, again earnestly giving instruction and urging; further proclaiming the precepts and method of practice. Because the saints always cultivate pure conduct, calm and free of desire, not involving defilement, hoping to teach and transform the ignorant; thus on this day inducing and urging, further explaining the precepts, to dismiss and protect, fast and cleanse, contemplate spirit and recall truth, day and night receiving and holding, mindful of the Three Treasures, in future attaining the Way, seeing the Venerable, feasting in Jade Capital, roaming the Golden Gate. This is the Three Primal Ones’ days for fasting and lecturing, delivering past ancestors, gaining such blessings. The Venerable having bestowed precepts, their text is as follows.

The Celestial Venerable said:

First precept: Not to kill life, nor indulge in licentious offerings to the six heavenly gods and ghosts.

Second precept: Not to steal or do wrong, nor take others’ possessions.

Third precept: Not to love music or beauty, nor be jealous of the improper.

Fourth precept: Not to speak false or flowery words, avoiding excessive talk.

Fifth precept: Not to indulge in wine and intoxication, without measure.

Sixth precept: Not to babble arrogantly, nor slander ancestors.

Seventh precept: Not to deceive masters or betray the Way, nor discard sacred texts.

Eighth precept: Not to be angry at the four classes, nor slander Daoists.

Ninth precept: Not to covet excessively, damaging things to benefit self.

Tenth precept: Not to insult relatives or disrespect the elders.

These ten precepts are great bodily troubles; those who violate them suffer the wind blade through myriad kalpas, always encountering evil causes. A kind and faithful heart opens and guides later generations; diligently practice and listen carefully, do not forget these words. Practicing them according to the law, in life committing no fault, in death free from bonds and confinement; the heavens send down clouds and canopies, naturally attaining the Way.

Explanation: These are the ten precepts, the method of practice. Those who protect them attain men and heavens; those who violate them sink into hell. If there be good men and women capable of holding these ten precepts, diligent and vigorous, heart never weary, conduct in accord with the Way, then no fault arises in life; the teaching looks up to them; in death they ascend to the upper clarity, riding cloud chariots, coming and going unhindered, transcending the three realms with adamantine bodies. If violating them, then falling into five sufferings, passing through the three paths, sword trees and knife mountains, driven by ox-headed jailers, urged and chased, flesh scattered like stars, bones dissolved like rain, suffering for myriad kalpas, not taking a moment’s rest, always encountering evil causes, enemy facing enemy. Violating scripture and precepts, hell suffers calamity; practicing according to law, heaven enjoys bliss. Next the Dao Lord asks about the Three Primal Ones’ fasting methods, this preface below further opening.

The Supreme Dao Lord bows and salutes, saying: The Three Primal Ones’ fasting method, the Middle Primal One’s principle, already fully heard. Not yet known are the upper and lower Primal Ones, by what laws and rites.

Explanation: These Three Primal Ones’ fasting methods are all in various scriptures. The Dao Lord fears future generations’ ignorance and many misunderstandings, thus raises further questions, earnestly requesting the unheard; the Celestial Venerable replies as follows.

The Venerable said: These Three Primal Ones’ fasting days, three records and decisions, essentials of Spiritual Treasure. The fifteenth day of the first month is the Upper Primal One, Heavenly Official’s audit. The fifteenth day of the tenth month is the Lower Primal One, Water Official’s audit. These govern different things.

Explanation: This is the Celestial Venerable’s explanation of the Three Primal Ones’ delegation. These Three Primal Ones’ laws are three records and decisions, from the Spiritual Treasure essentials. The different governance is that the Upper Primal One’s left office governs life and birth, the sun’s fire official inspects. The Lower Primal One is the right office governing death, the moon’s water official inspects. The Middle Primal One governs birth and death records, all hell prisoners’ sins and merits, the wind blade inspection. Each oversees ninety thousand multitudes, all in twelve months. The Middle and Lower Primal Ones’ three offices overlap two. However, the incense swirling is for the Upper Primal One to know life, the Lower Primal One to know death. Since governed separately, thus difference; hence called different governance.

Now as related, the Great Offering on the fifteenth day of the seventh month is the general governance of upper and lower Primal Ones; thus told and should be observed.

Explanation: This means the Middle Primal One comprehends upper and lower, everything is harmonized and managed; hungry ghosts and prisoners are all present today. But today the Middle Primal One governs upper and lower, its function weightiest. Thus the Mysterious Metropolis offering ritual, to rescue ancestors, is not called Heavenly or Water Official, but only Middle Primal One, Earth Official. The Earth Official is in the center; center is the proper color; thus selecting Middle Primal One to cover upper and lower. Also all things mature in autumn; hence the golden time is taken as ripe. Thus on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, the Middle Primal One’s time is selected for offering. All hungry ghosts and sinful souls today are released.

The Middle Primal One’s teaching and precepts’ day, the Mysterious Metropolis Great Offering’s morning, must always establish merit and practice fasting, act the Way and lecture scripture, offer to the Three Treasures, redeeming departed spirits. At this one time, hell’s prisoners all receive blessings; if observed, enjoy fortune; if neglected, calamity arrives.

Explanation: The Venerable’s observance of the Great Offering supply brings unlimited blessings; lightly neglecting the Great Offering leads to calamity for myriad kalpas.

The Supreme Dao Lord, ten directions’ great saints, flying heavenly kings, and 7,240 children, hearing these words, all rejoiced at once, bowed and departed.

Explanation: The great saints’ compassion is always to rescue. As for proclaiming the wondrous dharma, illuminating the mysterious wind, hoping its supreme words, how could they not rejoice? Thus devout and eager, making salutation and departing, each going to their place, diligently teaching.

The Great Offering Scripture of the Supreme Cavernous Mysterious Spiritual Treasure of the Three Primal Ones of the Jade Capital and Mysterious Metropolis concludes.
