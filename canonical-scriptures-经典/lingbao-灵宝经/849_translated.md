## Scripture of the Cavernous Mystery, the Spiritual Treasure, the Nine Perfected Ones, the Five Returns, and the Three Reversions of the Way, the Gate of Practice

This scripture speaks of the methods of practicing the Five Observations at the Gate. One scroll. Original text in: *The Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Tradition*, Tai Xuan section.

The Dao says:  
Good men and good women who cultivate the correct Way must be without desire and self-observe, wondrously perceiving the true heart, penetrating and clearly illuminating. There arise thoughts and intentions, which are seen as present in the heart; they do not arise to illuminate the heart, but to understand and take the methods of the heart. But when the heart is understood, and the methods of the heart are understood, do not arise to understand the heart or understand the methods of the heart; but let the heart be silent, do not arise to the silence of the heart or the silence itself; but let the silence be not non-silence, do not think it is non-silence or not silence.  
Again it is said: Wood without fire, earth without fire, these two are not the same; wood without fire, wood without man, these two are not the same; the heart without knowledge, wood without knowledge, these two are not the same; the heart without knowledge, the heart without wood, these two are not the same. In sameness there is confusion, therefore to take the true is error; in sameness there is severance, therefore to take the true is nothing.  
Therefore, in the great chaos there is the infinite nature, the infinite nature is all dependent on the correct nature, which responds and brings forth forms of life, like wood producing fire, like the heart giving rise to knowledge, transforming and manifesting in the world, impermanent in birth and death; the true Way and the correct nature have in truth no birth and no death.  
If a man can purify his heart and harmonize with the Dao, then he is returning to the root, recovering life, and verifying the true constant.  
At that time, in the void, a verse was composed:  

> Knowledge arises from the environment,  
> Fire is born from conditions.  
> Each is the seed of true nature,  
> Riding the current loses the source of the Way.  
> When the mind arises, desire ceases knowledge;  
> Mind arising with knowledge is more vexing.  
> Realizing that nature is originally empty,  
> Knowledge itself is the gate to manifold wonders.

The Dao says:  
Dispersed simplicity becomes the vessel, riding the current to recognize the environment. In the recognition of environment and method, there are four false knowings:  
One, inner heart knowledge;  
Two, external environment knowledge;  
Three, mutual middle knowledge;  
Four, abandonment of knowledge.  
But these false knowings exist only in name; apart from these four falsehoods, there is no other truth.  
Why so? Because knowledge is not two, hence falsehood inside and outside; knowledge is not one, hence falsehood in the middle; knowledge is not none, hence severance and falsehood; knowledge is not existence, hence permanence and falsehood.  
Therefore, recognizing environment is like dew or bubble.  
Again it is said: The common man makes wonders into illusions; the sage's spiritual powers are transformations; influence and dreams are false; taking the semblance as the true is error. Only the power of wisdom clearly illuminates its truth. Understanding the heart is the Way; true and false are not two; not abandoning inside or outside, true and false are not one.  
Following conditions, consciousness appears; following consciousness, conditions are seen. Consciousness and conditions have no correctness, no existence. No later or earlier, no permanence or discontinuity; altogether pure and quiet, good in stillness and non-action, spontaneous and natural, ascending to the great unity's fruit — this is returning to the Way, returning to the root, verifying the true constant.  
At that time, in the void, a verse was composed:  

> Dispersed simplicity makes all vessels,  
> Wheel images emerge from formlessness.  
> Holding the middle without danger or doubt,  
> Riding the current, moving through life and death.  
> Consciousness and environment arise mutually,  
> Inner and outer false knowings complete.  
> Clearly realize true and false as one,  
> Return heart and Dao to deep darkness.

The Dao says:  
From blue to yellow are waves and billows; abandoning blue and other colours entering the eye is returning the body. From eye to ear is the wheel of consciousness; abandoning eye and other roots returning the spirit. From thought to thought is birth and death; abandoning thoughts and their number returning to silence is returning life. Returning life harmonizes with Dao, and Dao harmonizes with it; inside and outside are equally true, freely without obstruction; the nature without obstruction, the Dharma realm universally penetrates, universally penetrates the eye of the Dao, illuminating various forms and appearances. Blue and other appearances manifest in the eye of the Dao; the eye and appearance are neither identical nor separate; equally acting true essence, neither severed nor permanent.  
Hereupon in the method a verse was composed:  

> Heart pure, true root manifests,  
> Roots pure, wondrous environment reveals.  
> Environment wondrously penetrates heart now,  
> Heart clear, returns life constant.  
> Dao and heart originally not two,  
> Together flow to five destinations.  
> Apart from things, apart from birth and death,  
> Neither man nor Dao's ground.

The Dao says:  
From Yi to Qin are transformations and revolutions; from man to ghost are directions and courses; from the vulgar entering immortality is turning away from death; from the ordinary entering the sagehood is returning to constancy. Returning to constancy is returning life; returning life is verifying the Way. The nature of the Dao is clear and pure, universally bright and round. Therefore it can hold and illuminate the various appearances of Yi and others. The appearance and nature depend on one another; depending, there is thought; thought does not abide, coarising and coceasing. This nature of birth and death is neither born nor perished; neither born nor perished, hence it is neither false nor true. Therefore, all Dao's realms enter alike into the great Dao nature, surpassing action, departing from all conditional appearances.  
Hereupon in the nature a verse was composed:  

> Yi, Qin and other realms,  
> Consciousness and feeling are of one trade and home.  
> Man and ghost differ in Dao,  
> Being and non-being do not obstruct each other.  
> Turning from death, walking the Way,  
> Returning life, reverting to true constancy.  
> Clear heart, eye of Dao pure,  
> Manifold wonders reveal their place.

The Dao says:  
What the Perfected Ones practice are four kinds of gateways; if heavenly men and women can diligently cultivate without weariness, they will ascend into non-action and harmonize with the true Dao.

The Dao says:  
The Dao and virtue are truly wondrous; their essence is primal and boundless; they penetrate yin and yang, condense spirit and heaven and earth, flow essence and disperse simplicity, cut and form the ranks, the forms and relations are responsive; they do not receive terrestrial karma, but respond according to the nature of karma, opening and combining myriad aspects; consciousness enters the dark primal, without increase or decrease, only life and death remain, thus contamination becomes cause; nine prisons and five true [realms] ride and bear it. What are the nine prisons?

1. To violate the great Dao, contract the abyssal darkness, natural decay, true constancy concealed; measureless ghosts come to afflict the body of method; the prison of clear truth and retribution, ruled by the Jade Emperor, silence and others holding the crime.

2. To violate the dark virtue, cause elemental transformation, the pure receives the turbid, utmost nature waves; ignorant ghosts come to afflict the seed of consciousness; the prison of transformation and the three bonds, ruled by the Heavenly Emperor, agitation and others holding the crime.

3. To violate the nature's root, arise defiling emotion, primal essence lost, true wisdom extinct; deformed ghosts come to afflict the causal body; the prison of destruction and final remission, ruled by the Earth Emperor, error and others holding the crime.

4. To violate principle and nature, tending to disorder and vexation, intention and nature perplexed, root of consciousness impaired; crafty ghosts come to afflict the directional body; the prison of the five relations, ruled by the Human Emperor, suffering and others holding the crime.

5. To violate faith and act deceitfully, mouth obstructs spleen and toil; azure sky ghosts add to the will's decay of the body; the prison of universal pillage, ruled by the Yellow Emperor, rods and others holding the crime.

6. To violate benevolence by killing, eyes darken, liver damaged; simple sky ghosts add to soul dispersion of the body; the prison of wind and thunder, ruled by the Blue Emperor, blades and others holding the crime.

7. To violate righteousness by robbery, nose blocked, lungs withered; cinnabar sky ghosts add to soul departure from the body; the prison of diamond, ruled by the White Emperor, burning and others holding the crime.

8. To violate propriety by lust, tongue parched, heart frightened; dark sky ghosts add to spirit's leaving the body; the prison of fire veil, ruled by the Red Emperor, ice and others holding the crime.

9. To violate wisdom by folly, ears deaf, kidneys exhausted; calm sky ghosts add to essence's withering of the body; the prison of the deep cold, ruled by the Black Emperor, oppression and others holding the crime.

Yet the sins received in these prisons, the grave counted in kalpas, the light counted in years, according to their karmic power, passing through the cycles of the top many, to the end and round again. If one wishes to escape, one must cultivate the Five Victories. What are the Five Victories?

1. First, observe the five knowings, clarify the ten practices, the doors of false being and non-being.

2. Next, observe the heart and wisdom, understand impermanence, the gates of birth, death, and transformation.

3. Then cultivate faith and wisdom, purify the field of karma, the gate of returning life and silence.

4. Wondrously attain the seed of mystery, the root of chaos, the gate of penetrating true brightness.

5. Dye and harmonize to illuminate the Dao, ascend to clear brightness, verify the gate of true penetration.

These are the five true practices cultivated; body and heart are penetrating and wondrous, complete and perfect, transcending impermanence, attaining the true constant Dao. The true constant Dao is universally infinite, neither being nor non-being, not permanent nor broken; this is the true Way and correct nature, spontaneous and natural.  
Hereupon in the method a verse was composed:  

> True constancy holds the six ways,  
> Piercing environment, arising violating relations.  
> Brightly reliant on the silent wilds,  
> Darkly the myriad images divide.  
> Influenced by karma, receiving form and transformation,  
> Form influences and induces mind and spirit.  
> Spirit and form mutually depend and stop,  
> Movement is cause of future karma.  
> Nine offences lead to prisons,  
> Five victories ascend their truth.  
> Wondrous Dao penetrates the sea of heart,  
> Wondrous heart, Dao is spontaneous.  
> Being is non-being without severance,  
> Non-being is not two-sided.  
> In things is neither birth nor death,  
> Apart from things is not permanence.

The Dao says:  
Good men and women, if they can cultivate the Five Victories and ascend to the true gate, then they can escape the nine prisons, climb to the unsurpassed position, encompass the Dharma realm, and verify the true constant Dao.  
At that time the assembly of immortals heard these words, their hearts filled with joy, and they composed a praise:  

> Ten directions in boundless realms,  
> One Way, one multitude of beings.  
> Six destinies linked in the sea of samsara,  
> One constant, one fallen state.  
> True and false are not two realities,  
> Sin and blessing are not empty names.  
> Only should verify the essence of the Dao,  
> The three realms are the three Pure Ones.

## The Perfected Ones’ Practice of the Way, the Accorded Verification

The Dao says:  
Good men and women, who desire to absolutely sever all suffering, ascend into non-action, must cultivate the Nine True advanced practices of the Way. The practitioners of the Way uphold precepts and restrain thought, purify the heart and guard unity, sever all external views, eliminate all internal defilements, depart from the three existences, verify that which is non-action, spontaneously and naturally, attaining the unsurpassed position.  
At that time the Perfected Ones, hearing this, their hearts arose liberation; they came to the Way place, shallow and deep alike, all receiving benefit, each proclaiming their power, and uttering these praises:  

### First Perfected One’s Praise:  
Having clearly come out of all views, the heart is still and external filth removed;  
The six evils and falsehoods exhausted, upright unity dwelling naturally.  
Attaining and verifying no-self, utterly solitary yet not lonely;  
Ascending and roaming the manifold gates, forever penetrating emptiness without void.

### Second Perfected One’s Praise:  
The Perfected One verifies the emptiness of the Law,  
Nature pure, inside no defilement.  
Heart's desires already removed, no stain, no possessions.  
Therefore attaining liberation, not subject to all receptions;  
Arriving at the place of non-action, constantly noble and nourished by the mother.

### Third Perfected One’s Praise:  
Nowhere with no beginning or end, neither perishing nor dependent;  
No thought, no colour or love, deep harmony, rarefied subtlety.  
Attaining equality and true unity in roaming,  
Transformations no one can impel.  
Wondrously open, wondrously without form,  
Ascending mystery, returning without return.

### Fourth Perfected One’s Praise:  
No emptiness, no non-colour; no consciousness, no seeing or learning;  
No heart, no thinking; no nature, no conditions or gathering.  
Spirit and form do not follow each other;  
Mutually depend but do not enter each other.  
Forever severing flowing birth and death;  
Multitudes of suffering none can reach.

### Fifth Perfected One’s Praise:  
Heart’s essence has no fixed place,  
True nature exists in emptiness.  
Desire’s practice utterly extinguished,  
Spirit penetrates into no interval.  
Not abiding in all existences or emptiness,  
Not abandoning the great clarity gate.  
Spontaneously communicating wondrous seed,  
Dwelling and roaming in true pure heavens.

### Sixth Perfected One’s Praise:  
Correct nature neither taking nor rejecting,  
Colour and habit naturally gone.  
Not exhausted by action,  
Not dwelling in the Way place.  
Constantly in boundless realm,  
Following things yet not illuminated.  
No obstruction, no distinction,  
Mystery together, reaching the Way’s principle.

### Seventh Perfected One’s Praise:  
Illumined wisdom enters arising conditions,  
Spirit bright, great void and chaos.  
Colour and habit already extinguished,  
Old bonds completely dissolved.  
Then in the sea of birth and death,  
Free and untroubled in the palace of liberation.  
No arising in great stillness,  
Turning wisdom boundless and infinite.

### Eighth Perfected One’s Praise:  
Heart and Way not two principles,  
Without boundary and without place.  
In use and always still,  
No birth and no master.  
True and false from the same source,  
Responding and transforming with no permanence.  
Hundred dharmas spontaneously open,  
Three mysteries penetrated and fully displayed.

### Ninth Perfected One’s Praise:  
Empty wisdom’s free power,  
Responsive verification causing the Dharma body.  
Two truths are constant stillness,  
Three ages illuminate the complete treasure.  
Now and ancient have no foremost or last,  
What governs is neither man nor being.  
Seven changes without constant form,  
Six communications not different spirits.

At that time, each Perfected One having completed their praise, all respectfully remained in their places, their hearts filled with joy, complete in majesty and demeanour, turning to the Dao Lord, making reverence and then departing.
