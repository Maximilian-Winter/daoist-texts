The Scripture of the Supreme Six Fasts and Ten Observances of the Mysterious and Spiritual Treasure of the Cavern of Mystery

The Five Precepts of Daoism

First, no killing of life;  
Second, no fondness for wine;  
Third, no speaking with the mouth while the heart is otherwise;  
Fourth, no theft;  
Fifth, no licentiousness.

The Ten Virtues

First, to think upon filial duty to parents;  
Second, to think upon loyalty to ruler and teacher;  
Third, to think upon compassion for all creatures;  
Fourth, to think upon patience in bearing wrongs;  
Fifth, to think upon remonstrance and resolving disputes;  
Sixth, to think upon self-restraint and aiding the poor;  
Seventh, to think upon release of life and nurturing creatures, planting fruit trees and groves;  
Eighth, to think upon wells by the wayside, planting trees and building bridges;  
Ninth, to think upon advancing benefit and removing harm for others, instructing those yet unenlightened;  
Tenth, to think upon reading the Scriptures and Statutes of the Three Treasures, and constantly offering incense, flowers, and implements of worship.

Ordinary men who constantly practise these five sincerity and ten virtues shall have the protection of heavenly beings and good spirits, ever dispelling calamities and perils, and long attaining blessings and favour. This depends only on steadfast resolve.

The Six Annual Fasts

In the first, third, fifth, seventh, ninth, and eleventh months.

The Ten Monthly Fasts

On the first day, when the Northern Dipper descends;  
On the eighth day, when the Northern Dipper commands the spirits of death to descend;  
On the fourteenth day, when the emissaries of the Great One descend;  
On the fifteenth day, when the Heavenly Emperor and the Three Officials descend together;  
On the eighteenth day, the Great One descends;  
On the twenty-third day, the eight divine emissaries of the Great One descend;  
On the twenty-fourth day, the North Star descends;  
On the twenty-eighth day, the lower Great One descends;  
On the twenty-ninth day, the middle Great One descends;  
On the thirtieth day, the upper Great One descends.

From the days of the lower, middle, and upper Great One, all the honored spirits of heaven, earth, and water descend, and travel around the world, observing the good and evil of men.

On the day of Jiazi, the Great One orders the inspection of spirits;  
On the day of Gengshen, the spirits of the dead report the sins of men;  
On one's birth day, one's deeds are reckoned;  
On the eight seasonal days, eight spirits record men's good and evil;  
On the three prime days, the three officials of heaven, earth, and water examine men's guilt and merit.

The Three Assemblies

The seventh day of the first month is the grand assembly of rewards and punishments;  
The seventh day of the seventh month is the mid-year celebration of life;  
The fifth day of the tenth month is the great assembly of life.

The Five Sacrificial Fast Days

The first day of the first month is named the Heavenly Fast;  
The fifth day of the fifth month is named the Earthly Fast;  
The seventh day of the seventh month is named the Fast of Virtue and Dao;  
The first day of the tenth month is named the People's Yearly Fast;  
The day of the twelfth month is named the Fast of Lords and Kings.

On the three assemblies, the three officials examine merits and demerits, and it is fitting to receive talismans and amulets, to fast and present memorials praying for splendour and blessing.

On the five sacrificial fast days, one should constantly offer sacrifices to departed ancestors, thus being called a filial child and receiving boundless blessings. The other days are all licentious rites. The three prime days are known as the days of eight resolutions, where one may set forth pure offerings and seek blessings.

The method of fasting and observance is chiefly to abstain from sweet, rich, fatty, pungent, and alcoholic fare; from lust, treachery, jealousy, envy, and vain thoughts; and from all evil things. Only incense should be burnt and lights kindled, scriptures recited and rites of confession performed, with the wish that all beings everywhere be freed from calamity; this alone is fasting. Formerly Confucius said to Laozi: 'I have dwelt in poverty, refraining from wine and meat for a long time.' Laozi replied: 'This is the fasting of sacrifice. You must be single-minded; not listen with the ear, but with the heart; not listen with the heart, but with the qi; thus cleanse your heart, wash away your spirit, and strike your wisdom; I will speak to you.'

It is said: according to the various scriptures on fasting, there are three degrees. First, to set forth offerings and fast, by which one may accumulate virtue and remove guilt. Second, to restrict food and fast, by which one may harmonize with the spirits and preserve life; this is called sacrificial fasting, practised by the middle rank. Third, to fast of the heart, that is, to cleanse and purify the mind, removing desire; to wash and purify the spirit, removing defilements and encumbrances; to strike the intellect, ceasing thought; for when thought and care cease, one concentrates on the Way; when desire and craving cease, one delights in the Way; when defilement and encumbrance cease, one accords with the Way. Since the heart has no two thoughts, it is called single-mindedness. This is practised by the highest rank. To consider fasting carefully, it is to regulate the three karmas (body, speech, and mind), and this alone is fasting. If one merely guards the restriction of food, but the mind is yet not regulated, and if one has only single-mindedness, then the mouth has no greed for flavour. These two methods support and supplement each other. Hence the Scripture of Great Precepts says: 'Calm and still the heart, concentrate the thoughts without two, avoid excess and appetite, be pure and empty within and without.' Although Confucius lightly esteemed mere fasting of food and drink, because he did not understand the regulation of the mind, therefore this method of fasting was shown to him, that he might receive the Way. And of the disciples of the later age, who can have a void and single-minded heart? Those who despise the teaching of sacrifice, thinking themselves to have understood the fasting of the heart, are in truth slothful and negligent men. Though they talk of mystery and stillness with their mouths, yet they do not understand its aim, and thus are self-conceited. The Book of Changes says: 'The sages use fasting and precepts thus.'

Men each have their years, months, days, and hours; according to the stars to which they belong, their poverty, wealth, rank, and length of life are determined. Yet all things of the six families have union and separation, birth and death, completion and failure, prosperity and decline. These are the constant numbers of heaven and earth, the correspondences of nature. The five colours are the skewers that pierce the eyes; the five notes are the hammers that stop the ears; the five flavours are the axes that sever the tongue; wealth and goods are the things that disorder men. Therefore no greater calamity than death, no greater blessing than life. Thus the named name loses my store; the nameless name nourishes my dwelling. The possessed goods rob me; the goods unpossessed nourish my blessing. No greater guilt than licentiousness; no greater calamity than greed; no greater fault than usurpation — these three are the wheels of disaster. Small they destroy the person; great they destroy the family.

To manage life and nurture nature, to carry the spirit and support destiny, is to depart from suffering and ascend to joy, so that blessings and happiness flow on. Man’s life arises from spirit; when spirit remains firm, life subsists; when spirit breaks, death ensues. Therefore, by diligent mind and accumulated response, one can raise the form and ascend to the mysterious palace.

Men only know to fill their mouths with rich food and their bodies with honour and emolument, but do not consider that the sweet food injures life like an axe; that honours and emoluments, in luxury and splendour, provoke the resentment of heaven and earth.

The Primal Lord said: The Dao is the utmost truth of spiritual communication; the art is the mysterious technique of transformation. Form without form, by means of art it aids men. Men have spirit; by cultivation they meet the Dao. If men can learn it, then transformations come naturally. The essence of the Dao lies in seeking simplicity and easy access. The secret of safeguarding it lies only in talismans, medicines, and qi. The talisman is the spirit-script of the Three Luminaries, the true pledge of heaven. The medicine is the flower and essence of the five phases, the pure juice of the earth. The qi is the harmonious qi of yin and yang, the spiritual vitality of all things. Though you attain one thing, it is not yet complete; it requires the talisman, the medicine, and the Dao to be fulfilled. Medicine can refine the form; talisman can summon the spirit. Man loves his body, and no heaven nor earth can harm it. Guard your will, and no one under heaven can defeat it. Be content with poverty, and no one under heaven can make you rich. Delight in lowliness, and no one under heaven can raise you to honour. None are without reverence yet fail to be reverent; none are without humility yet fail to be humble; none are without pride yet fail to be proud; none are without kindness yet fail to be kind. Guard straightforwardness with crookedness; guard whiteness with shame; guard argument with silence; guard craft with clumsiness; count non-boasting as fullness; count ignorance as precious; count love for favour as fear. Do not tread on ground of trouble, so a hundred calamities cannot touch you. Do not follow paths not smooth and easy, so dangers cannot harm you. Do not let office or rank soil your will, so punishments cannot come upon you. Do not let praise or blame be your joy or anger, so slander cannot follow you. That a hundred calamities cannot touch you is to sum up the essentials of all things. That dangers cannot harm you is to secure the blessing of eternal peace. That punishments cannot come upon you is to fill out the years of your life. That slander cannot follow you is to perfect your pure truth. If a man can be void, still, pure, kind, benevolent, faithful, filial, respectful, harmonious, modest, diligent, frugal, gentle, pure, and simple, then he is one with the Dao. Therefore, to apply the principles of the Dao to the person, the heart is clear and the will unimpeded; the spirit is honoured and the qi cherished; the material things are despised and fame abased; thought and care are not confused; the blood and qi are balanced; the sinews and bones are flexible; the ears and eyes are acute; the skin moist and smooth; the face radiant; the spirit firm and concentrated; the body light and strong; emptiness and fullness in accord; the hair and temples moist and shining. To apply reason to the family, the father is kind and the son filial; the husband is faithful and the wife chaste; the elder brother is good and the younger brother obedient; the nine clans are harmonious; the tillage and mulberry trees are in season and abundant; the granaries are full and well stored; the six kinds of livestock are numerous; the business is well managed; there is always surplus. Therefore, when ruler and minister have the Way, there is loyalty and kindness; when father and son have the Way, there is affection and kindness; when nobles and commoners have the Way, there is mutual love. When there is the Way, there is harmony; when there is no Way, there is discord. From this it is seen that the Dao with man cannot be forsaken for a moment.

Wenzi asked Laozi: What is meant by the Dao, virtue, benevolence, righteousness, and propriety? Laozi said: Formless and unacting, inwardly cultivating the person, outwardly governing men; when work is accomplished and affairs established, this is the Dao. To nurture, to nourish, to perfect, to grow, to benefit all without discrimination, and to harmonize with heaven and earth, this is virtue. The superior man does not boast of his achievements; the inferior man does not feel shame at his faults; in great affairs he is not proud; in small things he does not pilfer; he loves all without partiality, and remains long without decay; this is benevolence. The superior man assists the weak; the inferior keeps to chastity; he is open without arbitrariness; he is poor without changing his principles; he is consistent with reason, and without private bias or distortion; this is righteousness. The superior man is reverent and austere; the inferior is humble and respectful; he yields and preserves gentleness; he is the female of the world; he stands where he dares not, and acts where he cannot; this is propriety. Therefore, to cultivate the Dao is to submit and obey; to cultivate virtue is to follow commands; to cultivate benevolence is not to contend; to cultivate righteousness is to be fair and just; to cultivate propriety is to be respectful. If all these five are cultivated, the state is at peace.

Men now are intelligent and discerning, yet near to death; they delight in judging others’ sins. Learned and eloquent, yet endangering their bodies; they delight in exposing others’ faults. But to follow the law of heaven and observe the phenomena of earth, to extend kindness to animals and plants, and to forget and not hold on to self, this accords with the Great Way. Therefore it is said: deep practice is Dao and virtue; shallow practice is benevolence and righteousness; slight practice is propriety and music. From this it follows that it is better to cherish the Dao and embrace virtue, and be naturally simple and pure.

The Venerable Lord said to Lingyangzi: Previously I discoursed with the officer Guan Lingyin on the essentials of the Mystic Truth, in a treatise of a hundred thousand words, in nine chapters of void and purity. Void and purity are my dwelling; clear and clean are my abode; nonaction and naturalness are my essence; easy and united as one is my name; harmonious and without form is my function; responsive and transformative without end is my change. Nature is the truth of the Dao; nonaction is the constancy of the Dao; void and nothingness are the honor of virtue; detachment is the palace of virtue; calm and stillness are the spring of virtue; purity and cleanness are the neighbour of spirit; sincerity is the gate of spirit; moderation and harmony are the foundation of affairs. Men follow the Dao when they can be natural; therefore the Dao can be attained and communicated. They can be nonacting; therefore life can be obtained and prolonged. They can be void and empty; therefore qi can be obtained and move. They can be detachment; therefore the will can be obtained and shared. They can be calm and still; therefore sound can be obtained and vanish. They can be pure and clean; therefore spirit can be obtained and shine. They can be sincere; therefore the will can be obtained and follow. They can be moderate and harmonious; therefore transformation can be obtained and follow. Therefore, all men who follow the Dao must establish their name with nature, nourish their form with nonaction, nourish their spirit with void and nothingness, preserve their will with detachment, nourish their body with calm and stillness, regulate their heart with purity and cleanness, guard their will with sincerity, and preserve their spirit with moderation and harmony. To quiet the heart and wander in mind is like a great flood calming itself. To dwell deeply and tranquilly is like a dragon hidden in the deep. To cherish the void and not be stubborn is like a bellows drawing in the void. To obtain transformation and preserve spirit is like a state protecting its functions. To establish honour and reside in spirit is like an ancestral temple guarding benevolence. To be unseen by men is like a great fish dwelling in great water. To be unknown to men is like the sun rising without east. To make my life unending is like the Great Way without bounds. The mutual attraction of the Dao is like a high mountain and great marsh attracting birds and beasts; like a deep forest and giant trees attracting flying birds and myriad insects; like rivers, seas, lakes, and pools attracting fish, turtles, and dragons; like great virtue and peace attracting qilin and phoenix; like pure sincerity and whiteness attracting jade maidens and fairy herbs; like moderation and good response attracting virtue, auspice, and felicity; like disaster, anomalies, and evil deeds attracting demons and calamities.

Men often depart from the Dao; it is not the Dao that departs from men. Men often lose life; it is not life that loses men. If the Dao and life may mutually cherish each other, and life and Dao mutually guard each other, and the two not separate, then long life may be obtained.

Within the forms, man is most spiritual. Heaven and nature are the same, but by cultivation differ. How? If he cultivates goodness, he gradually forms the character of the perfect man; if he indulges in evil, he turns to become a wicked servant. Therefore the Venerable Lord laments him, and commands him to learn the Dao.

The way of cultivating the person is the treasure of the state; it cannot be without love nor without honour. Yet the root of the body is threefold: first spirit, second essence, third qi. These three arise from the qi of heaven and earth. The spirit is received from heaven; the essence from earth; the qi from moderation. Together they form one Dao. The spirit is the carriage of the form; the qi is the chariot of the spirit; the essence dwells in the middle. The three assist each other as reason. He who desires long life must love the qi, honour the spirit, and respect the essence. The qi arises from essence; essence arises from spirit; spirit arises from brightness; man is originally the qi of yin and yang; qi turns to essence; essence turns to spirit; spirit turns to brightness. Therefore he who desires not to grow old must consider to guard the primordial qi and unite essence. Let it not depart from the form; unite and become one. Then you will appear bright and clear, the body lighter, the mind more refined. This is the spirit's light about to arise. The heart is greatly at peace, joyful as if with gladness. If you close your eyes and lie down, placing your thoughts within the body, and the inner mind does not stray, then the body is refined and the form transformed. Thus the true principle is obtained, and great peace will surely come. Wonderful is this Dao. The spirit is the sovereign; the essence the minister; the qi the subject. Therefore in cultivating the person, one calms the spirit and nourishes the qi, not desiring joy or anger; if one can govern these, the qi strengthens of itself, the mind is satisfied, all evil departs, diseases disappear, brightness shines forth, and good spirits respond. Hence it is said: The great Dao is broad and level; it is not far from the body. The first fruit is among men who walk the nine transformations of the immortal. First, they follow the good; second, they close themselves against evil; third, they widely live and help things; fourth, they encourage and assist the good; fifth, they bestow wealth; sixth, they make great vows to benefit others; seventh, their bodies are kind and do no harm to things; eighth, their words are kind and do no harm to things; ninth, their hearts are kind, constantly thinking on good. Constantly practising these nine ways, not one may be omitted.
