## Scroll Twelve of the Scripture of the Responses and Titles of the Thirty-two Heavenly Lords of the Supreme Cave of Mystery and Spiritual Treasure

**Desire Realm**

**Qingming He Tong Tian**

At that time, in the assembly, there was an immortal named Fan Ming, who rose from his seat, arranged his garments and cap, and advanced forward to respectfully inquire of the Sovereign Emperor Qingming He Tong Tian, saying: "In former times I served in audience before the Heavenly Lord, journeying through the spiritual bonds, and was granted to behold the Dharma assembly, most wondrous and inconceivable. The radiance of this day has never before been seen. The holy and true immortals all advance to their ranks; joyful and leaping, they cannot contain themselves. The heavenly lords of the Ten Directions wear the crowns of the morning splendour, garments of cloud brocade; with a single voice they expound the Dharma, delivering all heavenly beings. On the left attend the highest holy immortals; on the right guard the Vajra strongmen. Flying frost, dense purple, jade blossoms and divine herbs, returning wind and spirit incense, soaring to the heavens, veiling the sun. At that time the assembly responded with joy beyond words. These beings, all sentient, have attained peace and happiness. But I do not understand the men and women of the lower realms, born in countless numbers, their habitual sins forming their karma; through lives and lives of causes and conditions, what escape from trial and punishment do they find? To what refuge do they turn? How can their deep faults be resolved?"

The Sovereign Emperor Qingming He Tong Tian said: "Your great compassion acts with pity upon all sentient beings. Such causes and results are of heavy merit. For you I will explain and you shall hear attentively and reverently. The causes and retributions of sentient beings cannot be ascribed to a single source; by universal prayer to the true spirits alone can deliverance be obtained. Now I open the silver tablets and jade registers of the Heavenly Lords’ Responses in the Golden Flower Palace, to show the future; keep them secret and reverently present; do not rashly divulge. Men and women of heart should diligently offer homage, beseech removal of deep faults, burn incense and light lamps, think of the spirit and worship the teachers according to the prescribed rites. Ring the heaven bell twelve times, swallow thrice, adjust the voice and correct the qi, chant the chapter of the boundless mysteries:

"Qingming cultivates the grains and blessings; whence return to Dragon Mountain?  
Ah Xiu’s jade forest branches, resplendent, four hanging banners.  
Suddenly perceiving the spiritual kalpa’s transformation, Homa spreads the time.  
True flow through the three realms’ court, chanting and whistling brings swift motion."

The Sovereign Emperor Qingming He Tong of the Golden Flower Palace’s silver tablets and jade registers, the compassionate responses of the one hundred heavenly lords of the Eastern Nine Qi Heaven in the Limitless World, burn incense, fast and keep quiet, offer homage and devotion, erase the bright true nine abyss jade chest of the long night’s box, universally causing men and heavens to depart suffering and gain liberation, dispelling the dust and sand of karmic offenses, obtaining immeasurable good causes.

They shall beseech the eradication of sins accumulated from the beginningless kalpas of lives and lives, family gates, ancestral lines, nine kin and marriage clans, internal and external connections; offenses committed by enticing and taking scriptures and transmitting them to disciples. For the ten direct gods of the West, the Taiyi officers of destiny and record, they determine the crimes and report them to the heavenly bureaux; entangled across lifetimes, without liberation. The crimes are bound in the jade chest of the Western Limitless World’s spiritual officers under the Sovereign Emperor Wusi Jiangyou Tian; below examined in the Supreme Mystery Female Azure Lower Origin and the Correct Bureau, enduring kalpas of hardship without release, cycling back and forth without end, dying and reviving, dark then bright, suffering various punishments and assuming various forms. For such offenses, they all beseech deliverance, the nine abysses ceasing their accusations, the three evil paths emptied, the long night filled with light, free and joyous. Above they rely on the great compassion of the Heavenly Lord; below they are rewarded for the sincerity of men and women who return and rely upon him.
