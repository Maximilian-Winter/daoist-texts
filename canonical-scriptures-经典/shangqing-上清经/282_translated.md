### The Secret Instructions of the Hollow Truth Supreme Clarity Dragon Flying Ninefold Path Letter Scroll

White Feather Black Wing Dragon Flying Jade Talisman

On the first day of the second month, in the first year of the Supreme Emperor of the Great Way, in the cyclical day Jiazi, an oath was made in the Boundless Heaven, and the True Lord of the North Pole was conferred. At that time the Ninefold Heavens’ Highest Emperor, the Great Immortal and Saint, all appeared at the place of covenant; the Five Emperors girded themselves in bands; myriad spirits served in attendance; the sun and moon poured forth their radiance; the five constellations arrayed their stars; the seven origins opened their gates; the Yellow Path did not move; heaven and earth stopped their courses; the three realms were purified; crimson clouds followed the shade; purple clouds flew in four directions; season and day were harmonious and joyous; eight marvels were spread abroad. The Lord rent open the silk of the morning splendor, imparted the instructions mouth to mouth; his voice remote and echoing through the nine heavens, his heavenly title was the Emperor called Xin. The Celestials bowed in reverence; the Demon Kings bound their forms; guarding the mysterious void; his station ascended to the Jade Clarity. The Five Elders commanded examination; the Four Offices attended to assist the True; attendants on left and right served the Immortals; the oath was announced to the spirits, according to the rules of inclination and reverence; facing north, the blessing was pronounced:

Cold flight ascends the stage; the supreme command to the nine spirits; to govern and regulate without ceasing day and moon. At this auspicious morning, the heart is sincere, the form unbound; wielding the blade at the southern palace; exhaling elixir in the cold court; golden sheep and silver geese respectfully offered to Supreme Clarity; the silk is rent to divide the heavens; the covenant announced in the scripture; petitioning the four extremes; ten thousand kalpas but one fall; if my words be leaked, the punishments of the seven mysteries; if my covenant be broken, examine and destroy thy form; life and death disclaim responsibility; long be closed the nine underworlds.

Thus ended. Then the silk was torn and the scripture measured; the secret words orally communicated; the Celestials descended; the Five Emperors guarded the spirits; the Nine Mornings gave nine hundred golden morning jade youths; the Nine Emperors gave seven hundred jade maidens; the Five Emperors again gave five hundred jade maidens each. The Five Elders summoned the carriage; the Four Offices carried the banners; purple clouds flew the sedan; twelve jade wheels led the way; before sang the phoenix; behind followed the mysterious sovereign; the six legions opened the road; nine dragons winged the chariot; to welcome the True Lord; ascending the Jade Clarity North Morning Palace; roaming the seven origins; circling the five constellations; passing through the heavenly gates; attaining the station of the General Immortal; governing in the palace of the North Pole Vast Spirit. In the first year of Kaihuang, the text was entrusted to the Eastern Flower Blue Youth Great Lord, according to the rules transmitted through ten thousand kalpas.

The Way of the Dragon Flying Letter Scroll issues from the Ninefold Heavens’ Emperor, bearing the name of the Nine Mornings, the Five Stars, the Void, and the Eternal Heaven; a precious secret spirit-sound of high and supreme authority, thus a covenant text. Except those who have passed nine kalpas in former lives, reversed the mysterious script, and recorded the names of Supreme Clarity, those who are True Persons may not read its chapters or examine its secret sounds. To behold this writing is to gain life and death and achieve immortality. Those who are able to cultivate its Way will have divine light flowing and shining; the Emperor descends; seven years of hidden withdrawal; transformations in myriad directions; entering and exiting the dark and mysterious; floating amidst the nine voids; fourteen years to ascend the morning light by day; flying up to Jade Clarity. Those who have a sect but no scripture, but offer court and worship to the spirits and True Ones, will attain longevity and endless life; a thousand calamities will not touch them; ten thousand dangers will not reach them; military disasters will be destroyed; all obstacles become success; entering and exiting will bring the nine stars to cast their shade; the neck bears a round light; the Five Emperors arrange protection and guard; wherever they are, they attend and escort; one may gain the honour of serving the holy lord in the palace of Supreme Clarity.

This Way was born together with the Primordial Beginning; the Ninefold Heavens’ Primordial Sovereign transmitted it to the Supreme Taoist Lord; the Lord transmitted it to the Later Sage Golden Palace Emperor, the Supreme Emperor, the Supreme Subtle Heavenly Emperor, and the North Pole True Lord; who entrusted it to the Eastern Flower Blue Youth Great Lord. According to the rules, it is transmitted through ten thousand kalpas to those later learners who attain the Way. The method of transmission: the receiver must present offerings—scarlet patterned gauze ninety feet long, five-coloured patterned gauze each fifty feet long—to a master who has the scripture. One conducts a fast for a hundred days, or seventy days, or seven days; at the Mysterious Mountain a platform is erected; in a quiet and lofty place the text is written; facing north the covenant and measuring instructions are divided. With five taels of golden sheep one petitions the Five Stars; with nine taels of silver geese one petitions the Nine Mornings; these two offerings are presented to heaven to receive the scripture and serve the master with sincerity. At the hour of the rat, dew falls on the platform; with a scarlet gauze kerchief the sheep is invited eastward; with a white gauze kerchief the goose is invited westward; the nine heavens are sworn to; the covenant is divided in equal halves; secret names are recited by mouth. When conducting the measuring, one also follows the above blessing method; it may be called a precious Way, noble and true; sworn not to leak this covenant. If the covenant is lightly transmitted, master and disciple alike shall be examined and their bodies destroyed; the seven ancestors will discharge responsibility; through ten thousand kalpas there will be no remission. The decrees of the upper heaven should be carefully and thoroughly observed. At the time of the covenant, the disciples hold sheep and goose; facing north they bow nine times; then bow once to each of the five directions; starting from the west to the south; returning west to prostrate; facing east they place the sheep and goose at the master's sides; the master in the centre, facing north, knocks the teeth nine times invoking the nine passages, saying:

I, so-and-so, True Person of such mountain, dare at this good time and auspicious hour, the triple harmony and excellent morning, ascend the imperial platform; uncovering my form with sincere heart, pure fast requesting auspiciousness, array the covenant in the upper heaven; may the High One look down upon so-and-so; the Northern Emperor appoints so-and-so of such mountain; in former life eternally attaining the True Way; not passing through the wheel of rebirth; the Nine Heavens’ flowing blessing; the unbroken ancient name; the mysterious script commanding me to open the secret chapters; mouth chanting the one Emperor; covetous of the immortals; looking up to the spiritual contract; commanding at such a heaven the imparting of degree and feathered chapter of flying in the void; reporting above to myriad emperors to the supreme Primordial Sovereign, Great Immortal and Saint, Boundless Taoist Lord; may they graciously reflect and guard, carefully watch the covenant with sincerity; with the aura of the True Immortals of the Jade Clarity Upper Palace, supplement and serve the body of so-and-so; report to the Five Emperors, Five Mountains, myriad spirits, River and Sea Great Spirits; jointly observe the covenant text; as composed and according to the rules transmit it.

Left Half of the Letter Scroll

One should take three feet of white silk, write this text, make one half the upper left foot, and join the two halves at the central talisman. The receiver writes the name in purple ink, the text and talisman in cinnabar ink. The master confers the name; requests the jade youths and jade maidens to attend the receiver’s body; at the central talisman it is split in halves; worn on the body; the man takes the left, the woman takes the right; a cinnabar brocade bag is requested to hold the writing at the heart. At no time may one lightly transgress life and death; thrice violating the heavenly lodgings brings collapse; the Five Elders weep and wail; soul and spirit disperse; lost spirits and lost souls; within a year the body perishes. The Nine Heavens’ upper prohibitions: carefully observe, then the heavenly spirits and mysterious reflections will descend; the spirit True Ones will come; the body will generate water and fire; myriad transformations will follow.

Supreme Taoist Flying Feather Scripture Ascending Mysterious Supreme Record

The Primordial Father and Mother of the Ninefold Heavens, the Supreme True Elder, together feasted in the chariot of the Scenic Dragon; from the Mulberry Grove rode a thousand True Ones and myriad riders; flying immortals and giant dragons; steering the chariot, swirling lightning and swift smoke; their bodies adapting to the movement; chanting the spiritual chapter by mouth; roaming the hollow mound of mystery; resting by the clear waves’ edge; wandering the purple pavilion; reposing at the boundless end. At that time the Heavenly Origin shone brightly; the five mornings returned their light; three silks of flowing clouds; purple smoke emitted fragrance; flying scents surrounded the sun; the fragrance spread through the Great Void; the brilliant light intermingled and shone; three candles united to illumine; condensing true supreme contracts; chewing the daily root; feasting on the mysterious pouring void; donning bright golden chapters; hollow howling at the nine subtleties; spirits rejoicing in the jade pavilion; wondrous thoughts stirred in the great stillness; inward meditations opened to the natural. On the third day of the third month of the first year of the Supreme Emperor, suddenly the mysterious spirit descended in the white phoenix’s chariot; the black-winged phoenix’s mouth held the letter scroll; the flying feather scripture ascended the void, stepped on emptiness, true instructions; the jade essence guided the flying immortals in smoke; myriad spirits guarded the True; dark mists above the ninth firmament; splendid jade void courtyard; came down to the Supreme True; mysteriously imparting the precious scripture. On that day the Supreme True Elder was just concluding a fast in Supreme Clarity; at that time the Supreme Emperor, the Purple Twilight Three Silks Sovereigns, Heavenly Emperor, Supreme Subtle Heavenly Emperor, and the honoured guest of the High Jade Emperor all descended to sit; burning the incense of a hundred harmonies; five-coloured spirit officers floated to jade positions; arrayed in the purple palace; the assembly of True Ones worshipped the scripture; revolved three times; the Three Silks Sovereigns rose and faced west; emitted a clear and resonant sound; recited the Celebration True Feather Chapter; in praise of the Divine Scripture, its words said:

Auspicious and moist, the Great Void Pavilion; spiritual winds scatter rare fragrance. Rustling, the mysterious scene rises; faint breeze wings the sun. White phoenix swiftly flies; mouth holds the divine feather scroll. Fluttering, soaring through the nine skies; sorrowful cries brighten the mysterious beam. Wondrous instructions ride the void and issue forth; pure governance of the Way never ends. The assembly of True Ones all praise and celebrate; bowing their heads to worship the Jade Emperor.

When the recitation ended, the Supreme Emperor rose and facing north recited:

Mysterious phoenix swift cloud wings; white phoenix joyfully hesitates. Flying fragrance blends with blossoms; flowing light shines on the cloud path. Giant dragon controls the long reins; flying immortals support each other. Ten thousand True Ones celebrate good fortune; joyful phoenix roaming the void. Primordial Beginning has no trace; mysterious response seeks itself. Flapping wings need no chariot; drifting, riding smoke and floating. Precious scrolls integrate mysterious strength; five bodies govern spiritual talismans. Praise and celebration guard the blessed court; rotate incense three times each.

When this was recited, the Heavenly Emperor rose and faced east, saying:

White feathers and variegated dark wings; riding the floating falling movement and return. Flowing fragrance fills the ten heavens; fragrant herbs abound in Supreme Subtle. Spirit scroll opens hidden mechanism; feather scripture shines with mysterious brilliance. The supreme Way originally has no secret; holding true light it flies by itself.

Thus ended the recitation.

The Supreme True Elder donned the dharma robe; wore the crown of the utmost heaven, the boundless Three Treasures jade crown; clad in seamless nine-coloured flying void shining feather scroll; left hung flowing bells; right bore the seven origins; prostrated facing due south. The Supreme Subtle Heavenly Emperor arose; commanded the feather immortals’ attendant official to hold the golden staff; requested the scripture; facing north he knelt long; and conferred it to the Supreme True; all the immortals acclaimed it good. The Supreme True stood to receive the scripture; the face emitted golden light; the five bodies then gave birth to the natural spirit flying jade talisman. Ascending and taking the assembly of True Ones, all mounted the white phoenix chariot; drove the black-winged phoenix; to feast in the Eternal Yang. East to the luxuriant forest and blue water realm; the ruins of Fusang and the mouths of the Nine Sources; west to the mysterious feather white wilderness domain and the bank of Mengsi; south to the Zhu陵 pinnacle of flame and the southern summer city; north to the cold water township of the Shuoyin hollow mystery pavilion; the central disk of the ten extremes, yellow qi and yang essence of Supreme Mystery Jade Capital; golden terrace, jade chamber, cinnabar and jade palace; wandering the ten heavens and eight regions of hollow clarity. Commanding myriad True Ones; no heaven left unbound; no dark place not touched; no qi not united; no immortal not gathered; universally governing the assembly of spirits; from the Heavenly Emperor downward, none but abide by the virtue of the Supreme True; all look up to the Feather Scripture. At this the Emperor each floated in the mysterious palace; the scripture endured seven thousand kalpas; transmitted to the Supreme Taoist Lord.

In all cultivation and meditation on the Way of the Seven Stars, upon entering the chamber one first wears the five talismans and then writes. Writing and wearing are done facing east; knocking the teeth twelve times opening the passages; raising the voice to recite:

Mysterious Void Purple Clarity, Flying Feather Scripture, Above reflects the clouds and rosy mists, below gathers a thousand spirits, controlling and governing the Six Jia, steering my form, flying stepping the Heavenly Origin, lifting the Dipper Essence, condensing soul and fixing spirit, inwardly filling and overflowing, going out into the void entering the mystery, ever living with the qi.

Thus ended; wearing the talisman, inscribing the five hearts, then proceeding with affairs. Thus for nine years one may ride the void and govern the clouds, flying and travelling in the Supreme Clarity.

The Supreme Taoist Lord transmitted it to the Primordial Supreme Lord of the Shangyuan, the Supreme Subtle Heavenly Emperor; practicing the Way to completion; secreted in the palace of the Supreme Spiritual Metropolis. According to the rules, it is transmitted once every three thousand years; no light divulgence permitted; to proclaim and reveal the Celestials is to violate the covenant and break the oath; the body is held by ghost officers; misfortune falls on the nine ancestors; sealed in the dark springs. The foregoing talismans are all written in cinnabar.
