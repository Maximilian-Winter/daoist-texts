# The Precious Scripture of the Great Cavernous Feminine One Jade Inspection of the Five Elders, of the Supreme Cavernous True Jade Emperor

### Title of the Scripture: The Precious Scripture of the Great Cavernous Feminine One Jade Inspection of the Five Elders of the Supreme Cavernous True Jade Emperor. Abbreviated as the "Feminine One Five Elders Scripture." The author is unknown; it was composed approximately in the late Eastern Jin period. It is one of the early Shangqing sect’s "Three Wonders Precious Texts." One scroll. The original source is the Zhengyi section of the "Orthodox Daoist Canon."

Now, the Supreme Cavernous True Jade Emperor’s "Great Cavernous Feminine One Jade Inspection Five Elders Precious Scripture," calls upon the twelve wishes of the Mysterious Mother, the eight intervals, the nine revolutions, and the five-fold transformations of the feminine and masculine. The Central Huang-Lao’s "Great Cavernous True Scripture of Thirty-nine Chapters" is a secret kept in the palace of Great Abundance above the Nine Heavens, in the Jade chamber of the Supreme Mysterious Terrace. The text is inscribed on purple clouds as slips, with characters in blue-green to record its chapters. The Supreme Mixed Great Emperor gives birth to the transformations of the Upper Origin; in the middle transforms the seven nines; the principle of fate endures long; below are the divine laws of the gates, overseeing ten thousand spirits; feminine and masculine meet and unite; the splendid jade purity, vast and profound, the high and bright Great Light. The guardians of the scripture are twenty-seven Jade Maidens, who constantly burn incense; the attendants of the scripture are twenty-nine Jade Boys, who continually recite the precious spiritual texts. These Jade Boys and Maidens, in all fifty-six persons, strictly forbid any leakage or neglect, vigilantly watching over the true scripture, recording merits and virtues, and cautiously dispelling calamities. The supernatural radiance manifests its wondrous sign, each with a splendid morning to mark its truth. Thereupon, the Jade Radiance takes the form of the Jade Maidens; the Golden Radiance wears the countenance of the Golden Boys, floating gracefully above the Nine Mysteries, shining brightly in the chamber of accumulated perceptions. Together with the six heavens, in the deep and serene peaks, they wear embroidered mantles with flowing bells, fly in blue feathered skirts, girded with original talismans, crowned with morning coronets, guarding and defending the body of the scripture, assisting in the cultivation of the true man.

Whoever has this scripture must follow its text. One should always be still and secluded in a closed chamber, scatter incense and brush away dust, let the spirit rest in the obscure forest, avoid the secular world, be solitary and tranquil, leave behind worldly concerns and embrace the truth, open the mind and forget contention, submit and conform to the Cavernous Root, dwell alone in the secret chamber, abstain from the bitterness of the valley, taste the lightness ascending to the heavens, spit forth fluids and harmonize the essence, single-mindedly send away companions, gaze into the depths of the three souls, practice long austerities, pass days without food, fast bitterly for three years, and thus obtain the right to read the "Great Cavernous True Scripture." All this accords with the covenant law; one must not rashly transmit or leak it; rash leakage brings calamity upon oneself; to speak falsely or violate the oath is not to prolong one’s life. The scripture of the Nine Heavens is forbidden by the Four True Persons of the Supreme Ultimate; one must not rashly impart it to those not proper. Rashly imparting it to the unworthy is to leak and neglect the heavenly treasure, offending the Supreme Mysterious, incurring complaint from myriad spirits, inviting calamity from a thousand souls, incurring the guilt of the Most High, losing the life of the Imperial Lord, the body suffering under the laws of the netherworld, the form ceasing and the dust being scattered, dying as a lower ghost, cast into rivers and mountains, reborn as parents of life and death, likewise incurring guilt in hell, suffering torture at the Three Officials, raving and decaying, laden with calamity in the great darkness. The coming of calamity and misfortune is never without the cause of a reckless and dangerous mouth; the display of blessings has never failed to come from accumulated virtue. The form is as the image in a mirror, as the echo in a deep valley; there is near and far, the response must be to the far; afar there is no non-correspondence, near there is no failure of verification. The heavens’ retribution is swift without haste; the response to perception arrives without delay. Can one but be cautious?

The Supreme Command declares: To transmit the heavenly scripture and bring disaster upon one’s ancestors is a grievous crime of proclamation, a warning against breach of covenant and leakage. This scripture is the Jade Pure Emperor Lord’s, the sudden and momentary transformation of the Cavernous Union, the exalted mysterious Three Essentials of the Supreme Ultimate. One is the Way of Seven Transformations, the root of birth of Taiyi’s infant brother, without the chapter of the myriad transformations of the Noble Youth. Hence, looking upon myriad things, the Supreme Mysterious shines through the cavity, sudden and momentary, the celestial balance follows its course, returning to the infant self-generated, the cinnabar core is protected and stabilized, revolving to the left in the Nine Heavens, inverting the seven luminaries, the seven luminaries operate the scenes — this is called the Seven Transformations. The Feminine One unites the scenes; the Emperor Lord internally resides; the Five Spirits and Eight Intervals, the Mysterious Mother faces south; the right revolves the eight breaths, the thread is woven by a million, flying and scattering, the great mixed infant children, the nine truths receive breath, the Mysterious Father is in the north, extending the body to equal the heavens, participating in the dawn of the morning sky. When the Nine Thoughts exist, the golden form shines in the Eastern Splendor, the jade form sheds in the Emperor’s gate, the divine five elders leap through the three origins, the spiritual feathers spread in the sky, breath forms the celebratory clouds, also able to produce water and fire, emitting light ten thousand zhang, bearing the precious radiance on the neck, floating and roaming through the nine dawns, dividing forms and scattering scenes, positioned as the Supreme True. Therefore, he who obtains this Way is the true spirit emperor; he who loses this Way descends into the springs of the nine earths. The secret of this Way is the great marvel of the Cavernous Spirit. Again, feminine and masculine mix as one, the Emperor Lord subtly transforms, Taiyi preserves the spirit, the Mysterious Mother births infants, three, five, seven, nine, the nine revolutions harmonize the radiance, the original perception and shining brightness without the mark of the Noble Youth, dwelling in truth to its utmost. It is indeed hard to seek outside; thus one must search inwardly, remove stagnation and smooth the obscure. Hence the immortals may be sought by the ultimate refinement of essence; the true man may be seen by cultivating will and nature; myriad spirits may be made to obey by purity and stillness being difficult. Therefore, the Taiyi Emperor Lord uses the purple chamber as the union, the Mysterious Father and Mother use the three terraces as divine illumination, the eight elements conceal the mystery, true thought is the supreme command, secret words use the nine truths as the internal scripture, divine law with refined thought is the deepest, returning to infancy to penetrate truth is to obtain spirit, the great cavernous is the supreme primordial, the great elixir is the feminine one and three essentials as internal essence, the Old Lord uses Nature as the morning honor, the Most High uses Non-Noble as the mysterious essence, the Yellow Elder uses will and nature as the root of the Way, the White Origin uses purity and stillness as the entrance to truth, the true man merges breath and descends mutually, the essentials of immortality complete through spiritual perception and the Way’s accomplishment.

Here the Feminine One advances into the cinnabar core, the Emperor Lord guards the six palaces, the great cavernous chants in the silent chamber, the eight sounds scatter in the nine voids, the seven trials receive wisdom from the fetal immortals, obtain heavenly blessings from the divine directions, celebrate the Mysterious Father at the spiritual capital, congratulate the Mysterious Mother at the Jade chamber, accumulated perceptions arise in an inch, transformations scale the lofty peaks, shining and gazing through the nine dawns, the body ascends the splendid carriage, majestic and profound, blessings immeasurable. These are the precious instructions of the treasured practice; if the disciple contemplates and acts thus, he shall ascend to the bright day sky.

Whoever wishes to read the "Great Cavernous True Scripture" must first read the Supreme Emperor Lord’s Twelve Wishes, the Jade Pure Mysterious Mother’s eight gates and intervals; next, read the Central Huang-Lao’s "Cavernous Chamber Five Spirits Scripture"; after three years, then may he receive the right to read the "Great Cavernous True Scripture." This leads and guides the divine fluids, penetrates the spiritual sources, secures the purple chamber, cleanses and illuminates the cinnabar core, nourishes the Taiyi, opens and releases the three barriers, guards the seven transformations, condenses and harmonizes the original spirit, mixes and transforms the three and five, ten thousand transformations of the nine mysteries. Practicing the fetal breath, one’s eyes witness the great void, accommodating the mysterious spirit, the divine plate is empty, the twelve wishes come with birth, the eight intervals’ course contain the truth and roam, guarded by Huang-Lao, written by the Supreme, thus called Feminine One, the origin of the cavernous chamber. Read it ten thousand times, and one gains the way of immortality. Yet one does not at once transcend the floating scenes, nor ascend the carriage and descend the void, nor rein the whirlwind and break the reins, nor leap through the three mysteries; nor does one immediately obtain the command over the eight scenes, nor control the nine dawns of the sky, nor ascend into the Jade Pure and become a high truly immortal. Only by reading the "Great Cavernous True Scripture" does one attain these acts. But to practice Feminine One, one must diligently and painfully arouse perception, search and perfect the extremely subtle truth; only after three years may one receive the right to read the "Great Cavernous True Scripture." One must first guard the Taiyi, mix with the Emperor Lord, transform feminine and masculine, preserve the principle of the nine truths, then chant the great wishing, the twelve connected phases, then sing the eight gates of the Mysterious Mother in sequence, next read the great elixir cavernous chamber’s mystery to determine immortality, called the sure immortal.

Those called the Primordial Lords are all female spirits. The Feminine One cavernous chamber Three Essentials Primordial Lords are these. One must first preserve the remembrance of the Three Essentials Primordial Lords of the cavernous chamber; after three years, then may one receive the right to read the "Great Cavernous True Scripture." The reason the great cavernous is called a true scripture is because preserving the remembrance of the Three Primordial Lords is difficult. He who can reach the subtle mysterious refined thought and perceive the Three Essentials Primordial Lords has accomplished the Way of the true man.

The White Essence Primordial Lord is the mother of the Right White Primordial Lord. If the disciple preserves the utmost refinement of remembrance of her, the Way of Immortality is attained. The Yellow Essence Primordial Lord is the mother of the Central Huang-Lao Lord; if the disciple perceives her, longevity of ten thousand years is granted, and beyond those ten thousand years one ascends to the three mysteries. The Purple Essence Primordial Lord is the mother of the Left Non-Noble Lord. If the disciple preserves the thought of the cavernous chamber and suddenly perceives the Three Primordial Lords, he will immediately ascend the bright day, wearing flowing bells and tiger talismans, roaming the Jade Pure. The "Great Elixir Secret Scripture" calls the Three Essentials the utmost essence; this is their meaning. The cavernous chamber Three Essentials Primordial Lords, White Essence, Non-Noble, and Huang-Lao Lords’ mothers, are thus called the Three Essentials Primordial Lords, all females. The three daughters share one mother, whose name is the Great Essence Three Primordial Lord. The Great Essence Three Primordial Lord is indeed a single female. This one female gave birth to three daughters, hence called the Three Essentials Primordial Lords. According to tradition, Non-Noble, Huang-Lao, and White Essence Lords are the children of the Three Essentials Three Primordial Lords and the grandchildren of the Great Essence Three Primordial Lord. They form a void embryo and are born relying on splendour, their birth likewise in the supreme Shangqing treasure essence of the nine mysteries of the Jade Emperor of Heaven. Then descending into the cavernous chamber, they ascend together with their own bodies. These three sons and three lords dwell in the celestial chamber of the heavenly origin, in the empty chamber of the upper origin, namely White Essence, Non-Noble, and Huang-Lao, all males. Born of the void truth to complete the three male forms, receiving the spirit and harmonious jade morning breath, they thus form human shape, not by the union of yin and yang conception. Further, White Essence, Non-Noble, and Central Huang-Lao are all titles of Shangqing celestial officials. There are also true immortal essences receiving scriptural posts, which correspond to these titles, not necessarily all born of the void. Amongst the heavens all have them. He who obtains birth from the void merges the wonderful original elements, unites true elegant brightness, embodies broad splendour, spirits encircle the nine mysteries, spontaneously born by response, harmonizing breath with the void, spiritual fans ascend high, raise transformation to myriad directions, then before breath is apparent, things correspond and respond, following the place of perception, heaven and earth mutually descend. If the mind is not one, a hundred worries arise; if the spirit is not subtle, breath is not true; if thought is not moved, the Way does not abide; if essence is not firm, the departure from the Way is distant. Do not behold corpses or blood, nor treat death as life; do not with impurity place your heart; do not with lusts be unchaste; do not be drunk on the Way; do not let five tastes be full; do not with double heart be confused; do not seek life by evil; do not fear the trial of demons; do not regard ghosts as spirits; do not advance by rank and emolument; do not be filled with fair adornments; do not prize wealth; do not act unjustly; do not take the vulgar for joy; do not contend for rank and position; do not compete to disturb the truth; do not be moved by the ear with voices; do not be burdened by pollution; true immortals depart your court; preserve remembrance without perception, truly because the body is not refined; he who can understand the great cavernous precepts, myriad spirits are quieted and at peace. Those things men ought not do are many; if one must break the reins of the void and the void, dwell the heart at the cavernous gate, embody simplicity and purity, the spirit guards the hidden origin, bow thrice at the master’s window, open and beg the profound gate; if strong, then must be weak; if firm, then must be broken; then heaven’s sincerity is clear outside, the cavernous mystery fragrant and without ears; and the natural is exceedingly rare; to learn and act upon it is difficult. If you must be Feminine One, and study the great cavernous, do not forget these words.

The "Great Cavernous True Scripture" does not exist upon the earthly world, the five sacred mountains, or the heavens. It is especially treasured and forbidden by the Shangqing celestial spirits; one must fast bitterly for three years to obtain the right to read it. Whoever can read the Thirty-nine Chapters of the "Great Cavernous True Scripture" ten thousand times, the Central Huang-Lao Primordial Lord petitions above, and the Most High commands a cinnabar whirlwind green covered carriage; the nine spirit envoys of Taiyi the Director of Life come to receive the disciple. Then the Five Elders fan the pavilion, the eight winds spread feathers, divine lightning leads before, the Jade Radiance supports the wheel; thus one may ride the clouds and drive dragons, ascend the bright day to the Most Supreme Three Nones’ palace to receive the Scripture.

Those who comprehend the "Great Cavernous True Scripture" are always able to ride the Yellow and White clouds, employ the thirty-two Jade Maidens and the thirty-two Jade Boys, hold the blue tassels, drive the dragon of the blue scene, wear tiger talismans, don the lotus crown, purple embroidered robes, crimson flying skirts, shake ringing bells, strike jade bells, the jade truth opens the moonlight mirror, the golden immortal wears the nine mysteries emblem, purple canopy with four shades, splendid banners surround the wheel. Also wearing nine red spotted patterns to seal mountains and summon clouds, at dawn ascend the Tai Chi golden hall, at dusk roam the dark center of Taihua, carve and fix the golden script, become a high true immortal, govern immortal texts, command myriad spirits, rank as Tai Chi’s left minister, minor immortal king, enter the imperial palace, appear at the golden court. If one performs the complete ritual, condenses the scene forming jades, breath roams the eight elements, body refines jade morning, chants the three and five, accommodates the nine truths, the great light conceals brilliance, contends with jade mystery, upholds the destruction of demons, controls the flavor of the tiger pattern, then one obtains to harness the reins of the three origins, fixes the jade truth script, turns the carriage in cold brilliance, arrays the ranks of high true immortals, ranked as Tai Chi’s left and right immortal officials, commanding the five departments and three heavens’ immortal officers, the Jade Boys and Maidens attending in order. According to the Jade Emperor’s regulations, when opening the scripture one must screen left and right, wash hands, feet, face and eyes, then may one view it. Also always burn incense on left and right to manifest the high spiritual virtue, place it in a separate case to distinguish the gates of myriad wonders. Thus harmonize the sounds and chant, soar and brighten the eight mysteries, breath reach clear skies, moisten the nine fluids, summon the spiritual radiance’s obscure brilliance, preserve the decayed old and prolong existence. Then the faint voice has chanted, smoke disperses in the void, perceives the supreme king above the void, the Great Essence of the Cavernous Void, shines through the nine revolutions, the divine essence of the eight scriptures, great blessings enjoy the mysterious leaves, original good scatters among the close, thus life and death are both attained, fanning the seven generations, receiving transformation at the southern ferry, ancestral tests long preserved, body in the cinnabar palace, fixedly determining rebirth as fetal immortals. Great indeed is the wondrous scripture, lofty and spiritual, profound and very strange, blessings immeasurable. The chapter titles are as follows; the student should learn them.

### The Jade Scripture Formula Composed by the Central Huang-Lao Lord

He who receives the great cavernous formula must first observe the supreme feminine and masculine united transformations of the Emperor Lord’s twelve wishes, the Mysterious Mother’s eight gates and intervals, the essence of the nectar and preserved fruits; if lacking these treasures, the blessings are incomplete; if present, then they are bestowed. Because of this, it informs the bright morning of the Nine Heavens, manifests the nectar breath to summon spirits, uses the breath of sun radiance and moon luminescence to shine in the eastern well. On the nights of the ninth day of the first month, eighth day of the second month, seventh day of the third, sixth day of the fourth, fifth day of the fifth, fourth day of the sixth, third day of the seventh, second day of the eighth, first day of the ninth, tenth day of the tenth, eleventh day of the eleventh, and twelfth day of the twelfth month, one should perform the rites in a secret chamber, avoid filthy breath, and not tread upon turbidness. The golden flower great cavernous original method is not transmitted to those not of immortal talent. The Way of the Five Star Immortal Halls is thus called the rite of offerings; a small oral transmission, the formula is insufficiently recorded.

The Emperor Lord’s Twelve Wishes are: Wish Heaven, Wish Earth, Wish Wind, Wish Cloud, Wish Yin, Wish Yang, Wish Great Void, Wish Great Nothingness, Wish Great Emptiness, Wish Great Abundance, Wish Self-Generation, Wish Divine Birth.

Great indeed is the grace of the Emperor Lord, myriad blessings return to the origin mirror.

Again, the wish of the Eight Gates Mysterious Mother, the creation of the divine eight intervals’ chant, the Nine Spirits gaze together.

The highest wish is that the Mysterious Mother be born with me among the vital breath, enabling purple scenes to shine in the void, heaven and man unite in symbols, fly truly on wings, and I with her together, heavenly music delights the heart, freeing and departing from a hundred worries, the Seven Mysteries praise blessings, supported by the highest spirit.

The disciple in a separate chamber must always read this scripture, not forgetting for a moment; this is the internal wish of the Emperor Lord opening the eight gates of goodness.

How can one substitute without cultivation, hear but not act? Though the form and spirit be refined, suffering from the endless births, and the seven generations bear sin and do not understand, he himself is secretly without immortal hope. Therefore one must open the great wishes, present the eight intervals, to dissolve the accumulated knots. Once the seven ancestors are blessed, the disciple may indeed be immortal. Immortality is the root and source of the Way, the origin of becoming an immortal. He who aspires to this task, can he not be diligent in long preservation?

### The Great Essence True Man’s Secret Morning Ritual and Wish Ascended Immortal Scripture Method

Having received the great cavernous supreme formula, practicing Feminine One, reading the Great Elixir Secret Jade Morning Golden Flower Scripture, one should monthly perform secret morning rites to the Great Essence Three Primordial Lords. On the nights of the tenth day of the first month, ninth day of the second, eighth day of the third, seventh day of the fourth, sixth day of the fifth, fifth day of the sixth, fourth day of the seventh, third day of the eighth, second day of the ninth, eleventh day of the tenth, twelfth day of the eleventh, and thirteenth day of the twelfth months, in a quiet sleeping chamber, burn incense facing north, hold in mind the Three Primordial Lords, bow twice, then sit or lie at ease, bow with the heart and recite as follows:

Respectfully open to the Supreme Great Dao, the exalted void Jade Morning Great Essence Purple Palace Three Primordial Emperor Lords, Central Huang-Lao, Non-Noble, White Origin, Jade Emperor Great Emperor, Five Elders High True, Supreme Ultimate Imperial Essence, Mysterious Emperor Jade Lord, I (name) am a disciple of the Great Cavernous Three Scenes, respectfully on this auspicious night, within the nine heavenly gates of the celestial pass, petitioning the Most High Great Essence, Three Primordial Three Essentials Lords, Jade Emperor True Lord, to grant longevity, transcendence of the world, ultimate longevity without limit of myriad myriads of years, at times riding the splendid morning green covered dragon chariot, ascending to the Purple Court, commanding myriad spirits, attending and guarding the Four Bright Great Essence Emperor Lords. Completed, bow thrice with the heart, swallow saliva nine times, and cease.

Always perform thus, and do not let others know. This is the Supreme Ultimate True Man’s secret morning worship of the Three Primordials, the night rite of wishes. Formerly Master An Jizhongzi, not knowing other ways nor practicing the great elixir rites, only occasionally obtained this secret morning method, kept it for thirty years, then obtained to ride clouds and storms, ascended to the mysterious continent. Immortals Wang Lubing, Zhao Shuangcheng, Fan Shuyou, Guan Ping’a, Li Mingxian, Yan Ansheng, and others all obtained this way, ascending to the Kunlun chamber, some dwelling in divine continents, others in mysterious official positions. The Great Essence Three Primordial Lords are females.

These are the true names of the Three Primordials Cavernous Mysterious Inner Precious Scripture; the external secret miscellaneous scripts’ names are all false and untrue.

No substances in clothing may be borrowed from different breaths; such matters all must be cautious. If the disciple cannot abstain from grains and refine thought truly, he should regulate pungent, foul, fishy, and bloody foods and mixed meat and spicy dishes, all to be strictly forbidden. If able to do so, then recovery is possible, and life may be long.

The Left Non-Noble Young Lord is master of condensing essence and solidifying spirit, spirit of the Three Primordials upper breath, condensing essence from heavenly essence, essence born returns to the three breaths.

Born above in voidness, below condensing the body, life within requires Five Spirits to manage its abode. The disciple should every evening preserve remembrance and chant it. If unable to silently recite, one may by day press the text and cultivate, no need for midnight, only at vital breath times.

The five females and nine males all are naked without garments, their appearance all like newborn infants. The five females and nine males each emit white breath from their mouths, mutually entwining and fumigating the disciple’s body, thick misty vapour. After a while, the five females and nine males along with the disciple’s body all mix and unite, transforming into a white breath, round like the sun’s light, in a cluster. Presently, the round white breath suddenly transforms into two small children, one male, one female, both as newborn infants, tiny and dim. The male is called the true of nine origins, the female is called the soul of the Supreme Emperor, the male named Ju Zhi, styled Three Yang, the female named Shang Gui, styled emperor’s child. Presently again the male child Ju Zhi and female child Shang Gui stand, respectively, in the sun and moon; the male in the sun, the female in the moon.

Completed, then again preserving this knot dispersed, the three red silks luxuriantly transform into a great fire to burn the disciple’s body, inside and outside, as if live coals, blazing and bright, thoroughly illuminating. After a while all complete. The reason it is fire is that a person’s body contains twenty-four fetal death knots, also twelve blood-stagnation death nodes, altogether one hundred and twenty knots, distributed among muscles and blood, within the nine barriers. Therefore this fire burns to scatter and dissolve them, using flaming fire to open and resolve. The disciple preserves the fire burning the body, after completion, then again preserve the Big Dipper’s seven stars, horizontally placed on the tongue of the mouth. Then preserve Taiyi Lord standing on the first star of the dipper’s head, also preserve Non-Noble Lord standing on the second star, preserve White Origin Lord standing on the third star, preserve Director of Fate Lord standing on the fourth star, preserve Tao Kang Lord standing on the fifth star. The five spirits all naked without clothing, like fetal infants. The five spirits each emit five colored breath to fumigate the Big Dipper’s seven stars, filling the disciple’s mouth, the five colored breath issues upwards, fumigating the spirit chamber. The spirit chamber is the disciple’s two eyes’ breath children. Suddenly seeing Purple Essence Primordial Lord sitting among the disciple’s left eye child, suddenly seeing White Essence Primordial Lord sitting among the disciple’s right eye child, suddenly seeing Yellow Essence Primordial Lord sitting between disciple’s eyebrows and nose forehead. The Three Essentials Primordial Lords all naked, each suck in five colored breath to fill themselves. The Purple Essence Primordial Lord’s left hand holds the disciple’s fate five talismans, White Essence Primordial Lord’s right hand holds the disciple’s fate five registers, Yellow Essence Primordial Lord embraces the disciple’s three souls. The three souls are three persons, form like disciple’s form, one foot eight inches tall. The Yellow Essence Primordial Lord sits squarely in the nose and forehead, facing outward and chants:

Three Primordials long remain, wrapping the spirit chamber, Jade Pure Emperor Lord, fixing registers anew, longevity without end, reliance of Five Spirits.

Completed. In a moment all mix and transform, all spirits’ forms and the disciple’s body blend and unite as one sun, hanging in the east, one or two zhang above the ground, as the sun just rising, shining brilliantly, illuminating the world, bright and clear. Then hearing the Great Essence Three Primordial Lords’ voices in the sun chanting:

I mix in the five breaths, together transform riding the sun carriage, quietly observing beyond the nine skies, breathing and receiving seven spirit essences, lingering in the nine mysteries inside, sitting and rising, rosy light born, Three Primordials remain in the spirit chamber, eyes bright and clear, looking and gazing through myriad years, bowing and surveying at the imperial court, Five Talismans given to the emperor’s child, returning to the infant, awaiting the jade true steps, holding hands ascending kalpa age.

Completed. After a while the disciple’s body is faint and blurry, unaware why and how, hearing and perceiving thus. Then slightly opening eyes, tapping teeth five times, with left hand’s third finger, pinch beneath the nose philtrum seven passes, with right hand’s third finger,
