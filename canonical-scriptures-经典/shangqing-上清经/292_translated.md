### The Mysterious Truth of the Supreme Eight Elements Scripture: The Wonderful Secret of the Three and Five Transformations of the Five Agents

The Four Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate consulted the Supreme Great Dao Lord, saying: "To take in the essence of the sun and moon, to hasten to the marvels of the two luminaries, the utmost marvel, the highest treasure, descending as the Divine Elixir, three combined forming virtue, we humbly receive the command. Is the Dao sufficient to rest here?"

The Supreme One answered: "Good indeed is this inquiry; it will benefit all. Whoever learns the Dao, all comes from accumulating goodness; among them are the arts and methods, internal and external assisting and completing. Breathing in and swallowing, taking the essence, are all arts and methods. The Three Wisdoms and Five Intelligences are all good deeds. Without establishing good deeds, the arts and methods have no efficacy; and even if efficacious, not lasting; long-lasting surely destroys the body. The superior man of great talent first establishes good deeds, then the arts and methods. The arts and methods are exceedingly many, many indeed without number, refined and coarse in order; though each depends on conditions, conditions range from coarse to marvelous; marvelous to the utmost is the threefold unity, here in the sun-moon Divine Elixir. If one desires swift effect, one must diligently practise myriad good deeds; myriad good deeds cannot be done all at once; practise them and yet do not know the essential point; the essential lies in the three and five; having obtained the three and five, myriad good deeds stand by themselves. Though the number be not abundant, within it one may find methods to cultivate. Arts and methods and good deeds, both active and reposeful, practised and accumulated long, not exceeding nine years, will surely obtain divine powers and ascend to saintly truth."

The Perfected bowed low and repeatedly asked: "May the essential of the three and five be heard?"

The Supreme One answered: "It may be heard, but do not transmit to persons unworthy. The three are wisdom; the five are intelligence. The three wisdoms are knowledge of Heaven, knowledge of Earth, knowledge of Man. Knowing man follows earth; tranquillity is the root; knowing earth follows heaven; harmony and compliance the foundation; knowing heaven follows the Dao; motion does not injure stillness. Stillness is ever clear and abiding; motion should benefit things, benefiting all, without name or boasting, without toil or anxiety, without weariness or refusal; this is bright knowledge. Clear and without doubt, combined with the virtue of the sun and moon, hence called the Three Wisdoms. Wisdom is knowledge. Knowing these three agents, one is fit to practise the Dao. The Dao is communication. Benevolence, righteousness, propriety, knowledge, and faith, the five together without obstruction; no obstruction, then communication; communication extends boundlessly. Things and self mutually generate; generation is most urgent; urgent action without slackening; resolution without doubt; benefits without end; hence called the Five Intelligences. The Five Intelligences joined with the Three Wisdoms, the Three Wisdoms communicating with the Five Intelligences; intelligence and wisdom without limit, wisdom without boundary; forgetting obstruction and attaining communication, long life without death, owing to the three and five. Myriad good deeds mutually complete; each has scriptures and precepts, rules and statutes, celestial patterns and terrestrial ordinances, human principles clear; fathers instruct sons, rulers command ministers, teachers educate disciples; the humble also offer to the honoured. Without mind, words are forgotten; with mind, they mutually augment; augmenting them without taking it as merit; merit forgetting name is supreme virtue; virtue attaining the Supreme Dao constantly without loss — this is the utmost for learners, the utmost source of the school."

The Perfected again asked: "The ineffable wondrous essence, I earnestly wish to proclaim and practise it; the superior to transform the inferior, the inferior to reverence the superior; the suitability of masters and disciples, scriptures and scrolls mutually have (their places), sometimes before, sometimes after, sometimes in the middle section, sometimes separate rites, sometimes transmitted formulae; generations differ, families are distinct, countries diverse; prolixity and brevity united; application much doubted; daring not to decide; bewildered and lost; the white day easily passes, an inch of time hard to keep; cultivation deviating from the body, increasing offences and faults; no means of salvation; bowing and looking with shame and fear; returning to the Heavenly Honoured; the Heavenly Honoured bending in pity; the precise essential meaning, I specially beg for precepts and words."

The Supreme One answered: "Learning must surely have a teacher; the teacher's mouth is fixed; all the writings of cultivation are to be forgotten; the differences of quantity and quality are fully intended; how can they be entirely expressed? The methods of transformation benefit all beings; beings have minds; urgent is encouragement and approach; straightway teach the essentials; good should be measured carefully; according to the time take rest; do not go against the source of the school." The Perfected rejoiced, kowtowed, and accepted the command.

The Supreme One said: "Therefore the noble man is equal to Heaven and Earth, because he can mutually instruct and guide. First learn to awaken, then perceive, returning the current to the one source; abandoning suffering is joy; this is precious and worthy of honour. Thus those who attain the Dao, immortals and perfected beings, though not yet the utmost great saints, afterwards all set forth mind and vow, following conditions and fate, responding and descending again among men; praising the wondrous method, accumulating virtue and merits, then ascending to great saintship. The capital of great saints lies in practising teaching; teaching and warnings are strict and clear; correcting evil by the right; compassion, joy, and relinquishment, the four grades are widely proclaimed. Those unable to do so, though day and night reciting scriptures, wearing talismans and charms, labour much and gain little. To accomplish the great vehicle, the great vehicle begins with universal aid; universal aid depends urgently on opening and transforming; urgently instruct beings; guard unity and preserve the three; practise the five non-obstructions; must investigate the great vehicle. Among them, small knowledge cannot bear the great method; the small follows the trust and acceptance. Conduct and concealment lie with the teacher; the teacher is clear and without error; diligently reflect inwardly; do not rashly proclaim; for oneself and for things; later body precedes earlier. If not a person of deep wisdom and penetrating insight, it is not to be spoken of this Dao. When practising transformation, first sincerely practise what is studied; what is studied has efficacy; though not yet complete, roughly can relieve urgency; urgent then practise it; waiting for perfection progress is slow; seeking perfection has no limit. Seeking perfection with limit depends on concurrent practice; concurrent practice, concurrent study; concurrent study, concurrent proof; when proof does not immediately come, long time will prove it; proof attaining its number, then Dao is attained. Attaining Dao, extreme cultivation cannot be immediately ascended; though immediate ascent is impossible, still should gradually practise. Practise according to time; act according to destiny; when destiny not met, cannot force time; easy to lose and suffer loss; losing time and forcing destiny, labouring and causing harm; meeting time and encountering destiny, leisure and preservation. The person of perfect virtue does not lose time and destiny; if time and destiny are not accordant, suspicion arises above and below; inner and outer guard against one another; yin and yang injure each other; this must not be violated. Violating it is deeply tested; hidden and manifest receive guilt; cannot be removed; desiring to avoid such calamity, carefully discern time and destiny. The four seasons and five agents follow in unbroken continuity; according to time practise without temporary negligence or retreat. When the feeling comes, destiny opens; each has its method. The three caverns’ various scriptures differ in method; when destiny prospers, use them; when destiny declines, discard; must not be disrespectful; reverence and use are equal; destiny has action and concealment; Dao has no light or heavy. Transforming body, transforming family; transforming township, transforming country; transforming the world; the world does not agree with one another; do not violate it. Country, township, family, body, all the same method. Body practice must not be forced; forcing only damages; suffering force causes deterioration; retreat and defeat become calamity; falling into hell; forever separated from heaven; human body still cannot obtain, what hope for immortals and perfected beings? The Perfected’s learning begins with self-testing; first practise some accepted matter; if possible then advance; if not possible then stop. Stopping is not evil; again consider conditions; conditions not deep, slowly and carefully advance; if advance is possible then proceed; if not then cease again. Ceased, again begin; shame and fear screen and close; must not face retreat; discuss with others. Silently and secretly practise again; one matter three times; three times if not possible, can change method. Methods are countless; according to reception, carry out; practice transformation, transformation of body; then reach things; from one body reach the world; up to the boundless. The world is all the same; secretly practise this method; this method refines the mind; mind refines the substance; substance refined, mind pure; true attainment is assured.

In all practising wondrous transformation, first transform the body; transforming the body is first to resolve the Dao. The Dao is in the heart; the heart stores the Dao; the Dao cannot be seen; the heart must not be forgotten; not forgetting the heart is storing the Dao firmly and uprightly. The right Dao is in the heart; the heart’s affairs not harboring evil; evil dares not interfere; this is called will; the will of the Dao is firm; it is accomplished in affairs. How is it firm? Firm by great compassion; compassion and love all things; not different from one’s own body; body does not harm things; things do not harm body; all contain qi; trees, grasses, soil, ashes are all as one’s own body; think of them as children; no arising of arrogance; no wounding of their hearts; heart constantly thinks of them; together with self they abide. The wise wish their own advance in the Dao; the unwise wish their knowledge to be born; this accords with Heaven’s virtue; the foremost of myriad good deeds; long practice brings clear light; with sun and moon equally bright.

In all practising wondrous transformation, first transform the body; transforming the body is first to resolve the Dao; having resolved the Dao, next guard virtue. Virtue is within the consciousness; in the consciousness is spirit; spirit in consciousness is firm in Dao; guarding virtue accomplishes truth; this is what the Perfected practice; practising good not forgetting; remembering it without loss; called consciousness. Consciousness practises good and charity; life after life as the beginning; next using frugality and caution; cautious to the end as in the beginning; no failure, no mixture; called the Perfected. Diligent and careful not forgetting; moving body hidden in stillness; for affairs appearing then responding to time; when time departs then fading away; not lingering on things. Sounds and colors cannot defile; hardship and shame cannot burden; in times of wealth and honour not accumulating nor prideful; not arrogant nor extravagant; not splendid nor dazzling. In days of poverty and lowliness not flattering nor deceitful; not artificial nor thievish; not loud nor boisterous. Dwelling in the middle has constancy; thick and thin taken in the mean; latent light spreading reality; holding integrity using reverence; integrity has noble reward; true light draws the fruit of the Mysterious Truth; cultivating frugality without rest; with sun and moon joining virtue.

In all practising wondrous transformation, first transform the body; transforming the body is first to resolve the Dao; next guard virtue; finally humility. Humility is knowledge, adaptation, foundation. The consciousness spirit has knowledge of Dao and knowledge of virtue; Dao esteems virtue as noble; not to rashly seek; seek it with humility; humble to govern self; position and power in front; retreating body behind. Order is behind; no coveting ahead; always dwell beneath the masses; the place of ultimate base; that which men do not contend for; customs not busy with; resting without vexation; thinking of Dao increasingly firm; guarding virtue more stable. Where all beings abide, all that they cannot do; oneself alone can do it; surpassing the crowd and exceeding the multitude; spirit and brightness praised; correct truth aided; moving down and rising up; from earth ascending to heaven; abandoning the mundane entering the saintly; thus becoming the source of great wisdom; all that is revered; Heaven and men look up to. Through peaceful retreating of self, measuring others and enabling; dwelling behind then returning ahead; humility and yielding thereby gaining more; not still is most mighty; not daring to take lead; self thereby foremost; among men the honoured; Heaven and Earth united as one; white day rising in the morning. Utmost of stars; truth of the Three Wisdoms; truly in compassion and frugality; not daring to take lead; the marvel of wisdom.

In all practising wondrous transformation, first transform the body; transforming the body is to practise the Three Wisdoms; having practised the Three Wisdoms, then follow the Five Intelligences. The Five Intelligences are benevolence, propriety, faith, righteousness, and knowledge. The penetrating Three Wisdoms encompass the Five Intelligences; among the Five Intelligences, knowledge is the Three Wisdoms. Learning not fully attained; Three Wisdoms not mutually encompassing; cultivation not open; Five Intelligences not united. Hence establishing names is diverse; three and five differ. But then in the Five Intelligences knowledge is not yet extreme; the extreme lies in the three united as one; one united no longer five. Benevolence, propriety, faith, righteousness also have divisions of knowledge; knowledge divided into four; by four is formed; without these four knowledge cannot stand. The four have less division; therefore they do not take the name knowledge; knowledge divided is many; thus with four virtues makes five; five virtues mutually linked, equal and without bias. Without bias there is no longer the name five; original name with three wisdoms is one. Three wisdoms first unite; one then has five; called the six penetrations; after thorough understanding, there is no longer three. Three and five now matched, called the seven awakenings; awakened and clear; ultimate boundless. There are numbers and countless; bright and unobstructed; dividing then dividing; combining then combining; combining does not burden division; division does not burden combining; combined then generally called one; divided then briefly named seven. Seven levels showing gradual progress; leading the end back to the source: consciousness spirit produces knowledge, this is the first; knowing and able to see, second; seeing and able to follow, third; following and able to practise, fourth; practising and able to be firm, fifth; firm and able to complete, sixth; completing and not dwelling, seventh. Seven awakenings, seven levels, from one awakening; awakening has shallow and deep; order as seven; passing beyond this, entering the source of Dao. Eight reachings without end; not words can express; words cannot exhaust; silent consciousness self-understood; silent consciousness self-understood, its words forgotten; forgetting words attains Dao; above Dao.

In all practising wondrous transformation, first transform the body; transforming the body is to follow the Five Intelligences. The benevolent love life and hate killing; save the failing and protect the complete; forbid killing and wounding; cut off jealousy; able to harmonize yin and yang; release life and ferry over the dead; compassion and satisfaction; remembrance unforgotten; accumulating benevolence lengthens life; thus ascending to spirit immortality. What spirit immortals value is the mutual generation; generation and growth unceasing; hidden and manifest successively transmitted; transmission and practice have qi; qi and substance have name. The name benevolence governs wood; wood produces fire; fire is propriety. Propriety is reverence inside and outside; saluting with ceremony; revering the Three Honoured; honouring nourishment and valuing harmony; forbidding pride and arrogance; cutting off greed and lust; able to be pure, chaste, and honest; long enduring then spirit immortals. Fire produces earth; earth is faith. Faith is central truthfulness without falsehood; vow not to break; forbidding deceit and fraud; punishing those who deceive within; able to have heart and mouth corresponding; trustworthy and manifest; sincere, thick, and honest; long enduring then spirit immortals. Earth produces metal; metal is righteousness. Righteousness is clear in judging right and wrong; rewarding good and punishing evil; removing evil and pursuing right; deciding suspicion and settling doubt; giving up wealth and not stealing; restraining violence and aiding the weak; forbidding confusion and doubt; evil views and suspicion; the strong and self-willed; stealing public and private; able to reward blessings and stop calamity; govern disorder and stop violence; pure, simple, broad and ample; long enduring then spirit immortals. Metal produces water; water is knowledge. Knowledge is knowing all clearly; distinguishing true and false; forbidding treachery and evil; foolishness, ignorance, and obstruction; able to be clear, calm, and penetrating; diligently learning and teaching; good at guiding without weariness; long enduring then spirit immortals. The five virtues unevenly many; have merit and fault; have advance and retreat; mutually compensating and redeeming. Many good receive blessing; many evil receive calamity; calamity and blessing have no gate; only summons of man; summons not exclusive; good and evil interchange; though blessing reaches heaven, still has decline; calamity enters hell, yet has transcendence. All are not of the path of Dao; truly companions of the common world; roughly knowing trust towards, cannot attain truth. The way of true immortals entrusted to superior men aspiring; aspiring men with high aspirations; all love to learn true immortality; diligently practise the Three Wisdoms; carefully cultivate the Five Intelligences. The Three Wisdoms equally together practised; no bias nor attachment; accumulated long and thoroughly communicated; able to ascend to great saint; united with Dao to attain truth; mutually transmitting; must obtain the person. Learning not knowing the three and five, is only to labour in vain. The wise keep it secret; secretly practise and do not divulge.

In all practising wondrous transformation, first transform the body; transforming the body is first to receive the method. Receiving method without fasting; rashly transmitting; or fasting and abstinence not exact; tokens not complete; or forcibly demanding by colluding with power; not following teacher’s method; or opportunely meeting and not seeking clear teacher; or mystery alliance not purified; tokens not delivered; initially desiring to cultivate, swiftly abandoning; or again doubting; slandering and exposing; forms and words foul and ugly; defiling and insulting in myriad ways; or secret without understanding; unintentionally investigating and seeking; offerings violating rules; giving and placing not according to; slighting spiritual texts; caring for self possession; sometimes stealing or begging, secretly viewing and rashly acting. Offending these sins, wind blades without origin; urgently should confess and apologize; wash the heart and cleanse the intestines; return to the Blue Youth; bow and worship for first offence; three years without changing; sins surely forgiven; afterwards not repeating; then may practise scripture. If fortune is not suitable, because功德功德功德功德功德功德功德功德功德功德功德功德功德功德功德功德功德功德功德功德功德 only the Blue Youth remains; opens and penetrates consciousness; unties knots of calamity and disaster; brings down bright illumination of the cave; makes clear the profound meaning; self-reflects on conditions; cultivation swift in effect; able to complete utmost truth.

The Law of Preserving the Blue Youth Lord

In the middle of the Eastern Sea is the mountain Fangzhu, originally named the Eastern Ridge, the Eastern Flower Palace; circumference three thousand li; there are six gates.

The East Gate named Blue Flower Gate; gate official surname Li, named Bo Yuan; in charge of the register of learning immortals and recorded scriptures.

The South Gate named Divine Flower Jade Gate; gate official surname Wang, named Zu Si; in charge of the Perfected Flying Immortals coming and going.

The West Gate named Jade Cave Gate; gate official surname Kang, named Shang Jie; in charge of the exalted multitudes of Perfected, Jade Emperor, thirty-nine Emperors, twenty-four Jade Perfected, Western Turtle Queen Mother coming and going.

The North Gate named Jade Yin Gate; gate official surname Shi, named Shao Ye; in charge of true immortals and beginners, recording their punishment, correction, and descent.

The Southeast Gate named Heavenly Pass Gate; gate official surname Wen, named Wu Che; in charge of the register of destiny and conditions, the place where immortals are obtained.

The Northeast Gate named Cold Water Gate; gate official surname Zhong, named Lin Du; in charge of spirits’ transfer and narration.

These six gates govern the Eastern Ridge of Heaven; mountain gates have lions and giant huntsmen each three hundred; gate guards each three thousand. Those learning the Dao first know the order of gate names; those with knowledge do not die; the name is entered at the Blue Palace. Enter the chamber and burn incense; always preserve the gate name, and the gate official’s surname and given name; after nine years one obtains riding on clouds, ascending into the six gates.

Within the six gates are three palaces; the first palace named Fangzhu Blue Palace; the chief minister is the Blue Youth Lord.

The second palace named Jade Preserving Blue Palace; the chief minister is the Grand Marshal Gao Chen.

The third palace named Jade Flower Blue Palace; the Blue Flower Little Youth of the Eastern Sea is in charge.

These three palaces, within the inner palace, have hundreds of jade trees; above are the Kun rooster, phoenix, and nine-colored birds; below are magical grasses, jade wells with springs arising spontaneously; drinking from them grants life equal to the three lights (sun, moon, stars). Lions and heavenly beasts assist in guarding outside the walls.

All who learn the Dao and have not yet succeeded are due to sins and obstacles; they should purify and fast, burning incense, confessing sins and requesting blessings. On the day and hour of Dingmao, going out to the dewy ground; if it rains, remain in the hall; concentrate the heart eastward; knock teeth three times; close eyes and envision the three palaces; think of the chief minister Blue Youth Lord, within Fangzhu Blue Palace, within the golden hall and jade chamber; three thousand multitudes of Perfected maidens attend, guarding left and right; mysterious radiance shining by itself; spirit burning and bright; blue mist shading above; purple clouds encircling. On the northern hall above is a jade board; on the board is the register of learning immortals, recording mysterious names, years and months; ten thousand pieces of golden slips and jade tags; the immortal officials keep them. Imagine my name remaining among them; hold this slowly; then see the Blue Youth Lord’s appearance and brightness; resplendent and brilliant; firm heart and folded hands; stating rank and name; now sincerely return and bow to the chief minister Blue Youth Lord; then perform three bows. After bowing, still prostrate secretly knocking each three times; secretly say: “I beg pardon for this humble one, so and so, for past and present grave offenses and heavy sins; open the heart and enlighten the mind; make clear the mysterious scripture; self-know destiny; quickly become a spirit immortal; family and door flourish; Dao and virtue spread abroad.” Having finished, again bow three times; three knocks at end. Also may face north; every sixty days perform one ritual. Regarding preserving thought, always keep in heart. If cannot obtain the Dingmao day, other Mao days may be used. If cannot perform every sixty days, may be done four times a year. Those who perform the ritual lightly, sin accumulated hard to accumulate; not precise, not changed; labouring in vain increasing faults. Must be able to reach yearly one ritual with satisfaction and fullness; better than many times and superficial. Unless every sixty days one cultivates, all are one ritual of three hundred and sixty bows, up to three thousand six hundred bows end. If body not greatly fatigued, may perform one day and night twelve hours; one hour three hundred bows; all sum three thousand six hundred. After ritual think of faults and amend; do not again repeat; preserve good deeds; no respite allowed; thus three years, the Three Honoured descend and appear.
