The Supreme Emperor addressed the Perfected Ones of the Four Extremities, saying:  
“Now, there are those who hold an earnest faith in the supreme Way, who cultivate and learn without slackening; all these have already accumulated good deeds in former lives, and are born among the heavens above. In the heavens they enjoy felicity; yet unable to advance in merit, at the end of their term they are sent forth to be reborn in the world below. Some make vows and open their hearts, seeking birth in the human realm, to save beings and establish merit, diligently practicing the higher Way — these are not common folk. But common folk neither perceive nor know themselves, and if they do know, they do not declare it. Such persons cannot escape calamity or misfortune: some among their kin decline and perish; some suffer infirmity and disease; some are troubled by disputes public or private; some meet with hidden or manifest dangers; evil men, ugly spirits, poisonous beasts, birds, and insects; even the elements of metal, wood, water, fire, earth, and grass bring hindrance. This is because their merit is not yet complete, and their reception of the Law is not yet perfect. Urgently purify by fasting and self-reproach; confess faults and beg blessings; keep the essence of the Supreme One pure; guard the One without forgetting; practice the three and five (precepts); attentively recall the Mysterious Master. The Mysterious Master, the Azure Youth Lord, commands all scriptures, treasured writings, and wondrous diagrams — all come from him.  
Scholars who seek the Master yet do not meet him, or seek the scriptures but do not obtain them, or obtain but have insufficiency, or sufficiency but lack clarity, or clarity but do not practice, or practice but not long, or have many omissions and faults and cannot remember or know; or though they remember and know, they soon forget — these are disturbed by evil spirits and tested by demons.  
Urgently select an auspicious day, a day of the Dingmao (Fire-Rabbit) cycle; ascend the mountain or enter the chamber; purify strictly, burn incense; open the announcement to the Supreme One; attentively retain the Azure Youth; face east and fix the mind; imagine the palaces of the directions; bow and worship, facing the golden gate and high ministers; in weakness, hardship, and calamity, perform the usual six bows; after the bows, knock the head and secretly state bitter intentions; whether public or private obstacles, or lapses of mind and memory — speak according to your vow.  
Point out those immediate afflictions; do not speak of trivial or delayed matters. If there are matters great and small, record them fully and distinctly; after worship, read them secretly; if you hear nothing after the reading, then burn them; if not, do likewise.  
If vigor is strong, it is proper to perform twelve bows, twenty-four bows, thirty-six bows, seventy-two bows, one hundred and twenty bows, two hundred and forty bows, three hundred and sixty bows, seven hundred and twenty bows, one thousand two hundred bows — completing these in one sitting, fixing the mind, increasing goodness. If still unable, during the hours from Yin to Chou (3 a.m. to 2 a.m.), perform one hundred bows; if able, two hours at Yin and Shen (3–5 a.m. and 3–5 p.m.), or Zi and Wu (11 p.m.–1 a.m. and 11 a.m.–1 p.m.) as suits capacity.  
Usually perform this for sixty days or one hundred days; do not postpone to other days.  
Fellow practitioners must be three or five persons; do not bring many or make noise; leakage of the examination is unforgivable.  
Those who pursue higher learning must be diligent and cautious in cultivating this method; only then may they transmit the scripture as teachers; one must obtain the proper person and entrust without remorse.

If teachers transmit the scripture but do not find the proper person, or if the person is improper and the transmission not according to the Law, then after entrustment, within twelve cycles of ten days, many calamities will accumulate; urgently thank the Azure Youth, bitterly repent and receive blessings, and also open to bear grace.  
After receiving the Way, if one cultivates according to the Law, then within ninety days no calamity or illness shall come; this is one who is united with the immortals of former and present good fortune.  
Within one hundred and ninety-two cycles (i.e., 360 days), affairs prosper both public and private; this is one united with the True Ones.  
Three cycles amounting to four years and one thousand two hundred days, merit flourishes, reverence deepens in hidden and manifest realms; this is the utmost diligence of a superior person, united with the Divine Ones.  
Then transmit and teach broadly, to save the worthy and enlightened, to aid the common and those who love widely; with a compassionate heart establish merit, widely benefit without selfishness; thus may one ascend to the august ranks of the Sage Divine True Immortal Lords, the seats of emperors, princes, and ministers.

But if after receiving the Way, within a hundred days there arise calamities and illnesses, these are many sins of former and present lives; not one united with the immortals.  
Urgently one must first give thanks, vow to reform heart and conduct, change the past and cultivate the future; seek help from teachers and friends; wash away regrets; be earnest and sincere in resolve; reverently believe without doubt; assuredly one will receive blessings.  
Within one hundred and ninety-two cycles, according to this standard, establish virtue and merit, avoid perils, be ever cautious and fearful, constantly harbor shame and dread; ashamed of deep sins, ashamed of no great merits, one must not be a teacher, and be careful not to transmit.  
As virtue and accomplishment gradually rise, at fifty-eight or forty years, then select persons to initiate and entrust.  
If calamities are strong and actions forced, and one is mistakenly taken as teacher, both sides err; all are evil causes and conditions.  
Those who are steadfast but do not fast or observe the Way, teachers will form mutual bonds, pray for them, first confess faults and entreat grace with utmost sincerity and earnestness; avoid false adornment and careless conduct; have heart and not mere words.  
Do not speak of it to others, calling it merit; only with earnestness and secrecy do both sides obtain blessing; those who pursue higher learning clearly observe and follow.

All who have not yet ceased birth and death are so because the roots of sin have not been removed; passing out of yin and into yang, their activity is excessive; excess accumulates and leads to death; death’s suffering is to be lamented; this is what superior persons fear.  
Diligently seek life, receive scriptures and observe precepts; employ techniques to ward off calamities, resolve sins, and extend blessings, to ascend to spirit and immortality.  
Beginners in the method first must confess and entreat grace; from beginningless times they have come, from countless ancestors; now in this body of seven generations of parents, good and evil are interrelated; among seven generations some have attained the Way, and have been wise and talented; their merit manifests in hidden and manifest realms; remaining blessings are gathered; many sins are easily absolved; but for stubborn, wicked, and rebellious persons, many calamities are hard to remove.  
Also, from beginningless times to the seven ancestors, yin and yang transgressions, some light, some heavy: the heavy are hard to expel, the light easy to remove.  
Easy to remove are those who observe precepts and establish merit; soon after they feel effect; hard to expel are those who diligently labor for years without response.  
Those without response tend to become lax and retreat, not realizing their original offense is deep; they become resentful that deities show no effect; this adds to evil conditions, and their sins may not be pardoned.  
If one can be diligent, vow to die without slackening, surely good effects will come, turning calamity into blessing.  
Among these, ancestors and former selves with much merit now add cultivation and speed the fruition.  
Those unclear say their merit is not enough to be called so; they claim attainment of the Way; or say it is empty and false; or say it is natural and not learned; such persons are not to be taught; they forever lose the Way’s conditions and become devil bands, with birth and death unending; deeply to be lamented.  
Those wise and penetrating, talented and earnestly believing have no such doubts; diligent in practice without slackening, small or great difficulties, prolonged accumulation, all can attain the Way.  
To attain the Way and long life, one must do good, cease evil, have a firm and steadfast heart and will, hold precepts so as not to violate the Three Honours or send away the Five Virtues; silently recognize and secretly act; not forget to speak.  
Good and evil are not necessarily to be practiced; doing good need not be public; crowds suspect and bring reproach, and doubts and envy give rise to calamity.  
Therefore the highest sages say that goodness is not goodness; to know goodness as goodness is not goodness.  
Those who can know goodness do not vaunt themselves, do not arrogate correctness, do not design schemes, do not consider it good, but are calm as if without; these attain the Way.  
Without comrades, one must not speak rashly; speak only what may be transformed; if not a proper person, do not coerce.  
The easy path is ninety-two cycles; the difficult one two hundred forty-six; at the extreme of fifty-eight years, none fail to attain the Way.  
Those who do not attain are due to receiving the Law but not practicing, practicing but not diligently, diligently but not earnestly; in between they commit sins; good and evil mixed; merit does not redeem error; virtue does not repair faults; after death they obtain good conditions as spirits, conditions increase among ghosts; they awaken in the nether realm, establish virtue, serve as ghost officials; accumulate merit and ascend as immortals; or become spiritual beings; or wheel through noble families of the Way and Virtue; all not involved in earthly toil — only that they cannot attain the Way in this very body.  
Those who rebel and slander, first are wrong and last are false; die following evil gangs, broken from the good causes.  
The breaking of good causes is all through faith and direction; though faith and direction cannot reach arrival, at least they prevent doubt, confusion, and retreat; thus good conditions increase daily, increase without end, and surely reach truth.  
Perfected Ones endure four hundred years, four thousand years, forty thousand years, even to ten thousand kalpas.  
Transmission and entrustment each have their formulae and orders; beginners take ninety-two cycles as their limit; good and evil according to the rule; be cautious and do not offend rashly.

All who learn the higher Way must firmly establish body and mind; if body and mind are unstable, learning will accomplish nothing.  
To accomplish learning and enter meditation, guarding the One is primary; subtle and difficult to cultivate; if unable to guard it, one becomes distracted by mixed and other affairs.  
If unable to guard it and enter meditation, then carefully divine the signs; examine self and things; self’s sameness and difference; things’ changes and wonders; notice and immediately change; cultivate techniques and employ methods; dissipate and remove these; when long without recurrence of difference, then enter meditation; all true conditions come together.

One: if the eyes are dim, light not constant, what is seen is not true, as if unrecognizing, then carefully enter the chamber, burn incense, retain thought of the spirit essence of the eyes — the Daoist youth spirit, three inches long, clad in five-coloured robes, one person in each eye, happily approaching and following from east and west, attended by thousands of chariots and myriad riders.  
After long and careful thought, cease at the utmost; cease then again think; day and night may be kept for twelve hours thus; gradually one may go six days without sleep; the Daoist youth appears in form; after one hundred and twenty days one clearly sees ten thousand li away; after three hundred and sixty days one knows fortune and misfortune in reverse; this is union with divine virtue.  
The sins are caused by liking to see evil colours, not looking at genuine truth; reform and carefully think, then there will be effect.

Two: if the ears thunder or ache painfully, do not hear distant sounds, cannot distinguish speech, then carefully enter the chamber, burn incense, retain thought of the spirit essence of the ears — the Daoist spirit of evenness, eight inches and one fen long, in plain robes, following thousands of chariots and myriad riders, returning to the two ear canals.  
Think to the utmost then cease; cease then think; gradually as above.  
Sins are caused by liking to hear licentious sounds, not discerning the sacred teachings; reform and carefully think, then there will be effect.

Three: if the nose has clear fluids, or is blocked and painful; what is smelled is not fragrant, foul or fragrant not pleasant, then carefully enter the chamber, burn incense, retain thought of the spirit essence of the nose — the subtle Daoist spirit, two inches and five fen long, in dark robes, following thousands of chariots and myriad riders, returning to the two nostrils.  
Think to the utmost then cease; cease then think; gradually as above.  
Sins are caused by liking fat and fresh meats, not liking fragrant aromas; reform and carefully think, then there will be effect.

Four: if the mouth loses taste, or the teeth, tongue, and lips ache, the throat is uncomfortable, food and drink are difficult and rough, then carefully enter the chamber, burn incense, retain thought of the spirit essence of the tongue — the Daoist spirit of branching, seven inches long, in vermilion robes, following thousands of chariots and myriad riders, returning to the mouth.  
Think to the utmost then cease; cease then think; gradually as above.  
Sins are caused by liking taste but speaking evil words, not being pure and truthful; reform and carefully think, then there will be effect.

Five: if the head is dizzy and painful or itchy, hair fails to grow, then carefully enter the chamber, burn incense, retain thought of the spirit essence of the brain — the Daoist spirit of the capital, one inch and one fen long, in blue robes, following thousands of chariots and myriad riders, returning to the head.  
Think to the utmost then cease; cease then think; gradually as above.  
Sins are caused by levity and offence to superiors, failure to reverence the Three Honours; reform and carefully think, then there will be effect.

Six: if the heart and abdomen are vexed, angry and displeased, twisting pain and hardness, food and drink do not digest, then carefully enter the chamber, burn incense, retain thought of the spirit essence of the heart — the bright Daoist spirit, nine inches long, in coloured robes, following thousands of chariots and myriad riders, returning to the abdomen.  
Think to the utmost then cease; cease then think; gradually as above.  
Sins are caused by liking movement, passions without constancy, failure to contemplate purity and stillness, neglect of jealousy and contention; reform and carefully think, then there will be effect.

Seven: if the loins, back, thighs, hips, knees, shins, calves, and feet ache and pain, motion and turning difficult, then carefully enter the chamber, burn incense, retain thought of the spirit essence of the flanks — the formed Daoist spirit, multicoloured spotted robes, following thousands of chariots and myriad riders, returning to the loins, back, thighs, hips, knees, shins, calves, feet, and both flanks.  
Think to the utmost then cease; cease then think; gradually as above.  
Sins are caused by strength and toil disturbing, not being earnest and solemn; reform and carefully think, then there will be effect.

Eight: if the whole body and limbs are afflicted inside and out, no longer self-aware, breath short and rapid, then carefully enter the chamber, burn incense, retain thought of the spirit essence of the skin — the connected Daoist spirit, one inch and five fen long, in cinnabar and white robes, following thousands of chariots and myriad riders, returning inside and outside the body, driving away evil and establishing right.  
Think to the utmost then cease; cease then think; gradually as above.  
Sins are caused by killing, stealing, licentiousness, ugliness, neglecting truth and righteousness; reform and carefully think, then there will be effect.

Nine: if suddenly ill and bedridden, or with accumulated and severe disease, cannot heal, then order entering quietness, burn incense and knock head; retain thought of the spirit essence of the kidneys — the life Daoist spirits of the two kidneys, two inches and three fen long, following thousands of chariots and myriad riders, returning to all parts of the body.  
Think to the utmost then cease; cease then think; gradually as above.  
Sins are caused by cruelty, rebellion, violence, not contemplating first repentance; reform and carefully think, then there will be effect.

These nine matters must be divined; the wise can divine them; opposing and guarding, naturally they dissipate; forever preserve chastity and good fortune.

Whenever in dreams or on journeys one sees cloudy darkness, wells murky and without water, ponds foul and unclean, excrement, blood, corpses, ghosts, persons mingling lewdly — all these indicate ailments of the eyes.  
Urgently retain the eye spirit; rub the palms until hot; apply to both eyes; after two sevens (fourteen times) stop.  
Also with the fingers pinch the corners of the eyes; if light is bright and clear, it is auspicious; if blue-black, it is inauspicious.  
Also attentively retain thought, rub and warm; first confess sins and faults; then there will be no harm.

Whenever in dreams or on journeys one hears strange sounds in the air, sorrowful, frightening, ugly and shrill, all these indicate ailments of the ears.

Whenever in dreams or on journeys one smells foul and strange odours, raw and restless, as if things enter the nose, unknown what they be; or dust or insects, or disappearing or perishing — these indicate ailments of the nose.  
Urgently retain the nose spirit; cross hands and pinch the nose; shrink and blow; two sevens (fourteen) times will suffice.  
Diligently keep incense fires; blend fragrant incense; smoke and vapour continue without cessation; first confess sins and faults; then there will be no harm.

Whenever in dreams or on journeys one sees rotten and spoiled food and drink, evil men cursing, mouth moving with sour teeth, speech wrong or mistaken — all these indicate ailments of the mouth.  
Urgently retain the mouth spirit; turn the tongue and rinse with liquid; mouth and throat full; after two sevens (fourteen) times stop.  
Practice reciting precepts; quietly chant secret spells; consult the scriptures; resolve stagnation and remove doubts; first confess sins and faults; then there will be no harm.

Whenever in dreams or on journeys one sees dazzling light, raining and snowing confusedly, falling from heights, goods overturned — all these indicate ailments of the head.

Diligently hold reverence and repentance; look upon the Three Honours; first confess sins and faults; then there will be no harm.

Whenever in dreams or on journeys one sees water and fire scattering and polluting, nets overlapping, boats and carts overturned, naked people running in alarm — all these indicate ailments of the heart and abdomen.  
Urgently retain the heart spirit; left hand covers the heart; right hand covers the navel; close eyes and hold breath; at the utmost softly exhale; calmly close again; repeat thus nine times; then stop.  
Purify and bathe carefully; diligently continue brightness; strictly remove thoughts of killing; in movement and rest face south; await the play of light and scenery; where one goes all is pure and chaste; first confess sins and faults; then there will be no harm.

Whenever in dreams or on journeys one sees fighting and striking, bearing heavy loads, stumbling and injuring, warriors stiff and fallen, walking with staffs and punishments, yin and yang intruding upon each other — these indicate ailments of the waist, back, joints.  
Urgently retain the flank spirit; cross hands cover the flanks; pinch twenty times; swallow breath and knock teeth each twenty-seven times; then stop.  
Ponder one’s conduct; if breaking precepts and violating rules, immediately reform; it is proper to show kindness; then arrange and manage affairs; admonish and stop disputes; guard mouth and restrain body; do not go in and out rashly; whether walking, sitting, lying, or rising, all must be cautious and careful; move calmly and look about prudently; keep body and mind correct; first confess sins and faults; then there will be no harm.

Whenever in dreams or on journeys one sees persons stripping each other, eating and devouring abnormally, men and women overturned and confused in yin and yang — these indicate ailments of the skin.  
Urgently retain the skin spirit; rub both hands together; reward and move through the whole body; at the utmost then stop; then again perform thrice cycles; then stop.  
Recite and practice precepts; diligently seek the mysterious words; remove stagnation and dispel confusion; reduce desires and lessen selfishness; first confess sins and faults; then there will be no harm.

Whenever in dreams or on journeys one sees persons panic and flee, great floods and great fires, birds and beasts in confusion, bandits, drunkenness, warriors in disorder, dogs and tigers chasing and biting, unknown persons rashly claiming old ties — all these indicate imminent illness or death.

Diligently follow the mysterious simplicity; do not neglect the yellow book; beget and beget sons; always follow the teacher’s words; first confess sins and faults; then there will be no harm.

Among these nine matters, with countless ties and threads, sitting upright hearing and seeing, as with dreams and journeys, carefully observe these principles; all afflictions will naturally dissipate; no need for medicine or prayers.

To remove afflictions and purify the body, one must understand and reform the mind; the mind must be correct and the body pure; then enter meditation.  
If entering meditation the Way may be accomplished; if unstable, the True will not descend; if the True cannot descend, how can the Way be attained?  
Attaining the Way depends on the True descending; the True descends through purity and correctness; if pure and correct and the Way is not attained, this has never been known.
