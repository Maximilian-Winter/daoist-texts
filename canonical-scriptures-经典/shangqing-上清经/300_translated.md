# The Jade Scripture of the Supreme Spirit Tiger of Perfect Emptiness

Title of the Scripture: The Jade Scripture of the Supreme Spirit Tiger of Perfect Emptiness. Also called the "True Talisman of the Spirit Tiger." The compiler is unknown; it is roughly dated to the Eastern Jin dynasty. It belongs to the early Shangqing tradition of talismanic texts. One scroll. Source text from the Zhengyi section of the "Zhengtong Daozang."

Wang Jun says: The True Talisman of the Spirit Tiger was issued by the Parents of the Nine Heavens of the Great Perfection; the Great Perfection Elder transmitted it to the Little Child of the Eastern Sea; the True King of the Nine Heavens transmitted it to the Supreme Dao Lord. The Supreme Dao Lord always treasured it as a secret, storing it within the Jade Chamber of the Qiong Palace of the Spiritual Capital of Taiwei, guarded by mighty beasts, protected by poisonous dragons, and with seven thousand spirit tigers completing the royal gates. Three hundred each of Golden Morning Jade Boys and Pure Spirit Jade Maidens attend in guarding the spiritual script. The mysterious radiance fills the void, dispersing smoke in the Purple Court; its awe strikes the nine distant regions; divine light shines resplendently in the Shangqing; the subtle and clear are opened in accord with Nature; penetrating wisdom reaches the formless. The spirit tigers display their forms, golden tigers stretch forth their essence; wisdom marks the trunk; demons are dispelled and the source unfolds. The subtle principles are profound and remote, their wondrous charm hard to detail, all inscribed with the hidden prohibitions of heavenly demons, or marked with the inner names of a hundred gods. Reciting its chapters shakes a thousand spirits; chanting its verses binds ten thousand demons. 

By the establishment of the Three Heavens as the beginning of rectitude, it was transmitted and entrusted to the Taiwei Heavenly Emperor, to exert power over the Six Heavens, to sever and subdue myriad spirits, to gather mountains and summon seas, to bind the host of spirits, to awe and destroy demons, and to revolve the Five Planets. Thus the Taiwei Heavenly Emperor received and accepted the two talismans of dispelling demons and wisdom, and wore them as he wandered in Shangqing, riding the void and floating the Taiwei wheel; he cleared the scene at the pavilion of the Great Perfection, and rested his foot on the steps of the Jade Emperor. Quiet he united with Heaven and Earth, moving he matched the seven lights in their radiance; he corrected the nine mysteries, grasped the pivotal spiritual machinery, led and encompassed myriad degrees, gathered and returned countless ferries; he stirred a hundred yang to produce lightning, moved a thousand yin to emit power. Morning clouds unveiled the Way at the Golden Gate; the Heavenly Pass responded and opened of itself; commanding the eight lights to ascend on high, he drove the spirit tiger to soar aloft. Hosts of immortals opened the way; the seven stars hastened their course; mysterious light grew dim and sluggish; myriad transformations and ten thousand reverences; penetrating observation of the boundless realm; encompassing the utmost edge of Heaven; eyes flowing and glancing upon the five turbidities; lamenting life to announce decline — truly it is subtle, the wondrous efficacy of the true talisman’s spiritual transformation.

The Taiwei Heavenly Emperor commanded the Upper Minister Qing Tong and the Western City King: "The Great Wisdom Text of Shangqing for Dispelling Demons, the True Scripture, is the jade chapter of the Supreme Ultimate, the precious secret of the Most High. The True Talisman of the Spirit Tiger is the treasured chapter of the Nine Heavens of the Great Perfection. Wisdom can expel filth, dispelling demons can restrain evil, the true talisman can control demons. There exists a jade tablet of purple name; whoever cultivates the superior method will be borne by multitudes of spirits and tested by myriad demons. If one wishes that myriad harms cannot injure, myriad trials cannot affect, all is by the might of the spirit tiger and the wondrous use of the true scripture. Now I entrust it to you, to transmit to later scholars who should be true perfected ones. They must follow the Great Perfection’s rules, hearing no more than three transmissions within seven hundred years, and must not show it to unworthy persons. To lightly reveal the true text invites the test of the wind blades upon the body, bringing disaster upon the nine mysteries. 

If there be one of the golden name Donghua, who records characters of Shangqing, and obtains this talisman from me, then he shall be attended by thirty jade boys and jade maidens as guards of his person. He may then pass through dangers and hazards, cross mountains and seas, summon gods and restrain ghosts, seal and hold the spiritual peaks; wherever he goes, a thousand demons will hide and ten thousand devils be bound; hosts of immortals attend and guard him, and his body shines with strange light. If cultivation has not yet reached seven years, the true spirit will naturally descend into the perfected one's chamber, and his flying carriage will plough the green fields, ascending the morning sun by day. The recipient must fast and face the altar for ninety days, or thirty days, or seven days, each time presenting ten taels of upper gold as tokens of spiritual truth; ninety feet of brocade as oath to the Nine Heavens; thirty feet of blue silk as pledge of his heart. He who loves the Way and delights in the True, diligently concentrating on the Mystery, will not marvel at wealth or property. To lightly prize material things and honour the Way, the Way will not fail to exist. Such a one alone may be spoken with. Those who inwardly cherish treasure and outwardly are vain and covetous — the Way will also reveal itself to close the jade box and hide it in the Golden Gate. After ascension and transcendence, it shall be stored in the famous mountains."
