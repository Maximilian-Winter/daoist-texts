### The Three Caverns’ Mixed Transformation: Inner Truth’s Generation, Official Titles, and Precious Names

The “Mysterious and Perfect Scripture of the Great Abundance of the Supreme True and Simple Spirit of the Cavern Origin” expounds the Way of the Three Truths and Nine Caverns through the Primordial Elixir and the Three Nine Simple Words. It coexists with the original qi; primordial beginning arises together. The three essences condense and transform, fashioning pure jade chapters, constructing and evolving the mansions of the three caverns, storing and governing the abyss of myriad truths. This secret resides above the Nine Heavens, in the palace of great abundance, within the golden stage and jade chamber of the simple spirit room, where jade tablets are carved to compose its text, inscribed in golden and jade characters to illuminate its chapters.

The mixed transformation of the three caverns engenders the superior origin; the middle regulates the ten ultimate void-born heavens; the lower manages myriad qi, without any place unconnected. The flowing light is original and full, flourishing within the Jade Pure. Flying rosy clouds and purple smoke shine brilliantly in the vast space. The daughters of jade splendour and youths of golden dawn, three thousand each, attend and guard the spiritual texts.

At that time the celestial origin encountered conjunction; joyous auspicious ceremonies in the divine court; the Primordial Emperor Jade Sovereign, the supreme exalted one; all truths and multitudes of immortals came to the seat, burning incense and venerating the scripture, circling within the upper palace. Mysterious morning, profound stagnation; flying incense veils the light, spreading fragrance that washes the spirit, scattering smoke over the Jade Capital. The three simple original clouds, flowing lightning on rosy peaks, the splendour of light intermingled; divine candles unite in brightness. Attendant maidens and multitudes of immortals number a billion. Poisonous dragons and great beasts fully guard the spiritual gates. Pythons strike with swords, long fangs knock on bells; celestial awe shines resplendent, transformed into the Great Void.

Eight winds drum upon mysterious banners; jade sounds arise from the spiritual palace. Phoenix cries beside the nine rosy clouds; the luan sings beside the purple firmament; dense mist above the profound profundity; the desolate beginning of radiance in the middle. At that time the Celestial Emperor Sovereign, the Southern Pole Supreme Origin Sovereign, the Supreme Emperor of the Great Microcosm, and the Later Sage of the Nine Profound Golden Gates, purified for three months, reverently received the Supreme Darkness; profound thought felt the Great Silence; accumulated meditations opened the Upper Clarity; thus bringing forth bright and steady illumination; the nine latitudes entwined their forms; hidden ganoderma gathered its blossoms; precious light was born at night; tasting the flavour of splendid origin; ascending to pour forth the morning essence; riding the void and forming smoke; eight ways shining brightly; masticating the Great Harmony; wisdom flowing freely in jade chapters; wandering in subtlety; flowing through the celestial court; vast cavernous sources; endless ages; embracing the great transformation; divine splendour without limit.

Immersed in spiritual contemplation; feasting in the seven mornings; purifying the splendid garden; resting within the nine profound mysteries; transforming the scene of the jade void; guiding and leading the multitudes of heavens; serene and clear in two sequences; primordial joy in myriad ferries; flowing glances through boundless kalpas; drawing interest forgetting whirling; bathing in spiritual hills; orchid tips on pure peaks; bright patterns complete; inner rhythms harmonious; five splendours shining with treasures; pure and resplendent jade heart; deep and secluded perfect abode; purple radiance in the cavernous collar; striking the mysterious river; plucking from the crimson benevolent forest; sweeping glance through the vast regions; eyes illumining the ten heavenly sounds; faint and wonderful divine traces; intangible to seek; spiritual transformations already hidden; riding the運玄清, flowing smoothly and purely harmonious; empty womb forming shapes; the marvel of great abundance displayed in simple spirit; the secret profundity of the nine heavens; the condensation of the original caverns; governing the three gates in the secluded mansions; storing myriad truths for rebirth; composing mysterious statutes to check violations; redeeming one's errors in the great darkness; extracting seven ancestors from the three paths; ferrying exhausted souls in the southern court; reciting the wise chants of the three emperors; purging the foul miasma of the Three Purities. Great indeed is the jade chapter, the utmost spirit of divine virtue.

The “Great Cavern True Scripture in Thirty-nine Chapters,” the waymark of the Supreme Emperor, the marvelous chapters of the Purple Morning, regulating fate on the steps of the Nine Heavens, summoning the spirits of the Five Emperors, drifting and returning in mixed winds; condensing nine revolutions in the mysterious essence; interchanging female and male; mixing and transforming myriad spirits; forested and dense; jade sounds of Supreme Truth; operating non-being in the bright beam; accessing the changes in the mysterious gate; the blade of cavernous virtue to create marvels; washing and shining nets reflecting clouds; the Great Desert is the qi of the spiritual gate; no blade is the year of great calamity; majestic is the divine mansion, the abyss of myriad truths; golden chambers radiant, flourishing in Upper Clarity; its purpose profound and subtle, hard to fully explore. If one can long fast and abstain from desires, reciting jade chapters in a secluded chamber, knocking jade sounds to shake the spirit, then the perfected person will surely register the talisman in the Eastern Flower; the seven mysteries will be further refined in the Purple Court; commanding demon kings with divine might; summoning the Five Emperors to protect the body. These are the wondrous spirits of the great cavern, condensing myriad ways and returning to life; not bearing strange hairs or strange forms; golden bones and jade names must not be wantonly disclosed in spiritual texts; its prohibitions all conform to the “Nine Truths Bright Statutes,” recipients be cautious.

The “High Supreme Jade Inspection Female One Five Elders Treasure Scripture,” twelve supreme vows, the mysterious mother’s eight intervals, nine revolutions and five returns, transforming female and male; the second marvel text, the highest chapter of the Supreme; mixing myriad changes; governing fate and enduring; firm soul condensing essence; leading and gathering myriad spirits; releasing and resolving knots; returning origin and five communications; all qi summing home; ascending to guard the Mud Pellet; cultivating and injecting extreme truth; splendidly reflecting the Purple Court; flying free and bright in the nine profound mysteries; opening smoothly and shining in Jade Pure; spiritual smoke dispersing fragrant in bright rosy clouds; divine lamps shining brightly in vast space; multitudes of truths congratulating in jade chambers; assemblies of immortals reciting praises and venerating scriptures; flying beasts dancing in vast space; luan and phoenix noisy and lamenting; three lights halting brightness; celestial radiance day and night; vast sweat in the secluded mansion; the highest truth of the Supreme. Its purpose is fresh and void; the path profound and deep; wonderful beyond description; principle difficult to exhaust. If one has the jade tablet, named after the Jade Emperor, composed in the Eastern Flower, filed in the Jade Palace, one shall obtain this text. According to the statutes, cultivate and consider the heavenly truth; long fast and bitterly meditate; dine at midday; recite and chant precious chapters; study the spiritual text thoroughly; not neglecting for nine years; thus one attains to true formation; refining soul and spirit in the nine mansions; governing the mixed transformations in the three gates; extracting seven ancestors from the secret paths; ferrying suffering souls in the southern palace; informing the shape altar for essential response; swearing in faith of heart to seek immortality. This is the marvelous transformation; the influence descending with the morning; riding the void and drifting to the heavens; feasting without interval.

The Supreme said: The Way of the omen is to retain thought on the “Great Cavern True Scripture in Thirty-nine Chapters,” returning wind mixed transformation female one five elders; the Golden Splendour Cavern room Emperor Sovereign’s twelve supreme vows; the mysterious mother’s eight gate intervals; the Great One’s transformation female one superior immortal method; on the day of action, always first cleanse with fasting, bathe in orchid fragrance, enter the chamber and think upon the simple spirit five emperors, the original cavern’s heavens, earth, and abyss officials, precious names and inner characters; summon truths and bring spirits; when done, then one may cultivate the great cavern female one precious formula. Its method is mysterious and subtle; born with qi, coexisting with heaven. Therefore the Purple Room of the Great One is the mixed origin father and mysterious mother; the three embryos are the secret words of divine light; the nine truths names are the inner scripture of the great cavern; the high supreme is the primordial great elixir; the female one is the inner essence; the marvelous scripture of great abundance; simple spirit is the cavern mystery; summing the three treasures as marvel texts; condensing the three qi as high chapters; its wonder is unfathomable, its height unattainable, its depth inexhaustible; lofty and subtle indeed, this jade chapter possesses great virtue. If the son can diligently contemplate it, then by day he will ascend to heaven; the way of immortality, the two extremes in spiritual texts.

### The Supreme Dao Sovereign’s Scripture of Guarding the Three Origins of True Unity

The Way of the Three Caverns is the title of the natural; it assists in unifying the three treasures. The “Great Cavern True Scripture,” “Female One Five Elders,” and “Great Abundance Simple Spirit” correspond to the Three Origins. The Original Cavern governs Heaven; the True Cavern governs Earth; the Profound Cavern governs Man. The three qi combined in clarity govern the three palaces of the original body, mutually assisting to completion. If the original desire is immortality, one must seek the primordial birth, take in and govern flowing rosy clouds, and regard the cavern as first.

Whoever cultivates the Three Treasures’ Upper Clarity True Scriptures must first think on the three caverns’ inner true precious names, keeping in mind their official titles to protect the body and form; then cultivate and achieve realization to become a perfected person. Its method is most wondrous, secret within the Great Abundance Simple Spirit Palace. The original body has bones and parts; one must diligently follow the true way, always bitterly meditate, fast and burn orchid incense, avoiding defiling qi. The spirit will reveal its form in eighteen years, descending a green carriage, riding clouds and controlling dragons, ascending by day to the mysterious.

Now I inform the original body, in secret for faithful practice.

Always at dawn think on the Cavern Heaven; at midday think on the Cavern Earth; at midnight think on the Cavern Abyss; or also at midday suddenly think on the Three Truths.

The method of storing thought: enter the room facing east, knock the teeth thirty-two times, first close eyes and think on the Simple Spirit Palace’s Qingwei mansion, where blue qi and red qi mingle in thick abundance, descending into the original body’s upper palace above the Mud Pellet; then swallow the nine qi. Next think on the Orchid Terrace mansion, where red and yellow two qi mingle as before, descending into the original body’s descending palace; then swallow the nine qi. Next think on the Imperial Hall mansion, where white and black two qi mingle as before, descending into the original body’s palace below the navel elixir field; then swallow the nine qi. Having swallowed the three caverns’ qi, then gaze upward and recite:

Heaven and earth mixed chaos, cavern abyss three essences, primordial beginning condensing and transforming, five qi mingling and generating, transforming mysterious origin, pouring into body and form, taking in and governing flowing rosy clouds, ascending into the Purple Court, Northern Emperor falling death, Eastern Flower registering name, penetrating subtlety, merging with Emperor.

Completed, then knock teeth nine times, think on the Original Cavern Origin Bright Extended Spirit Radiant Origin Sovereign Mysterious Mixture, with the talisman of Yang rosy red brightness, to endow my body. Next think on the Cavern Heaven's generating officials, their clothing and secret names as above, descending from the Simple Spirit Palace Qingwei mansion into the original body’s Mud Pellet palace. Completed, then recite upward blessing:

Cavern Heaven Upper Origin, supervising the Nine Profound, commanding the Three Qi, mixed and born in the elixir field, opening the cavernous dark gate, entering and exiting without hindrance, spirit and soul precious shining, entwined with splendid freshness, flying clouds in crimson chamber, feasting in purple heaven, jointly safeguarding heaven and earth, long enjoying myriad years.

Having completed Cavern Heaven, next face south and think on the Cavern Earth True Great Fire Mars Great Cavern Origin Life Great Spiritual Mechanism Emperor Sovereign Scene Transformation, with the talisman of the four luminous caverns and nine origins, to endow my body. Next think on the Cavern Earth’s generating officials, their clothing and secret names as above, descending from the Simple Spirit Palace Orchid Terrace mansion into the original body’s crimson palace. Then recite upward blessing:

Cavern Earth Mid-Origin, commanding flying immortals, splendid crown and precious radiance, belt of azure Jian turban, endow me with spirit talisman, communicating truth and bringing spirit, penetrating subtlety, receiving Emperor’s secret words, resolving knots and scattering bonds, nine apertures bright, seven ancestors all liberated, ascending to southern pavilion, cloud chariot descending, ascending by day to morning.

Having completed Cavern Earth, turn northward, think on the Cavern Abyss Profound True Great White Son Retaining Golden City Radiant Radiance Original Essence Original Guidance Great Immortal Sovereign, named Vast Field, with the Enlightening Communication Heaven Precious Talisman, to endow the original body. Next think on the Cavern Abyss generating officials, their clothing and secret names as above, descending from the Simple Spirit Palace Imperial Hall mansion into the original body’s lower elixir field below the navel. Then recite upward blessing:

Cavern Abyss dark gate, attending the Three Origins above, mysterious qi thick and vigorous, flying rosy purple clouds, flowing yellow five colors, splendid morning precious talisman, governing and taking in Enlightening, enduring with the origin, riding the void and driving the empty, feasting in jade morning, carrying and lifting the scenery emperor, forming friendships with true immortals.

Having completed Cavern Abyss, return eastward, knock teeth nine times, swallow saliva nine times; the three caverns are complete.

If you can perform this, true spirit will show form, jade maidens may be dispatched, jade youths bring spirits; the Three Origins descend, the elixir carriage green carriage comes to welcome the original body; ascending to Supreme Clarity. This is the treasure secret; be cautious not to lightly disclose.

### The Supreme Dao Sovereign’s Scripture of the Primordial Elixir

The Great Emperor Sovereign, Celestial Emperor Sovereign, and Supreme Microcosmic Celestial Emperor Sovereign receive from the Supreme Dao Sovereign, practicing and achieving the Way, supplementing the Emperor’s truth. The Great Emperor passed the scripture to the Queen Mother of the West; the Celestial Emperor to the Southern Pole Supreme Origin Sovereign; the Supreme Microcosmic Celestial Emperor to the Golden Gate Sacred Sovereign; the Golden Gate Sacred Sovereign passed to the Prime Minister Azure Youth Sovereign; the Azure Youth passed to the Disciple.

This is the upper chapter of the Simple Spirit. This Way is wondrous beyond other scriptures; its method is lofty and subtle, not heard by middling immortals. From the nameless books and crimson tablets, recorded in Upper Clarity, the way of the mysterious elixir is not mutually encountered. Daoists who cultivate the Supreme Three Truths texts attain rank as imperial lords and high ministers. If what is received is partial and the understanding of the Way limited, the rank is of kings of small spiritual palaces and ministers of the divine continent, the middle and lower officers of the Supreme Ultimate. They may ride dragons and clouds, control the void, guide and guard the spirit officials, scattering light to the eight confines. Subtle and profound, it is not lightly to be declared.

The titles of the scripture’s chapters come from the Supreme Hidden Books Eight Simple Chapters, with the style of looking down and mirroring; there are limits and measures.

The Three Ones are the spirit ancestors of the one body, the root of the hundred spirits’ life, the mountain source of the fluids, the jade chamber of soul and essence. Therefore the stomach pool is square to receive things; the brain palace is round and empty to accommodate truth; myriad hairs stand erect; a thousand apertures emit smoke; virtue completes heaven and earth, mixed with the Great Mysterious; thus it is called the Mud Pellet. The Mud Pellet is the upper spirit of the body’s form. The original body knows only swallowing qi and fluids, striking teeth and receiving liquid, but does not know that this is caused by the Mud Pellet’s flowing foam, the brain house’s fringe branches only. Now I will tell you the secret art of guarding the one, the wondrous method of the Supreme Truth. Close the mouth and cultivate faithfully; do not spread abroad; break the oath and you will perish under ghost officials, be examined by the seven ancestors, and remain closed in the river source.

Above the two eyebrows, upward by one inch is the Bright Hall Palace; upward by two inches is the Cavern Chamber; upward by three inches is the Elixir Field. The Elixir Field straight upward, opening one inch square, is the Mysterious Elixir Brain Essence Mud Pellet Soul Palace.

Within the Bright Hall Palace, on the left is the Bright Youth True Sovereign; on the right is the Bright Maiden True Official; in the center is the Bright Mirror Divine Sovereign. Bright Youth True Sovereign named Mysterious Yang, styled Young Blue; Bright Maiden True Official named Subtle Yin, styled Young Origin; Bright Mirror Divine Sovereign named Reflecting Essence, styled Four Bright. These three sovereigns govern the Bright Hall Palace together, wearing green brocade robes, belts with four jade bells, mouths holding jade mirrors; the mirror and bell both like red jade. Their heads like those of infants, their forms likewise; sitting facing outward, or facing one another. This is the Way of the Bright Hall. If the Daoist fears, hold the three spirits in mind; make the jade bells ring, the sound heard to the Supreme Ultimate; make the mouth emit the jade mirror’s red light, reaching ten thousand zhang. When all are held, then three times call the three sovereigns’ names, knock teeth nine times, then a thousand demons subdue; ten thousand ghosts vanish their forms. If the Daoist is hungry or thirsty, also hold the three sovereigns and emit red qi from mouth, pouring into one’s own mouth, then inhale and swallow; after a moment one is full. If the Daoist travels at night and darkness prevents seeing the road, hold the three sovereigns and emit three fire lights from mouth to illuminate ahead; after a moment the road naturally brightens. If one travels through danger and calamity, places of swords and weapons, quickly hold the three sovereigns and ring jade bells, refine and imagine them; enemies’ hearts naturally tremble and fear, no longer harbor harm. If the Daoist desires longevity and immortality, or when illness comes to distress, seeking rescue and life, one should compose the heart and rest peacefully; hold the three sovereigns of the Bright Hall and kneel long facing outward, emit red qi from mouth, making light penetrate the body, encircle the corners of the mouth, swallow red qi plentifully and uncountably, usually closing eyes and slightly swallowing. After a moment the red qi surrounds the body, all turning to fire; the fire burns the body, body and fire become one; inside and outside facing the light; after a long while it ceases; this is called the refining the form by sun and moon, dying and being reborn. Also at night when lying down one should always do this, then longevity and immortality are assured. Also often hold and swallow red qi, making one’s complexion return youthful, the hue like that of a maiden. This is the way of immortality, the essential secret of the Bright Hall. Completed.

In the Cavern Chamber there are three truths: on the left the Nameless Young Lord, on the right the White Origin Sovereign, in the center the Yellow Elder Sovereign. These three govern the Cavern Chamber together. This is the way of flying truths; a separate scripture exists, found in the “Jinhua Scripture.”

In the Elixir Field is the Upper Origin True One Emperor Sovereign; and the Emperor Sovereign’s ministers, three combined governing the Elixir Field Palace. This is the Way of the Three Origins True One. This place is the essential passage of truth, the scripture of controlling the dragon carriage. The heavenly truths have many official ranks; they enjoy being earthly perfected; earthly perfected conceal themselves in official ranks, not wearing themselves out in court morning and evening; therefore moving freely and suitably, wandering as time allows; sitting on seven carriages and above, stepping four qi in the Great Void. Even among heavenly truths and earthly truths, though ranks differ slightly, all are one truth. Earthly perfected each rest in their place, unwilling to be officials again amid the clouds.

The Mysterious Elixir Palace contains the Great Mud Pellet Supreme One Sovereign. Behind the Elixir Field upward one inch is the Flowing Pearl Palace. The Flowing Pearl True Spirit has a separate scripture, governing the fate’s course. Its Way is wondrous and great; only by oath and using pearl silk as pledge may it be given. This scripture is transmitted once every three hundred years, fully five times only; then no reissue. This is the way of the Supreme Ultimate ministers of fate.

The Mysterious Elixir Palace lies above the Elixir Field, one inch straight; the Purple Room and Green Chamber, vermilion smoke fills within; therein is the Mud Pellet Supreme One Sovereign, governing the Mysterious Elixir Palace. The Supreme One Sovereign’s appearance is like a newborn infant, sitting in a golden bed with jade curtain; wearing purple embroidered brocade robes, belt with flowing fire bells. The flowing fire bells are without substance and red light; when moved their sound is heard ten thousand li; they are the treasure bells of the Yellow Great One of Upper Clarity. The left hand holds the handle of the Big Dipper’s seven stars; the right hand holds the cord of the North Star. The North Star is the immovable star of the North Pole, called the cord star. Sitting upright in the Mysterious Elixir Palace facing outward; no attendants on either side. The lack of attendants is why he is called the Supreme One Sovereign.

At dawn and dusk he guards the Three Ones; only after all is done does he keep the last remaining. The last remaining is to first create the lightness, then carry the heaviness. The head has nine palaces; let me first explain.

Above the two eyebrows is wrapped the Yellow Gate, Purple Door, Crimson Terrace, and Azure Room, all constructed and guarding the inch between left and right ears. To guard the inch, on the left face is the Crimson Terrace; on the right face the Yellow Gate; the Nine Palace perfected persons enter and exit all through the path between the Yellow Gate and Crimson Terrace. Therefore the placement of the terrace and gate on left and right is to observe unusual qi, to observe the going and coming of perfected persons. The Purple Door Great Spirit is named Peaceful Quietness, styled Method King. The Azure Room Great Spirit is named Rectify Heart, styled First Square. Both take forms like infants, each wears clothing colored like their rooms and doors, holding flowing golden fire bells. To guard the inch is to go back three fen, called guarding the inch. At dusk and during storing thought, first hold the two great spirits, imagining seeing them; then three times call their names; then softly bless:

Purple Door and Azure Room, two great spirits, holding flowing bells, body born of wind and cloud, defending the true Way; not heeding outside; cause me to feel and be inspired; pass through spiritual gates; entering and exiting with good fortune; ascending the nine gates; then seeing the Nine Truths; the most exalted of the Supreme. Spell completed; then one may store thought on the Three Ones, Cavern Chamber, Nine Ways, and other essentials.

The two great spirits guarding the inch listen only to the Nine Palaces’ true officials; those within the Nine Palaces enter and exit ears and eyes; the Supreme Emperor trusts fate. When the jade youth spiritual truth comes and goes to the Emperor’s pavilion, the two great spirits listen and report. The rest not true, these two great spirits do not admit before them; this is the law of the Yellow Supreme One.

Then the infant emperor commands two ear spirit maiden attendants, cloud attendants, to lead them in; thus when people feel ringing in the ears, it is an external envoy entering. The cloud attendants strike the chime bell, to hear the Nine Palaces, to know external persons come in, to alert for protection. The chime bell is the sound causing ear ringing. Hearing it, one covers ears with crossed hands and recites:

The infant is in the palace; the Nine Truths are in the chamber; please hear the divine commands; ever watch for misfortune; the Supreme One flowing fire; to extinguish myriad calamities.

Spell completed; then strike the ear gates twenty-seven times; then one should feel the face warm; this is a good sign. If coldness is felt in the neck and nape, evil qi has entered; one should quickly lie down, close eyes, hold in mind the Mysterious Elixir Palace Supreme One Sovereign, and with the flowing fire bell illuminate and cast it out; thus evil qi will immediately leave the body and the fire light follows behind, shining brightly to illuminate the entire person; after a while calm returns.

If suddenly sounds of rushing water, thunder, lightning, and drum beating are heard in the ears, this indicates bodily weariness, extreme damage to the heart’s storehouse; the true injection of essence cannot be tasted; indulgence causes disorder; the six palaces lose their hold; souls and spirits lament; this is the sign of impending disease and death. Thus the Mud Pellet operates freely; the Nine Palaces go out of order; sorrow and turmoil turn in confusion; drums beat in disorder; one will wish to abandon the dwelling place and cast away the body. Those who hear this should diligently think on the Supreme One Sovereign; return from confusion and concentrate the true heart; if the sin is not deep, one will hear and reform. Therefore deafness is caused by the death of the ear spirit.

The ear is the Emperor Sovereign’s gate of hearing; the eye is the Supreme One’s sun and moon; the nose is the hill and mountain of the Three Origins; the mouth is the vermilion abyss of the Crimson Palace; the eyebrow is the white origin’s splendid canopy; the hair is the bright hall’s forest essence; the tongue is the original hero’s dragon carriage; the teeth are the stomach palace’s mighty blade; the hand is the gall spirit’s outer aid; the foot is the kidney origin’s spiritual gate; the yin pole is the true mechanism of the Cavern Chamber. The one body’s hundred spirits each have their proper belonging; one must not neglect or be negligent.

If gold and jade sounds are suddenly heard in the ears, true qi has come in; the Way seeks to complete. If strings and music are suddenly heard, the six dings and jade maidens have come to guard one; all means the Way seeks to complete. One should be quiet and cultivate the Way; the more diligent the heart, the more it advances. Hence perfected persons gradually appear in form. Unless you are my master, do not speak of this to others.

If suddenly flute and horn sounds are heard, these are auspicious signs of noble arrival. If shouting and howling are heard, these are ominous signs of degradation. If foul qi is smelled through the nose, there must be unclean matters and impure signs; thus foul qi indicates it. Quickly bathe, burn incense, and cleanse the sleeping chamber in response; this is the Emperor Sovereign’s warning and exhortation to people. If fragrant qi is smelled, it is the spirit officials and spiritual persons beside you observing your state. At that time one should do good deeds, practice virtue and kindness, help the needy, accumulate yin merit, practice charity; the spirit officials and spiritual persons will report to the Supreme; the Way person’s goodness or evil. The Way’s subtleties must be observed; all such signs.

If fragrant qi is smelled, do not tell others unless you are their master. If foul qi is smelled, one should inform people to clarify one’s own crime and the formless defilement touched. If bloody qi is heard, or sudden clotting of blood is seen, this is the omen of fierce weapons and calamity. Quickly hide away from the human world; guard the Three Origins Emperor Sovereign seeking rescue; keep fasting for three months; calamity will also cease. These are all the Emperor Sovereign’s prior warnings to people of good and evil, to cause fear and caution in their misfortunes and blessings. When seeing ominous signs, one should practice yin virtue, manage kindness and rescue people, do what others cannot do, do what the traveller cannot do; thus one escapes the omen of certain death. You should be diligent and not merely observe the ordinary.

Above the two eyebrows, upward three fen is the guarded inch twin field; upward one inch is the Bright Hall Palace; upward two inches is the Cavern Chamber Palace; upward three inches is the Elixir Field Palace; upward four inches is the Flowing Pearl Palace; upward five inches is the Jade Emperor Palace. Above the Bright Hall by one inch is the Heavenly Court Palace; above the Cavern Chamber by one inch is the Ultimate Truth Palace; above the Elixir Field by one inch is the Mysterious Elixir Palace; above the Flowing Pearl Palace by one inch is the Supreme Emperor Palace. In all the head there are nine palaces.

The scriptures of the Bright Hall, Cavern Chamber, Elixir Field, and Flowing Pearl four palaces are all the Way of perfected immortals to perfected persons; the Way is transmitted in the world. The Mysterious Elixir Palace scripture is also the essential words of the true officials governing fate; it leads the four palaces. This scripture must be granted by the Supreme Ultimate Emperor Sovereign; only then is it given, and only sometimes then. Whoever unites the Way of the Five Palaces and practices it in the world with true name will encounter it. If not of bone and fate in harmony, this speech is not heard.

Also there is a Jade Emperor Palace, where resides the Jade Pure Divine Mother. There is also the Heavenly Court Palace, where dwells the Upper Clarity True Maiden. Also the Ultimate Truth Palace, where dwells the Supreme Ultimate Emperor Consort. Also the Supreme Emperor Palace, where dwells the Supreme Sovereign Consort. These four palaces are all Female Truth One; the Way is higher than Male Truth One. There are also precious scriptures, passed to those who have become perfected persons; those not yet perfected have not heard them. The essentials of Female Truth One also are not granted. The Supreme thus sends out the eight ultimate scenes, entering the jade chariot; three thousand jade maidens attend the truth, supporting the chariot; spiritual consorts sing chivalrously; divine queens hold the scarves. These truly guard the Way of Female One, used to heighten the meeting with the Mysterious Morning. This is the root and foundation of the Supreme, the transmission of the Void Emperor. Everyone in these four palaces has them, but those who do not cultivate this Way have empty palaces. Those who do not fully cultivate the nine palaces also have empty palaces; this is not only the female family’s four palaces. In the Elixir Field Palace there is always the Emperor Sovereign; in the guarded inch there are always great spirits; never absent; must cultivate to see present in the palace. Those who cultivate become immortals; those who do not cultivate die in longevity. The Male and Female One spirits may be cultivated by both men and women; none are without them. Only by resolving essence and bitter effort to the utmost does one gain benefit.

The Way of guarding the Mysterious Elixir Supreme One Sovereign is to be silent and still at dusk and dawn, removing all thoughts; sitting or lying at will; first hold the Purple Qi of the Northern Pole star descending into one’s Mysterious Elixir Palace; after a moment the palace fills and overflows outside the body, encircling the body, communicating inside and outside the cavern, merging with the Purple Qi. Completed, then hold the sun entering the Mysterious Elixir Palace; the sun fills the palace, in the center of the purple qi; looking as if viewing a fire pearl in the dark. Completed, then hold the Supreme Ultimate Middle Yellow Supreme One Sovereign, coming from the Northern Pole Purple Qi, descending into the Mysterious Elixir Palace sun center seat. The sovereign named Regulation Hero, styled Transforming Mysterious, wears the same appearance and clothing as above. Also hold oneself; suddenly rising upward, entering the Mysterious Elixir Palace sun center, sitting opposite the Supreme One Sovereign, clothing at will; then with heart arise and bow twice, kneeling and asking the Way, seeking the divine immortals’ longevity, speaking at will. Then hold and swallow purple qi thirty times; completed; swallow saliva thirty times; completed; then hold the Big Dipper seven stars interior; one red qi as large as a string descends straight into the Mysterious Elixir Palace; then the Supreme One Sovereign and oneself ride the sun entering and moving along the red qi road, directly ascending to the Big Dipper leader; resting after a long time. Since that sleep, true responses come. If practiced for fourteen years, one will travel with the Supreme One together, reaching the seven origin cords. After eighteen years, visit the Upper Clarity Palace; after receiving scriptures and wearing talismans, employ jade youths and maidens each eighteen persons. One night one holds this only several times; do not let it slip away at night. Also one can solely cultivate this Way; not necessarily guard the Three Ones. Supplementing essence, the realization is quick.

On the first, third, seventh, eleventh, and fifteenth day of the month, at midnight, hold the Mysterious Elixir Palace Supreme One Sovereign seated properly facing outward; mouth emits blue qi descending into my mouth; I swallow it fifty times; completed; then swallow saliva fifty times; completed; softly chant:

Supreme One True Yellow, Middle Yellow Purple Sovereign, named Regulation Hero, styled Transforming Mysterious, golden bed jade curtain, purple embroidered brocade skirt, belt with fire bells, cutting evil and destroying treachery, holding star essence in hand, neck born for true, sitting upright emitting qi, causing me to swallow and take in, speaking with me, feasting in the Mysterious Elixir, refining and cleansing the seven souls, harmonizing and softening the three spirits; divine spirits attend and guard; enabling me to fly immortal; five organs self-generate; returning to a white youthful complexion; receiving scriptures of Upper Clarity; governing fate imperial officials; all wishes and desires; a hundred blessings renewed.

Also hold oneself entering the palace; resting before the Supreme One; thus obtaining sleep and likewise dreaming of wondrous responses. Day after day accumulating thus, there will be gradual steps to meeting.

To cultivate the Way of the Mysterious Elixir, guarding the Three Ones secret, one must always guard the Four Palaces Female Truth One spirits, their clothing, form, shadow, names, and dwelling places, as above. This precious scripture is the upper chapter, passed only to those perfected persons; beginners may not study or hear it. Its essentials are secret to the simple spirit; not to be practiced in the world. Those who receive the Upper Truth Way and the Three Treasures Divine Scriptures, though penetrating spirits and exploring mysteries, if they do not know the Way of Female Truth One, then they can never succeed. Therefore the Supreme stresses its great prohibition, strictly forbidding careless disclosure, not recording in paper or ink. Those who have it should carefully examine their inner heart before receiving it.

Always on the first day of the new year, new moon, and birth day of the Grand Duke, bathe and fast, burn incense, enter the chamber facing east, hold in mind and think the Four Palaces Female Truth One spirits, their dwelling places, names, clothing colors, lengths, as above. Having completed this, knock teeth thirty-six times and chant:

Completed, swallow qi thirty-six times and stop. If done for nine years, the face will grow jade blossoms, golden truth shining; the spirit will appear in form; and speak with the original body. Once you see the spirit, know in your heart; do not rashly disclose.

These Four Palaces Female Truth One spirits are the yin officials born at the beginning of heaven and earth, bearing the title of Emperor Consort. Their original qi not yet established; the five directions not heard; light and shadow not penetrated; Infinite Void nothingness; no above and no below; no outside and no inside; no left and no right; no front and no rear; Supreme Origin Essence; wondrous beginning of mystery truth; extreme void prior to forming qi and condensation; mixing and transforming myriad things; heaven and earth’s preservation all due to the Four Truths. Whoever with utmost sincerity holds and thinks on this will not know aging for a thousand years; within the nine heavens myriad spirits live together and share longevity.

### The Supreme Great Cavern’s Scripture of Guarding the One Inner Method

The Supreme said: The reason the perfected person values the One as True One is because it is only the Highest One. That which connects the One is the Great Void’s transformation; the One’s variation and communication is the mingling of heaven and earth. Therefore the Highest One is the Heaven Emperor of the one body; the Middle One is the Crimson Palace’s Elixir Emperor; the Lowest One is the Yellow Court’s Origin King; the Three Ones’ truth together govern and command the twenty-four qi in the body; qi gives birth; birth establishes the one body; responding above to the Supreme Microcosm’s twenty-four truths; true qi circulating harmoniously; ranks of things form shape; mysterious spirits divide and mix; the Purple Room is dim and dark. Qi is the spirit formed by condensing spiritual smoke; spirit is the self-sovereign of the Three Ones. Transformation is wrought by the Three Ones; those who may transform all rely on spirit to conceal themselves; mixing of yellow and mutual completion obtains the extreme of mystery.

The Three Ones Original Sovereigns each have true qi; true qi condensing forms itself into a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders; cloud carriages and feathered canopies; often entering inward the purple palace; ascending Jade Pure; recording talisman in the original diagram; attacking the embryo and protecting the fetus. The Three Ones nurture the body and become perfected persons, flying through the nine heavens, serving the Highest. Therefore what the One aids is born of heaven and earth; not only flying and crawling, but also small matters. If you can guard it firmly, then essence responds and flows freely; essence responding and flowing freely, then the Three Origins appear; the Three Origins appearing, white qi thickens and changes; white qi thickening and changing, mixed parts spontaneously arise; mixed parts spontaneously arising are the thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, suddenly arriving. Then feathered canopies may be ridden; cloud carriages may be mounted; then by day one ascends to heaven; ascending to Supreme Microcosm; truly the mysterious work of the Three Ones, the meeting place of essence and response.

In the Supreme Microcosm Heaven are twenty-four qi, mixed yellow and mingled; condensing qi transforming; sometimes suddenly dividing and spontaneously arising. Within the transformed qi are twenty-four perfected persons; condensing emptiness and forming life; not from embryo or fetus; all caused by the Three Ones Emperor Sovereigns’ qi; dividing the way and transforming; entrusting mystery and establishing phenomena. If one can guard the Three Ones within the body, then the Supreme Microcosm Three Origins Emperor Sovereigns will descend and appear externally, also speaking face to face with you. Within the body are also twenty-four perfected persons; also formed from the body’s mysterious qi essence spirits; dividing and transforming into myriad beings. If the cloud carriage is fully formed, uniting qi and morning light, to ascend Supreme Microcosm. The Supreme Microcosm’s twenty-four perfected persons all mingle with the body’s spirits; feasting together in the mixed yellow; sharing light within the purple room; entrusting shape and qi in myriad paths; returning old mugwort to become infant; changing death record at the northern Feng; receiving long life in the imperial village; entering and exiting Jade Pure; resting in Supreme Microcosm.

Also one should concurrently practice the affairs of Emperor One, Supreme One Five Spirits, and the affairs of three five seven nine; practicing concurrently, one god’s influence is easily induced. The Purple Room must guard the One as root; guarding the One must have the Purple Room as splendid canopy; therefore the three ones and three simples mutually depend; and the Purple Room and six harmonies wait on each other. Though their dwellings differ, the function of bringing forth the One is all fulfilled. If you think well and keep it, then the affairs of the Three Ones are complete. If you only receive one way, then the Three Origins are incomplete; but focusing heart on the One may also bring long life and immortality; entering Supreme Clarity only, and not roaming Supreme Microcosm Heaven; nor ascending the Upper Clarity Palace.

The Highest One Truth Emperor is the supreme; the Middle One True Emperor is the utmost; the Lowest One King is the marvelous. When the Heavenly Emperor attains the extreme, he becomes the Supreme Emperor Extreme. When the Earthly Emperor attains the utmost, he becomes the True One Proper. When the Human Emperor attains the marvelous, he becomes the lord of myriad marvels. The Three Emperors embody the truth to guard the One; therefore the One hides no form. Immortals seek truth to seek the One; so the Three Ones are all clear. The One hides no form; this is its ultimate. The Three Ones all clear; obtain the One only. When truth is ultimate and the Three Ones all clear, obtaining the One then arises. Whoever guards the truth of the One must cause the heart to be quiet and the spirit congealed; the body focused to seek response; therefore a hundred thoughts do not wander; essence and intention do not scatter. Within three months of looking inward, focusing heart on one spirit, spirit light transforms and arises, entwining the five organs. Therefore focus without scattering, concentrating qi to cause harmony; this is the effect of firmness; the efficacy of obtaining the One.

If false blooms arise, competing minds become chaotic; therefore the One does not fully respond; the spirit does not immediately answer; it is not that it does not desire to come; those who hold it are not focused; those who think on it are not careful; therefore accumulating years of practice, with no semblance of success. If one can make heart flow to distant response, concentrate heart with no other, it is not necessary to have three months’ diligent thought; mixed with the One is also sufficient.

The Supreme said: The Three Origins are the Jade Truths of the Nine Heavens, the true Way of the Upper Truth. The root of the fetal root; the place of preservation in the Six Directions; therefore the True One Great Way brings forth the True Emperor; the true Way of Mystery and Truth brings forth the Great Spirit; separation and union of the Five Elders; myriad transformations suddenly complete; the Three Origins’ dissolving and changing; thus the One is born. Therefore transforming qi distributes and condenses; spirit obtains spirit; myriad truths return to one; and wondrous work is completed. This is the ancestor of the true Way, the root beginning of original qi. If dispersed into nothing, then white qi hides and unites; if nourished in form, then long life is permanent. The Way of the Three Ones views the Way perfected in the Three Origins; its Way is wondrous; summing the spiritual chapters; heaven, man, immortal, emperor; grasping precious divine scriptures.

The first marvel is the “Great Cavern True Scripture in Thirty-nine Chapters”; the second marvel text is the Female One Combined Transformation, called the “Great Abundance Mysterious Scripture”; the third jade secret is the Cavern True Mysterious Scripture, three five seven nine, called the “Supreme Simple Spirit.” Therefore the Upper One Emperor Sovereign treasures the “Great Cavern True Scripture,” the Middle One Elixir Emperor treasures the “Female One Mysterious Scripture,” the Lower One King keeps secret the “Simple Spirit Cavern Mysterious Great Abundance Scripture.” These three five titles are the utmost essence of the true Way; the extreme chapters of the Three Ones; and the secret formulas of Jade Pure; the secret chapters of the High Supreme. If the original body guards the Three Ones, obtains our three scriptures, then one may ride clouds and ascend Supreme Clarity; penetrate without end; feast in the Purple Court; subtle indeed, deep indeed, hard to explain in writing. The One that is guarded arises; the Three Ones are seen. Since you have obtained the One, you naturally obtain this scripture. The Way of guarding the Three Ones is the foremost chapter of the true book of the Golden Gate Emperor Sovereign of Upper Clarity; the Jade Way of the High Supreme; the path of immortals and spirits; the marvelous secret of myriad truths. If you can guard the One, the One also guards you; if you can see the One, the One also sees you. The One must stand in the body; the body must go and act with the One. Your body’s advance and retreat, myriad matters, always think on the One; eating and drinking think on the One; joy and sorrow think on the One; illness think on the One; danger think on the One; walking on water and fire think on the One; in urgent matters think on the One; raising and gazing, thoughts are many; thought must be concentrated; if not concentrated, there is no hope.

The afflicted person has will but not firmness; firm cannot endure long; know the name of the One but cannot guard it; guard but cannot hold firm; will cannot endure hardship; thought has no limit; often there is original heart. Some know the Way of the One but cannot always guard; thus when the Three Ones depart, then the correct qi leaves. When correct qi is lost, then old qi comes first; when old qi comes first, death day approaches. Common people learning the Way mostly seek superficial brilliancy; they do not value the true One as precious; at first they have will but later decay; all due to not focusing the will; evil qi enters. The caution for guarding the One is to beware of lack of concentration; concentration again does not endure long; endurance without seeing essence; essence cannot be firm; firmness without constancy; then the Three Ones depart; the body becomes an empty house. An empty house without master, how long can the calamity endure?

The Supreme said: Qi condenses into essence; essence responding is spirit; spirit transforming is infant; infant ascending is perfected person; perfected person ascending is infant sovereign; this is true One.

The Supreme said: Heaven has three lights, namely sun, moon, and stars; also the three essences; these are used for longevity. Man has three treasures, three elixir fields; also the three truths; these are used for eternal preservation. The Spirit Treasure Scripture says: Heaven essence, Earth truth; the three treasures always exist; this is the meaning.

The Supreme said: Above the two eyebrows is the upper elixir field; the heart Crimson Palace is the middle elixir field; the three cun below the navel is the lower elixir field; these three elixir fields combined. The infant dwells in the upper elixir field palace; the perfected person dwells in the middle elixir field palace; the infant sovereign dwells in the lower elixir field palace. Above the two eyebrows, upward one inch is the Bright Hall; upward two inches is the Cavern Chamber; upward three inches is the Elixir Field Mud Pellet Palace. Upward means from the face backward to the crown and rear.

The Elixir Field Mud Pellet Palace is square, one inch on each side. Purple qi rushes to heaven; within the purple qi is a sun image, nine cun in diameter, shining around ninety thousand li. My form changes in size and shape; suddenly forgetting the body; also faintly imagined and remembered. The Upper Origin infant dwells in the Mud Pellet Palace under the splendid canopy. The Mud Pellet Heavenly Emperor has an Upper Infant named Mysterious Condensing Heaven, styled Three Origins Former; also called Elder Wu Upper; also called Elder Shi Hua; position is Mud Pellet Heavenly Emperor Sovereign, governing the upper palace. To his right is an imperial minister, sitting opposite; this is the spirit of my teeth, tongue, and brain, rising and transforming suddenly. The Upper One is the imperial minister sovereign, named Beginning Le Essence, styled Middle Mysterious Life; also called Beginning Non-being, also called Constant Assistance. These two govern the Mud Pellet Palace together; both naked without clothes; appearances like newborn infants. The Upper Heavenly Emperor holds the Upper Clarity Spirit Tiger Talisman, kept in a green jade box. The imperial minister holds the “Great Cavern True Scripture,” kept in a purple jade box. Sitting both face outward or facing each other. The Upper Emperor Sovereign recites:

Mysterious Mud Pellet, begetting body and guarding gates; Supreme One guards the record; Upper Origin firmly guards spirit; heaven’s constant true qi; nourishing form to become immortal.

Completed.

The palace where the Upper One dwells guards and governs the Mud Pellet, face, eyes, mouth, tongue, teeth, two ears, nose palaces, the hair border; outside it commands awe to dispel the six heavens’ myriad ghosts and evil demons. Within the original body are three souls and seven spirits; every five days one comes to court the Upper Origin Emperor One, and receives the transformed mixed born mixed qi Way.

The heart is the middle elixir field, called the Crimson Palace
