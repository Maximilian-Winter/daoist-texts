### The True Talisman of the Golden Tiger of the Supreme Microcosm of Dongzhen

The True Talisman of the Golden Tiger of the Supreme Microcosm Heavenly Sovereign is enshrined in the Jade Palace of the Primordial Radiance of the Supreme One. It measures ten thousand zhang in poisonous delight, and strikes down demons to guard the Scripture. The divine tiger numbers seven thousand, stationed at the Jade Pass. Three hundred Western Floral Jade Maidens scatter fragrance through the celestial court. The Five Elders’ classic texts, and the Golden Morning attendant of the True, are all present. Without the precious register of jade names and the engraved tablets of the Three Purities, none may obtain the inner talisman of the Golden Tiger, nor hear the jade texts of the Supreme One. This talisman is inscribed upon the jade tablets of the Shangqing Wisdom Scripture, containing seventy thousand characters, its spiritual sounds wondrous upon the Way, its subtle purport difficult to explain. Sometimes it conceals the hidden names of heavenly demons, sometimes it reveals the inner names of myriad spirits, sometimes it expounds obscure parables and mysterious formulae in the jade sounds. There is a small copy transcribed by Lord Wang, containing the talisman and the method of the formidable divine texts, to command the spirits of heaven and earth, with but one hundred characters. This incantation is wondrous and secret, named the Three Heavens Tiger Script of the Supreme Primordial Register. Those who receive it first fast for seventy days, and prepare a Golden Tiger jade bell, white silk and dark gauze each thirty chi long, to serve as the oath of the Golden True, pledging an unspoken covenant before heaven and earth. According to the rites of the Four Extremities, only three persons may receive transmission within seven hundred years.

The True Talisman of the Golden Tiger Jade Essence of the Supreme Microcosm Heavenly Sovereign is the inner sound of the Golden Seal of the Supreme Primordial Radiance of Naturalness. It commands the Golden Immortals, seals mountains and summons spirits, terrifying the Six Heavens, decapitating myriad spirits. The Supreme One constantly dispatches the Western Spirit Tai Jia with seven hundred thousand men to guard the talisman in the Jade Palace of the Supreme Microcosm. Those who wear this talisman wield authority over heaven and earth, command the spirits and immortals, control the Jing Dragon, and hold high office among the exalted immortals. Once the jade sound is sounded, the Jade Splendour attendants stand by, the Golden True guardsmen appear, a thousand demons lose their eyes, ten thousand ghosts vanish in form, nine devils burst their heads, the Six Heavens are overthrown and overturned. The Way is wondrous and ultimately true, the spirits increase the five intelligences; on the left the mysterious boy howls, on the right the Golden Morning seizes. Great indeed is this precious writing, the majestic power of the great emperor! It is not merely for repelling poison, warding off trials, and exterminating demons; it is the subtle product of the quest for immortality, the first rank of the attainment of the true. Attending the writing are jade boys and jade girls, forty-seven each, who guard the body of the recipient of the Scripture, serving the talisman and following the ritual, ascending to the Three Purities. Should one transgress or disdain the celestial writings, or transmit them to those unworthy, the body shall enter wind and fire, and the seven ancestors and grandparents shall be long punished by the Water Official.

The True Talisman of the Golden Tiger of the Supreme Microcosm Heavenly Sovereign

To the right is the True Talisman of the Golden Tiger. The Supreme Microcosm Heavenly Sovereign transmits it to the Golden Palace Emperor Sovereign. Written in vermilion on white silk, set in a purple brocade pouch, worn on the head when going forth, it commands awe over heaven and earth and the myriad spirits; the gods and immortals reverently submit; the Jade Splendour holds the silk kerchief; the celestial soldiers guard the body; mountains and rivers bow their essence. With the added invocation of the powerful divine blessing, the Jade Purity Seal, one obtains the decapitation of nine devils and the annihilation of a thousand demons. This is a talisman forbidden in Shangqing, not passed to the world; whoever obtains it and wears it shall ascend to Shangqing.

The Supreme Primordial Radiance Golden True Powerful Divine Inner Blessing calls forth divine troops, slaying and destroying evil ghosts. When entering a chamber, burn incense, click the teeth thirty-six times, and sit or lie at ease, then recite the blessing:

Repel the Poison King of Heaven, shake the banner of the Sevenfold Net, the Eight Immortals wield battle-axes, the Five Spirits of the Supreme Emperor, the Great Mysterious descends the radiance, the Seven Gods guard the court, the Yellow True shining talisman, blazing and casting the fire bell, the divine tiger rouses its might, poisonous blades wildly unleashed, violet flourishing ritual, four leaps with raised cries, the Nine Heavens and Six Heavens, the Four Great Bright Stars, externally encircled by the mysterious breath, internally guarding the master troops, left commanding, right watching, wind attacks, fire assaults, shouting to sever myriad demons, crushing and decapitating a thousand spirits, the Golden True opens the shock, the Nine Devils seize forms, the Northern Feng falls and breaks, all destroyed and overturned. I wear the true talisman, commanding myriad spirits, the Three Primes report the truth, the mysterious union of imperial sincerity, the Supreme Microcosm’s high command, ascending to the Three Purities.

The method of the Supreme Primordial Radiance Powerful Divine Inner Blessing is all from the forbidden scriptures of Shangqing. The Poison King to be repelled is the inner name of the great demon of the Six Heavens. The shaking of the banner of the Sevenfold Net is the hidden name of the Northern Emperor demon king. The Four Bright Stars of the Heavens are the soul names of the Northern Feng ghost forms. Those who know the names of these three demons cause a thousand demons to scatter their tracks, ten thousand ghosts to hide their shapes, nine devils to be unable to move or try, a hundred evils not to be able to cause harm. Alone in the mountains and forests, or among the gods and ghosts in temples and mansions, one may act according to these instructions without needing to burn incense in a chamber.

The Five Bells ascend to the void, stepping the empty path to preserve the immortal; also named the Fire Bell.

The Supreme Microcosm Heavenly Sovereign receives the breath from the beginning; the mysterious phenomena first divide; ascending the platform of the Nine Mysterious Voids of birth, the five imperial divine officials guard the eight directions. The five talismans float in empty reflection, appearing and disappearing, hovering over the Phoenix Platform, within the jade chamber and curved rooms, accumulated for seven thousand years, their texts appearing therein. Their radiance shines in the nine heavens, their script flourishing in Jade Purity; when cast on the left they become flowing golden fire bells, on the right they shake the seven origins of release, restraining the demons of the utmost heaven, spreading awe in the court of the nine clouds, reaching the ultimate subtle Way, deeply mysterious and hard to surpass. The Sovereign purifies himself in the Supreme Void Jade Platform Dongzhen Hall, the jade chamber and golden splendour room, with many maidens attending, five-coloured divine officials, a hundred million men, flying beasts and poisonous dragons, valiant guards at the gates, giant dragons a thousand zhang high, guarding the walls, phoenix cries and dragon roars, a hundred sounds stirring the hall, majestic and spreading widely, lions roar and call, crowds blow cloud songs, jade sounds flow and sparkle, divine consorts sing in chorus, jade maidens pluck strings and beat melody. Then I summon the Central Yellow Elder Lord, the Four Perfected of the Great Ultimate, arrange the flowing rosy nectar, the ring of steel fruits, red trees and white seeds, hidden ganoderma entwined, myriad fragrances falling, accumulated for ninety days. Thereupon the Turtle Mother places the brush, the Great One sweeps the mats, the Heavenly Consort attends incense, the jade maidens weave and bind, using white jade for tablets, inscribing golden script, delivering to the Left Duke of the Immortal Capital, sealed in a jade cloud brocade pouch, transmitted to the Central Yellow Elder Lord, who in turn receives the five talismans by covenant, bows and retires, then summons the Nine Spirits’ flowing radiance cloud chariot, fifty thousand five-coloured divine officials, flying with blue-green feathered dragon cloaks, ascending to the Golden Palace Jade Purity Court.

If one possesses the golden script of the Eastern Flower and obtains to see this writing, then the predestined fate responds to immortality. Wearing the talisman and travelling, myriad spirits come to court, emerging from emptiness and entering the void, circling the Five Mountains, passing the five planets, the body born of water and fire, transforming the ten directions. Wearing it for nine years, one descends to receive the green cakes, ascends to visit the Three Primes, and attains rank in Jade Purity. Its Way is secret and wondrous, not passed to the untrue; lightly revealing its chapters causes the body to perish and form to vanish. According to the Xuanzhen bright rites, one transmission is allowed every seven thousand years; to violate the covenant and break the oath brings disaster upon the seven mysteries, the body and former teachers, all filling the rank of low ghosts, suffering ten calamities and eight hardships.

Those who receive the talisman scripture must bring proof to their master, purify themselves for three days, bathe and burn incense. The talisman and scripture are exposed overnight upon a high altar. At dawn, together ascending the altar, one reports to the Northern Emperor, opens the covenant, measures the talisman scriptures, and entrusts them to disciples. Without ascending the altar to report the oath, one must not rashly open the chapters. If the master lightly reveals the texts, the body is tested by the wind blade. If disciples refuse to receive and unroll the scrolls, disaster comes upon the seven mysteries, the body is maimed and sight lost. The rites of the Four Extremities forbid lightly revealing scriptures. The laws of the Great Truth forbid without covenant and proof. Unless one has the golden name and jade seal, none may hear or see. Those who seek immortality, without the five talismans worn upon the body, the five mountains’ immortal officials will not guard their forms; the records of the Three Officials’ ghosts will not allow their death names to fall; when dwelling in mountains and hills, they are defeated by the Nine Heavens demon kings; when going in and out of the world of men, they cannot avoid the disaster of local officials’ knives and soldiers. Those who obtain and wear it tread the abyss of heaven, roam boundlessly, at pleasure wind and turn, preserving the true spirit, returning to their original palace, the five fungi spontaneously grow, their bodies reflect jade light, the immortal officials guard and protect, the Three Primes visit the chamber, riding clouds driving the void, ascending to Jade Purity.

One hundred days after receiving the talisman, one must prepare five paulownia boards each five cun long, inscribe the talisman upon each board. Also inscribe five needles, recording: On a certain year, month, first day, hour, in a certain county, township, village, under a certain mountain, certain master, certain person, of such years, a certain imperial scion belonging to a certain mountain. These are entrusted as tags, buried in the five mountains. When burying the talisman, click the teeth thirty-six times and chant:

Above, report to the Three Primes Jade Emperor Honourable; below, inform the five mountains, five-coloured immortal officials; receiving the flowing bell five talisman true words; pure fasting with five incenses; recording the names of mountains and rivers; beseeching true immortals to come guard my form; five fungi flowing yellow, black, white, red, and blue; body born of water and fire, dazzling the fire bell; dragon reins arrive at the chamber, ascending to the jade court. Thus the five directions’ immortal officials guard the form, teaching the true Way of the tutelary spirit, roaming the five mountains and seas, all spirits coming to court.

The fire bell shakes its power, containing the great divine wisdom blessing. Wearing the flowing golden fire bell, entering and departing near and far, traversing dangerous cliffs and robbers and sickness, under perilous circumstances, one must preserve the true light to defend oneself, opening a path of ten thousand li. At the beginning of issuing, face the direction, click the left teeth twenty-seven times, swallow breath thirty-six times, then contemplate the place and its form and image; mountains and forests, grasses and trees, people and birds and beasts, spirits and gods all clearly and brightly, all come to bow before my form. Contemplate the Northern Dipper’s seven stars covering my head, preserving my left eye as the rushing star, my right eye as the swift thunderbolt, the light gleaming and rushing over ninety thousand li, seeing the road to the place, following the light to open the passage; mountains and forests, grasses and trees, people and houses, soldiers, robbers, ghost breath, all commanded to vanish, leaving no trace, the four roads cleansed. Then recite the blessing:

Open in front and close behind, heaven balanced and earth raised, divine lords go forth on journeys, the four roads opened and extended, commanding heaven and earth, opening my bridge, front, rear, left and right, penetrating the eight directions. My left casts the rushing star, my right the swift lightning, flowing essence ten thousand li, what demon dares oppose? The Great One will send, myriad gods come to greet, wherever I go, nothing but good fortune. Riding clouds and driving the void, ascending to the Great Void. Finished, then draw in the essence of the two eyes, each returning to its palace; left draws seven breaths, right draws seven breaths, all swallowed. Thus one may venture cliffs and traverse difficulties, attack ghosts and defeat soldiers, all responding resoundingly. The method is most wondrous, not to be transmitted in writing, only by word of mouth; take care in this. According to the mysterious rites, one transmission is allowed every seven hundred years.

The Five Emperors’ Flowing Bell Five Talismans wield power to command the demons of the extreme heaven, summon and gather the spirits of the five directions, respond above to the five stars, participate in the seven origins below, correspond to the human body, the nine apertures and seven lights, encompassing heaven and earth, nothing unconnected, no darkness unexplored, no detail unexamined. When the talisman is preserved, light is visible; when the talisman is cast, spirits are stirred. If you wear it and receive the master’s oral instruction, if you encounter places of evil ghosts in the world, you should perform a great shaking power blessing, facing north, closing breath twelve times, contemplating the five directions’ breath, covering your head and body, inside and outside enveloped in darkness, nothing to be seen. Then click the left teeth thirty-six times, swallow the five directions’ breath, thrice for each direction, all breath removed, all entering the tutelary form. Preserve my two-eyed boys, light like shooting stars, dazzling over the five directions, then recite:

Heavenly Origin Seven Essences, Five Emperors’ Flowing Bell, dazzling and casting lightning, like heavenly shooting stars, shining over the ten directions, illuminating the ghosts’ true forms. What minor demon dares approach my life gate? The Great Emperor commands extermination without kinship, slaughters liver and guts, utterly destroying ghost essences, thousands upon thousands all crushed, tens of thousands all overturned. The divine might utters blessings, restraining talismans without ceasing. Then swallow breath thirty-six times and stop. Thus one blessing summons the five directions’ divine officials, all musters of armed soldiers, spirit bearers, bound and brought to court, three blessings extinguishing ghost breath and seed.

If you enter the five mountains, roaming mountains and rivers, braving cliffs and heights, when not yet a hundred paces from the place, click the left teeth thirty-six times. If at the Eastern Mountain, contemplate the Blue Emperor’s rare forest pearl officials numbering nine thousand, coming to guard my front, rear, left and right, covering my head and body with the blue mist’s breath. If at the Southern Mountain, contemplate the Red Emperor Dan Xuanzi officials numbering eight thousand, coming to guard my front and rear, covering my head and body with crimson cloud breath. If at the Western Mountain, contemplate the White Emperor Shao Hao Ling officials numbering six thousand, coming to guard my front and rear, covering my head and body with pure mist breath. If at the Northern Mountain, contemplate the Black Emperor Xuan Ming officials numbering five thousand, coming to guard my front and rear, covering my head and body with mysterious cloud breath. If at the Central Mountain, contemplate the Yellow Emperor Zhizhong original officials numbering twelve thousand, coming to guard my front and rear, covering my head and body with yellow breath. Then recite the blessing:

Heaven shines with radiant spirit, seven dawns of mysterious essences, five-dipper floral canopies, encircle and surround my form, five-coloured flying mists mixed and intertwined. Wearing the seven origins, flowing golden fire bells, dazzling cast to the north, utmost heaven’s obscure gloom. The Five Emperors’ divine officials, stationed to command heaven’s soldiers, guard and restrain for me, mountains and rivers, lands and fields, a thousand ghosts and myriad spirits, all commanded to bind their heads, escort true forms, execute front and rear, capture without cessation.

Finished. Such a blessing dispels the traces of heavenly demons, myriad gods come to court, roaming the five mountains, treading mountains and rivers, no longer troubled by trials and observations. The immortal officials of the Five Mountains come of their own accord, offering five fungi and jade blossoms to you.

If among armies and robbers, beneath the officials’ white blades, in peril and disaster, one should click the right teeth twelve times, preserve the seven dips covering the body, mysterious light shining bright, encompassing the whole body. Preserve the liver as the Year Star, issuing on the left; lungs as the Venus Star, issuing on the right; heart as the Mars Star, issuing in front; kidneys as the Dragon Star, issuing behind; spleen as the Zhen Star, issuing above the chest. Command the five stars’ essence breath to encircle before and behind, my body sitting at the Dipper Leader’s centre, beneath the five stars. Next contemplate the Five Emperors’ divine officials guarding my left and right, and still recite:

Heaven is my house, earth is my bed; the five mountains and rivers are my bridges and beams; the mysterious Dipper primal essence is my clothing; hidden within the seven origins, the land of flowing fire; my guide is the Great Unity’s endeavor; those passing me are the White Origin without excellence. Disaster cannot harm, soldiers cannot injure; command that my body ascend to the Golden Palace of the Nine Elders’ capital.

Finished. Thus in distress and constriction, the decreed final fate is set free.
