### The Mysterious True Supreme One Imperial Lord’s Great Elixir Hidden Scripture of the Mysterious Tao

Also called the Three Primal Vast Treatise

When Lady Ziwei first received this scripture, she first composed the following recitation:

The crimson radiance floats through the mysterious dawn,  
The Purple Pavilion rides the clouds in procession.  
Looking upward beyond the Golden Gate,  
Gazing downward on the Western Splendid City.  
The eastern glow opens the Five Brights,  
The spiritual essence shines with seven spirits.  
Veiled and reflected by the Three Candles' record,  
Flowing freely, it proceeds to the obscure dark.  
The wind drums the empty vault,  
Fragrant smoke disperses in the Jade Court.  
With hands holding the Weaver Maiden’s dance,  
Twin collars fall like embroidered blue.  
To the left circles the patterned feathered banner,  
The splendid canopy inclines with the clouds.  
Feasting and sleeping beyond the Nine Courts,  
Right and wrong do not engage me.  
Embracing the void within the Mud Pellet,  
The heavenly form is as intimate as the sun;  
How could it be the same as the foul and filthy,  
Miserable and listless in its living?  
Supporting the green empty peaks of Fusang,  
Vermilion spirit flowers faintly bright.  
On the Cang Terrace, high in the empty night,  
The Four Observatories reflect the clear heights.  
Flying shadows control the purple wheel,  
Three plain bridles, vermilion carriage.  
Reclining in the great emperor’s hall,  
In the courtyard of Ao Cao and Mother A.  
Washing and rinsing in the green brook’s waves,  
Lifting the jade sweet wine urn.  
Curving morning rides the wind’s fan,  
The precious breeze at times descends and inclines.  
Temporarily resting in Pi Ai,  
Turning the chariot to float on Good Purity.  
The mysterious meeting is mutual and essential,  
Wandering freely amid the profound dark.  
At last he knows honour and disgrace are bitter,  
And only then understands the anxious shortness of life.  
The curved chamber may be pure and quiet,  
Nourishing truth awaits the day’s completion.  
Why teach on the way of the world?  
From this arise hundreds of ailments.

Lady Ziwei’s surname was Wang, her given name Qing’e, style Yu (pronounced Yun); she was the twenty-fourth daughter of the Western Queen Mother. The Purple Palace is beyond the Northern Ocean, at the Yu Ming Plain, on the Mysterious Ridge Mountain; this mountain lies northeast of Mount Kunlun. Ziwei spoke to Mother A, saying: ‘If one desires to preserve and imbibe the qi of sun and moon, one must understand the images of sun and moon. The sun is round in form but square in image; the moon is square in essence but round in image. The image hides the form within; the essence is concealed in the image; the image is red, the essence yellow—this is the soul of sun and moon. If one knows this way, one can then exhale and inhale the flowing rosy clouds. The method to receive the sun’s qi is at dawn; to gather the moon’s brilliance at midnight; preserve them, keeping nine cun before the face; let the light and image shine on my Mud Pellet, reaching down to the five viscera, penetrating one body, drawing qi into the mouth; the light and colour are splendidly bright; after a while it is complete, the constant obtaining of long life.’

Right Marquis’s Lady said to Ziwei the names and styles.

The Great One Imperial Lord’s Great Elixir Hidden Scripture of the Mysterious Tao—such a precious scripture is kept within the Supreme Six Harmonies Purple Chamber, under the lordship of the Southern Pole Primordial Lord; hence it is called the Great Elixir Hidden Scripture. This scripture has other names: The Imperial Lord’s Seven Transformations and Changing Images of the Nine Forms; also the Supreme One’s Three Degrees, Imperial Treasures and Five Essences; also the Imperial One’s Mixture of Three and Five Completion. Each name corresponds to the treasures of the four seasons, thus it is the comprehensive scripture of the Supreme One. If one possesses it, one does not die; if one reveres it, one attains long life; if one preserves it, one becomes a spirit-immortal; if one is diligent, one attains true spirit. The Supreme One Void-born Supreme Mysterious Dao Lord commands the Supreme Pole Perfected Person to dispatch nine Jade Flower Jade Maidens, seven Golden Flower Morning Boys, to attend and guard the Mysterious True Scripture, to protect the bodies of those who have the scripture, to defend the souls of those who wear the talismans. The Jade Boys and Jade Maidens record all sins and blessings, speak of merits and cultivation. If you have this scripture, you must establish a secret chamber; your sleeping place must be pure and undisturbed; proclaim and communicate with the mysterious assembly, in hope of true qi. Also always burn incense on left and right, frequently cleanse yourself, silently preserve the spirit; none shall perceive this.

The Supreme Pole Perfected Person’s records for Spring say, the scripture is called the Great One Imperial Lord’s Great Elixir Hidden Scripture of the Mysterious Tao; for Summer, it is called the Imperial Lord’s Seven Transformations and Changing Images of the Nine Forms; for Autumn, it is called the Supreme One’s Three Degrees Imperial Treasures and Five Essences; for Winter, it is called the Imperial One’s Mixture of Three and Five Completion. Thus the four seasons have different titles, and are born according to the times, so-called the mixture of myriad transformations, not confined to one name; this is the scripture of the ultimate Dao, to realize true spirit. Those who study the Dao without the Supreme One are like a person looking with two legs missing; preserving remembrance without the Supreme One is like the chest and belly missing the five viscera; governing spirits without the Supreme One is like starting a journey without four limbs; establishing oneself without the Supreme One is like a corpse stiff and without qi. Therefore this scripture opens all the myriad spirits, produces and forms soul ferry, a thousand passings and a hundred paths; it must have the Supreme One and establish one person. If one studies without a master, one only troubles oneself in vain. Now separately there is a further compilation of this scripture’s waves and streams, excerpts from its external form, not exposing its subtle mysteries, not including all its secret chants, named the Supreme One’s Separate Secret. If one can seek it, one may understand the beginning and reach the end, causing sudden opening of deep sources. Even if the Separate Secret is quietly circulated among students, touching upon coarse marks for jade enlightenment. As for the profound mysterious internal construction, combining the myriad ferries, flowing and meeting true spirits, mixing and merging spiritual mansions, magnificent and brilliant in the transformations of spiritual images, shining beyond creation, brilliant as a perfect orb, silent as the Great Void, rising thickly and forming clouds in the void, condensed in thought to continue the thousand-year night—truly subtle and profound. The love of the Supreme One is all exhausted in this scripture, affairs all embedded in the Mysterious Profound.

The Lady is born of the heavenly soul, formed in the primordial spirit, revolving the nine qi, upholding the mandate of the Supreme One, opening and closing the three ways, accumulating the spirit of the hidden officials, so that the mysterious liquid winds seven coils, flowing ferry and spreading moisture, the sun and moon illuminating the six voids, the mouth and eyes moving their sacred instruments, cloud movement and rain dispensation, virtue imitating heaven and earth, the embryo born within the womb, the five causes all complete, establishing the way of man thus. Therefore the five causes are the five spirits; hence the three ways are the three truths. The five spirits are the souls of heaven; the three truths are the Dao of heaven; the nine qi are the womb of heaven; the Supreme One is the source of heaven; the sun and moon are the eyes of heaven; the mysterious liquid is the moisture of heaven; the six voids are the light of heaven; the hidden palace is the mansion of heaven; the sacred instruments are the transformations of heaven; the primordial spirit is the transformations of the emperor. All these called the nine qi are the mixture and transformation of the imperial lord; transformed and changed into nine, this is called the nine palaces, mixed and changed yet one. Those who desire to cultivate themselves and seek life must follow the ancestral source whence they were born. The ancestral source means the Primordial Father and Mysterious Mother. The Primordial Father governs qi, transforming the principles before the emperor; the Mysterious Mother governs essence, changing and forming the embryo. Essence and qi complement each other, like yin and yang giving birth: clouds move and predict oneself; the Dao harmonizes the nameless; numbers rise in three and five; one begins to receive form; seven and nine are completed; the body is then formed; harmonizing three and five, and seven and nine in the profound dark, symbolizing the emperor’s predecessor, it must be nourished by the emperor, the work of the heavenly sovereign, the nine changes into spirit, the work completes the human body, the body and spirit together; when the spirit leaves death follows; when the spirit guards life follows. Thus the three origins are the beginning of the Dao; the imperial lord is the root of the Dao; the Supreme One is the transformation of the Dao; the nine heavens are the spirits of the Dao; the nine palaces are the dwelling of the Dao; the mysterious field is the garden of the Dao; the mysterious liquid is the ferry of the Dao. Cultivating for three years, one may illuminate the three fields by mirror, reaching spirit immortals; morning going to the six harmonies, evening guarding the Mud Pellet, firmly holding the embryonic essence, the heart is always joyful. Later disciples must use this as the condition; when seeing this scripture, one may begin to speak of the Nine Black Pottery Annotations, the Supreme One’s operation of spirits. Since you have become human, and humans are many, without the Supreme One’s spiritual tablet, the three origins’ golden name, the director of fate’s secret talisman, the five elders’ purple register, though one receives heavenly qi and is born, none can hear or see the ultimate Dao. If you lack the mysterious palace’s purple tickets, the Supreme Emperor’s precious names, the Supreme One’s jade tally, the Eastern Splendid hidden illustrations, the three origins’ spirit inscriptions, the Supreme Emperor’s participating souls, though receiving the heavenly nature and temporarily hearing the ultimate Dao, you still cannot cultivate it, therefore cannot endure long; enduring long but not firm, firm but not focused, focused but not penetrating. You only can hide in the Five Peaks, ascend the path of constant birth, but cannot surpass the eight sights beyond the firmament, the floating smoke controlling brightness, flying and rising with empty feathers, leaping the Great Void. If you lack the Qiong Terrace feather tickets, flowing cloud five corrections, the Supreme One’s golden pavilion, the five sovereign hidden tallies, the Later Sage’s seven talismans, the empty mountain stone box, the elixir platform’s pure writings, the mysterious yellow five elements’ heavenly mother’s embrace chart, the Supreme Round Name Preserving True Elegant Qi Nine Refinements Spirit Body Record, all these will not see the Mysterious True Scripture, nor behold the Supreme One’s transformations, nor hear the chanting of dispelling magical spiritual tigers of wisdom, nor hear the Supreme Hidden Scripture’s eight plain words, nor hear the Great Mysterious True Scripture’s thirty-nine chapters, the Golden True Jade Light dispelling the seven origins. The ultimate Dao’s scripture is profound and dark; only by diligence of mind and preserving remembrance, focusing the heart in the mysterious assembly, then the spirit will open and move, the god will secretly respond, the nine spirits gather, the Supreme One’s book and tablet, gradually one hears the mysterious gate, the origin of life, subtle and profound—can one not be diligent?

Preserve remembrance of the Supreme One, mix with the imperial predecessor, male and female guard the spirit, pour and flow the vast purity, always cause the nine heavens to follow the qi, then one combines one and nine to complete. The essence of the mysterious true is that one body always remains; ferry and blood arise naturally; the male governs the life gate; the female guards the spirit chamber; the Supreme One does not separate, coexisting with heaven. Therefore the Supreme Hidden Talisman says: preserve its male, guard its female, so that heaven and earth cannot fill it. Having preserved it, the five spirits guard the mansion, the five viscera bloom, the spirit dwells in the crimson palace, the emperor governs the Mud Pellet, the hundred spirits are firm, the embryo seals the life gate, and after long time the three-one spirit appears at night, the Supreme One imperial predecessor descends in the morning, appearing in form at your sleeping place. You should be pure and clean, abstain from external affairs, block evil paths, regulate all persons, rarely make cultivation journeys, concentrate the heart in unity, morning and evening cultivate the Dao diligently without ceasing, bathe in five fragrances, separate and quiet the chamber, burn incense on left and right, hoping for true qi.

The Dao of the Supreme One especially abhors the sight of blood, stench, foulness, decay, and putrid qi. If tears fall and drop, the imperial lord grieves and is disturbed; if cries come from the mouth, the Supreme One congeals. When the Supreme One congeals, the nine qi stop and do not transform; the three-one grieves and does not embrace. If the nine qi do not transform, then the three-one also knots; knots and stagnation accumulate daily, causing vital qi to leak out, and old qi to enter. When old qi enters, it is the beginning of illness and approaching death. Therefore the Perfected Ones call crying sounds the voice of death’s end, and tears the leaking essence of ferry; can one not carefully avoid it? If one sees a corpse, or mourns for days, then the imperial lord incurs guilt, is banished to the Supreme Heights, the Supreme One is tested and condemned to the Mysterious Void. Within three years you surely perish. Those who do not receive the Supreme Dao cannot be the same as students. Thus the utmost taboo is mourning, crying, foulness, decay, sorrow, and tears, because they are the Supreme One Imperial Lord’s essence of thought. Also one must not see a corpse; after receiving the scripture, if one sees a corpse for forty-nine days, one cannot live long and will surely perish on the Dao. If one sees twenty-four corpses, one must temporarily pass through the Great Yin and then ascend to immortality. Considering the corpse’s form once seen by both eyes, the corpse ghost embryo also lingers and entwines human thought; thought remaining is recorded in the crimson palace; what the crimson palace recognizes, though forgotten, still remains; it should gradually return to the body’s manifest corpse, sealing the eyes of thought and memory. You must be very cautious. To see blood, corpse, loss, foulness, mourning, crying, and tears is the Supreme One’s utmost taboo. If one always purifies oneself, preserving thought is easy to influence, spirit firmly assembles, the Supreme One governs life, joyfully mixing, practiced for eighteen years, one ascends to heaven in broad daylight. This is the Perfected One’s way of returning old and reverting to infancy.

Always bathe in five fragrances. The five fragrances are the scent of green wood. Green wood’s flowers and leaves have five sections, five by five interlinked; thus it is called the herb of five fragrances. It repels evil qi, checks soul and spirit, restrains ghost smoke, summons spiritual traces; because it has the five-by-five sections, it is beneficial to man. This fragrance mostly grows east of Canglang, thus eastern divine men name it the scent of green wood. Also it is said: burning green wood incense, and fumigating with lu an xi jiao between the sleeping place and head, opens and clears the five turbid visions, stops the earthbound demon evil qi, rushing straight up forty li to the sky. This fragrance’s smoke breaks the turbid vision qi, clears away evil and foul mist; therefore heavenly men, jade maidens, and Supreme One emperors come down amid the incense qi to rest between your face and eyes. Burning incense at midnight, also always preserve it and do it; do not neglect or forget.

Preserve the three-one, guard the Supreme One, perfect the chamber, meet the imperial lord, then transform and produce the nine spirits within your form, aid your spiritual brightness, accomplish your immortal truth, protect your long life, secure your embryonic soul. Bai Yuan, Wu Ying, Tao Kang, Director of Fate, Supreme One, mix the five spirits, holding registers and talismans. The five spirits each have their master; mixed with the nine changes, three and five transform in the mystery; thus the three palaces stabilize truth, a hundred joints receive spirit; the imperial lord’s precious register fixes fate without error, revolving among the empty mists, opening and communicating the mysterious essence. The twenty-four truths suddenly arise, opening the upper origin, opening the eight darknesses; left facing the six jia, right commanding the six ding; jade flower leads the sun; Supreme One merges forms; a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders lift the body to ascend in the morning, rising in broad daylight.

Those Perfected Ones who cultivate this Dao of the Supreme One all attain the raising to the third heaven; hence it is said: lifting the body to ascend in the morning, rising in broad daylight. At cockcrow one ascends to the empty void, matching the sun at midday, arriving above the third heaven. The sun at midday is broad daylight; cockcrow beginning is ascending morning; thus preserving the Supreme One’s mixing, mostly using cockcrow and life qi times. If you have the Supreme One Mysterious True Scripture, separately keep it in a pouch, sealed with precious implements, placed on your desk, daily bowing to it as you would to lord or father. Whatever you do or approach, you must first open and pay respects, three times secretly calling the Supreme One’s nine lords’ names, then ask for what you wish, and dreams will respond with omens of fortune or misfortune; if your heart is sincere and focused, when sleeping and waking you will surely have response and effect. If you need to recite, practice, perform, or inspect, write a separate copy, carefully keep it. The scripture on your desk is regarded as the supreme treasure.

The hidden transformation of the three origins thus forms the three palaces, named Supreme Clarity, Supreme Simplicity, Supreme Harmony. Three times three make nine; thus there are three cinnabar elixir fields, also three mysterious chambers, combining the upper three origins, thus the nine palaces. Among the nine heavens and nine palaces are nine spirits, called the Nine Souls of the Heavenly Emperor, transforming into nine qi, changing into nine spirits, each governing one palace; hence called the nine palaces. Within Supreme Clarity are Supreme Simplicity and Supreme Harmony; in the mysterious chamber are the Bright Hall and Crimson Palace; these are the six mansions. Above is the heavenly mansion; below is the mysterious terrace. The titles of three and five differ in position. One is within Supreme Clarity, the three-five imperial lords; two are the three-one cinnabar field spirits. Also the five are the spirits of registers and talismans: Supreme One, Gongzi, Bai Yuan, Director of Fate, Tao Kang Lord; combined are called three-five, each of the three-five has its palace chamber. When the three truths each rest in their palaces, the five spirits see the imperial lord above. To the imperial lord’s left is the ancient elder patriarch; to the right is the Mysterious One Elder Lord. This is the so-called nine lords within the boundless; above is true unity. The nine lords are called the souls of heaven, naturally becoming true sons, regarded as the predicting spirits. If one knows how to preserve the nine lords, deeply thinks of the three truths, one must be able to use the one body to revolve among the three-five, repeatedly encircle seven and nine, so that the emperor’s spiritual soul constantly governs the self, the five spirits uphold registers, continuously returning and beginning; surely one will ascend in broad daylight; how much more than mere non-death!

The imperial lord mixes and transforms, revolves among three and five, the Supreme One’s myriad transformations, forming seven and nine, their number combined making twenty-four. Heaven has twenty-four qi, the qi’s highest transformation. Changing thus completes the Perfected Person; man also receives it; therefore the body has twenty-four spirits; the spirits have a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, roaming the eight extremes. If you think and preserve remembrance, do not forget, you can avoid death and seek life, ascend above the ten directions; thus the spirit rests and qi is clear; above communicates with heaven, transcends the earth’s door, passes beyond heaven’s gate, hides and rests in the four directions, the Seven Stars scatter and divide, flying and roaming the cloud chamber, the sun and moon cultivate roots, guard the gold store and jade, govern all spirits. Who is the immortal king? I have already become his truth. This is the way of hidden preservation, also having scripture formulas, in the supreme emperor’s supreme treasure splendid treatise. Since you have it, do not transmit it recklessly; you must take an oath, examine the person and then declare. The imperial one way is revered; the seventy-nine myriad transformations, so-called one transforms into ten thousand thousands, seven and nine again return; the heavenly Dao is not far, three and five again return. If you know the one revered, you live long and fly as an immortal; if you know the three-five, you roam the world; if you do not know the one revered, though living you have no root; if you do not know the three-five, your body returns to earth. This is true indeed.

The Great Mysterious True Scripture says: Heaven has nine souls not to be separated; the Dao has three truths not to be left the body; the imperial one transforms scenes, myriad transformations reach perfection; flowing pearls stop brightness, purple haze leaps in smoke, seven degrees of return road, three lights shine on truth, supreme precious talisman, mutually close and dear. This is wondrous speech.

Also the High Supreme Divine Firmament Scripture says: Souls are born from non-being, spread in the nine palaces; the Dao issues from the three extremes, constantly roaming the crimson palace; the three palaces combine and transform, this is called the Purple Chamber. Where the Purple Chamber is located, first through the Bright Hall, the soul is able to know it, and must open the Golden Gate. The Golden Gate is inside the mysterious chamber. Also it says: mixed and combined, entering and exiting the imperial place, three and five combining as one, surely becoming immortal kings. This means the time of mixture, the Dao of the three truths and five spirits. The imperial place is the Supreme Clarity region. Therefore the Middle Chapter of the Great Mysterious Scripture says: Two elders are on the left and right sides; the imperial soul must not be separated; three nine transform its top and bottom; the Supreme One stands as the central root; the five spirits serve my birth register; Director of Fate seals my death gate; the nine palaces combine into one; the six harmonies gather and are true within. This means to distinguish its palaces, mix their transformations. This Dao is the supreme treasure practice, the root of long life, the imperial predecessor of man, the origin of the Dao, the immortal ancestor of the birth mansion, the secret chapter of imperial registers, the mysterious wonder of the Mysterious True, the essential scripture of the nine palaces.

The Central Scripture of the Nine Truths says: the nine souls separate and unite, the three lights shine together, the heavenly emperor is at the origin, purple mist billows, the five spirits serve the plan, nature and life are not lost, transforming into the nine palaces, wearing crimson robes, belts bearing tiger emblems, flowing cloud embroidered capes, curtains and banners mottled; the five colours wander; sun and moon observe and inspect; swiftly east and west; the spirit court’s inner body, to remove thirst and hunger; three and five again return, turning and storing and arranging mechanisms; revolving around the Supreme One, producing balance of the two forms. This means the heavenly emperor is in the Supreme Clarity, the Supreme One is nourished, the five spirits serve registers and talismans; the student preserves the sun and moon to illuminate swiftly. This middle scripture explains the affairs of the Supreme One’s name; thus it is recorded here.

At midnight when life qi is born, at cockcrow time, lying down with eyes closed, subtle qi, preserve the sun issuing from the left eye, the moon issuing from the right eye, both nine cun apart, above the two ears. Above the two ears is called the Six Harmonies High Window. Let the sun and moon illuminate the whole body, thoroughly penetrating the Mud Pellet, shining down to the five viscera and intestines, all clearly perceived, penetrating inside and outside. Let the whole body combine with sun and moon light; after a while complete, knock teeth nine times, swallow saliva nine times, then softly chant:

Supreme Mysterious One, Nine Emperors expel essence,  
Three, five, seven transformations, observing the profound dark,  
Sun and moon suspend light, penetrating the spirit court below,  
Swiftly illuminating the Six Harmonies, Supreme One Yellow Tranquil,  
Imperial Lord commands the tablet, the Golden Book does not waver,  
Five Elders serve the talisman, heaven and earth share sincerity,  
Make me immortal, attain true spirit,  
Restrain ten thousand evils, eliminate calamities,  
Pay homage to the Heavenly Emperor above,  
Return to old and revert to infancy,  
The Supreme Emperor has decrees,  
The hundred spirits respectfully listen.

Complete, then open the eyes. This is called the sun and moon refining the root, the three origins adjusting the soul, to govern the form and spirit, repel all ghost qi invasions, causing the self to live long and not die, preserved every evening. Also preserve the left eye as sun, the right eye as moon, together joining in the spirit court, then entering the Bright Hall, transforming and producing the yellow nectar, flowing down to the mouth, swallowing nine times to nourish the Supreme One. Always at life qi time, after preserving, softly chant:

Sun and moon’s supreme essence, yellow water and moon brilliance,  
Supreme One comes to drink, spirit light spreads high,  
Make me live long, heaven and earth accord.

Complete. Do this for five days.

The tongue on the mouth is the spirit court. After preserving the sun and moon, move the tongue, perceive the yellow spring as purple-gold colour issuing from the tongue, flowing upwards into the Bright Hall, called the yellow nectar. When preserving and thinking, close the eyes and stop all thought.

Always on the evening of the new moon, at life qi time, lie down with eyes closed facing upwards, keep in mind the twenty-four stars, each star one cun in size, arranged as linked together. Also preserve one star among them, within which there is a person, combining twenty-four persons, all like infants just born, without clothes. Then the twenty-four stars descend directly from the sky’s void, encircle the body three times round. After three rounds, each star is swallowed one by one into the mouth, twenty-four swallows in all. When swallowing, one feels each star swallowed. One perceives the star’s light reaching the navel, called the palace of receiving fate. One perceives the star’s light illuminating the abdomen, thoroughly penetrating the five viscera. One perceives the star light transforming into twenty-four Perfected Ones, all exhaling yellow qi like smoke, spreading to fill the navel, thick and penetrating inside and outside. After a while, softly chant:

Twenty-four truths return into the Yellow Court,  
The mouth exhales yellow qi,  
The twenty-four stars irrigate my life gate,  
The hundred spirits receive spirit,  
Make my bones strong,  
Soul and spirit at peace,  
The five viscera receive talisman,  
Heaven and earth incline mutually.

Complete. This is called true qi entering and guarding the life gate, to repel disaster, calamity, ghosts, and diseases, causing long life and non-death.

The Great Void mixes and combines, symbolizing the one spiritual void-born son, regarded as the supreme emperor. Also he dwells as emperor of the Mud Pellet, regarded as the honored supreme three-one emperor. The honored emperor is the void-born son. These three are called the three emperors. The Supreme One is born in the void and hollow, transforms in the eight directions, sets the scene among the three emperors, flows and gathers under the leadership of myriad spirits. The honor of heaven and earth all require the Supreme One to self-move. Without the Supreme One, the Spiritual Emperor does not return qi in the mystery void; without the Supreme One, the Honored Emperor does not dwell in his palace domain. Therefore the Supreme One’s spirit, together with the five spirits, is commonly used; the upper abode is situated in the three emperors. The emperor’s height is like the Heavenly Emperor Imperial Lord. Equal in form are the nine souls; souls born in three and five; three and five combine and meet, forming the imperial lord. When the emperor is born, he receives the supreme upper qi, the place where three and five separate and unite. Thus the emperor is born outside the boundless, in the midst of mysterious completion, seen in the domain of Supreme Clarity, governed in the Jade Clarity Purple Star Palace, shining five colours, splendid canopy ninefold; in front the Mud Pellet, behind the hidden gate, below looking down on the six harmonies, above connecting to purple clouds, a hundred officials guarding, flying pavilions communicating, jade halls and vermilion steps, inside golden chambers, middle with Supreme Truth, called Heavenly Emperor, born relying on void, dwelling within boundlessness, wearing five-coloured pearl robes, crowned with nine virtues morning crown, governing the heavenly ridge, at times riding the jade dragon with six reins, transcending the void nine ways self-communicating. This is the natural essence qi, the imperial lord of all truths, if one always thinks on and recites it, one may become an immortal king.

Within Supreme Microcosm are three emperors: one called Emperor Lord, two Heavenly Emperor, three Elder Emperor. These are all the three origins’ qi, naturally combined true spirits. Each of the three origins is a lord, all dwelling within Supreme Clarity. Supreme Clarity has three palaces: the highest is the Heavenly Emperor Imperial Lord’s palace; on the left is Supreme Simplicity Palace; on the right is Supreme Harmony Palace. The three palaces are located at the Mud Pellet gate inside boundlessness. Thus the Emperor Lord governs the one, generally holding the spirit’s firmness; the Heavenly Emperor governs two, transforming scenes and guarding form; the Elder Emperor oversees three, regulating the myriad spirits; the Supreme One mixes and combines, forming and nurturing the self. Thus the three and five separate and transform, filling the nine palaces. Therefore the Supreme One’s spirit is the lord of transformation and birth.

Supreme Simplicity Lord Yuan Cheng Laozi is also the spirit of heaven, ruling within Supreme Clarity, inside Gou Chen, constantly attending the imperial lord, governing the true primordial qi, called the Great Simplicity Lord. Supreme Harmony Lord Huang Cheng Laozi is the spirit of heaven’s soul, also ruling within Supreme Clarity Gou Chen, called the Supreme Harmony Lord, constantly attending the Heavenly Emperor, governing the embryonic primordial qi. Supreme Simplicity and Supreme Harmony Lords are the souls and spirits of heaven and earth, born from nature? Supreme Simplicity Yuan Cheng Laozi constantly attends the imperial lord within Supreme Clarity; Huang Cheng Laozi constantly attends the Heavenly Emperor, entering and exiting Purple Star, residing at Kunlun, Yellow Gate Purple Chamber, Supreme One assisting, the three qi of chaos, the root of the great Dao. You must always think of this; the emperor comes and remains long.

On the second and third night of the lunar month at midnight, preserve the method of Yuan Cheng Elder Lord, lie quietly with eyes closed, first think of the central supreme emperor lord in the Supreme Pole, next think of the Yuan Cheng Elder Lord on the left, wearing green robes, crowned with nine shining flowers, left hand holding green ganoderma, right hand holding green banner; next think of the Supreme Harmony Lord Huang Cheng Elder Lord on the right, wearing white robes, crowned with five shining flowers, left hand holding golden night oar, right hand holding white banner, both within the Supreme Pole. Within the Supreme Pole are nine names; within Supreme Clarity are five emperors, six mansions, nine officials, their domains united as one: one is Supreme Clarity; two is Supreme Pole; three is Supreme Microcosm; four is the Purple Chamber; five is Mysterious Terrace; six is Imperial Hall; seven is Heavenly Mansion; eight is Yellow Palace; nine is Jade Capital Mysterious Metropolis. In brief, from one cun above the nape, straight down is the Supreme Pole Palace, which is only one cun square. The Supreme Pole Palace is above the Six Harmonies Palace. The Six Harmonies Palace, the Supreme One’s spirit dwells there. From between the two eyebrows going inward one cun is the Bright Hall; two cun inward is the Mysterious Chamber; three cun inward is the cinnabar field; to the north of the Bright Hall, south of the Mysterious Chamber, one cun above between the two eyebrows is the Six Harmonies Palace. The Six Harmonies Palace is one cun square.

When the three perfected are fully preserved, also preserve my soul as one person like me, entering the Supreme Pole Palace; the two elders then grant green ganoderma and golden liquid wine to me, who then preserves by eating the green ganoderma and drinking the liquid. The green ganoderma resembles lotus flowers; the liquid resembles fine wine. After eating and drinking, then I again bow twice before the imperial lord, saying:

Today I report to the Green Emperor Lord in the court, bestowing the divine ganoderma and golden jade nectar, the two elders measuring the register, Supreme One presenting the chapter, long life and enduring vision, unending lifespan.

Also preserve the imperial lord’s answer: fortunate indeed; at the second and third of the month I will come again.

Complete, thus taking and imbibing. This is called receiving the emperor’s medicine within the Purple Chamber. Hence the Dispelling Demon Scripture says: the soul can seek food, ascending to the Supreme Pole, the two elders grant command, the imperial lord’s power, this is the meaning. When preserving and thinking of the Supreme Pole, always enter between the two eyebrows. Between the two eyebrows is the jade gate of the Mud Pellet, called the guardian inch, Yellow Gate Purple Chamber.

Always on one’s birth date, or the first of the first lunar month, or on the sixth Wu day at midday, crown and belt entered the chamber, facing north bowing twice, chanting:

High Emperor Lord, Supreme Jade Dawn,  
Sovereign Heaven Elder, Supreme Great Dao,  
Descendant Wang Jia,  
Wish the imperial lord long peace over me in the Purple Chamber Palace.

That night at the appointed time, enter the secret chamber, lie quietly with eyes closed facing north, keep in mind the Great Northern Dipper Supreme Pole central bright star, essence shining rightly with yellow light qi descending, preserve before the spirit, lead into the mouth, swallow thirty-seven times and stop. Preserve making the yellow essence and harmonious qi fill the Supreme Granary Yellow Court middle and lower cinnabar field, descending to the Yin Chamber earth gate, circulating around the body, all made complete. Then think also of the five persons in the Purple Chamber Palace, suddenly manifesting as five emperors: the Heavenly Emperor Imperial Lord is in the center, the Supreme One comes above, you must kneel before the emperor, presenting the fate registers; Director of Fate stands behind, removing the death register; preserve removing the death register. The death register is a black tablet with white writing; the life register is a white tablet with blue writing. Preserve seeing the white jade tablet, with blue brush; Director of Fate presents this white tablet and blue brush to the imperial lord; the imperial lord bows facing south and writes: ‘Certain Wang Jia of a county, village, and township, style Yi, birth register recording the year, long life and supreme mystery, all the directions as wished, truly an immortal; all who see are called Perfected Ones; the Supreme One may command, protect Jia’s body, forever nourish sun and moon, lifespan one million years.’

Also preserve a register tablet one cun long, five fen wide. Think and contemplate the writing and words clearly. Next preserve Supreme One, Gongzi, Bai Yuan, Director of Fate, Tao Lord five persons, from the Six Harmonies Palace, ascending into the Purple Chamber, each presenting a green jade table; on each table is a talisman, the talisman each green-blue colour, presented to the imperial lord; the imperial lord takes each talisman in order, and gives it to the presenter; together transform the four emperors. One emperor’s name is Diao Liang Ji, style Qing Ping; one emperor’s name is Chang Lai Jue, style Nan He; one emperor’s name is Zhang An Xing, style Xi Hua; one emperor’s name is Bao Cheng He, style Bei Fa. Preserve these four emperors, and together read the five talismans. After reading the five talismans, present them to the spirit; the spirit receives talisman, then kneels before the imperial lord, and takes them in order to serve. Preserve one talisman one cun long, five fen wide. That is done. Then preserve four emperors from the void, ascending to the third heaven, before leaving each says to the spirit: ‘If you can always preserve our names, then you repel ten thousand harms, live long and not die; we are your Supreme One’s children, the three origins’ inner truth; measuring your fate registers and five talismans into form, therefore enduring forever between heaven and earth, thus attaining immortal spirits.’ If it is spring month, then preserve Qing Ping emperor, with green liquid nectar served in a green jade bowl of one sheng, present and serve it; after serving, the four emperors all ascend to the third heaven. If summer month, preserve Nan He emperor; the four seasons imitate this accordingly. The nectar bowls served also vary in colour according to spring, summer, autumn, winter.

Also preserve the imperial lord’s left side has Mysterious One Elder Lord, wearing purple robes, wearing dragon crown. Also preserve the imperial lord’s right side has Three Simplicity Elder Lord, wearing brocade robes, wearing tiger crown. The crowns of dragon and tiger resemble the worldly traveling crown, but with the pattern of dragon and tiger. The Mysterious One Elder Lord’s name is Lin Xu Fu, style Ling Shi Dao. The Three Simplicity Elder Lord’s name is Lao Zhang Shang, style Shen Sheng Dao. Both elders attend behind the Perfected Persons of Zhengyi; on the left is the Perfected Person Zhong Cheng Zi, also named Emperor Bin, style Si Hua; on the right is Perfected Person Qu Wen Zi, also named Guang Jian, style Ling He, wearing robes and crown like the two elders. When finished, also preserve Director of Fate descending to the Six Harmonies, visiting Supreme One Palace; Director of Fate merges with Supreme One; Supreme One then petitions the imperial lord to measure the spirit talisman registers. Supreme One opens to the imperial lord and says: ‘The talisman registers are measured, Director of Fate merges with form; the four emperors grant nectar, the High Supreme records life, requesting the scripture name, issuing the tally to the two elder lords.’ Thereupon the imperial lord suddenly produces the fate register from within his bosom, delivering it to the left elder lord; also produces the five fate talismans from his bosom, delivering to the right elder lord. The two elders receive the talisman registers, and say to the imperial lord: ‘The birth register of so-and-so is fixed, enduring in the world; the imperial talisman records the five elements in the Supreme Simplicity Palace.’ Thereupon the two elders command the two Zhengyi Perfected Persons Zhong Cheng Zi and Qu Wen Zi to take the fate registers and five talismans, ascend to the Jade Clarity Supreme Simplicity Supreme One Supreme Clarity High Mysterious Lords’ Nine Heavens Palace, proclaiming the imperial lord’s measuring of that person’s birth register, so as to attain immortality, called True Worthy; the two elders have orders, all cause to record. Then the two carry the fate talisman registers, ascending to the Nine Heavens; after a while all completed. Also preserve Director of Fate and Supreme One separating form, each as one person, jointly roaming and governing Supreme Clarity, inspecting and governing one body and hundred spirits; after all completed, each returns to their palace. This is called the hundred spirits mixed and combined original fate imperial lord’s great transformation Dao. The five emperors fix the records, the two elders fix the birth assembly.

When mixing original fate, many matters trouble and cannot be recognized; one may secretly read the text in the chamber to perform. The three-one spirit at the Mud Pellet cinnabar field palace has a separate heavenly imperial lord, a child of the Purple Chamber imperial lord. When mixing original fate, first preserve the three-one heavenly emperor, crimson palace, fate gate three spirits, each resting in their palace; this palace has a separate three-one scripture. Now the myriad changes mixed are not the three-one heavenly emperor. The three-one heavenly emperor itself again has times to mix, each with different methods, and different responsibilities.

The imperial lord governs transformation, the Supreme One governs birth, Director of Fate governs fate, Wu Ying governs essence, Bai Yuan governs soul and spirit, Tao Kang governs spirit; man has five registers and five talismans, receiving them from the imperial lord; the five spirits hold them, each governing one, jointly concerning original fate, removing death and ascent. Without the matter of Supreme One, ten thousand will not be born. Even with resolve to seek the Dao and life, pure sincerity and exhaustion of emptiness, also no benefit. Even if having supreme virtue of heaven and earth, merits manifesting in three officials, gentle and benevolent conduct, touching all spirits, not knowing to think and preserve the Emperor Lord, cultivate within the three and five, return the five registers and offer the five talismans, so that the Supreme One may go to the imperial lord to request fate and seek immortality, yet cannot cross the seven nine midst, ascending to supplement the immortal officials. The imperial lords, one lord, two elders, and the three truths, the five spirits’ names, must not be shown to others, or disaster will destroy your household. The Supreme One’s precious formula is only passed after an oath. The precious formula is the Mysterious True Scripture. First examine the person, then take the oath with gold and blue as a pledge, replacing a blood oath. Also daily keep in mind, often cause the three souls to enter the Supreme Pole Palace and revolve with the imperial lord, which is best. Also always on one’s birth date, do not speak evil words, close the chamber to preserve life qi, obtain good conduct, and carefully not transgress.

The Supreme One is the essence of the embryo, master of transformation. The soul and spirit are born of the fetal spirit; the fate qi issues from the fetal mansion; transforming and combining the imperial lord, mixing and changing to become man. Therefore the Supreme One’s spirit is the mother of birth; the imperial lord of honour is the father of birth. The Supreme One’s name is Wu Youshou, style Gui Huichang; also named Jie Ming, also named Ji Pin. These are the true names of the internal treasure scripture of the three origins’ Mysterious Profound; the external formulas and miscellaneous excerpts’ names are all false and unreal. Now these names are very secret and not to be told to others; those who know it live long and never die, repel ten thousand calamities, and can bring down spiritual jade maidens. Every evening one should preserve the Supreme One in the Six Harmonies Palace within oneself, or preserve the Supreme One at the left and right of the fate; sitting or lying, front or back, always present. After preserving at life qi time, softly chant:

The Supreme One’s essence rises in Supreme Clarity,  
Soul and spirit receive transformation,  
Form and shadow become spirit,  
Govern the hundred spirits,  
Bind the three yang,  
Imperial Lord governs smoke,  
Unite true Huichang,  
Inner peace of essence qi,  
Outer dispel disaster and calamity,  
Remove death registers,  
Extend life, water grow long,  
Clothing young and old,  
Transform and change inconstant,  
Always govern the Six Harmonies,  
Revolve the crimson palace,  
Descend through the mysterious gate,  
Ascend to the mysterious village,  
Mix three and five,  
Roam and rest in the heavenly court,  
Call and draw sun and moon,  
Transform male and female,  
Hold fate talismans and registers,  
Embryo’s pouch,  
Life and death’s fate,  
Supreme One supports and leads.

Preserve the Supreme One as exactly as the fate form, clothes and all alike. Thus the form of fate should always be pure and cultivate grandly, seeking to meet the scene of the Supreme One. Clothes, headgear and such must never be borrowed from different qi; all such things must be cautious. Since you cannot yet eat grain, your essence and thought refine the truth; restrain all agitation and filth, pungent blood mixed food, meat, and spicy dishes, all forbidden and cut off. If you can do thus, gradually you will be healed, and may somewhat extend your life.

Left Wu Ying Gongzi is the lord of forming the essence field, the spirit of the three origins’ upper qi, forming the essence field in heavenly essence, the essence born returns to the three qi. Therefore Wu Ying Gongzi always governs the spirit’s talisman of command. His name is Xuan Yuan Shu, style He Fu Zi; also named Yuan Su Jun, also named Spirit Gongzi; always dwelling in the jade chamber Supreme Clarity. Every evening preserve thought of him; after doing so, softly chant:

The right Bai Yuan Lord is also called the Mysterious Yang Lord, governing the soul and spirit’s qi, overseeing the spirit liquid. Thus the soul and spirit are born in the nine spirits’ palaces, the spirit liquid circulates in the three qi’s truth. Hence the master of governing is called Bai Yuan Mysterious Yang Lord, holding and governing the soul and spirit’s talisman of command. Bai Yuan Lord’s name is Yu Ling Biao, style Xuan Yi Jue; also named Zhu Jing, also named Qi Cheng; ruling the jade hall Supreme Clarity. Every evening preserve thought; after doing so, softly chant:

The central Director of Fate Lord is also called Fate Regulating Elder, governing the birth year’s original fate, overseeing lifespan and premature death registers and tablets. The Supreme One transforms soul and arranges registers to Director of Fate; Director of Fate combines and confronts soul imperial lord. Thus Director of Fate’s spirit governs the years of lifespan, the chief minister of duration and termination. Hence the great combination is by talisman registers, thus called Elder. His name is Li Ming Chu, style Xuan Du Xiang; also named Spirit Ancestor, also named Spirit Flower; by day he governs the Hidden Extreme Palace, communicating and governing the Yin chamber, entering and exiting the spirit hut’s two gates; by night he governs in the Mysterious Chamber, within the earth gate, beneath the hidden palace, above the Six Harmonies palace in the upper realm. The Yin chamber means the two nostrils. Director of Fate enters and exits through the nostrils, not between the two eyebrows. At night in the Mysterious Chamber, he is within the jade penis; the earth gate is also within the scrotum. If a woman preserves this, it is to be in the Yin gate within the northern pole. Every evening preserve thought; after doing so, softly chant:

Soul of the Supreme One,  
Transforming into nine palaces,  
Mixing the three truths,  
Changing scenes in the imperial court,  
Hidden extreme mysterious gate,  
Within is heavenly spirit,  
Revolving seven movements,  
Hundred spirits combine,

Returning essence to spirit, revolving essence turning white, combining and transforming beginning, rising and establishing origin, truly the capital resource of heaven and earth, the spirit ancestor of yin and yang, the treasure of the golden gate, jade pass, room and door, also governing fate by Tao Lord’s qi. Thus the Supreme One returns the scene, the imperial lord combines soul; the return of the scene is mixing together with myriad transformations; the combining of soul is transforming essence liquid to give birth continuously. The beginning of essence transformation is sung by Tao Lord, distinguishing the male and female signs. Tao Lord’s name is Hai Dao Kang, style He Jing Yan; also named Ming Yu, also named Fetal Root. By day he governs in the golden gate five regions, this is the navel fate gate, the lower cinnabar field palace. By night he governs in the Six Harmonies on the Supreme One’s right. Every evening preserve thought; after doing so, chant:

The right three-five mixes and transforms the method of giving birth to the five spirits. These five spirits receive the great spirit of five qi, symbolizing the origin of mysterious fate. They arise from void and non-being, and bind the one body. The life within the body requires the five spirits to move and reside. The spirit must every evening preserve remembrance and chant to them. If one cannot chant secretly, one may by day recite the text and cultivate it, no need for midnight, only life qi time. The three souls are born in the five spirits; the three truths arise from the five spirits; thus this Dao is called the method of mixing and combining three and five. Those who practice it live long and never die. Even those already immortal should practice it; those who practice it live constantly. When preserving thought, sit or lie at will; if sitting, facing one’s original fate is best. If one cannot immediately think on the five spirits, one may first preserve two spirits, then three spirits, circling repeatedly, beginning from the Supreme One.

Refined thought and remembrance desire utmost purity and quiet in a secluded chamber, like in the mountains and forests, not mingled with human voices, foul and turbid qi unheard, then it can be practiced. First think on the method of mixing three and five; then close the eyes, look within, knock teeth nine times, swallow saliva nine times, then softly chant:

True of the nine origins,  
Really have three fields,  
Cloud chamber golden room,  
Within are five spirits,  
Binding and restraining might and firmness,  
Changing the mysterious dark,  
Revolving around the mysterious mirror,  
Rotating through heaven and earth,  
Three and five again return,  
Mixing Supreme Clarity,  
Yang qi flowing and moistening,  
Transforming into nameless,  
With me as immortal,  
Ascending to the spirit court,  
Sun and moon facing each other,  
Three lights blended with form,
