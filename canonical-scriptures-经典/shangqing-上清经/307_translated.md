Title of the Scripture: The Supreme Scripture of the Purple Writings of the Sovereign of the Golden Palace of the Highest Clarity of the August Heaven. Commonly named The Purple Writings of the Spiritual Book. The author is unknown; it is roughly dated to the Eastern Jin. It is an important scripture of the early Shangqing (Highest Clarity) School. One scroll. The base text is taken from the section on the Spirits in the Zhengtong Daozang (Daoist Canon).

### The Supreme Scripture of the Purple Writings of the Sovereign of the Golden Palace of the Highest Clarity of the August Heaven

Received by the Great True Immortal Lord of the Five Elders, by command of the Holy Sovereign granted to the Azure Youth Lord, who transmitted it to Wang Yuanyou, and thus taught those having the celestial register under the mysterious name of Bone-Aspect, to whom this writing is due.

The Azure Youth Lord of the Eastern Palace of the Eastern Sea, having purified himself in the Yellow Chamber of the Altar Pavilion for three years, at the time rode a carriage of flowing clouds borne by the three spirits of the Blue Mist, wearing a flying mantle of blue-green feathers like a dragon’s robe. Passing through the Mulberry Grove of the thousand spirits, he ascended to the Highest Clarity Golden Palace, to petition to receive the Supreme Scripture of the Purple Writings of the Spiritual Book.

Within the Golden Palace are four Sovereign Lords; behind them the Holy Sovereign sits on the left, residing in the hall of the Celestial Terrace of Jade and Cinnabar, attended by thirty thousand female spirits and maidens. Poisonous dragons, thunderous tigers, and celestial beasts stand guard at the gates and embrace the passes; dragons a thousand zhang in length protect the walls and fissures; flying horses, rushing sparrows, and great-winged crows peck and strike with their claws, arrayed in the broad court. The heavenly majesty shines brilliantly, the radiance streams in eight directions, the mysterious banners are shaken by the wind, the banners and canopies whirl in dance, the jade trees stir musical sounds, the precious grasses sound their melodies, the cloud choruses swell, the phoenix sings in azure bliss, divine consorts join their voices in song, the roc soars and the phoenix strides.

When the Azure Youth arrived, he prostrated himself and advanced, holding his head respectfully, facing north, and spoke: ‘Your humble servant Fan Mei dares to present words before the august presence of the Holy Emperor. In former times he governed the great void, commanding the flight of the true ones; he surveyed the vast expanse of the Five Spirits, and directed the remote observances of the mysteries. He soared and bathed in the pure yang, sounded the bells and white chimes, illuminated the Three Observatories, dwelling in the tranquil and wondrous awareness, expanding the spiritual garden, cleansing the blue valley. Thus he wandered in long robes, stepped with lofty gait, and joined the nine luan at the ruins of Lang Yan, scattering radiant light above the dark splendour, flowing freely through the dual mysteries, exhausting the standards of spiritual vision, penetrating the vast stillness in the dragon’s void, hiding the fine points within the cinnabar chamber, opening the gates of the spirit and entrusting transformations, moving with form and dispersing encumbrances.

At that time fetters were loosened, spirits quieted, the five spirits were serene, exercises flowed in the empty hollows, scales leapt at the blue ford, emotions were generous and free. Though self-sufficient in the Eight Observatories, there was no limit in the celestial reflections. Contemplating that the true talents had not yet opened, the spiritual jade was dormant and unpolished, he desired the wind to scatter in the orchid woods, to sound the melodies at the cloud’s edge, to develop and open the seven clear regions, to split the condensations and reveal the hidden meanings; but he did not examine the Purple Writings of the Spiritual Book, and whether it could be given as instruction.

At that time the Holy Sovereign was engaged in outer transformations of the subtle mechanisms, high and remote in thought, busy writing in the Great Mystical Scripture, instructing the Left Ministers of the Shangqing, together with the Azure Youth, Jade Girls, numbering several hundred. Neither did he hear the Azure Youth’s words, nor did he pause to recite or take note. Then the Azure Youth again opened his petition, prostrating on his knees, pressing forward, firmly entreating without ceasing.

Thereupon the Holy Sovereign for a long while considered the matter and rested; suddenly he sighed deeply and said: ‘Hard are these words, profound and subtle; sincere and earnest is your awakening; you have cast away your heart’s utmost.’ Thereupon pointing to the void, he showed a countenance of pity. He then brought forth the zither of Cloud Jun, caressing and striking it; clear and spiritual was the sound, brilliant and varied in a hundred tones, the jade’s vibration shook the nine voids, piercing the clear and bright heavenly dome, and sang the chapters of the Great Mystical Divine Province, the soul-condensing melodies, the mysterious poems and spiritual ornaments, the heavenly rhythms rare and fine, leading and illuminating the central qi, sounding frequently with clear notes; the words were:

‘Profound emptiness, highest clarity qi,  
Three simples soaring through splendid mists.  
The abyss opens the spirit’s gate,  
Seven gates wave the feathered youths.  
Expansive cinnabar heavens observed,  
Pure and tranquil dark movements shine.  
Awakened insight of the mysterious meeting,  
At the boundary roosts the flight of the extreme void.  
Great observatory of the vast wilds,  
Secluded and bright the hero’s light shines,  
Abandoned borders veil the empty wheel,  
Remote dwelling freely communicates with the dark.  
Lofty assembly at the mysterious star gate,  
Cold-headed greet the Jade Sovereign.  
Spirit shines with vermilion spiritual sound,  
The empty drum resounds like jade bells.  
Nine reins loosen cloud carriages,  
At liberty on Purple Mist Peaks.  
Cinnabar hills open the azure chamber,  
Green courts unveil the five chambers.  
Golden palace splendid and towering,  
Verdant trees covered with wood canopy,  
Highest clarity palace above.  
Taste the brilliance of sun and moon,  
Gaze upon the formless expanse.  
Profoundly manifest the three spirits’ awareness,  
Desolate in the midst of the kalpa’s measure.  
Why linger in the muddy way,  
Riding five hardships in the child’s breast?  
Why not ride the red infant,  
Mount my mud pellet lord?  
Neither death nor birth,  
No beginning nor end.’

Having finished his chant and song, the Holy Sovereign invited the Azure Youth to sit, set before him the flowing cloud wine and the firm fruit, red trees and white seeds, crimson wood and blue fruit. Then he commanded the Great True Immortal Lord of the Five Elders, the Left Duke, to open the purple budded jade chest, embroidered with cloud brocade; he drew forth the Supreme Scripture of the Purple Writings of the Spiritual Book, and gave it to the Azure Youth Lord, who was to bestow it upon those with jade names of the Mysterious Palace, those who were to be true persons. The Azure Youth withdrew from the seat, kowtowed and received it, returning to the Eastern Palace.

The Purple Writings of the Spiritual Book is the essential text received by the Later Saint Li Jun in his youth during his study of the Dao, the principal instructions for cultivation. It was orally transmitted by the two Heavenly Emperors of the Great Tenuity Heaven, the Purple Tenuity Highest True Heavenly Emperor, and the Jade Clarity Lord; a true method, matters of the great generosity of the Supreme Emperor, all arranged and composed, applied and recited, successive and orderly, combined into one scroll, carved on purple jade tablets with blue-gold characters. Thereupon the Turtle Mother arranged the brush, the True Youth brushed the mat, the Celestial Concubine tended the incense, the Jade Youth compiled the scroll, naming it the Supreme Scripture of the Purple Writings of the Spiritual Book, and gave it to the Great True Immortal Lord of the Five Elders, the Left Duke, to be stored in the purple budded jade chest, held in a cloud brocade bag.

Attending the text were ten Jade Maidens on either side; attending the Holy Sovereign’s annals were ten Jade Youths, together supervising the Daoists versed in the writing of the scriptures, who speak of merit and correct faults, reporting to the Highest Clarity Mysterious Senior Masters. Major faults are examined by the Three Officers; minor faults cause loss of records and expedited years; great sins bring calamity to the Three Ancestors; small sins afflict the body and suffering; neglect causes spirits to depart; defilement causes the text to be concealed. The cultivator of immortality who opens the spiritual writings must rise and bow, wash hands and burn incense. The Celestial Spirits supervise and inspect, how can one not be careful and reverent? Those who have not been taught must not speak rashly of the chapters; to speak is to violate the heavenly laws of secrecy.

The Supreme Scripture of the Purple Writings of the Golden Palace of the Highest Clarity teaches the method of gathering and drinking the flying root and swallowing the sun qi. Formerly received from the Great Tenuity Heavenly Emperor Lord, it is also called the Scripture of the Red Cinnabar Golden Essence Stone Scene Water Mother. One should commonly meet the rising sun, facing east, knocking the teeth nine times completely, inwardly chanting the secret incantation, calling the name of the sun’s soul, speaking the five Emperors’ words of the sun: Sun Soul, Vermilion Scene, Shining Armor, Green Reflection, Returning Clouds, Red Boy, Mysterious Flame, Rising Tempest.

When the heart-prayer calling these sixteen words is finished, close the eyes firmly, and imagine seeing the five coloured flowing clouds of the sun coming to meet the whole body, down to the feet. Also imagine the five colours ascending to the crown of the head; then the sunlight and flowing clouds of five colours enter the mouth. Within the sunlight and flowing clouds themselves there is again purple qi, as large as the pupil of the eye, layered dozens of times, dazzling in the midst of the five lights, called the Flying Root Water Mother. Together with the five qi they enter the mouth; facing the sun swallow the clouds, swallow the breath forty-five times. Having swallowed the breath, swallow the liquid nine times; then knock the teeth nine times, and softly chant:

‘Red hut cinnabar qi,  
Circle heaven nurture essence,  
Hard receives soft,  
Flaming fire yin essence,  
Sun and stars original light,  
Named Great Brightness,  
Nine yang all transform,  
Two smokes both arise,  
Condense soul harmonize soul-spirit,  
Essence of five qi,  
Middle gives birth to five emperors,  
Ride light govern form,  
Gather flying into emptiness,  
Suspend root gain fullness,  
Head wrapped in dragon flower,  
Wear vermilion sash and blue,  
Reins black flowing mysterious,  
Clouds reflect Highest Clarity,  
Grant writing jade slips,  
Golden tower carve name,  
Eating and drinking morning splendour,  
With truth unite spirit,  
Flying immortals of Great Tenuity,  
Ascend to Purple Court.’

When finished, bow twice toward the sun. Among the true immortals numbering over ten thousand, none know the name of the Sun Soul. This Dao is profound and subtle; it is not to be heard by those of flesh and blood, stinking corpses. When the sky is overcast and there is no sun, it may be done in the chamber where one rests, in a clean place. Pure and cultivated Daoists, skilled in the higher spiritual responses, may proceed without seeing the sun. If the Daoist rests in the mountains and forests, fasting long on the Five Mountains, far from dusty men, deeply reflecting on purity and truth, and daily drinks the flying root of the sun’s glow, swallowing the sun’s essence, he immediately perceives the body born of jade brightness, the face shining with flowing light.

If externally one is still entangled in worldly matters, and has not attained stillness of form, wandering the world’s path, the heart bound by honours and nets, he should on the first day of the new moon, the third, fifth, seventh, ninth, thirteenth, fifteenth, seventeenth, nineteenth, twenty-fifth days of the moon, practice as above, ten times within a month. These are the days when the Sun Soul descends to receive, the flying root fills, and the Water Mother dispels dreams. Practiced for eighteen years, the Highest Clarity shall then refine with golden truth, shining with jade light, honored as the Jade Emperor, flying through the great void, riding the three simples of splendour, illuminating all under heaven.

The Great Tenuity Drinking Sun Qi Brightening Spiritual Talisman

If one cannot constantly on the midnight of the new moon write talismans, one must not miss the odd new moon.

On the right, at midnight of the new moon, write in vermilion on blue paper, face east and swallow it, first informing the Sun Soul. At the time of drinking the talisman, hold breath, left hand grasping the talisman, heart praying:

‘Great Tenuity cinnabar measure palace,  
Named Brightening,  
Summon the sun’s upper soul,  
Come transform such a form,  
At dawn strictly prepare,  
Emit from the round court,  
Fly splendor water mother,  
Sun root golden essence,  
Purple reflect flowing light,  
Called Five Spirits.’

When the prayer is finished, then swallow the talisman.

The Supreme Scripture of the Purple Writings of the Golden Palace of the Highest Clarity also teaches the method of gathering and drinking the yin splendour and swallowing the moon essence, formerly received from the Great Tenuity Heavenly Emperor Lord. It is also called the Scripture of the Yellow Qi Yang Essence Hidden Heaven Secret Moon. One should think to see the moon’s first rising, facing west toward the moon, knocking the teeth ten times completely, then inwardly silently pray, calling the name of the moon’s soul, speaking the five ladies’ characters of the moon: Moon Soul, Warm, Misty, Fragrant, Brilliant, Veil, Clear, Gentle, Spirit, Orchid, Abundant, Splendid, Joined, Elevated, Pure, Gold, Clear, Glowing, Gentle, Appearance, Platform, Standard.

When heart-prayer calling these twenty-four words is completed, close eyes firmly, imagine seeing the five coloured flowing essence of the moon coming to meet the whole body, down to the feet. Also imagine the five qi ascending to the crown of the head; then the moonlight and flowing essence of five colours enter the mouth. Within the moonlight and essence itself is again yellow qi, as large as the pupil of the eye, layered dozens of times, accompanying the five essences of the moon’s light, called the Flying Yellow Moon Splendour Essence. Together with the five qi they enter the mouth; facing the moon swallow the essence, swallow the breath fifty times; having swallowed the breath, swallow the liquid ten times; then knock the teeth ten times and softly pray:

‘Yellow sentiment mysterious brilliance,  
Original yin upper qi,  
Disperse deep cold tempest,  
Arrange spirits gather stomach,  
Empty waves ripple clear,  
Upright cleanse pure vessel,  
Moon essence night scene,  
Mysterious palace exalted noble,  
Five lord ladies,  
Each guards mother’s place,  
Red infant flying in,  
Infant continues near,  
Return yin triple union,  
Light mysterious myriad directions,  
Harmonize soul govern spirit,  
Five wombs circulate,  
Ride clouds fly essence,  
Escape emptiness to east,  
Head tied with spirit clouds,  
Splendour attracts wind,  
Left bears dragon talisman,  
Right wears tiger emblem,  
Phoenix feather vermilion mantle,  
Jade pendants golden chains,  
Lofty tree ties ā,  
Named Wood King,  
Spirit base controls root,  
Has deficiency has fullness,  
Bright essence inward reflect,  
Mysterious water expels beam,  
Grant writing jade slips,  
Carve name cloud chamber,  
Eating and drinking moon splendour,  
With truth unite spirit,  
Flying immortals of Purple Tenuity,  
Attend court the Supreme Emperor.’

When the prayer is done, bow twice toward the moon. Preserve sun and moon, sit or stand as convenience allows. Among the celestial officials, none know the name of the Moon Soul. Those true persons who knew it at the time, when the sky is overcast and there is no moon, may perform it within a chamber. The essential instructions are the same as the drinking of sun light. Doing it every night one immediately perceives the body born of light shining, the eyes with flying essences.

The essential days for the moon are the 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, 14th, 16th, 18th, 20th, 22nd, and 24th days of the month, eleven times within a month, enough to attain immortality. The evening of these days is the union of yin and yang, the three qi overflowing, the moon water forming splendour, the time when the Yellow Spirit descends to receive. Practiced for eighteen years, the Highest Clarity will then refine soul and transform spirit, shining with jade light, riding the mysterious reins of splendour, flying through the great void.

The Purple Tenuity Drinking Moon Essence Supreme Mystical Yin Generating Talisman

If one cannot constantly on the midnight of the new moon write talismans, one must not miss the even new moon. The first month is odd, the second month even.

On the right, at midnight of the new moon, write in yellow on blue paper, face east and swallow it, first informing the Moon Soul. At that time one should first drink the Brightening Spiritual Talisman. When swallowing the moon talisman, close breath, right hand grasping talisman, heart praying:

‘Purple Tenuity yellow writing,  
Named Supreme Mystery,  
Summon moon splendour water,  
Nourish spirit and harmonize soul,  
Squarely arranged strict matters,  
Emit from mysterious gate,  
Hidden heaven secret moon,  
Five spirit ladies,  
Flying light nine paths,  
Reflect bright mud pellet.’

When the prayer is finished, then swallow the talisman.

The Great Tenuity Spiritual Book Purple Writings Binding the Three Souls Method

On the evenings of the 3rd, 13th, and 23rd days of the month, at this time the first and second souls are unsettled, the spirits float wandering, the embryonic light emits form, the secluded essence disturbs and calls. The first, second, and third spirits are the three souls’ divine names. On these evenings all abandon the body and roam freely, speeding away from the original chamber; sometimes they are captured by other souls or external ghosts; sometimes they are taken by evil beings; sometimes they fail to return, leaving the form and releasing the substance; sometimes they offend external souls; the two qi battle, all agitated and competing, causing the infant to be possessed by foreign thoughts, going and coming without form, the heart sorrowful and the mind distressed. Daoists should bind and restrain them, so that they do not wander freely.

The method of binding and restraining is to lie straight, remove the pillow, stretch the feet, cross the palms over the ears so the fingertips meet at the nape of the neck, close breath for seven counts, knock teeth seven times, imagine a red qi at the tip of the nose like a small seed, gradually growing, covering the body in nine layers, down to the feet, up to the head, then transform into fire, and circle the body, making one whole; inside and outside transparent, like glowing coals. When all is complete, one should feel a slight heat in the body. Then knock teeth three times again, and softly pray the names of the three souls: first spirit, embryonic light, secluded essence; the three gods quickly settle, and softly pray:

‘Great Tenuity Mysterious Officer,  
Middle yellow begin blue,  
Within refine three souls,  
Embryonic light peaceful,  
Spirit treasure jade chamber,  
With me co-born,  
Must not move rashly,  
Observer most spiritual,  
If wishing to fly and travel,  
Only may seek the Supreme Ultimate Highest Clarity.  
If wishing hunger and thirst,  
Only may drink the returning water jade essence.’

The Great Tenuity Spiritual Book Purple Writings Binding the Seven Po Spirits Method

On the evenings of the new moon, full moon, and last moon day, at this time the seven po spirits wander, roaming in filth and turbidity, sometimes communicating with flesh and blood, going to ghosts and demons; sometimes associating with dead corpses; sometimes seducing the infant, gathering treachery and attacking the home; sometimes reporting human sins to the Three Officers and the River God; sometimes transforming into monsters and demons, causing men to loathe evil; sometimes letting ghosts enter the body, calling evil to kill the substance. All ailments come from the po spirits; rejoicing in death is their nature; desiring the ruin of man is their illness. Daoists should restrain and urge them, refine and transform them, govern and correct them, seize and awe them.

The first po is named Corpse Dog; the second named Hidden Arrow; the third named Bird Yin; the fourth named Swallowing Thief; the fifth named Non-Poison; the sixth named Removing Filth; the seventh named Stinking Lung. These are the seven po’s yin names, the turbid ghosts within the body. The method of restraint and inspection is to lie straight, remove the pillow, stretch the feet, cover the ears with the palms, fingers touching behind the neck, close breath seven counts, knock teeth seven times, imagine white qi at the tip of the nose like a small bean, gradually growing to crown the body in nine layers, down to the feet and up to the head.

When finished, suddenly the white qi transforms into heavenly beasts: two blue dragons at the eyes, two white tigers at the nostrils, all facing outward; the Vermilion Bird on the heart, facing the mouth; the Azure Turtle beneath the left foot; the Spiritual Snake beneath the right foot; within the ears are Jade Maidens, wearing mysterious brocade robes, at the ear doors; each hand grasps a fire light. After a long while all is finished. Then swallow liquid seven times, knock teeth seven times, call the seven po names, and softly pray:

‘Pure qi nine circuits,  
Control po evil and fierce,  
Heavenly beasts guard gates,  
Delicate maidens hold passes,  
Refine po and harmonize softness,  
With me be at peace,  
Must not move rashly,  
Watch and examine form’s source,  
If you hunger and thirst,  
Hear and drink moon yellow sun cinnabar.’

When the prayer is finished, the seven po close inward, mutually guard and receive restraint. If constantly practiced, the turbid po dissipate downward, return to goodness and join the form, harmonizing the three palaces above, and uniting with the origin spirit.

Within the one body of man there are the three original palace spirits, at the life gate is the Great Lord of the Mysterious Pass, together with the three souls’ gods, united as seven spirits, all within the form, desiring to grant long life, benevolent and greatly auspicious lords. The seven po spirits also give birth within the body, yet are enemies attacking it, hence they must be restrained. Daoists only know the methods for seeking immortality, but not the methods for restraining the po spirits, and thus fail to escape vain toil.

The location of the three original palaces is: the Upper Original Palace in the mud pellet (brain), its spirit is the Red Infant, named Three Origins’ Ancestor, also called Imperial Minister; the Middle Original Palace in the centre of the crimson chamber, its spirit the True Person, named Zi Nan Dan, also called Middle Light Firm; the Lower Original Dan Field Palace three cun below the navel, its spirit the Infant, named Yuan Yang Chang, also called Dark Valley Below. These three are the one spirit.

When restraining and controlling the souls and po spirits, first inwardly call their names, imagining the three spirits all jade coloured and golden shining, with the appearance of infants; the upper and middle original palaces wear red, the lower original wears yellow; their heads are like newly born infants. When practising the Dao and circulating breath, one also inwardly calls these names.

The Life Gate is the navel; the Mysterious Pass is the passage of the birthing intestines. Within it is the Life Palace, inside which is the Great Lord named Tao Kang, styled He Yan, wearing vermilion robes and a crown of purple lotus, sitting at the Life Gate, attended by the three souls’ spirits. The Great Lord always holds the Celestial Emperor’s symbol talisman, to unify and regulate the original qi, repair the fetus and return to the embryo. At evening rest, first close breath for twenty-four counts, then inwardly pray the Great Lord’s name three times, then swallow liquid fifty times, then knock teeth three times, softly praying:

‘Fetal spirit great god,  
August thread heavenly lord,  
Holding the embryo talisman,  
Crowned with purple crown,  
Turning yellow and red,  
Ascending essence to the life gate,  
Transform spirit return to birth,  
Six harmonies mutually cause,  
Form and body shining bright,  
Jade maiden dwelling in body.’

When finished, if constantly practised for eighteen years, the Great Lord will be able to stimulate the three fields on the left, govern the three qi on the right, transform the fields into flying ascent, transform the qi into the mysterious dragon, commanding the twenty-four gods above, and managing the souls and spirits below. Summoning the six yang officials and the six yin officials, a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders ascend to heaven by day, all through the influence of Lord Tao.

Great Tenuity Heavenly Emperor Lord’s Celestial Emperor’s Symbol Talisman

Also called Imperial Lord Nine Extreme Original Five Pass Eight Intervals Talisman. When performing rites and prayers in a separate chamber, one must first write this talisman, put it in a brocade bag, wear it, and then proceed.

On the right, the Celestial Emperor’s Symbol Talisman is given to the Life Palace Great Lord Tao Kang He Yan, to unite the original upper qi and regulate the embryo’s circulation. Written in vermilion on blue paper on the day of the new moon or full moon at midnight, face north and take it, holding the talisman with the left hand, closing breath, and praying:

‘Heavenly Emperor mysterious book,  
August symbol spiritual talisman,  
To unite original qi,  
Regulate embryo circulate essence,  
Ten thousand years infant,  
Flying immortal heavenly pivot,  
Life palace great lord,  
Dressed in cinnabar and vermilion,  
Crowned with purple lotus,  
In league with me.’

When done, swallow it, then rise and bow twice. When swallowing the talisman, do so in the posture of rest.

If a Daoist has the method of returning essence, turning yellow to red, morning essence pouring into life, regulating fluids and moistening liquid, so that man and woman share the cinnabar, face born with jade brightness, he must know the essential name of the Great Lord and wear the symbol talisman to be without old age. If one only practices but does not know the spirit names, returns essence but does not wear this talisman, nor hears the prayers and instructions, nor understands where the palace mansions reside, then though one attain the age of a thousand years, one will return to corpse under the Great Yin, merely accumulating years of life, and must return the bones to the Three Officials. When the Daoist rests at night, he should always keep the Great Lord in mind as part of the prayers; on new and full moons wear the talisman to regulate the benefit of the embryo’s essence. Thus he also becomes an immortal, and need not trouble with the arts of supplementing the man and woman.

Yet those who govern women in order to take flight, and circulate qi to seek heavenly immortals, are more violent than water and fire, killing more swiftly than axe and hatchet; unless one is of resigned heart embracing unity, it is difficult to succeed and avoid loss with this. Those of middling ability might practice this, as if swallowing a sword yet desiring to swallow without harm to the throat, perhaps it may be obtained.

The Life Palace Great God Lord forbids men to eat raw blood, forbids burning the hair of six domestic animals, forbids burning gourd, garlic, peels, and leaves, and all kinds of foul meats; all these damage and confuse the embryo qi, foul and injure the infant spirit. Be cautious.
