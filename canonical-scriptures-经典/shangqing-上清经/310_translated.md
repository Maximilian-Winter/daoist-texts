### White Feather Black Wing Spirit Flying Jade Talisman

The Primordial Parents of the Nine Heavens, the Grand Elder of Great Perfection, together feasted aboard the carriage of the Dragon of Brightness, accompanied by myriad true ones from the Mulberry Grove, flying immortals and giant dragons, controlling the chariot of revolving lightning and swift smoke; their bodies moved in accord with the Dao, their mouths chanting sacred texts, roaming the cave of the Mysterious Hill of Ease, resting at the edge of the Clear Waves, wandering the pavilion of the Purple Void, pausing at the brink of Boundless Expanse. At that time the Heavenly Origin shone bright, the Five Dawns returned their radiance, the Three Pure Ones drifted like clouds, purple smoke exhaled fragrance, flying scents encircled the sun, perfumes diffused through the Great Nothingness, brilliant light intermingled and shone, the Three Candles united in brightness, the firm truths were sealed on high; they chewed on the root of the sun, feasted on profound essence of the void, spreading open the luminous golden edicts, sounding the nine subtle harmonies, their spirits flowing with the cnu blades, all jade. The pavilion was the wondrous thought responding to the Great Silence, inner contemplation opening by Nature. At the dawn of the first year of the Ming Emperor of the Highest Sovereign, on the third day of the third month, the Primordial One awakened, suddenly bringing down the mysterious spirit in the white luan’s chariot, the black-winged phoenix bearing the pure edict in its beak, the Flying Feather Scripture ascending to the sky, stepping the void with true art; jade spirit flying immortals guiding the smoke, the host of gods guarding the spirit, alighting above the nine heavens; radiantly resplendent in the Jade Void court, descending to the Grand Elder of Great Perfection, mysteriously bestowing the precious scripture. On that day the Grand Elder was withdrawing from his fasting of Shangqing; at that time the Supreme Emperor, the Three Pure Lords of Purple Tenuity, the Heavenly Emperor, the Heavenly Emperor of Taiwei, and the Most High Jade Emperor, all guests, descended and took their seats, burning incense of a hundred harmonies, placing the five-colored divine officials’ floating signs on jade thrones, arranging seats in the Purple Palace, the assembly of true ones performed rites to the scripture, revolving three times; the Three Pure Lords rose, facing west, emitting the sound of profound clarity, chanting the Celebratory True Feather Chapter, in praise of the Divine Scripture. Its words were:

The pavilion of vast emptiness,  
Spirit wind scatters rare fragrance.  
Rustling is the mysterious light above,  
Gentle breeze fans the sun’s wings.  
Pure luan swiftly flying phoenix,  
In beak carrying the divine feather scroll.  
Fluttering soaring through the nine heavens,  
Sorrowful cries calling the mysterious beam.  
Mysterious secrets ride the void,  
Pure governance of the endless Dao.  
All true ones universally celebrate,  
Bowing their heads to the Jade Emperor.

When the chanting was complete, the Heavenly Emperor arose, facing north, and recited:

The mysterious phoenix swiftly wings the clouds,  
White startled, joy hesitates.  
Flying fragrance blends with bright flowers,  
Flowing light shines on the clouded thoroughfares.  
Gigantic dragon reins the long bridle,  
Flying immortals mutually support.  
Myriad true ones celebrate auspiciousness,  
Joyful phoenix wandering the void.  
Primordial One originally without trace,  
Mysterious sensation seeks itself.  
Beating wings need not the carriage,  
Floating drifting rides the smoke.  
Precious edicts weave the profound thread,  
Five bodies govern the spirit talisman.  
Praise and celebration uphold the blessed court,  
Incense revolving three times each.

When the chanting was done, the Heavenly Emperor of the East rose, and recited:

Pure feathers spotted with mysterious wings,  
Riding floating falling, turning in cycles.  
Flowing fragrance overflows the ten heavens,  
Fragrant herbs abound in Taiwei.  
Spirit edicts open subtle mechanisms,  
Feather scripture shines with mysterious radiance.  
The supreme Dao originally without hiding,  
Holding truth and scene, it flies by itself.

When the chanting concluded, the Grand Elder donned the ritual robe, crowned with the highest heavenly measure of the Three Treasures jade crown, clad in the seamless nine-colored flying light feather edict, left side hung with tinkling bells, right side bound with the seven origins, prostrating facing due south. The Heavenly Emperor of Taiwei arose, ordering the Feather Immortal attendant to hold aloft the golden altar, requesting the scripture; he knelt long facing north to present it to the Grand Elder; all the immortals acclaimed the goodness thereof. The Grand Elder stood to receive the scripture, his face emitting golden light, and from his five limbs naturally arose the Spirit Flying Jade Talisman. He ascended, taking the host of true ones, together mounting the white luan’s chariot, riding the black-winged phoenix, to feast in the Eternal Yang.

To the east the elevated forest and jade waters’ realm, the ruins of Fusang and mouths of nine springs; to the west the region of mysterious feathers and white fields, the banks of Mengsi; southward to the Vermilion Mound and the essence of extreme flame, the city of Southern Xia; northward to the dark Yin cave mysteries, the land of cold waters; centrally the tenfold plateau, yellow vapors, yang essence of the great mystery, Jade Capital, golden terrace, jade chambers, cinnabar palace, roaming the ten heavens, the eight domains of pure caves. He commands myriad true ones; no heaven unconnected, no darkness unrelated, no breath ungoverned, no immortal unabsorbed; universally governing the host of gods, from heaven below, none fail to model virtue on the Grand Elder, revering the Feather Scripture. Thus the emperors float in the mysterious palaces, the scripture passing through seven thousand kalpas, transmitted to the Supreme Great Dao Lord.

In all practices of preserving and contemplating the Way of the Seven Stars, upon entering the chamber one first wears the five talismans, then writes them. Upon writing and wearing, all face east, knock teeth twelve times, and look upward, chanting:

Mysterious void, purple clarity,  
Flying Feather Scripture,  
Above reflects rosy clouds,  
Below controls myriad spirits,  
Governing the Six Jia,  
Moving my form,  
Flying steps to Heavenly Origin,  
Raising the Dipper essence,  
Condensing soul and fixing spirit,  
Filling within abundantly,  
Going out to the void entering the mystery,  
Ever living with the breath.

When complete, wear the talisman, write it on the heart, then proceed with affairs. Thus for nine years, one may succeed in riding the void and commanding clouds, flying through the Great Clarity.

The Left and Right Spirit Flying Jade Talismans arise from the essence of Nature, mysteriously bestowed by the Grand Elder for ascending the void and stepping the empty space, riding the sovereign and threading the seven mysteries, ascending the Jade Clarity Way, to prepare the Flying Feather Scripture. Those who obtain it are immortals; those who wear it become perfected true ones; those who cultivate it cause the white luan’s chariot and black-winged phoenix to come to welcome their person, ascending to the Jade Palace, and feasting in the Eternal Yang. The Supreme Great Dao Lord transmits it to the Upper Primordial Great Element Lord, the Heavenly Emperor of Taiwei, to practice the Dao and perfect it, secreted in the Palace of the Supreme Spiritual Capital. According to the rule, it is transmitted once every three thousand years, not to be lightly disclosed; to reveal the heavenly truth is to violate the covenant and break the oath, bringing punishment from the ghost officers and calamity to the Nine Ancestors, forever sealing the dark springs.
