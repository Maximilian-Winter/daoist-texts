## Preface to the Supreme Purity Great Cavern True Scripture  
By Master Guan Miao, Twenty-Third Generation Patriarch of Maoshan Supreme Purity, Zhu Ziying

The Dao is born from the void; it conceals myriad spirits and is unfathomable. The spirit condenses within emptiness; it manifests myriad transformations without form. It is dark and profound with essence, calm and settled whilst emitting light. The Great Mystery is boundless and attains the void whilst guarding stillness; is this not called the Great Cavern? When its essence is gathered and its spirit concentrated, it governs the primordial qi to revolve and circulate; it refines the spirit to assemble with the Dao, directing auspicious winds to stir and dance. From nothing suddenly comes something; breathing disperses the forms of myriad spirits; movement reaches its utmost and returns to stillness; indistinctly it encloses the marvel of the One Emperor—this is called the Returning Wind Mixed Unity. It is the root universally planted by Heaven and Earth, the origin of creation by the Emperors and Sages. Man’s life receives qi from the Great Ultimate, and his movement and stillness follow the model of Heaven and Earth; his spirit begins from the one origin, and his entire body is governed by Yin and Yang. Therefore, the Thirty-Nine Imperial Emperors of Supreme Purity turn the true (essence) and descend to reflect, entering the thirty-nine mansions within the corporeal form; each thus issues forth a chapter of the scripture. Their words are profound and recondite, serving to govern and include the myriad spirits, to summon true wizards and repel the false. This is what is called the auspicious clouds opening the gate of life, and propitious smoke sealing the door of death. Hence the Central Yellow Elder Elemental Dao Sovereign comprehends the profound purpose of those arrayed saints, compiling the Great Cavern True Scripture; therefore it is called the Scripture of Thirty-Nine Chapters. There are also the Returning Wind Emperor One, the High Origin Heroic One, and the Five Elders Female One; these three scriptures serve to assist the revered scripture of the Thirty-Nine Chapters. The Dao has three marvels: the first marvel is the Great Cavern True Scripture of Thirty-Nine Chapters; the second marvel is the Treasure Scripture of the Five Elders Female One; the third marvel is the Simple Spirit Great Abundance Marvelous Scripture. Thus the Thirty-Nine Chapters are the secret formulas of the Nine Heavens, the chief scripture of the Supreme Origin Great Element Sovereign’s Golden Book. It is also called the Three Heavens Dragon Book, and the Nine Heavens Supreme True Dao Scripture. The composition of this scripture was gathered by the Primordial Heavenly King from the mysterious ten directions and the qi of origin. The Queen Mother of the West received the Dao from the Primordial Heavenly King, and together they engraved the Northern Origin Heavenly Central Record, the Naxie Kingdom, the Spirit Mirror Mountain of Man and Bird, and the Jilai Mountain Hollow. Within the empty chamber, they gathered the Nine Mysterious Correct One qi, binding it into the book, a foot in diameter, which remains extant to this day. The Primordial Heavenly King further transmitted it to the Supreme Purity Eight True Central Yellow Elder Sovereign, to instruct the lower regions to produce true men ascending the Three Stars. The Central Yellow Elder Sovereign concealed this scripture; no one in the world knew it. Therefore, upon the earth among the Five Sacred Mountains and in the heavens, this scripture was never found. It is a treasured secret of the Supreme Purity Celestial Truth; only the Great Mystery possesses a golden pavilion, jade name, precious scripts, purple slips, the Three Origins have combined morning secret registers, and the Dan Platform bears yellow characters; only those who are true men may receive it. This scripture is the standard of the Way of the Supreme Emperor, the wondrous chapters of the Violet Morning, setting the ranks of the Nine Heavens, summoning the spirits of the Five Emperors, escaping the Returning Wind’s mixed unity, condensing the nine revolutions in the mysterious essence, interchanging male and female, mixing myriad spirits, solemn and obscure, jade sounds of the Supreme Truth, operating the repelling of falsehood in the bright beam, communicating the changes within the mysterious gate, penetrating virtue to produce marvels, cleansing and shining to reflect the clouds. The Great Han is the spirit gate’s qi; without cutting it is the year of the great calamity; the lofty pavilion of spirits, the abyss of myriad true beings, the golden chamber brilliant and resplendent, majestic is the Supreme Purity. Its purpose is subtle and difficult to fathom. Zhaoneng (the recipient) fasted long and renounced human desires, chanting the jade chapters in the curved chamber, striking the jade sounds to shake the spirits; then the true men fixed the registers in the Eastern Flower, the seven mysteries further polished in the purple chamber, controlling the demon kings to awe spirits, and commanding the Five Emperors to protect the body. After myriad cycles, the physical body flies; after seven turns, summoning the life controller arrives. These are the marvels of the Great Cavern chapters, embracing myriad ways and returning to birth, free from strange hairs or strange forms; golden bones and jade names must not be rashly disclosed in the spiritual texts, and all prohibitions are according to the Nine True Bright Ordinances. Zhaoneng was to fast three years before being permitted to read it.

Reciting this chapter ten thousand times, when completed, the Central Yellow Elder Dao Sovereign ascended to report it, and the Highest One ordered the Dan Storm Green Canopy Car, the Nine Spirits Envoys and Supreme Yi Life Controller, to come greet at the hour of the Rat. Then the Five Elders winged the carriage, the Eight Winds fanned with feathers, the divine thunder marched before, the Jade Splendour supported the axle, riding clouds and driving dragons, ascending to heaven that day, proceeding to the Great Element Three Origins Sovereign’s palace to receive the book. This is called ascending to the Supreme Purity, receiving the Great Ultimate book, and saluting as the Left Minister of the High Immortals. If Zhaoneng had this scripture but was not permitted to read it, the Celestial Emperor of the Supreme Microcosm would draw forth the death slips, and at the beginning of imparting the scripture would issue the true registers; at the commencement of the fasting would register the Great Ultimate, inscribe the name Eastern Flower, report to the Highest One, record and seal at the Turtle Platform; myriad spirits and thousands of souls would declare Zhaoneng as the Nine Mysterious Grand Doctor, his rank equal to the Supreme Clarity Immortal Elder. The qualifications for receiving the scripture follow the Nine True Bright Ordinances, which Zhaoneng should faithfully observe.
