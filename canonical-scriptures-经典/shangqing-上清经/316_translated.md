# The Supreme Clarity Most High Jade Morning Phoenix Terrace Qu Su Most High Scripture

Title of Scripture: The Supreme Clarity Most High Jade Morning Phoenix Terrace Qu Su Most High Scripture. The compiler is unknown; it is roughly ascribed to the Eastern Jin. This is an important early scripture of the Supreme Clarity school. One scroll. Source edition: The Orthodox Daoist Canon, Zhengyi section.

### The Supreme Clarity Most High Jade Morning Phoenix Terrace Qu Su Most High Scripture

The Most High Jade Morning Phoenix Terrace Qu Su Scripture is formed by the Nine Curved Mounds of the Mysterious Capital and the Phoenix Terrace, wherein the natural phoenix qi is condensed and formed. The jade chamber is situated above the Nine Heavens, on the sunny side of the Jade Capital, where the void produces the eight assemblages to intersect the true qi; the ten foldings and nine bends penetrate and reach the eight directions, summoning the soaring feathers of support and ascent, connecting with the spiritual essences of the eight simples, condensing the nine origins and the true unity of one, thereby forming the words of joy and sorrow, manifest upon the Mysterious Terrace. The characters are square, one zhang in size; the writings are brilliant and splendid, illuminating the Nine Heavens; the flying phoenixes cover the clouds; the purple qi is dense and obscure; swimming fish and running beasts interlace and speed about; six leading lions are complete at the lower gate; the five emperors and jade immortals hold the five-coloured banners of commanding spirits to awe and govern the five directions; on the right attend the jade maidens of Taihua; on the left guard the golden immortals and jade youths, each three thousand attendants bearing the scriptures and incense. The sun and moon shine beside, the seven origins revolve with spiritual power, the three mornings align in splendour, the mysterious light is clear and bright; the jade forest shakes its branches, the jade sounds stir the court, the seven treasures shine in splendour, radiating onto Supreme Clarity; this is the rule of the Most High Jade Morning Supreme Dao Sovereign. The Mysterious Capital Elder transmitted the phoenix script true book of sorrow and joy to the Dao Sovereign.

Thus the myriad spirits of the Highest Heaven and the flying immortals of the Five Mountains, all ascend the Phoenix Terrace thrice a month on the fifth, fifteenth, and twenty-fifth days, with solemn rites and fragrant wanderings, reciting the words of sorrow and joy. The upper blessings of the divine spirits, the lower pity for the signified people; their words are subtle and ethereal, jade-clear and thoroughly pure; the four perfect ones kneel, myriad immortals pay homage with music; the scattered incense rises to the heavens, the drifting smoke fills the empty court. All who have formed themselves into perfected beings within the upper palaces, and those beginning to learn to be immortals, none fail to diligently cultivate the phoenix qi of the Nine Heavens, the Mysterious Hill True Book, and recite the melodies of sorrow and joy. The ancient mystery is transmitted once in ten thousand kalpas; today there are those who have heard it thrice within seven hundred years. Having obtained its writing, one flies upon Supreme Clarity, ascends the Nine Curved Phoenix Terrace, and pays homage to the Jade Truth. Lightness dissipates blindness; the seven ancestors fill the charge; with caution one becomes a spirit-immortal. Whoever obtains and wears the Mysterious Hill Supreme True Book and the Five Emperor Commanding Spirit Banner can then govern the void, summon spirits, restrain demons, and command gods. Having the secret Five Elements talisman, one calls the soul and secures the spirit, preserving the spirit’s longevity. Having recited the words of sorrow and joy, one transcends the nine mysteries of the body, wandering tranquilly in the Jade Capital. Wearing the Qu Su Phoenix Qi, one sees the Supreme Peace receiving the holy sovereign, the body ascends the Mysterious Capital, and receives the immortal upper truth.

Thus the Nine Heavens Phoenix Script words of sorrow and joy, the Mysterious Hill Supreme True [Book]^1, all arise from the natural qi of the Nine Heavens. The spiritual writings show marvels within the void and mystery; after ninety thousand kalpas, the Mysterious Capital Elder received them from the Great Void, transmitting to the Most High Supreme Dao Sovereign. The Dao Sovereign transmitted to the Supreme True Person of the Great Ultimate, who handed down to the Eastern Sea’s various palaces’ Green Youth Great Lords, to transmit to Daoist practitioners already bearing jade names, those destined to be spirit-immortal persons. Wearing it for twenty years, one may see the Three Origin Lords, welcoming the holy sovereign to the Golden Gate of Supreme Clarity. Three transmissions in seven hundred years; in a hundred years those who can be instructed may hear two transmissions. Within the fasting chamber one offers the incense of the ritual, summons the gold of five taels, and completes the oath of gold and blue, taking the place of the blood altar covenant.

The Most High Jade Morning Qu Su Sorrow and Joy Wise Words

Eastern Azure Emperor

Condense my natural qi, transform and solidify the Purple Phoenix City. The high terrace surpasses the Nine Ridges, the mounds layer luxuriant flying jade. Brilliant joy rises above the void, winding bends penetrate the eight pure [realms]. The purple void shines on the cloud palace, streaming brilliance veils the five spirits. Extending freely to boundless fields, the eight qi revolve in perfect brightness. Support and ascend, moving the great void, the seven scenes turn the celestial scripture. Movements come as if rootless, departing at times following transformation and decline. The nine encircling traversals within, the two images mutually contend. Emperor One firmly holds the central origin, the four bonds unbroken and spiritual. South gathers the flying imperial fruit, north draws the vast cold court. The mysterious chamber intersects true assemblies, void songs arise naturally. The Five Emperors command the spirit banners, waving flags to conquer myriad spirits. Demons howl from the void; Dao rules, joy is unending. Thus arise the Qu Su words, celebrating the gods rejoicing in great peace. Together they contract what measure? Ten thousand kalpas as one lifetime. Revolving ninety thousand kalpas, journeying together on the purple phoenix palanquin. The void produces the Purple Phoenix Terrace, jade towers join the Great Subtle. The spiritual wind penetrates the eight assemblies, the northern window opens the palace gates. Above is the howling song-child, constantly chanting the loss and decline. In the morning one rides the scene to wander, at evening one returns attached to the scene. Two scenes unite as one body, fearing to lose the scene’s radiance. The nine-five do not constantly dwell, heaven and earth incline and threaten. The great kalpa ends with one springtree, one hundred and sixty cycles revolve. The flood springs surge over nine ridges, a great bird soars the sky and descends. Myriads of creeping things drift long streams, looking to mountains but finding no support. Their cries reach the endless edge, can one not feel sorrow in the heart? Worthy sages diligently recite the scripture, thus able to ride the scene and fly. At the appointed time they accompany to welcome, assembling at the Nine Heavens gate. The number ends at the golden horse star, myriad diseases cross and race. No learning immortals are seen, only heard are the mournful cries of corpses. Alas this foolish man’s nature, holding fate with pain and grief.

Southern Red Emperor

Disperse sorrow on the Nine Mysteries Terrace, gather joy on the steps of the great void. Carry the contracts of the ten true ones, howling commands of the Eastern Sea youths. Reach the four directions, eight assemblies of qi, interweaving winds of the Lang Terrace. Eyes bright at the western splendid hall, intentions united with the vast cold palace. Dancing beneath the Purple Phoenix, desolate are the nine ridge peaks. Flowing glances over boundless fields, gazing upward amid kalpa mountains. Clear songs of palace tones in harmony, sorrow and joy mutually follow. The two courses harmonize into one contract, principles reversed yet returning the same. Together joy is unending, holding start and holding end. Sweetly drink jade pool sweet wine, looking up to rejoice with the flying imperial. The divine melon can naturally soothe, yet not like the light of sun and moon. The seven luminaries flow with fragrant radiance, this joy can hardly be forgotten. The great kalpa has an ending cycle, the cycle passes with two images inclining. Dragon gates sever the celestial river, three and five oppose each other. The red seat holds the eastern well, the splendid canopy hides the morning star. Mysterious light darkens the eight wildernesses, foul qi veils the heavenly essence. The three officials hasten their work, the five mountains no longer hold spirit. Myriad diseases crisscross and race, the northern emperor leads brave demon troops. Eight nets spread beyond the heavens, the sage ruler cannot purify them. This condenses the natural qi, rising mound of the nine layered city. The high observatory pities myriad beings, sorrow and joy arise from this. Mysterious songs disperse the divine collar, masking joy yet tears fall. Mourn these stubborn fellows, stingy with wealth and entangled in lust. Joyfully awaiting fate’s arrival, not regarding the calamities that ensnare. Worthy and wise come from afar, morning and night diligently reciting scripture. Rituals voidly contemplate mystery and emptiness, to pass unending lifetimes. If one can seek the source of the Way, the eight sections rhythm jade names. One will avoid the nine calamities and disasters, and see great peace.

Western White Emperor

Jade phoenix thickens the morning gale, the purple terrace shines on jade forest. Streaming light brushes the great mystery, towering surpassing the nine shades. Purple scene disperses red clouds, flying smoke mutually seeks. Seven treasures shake jade branches, spiritual beasts gallop among cloud peaks. Myriad immortals ride the void singing, divine wind raises wondrous sounds. Above is the high morning master, bowing silent, howling and chanting. The eight assemblies naturally harmonize, descending fragrance all orchids and gold. Jade chewing the kalpa dawn, jade broth scatters upon the heart. Bright pearls sing spiritual songs, law’s form harmonizes with the clear zither. Jade writings reach the Daoist ancestor, sorrow and joy unravel the collar. Dispelling our endless lifespan, what good joy is so profound? Without lofty immortal airs, how can one share this drink? Morning sport at the Eastern Splendour Palace, evening wander the Western Splendour Hall. Taking pleasure in the two splendid halls, not meeting with joy. Only hearing the mysterious songster, mournful voice pierces heavenly youths. Mournful sounds flow to the cold court, mourning the world’s fate exhausted. Heavenly horses leap the nine rivers, crow mothers ride flying dragons. The mysterious ford has no bridge, two qi separated and not communicating. Ascend my layered terrace, gaze upward amid the nine calamities. Foul qi fills the three spirits, myriad beings bear disasters and conflicts. The eight regions leave no people, great and small mountains collapse. Reflect on this, ignorant of learning, hearing scripture as if deaf and blind. Letting nature take its course, suddenly awaiting fate’s end. Alas how cruel is this date, thoughts of you wound my chest.

Northern Black Emperor

Purple phoenix rides the void forth, rising layered nine mysterious heights. Qi condensed shows shadow, qi scattered spirit disappears. Fluttering limitless, heavenly music suits my delight. How can it accord with the eight assemblies’ song, matching my lofty immortal district? Breaking contracts of ten true ones, calming my nine phoenix drives. Ascend the jade capital gate, descend to play Langfeng province. Feathered riders swift on jade wheels, purple smoke support each other in the void. Extreme morning again awaits dawn, accompanying joy without end or rest. Flowing glances let fate change, one hundred million kalpas form one cycle. Delight my natural collar, disperse my worldly cares. Without mysterious spiritual substance, who can share this journey? Alas within the empty hall, joy arises again then sorrow. Morning ascends the Eastern Meng Ridge, evening views the Western Ridge Hill. No seeing the Nine Spirit Mothers, seeking the Northern True Dao. Wide inquiries of great images’ measure, two qi suddenly circle clouds. Nine dragons move the eastern well, heavenly horses set off western heights. The Northern Emperor dispatches heavenly troops, five mountains receive mysterious accord. Myriad demons already bound and girded, five elements early in counsel. Battle disasters spread through the heavens, myriad beings already restrained. Above and below all accept assembly, sweeping away false and not lingering. Alas within the five calamities, fate comes without kinship or estrangement. High ascends the eight assembly palace, condensing my darkness among fields. Surveying the highest learners, blessed lands mutually support. Abandoning home to seek my Way, able to cross and pass your body. Diligently cultivate the supreme scripture, Dao attained shall surely answer. Leisurely viewing the Phoenix Terrace, is it not joyful to wander?

Central Yellow Emperor

Great joy gathering the central origin, central origin gathers joy in the court. Above is the eight assembly qi, dancing the purple phoenix born. Golden branches cling to jade root, seven treasures form shining bells. Dragons surpass the extreme ridge peak, phoenix howls startling ten thousand li. No seeing scattered guests wandering, only hearing wind and cloud sounds. Palace tones harmonize one another, sounds and echoes mutually complete. Mysterious songs sing wondrous melodies, sorrow and joy form the scripture. I and myself mutually seek, who knows the true spirit of the perfected? Brocade clouds gird the night moon, purple radiance obscures flying jade. Three mornings penetrate great brightness, seven origins shine five stars. Spirit banners have mighty light, flowing smoke thick purple and clear. Claiming to be the Western Splendour marvel, not like the Purple Phoenix City. Above is the collar-relieving person, one face rejoicing ten thousand ages. Accompanying joy without end kalpas, thereby perceiving heaven and earth incline. Spirit movement has its record, numbers end and freely return to mystery. Coming and going following fate’s cycle, why cause sorrow to arise? Dispersing sorrow beyond eight wildernesses, great images not crooked or true. Leisurely joyous court, who would make sorrow a friend? The five calamities are constant assembly, the harm injures itself. Although palace tones are not harmonious, the great return to principle itself is balanced. Thus arise the sorrow and joy melodies, to pass the learning of Dao and body. If practicing to research the spiritual writings, wondrous meanings shall be clear. But wearing the Qu Su seal, one may enter the sorrowless ferry. Riding the void, ascending the Phoenix Terrace, high observatory receiving the Tang years. What joy then shall be joy, knowing where sorrow lies between.

The Most High Jade Morning Sorrow and Joy Melodies arise in the void upon the Phoenix Terrace. The spiritual brilliance shines in the five directions; the golden sounds float clear in the ten heavens. The Jade Capital Nine Curves Supreme True all are cast in gold as slips; purple brush writes the text, voices join in harmony singing mysterious songs of sorrow and joy. Their words are profound and deep, wondrous interest penetrating the abyss; if not a peer of the Most High, none can exhaust their chapters. There is a golden seal called Eastern Splendour, writing characters of the Phoenix Gate; only then may one see this writing. Those who wear the phoenix qi Mysterious Hill True Book and command the spirit banner, reciting the sorrow and joy melodies, then the Five Emperors guard the true, heavenly demons teach protection, supporting and recommending the upper immortals, receiving and welcoming the holy sovereign within the Supreme Clarity palace, wandering the halls of the Phoenix Terrace.

All who receive this writing, on their natal day, the year’s grand cycle, the eight seasonal divisions, and on each month’s fifth, fifteenth, and twenty-fifth day, bathe and fast and enter the chamber, first facing east recite the Azure Emperor’s melody, then bow and pay homage to the Jade Truth; turning south recite the Red Emperor’s melody, then bow to the Jade Truth; turning west recite the White Emperor’s melody, then bow to the Jade Truth; turning north recite the Black Emperor’s melody, then bow to the Jade Truth; [turning to the year governor recite the Yellow Emperor’s melody, then bow to the Jade Truth]. When the five directions are complete, return facing north and perform nine bows, paying homage to the Jade Morning Lord, swallowing qi nine times and ceasing. Thus all apply the Five Emperor banners on the five directions within the chamber.

The Five Emperor Commanding Spirit Banners

The Most High Jade Morning Commanding Spirit Banner governs the eastern Azure Emperor Commanding Spirit Great King, all protecting and bearing certain mountain master Wang Jia, true body joined with immortal, commanding up and down sending the Eastern Mountain immortal official feather wheels, receiving and welcoming Wang Jia’s body ascending to the Jade Pure Palace Purple Phoenix Terrace, as in the Nine Heavens’ trust.

On the right, blue writing on yellow silk above.

Thus the Most High Five Emperor Commanding Spirit Banners are naturally produced atop the Phoenix Terrace, under the governance of the Five Emperor Jade Truths. Those with bone and fate joined with immortal, Eastern Splendour uses these writings to inform the Five Emperor Demon Kings and support them, dispatching immortal officials of the Five Mountains with thousands of chariots and myriad riders flying feather wheels to receive and welcome ascent to the Purple Phoenix Jade Terrace. Those who obtain and wear this writing have their names recorded by the Five Emperors, heavenly demons respectfully guard, the Ten Realms manage their reception; in nine years spiritual descent is obtained, riding feather wheels to ascend. Men who receive it must cast a letter on a high peak; women must perform a spirit crossing ritual. Thus all descend in ten years; men again cast letters; women again perform the Mysterious Hill Supreme True Book phoenix qi ritual; all in similar textual rites.

The Most High Qu Su Five Elements Secret Talisman

Composed by Great Ultimate Left Immortal Lord

The Most High announces to the Later Sage Golden Gate Emperor Lord: Primordial qi is divided and distinguished, heaven and earth open, yin and yang connect positions, three and five Dog palaces, mysteriously set the six jia, transforming and producing the five elements metal wood water fire earth, governing the central origin, generating by qi, mixed and formed as true. Later learners seeking immortality do not know the source, vainly labouring with thought, wasting and exhausting form and spirit, accumulating but without response, hoping for the Dao but lost and faint. One who would seek the root must return to the source; losing the root to seek life, one cannot be complete. Therefore I have compiled the Supreme Emperor Jade Text to reveal and inform; you choose the worthy and transmit. Its method is a precious secret; hope it is not in words; you may follow the clear ritual, inherit and uphold it.

The Most High said: The Five Elements secret text arises with heaven and earth, mixing and transforming myriad spirits, governing all gods and spirits. If heaven lacks the five elements, the three lights will not shine clearly; if earth lacks the five elements, mountains and hills collapse; if man lacks the five elements, the body decays and dissolves. Therefore the five elements mix and mutually sustain. If one has determination and heart, one should seek the true names. Having received its method, heaven and earth have the same root; call the soul and summon the spirit, preserve life and control spirits. Cultivate for nine years, carve and ascend as upper immortal.

Those who receive the Qu Su secret words, learning the way of the supreme truth, should know the inner secret of the Five Elements Parent True Lords, preserving to summon souls, summoning to govern spirits; soul and spirit long remain, true gods all return to the palace, fully guarding the form and body, able to return to nature. Thus one may daily wander tranquilly in the Jade Pure, united with qi as true.
