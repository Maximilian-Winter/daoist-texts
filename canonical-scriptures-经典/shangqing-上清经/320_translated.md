### The Great Cavern Jade Scripture Method of Ingesting the Breath of the Mysterious Root

The method of ingesting the breath of the mysterious root makes the human body clear and radiant,  
The spirit and mind eight-wise,  
The body has sun reflection,  
The face has jade luster,  
The eyes produce bright light,  
The teeth contain purple breath,  
Firm intestines splendidly stored,  
Long life and broad vision.  
Take and breathe morning liquid,  
Suspend grain and cease grains,  
The way’s essence in golden liquid,  
The affairs wondrous in watery jade,  
It is called the natural great harmony of breathing out and in,  
Ruling the nine spirits of essence.  
The use of the Way esteems naturalness,  
The stillness of virtue honours tranquillity and joy.  
Gathering naturalness to manifest truth,  
Embracing calm vastness to correct right and wrong,  
Then transgressions do not arise,  
Harm is extinguished spontaneously.  
This and the three five seven nine breaths may be called the essential aim of the Way.

When resting lying down before arising,  
Keep in the mouth a white breath,  
As large as the yolk of a chicken’s egg,  
Outside the yolk five coloured breaths,  
Five coloured breaths turning naturally,  
Congealed overflowing outside the yellow,  
By and by must fill the heart and mouth,  
Called the three five seven nine day-son mysterious root breath.  
Within the human heart stomach mouth is a woman like the form of an infant,  
Without clothes, standing straight in the stomach canal,  
Mouth open facing the entrance of the stomach canal,  
Called the Nine Heavens Mysterious Maiden,  
Receiving and pouring soul liquid,  
Looking upward humming inside the mouth at the yolk of the five breaths.  
Constantly rinse and fill the mouth inside, outside, up and down,  
With the tongue revolve to absorb day breath five-coloured saliva,  
Fill the mouth and swallow it, causing the saliva liquid to enter the maiden’s mouth.  
Thus five times, completed, then knock teeth three times, softly chant:

Jade Pure High Supreme,  
Nine Heavens Nine Spirits,  
Govern in profound mystery,  
Descending into pure stomach,  
Golden harmony jade reflection,  
First from emptiness born,  
Called Pure Ring,  
Character named Brilliant Essence,  
Refine soul restrain spirit,  
Heart opens spirit bright,  
Take and eat day-son,  
Golden splendour fully fills.

After a while, all is complete;  
With hands wipe both eyes and eyebrows,  
Then with both hands wipe each other,  
Thoroughly rub between face, brows, eyes,  
Temples and skin,  
Slightly causing warmth,  
Making the stage fragrant and steaming.  
This is the Supreme's method of taking the three five seven nine day-son mysterious root.

### The Ode of Lady Ziwei Wang

Feasting and gazing at the Great Rosy Palace,  
Golden towers shining purple pure.  
Immortal chambers reflecting Great Simplicity,  
Four pavilions all vermilion jade.  
Casting wheel of empty cavern ford,  
Total reins dancing green carriage.  
Jade splendour flying cloud canopy,  
Western consort wields brocade banner.  
Suddenly, at dust impure boundary,  
Swiftly arriving at the fair maiden’s courtyard.  
Former feelings respond in due time,  
What is attained already in the dark.  
Riding wind ascending the nine heavens,  
Together drink cinnabar splendour infant.  
Turning from world’s common things,  
How know the empty cavern spirit?  
North ascend mysterious dark pass,  
Hand in hand bind high net.  
Incense smoke disperses eight scenes,  
Mysterious wind drums crimson waves.  
Looking up surpass coral ford,  
Looking down return mountain heights.  
Jade whistle sings upon clouds,  
Phoenix cries cave nine distant.  
Riding breath floating great void,  
Why should one tread mountains and rivers?  
Golden tally commands feather spirits,  
Conquer mountains crush high demons.  
Rinse draw circle morning brightness,  
Accumulate tree square infant teeth.  
Confused and competing in the midst,  
Do not understand what can be done.

The Scripture of the Inner Names of the Hundred Spirits, Invoked by the Supreme Emperor of the Nine Heavens of Shangqing.
