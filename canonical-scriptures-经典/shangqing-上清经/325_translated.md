# The Scripture of the Three Primes Jade Inspection and Three Primes Dispersion of Shangqing

Title of the Scripture: The Scripture of the Three Primes Jade Inspection and Three Primes Dispersion of Shangqing. The author is unknown; it is roughly ascribed to the Eastern Jin dynasty. It is an important scripture of the early Shangqing school. One scroll. The base text is taken from the section of Dongxuan in the Zhengtong Daozang.

### The Scripture of the Three Primes Jade Inspection and Three Primes Dispersion of Shangqing

The High Shang Dispersion Scripture is the book of the Three Celestial Primes of Shangqing, the treatise of the Jade Inspection of the Perfected One flying in the void, the Great Register of Heaven of the Upper Prime Inspection, the Jade Script of Earth of the Lower Prime Inspection, and the Scripture of the Immortal Perfected One of the Central Prime Inspection. Such precious texts, the High Shang carved in gold-alchemical script, placed in a packet of natural cloud brocade, sealed with the seal of the Three Primes Treasure Spirits, and stored in the Palace of Great Possession above the Nine Heavens, in the Golden Terrace Jade Chamber of the Nine-bent Alchemical Room. The Lord of the Southern Pole Upper Prime presides, with seven hundred Jade Maidens of the Upper Prime Vermilion Palace attending, guarded by the Divine Perfected Hearted Supreme One and three hundred Spirit-Void Jade Youths, who hold scarves and scatter incense. In the first year of Pure Void, the Primordial Heavenly King taught beneath the Pavilion of Bright Clouds and the Sky Room of Great Radiance, instructing the Three Celestial Jade Youths, commanding the three Daoist divisions, overseeing ten thousand immortals. According to the regulations of the Great Perfected One, seven thousand years of transmission have made one a Perfected One; no one may rashly open the spiritual writing except by engraving the mysterious diagrams and recording them before birth. The High Shang assists the Perfected Ones with the divine soldiers of the Five Emperors; inspection is strict against negligence, and the prohibitions are most severe. The Supreme Dao Lord received it from the Ancient Mysterious Master, transmitting it to the Immortal King of the Mysterious Capital; the Western Queen Mother received it from the King of the Nine Heavens, transmitting it to the Great Emperor of Fusang; the Great Emperor transmitted it to the Later Sage Golden Gate Emperor; and the Golden Gate Emperor transmitted it to the Supreme Chancellor Azure Youth Lord. Now one copy is stored in the Eastern Flower Palace, to be transmitted according to the regulations over seven thousand years to complete the Perfected One. The Supreme Dao Lord commands the Five Elder Immortal Capitals to inscribe the talismans of the Four Extremities and the Five Emperors, to assist and guard the spiritual writings, inspecting against leakage. Those who speak falsely on the chapters are punished with the Wind Blade; those who lightly transmit or delay are charged by the Seven Ancestors, burdened with examination, and consigned to long servitude under the ghost officials.

The Three Primes chapter says: The writings of Jade Inspection arise from the Nine Mysterious Void Caverns; they bind the qi of nature to form jade characters. The Nine Heavens divide and adjudicate; the Three Daoist paths manifest clearly; the Three Primes distribute qi, inspecting and governing the Three Perfected Ones. Without this writing, the Three Luminaries grow dim, the Five Emperors are misplaced, the Nine Cycles are reversed, and the Seven Mansions pursue their essences in disorder. Without this writing, the Nine Earths sink into abyss, the Five Mountains collapse, and rivers and hills overturn. Without learning this writing, the Immortal Officers do not descend, the Earth Officials do not operate, no celestial names are recorded above the Nine Heavens, and learning is in vain; the Dao cannot be accomplished. Its method is subtle and wonderful; the secret chapters of the Three Primes — he who obtains their writing is elevated in rank to Immortal Minister.

The Upper Prime Jade Inspection Great Register of Heaven contains all the mysterious texts of the Nine Heavens' distributed qi and diagrams, with the official titles of the Nine Heavens controlling the Perfected Ones. To have its complete writing is to obtain the freedom to roam above the Nine Heavens and to share longevity equal to the kalpa. To see its chapters is to know the celestial names of the Nine Heavens, revolving through birth palaces, transforming and becoming immortal anew. Constant cultivation for nine years leads to receiving and welcoming the Holy Lord in the Shangqing Palace.

The Lower Prime Jade Inspection Earth Jade Script consists of all the mysterious writing of the Nine Heavens' distributed qi, inspecting the spirits of the Nine Earths. To obtain its writing is to be able to fly through the vast space; the Nine Yin dare not seize the soul of the mortal; one roams the Five Mountains, treads rivers and sources; myriad spirits bow in homage, and ten thousand gods attend in welcome. To see its chapters is to transform to ascend the Nine Heavens, revolve the wheel of rebirth, and become immortal through nine transformations. To cultivate the Dao for nine years is to enter water without sinking, enter fire without burning; the Three Primes descend, and one ascends to heaven in broad daylight.

The Central Prime Jade Inspection Scripture of the Immortal Perfected Ones is all secret writing of the Nine Heavens, the seal of the immortal orders. To have its complete writing is for the immortal officers to attend the court, descending to bestow divine mushrooms and natural spiritual medicines. Cultivating the Dao for nine years, heavenly immortals descend as perfected; earthly immortals descend as spirits; flying immortals descend by sedan chair, riding the void in flight, ascending to Jade Clarity. To see its chapters is to know the celestial names of the Nine Heavens, revolve birth palaces, and transform to become immortal again.

The Three Primes chapter says: Without learning the writings of Jade Inspection, the spiritual officers of the Nine Earths do not come to revere and welcome; the mountain and sea spirit officers do not protect the body form; the heavenly immortals, earthly immortals, and flying immortals of the Five Mountains do not descend by cloud sedan; celestial names are not led above the Nine Heavens. Without chanting the jade chapters, heaven does not send down perfected ones; myriad demons invade the light; seeking flight one falls to sinking. Wearing the Jade Inspection, the Three Primes in perfect rotation, one emerges from emptiness into void, transformations without interval, walking on water and treading fire, soaring through the Nine Mysterious, the body penetrating the purple void, the spirit reflecting the golden countenance, seventy-two aspects brightly shining in the great void, presiding over the Three Heavens, commanding all immortals. Therefore, unless one is already a Perfected One, one must not lightly transmit.

Upper Prime Jade Inspection Great Register of Heaven

The Shangqing Jade Radiance Elixir Spirit Cave Heaven Upper Prime Three Primes Jade Inspection Text was given to the Shangqing Perfected Ones to wear for roaming the Heavens, to inspect and govern the vast space, commanding the host of perfected beings. To possess this writing is to have rank equal to spiritual immortals, with all heavens revering and protecting, the Five Emperors overseeing reception, and nine years later to see the Three Primes Lord, to be presented before the Shangqing Palace.

Upon receiving this writing, one fasts for nine days, writing in blue brush on nine chi of yellow silk, offering it at the mountain of one’s birth, then wearing it. If after nine years one has not ascended, one must again offer sacrifice, casting the writing into blue smoke in the heavens, thus receiving from the Shangqing Jade Radiance Palace a five-coloured cloud chariot, to escort and receive the wearer.

In the first year of Pure Void, in the year of Gengyin, on the ninth day of the ninth month, the Primordial Heavenly King, during the pure fast at Shangqing Palace, declared the covenant of the Supreme, the Pinnacleless, the Formless and No-sight, the Formless and Nameless, without ancestor or clan, the Infinite Cave Clear Nine Mysteries of Nature for innumerable kalpas, transmitting the Three Primes Jade Inspection writing to the Three Celestial Jade Youths, who were to entrust later disciples bearing mysterious names, those to be perfected of Shangqing, fixed in the Alchemical Terrace Golden Treasury Jade Register, purple writing and jade slips, to welcome the Holy Lord flying to the Shangqing Palace, looking down and up to the clearest of the natural officers of Shangqing, attending the Perfected Ones, inspecting the heavens and summoning immortals, controlling demons and employing spirits, descending cloud chariots to escort certain designated persons, all as in the Great Perfected Nine Heavens covenant text.

The above Upper Prime Jade Inspection Great Register of Heaven writing, written with blue brush on nine chi of yellow silk, to be worn. The writing must be offered at the mountain of one’s birth, to sacrifice to the Perfected Ones, report to the Nine Mysteries, covenant with the Five Spirits, then wear it. If after nine years the Dao has not descended, one must copy two copies, according to the method ascend the mountain, offer sacrifice again and complete, then burn them; ashes scattered in blue smoke in the heavens, one copy buried deeply nine chi at the mountain of one’s birth. This is called reporting above to the Nine Heavens, below to the Five Sacred Mountains, and in the middle to myriad gods, to obtain eternal life.

Lower Prime Jade Inspection Earth Jade Script

The above Three Primes Mysterious Terrace Jade Inspection Purple Writing, also called the Nine Heavens Perfected Book Primordial Inspect Earth Register, also called Three Primes Tiger Script, also called Flying Heaven Upper Perfected, is to inform the six heavens myriad spirits, to regulate mountains and rivers, and to inspect the spirits of the Nine Earths. Wearing the writing commands nine thousand jade maidens, peacefully receiving the Holy Lord at the Shangqing Palace. The recipient writes with yellow brush on blue silk, sacrifices at the mountain of one’s birth, then wears it. If after nine years one has not ascended to heaven, one must write again one copy to burn, scattering ashes in blue smoke to the heavens; and another copy to bury at the mountain of one’s birth, three chi deep. Wearing the writing, one may roam the eight directions, cross the Five Mountains, tread river sources; regulate earth spirits, command myriad gods, and after nine years take the three prime chariots to ascend to the palaces of the Three Primes. One must not rashly enter places of pollution or touch the Perfected Ones; lightly reporting or proclaiming is punished by the Seven Ancestors, one’s body perishes and one loses immortality.

Central Prime Jade Inspection Scripture of the Immortal Perfected Ones

The Scripture of the Immortal Perfected Ones, also called the Great Perfected Yin-Yang Spiritual Record Three Primes Chapter, is the secret writing of the Three Heavens Nine Spirits Supreme Subtlety. Heaven and earth endure great kalpas, the scripture for eight thousand kalpas; its writing reveals the Three Primes Mysterious Terrace, directly corresponding to three hundred persons and ninety-one jade maidens. The wearer’s form and spirit all receive the title of natural jade immortal. Without this writing, the form and spirit do not transform, the defiled soul wanders; wandering without rest, spirit mingles with evil; spirit mingling with evil brings the time of decay. Without transformation of form and spirit, one cannot summon immortal officers, nor command the Perfected Ones, even chanting ten thousand times the jade chapters. Ten thousand chants contain the hidden names of the myriad spirits of the Nine Heavens’ Great Perfected; chanting them alarms the Nine Heavens, binding all immortals. Without the Scripture of Immortal Inspection, and lightly commanding immortal officers, shaking the Nine Heavens, immortals do not descend, heaven does not accept the sound, souls fly and spirits scatter, the spirit is startled and qi flees, dwellings shake and collapse, infants are disturbed and lost, heavenly demons cause calamity, the body becomes ashes and perishes. One who learns this scripture does not cultivate but becomes immortal; in times of peace the Holy Lord is welcomed at Shangqing Palace. Without mysterious diagrams and imperial slips, engraving the alchemical writing, one may not rashly disclose the precious text; lightly leaking it is charged by the Seven Ancestors, closing the ghost officials, one’s body and life lost, one cannot become immortal again.

The Scripture of the Supreme Perfected Three Primes Immortal Qi Nine Spirits Secret Characters, from the Western Sand Direction Terrace, is the text received by the Southern Pole Upper Prime; the Yellow Upper Perfected assists the Heavenly Prime in inspecting the immortal souls. To obtain this writing is to have the immortal officers attend the court; within a hundred days of entering the chamber of thought, one sees the Upper Prime Lord and is granted the true book, naturally flying to Shangqing Palace. Without this writing, one cannot practice the immortal way nor summon the perfected; the body suffers calamity.

The Profound Supreme Birth True Inspect Immortal Qi Three Primes Great Declaration Purple Writing is the secret scripture in the Three Primes Terrace. Wearing it and entering the chamber to contemplate true spirit for ninety days, defiled qi dissipates; then one sees the Three Primes Great Lord, who grants the true book; after nine years one may fly in the void. Without this writing, one cannot practice the immortal way or summon immortal officers; the body suffers calamity.

The High Shang Supreme Birth True Book Inspect Immortal Qi Purple Micro Mysterious Palace Flying Perfected Writing, enduring heaven and earth’s great kalpas, is found in the chamber of the Five Mountains. Those who possess it enter the chamber to contemplate the Three Primes for one hundred days, spirit and thought without disturbance; then one sees the true god descend in human form, able to command immortal officers, taking things of nature. Be cautious in treading the pond of life and death. Without this writing, one cannot practice the immortal way; lightly summoning Perfected Ones, one perishes without becoming immortal.

The Lord forbids all True Men of the Heavens from chanting the upper books of the Nine Heavens without possessing this writing; offenders are punished with the Nine Heavens Stabbing Accusation. Those who possess it, the Prime Minister of the Nine Heavens summons the Inspect Heaven Prime Commander to regulate immortal officers; with one year of refined contemplation, one may see the Nine Heavens True King, or see one person with nine heads, riding a nine-coloured phoenix, descending in human form. Do not fear when seen; this Nine Heavens True King presides over the Perfected Ones’ records. Prostrate facing south, humbly supplicate immortality, and one will surely be granted the book of the Nine Heavens.

This writing must not be lightly chanted as the thirty-nine chapters of the Great Cave True Scripture. Offenders are charged by the Seven Ancestors, their bodies punished by the Nine Heavens Stabbing Accusation; they shall perish within a hundred days.

The High Shang Profound Micro Jade Inspection Three Primes Writing is engraved in the North Chamber of the Spirit Capital, a heavenly book of jade characters one zhang square, corresponding directly to seven hundred persons and eighty-two jade maidens. Wearing this writing, after one hundred days of refined contemplation, the Three Primes descend the chamber; one naturally knows the sounds of the heavens. Without this writing, one may not rashly practice the flying immortal way; the body suffers calamity, the Seven Ancestors charge and one loses immortal rank.

The Purple Micro Mysterious Palace Flying Heaven Inspection Writing is engraved on the platform of the morning ascent, illuminating the palace above the Nine Heavens and the Supreme Clarity Upper Palace. The Primordial Heavenly King granted it to the Western Queen Mother, summoning the spirit officers of the Five Mountains, Mountains and Seas. With pure heart and quiet thought, after one hundred days one sees the god, and knows the hidden name of the Nine Heavens. The wearer commands immortal officers. Without this writing, one may not chant to dispel demons the upper scriptures; the body suffers great calamity; be cautious, be cautious.

The Supreme Flying Heaven Central Scripture Inspect Immortal Writing is engraved on the Three Primes Terrace, issued by the Wanshi Master to transmit to the High Shang person, to summon immortals and bring forth truth. The recipient sacrifices at the Five Mountains, contemplates for one hundred days, sees a figure with three heads, descending to the chamber. Without this writing, one may not rashly perform seeking immortality on the eight seasonal days; the body suffers calamity. Wearing it, the god and perfected communicate, granting twelve jade youths; the recital is heard throughout the Nine Heavens. Light leakage is charged by the Seven Ancestors, ordering the Five Mountains to test demons and spirits, judging guilty souls.

The above Nine Heavens Dragon Book Three Primes Void Cavern Jade Inspection Flying Mysterious Text is engraved at the gate of the Three Passes of the Nine Heavens, prohibiting True Men of the Heavens. Chanting the upper books of the Nine Heavens without complete possession of this writing is punished by the Nine Heavens Stabbing Accusation. Those who possess it, the Prime Minister of the Nine Heavens summons the Inspect Heaven Prime Commander to regulate immortal officers; with one year of refined contemplation, one may see the Nine Heavens True King, or see a person with nine heads riding a nine-coloured phoenix, descending in human form. Do not fear; this Nine Heavens True King presides over the Perfected Ones’ records. Prostrate facing south, humbly supplicate immortality, and one will surely be granted the book of the Nine Heavens. Without this writing, one may not lightly chant the thirty-nine chapters of the Great Cave True Scripture; offenders are charged by the Seven Ancestors, their bodies punished by the Nine Heavens Stabbing Accusation; they shall perish within a hundred days.

The Primordial Profound Void Flying Heaven Central Scripture Three Primes Jade Inspection Writing was engraved by the Primordial Heavenly King on the Golden Wall Terrace, passed down through ten thousand kalpas. To see this writing is to have the Four Extremities write their names on the Eastern Flower. Wearing it and contemplating for three hundred days, with eyes not turning elsewhere and mind without other thoughts, one will see the Primordial Heavenly King. Seeing the Primordial Heavenly King brings longevity of ten thousand years.

Without this writing, one may not enter the famed mountains, roam the Five Mountains, or practice the flying immortal way. The Five Mountains will not accept; human and demon will attack the body; calamity is certain.

The Great Perfected Golden Scripture of the Nine Heavens Upper Void Secret Writing is written on the Phoenix Birth Platform of the Nine Heavens Parents, corresponding directly to eight hundred persons; after nine thousand years, the Nine Heavens open once; when the Nine Heavens open, the nine suns brighten the east. This writing naturally reveals itself to the attained. Above the Southern Veranda, if one has the mysterious name imperial register, the Four Perfected also descend and grant to the designated body. Having this writing, after nine hundred days of refined contemplation and steady mind, one may see the Nine Heavens Parents. Seeing the Nine Heavens Parents removes death and disappearance. Without this writing, lightly practicing the Way ten thousand times, summoning immortals and perfected, the body must suffer calamity; the Seven Ancestors charge and employ one, no longer becoming immortal.

The Year, Month, and Day, some mountain Perfected One of some rank, from master some rank, make oath to receive the writing and now ascend the Mysterious Altar, reporting to heaven to be granted. Some mountain master some rank, closing the Five Emperors, Five Mountains, Three Officials, Nine Palaces, Upper Perfected, and Four Departments, upholding the prohibition of the writing, as in the Great Perfected regulations, forbidding leakage in the covenant. Wearing it and roaming all heavens, all lands, all waters, and famous mountains, all natural heavenly officers without number, none do not reverently welcome it, extinguishing demons and summoning immortals, flying in the vast space, welcoming the Holy Lord at the Shangqing Palace. The Nine Heavens shall receive the writing of the Nine Heavens some rank. Light negligence of the heavenly writing, rash leakage and telling others, some rank shall be charged by the Seven Ancestors and long punished by ghost officials; the body suffers the Wind Blade test, death burdened with the Nine Origins’ service, and dares not claim immortality.

The writings are all on yellow silk, written in blue brush, bordered with vermilion brush on four sides, being the precious secret of the Perfected Ones. The recipient fasts seventy days, or twenty-seven days, or seven days. Disciples bring five taels of gold, ninety chi of phoenix pattern gauze, and thirty-two chi of green silk, proceed with the master to ascend the mountain of birth, receive the Three Primes writing, seating northward, offering incense, vegetables, cakes, and fruits on a large plate, nine sheng of pure oil arranged with nine lamps, arrayed in one seat with scarlet gauze five chi wide to place the writing separately and respectfully in the center, also placing one tablet as proof to the east. The disciple faces west and prostrates, the master faces north and knocks teeth thirty-six times, pronouncing:

"Today I report above, the Perfected Ones scatter spirits, eight scenes wander, nine emperors attend the court, the Three Primes loosen their belts, the upper pass of the Three Pure Ones. This day is fully prosperous, all wishes are auspicious. I respectfully ascend the mysterious mountain, report and covenant with the Five Spirits, offer fruits to summon the True, to manifest utmost sincerity. The Four Departments and Five Emperors observe my utmost sincerity, report my brief writing, to be heard above in the clear heights, to receive divine truth, and fly into the imperial court."

Finished, one swallow thirty-six breaths, heart bows to the Five Directions, then facing north, long kneeling reports:

"Nine Heavens Vast Space Great Void Profound Spirit High Upper Primordial Dao Lord, Shangqing Jade Emperor and many Holy Great Immortal Spirit Officers overseeing True Perfect Immortals of the Four Departments and Emperors, I formerly followed master Zhongyue Master Zhang, received the Three Primes Jade Inspection Secret and Firm Spiritual Chapters, dare not lightly declare; the Nine Five hasten, the spirit movement renews; the Holy Lord arrives at the seat, selecting imperial ministers to supply the Perfected Ones. Now there is some mountain master of certain rank, with sincere and quiet heart, seeking immortality, accumulated but not descended; now with high aspiration, making solemn oath to receive the precious chapters, humbly hoping the immortals will at once grant passage, as in the Great Perfected covenant, heavenly immortals descend, watching over the designated person’s body, cultivating to thoroughness, that the Dao may be true, flying in mystery and void, ascending to the Three Pure Ones. Rashly leaking or telling others violates heavenly writing; one is charged by Seven Ancestors, closes the underworld, thousands of kalpas no remission, body perishes to ghost officials, dares not be immortal again."

Finished, the master reads the writing, rises and stands, holding the writing in left hand, disciple long kneels, right hand receives the writing; both point with remaining hand to the northwest corner of heaven, disciple raises face and prays:

"Report above to Nine Voids, vow to Five Spirits, receive heavenly writing, dare not violate covenant, rash leakage and exposure, doubting the Perfected Ones, life and death parents, Seven Ancestors and root seed, and body long perish; all bear the River Source, Three Paths and Five Pains, innumerable kalpas dare not complain."

Finished, then depart.

The Way of the Eight Assemblies of the Three Primes Jade Inspection is the hidden writing of the Vast Space and the secret mystery of the Nine Heavens, the wondrous chapters of Shangqing, extinguishing heavenly demons in prayers, summoning jade immortals in nature. Those who learn its method, their actions conform to truth, their bodies born of water and fire, transformations manifold, their thoughts attained to thoroughness, the Three Primes descend their forms. Those who have no jade writing are like trees without roots, vainly diligent, weary in body and spirit, the Perfected Ones do not descend, the body does not form immortality. Light chanting of the precious scriptures alarms the Nine Heavens, and the Stabbing Accusation tests, calamity destroys the destined body. Therefore heaven has the ceremony of looking up and down; the scriptures have the order of classes, mutually controlling and restraining, upper and lower balanced, qi complete, thus responding to nature. The Three Primes are the sovereign lords; the Five Emperors are the officials of correction and punishment; forbidding light learning, incomplete heavenly writing, correcting leakage, punishing with the Wind Blade, the duel of life and death. Cultivate carefully, as in the High Shang Way, it is easy to become divine immortal, but if rashly exceeding heavenly writing, one offends the laws and incurs punishment, calamity and examination. All arise from shallow and narrow learning, not reaching the origin of the Way; empty body summons truth, how can truth descend? If the Way does not descend, heavenly demons ride the void. Therefore one should seek broadly, inquire at famous mountains, try myriad tests without retreat, endure nine hardships with special diligence, then only may one enter the heavenly writing and be worthy to become a Four Extremities Perfected One, mysteriously granted precious writing, complete qi and form immortality. But to meet only one scroll and sit listening, hoping for a Perfected One in a single word, is like comparing the scales beneath the abyss to the ends of the nine skies; such learning is truly wearisome.

The Southern Pole Upper Prime Treasure Secret Jade Inspection writing, without golden bones or jade marrow, mysterious name imperial diagrams, one cannot see its chapters. Even if leakage occurs and is gained by the vulgar, it lasts no more than a hundred days before heavenly disaster punishes and the scripture perishes of itself. If the fate meets a spiritual master, ascends the covenant and is granted, yet does not follow the time limit and rashly reveals it to others, the Seven Ancestors examine the root seed; the body bears the Wind Blade punishment. If within a hundred years one has a learned Perfected One wearing and cultivating the scripture but has not seen this writing, if two transmit it, they must first ascend the spiritual mountain, report and covenant with the Nine Heavens, then listen to be shown the jade writing. One must not be without declaration and oath, and lightly leak the utmost truth; the Five Emperors divine soldiers will strike, capturing the Seven Ancestors in hell, destroying one’s body with the Three Officials, punishing the Three Disciples with carrying stones, adding the Five Pains on the Knife Mountain. If one does not care about calamity and fortune, one will have no trouble seeking immortality.

The Azure Youth Lord says: All the upper books of the Nine Heavens, the regulations of the Great Perfected, their prohibitions and punishments are all of one rank, especially the partial treasure of the Three Primes Jade Inspection writings. Yet the Jade Inspection writings contain the official titles of the Nine Heavens, inspecting and regulating immortal qi, the root of myriad roots; how could they not be secret? Later disciples all have the ambition and aspiration to seek the Superior Immortal, and to copy and treasure their writings, to preserve the pure and true earnest words; yet not following the tradition, will this not be of their own appointment?

Wearing the Jade Inspection writing and entering the chamber to contemplate the Three Primes Lord, at first, one may not immediately see the Three Primes Lord, but may see strange lights and other-formed spirits appearing before the eyes; this is not strange, as they are the Perfected Ones testing the disciple.

If one closes the eyes and sees blue and purple two-coloured light faintly descending, this is the constant intestine blue true jade void qi, the official title of the Supreme Primordial Lord of the Void. The adept must draw in qi eighty-one times, and pray thus:

"Heavenly Perfected descends, Dao qi bright, paying homage to the Three Primes, ascending Jade Clarity, mounting the Mysterious Terrace, observing divine form, receiving secret titles, feather garments born, myriad immortals come to welcome, flying in the imperial court."

Finished thus, after three hundred days one may see the true form of the Supreme Primordial Lord.

If one sees red and profound two lights vigorously descending, this is the lesser yang Upper Perfected Clear Void qi, the official title of the Purple Primordial Lord of the Void. The adept must draw in qi sixty-four times, and pray:

"Flying heaven descends, returning to jade truth, entering purple clarity, paying homage to the Upper Immortal, attending the Three Primes, summoning myriad gods, seeing their form, receiving precious words; my Dao is complete, ascending the Nine Heavens."

Finished thus, after three hundred days one may see the true form of the Purple Primordial Lord.

If one sees yellow and white two colours dense and descending, this is the central yellow profound true great void qi, the official title of the Yellow Primordial Lord of the Void. The adept must draw in qi thirty-six times, and pray:

"Midheaven wanders, three qi accompany, mysterious mother mingles, scattering spirits of Purple Micro, yellow and white differentiate; my Dao returns; cinnabar and jade chariots carry, conveying me to ascend, to the Vermilion Chamber, the Three Primes shine together."

Finished, after three hundred days one may see the true form of the Yellow Primordial Lord.

If one sees confused colours, the light without fixed colour, vigorously descending, this is the profound yin void qi, the official title of the White Primordial Lord of the Void. The adept must draw in qi twenty-four times, and pray:

"Three qi change, five colours flowing yellow, pure radiance disperses truth, mingling Central Prime, coming to descend my chamber; my Dao is bright and clear, looking upward,

divine countenance, like orchid and like cloud, enabling my Dao complete, ascending Jade Gate, paying homage to true form, the Three Primes Lord."

Finished, after three hundred days one may see the true form of the White Primordial Lord.

If one sees a nine-coloured phoenix, or one phoenix with nine heads, this is the official of the Nine Heavens Mysterious Mother, descending to the designated body; the Dao desires completion. Be cautious not to speak, knock teeth nine times, swallow breath nine times, and pray:

"Heaven descends, earth sustains, two qi join truth, three five mingle, together forming my body, six qi celebrate, myriad wishes open, enjoying infinity, the utmost Dao arrives, attaining to ride dragon and phoenix, guiding the purple smoke, flying to Shangqing, Jade Void as neighbour."

Finished, bow nine times and stop. Within nine hundred days, refined contemplation without weariness, one may see the Mysterious Mother’s true form, meet the Perfected One, and live without end.

If one sees light bright as the sun and moon, this is the official of the Nine Heavens Primordial Father, descending to the designated body; the Dao desires completion. Be cautious not to speak, knock teeth twelve times, swallow breath twelve times, and pray:

"Profound qi scatters truth, transformation without rule, heaven joins earth, void reflects vast space, distant spirit descends, united with origin mingling, eight scenes link covenant, nine emperors form alliance, attaining sight of the Upper Perfected, paying homage to the Vermilion Chamber, long preserving heaven and earth, endless through kalpas."

Finished, bow nine times and stop. After nine hundred days, refined contemplation without change, one may see the Primordial Father in the designated chamber.

If one sees a person with nine heads, or wearing nine-coloured spotted robes, this is the official of the Nine Heavens True King who presides over the Upper Perfected Mysterious Reflection, descending to the designated body; the Dao desires completion. Be cautious not to speak, knock teeth nine times, swallow breath three times and stop. Pray:

"Nine Heavens Upper Spirit, essence of the Primordial Sovereign, three harmonies nine transformations, refining the embryo infant, returning truth to primordial chaos, void descends my form, gathering my death root, extending my longevity, attaining unity with heaven and earth, enjoying everlasting years."

Finished, bow nine times and stop. Within seven hundred days one may see the Nine Heavens True King face to face, speaking together, able to fly above the Nine Heavens.

If one sees a dragon-headed phoenix-bodied person, or one crow with nine heads, this is the Left Ruler of the Primordial Heavenly King’s Mysterious Reflection Upper Perfected official, descending to the designated body; the Dao desires completion. Be cautious not to speak, knock teeth nine times, swallow breath thirty-two times, and secretly pray:

"The Three Dao proceed in order, Primordial Wanders, Mysterious Truth shines bright, Nine Spirits scatter, flowing gazes unending, descending my radiance, draping vermilion splendor, unbinding detentions and clearing heart, able to ride flying rosy clouds, soaring to purple micro."

Finished, bow three times and stop. After three hundred days one may see the Primordial Heavenly King’s true form, granted the Nine Heavens upper books, flying in Jade Clarity.

If one sees a figure with three heads, or a person holding a five-coloured banner, this is the chief registrar of the Five Mountains Immortal Elders, inspecting the disciple’s cultivation. When seeing, only maintain right heart and thought; do not lose correctness. Knock teeth three times, secretly pray:

"Profound and profound black and dark, spirit of the Five Emperors, righteous qi descends, to grant me immortality; my immortality comes from truth, no truth none before; I cultivate the jade writing, inspecting and governing the Nine Heavens, reporting above to the Primordial, universally commanding famed mountains, all spirits come to guard my pavilion, enabling me to fly and ascend to the imperial court."

Finished, draw qi five times and stop. After one hundred days, the Immortal Elder descends in form; one may reach the designated chamber. On the eight seasonal days ascending the mountain, the Five Mountains announce the designated name at the Eastern Flower Palace; after nine years one naturally becomes immortal.

If one sees an old man with a yellow kerchief on his head, yellow clothes, sometimes girded with ribbons, holding a knife, or a nine-jointed staff, this is the great demon of the central heaven, or king of the spirit mountains, coming to test the disciple. Do not fear, face north with right heart, knock left teeth thirty-six times, secretly pray:

"Heaven burns, heaven burns, heaven’s hall, North Feng unrestrained,

mocking my heavenly writing, the Three Dao stray, six evils ride the void, already reported to the Northern Emperor, capturing ghost schemes, dazzling flow bells, Jade Inspection heavenly talisman, divine perfected summoned, cutting and exterminating without remainder, urgent as my life, no idle nor staying."

Stop, then with both hands twist the two back ear gates, thirty-six breaths stop. Thus entering the mountain and cultivating, heavenly demons and mountain spirits all perish beneath the verbal prayers, no more interference in testing. The true immortal officers will naturally descend; without delay one becomes immortal.

If one sees an old woman, with white kerchief on head, yellow mantle and purple skirt, this is the Yin official of North Feng, chief of great demons.

If one sees a maiden about twenty years old, hair in three-cornered chignon, wearing five-coloured clothes, holding a golden halberd, this is the daughter of the North Feng capital emperor, also testing the disciple’s truth. One should knock teeth thirty-two times, secretly pray:

"Flying imperial yin ring, receiving birth in six heavens, transforming qi and receiving spirit, counting methods for a hundred years, three generations following each other, pure and clear all move, why alone do you lie hidden in the world? Yesterday by imperial command, inspecting and checking delay, quickly depart without staying; may you briefly petition, separately reporting to North Feng, capturing and sending away demon body."

Stop, then with both hands twist the two back ear gates swiftly, drawing qi thirty-six breaths and stop. Thus practicing the Dao to seek immortality, myriad demons perish the trials, heavenly essence is destroyed, the Dao accomplishes itself. Within a hundred days, heavenly perfected may descend and converse with spirit. Many thus close eyes in contemplation and see them; some see face to face after a hundred days; some see them sleeping or dreaming; without aspiration and sincerity, one does not meet truth and see them. Having the method of resemblance, within nine years all see the true spirits. Having seen the true spirit, one at once ascends to heaven in broad daylight.

Those who only close eyes, knock teeth, and contemplate spirit qi without knowing the form of light and shape and colour, and the true or false forms, labor in vain and suffer hardship, never sensing the truth. Seeing truth yet not knowing to summon spirit, seeing false yet not knowing to destroy demon, how can truth descend, how can demon vanish? As the Queen Mother has the record of the Western Turtle, the old abode of myriad spirits’ forms and myriad truths’ light; if the learner does not see this, how can attainment be had?

For storing thought and summoning spirit, without the method of inner observation, the Perfected Ones cannot immediately descend; those sincerely and earnestly touching the truth all have officials of mysterious reflection who open their channels; this is the way to attain truth. If the body is defiled or the learning incomplete in qi, heavenly demons and mountain spirits all first test and defeat. Having this test but not knowing the method to destroy curses, immortality is unattainable. This method of destroying curses, practiced within a hundred days, demons all dissipate, truth all descends. This subtle Dao cannot be discussed lightly in writing; lightly revealing these words brings examination and punishment of life and death parents, Seven Ancestors and root seed. Only secrecy and caution bring the Dao to complete the body.

Three Primes Jade Inspection Writing for Casting and Sacrifice

Having received the method for nine years, if the Perfected Ones have not descended, one should according to the old writings write two copies on yellow silk, as for wearing, and sacrifice at the mountain of one’s birth. With incense, vegetables, cakes, and fruits arranged on a single plate, nine sheng of pure oil arranged with nine lamps, setting up a seat facing north, with scarlet gauze headcloth, placing the writing centrally, writing three slips, placing incense and fruits beneath. The recipient faces north, knocks teeth thirty-six times, and softly prays:

"Supreme Heavenly Spirit, primordial formless, thirty-nine emperors, Five Elders of Shangqing, auspicious day at early dawn, high immortals scatter essence, eight scenes wander, Three Primes swift jade, flowing truth descends, gazing the empty court, designated servant some rank, dare report to the Great Spirit, formerly granted by imperial command, bestowed to me precious scripture, Jade Inspection hidden writing, inner names of the Three Primes, contemplating in seclusion, not yet seeing true form, respectfully ascending the high mountain, arraying records in vermilion and blue, casting writing in the remote mountains, burning incense in the eight netherworlds, Four Departments and Five Emperors, observing my utmost sincerity, reporting my brief writing, above to hear in clear heights, to receive divine truth, flying into the imperial court."

Finished, burn one copy and one slip completely at the altar. With nine kinds of incense combined with oil, pour on fire. The remaining ashes scattered by wind into the blue firmament. When scattering, knock teeth nine times and pray:

"Spirit returns to the Nine Heavens, writing enters the Nine Springs, heard above in Nine Palaces, reported below to River Source, I wear the Three Primes, Jade Inspection hidden writing, spiritual perfected descend, clear and distinct without division, renewing oath to the high void, burning incense to be heard above, Five Spirits appear, Eight Emperors command immortals, descending my flying chariot, speeding my purple smoke, conveying ascent to Vast Void, ascending to imperial dawn."

Finished, again one copy of writing is buried beneath the burnt fire pit, nine chi deep. With a vessel set with incense and fruits to fill above, building level on top. Knock teeth nine times and pray:

"Report above to Nine Heavens, report below to Nine Spirits, Three Officials, Nine Palaces, Twelve Immortal Courts, solemnly bury the jade writing, casting writing into the great dark, enabling my ascent and flight, returning to my form, only awaiting the dragon carriage, to gather in the Purple Court."

Finished, one slip buried on the sunny side of the mountain, one slip buried on the shady side, both nine chi deep. When burying, the sun slip faces south, the shade slip faces north, knock teeth twenty-four times, softly pray:

"Three Pure Ones profound void, Nine Spirits dim and subtle, great kalpa revolving, five degrees pushing on, the Supreme Emperor commands, heaven opens earth, granting me jade writing, commanding myriad affairs, controlling void and summoning emptiness, all perfected return, true immortals not yet descended, Three Primes wander, days go and return, Dao delays, casting writing on mysterious mountain, proclaiming decree to exclude the four, enabling my early ascent, perfected descend with radiance, to ride the eight scenes, ascend purple micro."

Finished, then bury. Both places share this one prayer.

These two copies of writing and casting are for beginners not yet descended Perfected Ones, to be performed once yearly according to time; perfected descend at the sleeping chamber. If one perceives, then one has resemblance and sees spirit; this does not delay the year but ascends; no further casting and offering to the heavenly spirits is needed. Without seeing this method, the Dao cannot be accomplished, spirit cannot descend. This is the foundation of learning. The subtlety of method is only secret and the Dao responds; only careful and true descent; lightly revealing the utmost method invites heavenly examination and punishment.

Purple Void Jade Clarity Profound Void High Emperor Purple Su Upper Prime Great Perfected, some mountain master some rank, named so and so, years about so many, born in a certain month, received the Upper Prime Inspect Heaven writing, beseeching descent of perfected ones, flying to Shangqing, attending Upper Prime, promptly attaining immortality.

Certain year, month, day and time reported.

Written in purple brush on silver slips, length one chi two cun, to be burned.

Purple Void Jade Clarity Profound Origin High Emperor Yellow Su Central Prime Great Perfected, some mountain master some rank, named so and so, years about so many, born in a certain month, received the Central Prime Inspect Immortal writing, beseeching descent of perfected ones, flying to Shangqing, attending Central Prime, promptly attaining immortality.

Certain year, month, day and time reported.

Written in white brush on silver slips, length one chi two cun, buried on shady side of mountain, three chi deep.

Three Primes Jade Slips, heavenly perfected utmost taboo, their use is the foundation of learning immortality; practicing for one hundred days, one immediately sees divine forms; may none fail to respond, none fail to descend, none fail to accomplish. Having obtained this method, one ascends to heaven by broad daylight.

If slips have no silver, then jade; if no jade, then silver or wood may also be used; only wrapped straight and white and clean, no filth remaining, then may it be used.

Formerly Ning Xuanfu received it from the Supreme Perfected One; not ascending heaven for nine years, buried according to writing in White Void Mountain, nine chi in earth. Later disciple Li Zhongjun, passing through the chamber of White Void, fasting purely and contemplating Dao, within a hundred days suddenly saw jade writing silver slips in the White Void rock, seen inside the chamber. Zhongjun ascended and cast a golden and blue oath, knelt and reverenced it for three years; thus induced the Three Primes to descend, extended longevity by seven hundred years. Again he proceeded to Lao Valley Son, received true writing and ascended to heaven. Now one copy is sealed at White Void Mountain. The Primordial Lord at the Vast Space Golden Ridge field granted the Azure Void Perfected One Wang Jun to teach later disciples the bone and form to attain immortality. Those who obtain this method need not study but become immortal.
