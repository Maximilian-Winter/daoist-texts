### The Scripture of the Nine Truths of the Supreme Emperor of Shangqing, Scroll One

**The True Man of Great Emptiness, Southern Peak Immortal, Master Chisongzi’s Transmission**

**The Inner Instructions of the Nine Truths Scripture of the Supreme Emperor**

The Central Yellow Lord (Huanglaojun) is the younger brother of the Supreme Emperor of the Great Microcosm of Heaven. In the second year of the reign of the Clear and Empty Supreme Emperor, he was born from the mingling of chaos; the sun shone with double brightness, lights connected and reflected spirit, five clouds veiled and covered, auspicious smoke darkly suspended. At seven years of age, he already understood the essentials of longevity and the methods of heavenly immortality. Then, with subtle thoughts he meditated on the upper mysteries, reverently receiving the profound truth; his spirit was tranquil and his mind reposed on the source of the gods. He extended his body to the eight extremes, grasped the void and cast his whole self, liberated from the net of patterned decoration, clad in the simplicity of abiding in emptiness, traversing vast and dim waters, exploring profound waves and towering clouds; he gathered the reins to hasten his flight, purified the principle of myriad pathways, radiant with cold wind in wondrous awakening, hiding and soaring through the firmament in circling paths, stirring the original mystery beyond heaven, circulating the nine vital airs at the rosy ford, releasing the elegant rhythm of orchid waves, congealing pure stillness with swirling motion, producing strange sounds and dark echoes; clouds gathered with eight vapours, principles played with the Great Beginning, dark heart and lofty images, rare paths in the ten directions, searching for the subtle spirits and hidden origins, summoning the whirlwind to shake the brush, concealing the subtle and hidden, eyes opened wide to the gate of original mystery, hands spread the court of myriad slumbers, looking up in admiration at the divine artificer, looking down in sorrow at the five calamities, wandering with the master’s covenant, deep and clear in bright opportunity, washing the spirit of change and brilliance, returning thought to true spirit, thus was the heavenly rhythm wondrously manifest, the ancient meeting of profound response. Thereupon the Supreme One bestowed upon him the Scripture of the Nine Truths of the Emperor Lord, the chapters of the eight secret words, to apply in cultivation and attainment; he received the text as the Supreme True Man.

The Supreme True Man has four true men; the Central Yellow Lord dwells at his left, bearing the text of the dragon mystery, the talisman of the divine tiger, wearing a flowing golden bell, holding the purple fur rod, and donning the golden essence cap. Sometimes he supports the morning blossom crown, rides the luxuriant flying dragon, and ascends upon the three pure clouds.

The Eight Secret Words say: "Whoever desires to practice the method of the Nine Truths must maintain long fasts and purify the chamber. Always on the third day of the third month, the fifth day of the fifth month, the ninth day of the ninth month, and on the day of one’s birth, bathe with eastward flowing water and the fragrance of five spices; also on the day of Jiazi at midnight, after bathing, burn incense on left and right, face the day of birth, bow twice, and with a praying heart say:

Supreme High True One, Nine Spirits and Bright Essence, Emperor Lord and Five Spirits, Supreme Unity returning to brightness, make me a flying immortal, ascend the purple court, bathe in the flower pool, body and spirit pure and clear, Peach Lord guards my fate, Emperor Lord returns to the embryonic state, ascend through the Great Void, the five viscera self-generate."

The Supreme One said: "Man merely binds essence and accumulates qi, receives the embryo and collects blood; yellow and white are subtly condensed, cinnabar and purple combine with smoke; thus condensing bones and emitting fluids, scattering and distributing liquids, four times meeting and transforming, nine palaces formed into one knot, the five spirits order the body, Supreme Unity fixes the talismanic register. Suddenly one stands, suddenly one is complete, suddenly one is equipped, suddenly one is born. Thereupon nine spirits enter and rest in their palaces; the five viscera originate in mystery, the five spirits govern them. Parents only know the beginning of birth, but do not perceive the coming of the five spirits of the Emperor Lord within. The human body has a sovereign spirit, its dwelling is not fixed, entering and exiting the three fields above, middle, and below, circulating yin and yang, discarding the old and receiving the new, turning and flourishing, flowing and pouring the primal fluids. The great spirit is born from the void and forms internally to complete the body, irrigating the substance with transformation, changing into light and brightness; it is not like the three souls and seven spirits, but the accumulation of spirit receiving qi, self-generated within the human parents. The Emperor Lord’s nine souls shape-transform in an instant, suddenly becoming sovereign spirits, with nine names, called the Nine True Lords. This is the mingling and transformation of the Supreme Unity Emperor Lord. Divided into upper and lower, it fits the myriad paths. If one can cultivate it, then one passes through water and fire, the five viscera ever live. With long fasting and concealment, one preserves the truth. This text is also called the Inner Instructions of the Nine Truths, also called the Supreme Flying Text, also called the Foreign Release Chapter, also called the Divine Land Spirit Chapter. Though it has four names, it is one precious book.

**The First True Method:** On the birthday in the first month, the days of Jiazi and Jiaxu at dawn, the Emperor Lord Supreme Unity and his five spirits mingle into one great spirit within the heart, called the Lord of Heavenly Essence, also styled Flying Life Upper Hero, appearing like a newly born infant. At dawn on that day, enter the chamber, place hands upon both knees, close breath and eyes and look inward, preserve the Lord of Heavenly Essence seated in the heart, called the Great Spirit. Make the Great Spirit emit purple qi thickly, surrounding the nine layers outside my heart; the qi ascends and rushes into the mud pellet (lower dantian), inside and outside as one. When completed, strike the teeth nine times, swallow saliva nine times, and pray:

Great Lord of Heavenly Essence, Flying Life Upper Hero, Emperor Lord’s inner transformation, come see within the heart, body clothed with vermilion robes, head wrapped in a cinnabar crown, left wears dragon text, right bears tiger pattern, harmonizing essence of three paths, uniting spirit of the upper origin, five spirits attend with talismans, as the Emperor, perfect in all; mouth emits purple glory, nurturing heart and condensing spirit, red store self-generates, obtaining flight to immortality." At midnight perform again as above. This is the natural transformation of the Emperor Lord’s five spirits into the great spirit, so called the one who touches the nodes and follows birth, no longer awaiting signs or thoughts to complete it.

**The Second True Method:** On the birthday in the third month, and on the day of Jiashen at the hour of Chen, the Emperor Lord Supreme Unity with five spirits mingles and transforms within into a great spirit. The great spirit divides form and scatters qi throughout all bone joints, called the Lord of Firm Jade. At that time enter the chamber, hands on knees, close breath and eyes, fix heart inward, preserve the Lord of Firm Jade, styled Condensing Feather Pearl, seated beneath throat and stomach tube; transform white qi to enter the hundred bone joints. Preserve the great spirit emitting white qi, surrounding bones with nine layers, inside and outside thick and dense like smoke of clouds and mist. When completed, strike teeth nine times, swallow saliva nine times, and pray:

Great Lord of Firm Jade, enter my bones, clothed in plain robes, head wrapped in white crown, styled Condensing Feather Pearl, irrigate and nourish the nine gates, left wears dragon text, right bears golden truth, mouth emits white qi, fortify bones and condense sinews, white bones uncorrupted, sinews not erased, hundred joints bloom, make me a flying immortal." At midnight of the time of vitality, perform again. The Nine Truth days, Emperor Lord Supreme Unity and five spirits naturally mingle and form into one great spirit, no longer waiting for signs or thoughts to fix transformation. The appearance is as of a newborn infant; the Nine Truths share the same method. This is the transformation of nine souls and seven spirits into five spirits condensed, the nine changes of the Emperor Lord, the three battles of Supreme Unity holding the talismanic register, fixing the record of profound purity, so that signs ensure longevity and immortality, ascending to the immortal court. This way is secret and mysterious, treasured by the upper spirits. One without immortal registration cannot hear it; one without prior covenant cannot see it. Those who hear and see it respond in life and unite with spirit, hence dark response and auspicious meeting, drawing the craftsman’s mysterious guidance, heavenly spirits come and pass, jade splendour catches sight, thus the Nine Truths are firm in heart and the Eight Paths awaken observation. This is the union of the Three Primes with talismans, beyond what the earth-travelling can hope for. First one must declare the covenant before it is proclaimed.

**The Third True Method:** On the birthday in the fourth month, and on the days of Jiawu and Dingmao at the hour of Si, the Emperor Lord Supreme Unity with five spirits mingles and transforms into a great spirit. The great spirit suddenly divides form again, becoming yellow qi thick and dense, flowing into the vital blood, called the Lord of Primordial Life, styled Yellow Peace Child Profound. At the hour of Si enter chamber, hands on knees, close breath and eyes, look inward, preserve the Lord of Primordial Life, wandering throughout the body’s blood vessels and essence, causing the mouth to emit yellow qi, encircling and fumigating the pores and vessels outside, with nine layers around the whole body, making inside and outside all the same yellow qi. When completed, strike teeth nine times, swallow saliva nine times, and pray:

Great Lord of Primordial Life, together irrigate the blood body, clothed in yellow robes, head wrapped in purple lotus, left wears tiger record, right bears dragon text, feathered robe draped above, majestic and solemn, mouth emits yellow fluid, fortify blood and stabilize emptiness, true qi enters daily, evil qi is dispelled, essence full and liquids overflowing, nine spirits all dwell, make me a flying immortal, heaven and earth in accord." At midnight of vitality perform again.

**The Fourth True Method:** On the day of Jiachen in the sixth month, on the birthday, and on the day of Wuyin at the hour of Wu, the Emperor Lord Supreme Unity and five spirits transform into a great spirit, entering the liver, called the Lord of Azure Brightness, styled Bright Wheel Child. At the hour of Wu enter chamber, hands on knees, close breath and eyes, look inward, preserve the Lord of Azure Brightness seated in the liver, cause the mouth to emit azure qi, encircling the liver with nine layers. When completed, strike teeth nine times, swallow saliva nine times, and pray:

At midnight of vitality perform again.

When completed, strike teeth nine times, swallow saliva nine times, and pray:

Great Lord of Nurturing Light, come enter my spleen, irrigate the three primes, this is the Great Granary, clothed in green robes, head wrapped in lotus crown, left wears jade spirit, right bears awe-inspiring spirit, five spirits wield the axe, seven lightning and nine thunder, mouth emits green glory, nurture spleen and tether soul, yellow store self-generates, ascend to become True Man." At midnight of vitality perform again.

**The Sixth True Method:** On the fifteenth day of the eighth month, on the birthday, and on the day of Gengshen at the hour of Shen, the Emperor Lord Supreme Unity and five spirits mingle and transform into a great spirit in the lung, called the Lord of the Upper Elemental Jade, styled Liangnan Central Child. At that time enter chamber, hands on knees, close breath and eyes, look inward, preserve the Lord of Upper Elemental Jade seated in the lung, cause the mouth to emit five-coloured qi, encircling the lung with nine layers, ascending thoroughly to the mud pellet, inside and outside thick and dense. When completed, strike teeth nine times, swallow saliva nine times, and pray:

Great Lord of the Upper Element, come sit in my lung, three heavens, Liangnan, spiritual glory child, clothed in dragon robes, yellow morning blossom crown, right holds imperial register, Emperor Lord shares the wheel, Supreme Unity holds the map, right holds spirit chapters, left wears mysterious book, right bears tiger pattern, mouth emits five qi." Perform again at the time.

**The Seventh True Method:** On the nineteenth day of the ninth month, on the birthday, and on the day of Wuxu at the hour of You, the Emperor Lord Supreme Unity and five spirits mingle and transform into a great spirit, suddenly dividing form into two spirits, sitting and scattering in the two kidneys, called the Lord of Profound Yang, styled Dark Light Master. At that time enter chamber, hands on knees, close breath and eyes, look inward, preserve the Lord of Profound Yang transforming form and entering the two kidneys, cause the mouth to emit pale qi, encircling the kidneys with nine layers, ascending to the mud pellet, inside and outside thick and dense. When completed, strike teeth nine times, swallow saliva nine times, and pray:

At midnight of vitality perform again.

**The Eighth True Method:** On the twelfth day of the tenth month, on the birthday, and on the day of Xin Si at the hour of Wu, the Emperor Lord Supreme Unity and five spirits mingle and transform into a great spirit in the gall bladder, called the Lord of Contained Radiance, styled Northern Terrace Profound Essence. At that time enter chamber, hands on knees, close breath and eyes, look inward, preserve the Lord of Contained Radiance seated in the gall bladder, cause the mouth to emit five-coloured qi, encircle the gall bladder with nine layers, ascend to the mud pellet, clouds and mist inside and outside, connecting and surrounding thickly. When completed, strike teeth nine times, swallow saliva nine times, and pray:

Great Lord of Contained Radiance, come sit in my gall bladder, clothed in brocade robes, head adorned with purple crown, Northern Terrace Profound Essence, transforming and generating spiritual smoke, left wears divine light, right bears jade truth, mouth emits five qi, nurture gall bladder and strengthen body, Three Fates of the Supreme Emperor join me in kinship, Peach Lord records talisman, Supreme Unity’s seven arrays, harmonize essence and precious blood, regulate fluids and strengthen sinews, make me ascend and become flying immortal, facing north towards the Void Emperor, riding the chariot of the Three Primes." At midnight of vitality perform again.

**The Ninth True Method:** On the twenty-eighth day of the eleventh month, on the birthday, and on the day of Bingzi at the hour of Si, the Emperor Lord Supreme Unity and five spirits mingle and transform into a great spirit in the mud pellet’s purple chamber, called the Supreme Emperor Lord of Prosperity, styled Former Spirit Prime Spring. This spirit is the father and ancestor of the Emperor Lord; thus from the nine transformations of mingling souls, it returns in form to the grandfather, descending to the upper palace. The immortal register is fixed, the cell knot resolved; the cell’s joints cannot be scattered without the grandfather, cannot open root without the father, cannot set the soul right without the Emperor; therefore the grandfather must come to arrange and fix form and spirit for longevity. When the time comes, one bathes, burns incense left and right, enters the chamber and sits peacefully, placing hands on knees, preserving the Supreme Emperor Lord of Prosperity in the mud pellet’s purple chamber; cause the mouth to emit purple qi, encircling the head with nine layers. Then cause the mouth to emit purple qi, encircling the two eyes inside and outside with nine layers. Then cause the mouth to emit purple qi, encircling the tongue with nine layers. Then cause the mouth to emit purple qi, encircling the teeth with nine layers. Altogether four nines, thirty-six layers of circulating qi, making the whole body inside and outside thickly penetrating, like the sun inside the body. When all is completed, strike teeth thirty-six times, swallow saliva thirty-six times, and pray:

Lord of Prosperity Ancestor, Emperor Sovereign Prime Spirit, guards the purple chamber, palace in the mud pellet, yellow gate and golden chamber, mingled into nine souls, souls give birth to myriad transformations, thus becoming Emperor Lord, five spirits attend, seven qi ascend to truth, dragon robes and phoenix capes, purple, emerald, and azure trimmed, hands hold imperial talisman, head wrapped in splendid crown, left wears jade crystal, right bears tiger pattern, seated beneath sun and moon, mouth emits purple smoke, circulating qi through teeth and tongue, morning moistens eyes and lips, issuing cinnabar entering the void, calling souls and summoning spirits, condensing essence and firming embryo, six directions long happiness, ascending to the Great Microcosm, listing and supplementing immortal officials.

Thus the way of the Nine Truths completes within one year. Circling and repeating, the mud pellet governs spirit, eyes bright and whole, five viscera self-generate, blood vessels preserve fluids. If the body has not ascended, and form and spirit all are morning-like, then one should veil the light and show to the common, temporarily enter the Great Yin. The body passes the Three Officials, the Three Officials may not be offended. Then the Nine Truths summon souls, Supreme Unity guards the body, the Three Primes protect qi, Supreme Unity gathers soul, flesh and bones never decay, five viscera do not perish, able to die and to live, able to yin and to yang, pass from void into nothingness, heaven and earth both give birth. Therefore Daoists cultivate purity and quietness to nurture the form, responding and producing the Nine Truths qi. Three Primes fly essence by filling and emptying, Supreme Unity embraces my corpse and returns to substance: subtle and profound, subtle and profound.

Those who constantly cultivate the way of the Nine Truths find all spirits bowing and worshipping, myriad ghosts serving. If passing through Great Yin, then form and body do not decay, five viscera self-generate; counting twenty-four years, life is renewed again. Suddenly awake, fully conscious, clearly recalling the day entering the Great Yin, as if a night’s sleep only. Suddenly one is outside the coffin, brightly seated on the hill and mountain peak; this is the subtle mystery of the Nine Truths, the supreme spirit of the Emperor Lord. Those who practice this way should desire to speak little and quiet the heart, speech not touching death, upright conduct without excess, words not involving desires. Also should cherish qi and nurture spirit, live and rest tranquilly, close breath to the utmost, emit breath to the finest, pass from void into nothingness, continuous without end. This is where the Emperor Lord dwells, where the mysterious mother consorts, by which one may preserve the five spirits and recall the Nine Truths.

**The Precious Talismanic Text of the Nine Truths of the Supreme Emperor Lord of Shangqing**

(The original talisman missing)

This talisman should always be worn with vermilion script on the eight festivals.

The Supreme True Man said: "Always secretly chant it, every new and full moon at dawn and midnight, recite thrice, harmonizing the nine souls, restoring the palace’s qi, making one’s spirit correct and evil dissipate, all hundred gates open and bright, signs and secret treasures, do not rashly proclaim; this is called the Three Heavens Dragon Text."

The Supreme Nine Truths compose the Dragon Text; the Emperor Lord’s divine court uses the body as home, the Heavenly Revered’s vermilion chamber, the Hall of Light is residence, sitting upright at Supreme Ultimate, mysterious elixir not corrupted. The Mysterious Mother rides the three pure chariots; the Primal Father controls the red feathered flying carriage, left driving the scarlet phoenix, right holding the reins of the spirit crow; one inch square, upper spirit gathers capital, cinnabar terrace fire gate, flowing reflections dispersing void, high resting in the Great Microcosm, hands hold purple register, spiritual abyss and white pools, golden honey water jade, nine qi wandering, flying splendour cloud leaping, within is the great spirit, unnamable. Father drives primal qi, mother carries mysterious axis, cap with sun essence, belt with tiger talisman, flowing fire ten thousand zhang, eyes born dragon lights, Heavenly Emperor holds the rod, phoenix robes and feathered attendants, the god emperor nurtured, resides in the purple chamber, Hall of Light’s north, irrigating and continuing essence, guarding the mysterious valley, entering and exiting the destiny chamber, wandering through the cave gate, sometimes entering the central palace, connecting to the Great Origin, lingering on the four airs, nine stars dividing and judging, five viscera firm and splendid, Supreme Unity guards soul, sleeping in the secluded court, commanding seven spirits. If one can chant it, by day ascend the morning. Essence responds wondrously, governing the spiritual beasts, mountain collapse and water break, calling hum and roar to rescue, life ground gains time, ascending heavenly mansions. The Nine Truths way completes; if leaked, misfortune comes; the Three Officials leak poison, examine and punish leaks; when transmitting to immortals, carefully see if completion is possible."

**The Central Yellow Lord’s Chapter of the Eight Secret Words**

The secret words say: "Leisurely heart, quiet chamber, bright and empty truth, escaping thought and wondrous vision, soaring cleansing the mysterious person; if truly responding to the upper meeting, spirit enlightenment at dawn, one will likewise see the cinnabar qi of the elixir, three pure flying clouds, eight chariots and vermilion carriages, purple mist and jade wheels, Shangqing’s floating glance, turning reins of the Three Primes, High Emperor holding the rod, spiritual children climbing the shaft, Great Element holding the canopy, Southern Pole facing the hall, Emperor Lord guarding the chamber, assembling the five spirits of brightness, seven qi continuing brightness, high radiance and distant entanglement, dark light outward shining, gathering the beauty of dragon countenance, images illuminating the Great Void, flowing and escaping the seven views. You diligently await, immediately become a flying immortal; when cloud wheels suddenly descend, then by day ascend the morning, no need to again condense frost and wash the splendour, mysterious fat and golden elixir."

**The One Path Secret Words:** On the day of the beginning of spring, in the first month on days of Jia or Yi, early morning looking northward, if one sees purple, green, white clouds, these are the Three Pure Flying Clouds of the Supreme Three Primes. At that time the Three Primes ride the eight chariots’ wheels, ascending to the Heavenly Sovereign Supreme Emperor. Those who await and see these three colour clouds should in heart bow and strike cheeks, four times bow, self-declare and beg: “I, descendant so-and-so, in my youth love morality and cultivation of the Nine Truths, bathing with the five spirits, recorded by Heavenly Emperor and Emperor Lord; today by fortune, encountering the Three Primes going out, I beg to serve and receive the chariot’s hub.” Pray at will. If one sees the three prime lords’ chariots thrice, then by day ascend to immortality, no need for other thoughts, thousands of acts accomplished. The prayers for the eight paths are likewise so; these are called the Eight Secret Words, not to be heard by those without immortal registration.

**The Two Path Secret Words:** On the day of the vernal equinox, and on days of Yin and Mao, at midnight looking northeast, if one sees dark blue, dark green, yellow clouds, these are the three pure clouds of the Great Microcosm Heavenly Emperor. At that time the Great Microcosm Heavenly Emperor rides the eight splendid chariots, ascending to the High Supreme Jade Emperor. See and pray as above. If one sees the Emperor’s chariot four times, then by day the dragon carriage and feathered canopy come to meet and ascend to heaven.

**The Three Path Secret Words:** On the day of the beginning of summer, and on Jiazi early days, days of Wuchen and Jisi, at dawn looking northwest, if one sees purple, blue, yellow clouds, these are the three pure clouds of the Supreme True Man of the Supreme Ultimate Three Primes Inner Palace. At that time the Supreme True Man of the Supreme Ultimate Three Primes rides the mysterious green chariot, ascending to the Purple Microcosm Palace. Pray and bow as above. If one sees the Supreme Ultimate chariot five times, then by day ascend to immortality.

**The Four Path Secret Words:** On the day of the summer solstice, and on Jiaxu early days, days of Wuyin and Ji卯, at dawn looking southeast, if one sees red, white, blue clouds, these are the three pure clouds of the Great Emperor Fusang. At that time the Great Emperor Fusang rides the bright eight paths chariot, ascending to the Great Microcosm Palace. See and pray as above. If one sees it four times, then by day clouds and dragons come to meet and ascend to heaven.

**The Five Path Secret Words:** On the day of the beginning of autumn, early days of Jiashen, days of Wuzi and Jichou, at dawn looking west, if one sees white, red, purple clouds, these are the three pure clouds of the Supreme True White Emperor Heavenly Sovereign. At that time the Supreme True White Emperor rides the Xiao Tiao jade carriage, ascending to the Jade Heaven Mysterious Emperor High True. Pray and bow as above. If one sees it five times, then by day ascend to immortality.

**The Six Path Secret Words:** On the day of the autumnal equinox, early days of Jiawu, days of Wuxu and Jihai, at dawn looking south, if one sees white, red, yellow clouds, these are the three pure clouds of the Supreme True Red Emperor of the Southern Pole. At that time the Supreme True Red Emperor rides the cinnabar blue carriage, ascending to the Langfeng platform, to the Lady of Nine Spirits. If one sees it, pray and bow as above. If one sees it four times, then by day ascend to immortality.

**The Seven Path Secret Words:** On the day of the beginning of winter, early days of Jiashen, days of Wushen and Ji酉, at dawn looking southwest, if one sees green, purple, blue clouds, these are the three pure clouds of the Supreme True Emperor Lord Ancestor of Shangqing. At that time the Supreme True Emperor Lord Ancestor rides the mysterious eight light cinnabar carriage, ascending to the High Supreme Ninth Heaven Jade Emperor. Pray and bow as above. If one sees it four times, then the purple morning Supreme Unity Lord rides phoenix patterned feathered carriage, comes to meet at the hour of Zi, by day ascend to morning.

**The Eight Path Secret Words:** On the day of the winter solstice, early days of Jiayin, days of Wuwu and Ji未, at dawn looking east, if one sees vermilion, jade, yellow clouds, these are the three pure clouds of Supreme Xiao Jade Consort Great Void Supreme True Man. At that time the Supreme Xiao Jade Consort Great Void Supreme True Man rides the wandering jade carriage, ascending to the Supreme Emperor Palace, summoning the Great Microcosm Heavenly Emperor. Upon seeing these cloud colours, bow, pray and beseech as above. If one sees it thrice, the Jade Emperor commands the Yellow Fate Master to ride the crimson dragon jade carriage to meet at the hour of Zi, by day ascend to morning.

Thus the eight path secret words complete. Those who see them should in heart bow and strike cheeks, four times bow, self-declare as above. Also one should first bathe and burn incense, prepare for the time, and let the heart stretch and look for a meal’s time, then return to the chamber. The three pure clouds each have their colours, colours overlapping as described. For example, on the day of the beginning of spring if one sees the Three Primes’ three pure clouds, then purple cloud above, green cloud next, white cloud below, mutually mingling. Be careful to observe. Early days mean within ten days of the month, with Jiazi day included. If not the day or hour but one sees these clouds, one should also bow and pray, thrice as much as that day and hour. Other days imitate Jiazi.

Those who practice the Nine Truths and conduct the affairs of the Eight Paths are guarded by heavenly beings protecting their forms and bodies, true emperors guarding their destined bones. Those without immortal names or jade registers, even in the netherworld this scripture is not shown; though they seek it, they will never see it. Those who see it have all heavenly registers and prior names, responding as immortals and spirits.

Those who practice this way must not allow others to offend their shoes and sandals, nor their headscarves or clothes. Shoes and sandals must always be fresh; headscarves and clothes must always be clean. In practicing this way, no transgressions or taboos are permitted.

**The Supreme True Great Element’s Method of the Five Spirits of the Emperor Lord**

Always on Wuxu days at rooster crowing time, close eyes and hold the blue qi of the east, as large as a bow coming from the sun, filling and entering the head’s mud pellet. Also two blue smokes arise from the eyes, thick and dense, transforming into two children, dressed above and below in blue, like newborn infants just walking. The left eye child is named Emperor Lord Flying Spirit; the right eye child is named Supreme Unity Morning Infant. Both attend me on arising and resting. Intensely envision and contemplate them long. When finished, strike teeth nine times, swallow saliva nine times, and softly pray:

Eastern Five Spirits, sun qi shining blue, Emperor Lord two children, suddenly born, entering the mud pellet at dawn, refining brain and precious form, left transforms right changes, obtaining the name of the Way, make me ascend court, Supreme Element purple clarity.

When finished, intensely call the names of the two children, then all harms will not touch me. These two children are the soul and spirit of the Mysterious Mother and the spirit of the Mysterious Father; therefore they take the name of the Emperor Lord Supreme Unity and transform as names, protecting the soul and guiding the spirit, preserving soul and spirit rightly, so one form always lives. If cultivated eighteen years, by day one ascends to heaven. Preserve the two children, let them issue from the eyes, causing blue qi to suddenly transform and be generated. Preserve on left and right, each child emits blue qi, irrigating and encircling my whole body, penetrating inside and outside.

### The Scripture of the Nine Truths of the Supreme Emperor of Shangqing, Scroll Two

The Supreme Jade Morning Yu Yi Flying Sun Red Radiance Jade Text

The Supreme Jade Morning Binding Lin Flying Moon Yellow Radiance Jade Chapter

The right Flying Sun and Moon Secret Way, treasured by the Supreme Supreme Ultimate Nine Emperors and Four True Men of Shangqing, the jade chapter of the Mysterious Void Original Lord. Without the golden pavilion jade name and the green character Eastern Splendour, none may hear or see these two chapters. Those who practice first purify by fasting one hundred days, severing human affairs, then do it. With long practice, one flies to the sun and moon, receiving fifteen jade boys and jade girls each.

The Supreme Yu Yi Red Text and Binding Lin Yellow Chapter are the spiritual secret chapters of the Supreme Jade Emperor Lord. Stored in the chamber of the Nine Heavens, the terrace of cinnabar and jade, none but those who diligently seek truth and have prior records of flying mysterious heavenly immortals may obtain and see them. Hearing of their titles, none may rashly speak of them; offenders are punished by the Three Officials, heaven and earth do not pardon. Initially, one after three hundred years may propagate to one person; then after seven hundred years, may again transmit to one person. If the divine truth mysteriously reports one suitable for transmission, then transmit. The method of transmission is always master to disciple, to exalt the mystery.

The seven spirits’ leftover qi transform into dragon and tiger, guarding the human’s earth gate, hiding beneath shoes and sandals. The three souls’ leftover spirits transform into five spirits’ clouds, reflected on the headscarf. If offended, the heart shakes and mind is alarmed, sadly losing itself; this causes spirit loss and soul scattering, essence and light to obscure and stagnate. Always be vigilant, no soil beneath shoes and sandals, avoiding the qi of manure earth; inside and outside clothes must have no filth, avoiding the smoke of sluggishness. Attending the scripture are high jade boys and girls, each seventeen, saying the merits and faults of those who have the scripture, seizing ten thousand evils and misfortunes. If the disciple views the scripture, enter a separate chamber, burn incense left and right. When transmitting, only after fasting is it handed over. According to transmission method, both fast quietly to sincerely fix heart, think spirit and search truth, unify intention. Now the precious book contains the affairs of Nine Truths and the names of twenty-four spirits, remembering and praying in speech all are spiritual words from above; therefore it is received with solemn fast, beginning the examination of leakage. Both fast together twenty-four days, then before and after fast one day each; when days end, produce the scripture and hand to disciple. Disciple writes copy, cuts hair and binds knot, goes to master as proof. Nowadays white silk nine zhang is used for covenant, cutting and wounding as oath; using white raw silk is the qi of the Great Element, using nine zhang is the number of Nine Truths. After receiving scripture, no leak or transmission is permitted; to fail virtue and corrupt truth, many words and wrong conduct, pollutes the Dao truth. Those who follow and cultivate this scripture, by day ascend morning; those who violate covenant, seven ancestors receive hell’s examination.

The Purple Spirit Lord of Shangqing and the Primordial Purple Spirit Dao Lord constantly dwell inside the cave chamber, observing and gazing at the Nine Heavens, resting under the splendid star, sleeping within the nine essences, restraining soul and spirit to ascend north, refining five spirits with true qi, roaming freely the eight pure, listing names on the mysterious chart. The Supreme Supreme Dao Lord chants: "Above purple gate, gaze at eight mornings, list cinnabar palace, complete bright spirits, roam nine qi, dance heavenly immortals, cap sky blue, chant great calendar, belt split and fallen, recite spiritual plan, summon storm dragon, tread double white, lead purple children, turning two reds, hide great element, conceal splendid wall." This says the Purple Spirit Three Emperor Lords always bring forth the way of the five spirits’ scripture. The Great Calendar is the *Seven Saints Mysterious Records*, the Spiritual Plan is the *Jade Emperor Scripture*.

The ritual says: "If given to wrong person, not following method, is to leak heavenly patterns. Breaking slow and violating oath, death as lower ghost, then seven ancestors punish with wind and fire. If not of same qi, better to keep silent."

In the Western Mysterious Mountain cave terrace, these two scriptures are engraved on jade slips, written in golden characters. Also at Wangwu Clear Void Heaven they exist but incompletely; only the Supreme Mysterious Palace high terrace and Penglai Prefecture north chamber golden pillars and jade walls have engraved texts complete. The middle palace immortals and Supreme Clear officers do not know what these scriptures are.

In the northern cave of Mount Emei, stone chamber hinges bear inscription: "Yu Yi draws sun essence, Binding Lin brings moon spirit, attaining Dao at upper palace, position is Emperor Lord truth." Twenty characters below; immortals seeing it do not understand it. To practice and obtain this, no need to be wise or foolish, only that on earth these texts do not exist. True officials and mysterious methods, open oath then transmit; those with Dao and practice attain position of Supreme True, then ride the eight splendid jade wheels, roam the nine mornings, visit the Great Element Palace, see Supreme Unity Emperor Lord, jointly paying homage to morning origins. Therefore secret words say: "You who obtain Yu Yi Binding Lin, thus form the true Shangqing; without cultivating the Supreme Way, you cannot see the Three Primes."

Those who practice the flying sun and moon ways may do so at will; no need to complete all. To obtain quiet chamber and concealment, only let one see the beginning glow of the sun and moon. If not severing human affairs and connected with external things, one cannot proceed in this way. At midnight incense must be burned, preserving the five Emperor and five Emperor Ladies’ names, praying in heart:

"May I unite with the Emperor Lord Supreme Unity and five spirits, merging brightness as one." Thus for twenty-four years, also by day ascend heaven, no need to practice flying and preserving ways further. Always preserve them at my sides and recite prayers silently; do not let ears hear.

Practicing Yu Yi flying sun way, every morning watch the sun rising; if no sun, in quiet chamber first close eyes, hold breath ten breaths, then swallow sun’s light ten times, preserving the sun’s light, letting it enter my mouth and immediately swallow. When finished, softly call the names of the five Emperor Lords and moon souls thrice. Then preserve the moon midday Blue Emperor Lady coming from moonlight, at my sides, successively as with the sun midday five Emperors. When all come, preserve robes and imitate their forms. Then strike teeth five times, swallow saliva nine times, softly pray:

When finished, preserve flowing bell flying cloud carriage, driving ten yellow dragons, come from moonlight to before me, still preserve riding with five Emperors, and flying sun. Forget form long, swallow saliva fourteen times, then open eyes, intensely contemplate, preserving thought with imitation. Those who can long practice this way will surely obtain riding splendour flying sun; this is the end of Yu Yi’s way.

Practicing Binding Lin flying moon way, every evening watch moon rising; if no moon, in quiet chamber first close eyes, hold breath nine breaths, then swallow moonlight nine times, preserving moonlight, causing it to enter my mouth and immediately swallow. When finished, softly pray the five Emperor Ladies’ names, and sun soul names thrice. Then preserve moon midday Blue Emperor Lady coming from moonlight, at my sides, successively as with sun midday five Emperors. When all come, preserve robes and imitate their forms. Then strike teeth nine times, swallow saliva nine times, softly pray:

"Yellow essence initiates radiance, primal yin inwardly manifests, illuminate and observe Supreme Mysterious, open and penetrate myriad directions, scatter cold fierce wind, seven mornings suspended with jade, return yin to three joins, heaven and earth emit light, purple radiance rotates and knots, floating splendour nine voids, round brightness assign colours, six qi transform and pass, five Emperor Ladies, tread clouds and grasp wind, spiritual cape and jade net, wearing jade girdle and pendants, feathered skirt brushing sky, escaping void fanning east, soaring trees spreading morning, canopy smooth and elegant, cloud frog refining and rubbing, support and nourish wood king, cave root ten thousand li, shade restraining my body, soul harmonizing and spirit transforming, six mysterious void filling, returning old to infant, jade reflecting reverse child, Emperor Lord united transformation, joining splendour Peach Kang, at times riding flowing bell, flying clouds ten dragons, ascending bright moon, position immortal emperor, longevity joining two images, heaven and earth endless."

When finished, preserve flowing bell flying cloud carriage, driving ten yellow dragons, come from moonlight to before me, still preserve riding with five Emperor Ladies, and flying moon. Forget form long, swallow saliva thirty times, then close eyes, intensely contemplate, preserving thought with imitation. Those who can long practice this way will surely obtain riding splendour flying moon; this is the end of Binding Lin’s way.

If one has already attained the immortal way, and prepared refined thoughts, preserving two years, then will have imitation form; three years form appears; five years practice it and obtain flying sun and moon. If not yet immortal, seeking refined thought is thus premature. Those who long cultivate it, ascend to two splendours above, becoming Supreme True Man.

Each is separately pounded, starting with cinnabar, each four thousand pestle strokes. The medicines must all be refined, bright and fresh; medicine pounders must be warm and careful, speaking little. First fast thirty days, on the day finish pounding, in a separate quiet chamber, clean clothes, bathe several times, always from fragrant cleanliness. The combined medicine may be prepared by three or four persons, with united heart and purpose, secluded and quiet, following taboos and fasting rules. When all pounding is finished, place medicine in cauldron. According to the first time, put cinnabar inside first, then realgar, then orpiment, then empty blue, then incense of Lu, finally Supreme Unity leftover grain on top of all. After all twenty-four kinds are in, order and level them with small willow comb, making them close. Then pour five jin mercury over all. When finished, slowly place the clay cauldron on top, mud it with cinnabar mud on the edge, oyster mud on the outer edge one cun, dry in shade ten days, when dry crack and add mud again. When finished, again coat with oyster mud on outer surface, all four sides, making thickness six fen. Also should first make six-one mud to coat inside and outside of mud cauldron.

**Making Mud Method:** Use eastern sea left-curving oyster, Rong salt, cinnabar, talc, red stone resin, earth yellow of earthworm and mole. Six substances, all measured equally, pounded and sifted through fine silk, mixed with hundred days bitter wine, very sour and concentrated. After mixing, pound another thirty thousand strokes, making six-one mud. Coat mud on inside and outside of earth cauldron, gradually thin, drying in sun, so that over time mud is gradually added. When finished, inside and outside cauldron are each two cun and a half thick. This completes the mud cauldron. Make six-one mud in steady quantity enough for use. The mud making method always uses bitter wine to mix. If no Rong salt, great salt from Hedong may be used. Also mix two dou eastern sea fine salt into one hu bitter wine, wring and remove dregs, to mix six-one mud, this is the standard.

**Making Furnace Method:** Must be in a place with no people; first build furnace house, four zhang long, south facing with open house, east end as door, south side as gauze window, furnace in center. Furnace is square, four sides open, with great iron legs to set the cauldron in the center, arranging height to distance up and down as desired; good to have quiet and hidden. Place medicine earth cauldron, good to set on top of support, and kindle chaff fire beneath to burn. Adjust fire so that bottom of cauldron is about one chi from fire, managing fire not to be fierce. After eighteen days, lower fire by five cun, continue nine days; sufficient days, lower fire by three cun, continue seven days; sufficient days, lower fire by one cun, continue five days; sufficient days, fire level with bottom of cauldron, twenty-seven days; sufficient days, fire reaches halfway under cauldron belly, thirty days; sufficient days, fire ends two cun above bottom of cauldron, twenty-four days. When all finished, medicine is done. May then let cool for seven days, then slowly open to observe. The eight splendours four blossoms all hang above cauldron. Sweep with feathers of three-year-old white male chicken, store in gold and silver sealed vessels. Their splendour shall be of cloud colours, fifty-eight kinds of qi, flowing rosy reflections, purple light thick and shining, unnamable; named the Eight Splendours Four Blossoms Five Pearls Scarlet Born Spirit Elixir.

On the first day of second and eighth months, at dawn facing the Tai Sui king, bow twice, take one liang with east flowing water. Head born with nine mornings’ light, face with jade splendour, flying and reflecting precious brilliance, penetrating and viewing all under heaven. Close breath and immediately produce the three pure cloud chariots. Spit on ground, transform into sun and moon light. Left whistle, immortals bow; right whistle, eight splendours united truth. Thus ascend into sky to purple void, enter and exit jade clarity, sleep and feast in morning chambers. If medicine splendour not fully risen, may add mud to fix edges as above, seal tightly, then burn cauldron belly, sixty days, surely nothing will fail. Let cool for seven days, then open as at first.

To refine hemp fat one hu, take three liang four blossoms purple splendour, combine in copper vessel, simmer over low fire three days until medicine done, named Four Blossoms Purple Syrup. Dose one he daily, life equal to heaven and earth, body divides into ten thousand persons, forms emptiness and moves, desires follow at will.

Apply four blossoms purple fat to palms and nails; with mirror closely observe, then see objects ten thousand li away, what one wishes to see, also reflects coming events, imitating forms of life, death, prosperity, and decline in mysterious transformations.

This elixir is also called Eight Splendour Elixir, or Four Blossoms Purple Splendour, or Great Microcosm Purple Jade Fat, or Five Pearls Splendour Elixir, or Scarlet Born Morning Splendour, or Three Blossoms Supreme, or Supreme Flying Network, or Nine Morning Supreme Elixir—eight names in all.

**Method of refining hemp fat:** five dou clear water, one hu hemp fat, two jin each of empty pavilion Wu Sha, scallion and leek white, combine water, fat, empty pavilion Wu Sha—four substances, boil together, take one hu only.

To make purple blossom fat, do so in quiet place, cover copper vessel with wood cover, do not let fat smoke escape. Refined fat may be taken alone to extend life.

When the chaff fire and Eight Splendour Spirit Elixir days are sufficient, do not kindle fire, then kindle fire again as at first dawn, proceeding fire days as before. When all finished, cool for seven days then kindle, medicine smoke turns to bright moon pearls five pieces, hanging on the lid, all wrapped in scarlet cloth. Taking these scarlet cloths with clear water causes scarlet clouds to appear, flying up to Shangqing. Wearing these five pearls, one reflects all under heaven, and shares light with sun and moon. This elixir is called Five Pearls Scarlet Born, used to practice Shangqing. Using double fire, after five pearls formed, do not kindle fire, kindle again, using fire as before, then after fire days, cool for twenty-one days, then open, bright moon five pearls again turn into three blossoms flying network dragon. After opening the cauldron, one becomes vague and long, patterned with splendour and glory, breath emits clouds, so called hidden dragon. One rides it to go to the Nine Morning Palace. Hence the High Supreme Scripture says: "You ride the hidden dragon, with heaven endless."

The fire doubling days count as one day for the first fire, then the subsequent fires correspond to two days, four days, eight days, sixteen days; each matter follows this number.

**Method of making tiger cane flower:** take one jin horse king qiong, finely pounded to crumbs, six liang tiger cane flower, mix with crumbs into cakes, dry in shade. After dry, pound again, weigh six liang, remainder thrown into east flowing water. Shade dried tiger cane flower within three years also usable, no need to be newly dried but must be good. When drying, keep in silk pouch, no dust attachment.

Take ten jin tin, boil in iron pot half day, add one zhu four blossoms purple splendour, stir a moment, immediately forms withered purple gold, bending and stretching on human, called initial formation. Add two zhu, forms purple blossom jade, add three zhu, forms mysterious pear green jade.

Take residue of Eight Splendour Elixir, pound thirty thousand times, take one pill daily about size of small bean, body grows jade light, life equal to nine mornings, fragrance smells for thirty li. Burn one pill size of small bean, repel hundred epidemics and evil qi, ghosts and misfortune, fragrance lasts ten days unceasing. Take one pill size of millet, hold and spit, then transform at will, hide form and shadow, roam ten thousand directions, wish to stop then swallow pill, then cease. One who died less than three days, taking one pill size of large bean immediately revives. When pills come out, bite teeth and send with water. Also apply one pill to heart, then soul returns, four limbs warm and soft.

Take ten jin lead and tin, boil in iron vessel, add two pills size of egg yolk, stir a moment, immediately forms gold. Add three pills, forms purple grinding gold. Carry one pill and go, then mountain and sea gods come to court. Apply one pill to door, then household no illness, repel hundred ghosts and spirits. Take one pill daily, after hundred days colour like woman, after three years face returns to infant. Take one pill size of small bean, throw into water, then dragon fish floats up and water boils. Take one pill size of large bean, throw into fire, fire stops shining for about one day.

The Supreme Shangqing High Saint Central Yellow Lord Cave Truth Golden Mysterious Nine Yin Nine Truth Jade Scripture, Supreme Yu Yi Binding Lin Chapter, Eight Splendour Spirit Elixir Text, all engraved at Eastern Splendour Immortal Spirit Terrace, not proclaimed in the world. Without prior immortal name, none may hear or see. When transmitting, all fast and think spirit, carefully to hand over, establish covenant with oath, and no leak. Those receiving Emperor Lord’s Nine Yin Secret Use a green silk knot as covenant. Those receiving Supreme Yu Yi Text use scarlet patterned silk twenty-four zhang, the sun’s radiance oath. Those receiving Supreme Binding Lin Chapter use blue patterned silk twenty-four zhang, moon glory oath. Those receiving Eight Splendour Scripture use gold ring three pairs, the ever-youth child circle transformation oath. Combining four covenants, calling Nine Mornings as agreement, pointing to sun and moon as witness, surely no leakage, heart aligned with heaven and earth. If not deeply believing and oathful, body becomes lower ghost, seven generations and parents undergo water and fire examination, crushed by mountain stones, thrown into accumulated night river. According to scripture master’s received covenant objects, should scatter to cold and poor, saving poor and sick in urgent distress, helping mountain and river starving people, managing spirit and divine public use. If privately cutting to sustain self, greedy and excessive for profit, then scripture master’s seven ancestors receive long examination in hell, body entering wind and fire, very painful. Also disciple scripture masters, harmonize hearts and love each other, thus close to root. With strong Dao and virtue, one enters ghostless interval; with close root, soul and spirit rest peacefully. If beginning strong but ending slow, never constant virtue, how can life be long, how can immortal be needed? Those who obtain its meaning, may begin to speak of tracing the Dao’s beginning and end.
