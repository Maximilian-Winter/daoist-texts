### Supreme Jade Pendant and Golden Tassel Taiji Golden Scripture, Upper Classic

In the first year of the Upper Spirit, on the first day of the first month, at the conjunction of the Six Origins, on the day of Jiazi and the zhi hour, the Primordial Heavenly King and the Supreme Emperor Lord together rode on the Azure Mist swift gale and purple company, ascending to the cliff of the Nine Mysteries at the border of colorlessness, wandering the Cavernous Heavens, roaming the utmost origin, streaming and flashing through the body, drifting freely on the floating wheel, beholding the Two Instruments as they cleave and judge, observing the great transformation as it endures, bowing and assuming the imperial throne, rejoicing in our Way and delighting therein, calculating the cycles to reform measures, awakening the generation of the end to revolve the wheel, praying for auspicious omens in the Great Void, expounding the highest law in the Nine Heavens, opening an oath and announcing to the spirits, purifying and fasting in the Sky Court. On that day suddenly the heavenly light darkened and clouded, the sun and moon were obscured at noon, the Eight Qi turned back in refusal, the Seven Origins concealed their essence, the profound phenomena were sluggish and blocked, myriad spirits fled, three days and three nights, the Jade Rooster heralding the dawn. At that time nine suns shone brightly in the east, mysterious light radiated clearly at the Heavenly Origin, again a Blue Crow came flying, its beak holding a purple scripture, gathering at the Jade Pavilion, flying down from the sky, mysteriously presenting it to the Heavenly King and the Supreme Emperor. Thereupon the two lords purified themselves in the High Heaven, receiving the divine text with respect, and recorded thus:

The Jade Pendant and Golden Tassel Taiji Golden Scripture, the Profound Truth Cavernous Flight of the Two Scenes Treasure Scripture, its literary splendour dense as the Great Sky, its divine radiance shining in the Nine Heavens, the jade chapters illuminating wisdom in the Purple Void, the treasured sounds drifting clear at the Misty Ford. High above, the Pure Spirit maidens are dispatched, the Supreme Truth bestows purple morning children, each three thousand attendants guarding the divine text. The jade maidens scatter flowers to dispel filth, the purple children turn incense to ward off dust, splendid lights meet and mingle, the four assemblies perform incense rites, felicitous clouds hover, the Seven Origins pour their essence, the Nine Suns shine brightly, heavenly purity displays itself, the rivers and seas calm in waves, the Eight Winds raise the wheel, golden immortals wield battle-axes, the Five Emperors bear banners, flying immortals mounted on feathered steeds number hundreds of millions, holding banners and drums, arraying soldiers in countless ranks, dragons and poisonous beasts brandish claws on cloud peaks, jade trees sound their music, a hundred chants answer each other, palace tones harmonize in the void, high and low produce melody, western consorts beat time, heavenly maidens jingle their bells, the Eight Sounds ring in confusion, ethereal echoes fill the cloud camp, twin sovereigns quicken the beat, phoenixes dance and soar, the Dragon Flowers fold four times, the chorus joins in one voice, cloud chimes sound clearly, startling the pure jade, flying songs interweave, broad music fills the void court, manifesting the yellow and black brilliance, thick as the net of stars, the Three Treasures fan each other, knotting the void and encircling the spirit, myriad spirits all glad, Three Candles join in brightness, no day nor night, long celebration with clouds spread.

Thereupon the Primordial Heavenly King and Supreme Emperor Lord took the golden-blue alliance seal to heaven, announced to the spirits of the Nine Voids, and received the Supreme Truth. They cast gold into slips, carved the spiritual script, caused the Turtle Mother to hold the brush, the Great One to sweep the mat, placed them in a pouch of cloud brocade, secreted in the dense forest chest, sealed with the jade-pure Three Origins seal, entrusted to the Left Official of the Immortal Capital and the attendant immortal feathered youth, stored in the Great Element Jade Terrace's Mysterious Cloud Feather Chamber. They also commanded the Northern Cold Golden Terrace Dragon Flower Jade Maidens and White Void Yu Palace Western Spirit Jade Children, three hundred each, to hold incense and cloths, guarding the spiritual truth. According to the Supreme Truth's ordinances, those who are to be transmitted through myriads of kalpas shall have their bones and forms united with immortals. Those who see it shall call the Taiji scripture by name, and report it to the Upper Clarity. To lightly leak or reveal it is to be named a ghost official, punished by wind blades, the Seven Ancestors fulfilling their charge—how can one be careless!

In the first year of the Central Emperor, on the first day of the third month, day of Gengyin, when heavenly virtue coincides, the Primordial descended to teach in the Cold Spirit Elixir Hall, Jade Terrace Yellow Chamber, commanding the Five Elders of the Immortal Capital to display the frost gauze cloud brocade report, the dense forest chest, and bring forth the Jade Pendant and Golden Tassel Taixiao Hidden Scripture, Profound Truth Cavernous Flight of the Two Scenes Treasure Scripture, to transmit to the High Sage Jade Morning Supreme Great Way Lord, the Three Heavens Jade Children, Western Turtle Queen Mother, Purple Pure Great Element Three Origins Lords, and the Central Yellow Old Lord. The Supreme Emperor transmitted it to the Celestial Emperor Lord, Supreme Emperor of the Great Microcosm, Southern Pole Upper Origin Prohibition Lord, and the Imperial Heaven Upper Clarity Golden Gate Emperor Lord. At that time the assembly of spirits ascended to the Great Void Jade Terrace Cavernous Truth Hall, dwelling within the Jade Chamber Golden Splendour, purified and fasted three months, arrayed in golden blue to swear oaths to the spirits, announcing the Red Alliance to the Supreme Truth. Thereupon the Jade Pendant Soul Essence Emperor Lord, clad in a pearl-embroidered splendid robe and flying brocade blue skirt, wearing a moon-embracing sun-headed purple crown, holding the jade pendant stood to the left; the Golden Tassel Spirit Soul Emperor Lord, clad in a purple pearl-embroidered robe and flying gauze cinnabar skirt, wearing a moon-embracing sun-headed splendid crown, holding the golden tassel stood to the right. The two lords at the command of the spirits declared the alliance; there appeared blue and white two lights, shining brilliantly in the Nine Heavens, streaming through the Great Void, startling the four officers of jade purity and the five emperors, flying immortals and feathered riders numbering hundreds of millions, suddenly arriving and leading the immortal jade youths holding the five emperors’ spiritual millstones, the assembly of immortals floating in position, myriad spirits guarding the pavilion. The Primordial Heavenly Lord wore the crown of the Limitless Cavernous Heaven, donned the nine-coloured Li gauze robe and flying frost pearl garment, girded with the divine radiance sun bell and extending sword, left side hung the broken fall, right side the golden truth. The Supreme Emperor wore the seven-pearl crown, draped in nine-coloured natural cloud-patterned robe, flying gauze shining feather mantle, belt with phoenix design flowing gold fire bells, hand holding the command demon nine-coloured baton. The nine elder immortals held golden essence on the air table, upholding the treasured text to present to the assembly of spirits. Thus the affairs of the spirits were fully declared, each with three hundred golden immortal children and Taihua daughters attending the divine truth. Such are the high sages, each presenting monthly three times the spiritual text. When the cycle reaches the end of the Three Dynasties, heaven and earth’s qi mingle, the seed peoples to be transmitted, with mysterious names in jade registers, listing the figures of the Three Origin Heavens. Without this excellence, the golden chamber is secret; one must not rashly reveal the truth nor leak the spiritual text.

Jade Pendant Taixiao Hidden Scripture of the Cavernous Flight Treasure Scripture

The jade pendant holds the soul essence of the Nine Heavens. Above the Nine Heavens its name is Morning Lamp, also called Supreme Hidden Profound Cavernous Flight Treasure Chapter. It dwells in the Jade Pure Pavilion of Taixiao, binding the energy of Azure Yang, reflecting the Nine Heavens, its blue light obscure, illuminating the Three Origin Terrace, its colour like blue jade, its form like a full moon. Within is the Vacant Profound Jade Terrace Purple Palace, where the Soul Essence Emperor Lord resides centrally, the Taixiao Hidden Scripture Jade Pendant Mysterious Terrace South Pavilion text. The scripture says:

To seek long life, first take from the body the moonlight and moon essence, the sun’s glow and sun brilliance, the left turns the jade pendant, the right holds the golden tassel, the two scenes entwined, twin spirits at peace, ascending the Taiji, descending to the ten directions, firmly preserving profound truth, securing the spiritual root, profound valley flower infant, pouring and reflecting precious deposits, rinsing moon and chewing sun, entering the Heavenly Gate, the golden tassel gazing upward, the jade pendant guarding the pass, distinctly blue and white, suitable to my mud pellet, the treasured fluid closes essence, refining the soft body and spirit, the three lords fully guarding, in cinnabar and purple skirts, pearl-embroidered splendid robes, flying brocade blue skirts, with moon embracing sun, head erect with purple crown, seated in the Bright Hall, shaded by the Seven Origins, Yellow Court Wu and Ji, blocking and securing evil sources, respectfully overseeing the two sons, without brilliance or white origin, Peach Health Three Elders, at my life gate, penetrating the five palaces, twelve threads, breathing the six chambers, soul rejoicing and spirit delighted, dispelling a hundred ailments, banishing heat and cold, the two scenes entwined, myriad spirits rejoicing within, clearly manifesting the text, flying ascension to the South Pavilion, grasping the golden pendant jade, entering the scene of mysterious light, Nine Heavens united in spirit, Profound Mother aligned in chamber, yin nursing and yang guiding, bright colours, fresh countenance, ranked within the cinnabar chamber, named and inscribed in the imperial palace, three cycles nine degrees, blending with the course.

This jade pendant treasured text is the Taiji Profound Truth scripture. Those who cultivate it all fly through the Great Void, roam the Nine Purities, inscribing white slips in the eastern flowering registers. The Western Queen Mother now engraves this text on Kunlun Mountain in the Mysterious Garden chamber; none but those pure of emptiness may behold or contemplate.

Whoever desires to soar to the Nine Purities, feast on the Southern Pavilion, turning the jade pendant in the Bright Hall, guiding the golden tassel in the mud pellet, summoning the soul truth in the Morning Lamp, inviting the flying scenes to the Lord Emperor. All who follow this way lie down at dusk, hands upon the heart, eyes closed inwardly, drawing the jade pendant’s azure yang energy, light and colour obscure, like the round moon, reflecting the destined body, penetrating one form. The Soul Essence Emperor Lord, surname Kaiyuan, given name (Men Shixing), form nine cun long, head adorned with purple crown, draped in pearl-embroidered splendid robe, wearing flying brocade blue skirt, girded with moon embracing sun, riding the Azure Crow, amidst azure light, descending to the destined body’s two stabilizers in the mud pellet. The destined body shall knock its teeth nine times through, swallow saliva twenty-seven times, the yin prayer says:

Profound Origin Supreme Spirit, Nine Heavens Soul Essence, Morning Lamp shining brightly, binding chaotic azure qi, named Jade Pendant, illuminating great brightness, girded with moon embracing sun, holding talisman and bell, splendid light streaming, universally dark and dense, riding azure wing, cinnabar chariot purple canopy, first feasting the Three Origins, turning to descend my form, stationed in the mud pellet, flowing down the Yellow Court, inspecting soul binding spirit, myriad spirits settled, five viscera linked, nine apertures splendid, eight scenes soaring, ascending into Jade Purity.

Then rub both hands to warm, press the forehead nine times, wipe eyes twenty-seven times, swallow breath thrice then stop, then lie down. Thus the soul is peaceful and spirit tranquil, myriad spirits guard the palace, inner spirit solidified, outer evil sources sealed, the eight scenes transform, refining truth and becoming immortal. In nine years one may penetrate and behold the dark obscure, investigate what is not yet, sitting and standing between life and death, facing the spirit. At eighteen years the Dao is perfected, truth descends, flying in Upper Clarity. Without this method, the three souls do not guard, the seven spirits are restless, three corpses fly, nine worms rush and startle, attacking within the form, evil enters and communicates essence, qi disperses and spirit departs, body not pure or clear, vainly swallowing saliva, damaging qi and losing spirit. Those who obtain this way can achieve longevity, treasure and practice it with secrecy, their life may not be overturned.

The Right Truth One Inner Spirit, transforms the Three Origins, dividing qi into nine persons, stationed to guard the three palaces, thus each palace has three lords. All are the True Emperor Jade Treasure qi first born of the Nine Heavens, formed into human shape, receiving the name Jade Void. Above, beginning above the Nine Heavens, in the Jade Pure Palace under the ninefold splendid canopy; in the middle roaming the subtle within the Great Void; below governing the three palaces of the human body. If heaven lacks the Three Truths, then the Jade Void is not pure, the Nine Heavens not bright, the Three Lights not clear. If the Great Void lacks the Three Truths, then heaven cannot float emptiness, the Nine Mysteries cannot bind clouds, the Three Caverns cannot reach subtlety, the Five Mountains cannot attain immortality. If man lacks the Three Truths, the three palaces are empty and wasted, myriad spirits fly about, qi disperses and truth departs, infants are disturbed and lost, three corpses compete and attack, nine worms assault and darken. Knowing this secret, together with the Three Treasures and Complete Truth, its method is secret and weighty; it must not be rashly revealed. Without ascending the alliance to report to spirits and swearing the Nine Heavens oath, one must not show the treasured names. To lightly transmit falsehoods incurs responsibility; the Seven Ancestors bear burden in the Three Paths, tread the five hardships on the Knife Mountain, self perishing at the Wind Blade, repaying guilt at the River Source.

There is a golden name Register in the Upper Clarity, receiving this secret, closing the mouth to cultivate and serve, meditating day and night, within three years the true form descends naturally and flies.

Its text is the framework of the Nine Heavens, the flying canopy of Jade Purity.

Therefore the Primordial engraved the text on golden slips, naming it Jade Pure Golden Scripture Secret Characters. Its sound is the inner name of the heavenly souls.

Taiji Golden Characters Jade Script Nine Truth Yin Talisman

The right Nine Heavens Soul Spirit Taixiao Yin Generating Upper Scene Talisman, carved text Golden Tassel Rainbow Reflection Yin Scene within, is the Nine Heavens’ pivot, Upper Clarity splendid canopy. Without this text heaven cannot be dark at daytime; Great Void without this text cannot be Upper Clarity. Therefore the Primordial engraved the text on golden slips, naming it Upper Clarity Golden Characters Jade Script. Its sound is the inner name of heavenly souls. In former times on the first day of the ninth month of the first year of Upper Opening, a blue crow carried the text, presenting it to the Western Queen Mother. Now carved on Kunlun Mountain under piled stones, jade maidens holding incense guard the jade truth. All Upper Clarity spirits receive it from the Primordial, wearing it to roam Upper Clarity palaces. The Nine Heavens secret in the Jade Terrace, not to circulate to later worlds. Those who see the text have golden tassel descending light, whole body illuminating.

Rash leakage and negligence causes loss of body to ghost officials, Seven Ancestors to serve, countless kalpas unrecoverable.

Those who wear this talisman must on white writing black silk, on birth and Tai Sui days ascend Mysterious Mountain, swear blue gold oath to Nine Heavens, report to five spirits and transmit. Speak the secret sounds, pray as in Supreme Truth ordinances. Careful not to rashly reveal or leak, else incur Left Official Wind Blade’s test, lose immortality and body.

Soul Essence Emperor Lord is the Nine Heavens Fate Controller, managing the Soul Essence of Nine Heavens, governing the later disciples’ divinations. The Emperor Lord is stationed in the Sun Gate Golden Court.

Soul Spirit Emperor Lord is the Nine Heavens Prime Minister, master of Nine Heavens Soul Spirit, overseeing later disciples’ registers. Stationed in Moon Palace Linglang Capital.

The Primordial told the Western Queen Mother: learning without knowing the Jade Pendant Morning Lamp are the Nine Heavens’ souls, the Yang Talisman is the initial originating qi, the Golden Scripture Secret Characters are the Nine Heavens’ hidden names; vainly cultivating the Eight Element True Scripture, Spirit Text Purple Script, wearing Sun and Moon Imperial Radiance swallowing commanding flying roots, then the sun essence does not descend, flowing rosy clouds do not scatter roots, vainly drawing qi, the stone scene cannot be gathered, the sun glow cannot be eaten. The Nine Heavens will not accept the destined name, the profound truth cannot be climbed, Morning Lamp cannot be returned, Jade Pendant cannot be turned. Since the two scenes do not descend, the mud pellet is empty and wasted, myriad spirits fly about, soul departs and spirit scatters, qi disperses and truth is lost, laboring in diligence with no gain in immortality.

Learning without knowing the Golden Tassel Rainbow Reflection is the Nine Heavens Soul Spirit, the Yin Talisman Golden Characters Jade Script is the inner sound of the Nine Heavens Soul Spirit, vainly cultivating the Yellow Qi Yang Essence Three Five progression way, Yellow Water Moonlight not to be drunk, youthful face not to be fixed, flower countenance not to remain fresh, spiritual sound not to be recited, Golden Tassel not to be turned, two scenes not descending Bright Hall floating in air, myriad spirits lost home, true scenes scattering and flying, diligent but no gain, losing immortality and bringing disaster. This is the root of learning, be careful to not rashly say this.

Not knowing the name of Soul Essence Emperor Lord, one must not rashly act in wearing and commanding sun essence method. Rash cultivation causes Nine Heavens Fate Controller to take away reckoning, stopping sun from descending. Also without Yang Scene Talisman Golden Scripture Secret Character sound, one must not rashly call Emperor Lord’s name, all lightly stirring Supreme Truth, body bringing great disaster.

Not knowing the name of Soul Spirit Emperor Lord, one must not rashly cultivate and wear moonlight way. Rash acting causes Nine Heavens Prime Minister to erase name and register, stopping moon from descending. Also without Yin Scene Talisman Golden Characters Jade Script, one must not rashly call Emperor Lord’s name, committing offense body subjected to Yin test, losing immortality.

To cultivate the Highest Way, swallowing rosy clouds and breathing qi, wearing and commanding sun and moon, all must first proceed with Jade Pendant and Golden Tassel Yin Yang Two Scenes talismans, retaining thought of the Three Origins Nine Truth Inner Spirits, the two revered Emperor Lords of soul and spirit, then may summon the sun and moon’s radiance. Morning and evening, sitting, rising, lying, and resting, always retain the thought of the sun above the head, the moon at the mouth, Soul Essence Emperor Lord in the mud pellet, Soul Spirit Emperor Lord in the Bright Hall. Mind retaining and eye imagining, constantly making them seem near, within a year true form is seen, blue and white divided. In nine years one may ride the void and fly, ascend to Morning Lamp’s pavilion, roam and feast on Rainbow Reflection Mountain.

Profound Truth Cavernous Flight Two Scenes Treasure Scripture

All who cultivate the Taixiao Way, retain and turn Golden Tassel and Jade Pendant method, must simultaneously command sun and moon essence, to refine the five fetuses’ spirits and summon the five emperors in the sun and the lady in the moon. The two scenes mysteriously reflected, descending the body form, causing the face to have jade lustre, the body to produce wondrous light, inside and out

illuminated, heart keen and eyes clear, thereby the jade pendant may be grasped, golden tassel may be turned. The soul and spirit emperors will rest in the child’s chamber, Morning Lamp and Rainbow Reflection’s light, able to stand and ascend.

The Profound Truth Scripture says: Supreme Supreme Profound, twin spirits four bright, profound truth inner reflection, Bright Hall outer clarity, swallowing breath of two radiances, longevity spirit essence, above supplementing Fate Controller, overseeing myriad spirits, six flowers overflowing, penetrating vision Yellow Tranquility. Total of forty characters, supreme inscribed at the Phoenix Terrace South Pavilion. Not taught except to total true disciples, nor transmitted except to Fate Controller’s chosen.

To cultivate the profound truth method, retain and wear sun and moon #4 in the mouth, by day retain sun, at midnight retain moon, also may retain no day nor night to distinguish the sun. The sun’s colour is red, the moon’s colour is yellow, the sun has purple light nine rays, the moon has white light ten rays. Let sun and moon face the mouth, separated nine chi, rays directed to mouth, rays straight as strings, entering into the mouth. Also retain at sun and moon center a woman, wearing purple veil, vermilion brocade robe and skirt, called Supreme Profound Upper Truth Cinnabar Jade Maiden, named Entwining Rotation, styled Secret Truth, mouth exhaling red qi, filling the sun and moon’s light rays, making them flow together, all entering my mouth, I swallow it, the maiden also exhales, doing this ninety times swallowing complete. Retain the sense, cause the sun and moon’s scenes to approach my face, place the jade maiden’s mouth upon mine, causing qi and fluids to descend, enter the mouth, I then softly pray:

Then retain the jade maiden’s mouth fluids, causing them to pour into my mouth, I rinse full and swallow again ninety times then stop. Quiet the heart and think feeling, practice much, no more limits. If one retains sun then not moon, retains moon then not sun, must balance both. If unable to wear at times, then retain two scenes returning face to Bright Hall, sun left moon right, causing sun moon light to blend with eyes, jointly shining and reflecting the two qi, causing interflow. Also may always retain sun and moon in Bright Hall, not always needing to wear the two scenes, using both together. Practiced five years, the Supreme Profound Jade Maiden will descend to the child, speak with him, the Supreme Profound Jade Maiden can divide form into tens of jade maidens, obeying the child’s command. This accumulates impressions and forms essence, transforming birth and appearance, utmost essence, wonderful response.
