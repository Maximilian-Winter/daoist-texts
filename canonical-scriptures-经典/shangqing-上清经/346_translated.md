# The Supreme Secret Scripture of the Purple Writ of Immortal Taboos, Upper Classic

Title: The Supreme Secret Scripture of the Purple Writ of Immortal Taboos, Upper Classic. Also called "The True Record of Immortal Taboos." The author is unknown; it was roughly composed in the Eastern Jin and Southern Dynasties. Originally it was a chapter of the "Spiritual Writ Purple Script." The original text is found in the "Orthodox Daoist Canon," Cave of the True, section on Rules and Precepts. Collated once.

It was transmitted by Lord Qingtong, of the Purest Clarity, who copied it down at the Red Heaven's Elixir Tomb, from Gong Zhongyang and Youyang, and delivered it to the Perfected of the Southern Palace.

Lord Qingtong said: The difficulty in learning to become an immortal is not but one thing. The difficulty is not that of the vulgar world; the difficulty of immortality is indeed impossible to describe in writing. Though a man may have the sign of an immortal, and be fated to ascend, there are yet ten signs of failure to immortality. If one relies on these signs of immortality, yet errs and is defeated, he too shall not become immortal. Now I secretly reveal to those who possess the signs; you should observe them faithfully.

First: Do not indulge in licentiousness; for licentiousness causes the soul’s essence to leak outward, the vital light to be exhausted, the spirit to burn and the soul to scatter, the bones to grow thin and marrow to putrefy; the soul laments in the spirit mansion, reporting above to the Heavenly Pavilion, where the Three Palaces contend, and the embryonic essence laments its error. This is the first sign of failure to immortality.

Second: Do not act as a secret thief of Yin, cruel and evil. Such cruelty causes the Yellow Court to fall into disorder, the Three Corpses delight to kill, spirits and souls spy and intrude, ghosts molest the chamber, the eyes scatter their martial light, and the mouth generates injurious vapour. These are the second signs of failure to immortality.

Third: Do not become intoxicated with wine. Intoxication ruins the form and substance, confounds true and spirit, causes the soul to forget its original chamber, the soul-soul to roam in evil abodes, the red child to fly about, and the throat and brain fires to be exhausted. These are the third signs of failure to immortality.

Fourth: Do not be filthy, disrespectful, or lacking in vigour. Filth, disrespect, and lack of vigour cause the pure spirit to lose authenticity, the essence and soul to not dwell, the Three Palaces to breed vermin, the red child to float and wander, blood to grow turbid and marrow to stink, the spirit light to lose its dwelling, the soul to flee by evil paths, and beg for death. These are the fourth signs of failure to immortality.

Fifth: Do not eat the flesh of the beast that is your parents’ birth fate. For then the original form and spirit are lost at the beginning, the root foundation perishes, the embryonic spirit wails, the Crimson Lord calls and mourns, the Three Souls suffer poisonous misery, and the soul seeks the burial mound. This meat once taken causes life to fall into long night. These are the fifth signs of failure to immortality.

Sixth: Do not eat the flesh of the beast that is your own birth fate. For then the form and spirit may be violated, the mud pellet diminishes and falls, the Three Palaces close their gates, the infant is confounded, the soul and spirit fly away, and the soul seeks coffins and coffering. These are the sixth signs of failure to immortality.

Seventh: Do not eat the flesh of the six domestic animals. For then the qi and form stagnate and stink, the essence and spirit grow turbid and sluggish, the brain turns yellow and teeth wither, the spleen nurtures deathly qi, the soul does not receive truth, the spirit produces evil vigor, the body sinks into the deep abyss, and bones wish for the earth’s burial. These are the seventh signs of failure to immortality.

Eighth: Do not eat the vegetables of the five pungent spices. For then the five internal organs become foul-smelling, the three blossoms collapse and disorder, the spirit does not rightly reach, the essence and embryo descend and decline, soul and spirit become separated, the red child is vexed and weary, the flying spirit loses its guard, the eyes shed flowing tears and are apprehended. These are the eighth signs of failure to immortality.

Ninth: Do not kill living beings from insects upward. For then the hostilities oppose all things, the bound corpse’s blood is resentful, the form is violent and the soul fierce, the qi and spirit engage in battle, the embryonic spirit wanders, the true child flees and scatters, the mud pellet rages wildly, the red child abandons and rebels, the corpse’s form is boiled in a cauldron of water and fire, dissolving and rotting. These are the ninth signs of failure to immortality.

Tenth: Do not face north when relieving yourself; do not gaze upward at the Three Luminaries; do not face north when cutting hair or shedding garments; do not face north when spitting or cursing, for this offends and destroys the King. The breaking means the time below the year’s branch Chen; the King means the place of the Kingly Qi. Do not be angry at the sun, moon, stars; do not perform acts of authority or punishment on the eight seasonal festivals; do not be angry on the first day of the month; do not eat turtle, dragon, or scale-bearing creatures on the day of the six Jia; do not eat pheasant meat on the day Bingwu; do not eat black beast meat on the day Bingzi; do not perform acts of Yin and Yang, nor lie with women on the day Gengshen; do not become greatly drunk on the day Yimao; do not kill living beings facing north on the fourth day of the first month; do not eat fish on the ninth day of the second month; do not eat the flesh of the five internal organs or the hearts of a hundred grasses on the third day of the third month; do not kill grass or cut trees on the eighth day of the fourth month; do not see blood on the fifth day of the fifth month; do not begin earth work on the sixth day of the sixth month; do not meditate evil thoughts on the seventh day of the seventh month; do not buy shoes, sandals, or any attached-foot items on the fourth day of the eighth month; do not rise from bed on the ninth day of the ninth month; do not punish others on the fifth day of the tenth month; do not fail to bathe on the eleventh day of the eleventh month; do not on the last three days of the twelfth month fail to fast, burn incense, and call on the immortals. Such taboos are greatly forbidden by Heaven and Man, reported upon by the Three Offices, and are considered grievous crimes. Some cause the Three Souls to become afflicted, the Seven Spirits to scatter, or cause the embryonic spirit to hate, and the Three Palaces to suffer evil times. Hence evil dreams enter the cinnabar heart, demons ride upon the red gates, essence and fluid are offended, spirit and truth become confused, transformations are many and forbidden, and none know the taboo arts. If you can observe and cultivate these, then you are worthy of immortality; if you do not observe the heavenly prohibitions, you become one who is injured and defeated.

Those who study the Way, on the day of the autumnal equinox, should all preserve their true fasting and abstinence, not entertain evil thoughts, and their hearts should constantly desire to fly as immortals. The ancient spiritual men said: 'If you wish to ascend to Heaven, be careful on the autumnal equinox; sins great or small all are reported above; to seek immortality through sin is extremely difficult; therefore, those who study the Way have cold hearts.' This is the essential truth of the matter. If one is a long fasting Daoist, at noon on the autumnal equinox day, all should thank the seven ancestors and parents, and from below to the self repent for all sins, and vow self-reform. If not truly a nature utterly free from the world, be cautious on this day to confess sins; be cautious indeed.

Lord Qingtong said: You know that the sign of immortality is not urgent; you should also know that the signs of failure are secret essentials. The worldly turbid folk have only the bones and form—do they understand the path to saving the sign? Those who study the Way desire first to widely perform Yin virtues, to show compassion to all things, to save men in hardship, to deliver men from danger, to value the Way above wealth, to bestow kindness and spread virtue, not grudging treasures, casting them into poor places, opening the vow of true qi, with humble heart kneeling and requesting. Therefore the ancient supreme saying is: 'Tend the field of blessings, that you may ascend to immortality.'
