### The Scripture of the Jade Radiance of the Nine Heavens and Golden Firmament, the Mighty Divine King’s Blessing of the Great Origin

All who have predestined fates, and who are to receive this text, must enter into covenant, cutting their blood as a bond, and swear a solemn oath in the Nine Heavens, before transmitting it. According to the methods of the Supreme One of the Western Spirit, it is permitted within two thousand two hundred years to transmit it to three persons.

The talisman of the Great Tiger of the Jade Radiance of the Upper Origin is the inner spirit of the Mighty Divine King of the Nine Heavens and Golden Firmament; it unites the treasure writings of the two Radiances. The Dao is wondrous and supremely true; the qi mingles with the Upper Origin; treasured by the Jade Emperor and honoured by the myriad Emperors. Those who wear it command the spirit of the radiance, ascend the nine mornings, extinguish devils and demons, and control the myriad spirits. Those who see its writing all possess the emergence of true immortals, extending the blessings and felicities of seven generations. If after encountering a master who opens and imparts it, one endures the summer fast in bitter solitude, avoiding the dust of the world, then one may bear the talisman of the luminous descending spirit, solemnly commanding the inner spirit, shining forth in the great void, and moving the Three Pure Ones.

At this, the spirits and immortals prostrate themselves, the trials of calamity are extinguished, and the destiny is prolonged in secrecy and care. The overseers watch and observe the course of merits and faults. The Supreme One constantly commands the Western Spirit’s Great Armor of seventy million men and seven thousand divine tigers to guard the spirit kings of the radiance, attending the text at the Great Origin’s Western Jade Terrace.

The Spirit King of the Radiance is the inner name of the Supreme Golden Firmament Mighty Divine King. Those who know the name of the Mighty Divine King cause all lower ghosts and spirits to prostrate and submit to the destiny. This Divine King is the upper spirit of the Jade Essence of the Heavenly Origin, the true might of the Golden Firmament’s Divine Tiger. Therefore, whoever wears its writing obtains the power of the six heavens; holding its talisman, the Three Officials come as ministers; honoring its chamber, the Jade Blossoms hasten thither; reciting its blessing, the Divine Tiger opens the passage. Its might descends upon the eight voids, its spirit penetrates the nine mornings; it beheads the horde of demons, leaps against great treachery, commands the spirit of the mountains and rivers, subdues the sources of rivers and seas, roars and howls in the ten directions, commands the destinies of spirits and immortals; its lifespan equals the Three Luminaries; its power shines in the Great Origin. Truly, this is the wondrous writing of the Shangqing, the mighty seal of the Spirit of the Radiance.

Whoever is given this divine writing must be carefully selected. Those who have predestined affinity and secret communion, and who are indeed divided from immortals, then may they request the great master’s oral command, the dharma master’s recommendation, and the scripture master’s covenant, seeking the talismanic response of the divine spirit, and invoking the wondrous understanding of the qi, carefully discerning the subtle signs to decide the meeting, and activating its crucial mechanism. If one does not obey the great master’s command nor accept the dharma master’s recommendation, and yet rashly transmits it as a covenant, even if meeting the emergence of immortals, the jade name’s child, or the seven ancestors of the fate, they still shall be examined in the secret methods. Therefore, if transmitted without covenant, the scripture master will die, the soul be consigned to the Water Official, and the disciple suffer the test of heavenly fire. If covenanted but the scripture master is not diligent, he perishes in the bitter way, and the disciple undergoes the transformation of demons and devils. Hence the reverence for covenant and faith, and the oath not to lightly divulge it. Thus water and fire are the punishments of the other heavens; the nine demons are the beams of bitter poison; the soul is punished, cast down and examined in the great dark; though roaming at ease in the cave dwellings, begging the imperial spirit, yet ten thousand times will not open its fault; their petitions not heard; the seven mysteries are examined long in hell. Such is the hopefulness of immortals, the report of the heavenly laws, and the solemnity of fate.

If one would expel the ghosts and spirits of the six heavens, seize and strike the poison qi of misfortune and evil, and break the talisman temples, one must secretly employ the great blessing method of the Mighty Divine King. First, click the teeth thirty-six times, then summon the Spirit King of the Radiance; from within my Six Harmonies Cave Chamber, cause him to appear before the nose of the fate, one inch from the nose. The Spirit King of the Radiance is shaped seven inches long, wearing a white splendid morning crown, clad above and below in white brocade robes, mouth emitting golden true qi, resplendent as white clouds. Command the white cloud qi to flow and fan the four directions within, all caps surrounding the body of the fate and moving before it. Again, within the white smoke, suddenly a crimson essence shines forth, flying light, flashing like a meteor; swiftly it changes into several hundred divine tigers, leaping forward, and immediately shattering the ghosts and thieves caught. When completed, then bless:

The Supreme Bright Might, the inner truth of the Golden Firmament,  
The Spirit King of the Radiance emits qi to command the spirits,  
In the vast dwelling, the Lord of Heaven and his ministers,  
The radiance and smoke flow and shine, harmonizing the nine heavens,  
The mighty writing clearly manifests, the divine tiger opens the passage,  
The spiritual clouds gather thick, the crimson essence fans the void,  
Seven transformations of literary men, nine firmaments wield the truth,  
Who dares oppose me shall have their evil bodies severed,  
Calamity trials subdued, demons and wicked poison crushed and destroyed,  
Ten thousand demons extinguished, the twin radiances together stabilize with the Mighty King,  
Ascending the imperial morning, the Great Origin’s wonder and transcendence,  
Protects my virtue and purity.

When the blessing is finished, again click the teeth thirty-six times, then one may proceed to exterminate talismanic demons, subdue the myriad spirits, disperse the cold spirits of the six heavens. Thus thousands of demons and myriad poisons have already perished before the blessing is made.

This blessing of the Mighty King is already wonderously weighty, and is treasured by the high perfected ones. Its writing is all concealed in the upper Jade Clarity of the Nine Heavens, on the Great Origin’s Western Spirit Terrace. It is a treasured and forbidden method, not transmitted to the world, except as the great law of the Golden Name, Plumage, and Registry Kings. Those overflowing with profound celebration shall never see the great law of the Mighty King. Only those who occupy high positions among immortals, as nobles of the Shangqing and guests of the imperial morning, may bear and wear this talisman. When the fate merely performs the great blessing’s beginning, then the lofty origin rides the reins; the emperor dances in the firmament; the golden true forces swiftly execute; the Spirit King of the Radiance commands the court; the mysterious dragon breathes poison; the divine tiger roars on the right; ten thousand demons are beheaded and destroyed; thousands of demons and evils are cut down; the six heavens are thus overthrown; mountains and rivers bow in court; the Jade Blossom comes to the bedchamber; the purple child returns the banner; the Heavenly Emperor aids the might; the nine firmaments are serene and profound; evil poisons and cold are dispelled; water strikes and fire punishes; billions are swept away; the eight voids open wide. Thereupon the spirits are at peace and the qi in harmony, without obstruction or hindrance; the golden radiance and morning spirits unite in contract, obeying my divine talisman; the mysterious blessing endures ten thousand generations.

If the fate encounters hardships or sudden fear shakes the heart, then secretly call thrice the name of the Spirit King of the Radiance, and hold in mind his spirit as if there were guardians on the left and right; then a thousand perils and myriad calamities shall all be overcome; the wicked trials destroyed, demons and poisons all perish. Also when going to rest, regularly click twice and seven times, and recite the spirit’s name, causing the soul and spirit to be guarded and settled; corpses and ghosts are sealed; evil dreams removed; and misfortunes depart.

Those who transmit this text, the scripture master and disciples must fast and observe purity, declaring the covenant for twenty-one days, and then on the final day transmit the scripture. The covenant uses fine silk gauze and blue gauze, each thirty-seven feet long, and a pair of golden fish, each weighing one tael, as the sacred bond of the Supreme Western Spirit’s treasury method. These tokens must be returned and offered to the doors of the great master and dharma master, to maintain the public use of the divine spirits. If secretly cut for one’s own support, greedily profiting, not following the heavenly law’s covenant; when first boasting great faith at the beginning of the covenant, the scripture master and the seven mysteries’ ancestors will be tortured in the Northern Ocean’s prison, never attaining the fruit of immortality.

The method of bearing this talisman is to write it in vermilion on white silk, three feet long, and bind it in a purple brocade pouch, and carry it before the heart. When wishing to perform the divine blessing, it must be worn.

Those who wear this talisman command the ghosts and spirits of heaven and earth, expel and strike the cold spirits of the six heavens, and slay the wicked qi of the nine demons. Their fate is prolonged in heaven and earth; they oversee the high immortals at the Supreme Pole; the spirit talisman descends upon the body; they display the great law of the Mighty King; the divine officials bow; golden soldiers assist defence; water and fire both pass through; trials are seen long. Therefore, the Three Officials and the Northern Emperor dare not make a breach in its midst.

Those who have received and obey the divine writing keep it as a treasured register and for court rites only; it must not be casually worn in the human world. If the treasured writing is lightly divulged, and if the name of the Mighty King is proclaimed, the Supreme One will have already tortured the seven mysteries’ ancestors, seen them devoured by the Divine Tiger’s mouth; the soul and fetus of the fate will also be sealed in hell; body and life both perish by the punishments of water and fire; within seven hundred years they will be reborn as warts and sores, afflicted with the evil disease of leprosy among the nine clans of kindred. If the two masters lightly act upon such a person, and disciples rashly accept the writing, the same punishment will befall them.

If one would ascend to immortality, one must wear the luminous descending spirit talisman, and pay court at the upper palace. Written in vermilion on white silk, seven feet long, fashioned into a plaque five inches wide, like a sash. With white gauze or green silk one cubit four feet long, as an inner garment, likewise according to talismanic methods, worn about the waist. This is called the phoenix pattern tiger sash of the luminous descending seven origins. Those who fast and observe purity wear it on days of court ceremonies.

### The Luminous Descending Talisman

### The True Golden Tiger Talisman of the Heavenly Emperor of the Supreme Subtle Heaven

The True Golden Tiger Talisman of the Heavenly Emperor of the Supreme Subtle Heaven is stored in the Great Origin’s Upper Radiance Jade Palace. The poisonous beasts number ten thousand fathoms; striking demons and guarding the scripture, the seven thousand divine tigers are arrayed in the Jade Palace; three hundred Western Floral Jade Maidens scatter fragrance in the firmament court; the Five Elders’ classic books; the golden morning attendants serve the true. Without the Jade Register and Jade Name, and the engraved slips of the Three Pure Ones, none may obtain the inner Golden Tiger talisman, nor hear the Supreme One’s jade writings. This talisman is originally engraved in the Shangqing jade slips of the Wisdom chapter, containing seven hundred thousand characters; spiritual sound, wondrous Dao, subtle meaning difficult to explain; sometimes revealing heavenly demons’ secret names, sometimes explaining the inner names of myriad spirits, sometimes expounding the profound and obscure mysteries in the jade sound. A certain Wang lord copied out this talisman, and the method of the mighty divine inner writings, to command the spirits of heaven and earth; with only one hundred characters. This blessing is wondrous and secret, named the Three Heaven Tiger Writings of the Great Origin’s Upper Register. Those who receive it must first fast seventy days, bringing the golden tiger jade bell, white silk, and mysterious gauze, each thirty feet long, as the golden truth’s vow, covenanting with heaven and earth not to transgress. According to the bright methods of the Four Extremities, three persons may be permitted transmission within seven hundred years.

The True Golden Tiger Jade Essence Talisman of the Heavenly Emperor of the Supreme Subtle Heaven is the inner fragrance of the natural golden seal of the Great Origin’s Upper Radiance. It commands golden immortals, seals mountains and summons clouds, shakes the six heavens with awe, and beheads the myriad spirits. The Supreme One constantly commands the Western Spirit’s Great Armor of seven hundred thousand men to guard the talisman in the Supreme Subtle Jade Palace. Those who wear this talisman wield power over heaven and earth, rebuke the myriad spirits, control the radiance dragon, hold office over high immortals; when the jade sound resounds, the Jade Blossoms stand ready, golden true guards and soldiers, thousands of demons lose their eyes, myriad ghosts perish in form; the nine demons lead in submission, the six heavens are overthrown; the Dao is wondrous and supremely true, the spirits multiply the five essences; at the left roars the mysterious child; at the right commands the golden morning. Great is this treasured writing, the supreme emperor’s mighty truth; is it merely to repel poison and exorcise trials, and to extinguish demons? Nay, it is the wondrous product of seeking immortality, the standard of attaining truth.

The golden tiger true talisman on the right was transmitted by the Heavenly Emperor of the Supreme Subtle Heaven to the Golden Palace Emperor. Written in vermilion on white silk, requested to be carried in a purple brocade pouch, worn on the head when going forth; then it commands and controls the spirits of heaven and earth, the immortals reverently obey it; the Jade Blossoms scatter their scarves; the heavenly soldiers guard the body; mountain troops watch the spirits; with added command of the blessing of the Mighty God, and the seal of the Jade Essence, one obtains the beheading and delight, the nine demons and thousands of demons lose their form. This is a Shangqing forbidden talisman, not transmitted to the world; those who obtain it ascend to Shangqing.

The inner blessing of the Golden True Mighty Spirit of the Great Origin’s Upper Radiance commands the right divine soldiers to slay and destroy the evil souls. When entering the chamber to burn incense, click the teeth thirty-six times, sit or recline at will, then bless it:

Repel the King of Poison of the Heaven of Qian,  
Shake the banners of the collecting Luo,  
The Eight Immortals wield the battle-axe,  
The Five Spirits of the Supreme Emperor,  
The Great Profound causes the radiance to fall,  
The Seven Mornings guard the court,  
The Yellow True shining talisman,  
Shining and casting the fire bell,  
The Divine Tiger fiercely roars,  
The poisonous blades wildly display,  
The Purple Bo writes the ceremony,  
Four leaps cry aloft,  
Nine Heavens and Six Heavens,  
The Four Heavens are bright and pure,  
Outside entwines mysterious qi,  
Inside guards the master’s soldiers,  
Left commands and right looks back,  
Wind strikes and fire punishes,  
Shouting to slay ten thousand demons,  
Beheading and crushing a thousand spirits,  
The golden heaven’s mighty power shakes,  
The nine demons seize the form and send it to the northern Feng,  
Overthrowing and destroying all that is extinguished,  
I wear the true talisman and thereby command myriad spirits,  
The Three Origins announce to the birds and the mysterious emperor’s sincerity,  
The Supreme Subtle commands on high,  
Ascending to the Three Pure Ones.

The method of the inner blessing of the Golden True Mighty Spirit of the Great Origin’s Upper Radiance is all forbidden scripture of the Shangqing. The King of Poison of the Heaven of Qian is the inner name of the great ghost of the six heavens. The shaking banner of the collecting Luo is the secret name of the Northern Emperor’s demon king’s mind. The Four Heavens bright and pure is the soul name of the Northern Feng ghost’s appearance. Those who know the names of the three ghosts cause the thousand demons to flee and hide, the myriad ghosts to conceal their forms, the nine demons to be powerless to act; observe how they cannot appear. Whether alone in the mountains and forests, or among the talisman temples of gods and ghosts, one may carry out affairs according to the method, without need to burn incense or enter the chamber.

Also, written in orpiment on blue gauze, three feet long and one foot two inches wide, it may be square or round one foot two inches as well. With vermilion bordering the outside in four edges, and edged with cinnabar brocade, wrapped and worn on the right side of the waist. When one first ascends the fast and enters the chamber, and at the court feast of the eight origins, simultaneously commanding demons and summoning spirits, driving and directing divine truths, one shall wear and proceed in action. Care must be taken not to face corpses or filth, lest the guilt be the same as for leaking the secret; the seven mysteries’ ancestors will be tortured in hell.

Thus ends the Scripture of the Jade Radiance of the Nine Heavens and Golden Firmament, the Mighty Divine King’s Blessing of the Great Origin.
