### Supreme Scripture of the Purple Writings of the Ling of Taiwei: The Langgan Splendour of the Elixir of the True Spirit, Upper Scripture

First, one must fast forty days in the mountain forest, keeping aloof from external affairs; then proceed to make the divine clay, and continue for a hundred days until the clay cauldron is completed. Take a kiln-fired earthen cauldron, capable of holding three dou, white and red without spots, only requiring it to endure fire without cracking or breaking. The method for making the divine clay is as follows: six parts of oyster shells from the East Sea, gathered on the left side; three parts of earth of the fenmou (a small mole-like creature); one part of finely shed horse hair; three parts of talc; three parts of red bole; two parts of fine sheep wool; half a part of large water chestnut; these seven substances are combined, pounded, then sifted finely, mixed with a hundred-day ferment, and pounded thirty thousand strokes. If the clay is too soft, add more red bole; if too hard, add more ferment, then pound again until a fine clay paste is formed, suitable for decoration and tempering, making it most refined and fine.

One must select oyster shells wrapped in white, not using the outer bone skin. First wash and select horse and sheep hair, then separately sift the fenmou earth, all to be made pure and free from coarseness and filth. The divisions are not made by weight but by sufficient quantity of clay to fill two cauldrons, for combining the substances equally and proportionately. The clay on the inside and outside of the two cauldrons is to be made seven fen thick. This must be done gradually: first a thin layer of clay, dried in shade until dry, then add more clay, gradually reaching seven fen thickness. When the clay on the inside and outside of the cauldrons is seven fen thick, dry it, then mix ferment with cinnabar, and pound thirty thousand strokes until it becomes like clay. Apply this clay three fen thick inside and on top of the two cauldrons. If cracking appears, add more clay, dry in shade for ten days, ensuring no cracks form. The cinnabar is lead cinnabar; do not apply this clay on the outer surface.

When the application of the medicines is completed, it must be solid and dense; sew the clay finely to close all seams, stopping all joints to keep it hermetically sealed. Then apply more clay to the outside, top and bottom, and on all four sides, four fen thick; after completion, dry in shade and place in a secure place for twenty-seven days. If fine cracks appear outside, use sheep whiskers as a brush to paint the clay, then dry for another seven days. Then the outer surface should be about one inch and four or five fen thick, which is excellent. Thus is the making of the divine clay cauldron and the placing of the medicines therein completed.

This clay method is more economical than the ninefold refining of the Golden Liquid cauldron, but the clay must be made extremely fine and pure, with careful tempering and appropriate proportion, more skillful than the ninefold cauldron. Be careful and exact so as not to allow the essence to leak or disperse; if it leaks, it is of no benefit and the effort in fasting and preparation is lost.

According to the lunar cycle and day, fast another hundred days; after completion, cast three dou of clear wine into the eastern flowing water, and standing by the water say:

'O Supreme Mystic Azure Stream, Eight Seas and Nine Rivers, Mountain Spirits and Earth Deities, Above protect the elixir's essence. Three dou of fine wine, carefully offered to the river spirits.' Having finished the offering, do not look back, then on that day place the medicines into the cauldron.

When making the elixir, it is best to be in the mountain forest by the eastern flowing waters, in a place where human footsteps rarely reach, and where the cocks and dogs’ cries are not heard; this is excellent. Be cautious.

The kinds of medicines for the Langgan Splendour of the Elixir are as follows:

- Ten jin of Jiangling Zhu’er, the secret name is Cinnabar.
- Five jin of Dan Mountain Sun Soul, the secret name is Realgar.
- One jin of White Simple Flying Dragon, the secret name is White Quartz.
- Five liang of Green Waist Middle Lady, the secret name is Sky Blue.
- Five liang of Purple Mountain Wenhous, the secret name is Purple Quartz.
- Five liang of Bicheng Flying Splendour, the secret name is Stone Indigo.
- One jin of Northern Emperor’s Mysterious Pearl, the secret name is Niter.
- Five liang of Nine Spirits Yellow Boy, the secret name is Sulphur Stone.
- Five liang of Five Spirits Golden Sheep, the secret name is Yang Qi Stone Core.
- Five liang of Rain Splendour Flying Essence, the secret name is Mica.
- Five liang of White Tiger Shedding Teeth, the secret name is Golden Tooth Stone.
- One jin of Flowing Cinnabar White Paste, the secret name is White Lead.
- Five liang of Reversed Walking Divine Bone, the secret name is Rong Salt.
- Five jin of Mysterious Terrace Moon Splendour, the secret name is Orpiment.

Altogether fourteen kinds. In order, pound separately, beginning with cinnabar, each pounded five thousand strokes. The pounders must be temperate and cautious, without much talk. First fast thirty days, then begin pounding. When combining the medicines, only three or four persons may be present, for such persons are hard to find with one mind; if one disagrees, the matter is spoiled. When the elixir is completed, one liang constitutes one immortal dose; if one wishes to dwell in the world, half a liang may be taken.

When all medicines have been pounded separately and placed into the cauldron, first place the Rong Salt, spread evenly on the bottom; next place the Niter, then Mica, then Yang Qi Stone, then Golden Tooth Stone, then White Lead, then Sky Blue, then Sulphur Stone, then White Quartz, then Stone Indigo, then Purple Quartz, then Orpiment, then Realgar, and last of all cinnabar. Cinnabar alone is on the top.

When all fourteen kinds are placed, they should be spread evenly and fully fill the cauldron, slightly pressing each layer thinly upon the other. Then pour three jin of mercury over the medicines; when completed, place the outer earthen cauldron, applying cinnabar clay to its flat rim, oyster shell clay to its outer rim, dry in shade, then apply clay fully outside, top and bottom, and all four sides, four fen thick.

For the furnace house, first excavate the earth, remove the filthy soil three chi deep, then add good earth, filling it fully. Then on the level earth build the foundation, raising it two chi and five cun high. Do not build the furnace upon old tombs or remains of former habitations; place it alone. The furnace house should be three zhang long, one zhang six chi wide, and one zhang six chi high, clean and well constructed and guarded, covered with good grass on clay walls inside and out, making it firm and dense. The main doors face due east and due south, each four chi wide, to be closed at night.

The fire tender and master remain in the room; place an ao (a giant turtle) under the centre of the house; the furnace mouth faces east; build with good bricks and stones. Mix bitter wine and eastern flowing water, pound and mix fine white earth with hair of cattle, horses, deer and roe deer to form clay, and make the furnace with it. Inside the furnace place an iron tripod, upon which place the medicine cauldron, situating the cauldron in the centre of the furnace. Leave three cun and a half from the cauldron to the furnace walls on all sides. The furnace’s height is two chi above the cauldron, and the cauldron is one chi eight cun above the ground.

Use good chaff fire beneath to burn, leaving about one chi space below the cauldron, adjusting and watching the fire so that it is not violent. After twenty days, reduce the fire to six cun below the cauldron; after another twenty full days, reduce it to four cun below; after another twenty full days, reduce it to one cun below; ten days later, bring the fire near the cauldron; ten days later, half the cauldron is heated. Continue for another twenty full days; altogether one hundred days, and the medicine is complete. Then cool it for three days before opening it. The flying splendour will lightly cover the top of the cauldron; sweep it with feathers of a three-year-old rooster. The splendour should display thirty-seven colours, flying and flowing in profusion, with purple mists and mysterious radiance, called Langgan Splendour Elixir.

On the morning of the new moons of the eleventh, fourth, and eighth months, facing the king, bow twice, and take one liang of it with the eastern flowing water; immediately the head will emit seven-coloured qi, the face will have a golden radiance and jade-like reflection; upon holding breath, one is at once borne on the chariot of the eight mysterious (forces); if one spits to the ground, it transforms into a flying dragon; a left whistle calls forth immortals to court; a right finger summons the three pure winds, with thousands of chariots and myriad riders flying to the Upper Purity. If the elixir splendour has not fully risen, one may again seal the two edges of the clay as before, making it tight, reheat the belly of the cauldron, and wait forty-nine days without further disturbance; then all will be accomplished.

### Method of the Yellow Water Moon Splendour Elixir

Fire the cauldron for a hundred days until the Langgan Splendour Elixir is formed. When the elixir is formed, do not open it; instead begin firing anew as at the first making of the splendour elixir, following the method of the fire’s advance and retreat in small increments, for another hundred days. Combined with the former hundred days, totaling two hundred days, cool it for six nights, then open it and observe. The myriad essences will have gathered above the cauldron forming a curtain, within the curtain is yellow water, and the water has yellow splendour resembling the lotus flower, called Yellow Water Moon Splendour. The curtain hangs above the cauldron like the mysterious gall bladder. Gather and take it; to eat the splendour and drink one sheng of yellow water will change the form in myriad transformations, the eyes become the bright moon, floating and wandering in the great spaces, flying to the Purple Star Upper Palace.

### Method of the Circulating Water Jade Essence Elixir

Fire the medicine cauldron for two hundred days, transforming into Yellow Water Moon Splendour; do not open it. Begin firing anew as before for another one hundred days, totaling three hundred days. Cool for nine nights, then open it; the myriad essences form buds above the cauldron, within the buds is white water, like jade paste, moving and flowing constantly leftward within the bud. Within the white water are three bright pearls, each as large as a chicken egg, called Circulating Water Jade Essence. Its flavour is a hundredfold sweetness, fragrant and soft like maltose. To take one pearl is to become one with Heaven; the body produces water and fire; spitting breath forms jade; the form transforms into the sun; the Heavenly Emperor descends to welcome, riding the radiance to ascend to the Upper Purity.

Dig a pit seven chi deep and wide; take Langgan Splendour Elixir, mix with circulating water like a chicken egg in size, plant it in the pit, restore the earth, and build it firmly for three years. On it grows a tree, red as a jujube, three or four chi high, its fruit like a ring, called the Langgang Tree. Eating its fruit one becomes one with Heaven, ascending to the Great Ultimate, transforming into clouds, also called the Hidden Spirit of the Great Ultimate.

Dig a pit six chi deep and wide; take one ring-shaped fruit, plant it, irrigate with five he of yellow water, restore the earth, build firmly for three years. On it grows grass like gourds, its fruit like peaches with five colours, called the Phoenix Brain Spirit. Eating its fruit one ascends to the Great Ultimate, spitting to the ground transforms into a phoenix, able to ride the phoenix to soar, also called the Hidden Spirit of the Great Ultimate.

Dig a pit one zhang deep and wide; take four he of yellow water and one phoenix brain fruit, plant together, irrigate the fruit with yellow water, restore the earth, build firmly for three years. On it grows a red tree like pine, five or six chi high, its fruit like pears, the seeds pure white like jade. Eating its fruit one ascends to Taiwei, spitting to the ground transforms into green jade.

Dig a pit eight chi deep and wide; plant red tree seeds, irrigate with five he of circulating water, restore the earth, build firmly for three years. On it grows a crimson tree like plum, six or seven chi high, bearing blue fruit like jujubes, of blue like turquoise. Eating its fruit one ascends to the Purple Star, spitting to the ground transforms into gold, gaining the power to ride the mysterious clouds in flight.

### Method of the Water Yang Green Reflecting Liquid

Take one sheng five he each of yellow water and circulating water, combine to three sheng, then separately boil in a small iron vessel seven times to a boil, until it changes and combines into green water, called Water Yang Green Reflecting. At dawn drink it all at once; the body will have the light of green jade, the mouth will emit purple smoke, ascending to the Upper Purity; spitting to the ground transforms into cinnabar eight shi. Boil one jin of lead and two liang of mercury in an iron vessel until very boiling; throw one zhu of Langgan Splendour Elixir in, after a short while consuming it transforms into true silver. Boil one jin of lead and five liang of mercury in an iron vessel until very boiling; throw three zhu of Langgan Splendour Elixir in, after a short while consuming it transforms into purple gold. When gold and silver are formed, throw each a hundred jin into the eastern flowing water, making each into a cake weighing fifty jin, standing by the water recite:

'O Heavenly River Weaver Girl, Earth Stream Water Lord, Supreme Elixir forms splendour, Immortal soul refines the spirit, Long ascending from earth, becoming Imperial Guest, bearing two precious discs to guard source and marsh.' After the prayer, depart without looking back.

To plant the divine tree, one must be in the shade of a famous mountain, making a pit, clearing all traces of men and beasts from the pit.

The August Supreme Lord of the Upper Purity, from youth studying the Way, having received and practised secret essentials, attained to be the emperor of the Golden Palace. The Five Elders, Highest Truths, the Left Wearied Duke of the Great Ultimate, compiled and gathered the "Purple Writings of the Ling," commanding the Eastern Palace Green Youth Lord to bring down and engrave the mysterious names, to be for the true immortals. These are the highest secret words of the Supreme, the purple writings of the later saint. The laws of the Four Extremities and Bright Sciences of the Holy Lords may be transmitted only within seven hundred years, and only through three transmissions. If within a hundred years there are two persons fit to be taught, they shall be taught, sworn to three transmissions within seven hundred years; if the limit is exceeded, none may be further taught. At the time of transmission, one must fast seven days before receiving.

The Upper Ling True Officials, Jade Maidens and Jade Youth each ten persons, attend the scripture and guard the writings, overseeing merits and faults, sharply reprimanding merits and demerits. Those who learn to be immortals must be wise and cautious from the beginning. The laws require making alliances and pledges, as a covenant of non-disclosure. The transmissions of the Saints’ annals, ceremonial robes for swallowing the essence and mist, receiving luminous Yin and Yang, and the Celestial Emperor’s symbolic talismans, as well as the Supreme Scripture of Soul Capture and Spirit Constraining, are accompanied by a forty chi white silk scroll, two pairs of silver rings, and four liang of fine silk, as a substitute for blood oaths, to seal secrecy and non-disclosure. To receive the "Langgan Splendour Elixir True Spirit Upper Scripture," the laws require two scripture masters, Golden Dragon and Jade Fish, to substitute for the engraved stone oath of non-leakage.

The ancient Supreme Emperors all preserved these precious divine scriptures, guarding against their careless disclosure, thus attaching great importance to the solemn oaths, urging their secrecy, showing their sincerity and revealing their origins. Those who do not observe the laws and reveal the secret purple writings of the later saint’s annals shall, by the Three Ancestors and parents, while alive, suffer punishment by water and fire; after death, be examined by the Three Officials, their bodies becoming inferior ghosts, their immortal records erased, their names inscribed on the stone of Bei Qi, appended to Mount Tai, their ashes cast into the western ferry waters and carried to the Eastern Sea. Let all be cautious.

The medicines are all named by ancient terms, refined to the utmost now.

The Green Youth Lord, named Fanmei, is preserved every eight festival days.

The King says: The oaths of Golden Dragon and Jade Fish are rare indeed, and these things cannot be revealed or transmitted after the time has passed. The foregoing is made with thirty chi of blue cloth as a standard oath. Blue signifies refining the mind; cloth signifies spreading sincerity.
