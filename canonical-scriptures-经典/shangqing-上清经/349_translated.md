### Supreme Clarity Origin of Transformation Precious True Highest Scripture of the Nine Spirits, Most Sublime Turtle Mountain Mysterious Register, Scroll One

The Supreme Clarity Precious Scripture, establishing from the beginning of the Nine Heavens, all arise naturally, coexisting with Qi. The three lights shine together, revealing above the Nine Heavens, amidst the Great Void. Sometimes ethereal dark purple Qi condenses to form spiritual characters; the heavenly script is exquisite, the strokes winding and turning, each character measuring one zhang square, difficult to seek and examine. Except for the True Kings of the Nine Heavens, none can understand their profound meanings. Above the Nine Heavens, in the first year of the Void Origin, the Supreme True of the Mysterious Capital was commanded to cast gold into slips; numerous sages clarified meanings and lofty secret formulas, compiling spiritual chapters. The Jade Emperor inscribed and carved the slips into chapters, arranging them in a hierarchy of restrictions and orders, the titles fully expressing the subtle meanings of the high sages. They were sealed on high above the Nine Heavens, within the great palatial jade chambers, guarded by the Western Flower Jade Maidens, the Pure Spirit Palace Golden Morning Purple Youths.

The Western Turtle Mountain, also called Dragon Mountain, is the root and bond of the Nine Heavens, the abyssal repository of myriad Qi, situated at the northwest corner of the sky, circling four hundred thousand li, reaching to the Jade Clarity border. To the southeast it connects with the rosy mists of Yang, ascending to the gate of the Azure Palace Divine Tiger; northwest it intersects the cold caverns’ wilderness, connecting to the Golden Pavilion of the immortals; south it reaches the land of the Great Elixir Floating Dawn, the Qi harmonized with the light of the Cavern Yang; north it points to Gou Chen, intersecting the Floral Canopy, the Qi treading the broad spirit. The center shoots straight to the peak of the Wind-Intersecting Mountains of the Jade Capital Eight Ways. The flat heavens span thirty thousand li, all walls made of gold, doors formed of jade; golden terraces and jade towers, twelve divine palaces. Above is the Hall of Naturally Flowing Essence, Purple Pavilion Golden Splendour, the Room of Jades and Gems, beside which communicates the Nine Cavities’ grotto, naturally generating purple clouds of Qi, entwined with phoenix patterns, nine colors falling in array. The cliffs bear purple laurels, the ridges display jade forests, coral forms into branches, jade roots planted, soaring trees bearing fruit, red children white rings, three splendours shining blossoms in red light, emitting fragrance flowing in the Great Mysterious, eight Qi fan the long winds, jade sounds singing in the void, dragons roaring in cloud towers, phoenixes whistling over lofty ridges, poisonous beasts myriad, serpents thousands of zhangs, the divine palaces magnificent, cloud immortals numerous, majestic primordial halls, touching types emitting nectar. This is indeed the wonderful transformation of the Origin Primordial, truly the spiritual root of Heaven’s Origin. In the Hall of Golden Splendour, above the northern window spontaneously arises purple Qi, forming mysterious patterns, characters one zhang square, radiating beams bright and clear, the heavenly script exquisite, impossible to seek in detail. The Nine Heavens Elder, formerly at the first year of the Upper Armor, purified in the Cloud Palace, feasted at Turtle Mountain, and there inscribed golden slips, faithfully copied the mysterious patterns, explaining their stagnations, unfolding their spiritual sound, recording: Turtle Mountain Elixir Sovereign Flying Mysterious Purple Script. The Western Queen Mother, on the first year of Kaihuang, on the upper yin day of the first month, rode the void to roam the spirits, wandering the Nine Skies, peacefully fasting at Turtle Mountain, ascending the Hall of Naturally Flowing Essence, Purple Pavilion Golden Splendour Jade Hall, viewing the northern window, performing homage to the mysterious script, gazing at the cliff contemplating the spirit, mind imagining the Supreme True. Thereupon, wondrous response and mysterious awakening, the red heart made manifest; suddenly a heavenly true great god appeared, bearing sun and moon, shoulders bearing round radiance, flanked by a company of immortals’ feathered canopies, riding a flying chariot of purple clouds and nine essences streaming heavenward, kneeling before the Queen Mother, saying: “I am the Lord of the Nine Heavens Phoenix Palace Leading Immortal Kings, surname Supreme Mysterious, styled Enlightened. By command of the Primordial Heavenly King, I carry the Nine Heavens golden book with purple characters, blue gold Elixir Sovereign’s text, descending to confer on the Queen Mother. Bestowed the title Western Epoch Nine Spirits Supreme True Immortal Mother, enfeoffed over the Western Turtle Mountain. Also conferred a pure scroll, the Supreme True Origin of Transformation Original Register, overseeing the immortal rolls, inheriting the Jade Clarity. Also gave a plate of blue jade, providing the Nine Heavens Phoenix robe of flying blue feathers, crowned with a jade infant phoenix cloud shoes, divine phoenix purple wheel flying feather canopy of twenty-four chariots, five-colored banners commanding the spirit’s festival. Moreover, bestowed seven hundred women of the Upper Palace Golden Splendour Jade Maidens to attend the Immortal Mother, guarding the Hall of Flowing Essence Purple Pavilion Golden Splendour Jade Hall of the Western Turtle Mountain. Three times a month ascend Jade Clarity, twice feast on Kunlun, reviewing and correcting the assembly of immortals. Thereupon the heavenly true great god completes his teaching and returns to the Jade Palace. The Immortal Mother thereupon accepts the mandate, ascends the seat, announces the fast in the Jade Hall, commands attendant maidens Wangzi Deng, Dong Shuangcheng, and others, with divine light and brocade scarves, solemnly receiving the golden book with purple characters and blue jade plate, the blue gold Elixir Sovereign’s inscribed text, Supreme True Origin of Transformation Original Register, flying mysterious purple script, altogether four matters, sealed with the Elixir Sovereign’s seal, stored in the Room of Jades and Gems. Commands the Golden Splendour Jade Maidens and Purple Morning Jade Youths, thirty each, to guard the spiritual script. In accordance with the old ritual of the Three Heavens’ order, the hierarchy of bowing and raising, reporting to the Five Emperors and the Five Sacred Mountains, spirits of mountains, rivers, and seas as true gods, all command the monthly five reports of student names, distinguishing merits and faults, reporting according to rank. The Immortal Mother regularly on the eight festivals, and five times a month, feasts in the Cloud Palace, then visits the Five Mountains, traverses the river sources, tours the Eight Extremes. At such times, the five stars emerge, the sun and moon pause their light, a hundred yangs excite lightning, flowing gold shining essence, heavenly soldiers lead the way, Five Elders carry banners; the Immortal Mother always rides the chariot of nine colors, purple clouds, flying wheels, accompanied by five thousand celestial jade maidens. The women ride phoenixes, the men drive dragons, flying immortal feather robes, all holding splendid banners, pipes, flutes, drums, united in harmonious sound, phoenixes sing and dragons roar, stirring bright clouds, splendid lights interweaving, the three lights combined, purple youths waft incense to dispel filth, divine consorts scatter flowers to sprinkle the true, the heavenly balance sounds their banners, purple smoke veils the empty courtyard, jade radiance flows in the great void, divine transformations restrain myriad spirits. At this time, the Six Heavens obey the decree, the myriad demons bind their forms, the Zoroastrian demons lose their sight, the sky is clear and the air pure; this is the wondrous vision of the High Immortal, marking the Elixir Sovereign’s Inner Spirit.

Turtle Mountain Elixir Sovereign Flying Mysterious Purple Script

Flying mysterious purple Qi condenses the spiritual root, the framework of jade void governs myriad spirits. The void is luxuriant and dense, natural formation above, there are twelve precipitous passes, jade towers high, leaping into the clouds, flowing essence purple pavilion bearing golden verandas, jade halls splendidly shining encircled by eight beams, issuing forth the blue gold Nine Spirits Immortals. The Elixir Sovereign True Mother is called Essence Extender, flying with blue feathered Xie-horns, clutching jade tablets on the left, grasping spiritual banners on the right, five-colored commanding demons, facing the Emperor with reverence, holding the registers at the Gate of Life, chewing moon, biting sun, sipping jade springs, exhaling silk to emit radiance, refining five souls, filling within and overflowing in the Red Mansion with joy. Golden light dazzling, shape perfectly round, entering from the north, entering the golden chaos. Only the Enlightened understand these words, on the tenth day of the fifth month of the Northern Origin, carving seen on the Floral Canopy the Leader of Immortal Lords, purple Qi circling left and moving with the Dipper, passing through twenty-eight constellations, returning to the Golden Gate. Truly the Elixir Sovereign inspects myriad immortals, with clear secret formulas and diligence, dividing the forms with careful thought, wondrous scenes responding to gatherings, receiving the essential text. Within three years one must confirm and preserve complete health; within nine years one ascends the void, wearing feathered skirts and phoenix robes, flying lightly to Dragon Mountain, bowing to the Nine Spirits, visiting the Jade Morning.

The Lord of the Southern Extreme Supreme Origin says: This is the scripture of flying mysterious purple Qi, carved on the Western Turtle Mountain, above the northern window of the Hall of Flowing Essence Purple Pavilion Golden Splendour Jade Hall. The Nine Heavens Elder has examined the chapter, recording it as the "Turtle Mountain Elixir Sovereign Flying Mysterious Purple Script." The Western Queen Mother always treasures it secretly; its meaning is profound and hidden, all are the exquisite rhythms of the Nine Heavens, not bearing immortal names, nor can one measure its chapters. Those who obtain it all record it in the Nine Heavens, titling it Turtle Mountain.

The Nine Heavens Elder says: Cultivate the Way, constantly in the months of the first, second, third, fourth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, eleventh, twelfth, and tenth month of the year; on the third, fifth, ninth, fifteenth, twenty-fifth days of the month, five times a month; purify and chant the text once over. After midnight, when the dew appears in the courtyard, look up to the Dipper’s Floral Canopy, where purple cloud Qi proceeds from the left of the Dipper's girdle, passing through twenty-eight constellations, returning to the Golden Gate above. If amidst men the sky is dark and without light, one should silently meditate indoors, contemplating within as above, each part made clear. After thought, one should bow to the purple cloud four times, knock the teeth thrice, and look upward to pray, saying:

Heaven at night is bright and clear, the hidden void opens the true; flowing clouds linger, golden splendour in four quarters; the Elixir Sovereign spreads radiance, spirits fly in purple verandas. Tonight open the array, blue gold confers immortality, fulfill my highest wishes, embody and respond to nature, form the life moon's radiance, preserve the year’s root, the three spirits combine the light, forever rest at Dragon Mountain. In the secret night’s fold, please as spoken. Finished, then orally draw in purple Qi twenty-eight times and stop. Doing this for three years, there will be signs of divine true descent at the sleeping place. The body will have purple Qi, shining in form, the Nine Heavens’ name inscribed; surely one will ascend to immortality.

The Nine Heavens Elder says: The heavenly scripts are manyfold, each discussing its marvel; such matters suffice to cause spiritual true descent, to spread wings in the Nine Skies, to soar to the Jade Clarity, and feast in the Cloud Palace. Without such wondrous methods, the Western Queen Mother would not keep it secret in her bosom, nor would the Great Have understand its restrictions.

The Lord of the Southern Extreme Supreme Origin says: Heaven has clouds of forbidden Qi, separating the sun, moon, and five stars; in their respective directions and lands are men who unite with the Way, those who gain immortality’s lordship. Thus their signs appear naturally.

The Nine Heavens Elder says: Upon seeing these clouds, one should perform the ritual prayers according to the text; it need not be on the usual days. Diligence in mind will cause the clouds to descend, rising and gathering in meeting. It may be sealed in the heart, not lightly shown to others; if the Way leaks, the spirit disperses, and immortals have no chance to respond.

The Origin Primordial bestows the Blue Gold Elixir Sovereign Jade Script

The Most High Origin Primordial reports to the spirits of the Nine Heavens Great Void Ancestors. The Queen Mother’s name is Wanqin; truly the Qi of the Nine Spirits of Heaven, mixing the essence of the Western Gold, forming bone by the purple clouds, refining the radiance of the sun’s essence, breathing the splendour of the seven luminaries, harmonizing the morning glow and feeding on the sun's phoenix marrow, inhaling the moon’s essence and orchid brain, condensing in jade roots and golden storehouses, binding the red form, manifesting in the Elixir Sovereign’s wondrous charts, high arrayed in the Emperor’s pavilion, resting in the spiritual mountain, clearing the heart, achieving merit among myriad beings, bestowing blessings and overflowing with life, wielding discipline alone, enduring through kalpas. Hence it causes the Most High to bestow the curved splendour, the Origin Primordial bestows it. Because Wanqin possesses the virtue of gold truth, she is bestowed the title of Meditation Western Epoch Nine Spirits Supreme True Immortal Mother, Blue Gold Elixir Sovereign, enfeoffed over Turtle Mountain, overseeing the original register. According to the bowing and raising on the blue jade plate with golden characters, gives the Nine Heavens Phoenix robe of flying blue feathers, crowned with jade infant phoenix cloud shoes, divine phoenix purple wheel flying feather canopy of twenty-four chariots, five-colored banners commanding the spirit’s festival, flowing gold fire bells illuminating in the night, extinguishing demons’ jade seals of the Nine Heavens’ magnificent trust, guarding the Upper Palace Western Flower Jade Maidens seven hundred, managing the Flowing Essence Purple Pavilion Golden Splendour Palace of Turtle Mountain, thrice a month ascending Jade Clarity, twice feasting Kunlun, correcting the assembly of immortals, the Five Sacred Mountains, rivers, seas, and ten directions spiritual officers, none not governed, according to the complete instructions. All rituals follow the ancient rites of the Jade Terrace Great Have, and the Three Heavens’ correct texts.

Carrying out the Blue Jade plate with golden characters

The Blue Jade plate with golden characters, the Blue Gold Elixir Sovereign inscription, all come from the Great Have Palace of the Nine Heavens, arranged in bowing and raising; all form the exalted mysterious emptiness and natural chapters, to be confirmed by the Supreme True high sage offices, not used by novices. The Eastern Golden Pavilion and Eastern Flower Palace also have rituals, to summon novices who ascend as flying immortals. This all comes from the Great Have order, but differing in rank and precedence as to high and low. Without famous names in the Nine Heavens, or recorded in the registers, one never sees the chapters. Those who see these writings all inscribe slips for the next life, listing images in the emperor’s registers, destined to become gods and immortals, thus inscribed in spiritual order. When the Way is completed, there will naturally be descent of heavenly truth to receive these scripts and inscriptions.

The Lord of the Southern Extreme Supreme Origin says: The golden characters and jade inscriptions are all carved on the Blue Jade plate, or on the Blue Jade tablet. The plate is nine cun nine fen long, two cun four fen wide, with gold-lined characters, served by jade youths and jade maidens two each, overseeing incense and checks. According to the Four Extremities’ bright rules, within a hundred years there will be persons to hear twice transmission.

The Lord of the Southern Extreme Supreme Origin says: Jade is not for ordinary men to use; if one is named among the officials and sees the text, one may also carve it on a blue wooden plate, gilding its characters, placing it in a blue brocade bag, burning incense and offering homage; after nine years there will naturally be descent of heavenly truth granting the jade plate.

The Lord of the Southern Extreme Supreme Origin says: The Origin of Birth Transformation Original Register arises together with the Nine Qi Origin Cave. The Most High Jade Emperor, Supreme Saint Emperor True, all form from the Origin Cave Qi into shape and name, their robes and crowns all follow the Nine Heavens Great Have bowing and raising rites; place names are also naturally formed. Heaven has eight assemblies of Qi, four transformations of fate, with steel binding the jade void, dividing yin and yang, mysteriously transforming to govern the beginning, forming myriad things. The Most High assemblies of sages transform forms and scenes all follow the four seasons and changes, complying with fate and responding to command, changing and shifting without decay, exceedingly transforming and long enduring. Hence it is said the Dao has no constant name; this is the meaning. The Queen Mother's virtue responds to the great mystery, thus the Origin Primordial bestows the title Elixir Sovereign, secretly conferring a pure scroll of the original register, to be passed to later sages and immortal disciples, knowing the Origin Primordial’s Way assembling natural names, with transformative Qi. Those who see its chapters are inscribed in the immortals’ registers of the Nine Heavens, officials carve names on the Elixir Altar, adding their diligent thought; within nine years they may attain the true and take their place in the sleeping chamber, following the four seasons’ changes, flying and soaring in the Nine Heavens.

The Lord of the Southern Extreme Supreme Origin says: The Supreme Clarity Way of high mystery treasure scripture, by preserving thought as sensation, swallowing Qi as meeting, once having entered its chapters, one should understand the preservation of thought, the Origin of Transformation’s phenomena, knowing its form, color, light, Qi, and hues changing with the four seasons; one will close eyes without speech and come naturally; swallow Qi without drawing it and gather spontaneously. Thus within less than ten years one sees the spirit; within less than a month one’s Qi is full. Later scholars and sages may diligently refine their thought, so that the empty void may be illuminated, and connection with immortals may be had.

The Lord of the Southern Extreme Supreme Origin says: Those who plant and cultivate the Way of the Upper Immortals, thinking spirit and contemplating truth, swallowing Qi and saliva, yet do not know the Origin Primordial’s titles, the four seasons’ changes, the root sources of light, phenomena, and Qi, merely closing eyes in disorder and swallowing without thought, how can spirit and truth descend, how can Qi and essence be replenished? They look up and gaze, amid dimness; how much more so in the vast space without distinguishing form and Qi! This is called vain labour in sleeping and breathing, useless to empty chanting.
