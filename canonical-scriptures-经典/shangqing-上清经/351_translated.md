Above the Supreme, the palace is attended by two hundred and seventy Jade Maidens and Golden Immortals and Jade Youths each; they manage incense and dust whisks, guard the divine writings, secret within the Supreme’s Three Primal Purple Chambers, in the Palace of the Six Directions.

The Jade Purity Emperor Sovereign, at leisure above the Cavern of Purity, in the serene Dragon Mountain, at times invites the honoured guests of the Supreme Jade Purity, the great demon-dispelling Divine Heavenly Firmament Jade Purity King, within the curved chambers of jade and precious gems, in the chamber of golden flowers, observing pure fasting for three years, unveiling and reciting the Supreme, Profound and True Texts.

When the song is finished, the Emperor Sovereign commands the Five Elders Upper True Ones to present the Supreme Great Cavern Demon-Dispelling Divine Wisdom Profound Truth Scripture Jade Purity Hidden Writings, [resplendent] in a cloud brocade pouch, sealed with the Heaven-Opening seal, entrusted to the Left Duke of the Celestial Capital to oversee the Jade Palace, accompanied by thirty-seven Jade Maidens and thirty-seven Golden Morning Jade Youths, holding scarves and incense, guarding the divine writings. According to the bright laws of the Four Extremities, it is transmitted once every seven hundred years. Without the profound name and imperial diagram, carved slips will come in future lives, golden bone and jade marrow, commanding fate to unite with immortality, no one may partake in hearing. Its Way is so lofty and subtle, hence it is called a hidden writing, a treasure secret of the Supreme, not transmitted to later ages. To lightly reveal its spiritual text brings the burden of the Wind Blade, and ages of calamity.

The Supreme Divine Scripture all are supreme secret words of the high True Ones, recording the myriad essences of Heaven and Earth, to summon immortals and exterminate demons, opening the principles of the obscure passes. All issue from the Supreme formula, to implement the Great Cavern True Scripture, with the Chief Editor of the Supreme Presiding, the Great Unity brushing the banquet, the Jade Attendant compiling the titles, the Celestial Consort composing the compiled chapters, the Five Emperors collectively proofreading, completing the spiritual script.

Reciting it once, the nine heavens are startled to listen, the Jade Emperor receives the sound, myriad truths supervise the court, all demons vanish, celestial devils are broken and overturned. Practising this Way, the vital breath reaches the pure firmament, grace spreads in the nine passes, the seven ancestors are drawn out, reborn in the upper Heaven. Marking the mystery of the Divine Scripture’s precious excellence, it is indeed difficult to carry its victory. All who cultivate the Return Wind Mixed Great Cavern True Scripture’s thirty-nine chapters should first recite once the Supreme Demon-Dispelling Divine Wisdom to extinguish trials and summon realities, open the three passes, benefit and adjust body and bones, cause orchid breath to spread the passes, fix myriad spirits in position, harmonize the jade voice, vital breath and sound pure; then recite the wonderful chapters, the golden sound clearly resounds in the Supreme, the wonderful meaning is piercing in all directions, then the august elders supervise remotely in the bitter cinnabar, the Three Primes record and register in the purple chamber, draw out the seven ancestors in the dark path, cross the reincarnation fetus in the southern immortals, enjoy the blessings and destinies of life and death, the glory flows through their kindred. Its Way is secret and subtle, not to be rashly proclaimed; lightly revealing the spiritual sound, the body perishes in the river source, the seven ancestors reproach the offender, binding guilt in the dark mountains, the nine heavens forbid the scripture; if not true, do not transmit.

### The Great Cavern Demon-Dispelling Divine Wisdom Jade Purity Hidden Writings Scripture

The Profound Scene scatters the Heavenly Shore, the Clear River thinly veils the returning clouds. Wonderful vital breath shines through the three dawns, cinnabar clouds illuminate the purple subtlety. The clear Heaven unfolds spiritual hues, drifting through the firmament how misty! The divine lamp shines through the long watch, the corded net emits bright radiance. Four ridges gird high clouds, suspending essence shading the eight hangings. The Three Primes open the high void, the Orchid Gate unveils heavy doors. Golden ramparts reflect Jade Purity, spiritual elegance manifests the Celestial Domain. Wind rises in the eight meeting palaces, fierce beasts race in clouds. The three cavernous mansions are in disorder, True Men mutually interspersed. Above are dry scene essences, dark virtues lofty and grand. Great Unity labours to gather, grasping fate holding the divine banner. Zhengyi walks the flourishing spirit, summoning and calling myriad spirits home. The young prince guards the silent carriage, the Cavern Yang guards secret mysteries. Bright beginnings unite the Way's health, Dragon Chariot steadily moves. Seven scenes unite the Divine Kings, whirlwind wheels traverse myriad tiers. The body delicate upon the Profound Ferry, flying steps reach the supreme mountain ladder. Wearing brocade enters the divine hill, radiant vibrates the feathered robes. Darkness shakes and meets the cloud assembly, flying scenes receive divine power. Clear peaks without a hair’s cluster, exquisite union births the absolute void. Golden blossoms gird spiritual robes, fluttering high are the immortals. Ten thousand reins bear the airy dispersal, luxuriant the Supreme Window. Born in the middle, uniting the scene sovereign, nine emperors prosper the Supreme Emperor. The bright wheel reflects yellow stillness, feathered pearls illuminate the profound sun. Heavenly essence, elemental vital breath, the middle five numbers nurture light. Clear light forms and begins the spirit, nine true ones unite to twin. Wonderful scene opens the dark numbers, responding and marking the divine traces. Mud pellet Cavern Yuan Light, operating pearl in the red palace. Yuan Yang guards the Fate Gate, three spirits carry the purple youths. Restraining and summoning returning ascendancy, flanking gates guard the bright window. Dense gloom faces open brightness, round splendour glows three charges. Square fullness leads the receiving of life, reverse old returns to infant ignorance. Brilliant splendor adorns the nine heavens, green sky encircles the cinnabar chamber. Rustling entangled mist displays, twisting descends to the resting splendid hall. Wandering feasting glimpsing myriad transformations, returning to meet the Divine Heavenly Firmament King. The way of immortals delights sons, the way of ghosts harms sons. Only hearing the noble sons of the Way, not hearing the flourishing sons of ghosts. Ballads join the heavenly vital breath, merchant births have no correct chapter. Divine wisdom commands vermilion troops, Five Emperors’ talismans of the cold village. Banner and flag capture myriad demons, precious writings check the northern enclosure. Body comprehends the natural Way, demons destroyed are not your merit. Floating morning drums and long fans, containing spirits celebrate the celestial peak. Looking down sees four departures flying, heavenly tribulation eternally difficult to end. Wonderful midst produces true scene, returning carriage bitterly slow. Thoughts unite in dark feeling, carrying high the Supreme Yea. Soaring wings await the wonderful meeting, cavernous view’s feelings turn sad. Howling and roaring suddenly, suddenly passing the nine enclosures. Gathering vital breath returning to intersect the beginning, united scene dark profound rest.

Then the seven essences stop their shining, the heavy gates of the cavern open, a hundred suns flash lightning, the five stars hasten and shift, grasping the banner commanding spirits, all vital breath pursues, iron bears arrange a screen, fierce tigers transform majesty, six armies cut down demons, bronze heads seize the untrue, the fierce heavens devour poison, crystal clear dissolves and destroys, myriad essences extinguish the kind, six heavens collapse and fall, three ways move upright, what vital breath does not return? Mountains and rivers are overturned, sun and moon are darkened, spiritual beasts fall from their ranks, golden wings fall from flight, the Five Emperors bind belts in the divine space, myriad spirits submit before the supreme subtlety, the Supreme spreads his canopy upon the cinnabar cliff, eight scenes drive the carriage at the sky gate, observing the marvelous transformations of the cavern source, rejoicing in our Way with an open heart.

The Great Cavern Profound True Man said: If thou wouldst ascend the high seat and recite the *Great Cavern True Scripture* of thirty-nine chapters, thou ought first to sit upright, face due north, knock thy teeth thirty-two times, close thine eyes, think upon thyself arrayed in the nine-coloured feathered robes and dragon-patterned cape, the head crowned with the Jade Morning crown, holding the nine-coloured baton, the Azure Dragon attending on the left, the White Tiger guarding on the right, the head shaded by a splendid canopy, seated beneath a lion, the immortal youths attending with incense, jade maid scattering flowers, purple clouds luxuriant, filling the hall; five colours black and yellow arranged in order before and behind, clearly divided within and without, all made bright and clear. Then recite one chapter of the Demon-Dispelling Divine Wisdom Hidden Writings. When finished, close thine eyes and silently meditate, heart bowing to the four directions, mouth drawing in the vital breath of the East’s Azure Yang, the pure azure breath entering the nine swallows, filling the liver’s interior; next the mouth draws in the vital breath of the South’s Vermilion Spirit, the red breath entering the three swallows, filling the heart’s interior; next the mouth draws the vital breath of the West’s Golden Soul, the white breath entering the seven swallows, filling the lungs’ interior; next the mouth draws the vital breath of the North’s Dark Light, the black breath entering the five swallows, filling the kidneys’ interior; next the mouth draws the vital breath of the Centre’s High Sovereign, the yellow breath entering the twelve swallows, filling the spleen’s interior. When the five directions’ breaths are finished, softly pray:

> The five breaths combine in birth,  
> Essence supreme of the Profound Above,  
> Filling the five palaces, six conduits bright,  
> Internal pouring and external flowing,  
> Outer wrapping all pure,  
> Extinguishing filth and summoning realities,  
> I fly to the Great Spirit,  
> Ever before the High Morning.

When the *Great Cavern True Scripture* is finished, shake the left hand thrice, lawfully cast the flowing bells; shake the right hand seven times, lawfully cast the seven origins; then raise the head, shake the neck nine times, lawfully receive Heaven; then stamp the foot once, lawfully shake the spirit; shake the body twice seven times, to delight myriad spirits; then wipe the eyes thrice, illuminate the Three Luminaries; then pinch the nose seven times, open the bright beam; then pinch the rear of the eyebrows at the two gates thrice, close the source of evil; then circle the body thrice around, open the heavenly window; then swallow saliva nine times, take the jade fluids. When the whole body is finished, myriad spirits all rejoice, harmonize voices and vital breath; then recite the Jade Chapter, softly chant:

> Upholding Heaven and treading Earth,  
> Entering and exiting the cavern gates,  
> Left shaking flowing bells,  
> Right casting seven origins,  
> Wearing gold and jade,  
> Immortal robes fluttering,  
> Eight scenes arrayed in order,  
> Driving the carriage riding clouds,  
> Traveling all directions bright and clear,  
> Flying into the Imperial Morning.

When finished, sit calmly and recite the scripture.

This is the wonderful standard of the Great Cavern, the rites of bowing and raising; when the school attains method, then the Supreme opens the eyes, the Three Primes descend their seats, myriad spirits gather in homage, heavenly demons are subdued, the five sufferings all resolved, the seven ancestors receive blessings, the divine phoenix comes to soar, cloud dragons leap, all immortals acclaim the Good in the High Void, the Five Elders carve their names in the imperial records.

All who cultivate the upper Way, reciting spiritual chapters but not practising this method, neglect the heavenly rites; in bowing and prostration insufficient, they are laughed at by the Northern Emperor’s ghosts and gods, punished by the Three Officials, tested and defeated by myriad demons, losing their body to no profit. Therefore, it is easier to violate the Way than to cultivate it. When one attains the rite and standard, one shall have the step of soaring and ascending.
