## Scripture of the Supreme Flying Steps of the Five Stars

To step among the Five Stars: at the time before ascending the Star Gang, and at the time when descending from the Gang, one must first preserve the essences of the Five Stars within the five viscera. When preservation is complete, one knocks the teeth five times through the Five Passages, swallows saliva five times, and softly utters the following prayer:

The Five Stars arrayed in radiance, shining brightly the five directions;  
Mercury repels disasters, the virtue of Wood brings prosperity;  
Mars dissipates misfortune, Venus wards off weapons;  
Saturn governs the four quarters, benefiting home and country with success;  
Names inscribed on jade slips, recorded in the imperial registers;  
Riding the whirlwind dispersing shadows, soaring through the great void;  
Coming and going in darkness and nothingness,  
Wandering and feasting in the ten directions,  
Five clouds cover and summon the staff, capturing the wind;  
Grant, O myriad spirits, to ascend and become Immortal Lords.

Finished.  
Straighten the heart and face the mouth of the Gang, at the time of ascent and descent, preserving the prayer. When holding the breath to ascend the Gang, one first calls aloud the names of the Five Stars and their consorts; after completing their names, one then crosses the Gang and steps upon the stars. First lift both feet upon Venus, from Venus ascend to Saturn, from Saturn to Mars, from Mars to Jupiter, from Jupiter to Mercury, and from Mercury returns to step again on Venus. This is done thrice; then again holding breath ascend the Gang, and following the former method go back and forth fifteen times. At each star, one calls aloud the names of the Star Lord and his consort, placing the left hand upon the heart, and prays thus: Flying Immortal.

The Eastern Star, the true sovereign lord of Jupiter, named Chenglan, styled Qingning; his consort named Baorong, styled Feiyun.  
The Southern Star, the true sovereign lord of Mars, named Weiting, styled Sanrong; his consort named Huaping, styled Xuanluo.  
The Western Star, the true sovereign lord of Venus, named Liaoling, styled Zhenxun; his consort named Piaoying, styled Ling’en.  
The Northern Star, the true sovereign lord of Mercury, named Qixuan, styled Jingyuan; his consort named Xuanhua, styled Longe.  
The Central Star, the true sovereign lord of Saturn, named Zanglu, styled Tanyan; his consort named Kongyao, styled Feixian.

The first of the Northern Dipper, the Supreme Star, wears a yellow brocade veil and a scarlet flying skirt.  
The second, the Origin Star, wears a blue brocade veil and a green feathered flying skirt.  
The third, the True Star, wears a blue brocade veil and an embroidered feathered splendid skirt.  
The fourth, the Button Star, wears a purple brocade veil and a yellow splendid feathered skirt.  
The fifth, the Strong Star, wears a vermilion brocade garment and a purple-blue flying skirt.  
The sixth, the Record Star, wears a vermilion brocade veil and a blue embroidered flying skirt.  
The seventh, the Pass Star, wears a scarlet brocade veil and a blue splendid feathered skirt.  
The eighth, the Emperor Star, wears a purple brocade veil and an embroidered vermilion flying skirt.  
The ninth, the Exalted Star, wears a green brocade veil and a jade feathered splendid skirt.

The right head is coiffed with a drooping cloud bun.

The Scripture says: In practice, all direct northwards holding the secret book and performing the rites: this is called the beginning of learning the true mystery, not yet having traversed the subtle and remote, not understanding the chief directions of the stars, not discerning the pointing of the Mysterious Dipper; therefore one faces north holding the book to gradually seek it.  
When one has already understood the meaning of the book, knows the stars’ movements and their times, one should follow the direction pointed to by the Dipper, preserving the steps accordingly; thus there is no fixed direction, and one does not always face north. All that face north are only the beginners.  
It is feared this may be comprehended by analogy, and no further questions be needed.

The Supreme Perfected One’s method of stepping among the Five Stars is to govern the Five Stars descending into the chamber. Holding breath ascending the Gang, first calling aloud the names of the Five Stars and their consorts, then crossing the Gang and stepping upon the stars. At first, ascending the Gang with firmness, calling the names completed, then crossing the Gang and stepping the stars. At each star, repeat the calling of the star lord’s and consort’s name to strengthen the effect.  
If troublesome, one may follow the old method. Formerly, Master Yu She, Master Bei Lianzi, and the Elder of Changling all attained ascension to heaven by this method, not repudiating difficulty or hardship. This is called the method of nurturing life.  
The merchants’ eager pursuits – do they dread the riverbanks? They only seek money and goods.  
If one’s seeking the Dao is always like the merchants’ intent, how could one fail to become an immortal? But sadly, beginners all say to exert themselves fully, yet let themselves slacken.  
It is like a carriage about to fall apart with all its joints slackening, or like a beast heavily laden struggling on a long journey.  
What the learner fears is what the successful laugh at; all are such matters.  
If one can diligently study the inner mirror, this will move the spirit, and there will be the inspiration of the spiritual being revealing mysteries, bearing the carriage of the stars and their images.  
The map of the Five Stars is always oriented southward. Venus is positioned in the west, Jupiter in the east; follow accordingly.  
Because the Five Stars lie hidden, shifting without fixed position, they are not like the Northern Dipper which is constantly fixed in place, with a set location in the five directions and cannot follow the stars’ temporary whereabouts.  
The Thirty-Eight Scenes combined with the Twenty-Four Spirits may be successively remembered; one may at one time instantly preserve the Thirty-Eight, or at dawn preserve the upper scene, at midday the middle scene, and at midnight the lower scene, all according to the mind of man.  
If the outer body is secluded in a quiet cave, cut off from human affairs, and within one contemplates the spirit barrier, gathering true morning breath, one may at dawn instantly preserve the Thirty-Eight Scenes, and at the three times again preserve one scene each, this will be better indeed.  
But the world is full of affairs, this is troublesome and difficult to always practice, and where affairs cannot be constant, the benefit will be meagre.  
Formerly the Prince of the Western City and the Perfected of Tong[—] both followed this Way.  
According to the White Slips of the Precious Mysterious Jade Register and the Azure Scripture: those who do not preserve the Twenty-Four Spirits, and do not know the names of the Thirty-Eight Scenes, cannot be peaceful commoners, nor can they be ministers of the later sages.

My former master instructed that on the day of the Five Arrivals, when the sun rises three to four zhang, stand upright, facing the sun with the heart, preserving the three souls and spirit to enter the heart with the sun’s light, for a long time.  
Hold breath three breaths, swallow saliva thrice, softly pray:

The sun scatters brilliance, hanging light purple-blue,  
Comes into my soul, illumines my five forms,  
Repels ghosts and tests the heart, causes the heart to be even and upright,
