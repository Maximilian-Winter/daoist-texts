## Volume the First of the Inner Profound Scripture of the River Map of the Supreme Clarity

The Profound Master, the Holy Artisan, transmitted from generation to generation, their inspiration reached a great height; the radiance vanished and faded away. Returning and passing on through good and evil, one declines as another flourishes; sinking and then rising anew; broken and again united; lofty arrogance, forever parting from good causes. Solemn, cautious, and secret, increasing the verdure of goodness; by following goodness one is able to respond. The mysterious responses come again and again; when they reach their height there are differences; differences lead to communication with spirits; the spiritual master’s sacred canon, secret characters and essential texts, descend naturally and appear, washing away filth and dispersing dust. The dim knowledge obeys and reveres, leading to long life, immortality, salvation of the body and aid to beings. The three vehicles are presented mutually; the hidden and manifest are not abandoned. That which is not in accord falls into ruin; ruin is painful indeed; all ought to fear this. Be careful in the end as at the beginning, then one conforms to the Way.  
All true texts of nature were originally present in emptiness; therefore they sometimes fly, sometimes sink; sometimes hidden, sometimes manifest. The dragon, the horse, the turtle, the fish—all bear the diagrams and images, all born without beginning, appearing and manifesting according to feeling, appearing at different times; only goodness is so. Those who obtain them come after; their texts have long been before. Those who now obtain them are the same as those who obtained them; all are as gold and jade slips, carved and written secretly and hidden; well versed in memory and thorough understanding. To preserve, recite, and practice, also by silk or linen, inscribed in vermilion worn on the body, fully provided against forgetfulness. In urgent times seek carefully and act, dispelling calamities and extending blessings; diligently practised without sloth will ascend to the saintly immortals. Teachers and disciples keep purity, open the mysteries and report to the spirits; if men recklessly transmit, false divulgence brings deep calamity. Let all be careful and strictly obey.

## The Secret Names of Taiyi (Two)

Taiyi is the son of the Way. The Way responds to the stimulus of things, manifesting the spirit to give birth to the One; the One spirit guides and leads, generating all things without limit or end. For the beginner in learning, first awaken by this practice to achieve utmost truth; the true saints transmit it to lead later learners. The later learners who follow and obey the earlier become one with the earlier, and thus one with the Way itself. The three powers, five virtues, nine sovereign venerable spirits—the source of change and the basis for saving all creatures—these are Taiyi, the Three and Five, and the Nine Spirits, the utmost origin of the Way.  
Firstly, Taiyi presides over the hidden and manifest, being the ancestor of the formless. Secondly, the Mysterious Origin generates and exchanges Qi, being Heaven, Earth, and Man. Man has sharpness, dullness, and evenness; Heaven and Earth respond as three grades; separation and union as five; three times three makes nine; all change is complete. Refining the non-existent and the existent, the existent and non-existent thoroughly understood by the perfect man. Man follows Earth, Earth follows Heaven, Heaven follows the Way, the Way follows Nature. The three powers have form and are able to practice the Way; the practice of the Way to perfection corresponds with Nature; although differing in sequence as five, all return to one source. Therefore the spirit of Taiyi is the most revered and noble, giving birth to Heaven and establishing Earth, creating men and things. All who do not receive the original source of the River Map, do not wear the true characters, do not recognise the original Taiyi, do not keep the Five Spirits, do not observe the Three Ones, do not serve the Nine Emperors, cannot perform the Great Thanks. When requesting the Great Thanks, one summons and informs universally, respecting the utmost secret names, the inner spirits and hidden names. Without receiving from a master, be careful not to practice presumptuously. Those who cultivate and use should receive from a master, and depending on conditions obtain the text, following the rites of the Mysterious Covenant. By these rites no man should rashly make his own method and forcibly practise it. Such practice causes guilt and error to oneself and others. Those who earnestly desire to carry out the practice must secretly seek an enlightened master and find the rites of the Mysterious Covenant; with pure heart and self-cleansing, naturally they will meet. Following the prescribed forms, first open and announce, after the petition set up the offering and present sincerity; only with caution and secrecy. If violated, one will be examined and come to trial. Those able to be diligent and earnest, after long following blessings arrive; blessings come from accumulated virtue, coexisting with the Way.

The venerable spirit Taiyi, secret name Wuyu Shou, character Gui Huichang, also called Jieming and Jipin. By cause and condition and accumulation of good, encountering this true secret name, one secretly recognises and keeps it in mind, in movement and stillness silently chanting; praying that desires be granted according to the mind’s wish; never to tell others. If not the person, mutual offense arises. To avoid sin and seek blessings, dim knowledge keeps it, constantly seeing the light and image of the venerable spirit Taiyi, shining extraordinarily on one’s sides, whether sitting or walking, slow or fast by day and night; carefully keeping and not forgetting, then misfortune disappears and good fortune arrives. After long time one will converse with it; speech and form agree, becoming one together. Those who cannot constantly keep it day and night may keep it at night, in the six palaces of their body. Entering between the two eyebrows one inch is the Bright Hall; two inches is the Inner Chamber; the Inner Chamber is south, the Bright Hall north; this is the Six Palaces, above which is the Palace of the Great Ultimate. Taiyi dwells by day in the Great Ultimate, by night in the Six Palaces. Constantly able to keep this, one’s merits and conduct daily renew; demons dare not violate. If not knowing Taiyi, practising merit and virtue vainly, they will be destroyed by evil, and virtue and achievement will not be attained. The scholar seeking accomplishment must keep the One as urgent.

Your servant being foolish and incompetent, mistakenly joined true teachings, aspiring to spread the mysterious wind, to save and protect all, putting others before self, dares not be slothful. Now overwhelmed with sincere earnestness, carefully presenting presumptuously. But life’s movement is truly mostly ___, largely from ignorance and darkness, using wrongly against the truth, causing confusion and loss of right. Humbly seeking reason in the realm of being, not without heart; the affairs of the heart should be to remove darkness and seek light; light must shine forth; by sages and spirits, mysterious rewards already responded, saintly approval and offerings, divine permission and opening; opening by sincere earnestness, offerings by cleansing the heart; when heart is exhausted, one should repent immeasurable sins; sincere earnestness should respect and offer sacrifice and food; when rites are complete, divine aid will surely come; when sin is removed, good wishes will surely accord.
