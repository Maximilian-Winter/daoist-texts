## The Supreme Purity Purple Essence Lord, Primordial Purple Spirit Dao Lord’s Inner Chamber Supreme Scripture

### Great Simplicity Supreme Purity Invoking the Emperor Lord’s Five Spirits and Qi Methods

Lying in repose beneath the brilliant celestial time, resting within the nine essences, restraining soul and spirit to ascend northward, refining the five spirits within true qi, roaming freely among the eight simplicity elements, arranging names in the mysterious diagram — the Supreme Great Lord chants thus:

At the Upper Purple Gate, gazing upon the Eight Mornings, magnifying the Vermilion Palace, fully revealing the spirit; wandering the nine qi, dancing with celestial immortals; veiling the blue heavens, chanting the Great Calendar, girded with luxuriant foliage; reciting the Spirit Formula, summoning the wind dragon; treading the twin whites, magnifying the purple youth; returning the two reds, hiding the Great Simplicity, concealing the splendid jade.

This is the Purple Essence Method to bring forth the Five Spirits. The Great Calendar refers to the Seven Sacred Records; the Spirit Formula refers to the Jade Emperor Scripture.

Customarily at the time of parrot’s call, preserving the eastern azure qi coming from midday, causing it to fill the head’s cinnabar pellet. Within the pellet are two blue vapors, also emerging from the eyes, dense and luxuriant; they transform into two children, clothed above and below in blue, like infants newly walking. The child of the left eye is named Flying Spirit; the child of the right eye is named Morning Infant; both are at my sides, fully manifesting, long after striking the teeth nine times, swallowing saliva nine times, intoning softly:

"O Eastern Five Spirits, solar qi shining azure, entering at dawn the cinnabar pellet, refining the brain's precious form, left transforms, right transmutes, the name of attainment of the Way, cause me to ascend the court of Great Simplicity Purple Clarity."

When finished, deeply recalling the names of the two children, then all harm refrains. Constantly cultivating this for eighteen years, ascending to heaven. Preserving the two children, causing them to emerge from the eyes, causing the blue qi suddenly to transform and generate. Preserving them at sides, commanding the two children each to breathe forth blue qi, to surround me entirely, penetrating within and without.

At midday, facing the eyes and holding firmly, preserving the thought that at midday are two red qi entering the fists; after some time, suddenly transforming into red children, one in each hand, both robed in red, like infants newly walking; both at my sides attending my rising and resting. The child of the left hand is the midday master of life, named Receiving Birth; the child of the right hand is the midday Peach Lord, named Square Full. Both breathe forth red qi, pouring it into my mouth, ascending to cinnabar pellet, descending through the body, permeating interior and exterior like firelight. After long meditation, softly intoning:

"The sun is the proper true, the red spirit moves the smoke, the jade spirit generates life, intimately with me; Receiving Birth and Square Full, gods above the sun, governing soul and protecting form, extending life for myriad thousands, the whole body harmonized in brightness, ascending as a lofty immortal."

When finished. Constantly able to act thus, preserving the spirit names, sitting, standing, or dying.

At feeding time, sitting calmly, facing the eyes, preserving the moon within, two white qi come directly to enter the soles of both feet and pervade the heart; after long time, each sole transforms into two white dragons at my sides. The left dragon is named Gale Essence; the right dragon is named Sudden Pavilion; both dragons breathe forth white smoke entering my two nostrils, penetrating directly to the lungs. Preserving within the lungs a child, robed in white above and below, emerging from the right nostril, standing at my right, named Pure Bright Child, appearing like an infant newly walking. After long time, preserving thought and distinguishing, fully manifesting, then striking teeth seven times, swallowing saliva seven times, softly intoning:

"Jade Emperor's Gale and Sudden, two dragons descend at dawn, entering my two feet, transforming and generating my whole body; Pure Bright Child turns left and right, harmonizing and gathering the six qi, nourishing and raising the five spirits, bearing me upward rushing, Great Simplicity Precious Immortal."

Constantly able to act thus, neither hastening nor delaying. The left eye child Flying Spirit, the right eye child Morning Infant, the left hand child Receiving Birth, the right hand child Square Full, the lung child Pure Bright — these are the five spirit names. Constantly controlling and holding the Gale and Sudden dragons, breathing forth qi to pour into me. Practising without danger for eighteen years, Great Simplicity sends Jade Guardian Lord to receive me, riding the brightness driving the morning, directly arriving at Purple Clarity. One should preserve Pure Bright standing at my right, mouth breathing forth white smoke, luxuriating over my face, deeply focusing on stillness and concentration, avoiding mixed thoughts. Meditation should always be performed facing the eyes; when finished, open them. Always preserve the Five Spirits and two dragons at my sides, pouring qi unceasingly. On the eight seasonal festivals avoid distractions; garments and headwear should not be borrowed from others; carriages and horses not used in multitudes; so as to maintain stillness, embrace response, focus thought to seek the subtle, thereby able to rise on purple carriage to fan the air, riding the Gale and Sudden to ascend.

The immortal is the study of the heart; if the heart is sincere, then one becomes immortal. The Way is sought within; if the inner is secret, then the Way comes. The true person cultivates stillness; entering the quiet, then one joins the true. The spirit requires response; accumulating response, then one becomes efficaciously connected. Constantly able to guard this, the day of departure to immortality is near. But if the heart contends for spirit’s affairs, the body’s harmony is not single; in movement and stillness the essence is lost; the ears and eyes clear and bright — these only accumulate vain seeking of the Way, and the Way grows ever distant.

### [Supreme Subtle Emperor Lord’s Twenty-Four Spirits Returning to Origin Scripture]#1

The Supreme Subtle Emperor Lord, Supreme One formed the shape, Purple Origin inner spirit, twenty-four truths, mixed qi transforming birth, jade immortals highest essence, dispersing and dissolving cellular knots, releasing obstruction to open origin.

### [Twenty-Four Knots, Must]#2 The twenty-four spirits’ commands enable liberation and removal. Those who can cultivate and preserve these names govern and pacify the body, preserving the original essence. To dissolve the knots, one must first intone the spell, then the gates open. This spirit is the profound origin of knot qi, the true spirits forming the body, guiding the clouds and mists, bringing forth true smoke. Each can summon jade brush dragon riders, thousands in array, all united as one body, ascending to the morning light. These are the Supreme Perfected Twenty-Four Spirits guarding the origin, the Emperor Lord of Supreme Purity riding the Gale and Sudden Way.

Always one should settle the body and quiet the heart, correct the qi and level the shape, close the eyes and look inward, forget the body and contemplate the spirit, burn incense and prepare the elixir, preserve the spirit and guard the true, manifest thrice in succession, auspicious and radiant with mystery. Practising thus for eighteen years, the Supreme commands the Supreme Subtle Emperor Lord and the Five Spirits of the Supreme One to transform birth the Mixed Spirit Dao Lord, summoning the Twenty-Four Perfected, a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, galloping the wind treading the clouds, breathing flowing ascending, at midday creating heaven.

The Way of preserving the spirit: do not mingle with wrong kinds, avoid matters in deep chambers, dwell in spirit and tread the void, heart preserving eye thought, subtle and wondrous guarding emptiness, quieting soul and calming shape, then ten thousand harms will not injure, a hundred demons flee and hide, a thousand devils cannot act, dispelling disaster and scattering calamity, blessings beyond measure. First strike the teeth through twenty-four passages, then preserve thought:

The brain spirit is named Enlightened No Child, styled Dao Capital, form one inch one fen long, colour pure white.

The hair spirit is named Mysterious Floral Pattern, styled Dao Balance, form two inches one fen long, colour dark.

The skin and flesh spirit is named Communicating General, styled Dao Link, form one inch five fen long, colour yellow.

The eye spirit is named Spiritual Overseer Birth, styled Dao Child, form three inches long, wearing five colours.

The nape marrow spirit is named Spiritual Counsel Cover, styled Dao Circle, form five inches long, colour white.

The backbone spirit is named Benefit Heritage Support, styled Dao Pillar, form three inches and a half long, dressed in white jade.

The nose spirit is named Middle Dragon Jade, styled Dao Subtle, form two inches five fen long, wearing blue-white-yellow robes.

The tongue spirit is named Initial Beam Rise, styled Dao Branch, form seven inches long, pure red.

These are the names of the eight spirits upon the upper body on the right side; first preserve them, all like infants in form, manifesting on the body, each placed in its position. When complete, strike the teeth through eight passages, swallow saliva eight times, softly intoning:

The Eight Spirits of the Upper Aspect, Emperor Lord and Mysterious Mother, Five Spirits each arrayed, united entering the body, raising the form to escape transformation, flowing and changing to truth, a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, all ascending to Imperial Morning, White Origin Without Hero, the Way nurtures the Supreme Guest, Eight Spirits wing the body, jade blossoms bearing smoke, wandering a thousand cycles, directly arriving at the Sun Gate.

At the beginning of meditation, first three calls of the spirit names, after blessing, again three calls of the spirit names, causing the voice to emerge from the mouth, three parts all together. At dawn, midday, and midnight, always preserve the Twenty-Four Spirits, calling and blessing in sequence, as above.

The "Supreme Treasure Spirit Bright Ritual Scripture" says: The method of striking teeth, left to left is called striking the Heavenly Bell. Right to right is called beating the Heavenly Chime. Center up and down opposing strikes is called sounding the Heavenly Drum. If suddenly encountering evil inauspiciousness, one should strike the Heavenly Bell thirty times. When crossing a mountain, to repel evil and command powerful spirits, one should beat the Heavenly Chime. When preserving thought and calling the Way, summoning the true spirits, one should sound the Heavenly Drum. Though the act of striking the teeth is one, in truth it has left, right, up, and down. Thus the evil fears the sound of the Heavenly Bell, mountain spirits dread the clearness of the Heavenly Chime, and summoned spirits reverence the trembling of the Heavenly Drum. The five tones have measure, the subtle inner response cannot be combined by mere coarse coincidence. A thousand chapters and myriad affairs should all be like this. The way of striking teeth is thus unfolded, the sounds of bell and drum differ. Therefore the Tao’s numbers must not be mistaken or confused, nor the arts and methods be chaotic; if mistaken, there is ruin and confusion; if chaotic, disaster and reproach; this is not that the dark is without connection, but the dark connection is without order. The Way does not come to pass, affairs do not prove because the seeking of truth does not follow the paths and tracks. Striking the Heavenly Bell twenty times means no other blessing is needed; this must be done to remove inauspiciousness. If one acts according to the text with varying numbers of strikes, there is no need to strike thirty times.

The throat spirit is named Hundred Flux Release, styled Dao Communicate, form eight inches long, wearing nine-coloured robes.

The lung spirit is named Pure Spirit Born, styled Dao Peace, form eight inches one fen long, pure white.

The heart spirit is named Brilliant Sun Prosper, styled Dao Bright, form nine inches long, red in colour.

The liver spirit is named Open Lord Child, styled Dao Azure, form six inches long, blue in colour.

The gall bladder spirit is named Dragon Virtue Constraint, styled Dao Release, form three inches six fen long, blue-yellow-green in colour.

The left kidney spirit is named Spring Origin Upright, styled Dao Minister, form three inches seven fen long, dark, changing in irregular five colours of white and red.

The right kidney spirit is named Elephant Other Not, styled Dao Jade, form three inches five fen long, white or black in colour.

The spleen spirit is named Treasure Origin Complete, styled Dao Soar, form seven inches three fen long, pure yellow.

These are the names of the eight spirits of the middle body on the right side; next preserve them, all in infant form, manifesting on the body, each placed in its position. When complete, strike teeth eight times, swallow saliva eight times, softly intoning:

The Eight Spirits of the Middle Aspect, Four Changes Nine Flights, refining soul and correcting form, brightness of aspect united, gaining with the Eight Spirits, joining chariots in equal power, a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, ascending to Supreme Subtle.

The stomach spirit is named Together Come Nourish, styled Dao Expand, form seven inches long, yellow in colour.

The extreme bowel spirit is named Marked Teng Prosper, styled Dao Return, form one inch four fen long, yellow-red in colour.

The great and small bowel spirit is named Creeping Sending Stay, styled Dao Kitchen, form two inches one fen long, red-yellow in colour.

The torso spirit is named Receiving Thick Brilliance, styled Dao Void, form nine inches one fen long, wearing nine-coloured robes.

The chest diaphragm spirit is named Broad Radiance Residence, styled Dao Void, form five inches long, white in colour.

The two sides spirit is named Repelling False Horse, styled Dao Achieve, form four inches one fen long, red-white in colour.

The left yin and left yang spirit is named Supporting Flow Rising, styled Dao Jade Tablet, form two inches two fen long, blue-yellow-white in colour; in males it resides as left yang, in females as left yin.

The right yin and right yang spirit is named Budding Manifest Bright, styled Dao Life, form two inches three fen long, blue-yellow-white in colour; in males it resides as right yang, in females as right yin.

These are the names of the eight spirits of the lower body on the right side; lastly preserve them, all in infant form, manifesting on the body, each placed in its position. When complete, strike teeth eight times, swallow saliva eight times, softly intoning:

The Eight Spirits of the Lower Aspect, dispersing form transforming spirit, purple smoke luxuriant and born, containing origin guarding essence, Supreme One Primordial Father, Emperor Lord arising, Seven Brightnesses reflecting the registers, governing life and recording birth, soul and spirit at peace, Five Brightnesses nourishing clarity, a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, joining with me, first creating Great Simplicity, then saluting Supreme Purity.

The inner spirit of the Way One is named Pursuing No Horse, styled Dao Ultimate Life, form two inches two fen long, purple in colour; in males preserved as inner spirit of Way One, in females preserved as True Origin Central Spirit.

This is the most hidden spirit of the root of the right side of the body, guarding the central highest spirit. Next preserve it, in infant form, sitting firmly in its place. When complete, strike teeth thirty times, swallow saliva twenty-four times, softly intoning:

Mysterious Supreme Inner True, nourishing form serving morning, governing binding and gathering webs, nine degrees eight turns, constellation stars within mystery, palaces and halls nine arrays, Emperor Lord united flourishing, nine ways seven swallows, emitting liquid receiving essence, harmonizing pouring into all spirits, five viscera generating splendour, reversing old to young visage, a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, ascending with me to heaven, attending at Supreme Steps, respectfully saluting Jade Morning.

The treasure name of the right body is the inner character, the spirit of transformation and generation. Not knowing this name, the immortal Way cannot be completed. If on the day of knot dissolution this is not first intoned, then the knots will not dissolve. If knots do not dissolve, the three souls will lose their place, the upper origin inner loss, the five elders lose brightness, Emperor Lord estranged and distant. For men preserved as spirit of a child, for women preserved as spirit of a woman; both have the same name.

Preserving the twenty-four spirits, always at midnight, removing the pillow, lying flat, holding firmly and relaxing the body, adjusting qi delicately, preserving thought on the body spirits, peacefully contemplating the Emperor Lord, causing manifestation to reside in place, closing eyes looking inward. If anything is incomplete, then burn incense, sit calmly with closed eyes, holding firmly on both knees, preserving the spirits, blessing and acting according to rules. At dawn and midday, preserving spirit, from calm sitting then proceed thus, not allowing others to see. All are inward looking with closed eyes.

On the first night of the month at midnight, after preserving spirits, again preserving white qi in the two eyes, like the size of a chick’s egg, before the face; momentarily it transforms into two bright mirrors, nine chi wide, reflecting front and back my entire body and the twenty-four spirits, enabling clear and thorough reflection. After long time, then the heart blesses:

Great Bright Treasure Mirror, dispersing form and scattering transformation, shining clearly the original spirit, restraining and repelling ten thousand demons, flying to Supreme Purity, unveiling cloud veils, commanding a thousand spirits, sealing mountains and summoning rivers.

When finished. Practising every five days, this is called covering and examining the internal essence, inspecting and gathering the five spirits. Constantly able to act thus, disasters do not arise, and the rank ascends to High Immortal.

The Way of the whisk boy, enabling clear vision of the Emperor Lord’s Five Spirits and Twenty-Four Spirits: always on the cycle of sixty days, on the day of Gengwu, at midday, take one dou of clear water, cast in one zhu of true cinnabar, stirring it left three times and seven passes, blessing thus:

Mysterious Flowing Vermilion Essence, generating light entering brightness, body spirit in multitude array, all come to see the form, penetrating ten thousand li, reaching the nine spirits, Emperor Lord reflecting child, enabling me to ascend essence.

When blessing is complete, wash the eyes facing east two times seven passes. Those who constantly practise thus see through all spirits. The blessing should be softly spoken, washing the eyes facing the moon, always eastward.

At midnight in pure stillness, sitting or lying at will, steadying the body and quieting the heart, broadening breath and regulating the spirit, facing the eyes looking inward, preserving the Western Venus star above the eyebrows, named Jade Dangle Purple Gate.

After completing these preservations, manifesting, causing the five stars to issue forth light rays, releasing five-coloured smoke, penetrating my whole body, penetrating interior and exterior, as if within the body there is fragrant star essence entering. Then strike teeth twenty-five times, swallow saliva twenty-five times, softly intoning:

Sun on the left, moon on the right, preserving to cause bright penetration of form, causing manifestation to reside in place, closing eyes with utmost contemplation, not allowing escape or distraction.

When finished. Practise for fifteen years, Jade Emperor sends Three Simplicity Jade Children to welcome.

Sealed in the Jade Chest of the Five Mountains, hiding the Returning to Origin Way in the Nine Morning Palace. Having cultivated the Five Passes, one should then practice Returning to Origin; the Five Passes open at the beginning, Returning to Origin at the end. Thus one who cultivates Five Passes first fasts three days, then acts on that day. Those cultivating the Seven Origins Returning Way do not eat blood or fish, and do not fast on the preceding or following days. The reason for not fasting then is that the Five Passes have already been fasted before. The Five Passes are the Supreme Auspicious Meeting Days; Returning to Origin is the Supreme Renewal Day. Not knowing the Five Passes, one cannot resolve sins or remove faults; not knowing the Returning to Origin Hidden Way, one cannot carve the tablet of the Supreme Perfected. Constantly on those days think to preserve auspicious matters, first thanking the body’s sins and faults, called liberation of form and name. It is not displayed to the immortals in the Nine Palaces. All who cultivate the inner chamber Purple Chamber matters and preserve thought on the Nine Origins and Seven Origins, when first rising from sleep, when first lying down, and after meals, first softly intone:

Five Stars Five Passes, Six Directions Purple Chamber, Returning to Origin Hidden Way, Expanding the Seven Mornings, producing the soul is the Mysterious Father; father transforms one to form spirit; producing the spirit is the Mysterious Mother; mother transforms two to birth the body; governing my sinews and bones is the Lord; preserving my essence and qi is the White Origin; long life and enduring sight, flying immortal ten heavens.

When finished, do not allow others to hear the blessing words. This is the Supreme Hidden Blessing to remove evil qi, bring forth spirit and essence, causing a person’s whole life to never weary of darkness.
