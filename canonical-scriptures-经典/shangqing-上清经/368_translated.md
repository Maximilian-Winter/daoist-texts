The Primordial Heavenly Worthy Speaks the Mysterious Subtle Scripture

The Way speaks: If one desires to attain the subtle mystery, one must tranquilize the mind and follow the Way according to the appointed times. At the time of the vernal equinox, at midnight, rise and sit facing east; close the eyes in meditation, preserving within myself the Three Palaces, the Three Ones, the Three Ministers, and myself — seven persons in all, with myself in the centre. Together we ride the smoke of the Purple Qi and ascend the Northern Dipper's Yang Bright Star. This Yang Bright Star is the eastern deity of the Northern Dipper. Then preserve entering and sitting in the heart of the star; swallow the Purple Qi thirty times, practicing for a long time. One then sees the Eastern Origin Supreme Official of the Yang Bright Star; within the official's domain is a young lad of azure black who imparts to you genuine light. First, one must preserve the Purple Qi beneath the Northern Dipper star, as large as a string, descending straight to before oneself, then preserve the Three Ones.

The Zhou Master's Formula says: Preserve the seven persons at the head of the Dipper's seven stars, and together ascend the Yang Bright Star in goose formation, I being in the centre. The head star bears the chief at the top, the handle of the ladle pointing forward. Swallow the Purple Qi thirty times; I preserve the Purple Qi and swallow it. Also think on the Three Ones and the Three Ministers, swallowing them together at the same time. After swallowing, again preserve the seven persons riding the Purple Qi, descending from the void and returning to the Three Palaces within oneself. After a long while, the heart offers this prayer:

Three Worthies of the Supreme Truth, the Highest Mysterious Deities,  
Yang Bright governs Spring, myriad youths open the gate.  
Dan Origin governs Summer, vermilion and purple blend with smoke.  
Yin Essence governs Autumn, heavenly might of the six formations.  
Northern Pole governs Winter, myriad evils block the wicked.  
Five Earths hold the Ren, the Wu and Ji heavenly gates;  
All that they crush is destroyed, none resist their direction.  
Refine my seven souls, harmonize my three spirits,  
Generate my five organs, so that I obtain the true,  
Ascend to the Flying Pure, float among the seven origins,  
Long life and smooth dwelling, calling to a thousand spirits.  
Finished. One may also sleep while preserving this. The four seasons share but this one incantation.

At the summer solstice, at midnight, rise and sit facing south; close the eyes in meditation, preserving within oneself the Three Palaces, the Three Ones, the Three Ministers, and myself — seven persons in all, myself in the centre. Together we ride the smoke of Purple Qi and ascend the Northern Dipper's Dan Origin Star. The Dan Origin Star is the southern deity of the Northern Dipper. Then preserve entering the star and sitting together; swallow the Purple Qi thirty times, practicing for a long time. One then sees the Southern Pole Supreme Palace of the Dan Origin Star; within the palace is the Vermilion Yang Spirit Consort, who imparts to you the scarlet script and treasured writings.

At the autumnal equinox, at midnight, rise and sit facing west; close the eyes in meditation, preserving within oneself the Three Palaces, the Three Ones, the Three Ministers, and myself — seven persons in all, myself in the centre. Together we ride the smoke of Purple Qi and ascend the Northern Dipper's Yin Essence Star. The Yin Essence Star is the Northern Gap of text, lacking more than four hundred seventy characters. #1 The Eight Sections should be consulted according to the calendar. These Eight Sections are the correct measures of the Xuanji, the days when myriad true spirits and celestial immortals hold court and feast.

The Northern Emperor's natural law, among the monthly counts, on the days when the three phases of Qi coincide, is also an auspicious time. It is appropriate to build, cultivate, and contemplate the Way. Overall, I follow the One.

Foreign lands reckon the first day of the month as the beginning, the second as the removal, and count accordingly. Now, in the absence of a calendar for the phases, this may be used. The Hsiung-nu country reckons the first day of the first month as the Jia Yin day, the new moon being the sixth Jia; the cycle then repeats. The first month is large, the second large, the third small, the fourth large, the fifth small, the sixth large, the seventh small, the eighth large, the ninth small, the tenth large, the eleventh small, the twelfth large. For those who are deep in obscure wilderness, distant and dark, this too should be observed.

At every first day of the month, or the first day itself, at dawn, preserve the Three Ones emerging from one's own Three Officials, sitting before oneself. Then the heart rises and bows twice, as if seeing and revering them; accordingly the heart prays:

Heavenly Worthy, Three Emperors, guard the gate of life;  
They go forth roaming the void, the six energies and mysterious divisions nourish my five spirits, correct my three souls, my five organs self-generate, long life and flying immortality.  
Finished. Again, preserve returning from the void to the Three Palaces; after a long while, swallow saliva thirty times. Ten times is the standard; at night one should dream of the Three Ones and the Three Ministers. Or one may dream of white crows, white swans, white tigers, gold and jade objects — all transformations and manifestations of the Three Ones. Thus preserve and do not be negligent; then you will see these images, and gradually face them.

At every removal day, at midnight, secretly rise facing north, look at the internal shapes of the seven stars of the Northern Dipper; see the Three Ones descend from the assisting star into one's own Three Palaces; then return to rest and meditate, preserving the vision as if seen; then softly pray:

Supreme Heaven's assistant, the Three Emperors' roaming place,  
Three Ministers support the bones, united with the true,  
Descend into my body, sit tranquilly in the origin,  
Emit essence and nourish the form, harmonize soul and spirit,  
Make me fly as immortal, wandering among the clouds.  
Finished. Swallow saliva twenty-seven times. The month takes only the removal day.

At every opening day, at midnight, rise and sit facing east; remove the head covering, one may also loosen the hair, then comb and tie it; after tying well and long, softly call:

Upper Origin Three True Ones, the infant in the true middle,  
Scatter hair and open the smoke, ascend to the Heavenly Terrace,  
The mud pellet firm and solid, concurrent with Heaven,  
Make me fly immortal, to cross and move the grotto terrace.  
Finished. Swallow saliva nineteen times; then don the head covering and rest.  
Sincerely preserve the Three Ones and Three Ministers, each resting in their palace. The Emperor and Ministers face each other sitting; preserve the Three Ones, calling breath in the palace thirty times. When preserving oneself, also call breath thirty times. Calling breath is the method of opening the mouth and exhaling. At that time one also feels the whole body warm; this is the proof of harmonizing the spirit and consolidating the soul. In preserving the One, all close and oversee the eyes, inwardly viewing the divine palaces.

The Way of preserving the One causes the Supreme Three Pure Qis to appear in the Three Palaces. The Three Pure are the Purple, Azure, and Scarlett three mysterious coloured Qis, with Purple above. Then preserve and guard the Three Ones within; by thought behold the Northern Pole Purple Portal Jade Palace, cause the heavenly officials to take their places, and think that I am to sit facing the Emperor; whatever I seek or beseech, then with the heart I bow. The Supreme is the Upper Purity; the Emperor of Upper Purity is most noble. The Northern Pole Purple Chamber is the Emperor's chamber. Also preserve one's own Three Ones and discuss with the Emperor the Way of flying truth and living birth.

Whenever before a sumptuous meal, one must correct the heart and preserve the One, then by thought take the One first to eat and drink, then signal to eat oneself. If done constantly thus, evil Qi will retreat and true Qi will come forward. After eating and drinking, the heart prays:

Hundreds of grains enter the stomach, unite with the spirit and Qi,  
Fill and supplement the blood, the corpse-evil perishes and falls off,  
Long life with Heaven and Earth, flying and ascending the Golden Gate,  
Commanding the six Ding, the spiritual youths attend and guard.

The method of preserving the One is, on Jiawu, Jiachen, and Jiayin days, at midnight, sweep and cleanse the quiet sleeping courtyard; spread a mat one zhang square; burn incense facing north and bow twice, or simply bow with the heart. Then gaze upwards at the seven stars of the Northern Dipper, cause the Purple Qi to emerge from the Dipper, enter and signal into the Three Palaces within the body. Facing north, place the hands on both knees, preserve the Three Ones, the Three Ministers, and the self; all ride the Purple Qi to ascend the Great Ultimate. The Great Ultimate is a star. Cause forgetfulness of body and loss of form, as if ascending to Heaven. Thus the Way of the Immortals is near. Immortals call it the Great Quiet. In yin and rain, one may meditate on the bed; or one may prepare an altar in a quiet place, one zhang square, fenced on all four sides with a fence several feet high; on the day one must constantly cultivate it. This is the Way of the Great Quiet.

The Way of preserving the One is to always watch for the moon's first rising; face the moon and bow twice, then softly pray:

Great Yin Mysterious Essence, Lady Bright Moon,  
First-born flowing light, illuminates my Three Palaces,  
Divine immortals ascend and fly, roaming high in eight directions,  
Wherever they turn their wish, all is among blessings.

The Way of preserving the One always preserves the Northern Dipper head star, the handle pointing forward; this is the essential formula to prevent a hundred evils and to destroy wicked Qi.

One who preserves the One must avoid eating the five pungent spices and all meat, and tread upon the ground of the houses of women in childbirth. On Jiǎzǐ days, preserve thought, and also avoid seeing drunkards and various foul odors; all are to be shunned with care. Do not hold infants, only one’s own son is allowed. Do not share clothes or shoes with others, or share beds or mats; only preserve the One. Think the true and quiet the spirit, call the Way to summon spirits; all may be done elsewhere, not only in this one matter.

Later the Holy Golden Gate Emperor received the "Three Origins True One Scripture," the "Great Ultimate Emperor True Talisman," the "Five Dipper True One Scripture," and the "Great Ultimate Emperor Precious Scroll" — all four formulas — which he afterwards transmitted to the immortal disciple Juan. Juan, fishing in the river, caught a fish and opened it, finding a green jade box, from which issued two talismans and two scripture methods. This is the Supreme Way of the Taoist Inner Hidden Earth Truth, and also allows attendance at the Upper Purity court, roaming the Great Ultimate, flying to and fro in the Kongtong, and resting in Kunlun.

According to the Four Extremes Bright Methods illuminating the spirit talisman, all holders of the Earth Truth Superior Scripture have limits on transmission years; the three officials swear an oath, entrust silk and blood at an altar, and make a cutting and sealing agreement before receiving the transmission. The receiver fasts for a hundred days, or fifty, or thirty, or twenty-one, or ten, or seven days. Only those who can teach a pure heart and trust in the truth may be taught the method of preserving the Three Origins True, using the talismans of the Two Emperors, ascending the Way of the Five Dippers — this is the highest Way of the Earth Truth. The method requires forty years to pass transmission to one person, and four hundred years to pass to ten persons only. If no such person appears, one may write a copy in white silk, seal it and store it in the hidden cliff chambers of the Five Sacred Mountains, requiring a copy every forty years to be written and sealed at these Five Mountains. The Five Mountains are gathered on one mountain only; it is not necessary to distribute copies evenly to all five mountains, but to take the one nearest the place of residence. If one cannot reach the Five Mountains, famous mountains will do. For example, to the north, Baodu; to the west, Difei; to the south, Luofu and Taihe; to the east, Tiantai and Kuohuo — these are the kind of famous mountains. If in four hundred years ten persons appear, they may be taught; beyond that limit no further transmissions may be made. Whoever violates the regulations and divulges secrets, not following the laws, will visit the Water Official and undergo the trial of the Wind Blade; their descendants will be destroyed and perish. The pledge of cutting and sealing in blood is received by the Azure Youth Lord, who issues it to the late learners for perpetual use and regulation. Those who receive the "Three Origins True One Scripture" must pledge before a Daoist master, a white silk eighty-seven feet long, and two pairs of silver rings; one copy uses white silk twenty-nine feet and one pair of silver rings. This is the complete set. Or three buttons may be used instead, to substitute for the cutting and sealing agreement without leaks. Those who receive the "Great Supreme Five Dipper True One Scripture" must pledge before a scripture master, purple silk forty feet, and two pairs of gold rings, to substitute for the blood oath and seals. Those who receive the Great Ultimate True Talisman must pledge before a talisman master, vermilion silk twenty feet. Those who receive the Great Ultimate Precious Scroll must pledge before a scripture and scroll master, blue silk twenty feet, to be used when ascending the altar and cutting hair, as an oath unto death. The receiver must await the utmost of Linze Mountain, and not rashly use the method for personal ends. Whoever violates and disobeys shall suffer cutting and removal as penalty, and their body shall fall into the Three Springs. Fathers and sons transmit in sequence, pledging oaths according to the regulations. The transmissions depend on masters and disciples, so as to exalt the root and clarify the suffering of heavenly sincerity. Moreover, this is not only applied here, but also to renew the instructions and methods anew. Those who do not have a preexisting immortal bone or mysterious talisman cannot hear or see the subtle Way of the True One.

The Primordial Heavenly Worthy Speaks the Mysterious Subtle Scripture is ended.
