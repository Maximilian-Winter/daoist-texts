# The Essential Jade Secret of the Three True Ones of Shangqing

Title of the Scripture: The Essential Jade Secret of the Three True Ones of Shangqing. The compiler is unknown; it is approximately from the Northern and Southern dynasties period. It is a collection of early Shangqing school cultivation scriptures and formulas. Liu Shipei considered this text to be the missing volume of Tao Hongjing’s "Secret of Ascending to Truth and Obscurity." The original number of scrolls is unknown. Two versions now survive: first, the Dunhuang manuscript P2576V; second, the "Orthodox Daoist Canon," Dongxuan section, Jade Secrets category. Both are incomplete. The present edition merges these into one.

## The Essential Jade Secret of the Three True Ones of Shangqing

[(Text missing at the beginning)]

The chromatic essence sutures the garment; the left hand holds the sun’s essence, the right hand grasps the moonlight, which is implanted within my upper palace, the Mud Pellet Palace. Thrice I call upon the Supreme Precious True Man, the Great Void supplies the Five Energies flowing essence. I contemplate my body, so that the five flavours reach the mouth and five throats. Looking upwards, I recite the incantation:

"Most High True Emperor, Five Emperors of the Great Void, preserve my Mud Pellet; the profound reflects the Five Forms; the Three Luminaries shine radiantly; sun and moon are perfectly clear; flying clouds and flowing mists, refining and infusing jade essence; refining form and preserving the soul; the spirit and soul arise spontaneously, transforming in myriad ways, ascending to the Purple Court." Thus completed, I draw the qi five times and cease.

The five directions’ command incantations being ended, I rub my palms together, wipe my eyes; thus for five years, my face shines with golden form, my five viscera flourish internally; the jade treasury preserves the qi; the divine immortal way is fulfilled; the three palaces are all free and fluent; the true spirits manifest in form, riding the void, harnessing emptiness, ascending to heaven in broad daylight. This is only for secret cultivation; be careful not to lightly transmit it.

Those who cultivate the highest method and recite the Way ten thousand times, aspiring truly to attain the spirits, seeking to become immortals, must on the eight seasonal days present piercing offerings at the Spirit Mountain of their birth destiny. They array their petitions to Jade Purity, and for three years must not fail, whereupon the name is recorded in the Azure Palace; the tags are bound by the Jade Emperor, Jade Splendour guards, Golden Morning receives and welcomes. This jade essence true formula is the imperial precious text. Those who attain this formula will within counted days ascend to immortality. To leak the divine text is a sin; the nine mysteries will be examined; the body perishes and the form remains; the river source shuts long. Only in secret cultivation is this true; the Way does not speak falsely.

## The Precious Jade Scripture of the Queen Mother of the West’s Daily Conduct

Copied by Lady Ziwei

When lying down at night, awakening often, then hastily closing both eyes, knock the teeth nine times, swallow saliva thrice, turn the tongue inward toward the throat; then move head and neck seven times; placing the hand on the side of the nose, move left and right, up and down dozens of times, softly reciting:

"Nine Heavens Supreme Emperor, Three Origins protect the infant; Most High moves splendour; Jade chamber emits essence; seven gates summon spirits; nine rooms receive brightness; ears keen and eyes clear; reach true reality and spirit; mountain in the heavens; harmonious qi balanced; proud lady of cloud ceremony; bright youth shining; mysterious wisdom brilliant; a hundred pavilions scattered; preserve harmony of the High Origin; wander in the golden court; five viscera radiate splendour; ears and eyes ever alive; divine platform rising; pillars and beams unshaken; seven spirits refined; three souls at yellow peace; Taiyi joins hands; five elders combined; without hero assisting; myriad evils vanish; myriad wishes fulfilled; sun and moon guard the gate; heart wanders among stars; immortal hopes announced; myriad spirits listen reverently."

When lying and waking, thus place the hand upon the incantation, do not forget it. Though the true Way be accomplished, always perform it. This is the supreme method of the "Most High Queen Mother of the West’s Precious Jade Scripture of Daily Conduct." It makes ears and eyes keen and strong in memory; smooths and balances the nose, preventing mucus; permeates the four quarters and eight directions; face has a youthful countenance; records soul and registers spirit; repels myriad demons. This is the wondrous method of the true man’s daily conduct. It is named thus because it must be practiced daily. When finished, wipe face and eyes with both hands, so that a gentle warmth becomes constant, often desired to be counted.

The Mother said: When a person grows old, the skin of the face first slackens beneath the eyes. Also, if the person’s body wraps little qi, it first slackens between the nostrils. These two places are the portals of the skin wrapping and the key passes of qi power. Therefore, daily practice of this method preserves the skin and qi’s power, maintaining health and harmony.

## The Jade Scripture of the Queen Mother of the West on Reversing the Fetus

Copied by Lady Ziwei

The Jade Scripture of Immortality states: With the hand spread on the side of the splendorous court, prolonging the true essence of harmony, ascend to the divine chamber, jade valley fills the Heavenly Mountain; the inner source of mysterious spirit appears; myriad demons clean themselves from the body; long life and immortality without death; jade register returns to the emperor lord, according to the sign of harmonious true essence within this secret mountain source.

The true essence lies between the two eyebrows, within the two corners of the brows; the true essence is below one point near the ear, the upper chamber of spirit attraction.

The inner source lies beneath the nose above the philtrum, at a small inlet of the valley beneath the nose; it is the mysterious spirit’s gate for extinguishing demons.

The splendid court lies beneath the two eyebrows, opposite the center of the brows; it is the passage for clear sight.

At dawn about to rise, or at dusk about to sleep, hastily close the eyes, turn the tongue in the throat, swallow saliva thrice, swiftly place the hand on these three places each thirty-nine times, pressing downward and do not lift the hand. Make this a constant practice to confer long life without death, to summon spirits and grant clear vision, to seal and extinguish the myriad ghosts’ path. When the hand placement is complete, softly recite:

"Most High Void Emperor, open and scatter the jade court; golden chamber bright and shining; emerald terrace lush and blue; I command the three ways; extinguish ghosts and living spirits; I am without death and also without birth; always living and free; return to infancy; soul and spirit gentle and refined; five spirits peaceful and calm; turn the whirlwind spirit’s gift; journey north to Jade Purity; ascend to Great Nothing; unite with the sun; merge with Heaven; thus become a true man; emperor lord unites with the obscure; the three have nothing to report; myriad spirits respectfully listen."

In the time of Duke Zhuang of Chu, there was a market officer named Song Yuanfu, of good heart, who constantly swept the market. Long after, a beggar entered the market for many months, singing daily songs:

"Heaven upholds life’s golden splendour; inner source reveals yin; jade valley joins mysterious village; jade and jade mutually support; true essence stands at the sun’s rise; flying medicine exudes spirit wonders; at dawn stands the celestial horse; wanders and drives the divine mysterious home; immortals come into the chamber; again wiping away a hundred demons."

Upon leaving, he inscribed the market gate thus. No one in the Chu market understood, but Yuanfu suddenly realized, suspecting a celestial being, though not understanding the meaning of the song. He thus bowed and inquired earnestly, and after long, the beggar revealed: "I am truly a True Man. This teaching is the Queen Mother of the West Kunlun’s method of immortality without death; those who know it do not die." He then taught Yuanfu the essential method for secret practice, accumulating twenty years; Yuanfu ascended to heaven in broad daylight; now he resides in the mysterious province, ranked as immortal minister. The Chu market beggar was the Southern Mountain True Man Chi Songzi, who divides form and casts shadow, assuming dust and confusion, roaming and gazing over the noisy filth, summoning and extending dark assemblies.

## The Clear Spirit True Man Pei’s Explanation of the Divine Treasure Scripture

To seek the essential Way, first make the eyes clear and ears keen, which is the foremost matter. Moreover, ears and eyes are the ladder and steps to seek truth, the gates to gather spirit; gain and loss depend on them; life and death require them. Now this copied scripture reveals the method to be applied.

The Dispel Demons Upper Chapter says: The ears require frequent rubbing, pressing their left and right sides, commanding countless times, called the cultivation and management of the city walls, recorded in the imperial register. The nose also requires frequent rubbing on its left and right, only commanding a count, called irrigating the central mountain, recorded in the emperor’s record.

These two instructions arose at the platform of the abbot’s spirit Li Fu, on the night of the twelfth day of the ninth month.

On Dao day, constantly place the hand over the small hollow behind the brows, rubbing thirty-nine times; also rub the lower part of the eye with the palm and fingers; raise the ears and move them thirty times, only commanding the count without timing. After finishing, reverse the hand over the forehead thirty-nine times, beginning from the middle of the brows, then upward into the hairline; beside the mouth swallow saliva in small and large amounts countless times. Practiced thus constantly, the eyes become clear. Within a year, one can write by night. This may also be done secretly at the philtrum; do not speak of the manner.

The hollow behind the brows is the supreme palace without six limits, governing the generation of eye brilliance, harmonizing and rendering pure the essence and light, preserving refined eye spirits; this is the true man’s supreme Way of sitting and rising. It is also called the true man’s constant dwelling in the inner scripture. The true man says: If you wish to write by night, practice constant dwelling. The reason the true man can observe all directions and illuminate the eight horizons is indeed the brightness of this constant dwelling count.

The lower part of the eye is the decision-ming protected chamber returning to infancy supreme Way; raising the ears and moving them is the deep illumination method. Thereby the blood vessels resolve, skin marks do not arise, the eye brilliance shines mysteriously, harmonizing spirit and essence in full. When a man grows old, he rarely does not begin with ears and eyes. The signs of old form also begin at the sides of the eye.

The true methods of cultivation always begin each dawn and dusk with spirit concentration and breath regulation; after a long time, place the hand on the forehead, inwardly hold the infant, sun and moon both bright, High Origin rejoices; begin the thirty-nine counts at the brows, end at completion; this is called the hand toward the Three Origins to strengthen the brain and firm the hair. The head and all four sides are rubbed with the hand, following the hair to knot, only commanding many strokes; thereby head blood disperses, wind and moisture do not congeal. When completed, place the hands on the four corners of the eyes and eyelids, two sets of nine times, feeling the vision become clear and distinct; this is the method to examine eye spirits; long practice will enable seeing myriad spirits.

The "Red Character Scripture" says: Constantly cover mouth and nose with the hand, facing eyes and seeing clearly for long time; liquid arises in the hand, then rub the face and eyes; constant practice causes the body to smell fragrant.

The "Most High Heavenly Pass Jade Scripture" says: Constantly press the eyes near the nose at both corners, hold breath while doing so; breath flow stops and resumes; constant practice renders the eyes able to see through.

The above two instructions were given by Lady Wei of the Southern Prison.

The "Red Character Purple Book Three Five Sequential Scripture" says: When sitting, close eyes inwardly, contemplate the five viscera and intestines and stomach; after long practice, clarity and brightness arise.

The "Great Elemental Elixir Scripture" says: On one side of the face, often desire to rub both hands until hot, following the shape top and bottom, making circular motions; this causes the face to have brightness and sheen; wrinkles and spots do not arise; after five years, the complexion is like that of a young girl; so called mountain and river circulating qi, always full and never exhausted.

The "Elixir Scripture" says: First rub hands together until hot, then wipe the face and eyes; then smooth hair with hand as if combing; both arms likewise mutually rubbing each other, so that hair does not whiten, and the pulse does not float or swell.

The "Great Cave True Scripture of Refined Scenes Massage Chapter" says: When rising and lying down, maintain even breath and correct sitting posture; first cross hands, then reach behind the neck, then face upwards, causing the neck to contest with the hands; do this three or four times, enabling spirit and blood to circulate, preventing wind and qi from entering; long practice ensures no death or sickness.

Also bend and stretch the body, extend hands in four directions, counter stretch sideways, pull and push; move and stir a hundred joints, each three times. When rising and lying, first wipe mouth and ears with a handkerchief or thick silk to warm and round; then smooth hair as if combing without obstruction; after long rubbing of both hands to treat face and eyes; long practice makes eyes bright and evil qi not invade; body not dirty or sticky, removing filth. When finished, swallow saliva thirty times to guide internal fluids.

The above instruction is from the "Great Cave Refined Scene Scripture."

## The Queen Mother of the West’s Reversing the Fetus Massage Jade Scripture

Copied by Lady Ziwei

The way of nourishing life regards ears and eyes as primary; varied vision darkens the eyes; extensive worries close the ears; these two ailments arise internally and form disease, not from external guests or false calamities. The difficulty of hearing the Way is not in hearing the Way itself, nor is difficulty in practicing the Way, but in finally attaining the Way. If ears and eyes are confused with wandering thoughts and do not dismiss hardships, even if one treads the immortal pavilion and grasps the dragon chariot, it is still of no benefit.

Reversing the fetus massage is always done on yang days. The first day of the month is yang. Every yang day at dawn and night, when lying and waking or about to rise, hastily close the eyes toward the birth destiny direction; rub palms together until slightly warm; wipe each eye left and right; palms cross and meet at the back of the neck nine times; then sustain the presence of purple, red and yellow clouds of qi in each eye, which descend into the ears. After a long time, softly recite:

"Eye pupil three clouds; bright eye true lord; brilliance infuses essence; open communication with imperial spirits; great mysterious cloud ceremony; jade spirit unfolds the text; preserve and profit two gates; open and clear the nine gates; respond to all joints; return liquid to the Mud Pellet; body ascends to jade official; listed among the Shangqing." Finished, swallow saliva three times; then open the eyes. Make this a constant practice on yang days sitting upright; no need to do dawn and dusk separately; practice for three years, ears and eyes become keen and clear.

When combing hair, always face the birth destiny; having begun combing, softly recite:

"Supreme Emperor scatters spirits; five elders reverse spirits; Mud Pellet mysterious splendour; preserve essence and long endure; left holds hidden moon; right draws sun root; six harmonies refined; myriad gods receive grace." Finished. Constantly practice this to prevent headache.

The "Supreme Ultimate Green Splendour Scripture" says: When combing hair, face the birth place; having begun combing, softly recite:

"Mud Pellet mysterious splendour; preserve essence and long endure; left is hidden moon; right is sun root; six harmonies refined; myriad gods receive grace." Finished, swallow saliva thrice. Constantly practicing this prevents hair loss and promotes growth. Count strokes carefully; comb much but without pain. The attendant may comb much too. Thus blood vessels do not stagnate and hair roots remain firm.

The above two instructions were given by Lady An Jiuhua.

When sitting or lying, always desire the nostrils to face the birth destiny; for eating and drinking also so. If unable to face the birth destiny, facing northeast or northwest is also good; these two places are the gates and passages of heaven and earth spirits.

Also, when lying down, constantly shake the body left and right dozens of times; then place hands behind back, lift head toward heaven, shake left and right twenty-one times; then sit upright and raise hands pointing heavenward; after a long time, rub palms to wipe eyes, reaching beside the ears; after a long time softly recite:

"Forward beats, backward points; Heavenly Emperor supreme guest; left glance, right look; long life and great measure; lift head and pant breath; Taiyi aids the utmost; avert eyes, dragon hides; life director joins feather; food and drink sustain fetal origin; cross gate Kunlun; wandering and overturning double avoidance; true men comrades." When finished, temporarily hold breath closed; preserve red qi in the navel as large as a pearl; exhale through the nose three times. This completes the massage method for all joints, making them clear and free; long life and no sickness.

The "Purple Degree Flame Light Inner Vision Middle Method" says: Often desire to close eyes when lying; calm body and subtle qi; make as if lying; so that I and others do not notice; then inwardly see afar and listen to four directions; make ears and eyes focus on things thousands of li away; long practice, one can also see events thousands of li distant; with concentrated heart one does so, thus seeing events a million li distant. Also the ears can often hear sounds of gold and jade, and music of silk and bamboo; this is a mysterious method. Regarding the four directions, first focus on one direction inwardly to watch and listen; at first this is utterly without imitation; after long time the spirit enters the mystery.

The "Great Cave True Scripture Highest Inner Chapter" contains a powerful incantation to suppress evil. It says: Whenever you pass dangerous roads or between ghost temples, or when the mind has doubts or slight fears, command the traveller to reverse the tongue inward to the throat, swallow saliva thrice, then with the left hand’s second and third fingers pinch the "Mountain Source" point beneath the nose at the philtrum, inside the nasal cavity; pinch thirty-six times, then press quickly, do not lift the fingers to count; the nasal cavity’s "Mountain Source" is also named ghost well, spirit pool, evil root, and soul platform. After pinching, knock the teeth seven times, then cover the nose with the palm; facing the eyes, softly recite:

"Vermilion crow soars to heaven; divine might expands within; Mountain Source’s four guards; ghost well flees and vanishes; spirit pool exhales qi; evil root hides concealed; soul platform shines fourfold; jade chamber scattered and gleaming; jade truth majestic; sits guarding bright hall; hand radiates purple haze; head erects divine light; chanting cave scripture; thirty-nine chapters; contains dispelling evil dragons and tigers; cutting prison and severing hills; fierce hunts and running bulls; holding knives and swallowing spears; lifting mountains and seizing heaven; divine sparrow and poisonous dragon; six heads spew fire; devouring ghost king; thunder and lightning; pulling stars and flowing horizontally; owls peck and clash; against wind they cross; heavenly birds arrayed; all near me; spew fire ten thousand zhang; to remove misfortune; myriad spirits open the way; seal and fall mountain village; thousand gods and hundred spirits; all bow heads; officiating officers hold censers; burning incense for me; wherever passing; myriad spirits welcome." Finished, knock teeth three times, then open eyes and remove left hand. The hand pressing Mountain Source closes the ghost well gate; hand lightly touching spirit pool scatters evil roots; hand facing soul platform lets jade truth guard the gate; thus inspiring the spiritual root, heavenly beasts come to guard; a thousand spirits tremble and prostrate; none harm my truth. This is natural principle, sudden and thus.

The Mountain Source beneath the nose is a flawed passage of the body; the gate for true and false; false brings evil qi; true restrains myriad evils; in my governance; therefore auspicious and inauspicious signs arise there. The bright hall also is the spirit pool of the body; the form house of life and death; the origin chamber of seven souls; the spirit dwelling of three souls; preserving its spirit allows insight within; neglect of its Way causes decay and rot; thus by my governance, carefully follow its guard; life causes repentance and affliction to be settled.

The above four instructions are from the "Great Cave True Scripture" highest chapter.

Tai Xu True Man said: The place where wind disease arises is at the hills and graves in damp shade; the three springs become blocked. Therefore the earth official uses water qi to excite and stir, often producing wind paralysis. The severe case causes the whole body to fail to move; the mild case causes half the body to fail; or loss of hands and feet. One will often dream of the northeast and northwest as former homes, or see the spiritual bed place, about to meet the tomb qi. The northeast of a grave is the place of severed fate; northwest is nine calamities; all these are inauspicious places of burial litigation; if one sees deceased among them, proof increases. Those who often have such dreams should when lying face upward, knock teeth thrice and say:

"Great Origin Most Profound; Nine Capitals Purple Heaven; govern soul and protect life; High Pure True Man; I wear supreme formula; receive teaching of Great Profound; long life and clear vision; body flies and becomes immortal; tombs forever peaceful; ghost litigation shut gates; soul and spirit harmonize; evil qi does not smoke; demons and monsters dare not harm my spirit; Northern Emperor restrains and controls; collects qi into abyss; recorded by Supreme Emperor; respectfully report to Jade Morning." After this recitation, knock teeth thrice more, then thrice more; thereafter no longer dream of tombs or family ghosts. This is Northern Emperor’s secret incantation; all with sincere good intent may do it. Those who often have evil dreams and bad omens may all carry out this method; thereby ghost qi perishes, evil spirits disperse and forms vanish.

Those whose arms cannot raise are sunk in wind-toxic qi obstructing the vessels and binding bones causing paralysis; should be cured by acupuncture; also should practice Northern Emperor’s winding incantation; if done a hundred times, illness will also disappear. First slowly massage the troubled arm with one hand, after long time, then gaze inwardly with eyes, swallow saliva thrice, knock teeth three times, softly recite:

"Most High Four Mysteries; Five Splendours and Six Courts; Three Souls and Seven Spirits; Heavenly Pass and Earth Essence; Spirit Palace and Camp Guards; Heavenly Fetus Supreme Brightness; Four Limbs and myriad gods; Nine joints and myriad spirits; recorded by Jade Morning; inscribed in Jade City; jade girls attend body; jade boys guard life; forever equal to the two luminaries; flying immortals of Shangqing; long with sun and moon; year by year declining; soaring and ascending to immortality; attain perfect peace; flowing wind cures disease; pouring ghost five dragons; demons, tomb qi; yin qi reciprocates; oppresses my four limbs; harms my vigor; Most High Heavenly Ding; dragon and tiger display power; cut ghosts and remove misfortune; wind evil immediately destroyed; examine and note hidden disputes; hundreds of poisons hidden and wrong; restore me to normal; sun and moon together shine; examine and catch offenders; Northern Star collects and destroys; if any interfere; a thousand lights shine supreme power." Finished.

The "Most High Record of Pure Dispersing Splendour Scripture" on massage says: At times of living qi, swallow saliva twenty-seven times; then massage the pain area; face the king and recite:

"Left mystery right mystery; three gods united in truth; left yellow right yellow; six splendours balanced; wind qi evil diseases; hidden and concealed in four directions; jade fluids flow and moisten; above and below communicate; internally dispatch water and fire; exclude misfortune; long life flying immortals; body always rested and strong." Finished, swallow saliva twenty-seven times more. Constant practice prevents disease; also should urgently massage the pain area twenty-one times.

The above instruction was given on the twenty-second day of the tenth month by Lady Wei of Canglang Yunlin Palace.

The "Dispel Demons Upper Spirit Scripture" says: If the body is uneasy, reverse the tongue and plug the throat, rinse saliva and swallow endlessly; in moments the unease and illness vanish; immediately one will feel the body relaxed and soft.

The above instruction comes from the "Dispel Demons Upper Spirit Scripture."

False dreams and illusions arise when spirits and evil qi conspire to disturb the heart, attempting to ambush the spirit within. Whenever evil dreams occur, simply face north and invoke the Most High Dao Lord, fully describing the vision in four or five words; it will then vanish.

The Green Youth Lord’s formula says: When encountering evil dreams at night, which are not good sleep, immediately turn the pillow and recite:

"Great Spirit Jade Girl; attend true spirit and guard soul; six palaces’ golden boys; come guard the gate of life; transform evil into good; report to the Three Origins; make me long live; ride scenes and drive clouds." Finished, swallow saliva seven times, knock teeth seven times, then lie down again. After four or five times, the evil dreams vanish. This incantation also reverses evil dreams, turning them into auspiciousness.

The above was given on the night of the thirteenth day of the eleventh month by Lady Youying.

The mysterious image spiritual pivot is the grand observer of destinations, heart clear and bright, void and wandering divine flavour; chewing and inhaling the Great Harmony, body qi pure and light; thereby jade vibrates and sounds; myriad silences mysteriously assemble. Qi is the craftsman of spirit and brightness, the origin of purity and impurity; dwelling in mystery is pure heaven, dwelling in man is the preservation of the body. Life and death, loss and gain, depend on the governance between. To master the six qi, always face the dawn, at the hours of Chou and Yin; according to heavenly time, create beginnings; must face this direction at these times. The great rosy radiance shines; red sun is born and light begins; spirit scene opens morning; cinnabar essence reveals dawn. First hold the sun like a chick in the Mud Pellet, then emit one qi, holding qi as black, called corpse qi; next emit two qi, holding qi as white, called old qi; next emit three qi, holding qi as blue, called death qi. Think of the qi emitted for a long time. All three colours emitted combine to emit six qi. Then slowly inhale yellow qi four times; then swallow saliva thrice; altogether three completions; then hold in Mud Pellet the sun rising from the eyes, exiting the mouth, about nine inches from the face; facing the eyes, imagine the scene as if seeing it; again ride the sun and inhale, take red qi seven times; after seven times, swallow saliva thrice and stop; then rise and sit, shake the four limbs, bow and stretch; regulate the pulses and channels; all completed. Hold saliva so that it is blue. At night one may also hold the moon in the Mud Pellet like the sun method. If holding the moon, use moon days one to fifteen nights; from sixteen to thirty days moon qi weakens and the heavenly fetus shrinks; not suitable to hold moon at night. This method is most wondrous; those who can practice it become immortals; therefore inhale and exhale fetus, rinse and clear, breathe and call the five throats; body obtains nature; soul returns to the crimson dwelling; spirit returns to the Mud Pellet; thereby longevity is attained. How unlike those who manipulate the yin qi of the dark valley, seeking the spirit of the running horse, crossing the sea to seek aid, driving a feathered chariot on the volcanic mountain! How can one not be cautious? How can one not be cautious?

The above is from the "Queen Mother of the West’s Preface Methods."

In the third year of Xingning, seventh month fourth day night of the yichou year, the Life Director Eastern Minister came down, accompanied by seven attendants entering the household. One held a purple fan banner; one held a splendid banner; one held the ten supreme spirits; one bore a book sac; three carried white ivory boxes, seeming to contain books; one held a flowing gold fire bell; attendants all wore cinnabar robes. The Life Director’s form was much smaller than the second brother; wore blue brocade skirt, purple fur headdress, lotus crown; the second brother came likewise to attend and stand; ordered to sit and then sat; spoke at length. On the night of the sixth day of the seventh month, the Life Director came again; after long time, instructed thus: If one must model after the profound image, pure and rare times, then rise above the myriad hidden weeds, fold wings and perch high, sense and taste the highest accord; the abyss rests, mountains stand; serene jade chapters; enjoy divine life treasures; abandon worldly attachments; tune and play clear spirits; pure scene in emptiness; five ways reveal brightness; colour ceases and waves transform; desiring to be light and level; empty and hollow mysterious path; no sight nor hearing; you then approach the supreme mystery; rise again to profound awareness; bright virtue complete within; spirit balance outside; eventually able to harness the cloud carriage to ascend the sky; record the Life Director’s red register only. If spirit scatters myriad thoughts and life is unstable, qi follows dust waves, heart is not truly settled; this greatly fatigues body and spirit in forests and mountains; indeed there is error before awakening. The Way is subtle and easy to seek; the Way is difficult and hard to attain.

On the fifth day of the month at midnight, hold the sun image in the heart, the sun enters by the mouth; let it illumine the heart within; together with the sun shines; after meeting, feel the heart warm; the rosy radiance manifests; after a long time softly recite:

"Great Bright nurtures essence; inwardly refines elixir heart; light and radiance combine; divine truth comes to seek." Finished, swallow saliva nine times. On the fifteenth, twentieth, and twenty-ninth days repeat as above; causing the person to open bright and discerning; all joints clear; face has jade light; body has golden sheen; practice for five years; Taiyi sends the precious carriage to receive; ascend the Great Heaven. Practice only requires counting; no need to do on these exact days.

The above is from the "Dispel Demons Scripture" Southern Prison Red Lord inner method.

Also it says: Before eating, do not speak of death matters; do not expose food, or evil qi will come. Also bathe frequently; on jiazi days take bath; if not, then at the first day of each month; thus one remains connected to spirit. Bathing number is not a concern; concern is that people cannot do it; to cleanse and refine corpse stench and true qi enter.

The above was ordered by Master Wei’s wife to be practiced.

The "Most High Nine Transformations Ten Changes New Easy Scripture" says: When treading upon filth and uncompetitive places, first bathe and cleanse, to loosen the body and remove it. The method uses ten liang of bamboo leaves, four liang of white peeled peach skin, one hu and two dou of clear water; boil in a pot, do not allow it to boil over; temperature moderate; bathe the body with it; all filth is removed. Having removed filth, also dispels damp paralysis, sores, and itching diseases. Bamboo is hollow and white inside; peach skin repels evil and expels filth; thus these two substances are used to remove dregs and filth from the body. When heaven and man descend, all without exception use this water to cleanse themselves. As for worldly talisman water for blessing and rinsing external places, none compares to this formula. If bathing is better, do not use this water for washing hair; the refined corpse essence is best for bathing the body alone. Truly wondrous and secret.

The above ordered by the Purple Dragon Feather Palace Lady Ziwei.

On the tenth, seventeenth, and twenty-seventh days of the month, at night, at fixed time, gaze into the mouth of the Northern Dipper to see a great star; then call the Heavenly Master, Sacrificing Minister so-and-so, bow twice and respectfully announce; beseech to grant longevity. Always at dusk press eyes’ corners, preserve spirit light; if flickering red and yellow then auspicious; do not forget. Body is one, spirit is myriad; cannot be confused. If wishing to lie down, think on body and spirit; if wishing to rise, think on body and spirit. These are three methods.

The above is from the "Essentials of the Way."

At cockcrow about to rise, first bend left hand and touch salt finger; direct right hand to gaze at salt finger; rub mutually; then recite:

"The Queen Mother’s daughter named Yiyu, grants me elixir; receive it in the mouth; accumulate essence and rub the form." Always at cockcrow, swallow saliva twenty-seven times; clear the eyes of dimness; bring forth essence light; clear vision for myriad li; see all directions. Swallow saliva twenty-seven times; rub eyes twenty-seven times with fingers; causing the eyes never to close; so-called spitting hand Yang brightness rubbing eyes.

The above is from the Nine Capitals.

Then tap teeth, mouth as Heaven’s Gate drum, thirty-six taps; rinse with sweet spring water, swallow thrice; called the Heavenly Drum, preserving body and myriad spirits.

The above is from various books.

At dawn rising, sit facing east; rub hands together to heat; rub forehead, upward to top of head, counting twenty-nine times; called Mud Pellet.

Then rub hands together to heat; rub face and into hair three times; able to rub whole body is better; called Qian bath.

Then rub hands together; after rubbing forehead, place hands over both ears, up and down twenty-one times; causing one never to be deaf.

Then close nose and hold breath; right hand from top of head pulls left ear twenty-one times; then left hand from top of head pulls right ear twenty-one times; causing long life.

Then rise and dress; when girding, use wu and ji. Suppose the jiaxu ten-day period, face Yin place; jiayin ten-day period, face Wu place; jiashen ten-day period, face Zi place; jiawu ten-day period, face Xu place; jiachen ten-day period, face Shen place; jiazi ten-day period, face Chen place. This is called girding wu and ji; long without cold.

Then begin to walk; first left foot forward, saying Qian; then right foot forward, saying Yuan; next left foot forward, saying Heng; then right foot forward, saying Li; then left foot forward, saying Zhen. Having finished, this is called walking Qian Yuan.

Go to petition and state your name, left straight spirit, right straight spirit, earth life director, blue lady, record certain jia death register, enter gate lord, and lady. May be accepted; also secretly tell it; do not let voice be loud.

Urination and defecation toward the six dings. Suppose the jiazi ten-day period, face Dingmao; urination toward Mao place; jiaxu ten-day period, face Chou place; jiaxin ten-day period, face Hai place; jiawu ten-day period, face You place; jiachen ten-day period, face Wei place; jiayin ten-day period, face Si place. This is called urination and defecation toward six dings.

The above eight instructions are from the "Scripture of Nature."

Before eating and drinking, first state your name; establish the body for the Way; the body is heavenly treasury; Way father and mother; true men and immortals; divine men and saints; I together drink food and drink; spirit men and jade women attend on the left side; hold my immortal register; life without end.

The above is from the "Essentials of the Way."

To take the essence of sun and moon, on the first day of the month at dawn, when the sun rises about three zhang high, gaze afar and then grasp firmly the Yu step; with the mouth remotely draw the sun’s essence seventy-two times, swallowing it. This may be taken by three people entering households of plague; other illnesses end without affecting those who take it; constant practice causes old age and longevity. On the third day of the month, moon rises at geng; both hands grasp firmly and face southwest; toward the moon take Yu step; with the mouth remotely drink moon essence seventy-two times, swallowing it; whole year without disease. Also may enter households of mourning; sun and moon illuminate blemishes and filth.

The above two instructions on eating sun and drinking moon remove all qi ailments.

Born with the Way, dwell with the spirits in the same hall; true men of certain jia, always none say death. The right ear whispers speech.

Dwell with the Way in the same room; with the spirits in the same chamber; true men of certain jia; longevity like Heaven and Earth. The right front whispers.

Dwell with the Way in the same chamber; with the spirits holding the same功; true men of certain jia; longevity and Heaven and Earth united. The right rear whispers.

Whenever wishing to walk at night, call Tianpeng; the one who answers goes before; also repel tigers and wolves. The right night walk speaks.

Always at dawn and dusk face north; first store the five viscera qi; think liver qi as pure blue; heart qi as bright red; lung qi as pure white; kidney qi as deep black; spleen qi as bright yellow; think five viscera qi calm; knock teeth thirty-six times; recite:

"Tianpeng Tianpeng; nine origins kill boys; five dings all commanders; tall fierce northern duke; seven administration eight spirits; Most High vast malice; long skull huge beast; hand holds imperial bell; white owl three mornings; stern drives Kui dragon; mighty sword divine king; cut evil and destroy trace; purple qi ride heaven; cinnabar cloud brilliant; swallow demons and eat ghosts; horizontal body drinks wind; blue tongue green teeth; four eyes old man; heavenly ding strong man; mighty south repels evil; heavenly steed stirs wrath; mighty north holds blade; three hundred thousand soldiers; guard my ninefold; repel corpses a thousand li; also drive off misfortune; dare any small ghost; desire to come and harm; seize great heavenly axe; cut ghosts five forms; Flame Emperor fierce blood; Northern Emperor true bones; four brightness breaks bones; heavenly policy destroys species; divine knife one stroke; myriad ghosts collapse."

The above ghost incantation is four words with one tooth knock as rhythm. All myriad ghosts under heaven submit in awe; any who desire to harm, hearing this incantation immediately vanish; Northern Emperor’s great demon always fears this incantation; always able to use it; can traverse the world; spirits and ghosts submit and follow. Do not rashly say there is this incantation method; always keep secret and practice. The master’s formula says: If the body is not refined and pure, do not lightly practice incantations; you must be cautious.

Always at cockcrow grasp firmly, wear heavenly pillar; knock teeth twenty-seven times; think twelve parents around the head; think twenty-four divine men arrayed on the body; think twenty-four sages on earth surrounding the body; then place left foot heel in the great hole; then hastily grasp firmly; reverse tongue toward throat; hold breath; think royal qi in front; think all heavenly gods, mountain and river five mountains spirits and officials; down to all myriad people; all come to court me; from heaven to earth; none not trembling and submitting. Finished, then breathe freely.

The above is the Great One’s Great Heaven Great Prohibition method.

The seven souls bathe and refine; do not move or lean; long with the three souls; hidden and concealed in the imperial court; preserve harmony of the three origins; reach truth and attain spirit; myriad evils vanish; I attain long life; thus become true man; ascend to heavenly court.

The above is Taiyi’s regulation on the seven souls, often practiced; three souls guarded; seven souls in peace; no more death time; constantly practice; do not let others see.

When taking fasting and entering chamber, first drive off ghosts and illnesses; also guard against one hundred trials; then relax the inner palace and recite; facing north knock teeth thirty-six times; softly say to Jade Purity Qiongyuan Lord:

"Six heavenly great demon kings; restrained in quiet void; giant beasts in red armour; poisonous dragons with four throats; white rat howling upward; fierce claws shaking boldly; myriad spirits hidden; destroy evil and break monsters; heavenly ding one as one; five mountains open court; wind and fire expedition; nine heavens fan whirlwind; shine brightly." Then close eyes tightly; bathe and refine the form and essence; adjust and investigate the three palaces; preserve one and six courts; emperor lord composes evening; ministers assist and illuminate; harmonize qi and fluids; court the nine spirits; five gods peaceful; liquid sources full; white origin opens truth; no hero spreads life; reveal scene stealthily bright; four virtues in balance; radiance and brilliance within treasure; sing and enjoy cave clarity; Great Elemental arrayed map; longevity also unshaken.

On birth destiny day and at places of heart fright, close gate and concentrate thought; knock teeth thrice; calm breath; upright body facing north; mind held and softly say:

"Rolena morning; fangnai pass refined; banmu bold and fierce; giant snake feared; hecha white rat; danli great demon; true fragrance broadly spread; empty spirit stands in heaven; comprehensively oversee auspicious and inauspicious; open way and clear mystery; dance and glance at myriad sorts; command and include numerous branches; hundred directions and thousand places; all open and clear; heaven and earth equally regulated; who says can carve away."

The above two instructions are from "Cave Truth Golden Mystery Eight Scenes Jade Register" incantations; do not lightly incant; be cautious.

For great cold, take qi through the nose; swallow thrice without cease; for swallowing qi is enough.

For great heat, take qi through the nose; swallow again slowly; also first nasal qi then mouth exhales qi; heat then stops.

The above two instructions are from the "Huangzi Breathing Scripture."

At that time eighty-five thousand Vajra spirits were guardians; so they controlled and subdued the hearts of the dark and bright throngs; then spoke incantations:

"Thunder fire bright sky; divine light radiant and mysterious; poisonous dragons four stationed; spirit tigers eight circling; headband seven stars; feet step Big Dipper and Ox; divine knives arrayed in constellations; golden hooks shine essence; chief commander mighty troops; soaring step void travel; cut off demons and evil; under destroy roaming spirits; pull liver and gall; invert intestines break vessels; left cut right reach; boil and roast heads; sever demon qi source; gather and bind grievances; devour ghost messengers; crush pull and swallow; shaman and folk songs and drums; drink blood and eat flesh; form is pungent and bones foul; monsters overturn; fishy restless filthy base; heart and form flatter and slander; divine pestle shatter heads; golden knife slit belly; hide evil and conceal harm; sudden come to subdue; left hold golden talisman; right hold crime list; Taiyi golden bell; void emperor jade baton; know faults but not amend; hang head and self sever; what demon not perish; what spirit not vanish; six spirits do not hide; seven stars split blood; above there is heavenly master; below there are vajras; all claim to subdue qi; mouth spews spirit rays; drink from cinnabar pool; feed on mysterious frost; five viscera produce splendour; long preserved without bounds."

At that time great ghost king with four eyes and lightning body, also guardian; dispelled misfortune; guarded Daoist place; inspected treachery and corrected faults; subdued evil men and all outsiders without belief; then spoke incantations:

"Divine wind brushes dust; uproot evil root; six heavens lose essence; five poisons perish grievances; golden head iron teeth; devour ghosts and lost souls; peach light arrayed at gates; double luminaries shine at doors; running stars kill qi; bright and without fear; all vessels flow and stream; seven channels regulated; spirit calm and body balanced; longevity without death."

The above two incantations are from the "Most High Jade Purity Scripture," seventh chapter, "Dao Transforms Four Barbarians" section.

The Fengdu Palace hymn says:

"Zhou severed the imperial spirit; honestly facing heavy calamity; fiery like smoke in the sky; raging like shining splendour; Wu city wears divine edge; calmly shines swallowing Clear River; Changhe approaches Red Well; Yunmen towering and rugged; seven nones communicate strange covers; Lianwan also spreads demons; six heavens traverse northern way; this is the home of demons and spirits."

Recite these six heavens’ palaces to repel ghost and evil.

Silent communication sends forth feelings; mysterious qi governs sound; high wheel though uneven; ten thousand fathoms come seeking; rustling natures Daoist child; harmonize spirits and contract spirit collar; entrust and submit to worldly transformations; heart marks deep forest; contemporaneous reason outside wandering; together quiet at eastern mount. This expresses feeling, entrusted here by fate.

Drive carriage to vast Feng’a; escape traces and transcend shadowy village; in the void there are things; within and without have no permanence; realize words of void and limitlessness; together meet over Hao Bridge; eye sees profound understanding; ghosts and spirits reason forgotten. This is discourse on the mysterious subtlety of man and ghosts.

Luo Feng mountain lies in the north Gui place; mountain high two thousand six hundred li; circumference thirty thousand li; beneath the mountain lies a cave heaven, circumference fifteen thousand li; above and below are ghost and spirit palaces; mountain has six palaces; cave has six palaces; each palace a thousand li circumference; these are six heavens’ palaces of ghosts and spirits. Mountain palaces are outer palaces; cave palaces are inner palaces; the arrangements are equal.

One is Zhou severing Yin heaven palace; second Tai killing honest matter ancestor heaven palace; third bright morning withstands Wu city heaven palace; fourth calm shining crime qi heaven palace; fifth ancestral spirit seven non heaven palace; sixth daring manage Lianwan repeated heaven palace. Recall these six heavens’ palaces; then knock teeth six times; then lie down to repel ghost evil qi. When wise men and saints pass away, they first enter the bright morning third heaven palace to receive affairs; fortune and misfortune, good and evil, all fates and calamities come from the calm shining fourth heaven palace, governed by the Northern Dipper lord here.

Ghost official incantation says:

"I am Most High disciple; below command six heavens; six heavens’ officials; are my department; not only my department, but Most High’s authority; I know six heavens’ palace names; therefore long life; dare any offend; Most High will cut your form."

The above is from the "True Decree on Elucidating the Subtlety," volume five.

Thus ends the Essential Jade Secret of the Three True Ones of Shangqing.
