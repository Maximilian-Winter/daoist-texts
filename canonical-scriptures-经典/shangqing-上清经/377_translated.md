# Secret Methods of Cultivation in the Supreme Clarity

(Dunhuang manuscript p. 2732, originally incomplete at beginning and end, without title. Dayuan ren’er tentatively attributes it to the Southern Qi Daoist Gu Huan as a fragment of his “True Record”; Rao Zongyi’s collation supports its being a lost text of the Liang dynasty Tao Hongjing’s “Secret of Ascending to the True Hidden” [登真隐诀]. Here the title is provisionally given as “Secret Methods of Cultivation in the Supreme Clarity.”)

Preserving life, emerging from the storehouse of light to concealment, the five spirits transform and divide, uniting the bright fan of emptiness. At times one rides the six clouds, harmoniously encompassing the body, ascending the nine heavens with seven tones. When complete, one knocks the teeth seven times, then opens the eyes; the matter is accomplished. Formerly there was the method of taking in the mist, which begins thus: Mist is the essence of the mountains, marshes, water, and fire, the full qi of metal and stone. But what we now take in is yet the qi of the five viscera within us; why so? It is said that by calling forth the twenty-four qi outwards to intermix with the external mist, the two vapors unite in body, and then taking it in fifty times, one obtains the mist qi connecting twenty-sixfold. This Way is wondrous and mysterious; in the Divine Land of Xuan Capital many have attained this art; thou mayst practise it. This is also told to Lord Yang. Long practising it, one constantly rides the clouds and mist in wandering. Furthermore it is said: With long taking in, one can disperse the form and enter emptiness, uniting with the cloud qi in body. Thus speaks the Right Central Lord.

The Book of Yang: The Great Diamond Sandalwood

Du Guangping received from Jie Yan the technique of Xuanbai, also named the internal method of the embryo essence in the central light of Xuanbai. Every dawn and every evening, sitting or lying at will, retaining in the cinnabar pellet a black qi, a radiant qi. From the bones and flesh of the arms and within the flesh, it passes through to flow upward to the shoulders and armpits, yet the sun remains in the grasp. The radiant qi suddenly becomes fire, burning the arms, making thorough passage inside and out for a long while. One arm is preserved as if in the state of burning charcoal, crackling softly. When complete, one recites the yin incantation: “Four Brightnesses of the Upper Origin, the division of the sun and moon’s qi, the flowing light shining brilliantly, pouring the liquid to condense the soul, the divine fire dispersing the shadows, purifying the smoke, penetrating the wind-evil, all foulness burning brightly, thus obtaining longevity, the four limbs complete, banishing lecherous and harmful ghosts, collecting and consigning them to the six tones of the North Star.” When finished, one contemplates long, letting go of the body and forgetting the self. Retaining the fire which burns the afflicted places left and right, one feels the heat in force; after long time, delight arises and the self is forgotten: here is the completion. Formerly the Chief Clerk suffered from a weak arm, thus the young lord taught this method alone. It is to enable the practitioner to rid himself of all wind spasms and ailments; it may be applied. It is not only for the arm; if the head, face, or four limbs be afflicted, all should be treated thus. Wherever the sun is, there is no need to grasp it; only let it burn where the ailment is. This also controls and repels tomb disputes and examinations of the black ones.

The foregoing preserves life thus, saying it is the secret incantation for dispelling and rubbing. This is what is called the method of dispelling and rubbing to cure sickness.

One customarily, when vital breath is present, faces the ruler and recites incantations; then it is suitable first to face the ruler seated at the table. Spitting twice and knocking the teeth seven times, then at the place of pain on the table one presses thirty-one times. This means where there is pain, one uses the hand to press swiftly and strongly; when the heat is at its height, one raises the hand slightly and presses again, altogether thirty-one times. Though there be no definite place of pain, one often first rubs and presses the body and recites incantations, but without limiting the number. Facing the ruler and reciting incantations, one should also quietly say: “Left Xuan, right Xuan, the three spirits united in truth; left yellow, right yellow, the six florescence correspond; wind drives away evil sickness, hiding on all sides; jade liquid flows and moistens, communicating above and below; internally sending water and fire, externally repelling inauspiciousness; attaining longevity and flying immortality, the body always strong and rested in the six tones.” When completed, again spit twice and knock the teeth seven times. Constant practice thus wards off sickness. Then one must swiftly press the painful places thirty-one times.

This comes from the Canglang Yunlin Palace, Lady Right Heroic King, saying it is taken from the “Taishang Record of the Scripture of Pure Manifestation” upper table rubbing method, also saying it repels the secondary heart qi. Formerly when wind disease came to this place, there were four types; these were all told to the Chief Clerk by the multitudes of perfected ones, merely spoken as matters of fact.

Writing of the Chief Clerk

Constantly with the hand pressing behind the brows in the small space nine times three. Each time using the third finger to press the hollow behind the brows; this hollow has a small hole, knocking the teeth to hear four movements; this is called the mansion of the six combinations. Then with hand and fingers rubbing under the eyes on the temples. Each also uses the third finger and the palm to rub transversely the hollow under the temples and eyes, towards the eye gates, both hands following each other, also to be done twenty-nine times. Then with the hand rotating the ears, performing thirty rubs. Each also with the thumb in the tiger’s mouth applies it to the ears, moving upwards to the top of the head, rubbing without fixed number or rhythm. When finished, one reverses the hand to ride the forehead thirty-nine times, beginning from between the brows, then upward into the hairline. Then with both thumbs supporting above the ears, the hands bring the two little fingers together, from above the brows to the forehead, entering the hairline and emerging at the top of the head. Beside the mouth one spits, more or fewer times without count. When beginning to ride the forehead, one immediately spits, continuing to the end. Practising thus constantly, the eyes become clear and bright; in a year one may read by night.

With the hand riding inside the forehead, one retains the red child’s sun and moon brightness, the upper origin joy, three nine beginnings at the brows, counting until finished then stopping. This is called the method of the hand facing the three origins, strengthening the brain and hardening the hair. When riding the forehead, one should contemplate the cinnabar pellet palace of the upper origin red child’s name in the eye centre, with a calm and joyful countenance; and in the bright hall the left sun and right moon illuminate the palaces within the head. The four sides of the head are ridden with both hands, following the hair knots, only in abundance. Then the head’s blood disperses and flows, wind and dampness do not congeal. After finishing riding the forehead, if pain arises, one may alternately lift the hand upwards through the hair, tossing it gently without fixed number, feeling the thorough passage of a slight heat, which then ceases.

When all is complete, one presses the four corners of the eyes twenty-nine times, feeling the vision become clear and bright. This tests the method of the eye spirits; with long practice, one obtains vision of the myriad spirits. Each hand uses the second and third fingers to press, causing one to see purple, blue, and red three-coloured light, round and shining clearly. All previous matters are done in order, each done in turn, each time wishing to concentrate long, not to rush or omit. Diligent practice so that the hands do not leave the face is best. Even perfected beings do not abandon it. When there is leisure in cultivation, one may do it without waiting for the proper season, thereby increasing constancy.

So speaks Pei Qingling. This Way comes from the “Taishang Precious Spirit Scripture.” At first this scripture was not transmitted to the world, but in time, those who become perfected sometimes obtain it. The preface to the rubbing method states that the copied scripture refers only to this one matter. The Southern perfected say: “The Precious Spirit Scripture” is in Pei Qingling’s brocade pouch, carried by attendants; formerly received from Lady Ziwei; I also have it thus, written in the Western Palace’s settled version. The “Precious Spirit Scripture” has another large scroll, which is a key method for governing the body, and only perfected beings receive it.

Writing of the Chief Clerk

When sleeping at night, one often turns; quickly closing both eyes, several times through the night one feels the practice, and performs it all, not forgetting. Knocking the teeth nine times, spitting nine times, then with the hand pressing the sides of the nose, left and right, up and down several tens of times. Both hands’ second and third fingers rub and press, starting from beneath the nose to between the brows, about twenty-nine times. Slightly reciting: “Supreme Four Brightnesses, nine gates emitting essence, ears and eyes profound and thorough, communicating truth and reaching spirit, the heavenly platform, flowing boundaries balanced and even, the proud maiden’s cloud-like bearing, eyes bright as children’s, splendid and clear, a hundred steps far-sighted and bright, protecting harmony of the upper origin, wandering the nine cities, the five viscera implanted firmly, ears and eyes self-generated, heavenly platform flourishing white, pillars and beams unshaken, seven souls polished and refined, three souls peaceful and secure, the red child carrying brightness, ever beside me; who dares to cover my ears and eyes? The Supreme One shall shatter with flowing bells; all evils vanish, wishes fulfilled; sun and moon guard the gates; heart stores the five stars; the truly august bless; all sounds respectfully listen in fourteen tones.” When finished, again spit nine times. Rub and wipe face and eyes to produce slight heat, regarded as the usual desire. When sleeping and waking, always press and recite thus; do not miss a single sleep. Though the true Way be attained, among us we still constantly practise it, but no longer use it at sleep, arising naturally to do it seated. This method is done at sleep and waking; fearing that men might suspect perfected beings also indulge in slumber, this is why it is explained as done sitting, so it is not necessary to use it only at sleep and waking.

Lady Ziwei says: This is the incantation from the “Taishang Precious Spirit Scripture,” the higher way. It makes the ears and eyes keen and clear, strengthens memory and enlightenment, balances the nose, stops the flow of saliva, four sounds and eight thoroughfares, a youthful face, restrains soul and records spirit, repels a thousand disturbances, the seven orifices channel flowing colors like pure flowers — truly the wondrous Way of daily conduct. Hence the name “daily conduct”; the constant practice. This also corresponds to matters in the “Precious Spirit Scripture.” Lady Pei’s statement concludes thus, returning again to this; hence it is said that these incantations are in the “Precious Spirit Scripture.” Likewise, it is not necessary to stop at night sleep and waking, but also at daytime sleep may be constantly used. The preface to the incantations all have excellent sayings; how may one be remiss?

Writing of the Chief Clerk

Heavenly truth is between the brows, at the corners of the brows — these are the two inner ends of the brows. First each uses the third finger to press them. The “mountain source” is said to be the base of the nose below the “white bit” — the lower root of the philtrum — a small valley inside below the nose. Opposite this is the hollow inside the nose. Next with the two hands’ third finger tips pinching and pressing Hua Ting, beneath the two brows, which thoroughly sees the salivary beam. Below the brows, on the upper bone socket of the eye enclosure. Next each transversely presses with the third finger. Tian Zhi eight is the upper chamber for guiding the spirit. This sentence repeats the meaning of the previous brow corner. Morning, noon, evening: morning is the first watch, the hour of the ox and tiger; noon, the hour of noon; evening, the first watch of the dog and pig. Spit three nine times; after spitting, press swiftly with the hand thirty-nine times; regard this as usual. Each place is pressed in turn, thrice nine times, then the next place. This causes the spirit to be brought through and the vision to be clear, obstructing the way of myriad evils. It is done thrice daily, thus not at night. Press and recite: “My method is all completed, then incant.” To press and incant means to recite incantations while pressing, so that one or two places receive it; the final pressing at Hua Ting near the eyes is also recited.
