## The Scripture of the Precious Spirits of the Western Queen Mother of Perfect Truth, Concerning Rising and Resting

The Precious Spirits of the Western Queen Mother, on Rising and Resting

When sleeping at night, upon awakening, and when about to rise at dawn, one should often change posture, then quickly close the eyes; knock the teeth nine times in succession; swallow saliva thrice completely; turn the tongue inward toward the throat; then shake the head and move the nape seven times. Thereafter, press with the hands on the edges of the nostrils, left and right, up and down, several tens of times. When finished, softly recite:

"Nine Heavens' Supreme Emperor, Three Primes who preserve the Infant, the Most High who moves the splendour, Jade Chamber that emits essence, the Seven Gates summon the Spirits, Nine Chambers receive the Brightness, ears sharp, eyes clear, communicating with Truth and reaching the Spirit, the Mountain in Heaven, harmonizing the qi to adjust and balance, the Proud Maiden with cloud-like manners, eyes bright and shining, the Mysterious Window radiant and clear, a hundred eaves shimmering, preserving harmony and the Upper Prime, wandering around the Golden Court, the Five Viscera glowing with splendour, ears and eyes ever alive, the Spirit Platform towering, pillars and beams unshaken, the Seven Souls washed and refined, the Three Spirits calm and yellow, the Most High takes my hand, joining with me, the Five Elders mingled, no aid from heroes or ministers, all ten thousand evils vanish, all wishes must be fulfilled, the Sun and Moon guard the gates, the heart wanders the bright stars, as the Immortal Emperor commands, all myriad spirits reverently listen."

Upon waking and sleeping, one should accustom oneself to pressing and reciting thus, and never forget it. Although the True Way is attained, one must constantly practise it. This is the highest method of the Jade Scripture of the Precious Spirits of the Western Queen Mother on Rising and Resting. It renders the ears and eyes sharp and bright, strengthens memory and clears understanding, harmonizes the nose so that no foul nasal discharge arises, the Four Ministers and Eight Passages are perfected, the face bears a youthful countenance, the soul is controlled and the spirit recorded, repelling ten thousand demons. This is the wondrous Way of the Perfected on rising and resting. Therefore it is so named, for it is always to be practised at rising and resting.

Again, rub the face and eyes with both hands, until a slight warmth arises, making this a constant practice, often repeating it. The Mother says: In man's decline, wrinkles first begin beneath the eyes; and when body and qi decay, it first begins between the two nostrils. These two places are the gates and windows of wrinkles and decay, and the passes of qi force. Therefore, one must constantly practise this method at rising and resting, to ward off wrinkles and decay, and to preserve qi and force in health and harmony.

## The Jade Scripture of the Precious Birth and Deathlessness of the Western Queen Mother

The Jade Scripture of Deathlessness states: With the hands spread upon the sides of the Floral Court, gently prolonging and harmonizing the Heavenly Truth, ascending to the Spirit Ravine Chamber, the Jade Valley fills the Heavenly Mountains. The inner source of the Mysterious Spirit is revealed, and all demons self-annihilate. Longevity is eternal and deathless. The Jade Register returns to the Imperial Lord, following the trace of Heavenly Truth, pressing this secret mountain source.

The Heavenly Truth lies between the brows, in the inner corners of the brows; the Heavenly Truth lies one fen beneath the ear, which is the upper chamber for guiding the spirit.

The Mountain Source lies beneath the nose, above the philtrum, on the side of its root; it enters a small aperture in the Valley of Holes beneath the nose. This is the gate sealing off ten thousand demons.

The Floral Court lies beneath the brows, opposite the centre under the brows; it is the bridge for penetrating vision.

At dawn when about to rise and at dusk when about to lie down, quickly close the eyes; with the tongue turned inward toward the throat, swallow saliva thrice; then quickly press with the hands on these three places, each nine times, pressing downward; do not raise the hands. Make this a constant practice, enabling long life without death, descending spirit and penetrating vision, sealing and destroying the path of ten thousand ghosts. When the hand-pressing is finished, softly recite:

"The Most High, the Void Sovereign, opens and scatters the Jade Court, the Golden Chamber shines bright, the Emerald Platform towers green. I govern the Three Ways, destroy ghosts and generate spirits; I can be deathless, also able to be without birth. Long life is at ease, reversing old age and returning to infancy; soul and spirit receive refinement, the Five Spirits rest peacefully, returning the whirling chariot wheels, northward to pay homage at Jade Clarity; ascending the Supreme Origin, joining with the sun, becoming a Perfected, the Imperial Lord uniting with darkness, the Three Primes proclaim, ten thousand spirits reverently listen."

In ancient times, in the era of Duke Zhuang of Chu, there was a market superintendent named Song Yuanfu, a benevolent man, who always swept the market. For a long time, there came a beggar who dwelt in the market for a year. Each morning he begged while singing loudly, the song’s words being: "The Heavenly Court produces golden splendour, the inner source obstructs yin and evil, the Jade Valley participates with the Mysterious Ministers, the jade qi mutually supports the web; the Heavenly Truth stands above the sun, flying medicines emit wondrous spirits; at dawn press the Heavenly Horse, circling the mysterious divine abode; Immortals come to enter the chamber, also to destroy a hundred demons." Upon leaving, he inscribed the market gate thus. None in the market understood, but Yuanfu suddenly comprehended in his mind, suspecting it was an Immortal, though not understanding the song’s meaning. He therefore prostrated himself and asked repeatedly. The beggar said: "I am truly a Perfected; these words are the song of the Precious Birth and Deathlessness of the Western Queen Mother of Kunlun; the knowledgeable shall not die." He then taught Yuanfu the essential secret method to practice in secret. After twenty years, Yuanfu ascended to heaven by day, now residing in the Mysterious Isle, a position among the Immortal Ministers. The Chu market beggar was the Perfected Chi Songzi of the Southern Mountain. At that time the form divided and scattered its light, temporarily dwelling amid dust and filth, wandering and gazing at the noisy and filthy, calling and welcoming the true meeting.

## The Scripture of the Clear and Void Perfected Pei on the Spirit Treasure

It is said: To seek the Way, one must first make the eyes clear and the ears sharp, for these are the chief matters. The ears and eyes are the ladder and steps for seeking the truth, the gateways for comprehending the spirit. Success or failure is determined by them; life or death depends upon them. Now, by copying the scripture and showing it, it can be applied.

---

## From the Scripture on Dispelling Demons, Upper Chapter

It is said: The ears desire to be pressed and counted on left and right, also to be uncounted; this is called managing the city walls, inscribing the imperial register. The nose also desires to be pressed and counted on left and right, only to be uncounted; this is called irrigating the Central Mountain, inscribing the imperial tally.

These two passages are from the secret formula of Madam Li of the Platform of Manifestation in Fangzhang, revealed on the night of the twelfth day of the ninth month.

On the Way-day, one often presses three times the small hollow behind the brows with the hands; then with the palms and fingers rub the area below the eyes, with the hand grasping the ears for thirty strokes, rubbing only to be uncounted in time. When finished, quickly press with the hand in reverse on the forehead nine times, beginning from between the brows, then moving upward to the hairline, beside the mouth swallowing saliva, without count or limit. When practised constantly, the eyes will become clear and bright; within a year, one can write by night. This can be done secretly on the philtrum, without speaking of its form.

The small hollow behind the brows is the palace of the Upper Prime’s Six Harmonies, governing the creation of eye brightness, harmonizing and clarifying essence and light, preserving the pearl and penetrating the childlike, perfecting the spirit of the eyes. This is the highest Way of the Perfected sitting and rising; also called the Perfected’s constant dwelling in the inner scripture. The Master of Perfected says: "If you desire to write by night, you should cultivate constant dwelling. The reason the Perfected can observe all directions and illuminate the eight quarters is indeed the clarity of constant dwelling."

The area below the eyes and above the temples is the chamber preserving the infant and returning to the Way; with the hand grasping the ears, it is the method of deep clear reflection. Here the blood of the channels is regulated, wrinkles and spots do not arise; the brightness of the eyes is mysterious and reflected, harmonizing the spirit and filling it. In women approaching old age, this rarely does not begin in the ears and eyes; the signs of aging in the form also begin at the sides of the eyes. Using the hand to press the forehead upward, internally preserving the infant, the double brightness of sun and moon, the Upper Prime rejoices; the nine cycles commence, and the counting ends at completion. This is called the morning Three Primes fixing the brain and strengthening the hair. Both hands are placed on the four sides of the head, smoothing the hair to a knot, only making it numerous. Thus the blood of the head flows without obstruction, and wind and dampness do not congeal. When all is finished, the hands press each of the four canthi of the eyes twice nine times; feeling this brings clear light, this is the Way to test the spirit of the eyes, which when long practised, enables one to see myriad spirits.

The Scripture of Master Shijingzi says: Constantly cover the mouth and nose with the hand, close the eyes, and let subtle qi arise; after a long time the hand will generate liquid; then rub the face and eyes. Regular practice brings fragrance to the body.

---

## From the Jade Scripture of the Three Heavens of the Most High

It is said: Constantly press near the nose at the two nostril wings, closing the qi; when the qi is flowing it stops, then one exhales and begins again. Constant practice enables the eyes to observe through.

The two above passages come from Madam Wei of the Southern Mountain.

---

## From the Scripture of the Three-Five Sequential Movements of the Dan Characters

It is said: Sitting, one often closes the eyes to look inward, retaining sight of the Five Viscera and intestines and stomach; after long practice, one naturally attains clarity and distinctness.

---

## From the Great Scripture of the Primordial Dan Scenery

On the face, one should often rub it with both hands to generate warmth of qi, moving up and down according to the form, making the warmth circulate fully; the face then has radiance, wrinkles and spots do not arise; practised for five years, the complexion is like that of a young maiden. This is called the movement of mountain and river qi, always full and never spent.

---

## From the Dan Scenery Scripture

One should first rub the hands until warm, then wipe the face and eyes; then rub the hair as if combing it; both arms also rub one another, so that the hair does not turn white and the pulse does not rise.

---

## From the Great Scripture of Perfect Essence and Scenery, Massage Chapter

When lying down or rising, always balance qi and sit upright; first interlace the hands, then measure by covering the back of the neck; then gaze upward, making the nape contend with the hands, causing the nape and the hands to contend; do this three or four times until stopped, enabling essence and harmony, and blood to flow; wind qi does not enter. Those who can practise long will not die nor be sick. When finished, bend and move the body, stretch the hands in the four directions, reverse, spread and pull sideways, shaking all the hundred passes, doing each thrice. When lying down or rising, first use a handkerchief or thick silk to wipe the four sides of the nape and behind the ears, making it round and warm, mildly heated. Then rub the hair as if combing with no detachment. After long practice, rub the hands to treat the face and eyes. Frequent practice makes the eyes bright and evil qi does not harm, the form is not defiled, removing filth. When all is finished, swallow saliva thirty times to guide the inner fluid.

The above passage is from the Great Scripture of Perfect Essence and Scenery.

## The Jade Scripture of Reverse Fetal Massage of the Western Queen Mother

The Way of nourishing life regards the ears and eyes as chief. If the vision is confused, the eyes become dark; if the worries are broad, the ears become blocked. These two ailments arise from within the body and become established diseases, not from external visitors or false calamities. This is called the difficulty of hearing the Way; it is not the difficulty of hearing the Way, but the difficulty of practising the Way; it is not the difficulty of practising the Way, but the difficulty of completing the Way. If the ears and eyes are confused and distracted, the hardships are not dispelled, even if one were to tread the Immortal Pavilion and clutch the Dragon Terrace, it would be of no use.

Reverse fetal massage is usually practised on yang days, regarding one day as yang and the next as yin. Each yang day at dawn and at night, upon awakening from sleep, when about to rise at dawn, quickly close the eyes, turn the hands to the direction of one’s own destiny, rub the palms together to generate slight warmth; try pressing the eyes left and right; then press below the ears so that the palms meet at the nape nine times. Visualize each eye containing purple, red, and yellow cloud qi, which each descends into both ears. After a time, softly recite:

"Eye child of the three clouds, true lord of both eyes, bright and focused essence, opening and clearing the imperial spirits, the Great Mysterious Cloud manners, the jade spirit spreading the script, protecting the two gates, opening and penetrating the nine doors, the hundred joints respond and sound, the swirling fluid mud pellet, the body ascends the Jade Palace, listed among the Highest Perfected."

When recitation is finished, swallow saliva thrice. When finished, open the eyes. Make this a regular practice; on yang days sitting upright, one may practise thus; it is not necessary at dawn and dusk. Practised for three years, the ears and eyes become sharp and bright.

To comb the hair, always toward one’s own destiny, at the beginning of combing softly recite:

"The Supreme Emperor scatters the spirit, the Five Elders reverse the spirits, the mud pellet’s mysterious splendour preserves essence and longevity; the left restrains the hidden moon, the right draws the root of the sun, the Six Harmonies are clear and refined, the hundred spirits receive favour."

When finished, practise constantly to keep the head and mind free from pain.

---

## From the Supreme Ultimate Scripture

It is said: To comb the hair, one desires to face the Jade Pool; at the beginning of combing softly recite:

"The mud pellet’s mysterious splendour preserves essence and longevity; on the left is the hidden moon, on the right the root of the sun; the Six Harmonies are clear and refined; the hundred spirits receive favour."

When the recitation is finished, swallow saliva thrice. Constant practice prevents hair loss and promotes growth. Count the combings, choosing many but not causing pain; attendants may also comb to increase the number. Thus blood and fluid do not stagnate, and the roots of the hair remain firm.

The above two passages were instructed by Madam Wei of Anjiuhua.

## On Sitting and Lying Down

One should always have the nostrils facing one’s own destiny; this also applies to eating and drinking. If one cannot face one’s own destiny, facing northeast or northwest is also good. These two directions are the gates and passages of the souls and spirits of Heaven and Earth. Also, when rising and lying down, one should often sway the body left and right several tens of times. When finished, place both hands behind the back, raise the head toward Heaven, and sway the nape left and right twenty times. When finished, sit upright, raise both hands to support Heaven, remain for a long time, then rub both palms to wipe the sides of the eyes, reaching the ears, remaining for a long time, softly reciting:

"Turning hands forward and backward, the Heavenly Emperor’s honoured guests, glancing left and right, great and generous longevity; raising the head and breathing, the Supreme One in mutual harmony, driving away the dragon dam of the moon, the director of fate in accord, drinking and eating the fetal origin, crossing passes Kunlun, returning and overturning the double kneeling, the Perfected comradeship."

When the recitation is finished, then draw in qi and close it. Store the red qi in the navel, as large as a cord; from the navel exhale lying down, inhale through the nose thus thrice. The massage thus ends. This enables all the passes to be unblocked and smooth, granting long life without illness.

## From the Purple Degree Flame Light on Inner Vision of the Center

It is said: One should often close the eyes and lie down, calm the body and subtle qi, making the posture like that of lying down, so that others do not perceive it. Then inwardly view and listen to the four directions, commanding my ears and eyes to focus on ten thousand li away. After long practice, one naturally perceives affairs ten thousand li away, with a clear heart. Then one sees affairs a hundred thousand li away. In men’s ears one always hears the sounds of gold and jade, the strings and bamboo flutes. This is a wondrous method.

The four directions, generally speaking, are the ears; one should first begin with one direction, then by inner law see and hear; initially practising thus, there is indeed no imitation; after long time one truly enters the mystery.

## From the Great Scripture of Perfect Essence, Supreme Inner Chapter, Method for Blocking Evil, Highest Incantation

Whenever passing the path of the eyelids, between the demon temples, or in places where doubts and difficulties arise in the mind, and the heart has slight fears, then when deliberately stepping, one should first turn the tongue inward and swallow saliva thrice. Then with the left hand’s third finger grasp the philtrum beneath the two nostrils, the root within the nasal cavity, pressing thirty-six times without raising the finger or counting. Then press quickly with the hand but do not count. This root within the nose is called the Mountain Source. The Mountain Source is also named the Ghost Well, the Spirit Pool, the Evil Root, and the Soul Platform. When grasping is finished, knock the teeth seven times in succession, then advance the palm to cover the nose and look toward the eyes, softly reciting:

"Vermilion Bird ascends to Heaven, divine power extends within, Mountain Source fills in all four directions, Ghost Well flees, Spirit Pool exhales qi, Evil Root lies concealed, Soul Platform shines in four directions, Jade Chamber resounds, Jade Truth towering high, seated guarding the Bright Hall, hand shining with purple mist, head erect with morning light; chanting the Scripture of the Cave, thirty-nine chapters, including repelling demons of dragon and tiger, intercepting soldiers and breaking cauldrons, fierce hunting of wild oxen, carrying knives and swallowing jewels, lifting mountains and hurling towards Heaven, divine sparrow and poisonous dragon, six leaders spitting fire, devouring the king of ghosts, thunder pig and father of lightning, seizing stars and flowing horizontally, owl pecks at swift horses, moving against the wind, great birds sweep and capture, all are near me, spitting fire ten thousand zhang to remove misfortune, myriad spirits open the Way, sealing the mountain villages, thousand gods and hundred spirits, all bowing their heads, marshals holding lamps, burning incense for me, wherever I go all spirits welcome me."

When finished, knock the teeth three times in succession, then open the eyes, slowly withdraw the left hand. Pressing the Mountain Source closes the gate of the Ghost Well; pressing the Spirit Pool scatters the Evil Root; pressing the Soul Platform guards the Jade Truth’s gate. Thus inspiring and rousing the spiritual root, the heavenly beasts come to protect; myriad spirits tremble and prostrate; none dare harm my qi. This is the natural principle causing sudden and effective results.

The Mountain Source beneath the nose is the conduit of the whole body, the true and evil communication office; the false is the source of evil qi, the true is the means to suppress ten thousand evils, in my management and control. Therefore it reveals omens of fortune and misfortune. Within the Bright Hall is also the pattern of the body, the form office of life and death, the original chamber of the seven souls, the dwelling place of the three spirits. Preserving its spirit enables one to glimpse the inner vision; abandoning the Way leads to decay and rot. Therefore, I govern it, carefully following hygiene, so that no regrets or faults arise.

The above four passages are from the highest chapter of the Great Scripture of Perfect Essence.

## From the Great Spirit Perfected

It is said: The place of origin of wind illness is in the dampness of graves and mounds, where the three springs become blocked and stagnant; therefore the earth official is activated by water qi, often producing wind bi syndrome. When wind bi is severe, the whole body cannot be supported; when light, half the body or limbs may be lost. If one often dreams of the northeast or northwest, and presses the old residence accordingly, or sees the spiritual bed place, this indicates one is about to connect with grave qi. The northeast of the grave is the place of severed fate; the northwest is the place of nine calamities; these are all inauspicious places of grave litigation. If one dreams of the dead in these places, it confirms the omen. If one often has such dreams, then upon waking one should face upwards, tap the teeth thrice, and recite:

"Supreme Origin, Highest Mystery, Purple Heaven of the Nine Capitals, regulating souls and protecting life, High Plain Perfected, I receive the highest method, instructed by the Great Mystery, for long life and lasting vision, the body flies and becomes immortal, graves and tombs are eternally peaceful, ghost litigation is sealed away, souls and spirits harmonize and rejoice, evil qi does not smoke, wandering demons, ghosts and goblins dare not harm my spirit; the Northern Emperor restrains and captures them, collecting qi into the abyss, receiving the tally of the Supreme Emperor, inscribed in the imperial register."

Such one should recite twice, then knock the teeth thrice more, and they will no longer dream of graves or dead family. This is the secret incantation of the Northern Emperor, which those with good intentions may all practise. If one often has nightmares and ill omens, one may use this method; thus ghost qi will be extinguished, evil ghosts dispersed.

---

## On the Arms Being Unsupported

If the arms cannot be lifted, it is caused by wind poison qi in the channels, attached to the bones causing stagnation and bi syndrome; it is best to apply acupuncture, which will cure. Also, it is suitable to practise the Northern Emperor’s winding incantation; if done a hundred times, the illness will immediately vanish. First use one hand to slowly massage the painful place; after long practice, lie down and look inward, swallow saliva thrice, knock teeth thrice, and with a steady heart softly recite:

"The Most High Four Mysteries, Five Glories and Six Courts, Three Souls and Seven Spirits, Heavenly Pass and Earth Essence, Spirit Mansion flourishing and guarding, Heavenly Fetus at the Upper Bright, Four Limbs and Hundred Spirits, Nine Joints and Ten Thousand Spirits, receiving the tally of Jade Morning, carved into the Jade City; Jade Maiden attends the body, Jade Child guards life, eternally matching the two luminaries, flying immortals ascend to clarity; always with sun and moon, years together received, transcending to ascend immortality, attaining perfect peace; flowing wind dispels sickness, directing ghosts and five dragons, demons and tomb qi, yin qi diverges, impeding the four limbs, harming my flourishing and decline; the Most High Heavenly Spirit, dragons and tigers shine with power, cutting ghosts and ill omens, wind evil is then dispelled, investigating concealed litigation, hiding a hundred poisons and errors, restoring my normal state, sun and moon shine together, investigating violations, the Northern Ghost collects and destroys, as if severing light above, power bestowed on the chief."

---

## From the Highest Scripture of the Great Mysterious Tinging Water Blossom, Massage Method

It is said: When qi is raw and active, after swallowing saliva twenty-seven times, press the painful place, and recite to the lord:

"Left Mystery, Right Mystery, Three Spirits unite with Truth; Left Yellow, Right Yellow, Six Glories respond; wind qi causes evil sickness, hiding and lurking in the four directions; jade liquid flows and moistens, above and below circulate and communicate; internally dispatching water and fire, externally dispelling inauspiciousness, long life and divine immortality, the body always at rest and strong."

When finished, swallow saliva twenty-seven times. Constant practice thus prevents illness. Also, urgently press the painful place thirty-one times.

The above passage was given on the twenty-second day of the tenth month by Madam Wang Youying of the Canglang Yunlin Palace.

---

## From the Scripture on Dispelling Demons, Upper Spirit Preface

It is said: If the body is unsettled, one should turn the tongue inward and block the throat, rinse the mouth and swallow saliva without number; after a moment, the unsettled illness will be removed. At the time, the body will also feel broad and soft.

The above passage is from the Preface to the Scripture on Dispelling Demons, Upper Spirit.

---

## On Dreams and Nightmares

If dreams are unreal, the soul disturbed by evil qi, as if inspecting the mind, seeking to spy upon my spirit’s hiding place. Whenever encountering evil dreams, one should face north and invoke the Most High Great Way Lord, fully describing their form; after four or five counts, the dream will vanish.

From the Green Youth’s Secret Formula.

---

## On Frequent Evil Dreams

Night and day encountering evil dreams is not good; upon waking one should immediately turn the pillow, change it again, and recite:

"Great Harmony Jade Maiden, attending true spirit to guard the soul; Six Palaces Golden Children come to guard the gates of health, transforming evil to good, ascending the Three Primes, enabling me to live long, riding light and driving clouds."

When finished, swallow saliva nine times, knock the teeth seven times and lie down. After four or five repetitions, the evil will cease and vanish. This incantation also reverses evil dreams and brings good fortune.

The above was given on the night of the thirteenth day of the eleventh month by Madam Youying.

## On the Mysterious Image and Spirit Pivot

It is said: Penetrating gaze to the place of destination, the heart clear and empty, the spirit tastes the mark, inhaling and exhaling with great harmony, the body qi vast and desolate. Then the jade bell begins to sound, myriad sounds summon the dark. Qi is the craftsman of spirit and brightness, the source of purity and turbidity, residing in mystery it is heaven’s clarity, residing in man it is the body’s existence. Life neither diminishes nor grows too much, for it follows regulation and control. To master the six qi, one should always face dawn and the hours of Yin and Chou, relying on heavenly time to begin creation, always facing the directions at those times. The great rosy clouds part the light, the cinnabar sun gives birth to light, the spirit brightness opens the morning, the vermilion essence begins its brightness. First the sun is stored like a chicken’s egg within the mud pellet. Then it exhales one qi, storing qi as black in colour, called corpse qi. Next it exhales two qi, storing qi as white in colour, called old qi. Next it exhales three qi, storing qi as blue in colour, called death qi. Pondering on the colour, it exhales qi for a long time. Altogether it exhales three colours, six qi in total. Then slowly it inhales, drawing in four times yellow qi, storing qi coming from the mud pellet’s sun, four times done, then swallowing saliva thrice, completing three times. Then it again stores within the mud pellet, goes down and exits from the ears, reaching before the mouth, about nine cun from the face, looking toward the eyes as if seeing them. Then again rides the sun to inhale, drawing in seven times red qi; after seven times, again swallow saliva thrice and stop. Then arise and sit, move and sway the four limbs, bow and stretch, causing the channels and pulses to flow smoothly; all is complete. The stored saliva is always made blue in colour. At night one may also store the moon in the mud pellet, as in storing the sun. When storing the moon, one uses the moon’s first day and midnight until the fifteenth day to reside. From the sixteenth to the thirtieth day, the moon qi declines and fades; the heavenly fetus shrinks and cannot be stored at night. This method is most wonderful; those who can practise it become immortals, thus exhaling and inhaling the fetal origin, rinsing and inhaling the true brightness. At times one calls and summons the five swallowings, to attain the natural; the soul returns and leaves the abode; the spirit returns to the mud pellet, thus achieving long life. How is this like gathering the yin qi of the secluded valley, seeking the spirit of the swift horse, crossing the sea to seek salvation, driving a feathered chariot on a fiery mountain? Should one not be cautious, should one not be cautious?

The above is the preface to the Western Queen Mother’s secret formula.

## On the Night of the Fourth Day of the Second Month of the Year Yichou, Third Year of Xingning

The Director of Fate, Lord of the East, descended, accompanied by seven attendants entering the house. One held a floral banner, named the Banner of Tenfold Spiritual Severance; one bore a ringed seal pouch; three bore white ivory boxes containing what seemed to be books; one held a golden fire bell. All attendants were clad in vermilion robes. The form of the Director of Fate was much less than the second brother, wearing a blue embroidered skirt, a purple fur cape, a lotus crown; the second brother also came to attend, standing by. The seat of command was seated. Speech lasted a long time. On the night of the sixth day of the seventh month, the Director of Fate again descended and delivered a message, saying: "If one must model the mystery, hold the image pure and rare, then remove the wild weeds, fold wings and fly high, sensing the flavour and ascending the covenant, the abyss is calm and the mountain stands firm, the jade script is clear and desolate, enjoying the birth of precious spirits, abandoning vulgar attachments, tuning and plucking the clear and pure, clarifying the brightness in the void, the Five Ways illumine, colours transcend the waves of transformation, aspiring to blend with the pale, emptiness like the dark roads, no seeing or hearing; then you will approach the wondrous perfected, re-arising the mysterious awakening, bright virtue within and round, spirit poised without. In the end you will harness the cloud chariot to ascend to the heavens, inscribed with the Director of Fate’s cinnabar tally." If the mind scatters ten thousand thoughts and life is unstable, qi follows the dust waves, the heart is not truly settled, this only troubles body and spirit in the mountain forest; this is truly mistaken in the later learning. Its Way is subtle and easy to seek, yet difficult and hard to obtain.

## On the Night of the Fifth Day of the Month at Midnight

Store the sun emblem in the heart; the sun enters by the mouth. It shines within the single heart, sharing light with the sun, joining and meeting; one should feel the heart warmth, the rosy brilliance reflected. After a long time, softly recite: "Great Light nurtures essence, internally refining the cinnabar heart, light and radiance reflect and join, the true spirit comes to the body." Then swallow saliva nine times. On the fifteenth, twenty-fifth, and twenty-ninth days, repeat as above. This enables one to open and hear clearly, all passes are resolved, the face bears jade light, the body has golden fluid. Practised for five years, the Supreme One sends a protective chariot to welcome one, ascending to the Supreme Sky. Practice as often as desired; this need not be done on all these days.

The above passage is from the Scripture on Dispelling Demons, Southern Mountain Red Lord’s inner method.

---

## Additional Instructions

At meals, do not speak of death or the dead, nor expose food, lest evil qi come.

---

## On Frequent Baths

It is essential to bathe exactly on the Jiazi day; if not, then on some month and day at dawn, so that the spirit can communicate. Bathing is not concerned with frequency but with one’s capacity. This cleanses and refines the corpse’s stench, allowing true qi to enter.

The above was instructed by Madam Wei of Xuanlóng Yu Palace.

---

## From the Supreme Scripture of Nine Transformations and Ten Changes, New Easy Scripture

It is said: When treading filth and uncleanness, and other places not flourishing, one should first bathe, to dissolve the form and remove it. The method uses ten liang of bamboo leaves, four liang of peeled white peach skin, boiled in one hu and two dou of clear water in a cauldron; before boiling, cool to warm, then bathe in it; all filth is removed. After cleansing filth, it also dispels dampness, bi syndrome, sores and itching. Bamboo is hollow and white within; peach is repellent to evil and reduces filth; these two substances are used to consume the turbid dregs within the form. When Heaven and Man’s lower streams reverse, this water is always used to cleanse. Compared to earthly talismanic waters for bathing and mouth rinsing, all external methods cannot compete with this formula. If bathing is more frequent, it is better, but do not use this water for the entire bath. The refined corpse’s essence liquid is best used for bathing; this is a true secret mystery.

The above was instructed by Madam Wang of the Xuanlǒng Yu Palace.

---

## At Dawn, Facing the Lord, Writing in Vermilion and Bowing to Take

Softly recite:

"The Five Spirits open the heart, thoroughly hearing the utmost sound, the Three Souls gather essence, fully guarding the cinnabar heart, so that I do not forget, the Five Viscera seek afar."

First bow, after bowing softly recite; after reciting, take the talisman and swallow saliva five times, knock the teeth five times, do not let others see. If one does not use the dawn day, then use the first, fifteenth, and twenty-seventh days of the month, taking three doses a month; in a year the effect is certain. This is a secret talisman.

## From the Secret Formula of the Taoist Master of the Great Void

It is said: On the days of the Five Arrivals, the days of spring Yimao, summer Bingwu, autumn Gengshen, and winter Renzi, when lying in darkness, first grind cinnabar, realgar, and orpiment three parts each, finely grind into powder, wrap in cotton to the size of a date. When lying down, plug both ears with this; this dissolves the three corpses and refines the seven souls in a most secret and wondrous way. Let no one know. Next day, at midday, bathe in east-flowing water; after bathing, tidy the bed and bedding, change clothes, wash the old ones, and bathe again. When all is complete, sweep and sprinkle under the bed, making the dwelling room clean; arrange the pillow and lie down, close the qi above, grasp firmly for a long time, and softly recite:

"Heaven’s Way is constant, change renews the old to the new, the Supreme Emperor’s auspicious day, bathing for truth, the three qi dissolve the corpses, cinnabar and orpiment calm the souls, precious refining of the seven souls, intimately with me."

When recitation is finished, this Way is the highest method to dissolve and refine corpse filth, the essential secret to renewing and changing the form. Each season chooses one day to practise.

The Master of the Great Void says: My former teacher taught that on the days of the Five Arrivals, when the sun rises about three or four zhang, stand facing the sun, store the three souls and spirits, enter with the sun’s light into the heart; keep calm and balanced within for a long time, hold the breath three breaths, swallow saliva thrice, and softly recite:

"The sun scatters its rays, hanging light purple-blue, coming into my body, illuminating my five forms, dispelling ghost tests, making the heart calm and balanced, thoroughly penetrating the nine qi, externally communicating with the fetal life, flying immortal to clarity, the jade tally established."

When the incantation is finished, wipe the eyes twenty-seven times, knock the teeth twenty-seven times. All is complete. This method enables the three souls to condense and shine, the cinnabar heart to be upright, ten thousand evils to be concealed and subdued, and the heart test to fail; this is the essential true Way. If a child often practises it on the days of the Five Arrivals, facing the sun, it induces sneezing; if sneezing does not come, use a soft object facing the sun to guide the nose; this too causes sneezing. Sneezing then recites:

"Heaven’s light comes in, six fetuses thoroughly connected, three souls guard the spirit, seven spirits do not perish, receiving the sun’s ringing sneeze, sharing form with the sun, flying immortals in jade clarity, taking rank as true lord."

When finished, wipe the eyes twenty-seven times. This is the essence within connecting with the sun’s light; the three souls illuminate within, opening the heart, releasing the spirit; the myriad spirits flow through the inner mansion. If it is not the day of the Five Arrivals, one need not do this.

On the days of the Five Arrivals, face north and bow five times; steady the heart and call the names of the Highest True Sovereigns and their consorts thrice; after finishing, knock the teeth five times, remove the head covering and kneel long; respectfully open to the Five Stars, Sun and Moon, the Supreme Emperor and Lord of the Way, the Thirty-Two Heavenly Emperors, Jade Clarity of the Most High, Supreme Clarity, Supreme Emperor, Great Way Holy Lords; then confess all the faults and crimes of seven ancestors, parents below, and one’s own body, all offences from past lives, begging for release; the Three Officials report to the Heavenly Emperor, causing the charges to be dismissed, the black registers to be erased; begging to be granted the true Five Stars; all run to the splendid morning, ascending to Supreme Clarity, crossing and passing the Jade Gate.

The sixth day of the first month at midday, the first day of the second month at evening, the seventh day of the third month at midnight, the ninth day of the fourth month at mealtime, the fifteenth day of the fifth month at midnight, the third day of the sixth month at midday, the seventh day of the seventh month at midnight, the fourth day of the eighth month at midday, the second day of the ninth month at dawn, the first day of the tenth month at dawn, the sixth day of the eleventh month at midnight, the second day of the twelfth month at midnight.

The above are recorded as the auspicious days of the Five Arrivals.

## On the Method of Taking Sun and Moon Essence

On the first day of the moon, at dawn, when the sun rises about two zhang high, look toward the sun, then grasp firmly, take three steps eastward by Yubo, inhaling the sun’s essence twice seven times, swallowing fourteen times. This may be given to two persons entering a feverish household; other illnesses cannot attach; those who take it become light and long-lived.

On the third day of the moon, the moon rises above Geng; grasp firmly with both hands, walk southwest and face the moon; take three steps by Yubo, remotely drink the moon’s essence twice seven times, swallow fourteen times; throughout the year there will be no illness. This also may be given to the dying. The sun and moon illuminate the filth. These two passages, eating sun and drinking moon essence, both eliminate ten thousand diseases.
