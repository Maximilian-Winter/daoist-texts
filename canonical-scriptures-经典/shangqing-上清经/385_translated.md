# Decisions for the Practice of the Purple Writ

From Dunhuang manuscripts S.4314, S.6193, and P.2751, originally three parts of one scroll. After combination, the beginning of the scroll is lost and untitled; the end bears the title "Decisions for the Practice of the Purple Writ." The first half of the manuscript contains the "Decisions for the Practice of the Purple Writ," and the latter half contains the "Decisions for the Practice of the Nine Truths and Eight Ways." The main text in large characters probably dates to the Eastern Jin, with the smaller annotations possibly composed by Gu Huan or Tao Hongjing of the Southern Dynasties. The text here is based upon the facsimile in Daiyuan Ren’er’s *Catalogue of Dunhuang Daoist Scriptures*.

### [On the Essential Days: 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, 14th, 16th, 18th, 20th, 22nd, 24th of the lunar month]

Eleven days within a month suffice to complete the attainment of immortality. On the evening of these days, the yin essence flies and unites, the Three Vitalities overflow and fill, the moon’s waters congeal into blossoms, and the Yellow Deity descends to receive it. For practice of eighteen years, one in the Upper Purity should refine the soul and transform the corporeal spirit, reflecting the jade radiance, mounting the mysterious reins of light, and flying through the great void. These days are all even-numbered days; as for the 26th and 28th, the month’s number has returned to the empty cycle; the 30th day varies between full and small months, and is therefore not taken. The 12th day is also not used, perhaps because the essence later suffers deficiency there; nor should all be taken without discrimination.

### Moon Talisman

The Purple Microcosm wears the Moon Essence, the Supreme Mysterious Yin Talisman. The previous method of wearing the moon was also conferred by the Supreme Subtle, but this talisman says Purple Microcosm, which is that mentioned among the invocations of the priests. [Text missing here.] Now the invoker’s talisman is called the Purple Micro Yellow Book, and the talisman for wearing the moon invokes the Flying Immortal Purple Micro; these resemble the uses of sun and moon, yin and yang, but differ in particulars.

At the right, on the new moon night at midnight, on yellow paper with blue characters, facing east, one wears the talisman, first to announce to the moon’s soul. At this time one should first wear the Opening and Illuminating Spirit Talisman. The sun is vermilion and the moon yellow, their proper colours. On that night, both talismans are worn—since on the same evening, first the sun talisman is worn and then the moon talisman; [text missing]. At midnight of the new moon, the sun and moon are both in the east, the moon following the sun on its path, hence the eastward facing when wearing the talisman. When wearing the moon talisman, close the breath; hold the talisman in the right hand; mentally invoke, saying: The image of the moon’s yin, therefore using the right hand, with regulation according to previous methods. The Purple Micro Yellow Book is named the Supreme Mysterious, to summon the moon’s floral waters, nourish the corporeal spirit and harmonize the soul; the formula is strict, emanating from the mysterious gate, hiding the moon of heaven, the five spirit ladies, flying lights on nine paths, illuminating the Bright Mud Pill with five tones. When the invocation completes, then wear the talisman. Still using the right hand, roll it and swallow it; this may be done ten times, holding the talisman in the throat, so that it ascends to the Mud Pill within. This knows that the sun is in the heart and the moon in the Mud Pill, the meaning of wearing the talisman. Both talismans say one must first announce to the souls of sun and moon; meaning that when one must wear sun and moon talismans the next day, one first causes one’s vital energy to ascend and communicate, summoning the two souls and causing them to be firmly arrayed and receive below. Since the moon’s phases change, the command is renewed at each new moon.

### Binding Souls

The Supreme Subtle Spirit Book of the Purple Writ records the method to bind the Three Souls: the 3rd, 13th, and 23rd evenings of the month. Because there are three souls, the threes of the month are used. The gods and ghosts are still yin; all are by evening. Even if [text missing], it must be done lying down, preferably at early evening, so that one can remain sleepless all night, which is best. If dwelling in the mountains without business, one may do this every evening, not limited to these three days. At such times, the three souls are unsettled, the swift spirits roam, the embryonic light projects forms, the hidden essences disturb and summon. The three lords of the swift spirit, embryonic light, and hidden essence are the names of the three spirits of the soul. The three souls originally dwell in the heart; the great number is three, hence three gods; this corresponds also to the position of Zhen (震), the meaning of left three and right seven.

At evening all abandon their bodies to roam, rushing away from their dwelling, sometimes seen and restrained by other souls or external ghosts; sometimes captured by demons; sometimes unable to return, departing from their forms and casting away substance; sometimes attacked by external souls, the two vitalities contend and fight, all agitated and like infants, causing distraction and shape-shifting, coming and going without form, the heart sorrowful and the mind depressed. Daoists all should bind and restrain them, so they do not wander. The soul is said to be bound, the corporeal spirit to be restrained, which is good in principle. Yet the invocation of the flying step says bind the corporeal spirit and restrict the soul; the five star invocation is the same. It is not clear why the perfect man’s methods differ. Wherever such occurs, I, having attained the Way, shall petition above and correct them. The soul is itself a good spirit; its chief trouble is abandoning the body and wandering elsewhere, colliding with demons and spirits, which causes harm and confusion, and is not in accord with Huang-Lao, nor does it serve the Great Lord, thus causing inner and outer to transgress goodness.

Nowadays some have their essence and spirits distracted and confused; if something is lost, or the complexion grows dark and sullen, or habits become confused and bewildered, these are all due to the soul’s departure and failure to return, which may last for ten days before it returns. If it does not return, the body falls ill, and [text missing].

The method of binding and restraint is to lie down facing upwards, the pillow beneath the feet, hands crossed over the heart, the corporeal spirit restrained by removing the pillow; this removal is not total but lowered about two inches to level the body. At first lying down, first maintain the inner chamber affairs, then the three palaces and great lords, then remove the pillow beneath the feet; cover the hands, crossed one over the other, to cover the heart, left hand uppermost. Close the eyes, close the boundary for three breaths, tap the teeth three times, then close the breath and continue the tapping. The three taps correspond to the three souls’ intent. Maintain a red-black like a chicken’s egg from within, rising from the eyes, passing outwards; the red light turns large and envelops the body, flowing downward through the body and up to the top of the head. The soul is in the heart but is the liver spirit, so the heart must not open the eyes to extend it. Maintain this red vitality as large as a chicken’s egg, flickering and rising from the heart through the internal orifices to the left eye, then outwardly growing larger, encompassing the body on both sides as a quilt or cloak, covering the head, blending closely with the body but without wrapping around the back beneath. It changes into fire, thereby burning the body all around, making the whole body transparent and burning like glowing charcoal. When all is completed, one should feel a slight warmth in the body; the maintained red softness suddenly all changes into fire, uniting to burn the body; at first a blazing flame, soon all turns to charcoal, the bones and viscera all brightly glowing; the three souls are also red, though at this time the self is still alive but the body is red only. At first imagine the heat, then truly sense it. Then tap the teeth three times again, finish, call the names of the three souls, maintaining the swift spirit at the mysterious gate serving the Great Lord, guarding the seven corporeal spirits; embryonic light in the inner chamber facing Huang-Lao, serving the infant, guarding the Mud Pill; hidden essence in the heart receiving regulation and control; then call the names. At calling, each should be called where they are maintained. The three gods swift spirit, embryonic light, and hidden essence immediately halt; then softly invoke: Supreme Subtle Mysterious Palace, central yellow at the beginning of the azure, internally refining the three souls, embryonic light peaceful and quiet, divine treasure jade chamber, born with me, do not move rashly. The witness is most spiritual. If wishing to fly and travel, only may one go to the Supreme Ultimate of Upper Purity; if hungry or thirsty, only may one drink the returning waters of the jade essence, sixty-four words. All is complete. Then suddenly forget the body for a long while, then again recall remaining thoughts. The souls transform and roam; the corporeal spirits remain, saying hungry and thirsty, listening and moving. The returning waters and moon yellows are all transformations of the Lang Kai elixir, which souls or corporeal spirits cannot possess, thus sworn by this.

### Restraining the Corporeal Spirit

The Supreme Subtle Spirit Book of the Purple Writ records the method to restrain the Seven Corporeal Spirits: the new moon, full moon, and new moon evenings. These three days are especially important; they are the days when ghosts roam and wander unchecked. The full moon is reckoned by the calendar, sometimes on the 15th, sometimes the 16th. The corporeal spirits are fierce and agitated, hence it is fitting to restrain them constantly, even nightly. At such times, the seven corporeal spirits wander and run about uncleanly, sometimes mixing with blood and food, going to ghosts and demons; sometimes associating with corpses; sometimes seducing infants, gathering in plots to attack homes; sometimes accusing people’s sins before the Three Officials and the River Lord; sometimes transforming into M®, causing revulsion; sometimes causing ghosts to enter the body, calling the qi substance. All residual diseases arise from the corporeal spirits; joy in death is their nature; desire for human ruin is their illness. They constantly desire to cause death, gaining permission to roam the heavens and earth, wandering the tombs, enjoying village sacrifices, injuring offspring. Thus they cause scattered and confused thoughts, birth and death confusions; sometimes mixing impurely, sometimes drinking and eating together; wandering and treading unfit places; startling and frightening with restraints; with such matters, false changes are manifold, causing spirit and mind to depart and err, thoughts to be troubled and fearful, calamities and diseases to arise suddenly—these are all harms caused by corporeal spirits, hence must be strictly checked. Daoists must restrain and urge them, forbidding reckless movement. To train and transform them means never to have nine returns. To govern and correct them means to harmonize and soften to peace. To gather and awe means the heavenly hunt guards the gate. The first corporeal spirit is named Shi Gou, the second Fu Shi, the third Que Yin, the fourth Tun Zei, the fifth Fei Du, the sixth Chu Hui, the seventh Chou Fei. These are the seven yin names of the corporeal spirits, the foul ghosts within the body. These [text missing] are all evil eyes. The number seven corresponds to the corporeal spirits usually residing in the lungs. The lungs are the metal god, hence able to cut qi. Though the soul always wishes to live, it is the wood god, so it is often suppressed by the corporeal spirits, dwelling in the heart, with slight fire to restrain it. Thus people who do evil always abound. If [text missing], then abiding by the Three Palaces and Eight Scenes, these seven ghosts naturally subside.

The method of restraining and checking is to lie correctly, remove the pillow beneath the feet, cover the ears with the palms, fingers touching, crossed behind the neck; this is done after first cultivation is complete, then lie correctly, remove the pillow, cross the hands and place the palms over the ears, fingertips meeting below the brain gate. The pillow beneath the feet is covered, facing the mat, still following the turtle and snake stepping method. Close the breath seven times, tap the teeth seven times; this is equivalent to closing the breath seven times. Previously it was not said to close the eyes, because one should maintain the Azure Dragon in the eyes later, but should also observe carefully. Maintain a white softness at the tip of the nose like a small bean, gradually growing, crowning the ninefold body, descending to the feet, rising to the head. This corresponds also to maintaining the white qi portion, which issues from the feet, passes the throat, exits the right nostril, bright and shining, growing layer by layer, beginning from the outside, circling the body ninefold, passing the back ninefold; counted to the nose tip is completed. The soul is called enveloping the body, so it must cover above; this is called crowning the body, hence surrounding all around. Now using the white softness in the lungs that emerges from the nostril is a small point of the original palace’s household affairs, without room to issue from both nasal passages; the five spirits maintain pure brightness issuing from the right passage, thus it may serve as the standard. And the red light issuing from the eye should not suddenly open both eyes, so it is made from the left eye. Such matters are not fully mentioned in the scripture, and should be guided by intention, not rashly performed.

When complete, the white heat suddenly changes again into the heavenly hunt, placing two Azure Dragons in the two eyes; the body already is within the ninefold; the qi transformation should first arise internally, gathering and collecting the two beams toward the eyes, beginning on the left, each becoming an Azure Dragon, their bodies within the pupils, emerging from the head toward the face, each about nine cun long. Two White Tigers are in the two nostrils, facing outward; next two black spots gather at the nostrils, also beginning with the left, each becoming a White Tiger, their bodies inside the nostrils, heads turning outward, each about seven cun long. Though the tiger and dragon bodies are small and compact, their forms are lifelike, with teeth and claws, wielding scaled horns, making them formidable. The Vermilion Bird is above the heart, facing [text missing]; next an addition gathers above the heart, turning into the Vermilion Bird, standing upright upon the heart, wings covering the sides, beak reaching to the [text missing], even to the lips and teeth, imagining its form from head to tail three feet long. The Cang Turtle is beneath the left foot, the Ling She beneath the right foot; next two spots without gathering beneath the two feet, the left becomes the Cang Turtle, five cun in diameter; the right becomes the Ling She, also turtle-colored, five feet long, both covering the mat, the Ling She coiled, body and tail entwined with the turtle, stretching the head to [text missing], feet pressing each other’s backs, peaceful and at ease. These four spiritual shapes accord with what people nowadays paint, only the turtle and snake differ slightly, not entwined exactly like the Black Tortoise.

Within the ears are jade maidens, wearing dark brocade clothes, at the ear gates, each holding a flame in both hands. Outside the two blacks also extend to the palms, stimulating the ear gates; again beginning on the left, each turns into a jade maiden, five cun long, wearing blue brocade robes, hair arranged in floating clouds, each hand holding a flame, together four fires. Within my palm, at the ear gate, facing forward seated. These are the ear gods, the proud maidens, and cloud attendants. Thus all white and black are complete, again maintaining the seven hunts and two maidens, all made present. After a long while, all complete, again swallow saliva seven times, tap teeth seven times, call the names of the seven corporeal spirits; tapping and swallowing each seven times completes the seven corporeal spirits. Yet there is still swallowing of saliva, because the corporeal spirit delights in qi, thus harmonizing it. Though it says call rather than maintain, meaning the seven corporeal spirits are all in one place, unlike the three souls dispersed, so one should maintain. Likewise one should imagine their seven forms accompanying, standing on the right side of the life gate in the spleen, restrained by the first soul, swift spirit, not allowed to move. Then call: Shi Gou, Fu Shi, Que Yin, Tun Zei, Fei Du, Chu Hui, Chou Fei. Each name is called thrice. These spirits and corporeal spirits are the very gods and ghosts of my body; controlling them is to hold their Way, making summoning easy without repeated calling.

When finished, softly invoke: Pure qi nine returns restrain evil corporeal spirits; heavenly hunt guards the gate; proud maidens hold the pass; train the corporeal spirits, harmonize and soften, be at peace with me; no rash movement; observe the source of form; if hungry or thirsty, listen and drink the moon yellow and sun elixir, two characters. All complete. Then suddenly forget the body for a long while, then again recall remaining thoughts. Then the seven corporeal spirits close inwardly and guard under restraint. If constantly practiced, the corporeal spirits’ filth dissipates downward, returning to good harmony with form, united with the three palaces and with the primal spirit. This is called constant practice, meaning no loss at new, full, or waning moons, doing it every evening is even better. When the corporeal spirits are reduced and dissipated, the filth is transformed to good, the spirits harmonize with the three palaces and receive regulation, then no longer desire human death.

### The Three Primal Palace Gods

In the life gate there is the Mysterious Gate Great Lord and the gods of the three souls, summing seven gods, all within the form; they wish to cause long life, benevolent and greatly auspicious lords. These seven gods, whether Daoists or layfolk, worthies or fools, are always present; if their spirits are clear, pure, and bright, then talents flourish; if base, turbid, and dark, then nature and conduct are coarse and clumsy. All residing in the body without disease; if wandering and departing, illness follows; when each declines and fades, the great gods depart and death ensues. The seven corporeal spirits also are born with the body but are enemies and assailants, hence must be restrained. Daoists know how to seek the method of immortality but not the method to restrain corporeal spirits, and thus cannot avoid vain toil. Though soul and corporeal spirit both are born of father and mother, the corporeal spirit receives added yin and filth, the yin filth and defilement constantly conspire with corpses and worms, always wishing to trap man in error. Good and evil principles correspond; life qi matters are harmonious, this is the natural law. Among the scriptures, such as the Three Pursuits and Seven Primal, there are wondrous and supreme matters, but none explain the names of soul and corporeal spirits, only now are they known. These two gods always dwell within the body; ordinary men all know they exist, sorcerers and exorcists also somewhat see their forms. As for names, they are truly secret in ancient and modern times, no one can transmit them; if anyone sees, they keep them deeply secret. Among the human canonical items are five elements secret talismans calling souls and summoning corporeal spirits in sequence, saying wear the five elements to call souls, so such separately must have talismans also. Since the scripture is not practiced, one should begin with this method, but consider one thing further: Now that the souls and corporeal spirits issue from the self, their attire and form must surely correspond to their original palace’s colours and images; as to length, breadth, and size, all according to their use and suitability; this must be first clarified. The sorcerers’ visions show only one person, which may not be true.

### The Three-One

The location of the three primal palaces: The Upper Primal Palace is in the Mud Pill, its god the infant, character Xian, also called Emperor Minister; the Middle Primal Palace is at the centre of the Red Chamber, its god the Perfect Man, character Zi Dan, also called Radiant Firmness; the Lower Primal Dan Field Palace is three cun below the navel, its god an infant, character Yang Zi, also called Valley Mystery. These are the three-one gods. The location of these three palaces accords with that prescribed in the Three-One Scripture, though names differ and unite in this method of supreme subtlety, mingling into one body, so no longer requiring opposite seating and mutual support, nor hierarchical positions. Since seven gods are named, each must be double. The so-called first piece of the Imperial True Scripture of the Golden Gate Emperor Lord likely is this chapter. When restraining and controlling souls and corporeal spirits, first call their yin names, maintaining the three gods, all jade-coloured and golden-bright, with infantile appearance, the upper two palaces clothed in red, caps of scarlet lotus, the lower palace clothed in yellow, heads like new-born infants. The three soul qualities are like jade, shining like gold; their attire is like that of the Three-One Scripture, but omitted here is imagining their holding of objects. When attire and form are complete, mentally call: The Upper Primal Mud Pill Palace Red Infant, character Xian, also called Emperor Minister; then maintain the Middle and Lower Primal likewise. When complete, maintain the Mysterious Gate finally, then bind and restrain. When practicing the Way to wear qi, also call their names. Whenever cultivating and maintaining, at the beginning of breath control, do likewise. If practicing the method of returning essence, first call these methods, then gain to maintain and cultivate the great lord’s affairs.

### The Great Lord

The life gate corresponds to the navel. From the navel downward three cun is all called the life gate, like the head is all called the Mud Pill. But three cun inward is specifically one dwelling beneath the life gate. The Mysterious Gate is the passage of the nascent foetal intestine. All men are connected to the foetus as to the umbilical cord; after birth it naturally falls away, becoming the root of the primal black. Inside is the birth palace, in which dwells the great lord named Peach Child, character He Yan, clad in scarlet, wearing a purple headdress and cap, sitting facing the life gate. This Mysterious Gate birth palace is precisely one cun within the navel, the Bright Hall Palace. It is one cun square, with three old lords dwelling therein, the great lord on the left. Now maintaining it is small and near the left side, like a jade infant, dressed in scarlet, wearing a purple lotus cap, holding in the right hand the imperial elephant talisman, sitting outward facing, opposite the life gate hence said to sit at the life gate. Juanzi says: The Bright Hall three old lords palace, the lungs with the spleen’s hall, in morning goes from lungs to spleen, [text missing]. Both left and right are invited. This is on the outer spleen [text missing]. The three soul gods attend by the side. Though these three soul gods always attend the great lord, here each is separated. Formerly it was thought the inner chamber had a second soul; if combined, there is no room, so it returns, here only the second swift spirit remains. Yet the three souls’ joy is not constant, sometimes separate, sometimes united, according to thought. Now still all three souls are maintained standing on the great lord’s left side, also guarding the seven corporeal spirits. The great lord always holds the celestial elephant talisman, to unite and direct the primal black, supplement the foetus, restore the foetus. This god is the beginning of the foetal origin, with no root for essence, so always holding this talisman to guide and direct, causing the fluids to flow, supplementing the brain and enriching the marrow.

At evening lying down, first close the black for twenty-four breaths, then mentally invoke the great lord’s name thrice, then swallow saliva fifty times, tap teeth thrice, maintain the three palaces, then close the no-maintenance great lord’s attire and my soul as above, count completely, mentally call: Mysterious Gate Birth Palace Great Lord Peach Child character He Yan. Complete, then slowly swallow saliva, maintaining to direct fluid to the gate [text missing]. Softly invoke: Foetal spirit great god, imperial thorough lord, holding the foetal talisman, head wrapped in purple cap, circling scarlet and red, the essence at the life gate, transforming spirit returning life, six harmonies mutually aiding, form and frame shining bright, jade maiden mate with five tones. Complete. By constant practice for eighteen years, the great lord can stir the three fields on the left, guard the three blacks on the right, the fields transform into flying chariots, the swallows into mysterious dragons, commanding twenty-four gods above, guiding the soul spirits below, calling six heavenly officials of the yang Jia, summoning six officials of the yin Ding, a thousand chariots, ten thousand riders, ascending white sun to heaven; all are the responses brought by Lord Peach. Though the Way is small, there is something to observe. The Bright Hall Three Old Lords is the highest method, followed by the central section of the *Yellow Court Inner Scripture*, then the right with the method of Yellow and Red Inner Truth. If practiced rightly, immortality may be attained, but purity and truth rank below virtue, thus are the lowly attendants of filth and baseness. Juanzi says: He Yan dwells on the left, governing true life spirit, able on the left to stir clouds and wheels, on the right to drive flying dragons, commanding twenty-four gods above, guiding soul spirits below, a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, calling yang and summoning yin, ascending white sun to heaven: the wondrous matters come from the *Spirit Book Purple Writ Upper Scripture*. Yang Tong dwells on the right, governing yin to harmonize yang, harmonizing the two instruments, revolving elixir to pour yellow, traversing six harmonies, essence filling five elements, able also to raise the whole body and ascend to Supreme Purity; this Way is difficult, only the perfect man may practice it; wondrous matters are fully set out in the Yellow and Red Inner Truth. Ling Yuan dwells in the central part, governing the stomach and generating flesh, harmonizing blood and moistening fluids, dispersing hardness and dissolving firmness, condensing essence, form, and spirit, expelling all diseases and decay, strengthening corporeal spirit and refining soul, ears and eyes keen, face fair and fresh, able also to rise lightly and float in the air, ascending the great firmament in the morning. This is the matter of the Bright Hall Three Old Lords described by Zhou Ziyang quoting Juanzi. The left lord’s name is as in this scripture; the right is Peach Kang, character Yang Tong; the middle is Hun Kang, character Ling Yuan, each with its own charge and differing importance. The *Seeking Truth Scripture*’s various methods treat men and women alike, with no partial cultivation. As for the gods within the body, likewise all male in form, cap and robe alike; only Daoism has one to distinguish, that is the upper palace female deity who descends and is made manifest, hence specially spoken of; the rest are male forms. This invocation says jade maiden spouse, not meaning as wife or concubine, but spouse meaning alignment; the jade maiden lies with oneself, like the Way of the Profound Truth, the jade maiden descends to lie and breathe with one; how could women not also practice it? The Lady of the Turtle Terrace is the original of this. Many in the world are confused about this matter, hence this is again mentioned.

### Elephant Talisman

The Supreme Subtle Emperor Lord’s Heavenly Elephant Talisman.

The right Heavenly Elephant Talisman is given to the birth palace great god Peach Child He Yan, who unites the primal upper beam, governs the foetus and moves essence. Written in vermilion on blue paper, on the night of the new moon or full moon at midnight, facing north one wears it. Holding the talisman in the left hand, closing black, rising at midnight, binding the belt and burning incense, facing north, write the talisman; when completed, each in order folds and holds it again, then closing eyes facing the beam, maintaining the great lord, one then invokes: I mentally invoke: Heavenly Emperor Mysterious Scripture, Elephant Spirit Talisman, to unite the primal black, govern essence and restore the foetus, a ten-thousand-year infant, flying immortal at the celestial pivot, birth palace great god, adorned with cinnabar and vermilion, head capped in purple and wearing the lotus, conspiring with me in five tones. Complete, then wear it; after wearing, rise and bow twice. The talisman is worn on the sleeping bed. Each is worn in order, maintaining that it reaches the great lord’s place, then let the left hand take and hold it completely, again facing north and bowing to the Supreme Subtle Heavenly Emperor. This is the method of returning fluids to direct essence, hence to be done only upon the bed, with no need for other quiet rooms.

If a Daoist has the Way of Returning Essence, revolving yellow to red, morning essence filling the life gate, directing fluids to moisten and irrigate, causing man and woman to share the elixir and the face to grow jade shine, know that the great lord’s name and the wearing of the elephant talisman means immortality. If in the world’s days one has not ceased the conjugal Way, still for inner truth matters, then both man and woman should receive the practice and wear the talisman, not one alone. If one only practices and does not know the divine names, returns essence but does not wear this talisman, not seeing its invocation nor knowing the palaces it dwells in, though gaining a thousand years of life, hence returns to the corpse of the Great Yin, only accumulating the passage of years, hence must return bones to the Three Officials. This means one only able to refine essence and internal truth, skillful in yang communication, but ignorant of the secret invocations of the left division and the essential methods of the elephant talisman; though able to prolong life for hundreds or thousands of years, one cannot become immortal. How much less now that no one can practice it, yet desires it; their own ruin is thus certain and fitting. Daoists should at evening lying down constantly maintain the great lord, as a method of invocation; at new and full moons wear talismans, next conduct the benefit of generating foetal essence; thus one also becomes an immortal, without troubling the male and female returning and supplementing techniques. Man’s life has male and female yin and yang signs, paired as plants and insects, naturally by heart and nature. Now, having solitary shadows in forests and marshes, severed from mates in deep rocks, no longer engaging in intercourse, and also hidden scriptures forbid it, when the four qi are at their mists and vapours, how can it be without yearning or the qi of autumn? Thus the spiritual gates become obstructed and stagnant, essence and thoughts congeal and scatter, then demons and spirits mingle and linger, heart matters rise and fall, inwardly causing the spirit pool to empty and leak, outwardly causing the face to decline and fade. Therefore one should wear talismans to replace the benefit of circulating and refining, maintain the spirit to direct the method of irrigation and transformation, so that the two qi are unbiased, spirits harmonize and mingle. This indeed is the excellent method for the body, the utmost essential of stillness in the universe. Yet to control women for the purpose of soaring and flying, to revolve the boundaries in search of heavenly immortals, is a harsh game more severe than water and fire, qi assaults faster than axes and chisels; unless one has the spirit of resignation and embracing unity, one is likely thereby to lose it. The middling may practice it, what is called swallowing the sword and desiring the throat not to be harmed, might be obtained. Inner truth affairs are thus harmful; only the highest talent can practice them, yet disdain their baseness. The middle and lower scholars therefore cease to mention such arts, forever discarded. Nowadays worldly followers all dig at the Three Officials’ pens; alas, mournful indeed!

### Prohibitions

The birth palace great god lord forbids people to eat raw blood, forbids burning the hair of the six domesticated animals, forbids burning skins and leaves of gourds, garlic, and all kinds of smoked vegetables; all disturb and disorder the foetal beam, foul and harm the infant god, be cautious. All smells foul and bloody must be avoided, not only these listed. This is to give the chief prohibitions. Human hair, animal horns, bird feathers, insect skins, and the like, all are detested by the body gods; touching their prohibitions causes the spiritual essence to flee and scatter, accumulating over years, suddenly startled and lost; how lamentable!

### Confession of Faults

Those who study the Way, on the day of the autumnal equinox, all maintain true fasting and abstinence, do not think of evil, their hearts always wishing to become flying immortals. This matter is the constant practice of the learner, not only on the equinox day, but on this day especially should be earnest. The ancient perfect men said: If you desire to ascend to heaven, be cautious at the autumnal equinox; all sins, large and small, are reported above; seeking immortality through sin is very difficult; hence learning the Way makes the heart cold. This is the true essential word. The Azure Lord speaks the words of the ancients who first attained the Way. In the time of the Heavenly Emperor Shen Nong, though not calculating the calendar precisely, the seasonal conjunctions all were known; by the time of the day of the Huan Ying marker, the month was already watered. If a long-fasting Daoist, at midday on the equinox, confesses to the seven ancestors and grandparents, downward to all personal sins, seeking to reform and vow, on that day centered in a secret chamber, facing north, burning incense, opening to the Supreme Lord and all the teaching assemblies, according to number each bows twice, then themselves declare first to give thanks and apologize. The form is like the five passes ritual, also vowing not to commit again; according to what is said, this also has effect, only not identical. Without truly absolute severance of worldly nature, be cautious on this day to confess sins, be cautious. If not of high aspirations and lofty conduct, with a firm and pure spirit, one should not all take this as vow. Pei's commentary says: If sins are repeated, they cannot be resolved. If such spirit is thus, certainly one can no longer do it; then according to circumstances declare thanks, but should not utter many words. This day’s confession of faults is important, and analogous to the five passes, but the ritual is not fully shown, being brief. Pei’s commentary on the eight festivals is the words of Master Zhi Gong; it has been examined by the perfect man, and should be usable, and also refer to the equinox day’s matters for use. Maintain truth. The Azure Youth Lord’s name is Si Si, maintained at every festival day. This name’s upper character should be taken from the jade record sound, not the Buddhist pronunciation. At festivals or ordinary days, morning, midday, and midnight, one should enter the chamber, burn incense, bow twice, maintain and note invocation and blessing, to request the immortal record to record names in the azure register, saying whatever is convenient. Facing the sunrise, when invoking cultivation, according to the Dingmao method is even better. The Azure Lord is chief minister, holding the register of life and death, observing and examining the fate of the people, auspicious at the eight festivals, thus ordering prayer and maintenance. Though the name is recorded, this is taken from inside the scripture as self-designation as a minor official, not to be called. Now not suitable for Daoism, but if the heart recognizes and remembers, then no suspicion.

### The Purple Writ Decisions, altogether twelve matters.

### Seven, Decisions for the Practice of the Nine Truths and Eight Ways, Seventh

The Nine Truths and Eight Ways are so named by their numbers.

### Bathing

The Eight Ways Secret Words say: The Nine Truths and Eight Ways are methods of cultivation and maintenance, all declared by Huang-Lao, mutually assisting and complementing. Therefore the matters of the Nine Truths are recorded in secret words. To practice the Nine Truths method, long fasting and pure chamber, practice the Nine Truths Way, nine times a day inwardly inspect essence carefully, requiring full stillness; without long fasting and guarding stillness, it is hard to maintain constantly. Always on the 3rd day of the 3rd month and 5th day of the 5th month, bathe in east-flowing water. Also on the jiazi day bathe, burn incense on both sides of the bath, then face Wang Shu and bow twice. Though jiazi bathing differs from those later, because its date is different, so the sentences differ; not because one does not use east-flowing water. Use hot water, according to cold and heat, first bathe early, at midday dry hair and bathe again; bathing is always toward Wang, incense burned at the place, when finished, comb hair, bind belt, arrange robes, burn incense in the quiet chamber, then face Wang, bow twice and kneel in respect. Mentally invoke: Supreme Most High Perfect, Essence of the Nine Spirits, cause [name] to fly immortal, ascend to the Purple Court, bathe in the flowery pool, body and spirit pure and clear, essence penetrating the great void, the five viscera spontaneously generate four tones. Judging from this invocation, it is after bathing, bowing, and invocation, hence the final word “finished.” Also the invocation says bathing together, not each separately; if meaning to say incense is burned before bowing and invocation, now at bathing time one may burn incense, face Wang and bow twice, first invoke before bathing, then bathe; no objection to finishing by bowing and invoking again. When in doubt, take the more careful course; it is no hindrance.

### On the Spirit

The Supreme Most High says: Man’s life arises from essence condensed and qi accumulated, receiving foetal blood and gathering blood, hence condensing bones and expelling fluids, dispersing and flowing liquids, suddenly standing, suddenly complete, without knowing how or being able to grasp, then perfectly formed and born. Man’s birth is sustained by essence; essence condensed, yin and yang qi accumulated and attached to form the foetus; then blood is poured and bones established, slowly shaping human form. When form is complete, spirit also enters, then life is possible. This subtle transformation of essence cannot be sought by reason; the source of all life is not surpassed. It is like a bird’s egg; if opened, only a drop of liquid is visible; when the foetal membrane is formed and feathers are nurtured, whence does it come, by whom is it carved? It is spontaneous and natural; creation too is unmeasurable and inexplicable. All that contains blackness, not only in form and shape resembling parents, but also in nature, knowledge, will, and thought, all alike. Thinking of this division of spirits and their distribution to multitude, up to this. When grown, some may change feelings and disposition, like plants bearing fruit in foreign soil, losing original colour and taste. This is all due to casting and dyeing, not to change of origin.

It is said the nine gods come to enter, the five viscera thus arise; when the form and substance are complete, and the five viscera established, then at birth the great gods come to enter, and life span, death, good and bad are determined. One god with nine names, hence called nine gods. Parents know only the beginning of birth and nurture, unaware the spirits go to the eight quarters. Parents do not know this is the work of transformation, nor understand the spirits’ manner. Spirits themselves do not know, much less men.

The human body has the honoured gods; their dwelling is not fixed, moving and circulating, flowing and pouring the primal fluids. These gods come from outside and internally combine to establish the body, unlike the three souls and seven corporeal spirits, which accumulate spirits and receive qi, born of father and mother. The souls and corporeal spirits all arise from parents’ fluids, transforming embryo and networks mutually completing. Yang clarity forms the soul, yin turbidly forms the corporeal spirit, not relying on external things. As for the great gods, they are those assigned by the director of fate, matched with the mysterious essence; formerly they were the remnants of broken tombs, now assigned to the foetus to become man; this is called the prenatal body. Now my whole body, soul and corporeal spirit are the parents’ divided spirits; form and bones are made by the five elements; the hundred gods are managed and fashioned by the heavenly spirits; wisdom and desire are governed by the qi; as for lifespan, life and death, poverty and wealth, rank and lowliness, fate and misfortune, virtue and evil, and the five roads of reincarnation, when all [text missing], it must be this one great god. Everyone has it but none can know themselves. The honoured gods have nine names, called the nine true lords, dividing and transforming above and below, changing form in myriad ways; if one can cultivate them, then emerging from water and entering fire, the five viscera spontaneously generate flowers, not remaining in one place, hence able to transform manifoldly; if long kept without leaving, their place remains constant. Only awaiting to return, to manifest thereby to change and return to truth. Long fasting and seclusion to maintain truth. Dao fasting is called guarding stillness; Buddhist fasting is called meditating in the morning. Daoist stillness places the hands on the knees; Buddhist morning [text missing] the hands on [text missing]. This explains the meaning of fasting. Stillness with joined hands naturally makes all spirits clear; joining palms and meditating makes the form fully transparent; this is the true attainment of Dao and Buddha, the proper path of the two fastings. The Buddha’s Way is but a method of the Dao, forgetting form and guarding spirit, the extreme of subtlety. Meditation in the morning is now called thinking on Zen. The Jade Emperor remains at Qin; the mysterious essence shares the form; the Red Lord of the Southern Peak, according to teaching, changes attire. The methods of the masters differ; their followers about half; the Nine Truth disciples, two schools are similarly advanced; this is the Way having internal and external, methods differing, originally not separated by Hu or Rong, nor by coarse and fine. Yet borderlands are strong and robust, so they use the grand scripture; central China is soft and subtle, so they follow its depths.

### One Heart

The first true method: at daybreak the great god dwells in the heart, called the Heavenly Essence Lord. The great god is still the great god; the original position of the god, hence called the great. The great god dwells in the inner chamber; now first transforming the original substance, coming to reside in the heart, hence beginning with first. On ordinary days the first daybreak follows the length of the sun, having no fixed name, so it cannot be called the hour of Yin, but the hour of Mao is not maintained; rather it is taken between the two hours. The directions faced depend upon the Ascending Mystery separate decisions, the moon is chosen by its meaning. Place the hands on the knees, close breath, close eyes, look inward, face the south, sit upright, place hands on knees, close eyes, breathe once, maintain the god and expel all, closing nine breaths, the god emits ninefold light, then open breath, tap and swallow invoking. The breathing and expelling are made slow and subtle. The same afterwards. Maintain the Heavenly Essence Lord seated in the heart, maintaining the god above and below, clothed in scarlet robes, wearing a red essence lotus crown, left bearing the spirit book, right wearing tiger pattern, as the invocation says. The great god’s nine transformations have form and appearance like a newborn infant, sitting facing outward, size and length indefinite. The place where it sits in the [text missing] hole, even if not entirely vacant, still within the reality obtains a form resembling itself so as not to sense lack. The locations of the viscera and bowels, high and low in order, are fully recorded among the twenty-four gods, but no longer revealed. Also place the great god facing the hour of Zi in the inner chamber; at Chou hour not maintained, yet still remaining to this day; at Yin hour it suddenly enters the heart; when maintained in the heart, one no longer thinks whence it came, only sees it. Afterwards all is thus. Let the great god emit purple light, encircling ninefold outside the heart. The purple beam is now purple flower colour. To encircle the heart ninefold is like restraining the corporeal spirit white crown body ninefold, each making one fold. Initially one exhales qi, only letting it near outside; afterwards gradually dividing, each layer to left and right, reaching the crown, all nine layers until finished—each interval disconnected, only seeming like a chicken egg inner shell, making a circle, sensing nine armies in number. See the heart and god dwelling in the beam, dimly shining. Afterwards all follow this. When finished, tap teeth nine times, swallow saliva nine times; these eight acts of tapping and swallowing nine times correspond to the ninefold beam, so no need to correspond to the numbers of the viscera. The invocation also softly says: Heavenly Essence Great Lord, come to the heart, body clad in scarlet robes, head crowned with red crown, left bearing spirit book, right wearing tiger pattern, emitting purple blossoms, nourishing heart and condensing soul, red viscera born spontaneously, able to become flying immortal. Five tones. Then open eyes.

### Two Bones

The second true method: at Chen hour the great god divides the form entirely in the bones, called the Firm Jade Lord. Since it says the form is entirely in the bones, each bone has a god, incalculable in number; their form and attire are all alike. At Chen hour place hands on knees, close breath, close eyes, look inward, the Firm Jade Lord enters and seats in all the hundreds of bones of the body; since Mao hour is not maintained, it remains in the heart. Now face You direction to maintain the god, clothed all in white, cap lotus essence white crown, left bearing dragon book, right wearing golden truth. Maintain first the head bones, then in order mutually maintain, opening marrow and joints, all made to circulate, every bone has a god. When finished, again maintain all the marrow of the body, making all sense gods emit white and black, exhaling to circle bones ninefold. The white beam is now white jade colour. Maintain thought upon all bones, making each emit black to circle outside the bones. Finished, again maintain all tendons and bones outside, large and small according to form, surrounding above and below, all ninefold. Though bone form has length and shortness, each follows its joint and division as a segment, not continuous from head to tail. Finished, tap teeth nine times, swallow saliva nine times. Invocation: Jade Firm Great Lord, come enter the bones, body clad in plain robes, head wearing white crown, left bearing dragon book, right wearing golden truth, emitting white splendor, strengthening bones and condensing sinews, white bones uncorrupted, sinews not destroyed, all joints blossoming, enable me to fly immortal. Five tones. Then open eyes. The two previous names both say Firm Jade; this invocation says Jade Firm, perhaps an error; yet it calls it again and again, still one kind. Also the character maintained as zai is also an error.

### Three Blood Vessels

The third true method: at Si hour the great god divides the form entirely flowing into the essence and blood, called the Primordial Life Lord. This also divides the body and disperses to the places of essence, blood, all with form and attire, all the same. This only says essence and blood, taking their outline. At Si hour place hands on knees, close breath, close eyes, look inward, maintain Primordial Life Lord wandering throughout the body’s blood vessels and essences. The blood vessels and essences have no holes, so cannot be said to enter and seat, but only to wander. Face Wei direction to maintain the god, clothed all in yellow robes, cap purple lotus crown, left bearing tiger register, right wearing dragon book. Maintain division and form dispersing, all entering these four places, blood and essence dispersed and flowing, only the vessels are the inner paths of qi and blood; though connected with essences and fluids, they have no palaces or residences but are most formed, so qi may circle; thus cause to bind. Make emit yellow qi, to bind pores and vessels outside ninefold. The yellow addition is now female yellow colour. Qi, blood, and essence all flow through vessels; vessel places have holes, so that gods each emit additions to bind their outsides, branches and strands dispersed according to size, all ninefold; not like other places all together as one. Since the gods each emit additions outside, it does not say to circle but only to bind; this means causing additions first to bind inward, then gradually make outside. The vessels are not like bones with limited joints; now in accord with the Bright Hall flows and pours, taking the twelve meridians plus the Ren and Du meridians and spleen network, making fifteen vessels from beginning to end. Finished, tap teeth nine times, swallow saliva nine times. Invocation: Primordial Life Great Lord, pervading and irrigating blood and body, body clad in yellow robes, head wearing purple lotus, left bearing tiger register, right wearing dragon book, emitting yellow fluid, strengthening blood and filling void, essence full and fluid overflowing, nine spirits dwelling together, enable me to fly immortal, heaven and earth sign together. Five tones. Then open eyes.

### Four Liver

The fourth true method: at Wu hour the great god dwells in the liver, called the Azure Bright Lord. At Wu hour place hands on knees, close breath, close eyes, look inward, maintain Azure Bright Great Lord entering and seating in the liver, face Yin direction to maintain god, clothed all in blue robes, cap green lotus crown, left bearing tiger seal, right wearing dragon pattern. Among the five viscera only the heart has a large hole, all others small; it seats within them without passing through each hole. The viscera differ in size; liver and lungs are large, the number of lobes is many; all exhale black and move so as to circulate. Make emit azure smoke to encircle liver ninefold. The azure mat is now empty blue colour. Afterwards encircle the viscera also, all arising outside and entering inside, counting completely. Finished, tap teeth nine times, swallow saliva nine times. Invocation: Azure Bright Great Lord, come enter my liver, body clad in blue robes, head wearing green crown, left bearing tiger seal, right wearing dragon pattern, emitting azure smoke, nourishing liver and leading spirit, blue viscera born spontaneously, above an immortal, Supreme One guarding essence, embracing corporeal spirit, inspecting soul. Six tones. Then open eyes.

### Five Spleen

The fifth true method: at Wei hour the great god dwells in the spleen, called the Nourishing Light Lord. At Wei hour place hands on knees, close breath, close eyes, look inward, maintain Nourishing Light Lord entering and seating in the spleen, facing Chen direction to maintain god, clothed all in green robes, cap lotus crown, left bearing jade bell, right wearing awe god. Make emit green-black to encircle spleen ninefold. The green-black is now green-blue colour. Finished, tap teeth nine times, swallow saliva nine times. Invocation: Nourishing Light Great God, come enter the spleen, body clad in green robes, head wearing lotus crown, left bearing jade bell, right wearing awe god, emitting green blossoms, nourishing spleen and irrigating soul, yellow viscera born spontaneously, above a perfect man. Five tones. Then open eyes.

### Six Lung

The sixth true method: at Shen hour the great god dwells in the lungs, called the White Origin Lord. At Shen hour place hands on knees, close breath, close eyes, look inward, maintain White Origin Lord entering and seating in the lungs, facing Shen direction to maintain god, clothed all in dragon patterned robes, cap yellow morning bloom crown, left bearing mysterious book, right wearing tiger pattern. Left hand holds imperial registry, right hand holds spirit volume. Make emit five-coloured qi to encircle lungs ninefold. The five colours are blue, red, white, black, yellow. Each emission includes all five colours. Finished, tap teeth nine times, swallow saliva nine times. Invocation: White Origin Great Lord, come sit in the lungs, body clad in dragon robes, yellow morning bloom crown, left holding imperial registry, right holding spirit volume, left bearing mysterious book, right wearing tiger pattern, emitting five qi, regulating lungs and harmonizing fluids, white viscera born spontaneously, flying immortal of the purple gate. Six tones. Then open eyes.

---

### Seven Kidney

The seventh true method: at You hour the great god divides and seats, scattering form in both kidneys, called the Mysterious Yang Lord. There are two kidneys; the god’s seat divides into two forms. At You hour place hands on knees, close breath, close eyes, look inward, maintain Mysterious Yang Lord entering and seating in both kidneys, face Zi direction to maintain god, wearing purple robes, cap Fu morning bloom crown, left bearing dragon talisman, right wearing phoenix pattern; each in one kidney facing each other sitting opposite. This entry character should be “divide form,” but in this scripture follows earlier precedent as “enter,” later forgot to correct. Make emit warehouse qi to encircle kidneys ninefold. The warehouse heat is now watery blue, pale green colour. Each god exhales qi, each circling one kidney. Finished, tap teeth nine times, swallow saliva nine times. Invocation: Mysterious Yang Great Lord, enter and seat in kidneys, body clad in purple robes, head wearing Fu morning crown, left bearing dragon talisman, right wearing phoenix pattern, emitting warehouse blossoms, irrigate kidney spirit root, black viscera born spontaneously, body becomes flying immortal, ascending north to the mysterious gate, roaming celestial passes. Six tones. Then open eyes.

### Eight Gall Bladder

The eighth true method: at Xu and Hai hours the great god dwells in the gall bladder, called the Harmonious Bright Lord. Xu and Hai hours correspond to dusk; the day length varies, so two times are evident; if the day is long, use Xu hour; if short, use Hai hour; in the second and eighth lunar months between Xu and Hai hours. Formerly daybreak used Yin and Mao hours according to meaning, likewise. The perfect man’s mystery can be so. Place hands on knees, close breath, close eyes, look inward, maintain Harmonious Bright Lord entering and seating in the gall bladder, face Mao direction to maintain god, wearing green brocade robes, cap purple lotus crown, left bearing spirit light, right wearing jade truth. Make emit five-coloured qi to encircle gall bladder ninefold. Finished, tap teeth nine times, swallow saliva nine times. Invocation: Harmonious Bright Great God, come sit in the gall bladder, body clad in brocade robes, head wearing purple crown, left bearing spirit light, right wearing jade truth, emitting five excellences, nourishing gall bladder and strengthening soul, harmonizing essence and precious blood, regulating fluids and strengthening the body, enable me to ascend, become flying immortal. Six tones. Then open eyes.

### Nine Head

The ninth true method: at Zi hour the great god dwells in the head’s inner chamber, called the No Hero Lord. The No Hero Lord is originally the left god of the inner chamber; this name is again taken as a title, a transformation of essence, again returning to truth. When in the lungs he is called the White Origin, also the right White Origin Lord of the inner chamber; though separated and united differently, he is one god. At Zi hour sit upright, place hands on knees, close breath, close eyes, look inward; since it is midnight, fearing one lying down may lose maintenance, it is uniquely said to sit upright, also marking the true god’s original position. Face Chou direction. Maintain No Hero Lord sitting within the Bright Hall, inner chamber; the god wears phoenix patterned robes above, dragon patterned robes below, with five-coloured brocade, purple collar, blue belt, cap Fu morning bloom crown, left bearing jade brilliance, right wearing tiger pattern, holding golden essence, bright and shining, near the inner chamber’s left, facing outward. Make emit purple qi, encircling the head ninefold. The head’s hollow inside is all the city of the inner chamber; now though the god dwells in the main chamber, his emissions interconnect the nine palaces, all related, like the Three-One meditation method. His attire and tongue and teeth are separately before and below,
