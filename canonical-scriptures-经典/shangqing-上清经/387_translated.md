## The Classic of Essential Matters in Cultivating the Person of Shangqing

### I. The Method of Binding the Three Souls in the Lingshu Zhiwen of Taiwei

The Daoist should first examine and control the souls and spirits, and extinguish the corpses and ghosts. On the days of the month's last day and first day, and also on the days Gengshen and Jiayin, the practitioner should purify himself by fasting, enter the chamber, bathe off dust, take his seat with proper posture, and if he can remain awake so much the better. He should then mark below the inner corner of the left eye with a vermilion brush, and below the right nostril with an orpiment brush, so that a small portion enters within. When done, he shall gnash his teeth thrice in succession and offer this prayer:

> Two lights entwine and fly; vermilion and orpiment scatter as smoke; the qi binds the void and expels the evil; the corpse and filth sink and vanish; harmonizing the soul and refining the spirit, uniting the form with the great divinity; grant me immortality, long life and perfect health; keen brightness, piercing sight, enduring enjoyment of blessings and benefits.

Having completed this, he shall gnash his teeth thrice again, swallow saliva thrice, then pinch below the left eye with the right hand’s second finger seven times, and below the right nostril with the left hand’s second finger seven times, pressing down without lifting the hand. Thus all is completed. These two places are the gates through which the seven souls wander as corpses, the thoroughfares of demon spirits and thief evils; therefore the essence of vermilion and orpiment is received to block the path of corpses and ghosts, to bring the fragrance of the two lights, and to extinguish the disordered qi. This is the highest method of the Great Ultimate; if constantly practised, the souls and spirits will be at peace and harmony, the corpse filth will dissipate and cease, longevity and immortality will be obtained, spiritual clarity and penetrating vision attained; and if practised for three years, all colour and thought will vanish. This day is called the day of contention among corpses and ghosts; men and women must not sit together on this day. Be cautious.

When one studies the supreme Dao and recites the divine scriptures, every ten or twenty words one should lick the lips and swallow saliva thrice; every hundred or fifty words one should gnash the teeth two or three times, to summon the spirits and assemble the numinous, to harmonize and calm the blood and qi, so that the spiritual fluids condense and fill, the imperial unity rejoices in its abode; this is called the qi of the void not being exhausted, darkness not leaking away.

No Daoist method permits weeping or spitting, for these diminish the fluids and leak the essence, exhausting the throat and brain. Therefore the true Daoist constantly breathes out and swallows in harmony with the six fluids.

The Daoist should constantly hold in thought his own form and image, as if a mirror facing him, so that the light of sun and moon is ever present on his countenance, shining forth to illuminate the form; let the sun be on the left, the moon on the right, each at a distance of nine cun before the face. When this is stored, gnash the teeth thrice in succession and pray thus:

> Primordial embryo’s highest truth, twin lights and two mysteries; to the right hold the seven souls, to the left bind the three spirits; let my spirit and brightness abide always with the form.

Having ended, again gnash the teeth twenty-one times, swallow saliva seven times; this is called the method of the imperial lord to preserve the form, bind the spirits and control the souls, making one intelligent, immortal, and deathless. If the prayer is not obtained, one may still preserve it singly.

All the methods of gnashing teeth and swallowing saliva in Shangqing have their own prescriptions and order; one must not confuse or jumble them, lest the true spirits be confounded. Gnashing teeth commands the spirits; swallowing qi harmonizes the truth; inhaling and swallowing the six fluids operates and controls the spirits; the sounding of the ritual drum must accompany the sequence.

When cultivating the highest method, at the time of rites and prayers, one must first gnash the teeth, up and down striking, not sideways. One breath and one swallow should be made to swallow all qi and fluids; this is called calling the spirits and harmonizing the truth, with the intent to ascend to immortality.

On the third and thirteenth evenings of the month, the three souls are unsettled, the clear spirits wander, the embryonic light casts the form, the hidden essence disturbs and calls. These three lords of clear spirit, embryonic light, and hidden essence are the names of the three souls. On their evenings, they abandon the body and roam, drifting away from the abode; sometimes they are seen and detained by other souls or external ghosts, or are taken by demon beings, or fail to return and thus depart from form and release substance, or infringe on the external souls, so that the two qi contend; all become agitated infants, driven by alien thoughts, coming and going without form, hearts sorrowful and minds depressed. The practitioner must bind and retain them so that they wander not. The method of binding is to lie down facing upward, with the head supported by the shen foot (the foot corresponding to Shen), hands crossed with palms up; close the eyes and hold the breath for three breaths; gnash the teeth thrice in succession; hold in the mind a red qi like a chick’s egg rising from within upward, emerging from the eyes outward; the red qi grows large, enveloping the body ninefold, flowing down the body and up to the head and nape, transforming into fire, burning the body all around, making it transparent within and without, like burning charcoal. When all is done, there should be felt a mild warmth within. Then one must gnash the teeth thrice more, and hold the breath while calling the three souls’ names: Clear Spirit, Embryonic Light, Hidden Essence; the three souls will quickly abide. Then softly pray:

> Taiwei’s mysterious palace, central yellow, primal blue, within refining the three souls; embryonic light at peace; the divine jade chamber, born with me, move not rashly; the overseer is the Great Spirit; if wishing to fly, only may one seek the Taiyi Shangqing; if thirsty, only may one drink from the returning spring of jade essence. All completed.

### II. The Method of Restricting the Seven Souls in the Lingshu Zhiwen of Taiwei

On the new moon, full moon, and last day of the month at night, the seven souls wander, roaming in filth and impurity, sometimes communicating with blood and food; ghosts and spirits come and go; sometimes they associate with corpses; sometimes they seduce infants and plot treachery; sometimes they accuse men of crimes to the Three Officials and the River Lord; sometimes they transform into spectres and demons, causing disgust and harm; sometimes they cause ghosts to enter the body and call on evil to kill the substance. All diseases born in men are the guilt of the souls; the death of the happy is the nature of the souls; the ruin of men is the sickness of the souls. The Daoist must control and restrain them, refine and transform them, suppress and stop them, gather and awe them.

The first soul is called the Corpse Dog; the second, the Hidden Arrow; the third, Sparrow Yin; the fourth, Swallowing Thief; the fifth, Nonpoison; the sixth, Clearing Filth; the seventh, Stinking Rot. These are the yin-names of the seven souls, the impure ghosts within the body. The method of control is to join the hands behind the nape, close the breath seven times, gnash the teeth seven times in succession, holding in the nose tip a white qi like a small bean, which gradually grows to cover the body ninefold, flowing down to the feet and up to the head. When completed, the white qi suddenly transforms into celestial beasts: two azure dragons in the eyes, two white tigers in the nostrils, all facing outward; a vermilion bird above the heart, facing the mouth; an azure dragon beneath the left foot; a spirit serpent beneath the right foot; in both ears are jade maidens clad in dark brocade, standing at the ear gates; each hand grasps a flame of fire. After a while, all is done. Then swallow saliva seven times, gnash the teeth seven times, call the seven souls’ names, and softly pray:

> White qi ninefold, restraining the souls’ evil and misfortune; celestial beasts guard the gates; tender maidens hold the passes; refining the souls to harmony and gentleness; abiding with me in peace; move not rashly; observe and watch the root of the form; if hungry or thirsty, drink the moon-yellow and sun-cinnabar.

All completed. Thus the seven souls are closed within, mutually guarding and restrained. If constantly practised, the impure souls will be consumed below and return to good dwelling; above, they will harmonize the three palaces and unite with the original spirit.

### III. The Method of Repelling Evil Dreams by the True Person Tai Su

If one frequently meets with evil dreams, they are: first, the soul’s affliction; second, the trial of the heart; third, the theft by corpses. To dispel and consume these, upon awakening from a dream, twist the philtrum beneath the nose with the left hand two or seven times, gnash the teeth twice or seven times in succession, and softly pray:

> Great Void, true mystery, expand and refine the three souls; first soul quickly guard the seven souls; second soul quickly guard the mud pellet; third soul receive the heart’s governance; quickly summon the Three Primal Lords of Tai Su. When unlucky dreams occur, it is the seven souls and wandering corpses conspiring, the origin of myriad evils; urgently summon Tao Kang to protect life; report to the imperial lord; the Five Elders and Nine Truths guard the body gates; the Yellow Gate spirit master and Purple Door general grasp the axe and bell; disperse and destroy evil thoroughfares; reverse misfortune to blessing; life and death have no cause.

Having finished, if one lies down again, good response will be obtained; if evil dream qi still arises, it will be shut beneath the heavenly gate. After three years, only divine inspiration and proper response remain; then dreams will disclose clear and accurate foresight, no longer with evil portents or ill omens. If one meets a good dream at night, a fortunate sign and heart rejoicing, this is a fortunate response. Upon waking, rub the eyes twice or seven times, gnash the teeth twice or seven times, and softly pray:

> Supreme High Essence, Three Emperors’ cinnabar spirits; the vermilion palace clear and bright; fortunate response announces tidings; the Three Primal gentle souls; the Heavenly Emperor imparts the scripture; all directions harmonize; fly upwards to Shangqing; always with the Jade True; together assemble in the Purple Court.

All completed. This is the great secret method of the Great Void, transmitted to those first crossing the ferry of the stream.

### IV. The Method of Obtaining Auspicious Dreams by the True Person Tai Su

Whenever a scholar dreams of a woman clothed in purple gauze, carrying a dish of food to receive, do not fear or reject the food, for all such food is the true splendour of the Eastern Sea, or rare and wonderful herbs from Mount Song and the Five Sacred Mountains. By eating it one may attain longevity and prolong life.

When a Daoist sleeps by day, he first presses with both hands the four corners of the eyes and temples three or seven times, gnashes the teeth three or seven times, then lies down.

When a Daoist sleeps at dusk, he first presses with the left hand the two nostrils three or seven times, gnashes the teeth three or seven times, then lies down.

---

### V. The Prayer of Peaceful Sleep by the Daoist of the Supreme Yellow Essence

When the Daoist prepares to sleep, he places the hand over the heart thrice, closes the eyes, and prays:

> Great Spirit of the Nine Palaces, Taiyi guards the chamber; all spirits attend their places; souls and spirits harmonize; longevity and immortality; block and extinguish evil and misfortune.

Finished, and then sleep.

---

### VI. The Prayer for Dispelling Demons and Controlling Ghosts by the Jade Pure

If a Daoist travels or lodges alone in places haunted by demon spirits and evil ghosts, he should gnash the left teeth thirty-six times, hold his breath, and softly pray:

> Supreme Emperor, Yang origin; four networks of hidden passes; thousands of afflictions and myriad poisons; dare to face me before; giant beasts with heavy jaws; gutting belly, slaughtering liver; divine officials and messengers; guard and protect the camp; yellow-clad soldier troops; slay and destroy affliction spirits; behead and annihilate myriad demons; crush and cast down evil traitors; utterly destroy their kind; enact the will of the Jade Emperor; cleanse and sweep the Three Primes.

Finished, then gnash the teeth thirty-six times again. This is called the Supreme Emperor’s method of wielding the spirit for internal prayer to block and extinguish myriad demons.

---

### VII. The Method of Observing Unauspicious Things during Fasting by the Supreme Yellow Essence

When the Daoist fasts and enters his chamber, and there is an unauspicious thing, he should perform the prayer of the Northern Emperor to expel ghosts. First gnash the left teeth thirty-six times, and pray:

> Two images revolve and incline; banner of the Mysterious One; seven spirits protect life; ascend to the Three Pure Ones; twin sovereigns expel; frighten the soldiers of Buluo; three hundred thousand men; attend the spirit camp; giant beasts a hundred zhang tall; breathe forth power to seize the essence; wield sword to chase away evil; behead and cast down demons; spirit elder’s blessing; thousand afflictions destroyed.

Finished, then gnash the teeth thirty-six times again.

---

### VIII. The Method of Refining and Praying over the Corpses by the Green Waist Purple Book

All who cultivate the Shangqing Dao, when parents, uncles, and brothers die in this world, and the traces of their persons have not yet utterly vanished, so that the dead corpse lies in the midst of men, on the third day take a jar of clear water, one tael of vermilion, and cast it into the water. Facing south in the central courtyard near the water, gnash the teeth nine times, and pray:

> Qi transforms into spirit; the corpse changes and enters mystery; three transformations and five refinings; ascend to the nine heavens; the tribulations of the nine heavens; cross the armour body; the armour body transforms again; to become a true person.

Finished. When a man dies, think of three jade boys; when a woman dies, think of seven jade maidens. Fill the jar with water and pour over the corpse. Finished, take water to wash hands and face, look up to heaven and rinse the mouth. Then softly pray:

> The heavenly qi is clear; the human transformation is born; to be born above heaven; nine transformations change the form; the five sufferings and three burnings; sever the name of death; transcend and ferry the exhausted souls; return to the southern court.

Thus the deceased undergo transformation and are born above the nine heavens; after nine years they ascend to the palace of Jade Purity. This method is more wondrous than the Great Void’s ferrying of the Seven Ancestors; it is a secret of the Jade Emperor and not to be passed to the untrue. There is a golden-named imperial chart with green characters and purple writing; if one sees this text, do not lightly use it or rashly tell others; otherwise the Seven Ancestors and elders will long close the ghost officials, and in the three burnings and five sufferings, the myriad tribulations will not be pardoned. The bright laws of the four extremes have lasted over seven hundred years; the true person heeds transmission.

### IX. The Method for the Daoist of the Green Waist Purple Book when Seeing Other Corpses

Whenever a student of the highest learning travels the roads of the changing world and suddenly meets a dead body, foul qi drying the form, the student shall stop after twenty-four steps, face north, gnash the teeth nine times. For a male corpse, think of three jade boys; for a female corpse, think of seven jade maidens; invite and summon the yellow and white essences of the imperial grain to pour clear water over the corpse. After a while the corpse will transform and become a living man; then softly pray:

> Withered again to flourish; extinguished again to live; born above heaven; again receiving the Great Spirit; the tribulations of the nine heavens; repeated rebirth as embryo and infant; filth and defilement swept away; the white corpse revived.

Finished, wipe the eyes twice or seven times and stop. Thus the foul qi is dissolved, the dead again transformed, becoming spiritual persons. The student meets twenty-four passes, performs this refining prayer; when merit is full and virtue increased, their name will be recorded in Shangqing. After twenty-four years they may mount the spiritual chariot and fly through the nine mysteries.

### X. The Method of Divining Auspiciousness and Inauspiciousness in Foreign Lands for Mountain Dwellings

The inscription of the thirty-six sounds of the nine lands of the cave abyss:

- First mound: colour glossy, ground tone, moving tone, wandering tone, Brahman tone each one.
- Second mound: firm colour, ground tone, moving tone, wandering tone, Brahman tone likewise each one.
- Third mound: resinous colour, glossy, ground tone, moving tone, wandering tone, Brahman tone.
- Fourth mound: moist colour, glossy, ground tone, moving tone, wandering tone, Brahman tone.
- Fifth mound: golden millet colour, glossy, ground tone, moving tone, wandering tone, Brahman tone.
- Sixth mound: adamantine iron colour, ground tone, moving tone, wandering tone, Brahman tone.
- Seventh mound: water-controlled glossy colour, ground tone, moving tone, wandering tone, Brahman tone.
- Eighth mound: great wind glossy colour, ground tone, moving tone, wandering tone, Brahman tone.
- Ninth mound: the cave abyss colourless, firm earth qi, ground tone, moving tone, wandering tone, Brahman tone.

Those who desire to ascend mountains, dwell and settle homes, and to examine the auspiciousness or inauspiciousness of the land, should on the days Wu and Ji, write the Yellow Book of the nine lands’ thirty-six sounds on white paper, place it at the centre of the residence, cover it with a jar, and open it after three nights. If there is yellow glossy paper, it is very auspicious; if green, then there are dead spirits’ corpses beneath; white portends misfortune; red portends fright and terror; black portends treasure; purple portends attainment of immortals. If none of these vary, it is correct, and one may rest for three years. Beyond this time injury will occur.

---

### XII. The Supreme Lingbao Eight Powers Divine Staff Method

When the Daoist wishes to perform the divine staff method, he must gnash the teeth thirty-six times, think of the five emperors’ direct talisman officials, each one clothed in the colour of the direction, with five-coloured light flowing and shining on the staff; the five emperors’ jade maidens each one, together attending and guarding the staff on left and right. Softly pray:

> Mountain of the Sun, Primordial Highest Essence, opening heaven and spreading earth, sweet bamboo communicating spirits; direct talisman guards and officers; commanding divine soldiers; five-coloured light shining; vermilion robes and golden bells; assisting and supporting the highest truth; emerging from the hidden and entering the dark; summon the heavens reverently; govern the earth and welcome the earth deities; point at ghosts and cause destruction; bind affliction demons; spiritual talisman and divine staff; mighty control over all directions; together with me to accomplish, together with me to live; after myriad kalpas to replace my form; shadows becoming five dissolutions; spirit ascending Shangqing; receiving talisman and issuing commands; none dare disobey or disregard.

---

### XIII. The Method of Rescue from Solar Eclipse by the Green Waist Purple Book

The Purple Book secret says: On the day when the sun must appear in the central court, with a bright mirror towards the sun, the practitioner wields a great knife, faces south, gnashes the teeth thirty-six times, and raises the prayer:

> Sunlight boy, yang light red essence; shining Luo True Man; shadow within jade spirit; moving with the qi; solemn and pure above and below; yin members plot within; invading the sun court.

The heavenly mirror wields the staff; imperial ministers assist soldiers; three and five take their proper places; yang light shining clearly. Heaven and earth take turns consuming; none dare to arise; all return to their places; no loss or gain allowed; the Jade Emperor commands; none dare to disobey. Then draw qi twenty-four breaths and stop. Thus heaven and earth return to their places; three and five shine in unison; the boys rejoice; sunlight returns the spirit; flowing light mysteriously pours; descending to the practitioner; names recorded on purple slips; inscribed in the Jade Pure; within nine years one may ride the green carriage, ride the void and empty, flying to Shangqing.

---

### XIV. The Method of Rescue from Lunar Eclipse by the Green Waist Purple Book

The Purple Book secret says: On the day of the lunar eclipse, go out to the central court at night, take a jar of clear water; the practitioner wields a single knife, faces the water and the moon, gnashes the teeth sixteen times, and raises the prayer:

> Heaven and earth separate and join; circular qi overcomes loss; invading and eroding the moon’s abode; above hangs the yellow radiance.

Imperial ministers wield the staff; Jade Morning mends the wrong; heavenly soldiers form a circle; divine officials display power; none dare arise; attached shadows move subtly; speedily return to original place; no violation allowed.

Pray thus thrice to the moon; with the knife return thrice to the water jar and stop; by the water draw qi sixteen breaths and finish. The lunar eclipse is thus resolved; heavenly light cleansed; three and five shine together; myriad palaces at peace. The True Person of the Moon, Lady Lingguang, rejoices in gladness; returns the spirit mysteriously reflecting; descends the child’s sentiment; then records in the Northern Emperor’s registers; removes the child’s death name; inscribes in the Jade Script of the Upper Azure Palace; appoints twelve jade maidens to attend the practitioner. For nine years thus, one may ride the flying rosy clouds and ascend to the Moon Court. The way is most wondrous, but is not practised in the world; those who obtain it possess a precious secret; be careful not to lightly transmit.

---

### XV. The Method of Dispelling Corpses and Filth by the Supreme Yellow Essence

When a Daoist encounters dead corpses or blood and filth, he should cast one zhu of vermilion into a jar of water, use it to wash the eyes, rinse the mouth, wash hands and feet; then enter the room and take his proper seat, hands crossed with palms up, gnash the teeth fourteen times, bow the heart to the four quarters, and pray:

> The Three Primes uphold the Dao; Taiyi guards the form; the Lord of Life and Fate; the five spirits of Yellow Tranquillity; blood and corpses disperse and vanish; evil filth sinks and ceases; the seven fluids coil and linger; the five viscera flourish; grant me to be a divine immortal; long enjoy blessings and uprightness.

When finished, close the eyes and hold the breath a good while; a slight warmth in the body is a sign; then again gnash the teeth seven times, swallow saliva thrice. This is the inner method of the Three Primes to dispel filth.

---

### XVI. The Prayer for Haircutting and Hairwashing by the Supreme Yellow Essence

Whenever the Daoist is to cut hair and bind the topknot, or to wash his hair and loosen it, he first gnashes the teeth seven times and prays:

> Supreme Emperor scatters blossoms; the mysterious yin great god; today is a lucky day; hair cutting and dust washing; dispel evil and remove disaster; longevity and immortality.

Having finished, tie the topknot; then gnash the teeth seven times again; all is completed. This is called the Supreme Emperor’s inner method of scattering blossoms and hair cutting; it makes one free from illness all year, ears and eyes clear, and head and mind free from pain.

---

### XVII. The Method of Bathing the Body and Washing Hands and Face by the Supreme Yellow Essence

When the Daoist bathes the body and washes hands and face, he first approaches water, gnashes the teeth thrice, then prays:

> The four great elements open and clear; heaven and earth are constant; mysterious water washes away filth; dispels and removes bad fortune; twin stars guard the gates; seven spirits comfort the chamber; cloud ferry refines and pours; myriad qi mingles and prospers; inside and outside benefit uprightness; preserve this Yellow Robe.

When finished, gnash the teeth thrice again, then wash hands and face. This is called the prayer of washing filth and removing ill-fortune of the seven chambers. Those who constantly practise it will have clear spirit and blood, and repel all evil qi.

---

### XVIII. The First Prayer before Eating in the Fasting of the Supreme Yellow Essence

Whenever the Daoist enters the room to fast, before eating he commonly holds the sinews with his left hand, gnashes the teeth thrice, then prays:

> Two mysteries ascend the Dao; four extremes clear and cold; Taiyi Emperor Lord; hundred spirits of Yellow Tranquillity; receive food in the three palaces; irrigate the spleen spirit; offer above to Great Harmony; partake of the five fragrances; soul and embryo receive command; seven fluids flow and stop; hundred gates harmonize; five viscera shine; twin stars unite the lights; fly and ascend Shangqing.

After eating, gnash the teeth thrice again. This is called the method of the soul and embryo receiving fragrance, the hundred spirits partaking food. Those who constantly practise it will have spirits and brightness harmonious, souls and spirits at peace, will dispel evil and remove trials, and constantly preserve benefit and fluid. Never eat without praying first.

Whenever a Daoist faces a great banquet, he should rectify the heart and hold one thought, imagining first drinking and eating, then only begin to eat. After eating, he should softly pray:

> The hundred grains enter the stomach; join spirit and qi; fill and supplement the blood; corpse evil vanish and fall; fly up to the golden tower; longevity in heaven and earth; command the six Ding; spirit children attend and guard.

Finished. If constantly so, evil qi will withdraw; true qi will come forward; after eating, pray again.

---

### XIX. The Daoist’s Self Massage of Head and Face by the Supreme Yellow Essence

The essential matter of cultivation is first to make the eyes clear and ears acute, as they are the masters of the affairs. The ears and eyes are the ladder steps to seek truth, the gateways of the spirit’s gathering; they receive gain and loss, strike and stand, hold life and death, and distinguish all. The great talisman shown may be used.

Press with the hands behind the eyebrows small acupoints thirty-three times; then with palms and fingers rub below the eyes and on the upper cheekbones; then with the hand rotate the ear thirty times; next with the hand move backward over the forehead thirty-three times; beside the mouth swallow saliva innumerable times.

If constantly practised, the ears and eyes become clear and bright. Secretly perform in the middle of the person, and do not speak of its appearance. Next, with both hands hold the four sides of the head, smooth the hair towards the topknot; this is frequent motion. Thus the blood of the head flows and disperses; wind and dampness do not congeal. All completed, press the four corners of the eyes twice or nine times; induce the sight to see light clearly. This is the method of testing the eye spirit; constantly do it, and one will see myriad spirits.

---

### XX. The Daoist’s Method of Seeking Response before Transmission by the Supreme Yellow Essence

Whenever the highest methods are transmitted, the master of the scripture must first seek response, then transmit. Upon entering the room, burn incense, secretly wish the spirits and divinities, then bow the heart before the scripture, softly pray:

> Supreme Primordial Lord, great god of the immortal city, today is a lucky day; eight wishes open and display; desire to transmit the above method; dare to report to the spirit origin; unknown if allowable; must respond before declaring.

When finished praying, lie down to sleep; one will surely obtain spiritual response; the disciple will know the goodness or otherwise of his heart, and judge whether it is proper to transmit.

---

### XXI. The Jade Pure Prayer to Dispel Demons and Guard Spirits by the Jade Emperor

The Jade Emperor prays:

> The Nine Heavens have decrees; the upper command is Jade Pure; hasten to summon the thousand truths; all assemble in the imperial court; Taiyi watches below; twin sovereigns wing the form; inspect all evil; regulate qi and preserve life; if there is unluckiness; test the divine spirits; seek the Emperor’s Dao; order the divine soldiers; seven spirits wield the axe; celestial spear leads attack; wave sword in vanguard; brilliant cast fire bells; proclaim orders to the armoured horses; martial soldiers, heavenly Ding; wind and fire fight together; attack evil and suppress spirits; awe above the six heavens; subdue below the demons; awe and subdue; all evil destroyed; divine halberds sweep as lightning; no evil or affliction arises; the immortal emperor wields the scepter; commands that none dare stop; those who resist shall be punished; all warned and warned; preserve this Yellow Tranquillity; the Nine Heavens command; myriad spirits reverently hear.

Finished.

If the disciple walking by night feels fear and alarm, trembling of heart and faltering of mind, or meets evil dreams, when demons and ghosts test him, infringing on true vital qi, desiring to cause illness and harm, he should urgently perform the Jade Emperor’s prayer to expel ghosts and guard spirits. The disciple must hold steadfast to the supreme Dao, seek aid from Taiyi, then face north, gnash the teeth thirty times, hold breath and secretly pray; when finished, again gnash the teeth as above, swallow saliva ten times; thus wickedness and evil are destroyed, demons and pests subdued. The seven spirits entwine; Taiyi surveys and controls; myriad spirits guard the truth; externally awe the evil qi.

This may be recited daily, with vigorous sounds and chanting, sitting or lying as one pleases, to block the entry of all evil and to close the traces of wicked ghosts. At bed-time it may also be recited, causing the spirit to be tranquil and the mind clear, dispelling dreams and removing disgust, consuming all poison and evil, so as to be without fear for life. On days of recitation, one need no longer face north nor hold breath and pray secretly. The secret breath-holding is for when ghosts and demons have already tested the left and right, and affliction spirits have already infringed upon the spirit chamber; therefore, the spirits are ordered to collect their evil traces. The bedtime prayer is not the same as this method.

---

### XXII. The Method of Gnashing Teeth and Swallowing Saliva of Jade Pure to Govern and Control

All the methods of gnashing teeth and swallowing saliva in Shangqing have their own prescriptions and order; one must not confuse or jumble them, lest the true spirits be confounded. Gnashing teeth commands the spirits; swallowing qi harmonizes the truth; inhaling and swallowing the six fluids operates and controls the spirits; the sounding of the ritual drum must accompany the sequence.

When cultivating the highest method, at the time of rites and prayers, one must first gnash the teeth, up and down striking, not sideways. One breath and one swallow should be made to swallow all qi and fluids; this is called calling the spirits and harmonizing the truth, with the intent to ascend to immortality. The method of gnashing teeth up and down is called the Heavenly Drum; gnashing the left teeth is called the Heavenly Bell; gnashing the right teeth is called the Heavenly Chime. To control ghosts and summon demons, one may gnash the bell and chime; to practise the Dao and seek truth, one gnashes the Heavenly Drum.

---

### XXIII. The Prayer for Ear Ringing by the Supreme Yellow Essence Daoist

If one hears ringing in the ears, cross the hands to cover the ears, and pray:

> The infant is in the palace; the nine truths are in the chamber; all spirits obey commands; also observe unluckiness; Taiyi’s flowing fire; to extinguish myriad misfortunes.

Finished; then with the hand cover the ear gate seventeen times. When the face feels heat this is a good sign. If one hears coldness between head and neck, it is evil qi entering; one should quickly lie down and approach the eyes, hold the mysterious cinnabar palace of Taiyi True Lord; with the flowing fire bell shining, cast it forth to expel the evil qi immediately outside the ear; the fire light follows behind, shining brightly to illuminate the whole body, and after a while all is calm.

---

### XXIV. The Method to Discern Auspiciousness or Inauspiciousness of Ear Ringing by the Supreme Yellow Essence

If suddenly one hears the noise of rushing water, thunder, or drumbeats in the ear, it is bodily exhaustion; the heart storehouse is utterly damaged; unable to taste the true essence of life; reckless dissipation causing disorder; the six organs lose control; souls and spirits wail; it is a portent of disease and death. Therefore the mud pellet law is loosened; the nine palaces disorderly; sorrow and disturbance overturn and confuse; the drum sounds in disorderly progression; the soul is about to abandon its dwelling and forsake the body. Those who hear this should fix their minds on the great one true lord; return from delusion and concentrate the true heart; if the fault is not deep, one will hear and mend; thus deafness is caused by loss of ear spirit.

If suddenly one hears the sound of metal and jade in the ear, true qi has entered and the Dao is about to be accomplished. If one hears the sound of string music, the six Ding and jade maidens have come to guard the Dao. One should conceal oneself in quietness, diligently apply oneself to the practice; the more one strives, the more one advances; the true person will gradually manifest a form. Unless one is a master, do not speak to others.

If one hears the sound of flute and horn, it is an auspicious sign of noble arrival. If one hears shouting and crying, it is an inauspicious sign of lowly arrival. If one smells foulness, there must be a corpse or filth matter; one should quickly change clothes, bathe, burn incense, and sweep the chamber to respond; this is the imperial lord’s warning and exhortation to men.

If one hears the sound of blood or sees blood gathering without cause, it is the omen of violent soldiers and misfortune; one should quickly flee from the human world, guard the Three Primes and Imperial Lord, seek aid and conceal oneself, fast for three months, and the calamity will cease. These are all the imperial lord’s prior warnings of auspiciousness and inauspiciousness, to cause fear and sincerity about their good or evil fortune. When seeing inauspicious signs, one should practise hidden virtue and engage in benevolent aid, doing what men cannot do and travellers cannot do, in order to avoid the signs of certain death. You must strive in this, not simply keep the ordinary.

### XXV. The Method of the Golden and Jade Light in Applying Five Directions Talismans in the Fasting Hall

When the talisman writing is completed, face north, gnash the teeth thirty-six times, softly pray:

> The Nine Heavens have decrees; universally announce to myriad spirits; three dynasties succeed; five qi unite; the Jade Emperor rides forth; guides reins in the celestial court; applies the orthodox law; gathers demons and binds spirits; cuts and slays the original afflictions; myriad ways levelled; Dao flows to later learners; the imperial lord records names; summons the true into the deep; qi mingles without form; transforms lights and refines the Dao; ascends to the Three Pure Ones; obtains rapid flying carriage; ascends the Jade Court.

Finished. Attach the talisman to position; the true immortals immediately descend; the body is without harm; those who have not learned this Dao rarely escape losing their lives. This is called the wondrous method; without learning it, one cannot become immortal.

### XXVI. The Method of Daoist Breath Control and Thought Preservation of the Three Truths by the Golden and Jade Light

The Upper Yuan Palace mud pellet in the middle of the brain is the place; its spirit is the infant called the three origins’ ancestor, one named Zhongxuan born as Imperial Lord. The Middle Yuan Palace’s scarlet room at the centre is the place; its spirit is True Man called Zinan Dan, one named Zhongguang Jian. The Lower Yuan Danfield palace three cun below the navel is the place; its spirit is infant called Yuanyang Chang, one named Gu Xiaoxuan. These three are the one god; when one wishes to bind and control souls and spirits, first secretly call their names; hold the three spirits all jade-coloured with golden light, with the appearance of infants; the middle and upper two origins both wear red; the lower origin wears yellow; their heads like newborn infants. When practising the Dao and breath control, also hold their names.

### XXVII. The Seven Wounds Forbidden to the Immortal Record by the Seven Saints

Whenever a scholar’s immortal record is named, the body united with the immortal form, naturally conforming to the truth, then there are:

1. The first wound: bearing truth but acting falsely; lustful desires losing the spirit; soul and fluids leaking; essence and light drying; qi scattering; soul vanishing; bones hollow and form shaking; spirit weeping in desolate palaces; the upper hearing of heavenly gates; true immortals wandering afar; thus binding cause and effect with dust below, the earth palace concurred; how can one then attain immortality?

2. The second wound: the outer form in the Dao; skin good and thinking true; but the heart holds yin thieves; evil and fierce inside; wishing ruin to others; jealousy and envy; fair words yet rebellious heart; smiling face yet inner anger; judging form’s gain and loss; falsely manufacturing sources of sin; slandering fellow students; attacking the roots of teachers; recorded by the Three Officials as an evil gate; immortal truth departs; evil demons attack the form; running as shadow and shape; flying and dispersing body and spirit; thus causing crookedness and perversity; extremely evil cause; tested to ashes; destroyed in the nine springs; only possessing a mysterious name; how to keep naturalness?

3. The third wound: drinking wine to drunkenness; damaging qi and losing spirit; five organs attacked and broken; myriad gods frightened and alarmed; souls and spirits scattered; inside and outside decayed and wasted; the original chamber empty and desolate; infants wailing in sorrow; true immortals departed; evil demons enter the form. Such learning only wastes精诚, though with immortal record; empty losing the jade name; spirit ascending to upper palace; body ashes in dark shades; faintly seeking prolongation; years long stopped.

4. The fourth wound: conduct not extending to all things; blaming others and revering ancestors; angry heart and mouth; cursing and swearing unceasingly; anger and joy losing measure; temperament at variance and unsteady; qi agitated and spirit scattered; inner truth flying; souls departing and spirits wandering; the nine apertures dusty; five organs in mourning; all due to impure nature and unpropitious conduct; true immortals departed; external illness enters the form. Such learning, what can it veil? Though having mysterious charts, cannot avoid such disaster; hoping for immortality but day is long; hoping to live but days are many.

5. The fifth wound: sometimes showing mysterious charts and receiving precious scriptures; or encountering spiritual masters imparting divine texts; or not following the statutes and alliances; form leaks heavenly truth; without nine years; cast into sharp mountains; the Azure Palace has records; the Golden Tower compiles volumes; then transmitting to others; spreading in the world; lightly treating truth and leaking treasures; tested and bound self; only having mysterious name; instead accumulating seven mysteries; immortal way departs; body dies in dark springs; long filled with ghost reproaches; myriad kalpas without pardon.

6. The sixth wound: body lying in filth and decay; form and shadow not fragrant; inside no purity or void; outside no orchid fragrance; clear spirit lost immortality; spirit not dwelling in chamber; qi disturbed, essence mixed; spiritual origin loses light; five spirits scatter; infant flying high; evil demons come to attack; inside and outside lost; such learning, hoping to attain becomes injury; true immortals depart; empty shadow alone walks; sinks in the murk; immortality can it be veiled?

7. The seventh wound: eating all flesh containing life; killing the beauty of foot and mouth; foul qi fills the intestines; cutting life’s form from oneself; true qi disturbed at the spirit gate; wandering spirits frightened at the infant; souls and spirits roaming the palace and dwelling; filth and stagnation entwined in teeth and mouth; immortals ascend high to Jade Purity; self sinks deep in the earth; only possessing mysterious name in imperial registers; also cannot avoid certain death.

The High Sage Emperor Lord says: The foundation of learning the Dao is to urgently attend to these seven wounds. Once having seen and opened the cave gate, perusing the jade scripts, not violating the prohibitions of the seven wounds, one will await the spirit’s descent and ascend to immortality by daybreak. If external labour is in the study, but internal does not avoid the seven wounds, one will seek immortality and yet fail; hope to live but perish; hope for good fortune but meet misfortune; hope to fly but sink; the spirit immortal departs to the high clear; the five spirits scatter to the eight wildernesses; infants wail in the central home; wandering souls mourn in the mysterious void. Therefore immortal forms have success and failure; advanced students have seven wounds; who among the earnest and respected can keep their truth?

The tenth failure: do not face north to urinate or defecate; do not look up to the three lights; do not face north to cut hair or loosen clothes; do not face north to spit or curse; these violate and destroy the king. The breaking is the year’s lower branch Chen; the king is the place of royal qi.
