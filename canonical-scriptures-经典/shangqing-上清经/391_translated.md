The Supreme Scripture of the Inner Truth of the Golden Chamber for Delivering Life and Returning Years by the Three Radiant Treasures

The Supreme Celestial Administrator of the Southern Pole, the Supreme Immortal Lord, recorded: In the first year of the reign of the First Emperor, in the year of the Renwu, on the seventh day of the seventh month at midday, in the highest, most excellent Pure Land of Zen, the Boundless Longevity Heaven, the Jade Kingdom, beneath the Seven Treasures’ Cave, the Void Phoenix Capital, the Purple Terrace, and the Jade Forest, I dared to bow my head before the Jade Pavilion and respectfully asked the Jade Emperor, the Celestial Venerable Emperor of Emptiness: "Though I have inherited my imperial term, with my fate firmly rooted from former destinies, revolving through nine transformations, forming the womb of the Jade Marsh, the three cinnabar elixirs shine forth, the day auspiciously breaks and begins. I don the imperial robe by my own accord, longing for the nine mysteries, cultivating and researching the spiritual canon, pondering truth and meditating on the spirit, fasting long in the Jade Gate with no time wasted, through the years and kalpas, my name inscribed in the imperial records, my rank ascending to Supreme Director, supervising myriad immortals — yet I have not obtained the method of delivering life. As the fortune wheel turns and numbers reach their appointed time, which does not always last, I beseech you to bestow the treasured formula, to deliver later sages."

Then the Celestial Venerable Dao Lord said to the Supreme Celestial Administrator: "The formula of the Golden Chamber for Delivering Life and Returning Years is secret, residing in the Palace of Great Abundance above the Nine Heavens, in the Nine-Curved Chamber of the Golden Terrace and Jade Room, attended by three thousand Jade Maidens. This Way is profound and subtle, not to be approached by those of middling truth. The ancient method passes once in myriad kalpas. One who attains to act according to this method shares the same root as the Nine Vital Energies, harmonizing the three lights and the three radiances; Heaven and Earth endure forever. One practice of it connects the stomach and internal passages; ten practices bring clarity, speaking with the spirit; a hundred practices deliver life, internally transforming into the embryonic immortal; a thousand practices mount the void, flying upwards to the Pure Clarity; ten thousand practices complete the Way, attaining the rank of immortal official, riding the smoke and commanding the void, ascending to the realm of emperors. Now I reveal this to you; act with care." Then he appointed the Five Elders of the Immortal Capital, Supreme Directors of the Southern Prosperous Upper Palace, to record and supervise this, ordering the Supreme Immortal Sima Dingxian to deliver to you the "Golden Chamber Scripture for Delivering Life and Returning Years by the Three Radiant Treasures, Green Characters". An oath was sworn in the Boundless Longevity Heaven. In the first year of the Central Sovereign, it was transmitted through the Southern Pole, the Supreme Origin Lord, the Ten Thousand Beginnings Master, the Yellow Youth Supreme Truth, the Golden Flower Immortal, the Great Harmony Jade Maiden, the Great Simplicity Three Primal Lords, the Golden Gate Emperor, and the Upper Minister Azure Youth Lord. Now one copy is sealed within Mount Emei. Should there be a mysterious chart or imperial document, green characters of Supreme Clarity, golden bone and jade treasury, that person shall obtain this text. Yet the three paths move in cycles, the nine Yang energies respond in their appointed times, the True Original Sovereign shall practice the Way of Truth, holding the record of immortals, and be able to attain this scripture. Whoever obtains this treasured secret, let them not rashly proclaim it. Within the Spirit Capital Palace of the Great Emperor there are two hundred and forty thousand Supreme Immortal Lords, all casting golden slips, carving silver bindings, writing with purple pens, chanting in unison this scripture. The jade-like sound is clear and far-reaching, the voice displays through the Nine Heavens, communicating with spirits and summoning efficacy, reversing the flow of years, wandering and performing rites and chants, marvellously surpassing the Inner Truth. Thus it can deliver life; Heaven and Earth share the same root. Whoever attains this Way can become a Supreme Immortal.

This scripture is a sublime jade chapter, a spiritual composition of the Great Emperor, integrating one form and comprehending a hundred principles. Reciting it once, the wonderful principle is distinguished; reciting it ten times, one’s countenance returns to youthful appearance; reciting it a hundred times, internally transforming into the embryonic immortal; reciting it a thousand times, sitting or standing, death is extinguished; ten thousand times completes the Way, ascending at daybreak. Fasting long in solitude, unconcerned with dust and wind, the Way descends everywhere, counting days to ascend as an immortal. Should one be earnest but unable to escape the body, remaining among men, one may often retire to a separate chamber, cleanse with fasting and incense, worship morning and evening, and recite the spiritual chapter; one may obtain protection from disaster, repel myriad calamities, destruction ceases in the Upper Palace, sins are wiped out in the Nine Yin, accumulated responses over ten thousand times cause the body to ascend to the Cloud Chamber.

When practicing the Way of Delivering Life, one must on the day of one’s original fate and the day of the Grand Duke, as well as the days of the Jiazi and the Eight Seasonal Nodes, enter a chamber facing east, take in the Nine Swallows of Qi, hold the Great Emperor Lord in mind, and then bow twice; turn to face south, take in the Nine Swallows of Qi, hold the Supreme Celestial Lord of the Southern Pole in mind, and bow twice again; turn to face west, take in the Nine Swallows of Qi, hold the Three Heavens’ Lords of Longevity in mind, bow twice again; turn to face north, take in the Nine Swallows of Qi, hold the Most High Celestial Venerable Lord in mind, bow twice again. Or one may face entirely east, worship the four directions in mind, and take in the Qi accordingly. When finished, facing one’s original fate, knock the teeth thirty-six times, swallow the Qi thirty-six times stopping at the end. Then face the Grand Duke, draw in Qi twenty-four times swallowing and stopping. Return to face north and recite the scripture. Ten recitations constitute one cycle; upon completion, take one Golden Chamber Amulet of Life Protection for each cycle; ten recitations thus correspond to ten amulets, limited according to the cycle. This causes the spirit to communicate and effect truth, sitting one sees the eight directions, adjusting the hundred principles, step by step receiving spirits, all Qi returning in total; then one can long live, with life extending to Heaven and Earth, sharing the Three Lights of the same year. Holding the scripture facing north, knock the teeth thirty-six times, holding in mind the chamber contains five-coloured purple clouds covering the room, inside and out dim and obscure, and softly chant:

"Profound beyond profound, ninefold Qi, the highest Way gives birth to the Primordial Origin, three wheels of void are like jade, five revolutions deliver life clouds, return years within the nine sovereigns, ten thousand cycles of the Way then divide, the Great Desert is vast and boundless, the True Sovereign remains the One Emperor, mingling within the Golden Chamber, fetal breath pacifies the hundred gates."

Finished, then recite the scripture.

The Golden Chamber for Delivering Life and Returning Years by the Three Radiant Treasures, Green Characters, Inner Truth Supreme Scripture

Within the Golden Chamber dwells the True Man, transformed in the Jade Kingdom, born among the Treasured Neighbours; purple clouds swirl thickly in the nine mysteries, forming the jade terrace body by nature; jade towers and golden gates stand opposite each other; flowing clouds and vermilion skies wing the spiritual truth above; the vast green radiance shines over the central fields; above are the towering ninefold heavens, below the thousand fathom deep valley springs; gathering at the cave gate forming cloud roots, three thousand Jade Maidens and Immortal Boys attend, holding veils and incense, spreading purple smoke; hundreds and thousands are gathered immortals, arrayed in ritual robes reciting spiritual chapters, revolving the Golden Chamber to return years, the three radiant treasures shining clear and fresh; after ten recitations one cycle reaches the Primordial Origin, swallowing and swallowing the spiritual talisman then returning.

Calmly reflect on the five viscera, regulating the hundred gates, within each gate dwells a spirit: the Supreme Microcosm Little Boy faces the imperial truth, settling and guarding the root of the tongue and fluid source; the Supreme Unity plans the essential words of delivery, nearby filling the jade pillow under the mud pellet; the Emperor Lord oversees Yang and the sacred banner of fate, pacing between the middle of the eyebrows; the Original Heroic Prince is the firm spiritual immortal, born of the left armpit after the liver's rear gate; the Yang of the cave is the White Origin, filling the mud pellet right armpit with four members; the Central Registrar Elder Lord commands life, starting bright and holding the records to deliver fate; preserving the scarlet palace long remains; Peach Lord’s way is health, joining essence extended, equally filling the palace gates and spiritual roots; the Heavenly Emperor and Red Child, three primal ancestors, within the mud pellet’s nine apertures before; the Cinnabar Emperor moves the bead of scarlet palace spirit, filling the nape beside the great hammer; the Original King starts bright by nature, filling the four horizons linked to the mouth; the Eight Truths combined with the nine mysteries, below filling the backbone focused field; the Seven Truths of Profound Yang deliver life years, filling the jade pass between the right kidney; communicating spirit to deliver life, all fluid passages; the Six Truths of the Primordial Origin connect with purple smoke, filling inside and outside the head, entwined; the Five Truths nurture light according to the three primals, filling inside the throat holding the wondrous chapter; the Four Truths of Blue Clarity reverse the youthful countenance, filling the stomach tube with myriad spirits rejoicing; the Three Truths of Yellow Calm have colour like cinnabar, filling both nostrils through the secluded pass; the Two Truths of Firm Jade Qi and fragrant orchid fill the great granary without difficulty; the One Truth of Heavenly Spirit is tranquil and calm, filling the chest governing birth; all clad in embroidered robes and flying green skirts, to fill life seals closing death’s gate; carefully store and recite the spiritual script, ten readings make one cycle, dividing the meaning — not only to long live and ascend the nine mysteries.

The true mysteries of ninety-nine restrictions and controls fill the left ear with spirit and wisdom, secretly entering boundlessly over ten thousand miles, the palace dwelling the majestic seat of the Immortal Sovereign. Teaching life delivery with combined talismanic contracts, the imperial One Spirit’s soul returns above, filling the right ear with all myriad functions, hearing sound and distinguishing cries in subtlety; three combine into one, shining together. The Purple and White Sovereign called Yi Yu fills the forehead with radiant light, breathing the five mornings and swallowing sun and moon; spiritual fungus is abundant, with no hunger or thirst. The Yellow and White Sovereign called Yuan Hua fills chest and belly with bound clouds, controlling the Northern Emperor to check heavenly demons; the True and Genuine preserves the scarlet palace; the White and Pure Sovereign called Qi Ming fills the lower pass solidly with great spirit, connecting the nine apertures with fresh radiance; restraining soul and commanding spirit to preserve life; at noon the Registrar of Life called Jie Sheng fills the left hand with four great lights; five radiances preserve truth and set cloud encampments; praying upwards to sun and moon swallowing primordial essence, delivering life and returning years to exhaust heavenly lifespan. The Peach Lord of the Moon called Fang Ying fills the right hand, moving the Dipper stars, grasping the mysterious cord commanding the five spirits, traversing the four and seven restrictions of the heavenly court, cycling three times clearing the cave; the Left Eye Boy called Fei Ling fills the left eye with yang brightness, shining through the original end to see the jade clarity, splendid as heavenly might releasing streaming stars; the Right Eye Boy called Chen Ying fills the right eye with yin inner essence, observing the heavenly pass supervising the imperial court, brilliant as the three mornings riding the course of fate; the Lung Boy called Su Ming fills the lung gate inside and out with clarity, wandering soul and scattered spirit entrusted to Yellow Calm, supervising the imperial chamber without loss or gain; within the womb the One Origin is the Profound Child, the Supreme Unity of Essence and Spirit returning mysteriously; filling the five viscera and binding the throat, preserving spirit and solidifying Qi so as not to die; binding in the central Qi Lord’s case extending prosperity, no lord of essence spirit preserving the grain boy, filling the five viscera and great stomach palace, receiving and accepting fluid and infantile spirit, scarlet hero and jade fungus naturally filling, segmenting the black Qi producing splendor; the Emperor True Spirit called You Tai fills the nine intestines and governs the four boundaries, able to understand this truth and have endless longevity; the yellow Qi within the womb is the ancestral bright cart; together with the emperor they govern the chamber and dwelling; essence spirit governs and stores hidden writings; why not alone meditate on the profound void? Ten thousand times is sufficient to ascend the cloud chariot; the blood’s red Qi mixed with departing essence, the Registrar of Life’s essence spirit releases binding essence; two spirits together fill the hundred gates, harmonizing Qi and fluid to guard the form. To understand this Way fully is not to die, but to live ten thousand years and then begin. The Primordial Origin Father of the Upper Origin is the High Co-Birth, the Primordial Mother of the Lower Profundity is the Uncle Fire King, filling the womb beneath the Bright Hall, Supreme Unity governing the profound cord; the Imperial Venerable True Form is corresponding exactly; the Great Emperor’s essence spirit called Yang Tai, the eight voids return the Way with shining wings; the emperor’s soul is without flaw sharing one chamber, together filling the original fate’s Great Hidden Palace; seven spirits combined contract and operate the bright beam, delivering years and delivering life endlessly; the Three Primal Old Lords called Lao Zhang refine and transform the eight paths to deliver the great village; the Left Immortal Zhong Cheng governs the center; the Right Immortal Qu Wen faces beside; the three spirits combine in the human center; the mysterious One Lord Laozi dwells in the forest’s void spirit; the mysterious pass is rustling and cool; the Black Emperor preserves and completes filling the bladder; the White Emperor peaceful resting fills the scrotum; the Red Emperor awakening comes forth from the mouth’s square; the Blue Emperor carves the beams of the five viscera palaces; the five Emperors, two elders, and two immortal kings, guard and attend the destined body ascending the cloud cord; the imperial minister of the Upper Origin diligently begins essence in the scarlet palace; the spirit of the middle court returns to the bright above; the Three-One True Lord guards the destined form, each filling a palace with essence Qi, carefully preserving it to bring long life; not only not dying but ascending to Jade Clarity. The One Emperor True Lord’s father is the Peaceful Lord; mother is the Two Spirits waiting on destiny and order, filling the body’s interior death gate; arranged above and below in order serving one another, never departing palace gates called Ever Present; the destiny constantly recites this and sees the Red Child.

All myriad Qi mixed and joined form truth; each division of heavenly soldiers fills the destined body, carefully preserving it as one’s portion; fasting long accumulating response one sees the true man, granted the chapter of the Golden Chamber to return years; the record names the imperial register of former affinities, all by diligent longing, not by naturalness; ten recitations one cycle all spirits rejoice; within three years of the Way appearing one sees the purple chamber form and hears the destined words; descending brings the green canopy flying cloud pavilion, wandering and feasting over the Five Mountains, creating the imperial dawn, ascending to pay respect before the Great Void Jade Emperor, bowing and worshipping and receiving immortality again.

After reciting the scripture, one should store within the chamber spontaneous purple Qi, abundant and overlapping, entering the destined body through nose, mouth, and ears, feeling a slight heat in the body; the mouth leads thirty-nine swallows, softly chanting:

"All myriad Qi mixed to form the spirit abode, each filling chambers with clear and empty Qi; thirty-nine apertures eliminate death and fate, named in golden slips with green characters written; myriad blessings abound, spirits ascend the Golden Gate to mount the cloud chariot."

Whoever has a golden-named imperial slip or purple characters of Supreme Clarity, having received this scripture, all have formerly been outstanding immortals; the Azure Palace records their names, providing each Jade Boy and Jade Maiden thirty-six attendants, overseeing the imperial scripture, guarding the body of those who cultivate the Way. Those who practice this Way must not tread into filthiness, nor eat the five pungent and fishy odours, nor offend the hidden spirit, nor injure the true Qi, lest they be unable to enter immortality.
