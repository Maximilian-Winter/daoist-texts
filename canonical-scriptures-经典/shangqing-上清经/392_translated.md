The Scripture of the Three Primal Pearls Flowing of the Supreme Cavern of Reality

The Scripture of the Three Primal Pearls Flowing is the course of the Director of Destinies, whose way is subtle and great, and is the most honoured among the Five Classics. It is received by use of the white true pearls, perfectly round and bright, each as large as the fruit of the paulownia tree, numbering three hundred and sixty-five pieces, corresponding to the degrees of the stars and constellations, and to the conjunctions of sun and moon. Two silks, crimson and yellow, each twenty-four chi in length, are sworn to the yin and yang spirit officers, extending and flourishing the way of harmony; they represent twenty-four breaths, bind covenants in pure fasting, open declarations and hand over the charge. It is transmitted once in three hundred years, filling five transmissions and then ceasing, never to be issued again. This is the way of the Supreme Ultimate Officials and Lords in charge of destiny.

Among men, between the eyebrows and near the top, at one inch is the Bright Hall, at two inches the Cavern Chamber, at three inches the Elixir Field, at four inches the Flowing Pearl. Within the palace of the Flowing Pearl dwells the Lord Supreme Unity, seated on a precious bright throne, crowned with a purple cap, directing destiny coming and going, consulting and reporting the register of fate. If there is fault, life is cut short and death appointed; if merit, death is removed and life increased. The man who lives and lives again carefully follows this law, establishes merit without fault, and the Director of Destiny petitions the Lord Supreme Unity to add years and extend life. Though not attaining the marvel of the four palaces and single female, he truly reaches the height of the five organs and single male.

Whoever cultivates the Eight Scrolls of the Taiwei Yellow Writings, precise and efficacious, will behold the Flowing Pearls; if not, they sink through eight lifetimes, returning in toil with no way to ascend to the mystery. The secret of mysterious ascension lies in the Flowing Pearls; the pearls shine upon the upper palace, flowing light to the nine mansions, penetrating within and without, unobstructed and unconfined, roaming freely above the nine heavens, feasting in the midst of the Three Purities.

**The Nine Terrace Talisman**

The formula of the Perfected of Shangqing, Master Feng

The way of the student must begin by curing disease, not allowing the body to harbor emptiness and evil, nor blood to diminish nor brain to decline, nor fluids to become foul and stagnant. If this be not first cured, though taking food and circulating breath, it will not benefit the body. Formerly there was a Daoist named Wang Zhongfu, from youth he had an interest in matters of spirits and immortals, constantly practicing the method of inhaling the Three Luminaries and feeding on mist and clouds. For over forty years he perceived no benefit; his son also studied, practicing for eighteen years, when he ascended to heaven by day. Later the Perfected of Nanyue suddenly descended to Zhongfu and instructed him: "The reason you have not attained ascent is because your body is greatly diseased, your brain palace impaired, tendons and fluids not flowing, spirit fluids not overflowing. Though again you receive the feeding on mist and clouds, it does not benefit your body." Zhongfu then took medicine to heal his diseases, and also cultivated the practice; after another eighteen years he too ascended to heaven by day. He now dwells in the Mysterious Continent, receiving the title of Perfected of Zhongyue, supervising the Nine Mysteries, and remains in being.

The student of the Way must love breath and nourish spirit, taking food and curing disease, filling the brain palace, so that mysterious essence does not decline; then he may preserve spirit and serve the spirit, merely tasting and inhaling the Three Luminaries. If he often crosses and leaks, letting it escape and be discharged, then breath is foul and spirit lost, essence exhausted and withered. Though he again holds the mysterious jade tally or the golden book of the Supreme Ultimate, what profit will it be in regard to non-life? The former masters often warned me on this matter: The disciple, with one reception, wastes a year's strength of medicine; with two receptions, wastes two years' strength; after three times going, all the medicine strength wasted on the body is lost. Therefore the true immortals are always cautious about this, considering it a great taboo to life.

The student of the Way only desires to love breath and nourish spirit, closing breath to exhaustion, expelling breath to minuteness, and must not speak much, nor shout aloud, for this makes spirit toil and breath waste. To cultivate thus is not nourishing life. Whoever preserves spirit and breath and pursues true immortality must not borrow clothes or items from others, nor wear what is not their own; such as coarse cloth, hemp shoes and sandals, all demand freshness and wholesomeness. The three souls and seven spirits may dwell therein, even so the breath of the five spirits is always abhorred, because of contamination and pestilence. Also, on the days of the Eight Seasonal Festivals, one should fast and purify, plan good deeds, and apply oneself to the Way. Take heed not in these days to be angry, quarrelsome, joyful in anger, or to exercise severity and punishment; all these are abhorred by Heaven and men, and are grave crimes.

Whoever ponders deeply the supreme Way, and reads the sacred scriptures, in ten or twenty words should once or twice lick the lips and swallow saliva; in a hundred or fifty words should two or three times tap the teeth, thus summoning the spirit to meet the spirit, filling and harmonizing blood and breath, so that spirit fluids are full, and the imperial one rejoices in his abode — this is called the breath that does not toil, opening and not leaking. The student's method forbids tears and much spitting, for these all waste fluids and leak spirit, causing the brain to be greatly exhausted. Therefore the perfected Daoists constantly spit and breathe and swallow to harmonize the six fluids.

On the days of Jiayin and Gengshen, the corpses and ghosts contend in disorder, the spirit is restless and foul. It is not permitted to sit with one's spouse at the same table, nor to speak face to face. One must fast and not sleep, be alert on these days, and drive away all desires.

On the day of Wumao, one should always fast and enter the chamber, facing east with heart and bowing, preserving spirit and meditating on breath, seeking to feel the divine brightness, and all that is fitting to present. Those who constantly do so shall have the Jade Maiden descend to attend.

On the day of one's birth, facing that direction, one should tap the teeth three times, holding in heart the double bow, and softly recite the spell:

"Supreme Unity fills life, the Three Breaths unite truly, the embryo chamber above shines, mother mysterious, father primal, generating my five organs, gathering my spirits, pouring jade fluids below, greeting the clay pellet above, evening training the seven spirits, morning harmonizing the three souls, right command the jade flower, left whistle the golden dawn, commanding me a spirit immortal, employing spirits to serve truth, always preserving beneficial fluids, flying through the ten heavens."

When the spell is complete, again bow to the four directions, tap the teeth thrice, swallow saliva three times. This is called the Supreme Spell of Life Concealed, approaching the embryo primal way. Those who can constantly perform it shall have their soul and spirit preserved, living long in spirit immortality.

Whenever entering the chamber to burn incense, one should always face the seat, bow in heart, tap the teeth and intone the yin spell, presenting all fitting matters, keeping the essence concentrated, surely obtaining spiritual response.

Men always should remember and know their own form and likeness, and strive to imitate and present it before themselves, so that on the face there is always the light of sun and moon, illuminating a single form, the sun on the left, the moon on the right, nine inches from the face. When this is achieved, tap the teeth thrice, and softly recite the spell:

"Primal embryo supreme truth, double luminaries and two mysteries, right embracing seven spirits, left holding three souls, commanding my spirit brightness, with form always preserved."

When the spell is finished, tap the teeth three and seven times, swallow saliva seven times. This is called the way of the Emperor Lord recording the form, embracing soul and restraining spirit, making a man wise, a spirit immortal, long-lived and undying. If one cannot obtain the spell, one may simply preserve the form alone. Also, the student of the Way should first examine and control the soul and spirit, extinguishing corpses and ghosts.

Always on the days of the new and full moon, and on the days of Gengshen and Jiayin, one should fast and enter the chamber, bathe the dust and filth, set the seat right and sit. If able to forego sleep, it is all the better. With a true cinnabar brush, mark below the left inner eye corner; with a realcinnabar brush, mark below the right nostril, so that a small portion enters the valley. When marking is done, first tap the teeth thrice, softly recite the spell:

"The two luminaries fly entwined, vermilion and yellow disperse union, breath captures empty evil, corpse filth sinks and perishes, harmonizing soul and refining spirit, joining form and great spirit, making me undying, ten thousand lives and eternal preservation, wise and clear sight, long success and beneficial fluids."

When the spell is complete, again tap the teeth thrice, swallow saliva thrice, and with the right hand second finger pinch below the left eye corner seven times, and with the left hand second finger pinch below the right nostril seven times. Press down without lifting the hand. Thus all is done. These two places are the gates by which the seven spirits wander as corpses, the channels of remnant essence and thievish evil fluids. Therefore receiving cinnabar and realcinnabar essence blocks the way of the corpses and ghosts, the two luminaries’ burning and extinguishing the disordered breath. This is the Supreme Ultimate highest method; if always followed, it makes soul and spirit harmonious and gentle, corpse filth dispersed and cut off, living forever as a spirit immortal, communicating spirit and seeing clearly. Practicing it three years, colour and thought are all extinguished.

The methods of tapping teeth and swallowing saliva of Shangqing all have their places, order and sequence, and must not be confused or mingled, lest true spirits be confounded. The tapping of teeth commands the spirit, swallowing breath harmonizes truth, inhaling in harmony with the six fluids to move within. To control the spirit there must be drum beating and formation. In all the highest methods of cultivation, when performing rites and spells, first tap the teeth, upper and lower opposing, not left and right. One breath in and out, causing three taps, is good. After the rite and spell is finished, tap the teeth again before swallowing breath and fluids. This is called calling the spirit and harmonizing truth, to seek ascension to immortality. I have often seen false common people err in fixing the texts, mixing up order and sequence, rendering their use ineffective, which is truly to be lamented.
