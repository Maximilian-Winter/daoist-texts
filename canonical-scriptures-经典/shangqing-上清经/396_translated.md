I cherish the nine star Emperor Lords, concealed consorts of the Nine Yins, their forms, colours, and vestments all bright and clear, descending from the Northern Dipper, their fiery radiance flowing and shining, brilliantly lighting the void and non-being, revolving spirits mystically reflecting, entering my body, dwelling within the Bright Hall, in the purple chamber, flanked by the two images of sun and moon, the radiance of the nine mornings arranged in order, successively transforming into infants, the true forms of the Nine Emperors, named the Immutable Children, resting in the portentous body, thoroughly transparent within and without, fiery radiance mystically reflecting, circulating through the body with heat, again knocking my teeth nine times, and praying thus:

'Nine Mornings return to the summit, conceal and transform the primal square, penetrate the nine origins of Heaven, the true children in the Dipper, fiery radiance mystically reflecting, spreading through the purple chamber, changing a thousand and ten thousand times, altered light of infantile obscurity, going wherever the will directs, going out without coming in, obtaining the ride of the Eight Lights, ascending to pay homage to the Emperor Sovereign.' When ended, I swallow breath nine times, then stop.

This is the Upper Scripture of the Nine Yin Emperor Lords’ transformation of forms and concealment of light. The Central Yellow Lord, Southern Red Spirit Lord, Eastern Blue Youth Lord, Northern Supreme Lord, Western Great Essence Lord, all revolve the Nine Yin to scatter forms, move the Nine Mornings to conceal the body, cast flying wheels to ascend the void, ride the mysterious sky to roam and wander, manifesting myriad transformations of the light, following the world’s sinking and floating, as if moving portents, with the Three Lights resting simultaneously.
