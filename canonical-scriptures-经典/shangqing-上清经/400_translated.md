## Supreme Flight upon the Southern Dipper and the Great Microcosm Jade Scripture

The Southern ascent brings the True King of the Great Void, the Southern Mountain’s Red Lord, Songzi. When he studied the Way, he came riding at once upon dragon and phoenix chariots, to the jade and fine jade chambers within the Great Microcosm. He rested beneath vermilion light, seated in the shade of bitter woods, dissipating vital breath into the void, concealing spirit within nothingness, the profound essence not opening through the Way; he grasped firmly the firmament for us.  
The Upper Purity’s cinnabar bloom, the purple spirit True Maiden, shining with the radiance of the net around the heavens beyond the daylight clouds, she flew to ascend the jade warp, revolving upon the vermilion cord, summons the true of the cave yang, holds the handle of the Southern Star, roaming at ease within the Great Microcosm, resounding through the nine Purities. Clouds gather and lightning fills the body; united with the dim dark, looking down upon the world below.  
With the Red Lord’s golden countenance, pure and virtuous in conduct, his heart empty and free from dust, like the midnight moon, thoughts severed from karma, like a lotus in water.  
Below he instructs the Red Lord in the Way of the Highest Truth and the Supreme, the flying steps of the cinnabar heavens, treading the Southern Star and the Great Microcosm jade scripture.  
The Dao speaks of emptiness and cavity, planting roots on the border of being and nothingness; two luminaries suspend essence in the great void between; tendrils flourish at the poles; the red brilliance flows and manifests; the six stars adorn the heavens. Thus the great image has substance; the primal chaos issues forth, surely from the Southern Dipper, where it is fashioned and refined.  
Therefore the six directions form the enclosure, the six instruments form the tripod vessel; the two principles are water and fire; expansion and contraction are advance and retreat; the Great One oversees the furnace; the sovereign pushes the plan; the flying cinnabar lasts ninety million years; the three stars array their brilliance; the host of stars mark the order.  
Hence heaven is the canopy, earth the carriage, sun and moon the wheels, the four seasons the horses, the Southern Star the turban, the Northern Dipper the belt, establishing the imperial pole, producing all things. This is the subtle meaning of the Great Microcosm, the secret words of the High Truth.  
At Southern Prosperity’s cinnabar mound, the six stars are noble; those who tread upon them first know the true name, then don the true form; having trod their souls, next the spirits; then ascend the stars, going thrice around, the six stars reflecting their forms.  
Practising thus five years, one becomes a True of the Upper Purity; nine years brings the vision of the six truths, announcing the utmost sincerity, sharing kinship with fate. Fifteen years binding the vermilion net with the hands, seated to govern myriad spirits, riding six flying dragons to ascend to Jade Purity.

Another cinnabar inscription on blue silk, likewise six inches square, in brocade pouch carried before the heart; flying ascents and actions, all calamities resolved, wearing new and clean garments.

#### Names of the Souls of the Five Stars

- Jade Ring  
- Precious Pearl  
- Amber  
- Luminous Crystal  

The soul of the Five Stars rises from Jade Ring, stepping with both feet upon Luminous Crystal, going thrice back and forth. Preserving me to ascend the stars, five true persons appear, clad in vermilion robes, wearing jade crowns, their forms like infants, journeying with me. They droop their two hands, each twirling the tiger’s mouth with two fingers, knocking teeth five times, ascending and declaring:  

> Lofty and clear in the cave, southern soul of the Five Stars, revolving through the celestial threads, descending to the upper spirit, cinnabar robes and jade countenance harmonize with me in ascent, divine teachers and imperial friends, separation and union without form, sitting to command immortals and sages, the Great Pole and Great Purity, body flying with swift sound, the four and one unite in brightness.  

Stepping to encircle nine feet of blue earth, marking stars in blue, the cord in yellow.

#### Names of the Spirits of the Seven Stars

- Zha  
- Lou  
- Jian  
- Keng  
- Liu  
- Hao  
- Pu  

The spirit of the Seven Stars rises from Zha, stepping only to Pu, thrice back and forth. Preserving me to ascend the stars, seven jade maidens appear, wearing yellow robes, with precious hair buns, their forms like infants, walking with me. They raise both hands, twisting the root pattern of the three fingers with the thumb, knocking teeth seven times, ascending and declaring:  

> Circling vermilion threads through rosy clouds, conceiving light and cinnabar spirit, seven jade maidens fair, charming tendrils of heavenly essence, finely spun clouds scatter threads, yellow robes of the great god, sitting as divine grass and darkness, containing and leading the mists, with me the pivot of the Way, spirit hastening through dust, golden chariot and great carriage, dragon robes envelop the body, rightly sitting in the bright hall, guarding ranks of myriad spirits, upholding seven reflections, regulating the Jade Purity.  

Stepping to encircle nine feet of blue earth, marking stars in yellow, the cord in vermilion. At each step of soul and spirit, one star is invoked by name, preserving a deity, afterwards likewise. Incense is burned on left and right.  

The Way of the Six Stars of the Southern Dipper regulates the measure of steps. Every double-foot step should not reach the stars; it should follow the cord as a nail-thread, making the feet reach upon the stars. When double feet cannot reach the stars, the double feet again follow the cord, making only a single foot rest on the cord, which is acceptable. Single foot treading, double foot stepping, treading the cord; treading stars and cords in the void, the place of the immortal king.
