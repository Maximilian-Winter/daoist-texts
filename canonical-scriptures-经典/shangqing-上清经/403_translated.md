## The Mysterious Scripture of the Supreme Clarity Golden Cabinet and Jade Mirror for Cultivating Truth

The Supreme Tao Lord sat in the Jade Void of Supreme Clarity, in the Purple Cloud Forest of Dongxuan, together with the assembly of the celestial immortals and the true officials of the Three Realms. He spoke of this Scripture of Cultivating Truth and instructing on the profound mystery, and addressed the assembly of immortals, saying: The beings below do not know the right Way; they commit various sins and obstacles, sinking without limit. Those who commit sins know not how to cleanse themselves; those who cultivate themselves are entirely astray from the right Way. Thus the evil path overflows the roads, and the gate of life is closed. I now declare to you the essential words, piercing directly into the purpose of the Mysterious Origin, entrusting and transmitting them to the stream of clear faith; to cultivate the body and preserve life, to bring peace to the state and tranquility to the family; to accomplish deeds and fulfill the Way; to transcend the Three Realms, to raise up one’s ancestral root; to rejoice and prolong one’s descendants; these are the secret canonical and spiritual scripts, worthy of attentive hearing.

The Tao Lord said: Heaven and Earth are bound together; all things are transformed and refined. They inherit their past karma, and by causes and conditions meet in their turning. Father and mother unite, and man receives his life. The fetus is completed and the vital breath full; the spirit descends in the void. The Great One dwells in the brain, to rule the mud pellet. The officer of life dwells in the heart, to receive the source of life. On the left dwells the unsullied essence; on the right is the union of white origin. The Three Pure Ones and the Nine Palaces are all arranged in order. The liver houses the soul; the lungs the corporeal soul; the spleen the will; the kidneys the essence. The heart is master, hiding the spirit; the cinnabar origin guards the soul. The laws of heaven model the earth; bearing yin and embracing yang. They divide the five phases, to correspond with the four seasons. The eyes are the sun and moon; the hair the stars. The eyebrows are called the Flowery Canopy; the head is Kunlun. Each has its palace and gateway, to lodge and place the spirit. Among all things, man is the most precious and spiritual. Life is born of the Dao; nature receives from the One. When a thing is born, its spirit is pure and tranquil. When it is simple and scattered, it pursues falsehood and wastes the true. The impure, foul, and filthy disorder the form and spirit. In quiet contemplation upon self and things, what is distant and what is near? Guarding the Dao preserves life; doing good preserves truth. The fool is enslaved to things, and only suffers toil and pain. I spread the right teaching, exhorting the worthy and distinguished. Diligently seek the essential meaning, daily refining and timely cooking. Those who remove their sins and filth may extend their years. They ascend beyond the Three Realms, and are drawn up from the nether darkness. Reciting, holding, bowing, and remembering, there is no turning back the path ahead. When achievement is fulfilled and conduct accomplished, immortality will surely be attained.

The Tao says: The heart is the master of the form, the spirit is its dwelling place. The breath, liquid, blood, and essence, the heart is at peace and governs itself. If the government is dull, the people are simple; if the government is discerning, the people are cautious. The way to nourish the heart is to be careful in avoiding many affairs; pride must not grow; desire must not be followed; ambition must not be full; pleasure must not be extreme. The greatest sin is to be desirous; the greatest calamity is to not know sufficiency. If one can be content and stop greed, empty the heart and dismiss desires, then the true source is pure and clear, the spiritual light naturally shines, without thought or action, gradually uniting with the true Dao.

The Tao says: Breath carries the form; the form is filled by breath. When the form is complete, breath remains; when breath is harmonious, the form is preserved. Heaven and Earth use clarity and turbidity as substance; without breath, yin and yang cannot move. The sun and moon divide form by light and dark; without breath, soul and corporeal soul cannot meet. Many plants wither and perish; only the pine and cypress remain ever verdant, because their breath is firm. Fish perish in drought, and the dragon ceases; only the turtle and crane do not waste away, because their breath abides. The form is the dwelling that holds breath; breath is the talisman preserving the form. To retain the form and abide in the world, one must first nurture breath, to the utmost and strongest, filling the space between Heaven and Earth. Breath gathers the spiritual breath, roaming beyond wind and dust. Thus it is known that breath is within man; man is within breath; all things in Heaven and Earth are born from breath. Those who rightly nourish breath cultivate the body within and repel evil without. The common people use it daily without knowing it. To know and cultivate it, silently accomplishing it, it can rescue from hunger and cold, repel evil and pestilence, venomous insects and poisons; breath can forbid them. Among myriad methods and myriad guards, breath alone is the ancestor. The way to nurture breath lies in careful speech and regulated diet, restraining anger and closing desires, sealing its gateway, closing its door, continuing as if it were always present, using it without exertion. The way to nurture the form lies in blunting sharpness and harmonizing light, managing disorder before it arises, being tranquil without toil, toiling without lack of strength, quiet without wavering, wavering without disturbing the breath. There is supplementation without, benefit within; to nurture form and preserve breath, in this all is complete.

The Tao says: When form and breath are both established, one must preserve the spirit. The mechanism of creation and transformation lies herein. When essence is full, the spirit is king; when essence wastes, the spirit declines. Gather essence to preserve the spirit; employ the spirit to secure the form. The kidneys are the storehouse of essence; overuse exhausts it, so it is proper to be thrifty and sparing. The heart is the dwelling of spirit; overuse wearies it, so it is proper to be quiet and nourish it. Only by quietness and concentration can one guard within. Thus it is said: The truest of the supreme Way is profound and dark; the extreme of the supreme Way is dim and silent. No seeing, no hearing; embracing the spirit in stillness, the form will rectify itself. One must be still and pure, not weary the form, not shake the essence. Few selfishnesses and few desires, then one may live long.

The Tao says: The law is originally without law; principle returns to nature. The heart is disturbed by circumstance; the law is born from the heart. The meaning of establishing law is to restore what is lost and prevent what has not yet sprung. If one violates the Three Wonders, then first repair and treat; if the repair is complete, then one may advance in merit; if incomplete but proceeding, it is vain labour without benefit. The methods of repair are fully explained in the Primordial Unity; the methods of accomplishment are fully spoken in the Numinous Treasure. When previous merits are verified, one may advance to subsequent merit. When merit is full, truth is accomplished; high and low proceed accordingly. Without merit and conduct, demonic obstructions arise; with conduct and merit, immortals and sages raise themselves. Good merits perfected bring auspiciousness. Nature cultivates conduct, the bright differentiates rank. Those who seek celestial immortals must establish one thousand three hundred good deeds; those who seek earthly immortals, three hundred good deeds. The Dao thus advances; not the Dao, it retreats. Do not tread the evil path; do not deceive in the dark chamber; accumulate conduct and merit; have compassion for things; be loyal, filial, friendly, and harmonious; correct oneself and transform others; pity the orphan and protect the widow; respect the aged and cherish the young; insects, plants, and trees must not be harmed. Such are called good men; all men revere them; the heavenly Dao protects them; blessings and fortunes accompany them; all evils stay far; what they do surely succeeds; they may expect to become spirits and immortals.

The Tao says: Those who desire to cultivate the Dao must first cease and remove. Cease means that no thing arises; remove means that all conditions cease. Then collect the spirit, breath, and sea; conceal the breath in the cinnabar field; perfect nature and preserve truth; remain calm and settled. If thus for a long time, then one is self-complete.

The Primordial Heavenly Lord sat in quietude upon the empty mysterious throne, with thirty-six thousand spirits and consciousness all paying homage within the precious pearl. Thus the two lights combine with breath; spirits mingle in the cauldron of ten radiant flowers; man and woman incline their hearts, conjoin essence in the furnace of five breaths; thus transferring essence, the sound expands and breath changes; exhaling at the gate of the mysterious portal; concentrating breath and embracing spirit; refining in the vessels of male and female; naturally whitening and returning to black; teeth falling and renewed; returning to childhood and then infancy; long life and long vision; preserving whole life; to conform with the Dao; to be as firm as Heaven and Earth; enduring together for long ages.

The Tao says: The scholar of the Dao establishes virtue and merit; refines breath and sits forgetting; cultivates truth and wears the proper garments; declares the scriptures and expounds the teachings; assists the state and rules the people. Each of these is cultivation work. Though merit and conduct be complete, and deed perfect, still one must first deliver the Nine Mysterious and Seven Ancestral, the souls of parents and the dead, raise them to the heavens, and expunge the records of ghosts, then the body may obtain the Dao. How much more so ordinary worldly people, who commit evil and accumulate faults, bringing disaster upon their root ancestors! I now compassionately declare the essential words, to recommend and raise the dark souls; relying on merit and virtue. One may at the side of the Three Pure Ones’ images place the clothing and effigies of the deceased; according to law inscribe the Nine True Mysterious Seals; let the dead be rolled and carried; then with reverence recite this scripture and repent, thrice daily. If one cannot repent thus, daily recite with thought and remembrance the Compassionate Heavenly Lord of Sound, thrice a thousand times. When all repetitions are finished, perform nine bows and say: “May the soul and spirit of so-and-so quickly leave the nether darkness, ascend the heavenly realm.” The lightly guilty are delivered in three days; the heavily guilty, in nine days are transferred and elevated. Filial sons and daughters must be earnest and sincere, reverently honoring the saints.

Having completed the rites, one sincerely and respectfully extends repentance: The disciple and servant so-and-so, reflecting upon his errors in the human world, is humbled to encounter the true transformation, feeling the grace of Heaven and Earth’s coverage, bearing the virtue of sun and moon’s illumination; further reflecting upon the root ancestors, parents, and generation, their nurturing and raising, thinking of their great toil, sincerely should repay by recommending and raising them. Now before the holy truths, with a heart inclined and earnest prayer, I humbly beseech that the spirits of my countless ancestors and departed sins may all receive pardon; that they may see the suffering of sinking and drifting, all beseech freedom and ease, quickly release resentments and burdens, follow the light of wisdom to ascend and be delivered, swiftly reach the mysterious shore, receive the talismanic command to pay homage to the truth, forever leave the cycle of rebirth, be born in perpetual joy, with heavenly energy returning to the body, always under the shade of the Dao. I have no words to express the utmost sincerity of this prayer.

The Tao says: Pure faith men and women who recommend the dead and pray for the living, who seek blessings and remove calamities, must be strictly careful; with incense, bath, and fasting, concentrating the mind and heart; reverently reciting the true scriptures, praising the holy names; combining earnestness and sincerity, they certainly obtain response and connection; save and deliver living and dead; calamities are removed and blessings arrive. But if one is disrespectful and careless, with confused nature and doubting heart, indulging in rank smells, flesh, and colors, one cannot open the scripture; babbling and grinding lips, defiling the holy canon, all is vain and without benefit, and will instead bring disaster. Thus it is said: It is better to avoid sin than to cultivate blessings. If one can write and print this scripture, distribute it to scholars, let it be circulated and recited, the souls of the dead will be delivered, hell will be quiet, blessings and good fortune be the foundation, and the deliverance extend to future generations. If one has treasures, clothing, and abundant wealth usually given to the poor and cold, helping and relieving the needy, this merit is also like the foregoing. The black register is erased, the officials of the underworld remove the records; spirits ascend and contend for land; according to their wishes they are born again; benefiting and protecting descendants; cutting off disasters and sickness; great blessings and good fortune, hard to measure. Therefore one should diligently and reverently receive, declare, and recite; universally deliver without end; follow and observe the teaching; again respectfully worship all heavenly lords.

Having completed the rites, one sincerely and respectfully offers thanks: The disciple and servant so-and-so hears that in the course of practice, filial piety is foremost; in the teaching and law, fasting is the root. To repay the kindness of benevolent parents, one must consider the means of sacrifice to repay boundless grace. Thus one holds strict offerings. Generally in the human world all are pressed by fame and gain; once they hold plans of taking and giving, how can they avoid the blame of greed and ignorance? Thus the mission departs this world; the soul is lodged in the nine nether regions. Dare one rely on the cause of supreme goodness to raise and deliver from suffering? Thus the heart holds grief and earnestness, the will to recommend the departed. Declaring the spiritual chapter of the Golden Cabinet, looking up to pray to the true saints, reverently calling the exalted heavenly titles, humbly answering the root ancestors, I earnestly hope to receive this Dao’s power, to broadly deliver those sunk in misery, to destroy countless sins and grievances, to evenly open the long night, bestowing the great heavenly pardon, universally reaching all beings, countless ancestors, all obtaining fulfillment in flight and ascent; debts and repeated grievances all beseech to be granted transcendence. Yet I hope for the household’s elders and young, kin and relatives, to always enjoy blessings in prayer, to seek the protection of the Void and Nature’s shade. I, by original office, gaze to Heaven and look to the saints, with urgent and sincere service.

The Tao says: When the mysterious scripture is complete, it may be transmitted to teach the world, widely extending deliverance. At that time the assembly hearing this method will penetrate non-action, harmoniously attain the fruit of the Dao. The prisons of Feng in the underworld, the countless sinful souls, will all receive good merit and timely liberation. The celestial immortals and assembly will joyfully reverently serve, perform rites and then retire.
