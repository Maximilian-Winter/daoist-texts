# The True Text of the Nine Heavens and Eight Registers of the True Writ of the Yellow Scripture of the Cavern of Reality and Supreme Subtlety

Title of the Scripture: The True Text of the Nine Heavens and Eight Registers of the Yellow Scripture of the Cavern of Reality and Supreme Subtlety. Also called the "True Text of the Nine Heavens and Eight Registers Interlaced Writing." The author is unknown, but it is roughly dated to the Jin of the East and Southern Dynasties. Originally it forms one of the eight volumes of the "Yellow Scripture of the Cavern of Reality and Supreme Subtlety." It speaks of wearing talismans and observing true methods and arts. The original source is the "Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Tradition," in the Cavern of Reality section under the category of methods.

## The True Text of the Nine Heavens and Eight Registers of the Yellow Scripture of the Cavern of Reality and Supreme Subtlety

### The Interlaced Secret of the Mysterious Capital

The Supreme Subtlety Eight Assemblies Imperial Scripture opens with characters of the flying mysterious Purple Qi. By reciting its text one may bind all evil; by wearing its characters one may travel the nine heavens, wield authority over six kingdoms, and have myriad spirits attend and guard. Those predestined to receive this Way may journey upon the Five Sacred Mountains, enter the Three Pure Ones, and repel inauspiciousness. Within Supreme Subtlety reside Three Sovereigns and One Emperor. The Sovereigns are the sovereign’s chief ministers; the first is called Sovereign Lord, the second Sovereign Heaven, the third Sovereign Elder. These are the Qi of the Three Primordials, the true essence of chaos, entering and exiting the palaces of Supreme Clarity, Great Element, and Supreme Harmony. The Three Sovereigns of Celestial Reality conceal the writings of the Eight Assemblies in secret feathers; the Supreme Subtlety Heavenly Emperor conceals a unified tortoise mountain, engraved within the chamber of blue stone. The Immortal King of the Mysterious Capital once received this from the Three Elder Sovereigns of Supreme Subtlety, confided it in secrecy to immortals, and hence named it the "Interlaced True Text." All who have received this Way from the master pay five taels of gold, receive a ceremonial garment, bind a sash as a token of covenant, honour the Way, and keep the text secret.

The Western City Lord once received it from the Tortoise Mountain Queen Mother, hence named it the "Yellow Scripture of Supreme Subtlety," or sometimes the "Nine Heavens Eight Registers." Those who transmit it without authority cause the three ancestors’ corpses to be destroyed and bring calamity upon their descendants.

All who possess the Interlaced True Text, having received a living name within the Supreme Subtlety Palace, find the characters formed in all directions, both above and below, reversed and ordered. Entering the mountains, journeying the Five Sacred Mountains, and sleeping at night, one continually recites it in the mouth; wild beasts, evil spirits, and myriad devils dare not offend or try the person. Wearing it on the left elbow, one may travel the six kingdoms, govern the world, and repel myriad soldiers. The characters arranged in four directions and four movements form ordered rows; the ground is of blue silk, written with yellow brush. Wearing it on the left elbow, one shall see the Golden Gate Sovereign Lord of Great Peace. If one desires to command ghosts and spirits, one must first submit to the five characters, moving from above downward; after five years one may employ ghosts and spirits.

### The Eight Volumes of the Yellow Scripture of Supreme Subtlety

1. The Supreme Subtlety Heavenly Emperor bestows it to the Most High  
2. The Supreme Subtlety Eight Palaces Four Gates High Scripture  
3. The Supreme Subtlety Nine Spirits Zhonghua Purple Element Scripture  
4. The Supreme Subtlety Jade Void Precious Chapter Scripture  
5. The Supreme Subtlety Jade Chamber Precious Cloud Illumination  
6. The Supreme Subtlety Three Qi Nine Transformations Water and Fire Mother  
7. The Supreme Subtlety Central Spirit Five Ways Walking the Void in Flight  
8. The Supreme Subtlety Stone Scene Golden Sun Element Scripture  
9. The Supreme Subtlety Nine Heavens Eight Registers True Text Interlaced Writing  

Of these eight volumes of the Yellow Scripture of Supreme Subtlety, the first four do not circulate in the world; the fifth, sixth, and seventh are handed down to true persons; the eighth is this very text. It is to be transmitted only to those predestined who are trustworthy. Those who are not devoted to study in the distant past, nor lovers of immortality and belief in truth, must not transmit it rashly, for rash transmission causes the three ancestors to suffer punishment from the Water Official.

If the response is manifest, and transmission should be granted, it is to be entrusted along with essential words. Those who have it are divine immortals.

One must fast three days before receiving it. The recipient shall pay homage to the Supreme Subtlety Emperor nine times each year. Each time on the first day of the month, facing north within a quiet chamber, wearing fasting garments and a bound sash, performing four bows, and after bowing striking the teeth thrice, kneeling and praying:

> Supreme Subtlety Most High True, Heavenly Emperor Supreme Sovereign, your humble servant (name) entreats with words:  
> Supreme Sovereign Four Emperors, Lords of Fate Supreme Subtlety, Purple Mysterious Elixir Spirit, Sun and Moon shining together, Golden Essence Treasure Terror, Sovereign Heaven Eight Powers,  
> I pray for long life, for harmony with Heaven and Earth, for ghosts and spirits as servants, for gold and stone to open the way, to govern the six kingdoms, to restrain myriad soldiers, □□□□□□ thunderbolt,  
> To enjoy a life without end, blessings and felicity towering high, benefits issuing from purity, countenance light and flying, eyes bright and ears keen, body unimpaired, jade maidens attending, riding the radiance of Supreme Subtlety.  

Having finished, rise and bow twice more, then kneel.

Recite the Nine Characters, wear the talisman; naturally the characters of the four directions and eight lines will be unlocked, later extending to the sounds of the thirty-six kingdoms.

The Yellow Emperor obtained this text, dominated the world, commanded myriad soldiers, and employed ghosts and spirits, naturally becoming divine, wise, and sage. He Yu received these three lines, and thereby commanded ghosts and spirits; Du You and Fei Ci obtained thirteen lines, commanding the spirits of the world; Xu Guang received five lines, wore them three years, commanded fourteen ghosts, and obtained all things in the world. A true person in the Red City Mountains taught Xu Yuan to journey afar; Xu Yuan handed down to disciples Si Xuan and his second son Dao Xiang.
