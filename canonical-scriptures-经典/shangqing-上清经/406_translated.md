The Cavern of Truth, Most High, Primordial Jade Register

The Primordial Jade Register is the work cultivated by the Jade Morning Lord, a secret taught by the divine envoys of the Five Emperors at the Upper Palace of the Primordial Spirit, in the Chamber of Great Abundance. Those who obtain it may fly through the vast expanse of Heaven, able to conceal and to vanish at will, and are each granted two jade youths and two jade maidens. Secret cultivation brings sure efficacy; leak it and disaster will ensue. One must be most careful and diligent, and faithfully recall the master's words.

The Primordial Lord is the original accomplished Laozi, the soul of Heaven; his governance is within the midst of Great Clarity, in the central stanza; he constantly attends the Emperor Lord, presiding over the true primal qi, styled the Primordial Lord, who stands opposite the Lord of Great Harmony. The Lord of Great Harmony is the august accomplished Laozi, the corporeal spirit of Heaven, presiding over the qi of the fetal origin. The Primordial Lord guards the left and right; the Lord of Great Harmony always accompanies in coming and going. When the Heavenly Emperor enters the Purple Tenuity, he is at Kunlun’s Yellow Gate in the Purple Chamber, the seat of the Lord of Supreme Oneness. The Three Lords and Three Qi were originally one source of primeval chaos, the root of transformation, with Heaven and Earth forming four, and the myriad beings five. He who preserves the five is in accord with the Dao and with the True.

Regularly, on the second and third days of the month, at midnight in the hour of the Rat, lie down at ease, close the eyes, and preserve the vital body’s head in the Great Clarity, Supreme Ultimate Palace before the Emperor Lord. Next, think upon the left eye the Primordial Lord, clothed in azure garments, crowned with nine blossoms; the left hand holds the azure Ganoderma, the right hand the azure banner. Then think upon the right eye the Lord of Great Harmony, clad in white robes, crowned with five blossoms; left hand holds golden liquid and jade nectar, right hand bears a white banner, standing at the Emperor Lord’s side. The Supreme Ultimate has nine names: First, Great Clarity; second, Supreme Ultimate; third, Great Subtlety; fourth, Purple Chamber; fifth, Mysterious Chamber; sixth, Emperor Hall; seventh, Heavenly Treasury; eighth, Imperial Office; ninth, Celestial Capital, Mysterious Metropolis. To put it briefly, from the crown of the head straight down one inch is the Supreme Ultimate Palace, one square inch only, situated above the Six Harmonies official. The Six Harmonies Palace is the abiding place of the divine sovereign of Supreme Oneness.

Always preserve the Three Truths in completion, and also preserve my soul in likeness of myself, ascending into the Supreme Ultimate Palace. The two elders then bestow the azure Ganoderma and golden nectar, bidding me to partake; I eat the Ganoderma, which resembles the lotus flower, and drink the nectar, like fine wine. When the food and drink are complete, I prostrate twice before the Emperor Lord, and say: "Today I come to petition. The Emperor Lord is in the court, granting the divine Ganoderma and golden liquid jade nectar. The two elders measure the register, Supreme Oneness submits the memorial, for long life and enduring vision, with lifespan unending." The Emperor replies: "Fortunate indeed! Come again on the second and third days of the month." When finished, lie down again; long life without death, prolonged then to become a god-immortal.

Supreme Oneness is the essence of the fetal body, the lord of transformation; the soul and corporeal spirit are born of the fetal divinity, summoned by the yang to be established. Leak the secrets and fail to observe the rules, and calamity will descend upon seven generations; can one not be cautious? Can one not be cautious?

To wear the talisman of the Eastern Peak is to open the divine script of Shangqing, the cloud chariot welcomes the adept, foreknowing all affairs. The Five Peaks share the same method, beginning with the Eastern Peak, and then by turns wearing them. And the eighteen visiting talismanic seals, all written in purple silk, originally kept in tubes, are offered in the first month at the sacred mountains; after the offering, they are placed between great stones, so that none may know. Use seven sheng of yellow earth to make clay; on the clay place the talisman, and then recite the invocation:

"Wearing the jade talisman of Great Subtlety, Stone Scenery, and Yellow Script, now faithfully write one scroll, to return to the Immortal Lord, so that I may ascend the void, harness the primal chariot of clouds, be attended by immortal spirits and guards, and be united with the True." Finished. The Five Peaks all follow this method, thus the texts of the sacred mountains and stone chambers of the immortals are revealed to the adept; the divine Ganoderma and wondrous herbs appear naturally.

If one would make the Golden Yang talisman, burn the characters with the seal; wear the seal and burn it and swallow it; suddenly one gains divine power. The method for wearing the seal is to write it in ink, swallow one seal at a time as a measure, and use the seal to close the talisman. When the seal is complete, the adept first eats and wears it; when the talisman enters, one will sense cold and heat, and the vision will become clearer. In a moment, a white-robed jade youth, or a scholar, will appear before the adept, standing upright; do not be alarmed, it will vanish shortly. Preserve it for thirty days; the body naturally becomes light and agile. The superior adept may soar into the pure void and roam the Shangqing; the middling adept may raise his form a hundred zhang; the inferior adept ten zhang.

When the adept wears the eighteen talismans, one always sees the white-robed person; this is proof of the adept’s sincerity and steadfastness, as the jade youths and maidens guard and manifest the true form. Before wearing the talisman, first abstain from the five incense sacrifices, blood foods, and the chamber of union; do not tread on filth for a hundred days; dwell in a secluded chamber where no one enters; avoid noisy association with the vulgar. Thus the Dao will be accomplished.

Those who wear the Stone-Scenery Golden Yang talisman especially forbid unclean, careless, or evil conduct; one must cultivate the person and think of the Dao, fasting, stillness, concentration, and single-mindedness first. Those who can cultivate this Dao may ascend to immortality and become friends with the Celestial Truth, communicating with the host of immortals, calling forth divine spirits, summoning golden elixirs and Ganoderma herbs. Sitting, one may manifest the traveling kitchen, dragon chariot, feathered canopy; spirit youths and maidens and all the myriad essences of the world come swiftly to serve; nothing is unknown, nothing sought is unattained.

The separate talismans of Heaven and Earth may repel armies for ten thousand li; those who conspire against the adept will suffer their own disasters; when five armies are raised against him, they will return to harm themselves. Also, the spirit jade horse talisman is the sacred script upon the person, enabling flight through the empty realm, free and unimpeded in travel; evildoers dare not approach; a host of spirits reverently protect; the pattern is complete, the secret is in the mouth. The master examines the person, granting or withholding as befits.

The Mysterious Capital Bound Bindings, Cavern of Truth Secret Script, Stone Spirit Jade Contracts

The Supreme Realized Person, the Later Sage Sovereign, received the Supreme Hidden Writings, the Steps of Heaven’s Rope, and the Record of Flight, entrusted to the Azure Youth Lords; the Lords transmitted them to Lord Wang, to confer upon those who are resolute and pure of heart, recording in the bone register those who are to become immortals. Lord Wang, in the eleventh year of Yonghe of Jin, the year of Yimao, on the ninth day of the seventh month, at Linhai’s Red King, conferred upon Xu Yuanyou.

Fasting and purification, capital dragon and jade fish; ascending the altar to swear the oath, dividing the broken contracts; cultivating for seven years, riding the void into non-being; divine transformation without bounds, acting at will — this is the practice of the Dao.

The orb unites the radiance, the green cloak resembles the sun; the returning clouds shine brightly; the red youth holds the spirit; the mysterious flame scatters light; the whirlwind shapes the pure and verdant. This is the power of the day, the accomplishment of the spirit.

True script of sixteen characters, the Golden Gate Sage Lord gathers the root of flight to ascend the Way; the Supreme Origin Realized Person received it from the Great Subtle Heavenly Emperor; another name is the Scripture of Golden Essence, Stone Scenery, and Water Mother — it is the hidden characters of the Five Emperors at midday, the eight primordial interwoven true scripts, altogether two hundred characters. These are the secret names of the Nine Heavens Kings and the True Gods of the Five Directions. Those who wear this script receive the characters of the Five Emperors at midday, seal their characters, and wear it on the left elbow; naturally, they become intelligent and wise, understanding the affairs of the five directions, roaming the Five Mountains, sealing mountains and summoning seas, commanding ten thousand troops, controlling ghosts and spirits, Heavenly spirits and Earthly deities, jade youths and maidens attending; all tests shall not injure, the path to immortality is completed. This must not be transmitted in the world. When a resolute Daoist meets a true master, the recipient ascends the altar and swears the unbreaking oath by golden dragon and jade fish. The master then takes the golden dragon and jade fish, writes them in yellow on a blue ground, and bestows them.
