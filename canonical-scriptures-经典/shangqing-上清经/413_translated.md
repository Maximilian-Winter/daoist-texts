## Hymns and Eulogies of the Perfected of Shangqing

### Hymn of the Three Contracts of Walking Emptiness in Shangqing

Without beginning, the cavernous void is boundless;  
Three black essences at the upper gate.  
Purple wings gleam in the vast void,  
Four lights establish the root of spirit.

Wondrous transformation issues from the eastern jade,  
Three conveniences open the western Kun.  
Brightly shining the nine mysterious essences,  
Five flowers girdled with brocade clouds.

The net of departure illumines the divine lamp,  
Seven stars radiate the northern origin.  
Fluttering upward to the realm of law,  
Wings spread wide, the One Sovereign of the Emperor.

Lofty and noble is the supreme hymn,  
Youthful attendants flutter in confusion.  
The flowing fragrance is originally without colour,  
It penetrates the myriad immortal assemblies.

Left revolves the three-stream kalpa,  
Right turns the gate of myriad arrows.  
Cloud-hued tassels of five clouds,  
Eight phoenixes dance the wheel of the void.

The four seasons know no pause,  
Blue and white early separate brightness.  
Ninety-nine change the kalpa’s fate,  
Three threes complete a single event.

Heaven and earth have their final meeting,  
Decline and rise return to the banner.  
Profound clarity in the orthodox One law,  
Strictly ending the six heavenly patterns.

Great peace reverses the void,  
Serving and supporting the later holy lord.  
Spirit wind rises at the western gate,  
Brocade clouds arise from the eastern jade.

Two energies shine on the jade isles,  
Flowing fragrance rides the light smoke.  
Five flowers spread and scatter in the wind,  
Suddenly brightening the nine clarities.

The lofty forest shines with the vermilion sun,  
Yellow flowers follow the moon in birth.  
Within is a gathering of spirit-picking youths,  
Clothed in feathers girded with flying blue.

Scenery of myriad mountain peaks,  
At ease feasting in the green pavilion.  
Mastering the nine void transports,  
Motion opens with no known course.

Left commands the three heavenly patterns,  
Right controls the six heavenly troops.  
Examining energy and the cavernous void,  
Heaven’s measure responds as fate inclines.

The kalpa’s fate has its own meeting,  
Who can side with failure or success?  
The great waves drown the cloud cords,  
The six directions leave no form behind.

White corpses drift in a long stream,  
Lonely souls again become scattered.  
Sorrowing at this interchange of departure and return,  
One then perceives the brightness of the orthodox law.

At supreme learning add refined practice,  
Eastern flowers bind the jade fame.  
Joyfully there are persons of white simplicity,  
Together they delight in great peace.

The cavernous palace directs heaven’s cords,  
The kingly qi turns the three subtleties.  
Purple gates issue jade tablets,  
Golden portals receive the divine radiance.

Eight meetings interweave true winds,  
Brilliantly open the heavy darkness.  
At heaven’s border beyond the nine clarities,  
Lofty and noble the morning returns.

Three colours return to void,  
Four seasons respond to the jade domain.  
The river awaits as the brush beats,  
The five phases secretly push each other.

Six degrees know no final kalpa,  
Fate reaches its limit and returns with the qi.  
Ten thousand demons array the heavenly net,  
The fierce bandits compete to display their might.

The multitudes bear disaster and conflict,  
Accumulated corpses evoke sorrow.  
Wondrous indeed is the orthodox text,  
Treading the kalpa’s path clearly without decline.

At the appointed time mutually attend and receive,  
The contract lies at the nine heavens’ gates.  
With you I vow for great peace,  
Release the body and fly without wings.

### Hymn of Whirling Motion of Shangqing

The Great Way is cavernous and mysterious in its subtlety,  
The high void encompasses the three wheels.  
Golden immortals unlock the spirit’s gate,  
Radiant as the division of the nine heavens.

The great flower scatters in the purple void,  
Eight perfected beings reflect the pure clouds.  
The Mysterious Mother forms the supreme vow,  
The simplified writings of the eight gates.

Ten thousand celebrations mingle in spiritual meetings,  
Raising smoke to chant the lower origin.  
Wondrous recitations move the subtle void,  
Hence they gain the bonds of the exalted immortal assembly.

Whirling motion bows in the cavernous void,  
Bowing the head to greet the emperor lord.

### Verses of Wisdom on Joy and Sorrow in Walking Emptiness

Bind my natural qi, condensing and transforming the purple phoenix city.  
High terraces surpass the nine ridges,  
Lofty and glistening forming flying jade.

Brilliantly descending to the great void above,  
Twisting and turning penetrate the eight clarities.  
Purple canopies shine over the cloud palace,  
Flowing radiance veils the five spirits.

Four directions reach the boundless wilds,  
Eight energies revolve in perfect brightness.  
Supporting the soaring motion of the great void,  
Seven scenes turn the heavenly scripture.

Motion comes as if without form,  
Time departs following transformation’s inclining.  
Nine circles intersect within the degrees,  
Two images mutually contest.

The One Emperor is firmly the central origin,  
Four cords unshaken and spiritual.  
The south gathers flying imperial treasures,  
The north arrays the vast cold court.

The mysterious chamber joins the true assembly,  
Void songs arise naturally.  
The five emperors command spirit banners,  
Demonic flags conquer myriad essences.

Demons howl in the void above,  
The Way’s world’s joy is unending.  
Therefore arise the curved simple words,  
To celebrate the gods and rejoice in great peace.

Together agreeing on what place?  
Ten thousand kalpas are but one lifespan.  
Turning and returning through ninety thousand kalpas,  
Together roaming the purple phoenix pavilion.

Void gives rise to the purple phoenix platform,  
The jade palace participates in the supreme subtlety.  
Spirit winds penetrate the eight meetings,  
Northern windows of the palace gates open.

Above are howling singing youths,  
Constantly chanting the decline of fate.  
At morning they ride the scene in roaming,  
At evening they attach and return with the scene.

Two scenes united as one body,  
Always fearing to lose the scene’s radiance.  
Nine vital airs do not always dwell,  
Heaven and earth face peril and danger.

The great kalpa ends a single event,  
One hundred and sixty cycles of fate return.  
Great springs surge up the nine ridges,  
The great crow soars and hangs in the sky.

Myriads drift in a long stream,  
Looking back no mountain to depend upon.  
Weeping aloud with no limit,  
How can it not wound the human heart?

The worthy sages diligently recite scriptures,  
Therefore they gain the power to ride the scenes and fly.  
At the appointed time mutually attend and receive,  
Together they meet the gates of the nine heavens.

The numbers end the golden horse days,  
Ten thousand calamities intersect and race.  
No sight of those who study immortality,  
Only able to weep for the corpses and mourn.

Alas this ignorant man’s nature,  
Holding fate with painful sorrow.

Disperse sorrow on the nine mysterious platforms,  
Gather joy together with the great void.  
Carrying the contract of the ten perfect beings,  
Howling fate with the eastern sea youths.

Four directions reach the eight meeting energies,  
Mysterious motion of the Lang terrace winds.  
The sun shines on the western flower hall,  
Intent joins the vast cold void.

Graceful beneath the purple phoenix,  
Desolate the nine ridges’ peaks.  
Glancing over the boundless wilds,  
Looking up at the kalpa’s immense height.

Clear singing in the tones of palace and merchant,  
Joy and sorrow follow each other.  
Two courses harmonize in one contract,  
Reason contrary yet returns the same.

Together delighting in endless joy,  
Holding the beginning and again the end.  
Drinking deeply the jade pool’s sweet wine,  
Raising the cup to drink the flying splendid emperor.

Spirit melons themselves suitable for feasting,  
Taste like the brightness of sun and moon.  
Seven luminaries flow their fragrant radiance,  
Such joy can it be forgotten?

The great kalpa has a final fate,  
Fate intersects and the two images incline.  
Dragon gate cuts the heavenly river,  
Three and five oppose and contend.

The red town occupies the eastern well,  
The floral canopy covers the morning star.  
Mysterious radiance dims the eight wildernesses,  
Foul qi obscures the heavenly essence.

Three officials urge and hasten,  
The five mountains are not stable in spirit.  
Ten thousand diseases run rampant,  
The northern emperor commands brave demon troops.

The eight cords gird the heavens outside,  
Only the holy lord can purge them.  
This binds the natural qi,  
Lofty and steep is the ninefold city.

High observance pities the myriad multitudes,  
Joy and sorrow arise from this.  
Mysterious songs scatter the spirit robes,  
Covered in joy yet tears flow.

Pity these stubborn fellows,  
Stingy with wealth, greedy for colour and fame.  
Joyfully awaiting fate’s arrival,  
Unmindful of disaster they bring upon themselves.

Worthy and wise come from the contrary direction,  
Morning and night diligently reciting scriptures.  
Rituals of void mind contemplations of mystery,  
To transcend the endless lifespan.

If able to seek the source of the Way,  
The eight festivals play the jade name.  
Will avoid the calamities of the nine luminaries,  
Allowing you to see great peace.

Jade phoenix lectures the morning breeze,  
Purple terrace shines on the jade forest.  
Flowing light brushes the profound mystery,  
Lofty and rugged the nine yin hills.

Purple radiance scatters vermilion clouds,  
Flying smoke seeks each other.  
Seven treasures vibrate jade branches,  
Spirit beasts gallop on cloud heights.

Myriad immortals ride the void and chant,  
Divine wind raises wondrous sounds.  
Above is the high morning master,  
Quietly bowing, howling and chanting.

Eight meetings naturally appear,  
Void descends all orchid and gold.  
Jade masticates the kalpa’s dawn,  
Jade nectar scatters in the impetuous heart.

Bright pearls sing spirit songs,  
Law’s form harmonizes the clear zither.  
Jade tablets reach the ultimate Way sect,  
Joy and sorrow dissolve the human robe.

Purple canopy shines over the cloud palace,  
Flowing radiance veils the five spirits.  
Four directions reach the boundless wilds,  
Eight energies revolve in perfect brightness.

Jade tablets reach the ultimate Way sect,  
Joy and sorrow dissolve the human robe.

Release me from endless lifespan,  
Good joy and sorrow how deep.  
Natural lofty immortal rhythm,  
How can it be alike this reverence?

Morning play in the Eastern Flower Palace,  
Evening wander in the Western Flower Hall.  
Taking pleasure in the two flower halls,  
Never meeting joy together.

Only heard the mysterious songsters,  
Sad voices injuring heavenly youths.  
Mournful sounds flow in the cold court,  
Caressing and lamenting the world’s end.

Heavenly horses leap the nine rivers,  
Black mother rides the flying dragon.  
Mysterious ford has no bridge or beam,  
Two energies divided and not connected.

Ascend my lofty platform,  
Look up at the nine difficulties.  
Foul qi fills the three spirits,  
Myriad multitudes bear disaster and conflict.

Eight regions leave no people,  
Great and small mountains collapse.  
Thinking on this without learning,  
Hearing scriptures as if foolish and deaf.

Together yielding to fate’s birth,  
Swiftly attaining life’s end.  
Alas how cruel is this fate,  
Thinking of you wounds my breast.

Purple phoenix rides the void and issues forth,  
Lofty and steep the nine mysterious heights.  
Energy condenses and the scene appears,  
Energy disperses and the spirit vanishes.

Fluttering without boundary,  
Heavenly music suits my delight.  
How can it be equal to the eight meetings’ chants,  
Matching my exalted immortal companions?

Carrying the contract of the ten perfect beings,  
Feasting in my nine phoenix bodies.  
Ascending the jade capital palace,  
Descending to play on Langfeng isles.

Feather steeds swiftly ride the jade transports,  
Purple smoke in the void supports each other.  
At utmost dawn awaiting morning,  
Together delighting without end of sorrow.

Glancing at fate’s movement,  
A myriad events make a single round.  
Joy is my natural spirit,  
Scattering my mind’s worldly sorrow.

Without the mysterious spiritual treasure,  
Who can roam thus together?  
Alas within the cavernous void,  
Arising joy again brings forth sorrow.

At dawn depart from Eastern Meng ridge,  
At evening view Western Dragon hill.  
No sight of the nine spirit mothers,  
Northern true Way companions roam.

Ask about the great image’s degree,  
Two energies suddenly cloud around.  
Nine dragons move the eastern well,  
Heavenly horses issue forth from western heights.

Northern emperor releases heavenly troops,  
Five mountains mysteriously harmonize.  
Ten thousand demons already bound,  
Five phases early plotting together.

Warfare and disaster spread the heavenly net,  
Myriad multitudes already imprisoned.  
Above and below all receive the meeting,  
Sweeping away without delay or pause.

Sorrow in these five difficulties,  
Fate comes without kinship or estrangement.  
High ascending the eight meeting palaces,  
Binding my companions in the dark.

Observe those who attain supreme learning,  
Blessed lands mutually support.  
Abandoning home to seek my way,  
Able to transcend and save your body.

Diligent heart cultivates the supreme scripture,  
When the Way is complete aid each other.  
At ease viewing the phoenix platform,  
Is it not a joyful roaming?

Great joy gathers the central origin,  
The central origin assembles the joyous court.  
Above is the eight meeting energy,  
Graceful purple phoenix arises.

Golden branches attach to jade roots,  
Seven treasures form splendid bells.  
Dragons soar over extreme peaks,  
Phoenix cries startle myriad courses.

No sight of departing guests,  
Only hear the phoenix cloud sounds.  
Palace and merchant tones harmonize,  
Sound and echo naturally arise.

Mysterious songs sing wondrous melodies,  
Joy and sorrow form harmonious sounds.  
I and you seek each other,  
Who understands the perfected spirit?

Brocade clouds gird the night moon,  
Purple brilliance veils the flying jade.  
Three morns reveal great brightness,  
Seven origins shine with five stars.

Spirit banners possess mighty light,  
Flowing smoke veils purple clarity.  
Claiming the western flower’s wonder,  
Not as great as the purple phoenix city.

Above is the loosened robe person,  
One face rejoices ten thousand ages.  
Together delighting without end kalpa,  
Thus perceiving heaven and earth tilting.

Spirit motion has its own end,  
Numbers conclude and return to mystery.  
Departure and return follow fate’s course,  
Why then worry and entangle oneself?

Disperse sorrow beyond the eight wildernesses,  
Great image not obstructed in truth.  
At ease in the joyful court,  
Who with sorrow would be kin?

The five difficulties are common meetings,  
Those hurt have their own persons.  
Though palace and merchant tones may not harmonize,  
The great return’s principle itself balances.

Therefore with sorrow and joy’s melodies,  
To measure the Way’s learning body.  
Bitter practice studies the spiritual writings,  
Wondrous meaning is naturally fresh.

Only wear the simple curved hymns,  
Able to enter the sorrowless ford.  
Ride the void and ascend the phoenix platform,  
High observance continues the Tang years.

What joy will this joy be?  
Know where sorrow lies.

### Hymn of the Perfected Returning in Circulation

The Most High issues forth profound essence,  
Radiant and splendid are the texts of the true.  
Lofty and scattered are the heavenly realities,  
All directions hold them in common reverence.

No beginning nor ending,  
Not bright nor dark.  
Looking up ascending the jade capital platform,  
At ease resting on Kunlun.

Surpassing and crossing the spring waters and cities,  
The demon king commands to hear desires.  
Seven ancestors receive transformation and birth,  
Resolving my past life grievances.

Entering to control the flying mysterious scene,  
Emerging to ride the floating purple clouds.

Resplendent brilliance shines on the jade morning,  
Mysterious scene opens perfect brightness.  
Far and distant is the hall of the Perfected,  
Shining with the essence of the seven treasures.

One thought transcends the eight hardships,  
Forever alongside the Most High.  
Intertwined offering yellow scene,  
Sunlight arises born in the void.

The world knows the mixed vulgar Way,  
None have heard the scripture of wisdom.  
Great indeed is the rebuke of the true precepts,  
Profoundly affecting the demon king’s sincerity.

Ten thousand years like a single breath,  
How could it strike against a hundred billion ages?

The Most High’s essence is originally void,  
Scattered form transcends weakness and death.  
Strive to proclaim the mysterious art,  
Heavenly venerable praises and extols.

If there is affinity the text reveals itself,  
Not depending on scripture as a storehouse.  
If able to obtain this Way,  
First will be born the perfect light.

Body compressed without crossing the ford,  
Taking office in the immortal hall.

Nothingness never ends or is eternal,  
Being is peaceful entering the wondrous.  
Heavenly pen rises above all,  
The mysterious sect has its own essentials.

Turning the three precious wheels,  
Universal trembling and shining in all directions.  
The Most High views the jade capital,  
The demon king laughs in the void above.

Heavenly emperor crosses hands and chants,  
The myriad perfected ride the void and howl.  
Scattering flowers is my thought,  
Eight vows naturally transcend.

Spirit immortals ride the celebratory cloud,  
Driving dragons treading the mysterious waves.  
Harmoniously manifesting good omens,  
Washing feet at the human-heaven verge.

Blessings respond without my expectation,  
Therefore releasing the heavenly net.  
Moral virtue crowns the three realms,  
Earthly cords have also passed.

Sensing and encountering the cloud true assembly,  
Pure wisdom scriptures lotus flower.

Supreme enlightenment of the four ranks,  
Vast beyond the nine great outer realms.  
Hidden and manifest have surely causes,  
Without hidden there would be no darkness.

Swiftly coil and return the mysterious wheels,  
True immortals favored in the azure.  
Traveling the vast indistinct spaces,  
Heaven and man have no visible boundary.

Spiritual subtlety entrusted to proclamation,  
Heaven and man have ford and shore.  
Floating boat over unfathomable abyss,  
Always fearing the wind and waves changing.

Its affinity has wondrous directions,  
Who can calculate its wisdom and force?  
Slowly yielding to the profound azure,  
Clearly manifesting the dark origins’ decree.

Sharp and quick responding to the true son,  
Spirit zither played in the void.  
Earnest thoughts reverent to ten directions,  
Mysterious abiding not envying me.

The Most High spreads the cavernous texts,  
Worthy ones return to original affinity.  
Desolate the three precious enclosures,  
Luxuriant and splendid is my cause.

The Elder Historian joins essence,  
Pure quality gives birth to golden body.  
Final kalpa and beginning kalpa,  
Increasingly perceiving the spirit’s new face.

Rarely crossing the rite of the Most High,  
Precious texts descend to the true perfected.  
The Way grove flourishes the heavenly capital,  
Illuminating all earthly immortals.

At ease scattering spiritual majesty,  
Vastly proclaiming the great Law.

The Most High views the ten directions,  
Dim and dense blending wind and solemnity.  
Perfect light reflects the three stars,  
The perfected don heavenly robes.

The demon king stands with crossed hands,  
Directing the market beside Feng capital.  
Sun and moon veil the moving radiance,  
Seven treasures shine without limit.

All conduct this moment,  
Disasters cease and hells rest.  
Vastly trusting the shadowless heaven,  
Honouring men none can measure.

The three treasures multiply in ten directions,  
Busy and clear in the void above.  
Winding and turning following transformation’s principle,  
One emotion transmits the Law’s ascent.

Vast and dark within obscurity,  
The four great elements arise with time.  
Void and being, nothing without not nothing,  
Tall and steep many mountain cliffs.

The Most High has no lingering thought,  
Extinct thought returns to the great vehicle.

## Hymns of the Ten Directions Returning to Mystery

First the north, then the northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest, above and below. One hymn one bow.  
The returning mystery grade is beyond nature and spontaneity, standing for over nine thousand kalpas, thus the text appears.  
The Primordial Heavenly King studied the Way with the Most High, later the Way was completed, the Most High commanded the Primordial Heavenly King to compile and compose it, to accompany the great precepts.  
One should on one’s birth day recite the three hundred sections of precepts, then chant this text.  
If at noon or midnight reciting, first purify and then practice the Way.  
If one does not know one’s birth day, use the Jiazi day.  
After ten years, one may properly on the first day of the first month practice the Way.

### Twelve Golden Hymns

Feasting at the great rosy cloud palace,  
Golden towers shining with purple clarity.  
Immortal chambers reflect the great pure,  
Four pavilions all of vermilion jade.

Casting wheels at the cavernous ford,  
Holding reins dancing the green pavilion.  
Jade flowers fly the cloud canopy,  
Western consorts bear brocade banners.

Suddenly beyond dusty impurity,  
Swiftly the lovely person’s courtyard.  
Previous karmic response waits the appointed coming,  
What is gained already in the unseen.

Riding the wind imagining the nine skies,  
Together drinking the cinnabar baby.  
Looking back at the worldly things,  
How could one know the spirit in the void?

Ascending north to the mysterious dark palace,  
Joining hands to pass the lofty net.  
Fragrant smoke scatters the eight scenes,  
Mysterious winds beat the crimson waves.

Looking up surpass the shining ford,  
Looking down glancing at the crooked mountain shelter.  
Howling songs rise and sing on the clouds,  
Phoenix cries echo the nine rosy clouds.

Riding qi floating the great void,  
Why then mount the mountain shelter?  
Golden tally commands the feathered spirits,  
Conquering the hosts crushing myriad demons.

Rinsing and inhaling perfect morning light,  
Accumulated years just germinate buds.  
Confused and competing in the midst,  
Not understanding what to do.

Northern ridge luxuriant with sky mist,  
Crimson trees bear purple flowers.  
Green blossoms fall in the phoenix forest,  
Blue reeds flourish on the cliff shelter.

Spirit palaces soar in the great void,  
Jade chambers join the rosy clouds.  
Clouds rise within the curved chamber,  
Eight winds fly the mysterious sands.

Nine strings play in the emperor’s pond,  
Dragon howls sing in harmony.  
Fan winds stir the five mountain ridges,  
Grasping the tally conquering myriad demons.

Glancing in a moment of time,  
Suddenly years have passed.  
Alas for those born in the morning,  
How can they know many years’ measure?

Corner scenery spreads the forest palace,  
Fate’s axle rushes across the vast wild.  
Highest view reflects the six courts,  
Great and small all roam freely.

Dragons blow entangle the canopy clouds,  
Tigers roar startling myriad branches.  
Three simples open the high chart,  
Rosy clouds adorn the morning sky.

Feathered banners cross the spirit ford,  
Purple pavilion flies with splendid pride.  
Holding reins beyond the nine heavens,  
Looking up and down all is vast and free.

Dust punished binds noise and impurity,  
Spirit lost energy also declines.  
Why not seek far protection?  
Eight thousand is but one morning.

At dawn crossing the blue sea waves,  
Flying wheels leave the green chambers.  
Loud singing companions’ songs,  
Covering the blue waves.

Three contracts jade sky guests,  
Five appointments eastern flower youths.  
Feathered winds ascend the emperor’s morning,  
Feasting here in the vast cold palace.

Eight tones played in the void,  
Purple phoenix sings the spirit wind.  
Crimson clouds block the bright luminaries,  
Eight scenes fly the great void.

Chewing the jade spring ford,  
Vast and elegant returning to infancy’s mist.  
Supreme joy returns to five spirits,  
Years accumulate kalpa blades high.

Removing shoes what difficulty,  
Weariness and sorrow lost in the heavens.

Riding morning light chariot,  
Loosening reins issuing purple clarity.  
Floating wheels racing the rosy clouds,  
Raising canopy over the vast cold court.

High perfected guard the emperor’s chamber,  
Palaces and walls lead the four spirits.  
Ten perfections dance in the cavernous void,  
Flying smoke surrounds the brocade screens.

Tiger fans spirit wind celebrates,  
Purple clouds circle dragons in pairs.  
Swiftly glance to the eight directions,  
One look and years have declined.

Desolate mysterious competitors,  
Why not seek the supreme life?

Spirit gardens flourishing hidden mushrooms,  
Kun pond irrigates the fertile fields.  
Looking up at the jade clear palace,  
Lofty facing the crimson ford.

Purple clouds shine on the curved seats,  
Five clouds light the nine mysterious.  
Eight winds rise the utmost space,  
Dim and dense among the green pavilions.

Three origins dwell in the western palace,  
Eastern flower has a fair lady.  
Northern abyss chants seven howls,  
Bright lady sings southern truth.

Touching the bells joining the vermilion tunes,  
Jade tally raises the six strings.  
Harmonizing contracts is not fate,  
Together sounding atop the broad phoenix peak.

Simultaneously commanding myriad demons,  
Dwelling here among the dark thousands.  
Transcending what difficulty to come,  
Thus opening the endless years.

Riding qi through the cavernous void,  
Riding the scenes resting the nine heavens.  
Dense and wide radiant feathers,  
Mysterious canopy born without space.

Eight clouds and winds in airy wheels,  
Tracks fixed not allowing years.  
Touching the bells eight void sounds,  
My horse also has no ford.

Grasping the tally entering the eastern flower,  
Evening feasting atop the mysterious garden.  
Binding belts carrying five spirits,  
Loosening robes raising fine persons.

Dark sense freely moves with fate,  
Floating wandering following the dark.  
Now know honour and disgrace are bitter,  
Only then understand sorrow hurrying life.

The curved chamber can be clear and quiet,  
Nourishing spirit awaiting day’s completion.  
Why speak of the place of suffering?  
A hundred diseases arise from this.

Heavenly court gives birth to golden flowers,  
Inside to manifest yin and evil.  
Jade valley joins mysterious village,  
Jade qi mutually supports the net.

Heavenly truths stand at distant sun,  
Flying medicines spit spirit sands.  
Clear morning examining heavenly horses,  
Turning chariot to the mysterious home.

Immortals come entering the chamber,  
Again extinguishing a hundred evils.

The Way regards purification as foremost,  
Diligently practicing ascending the golden tower.  
Therefore establishing the great Law bridge,  
Universally ferrying all beings.

Past life’s grace and virtue repay,  
Way’s heart transcendent arising.  
Six purifications ritual cavernous void,  
Ten direct spirit responses penetrating.

Five elders inscribe immortal names,  
Cloud chariots mutually welcome and meet.  
Bodies fly ascending the mysterious capital,  
Seven ancestors all liberated.
