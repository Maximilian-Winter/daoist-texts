## Hymns of the Perfected Ones

### Hymn in Praise of the Great Marvelous Scripture by the Emperor of Supreme Subtlety

The cinnabar radiance illumines the cloud court,  
Purple smoke gleams within the jade forest.  
Brilliant the seven-treasure flowers,  
Resplendent the jade spirit’s music.

The palace tones harmonize one another,  
Wondrous spirits open men’s collars.  
Profound chants sow fields of blessing,  
Broadly crossing the heart without limit.

---

### Hymn of Praise on the Great Marvelous Scripture by the Emperor of Heaven

Profound transformation originally had no trace,  
From trace arose the school of the Way.  
He roams at the borders of the nine heavens,  
Resting his chariot in the palace of six commands.

The Way freely flows within the void’s expanse,  
Spirit songs issue forth into the great emptiness.  
Form feels the utmost silent court,  
Thought chants in hope of subtle communion.

---

### Hymn of Praise on the Great Marvelous Scripture by the Supreme Emperor

Dark and obscure was the beginning of original transformation,  
Dim and distant the morning clouds scatter.  
Upon the highest of vast silent emptiness,  
The two principles are clearly distinguished.

Condensing essence embraces the empty womb,  
The formative changes nurture the spirit’s vision.  
Containing truth, nurturing spirit within,  
Suddenly it opens the darkened dawn.

At first one perceives the swift years,  
Fortune’s cycle turns back to the heavenly river.

---

### Old Lord’s Original Life Scripture Hymn

The root limit of all living beings,  
Silent and without arising or ceasing.  
The weak perish, lost from their root,  
Separated from the true source.

Foolish deeds create cause for good and evil,  
Calamity and fortune repay without end.  
If one desires to overturn the sea of suffering,  
One must cause the river of love to dry up.

Guard unity firmly and be tender,  
Hold to this without flaw or defect.  
Right wisdom opens to the multitude,  
Wondrous understanding shatters all knots.

All practices blend and return,  
The three vehicles vanish their different paths.  
True stillness departs from dust and defilement,  
Clear coolness without vexing heat.

---

### Hymn on the Supreme Wisdom Returning to Mystery Scripture

The spirit-immortal rides the joyful sky,  
Driving the dragon stepping on the mystic waves.  
Perfect truth shines forth auspicious signs,  
Washing feet in the river of the eight heavens.

Blessings respond unbidden,  
Thus able to dissolve the heavenly net.  
Virtue and Dao crown the three realms,  
Earth’s net is also surpassed.

Inspired by spirits and perfected ones’ meeting,  
Pure wisdom brings forth the lotus flower.

---

### Hymn in Praise of the Supreme Wisdom Scripture

To study the immortals is to sever worldly thoughts,  
Moment by moment these accumulate.  
Departing and coming disturb my spirit,  
The spirit restless, none escapes disturbance.

Extinguish thought and rest in void leisure,  
Desolate enter the silent void.  
Request the scripture as one hungry and thirsty,  
Hold to resolve as to gold or stone.

Preserve the son and fly the mysterious path,  
Five spirits cross the talismanic registry.

---

### Hymn on the Great Vow and Great Precepts Scripture

Study immortal practice with urgency,  
Serve the precepts to regulate passion and mind.  
Vast and serene is the place of right qi,  
Immortals and sages find each other naturally.

If one does not believe the words of the Law,  
Why dwell in mountain and forest?

---

### The Jade Emperor Bestows the Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Great Cavern and the Song of Ascending the Dragon Terrace

Swiftly the three clouds lead,  
Turning the firm seven with no canopy.  
Eight scenes enter the Great Origin,  
Flying and sprinkling beyond the nine heavens.

Jade gates give birth to scenic clouds,  
Spirit smoke cuts through the dark haze.  
The western palace chants the Cave of Mystery,  
Clear singing supports the edge of Fusang.

Guarding the female forest among peaks,  
Profound chants at the meeting of the Five Elders.  
Suddenly born with mind,  
In union with your central belt.

---

### Second Hymn

The Gourd River shakes the vast sea,  
The Heavenly Ford drums ten thousand streams.  
Eight winds drive the divine sky,  
Wandering in the midst of emptiness.

Chanting the Cave of Spirit Brightness,  
The sound is your profound investment.  
Suddenly born, certain to journey,  
Elbow bent, hastening amid dust.

A bitter heart indeed,  
One must tell you what you seek.

---

### Hymn of the Queen Mother of the West on the Purple Degree of Fiery Radiance’s Divine Transformations

Whistling songs on the Nine Mysterious Terraces,  
Cliffs and ridges gather chill and gloom.  
Within the mind the six senses freely flow,  
Eyes abandon the dust and filth.

Flowing clouds shine in the golden chamber,  
The empty hall scatters deep mystery.  
Accumulated feeling calls down the spirit,  
Form alone the Way also divides.

Cultivate quickly for myriad kalpas,  
How can one sense the full remembrance of the long life?

---

### Second Hymn

The fair garden flourishes the divine steps,  
Vermilion gates and jade forest court.  
Flowing winds drum the empty hollow,  
Jade sounds ride the void’s call.

Purple smoke entwines the curved door,  
Cinnabar radiance reflects on green carriage.  
Flying banners shade the mysterious canopy,  
Feathers shine with purple clarity.

Ascending the nine skies of the scene,  
Roving and playing in the Phoenix city.  
Behold and cherish the child of the hidden realm,  
One joy to be born together at dawn.

---

### Third Hymn

Reins held tight, controlling the brilliant radiance,  
Feasting on the scene beyond the wilds.  
Wandering in search of the spirit person,  
Uniting forms rejoicing in the sky’s edge.

Hands part the vermilion mound gate,  
Bright as the god’s serene peace.  
Golden gates rise majestic,  
Pure scene without dust or defilement.

Unfasten collar at the Mysterious Lang Terrace,  
Go to my good-will assembly.  
Remove shoes from the three difficult paths,  
Preserve refinement to firm old age.

---

### Hymn of the Spirit Treasure True Unity Natural Supreme Mysterious Unity Perfected One

All wonders issue from the Cave of Truth,  
Brilliantly shining in the Great Clarity.  
Those who serve are called immortals,  
Their bodies without eternal longevity.

Free and easy, sporting in the profound void,  
Palaces spread out without form.  
Radiant the seven-treasure forest,  
Bright the essence of sun and moon.

Dragons and qilin cross and gallop,  
Phoenixes fly and lament.  
The Supreme governs the Purple Terrace,  
All perfected recite the Cavern Scripture.

Rolling incense, bowing with reverence,  
Circling about the palace city.  
Three rounds return to the high seat,  
The king of the Way answers the summons.

The human ruler extends the supreme Way,  
Under heaven, all is widely peaceful.

---

### Hymn on the Supreme Propagation of the Way

The Supreme Profound Void School,  
Propagates the Way and reveres its scriptures.  
Looking up and down, one attains immortality,  
Passing through countless kalpas.

Lofty is the Great True virtue,  
Silent because of no birth.  
Heavenly scenes form the empty branches,  
Riding the void, naturally journeying.

The sun and moon shine brightly and burn,  
Calm and harmony bring endless joy.

---

### Songs of the Eastern Chamber in the Palaces

Purple cassia planted in the jade garden,  
Crimson blooms sound plaintively.  
The moon palace gives birth to the medicinal abyss,  
And the midday sun has a jade pool.

On the left plucks the bright spirit orb,  
On the right draws the radiance of cinnabar clouds.  
Flowing gold lights the crimson court,  
The eight scenes surpass the curling smoke.

Green canopy floats bright and clear,  
Controlling rhythm commands the Supreme Subtlety.  
Phoenix essence and youthful bloom,  
Jade fatness fills long hunger.

Controlling the dawn, drawing the Great Element,  
Riding swiftly to soar the jade steps.  
Breathing in and out the six void airs,  
The jade concubine draws the scarf in attendance.

Strumming the southern cloud fan,  
Fragrant winds drum the brocade robe.  
Knocking on the merchants, beasts dance,  
The six heavens capture divine might.

Suddenly, myriad long years,  
Lifespan tall and lofty.  
Small fresh things not yet cooked in the cauldron,  
Say I sorrow beneath the rock.

---

### Constant Chant of the Great Youthful Lord, the Blue Lad

Desiring to plant the root of dissolution,  
One must uproot birth and death’s self.  
Sinking in thought, falling into the nine springs,  
Only sitting, cherishing the body and frame.

---

### Constant Chant of the Real Person of the Great Void

Observing spirit bearing form,  
Is like a cart following a horse.  
The cart breaks, the horse flees and dies,  
All connected in a temporary lie.

Mourn the world but know this,  
Only cherish wind and fire.  
Seeds of sin bind the heavenly cords,  
Suffer poison in the hells of earth.

---

### Constant Chant of the Real Person of the Western City, Lord Wang

Form is the boat ferrying the spirit,  
Moored on the shore when parting.  
Form is not the usual dwelling of the spirit,  
Spirit is not the usual carriage of form.

Wandering in the wheel of life and death,  
Only suffering from the heart’s hesitation.

---

### Constant Chant of the Minor Perfected One Lord Wang

Losing the Way, crossing the river of death,  
Three souls lost in the path of life.  
Birth after birth is far away,  
Death after death is early.

Alas, the sorrowful guest of pain,  
Root and flower already inverted.  
Rising and falling like scattered dust,  
The horse knows to return to withered old age.

---

The above four poems were chanted on the day of the Autumnal Equinox of the previous month during the jade platform assembly, by the four lords in response to the string music of Xuanjun and Guangshao. Lady You Ying said this.

---

### Guo Sichao’s Small Boat Song while Playing in the Pond

Clear pool surrounds the spirit hill,  
Tall forest thick and green.  
The black crow flies the secluded wilds,  
Words of awakening come calmly.

Beating the drum rides the spirit waves,  
Bowing head hopes for morning wind.  
Not yet having attained release,  
Free and easy in hill and forest.

---

### Second Song

The wave god beyond the nine terraces,  
Refines the Way to attain perfect truth.  
Stowing the feathers of the spirit phoenix,  
Hiding the scales of my splendid dragon.

Holding high the thing of a square inch,  
Ten thousand blows are all filth and dust.  
Looking with sorrow on the newly born bride,  
Who exhausts your chariot wheels?

---

### Third Song

Wandering the void, not falling like the whirlwind,  
Spirit steps without form or place.  
Round scene shining with bright clouds,  
Nine phoenixes sing the morning sun.

Flapping wings fan the Heavenly Ford,  
Dark and hazy rejoicing clouds fly.  
Thus fashioned the Supreme Subtlety palace,  
Drawing this golden pear nectar.

Free and easy on the mysterious terrace,  
Neither existing nor perishing.

---

### Fourth Song

Riding swiftly dancing in the divine sky,  
Wearing clouds and girded by nine suns.  
The High Emperor aligns the dragon wheels,  
Thus made the Northern Flower chamber.

The divine tiger in the jade forest cave,  
Wind and clouds combine to one.  
Opening and closing the hidden dark door,  
Spirit transformations and mysterious traces vanish.

---

### Immortal Lord Who Preserves Life Tells Xu Huba and Du Guangping’s Usual Joy Song

Pure radiance shades the vast forest,  
Warm sun rises the eastern glow.  
Morning wind dances the six smokes,  
Flourishing are the eight paths ascending.

Why must the five mountains be lofty?  
Famous mountains are enough to rise.  
Delicate hands grasp the cave mound,  
Rest the heart, secretly arising.

Breathing in and out the embryonic essence qi,  
Who can surpass the profound white?

---

### Queen Mother of the West’s Invitation Song to Emperor Wu of Han’s Lady Shangyuan Strumming the Cloud Forest’s Song “Step into the Void”

Once I crossed the profound true Way,  
Leaping steps ascending the great glow.  
Bearing the bamboo slip to heaven’s pass,  
May I ask of the Supreme House?

Suddenly past the Purple Tenuity Wall,  
True persons stand in array like hemp.  
Clear radiance stirs the fresh breeze,  
Cloud canopy reflects vermilion blossoms.

Orchid palace opens the pearl fan,  
Blue sky unveils the jade sand.  
Cinnabar terrace binds the empty branches,  
Eyes bright, life gleams with radiance.

Flying phoenix follows the ridge tile,  
Torch dragon leans on the winding serpent.  
Jade embryo arrives with red fungus,  
Nine colors flit in turn.

Drawing in the scene to refine immortal body,  
Ten thousand kalpas as youthful teeth.  
Who has life’s end before the destined time?  
Fusang tree will not verify this.

---

### The Queen Mother of the West Again Commands the Attendant Tian Sifei’s Responsive Song

Morning ascends the Great Spirit Palace,  
Drawing this eight kings’ orchid.  
Evening enters the Mysterious Origin Gate,  
Plucking blossoms and striking the coral.

Fear the foot at the Gourd River,  
The Weaver Girl stands at the ford.  
Breathing in and embracing the scenic clouds,  
Its taste suffices for one meal.

How splendid the Purple Tenuity,  
Jade wheels adorned with vermilion cinnabar.  
At dawn setting out from the expansive mansion,  
At dusk lodging in the city walls.

The path of departure is not the same,  
Each body rests where it is at peace.  
The two principles are yet preserved,  
Why doubt the myriad long years?

Do not speak of this to worldly men,  
They are but living corpses; these words are difficult.

---

### The Queen Mother’s Gift to Lady Wei Song

I ride my eight-scene chariot,  
Suddenly entering the Jade Clarity.  
Dragon skirts brush the sky’s river,  
Tiger banners command the vermilion hosts.

Free and easy at the mysterious ford,  
Ten thousand streams without pause.  
Mourn this coming and going meeting,  
Kalpas exhausted, heaven and earth collapse.

When all is finished with no middle scene,  
Neither death nor birth remains.  
Body is that natural Way,  
Silent observation joins the Great Darkness.

The Southern Peak upholds the true pen,  
Jade reflects shining essence.  
Having no fixed term for tasks,  
The empty heart accepts the spirit.

A joyous meeting within the Red River,  
Together delighting without end.

---

### Double Ritual Pearl Striking the Cloud Gong in Response

Jade Clarity issues from the nine heavens,  
Divine cords fly beyond the rosy clouds.  
Heavenly terraces rise lofty,  
Spirit summer flourishes and thickens.

Five clouds raise the green splendor,  
Eight winds fan the verdant qi.  
Raising the voice to dispel demons,  
Lowering the gaze to cultivate wisdom.

Ten thousand perfected open the morning scene,  
Chanting to meet in the crimson chamber.  
The bright virtue and sound child,  
Spirit reflects and then brushes the rain.

Heavenly peaks tower in the empty branches,  
Along terraces deep and profound.  
Roaming the sea, understanding the narrow well,  
Treading true, perceiving worldly defilement.

Dancing wheels feast in the great void,  
Fish traps naturally collapse.  
Returning to my great long-lived array,  
Gratefully bidding farewell to the morning life world.

---

### Song of the Great Immortal Watching the Cave Spirit

Jade chamber shines with eastern glow,  
Purple chariot floats the crimson dawn.  
How do you gaze upon the splendid terrace?  
Northern feast flying skyward is gone.

Pure and still, the Great No-Being midst,  
Dim and distant stepping the scene’s change.  
Chanting the great cavern chapter,  
Singing these three-nine hymns.

The tune sleeps in the great desert’s midst,  
Spirit king within the square inch.  
Silent chamber thinks spirit radiance,  
What cause for suffering in mountain and wood?

In a moment transformed to old man,  
Turning back to child’s countenance.

---

### Four Perfected Descend to Lady Wei’s Song

Red brightness shines upon Great Clarity,  
Eight winds drum the great glow.  
Return my divine sky chariot,  
Thus make the jade mountain hold.

Alas, beyond heaven and earth,  
The nine circles are all my home.  
Above gathering midday essence,  
Below drinking yellow moonlight.

Spirit view in empty non-being,  
Roc’s path without obstruction.  
Looking upon Wei Xian’an,  
Impure qi harms your harmony.

Diligently cultivate profound thoughts,  
The Way’s completion surpasses one another.

---

### Song of the Blue Lad Fang Zhu

The great glow fans the morning radiance,  
Nine breaths no constant form.  
Mysterious reins fly beyond the sky,  
Eight scenes ride the clear high.

Hand holds the jade emperor’s covering,  
Takes me to be born at dawn.  
Gazing upon the seven luminaries’ chamber,  
Bright also dark and obscure.

Exalted is Wei’s son,  
Having mind and also feeling.  
Profound strength naturally meets,  
Golden script the Eastern Flower name.

Wise An’s secret study,  
We meet in Yanggu and Qian.

---

### Song of the Divine King of Fusang

Morning opens the Supreme Emperor’s chamber,  
Surpassing the Gourd River.  
Blue sea flies green waves,  
Connecting peaks, Red Mountain stands.

Floating wheel at the cloud wave border,  
Nine dragons rise with the reins.  
Tiger banner thick at the rosy ford,  
Spirit wind suddenly stirs order.

Flower remains long rejoicing in the Way,  
Thus attains high divine likeness.  
Uprooted and moved beyond three causes,  
The meeting of spirits now just begins.

We meet at the Yangluo official,  
The Way completed led by Wei’s son.

---

### Song of the Pure Void Real Person

Riding swiftly controlling the pure void,  
Wandering the Western Flower pavilion.  
Jade forest at the divine boughs,  
Tiger banner chases the smoke scattering.

Wisdom wind shakes the cinnabar banner,  
Bright candles shine on eight flames.  
Unfasten collar, wrap in common chamber,  
Spirit bell sounds brilliant.

Resting in the scene like forest branches,  
Nine strings play the profound center.  
Leaving me accumulated worldly worries,  
Releasing this thousand-year sigh.

Joyful watching without end,  
All night waiting for dawn.

---

### Second Hymn

Purple glow pities the profound void,  
Spirit winds have no guiding cord.  
Suddenly filling the eight districts,  
Bless you to open the void’s stillness.

The eight windows have no constant brightness,  
There is dark and there is light.  
Cave view of the three cinnabar fields,  
Silent, born form and scene.

Concentrating spirit, standing to meet,  
Cloud form lofty, bright and neat.  
Ashamed to lack the art of Ying stone,  
That is the natural brightness.

Diligently gather the way of life,  
Leak and replace knot disaster blue.  
Spirit’s term has its time,  
Together raising sleeves to ascend.

---

### Song of Lament for the Human World

Heaven above and human world,  
Meeting but few and sparse.  
Sun sets beyond western hills,  
Evening crows return flying.

A hundred years but a moment,  
Will and wish diverge.  
Heavenly palace near at hand,  
Regret that we do not follow.

---

### Ba Ballad

Immortals have obtained when reeds first form,  
Riding dragons ascend to Great Clarity.  
Now below, the Profound Continent plays in the Red City,  
Passing generation to generation in my abundance.

The Emperor studies it in the Jia and Ping years.

---

### Poem by Shi Anqing

Spirit mountain creates the great glow,  
Firm rocks rise to lofty peaks.  
Purple smoke scatters over divine land,  
Riding the gale driving the white dragon.

Together leading four honoured guests,  
East to greet the Mulberry Forest lord.  
Broad blessings though in the past,  
How can vigour be so dark?

Truly not to yield the lower path,  
Pushing years to mutually exalt.

---

### Poem by Zhang Youshi

North tour beyond the great desert,  
Come to ascend the Penglai gate.  
Purple clouds build the spirit palace,  
Fragrant smoke so thick.

Beautiful indeed is Luo Guangxiu,  
Long in the position of discussing the Way.  
Seated is the True Person Luo Pian,  
Together watching the white dragon’s gallop.

Using the four of Li Shi,  
When shall we unfasten our belts?  
Longing to bear open sleeves, friend,  
Joyfully meeting at early dawn.

---

### Poem by Xu Yufu

Wandering and viewing strange mountain peaks,  
Rinsing in the clear ocean currents.  
From afar looking at Penglai in between,  
Lofty soaring into the dark sky.

Five mushrooms cloak the red cliffs,  
Four steps like chess of jade and crystal.  
Scattered spirit blooms disperse,  
Brightly shining the spirit court.

Free and easy beyond the seven senses,  
Letting me grasp heavenly birth.  
Satisfied within the square inch,  
What use then the white dragon’s glory?

---

### Poem by Ding Weining

Mysterious mountain builds the blue waves,  
Golden chamber reflects the spirit pavilion.  
Luo lord upholds exquisite virtues,  
Free and easy with no interval.

Form sinks into northern cold space,  
Three spirits meet the nine heavens.  
Together going from the same chamber,  
Pushing me to surpass my years.

Stone Qing’an at weak crown,  
Not yet willing to exalt the worthy.  
Mocking the Penglai lord,  
Calling this Guangxiu before.

What will the bright lord do,  
To counter this youthful pen?

---

### Letter of King Fuchai of Wu

The mysterious ford flows crimson waves,  
Kunbi reflects the Lang mountain.  
Morning sun controls morning radiance,  
Gathered splendour how gentle the dragonfly.

Wandering clouds fall on the sun,  
Gale radiance soars over three heavens.  
Spirit treasure shines the nine voids,  
Light and dark gather on the mountain ridge.

Summer Yu ascends the eight windows,  
Scattering qi and sounding the golden orchid.  
Using branches to shake the jade rods,  
Following waves to seek the great source.

Upholding substance standing the spirit pole,  
Hanging leaves to form abundance.  
Vast and far dragon and phoenix traces,  
Brilliant shining the nine heavens’ writings.

Looking up drawing in the three stars’ essence,  
Protecting body seeking long peace.  
Looking down rinsing the five flowery liquids,  
Returning and again regaining youthful countenance.

Riding the spirit in warm and cool palace,  
How can one know heat or cold?  
A thousand autumns like a clear dawn,  
Ten thousand years like the sun at noon.

Beating wings go upward as one,  
Commanding me the spirit treasure officials.  
Burning incense for the five emperors’ chariots,  
All meeting in the desert’s border.

Asking about hunger and thirst,  
Profound springs plentiful with red flow.  
Seeking the immortal within the square inch,  
Eight directions have no ease or difficulty.

But hearing the stench of vermilion gates,  
Difficulties lie in the muddy way.  
Inscribed stelae labor in the rock’s shade,  
Caves and hollows may be checked and spread.

---

### Poem of Xin Xuanzi

In former days entering the underworld,  
Following the chariot responding to spirit summons.  
Spirit follows void and emptiness dispersing,  
Qi with celebratory clouds dissolving.

Form is not bright jade essence,  
How can the mysterious craftsman carve?  
Trilling feet chant dark songs,  
Raising hands playing the call of the whistling branch.

In forest chamber there is leisurely joy,  
Cut off from this veranda’s outside.  
Leftover scene attaches to the round brightness,  
Fine sounds how few and sparse!

---

### Second Poem

Silent passage entrusts feelings and response,  
Profound qi gathers stirring sounds.  
High wheels though uneven,  
Ten thousand zhang accordingly seek.

Desolate the Way-seeker,  
Joining spirit, contracting spirit’s bosom.  
Yielding following the world’s transformations,  
Heart flutters in the deep seclusion.

Together wandering beyond principle,  
Joining in silent eastern peak.

---

### Third Poem

Command chariot to vast Feng’a,  
Wandering traces in the hidden dark place.  
In the void there is object,  
Within the middle also no permanence.

Understanding words have no limit,  
Together meeting at Hao Bridge.  
Eye witnesses profound understanding,  
Ghost and spirit reason forget themselves.

---

### Hymn of the Lady Zuo of Supreme Profundity and Purity

Dense and thick, not a true wilderness,  
The Great Origin is my pavilion.  
The Mysterious Duke is not to be destroyed,  
Enshrouding gloom is my difficulty.

Falling phoenix controls the purple glow,  
Delicate reins ascending the morning ridge.  
Silent without boundary of moat,  
Radiant in the void’s gaze.

Hidden fungus flourishing at Phoenix Hill,  
Lingering around the jade forest’s edge.  
Dragon embryo nourishes your form,  
Eight jades return the clear dawn.

Bright splendor fills the jade palace,  
Clusters of blossoms surpass the shining rocks.  
Peng fans sever a hundred million ridges,  
Flapping wings support the soaring feather.

In the western court commanding the long song,  
Cloud gong abandoned, emptily struck.  
Eight winds entwine the green palace,  
Thickets of smoke suddenly scatter.

Spirit child throws flowing gold,  
Fire faintly opens the tablet of words.  
Three origins bow and dance,  
Purple emperor waves sleeves in praise.

Brightly fanning the scene’s radiance,  
Glowing the long herald shines.  
Rising carriage towers the sharp blade,  
Looking down makes me sigh.

Looking upon the Earth Immortal crowd,  
Why do they dwell in woods and streams?

---

### Song of the Spirit Phoenix

Mysterious spirit phoenix,  
Endlessly long returning,  
Long and slow is my thought,  
Forever against my wish.

Countless kalpas without period,  
When will you come to fly?  
Then the king slew that phoenix,  
Lofty and flourishing it was born.

Holding the daughter it flies,  
Straight into the clouds it goes.

---

### Song of the Female Immortal Zhang Liying on the Stone Drum

Stone drum, stone drum,  
Alas, the lower earth!  
Since I came to see,  
People’s lives are truly bitter.

Alas, world affairs,  
Long my thoughts,  
My thoughts cannot be humiliated,  
The king’s might cannot be taken.

My will is with phoenix and dragon,  
Singing and dancing by myself,  
Soaring through clouds and river,  
Far surpassing the dust net.

Children of the world,  
How are they like me?  
Briefly coming to meet,  
Destiny turns away.

Father, mother,  
Greatly harming my heart.

---

### Childhood Ballad of the Early Han

Wearing a green skirt,  
Entering the heavenly gate,  
Saluting the golden mother,  
Bowing to the wood lord.

At that time no one knew it,  
Only Zhang Zifang knew it,  
Then went to bow.  
Saying: this is the jade child of the Eastern King Lord.  
Saying: when immortals attain the Way and ascend to heaven,  
They salute the golden mother and bow to the wood lord.  
Only the child who ascends to true reality from pure emptiness knows its crossing.

---

### Poem Presented by Elegreen Flower to Yang Quan

Divine mountain pierces the sky,  
Flying peaks thickly rise a thousand zhang.  
Vastly enclosing spirit valley void,  
Jade forest flourishing thick.

Yang born marked by beauty and grace,  
At weak crown flowing pure sounds.  
Dwelling emotions at the solemn ferry,  
Surpassing form and image in Wei’s woods.

Raising colors within vermilion gates,  
Inside and outside transcending worldly hearts.

---

### Second Poem

I and the Master’s clan,  
Our sources share the same deep pool.  
Great school divides the upper work,  
Until today each is a different branch.

Orchids and gold are worn out of love,  
Three benefits are just becoming more full.

---

### Third Poem

Quiet searching rejoices in this meeting,  
Elegant gathering prolongs the days.  
Who says the hidden mirror is difficult?  
Obtained it is kept within the square inch.

Rising thoughts beyond the cage,  
All become mountain and rock hermits.  
Do not let soaring wings,  
Within, follow the startled wind rising.

Though transformation comes from man,  
The fenced sheep is not easily matched.  
What is hoped for is not the morning flower,  
At year’s end it is for my son.

---

### Poem Presented by Ninth Flower Lady to Yang Siming

Cloud gate firm above the void,  
Jade terrace towering and thick.  
Purple palace rides green scene,  
Spirit view thick and lofty.

Jade bench within vermilion chamber,  
Highest virtue shines crimson glow.  
Looking down and rinsing spirit vial ford,  
Looking up and gathering blue jade flower.

Washing feet in the jade heavenly pool,  
Pounding and planting the Cowherd River.  
Thus steering scenic clouds to ride,  
Falling dragon reins the mysterious cave.

Shaking clothes at dust and filth’s edge,  
Lifting skirt stepping the muddy waves.  
Wishing to form mountain and marsh bonds,  
Firm yet gentle to conform and harmonize.

Together carrying double purity within,  
Highest truth is not perverse.  
Purple Tenuity meets the good plan,  
Singing accepting and enjoying abundant blessings.

---

### Second Hymn

Riding swiftly departing Western Flower,  
No waiting and waiting between.  
Sometimes gazing at the Five Mountain peaks,  
Sometimes washing at the heavenly ford.

Releasing wheels searching the void boat,  
Everywhere is all intertwined.  
Mustard seed suddenly becomes ten thousand acres,  
Within is Kunlun mountain.

Small and large are essentially alike,  
Near and far are the same fate.  
That is produced with waiting to come,  
I am the origin waiting on kin.

---

### Poem of Lady Zhonghou Wang

Dragon banner dances the great void,  
Flying wheels on the five mountain heights.  
Everywhere is free and easy,  
Having feeling, stirring mysterious song.

No waiting analogous to waiting,  
Meeting each other thus in harmony.  
Vast waves how can they be wide?  
Profound wells are not many.

Enclosing and searching the step intervals,  
Together meet the four seas net.  
How can it be like beyond brightness,  
Three kalpas only then passed.

---

### Second Poem

Eight paths meet with no root,  
Riding fate watching the noisy net.  
Transforming in the midst of floating dust,  
Unfastening collar is of the Way family.

Gazing at smoke suddenly not falling,  
Carrying truth to the spirit cave.  
Empty scene winding jade pavilion,  
Xuanjun makes the phoenix song.

Going the road without track or obstruction,  
Spirit sounds dance on cloud waves.  
Even virtue shows jade scenes,  
What use is the world’s abundance?

---

### Third Poem

Only observe the simple heavenly truth,  
Leaving burdens and freeing all passions.  
Body silent, abandoning contrivances,  
Exalting existence for nurturing life.

How can one attain the equalizing son,  
Entrusting fate and following the course?

---

### Fourth Poem

Ascending carriage departing Eastern Flower,  
Fanning gale dancing the great mystery.  
Flying reins soaring ninety thousand,  
Eight falls also then equal.

Briefly gazing at mountain and water border,  
Subtle spirit mountain midst.  
Together with wind harmonizing qi,  
The Way is reasonable and thus so.

Dragon fungus seeking distant longevity,  
Inner view capturing heavenly truth.  
Eastern peak can long be still,  
Why be entangled by things?

---

### Poem of Lady Fangzhang Yizhao Ling Li

Cloud ramparts gird the heavenly branch,  
Seven qi shining the spirit pole.  
Jade gates open the morning call,  
Nine notes in the crimson pivot.

Purple glow and vermilion gates,  
Fragrant smoke arises at green window.  
Four chariots dance tiger banners,  
Blue carriage throws profound void.

Splendid canopy follows the clouds’ ranks,  
Falling phoenix controls six dragons.  
Steering the scene five mountains heights,  
Three plain glances at the lord’s chamber.

Hearing the restless and filthy qi,  
Ten thousand impurities soil my chest.  
Foul things smoke my spirit,  
Tumultuous dust mutually striking.

Bright jade all dazzling,  
Why alone do I flourish?  
High bows bitter not early,  
Seated on earth growing worms.

---

### Second Poem

Drinking wine observing myriad wisdoms,  
Suddenly drinking the four falls around.  
Unconscious of the reason,  
Truly no waiting for wandering.

Meeting all joyfully,  
Not meeting also no worry.  
Casting shadow in the profound void,  
Two meetings are naturally cultivated.

---

### Third Poem

Flying wheels high on the morning terrace,  
Controlling reins at the profound ridge corner.  
Hand carrying purple emperor’s cover,  
Suddenly eight winds drive.

Jade splendor wings the green curtain,  
Blue skirt fans the green skirt.  
Crowned pavilion dazzling and ghostly,  
Wearing bells and hanging moon pearls.

Thinly entering wind and dust midst,  
Plugging nose escaping the proper removal.  
Foul fishy withers my qi,  
Hundreds of obstacles order my heart’s root.

Why not suddenly arise like the gale,  
Desolate stepping the great void?

---

### Poem of Lady Wang of the Southern Pole

Controlling gale fanning the great void,  
Eight scenes flying on high purity.  
Looking up floating beyond purple dawn,  
Looking down at the falling Qi.

Profound heart empty and silent midst,  
Up and down not flowing or stopping.  
No waiting in the two limits,  
Waiting has no place of operation.

Body without then can die,  
Body with then nurtures life.  
Eastern guests meet singing high,  
Two waits what is there to contend?

---

### Second Poem

Command chariot of jade brocade wheels,  
Dancing reins looking back and forth.  
Morning tour at the vermilion fire palace,  
Evening feast at the luminous pool.

Floating scene clear cloud end,  
Eight dragons right now uneven.  
I make the no waiting wandering,  
With waiting then see and follow.

High meeting with beautiful people resting,  
Two waits mutually wrong and right.  
Existence and nonexistence are not fixed,  
Waiting and waiting each returns.

---

### Third Poem

Forest shakes like must-like feeling,  
Clouds thick waiting for dragon’s roar.  
Profound numbers seek themselves,  
Touching rhythm all have sound.

Flying carriage leaving Western Flower,  
Gathering reins suddenly come seeking.  
Eight directions not without amusement,  
Together chanting reason self admiration.

Mourning this four poles midst,  
Hundred worries ever in heart.  
All wander Northern Cold terrace,  
Spirit wind opens your bosom.

---

### Poem of Lady Wang of Purple Tenuity

Riding gale to meet the nine heavens,  
Resting reins on the three beautiful peaks.  
Waiting and wandering gazing,  
No waiting firmly must be still.

Vast waves how need labor,  
Who is better than surpassing the profound well?

---

### Another Chant

Turtle gate towering lofty,  
Rampart terrace falling moon pearl.  
Seated in the nine spirit chambers,  
Knocking gong chanting the Great No.

Jade flute harmonizes my spirit,  
Golden nectar releases my sorrow.

---

### Another Chant

Feasting and drinking within Eastern Flower,  
Thousands of sounds strike the strings.  
Blue lord calls me to rise,  
Bowing waist hoping for forest court.

Feather mantle fans green radiance,  
Jade pendants clang and ring.  
All point to the high morning hall,  
Await the vision in the dark.

---

### Another Record of a Journey Chant at Xuanlong

Rising steps the crimson glow,  
Flying gale over northern ridge court.  
Spirit splendor shines the immortal terrace,  
Round brightness follows the wind’s tilt.

Opening radiance embraces cinnabar origin,  
Gate scene feasts the moon essence.  
Intersecting cloaks of cloud and forest,  
Vast chariot returns to youthful infant.

Desolate entrusting no home,  
Right and wrong how can one make?  
World’s cords entangle each other,  
How can one speak of nurturing life?

---

### On the Evening of the Sixth Day of Ninth Month at Yunlin, Again Commanding Yang Junran to Pen a Metaphorical Chant

Unfasten wheels on the great glow,  
Draw reins making the purple hill.  
Hand holds the eight qi flags,  
Leaping body floats in the void.

One glance at creation’s cords,  
Again looking for the high plot.  
The Way’s essentials already are,  
Able to relieve a thousand worries.

Seeking truth and gaining good friends,  
Not leaving, what else to seek?

---

### Chant Given to Xu Changshi Mu and Xi Fanghui and Others, Again Commanding Yang Jun to Write

Purple void bright with profound radiance,  
Profound palace girded by crimson river.  
Ordered and grand the Upper Clarity chamber,  
Spirit platform shines lofty.

Eight chariots make the vermilion pool,  
Feather canopy tilts the sky branches.  
Thunder wind returns three mornings,  
Golden bells scatter jade splendor.

Seven reins descend the nine terraces,  
Feasting gazing no need for home.  
May I ask the Way seeker,  
What are you doing sitting in dust and waves?

How can one dwell at Eastern Beauty,  
Nurturing truth and gathering great harmony?

---

### Also Commanded to Show Xu and Xi on the Eighteenth Day of Tenth Month, Again Commanding Yang Jun to Write:

Left holding the jade flower canopy,  
Flying scene treads the seven origins.  
Three mornings shine purple radiance,  
Refining gaze stroking the true brightness.

Changing leaps in a moment,  
All four sides already divine.  
Spirit emanates without boundary,  
Diligently pondering the Upper Clarity texts.

Why sit in crooked paths,  
Causing your feeling to be not focused?  
Yin illness losing mysterious mechanism,  
Unaware the years divide.

Xu said to Yang Jun: The diligent one diligently pursues affairs,  
Following the profound subtlety only.  
The careful also touch kinds and act.  
Learning the Way is difficult, not to be written.  
Those with shame and contempt for it,  
Are also far from the Way.  
Only when filled and grasped is it precious.  
The worthy man lifts his eyes anew,  
Now is the time to forget internally.

Hence chanted:

Profound clarity dimly views,  
Falling scene issuing from Eastern Pavilion.

Wishing to get friends beyond dust,  
Desolate rare in the world’s bustle.

---

### Chanting This Repeatedly, Also Saying:

Spirit men hide the mysterious peak,  
True persons conceal clouds and come.  
Profound chants are not without time,  
Wondrous responses naturally have waiting.

Who would expect the void’s silence,  
Its ultimate harmony always present.  
Carrying sleeves ascending the feather palace,  
Together feasting the vast cold wrapping.

May I ask who are the friends,  
What is stored is only the jade maiden.

---

### After Chanting Ends Said:  
Zhuo Yunxu’s steed,  
Spreading wings above Kongtong,  
This man indeed,  
Is it not long drawing from the south,  
Seeking to thank the thousand chariots?

---

### Chant on the Thirtieth Day of Second Month

Armored robes cross the green river,  
Thus seeing the Lord of Fusang.  
High meeting at the Great Forest ruins,  
Enjoying feasts at the profound flower palace.

If the Way is sincere and pure,  
Why not dwell on Eastern Peak?

---

### On the Fourteenth Day of Fourth Month Again Making Seven Chapters of Words

Controlling the scene, first waving the ford,  
Flying gale ascending the Upper Clarity.  
Cloud terrace thick and lofty,  
Gate towers adorn jade city.

Morning wind drums the cinnabar clouds,  
Vermilion smoke sprinkles the golden court.  
Green leaves gather the profound peak,  
Purple fungus grows below the rock.

Celebratory clouds entwine the cinnabar furnace,  
Refining jade flying the eight jades.  
Feasting gazes at the vast cold palace,  
Ten thousand long-lived yet youthful infants.

Dragon banners open the spirit lightning,  
Tiger banners summon the vermilion troops.  
High true returns to the nine luminaries,  
Cave view balances hidden and clear.

Who can step the hidden Way,  
Seeking my endless longevity?

---

### Second Chapter

Dark and dense the Purple Tenuity pavilion,  
Towering terrace scatters scenic gale.  
Phoenix sings among splendid canopies,  
Phoenix bell guides the dragon court.

Eight wolves carry crimson banners,  
White tiger blows horn and flute.  
Clouds surge painting the spirit palace,  
Coming to meet the dust and noise.

Unfastening reins held by beauties,  
Common qi naturally summons each other.  
Seeking the ancestral root in a moment,  
Ten thousand years is but one morning.

Longevity term meets the full decline,  
Kalpa passed how can it be wide?  
True perfected gaze upon each other,  
Do not let the heart stray and plunder.

Void blade swings to the void,  
Despising stagnation, five spirits grieve.

---

### Third Chapter

Morning opens eastern dawn,  
Flying carriage crossing the blue sea.  
Mountain waves shake green shores,  
Eight winds fan the profound smoke.

Turning paths easily moving the chamber,  
Longing for true feeling in men.  
Three golds can wander the tray,  
Eastern peak should be forever pure.

Scattered along the road,  
Who can step the path of life?

---

### Fourth Chapter

Fluttering eight rosy ridges,  
Wandering flying morning canopy.  
Purple carriage soars the great void,  
Sun drying the nine voids outside.

Jade flute excites the scenic clouds,  
Spirit smoke cuts the dark haze.  
High immortals feast in the great truth,  
Clear singing with no bounds.

Coming and going mountain and water court,  
What matter has treatment?

---

### Fifth Chapter

Divine jade shines spirit ford,  
Seven origins shining the spirit gate.  
Empty moving within the square inch,  
One leap ascends the Supreme Subtlety.

Wondrous sounds ride harmonious chant,  
High meeting also has its mechanism.  
Equal with these heavenly and human gazes,  
Harmonizing those morning scenes flying.

Holding reins outside the six directions,  
How is there tilting and danger?

---

### Sixth Chapter

Thinly feasting dust gale ridge,  
Changing and returning following return.  
How can one know the spirit kalpa term,  
Looking back makes men sorrowful?

---

### Seventh Chapter

Cloud grass shades the profound square,  
Looking up feeling the turning radiance.  
Luxuriantly flourishing and growing,  
Great virtue must surely flourish.
