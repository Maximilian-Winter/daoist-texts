Essential Scripture of the Clear Brightness of Shangqing

In all practice and observance, first bathe and fast, abstain from cold foods to warm the body, wash and cleanse the clothes and coverings until they are fresh and pure, and fumigate them with incense.

Chapter One: Scripture of the Method for Making the Bright Mirror

The method to behold one’s form in the mirror: One should slightly open the door, sit in darkness facing the light, briefly close the eyes, and with thought imagine the face and form. At first all is indistinct and nothing is seen. After midnight, gradually the vision becomes clear and far-reaching, and one sees the face, the eyes, and the kerchief; the mind’s eye opens bright. Early morning and sunset are the best times. If the sun is at its height, one should slightly close the door and peer into the mirror amid the brightness, but in such blazing light nothing will be seen.

When looking into the mirror by firelight, the fire should be placed at a distance, not near. If one desires to open the eyes and look, and to see the form, it should be done in brilliant light without pain. If one wishes to close the eyes and imagine the face, one should be in darkness facing the light, and then one may see the ears.

The great essentials of mirror viewing require one to lie down at ease and concentrate with spirit and sincerity. Before lying down, the body is stretched out; after a short while, there will be a red and yellow radiance issuing from the forehead, illuminating the whole room. Then one feels as if in a dreamlike trance, as if awake yet lying down; one sees one’s face in the light, mutually regarding it for a moment, then it immediately vanishes. After awakening from sleep, one again looks into the mirror, and when one wishes to lie down, one lies down, thinking as before. One sees oneself thus evening after evening. Sometimes when lying down one sees two faces opposed, or sees one’s form with another person sitting together, or in sleep sees beautiful divine children and jade maidens aged fifteen or sixteen, fond of fine clothes, with their foreheads clearly visible, to whom one bows repeatedly. Sometimes one hears voices by the ear, knowing all the auspicious and inauspicious events of the world beforehand. Sometimes one sees the east wall in the west, or dreams of looking into the mirror while lying at dusk, or returns within the light to observe the five viscera. When looking into the mirror, one should begin on the day of Jiazi.

The method of setting the rules: use a bright mirror nine cun in diameter, free from blemish or defect, perfectly clear; place one on the left and one on the right, at a distance of one chi five cun from the person, level with the eyes. Wash with zinc and well water, placing it below. When looking in the mirror at night, it is suitable to use a hemp oil lamp. When one sees one’s form clearly, one bows down twice to the ground, kneeling long, and says, “I and you are of one body; I command you to multiply your forms a myriadfold, begging always to accompany me so that my form shall not decline, but accompany me for ten thousand years.” In viewing through the bright mirror, first see the form and then the many objects, hearing and understanding the voices of men.

In practicing the bright mirror, there are three boys and nine maidens attending. The three boys are six feet tall, the nine maidens five feet tall. They wear blue sashes and blue clothes; the one in the middle wears purple; the inner maidens wear black; the plain maidens white; the august maidens yellow; those within the canopy wear pale yellow; the Taoist maidens yellow; the female infants red; the ancestresses crimson.

The lord of the bright mirror has one hundred and twenty officials and attendants, governing the Palace of Open Yang. The masters are two boys of the eyes; their pure light looks on and perceives scenes, knowing auspiciousness and calamity.

Chapter Two: Scripture of the True Man Daoist on Polishing the Mirror

In former times there was a mirror-polishing Daoist who travelled among the people, renting himself out to the common folk to polish mirrors, of all sizes, charging only six or seven qian. He did not polish with any other object but only with a medicine applied to the face. The brightness of the mirror was not constant. There was a man of good repute named Yuan Zhongyang who knew that he possessed the Way, and detained him to lodge overnight, preparing a feast for him. The master bowed and asked him questions. The Daoist told Zhongyang: “The way of the bright mirror can divide forms and transform them; from one it can make ten thousand; it can also make a man wise, foreknow coming events, and enable a man to see the gods and immortals of heaven. By practicing the Way and obtaining the method, all the gods and immortals of heaven will come. When the Daoist sees himself, he lives long without aging, and becomes a young child again. Also, the Daoist enters the mountain to meditate; the mountain spirits and old demons often come to test him, sometimes taking human form. Therefore the Daoist always hangs a bright mirror nine cun in size behind him in the stone chamber to repel evil spirits. Although a hundred ghosts and old monsters can change their shapes, they cannot change their image in the mirror. When their forms appear in the mirror, they immediately vanish and retreat, not daring to harm. Thus the Daoist has the medicine for polishing the mirror, and the recipe comes from the White Master Gao. The formula uses four liang of tin, placed in a cauldron over a fierce fire until the cauldron is red-hot and the same colour as the fire, then the tin is added. Also three liang of lead white powder are ground and mixed therein. A piece of raw white poplar wood is carved into a figure one chi long, two cun wide, and one cun thick, with the handle length equal to the length of the human ear; this is used to stir it, with the hand never resting, until the figure is seven cun. Then four liang of real cinnabar and one liang of lead white powder are added and stirred; the figure remains two cun. Then four liang of polishing tin are added and stirred until incorporated. When ready for use, it is powdered to the size of cowpeas and mixed with saliva until it becomes like deer tallow. Also, with a piece about the size of rice grain, one breathes upon it, placing it on the front teeth and then smears saliva over it, so that it becomes as bright as the sun and moon. Before making the medicine, one must fast and purify for seven days. It is made in a clean, secret place, no one must see it. The fire must be fierce. Keep it secret; do not transmit it rashly to unworthy persons.

On the days of Jiazi in the ten-day cycle, one faces Mao; on days of Jiaxu, faces Chou; on Jiashen, faces Hai; on Jiahwu, faces You; on Jiaching, faces Wei; on Jiayin, faces Si.

Those who desire to summon the six Ding and jade maidens should always face the direction of the day’s cycle when urinating, repeating this in turn; then the divine maidens will arrive and all calamities be removed.

Chapter Three: Laozi’s Hundred Flowers Powder, a Prescription to Repel Soldiers and Save the World

This prescription repels the three armies, drives away many evils, relieves hardships, prolongs life; those who obtain it live long.

It contains realgar, cinnabar, coltsfoot flower, and polygala.

Four substances, each two fen, prepared separately; combined with one hundred herbs’ flowers of the seventh month, made into powder two sheng, mixed thoroughly. In years of calamity and epidemic, take half a qian spoonful. Before taking, abstain from cooking with pungent vegetables and meat of the six domestic animals. In cases of county magistrates’ emergencies, attacks by soldiers and bandits, or ships sailing in storms, mix one dou of water with one liang of medicine to wash the face and bathe the body. This one sheng is enough for three persons; prepare a little more to keep in case of sudden need. If washing and bathing are not possible, take two pills of the size of small beans; the hardship will thereby be relieved. If other disciples have ill fortune in their lives, give them the medicine, and they will be delivered. Keep secret in the Golden Cabinet; do not transmit to unworthy persons.

Chapter Four: Immortal Divine Wine Prescription

Half a sheng each of Sichuan pepper, cassia, licorice, and good malt; five pieces of aconite; half a sheng each of dry ginger and sophora root; half a sheng of dried dates, fat and good.

These eight substances are ground, passed through a fine sieve, and steeped in one hu of fine strong wine; then dried in the sun and steeped again; repeated until all the wine is used and the process complete. Stored in an oilskin bag, the mouth tightly twisted so it does not leak. When wishing to make the wine, take one dou of water, throw in a small spoonful of the medicine, stir, and the wine is formed. It can also be combined with honey pills as bait. In winter it is steeped in warm water. Immortals travel ten thousand li without lacking wine; this is the reason.

Chapter Five: Divine Immortal Pillow to Dispel All Ailments, Prescription

At the foot of Mount Tai was an old man, whose name was lost. When Emperor Wu journeyed eastward, he saw the old man hoeing by the roadside; a white light rose several feet high. The Emperor was amazed and asked him privately: “What is your art and method?” The old man replied: “When I was eighty-five years old, weak and dying, white-headed and toothless, a Daoist taught me to take jujubes, to drink water and abstain from grain, and to make a divine pillow containing thirty-two substances. These thirty-two correspond to the twenty-four qi, and the eight poisons correspond to the eight winds. By practicing this I gradually grew younger, my hair blackened anew, fallen teeth grew again, and I traveled three hundred li daily. Now I am one hundred and eighty, but cannot abandon the world to enter the mountains, being attached to my grandchildren; I have eaten grains again for more than twenty years, but still benefit from the power of the divine pillow, and do not age further.” Emperor Wu looked at the old man’s face and thought him about fifty years old, and asked his neighbours, who all confirmed it was true. The Emperor then accepted the prescription and made such a pillow, but could not follow the abstinence from grain and water.

The prescription requires the fifth day of the fifth month, or the seventh day of the seventh month. Take a board of wood from the mountains or forests, making a pillow one chi two cun long, four cun high, hollow inside to hold one dou two sheng, capped with red heartwood, four fen thick, well made and tightly closed but capable of opening and shutting. Drill three rows of forty holes each in the cap, one hundred and twenty holes in all, each hole large enough to hold a millet grain. The medicines used are:

Chuanxiong, angelica, white angelica root, magnolia flower, du-huang, white atractylodes, ginger root, magnolia bark, Sichuan pepper, cassia, dry ginger, fangfeng, ginseng, platycodon, fei kang (?), [illegible], white houttuynia, Qin pepper, Jing shi (?), one book says strong Jing shi, cistanche, coix seed, coltsfoot flower, and lian wu. These twenty-four substances correspond to the twenty-four qi. Added poisons are: aconite, prepared aconite, euphorbia, soap pod, mangcao, alum stone, pinellia, and asarum. These thirty-two substances, one liang each according to the book.

All are finely powdered; the poisons are placed on top; the pillow is filled with cloth bags; when used for a hundred days, the face shines. In one year, all internal diseases and wind diseases are cured and the body becomes fragrant. In four years, white hair grows black, fallen teeth grow again, and ears and eyes become clear and sharp. This prescription is miraculous and secret; do not transmit to unworthy persons. Artemisia root is the old chuanxiong mother.

Emperor Wu asked about it, and Dongfang Shuo replied: “In olden times, Nu Lian transmitted this prescription to Yu Qing, who passed it to Guangchengzi, who passed it to the Yellow Emperor. Recently, the Daoist Chunyu Gong of Gucheng used this pillow and medicine; though over one hundred years old, his hair was not white. All diseases arise from the yang pulse in man; now by pillowing on this medicine, the evil wind cannot invade. Even though a cloth bag is used for the pillow, it should further be wrapped in a leather bag, which is removed only when lying on the pillow.”

Imperial edicts offered the old man bolts of silk and cloth, but he refused, saying: “My relation to Your Majesty is as a son to a father. Knowing the Way, I do not accept rewards. I am not one who sells the Way; I present this only because Your Majesty loves goodness and believes in the Way.” The Emperor relented and bestowed upon him further medicines.

Chapter Six: The Nine-Jointed Staff of the Daoist

The first joint is named the Taiyin Star; the second, the Yinghuo Star; the third, the Jiao Star; the fourth, the Heng Star; the fifth, the Zhang Star; the sixth, the Yingshi Star; the seventh, the Zhen Star; the eighth, the Dongjing Star; the ninth, the Ju Star.

Chapter Seven: Laozi’s Charms and Medicine in the Jade Box

In the stone chamber, Laozi said: “O ye multitudes of men, all know that life is joy and death is evil, yet none know the means of self-life. A thousand arts and myriad medicines enter the body, rightly obtaining old age and longevity, a thousand years or more, several hundred years; yet none can make the multitudes soar and ascend as immortals, appearing before the Heavenly Emperor. The best of wood medicines is pine resin, which grows on fungus, hence the resin is fat and rich. Its leaves and fruit are all edible. The best of herbs are ronghua, polygonatum, asparagus, and mountain thistle, all suitable for continuous use without a day’s interruption, conferring five hundred years or so, but unable to complete union with heaven and earth. Later alchemists have added to this and thereby misled learners; I deeply pity them. The eight-stone pill and vermilion jade syrup, if taken, require abstention from sexual relations, blood, food, defilement, and meat; lying in a famous mountain’s stone chamber for a year, one may meet ghosts and spirits and not die, but still cannot make the multitudes soar and lightly ride clouds. Have you heard that immortals take Ganoderma? This is no empty talk. On the yin and yang of famous mountains, over pure springs, under ancient trees, grows also Ganoderma; but what it contains is the essence of mountain, water, earth, and wood, and it cannot enable men to become immortals; it surpasses ordinary herbs only. On accumulations of cinnabar, gold, malachite, and realgar also grows Ganoderma. This Ganoderma, unless it be of the highest virtue and spirit, will be missed though encountered and not eaten. The reason Ganoderma can make men immortals is that it receives the utmost essence of these four substances, containing the harmonious qi of heaven and earth yin and yang, steaming and scenting the vital fluids to obtain generation; its flavour is more divine than the essence of these four substances themselves. Now, if only these four substances be taken, ground and taken as a tonic, it will be beneficial; if joined with the power of response and gathered in furnace and cauldron, its spirit flies upward; sweep it up and take it, and it will be a hundredfold more potent than herbs alone. It is essential to obtain the pure qi of heaven and earth, to draw down the essence of the four substances, so that it may again generate living beings; should it not be a hundredfold greater than when placed in earthenware pots? I am soon to depart, but I consider that the multitudes will become dust and ashes; lamentable indeed! Now I have compiled the celestial writings on Ganoderma; those with destined bones shall obtain my writing. If their ancestors have sin, their bodies will not be granted longevity nor my book. Store it in famous mountains’ stone boxes under ninefold layers; do not transmit indiscriminately; be careful, be careful.

On the day of the Beginning of Spring, dig a pit in the east direction of the house, where there is no dwelling inside or outside; seek good soil, not ash or earth. Dig a pit three feet deep, three feet square. Take one jin of malachite, ground to powder, wrap it in ram’s skin, sprinkle with one sheng of green Chinese chive, cover with earth and build upon it. After seven days blue clouds shall cover it; after seventy days blue vapor will arise, linking with the blue clouds above. After one hundred days Ganoderma shall grow, shaped as shown in the diagram. On the days of Yin and Mao, from sunrise, hold a blue silk three feet long and a bone knife, walk Yü’s steps and carefully cut it, not looking back. Return and dry in shade for one hundred days, grind it to powder. Take one knife-wei with well water three times a day. When Ganoderma is finished, one shall be able to rise lightly; spirits shall come to receive him; he will ascend in broad daylight and be united with heaven and earth without limit.

On the day of the Beginning of Summer, dig a pit in the south mountain’s sunny side, eight feet deep and square. Take two jin cinnabar, ground to powder, wrap it with red realgar, ground and sifted to remove stones; place the cinnabar powder inside, sprinkle with two sheng of scrophularia, cover with earth and build upon it. After eight days red clouds will always cover it; after eighty days red vapor like smoke will arise, linked with the red clouds. After one hundred days red Ganoderma will grow, shaped as shown. On the days of Si and Wu, from sunrise, walk Yü’s steps with an eight-foot red and dark red silk sash and wooden knife, cut it, bow twice and leave without looking back. Return and dry in shade for one hundred days. Take a small spoonful daily, beginning at dawn before the sun rises one zhang. Wash down with well water. When finished, the three corpses, nine worms, seven diseases, wild dogs, lung abscesses, accumulations, and all maladies turn into turbid blood, discharged from the nose and mouth; wash with well water and one can walk upon water, fire will not burn, and abstain from grain and food. The dead should not enter houses or rooms; abstaining from blood and food, dragon chariots and many immortals will come to receive him. To prevent the common people from using it, do not cultivate this Ganoderma.

On the day of the Beginning of Autumn, dig a pit in the west mountain’s shady side, six feet deep and square. Take one jin of gold, fire-melted, cast into the pit, pour in one sheng of spirit-mountain crane’s knee grass, one hu of clear wine, one hu of duckweed, cover with earth and build upon it. After six days white clouds will cover it; after sixty days yellow vapor like steam will arise, linked with the white clouds. After one hundred days yellow Ganoderma will grow, shaped as shown. On the days of Shen and You, at the time of Shen and You, from sunrise, walk Yü’s steps with six feet of white silk and a golden knife, cut it, bow twice and leave without looking back. Return and dry in shade for one hundred days. Take three fingers’ worth daily. When Ganoderma is finished, the old grow younger, the young become radiant, white hair turns black again, fallen teeth regrow.

On the day of the Beginning of Winter, dig a pit in the north mountain’s shady side, five feet deep and square. Bury three jin of realgar, prepared and placed in a mature copper vessel, pour in two sheng of hemp oil, cover with one jin of realgar powder, then earth and build upon it. After five days black clouds will cover it; after fifty days purple vapor will arise, linked with the black clouds. After one hundred days purple Ganoderma will grow, shaped as shown; at night it shines within a li, and on cloudy nights one can see hairs. On the days of Ren and Gui, from sunrise, walk Yü’s steps with a five-foot black silk and a horn knife, cut it, bow and leave without looking back. Dry in shade for one hundred days. On the days of Zi and Hai, prepare powder and take five fen spoonfuls daily, facing north at midnight. When Ganoderma is finished, the old transform into children. Women may also take this Ganoderma; the Director of Fate, Taiyi, sends celestial officers to welcome them; their lifespan is equal to heaven’s endlessness; knives and needles cannot pierce them; fire does not burn them; water does not wet them; they repel the five poisons; evil spirits avoid them; they know no hunger or thirst.

Those who take these four Ganodermas will all live long without death; wherever they go the Heavenly Officials attend their kitchens; they can also abstain from food; wherever they travel, in mountains and marshes they supply rides for dragons and tigers; ghosts and spirits come to worship and receive instructions. Keep this secret.

The commentators say: In this discourse, the numbers of heaven and earth, yin and yang, can transform and create myriad things; it cannot be said there is none. Like the fire struck from the positive flint and the water drawn from the negative flint, and the bamboo cut to make fire, how can it be said there is no response? With a cinnabar cauldron changed to quicksilver, responding to the essence of the sun, what thing cannot be transformed, what transformation does not come to pass? Assuming various substances, transforming and generating, store it in the Golden Cabinet; be careful not to leak it. Those with destined bones shall meet your form, diligently cultivate goodness, the Director of Fate will remove their death record, heaven and earth will be united, they will roam above the nine heavens, turn through the six directions, have divine penetration and understanding, and enjoy eternity without end. The blue in the diagram is like emerald feathers, not changing colour for a hundred days.

Thus ends the Essential Scripture of the Clear Brightness of Shangqing.
