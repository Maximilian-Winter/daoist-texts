The Supreme Clarity Containing Images Mirror Sword Diagram

Narrated by Sima Chengzhen of the White Clouds of Tiantai

The method of the Four Regulations depends solely upon the divine arts; the marvels of a thousand years are sought only in the black shadows. Containing light and reflecting form, though one sees its appearance, yet the image connects with spirit; rarely is the pattern preserved. And the excellence of the mirror is that its pure essence is inwardly condensed, profound and yet tranquil; its clear radiance is outwardly bright and polished. To behold it is at once to attain understanding. It responds without concealment; the heart of the perfect man shines more clearly. It reflects and summons shadows; the forms of subtle transformations return. This is what is called the way of steadfast brightness, the correctness of divine spirit. As a treasured object to hold and admire, none surpass this vessel. It not only enables self-reflection but also serves to mirror external things. This mirror is thus round without and square within, taking its symbol from Heaven and Earth. In the centre are arranged the lines and trigrams, fully representing Yin and Yang. The essence of the sun, Li, is the sun itself; the essence of the moon, Kan, is the moon. The stars correspond to the five phases, and all seven luminaries are included. Thunder and lightning are at Mao, Zhen is thunder; the heavenly abyss is at You, Dui is marsh. The clouds divide the eight trigrams, regulating the seasons and operations of the four times; this expresses the pattern of Heaven. Its square and circular flow is water, pouring out the four dark points; within is placed the continuous mountain, marking the five great mountains. The mountains and marshes communicate the vital breath, and all grades of things exist therein; this establishes the pattern of the earth. The inscription in four lines accords with the principle of the three powers; classified and extended, it may be apprehended in thought. This is a message to explain the pattern of humanity’s writings. Hence it is called Containing Images Mirror, summarizing its meaning. The inscription is carved in a box, carefully displaying the form of the instrument.

Preface to the Jingzhen Sword

The essence of Yang is named Jing; the energy of Yin is developed in Zhen. Therefore it is named Jingzhen, fully embodying the meaning of essence and energy. Thus the pure substance corresponds and the vital images communicate; the mechanism of operation responds with awe and spirit. The principle of the spirit substituting for form is already seen in the true regulations; the method of gathering ghosts and destroying evil is not heard of in the strange patterns. This is why the sword’s surface harmonizes Yin and Yang, carving images and patterns of Heaven and Earth. Qian uses the noble constellation as the tip; Kun sets thunder and lightning as the edge. Where the heavenly constellations add force, what thing does not submit? Where thunder and lightning rage, what thing is not destroyed? To wear it on the person is to have protection within and without; to apply it to things is to follow the uses of men and ghosts.

Imperial Commentary and Poem of the Tang Minghuang

By imperial command, having received the bright illuminating treasured sword and others, containing the brilliance of the two luminaries, inheriting the images of the eight trigrams, sufficient to extend light, benevolence, and longevity; shadows to destroy the city of abundance. To wear and admire it deeply moves the heart; ashamed I compose four rhymes.

The treasured illumination contains Heaven and Earth, the divine sword unites Yin and Yang. The sun and moon shine with resplendent light; the stars and constellations arrange the patterns. The mirror depicts form and substance; to wear it is to guard the body. From this one may admire and play with it, perpetual virtue preserving life and length.

Presentation to the Master Sima, Celestial Master, of the Mirror Containing Images

I have heard that rivers and mountains meeting their time may yet manifest auspiciousness; grasses and trees responding to their season may even present signs. How much more so am I born in this flourishing age, living among the common folk! If there be any marvel, I am compelled to present it to the august court. I first received from the Tang Sima Celestial Master the mirror Containing Images cast for the Ming Emperor; handed down and kept secret for generations. The mirror’s outer roundness models Heaven, the inner square models Earth; it pairs Kan and Li with sun and moon; it spreads cloud vapour over mountains and rivers; to the right it fixes the location at the heavenly abyss; to the left it reveals power in thunder and lightning. The eight trigrams are all displayed; the four dark points control the circuit; encompassing the way in Qian and Kun; shaking its power against evil spirits. Hence named Containing Images, responding to the Most High. Its diagram appears in the secret mysteries; its affairs clearly preserved in the Daoist Canon. I, a humble woodcutter and fisherman, a worthless blockhead, who have been corrupted by the style of Zou and Lu, have had the fortune to meet the transformation of the Tao of Yao and Tang. Therefore the mirror is hardly hidden; it is fit to be manifest and clear. I reverently follow its form and advance it, late in life but eager in heavenly wisdom. I have no words but trembling respect, awaiting imperial command.

In the second year of Jingde, tenth month, I, Wu, respectfully present this memorial.

Methods of Casting Sword and Mirror and of the Medicine

In all sword and mirror casting, one must obtain iron refined a hundredfold to be cast. When the iron is refined and pure, without cinnabar or silver added, it is not called refined sword. Therefore the ancient sword gods and mirrors, received from the Divine Xu Gong of the Yellow Emperor Xuanyuan, and later passed on to Zuo Qiuzi, the swordsmith Gan Jiang, and the extraordinary man of Wu and Yue, Qiao Gong, all mastered the divine mirror and spirit sword methods. Later generations found it difficult to cast without adding cinnabar and silver to the refined iron. Now first the cinnabar is fired to become silver; then the iron is refined and mixed with additions, taking the year, month, day, and hour. The sword and mirror follow the pattern of former methods, also separately making samples of sizes, each having its lawful measure.

Method of Refining Cinnabar into Silver

Half a catty of coloured mountain and marsh silver, half a catty of cinnabar, half a catty of lead powder, half a catty of mercury.

These ingredients are pounded evenly and placed into a porcelain container, wrapped with a layer three fingers thick, then set in a sand steamer and steamed for seven days. When cold, it is taken out as coloured silver, then further consolidated with clay and placed into an ash pool, tended by fire for fourteen days, with daily five catties of fire forging. Taken out, it is covered with salt and bellows, and thus made into a supreme treasure.
