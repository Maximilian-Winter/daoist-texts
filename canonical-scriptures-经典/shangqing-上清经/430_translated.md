The Supreme Clarity Eight Scenes Jade Register Morning Diagram Hidden Talismans, received by the Supreme Daoist Lord, treasured in secret by the exalted lord of Jade Clarity and Supreme Rank. Those who possess the golden tablets engraved with jade characters, named the Imperial Registers, may hear and see, and must recite the Great Scripture of Perfect Reality in Thirty-Nine Chapters, the Three Treasures of Spirit and Truth, the One and the Female, the Eight Spaces and Twelve Supreme Aspirations; invoking the clouds, wearing the crimson radiance, hastening the moon, binding the ritual cord of the Way. None may wear the Eight Scene Morning Diagram Mysterious Hidden Talismans without these. Those who obtain the hidden talisman’s seed, after eight years, may ride the carriage of the Eight Scenes. This text is secret and unheard of in the world. The exalted lord of Jade Clarity and Supreme Rank always keeps it in the Golden Orchid Jade Chest in the Chamber of Seven Reflections, sealed with a cinnabar floral casket, entrusted to the Left Duke of the Immortal Capital, commanding twenty-four Jade Mornings and Jade Children, and thirty-six Jade Flowers and Jade Maidens to guard the hidden talisman. Recording merits and bright good deeds, the Mysterious Truth descends to instruct; for seven thousand years the triple transmission has been heard, but no man possesses it; sealed on the famous mountains, it may not be lightly divulged or the treasure revealed. If the master and disciple fail, the seventh ancestor moves the stone of Mengshan to fill the river of night, and the body with the former master shares the burden of the lower ghosts, enduring the ten sufferings and eight difficulties of the infinite toil. Now this collection is composed to clarify the intention with caution. Those who wear the hidden talisman received from the Supreme Daoist Lord shall burn incense in a separate chamber on the left and right, and worship morning and evening; they must not mix in filth or defilement, nor touch the True Qi in opposition. The Jade Children and Jade Maidens will report offences to the exalted lord and punish with trials of water and fire. The heavenly truth is secret and weighty—how can it be disregarded?

When the body receives the talisman, on each of the eight seasonal festivals and on the birthday of fate, he shall bathe and enter the chamber at midnight, facing only north, with heart bowed and eyes darkened; he shall recall the Three Pure Clouds descending from the north-west of Heaven to cover the entire chamber, shutting within and without. After a good while, he shall cover ears and mouth with both hands, draw in the cloud Qi thirty times, and upon completion find the cloud Qi cleared away. Two small boys appear in the likeness of infants, each holding a brocade pouch; one pouch contains the hidden text of the Eight Scenes Jade Register, the other the Three Treasures Divine Scripture. These are bestowed upon the destined body, and the two boys transform into two august Emperors, entering the destined body. Then the incantation is chanted:

'Issue forth from mystery, enter clarity, return to the chamber of morning splendour; teach me and bestow upon me the unblemished white origin; the one female nourishes, the five registers of perfect mystery, thirty-nine chapters, ten thousand recitations of gestation and birth, preserving the soul and summoning the spirits, unveiling the gate of perfection; the jade talisman concluded, the body rides the purple clouds, ascending to salute the Northern Emperor, and worship the Jade Clarity. When finished, knock the teeth nine times, swallow the saliva thirty times; thus for eight years, one shall possess the eight heavens’ jade radiance, the mysterious green carriage coming to fetch the destined body, ascending to the palace of Jade Clarity. Cultivate without neglect, with diligent heart fix upon mystery; treasured by the exalted, revered by the Supreme Daoist Lord, abiding in pure sincerity, keep secret and revere it.'

The Clear and Supreme Limitless Supreme Daoist Lord Hidden Talisman, worn by the exalted Supreme Daoist Lord of Jade Clarity, on the Brahma Luo Terrace of Supreme Heavens, the Jade Clarity Purple Radiance, the Supreme Jade Emperor and Bright Supreme Daoist Lord. On each birthday of fate, it is worn on blue paper with vermilion ink, tied with a yellow silk sash. This talisman governs all spirits under Heaven, greatly concealing demons and ghosts that sing songs of disorder; it connects spirits and attains truth. Reciting the scripture without disorderly sounds while wearing the talisman ten thousand times, one shall certainly have the three origins dispatch the carriage of the eight scenes to welcome the destined body, ascending to the palace of Jade Clarity.

The Morning Diagram Hidden Talismans issue from the palace of the eight original void births; condensed Qi forms the chapters. The Jade Clarity Purple Daoist Xu Huang Shang Jun bestowed them upon the Supreme Daoist Lord, who wears them in the Palace of the Eight Heavens Without Harness; accumulated over seven thousand kalpas, entrusted to the Supreme Minister Qing Tong Jun to confer upon those destined for immortality in the later ages. The world has no such text; only the golden tablets of the Jade Register may be consulted. This Dao is exalted and subtle, beyond that which plain paper can contain or speech express; it follows the movement of the hundred and six eras, selecting saints and ministers in the three dynasties, and must be transmitted to later generations. The method of transmission must follow the mysterious rules; within seven thousand years thrice transmitted, the aspirant must have the immortal bone, establish the alliance and oath, present eight taels of purple gold and eighty feet of purple patterned silk, and receive it. The master’s faith requires application to the path of cold hermitage, compassion for the destitute and distressed, and no personal gain. The bright ritual must not be disobeyed; be deeply cautious, expand the alliance and bear the oath; the body is tested by the wind blades, filled with lower ghosts, in the unbounded toil. Carefully transmit and measure to honor it.

In former times, in the era of King You of Zhou, there was a man named Jin Guzi, his surname Wang, styled Xuandu, a common mortal. Once he passed the Northern Peak and obtained a jade casket; upon opening it he saw the Eight Scene Hidden Talismans. Xuandu did not understand the writing, but perceived it as divine script; he wore the text, yet did not practice, and thus the Three Pure Clouds constantly covered his body. Thereupon he styled himself Jin Guzi. After eight years, he rode the clouds and ascended; now he is appointed as the outer immortal of the Nine Palaces, sitting idle with no concern for affairs, nor ascending the court of the Jade Emperor. This is the heritage transmitted by the prince.
