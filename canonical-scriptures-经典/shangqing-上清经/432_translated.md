The Secret Register of the Jade Purity Concealed Writ of the Great Cavern of the Three Scenes of Supreme Clarity

The Primordial Heavenly King fasting in purity for a thousand days, within the Palace of Jade Purity, made oath and covenant with the Ten Heavens that are without sound or colour, without form or name, without ancestor or clan, without limit, the cavernous spirits of Jade Purity, the nine mysteries of natural countless kalpas. The Dao was bestowed in the "Scripture of the Great Cavern of the Three Scenes, Three Origins, and Jade Purity Golden Tiger and Phoenix Characters." The Jade Youth and Jade Maiden of the Three Heavens delivered it to the disciples, together with their immortal names, corresponding to the Jade Purity Perfected Ones. It was fixed under the name Xuántái Golden Treasury, its writings and jade rites to reverently receive the true spirits, to fly within Jade Purity, to look up to the cavern spirits, naturally to be reborn anew, to attend and guard the Supreme True, to verify and name the immortal rank, to control demons and marshal spirits, descending to the Golden Terrace cloud chariot and jade sedan chair.

Herein is recorded that in the year of a certain heavenly officer, on a certain month, day, and hour, in a certain prefecture, district, county, village, there is a man or woman, of such and such name, aged so many years, born in such month, day, and hour, who from childhood has been devoted in love and reverence, personally observing the mysterious writings, diligently morning and night, burning incense and practicing without ceasing, faithfully offering incense and pledging oaths with cinnabar. This person presents themselves before Master of the Three Caverns, humbly requesting to receive "The Secret Register of the Jade Purity Concealed Writ of the Great Cavern of the Three Scenes of Supreme Clarity." With utmost sincerity, according to the teaching of the former master, they purify and make oath. Now bringing this trust before the Master of the Three Caverns, I, your servant, hereby announce on the altar to the myriad spirits below and the Five Mountains, Three Rivers, and Nine Springs, all that is known and heard. According to the law I now bestow and transmit the method. After receiving the method, if one should violate the oath and betray the trust, the Seven Ancestors, parents, and recipient’s body shall suffer the continual inspection by the left and right officers, shall tread the mountain of knives, swallow fire and eat charcoal, endure the twenty-four prisons, the three punishments and five pains, without respite for ten thousand kalpas, without regret. Only beseeching that the message be delivered, that the true spirits may descend, that the Jade Youth, Jade Maiden, divine officers and generals may support and protect the recipient’s body, erase their guilty record, record their name among the Nine Heavens’ immortal names and jade register, granting long vision and longevity, the Seven Ancestors and parents to be rewarded with the birth in Heaven’s Court, speedily attaining ascent and deliverance. May imperial favour prosper, the Nine Temples ascend to truth, in accordance with the covenant of the Heavenly Official’s laws and decrees.
