The Great Register of the Jade Inspection of the Primordial Supreme Most High

In the first year of Qingxu, the year of Gengyin, on the ninth day of the ninth month, at the first heavenly stem and the direct hour of Chen, the Primordial Heavenly King fasted at the Upper Purity Palace, and made a covenant with the Supreme, that which is without summit, without colour, without shadow, without form, without name, without ancestor, without limit, perfectly clear, Most High, naturally without number of kalpas. The Way was received from the "Three Primal Jade Inspection Texts," by the Three Heavens’ Jade Boys, to be entrusted to later disciples, one who by the mysterious name should be the Upper Purity Perfected Person, established in the Dan Terrace Golden Treasury Jade Register, with purple writings and jade tablets, to greet the Holy Sovereign, flying to the Upper Purity Palace, looking down and up at the perfectly clear natural official titles, attending the Perfected, inspecting heaven, earth, and man, summoning immortals, controlling demons, commanding spirits, descending the cloud chariot, attending the body receiving the law, like the covenant texts of the Nine Perfected Mysteries.
