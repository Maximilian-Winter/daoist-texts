## Register of the Eight Mysteries of the Great Profound

On the second day of the ninth month, in the first year of the Supreme Emperor, the Later Sage Lord Li went forth to journey the Western River, surveying the eight directions. At that time the Primordial Heavenly King rode in the Jade Chariot of the Eight Mysteries, mounted upon the Nine-Coloured Mysterious Dragon, accompanied by three pure flying clouds, leading a retinue of assembled immortals, holding a splendid banner in hand, with lion and white crane, roaring and singing harmoniously, floating in the air to meet at the Western River. Lord Li bowed his head in reverence and asked the Heavenly King:  

"Long ago, I received instruction and was granted the Celestial Book of Jade Characters containing the Twenty-Four Diagrams. Though I have attained their text, I have not penetrated their wondrous chapters; though there are diagrams and their praises, there is no image to behold; the cultivation of the hermitage is shrouded in mist, and the subtle principles are difficult to detail. Now encountering the Celestial Venerable, my joy is beyond words; I humbly request that you would graciously bestow accomplishment, to perfect the Daoist truth."  

Thereupon he undertook one thousand days of pure abstinence, incense of five fragrances fumigating the body, facing east wearing talismans. The form of the spirit appeared in full; naturally all doubts were dispelled. Lord Li bowed reverently, following the divine instructions, observing the celestial rites, continuing the long fasting for one thousand days, facing east wearing talismans. The three divisions of the Eight Mysteries of the spirit appeared within the body; the Twenty-Four Diagrams of golden characters and jade letters shone in midair, their texts resplendent and bright, penetrating without limit, their arrangement natural and spontaneous. At that time the Lord commanded that the chief diagram be immortalized, and thus the diagram was painted. Golden characters, purple letters, jade script, and cinnabar stamps; thereby the sound was completed.  

From the Southern Pole the Nine-Radiance Supreme True King’s Consort, the two blossoms of East and West, the True Lords of South and North, the Five Sacred Mountain Immortals, and the Pure and Void Perfected received the true text; these were the images painted by the Later Sage, each linked therewith.

On the first day of the first month, in the year of Red Brightness, at the hour of noon, the celestial light was fourfold bright, purple clouds circling the sky, felicitous firmament’s eight assembly, spirit wind sweeping dust, sun and moon emitting radiance, five stars irrigating the ford, heaven and earth dim the ford, scattering fragrant blossoms, rivers and seas silent, mountains and hills hiding smoke, the five sufferings all resolved, the three roads pardoning souls, the nine darknesses ceasing opposition, the long night opening gates, deaf and blind become wise, six diseases all healed, earth store releasing, golden jade dew forming, white bones producing breath, decayed remains returning to man, dragon scales leaping and dancing, black beasts flying joyfully, the three realms long in peace, men and spirits rejoice.

On this day a great celebration, myriads of kalpas renewed, Primordial Heavenly Venerable, extending guests to the Jade Terrace, in the Red Brightness Heaven midst, Mount Nanhui, Elixir Spirit Cave Palace, spreading the five colours, gold as altar, silver presenting earth, seven treasures announcing spirits, conveying the crossing of the Cave Mystery golden book, purple characters, jade script, cinnabar stamps natural spirit diagrams, twenty-four true three divisions of scene spirits, heavenly immortals, flying immortals, immortal soldiers and horses, bestowed to the Supreme Limitless Dao Lord, according to imposing ritual and mysterious pattern, bright true texts, delivering to ninety-nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine, with preexisting golden names, enumerating characters of various heavens responding to immortals.

At the end of the great cycle, the texts shall be gathered and returned to the Supreme Net Seven Treasure Mysterious Terrace Purple Micro Palace. Now, the three caves govern the motion, the Divine Treasure teaches below, previously crossing and ascending immortals vacant, requiring worthy ones to fill the various heavens’ Black Emperor True Masters. Northern Mountain Master Great Lord, formerly in the year Wuxu, ninth month thirteenth day, at the Southern Cave of the Central Heaven, receiving method from Central Mountain Master Lord Yang, should again cross men, previously having preexisting destiny names, golden patterns and jade talismans combining true persons, to assist the celestial officials, traversing the eight extremes of the calendar, coming from the void.

Now there is a preexisting destiny Red Emperor True Master so-and-so Jia, birth fate Bingwu, fate belonging to the Red Southern Emperor of the Elixir Heaven registry, born in the seventh month, naturally crossing the heavenly qi, bone and fate joined to immortal truth, should assist the Cave Mystery second rank immortal. This year at such and such day of such and such month, at such and such heaven, according to the former master’s old method of bright true great law, ascending the Yellow Altar, the Seven Treasures stabilizing spirit, the five colours confirming immortality, bestowing crossing innumerable natural Divine Treasure Cave Mystery golden book, purple characters, jade script, cinnabar stamps, twenty-four true three eight divisions diagrams, immortal mounts and chariots.

Without spiritual response, forty thousand kalpas do not announce.  

(Then follows a long enumeration of various heavenly demon kings, true spirits, immortals, officers, and their numbers, detailing departments and ranks within the upper, middle, and lower divisions of the Cave of Heaven, the Divine Treasure, Cave Mystery, and Cave Spirit, with vast numbers of celestial soldiers and officers assigned to each division and scene.)
