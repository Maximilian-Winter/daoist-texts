## Record of the Primordial Origin of Supreme Clarity: The Great True Jade Secret

### Also called: The Method of Casting Off the Form, Escaping Transformation, Flowing Radiance, and Jade Light

#### The Three Evil Gates

The first gate is called the Gate of Form and Desire; also called the Path of the Upper Corpse, or the Boundary of the Heavenly Followers.

The second gate is called the Gate of Affection and Desire; also called the Path of the Middle Corpse, or the Boundary of the Human Followers.

The third gate is called the Gate of Food and Desire; also called the Path of the Lower Corpse, or the Boundary of the Earthly Followers.

These three evil gates are also called the Path of the Three Corpses, or the Boundary of the Three Followers. They continually dwell within the human body, blocking the three passes' mouths, severing the roots of the three lives, restraining men from learning the Way of Immortality, suppressing the soul that would fly and soar. They are the origin of learning; if one does not cast off the corpses upon the three paths, and remove desire at the gates of the three realms, how shall the True descend? How shall the Way be accomplished? To study the highest method, one should dispose of all desires, extinguish the roots of the corpses, and then the Way will naturally descend, the Immortal will naturally be achieved, and one will succeed in soaring aloft, ascending to the Three Pure Ones.

#### The Five Gates of Bitterness

The first gate is called the Gate of Form's Burdensome Bitterness of the Heart; also named the Path of the Great Mountain Hell's Bitterness.

The second gate is called the Gate of Affection's Burdensome Bitterness of the Spirit; also named the Path of the Wind-Blade's Bitterness.

The third gate is called the Gate of Greed's Burdensome Bitterness of the Body; also named the Path of Bearing Mountains and Carrying Stones Bitterness.

The fourth gate is called the Gate of Striving's Bitterness of the Essence; also named the Path of Making Rivers and Streams Bitterness.

The fifth gate is called the Gate of the Body's Multitudinous Bitterness; also named the Path of Swallowing Fire, Eating Coal, and Boiling Broth Bitterness.

These five gates of bitterness, these five paths, continually reside within the human body; they bind the root of life, restrain men from summoning the True, sever the gate of cultivation of Immortality. They are the origin of learning; if one does not cast off the form upon these five paths, extinguish traces beneath the five bitternesses, the multitudinous burdens will not cease, sinking into the gates of sin; how shall one be delivered, and soar on high, escape transformation, and flow radiant jade light? To desire to study the highest learning, one should first sever all burdens, utterly extinguish the gates of bitterness, then the True will naturally descend, the Spirit-Immortal will naturally be formed, one will succeed in transformation of form, and roam and feast among the heavens.
