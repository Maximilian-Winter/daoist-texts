Record of the Supreme Purity, Primordial Beginning, Most High Jade Emperor of the Nine Heavens

Herein is a report offered to the Nine Heavens, which are boundless and endless, without ancestor or clan, without form or name, without beginning or end, without sound or voice, without stillness: the Great Void, the Purple Emptiness, the Mysterious Abyss, the Dark and Hidden, the Gloomy Netherworld, the Radiance of the Primordial, the True Void Sovereign Dao Lord. By means of the Three Spirits, swift in the Void, the Mysterious Lineage moves the Morning; the Way transforms the august foundation; recording the true spontaneity; the subtle threads of the spirit are faint and remote; the Nine Emperors advance their succession; the High Emperor is vast and lofty; the Primordial Ruler supervises Heaven; the obscure and ancient shadow lingers; the time does not wait for me. I dare to offer this report to the Nine Heavens, the Primordial Origin, the Great Truth; universally opening the myriad transformations; ascending to the Spirit Mountain of the Covenant; the Four Directions and the Five Emperors all supervise the covenant texts.

The scholar Wang Jia of the upper learning receives the breath and unites with the immortals; with pure fasting on the Mysterious Peak, he reverently receives the Jade Chapters, the secret names of the emperors, the utmost subtle and wondrous words, recorded as prohibitions and warnings. He dares not violate the covenant text, nor disobey the regulations; lest his body perish by the River Source, and he be long condemned to the dark night; bearing fire and treading the mountains, passing through the three roads and five sufferings, he dares not presume to deceive the origin.

All the ends awaken, and regard this as new today. The Four Officers and the Five Emperors array their petitions by name; above they speak to the Nine Heavens; below they report to the myriad spirits; early they receive spiritual response; the perfected ones descend to the chamber; flying to the sky with light canopies; clad in green feathers and blue skirts, they come to welcome the person; ascending to the imperial dawn, soaring through the nine voids, feasting on the radiance of the three origins.

On the day of the report, the Eight Vows are fully declared; all the commands thus reported are without exception fulfilled.
