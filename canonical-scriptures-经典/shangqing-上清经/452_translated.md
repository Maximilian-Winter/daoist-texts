### The Yellow Emperor Inquires of Lord Ning, the First Discourse on the Secret of the Southern Lord

Xuanyuan Huangdi formerly planted the immortal ferry, responding above to the spirit essence, born with peculiar spiritual elegance; his rank succeeded the Heavenly Emperor. Again pursuing the Dao to seek truth, he purified and fasted at the mysterious gate, ascended Yuntai Mountain to worship and consult with Lord Yu. He inquired of the Three Caverns, saying: "I inherit the vast sequence, though governing myriad affairs, whenever I ask for the true essentials, I serve the mysterious commands; yet my heart and form are restless, the holy Dao is subtle and profound, the profound principles are intangible, I have not yet been able to deeply comprehend. The Dongxuan Lingbao, five sections throughout life; the Dongshen Xianjing universally extends the colored forms; the Great Dong holy teaching is consistent with emptiness and non-being, entrusting substance to connect with emptiness. The Three Treasures fully received; mundane feelings are perplexed and obstructed; the supreme way is difficult to understand. Do the Three Caverns throughout life correspond and unify as one?"

Lord Ning replied: "The mysterious original primal qi is the root of the Three Caverns; the Three Pure Ones and the Three Realms universally extend their manifestations. The Immortals, the True Ones, and the Holy Persons hold nine grades of the profound steps. The Three Caverns are mixed and unified, their responses and inspirations differ; through kalpas they appear and transform; the Three Treasures come together; high saints descend to the mortal; in due time they grant teachings. The Highest Saint transmits the Dao and speaks in detachment from words; the Middle True transmits virtue, entrusting words to universal principles; the Lower Realm transmits scriptures, thus words are cultivated and practiced. The degrees are thus distinguished."

The Yellow Emperor reverently bowed twice, knelt and requested again: "May I ask concerning the Dao, the mutual differences of the three grades, I desire to learn the essentials to dispel all doubts."

Lord Ning said: "The three realms and three boundaries differ in their communications and appearances; the high saints descend to the mortal, their awakenings vary in depth; the Dong passages are unobstructed and called the Three Caverns. The Three Caverns communicating the method differ in their retributions. Regarding the Highest Saint transmitting the Dao: in the Dragonhan kalpa, it is the Jade Emperor of the Supreme Way, the Great Dong Holy Lord; born above in the Jade Clarity twelve holy heavens, he transmits the holy Dao and together with Emperor Yudan, Elder of the Nine Heavens; Emperor Chanshan of the Nine Heavens True Sovereign; and Emperor Xuyan, the Primordial Heavenly King, each teaching the three heavens and nine grades of the holy Dao. At the Chiming kalpa, it is the Dongxuan Lingbao True Lord; next born in the Supreme Clarity twelve true heavens, transmitting the true Dao; he together with the Silent Heavenly Emperor Primordial Lord, the Unarrogant Heavenly Emperor Supreme Origin Sovereign, and the Resonant Heavenly Emperor Void Sovereign Jade Emperor, each teaching the three heavens and nine grades of the true Dao. At the Shanghuang kalpa, it is the Shenbao Dongshen Immortal Lord; next born in the Great Clarity twelve immortal heavens, transmitting the immortal Dao; he together with Brahma Heavenly Emperor Wanshi Lord, Qingming Heavenly Emperor Purple Void Sovereign, and the Unaffectionate Heavenly Emperor Supreme True Five Sovereigns, each teaching the three heavens and nine grades of the immortal Dao. This is the Highest Saint transmitting his Dao. Regarding the Middle True transmitting virtue, in the Taiyi era the Great Emperor Lord was instructed; in the Taishi era the Heavenly Emperor Lord Lingyangzi was instructed; in the Taichu era the Taiwei Emperor Lord was instructed; in the Taiji era the Taiwei Heavenly Emperor Lord was instructed; in the Taisu era, the Golden Gate Late Saint Taiping Li True Lord, Prime Minister Su Tong Lord, Prime Minister Qing Tong Lord, and the Nine Mysterious Emperor Lord were instructed. This is the Middle True transmitting virtue. Regarding the Lower Realm transmitting scriptures, it corresponds to the twelve branches of methods: First, this text, proclaimed by the Three Caverns; Second, the divine talisman, for proclamation and trust; Third, the jade secret, showing no doubts or difficulties; Fourth, the spiritual diagram, illustrating the good appearances; Fifth, the genealogical register, recording transmission through the ages; Sixth, the precepts and disciplines, guarding against wrong and forbidding evil; Seventh, the dignified conduct, the school sequences and regulations; Eighth, the method, for cultivation and restraint; Ninth, the arts and numbers, secret and noble in form; Tenth, the records and transmissions, instructing the learners; Eleventh, the eulogies, singing the holy virtues; Twelfth, the memorials and petitions, for request and report. The Three Caverns’ thorough insight and response certify the three vehicles; the accumulation of merits certifies the fruits differently. According to the worthiness of merit, ascend to various heavens; the heavens’ retributions follow the sutras for certification, the thirty-six divisions certify the grades for heavenly birth, and the thirty-six heavens, according to the sutra cultivation grades, ascend to certify the Dao fruits; having aroused cultivation, liberation depends on conditions, naturally right in nature."

The Yellow Emperor bowed twice again and further inquired: "The thirty-six divisions, the three grades responding to conditions; the thirty-six heavens, following the sutra cultivation grades; the sutras certify heavenly grades; birth according to sutra, three grades responding to sutras—do the mundane feelings, dim and weak, yet unaware of the Dao source, certify the grades in a unified manner?"

Lord Yu replied: "The scriptures and methods of the Three Caverns, the heavenly lords’ manifestations, and the responsive birth all proceed from appearances established. The body’s light shines through, illuminating the great void; the realms of heaven and man all receive their planting. The Three Treasures correspond with images, the nine emperors’ winged forms; the subtle existence communicates nourishment, thus forming the divine consciousness. The spirit is clear and intelligence bright; the will reflects wisdom; when qi is turbid and the spirit dark, confusion arises. The body is in accord with the great Dao; the realms communicate with mystery; in still meditation, body and spirit unite in the Three Pure Ones’ cavern. The eight scenes recommend and support, establishing the cloud-carriage; the nine heavens’ winged form quietly ascends the pure realm. The thirty-six divisions illuminate the body; the thirty-six heavens, thoughts follow the mind’s control. Hear attentively my words, then I will explain to you."

Lord Ning told the Yellow Emperor: "The supreme Dao has no image, no form, no name; from the root descends the trace, gradually revealing three bodies. From the arising of three bodies, the Three Caverns unfold; the three realms and three boundaries, mundane and holy manifest differences. The nine heavens and nine persons correspond with images, communicating throughout. The Three Treasures gradually accumulate; the three vehicles receive birth; all arise as the Dharma body, with body light and good appearance. The three bodies have good appearances, the realms manifest their forms; the responsive heavens and men jointly nurture their images; all proceed from good appearance, planting their spirit; above they receive mysterious essence, thus forming subtle function.

The first Dharma body is profound and subtle, truly one wondrous wisdom; pure and unobstructed. Above it reveals the Dharma body, thirty-six gates; it responds and communicates the Three Caverns’ thirty-six images, the upper and lower cohere in seventy-two images.

The second responsive body manifests form and appearance; three realms and three boundaries, perfect above and below; descending qi generates spirit, thus forming spiritual consciousness; boundless merits and virtues, retributions in fortune complete for men and heavens; responding to karma and conditions; according to merit certifying residence; above manifesting three realms and thirty-six heavens; below corresponding to three boundaries and thirty-six emperors; upper and lower correspond; seventy-two images.

The third transformation body opens and transforms human and spirit, all containing the Three Caverns; nine qi generate and nurture; imitating heaven and earth; united as spiritual consciousness; internally manifesting transformation body’s thirty-six images; externally showing the living man’s thirty-six images; inner and outer cohere; seventy-two images. The thirty-six divisions are the source without form; from principle are words entrusted, enabling the measurement of principle, producing responsive realms, fortunes complete in all directions. Returning to root and origin, to establish ranks and grades, certifying fruit and advancing position, transcending and ascending the Great Luo; embodying and understanding the great Dao; entering the true actuality; perfect and pure; benefiting all common people; skilfully opening expedients; demonstrating the conditioned law; universally producing subtle function; thus awakening consciousness and spirit, myriad transformations responding to conditions, one image of emptiness and stillness."

Lord Ning told the Yellow Emperor: "The profound and silent Dharma body produces empty caves; within the empty cave arises the Great Source; the Great Source’s transformation produces the three qi. The upper qi is called 'beginning'; the middle qi is called 'origin'; the lower qi is called 'mystery.' The mysterious qi is born of the origin; the origin qi is born of the beginning; this is the root of qi, the ancestor before the Image Emperor; therefore it is called the Mysterious Origin Primal Qi. The Mysterious Origin Primal Qi is the root of the three realms, responding above to the three realms, establishing the Three Lords; the middle produces the three boundaries; the three vehicles receive and guide, united as the Three Origins, producing the three officials of man. Therefore these three qi manifest successively, producing life’s myriad beings; the root and origin are primary."

Lord Ning told the Yellow Emperor: "Within the Three Pure Heavens, the Mysterious Origin Primal Qi combines three and five, transforming into the Eight Scenic Spirits, each producing the Eight Directions, thus the Twenty-Four Emperors. Above are the Three Pure Ones’ Twenty-Four Palaces, the Purple Void Immortal Mansion; descending are the Four Brahmas, the Four Eight Transformations; each corresponds to the Three Realms’ Twenty-Four Palaces, universally forming one heaven’s twenty-four qi producing the human body's twenty-four forms. Therefore the Three Origins, Three Divisions, Eight Scenes, and Twenty-Four Emperors; each emperor has three origins, each origin has five spirits, uniting to three hundred and sixty spirits. Six six clans, combining qi to produce spirit; above are the Three Pure Ones’ sixty-four Brahma qi; two six combine to thirty-two; descending to produce the Three Realms’ thirty-two heavens; universal one heaven’s thirty-two emperors. The Twenty-Eight Mansions, the Xuanji and Yuheng, thus producing one day’s three hundred and sixty degrees; one month’s three hundred and sixty hours; one earth’s three hundred and sixty famous mountains; and one person’s three hundred and sixty bones."

Lord Ning told the Yellow Emperor: "The Mysterious Origin Primal Qi combines to produce nine qi; therefore nine emperors. Above are the nine heavens; the middle produces nine heavens; below are nine earths. The various heavens’ nine saints all possess form and spirit; producing the nine gates of man, inheriting the Dao and establishing life. Also producing the earth’s nine divisions; the nine wildernesses divide the directions; above connecting the Five Emperors; the four movements and sequences; the nine qi arrayed correctly; yin and yang and the five elements; people and species all receive birth and growth."

Lord Ning told the Yellow Emperor: "The Three Pure Ones’ nine heavens each produce eight directions, thus the seventy-two officials. The Three Origins each have twenty-four emperors; above are the twenty-four true, middle the twenty-four spirits, below the twenty-four births. The Three Origins and Eight Scenes produce spirit clans, combining into nine palaces, eighty-one in number; universally producing the heavens’ eighty-one divisions, universally producing the earth’s eighty-one domains, internally producing the human body’s eighty-one joints."

Lord Ning told the Yellow Emperor: "The Orthodox Great Dao issues from the True Emperor; the Orthodox Profound True produces the Great Spirit; the Three Origins resolve transformation, thus all that is born from the One. Therefore the Mysterious Merit returns to the One; all things arise therefrom; this is the ancestor of the supreme Dao, the root and beginning of original qi. From the root descends trace, universally planting form and spirit; through namelessness establishing names; entrusting names to interpret namelessness; communicating as realms; responding to qi generating spirit. The Three Caverns communicate transformation, thus forming the Heavenly Lords of the Three Dukes; the Nine Heavens communicate transformation, thus forming the Heavenly Lords of the Nine Ministers; the Immortals, True Ones, and Holy Positions each certify nine grades; thus there are three nines, twenty-seven positions; thus there are Heavenly Lords of the twenty-seven great officials; the Nine Heavens at first constructed, above and below overlapping; and their divisions respond, thus numbering the eight directions; thus there are eighty-one positions; thus there are Heavenly Lords of the eighty-one prime spirits. Communicating the Three Dukes, Nine Ministers, Twenty-Seven Officials, and Eighty-One Prime Spirits, each producing qi and images, thus there are Heavenly Lords of the one hundred and twenty counties. Further, within the one hundred and twenty counties are five offices inside, five officials outside; each producing ten spirits; combined as Heavenly Lords of twelve hundred county officials. Further, within the twelve hundred counties, each has three origins, each origin has five villages; thus are Heavenly Lords of eighteen thousand villages. Further, within the eighteen thousand villages, each receives five qi, thus forming five heavenly pavilions; thus are Heavenly Lords of thirty-six thousand pavilions. Further, within the thirty-six thousand pavilions, each pavilion has five guards; combined as Heavenly Lords of one hundred and eighty thousand guards. Thus these officials and subordinates universally produce all heavens, also complete the spirits of man; each receiving qi and images, all well established and planted; purple gates and jade mansions, thirty-six thousand joints; root and origin, the beginning of all spirits born at one time."

Lord Ning told the Yellow Emperor: "I formerly received from the Jade Emperor the Opening Heaven Supreme Scripture, the root and beginning of myriad transformations of the Three Caverns’ method; descending to produce realms and plant forms and spirits; responding and inspiring myriad spirits; universally receiving officials and subordinates. The Three Pure Ones’ upper realm is the Three Caverns’ mysterious root; below are born the Three Realms; two scenes combine; four sequences govern the movements; five qi successively rise; the number of one hundred and six interlock; kalpas have birth and destruction; heavens’ lifespans differ in height; according to merit certifying retribution, differences appear. Therefore unfolding the Three Caverns, the Dao Lord proclaims, when worthy appear, he leads them across, opening and receiving through kalpas. Now you inquire about the sequence of births; listen carefully to my words, I will show you the precious secret. The primal origin opens transformation, penetrating heaven and man; the body produces good appearance; the realm receives planting, emptiness and non-being respond with form; entrusting images to establish words; arising from conditions to cultivate; thus one ascends the void and stillness; the Three Caverns lead and receive; nine grades descend in order; wondrously supreme is the source of the Dao; darkly communicating the profound unity; embodying and resolving the vastness; consciousness clear and wisdom subtle; the Three Pure Ones’ wondrous gates look down and respond here."

Lord Ning told the Yellow Emperor: "I formerly received from the Great Emperor, formerly at the first kalpa, Dragonhan opened the diagram; within the Qi chaos, ten names transform and incarnate; entrusting traces to the heavens; establishing the Dharma; departing from words to speak the Dao. The obstruction of heaven produces the celestial ferry and the supreme among heavens; formlessly transforming in the Great Luo Heaven’s Bright Mist Pavilion; thus unfolding the Three Caverns and thirty-six divisions; descending to produce the three realms and thirty-six heavens. The Three Caverns’ method is the root of myriad practices; descending to produce the Three Realms, grades and species take form; below the eight directions each produces five hundred and fifty-five billion and five hundred and fifty-five million and five hundred and fifty-five thousand and fifty-five divisions; the Infinite Three Realms correspond to earth and other heavens; the eight directions all have three thousand great thousand worlds. The Infinite Three Realms all receive the Three Pure Ones; the Three Origins above and below, thirty-six heavens; each heaven four directions; four nine arranged positions; above responding to the Heavenly Pivot’s thirty-six gates; universally forming the earthly thirty-six sounds; within one dust are thirty-six qi; heaven and man correspond; all realms communicate. The thirty-six earthly images correspond and respond; the Three Caverns communicate transformation; mundane and holy differ; inspirations and responses vary. There are nine kinds: Above and below holy teachings; above communicating to Jade Clarity; middle and upper true teachings; next communicating to Supreme Clarity; lower and upper immortal teachings; next communicating to Great Clarity; above and middle holy teachings; next communicating to Colorless; middle and middle true teachings; next communicating to Colored Heavens; lower and middle immortal teachings; next communicating to Desire Realm; above and lower holy teachings; below connecting to sharp roots; middle and lower true teachings; below connecting to medium roots; lower and lower immortal teachings; below connecting to dull roots. Three vehicles gradually unfold; the three roots differ; three realms of heaven and man; the Three Treasures receive and guide; the Three Pure Ones’ holy teachings; the Three Caverns’ mysterious steps; the Emperor’s Dao village; the broad principle of emptiness and vastness; communicating wondrous existence in various heavens and good steps."

The nature of the Dao is vacuous and condensed; neither birth nor death; neither coming nor going; manifesting myriad wondrous gates; faintly following and welcoming; revealing the true Dharma. The heavens receive joy; from arising cultivation; due to conditions and karma; root and fruit beginning; certifying fruit and transcending; following these six gates. Compassion, kindness, goodness, patience; all four degrees complete; feminine softness, diligence, trust; admonitions and remonstrances cease; indulging in virtue; the mind abandons non-virtue; thoughts increase and expand; blessings, virtue, and wisdom flourish; heavenly eyes clearly understand; discerning without form or thought. When thoughts depart, color and form disappear; abandoning consciousness and increasing cultivation; no labour. Already without action; forgetting all dust; transcending birth and death of the world; reaching the four human realms; lifespan and blessing unaffected by kalpa; transformation bodies entrusted below to save the mundane; accumulating merit and advancing; ascending the mysterious to certify fruits. Again ascending the four Brahmas; gradually ascending the Great Clarity; entering the Nine Immortals; next ascending the Supreme Clarity; entering the Nine True Ones; next ascending Jade Clarity; ascending the Nine Saints; ascending to Highest Saint and Great Highest Saint fruit; merit fills fully; ascending the Dao into non-being; forgetting merit and fruit; naturally right in nature; mixed with Dao; darkly assembling with the empty sky Heavenly Lord; throughout body in enduring stillness."

Lord Ning said: "The Three Caverns open transformation, universally planting heaven and man; all officials and subordinates all receive and accept; there is the master of produced things; formless but ever lasting; realms and responsive bodies are all Heavenly Emperors; universally they are the upper and lower thirty-six heavenly lords. Also within the earthly thirty-six sounds, they govern the various heavenly worlds; communicating and containing the thirty-six emperors; forms beneath and earth above directions; communicating and managing the thirty-six sound qi and thirty-six divisions; universally crossing the boundless thirty-six heavens; ascending and advancing ranks and grades. The Three Pure Saints’ wondrous stillness is ever constant; the Three Realms, Nine Earths, Four Movements are swift in their course. The Three Realms’ kalpas perish; chaos without birth; the Three Pure Ones and Three Treasures again descend original qi; each kalpa re-creates; the three qi are the root; the Three Treasures universally arise; the nine movements differ. Therefore the Colorless Realm’s Supreme Origin pinnacle heaven; its heavenly qi intersects three thousand three hundred and thirty degrees; small Yang Nine, small hundred and six; its heavenly qi intersects six thousand six hundred and sixty degrees; middle Yang Nine, middle hundred and six; its heavenly qi intersects nine thousand nine hundred and ninety degrees; great Yang Nine, great hundred and six. Colored Desire Lower Realm and Above differ; lower is short; upper is long; years and months differ. Above, the colorless small Yang Nine; next below, the colored middle Yang Nine; below, the desire realm great Yang Nine. Below the desire realm, ten thousand kalpas equally vanish; below the colored realm, hundreds of times kalpa destruction; above the colorless realm, one time universal extinction. Also within the desire realm, the nine soils differ; heaven and earth intersect three thousand three hundred and thirty degrees; the three soils decline; water, fire, war, and sickness; famine and starvation; six thousand six hundred and sixty degrees, six soils suffer harm; nine thousand nine hundred and ninety degrees, nine soils all impaired. Therefore the manifest Great Unity distributes the qi and circulates; the Grand Duke’s palace qi alternates harmoniously; pervading families and states; inwardly reaching the human body; wherever the palace goes, according to spirit illness; three periods of adverse and favorable; interlaced eight directions; thirty-six years with twelve full cycles; this is the small assembly; accumulated numbers cause disaster; reading this scripture turns away these calamities. Large and small kalpa assemblies; nine qi end times; karma and fruit uncertain; upper and lower retributions differ."

### The Three Caverns’ Universal Birth and Original Arrangement, The Second Chapter

At that time the Yellow Emperor bowed and worshipped Lord Ning, requesting to inquire about the Three Caverns’ honored scriptures’ three grades transmitting the Dao. After the opening discourse, he again respectfully bowed and requested instruction, saying: "The Three Caverns’ honored scriptures give birth above to three realms and thirty-six heavens; the thirty-six divisions having been born; each realm has thirty-six heavens; are the thirty-six heavens also the thirty-six divisions?"

Lord Ning answered: "The Mysterious Origin Primal Qi is the root of the three realms; the thirty-six divisions produce heavenly law residences; the Three Caverns’ descending virtue is the lord of heaven and man birth; the nine saints universally transform as the root of the Image Emperor; the thirty-six divisions are the gate of birth for realms; the thirty-six heavens are the ladder grades for entering the Dao. Therefore, by means of the scripture one is guided and instructed; clarifying qi images to communicate with the scripture; opening the path to verify the Dao village; relying on verification and cultivation to ascend to holy fruit; purifying body and spirit to communicate with Dao realm; cultivating covenants to dispel deluded feelings. The thirty-six divisions of cavern observation all attend; the thirty-six heavens respond and move with the mind’s direction; the Three Pure Ones’ upper realm, lower realm response; the rise and fall of three realms is laborious at the mind’s head; grades and ranks differ; thus establishing realm names according to roots and responses. There are five kinds; listen attentively to my words, then I will explain."

Lord Ning told the Yellow Emperor: "I formerly received from the Dao Lord, the King of Transformation; the supreme among heavens; all fully received. Initially descending the wondrous One, holy transformation was first; beginning birth in the Origin; the Origin communicates the true Dao; the Origin is born of the Mysterious; the Mysterious governs the immortal teaching. The immortal, true, and holy positions, Three Caverns’ mysterious lords; the Three Treasures establish positions; the three titles also differ. Therefore at Dragonhan’s first time, Yuanshi opened the diagram; he is the Jade Clarity Heavenly Treasure Holy Lord; entitled the Great Cavern Formless Heavenly Lord; and proclaims the Great Cavern’s twelve division scripture; teaching the Jade Clarity twelve holy heavens. Next at the Chiming kalpa, he is the Supreme Clarity Lingbao True Lord; titled the Cavern Mysterious Nameless Heavenly Lord; and proclaims the Dongxuan twelve division scripture; teaching the Supreme Clarity twelve true heavens. Next at the Shanghuang kalpa, he is the Great Clarity Shenbao Immortal Lord; titled the Cave Spirit Primordial Heavenly Lord; and proclaims the Dongshen twelve division scripture; teaching the Great Clarity twelve immortal heavens. The thirty-six divisions of scripture are born in all heavens; heaven and man observe and receive; thus named the three realms. The three vehicles gradually unfold and guide; opening and leading worthy across; responsive bodies descend and receive; through successive ages teaching and transforming; the heavenly lords universally communicate the Three Caverns’ treasured scriptures; manifesting according to directions."

Lord Ning told the Yellow Emperor: "The Primal Origin responsive body, seventy-two images; above born in three realms; below born in three boundaries; all receive the Three Caverns; grades and species take form; producing heavenly origin; thus called Heavenly Lord. Thirty-six divisions of heavenly lords; transformation body within three realms; the Three Treasures receive birth; response and inspiration differ; thus are the Origin, Color, and Desire realms. Also for sentient beings’ root natures are uneven; though the same heaven, all have five kinds: One, the Three Caverns Three Realms; Two, the responsive transformation Three Realms; Three, returning from the Three Realms; Four, flowing into the Three Realms; Five, cycling through the Three Realms. Firstly, the ancient Two Caverns Three Realms, thirty-six divisions; above born in three realms and thirty-six heavens; middle born in three boundaries and thirty-six emperors; below born in nine fortress and thirty-six earth sovereigns; heaven and men correspond; three vehicles guide and receive; essence and qi connect; all receive the Three Caverns; good lent birth. Secondly, the responsive transformation Three Realms; three divisions and eight scenes; corresponding to yin and yang; four seasons changing; manifesting birth and old age. Thirdly, returning from the Three Realms; the supreme Dao sublime qi; nourishing life spirit; though dwelling in attachment, not defiled; cutting off all mundane gates; returning beyond this worldly dust; solitary transcendence of the supreme Dao. Fourthly, flowing into the Three Realms; from the Dao’s wondrous root; entrusting yin and yang; form defiled by six emotions; manifesting arising and attachment; good follows good; evil follows evil; turning and seeing retribution; entering good and evil gates. Fifthly, cycling through the Three Realms; attachment and affliction arise; falling into three paths; cycling through evil paths; unable to escape; eternally sinking in the sea of suffering; long immersed in love and desire."

Lord Ning told the Yellow Emperor: "The primal origin responsive body unfolds the Three Caverns honored scriptures; communicating and completing realms; leading and guiding ranks; no existing to non-existing; opening transformation of heaven and man; causing ascent to original form; entering empty understanding; above manifesting three realms; the Three Caverns communicate method; below born in three boundaries; responding and inspiring in three kinds: One is vast emptiness; Two is matter hindering form and color; Three is reasoning mind body. Speaking of the first, vast emptiness: emptiness and hollow Dao qi, mixed and transformed great void; responding with images established as non-being, thus forming realms; mountains, rivers, stones, walls, steep and secluded, upright, beautiful and ugly; all regarded as attachments; heaven, man, and six paths respond and see origin; thus it is called the first vast emptiness. Speaking of matter hindering form and color: responding and transforming the three realms and thirty-two heavens; born of yin and yang; forming bodies; from the Dao’s wondrous One; good lends birth and nourishment; entrusting womb and fetus; earthly parents; halves joined; holding form; equipped with roots; this is the color aggregation; once roots accomplish, produce six kinds of consciousness and arise discrimination; this is consciousness aggregation; once illusory aggregates of dust and discrimination take false forms; arise attachment; this is image aggregation; when image aggregation reverses, illusory hatred and love arise; this is action aggregation; once observing aggregation forming, illusory thought firmly established; holding views of ignorance; arise evil deeds; sinking into the three paths; unable to escape; thus named matter hindering form and color. Speaking of reasoning mind body: the body is retribution; arising from karma and conditions; good wisdom returns to Dao and root; ignorance, turbid disgrace wandering evil paths; according to their retributions and responses; seeing the six desires and four minds; thus called reasoning mind body. Therefore explaining three realms’ differing response and retribution varying; and there are five kinds: One, not yet entering the three realms’ bonds; though born in their domain, not from the three realms; arising from birth and death; above born in the Four Man Heavens. Two, responding and born of colorless karma; above exiting color and desire; like the four light dusts abandoning consciousness; increasing cultivation of illusory form and spirit purified. Three, responding and born of color realm karma; for color is deep and heavy; gradually abandoning six dusts and three degrees; heavily abandoning the eighteen heavens’ retribution. Four, responding and born of desire realm karma; six desires attachment; thus responding to the six heavens. Five, responding and born of the three evil paths’ karma; attachment to the six desires; the three poisons arise; falling to animal, hungry ghost, and hell paths."

### The Universal Officials’ Original Arrangement, The Third Chapter

Lord Ning told the Yellow Emperor: "The Primal Origin Heavenly Lord formerly in the Great Luo Heaven Bright Mist Pavilion manifested realms, unfolding the Three Caverns and thirty-six divisions. The Great Cavern highest twelve division scripture possesses the merit of the Three Caverns’ thirty-six honored scriptures. Why is this? The Great Cavern’s holy teaching penetrates true life and immortality; comprehending all scriptures’ officials and subordinates; thus there are Dongxuan and Dongshen; thirty-six divisions’ highest merit. The Dongxuan division is not as high; only communicating below and taking in Dongshen; thus there are twenty-four divisions of true immortals’ power. The Dongshen Immortal scripture is not as high; only possessing Dongshen’s twelve division scripture’s immortal birth merit. The Three Caverns’ response and transformation communicate the root of birth; the Three Treasures receive and guide; coarse and subtle differ. From the Dao’s wondrous qi; descending traces to generate spirits; no existing to non-existing; possession and non-possession; embodying the great Dao; arousing the supreme mind; liberating from non-action; always joyful and truthful. Dongxuan true teaching, middle vehicle responding to conditions; descending saints to true; communicating mystery and entering subtlety; therefore speaking of response and transformation; opening expedient gates; knowing existence and non-existence; from existence starting cultivation; no love or defiled mind; departing from conditioned realms; cultivating right observation; abiding in the middle path. Dongshen Immortal teaching, entrusting causes and conditions; thus establishing realms of heavenly officials; opening transformation of human spirits; establishing various Dharma. The Three Treasures communicate transformation; immortals are birth gates; from birth arise cultivation; entering the non-form body. Thus manifest response and transformation; immortal yang gives birth first; from birth ascend immortal; from immortal ascend true; from true ascend saint; from saint ascend Dao. The Three Caverns’ wondrous existence takes qi as root; root arises from beginning; beginning arises from origin; origin arises from mystery. The beginning qi communicates saints; above born in Jade Clarity; origin qi governs truth; middle born in Supreme Clarity; mystery governs immortal teaching; below born in Great Clarity. The Three Pure Ones respond with images; the Three Treasures universally attend; the thirty-six divisions teach heaven; the thirty-six heavens are the Three Caverns’ roots; the Three Realms receive qi; responding to realms cultivate grades; seventy-two images; realms manifest forms; eighty-one excellences; manifesting great abundance. Therefore at Dragonhan kalpa, titled Formless Heavenly Lord; responding as Jade Clarity Heavenly Treasure Holy Lord; called the Great Cavern’s Sovereign Jade Emperor; born with ninety-nine trillion nine hundred ninety-nine billion nine hundred ninety-nine million nine hundred ninety-nine thousand nine hundred ninety-nine qi; each qi gives birth to ninety-nine trillion nine hundred ninety-nine billion nine hundred ninety-nine million nine hundred ninety-nine li; each qi gives birth to ninety-nine trillion nine hundred ninety-nine billion nine hundred ninety-nine million nine hundred ninety-nine years; years and li numbers conclude, calendar divisions unite; descending to communicate with three realms; thus called great kalpa. Next at Chiming kalpa, titled Nameless Heavenly Lord; responding as Supreme Clarity Lingbao True Lord; the Dongxuan honored lord; born with ninety-nine million nine hundred ninety-nine thousand nine hundred ninety-nine qi; each qi gives birth to ninety-nine thousand nine hundred ninety li; each qi gives birth to ninety-nine thousand nine hundred ninety million years; years and li numbers conclude; calendar divisions unite; descending to communicate with three realms; thus called middle kalpa. Next at Shanghuang kalpa, titled Primal Origin Heavenly Lord; the Dongshen honored spirit; born with ninety-nine million nine hundred ninety thousand qi; each qi gives birth to ninety-nine thousand nine hundred ninety li; each qi gives birth to ninety-nine thousand nine hundred ninety million years; years and li numbers conclude; calendar divisions unite; descending to communicate with three realms; thus called small kalpa. The Heavenly Lord said: 'Now I manifest as form; realms communicate with body; above manifesting heavens; below responding to myriad images; through kalpas appearing and transforming; opening deliverance to countless beings. Those possessing Dao and worth descend as masters to teach; or born in lower realms; mixing with things obscurely; entrusting form to communicate with mundane; sinking and floating indistinguishable; communicating and transforming the Dao; receiving conditions and causes; to accept this scripture; causing opening of wisdom and understanding; secretly acting to save and deliver; not relying on grace; intent pure and spirit clear; to proclaim this Dharma.'

Lord Ning again told the Yellow Emperor: "The Three Pure Ones’ nine emperors, eight scenes communicating directions; born in three realms; communicating to lead and guide; descending to the three realms; grades and species take form; opening heaven and man; jointly receiving officials and subordinates. Therefore the Mysterious Origin Primal Qi each produces eight scenes and forms twenty-four emperors; nine heavens each produce eight scenes forming seventy-two officials. The twenty-four emperors transform into twenty-four spirits; twenty-four spirits transform into twenty-four qi; qi also forms spirits; spirits also form qi; scattering as clouds and mist; gathering as forms and shadows; issuing as creation; entering as true unity; above connecting the Three Origins; speaking to connect myriad things. Spirit and true transformation have no fixed name; among the hundred spirits all are formed by three combinations producing virtue. Heaven and earth’s extreme above realm’s twenty-four emperors; below are the three realms’ twenty-four qi. The twenty-four emperors each have three origins; each origin has five spirits; together producing three hundred and sixty spirits; mixing through the three realms’ three hundred and sixty spirits; each producing one heaven’s three hundred and sixty palaces; each producing one year’s three hundred and sixty days; also producing one person’s three hundred and sixty bones; universally producing one earth’s three hundred and sixty famous mountains. Below communicating with heavenly qi, eight scenes attend; above pouring out birth and nourishment; combining qi and planting together. The Infinite Three Realms universally receive this root; heaven and man correspond; myriad realms communicate and connect. The eight scenes open transformation; responding images establish root; twenty-four emperors above produce three hundred and sixty spirits; six positions complete; combining into sixty-four Brahma qi. Six positions combine; thirty-two; thirty-two years; one heavenly cycle. Thus clarifying the three realms’ thirty-two heavens. The Three Pure Ones’ nine qi connect above and below; surrounding and linking the Xuanji; the four movements brightly clear. The Three Caverns’ heavenly calendar; years are three origins; six positions of yang days; six fasting months. The eight scenes communicate motion; eight solar terms cultivate gates; ten straight days greet the lord; cultivating ten virtues. Burning incense and reciting prayers; meriting response of heavens; lamps continue brightness; lifting life and saving death; incense, flowers, jeweled parasols; offerings to the heavens; turning to read honored scriptures; causing wisdom comprehension; above repenting seven ancestral generations’ accumulated calamities; below including spirits jointly nurturing Dharma grace. The Three Pure Ones’ host saints look down upon sincere cinnabar; the three realms’ palaces simultaneously supervise jade brightness. The three palaces are pure and clean; nine gates round and bright; five viscera clearly understood; six palaces communicating wisdom. Eighty-one excellences; light produced at eighty-one hinge points; thirty-two images; illuminating three hundred and sixty bones; thirty-two emperors manifesting profound emptiness; thirty-six heavens manifesting summit appearance. The eight scenes fully guard; nine heavens winged forms; driving scenes and chariots; ascending to Jade Clarity."

Lord Ning told the Yellow Emperor: "The Great Dao produces transformation; nothing is not communicated; great encompassing with no outside; finely entering without interval; nothing does not receive; primordial things do not arise; nothing does not measure; nothing does not accomplish. Opening the vast void; dividing into ten grades; from above Great Luo down to the Three Pure Ones; thus seven parts; above and surrounding universally; all complete the vast void; as the Dao realm. Therefore, on Xuandu Jade Capital Mountain, there are seven perception qi. Below Great Luo, the three realms arise; combined as seven parts; surrounding all the vast void; communicating as holy realms. Furthermore, the Three Pure Ones and eight directions, each below again dividing as one part; producing earthly five hundred billion, fifty trillion, five thousand billion, five hundred billion, fifty billion, five billion and five hundred million, etc. The Infinite Three Realms all respond to five qi and five movements producing transformation; thus communicating heaven and earth’s fifty-five numbers. The Three Origins above and below all combine the Three Caverns communicating the Nine Emperors and Twelve Heavens; totally combining the Three Origins’ thirty-six emperors. The central and eight directions universally receive the Three Pure Ones; only responding to four seasons and thirty-two heavens and three hundred and sixty degrees; thus forming the Twenty-Eight Mansions. The five movements produce transformation; though responding to the Dao’s root; divisions correspond to the mundane; from above the eighth part. Furthermore, below each in the Infinite Three Realms, again dividing as one part; forming the nine fortress and thirty-six earth sovereigns; all receiving the Three Realms; above connecting the Three Pure Ones; each year’s eight solar terms and four seasons days; recording humans’ good and evil; reporting above to the Three Pure Ones; good and evil, crime and blessing; above and below calculating assemblies; this corresponds to the ninth part above. Furthermore, below the nine fortresses, are eight gates and nine hells; above is the Yang examination; below presides Yin punishment; above and below each nine; also called the eighteen great hells. Below this hell is the great wind marsh’s qi; seeming wind but not wind; seeming water but not water; consciousness suffers dullness; cannot distinguish; supporting the earth’s wheel; entirely without overturning; this corresponds to the tenth part above."

Lord Ning told the Yellow Emperor: "The Three Caverns communicate transformation; nine qi mixed birth; heaven has thirty-six officers; earth has thirty-six departments. The three realms descend; nine qi communicate birth; the nine fortresses rise; the three realms communicate response. One heaven’s realm; two scenes combine brightness; three lights attend; four sequences all complete; Xuanji mixed; governing Miluo; widely covering life and spirit; responsive qi matures. The heavenly calendar governs cycles and degrees, mysterious gates; nine fortresses’ earth gods each correspond to earth. The Grand Duke, Great Yin, and great general; the yearly virtue establishes breakage gods. If there are practitioners cultivating the Three Caverns and Three Pure Ones’ supreme scriptures; they should diligently respect the nine earths’ spirits and deities below; not to do harm. Therefore the first earth is named Yuande; its qi is upper blue and middle yellow; governed by the Prime Earth Official; thick eleven thousand one hundred and ten li; earth officials all manage within. The second earth is Huangde; its qi communicates black; governed by the Prime Court Earth Assistant; earth officials also manage within. The third earth is Dide; its qi communicates blue; governed by the Tiger Mouth Earth Dragon; earth officials also manage within. The fourth earth is Wangde; its qi communicates yellow; governed by the Prime Heart Earth General. The fifth earth is Rende; its qi communicates red; governed by the Prime Fortune Earth Magistrate. The sixth earth is Dide; its qi communicates white; governed by the Prime Bone Earth Chief. The seventh earth is Lide; its qi communicates purple; governed by the Beginning Jia six parents. The eighth earth is Fude; its qi communicates blue; governed by the Beginning Worthy Earth Clan Chief. The ninth earth is Changde; its qi communicates green; governed by Xuan’s Beginning Earth with Two Thousand Stones below. The nine earth officers each govern earth offices; above connecting the earthly twelve divine officers."

### The Supreme Dao Dharma Body Responsive Birth and Good Appearance Original Arrangement, The Fourth Chapter

At that time the Yellow Emperor ascended Yuntai Mountain, worshipped Lord Xiao, and inquired of the Three Caverns’ three grades opening deliverance and receiving heaven and man; next asked of the Three Treasures’ universal birth realms; again asked how realms communicate births to heaven and man; how man communicates Dao birth; birth communicates Dao body; Dao communicates with no outside; universally equipped with form and spirit; the supreme Dao is impartial; how does transformation differ?

Lord Ning told the Yellow Emperor: "The Three Caverns, nine emperors, nine heavens’ birth gates; Immortals, True Ones, and Holy Positions each have nine grades and twenty-seven positions. The Three Caverns’ grades and ranks ascend from mundane to immortal; eighty-one ranks; originally three realms’ delusion and darkness uneven; therefore establishing three vehicles as ladder ranks. The supreme Dao Jade Emperor’s merit fills all directions; therefore establishing the Three Treasures; the Three Lords differ; responses manifest three bodies; three bodies each differ. Therefore at Dragonhan kalpa, responding with holy teaching; titled Formless Heavenly Lord; at Chiming kalpa, responding with true teaching; titled Nameless Heavenly Lord; at Shanghuang kalpa, responding with immortal teaching; titled Primal Origin Heavenly Lord. The Three Treasures respond with teachings; the three vehicles differ; transformation Dharma bodies; root and trace also differ. Formerly at the first kalpa Dragonhan, opened the diagram within Great Luo Heaven Bright Mist Pavilion; unfolding the Three Caverns and thirty-six divisions; responding to realms, each having thirty-six heavens; internally unfolding ten names, chaos heaven origin. The Mysterious Origin Primal Qi corresponds to mysterious images; bright light shining through; nine colors with repeated radiance; eight scenes perfectly bright; producing good appearance; responding to realms; transformation body becoming man; human and heaven’s retributions differ; mundane and holy differ; three bodies have good appearances; top, middle, and lower differ; establishing human spirits; all receiving transformation bodies."

Lord Ning told the Yellow Emperor: "I formerly at the first kalpa, supreme Dao Jade Emperor, Formless Heavenly Lord, within Great Luo Heaven Bright Mist Pavilion, expounded the Three Caverns’ responsive birth ten names; set up nine emperors and established nine heavens; Immortal, True, and Holy Positions are the Three Treasures’ mysterious ferry; twenty-seven positions are the realms’ cultivation ranks; thirty-six divisions above are the three realms’ mysterious roots; below are the three realms’ thirty-six heavens’ responsive residences; seventy-two images; realms manifest forms; eighty-one excellences; human and heaven’s birth origin. Changes and transformations all complete the great thousand worlds; breathing and receiving responsive bodies; communicating birth to five hundred million. Infinite Three Realms surround boundlessly; realms communicating spirits; above and below all receive; each kalpa manifests; titles vary; successive transformations; honored titles differ. The first name is source; source is the root origin; the second is chaos; chaos is indistinguishable; the third is muddle; muddle is primal and great; the fourth is murky; murky is vast and obscure; the fifth is silent; silent is without limit; the sixth is mist; mist is like fine fog; the seventh is vastness; vastness is like surging waves; the eighth is beginning; beginning qi condenses at Great Luo; the ninth is origin; origin is chief of goodness; the tenth is mystery; mystery governs the upper heaven. Mystery beyond mystery; heaven’s supreme lord; title is Your Majesty; above is complete birth origin. Therefore Nameless Heavenly Lord; above from Great Luo’s eight name beginning qi; first born Jade Clarity; responding with holy teaching; Great Cavern Dharma Gate; next from Jade Clarity’s nine name origin qi; born below Supreme Clarity; responding with true teaching; Dongxuan Dharma Gate; next from Supreme Clarity’s ten name mystery qi; born below Great Clarity; responding with immortal teaching; Dongshen Dharma Gate. Furthermore, three realms below produce three boundaries; realms mutually respond; three vehicles differ; three realms lead and receive; three boundaries also differ. Jade Clarity’s holy realm; below connecting colorless; Supreme Clarity’s true realm; below connecting color realm; Great Clarity’s immortal realm; below connecting desire realm. Furthermore, the Three Caverns universally produce human spirits; heaven and man correspond; nine gates all peaceful. Jade Clarity holy realm; producing human upper one; above the Mud Pellet upper palace; Supreme Clarity true realm; producing human middle one; true is the Scarlet Palace; Great Clarity immortal realm; producing human lower one; Yellow Court immortal palace. Therefore human lower Yellow Court origin king; regarded as producing spirit, containing qi and life lord. Immortal Dao lord produces birth; according to birth cultivates. Immortal’s words are migration; migrating and ascending Great Clarity; migrating immortal entering true; ascending Supreme Clarity; migrating true entering saint; ascending Jade Clarity; migrating saint entering Dao; ascending Great Luo; the Supreme Dao realm; vast principle condensed obscurely."

### Primal Origin Responsive Manifestation of the Three Caverns’ Thirty-Six Images Original Arrangement, The Fifth Chapter

At that time the Yellow Emperor bowed and received Lord Ning; having expounded the Heavenly Lord’s opening transformation matters, he further inquired about the origin of births to heaven. The Mysterious Origin Primal Qi is the root of the three realms; descending to produce the three boundaries; myriad images fully complete; Heavenly Lord’s ten names; Three Caverns’ birth origin; three realms and three boundaries; universally receiving and inspiring. The Primal Origin descends transformation; manifestations complete heavens; where are the gates of form?

Therefore established the Heavenly Emperors; constructing birth ferries; for the great saints; and expounding the 'Supreme Opening Heaven Supreme Scripture'; seventy-two images; three kinds of responsive bodies; eighty-one excellences. Three degrees transformation bodies; descending from root to trace; gradually manifesting conditioned existence; thus manifesting Dharma body; further responsive body; further transformation body.

The Mysterious Origin Primal Qi is the Three Caverns’ root; thirty-six divisions; realm ladder grades; Jade Capital Mysterious Terrace; Three Caverns’ responses established; Purple Tenuity Golden Gate; nine qi communicating establishment. Therefore showing Dharma body to manifest heavenly form; responding and transforming to mundane; human and heaven certify residence. Three Caverns’ wondrous root; universally establishing body light; realms manifest form; responses arise from conditions. Wondrous eloquence without obstruction; this is called holy and true; highest and surpassing all; this is the image body.

Within this wondrous non-being; gradually manifesting responsive teaching; manifesting intention and spirit; next establishing will and spirit; further thoughts arise traces; responsive teaching begins use. Therefore from right wisdom; arises real wisdom; further, real wisdom; produces provisional wisdom; within this provisional wisdom; manifest the Three Treasures; essence, spirit, and qi. Essence is led by spiritual wisdom; spirit is unfathomable; changing power; qi is qi image; producing and completing use. The functions differ; therefore named three; the body cannot be divided; therefore named three-one. Within these three ones; again manifest three bodies; one is taking color and mind as body; two is taking the Three Caverns as body; three is taking wondrous virtue as body. Speaking of color and mind as body; silent earth itself; taking true one wondrous wisdom as body. Speaking of Three Caverns as body; cultivating progress in order; responding ranks establish origin; certifying fruit ascending position; broadly saving all; for great wisdom. Original color is burden; obstructing advancement law; nine saints return; all seek to advance ranks; having been hindered by desire burdens; also speaking of color; the true Dao’s burdens exhausted; only wondrous mind remains. Above certifying Dao fruit; possessing all virtues; silent and invisible; named wondrous non-being; moving, responding; possessing body with things; mind and color though wondrous; things are seen; therefore called wondrous being. According to position and retribution; form and pattern ascend mystery; advancing to highest saint; to highest saint fruit. Forgetting cause and fruit; naturally right in nature; united with the great Dao; mixed with things in darkness; highest surpassing none; first named Heavenly Lord. Therefore within Heavenly Lord gradually manifest responsive body; producing realms. The Mysterious Origin Primal Qi; widely equips body light; three qi transform form; thus unfolding Three Caverns. Beginning is blue light; above born in heaven; origin is white light; middle born in man; mystery is yellow light; below born in earth.

The thirty-two emperors surround and link the Xuanji; all are one heaven’s twenty-eight mansions. The nine heavens’ heavy fortresses also correspond to eight directions, earthly nine palaces. The four heavenly kings’ heavens above and below overlay; also the four directions’ four and eight lords. All receive the nine qi; halves mutually harmonize; root and trace united; thirty-six positions; thus are above and below overlapping thirty-six emperors. Heaven descends one qi; then five qi arise; entrusting yin and yang; combining qi to form body. Therefore yang has lesser yang and greater yang; yin has lesser yin and greater yin. Therefore within yang is yin for wood; within yang is yang for fire; within yin is yang for metal; within yin is yin for water; harmony within harmony for earth. Lesser yang’s qi each forms one heaven; all are eastern nine qi blue heavens; producing the Eastern Supreme Emperor Yellow Ancestor Heaven, Grand Bright Jade King; thus is orthodox unity.
