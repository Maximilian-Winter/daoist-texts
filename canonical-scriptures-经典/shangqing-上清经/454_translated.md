The Five Elders’ Jade Chapters are all books of void and nature, secreted within the Purple Tenuity Palace of the Nine Heavens’ Spiritual Capital, upon the Seven Treasures Mysterious Terrace, attending upon the Five Emperor Divine Officers, issued once every forty thousand kalpas according to the Mysterious Methods.

The “Primordial Beginning Cavernous Mysterious Spirit Treasure Red Writ Jade Chapters True Text” was born before the Primordial Beginning, within the void. Heaven and earth had no root; sun and moon gave no light; dim and obscure, without ancestor or lineage, the spiritual text was dense and obscure, sometimes existing, sometimes vanishing. The two forms awaited division; the great sun awaited to illuminate. The spiritual diagrams changed and turned, the mysterious phenomena shifted, taking advantage of opportunity to respond and meet, and thus it was preserved. Heaven and earth obtained it and were divided and judged; the Three Luminaries obtained it and shone forth. The spiritual text was luxuriant and elegant, penetrating the Upper Purity, issuing from the celestial blue heaven, its colours unbounded. The writing’s force twisted and turned, not to be traced in detail. The Primordial Beginning refined it in the Cavernous Yang Pavilion, smelt it in the Flowing Fire Courtyard; the text was fresh and bright, shining with radiance; the Cavernous Yang Qi was red, hence it was called the Red Writ. The spiritual diagrams then shone forth brilliantly; ten thousand emperors paid homage to the truth, flying in the void and stepping through the empty, circling the upper palace, burning incense and scattering flowers, chanting spiritual chapters. At that time twelve mysterious auspices descended from heaven, twenty-four responses issued from the earth; the upper rejoiced the mysteries of the nine heavens, the lower praised the precious text of the three heavens. The divine wind then blew, the august way was universally smooth; the Primordial Beginning ascended to the command, the Supreme Truth held the pen, the Jade Consort brushed the mat; casting gold into slips, engraving the Jade Chapters, the Five Elders took charge of the records, secreted within the Nine Heavens’ Spiritual Capital Palace. The Jade Maidens officiated the incense, Taihua held the handkerchief, Jade Youths attended and guarded, Jade Steps faced the pavilion, the Nine Heavens’ upper scriptures were not heard by ghosts or spirits. The celestial treasure was sent to produce floating; the earth’s secret secured repose; the Five Emperors held it to obtain pacification; the Three Luminaries rode it to attain brightness; the highest sages received it to reach truth; the Five Sacred Mountains followed it to attain spiritual power; the Son of Heaven obtained it to bring government; the country’s fate enjoyed it for great peace. Truly the spiritual text’s wondrous virtue is the mysterious root of heaven and earth. Its awe and efficacy are vast and boundless, spreading over infinite space, the great transformation, the source of divine illumination. Its measure cannot be fathomed, lofty and august is the great void.

The “Primordial Beginning Five Elders’ Red Writ Jade Chapters” issue forth from the void and nature, bringing forth heaven and earth, opening and transforming the divine illumination. Above it is called spirit, imposing and pacifying the Five Mountains, securing the country’s lasting existence; below it is called treasure, the Spirit Treasure’s mystery, the supreme of all things. The Primordial Beginning opened the diagrams, above opening the twelve spiritual auspices, below issuing the twenty-four responses.  
First: At that time there was neither heaven nor earth; dim and obscure, the spiritual text was dense and obscure, no ancestor or progenitor; the cycle came forth spontaneously, the source of myriad breaths; the void formed truth, the qi was pure, lofty and clear, forming heaven’s vast covering, swiftly emerging from the mysterious.  
Second: At that time the two manifestations divided the forms, qi flowed down and condensed, expanding and thickening, forming shape all at once.  
Third: At that time thirty-six thousand days and moons shone together, illuminating the heavens, penetrating all darkness.  
Fourth: At that time the highest sage and great spirit, the subtle travelling perfect person, countless in number, appeared at court at the Jade Pavilion, revolving through the great void, chanting the spiritual text.  
Fifth: Heaven issued natural music and dance, myriad kinds all performed together, stirring the cloudy palaces, rejoicing the divine truth above.  
Sixth: The spiritual wind chanted a hundred hymns, void-born in all directions, officials and merchants harmonized, all forming the cavernous chapters.  
Seventh: The revolving clepsydra halted its gates, stars and constellations did not proceed, heaven had no day or night, four seasons appeared together at dawn.  
Eighth: Purple clouds emitted brilliance, flowing and scattering through the heavens, all things universally received light.  
Ninth: Spring, autumn, winter, summer, not hot nor icy; the four qi gentle and harmonious; withered and decayed all come alive.  
Tenth: The Five Towns stand firm, talismans, diagrams and scriptures all open at once, manifesting the mysterious void, universally teaching without end.  
Eleventh: At that time hung below were the Seven Treasures of divine marvel, scattered to the lands, nourishing the living folk.  
Twelfth: The Seven Treasures’ marvelous groves spontaneously gave light, their shade covering the ten heavens.  

These twelve spiritual auspices were born of the void and nature; the mysterious diagrams initiated the cycle, manifesting the spiritual text. The earth issued twenty-four responses, rejoicing the divine truth above.  
First: At that time the celestial air was chaotic; there was no light; the cock crowed to announce dawn; the four seasons were bright and clear; heaven was mysterious and earth expanded, producing the five elements.  
Second: Thirty-six thousand days and moons shone together above and below, illuminating endless darkness.  
Third: The blue bird bore the text, announcing to the Five Emperors, regulating the heavenly divisions.  
Fourth: The White Tiger spat gold, securing and pacifying the Five Spirits.  
Fifth: The Azure Dragon bore the talisman, announcing the Water Emperor, regulating the meetings and hastening the cycle, opening the rivers and seas.  
Sixth: The Jade Dragon bore the imperial seal, presenting it to the Emperors, securing the country’s fate, the Five Towns enduring.  
Seventh: The Luan cried, the Phoenix sang, flying and calling melodiously.  
Eighth: The birds flocked and danced, flying to the sky’s edge.  
Ninth: The Flood Dragon leapt and struck, stirring the great deep pools.  
Tenth: The river waters ceased flowing, fish scales met and joined.  
Eleventh: Sweet dew spontaneously arose, fragrant herbs abounded.  
Twelfth: Winter had no ice or frost, withered trees all flourished.  
Thirteenth: Forests and crops, summer and winter, blossomed and bore fruit in abundance, none withered or harmed.  
Fourteenth: The four qi harmonized, plagues did not advance, heaven and humankind rejoiced, no years of calamity.  
Fifteenth: Poisonous stings closed their teeth, no harm was born in hearts.  
Sixteenth: Lions and fierce beasts dwelt peacefully by humans.  
Seventeenth: Men and women throughout the world, blind, deaf, lame, and sick, all were restored; no injury or illness remained, all attained health and strength.  
Eighteenth: The aged became young again, the young did not age, their appearance splendid and resplendent.  
Nineteenth: Birds, beasts, and livestock, pregnant or not, all bore offspring safely, none harmed.  
Twentieth: Women conceived and bore sons throughout the world.  
Twenty-first: Earth treasures issued forth, gold and jade like dew, scattered on roads, nowhere hidden.  
Twenty-second: Heaven shook and earth cracked, dead bones revived, sinking corpses and flying souls both rose and became human; all the world sang, rejoicing in great peace.  
Twenty-third: Earth produced lotus flowers; heaven and men praised and rejoiced universally.  
Twenty-fourth: The Five Sacred Mountains opened, talismans and scriptures emerged, teaching heaven and man; all learners ascended as immortals.  

These twenty-four responses praised the Primordial Beginning’s spiritual diagrams, rejoiced in the Five Elders’ enlightenment. The spiritual text was thus revived, the Way advanced. Heaven and earth opened and expanded, the orthodox law flourished, divine winds spread afar, myriad breaths carried wide. The Five Emperors assisted and supported, driving and managing the heavenly immortals, employing and guiding divine officers, directing yin and yang. They fixed the Three Luminaries at the mysterious root, preserving heaven and earth for long existence, pacifying the Five Mountains in the Spiritual Pavilion, regulating kalpas and cycles at the Three Gates, establishing the country’s fate to respond to the diagrams, guiding the Five Qi to nurture the people, widely extending the original heaven, universally teaching the ten directions; awe and efficacy vast and broad, no corner unopen, divine marvels majestic, difficult to describe.

At that time the highest sages, the Supreme Great Dao Lords, the Highest Jade Emperors, and the perfect ones of the ten directions all rode five-coloured jade wheels, jade carriages, nine-coloured mysterious dragons, ten unparalleled feathered canopies, three white drifting clouds; the great saints of the heavens, the subtle travelling perfect persons, all rode the blue mist nine spirits flowing radiance flying cloud jade chariots. Celebrating assemblies in the heavens, three dawns gave forth fragrance, flying incense gathered in eights, streaming lightning raised beacons, floral essence watered the sun, the Three Luminaries combined brightness, divine mists shone brilliantly, flashing the utmost void. Following the Five Emperor immortals, the Mulberry Forest thousand truths, lions, white cranes, tigers and leopards, dragon scales. The spiritual consorts scattered flowers, golden youths raised incense, the Five Ways opened paths, the Three Realms communicated passages, wandering the cloud roads, calling the mandates of the Ten Heavens. The highest ascended the Upper Purity Supreme Mysterious Jade Capital Cold Spirit Elixir Purple Tenuity Upper Palace, establishing the celestial treasure feathered vestments, proceeding to the Primordial Heavenly Venerable beneath the Golden Palace, requesting to receive the “Primordial Spirit Treasure Red Writ Jade Chapters True Text.” Thereupon the Heavenly Venerable commanded to lead the assembly of perfect ones into the Great Void Golden Terrace Jade Treasure Hall of Nine Radiant Houses. Spiritual youths and jade maidens attended on either side, ninety million. Flying dragons and poisonous beasts guarded the eight gates, rushing serpents struck swords, long teeth struck bells, divine tigers howled upward, lions roared downward, qilin danced, phoenixes sang, calling and singing melodiously. The Heavenly Balance played its banners and canopies, jade sounds stirred the cloud court. The highest sages, Five Elders, Supreme Great Dao Lords bowed and said: Humbly we hear that the Primordial Beginning renews the cycles, the mysterious phenomena open the diagrams, the spiritual text luxuriant and elegant, manifesting the five directions. Heaven and earth ride it to divide and judge, the Three Luminaries follow it to enlighten. This great ancestral undertaking, may it be briefly unfolded before the spiritual store? I have crossed beyond the heavens’ beginning, within the great kalpa, planted truth in the Nine Spirits’ treasury, received the essence at the five spirits’ gates, born within the mysterious womb of gestation, seen yang in the darkly responsive soul, lifted the head in the great void, stepped the long passage, displayed the clear three assemblies, bathed in the upper mystery, flowing scene of the dark radiance’s capital, resolute in the eight circles, humbly received the command of enlightenment, graciously influenced by the grand master’s ancestor. Reflecting on all living things, lamenting the flowing fate, the august way is smooth, truth also moves mysteriously. My private heart truly desires to cause cloud shade to the eight corners, wind to scatter orchid groves, cold branches to aspire to the flourishing Hua-yang, decayed bones to receive the spiritual ferry. Without examining the “Spirit Treasure Five Chapters Jade Text,” can it be granted and passed down to the unheard?

The Primordial Heavenly Venerable sat in deep contemplation, stroking the high table, commanding to summon the Five Emperors, discussing and deciding yin and yang, calculating kalpa cycles, transferring and inspecting river sources, checking and recording heavenly degrees, selecting seed people, pointing and holding the utmost void, calling out the nine mysteries loudly, never opening the ear to old phrases, closing the gate to the path of seeking truth. The Supreme Dao Lord questioned without ceasing; after long the Primordial Beginning cast down his gaze and sighed: How subtle and deep! What you now hold, is it not far? This is the Primordial Beginning’s mysterious root, the text of void and nature, preserving kalpas and cycles in the heavenly mechanism, pacifying the five spirits to establish truth. Now the Three Heavens arrange their cycles, the Six Heavens practise the Way, mixed methods open and transform; there must be thirty-six thousand kinds of ways, to enlighten the hearts of those who come. When this method’s cycle completes, after the Three Dragons, the year of Gengzi, the mixed qi universally disperses, the true Way will advance. Now may it be entrusted, to be recorded in the upper pavilion, not yet to be exercised in the lower world, teaching the beginners in learning. The mysterious methods have prohibitions; it must not be casually transmitted. You may go to the Spiritual Capital Purple Tenuity Upper Palace, view the heavenly sounds on the Golden Grid, take the bowing and looking from the Divine King. Afterwards you shall prepare the celestial charts, to govern the Primordial Beginning’s heaven. Thereupon the Supreme Great Dao Lord and assembly of perfect ones retired to fasting for three months, went to the Spiritual Capital Palace, received the bowing and looking grids. Thus knowing the heavenly truth is precious and difficult to hear, they then again proceeded to the Primordial Heavenly Venerable, inquiring about the rites of prohibition, modestly declining inability; the heavenly countenance pitied and discoursed, the spiritual gates widely opened, issuing the command to the Five Elders’ Supreme Truth, unfolding the nine radiances and eight colours’ cloud brocade sack, issuing the “Primordial Beginning Red Writ Jade Chapters True Text Spirit Treasure Upper Scripture,” giving it to the Supreme Great Dao Lord, Highest Jade Emperor, perfect ones of the ten directions, the great saints of the heavens, subtle travelling perfect persons. They were to follow the mysterious methods; the six heavenly qi dispersed; to transmit according to law.

The Primordial Beginning Five Elders’ Spirit Treasure Official Titles

The Eastern Guardian Anbao Hualin Qingling Shilao Elder, styled Cangdi of the sun, surname Luan, given name Kaiming, styled Lingwei Yang. He wears a blue refined jade crown, robes of nine qi blue feathered flying garments. Usually rides a blue dragon, bearing the quail banner, commanding the divine Jia and Yi officials with nine hundred thousand soldiers. His essence was first born; above is named the Eastern Blue Fang Nine Qi Heaven; central is the planet Jupiter; below is Mount Tai. His qi is like the beginning sprouting of spring grass; his light like the first descending sunbeam. Below is the pool of morning splendour; above is the palace of flowing brilliance. The chamber has the Jade Maidens of the Blue Waist; the hall has the Supreme True King. The Jade Maidens ride beasts of the nine mountains; the True King rides the nine-radiance divine dragon, guiding the nine heavens’ harmonious qi above, drawing the nine springs’ fragrant flow below. Nourishing the Two Forms to last forever, guarding yin and yang to endure eternally. Heaven sends primordial essence to the Supreme Ultimate; earth protects the mountains at Gumo; the spirit moves in the spiritual void at the silent terrace; man nourishes the five organs at the lip's edge, so the nurturer’s watering has no limit, the preserver’s continuance has no end. Thus returning through ten thousand kalpas and renewing, stabilizing the country’s fate and flourishing; gathering flowing clouds in the upper palace; reversing decay and childhood ignorance. Thereupon the roc soars to the nine directions, ascending the mysterious cave, seeking the spiritual officers of the Supreme Truth, becoming the ancestral master with the immortal treasure. Great indeed is the Spirit Treasure; the Blue Fang endures, owing to the Nine Qi of the Elder.
