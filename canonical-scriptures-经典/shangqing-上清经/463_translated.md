Having received the Ten Precepts of the Primordial Reality, to verify the fruition of the true man, thou must be even more vigorous, courageous, and diligent; hold fast to thy words and deeds, without the slightest fault; only then shalt thou be permitted to receive the Three Hundred Great Precepts commanded by the Supreme Lord Lao.

But if thou only recitest with lips whilst thy heart is contrary; if thy words be pure but thy deeds foul; or if thou begin diligently but end in sloth, abandoning the way halfway—therefore it is said, to knowingly offend is a graver sin, more grievous and irreparable; thou shalt fall eternally into degradation. The law of the Azure Heaven is pitiless; even if the Supreme Lord should reappear, he cannot save thee. Study the Way, immortal among women, consider and be cautious!

Title of Scripture: The Text of the Ten Precepts of the Primordial Reality of the Venerable Void Sovereign. One scroll. Source: *Zhengtong Daozang*, Section of Cavern Truth, category of Precepts and Rules.

It is respectfully noted that the Venerable Void Sovereign said: To renounce the world and surpass the ordinary is to be bound by a prior good karmic affinity; therefore one can alone be withdrawn from the common order. If one be as careful at the end as at the beginning, and diligently refine to the utmost, the blessings will extend to seven generations, and joy will flow through one family. As it is said, 'The nine-storied terrace rises from the accumulation of earth; a journey of a thousand li begins beneath the feet.' The gate of the Way and the foundation of accumulating virtue must surely begin here. At the time of entering the path, thou shouldst receive the Ten Precepts of the Primordial Reality; these precepts are ten in number, thou shalt receive them.

The First Precept is: Thou shalt not be disloyal, unfilial, unkind, nor untrustworthy; thou shalt discharge thy duty to sovereign and parents with utmost fidelity, and extend sincerity to all things.

It is transmitted that: Among the myriad volumes of the immortal scriptures, loyalty and filial piety are foremost. For to serve the sovereign with diligence and care is to repay the grace of protection; to cultivate oneself and proceed cautiously is to repay the grace of birth and nurture; to serve the teacher as one’s parents is to repay the grace of instruction. The people are born of these three, and serve them as one; this is the great repayment of origin. Moreover, to be without shame before Heaven above, and without disgrace before men below; to reverence and trust the spirits and bright ones — thus to repay the grace of creation. These three are called the Fourfold Graces. As to blessing the state and extending happiness, expelling demons and removing harms, transforming the people to goodness, supplementing what the sovereign’s transformation cannot reach—this is the loyalty of renunciation. In life, one guides one’s parents to cherish blessings and turn toward the Way; in death, one acts for them, transferring the spirit to the blessed abode. As for oneself, one departs from affections and desires, ceases worldly ties, concentrates the mind, and diligently studies the Way. When the Way’s功 (achievement) is accomplished, even those of a billion kalpas as kin have all been delivered; above one may repay the Fourfold Graces, below one may aid the sufferings of the Three Paths; this is the filial piety of renunciation. As for the unkind, who deceive their hearts and act falsely, transgressing rites without cause; and the untrustworthy, who make lying boasts and dazzle the multitude with flowery words; understand that great loyalty is to cause no deceit of the heart, not even to one thing; great filial piety is not to contradict reason, loving even one body. Thus a single word that deceives the heart is not loyalty; a single deed that contravenes rites is not filial piety. Therefore loyalty and filial piety are the foremost among all precepts, the source of all conduct, and the first duties of the learner. If one can follow and keep to these, then surely one can discharge duty to sovereign and parents, and extend sincerity to all things.

The Second Precept is: Thou shalt not plot in secret with guile nor harm others for thine own profit; thou shalt practise hidden virtue, and broadly aid all living beings.

Secret guile and plotting are to cause others to do wrong covertly, to instigate quarrels and lawsuits. To lead others into traps and nets and delight in it, the thoughts of harming others for self-benefit are beyond measure. But if one can turn inward and shine forth light, transforming others to goodness, then one widely practises hidden virtue and universally aids all living beings; this is the first fundamental of entering the Way.

The Third Precept is: Thou shalt not kill or injure sentient life to gratify thy palate; thou shalt practise benevolence and kindness, even towards insects and worms.

Not killing life is to preserve humaneness and love. Birds and beasts are born nearby, with the same nature of life; they have mates, feelings of parent and child, nests for dwelling, thoughts of eating and drinking, love and fear—how are they different from men? To hold a heart of pity, to not bear to slay and eat them, to verify acts of compassion, is this not good? Or if the heart be kind to men and loving to things, yet one walks among the common people, with some inconvenience, then to not conceive killing, not to strike to kill, not to see killing—these three cleansings—then the eating is according to fate, how is there killing? Moreover, the sages and worthies in regard to meat have not always necessarily eaten or not; and as for love and kindness extended to things, how can there be constant intervals between these? Like loosening the net on three sides, keeping far from the kitchen, fishing but not with nets, shooting but not at the roost, awakening insects without killing, letting the young grow without breaking them. The benevolence extends universally, to people, insects, grasses, and trees, all alike. Those who now abstain from meat, can they truly be so? Know also that the abundance or frugality of man’s dress and food is all due to shallow or deep accumulation from former lives; the portion received today can be moderated. Thus the blessings to come will be abundant and immeasurable. If truly so, then kindness even to insects, can it be empty talk?

The Fourth Precept is: Thou shalt not indulge in licentiousness nor corrupt thy true nature, nor profane or neglect the vital spirit; thou shalt keep chaste purity, so that no defilement or transgression occur.

Not indulging in licentiousness is to guard against disordering the family relations. Those who have a household specially exist to continue the succession and inheritances; therefore by mediation and formal contracts marriage is arranged, with clear and declared weddings. Also to feast and drink to summon the kinsfolk and friends, to strengthen distinctions between male and female—thus the way of husband and wife, according to rites, is natural, and does not violate others’ appearances; whence is licentiousness? Those who frequent prostitutes are called low and base precisely because their wanton indulgence disrupts human relations. To be close to such is to be equal with them. Yet former immortal masters sometimes played with the doors of prostitutes, perhaps to test and train the heart of the Way, to show that they did not move at the scene; or by transformation to guide those with affinity to turn back from dust and unite with awareness. Later common folk, however, sometimes use this to prove themselves, which is indeed a wandering of the left Way, a mixing of true and false, and a difference of purpose between the immortal and the mundane. Upright men and gentlemen, who hold to goodness and advocacy, do not necessarily fall into the delusions of those confused. Those who renounce the world and surpass the ordinary all have good auspices from past lives, and so alone withdraw from the ordinary order. If truly they can at once cease worldly ties, sever lustful desires, and diligently cultivate the Way, they shall attain the immortal rank, blessing the nine ancestors, and bringing joy to one family. The scripture says: Immortals and Taoists are not of spiritual essence alone, but accumulate essence and nurture spirit to complete the True. Yet some at the beginning stage do not understand resolve and chastity, and should early examine themselves to encourage the future; not to squander good causes nor fall again into dust and nets. Thou shalt keep chaste purity, that no defilement or transgression occur; then blessings and virtue will daily renew, and the功 of the Way may be achieved.

The Fifth Precept is: Thou shalt not ruin the success of others, nor sunder the ties of kinship; thou shalt assist all things by the Way, so that the nine clans may be harmonious.

Not to ruin the success of others is to hear of one’s goodness and praise it, and to hear of all evil and conceal it, so that they may succeed and not lose virtue. And not to sunder kinship is that when one sees relatives in discord—father and son, husband and wife, brothers, teacher and friend—due to contradictions leading to dissension, one should exhort by the Way, so that they be harmonious and not separated. Thus human relations are not destroyed, and moral principle preserved; this is indeed the essential path of true reputation. Those who learn the Way ought each to understand.

The Sixth Precept is: Thou shalt not slander the worthy and good, nor display thy talents to exalt thyself; thou shalt praise the good and virtuous in others, and not boast of thine own abilities.

This is truly the gate to enter the Way. Speech is the voice of the heart; false speech comes from an insincere heart. If the heart be not sincere, and one calls it the Way, this is to turn against the Way to seek it, which is utterly erroneous. To meet the worthy and good and slander them, or to display one’s talents and exalt oneself, is not fitting for an upright person. One must praise the good and virtuous in others, so as to produce success in oneself; this is indeed a profound precept for the learner.

The Seventh Precept is: Thou shalt not drink wine nor eat meat in violation of the laws and prohibitions; thou shalt harmonize thy vital nature, and apply thyself exclusively to purity and emptiness.

Not drinking wine is to guard against disordering one’s nature. Wine was originally to perform rites and harmonize spirits; in antiquity hosts and guests would offer hundreds of bows, and yet not become drunk, showing moderation. Later men’s appetites grew insatiable, drinking freely to drunkenness, leading to bodily disorder and loss of rites and laws; some fell ill, others brought calamity, without perceiving their fault. But if one moderates according to usual measure, reducing consumption so as not to exceed, how can the nature be disordered? As for eating meat in violation—such as the ox who has laboured, the dog of loyalty, the orderly wild goose, the carp and eel of morning contest—such meats, how can one bear to eat them? To extend this thought, and abstain from eating, one may harmonize the vital nature, stir the true spirit, and apply oneself to purity and emptiness, with the功 of the Way daily renewed, and the profound功 manifesting in time. All who learn ought to be careful themselves.

The Eighth Precept is: Thou shalt not be covetous and insatiable, nor hoard wealth without dispersal; thou shalt practise frugality, and show kindness to the poor.

Men’s poverty or wealth is by predestined portion at birth. If fortune is allotted, it is used till spent and returns; if poverty is allotted in the bones and flesh, then seeking widely will not bring wealth. If one understands this principle, all seeking is left to nature. Not taking what is not one’s own; not grasping at what is not right; taking only that which is fitting. One need not fall into the desire for food and wealth without limit, nor hoard without dispersal, inviting calamity. Yet the men of our party must first see through illusion and falsity, to show kindness to the poor, practise frugality and caution, live according to circumstances, and not harshly blame for constancy. Thus the heart and mind become empty and idle, worldly desires vanish, and in time naturally accord with the Way and truth.

The Ninth Precept is: Thou shalt not consort with the unworthy, nor dwell in filth and confusion; thou shalt aspire to surpass thyself, and abide in purity and emptiness.

When one first renounces the world, unable to stand alone, one must rely on the monastic community, or form a Way fellowship, to mutually support and avoid partiality. But friends divide into three classes: cloud friends and rosy friends, good friends and knowing friends, and wild friends and strange friends. All who have resolve and chastity, who refine heart and mind, investigate guilt and blessing, sever worldly feelings, and wander free beyond form, seeking like-minded comrades, and so become friends—these are called cloud friends and rosy friends, because their hearts are like clouds and rosy hues, untroubled by worldly affairs. Then there are those who study scriptures, speak broadly and learnedly—these are called good friends and knowing friends, because they do not refine their hearts, yet cannot do evil. Then there are those who do not cultivate heart and mind, nor study scriptures, nor regard guilt or blessing, speak wrongly and err, act wildly and violently, at the slightest touch start quarrels, boast and display, rely on force and victory, oppress the good, and band together—these are called wild friends and strange friends. After death, all these three sorts have their respective places, according to功; each receives their due reward. The cloud and rosy friends ascend to the formless, feast at the Jade Capital, becoming either immortals or heavenly officials; the good and knowing friends still have worldly hearts, not beyond human relations; the wild and strange friends, having received full support, have no功德, and repay their karmic debts with mouth, some falling to the infernal regions, some to the lower births, revolving in suffering. When it comes to this, what use is regret? Concerning these three sorts of friends, one must choose carefully. The learner should consider, seeking what is excellent and advantageous, aspiring to surpass oneself, abiding in purity and emptiness, not to disappoint the heart of one’s parents sending thee forth, nor the intention of the holy court opening teachings to save men. What is to be done is all to be comprehended, so that one may attain accomplishment.

The Tenth Precept is: Thou shalt not be frivolous in word or laugh, nor act without sincerity; thou shalt hold thyself grave and sparing of speech, making morality and the Way thy concern.

It is said in antiquity: To be grave and serious is not to be poor, but esteemed; to be light, frivolous, and mean is not to die young, but to be poor. And frivolous speech, obsequious smiles, studied flattery to please the world, are the resort of the petty man, and are truly not fitting for an upright person. Much less then to be grave and sparing of speech, with moderated gesture and countenance; this is the essential advance on the Way, truly what the enlightened must do. If one can earnestly keep and diligently practise this, why should one fear that nobility will not come?
