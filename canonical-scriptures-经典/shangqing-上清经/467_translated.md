# Preface by Xu

The "Account of the Eight Immortals Attaining the Way" was composed by the Daoist Wugou of Emei. Wugou was a native of a certain county by the river in Sichuan; his ancestors had served in the Manchu dynasty. At the time of Wugou's birth, his family was poor. His father Qi died; his mother remarried twice and departed; Wugou thus drifted to Chengdu. By what chance or cause he does not know, he came to know the venerable Daoist Zhiyuan of Qingyun Temple. Zhiyuan was a man of the Way possessing virtue; he was also skilled in physiognomy, and said that Wugou’s nature and disposition were those of a man of rare and odd character; he was fit to hide his person beyond the world and not to mingle with the noisy strife of the mundane. So he took him under his instruction, personally imparting to him the teachings of the Daoist classics.

Wugou was originally clever and quick of understanding; under Zhiyuan’s supervision and teaching, he did not fail to apply his mind and exert himself diligently. Therefore, by the middle years of his life, he had fully transmitted Zhiyuan’s learning. Moreover, he deeply studied the profound arts, and was able to know events of the future and the past. He would often go many months without taking food or fire-cooked meals, yet his complexion remained full and robust, as usual. If he dwelt amid the market streets, his eating, resting, and daily habits were at first no different from those of ordinary men. In conversation with others, he seldom touched upon the principles of the Way. He clearly did not wish to dazzle the world by strange conduct, and so he concealed himself in this way. Yet in time many came to know of Wugou. Wherever he went, some came to inquire of the Way; some wished to follow him to wander beyond the world. Wugou was wearied by their importunity, and therefore at the places he passed he never gave his true name to others.

The time was that of the transition between the Xianfeng and Tongzhi reigns of the Qing dynasty. Knowing that great disorder was about to arise, and unwilling to behold the horrors of slaughter in Jiangnan, he journeyed northward into the capital, residing in various Daoist temples for some ten years. At that time, the inspector Lu Jingfu, while serving at the capital, became well acquainted with Wugou. Incidentally, the inspector was involved in a case that nearly brought death upon him. Fortunate was he that a superior official admired Wugou, and Wugou, by a word of explanation, cleared the false accusation and set right the injustice. The official then recommended the inspector as a man of character, and he was brought into the official’s circle. Later, this man obtained appointment in an outer district; it was through the official’s influence, yet indeed originated from Wugou’s single word. From then the inspector and Wugou became close friends. Wugou also said that, amid the tumult of the world, men like the inspector — upright, detached, and not ensnared by worldly dust, though holding office — were indeed rare to meet. From that time onward the inspector began to discern Wugou’s true nature and knew him to be an extraordinary man beyond the world, revering him with the respect due to a master. The health-preserving secrets that Wugou imparted were mostly unknown in the world. The inspector followed these teachings, and throughout his life was free from sickness, living to the age of ninety-eight.

Wugou lingered long in the capital. One day, he suddenly told the inspector that he was about to undertake a journey overseas. At their parting, he handed him his composed scriptures and the manuscript of the "Account of the Eight Immortals Attaining the Way," saying: "Should the right person be found, then entrust it to his care for engraving and printing." The inspector took the books back to Zhejiang, but often lamented that he had not found the right person. Subsequently, with the Tai Ping Army uprising, the inspector fled afar with his family; on the way he encountered robbers and lost all his resources and tools. The robbers obtained Wugou’s manuscripts and treated them with wanton disregard; only the "Account of the Eight Immortals Attaining the Way" was less damaged, although the pages were disordered and confused like tangled threads. When the disorder was settled, the inspector gave the scriptures to the Daoist Diyan of Chongqing. Though called a Daoist, Diyan was not of the orthodox Way; he approached Daoist learning with a flexible mind, often wearing the yellow cap and the garb of a feathered scholar; his associates were mostly men beyond the world. Throughout his life he was devoted to Daoism, reading all the Daoist texts, from the "Tao Te Ching" and the "Nanhua" to recent writings, without exception. The inspector admired his high character and again took from Wugou the profound mysteries of Daoist teachings to test with him; Diyan found many correspondences and exclaimed with emotion: "The person to whom Wugou referred as his successor can be none other than this one!" He then returned the scriptures to the inspector but kept solely the "Account of the Eight Immortals Attaining the Way," regarding it as a work of fiction, its style and meaning comparatively shallow, intending personally to arrange and publish it. But in the end, due to other affairs, this was not accomplished.

After the inspector’s death, later generations studied and engaged in commerce, establishing shops in Lanxi. Though aware of the existence of the manuscript of the "Account of the Eight Immortals Attaining the Way," none dared to undertake the responsibility of arranging it. This peerless and wondrous text of the orthodox Dao was almost consumed by the worms. By chance I journeyed to Lanxi and lodged at the shop of the inspector’s younger son; from dawn to dusk we conversed at length and incidentally spoke of this matter. I eagerly sought the manuscript and, upon reading it, found its style to be ancient, elegant, and refined; its words and meaning profound and harmonious throughout. It was indeed free from all mundane taint, possessing a unique grace like floating clouds and flowing water. Even among the famous novelists of old and new, none could imitate its style or capture its spirit beyond the text. Other scriptures I have not seen, and even if I had, I should not understand them. My humble judgment of this book, based on what remains, is that it is so wondrous and exquisite — immortal indeed! Immortal indeed! Is it not a rare and transcendent composition of all ages? Having read and pondered it repeatedly, I loved it and could not let it go; not daring to presume I could surpass Wugou’s so-called successor, I resolved to undertake its arrangement. I supplemented what was lacking, enriched what was deficient, and reordered and corrected what was confused and disordered. When completed, I had it printed on pear and jujube paper, and entrusted my old friend Zhenya with the task of careful proofreading, as a mark of my earnestness and out of fear of errors or faults, so as not to disappoint Wugou’s sincere efforts. Yet the scriptures were scattered and in disorder; the arrangement and proofreading could not be accomplished in a short time. Both Zhenya and I were engaged in our daily livelihoods, unable to devote ourselves entirely to this task; errors and slips may well remain. I hope that readers, in their study, will point out what they know. Not only shall Zhenya and I be fortunate, but the spirit of Wugou will surely bless all of you.
