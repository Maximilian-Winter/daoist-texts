Nourish the qi, forget words, and keep watch;  
Lower the mind and act by non-action.  
Know in movement and stillness the ancestral root;  
With no affairs, to whom else seek you?  
True constancy must respond to things;  
Responding to things must not be bewildered.  
Not bewildered, the nature abides of itself;  
Nature abiding, the qi returns of itself.  
Qi returning, the elixir naturally forms;  
Within the cauldron matching Kan and Li.  
Yin and Yang give birth to return and reversal;  
Universal transformation is a single sound of thunder.  
White clouds ascend the summit at dawn;  
Sweet dew sprinkles Mount Sumeru.  
Drinking the wine of longevity oneself;  
Who then can know such freedom and ease?  
Sitting, listening to a stringless melody;  
Clearly comprehending the mechanism of creation.  
All these come to twenty lines—  
Truly, a ladder to the heavens.

### Nourish the Qi, Forget Words and Keep Watch

The Way of nature and life consists in ceaseless cultivation of the innate, empty, true and unified qi alone; there is nothing else. Those who gather herbs do so for this; those who refine medicines do so for this; those who return the elixir do so for this; those who transcend the elixir do so for this; those who take the elixir do so for this; those who form the embryo do so for this; those who transcend the embryo do so for this. To prolong life by art, the prolongation is this; to perfect the Way, the perfection is this. Beginning with action, the action is this; ending in non-action, the non-action is this. Longevity is this; non-birth is this. The ancient classics say, "Knowing the One, all things are completed." This phrase suffices to understand thousands of scriptures and ten thousand volumes. Yet this qi is neither form nor void, without shape or image; it cannot be known by knowledge, nor recognized by recognition; seen, it is invisible; heard, it is silent; grasped, it evades; vague and dim, obscure and hidden, beyond description. To force it and schematize it—this alone is error. To force a name upon it—the Confucians call it the Great Ultimate, the Daoists the Golden Elixir, the Buddhists Perfect Enlightenment; originally there is nothing to speak of, nothing to guard. If it can be spoken or guarded, it is not the innate empty qi, but the acquired qi of breathing. The innate qi endures through myriad kalpas without decay; the acquired qi fluctuates with the illusory body’s presence or absence. Those who have not attained the true transmission mistake the acquired, tangible qi for the innate: some say it lies in the sea of qi, some in the cinnabar field, some in the Yellow Court, some in the Ren and Du meridians, some between the two kidneys; some close the mouth and regulate breathing to balance qi; some retain breath and regulate embryonic breath to store qi; some raise and lower qi within the Yellow Court; some guard, some move, and so on, all pursuing rash fantasies of forming the elixir. Pray, where shall such tangible qi ultimately congeal? Into what shape shall it congeal? Must it congeal into a lump of qi? Those who guard above often suffer from leakage of the brain; those who guard below, leakage at the base; those who guard the middle suffer swelling; those who guard the bright hall lose sight; those who guard the stubborn heart contract madness. Seeking longevity only hastens death—how lamentable! Little do they know that the innate empty qi embraces heaven and earth, generates and nourishes all things, vast without outside, minute without inside; when released, it fills the six directions; when gathered, it retreats into secrecy. It can only be known, not spoken; only nourished, not guarded. No words, no guarding—forget both speaking and guarding; nourishing without nourishing—thus one enters the samadhi of nourishing qi. The Great Way is vivid and lively, not confined to boundaries of being or non-being; attachment to being clings to form, attachment to non-being clings to void. Clinging to form or void is not the Way of heaven and earth’s creation and transformation, nor the Way of sages and worthies’ true emptiness and subtle existence. To say nourish qi, one must have something to nourish and not cling to void; to say forget words and keep watch, one must have no place or fixed position, not cling to form. Not clinging to void nor to form, there must be a nourishing that is neither void nor form. Such nourishing is silent and still, responding and thus communicating; responding and thus communicating, silent and still—herein lies the Way of nourishing qi.

### Lower the Mind and Act by Non-Action

Above we spoke of nourishing qi without words and guarding, seeming to do nothing. After birth, when innate qi is abundant, yang reaches its extreme and must yield to yin; only then can one preserve the innate qi without loss. Who but the highest virtue sages can do this? Next come the middle and lower types—once they enter the acquired, the innate qi retreats; the acquired qi takes charge; yang gradually declines, yin gradually grows; through kalpas, root dust arises; the whole body’s qi and temperament stir; the discerning spirit becomes arrogant; invading evils cause chaos. At such times, the four elements and the whole body belong to yin, and one does not know what is yang essence. Though wishing to nourish qi, there is nowhere to nourish it, and nourishment cannot be obtained. The Patriarch Huang He said: "The highest virtue perfects the form by the Way; this is the undivided pure yang. The lower virtue prolongs life by art, matching Kan and Li to complete the work." The highest virtue man, with innate qi unlost, pure yang body, guards the center and embraces the One, thus perfecting the original true form. The middle and lower man, with innate qi damaged, yang fallen into yin, must steal yin and yang, seize creation, first strengthen the life base; from action enter non-action, only then can truth be attained. The ancient immortals said: "Returning the elixir is easiest, refining oneself is hardest." Another verse says: "Seven returns to the elixir, but first one must refine oneself and wait the time." The work of refining oneself begins with lowering the mind; but lowering the mind requires discerning the mind. The mind has distinctions of human mind and Dao mind, true mind and false mind. The Dao mind is originally ignorant and unknowing, following the rule of the Emperor, and is the true mind; the human mind arises later, with knowledge, awareness, the seven emotions and six desires, and is the false mind. The true mind benefits human nature and life; the false mind harms them. Lowering the mind means lowering the false human mind. Yet lowering the human mind is not emptying the mind, nor forcibly fixing the mind; it must follow nature. The Awakening of Truth says: "Follow its desires, lead them gradually." These two phrases are the marvelous secret of lowering the mind. Hence it is said, lower the mind and act by non-action. By "act" the mind must be lowered; by "non-action" it is not forced. Lowered yet not lowered, not lowered yet lowered; use in use without use, effort in effort without effort. The stubborn human mind, habitual and formed in character, is like iron forged in fire, hardest and strongest, unbreakable. To bind it too tightly, to use mind to control mind, only makes the mind more numerous and the lump stronger; instead it causes mind illness. The Yin Conjuring Scripture says: "Fire born of wood, disaster will surely strike." Thus lowering the mind must employ gradual practice, only then can it aid; gradual practice harms not the other, benefits myself; doing and not doing.

### Know in Movement and Stillness the Ancestral Root; With No Affairs, To Whom Else Seek You?

The innate true and unified qi is the ancestral qi of heaven-born heaven, earth-born earth, and man-born man; it is complete without principle lacking, present at all times. It is called the root ancestor of nature and life; to preserve it is sagehood, to lose it is ordinariness. But when this qi falls into the acquired, it is hidden and not manifest; if it manifests, men are drawn by name and profit, disturbed by private desire, missing it face to face, gained and lost in turn. To seek this qi, one must first recognize the Dao mind; for innate qi is hidden in the Dao mind. The Dao mind is the substance, the innate qi is the function; same origin but different names. The Dao mind is the ancestral root of cultivation. The Dao mind is master; the human mind is servant. Recognizing the Dao mind as ancestor root, making master command servant, the servant obeys without needing to be lowered. Every movement and stillness is Dao mind’s operation; even human mind becomes Dao mind. No false thought within, no false affairs without, inner and outer peaceful; invading qi difficult to enter; abiding in a state of no affairs. Being able to reach no affairs, empty and hollow, only the Dao mind alone—what else seek you?

### True Constancy Must Respond to Things; Responding to Things Must Not Be Bewildered

Knowing the ancestral root and abiding in no affairs, the true may be constant. True ability to be constant shields from all external falsity and harm. Yet the Way of true constancy is not to avoid the world or leave the common; nor to sit quietly stopping thought. One must have feet on the ground, body in action, forged in the great creation furnace—only then is it true and constant. To know truth but not practice truth, though appearing without affairs, is like carved wood or molded clay; outwardly still but inwardly troubled. The Chan mechanism is inherently still; stillness breeds demons. This is to close the door and catch thieves: the false cannot be removed, and the true is injured—how can there be true constancy? Hence it is said: true constancy must respond to things; responding to things must not be bewildered. True constancy responding to things means using truth to respond to falsity; responding without bewilderment means using falsity to cultivate truth. Truth lies hidden in falsity; falsity is not outside truth. Without falsity, truth cannot be accomplished; without truth, falsity cannot be transformed. It is only in constant response and constant stillness, in killing opportunity giving birth to opportunity, in waves steering the rudder steadily. If one can avoid bewilderment, this is true constancy; if true constancy, though all day responding to things, one never truly responds; abiding in no affairs, not moved by all things—what harm in responding?

### Not Bewildered, Nature Abides of Itself

Responding without bewilderment, the true constancy of the Dao mind remains; the false human mind does not arise; the false human mind not arising, the temperament nature does not erupt; the innate nature shines clearly like a crystal tower, unstained and unattached, unmoved and unshaken, and abides of itself. In sum, the efficacy of nature’s abiding is entirely in the skill of responding without bewilderment. Bewildered, human mind acts; true nature is obscured and false nature arises. Not bewildered, Dao mind acts; false nature transforms and true nature manifests. The Way of abiding in nature is to avoid bewilderment to the utmost. The Patriarch Huang He said: "According to worldly law cultivate the out-worldly law"—a profound saying.

### Nature Abiding, Qi Returns of Itself

Nature is principle; in heaven it is principle; given to man it is called nature. Qi is life; in heaven it is qi; given to man it is called life. At birth, principle and qi are inseparable; qi and principle inseparable; life and nature inseparable; nature and life inseparable. Principle and qi are one family; nature and life one affair. After entering the acquired, principle and qi disconnect; nature and life become separate. If one can make nature abide, not moved by guest qi, then the upright qi returns spontaneously; without life, yet still with life; nature and life remain one affair; principle and qi do not oppose. This is called exhausting nature and reaching life. Generally, the key to qi’s return lies in nature abiding. If nature abides, qi returns naturally, no room for forcing.

### Qi Returning, the Elixir Naturally Forms

The elixir is a thing round and bright, formed by the union of yin and yang qi. When nature abides, all worries cease; this is true stillness and true emptiness; extreme stillness begets movement, extreme emptiness produces brightness. Innate qi comes from emptiness; in a moment it condenses into the elixir. It is said the elixir forms within one time period. The key to returning the elixir lies in qi returning; the key to qi’s return lies in nature abiding; the key to nature abiding lies in not bewildering; the key to not bewildering lies in lowering the mind; the key to lowering the mind lies in knowing the ancestral root. Knowing the root, lowering the mind, responding to things without bewilderment, nature abides, qi returns, the elixir forms—these three "selfs" come in responding without bewilderment. Responding without bewilderment is the work of refining oneself; when the work of refining oneself is perfected, the elixir forms naturally. The Song of Understanding the Way says: "Before returning the elixir, first refine nature; before cultivating the great medicine, first cultivate the mind. With nature settled, the elixir will certainly come; with heart quiet, then the medicine seed grows." It particularly says returning the elixir is easiest, refining oneself hardest. If refining oneself does not reach no-self, then nature is unsettled, mind not quiet—how can the elixir return? Yet refining oneself without knowing the ancestral root accomplishes nothing. The Master Sanfeng said: "When building the foundation, use the key; when refining oneself, also need the true lead." True lead is the ancestral root. Without meeting the true master’s formula to break the true lead, who dares begin?

### Within the Cauldron, Match Kan and Li

Qi returns, elixir forms; the true seed is in hand. One has only returned to the mother’s original face—this is called returning the elixir, also called small return elixir. This elixir has not yet undergone real water and fire refinement; it remains raw elixir, not mature, unfit for swallowing to aid life. One must calcine this elixir into a supreme yang thing to prolong years and increase longevity. Outside Kan is yin, inside yang; the yang within is true, the central and upright yang, not the turbid essence among the kidneys of the illusory body, but the innate true and unified spirit water. Outside Li is yang, inside yin; the yin within is true, the central and upright yin, not the blood of the heart in the illusory body, but the innate empty and spiritual true fire. This water and fire are the natural water and fire of emptiness, not the water and fire of all forms and images. With this water and fire, simmer the spirit medicine, unceasing through the twelve periods; do not forget or assist; continuous as if always present; use without fatigue. The Pharmacology Mirror says: "Water fears dryness, fire fears cold." To say matching within the cauldron means natural water and fire, not seeking outside; spirit moves silently; medicines mature; fire and time advance and retreat; adding or subtracting as the moment calls; all in secret and subtle balance, without allowing the slightest leakage.

### Yin and Yang Give Birth to Return and Reversal; Universal Transformation is One Sound of Thunder

The work of water and fire refining is the work of morning gathering and evening clouds. Morning gathering is advancing the yang fire; evening clouds is operating the yin talisman. When yang is timely, yang advances; when yin is timely, yin operates. Yin then yang, yang then yin; yin and yang struggle and combine, generating return and reversal. Return and reversal meet in the vague and dim; in the obscure and dark changes appear. Return and overturn; yin and yang mix and transform; the innate spiritual sprout grows from tender to firm, self-generated to mature, gradually then suddenly. Suddenly from the furnace of creation bursts forth a supreme yang elixir, like a thunderclap in the void, awakening the dreaming man.

### White Clouds Ascend the Summit at Dawn; Sweet Dew Sprinkles Mount Sumeru

When the yang elixir emerges from the cauldron, swallowing it and taking one’s own yin mercury is like a cat catching a mouse. White clouds ascend the summit means the gentle and harmonious clear qi rises, the five qi face the origin; sweet dew sprinkles Mount Sumeru means the divine water of the splendorous pond descends, all diseases return to spring. Mount Sumeru stands at the center of heaven and earth, symbolizing a treasure within man. The treasure within is the sacred embryo, also called the yellow sprout. The Patriarch’s poem by Zhang Zhen Nu says: "Earth thunder shakes, mountain top rains, to wash away, the yellow sprout emerges from earth"—this is the meaning.

### Drinking the Wine of Longevity Oneself; Who Then Can Know Such Freedom and Ease?

When the sacred embryo condenses, the divine water flows and irrigates the cinnabar field; naturally form gives rise to substance, form without shape; all forced efforts are useless. Hence it is said, drinking the wine of longevity oneself; who then can know such freedom and ease? Saying “drinking oneself” and “who can know” means that the matter of long life and ease is to steal yin and yang, seize creation, be innate without violating heaven, be acquired while observing heaven’s time. Even heaven and earth and spirits cannot measure it—how much less can men know it?

### Sitting, Listening to a Stringless Melody; Clearly Comprehending the Mechanism of Creation

Zhuangzi says: "Gather spirit and live long; forget spirit and have no life." Longevity is the Way of life with action; no life is the Way of nature without action. Understanding nature’s way is the work of nine years facing the wall; facing the wall is the work of ten months’ warming and nourishing. The nine years is not really nine years; nine is the number of pure yang, meaning the nine returns of golden fluid, yin exhausted and yang pure. It is said, not a speck of yin qi exhausted, one is not immortal. The ten months means the sacred embryo’s completion and transformation time, like a woman’s pregnancy, ten months to birth; also a symbolic image. The ten months’ warming and nourishing guards against dangers and worries; all things are void; not one speck of invading qi enters the fetal origin; like a wall of ten thousand fathoms, nothing seen. Ten months’ warming and nourishing and nine years facing the wall are one meaning, not two separate things; the ancients took the meaning and formed the image. Because it is warming and nourishing while facing the wall, it is said sitting listening to a stringless melody. Sitting is not physical sitting, but mind clear, intent quiet, unmoving and unshaken sitting. Where there is stringed music, there is sound and tone; without stringed music, no sound nor tone. No sound nor tone, only emptiness; though it is said no sound no tone, what is to be listened to? To listen is emptiness yet not emptiness, not emptiness yet emptiness—not stubborn emptiness but true emptiness. Sitting and listening means departing from one side of seeing, not clinging to form. Listening to stringless melody means listen and yet not listen, leaving even listening behind, not clinging to sound. The Diamond Sutra says: "If one sees me by form, or seeks me by sound, this is a wrong path and cannot see the Tathagata." The Tathagata is as if coming, but truly not coming; this is the original face of true emptiness, the supreme gateway beyond the sacred embryo, the true secret phrase to perfect the dharma body. In brief, the work of non-action lies in the one word sitting; sitting then stops at its proper place; inwardly observing the mind—mind without mind; outwardly observing form—form without form; distantly observing things—things without things. When these three are realized, only emptiness is seen. Emptiness empties nothing; nothingness is also nothing. Nothingness being nothing is called illumination, breaking empty space, revealing the whole body alone, neither birth nor death, then one is truly present. Being born is to transcend the illusory body and fix the life base; the Way of returning the elixir is to make from non-being into being. Non-birth is to transcend the dharma body and understand the nature root; the Way of the great elixir is to transform from being into non-being. Being and non-being is the mechanism of creation. Knowing this Way, at first one makes from non-being into being to live long; in the end one returns from being to non-being to no longer be born. Being and non-being do not stand; nature and life are cultivated together; clearly understanding the mechanism of heaven and earth’s creation; and one is one with heaven and earth.

### All Come to Twenty Lines—Truly a Ladder to the Heavens

The line "Nourish the qi, forget words and keep watch" comprehensively states the whole great use of cultivating the Way. "Lower the mind and act by non-action" speaks to refining oneself and building the foundation. "Know in movement and stillness the ancestral root; with no affairs, to whom else seek you?" these two speak to refining oneself and building the foundation, needing to recognize the mind. "True constancy must respond to things; responding to things must not be bewildered," these two speak to the real work of refining oneself. "Not bewildered, nature abides of itself; nature abiding, qi returns of itself; qi returning, the elixir naturally forms," these three speak to diligent work of refining oneself, the elixir forming naturally. "Within the cauldron matching Kan and Li" speaks to the inner furnace’s work after the elixir returns. "Yin and yang give birth to return and reversal" speaks to yin-yang transformation, from tender to firm. "Universal transformation is one sound of thunder" refers to the elixir’s transcendence. "White clouds ascend the summit at dawn; sweet dew sprinkles Mount Sumeru" speak to the post-elixir taking embodiment phenomena. "Drinking the wine of longevity oneself; who then can know such freedom and ease?" speak to the phenomena of taking the elixir and forming the embryo. "Sitting, listening to a stringless melody" speaks to the ten months’ warming and nourishing work. "Clearly comprehending the mechanism of creation" summarizes the great meaning of understanding nature and life. The preceding eighteen lines disclose the entire sequence of the great and returning elixir, the fires’ timing, the project, all revealed; simple and easy, concise and not verbose; following the Way and holding fast, from low to high, from near to far, truly the ladder to the heavens for cultivators of the Way. The twenty lines include also the two concluding lines.
