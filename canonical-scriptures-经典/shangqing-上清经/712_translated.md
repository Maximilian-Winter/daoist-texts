# The Pass of Carnal Desire

LÃ¼zu said:  
The form of a maiden in her prime is like soft butter;  
At the waist she wields a sword to cut down the foolish man.  
Although the head does not fall,  
In secret she causes the marrow and sinews to wither away.

Qiuzu said:  
When practising the right Way, one must be cautious,  
Sweeping away carnal desire to return to the truth.  
He also said:  
Cut through the vines and creepers that bind the golden sea,  
Unlock the jade padlock and issue forth from the cage.

These are the great compassion and mercy of the ancestral masters,  
Teaching men to abandon carnal desire and seek the path of life.  
Now carnal desire is the chief and greatest pass that threatens life,  
The most evil and poisonous of all.  
How do we know it is the pass that threatens life?  
When an ordinary man beholds beauty,  
His soul and spirit scatter and vanish;  
His lustful heart at once stirs;  
As the lustful heart stirs, the fire of desire rises;  
The vital breath dissipates and the spirit shifts.  
Though the forms have not met,  
The primal essence secretly leaks away,  
Nature is obscured, and life shaken.  
Much more when in the place of desire,  
Day and night indulging in pleasure,  
Taking pain for joy, and harm for delight.  
One day the oil is exhausted and the lamp extinguished,  
The marrow spent and the man gone;  
Though he desires not to die, how can it be?  
Therefore, those who cultivate the Way  
Take caution against carnal desire as their foremost concern.  
But carnal desire is the most difficult to remove, and hardest to guard against.  
Since the beginningless kalpas, men have been born from the path of desire,  
And from the path of desire they have died;  
Life after life, death after death,  
In great part the demons of desire have wrought their ruin.  

The demons of desire work both upon Heaven and upon men.  
That which moves upon Heaven is the root dust of kalpas,  
Sprung from ignorance and unconsciousness,  
Arising when there is no thought or care.  
That which issues upon men is that,  
When they behold beauty and passion arises;  
When they meet circumstances and the spirit is carried away.  
How many heroes and great men of old and now,  
In the face of great dangers and hardships,  
Have been able to overcome all save this one pass of the demon of desire,  
And have been stopped by it.  
The four great elements are powerless;  
They cannot struggle or leap forth.  
Were it not for the adamantine man, the stalwart hero,  
He cannot set it aside or cast it off.  

Those who cultivate the Way must know that the demon of desire is the King of Death,  
And must exert great strength to suppress it.  
Even if as fair as Xi Shi, as lovely as Yang Guifei,  
They are yet but foul and rotting skins.  
Look on them unmoved and unshaken,  
Not bewildered or obscured;  
Meet them as though you met them not,  
See them as though you saw them not.  
At all times be on guard,  
Moment by moment reflect inwardly,  
That not a trace of desire may grow secretly in the smallest space of the heart.  
Even as the husbandman tending his field removes the weeds,  
Gradually growing and gradually uprooting them.  
When the old roots are all removed,  
No chance remains for them to grow again.  

How do we know if they have been removed?  
If truly the root of desire is removed,  
Though one encounters beauty, one knows it not as beauty;  
Though one sees a woman, one knows her not as woman.  
If one seeing a beautiful woman still knows her to be a beautiful woman,  
Though able at the moment to control and not move the desire,  
Yet the old root has not been wholly rooted out,  
And in time covert desire will be sure to arise.  

Among the worldly, the stubborn who guard quietude,  
They boast before men,  
Claiming their desires have been cut off;  
Yet often in dreams their essence is lost,  
No method can restrain them.  
They eat the food of deluded hearts, deceiving themselves and others.  
Little do they know that though they claim no desire,  
There are those who have desire within,  
Hiding their lustful hearts.  
Is it easy to root out?  
Only that the root dust is not yet exhausted.  

Though not easy to exhaust, it is necessary to be resolute, strong, and valiant,  
To make a final and deadly effort.  
If one cannot remove it but strives to do so,  
If one cannot cast it away but strives to cast it away,  
With deep merit and long time,  
There will come the hour when it is gone.  
If the root of desire be wholly uprooted,  
Then the body of desire is firm,  
And the dharma-body is easy to cultivate.  
All other passes are easy to overcome.  
If the root of the body be not uprooted,  
This pass cannot be passed,  
And all other passes cannot be passed either.  

I exhort those who sincerely seek the Way,  
Hasten to clear the pass of carnal desire;  
Fear desire as one fears a tiger,  
Guard against lust as against a scorpion.  
Outwardly meet the scene with forgetfulness of passion,  
Inwardly let not desire arise.  
Guard against dangers and hazards;  
Preserve and nourish the spirit;  
Then there is hope in the study of the Way.  

Not only should those who have left the world be thus,  
But even those who dwell at home, though bound by human relations and extending their posterity,  
Should also be sparing in desire for beauty.  
If desire for beauty be scant,  
The essence is strong and the breath full;  
The later nature is ample;  
Sufficient to repel disease and prolong life,  
And also to propagate offspring abundantly.  
In olden days the Yellow Emperor and King Wen had many sons,  
All owing to sparing in desire.  
Whether at home or away,  
All should take caution against carnal desire as the chief concern.  
Otherwise, while the heart of desire is not entirely removed,  
To pursue phantom images and elucidate the Way is difficult indeed.
