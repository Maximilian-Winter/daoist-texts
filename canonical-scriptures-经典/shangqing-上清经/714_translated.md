# The Gate of Honour and Nobility

The Tao Te Ching says: Though one may have jade discs to offer before a team of four horses, it is not comparable to sitting still and advancing on this Way. The Perfect Sage said: Wealth and honour are what men desire. If they are not obtained by the Way, one should not take up their abode.

The Wuzhen says: To seek not the Great Way is to stray from the path; to boast a worthy talent without manhood is vain. A hundred years pass like the flash of a stone’s spark; a single life is like bubbles floating on water. Yet men only covet profit and emolument, seeking fame and honour, disregarding the wasting and withering of their forms and countenances.

Ask then, can heaps of gold as tall as Mount Tai be bought and sold? Qiu Zhu said: When the heart is at peace, what need is there to speak of the rank of the Three Dukes? When the nature is settled, it is stronger than a city ten li in circumference. These teachings all instruct men to value the Way and righteousness, and not to covet honour and nobility.

Now as for honour and nobility, there is the honour and nobility of Heaven’s rank, and the honour and nobility of man’s rank. The honour of Heaven’s rank is virtue, morality, benevolence, and righteousness; the honour of man’s rank is merit, fame, emolument, and office.

Those who seek man’s rank study diligently, enduring hardship over ten years of cold window lights; they apply themselves day and night, forsaking sleep and food, unaware of how much thought they expend, how much spirit they exhaust, before they obtain rank and fame. Though they have gained fame, the size and certainty of it cannot be assured. Some may excel in talent but fail in examination; some pass the examinations but cannot advance; some advance but cannot attain office; some attain office but cannot preserve their gains or lives. Such hardship drains spirit and exhausts qi and blood, exchanging the true for the false, all for this empty name—where then is honour? Where then is nobility?

Furthermore, there are those who, before obtaining fame, are stricken by consumption, their phlegm and asthma, their breath short and laboured, their movements difficult, their lives uncertain—are these not grievous and lamentable? What men call honour and nobility are but the sedan chairs they sit in, the horses they ride, the silks and gauzes they wear, the lamb and delicacies they eat. All are for adorning the body and filling the belly, to dazzle men’s ears and eyes. In the end, the body and mind are greatly harmed, their blessings few, the appointed time near. When death comes, honour and nobility vanish alike with those without them—what then is there to be noble or honoured in?

Those who cultivate the honour of Heaven’s rank fill themselves with benevolence and righteousness, relish the Way and virtue, restrain showiness and seek simplicity, store spirit and nourish upright qi, respect virtue and nature and follow the Way in learning. They will not exchange the true for the false, nor take hardship for pleasure; they honour themselves and esteem themselves, are self-sufficient and contented; neither favour nor disgrace touch them; blame or praise cannot bind them; creation cannot constrain them; yin and yang cannot move them; good and ill fortune cannot approach them. Having perfected their original nature, they have no face to lose. Heaven rejoices; spirits and gods revere them. Then indeed do they don Heaven’s robe, eat Heaven’s food, enjoy Heaven’s longevity—their honour and nobility endure forever. Compared with the honour and nobility of the world, which are as frost and dew, what difference is there but that of clouds and mud?

I exhort those who sincerely learn the Way to quickly open the gate of the world’s empty honour and nobility, so that they may undertake the true affairs of transcendental honour and nobility. To open the gate of worldly honour and nobility is not to teach avoidance of honour and nobility, but to practise firmly and truly in the circumstances of honour and nobility without coveting them.

If one dwells in honour and nobility relying on it, or abides in honour and nobility coveting it, or departs from honour and nobility without forgetting it, or sees honour and nobility and knows it to be honour and nobility, or meets honour and nobility and flatters it, these are all signs that the gate is not opened.

If one truly understands that honour and nobility can disturb one’s nature, bewilder one’s heart, inflame one’s pride, ruin one’s virtue, indulge one’s evil, harm one’s body, and bring death, then honour and nobility are great suffering, a pit of fire, a mire; only then is the gate opened. One may enter the midst of honour and nobility without being harmed by it.

In former times there were men who attained the Way within the field of honour and nobility, such as Bao Qian, Huainanzi, Dongfang Shuo, Xu Jingyang, Master Mei, Immortal Ge, Baopuzi, and Luo the Bard—all great hermits in the court, accomplishing great deeds. This was because they had long since seen clearly and understood thoroughly; thus they planted lotuses amidst great fire, cast boats into mud and water, borrowing worldly methods to cultivate the Dao, manifesting and obscuring, opposing and yielding, no man could fathom them; not coveting honour and nobility.

Not only those who transcend the world must see through honour and nobility, but those within the world who see through honour and nobility will naturally have an independent view. If successful, they are loyal to their lord and love the people, exerting themselves fully to weave great affairs of governance; they will never be like those who hold office without merit or sustenance. If unsuccessful, they cultivate themselves and establish virtue, their conduct lofty; they will not be equal to the common and foolish who mingle with the world.

In former times Yi Yin served Tang, not seeking honour and nobility, but to awaken the people with this Way. Confucius travelled the feudal states, Mencius was a guest of the princes—not to seek honour and nobility, but to practise the Way and seek the world. As for Zhou, Cheng, Zhang, and Zhu, all did not covet honour and nobility. If office was possible, they took it; if not, they ceased. From antiquity, the great sages and worthies valued the Way, not fixing their minds on honour and nobility.

The confused scholars of the world do not see through honour and nobility; some dwell in it yet cannot let it go; some are without honour and yet envy it; some associate with powerful families to seek profit; some frequent the doors of lords and ministers as if for honour. Coveting honour and nobility and yet thinking to cultivate the Way, they are lost and confused, with errant thoughts and disordered wishes, grasping here and there. No wonder they live a busy life and accomplish nothing by old age.

I exhort those who sincerely learn the Way to speedily open the gate of the world’s honour and nobility; those in honour and nobility should forget their honour and nobility, and those without it should not envy it. Esteem the manifest Way as precious; regard attainment of the Way as honour and nobility; then perhaps the mind will return to the true and the future have hope. Otherwise, the phoenix assuming borrowed honour for true honour, the one thought of honour and nobility fixed in the breast, blocks the spiritual orifice, and wilfully imagines manifesting the Way—this is difficult indeed.
