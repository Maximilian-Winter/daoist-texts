# The Pass of Poverty and Hardship

The Most Sage said: The superior man is steadfast in poverty; the inferior man is poor, and therein lies his ruin. The Doctrine of the Mean says: Born in poverty and lowly estate, he conducts himself in poverty and lowliness. Mencius said: Poverty and lowliness cannot move him. The Venerable Purple Sun said: The poor man has jewels within his garment, which are naturally bright and clear. If he does not seek them himself, he counts upon the treasures of others. All these teachings instruct men to hold fast to the good Way even unto death, to dwell amid poverty and hardship without being moved by them. 

The Way of cultivating the True is contrary to the rules of the world; it originates in the desire to abandon wealth and honour, and to choose poverty and low estate; to forsake splendour and to keep to tranquillity and plainness. One must first try the heart and mind with suffering, labour the sinews and bones, starve the body and skin, empty and exhaust the self, to temper and sharpen, to cast away the false and seek the true. Even swords and arms, fire and water, sickness and calamity, are not reckoned; how much less endure poverty! If one cannot bear poverty, and when hunger and cold arise, vexations come forth; when difficulties are met, ignorance arises; then the harm of hunger and thirst becomes the harm of the heart. To nourish the petty is to be a petty man; to recognise the false and renounce the true, is to be distant from the Way; when will such a one reach the shore of the Way?

Little do they know that nature and life are matters of great concern, while clothing and food are matters of small concern. To value clothing and food highly, and to slight nature and life, how can one cultivate nature and life? He who pursues clothing and food merely nourishes the flesh and skin; he who cultivates nature and life preserves the Heavenly Truth. If the Heavenly Truth be lost, though the body be plump and strong, like swine or oxen, men may have the outward form but inward beastly hearts; living yet as good as dead, how can such be men who seek the Way?

In former times the Perfected Man of Eternal Spring dwelt at Dragon Gate seven years; the Perfected Man of Pan Creek for six years; both constantly enduring hunger and thirst, to death without change. The Perfected Man of Great Antiquity, Zhao Zhou, sat fixed on his mat; hunger and cold he did not avoid, life and death did not concern him. The Perfected Man of Danyang abandoned great wealth and entered Iron Check, forsook plenty and warmth and chose poverty and plainness, covering himself with straw, dwelling in caves and holes. These gentlemen endured what others could not, suffered what men could not suffer, and from poverty and hardship attained the Great Way.

The ignorant scholars of the world cannot endure the hardships that should be endured, nor the hunger and cold that should be borne; when slight difficulties arise, or some degree of plainness comes, they forthwith bring forth vexation, curse Heaven and blame Earth, evil thoughts and chaotic imaginings, abandoning their proper place, contriving ways and turning thoughts. Thus behaving, unable to endure poverty and hardship, how can they pass through great dangers and perils? Therefore the scholar must make endurance of poverty and hardship a principal concern. If there be the least fear or dislike in the heart, this one matter becomes a mountain blocking the way, a great fiend harming the Way, and not a step can be taken.

I exhort those of true heart who seek the Way, to quickly open the pass of poverty and hardship; let the heart be of iron and stone, the mind like cold ashes; abide each day according to fate. Hunger and cold shall be thus; starving and freezing, even unto death, shall be thus. Never let small matters of poverty and hardship cause forgetfulness of the great matters of nature and life. Thus acting, with one heart and one mind, truly walking the path, making the Way one’s duty, those who have not heard the Way shall yet hear it; those who have heard the Way shall yet complete it.

The Ancestor Masters have secretly arranged this, and never allow hunger and cold to ruin those who truly learn the Way. Otherwise, clothed in abundance and satisfied with food, living at ease, and yet undertaking some sufferings not to be borne, some poverty and plainness not to be endured, and vainly imagining to understand the Way — how difficult it is!
