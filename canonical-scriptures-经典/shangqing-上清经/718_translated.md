# The Barrier of Arrogant Spirit

The Book of Changes says, "The superior man receives others with humility." It also says, "Be modest and honored, yet shining; be lowly, yet not to be surpassed." The Tao Te Ching says, "He does not display himself, therefore he is bright; he does not assert himself, therefore he is distinguished; he does not boast, therefore he has merit; he does not pride himself, therefore he endures." All these teach men to humble themselves and honor others, and not to harbour a heart of haughty self-righteousness. 

Indeed, those who study the Way must first cultivate an open heart and a lowly spirit; to be humble and small, neither full nor overflowing. They see only their own shortcomings, not their own merits. Keen and fond of learning, they do not disdain to ask those beneath them. Respectful to teachers and friends, utterly free from arrogance and impetuous airs, only then can they move sincere masters to point the way, and good friends to exhort them.

As a general rule, true masters and good friends seldom display their sharpness or their corners. If one is truly a determined man, he does not rely on his talents, nor claim ability; like a fool or a man of few words, the discerning eye sees him at once, and with secret attention will not easily abandon him. After long trial and proof, he will be supported and assisted. But those who are self-conceited and self-righteous, however bright and outstanding their learning, will be left unheeded.

Among the confused scholars of the world, as soon as they enter a school, they imagine themselves become immortals; as soon as they meet a master, they want secret formulas. They do not consider what the great Way is, nor what cultivation means; they are disrespectful and disdainful, madly hoping to gather treasures by simply walking the path. Some learn some minor skills and arrogantly fancy themselves to have attained the Way. Proud and arrogant, boasting of their saintliness, they display themselves before men. Even when meeting the wise, they refuse to bow their heads, and so miss the opportunity before their eyes.

Some have read a few volumes of Confucian books, understood a few phrases of their meaning, and remembered some alchemical scriptures or writings of the immortals; holding fast to their superficial semblance and muddy expressions, they consider themselves greatly enlightened, talk at length and with lofty airs, and look down on all under heaven; they no longer listen to the teachings of the wise. Rashly setting to work, they create confusion and disorder; not only is this of no benefit, but it brings harm. When grievous illness overtakes them, they recognize their error, but no cure is found, and repentance comes too late.

There is yet another class of ignorant literati, relying on their own learning and talent, guessing and privately judging, seeming right but actually wrong; when they meet the clergy of Taoism or Buddhism, they test scriptures against one another, and if not accommodated, they say there is no Way. When meeting true masters, they also show no sincerity or respect; swaggering with great airs, sitting high and speaking presumptuously, without the slightest restraint. Such as these, being lax and deceitful in heart, how can they hear the fragrant wind, or come near the shore of the Way?

The Way is not given to the unworthy; it steals the yin and yang, seizes creation, transcends life and death, escapes the cycle of rebirth, and is treasured by Heaven and Earth, and secret to the spirits. Unless one be a great sage, of great virtue, and of true heart and sincerity, how dare one leak it lightly, or suffer it to be lightly heard? Moreover, the secret essence of the great Way is not in words. The alchemical scriptures and writings of the immortals are the revelations of successive ancestral masters, illuminating principle and the Way, to guide later generations, so that they may expand their knowledge and verify it by their teachers. They are not meant to teach men to hold to books as the Way.

Among those who do not understand learning, they often hear only the sound of the drum, discerning not right from wrong, blind leading the blind. Among those who have some understanding of texts and meaning, they often cling to their own views, unwilling to bow their heads, persisting in error. All this arises from the disease of arrogance and self-sufficiency; arrogance and self-sufficiency are the absence of true heart. Without true heart to study the Way, who will sincerely point out the Way? Is it not to waste spirit and to ruin great matters?

I exhort those who truly study the Way to quickly break through the barrier of arrogant spirit; seek out bright teachers and good friends, and with sincerity and respect ask for instruction. Sweep away all evils of self-conceit, self-righteousness, self-praise, and self-pride; permit some of these seeds to be buried within, and become a humble, yielding, lowly person. Those who have not yet heard the Way will then be able to hear it; those who have heard it will then be able to attain it. For it is because one is small that one can be great; because one is lowly that one can be exalted; because one is yielding that one can be upright; because one is empty that one can be full. Otherwise, with arrogance filling the breast, and no man in the eyes, to rashly fancy one understands the bright Wayâ€”this is difficult indeed.
