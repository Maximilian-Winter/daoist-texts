# Gate of Rashness and Impatience

The Book of Changes says, "The noble man uses anger as a caution, and restrains his desires." The Scripture of the Yin Talisman says, "Fire is born of wood; when calamity arises, it surely prevails." Zengzi said, "When the heart is filled with resentment and sneezing, it is not rightly directed." Mencius said, "Hold fast to your purpose, but do not let your spirit be violent." The Song of Understanding the Way says, "Before refining the returning elixir, first refine the nature." All these speak of the violent spirit and acrid nature which harm the Way, and must be diligently removed by the mind.

Now the true scholar of the Way acts as if he were a virgin, nurturing his spirit like an infant. He makes softness and weakness foremost, takes peace and harmony as his root, complies with things and yields to them as his method in the world, and practises generosity and modesty as his chief endeavour. Formerly, Shakyamuni for five hundred kalpas was a celestial of forbearance, and at length attained Buddhahood. The Supreme Lord Lao called me a bull, to which I responded as a bull; called me a horse, to which I responded as a horse; and in the end became the Patriarch of the Way. The Perfect Lord of Eternal Spring once tasted human ordure, and so was able to accomplish greatly. The Perfected Master Sanfeng endured the slander of others, and so completed great affairs.

Merely through the heart’s yearning for the Way, knowing well that nature and life are weighty matters, and regarding all external evil words and evil deeds and all adverse circumstances as beyond consideration — he remains without recognition or knowledge. But the confused scholars of this world, not reflecting on the purpose of leaving home, (not knowing) who wear the headscarf and robe of the Way — bewildered and muddled, pass their days in folly. They delight in flattery and praise; only love those who comply with themselves, never do they comply with others. At the slightest collision, their acrid nature is roused; anger arises from this, resentment is born from this.

They pay no heed to water, fire, swords, or arms; fear neither pits, wells, precipices, nor rivers; and even contend by force for victory, causing harm to each other, entering the path of death, and some lose their lives. Not only this: once the violent spirit and acrid nature break forth, the primal spirit leaves the chamber, a great fire burns the body, the vital fluids dry up, and the correct qi disperses. The Three Treasures are injured, the Five Virtues return to emptiness; inwardly the true self is lost, outwardly virtue is destroyed, nature is disordered, life totters — before attaining others, one has already injured oneself. Is the harm of rashness and impatience a small matter?

I exhort the true-hearted scholar of the Way to quickly open the gate of rashness and impatience. Become a man of qi who can die for it; assume the guise of a mindless fool. Be as simple and as slow as a child; as deaf and dumb. When people revile, be so; when people strike, be so; when people hate and dislike, be so; when people slander, be so. Let the heart be like cold ashes, the nature like frozen ice. Without a trace of heat hidden within, then indeed is the gate of rashness and impatience jumped beyond. If there remain some heat within, though outwardly it does not show its form, inwardly it plants its root. When encountering adverse circumstances or injustice, there is no one who does not burst forth in anger.

The Scripture of the Way and Virtue says, "The highest good is like water. Water benefits all things and contends not; it dwells in places that all men disdain, and so it is near to the Way." It is because one can humble oneself before others that one can be exalted above them; because one can be weak before others that one can be strong over them. Otherwise, if rashness and impatience are not removed, one knows only self and not others; knows only to use strength and not to use weakness. Acting according to nature and following the heart’s desires, imagining to understand the Way — this is difficult indeed.
