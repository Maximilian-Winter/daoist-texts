# The Barrier of Self and Other

The Book of Changes says: "When the mountain stands behind, one cannot seize the body; when one walks in the courtyard, one does not see the man. No blame." It also says: "Fellowship with men in the open field is prosperous." The Diamond Sutra says: "No marks of self, no marks of other, no marks of sentient beings, no marks of lifespan." The sages say: "To be faithful and forgiving is not to depart far from the Way; what you would not wish done to yourself, do not do to others." Shang Yangzi said: "Quickly let go of the mountain of self and other; hasten to open the empty clash of dragon and tiger." All these speak of the necessity in cultivating the Way to have no view of self and other.

Yet, to desire no other is first to have no self. For where there is a self, the private heart arises. When the private heart arises, every word and deed, every movement and pause, must be for the self. If it must be for the self, then care is not given for others. When care is not given for others, others are harmed and self is benefited; Heaven is injured and principle confounded; nothing is left undone.

Consider at the beginning of life, without distinction of worth or folly, of noble or base, all share the same nature and life, the same form and frame; whence then is the division of this and that? If there be no division of this and that, then I am as another, another is as I; self and other are as one. This is the heart of Heaven and Earth, impartial and without private bias; this is the Way of sages, regarding all men as brothers and all creatures as one; this is the method of the cultivated man who forgets both self and other.

If the learner can guard this heart, this Way, this method, and act accordingly, he is then the embryo of sagehood, the seed of immortals and Buddhas; the great Way may then be hoped for. But the confused learners of the world know not the principle of impartiality and the same view of things and self. They cling to this body and regard it as the self. Once they acknowledge this as self, then there is other. Where there is self and other, there is division of this and that. When this and that are divided, the self is esteemed and the other despised. Within is the self, without is the other. They scheme day and night to enrich themselves, use every means to take from others. Every act and every matter, they will not yield to others; every commodity and every profit, they seek advantage. Not only in dealings with affairs and objects, but everywhere striving to prevail, in all affairs eager to be strong. Even with nearest friends and intimate acquaintances, colleagues and comrades, they insist on marking out self and other. They begrudge others the honour and goods, wishing to possess them alone; the world's good fortune, to be accomplished by themselves alone. Where there is profit they thrust in their heads and stretch out their hands; where there is none, they shrink their shoulders and hide their bodies.

They do not know that when the three inches of breath cease, all things are void; even this body does not belong to the self. When that time arrives, where is self? Where is other? Self and other alike vanish. Why then toil in the world with cunning and craft, forcibly dividing self and other, forging enmities alone? Is it not folly?

I exhort those who truly seek the Way with sincerity to quickly open the barrier of self and other; surely then they will be as at birth, with no self and no other; surely then as after death, with no self and no other. Regard all things as one body; regard the world as one family. To see another rejoicing, as if rejoicing oneself; to see another sorrowful, as if sorrowful oneself; to see another gain, as if gain were one's own; to see another lose, as if loss were one's own. Those who have wealth may aid the needy; those who have none may yet employ suitable means. Everywhere be helpful to others; in all matters accumulate virtue. When adversity comes, leave it to ignorance; when insult is added, lay it aside in unknowing. When able to spare others, then spare them; where retreat is suitable, then retreat. Such are the conduct and demeanour of the learner, seeking after the Way with true heart. Otherwise, with the view of self and other, the division of this and that, the piling up of private desires, the mind becomes obstructed and blinded, vainly imagining to understand the Way; difficult indeed!
