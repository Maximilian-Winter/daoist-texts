# The Gate of Yielding to Nature

The Tao Te Ching says: "He who sees himself is not clear; he who deems himself so is not illustrious." The ancient scriptures say: "He who clings with obstinacy is not clear in the Tao and Virtue." Mencius said: "Turning back to oneself and being sincere—there is no greater joy than this; exercising forbearance and acting thus—there is no closer approach to benevolence." The Odes say: "With excellent virtue and fair countenance, cautious and reverent." All these teach men to follow their feelings and reason in their conduct, not to yield to nature with obstinacy and stubbornness.

When a man is born, he receives the quality of later Heaven, the particular nature of his temperament: wise or foolish, good or evil, pure or impure, strong or weak—the differences are mutual. Only the sage, born by Heaven's special bestowal, has a nature perfectly clear and round, pure white and without blemish. Next come people of middling and low degrees, each bearing some partial ailment in their bodies. These are indeed great harms to one's nature and life. Though they are great harms, if one can truly know oneself, one can also transform one's temperament: turning foolishness into wisdom, evil into good, impurity into purity, weakness into strength. In this way one does not yield to one's nature, but draws near men of the Way, with a humble heart seeking instruction. Borrowing another's enlightenment to break through one's own web of confusion; borrowing another's sharpening to remove one's own flaws. It is said, "The stones of other mountains may be used to polish the jade."

By gradual practice and rising progress, by gradual learning and increasing goodness, though foolish one will become clear, though soft one will become strong. Why fear that the Way is not clear, or that cultivation will not be accomplished?

The confused learners of the world do not know the harm of yielding to nature. They desire to learn the Way, yet indulge their nature and refuse to learn goodness; they think to learn the Way, yet yield to nature and do not esteem the Way. Some receive the teachings of their teacher and obey in appearance only, disobeying in heart; some are reproved by friends but say yes with their face and no in their heart; some work with others but act arrogantly and boastfully; some live with others but contend for superiority and love to win; some rely on their own learning to expose the faults of others; some depend on their own cleverness to laugh at the foolishness of others; some speak without yielding to others; some clash and anger arises easily; some oppress the weak and cannot live in harmony with the many; some have narrow minds and cannot tolerate things. All these are the evils of yielding to nature. Not only do they draw hatred and dislike from without, but within they sow poison and bitterness. The lifelong partial ailments are not removed; the folly one carries is not diminished. They think themselves right and refuse to admit errors. If thus they study the Way, even though they stand before Laozi himself, or dwell with Shakyamuni, what benefit will it bring?

If one be a true man, his heart devoted to the Way: he sits in stillness and often reflects on his own faults; in idle talk he does not discuss the faults of others. In all things he is cautious; at every step he examines himself; he follows others and reason; he adapts to the circumstances and attunes to the whole; he is without stubbornness and without self. He regards retreat as progress, and unresisting as the greatest strength. Where is one who, without deep cultivation, attains to self-contentment?

I exhort the sincere learner of the Way to quickly open the gate of yielding to nature. Bowing the head in conduct, gentle and weak to maintain the body; gradually cast away all stubborn partial ailments, all self-righteous and self-justifying clauses. Learn to be a man without nature; assume the guise of a foolish, deaf, dumb, and dull man; ever keep watch on great affairs of the person. In time, there will surely be gain. Otherwise, yielding to nature blindly, firm and not soft, erring and not correcting, though one be in the Way for a lifetime, one will vainly imagine that hearing the Way is difficult.
