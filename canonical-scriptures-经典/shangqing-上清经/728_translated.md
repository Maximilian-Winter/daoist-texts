# The Pass of Adversity and Distress

The Book of Changes says, ‘In distress, and yet not losing one's place, there is success.’ Is this not the way of the superior man? The Doctrine of the Mean says, ‘One is naturally afflicted with adversity, and acts amid adversity.’ The Perfected of Eternal Spring said, ‘Sickness is but a teaching of other sickness; death is but a teaching of other death. At the final death, one makes a single step, embracing the Way and passing away.’ All these sayings teach that one should not, because of adversity and distress, change the original purpose.

The Way encompasses Heaven and Earth, secretly seizes the transformation of Nature, passes through death into life, transcends the common to enter the sacred, and becomes Buddha and Immortal. Without great courage and great strength, a man like iron who supports Heaven and stands upon Earth, a diamond to cast off dust and transcend the vulgar, one who knows not the Way cannot bear it, cannot carry it, cannot hold it. How is this great courage and great strength manifested? To be unmoved by wealth and honour; to be unshaken by poverty and lowliness; to be not bent by power and might—this is great strength. Not to be led by favour and affection; not to be enticed by fame and profit—this is great strength. To rise not in sorrow, fear, or alarm—this is great strength. To lay aside fully anger, joy, grief, and pleasure—this is great strength. To be unmoved and unshaken amid hardship and danger—this is great courage. To follow nature in sickness and calamity—this is great courage. To remain unchanged even unto death through hunger, cold, frost, and famine—this is great courage. To be ignorant and unconscious of shame, outrage, and insult—this is great courage.

Thus did Shakyamuni meet King Koli, and cut his own flesh without knowing it; thus did the Pure Yang Elder meet the True Yang Patriarch, and was tried ten times without harm; the Purple Clarity taught by shouting and scolding, and departed without anger; the Three Peaks wore torn clothes and broken shoes without regret; the Perfected of Long Life received blows from men without contention; the Perfected of Eternal Spring had his ribs broken thrice without looking back. These sages and worthies were all tempered by adversity and distress, enduring infinite suffering and pain. Therefore at length they heard the great law, understood the great Way, transcended the common to enter the sacred, and accomplished these rare and great matters.

The muddled learners of the world know not that adversity is the great medicine of true cultivation, the furnace and hammer of attaining the Way. But they fear adversity and avoid it. Some, upon suffering a little hunger or cold, take up strange doctrines; some, upon meeting some illness, give rise to delusive thoughts; some, upon encountering danger, think to retreat; some, when insulted, immediately engage in dispute. They know not that true gold must be refined in great fire, and the lotus must grow from the mire. Without fire there is no brightness of gold; without mire there is no purity of the lotus.

What is adversity but a trial? Only in adversity is the rank and file of men revealed; only in adversity is the true or false spirit of men tested. I exhort those who sincerely seek the Way to quickly open the pass of adversity. To fix firmly the two words ‘Nature and Life.’ Life is this; death is also this. All great calamities and great hardships, great dangers and great perils, commit them to Heaven, and meet them with a mind unmoved. With time, misfortune naturally transforms into good fortune, and disaster changes to blessing. Otherwise, when meeting adversity one fears adversity, the mind unsettled, and the will wavering. Without adversity one brings adversity upon oneself; small adversity becomes great adversity. To imagine one understands the Way is difficult indeed.
