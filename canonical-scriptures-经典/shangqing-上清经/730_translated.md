# The Gate of Distrustful Speculation

The Ancient Canon says: Were there no teachers to point out and make known, the celestial immortals in heaven would find no abiding place. Wu Zhen says: Though thou art cleverer than Yan Min, if thou meetest not a true master, force not thy conjectures. Again it is said: If thou wouldst know the place where the secret formula communicates with the origin, thou must carefully discourse with the immortals. San Feng the Perfected says: The fullness of the moon abides in the formula; when the hour comes at the midnight, the marvel lies in the transmission of the heart. Again he says: Bow before a wise master, inquire of the method; to begin the practice speedily is yet too late. All these words signify that the Way must be transmitted by a master, and is not to be known by rash conjecture or private opinion.

For the Great Way is profound and subtle beyond measure; great it fills the universe, small it penetrates to the tip of a hair. Its greatness has no outside, its smallness no inside. If a man can cultivate it, he may seize upon creation, pass forth from yin and yang, comprehend life and destiny, become an immortal or a Buddha, endure as long as Heaven and Earth, shine as brightly as the sun and moon. He is anterior to Heaven, and Heaven does not oppose him; posterior to Heaven, he serves the heavenly season. This is not to be compared with all other false paths or heterodox schools.

Yet the Way has an inner yin and yang, and an outer yin and yang; an inner five phases, and an outer five phases. There is the true and the false; the false within the true, the true within the false; the true within the true, the false within the false. The cultivation requires due time and season, a certain order: there is action and non-action, a beginning and an end to the arrangement; there is the gathering of herbs, the compounding of medicines, the forming of the elixir, the taking of the elixir, the forming of the embryo, the shedding of the embryo. The matters are manifold, the methods not uniform.

If one has not a wise master to guide him from beginning to end, to discriminate each point and to instruct with care, it is hard to know by oneself. Though one consult the many Perfected of old, the elixir scriptures and treatises, a thousand methods of analogy, ten thousand forms of description, the medicines and the due time of fire are all complete; yet the origin and subtlety of the Way, its minute workings, are such that speech cannot express them, discourse cannot reach them. How much more when one uses that which has form to illustrate what has no form, and that which has image to point to what has no image!

Moreover, in later times there are blind men who borrow the names of the ancient masters, and rashly fabricate and cling to their own fancies, slandering the holy Way, confusing the immortal scriptures, mingling truth and falsehood. If one relies on his own understanding and thinks he has attained, but does not verify with the enlightened, once he enters into the snare, he will find it hard to escape all his life. Even the clever and talented, who distinguish right from wrong, and have some comprehension, have only a beginning and no end, seeming true and yet false. How can they truly know and surely see, and accomplish everything by one?

The ignorant learners of the world know not the depth and shallowness of knowledge, nor the weight and lightness of destiny; with the light of a firefly, they would fain break the net of Heaven's delusion. They seek no true master, but only themselves. Some look to heterodox and counterfeit books, and learn some skill in manipulation, clinging to it their whole life, immovable and unbreakable, thereby losing their days. Others seeing the true scriptures of the ancient masters, recite them day and night, but do not study their meaning, only acknowledge their images. Seeing mention of medicines, furnaces, and cauldrons, they suspect mere fire-refining; seeing mention of male and female yin and yang, they guess it to be the secret elixir of chambers; seeing mention of dragon, tiger, tortoise, and snake, they suspect the heart, kidney, liver, and lung; seeing mention of reversal and contrary movements, they guess it to be ascending after descending; seeing mention of precious pearls, they suspect some material form; seeing mention of the holy embryo, they guess it to be the coagulation of qi and blood; seeing mention of purity and stillness, they suspect it to be the preservation of spirit and regulation of breath; seeing mention of action, they guess it to be contrivance; seeing mention of non-action, they guess it to be emptiness and silence. Such cases are innumerable.

All these are confused guesses and wild conjectures, ending in vain delusion. I urge those with true hearts seeking the Way to speedily break open the gate of distrustful speculation. Put aside the talents and tricks of thy pride in all thy life, seek a true master, and open the mystery of the profound meaning. By no means rely on thine own false cleverness, rashly conjecture and estimate, deceiving only thyself. Otherwise, not verifying with others but seeking only in thyself, not searching without but fabricating within, and vainly imagining to practise the Way, it will be difficult indeed.
