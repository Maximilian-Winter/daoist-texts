# The Gate of Suspending Emptiness

The Confucian says: True practice is to walk the path of reality.  
The Buddhist says: To walk deeply in the perfection of Prajñā-pāramitā.  
The Daoist says: To be courageous, vigorous, and diligent.  

The sages of the three teachings all esteem the true heart and practical use, and do not employ suspending emptiness to carry out affairs. The Way of cultivating truth is the study of exhausting principle, fulfilling nature, and reaching destiny. To exhaust principle is to investigate this truth thoroughly; to fulfill nature is to bring this truth to completion; to reach destiny is to attain this truth fully. To exhaust, to fulfill, and to reach, all relate to truth; therefore, there must not be a speck of falsehood or admixture therein — this is clear. If there is any speck of falsity or admixture, then the heart is not single, and the conduct is not vigorous. How then to penetrate into the cavern of principle and behold the true treasure? How to move the true teacher to joy, who points out the path of principle?  

Hence the sages of old, upon hearing a single good word or seeing a single good deed, were like rivers and streams breaking through, overwhelming all resistance. The Way contains the three vehicles: those who strive for the highest vehicle are men of superior wisdom, quick to comprehend, who, once enlightened, understand all; born knowing, at ease in practice. Those who strive for the middle vehicle are men of average wisdom, who comprehend by analogy and implication, who hear one thing and know two, who learn and then know, who act with profit and ease. Those who strive for the lowest vehicle are men of inferior wisdom, who exhaust themselves in study, whose skill is deep and slowly won; weary yet learning, striving yet acting. The three vehicles are to be followed according to men’s strength and capacity.  

Yet though there be these three ranks, all must earnestly exert themselves on the ground of reality. If one suspends emptiness and is not sincere, neglecting to concern oneself, then not only the middle and lower persons fail to advance, but even the superior wisdom falls into emptiness and nothingness. In former days, Bodhidharma practised beneath the long hut, sitting cold in Shaolin; Hui Neng served in Huangmei, undergoing trials in Four Assemblies; Qiu Zu spent seven years at Dragon Gate, and six years at Panxi; they purified their bodies and broke their ribs, doubling their spirit and energy. Like these sages and worthies, all made true heart and true intention their practice; therefore they were able to transcend the mundane and enter the sage’s realm, accomplishing great affairs.  

In the world, confused learners, having entered the gate of the Way, know not for what they strive, and muddle through their days. They are ever intent on satisfying the appetite; daily they enter and exit disputes of right and wrong; with fox friends and dog allies, they talk trifling words and busy their minds with petty matters. Their eyes do not look upon the words of the Patriarchs; their ears do not listen to the good words of the enlightened. Even if they recite the scriptures, it is but to glance as one rides a horse past flowers; they do not apply their hearts and minds to seek the deep meaning. Even if they meet an enlightened master and hear instruction, it is like the autumn wind passing the ear; they apply no effort to investigate the flavour.  

Moreover, there is a class of foolish men with loose tongues who think that the alchemical scriptures do not retain secret formulas, and disdain to examine them. If they chance upon an enlightened person, they seek to take the Way easily. Failing to obtain it, they immediately withdraw. Today they seek Wang, tomorrow they worship Li; now learning this, now learning that; their purpose is unstable, their resolve not lasting. How have they ever regarded nature and destiny as matters of great concern? They often spend a lifetime in the Way and never attain anything; is this not pitiable and lamentable?  

I exhort those who truly in heart seek the Way to speedily break through the gate of suspending emptiness. To fix the heart firmly on the ground, daily to attend to nature and destiny, at every moment to apply care to principle and righteousness; to rectify one by one all actions of suspending emptiness and untruth. First exhaust principle, then seek the teacher. Be broad in learning, careful in inquiry, cautious in thinking, clear in discrimination, and earnest in practice. What cause is there to fear that the great Way is unclear, or nature and destiny uncomprehended? Otherwise, suspending emptiness and falsity, conduct wild and reckless, time wasted in vain, heart not fixed, purpose not attained, vainly imagining to know the Way — how difficult it will be!
