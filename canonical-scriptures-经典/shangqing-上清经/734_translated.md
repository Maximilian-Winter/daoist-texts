# The Gate of Self-Contentment

The Book of Changes says: "Xun is under the bed; to employ the shaman so confused and fluttering is auspicious." The Tao Te Ching says: "Empty your mind, fill your belly." Shang Yangzi said: "The Way has three admonitions. All who study the Way, though their hearts yearn and turn towards it, yet if they are proud of their wealth and honour, unwilling to lower themselves to inquire, seeming to disdain the mean, this is called craft and deceit; be admonished and do not associate with them. The next class of learners, who have but heard a little of the minor teachings of the side doors, and who strive only to argue forcibly so as to display their private wisdom, this is called vainglory and confusion; be admonished and do not associate with them. The third class of learners are those whose belief and doubt are half and half; who are not troubled by life and death, who value wealth more than their persons; this is ignorance of destiny; be admonished and do not associate with them.
All these speak of not being full nor brimming; only thus can one receive benefit. The great Way of the sages and worthies is without end and without limit, without boundary and without shore. It has substance and function, a root and a branch, gradations subtle and delicate, and a vast and remote undertaking. The more one looks up, the higher it is; the more one drills down, the harder it is. One man's knowledge is limited, while the opinions of many are without number. Without the capacity to lower oneself beneath others, one cannot learn; without the capacity to bend oneself before others, one cannot know; without the capacity to show one's own emptiness, one cannot advance; without the capacity to honour the possession of others, one cannot obtain.
For he who can lower himself beneath others, thereby is he able to rise above them; he who can bend himself before others, thereby is he able to be exalted above them; he who can show his own emptiness, thereby is he able to receive the possession of others; he who can honour the possession of others, thereby is he able to aid his own emptiness. Therefore it is said, "When full, it overflows; when hollow, it is full; fullness is not to be valued as much as emptiness."
In antiquity, the Duke of Zhou bathed but thrice and grasped thrice in order to honour the worthy. Huainanzi met the Eight Masters, dishevelled and barefoot, to worship and receive them. Shi Xinglin met Ziyang, loosening reins and unlocking fetters to offer service. The Patriarch of Changchun first studied the Way from the Ancestor Wang, and later followed the Patriarch Ma to receive instruction and complete his task. Shang Yangzi first met Yuandu and obtained some attainment, then sought the guidance of Qingcheng to perfect his accomplishment. All these sages and worthies succeeded by being humble of heart and thus attaining the great Way.
Suppose the Duke of Zhou, grasping at his dignity, were to fail to honour the worthy, how could he be called a sage? Suppose Huainanzi were to hold himself in honour and fail to show respect to the Eight Masters, how could he become an immortal? Suppose Patriarch Qiu were self-content and did not follow Patriarch Ma, how could he complete his task? Suppose Shang Yangzi were self-sufficient and did not seek Qingcheng, how could he attain great success? Especially in the study of nature and life, not knowing one place is to be lost in another; a variance of a hair's breadth leads to error of a thousand li.
What is clear is one thing; what is practised is another; what is understood in a principle is one thing; what is done in a method is another. If one knows the substance but not the function, knows the falsehood but not the truth, knows nature but not destiny, knows the beginning but not the end, knows gathering but not releasing, knows advance but not retreat, knows haste but not slowness, knows good fortune but not misfortune, knows greatness but not smallness, knows root but not branch, knows action but not non-action, knows the first step but not the result—such a one cannot be said to understand the Way.
If one, having some knowledge of the portal, is already self-content and self-sufficient, thinking the Way lies therein, and looks down upon all under heaven, never seeking others—how can he thoroughly penetrate from beginning to end, be free to go right or left, and be unrestricted and unobstructed, directly reaching the saintly domain?
In the world, foolish learners, relying on their own cleverness, recklessly judge and suspect, depending on themselves and not seeking others. Some, immoderately learned, talk grandly and at length, self-content and not seeking others; some obtain a little of the minor teachings, unable to distinguish right from wrong, are arrogant and do not verify; some meet with a superior who points the way and by this know the entrance, and are self-satisfied and do not advance deeply. There is yet another class, the worldly and powerful, of bookish and vulgar scholars, who take up their status, puff up their chests, fearing ridicule, and will not humble themselves. Such as these all suffer harm from self-contentment; how can they hear the profound words of a true teacher, enter the great thoroughfare of the Way, or advance into the halls of sages and worthies?
I exhort those who truly wish to learn the Way to quickly open the gate of self-contentment. Lower your heart and demean yourself; appear as if you are inferior to all. Whether old or young, wise or foolish, high or low, honour all without distinction. When you see a man with the slightest excellence, immediately with sincere heart seek instruction, and do not let the opportunity pass. Broadly learn and carefully question; every man is my teacher, and everywhere there is something to learn. Why fear that principles cannot be understood, or the Way cannot be accomplished? Otherwise, self-content and self-full, making nothing to be something—though there be true teachers, they desire to guide, but no opening is admitted; to vainly hope to understand the Way is difficult indeed.
