# The Barrier of Weakness

The Doctrine of the Mean says: The Way is not far from man; if man, in seeking the Way, departs from man, this cannot be called the Way. The Perfect Sage said: Has there ever been one who, for a single day, exerted his strength in benevolence? I have never seen strength insufficient. The Awakening to Truth says: The great medicine does not seek to contend for recognition; if it be met and not refined, that is folly and ignorance. The ancient scriptures say: The Way does not act in vain; it waits on men and then acts. These all speak of the necessity, in cultivating the Way, of valour and diligent progress, and warn against weakness and slackness.

Man, born with the genuine qi of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang, and the Five Elements, is chief among all things. Without distinction of noble or base, wise or foolish, strong or weak, all partake alike of Heaven and Earth’s entire work, and may bear the great Way of Heaven and Earth. Therefore, the fool may be associated with the wise; the unworthy may follow the worthy. This lies between having aspiration and having none. With aspiration, the weak may be changed into the strong, and the strong may gradually ascend to the shore of the Way. Without aspiration, even the strong become weak; the weak cannot transcend the sea of suffering.

What is called aspiration is firmness and decision. With this firmness and decision, worldly affairs cannot stain, affection cannot bind, selfish desire cannot arise, fame and profit cannot allure, wealth and honour cannot seduce, poverty and lowliness cannot move, adversity cannot shake. One knows only the Way, not other things; attends only to the nature and life, not to other matters. All things external to the body are powerless to impede. One may hear the Way and cultivate the Way.

Without firmness and decision, one cannot see through worldly affairs, cannot shake off affection, cannot sweep away selfish desires. Seeing wealth and honour, the heart is moved; dwelling in poverty and lowliness, the purpose changes; meeting adversity, one is not truly unaffected; day by day in false conditions, one does not perceive the falsehood; body in the sea of suffering, one knows not the suffering. Though for a time the heart of the Way appears, the spirit of firmness is weak, and quickly arises and quickly perishes. Fear of wolves before, fear of tigers behind; fear of hunger and fear of cold; fear of toil upon the body, fear of failure in the Way. The present is delayed; progress is postponed; the mind is unsettled; weakness and fear prevail. On what ground then to learn the Way, on what ground to hear the Way, on what ground to pursue the Way?

The bewildered learners of the world, though called students of the Way, are not like those who truly study the Way. They vainly imagine hearing the Way, yet do not act on the Way. In the twelve hours of a day, how often do they give heed to body, mind, nature, and life? They only talk of food and clothing, discuss right and wrong, seek amusement, contend for victory. Every movement resembles that of the world’s men; their actions differ not from the ordinary. Seeing advantage, they pry and seek openings; meeting work to be done, they hide and retreat. They make pleasure amid suffering, act in dreams. Their heads may be full of hardness, but in matters of real concern they are powerless.

They never think that wearing the Way’s robe, covering the head with the Way’s kerchief, having tasted the ointment of the ten directions, and yet doing truly serious things for themselves, is not a great gain; but instead slacken and exert no strength, wasting their years in emptiness, borrowing and indebting, receiving rewards without merit — how can this be dispelled?

Moreover, the matter of cultivating the True is not that you expend great bodily strength or do reckless deeds. It is but a single, lasting thought in the heart, a firm and resolute will, that can create. Shakyamuni Buddha did not descend from Heaven; Laozi of the Old came not from beneath the earth; Confucius was not formed from the wind. They had the same eyes and ears, the same flesh and skin as other men; all depended first on exhausting human effort, and then obtained the verification of the sage’s rank. Therefore Mencius said: Yao and Shun were men like others.

Thus the sages, worthies, immortals, and Buddhas all formed themselves by self-cultivation. Everyone may become sage or worth, everyone may become immortal or Buddha. The only hindrance is weakness and incapacity, the unwillingness to establish firm resolve. I exhort the true-hearted student of the Way to quickly break through the barrier of weakness; to steady the pillar and staff, to raise a brave and valiant spirit, to fix a firm and lasting heart, to advance step by step, and enter straight ahead with a single sword.

At every moment be mindful of nature and life; in every action and step exhaust reason on the Way. Where ignorance prevails, be resolute to seek knowledge; where darkness reigns, labour to bring forth light. Should you meet a wise teacher, simply with utmost sincerity and heart enter into learning. Do not vainly seek secret formulas, nor hastily question of heart transmission. The teaching is to suffer and thereby remove suffering; to die, and thereby accept death; to hunger, and thereby endure hunger.

As for beating, scolding, and grinding, all these are gladly borne without the least resentment, and thus matters may be helped. Only by enduring what others cannot bear, can one attain what others cannot attain; by suffering what others cannot suffer, can one know what others cannot know. Otherwise, if one be only weak and without vigour, possessing no strength, how can one bear the great Way? To vainly imagine understanding the Way is difficult indeed.
