# The Gate of Faithlessness

The Tao Te Ching says: "The superior man, when he hears of the Tao, diligently practices it; the average man, when he hears of the Tao, half believes, half doubts; the inferior man, when he hears of the Tao, bursts into loud laughter." The Diamond Sutra says: "Good men and good women, when they arouse the mind of Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi, should abide thus and thus subdue their hearts." The mind of Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi is, in the Chinese tongue, the mind of supreme, perfect, and equal enlightenment, that is, the mind of faith. The Book of Changes says: "Central sincerity, like a pig or fish, is auspicious." The Doctrine of the Mean says: "Sincerity is the beginning and the end of all things; without sincerity nothing exists." Therefore, the gentleman esteems sincerity as precious. The sages of the three teachings have handed down their instructions, all taking sincerity as the root of the path of cultivation.

Now faith is not the faith of words, nor the faith of information; it is the faith of true heart and genuine intention. The one word "faith" contains the truest principle and the greatest power. It can move heaven and earth, communicate with spirits, turn life and death, reverse birth and killing; it makes one a sage or a worthy man, a Buddha or an immortal; it is the first and highest treasure of those who cultivate the Way. The learner who firmly fixes this one word, and holds it tightly in heart and chest, never leaving it for a moment, has already established the great root, unshaken and unaltered. From this point, progress is possible; one may hear the Tao and practise the Tao; one may understand nature and comprehend destiny. Since ancient times, which immortal or perfected one has not taken his stand upon faith, which one has not attained the Way from faith?

Yet faith is not idle and vain imagination, nor is it mere vain talk; it is single-mindedness in the Way, without second thought, mindful of it continually, morning and evening, never forgetting for a moment. He who does not regard nature and life as a great matter cannot have faith; he who does not look upon the world as a tattered garment cannot have faith; he who cannot resist temptation when rich and honoured, cannot have faith; he who cannot remain unmoved when poor and lowly, cannot have faith; he who cannot stand firm before power and might, cannot have faith; he who does not look down upon all things, seeing all as emptiness, cannot have faith; he who does not remain unchanged until death, placing good and evil, fortune and misfortune beyond his concern, cannot have faith. If in the smallest part of the heart there be the least doubt, or the slightest neglect, that is not faith. It is plain to see that true faith is sincere, single, advancing daily and moving with the times. He who can do this advances daily; he who reverses this wastes his years.

Yet faith must be discriminated between right and wrong, and divided between false and true. In the world there are those who err and enter by side doors and heterodox paths, holding firm all their lives, stubborn and unchanging unto death — is not this also faith? But faith that is not right becomes faith that harms. Therefore, the learner of the Way values faith, but values especially the obtaining of right faith; only so is it true faith in the Way. Among the confused learners of the world, none are firm in the Way. Throughout the day and night, their thoughts rise and fall, at the mercy of a host of demons in rebellion; never for a moment do they place the Way in their hearts. At times when there is no matter pressing, they suddenly begin to turn over the scrolls of books, but without savoring them; then they think of other matters, and their hearts are torn away by ghosts and fiends.

There are others who for a while arouse their righteous spirit, advancing with vigour and courage, discerning principles and truths, seeking teachers and friends; but long failing to find, they become slack in heart. There are those who hear a little of the incense breeze, but seeing no quick effect, become doubtful and hesitate to proceed; there are those who enter into error, producing sickness, yet do not repent but blame themselves, even calling the classics of alchemy false and vain. Such kinds of persons are innumerable. Unable to penetrate the Way, how can they know the Tao?

I exhort the true-hearted learner of the Way to quickly break open the gate of faithlessness. Fix nature and life firmly; sweep away all evil hearts and evil affairs; establish anew a diamond-like will; steadfastly and truly advance forward; care not whether you succeed or fail; whether you attain learning or not; persist until death. In the darkness, spirits and gods will secretly support you, and in the end good things will come. Otherwise, to-day pursuing this, to-morrow that; now forward, now backward; sometimes faith, sometimes doubt; uncertain and wavering, deludedly imagining the Way — this is difficult indeed.
