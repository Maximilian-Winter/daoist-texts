# The Gate of No Lordship

The Book of Changes says: "First deliberate, and then speak; first consult, and then act; it is by deliberation and consultation that changes are brought to completion." The Doctrine of the Mean says: "If the word be fixed beforehand, there will be no stumbling; if the matter be settled beforehand, there will be no perplexity; if the course be determined beforehand, there will be no remorse; if the Way be resolved beforehand, there will be no exhaustion." All these teach that in every undertaking it is precious to have beforehand a master director and fixed view.

Now, he who studies the Way must first possess in himself a master director. Having a master director, and firmly recognizing the nature and life, then the true mind is revealed. When the true mind is revealed, it is not defiled by the affairs of the world; it neither clings to affection nor covets fame or profit; all things outside the person are not hung upon the breast; the mind is concentrated and the will fixed. Hardship may be borne, adversity is unknown. By this means the principle may be exhausted, and the principle being exhausted, it may be understood; the teaching may be listened to, and the teaching being listened to, it may be apprehended. This is because the master director is within, and external things cannot perplex.

But in establishing a master director one must distinguish the two paths of true and false. The true master director is beneficial to nature and life; the false master director is hurtful to nature and life. If one do not distinguish true from false, but perversely follow the side paths and enter the false roads, seeking hidden deeds and strange acts, variously contriving, there is no benefit, but harm. In truth, there is no master director; it is not called master director.

Therefore one must first carefully discriminate, and truly recognize the right path; then, standing firm on the right path, with one heart and one mind proceed; every step is beneficial, and daily there are signs of success. This is what is called being careful at the beginning and preserving oneself to the end. The Book of Changes says: "Going not out of the door or gate, no blame." This means there is previously a fixed view.

The worldâ€™s confused learners, though they say they study nature and life, in truth do not know the weight of nature and life; neither do they know what the affairs of nature and life are. They regard them lightly, view them as easy, and vaguely, and yet want to finish with nature and life. Without a fixed master director, they heed only the sound of the drum. Today they study this, tomorrow that; in the morning they worship Li, in the evening they worship Wang, and thus fill themselves with a bellyful of old and miscellaneous matters. They act at will, and when injured, have no remedy; repentance comes too late.

Some see phantom sights and false appearances, and think them efficacious, not distinguishing right from wrong, thus losing their future; or when they meet a true teacher, have no long abiding thought, now coming, now going. The cause of this is that they have no genuine master director, so they are suspended in emptiness and unreality, wasting their years, and their life is empty and vain.

I exhort those who truly seek the Way with a true mind to quickly open the gate of no lordship, and fix the master director. First exhaust the principle, using the mind day and night; delve into the real meaning, and taste its flavour. Do not confine yourself by years or months; the longer the more earnest. Delve and delve, till you bring forth features and outlines, and truly come to know. Naturally the master director becomes firmer, and wisdom more open. Thence hold fast to this master director, and never let go. Then seek a teacher to confirm it, carefully adjusting the time and degree, pointing out application, so as truly to succeed.

Even if you err and go astray, do things improperly, and your heart be doubtful, it is no harm to seek the instruction of the wise; openly confess without concealment, examine and dispel doubts; though you do not attain the truth, you may yet escape disaster. Otherwise, without a genuine master director, there is confusion and death; not knowing right from wrong, not distinguishing true and false, having no fixed master director; intending to seek life, but hastening death; vainly imagining the Way, how difficult it is!
