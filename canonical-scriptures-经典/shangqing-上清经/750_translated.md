# The Gate of Carelessness

The Most Sage said: "To learn without thinking is perplexity; to think without learning is peril." Again he said: "Reviewing the old to know the new." Mencius said: "The officer of the heart is thought; if it thinks, it obtains; if it does not think, it obtains not." The Awakening to Truth says: "The common speech often speaks of harmonizing with the holy Way; one ought to seek it carefully within. If one seeks it invertedly in daily usage, the dust and sand of the great earth all become treasures." The ancient scripture says: "To recognize One, all matters are finished; to use Two, there is a place to go; to acknowledge Three, do not seek to pry." All these are words for the learner to attend carefully to principles, requiring true knowledge and clear insight, and not to treat matters carelessly and lightly. The study of nature and life is of utmost importance and greatness; it is not like the common trivial affairs of the world which can be managed with some carelessness or error. If one desires to seek long life but errs even slightly, one hastens death instead; how can it be taken lightly? Therefore, to comprehend nature and life, one must first investigate thoroughly the principles of nature and life, and then proceed to the deeds pertaining to nature and life.

The principles of nature and life are neither tangible substances within the body, nor are they the heaviest and most turbid things outside the body. On reaching this point, both Heaven and men must be amazed and doubtful. Those who are amazed and doubtful ask, if it is neither within the body nor outside the body, where is it to be grasped? Since ancient times, there have been three thousand six hundred side paths, and three hundred and sixty winding passages, each branching into leaves and twigs, each holding its own gate. Through error upon error, blind leading the blind, the branches and twigs multiply ever more with time. Strange and strange, the ears are full of bells and clappers, and the eyes covered by swarming bees and flies. There are matters never to be seen, never to be conceived, coming and going beyond the mind’s reach; there are those utterly unlike the Way, which may only deceive the ignorant and bewildered, but cannot deceive the wise. As for those which seem right but are mistaken, which appear to be the Way but are not the Way, or are not the Way but yet seem to be the Way, not only do the ignorant believe them, even the wise are deceived. Once caught in the net, one cannot escape all one’s life. 

For example, the alchemical books mention yin and yang, five elements, original essence and vital breath, and other such terms. The strategists take yin and yang as male and female; the ignorant believe this, the wise do not. The adepts count the inhalation of breath as yang and the exhalation as yin; both ignorant and wise believe this. Some say the five elements are heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney; the ignorant believe this, the wise do not. Some say the five elements are spirit, soul, ethereal soul, and intention; both ignorant and wise believe this. Some say the original spirit is the spirit of thought, the original breath is the breath of respiration, the original essence is the essence of interaction; the ignorant believe this, the wise do not. Some say the original spirit dwells in the Heavenly Valley, the original breath in the Sea of Qi, the original essence in the Elixir Field; both ignorant and wise believe this. 

Again, the alchemical books speak of nature, life, original female, Yellow Court and other images. Some say kidney qi is life, heart spirit is nature; the ignorant believe this, the wise do not. Some say success and failure, longevity and death are life; virtue and folly, good and evil are nature; both ignorant and wise believe this. Some say the original female is at the Life Gate, the Yellow Court in the brain; the ignorant believe this, the wise do not. Some say the original female is the throat, the Yellow Court in the navel wheel; both ignorant and wise believe this. Again, the alchemical books speak of clarity, purity, emptiness and non-being, and the refining of the Golden Elixir; some say that cultivating the inner elixir requires perfect purity and emptiness, while the outer elixir requires gathering herbs and refining them to maturity; inner elixir cultivation is for consummating nature, outer elixir consumption is to connect with life; whether ignorant or wise, all believe this. 

All these side paths which seem right but are mistaken are the easiest to confuse men. Since ancient times, innumerable clever and worthy men, heroes and gentlemen, have been deceived by them. Their busy lives ended in no conclusion. Little do they know that the cultivation of the true Great Way is to cultivate the primordial true One ancestral qi. This qi is vague, remote, and dark; it is called rare, called obscure, called subtle. To the sight it is invisible, to the hearing inaudible, to the grasp unattainable. Yet though unseen, unheard, unattainable, it is truly the utmost non-being containing the utmost being, the utmost void containing the utmost substance, producing heaven and earth, containing yin and yang, embracing the five elements, comprehending all principles, and including all phenomena. It is not to be sought within the body, nor to be searched for without the body, but comes from within the void and non-being. Nature and life dwell here; birth and death rest here; immortals and Buddhas are perfected here; the furnace and cauldron find rest here; herbs are gathered here; the fire and timing are managed here; the four images harmonize here; the five elements collect here; the Golden Elixir is completed here; the sage embryo is formed here. The reversal of yin and yang lies here; the theft of creation lies here; transcendence of the ordinary and entrance into the holy lies here. Even the original female gate, original vital apertures, Yellow Court, and earthen cauldron are all here. That which is said to be "attaining the One and all things are finished" is this. This secret from Heaven, Earth, and ghosts and spirits cannot be measured or reckoned; how can it be commonly known or easily understood? Only those of great wisdom and great understanding can know it; only those of great merit and great virtue can comprehend it; only those of great strength and great suffering can learn it; only those of great ambition and great capacity can advance in it; only those who pursue it with care, endure long, and exert diligent effort can attain it. Moreover, cultivation has rules; operation has timing; the work has order; each step is not the same, adapting as circumstances change. Though one must delve oneself, one also needs the guidance of a clear teacher.

As for the myriad volumes of alchemical scriptures, most use the visible to compare with the invisible, the tangible to illustrate the intangible. Can carelessness understand them? Can negligence perceive the truth? The muddled scholars of the world cannot apply their minds, cannot put in the hard labour, cannot endure the years and months. With half a phrase, they desire to be thoroughly enlightened; seeming right but mistaken, they desire to accomplish the Way. They accept the comparisons but do not probe the true meaning; they note the keywords but do not carefully taste the flavour. No wonder, when they see false books they act falsely; when they meet side paths they go out of the way. They do not distinguish truth from falsehood, nor right and wrong, only saying "every gate has a Way, every book expounds the truth." They rush into disorder and bring calamity upon themselves. All this is the result of carelessness and lack of careful attention. 

I exhort the sincere hearted who would learn the Way to quickly clear the barrier of carelessness. Delve carefully; peel away principle layer by layer, and with one insight progress to the next. One must separate the false from the true; distinguish right and wrong; see the essence of principle; know the vital hinge of the Way. Have clear and thorough understanding in one's own heart, and truly trust it. With one principle fully connected, one sees that all things under Heaven and on Earth are thus. To the left or to the right, before or behind, the Way's qi fills all. This is true knowledge and true insight; great awakening and great thoroughness; not to be deceived by clinging to form or getting stuck on emptiness. Otherwise, without careful study, with carelessness and indifference, knowing thus but not truly seeing thus, one remains in doubt and confusion, vainly imagining to ascend straight to the shore of the Way. It is difficult indeed.
