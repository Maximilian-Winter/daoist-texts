# The Gate of Wasted Life

The Most Sage said: The younger generation is to be feared; how can one know that those who come after are not better than the present? But if at forty or fifty years one has heard nothing (of the truth), then there is nothing more to be feared. The Perfected One of Ziyang said: Alas! The human body is hard to obtain, and the passage of time is swift; the length of life cannot be measured—how can one escape the retribution of sin? If one does not awaken early to self-awareness, but only sweetly resigns oneself to awaiting the end, then if at the crossroads a single thought errs, one will fall into the three paths of evil destinies; then through dust and kalpas one will move without hope of release. The Perfected One of Sanfeng said: Bow before a wise master, inquire of the method, and act quickly in practice; yet even this is too slow. These words all tell the learner that one must, while young, diligently apply oneself and not squander the years.

The sun and moon pass easily, time flies like an arrow; a hundred years of life pass in a fleeting moment. All things in the world are but false; only nature and life are real. He who esteems life must, while youthful and strong of vigour, firmly make a resolution and advance courageously; with a thought pure and sincere, seek a master and visit friends. With a sincere heart, study and learn, and seek out a saving remedy, that the cause and condition of transcendence may be resolved. Do not wait until the vital breath fails and the spirit grows dim, the sinews and bones grow weary and feeble, unable to return to the origin, unable to regain the root; to wait for the time of great transformation — is this not to come to the world in vain?

For in youth and strength, when rushing east and west, enduring hunger, cold, and hardship, the spirit is vigorous and the breath is abundant, it is easier to exert strength; the future is long and can be fashioned. One must by no means waste time, dawdling day by day, thus erring against life. Therefore the ancients cherished every moment as precious, acting with diligence from morn to eve, not allowing an instant to be lost. The foolish learners of the world do not know how to establish resolve and cultivate practice; they are greedy for worldly affairs, cannot see through fame and profit, and cannot let go of their salaries and emoluments. They recognize the false and abandon the true, planning by day and night, drunk with life and dead in dreams, thereby bringing upon themselves vexation and suffering. They possess all emotions of joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure; and all desires of greed, hatred, ignorance, and love. They apply their minds to what is useless, and pay no heed to what is beneficial. They neither investigate the principles in the sage’s classic books, nor listen to the instruction of wise masters and good friends, but only seek abundant clothes and ample food. They gather in crowds, speak idly, their minds give rise to miscellaneous thoughts, their bodies engage in trivial affairs, thus vainly losing time.

When in future the King of the Netherworld and the Old Master demand their payment, how will they sustain it? They never think that time does not wait for me; once passed, it will not return. They do not regard the great matter of life and nature as important, but instead pursue the external, harming body and life. Thus the years of usefulness are placed in the realm of the useless—how lamentable this is! I exhort the true-hearted seekers of the Way to quickly break through the gate of wasted life. To place nature and life always in the heart. Every movement and deed, every word and phrase, must not be forgotten. When encountering a master, receive instruction; when meeting friends, join in study. Even if the great Way is not clear, do not waste the years, that in the end you may become a good person and avoid creating sin. If one can concentrate wholeheartedly, endure great suffering, and accomplish great work, the spirit will silently protect, the true master will appreciate, and the great Way may be hoped for. Otherwise, if one does not cherish life and nature, and lacks vigour of spirit, the years will pass in vain; to dream of the immortal path is difficult indeed.
