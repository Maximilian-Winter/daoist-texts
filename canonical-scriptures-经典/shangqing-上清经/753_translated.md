# The Gate of Boasting and Vaunting

The Old Ancestor said, "Much speech leads to exhaustion; it is better to keep to the mean." The Most Holy said, "The superior man desires to be slow of speech and quick of action." The Jade Pivot Scripture says, "Enter with sincerity." The ancient immortals said, "The wise do not speak; those who speak are not wise." These all teach men to be sincere and diligent in their efforts, and not to be ostentatious or to raise a false clamour.

Now the Way of cultivating the true is of utmost refinement and minuteness, most detailed and profound; it requires careful inquiry and cautious reflection, the deepest research into the subtle beginnings, with power of effort lasting through days and years, and only then is the truth seen. It requires firm and steadfast purpose, keeping the feet on the solid ground, the longer and the more diligently one perseveres, the truer it becomes. It is not a matter that may be dealt with by seeming so but not so, by scratching an itch through the shoe, or by a careless dismissal; it is not to be lightly treated with self-satisfaction, nor by building a vain and empty bridge.

If the clear Way is in any degree vague, if the practice of the Way is in any degree superficial and unsubstantial, not only can one not proceed, but one cannot even know (the truth). Therefore, those who study the Way must aim to attain true knowledge and sure vision, and true practice and accomplishment must be esteemed.

The confused learners of the world, learning but a few trifling exercises, proudly claiming to possess the Way, count their yellow and white talismans, and in the presence of men they confuse and disorder their speech; after a few daysâ€™ dabbling, having seen some slight effect, they fancy themselves to have attained the Way, and affect a guise, holding no man in their sight. All these are but vain displays of spirit, taking ignorance for knowledge, falsehood for truth, boasting of their ability, and vainly vending their reputation. They know not that the study of nature and life is originally for oneself, not for others; it is to look inward, not outward.

Before the Way is heard, one is eager to seek knowledge, requiring the utmost care in discrimination to exhaust principle. After the Way is heard, one is eager to seek practice, requiring secret cultivation and careful refinement to apply effort, throughout a single purpose, with sincere heart in the doing, without a second thought. What is called unbroken purpose is a concentration of the spirit; what leisure then remains for boasting and clamouring before men, for vending fame and fishing for praise?

I exhort those who truly and sincerely study the Way to quickly clear open the gate of boasting and vaunting. Be stupid and slow, cautious in speech and careful in action; do not hold to your own superiority, do not pursue empty fame; regard your nature and life as of greatest importance, and go forward with true heart and sincere intent. Those who have not yet heard the Way should bow their heads and study it; those who have heard the Way should bow their heads and cultivate it.

When the work and achievement are complete, with perfect sincerity and prior knowledge, and with spirit and power vast, then without boasting men will all praise, without vaunting men will all extol. Only after a hundred generations will the speakers commend, the hearers admire, and the teaching be transmitted without end or decay. What need is there to boast and vaunt, to seek a vain name?

If otherwise, to make that which is not as that which is, to make that which is empty as that which is full, this is self-sufficiency, deceiving oneself and others, falsely imagining attainment of the Way; it is difficult indeed.
