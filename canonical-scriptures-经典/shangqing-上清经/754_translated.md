# The Pass of Illusory Scenes

Wuzhen said: Without moving a step, one arrives at the Western Heaven; sitting upright, all directions lie before the eyes. Behind the nape there is a light, yet it is but illusion; clouds arise beneath the feet, but this is not to be called the immortal. Again he said: A maiden clad in blue robes, and her lord arrayed in white linen; to see them is impossible to make use of, to make use of them is impossible to see. Sanfeng said: Emptiness is form; form is emptiness; discerning clearly the true void is within form. The perfect void is without colour or form; the law-marks endure and do not fall into emptiness. These all speak of the Great Way as without shape or image, not abiding in illusory scenes. The way of nature and life is the way of true constancy. The way of true constancy is not strange or marvellous; it has no form or colour; it is without contrivance; without effort; natural in itself; plain and common. Hence the Old Lord calls it Nature; Confucius calls it the Mean; Shakyamuni calls it Non-abidance. Only men are in the Way but know it not. It is only because after birth, the qi and temperament and nature develop according to the later Heaven’s creation, following the moulding of yin and yang, that within, false thoughts arise in confusion; without, the six gates entice; assaulted within and without—what was originally natural becomes unnatural; the mean becomes un-mean; non-abidance becomes abiding; the true becomes latent and the false becomes manifest; losing its original visage. Therefore the Patriarchs devised arts to prolong life, entering from the realm of doing into that of non-doing, from gradual cultivation to sudden enlightenment, returning again to Nature, the Mean, Non-abidance; true constancy enduring and imperishable. Never beyond Nature, the Mean, Non-abidance, and True Constancy is there addition or subtraction. Though it be said that one seizes creation, reverses birth and death, opposes yin and yang, twists the qi mechanism, forms the Golden Elixir, coagulates the holy embryo, and that beyond the self there is a body—these are but the perfection of a single true constant reality; how could one borrow all manner of forms and substances of divers kinds? Since it is said to be true constancy, what image or scene could it have? If there were any image or scene, it would not be true constancy, nor natural, nor mean, nor non-abiding. The ignorant learners of the world, hearing talk of the Golden Elixir, suspect there must be an image of elixir; hearing of moonlight, suspect there must be an image of light; hearing of the waning moon, suspect there must be an image of the moon; hearing of rosy glow, suspect there must be an image of glow; hearing of red radiance, suspect there must be an image of redness; hearing of embryo-formation, suspect there must be an image of embryo; hearing of the one aperture of the original gate, suspect there must be an image of gate; hearing of the original yin gate, suspect there must be an image of gate. Moreover, there are those of side doors and heterodox ways who, practising the skill of inner observation, see the five viscera and claim to have seen the true image. Or sitting in fixed meditation, hearing celestial music and seeing radiance, they claim to have created scenes. Or walking, standing, and thinking, their spirit roams the immortal realms and grotto heavens; seeing dragons, phoenixes, towers, and terraces, they claim to have true scenes. Or fixing their eyes on one place, long after the spirit’s light diffuses outward, suddenly bright then dim, they claim to have attained a scene. Or silently facing the Supreme Emperor, long after the spirit ceases to guard its chamber, clouds come and mists go, and they feel themselves in mid-air, claiming the Way has formed a scene. Or conducting the qi in reverse ascent, feeling the wheel turning above and below, the joints piercing through, they claim to have opened gates to scenes. Or ingesting qi and dining on rosy clouds, feeling thundering in the abdomen, something in the cinnabar field, they claim to have formed elixir scenes. Suchlike, all are mistaking illusion for truth. Lightly, they suffer sickness; gravely, they harm their nature and life. Little do they know that the way of true constancy is neither form nor emptiness; without shape or image; how could there be strange and marvellous scenes? As for the Great Way perfected, a body beyond the body, form and spirit both subtle, in union with the Way and true; formless gives rise to true form, image gives rise to real image; gathering forms the body, dispersing transforms into qi; what remains is no-thing, no-thing is indeed something; neither being nor non-being stand; the same in essence as the void—what image could it have? Not only those of side doors and heterodox ways, but even those who cultivate the orthodox Way, with deep功功 and long days, when spirit and mind cause disaster, also present strange and marvellous illusions to overthrow our Way. Sometimes they report good or ill fortune; sometimes transform into ghosts and monsters; sometimes into beautiful women, immortals, or children; sometimes into tigers, leopards, wolves, snakes, and other strange forms. If one attends to them even slightly, lead flies and mercury runs, and great matters are ruined. Generally speaking, the orthodox Way has no illusions, and illusions are not the orthodox Way. To sum up, do not acknowledge illusions as wondrous. I advise the true-hearted who seek the Way to speedily break through the Pass of Illusory Scenes, to sweep away all attachments to forms, emptiness, quietude, and the like. Dwelling with mind on Nature and True Constancy, there will be a certain imageless image, a true principle empty yet not empty, whereby one can understand nature, and understand life. Otherwise, taking illusion for truth not only ruins great matters in the side doors, but also in the orthodox Way; and if one desires to attain the Way, it is difficult indeed.
