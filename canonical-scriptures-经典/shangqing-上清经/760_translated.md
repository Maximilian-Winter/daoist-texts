# The Inner Elixir Gate

The Venerable Ancestor said: Of all evils, licentiousness is the foremost. The Awakener of Truth says: In the chamber, the closed Tail Gate (Wei-lü) point, mistaken, causes the death of countless men in Jambudvīpa. The ancient scriptures say: If one were to speak of the Three Peaks’ methods of gathering and battling, they would cause the nine ancestors to sink into ruin. All these speak of the inner elixir of mastering the woman; it is not only of no benefit to life and vitality, but greatly injures the virtue of Yin. That which is called the Golden Elixir is Original Essence. This elixir, this essence, each man and woman possesses, every one perfect and entire; in the sage it is not increased, in the elixir it is not diminished. Originally, life and essence are one family; Yin and Yang are mingled; the Five Phases breathe as one. There is nothing to cultivate, nothing to prove. But because the innate Yang has reached its extreme, and the acquired Yin is generated thereafter, life and essence are separated into two places; Yin and Yang are divided; the Five Phases are disordered; the full is deficient, the perfect is wanting. Day after day, year after year, the deficient grows more deficient, the wanting more wanting, until the original essence is wholly lost, buried and not revealed. Therefore the Patriarchs established the Way of returning the Golden Elixir, that a man may again cultivate, return and restore it, so as to return to the complete, entire, without deficiency or lack, original essence before all is done. The Way of returning is to return to the one family of life and essence, to the mingled Yin and Yang, to the Five Phases breathing as one. The method of return is still to cultivate within the Yin and Yang of the Five Phases; hence there are the forms of male and female, self and other, infant and maiden, golden father and wooden mother, the young gentleman and the yellow matchmaker, and so on. A thousand devices of metaphor, ten thousand forms of expression, all to make clear the harmony and union of Yin and Yang, the gathering together of the Five Phases. Hence Lüzu said: To imitate the birth of man and woman is to surely open the heavenly mechanism, and thereby to work the mechanism to pour out the heavens. The Taoist method is not different from the worldly way of men and women producing offspring; the difference lies in borrowing the mortal father and mother to produce the coloured body, but borrowing the spiritual father and sacred mother to produce the spirit body. Between the sacred and the mortal there is one which conforms and one which opposes, with heaven and earth hanging apart. What Sanfeng calls conformity is mortal, opposition is immortal; only the one who reverses in the midst is the true one. Yet though the matter is the same as the worldly way of men and women producing offspring, it is not attached to the illusory forms of worldly men and women. The elixir books say that Yin and Yang are the spiritual father and sacred mother; they are the true Yin and true Yang within ourselves. True Yin and true Yang are not the formed, material Yin and Yang of the acquired body, but formless and immaterial Yin and Yang. The acquired Yin and Yang of the body cannot be used, still less the Yin and Yang of men and women outside the body. The confused learners of the world do not consider that life and essence are formless, without image, without direction or place; they mistakenly listen to blind teachers and evil words of licentiousness, and deal with the flesh and skin of worldly men and women as if these were the things. Some manipulate the Three Peaks’ methods of gathering and battling; some practise nine shallow and one deep; some count nine women as nine tripods and nine revolutions; some gather the chief scripture, applying before and after; some pluck the chief scripture’s plum as a substitute for ginseng fruit; some take fresh blood from the scripture to swallow true red lead; some attain spiritual communion without bodily union; some breathe mouth to mouth across the curtain; some reverse Yin and Yang by having the man below and the woman above; some draw the woman’s breath as the seed of earth; some take woman’s milk as a means of supplementation; some master a young girl as forging a sword; such-like there are countless. They bring shame in hundreds of ways, their filth is not cleansed, they are without shame or modesty, acting like beasts. When the Tao has come to this, can one still bear to speak?
Moreover, there are others yet more foolish and more foolish, the heads of iniquity piling crime upon crime; borrowing the name of the Patriarchs, they compose licentious and false books, passing them down to later ages, leading men to evil. Some explain the ancient scriptures by the Inner Elixir, confusing the sacred Way, as Peng Haogu and Zhi Jizi have done; deceiving themselves and others, and causing learners to fall into cages whence they can never escape all their lives: is this not to be dreaded and feared?
Alas! The Way of life and essence is the utmost purity, the utmost clearness, the most exalted, the most precious true Yin and true Yang, two breaths mutually affecting, condensing in the void into form, called the Sacred Embryo, or said to be the male child’s pregnancy. Though called pregnancy, it is not a blood and qi formed thing, but the essence and pure Yang breath condensed and formed. If one takes the turbid blood and turbid breath of a young girl and condenses it to form a fetus, it is not the Sacred Embryo of heavenly ascent, but a ghostly fetus of descent to hell. To seek to be human and fail, how can one hope for immortality?
I exhort the true-hearted scholar of the Way, quickly to open the gate of the Inner Elixir Chamber; to sweep clean all the doors of lust and desire; to seek another true Yin and true Yang, to meld them into one; and naturally a sprout of spirit will grow within. Then one may become immortal, one may become Buddha, and endure with heaven and earth for long ages. Otherwise, lust and desire do evil, harming men and injuring virtue; conscience is destroyed; and the vain thought of attaining the Way is difficult indeed.
