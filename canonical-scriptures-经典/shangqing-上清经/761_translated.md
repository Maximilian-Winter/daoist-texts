# The Crucible Gate

Xu the Perfected said: Diverse natures are unlike in kind; how can they willingly unite in one body?  
Chunyu the Perfected said: Those of like kind easily exert their power; if unlike in kind, skill is hard to attain.  
Ziyang the Perfected said: Cease refining the Three Yellows and the Four Spirits; if you seek among the myriad herbs, you find no true ones. Yin and Yang, when they find their kind, return and mutually influence; two and eight correspond, and thus naturally unite in intimacy. At the bottom of the pool the sun reddens, and strange Yin vanishes; on the mountain top the moon shines white, and the medicinal sprouts are renewed. The people of the time must recognize the true Lead and Mercury; they are not common sand nor quicksilver.  
He further said: Cease wasting effort on the muddy furnace and cauldron; to refine the medicine you must seek the Crescent Moon furnace. There is a natural true fire and proper time, needing no fuel of wood or charcoal, nor blowing and fanning.  
Sanfeng the Perfected said: The Five Metals and Eight Stones are all false; ten thousand herbs and a thousand prescriptions are altogether wrong. The Golden Toad and Jade Old Crow — those who know the truth recognize them as masters. These all speak of the Golden Elixir’s great Way, not the art of furnace-fire smelting.  
What is called the Golden Elixir is so named because gold signifies firmness and indestructibility, and cinnabar (dan) signifies completeness and perfection; firmness and perfection combined, hence the name Golden Elixir. It is the original, innate, true and single spiritual treasure. It is also called the innate true and single Qi, the ancestral Qi of all living things, the innate spiritual root, the primordial precious pearl. In brief, it is called the true and spirit-most refined Qi.  
This Qi, in Confucianism is called the Great Ultimate; in Buddhism, Perfect Enlightenment; in Taoism, the Golden Elixir. It is formless and without shape, neither colour nor void. Yet though formless, it produces form; though shapeless, it produces substantial images; neither colour, yet it produces wondrous hues; neither void, yet it is true emptiness. Rooted in the innate, concealed within the acquired, it is the root of nature and life, the seed of immortals and Buddhas, the foundation of sages and worthies. To know and cultivate it is to escape birth and death, transcend creation, surpass the mundane and enter the sage’s domain, neither born nor destroyed. Yet men do not recognize this fundamental seed, and so miss it face to face.  
If one desires to recognize it, one must not indulge in reckless conjecture or private opinion; one must seek a clear master, who orally transmits and impartially bestows the heart’s teaching, only then can the truth be seen. Moreover, the master must carefully point out the true and false of medicines, the right and wrong of fire and time, the order of operations, and the rules of effect, only then can progress be made.  
Since ancient times the scriptures of immortality have expounded subtlely and exquisitely, describing the profound and mysterious; their principles and methods are all complete. Like the myriad changes of a thousand transformations, expediently naming and taking images according to things, assembling virtues from diverse substances, comparing the visible with the invisible, illustrating the formless by the formed, dispersing and debating, each pointing to one principle and one method. Their meaning is secret and hidden, containing heavenly mysteries, difficult to express plainly. They teach men to gain the image and forget the words, to grasp the meaning and forget the image, to reach the limits and penetrate, to understand spontaneously and awaken by themselves. When exhausted they do not find, when penetrated they do not illuminate, hence they prove the Way. From broad to narrow, from doubt to enlightenment, not simply that the book is the Way.  
In truth, every word of the Patriarch is the immediate and subtle use of nature and life, the study of body and mind within and real; it is not casting away the near to seek the distant, nor borrowing the dregs of the world’s substance. The confused learners of the world, the Way is near but they seek it afar; the matter is easy but they seek it with difficulty. They do not penetrate the meaning, but take the image; do not exhaust the principle, but remember the words; guess riddles and cast lots, each putting forth his own view. Seeing the talk of great and small Golden Elixirs, they suspect them to be things of form and substance; seeing talk of golden cauldrons and jade furnaces, they suspect them to be utensils of clay and metal; seeing talk of lead, mercury and medicines, they suspect them to be common quicksilver and black tin; seeing talk of yellow sprouts and white snow, they suspect them to be spirit frost of smelting and refining; seeing talk of literary cooking and martial refining, they suspect them to be common fire of wood and charcoal fanning.  
Using the turbid things of metal, stone, grass and wood to temper and consume, they vainly imagine to connect with the formless nature and life. Little do they know that when the bamboo is broken, it must be mended with bamboo; when embracing the chicken, one must use the egg. The common things of the world are unlike my nature and life; how can they connect with nature and life?  
There are still those deluded men who borrow the Patriarch’s Golden Elixir as a mouthpiece to transmute the mortal frame; or borrow the single pellet of the Way’s Golden Elixir, that swallowing it they are at once transformed into dragons, or that eating a chicken they become phoenixes — these famous words — and so they cook and refine the metals, stones, sand, mercury, and the Three Yellows and Four Spirits medicines; madly imagining swallowing them will cause flight and transformation. They do not consider that the turbid flesh and turbid bones, the metallic medicines, how can they transmute, transform, and ascend? How great is their folly!  
Moreover, the metallic medicines are naturally poisonous; when fire-refined, medicine poison and fire poison are combined in one place, the poison is greater still; taking them causes intestines to rot and skin to decay; none have escaped losing their lives. Once the Minister Zhang of Jiujang trusted in taking the medicine; the Patriarch Lu’s transmutation did not enlighten him; he inscribed a poem at the door:  
‘Pity the Minister Zhang of Jiujang,  
Taking medicine he lost his spirit and vigor.  
Unaware that the returning elixir has no substance,  
Foolishly baiting metals and stones, how very foolish indeed.’  
He eventually lost his sight. It is clear that the metallic medicines cannot help matters, but rather cause harm; those afflicted by this in ancient and modern times are countless.  
Furthermore, there are those greedy and sinful men who borrow the Patriarch’s name to seek heavenly treasures, and say that to buy cauldrons and prepare medicines requires worldly wealth; without wealth it is impossible; so they seek external guards here and mighty riches there, deceiving fools, indulging in rich meats and fine wines, living in excess. Some use silver enhancement methods, some remove the blood of red copper, some burn lead and apply mercury, some burn grass and refine copper. All such things are false substances; how can they produce truth? Some even steal true substances, exchanging them for false, cheating men of their wealth and destroying their families; cruel and heartless as robbers and bandits, their evil and poison — who can speak of it?  
Once the Patriarch Zhengyang transmitted to Patriarch Lu the yellow-white method, to help men and aid things; but Patriarch Lu, because of the return to origin three thousand years later, feared harm to posterity and would not carry it out. What was his intention?  
The confused disciples of furnace fire do not know that accumulating virtue only to injure virtue, taking the Patriarch’s medicines but betraying his practice, greatly lose conscience. Though men may tolerate this, how can Heaven tolerate it? I advise the true-hearted seekers of the Way to quickly open the gate of the furnace fire. To sweep away all burning, refining, elixir medicines, decoctions, grass methods and other unwholesome things; to carefully probe body, mind, nature and life; to seek out a Heaven and Earth furnace and cauldron; to find a black rabbit medicine; to wield the Samadhi true fire; to temper into treasure — then there will be real help. Otherwise, taking metals and stones as delicacies, and poisons as life treasures, with no benefit but harm, madly imagining to attain the Way — this is difficult indeed.  

The above fifty items are all crucial gates of life to the learner, great devils on the Yin path; each gate must be opened for good progress. If one gate is not open, one is blocked by that gate; no matter how mighty a hero, how fierce a man who pulls mountains, he cannot advance an inch. The learner must recognize the truth and trust it; though not all gates open suddenly, by gradual effort the day of opening will come. If one does not recognize the truth and trust it, one remains within the gate, unable to go beyond; wishing to ascend the great road without this, like flying with clipped wings or soaring on clouds — is it not a misfortune for the journey?  
All learners treat these gates lightly, deeming them trivial, abandoning the near to seek the distant, giving up the easy to seek the difficult; their own root of illness not removed, madly imagining others’ family heritage; their own affairs incomplete, madly imagining others’ heavenly treasures. Who would entrust his family inheritance to a sick man? Who would entrust heavenly treasures to a villain? The Way of nature and life is the world’s foremost great matter, the world’s foremost great difficulty; not a man of great strength and great virtue can bear it or accomplish it.  
If one can open all the gates, then indeed one is a man of great strength and great virtue; if one meets a clear master, the great Way and great hope will be straight to the farther shore; freely traversing forward and backward without hindrance, every step showing merit — what cause for sorrow that the Way be hard to accomplish?
