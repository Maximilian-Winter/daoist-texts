Precious Decree of the Mysterious Lady of the Nine Heavens

With utmost sincerity I submit my reverent homage. The Primordial Heavenly Goddess (Old Lady), Immortal Matron of the Former Ages, adorned with solemn and wondrous form, ever manifesting in the Saha World, pure and spotless in her Dharma-body. Early she attained the Brahma Realm of Langhuan, the Celestial Domain of the Mysterious Capital of Heaven. She girds a jade belt of gold, encircled by lofty peaks and square caldrons, steaming sand and boiling stones, diffusing the divine light of the Boundless, universally illuminating all living beings. She wields the vital energy of the Profound Origin, transforming and completing myriad things. Her功 (merit) reaches through past and present, her virtue matches Heaven and Earth. Ranked among the Nine Heavens, she holds the pivot of Creation, spiritually communicating with the Three Realms, directing the summons and commands of thunder and lightning. Compassionate and vast, her transformations are without end. In her hand she holds a precious sword, cleaving the Demon Kings beneath the Dipper. Her feet tread on a golden lotus, paying homage to the Queen Mother in the Jade Palace. Great in compassion and great in vow, most manifest and efficacious — the Mysterious Lady of the Nine Heavens, Boundless Primordial Sovereign.

With devoted heart I submit my reverent homage. The Purple Palace of the Southern Palace, the Supreme Dao without peer, unfolding the Profound Ultimate.

The root of all immortals, all true ones, all holy ones. The divine machinery is unfathomable; she is the lord who holds the Dao, holds the Dharma, holds the teaching. Utmost spirit and utmost response, the mercy of the utmost sage. She saves the world and settles disorder, expounding the Dharma with ability, benevolence, and sanctity — the Holy Matron of the Nine Heavens, the Sacred Matron, Heavenly Venerable.

She rides a white crane amidst the clouds, holding a precious sword to slay demons and spirits, coming down among men to deliver and save the good people. What spirit does not submit? What ghost is not struck with fear? She descends personally to succour the myriad folk, great in compassion and great in vow, great in sanctity and great in mercy. In the Immortal Palaces and Spiritual Grottoes she manifests to save the mundane world. The Mysterious Pearl and the Wonderful Dao, Mysterious Lady, the Honoured Mother, promotes Confucian learning and saves the world, the Great Compassionate Venerable.
