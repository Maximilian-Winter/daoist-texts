# The Precious Edict of Patriarch Qiu

With utmost sincerity I bow and submit my life in reverence. The hidden and the manifest are unfathomable; embracing the Way is without limit. Within the belly is nourished the Yellow Sprout; from the cauldron flies the White Snow. The body is tranquil and concealed, hiding heaven and earth; the heart is silent and still, turning the circling of the universe. The subtle surpasses yin and yang, the profound transcends the boundless. Bestowing the supreme secret of the Golden Elixir, universally delivering later generations, unfolding the succession and transmission, the mysterious lineage enduring ten thousand ages. The Master of the Complete Reality teaches, a vast virtue and gracious teacher; of great compassion and great vow; of great beneficence and great kindness.

## Exposition on the Precious Edict of Patriarch Qiu

The Precious Edict of Patriarch Qiu is the treasured proclamation of Qiu Chuji of the Longmen branch of the Complete Reality Sect. On the surface, it praises the cultivation and experience of Patriarch Qiu; in reality, it is the inner alchemy of the elixir method. Therefore, the Precious Edict of Patriarch Qiu is interpreted according to the alchemical scriptures. Patriarch Qiu, styled Tongmi, with the Taoist name Everlasting Spring, was a native of Qixia in Dengzhou, and was the fifth Chief Master of the Complete Reality Sect.

### Hidden and manifest, unfathomable; embracing the Way, without end. Within the belly nourishes the Yellow Sprout; from the cauldron flies the White Snow.

The Sage at times indulges freely and contentedly, unbound by rules; hidden and manifest are unfathomable, as if mad or foolish. Those who have attained the Way and are perfected embrace the endless Way, their spirits and transformations various; sometimes they divide their form and scatter their image, sometimes they enter the void and emerge from non-being, sometimes they lightly rise and travel afar, hidden and manifest beyond measure. Sometimes they exchange their bones and ascend to immortality, roaming the Isles of the Blest; sometimes summoned by the Supreme Unity, they move to the Central Elixir, each according to the depth of their功行 (merit and practice).

The man who attains longevity refines the Golden Elixir. To refine the Golden Elixir, one first gathers the Yellow Sprout. Earth can produce sprout; hence it is called Yellow Sprout. The human spirit knows emptiness and stillness; the Taoist heart truly perceives and unfolds. The vital breath is born and returns, like grass and trees sprouting in the earth, their colour yellow and tender, their substance pure water; therefore named Yellow Sprout. The Yellow Sprout is the essence of the prenatal, the budding of the primordial breath within; like grass and trees sprouting yellow shoots, full of vitality.

The Yellow Sprout is the symbol of the budding of the primordial breath, the prenatal true lead, born of true intention. Emptiness produces White Snow; silence gives forth the Yellow Sprout. White Snow is the Mercury breath. Those who seek it must possess virtue. The dragon’s string breath is White Snow; the tiger’s string breath is Yellow Sprout. The root of the Great Medicine is founded upon this. Its Way is extremely simple; its affairs are not remote. Without great功德 (merit and deeds), none can meet a true master to impart these profound mysteries.

The Way originates from emptiness and produces the one breath; the one breath transforms into yin and yang, called dragon and tiger. The dragon is wood producing fire; the tiger is metal producing water. Wood, fire, metal, water combine to form the Four Images. The Four Images unite to form the Great Elixir, whose completion rests in earth. Earth has no fixed form; it is divided into the four seasons and four times. Without the true earth of the four seasons, the four periods cannot proceed; how then can the transformation and creation arise? Therefore, the Four Images and Five Elements all rely upon earth.

Yellow Sprout and White Snow are the signs of the initial union of heart and kidney, the symbol of the budding of the primordial one breath. "Within the belly nourishes the Yellow Sprout; from the cauldron flies the White Snow" describes the state of the ancestral breath’s sprouting. These four lines above depict the state during the cultivation of the inner elixir.

### The body is tranquil and concealed, hiding heaven and earth. The heart is silent and still, turning the circling of the universe.

Before grass and trees are born, they contain and nurture the primal simplicity; when their shells split, they receive the one breath to sprout; thus a single leaf is drawn forth to symbolize the one breath. Next, two leaves divide to symbolize yin and yang; then within the two leaves a further leaf is drawn out to correspond to the Three Powers. Beyond this, gradually they grow luxuriantly: in spring they bring forth green leaves; in summer they bear red blossoms—this is by the operation of yang breath. In autumn they wither and form fruit; in winter they die and return to the root—this is by the operation of yin breath. Yin and yang together produce creation unceasingly; if either be lacking, all things cannot be born. As it is said, “Solitary yin cannot generate by itself; lonely yang cannot accomplish itself.”

Therefore, heaven and earth mingle; myriad things are transformed and perfected. Male and female unite their essences; myriad things come forth and are born. This is the constant Way, the daily use thereof. Tranquillity is the “pure stillness” mentioned in the preceding Scripture of Clarity and Stillness. Silence is the “constant quietude” similarly mentioned. Concealment is the “hidden storing” spoken of in the preceding Scripture of the Heart’s Seal. Stillness is the “silent court” also mentioned therein.

### The subtle surpasses yin and yang; the profound transcends the boundless.

With desire, one sees the traces; without desire, one sees the subtleties. The sun and moon unite and form the elixir; heaven and earth unite and form the great elixir. Body and mind both tranquil, entering the profound darkness; as yang returns, the earth thunders and shakes; one enters the realm of vagueness and confusion; then one concentrates the spirit into the breath cavity, fire urges the metal to move, and metal becomes full and round like the moon. The medicine becomes firm and solid—this is the功 of maintaining possession. To gather what is not to be gathered, to take what is not to be taken.

Externally the body, yet cultivating the body; forgetting the form, yet the form remains—this is the功 of maintaining non-being. To cook and refine, to gather the medicine into the cauldron; to seal and solidify, the true gold and solid core accumulate into the elixir—this is the功 of maintaining possession. When the return elixir is obtained, acting without acting, all things are done; the original spirit soars beyond, shattering the void—this is the功 of maintaining non-being.

### Bestowing the supreme secret of the Golden Elixir, universally delivering later generations. Unfolding the succession and transmission, the mysterious lineage enduring ten thousand ages.

Patriarch Qiu Chuji was esteemed by the rulers of the Southern Song, Jin, and Mongol Empires as well as by the vast masses of the people. He was famed worldwide for journeying at the age of seventy-four to the Western Regions to persuade Genghis Khan to cease slaughter and cherish the people. After attaining the Way, Patriarch Qiu transmitted the secret formula of the elixir to later generations, universally delivering the people. Especially after Patriarch Qiu’s “one word to stop the killing,” the Longmen branch and even the Complete Reality Sect saw great development. The Longmen Dharma heirs spread throughout the country, being one of the largest Taoist sects, with the saying “Half the world belongs to Longmen” now current.

### The Master of the Complete Reality teaches, a vast virtue and gracious teacher. The Patriarch of Everlasting Spring, wondrous in the Way. The Perfected One opening the profound and grand Way. Broadly aiding and universally saving, the Heavenly Venerable.

In the fourth year of the Yuan Zheng era, Genghis Khan issued an edict renaming the Tianchang Temple to the Palace of Everlasting Spring (present-day White Cloud Temple in Beijing), and bestowed the “Golden Tiger Plaque,” entrusting all Taoist affairs to the immortals, and appointing the Master to oversee all monastics under heaven. During the reign of Emperor Shizu of Yuan, he was posthumously honoured as the Perfected Master of Everlasting Spring and Teaching of the Way.

The White Cloud Temple in Beijing is the site of Patriarch Qiu’s immortal remains on the Crane Terrace. The Taixu Palace of Qixia in Shandong is his birthplace. The Panxi Palace of Baoji in Shaanxi is where Patriarch Qiu underwent austerities and attained the Way. The Longmen Cave of Longxian, Baoji, Shaanxi is the founding ancestral seat of the Longmen branch he transmitted. Besides Longmen Cave, the White Cloud Temple, Taixu Palace, and Panxi Palace all principally venerate Patriarch Qiu and serve as ancestral seats of the Longmen branch.

Patriarch Qiu’s holy birthday falls on the nineteenth day of the first lunar month, known as the Yanjiu Festival.
