# The Precious Decree of Shennong

With a devoted heart I pay homage and submit my being.  
He who governs the ninefold agriculture, who opens the labours of a hundred grains.  
He strengthens the root and guards the fields.  
He preserves the peace of waters and soils, diligently assisting Heaven.  
He oversees the planting of seedlings, his merits partaking with the primal creation.  
His grace supports the lives of all under Heaven, his virtue praises the spiritual powers.  
The Lord of Agriculture extends his grace, saving and succouring myriad peoples.  
He sustains the root of the world, flourishing the sacred fields.  
Looking up to the seedlings and grain, clear and fair,  
The husbandry and harvesting are carefully planned for a good fruition.  
All depends upon the labours of the field, bestowing blessings and benefits,  
The whole work of creation climbs to abundance and plenty.  
Receiving the joy of agriculture, free from sickness and suffering,  
The ripened crops rescue the living multitudes.  
Great pity and great vows, great sages and great compassion.  
The ancestral lord of the hundred grains, the great god Shennong the Emperor,  
Who unveils the mysteries and unfolds the profound, the Heavenly Venerable.
