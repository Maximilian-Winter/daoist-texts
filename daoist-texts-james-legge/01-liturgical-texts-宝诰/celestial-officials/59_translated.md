# Precious Declaration of the Eastern Peak

With devoted heart and reverent command, I pay homage.  
Illustrious and mysterious is the august ancestor,  
The Golden Wheel continues the sea’s succession.  
The Mother of Immortals dreamt of the birth of sunlight,  
The sage of the Purple Mansion, younger brother of the Eastern Splendour.  
Formerly achieving merit at Changbai,  
First enfeoffed by the Fuxi Sovereign.  
At first styled the Perfected of Taihua,  
Marshal of Mount Tai in the Bright Han,  
In the Tang (dynasty) honoured as the Holy Emperor of Revered Grace,  
In the holy reign, inscribed as the Supreme Lord.  
His station guards the earth’s foundation,  
His功 (merit) matches the creation of Heaven.  
Benevolence is his virtue of kindness,  
Returning yang energy within the palm of the hand;  
His sage heart increases in holiness,  
Adorning sun and moon in the midst of Heaven.  
The Five Great Mountains extol him in the East,  
Alone he is revered throughout the Three Realms’ middle world.  
Looking upwards he carries out the Way of the Great Dao,  
Looking down he inspects the Yin underworld.  
He holds the power over good and evil among men,  
Grasping the sceptre of life and death beneath Heaven.  
Punishing the wicked, the courts are divided into thirty-six offices,  
Presiding over fortune and misfortune, the trials are judged in seventy-two departments.  
Those who do good are recorded and ascend to Heaven’s paradise,  
Those who sink into delusion hear his voice and seek deliverance.  
Manifesting the image of Compassionate Reverence,  
Opening the gate for all beings to be born and transformed.  
Blessings equal to Heaven, merit immeasurable.  
Great pity, great vow, great saint, great mercy.  
Supreme in the middle world, the Holy Emperor of the Eastern Peak,  
His merciful light saves the suffering,  
His august power is free and sovereign, the Revered Heaven.
