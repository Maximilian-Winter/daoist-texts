# Precious Edict of the Azure Mist

I with a devoted heart bow and submit my life in reverence. On the summit of Mount Tai, within the Eastern Peakâ€™s inner palace,  
In times long past she appeared in the form of the Jade Maiden, her root and origin being the very substance of the true Sovereign.  
Endowed with the Nine Qi, she extended mercy and showed her form; crowned with a hundred spirits, her wisdom was perfect and harmonious.  
Her workings fill the ten quarters; her merits embrace countless kalpas.  
Her rank is that of the Heavenly Immortal; her title proclaimed is the Azure Mist.  
She commands the divine warriors of the mountain prefectures, and governs the good and evil among men.  
She patrols the voices and responds to the call, protecting the realm and securing the people.  
Great Saint, great Compassion, utmost filial piety and utmost benevolence.  
Heavenly Immortal Jade Maiden, wide in spirit, merciful and kind.  
Respectful and compliant, broadly aiding, preserving the living and true.  
Protector of the realm and shelter of the people, the Virtuous Azure Mist Original Sovereign.
