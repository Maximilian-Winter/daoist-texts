# Precious Ordinance of the Old Mother of Mount Li

With devoted heart I bow and surrender.  
The Lord presiding over myriad spirits, the Master who instructs,  
expounds the teachings widely and squarely.  
In the mysterious cavern of Mount Li, the exalted path to immortal accomplishment is hidden in secret scriptures.  
Orally transmitted is the law of the stars, universally illuminating,  
the wondrous ladder of subtle spirits.  
The Way is lofty and the immortal register profound;  
this is counted among the ancient immortals of the upper Eight Caves.  
From mouth to mouth the opening of the orifices is rightly discussed,  
as in the Emperor Above’s Classic of the Yin Talisman.  
The Jade Palace grandly opens the gate of convenience,  
and the sage expounds the Three Pure Ones’ Six Registers of the Highest Clarity,  
the Primordial Star Formula of Former Heaven.  
The profound mysteries of the Nine Tripods and the elixir writings,  
handed down from mouth to mouth.  
The sage deliberates upon the Nine Immortals,  
cultivating the true and mysterious Way.  
The seventy-two transformations, the wondrous spiritual body of the law.  
Assisting the celestial path, driving away evil and binding demons,  
saving the suffering multitude, protecting the court and defending the realm,  
bringing peace to the nation and joy in their labours, with highest virtue universally shining forth.  
I surrender to the Lord presiding over myriad spirits, the vast virtue and gracious Master;  
of great compassion and great vow, the great sage and great mercy.  
The Celestial Master of the Spirit Treasure, where golden radiance flashes;  
greatly issuing the law’s commands, with the light of sun and moon.  
The Jade-Enfeoffed Protecting Country Worthy Sovereign,  
the Old Mother of Mount Li, the greatly compassionate Venerable One.
