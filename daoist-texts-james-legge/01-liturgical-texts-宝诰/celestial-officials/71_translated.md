# The Precious Admonition of the Chief Master

With heart devoted and mind bowed, I take refuge and pay reverent obeisance. The ancestral altar is established at the utmost pole; the transmission of the Way is in the mind. The Pure and Subtle Spirit Treasure and the Primordial Heaven, the Dao and Virtue of the Mixed and Original, together with the Upright Yi. The true wind moves and stirs; the flying body is urged on by thunder and lightning. The wise eye is ever bright; it looks about and upholds the sun and moon. Mouth to mouth is conveyed the supreme Way; grandly and loftily is raised the great ancestral spirit. Teaching the law to govern men, hence becoming the master of doctrine in the ten directions. Deputed by Heaven to proclaim transformation, widely opening the sectarian gates of the four seas. Universally relieving living beings, all relying on the straight Way. Great compassion and great vow; great saint and great mercy. The Mysterious Hall opens instruction, transmitting the Way from the great ancestral masters, unfolding myriad methods, the Heavenly Venerable.
