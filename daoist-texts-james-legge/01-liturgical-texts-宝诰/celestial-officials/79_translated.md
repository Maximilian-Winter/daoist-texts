# Precious Edict of Jiang Taigong

With sincere heart I bow, and lay my fate before you. In the time of Shang Geng descended, in the age of Zhou Kang he ascended to Heaven. The Six Secret Teachings reveal wondrous stratagems and display martial prowess; the Seven Lords of Change assist and produce worthy ministers. From generals to ministers, Guangcheng accomplished great undertakings through the ages; he punished the guilty and comforted the people, leaving fragrant fame and memorials of merit for ten thousand generations. The Grand Mentor of myriad benevolences, the Great Zhou established the esteemed office of the Secretary; the progenitor of a hundred schools, the marquis of Qi, illustrious and valiant, was King Wu Cheng. He directed affairs in the command tent, outwitting the Empress of the Winds; he harmonized the Yin and Yang, surpassing Peng Zu. Through a thousand ages there has been but one imperial teacher; through a hundred generations there have been no two true royal helpers. Of great vows and great sagehood, of great achievements and great virtue, he is the Heavenly Pivot of the Secretariat, the Grand Mentor and Chancellor of State, the Master of Stratagem and Tactics, venerated as Yuanxiao, the Difficult Heaven Honoured One.
