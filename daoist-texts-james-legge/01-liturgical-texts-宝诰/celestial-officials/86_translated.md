# Precious Edict of the Lord of the Lake of Blood

With reverent heart I bow and submit my life. Above in the Great Luo Heaven, I respectfully celebrate the Heavenly Palace. Formerly dwelling at the eastern mountain of the Crane’s Cry, I was at first born a wealthy and noble elder. With a countenance of mercy and compassion, benevolent and generous in goodness; cherishing the remembrance of my parents’ great kindness, hard to repay the creation and nurture of Heaven and Earth. I cherished the fond suckling, I soothed, embraced, and carried them. At dawn I raised my fists in readiness, my filial heart never slackening. I attained the Jade Capital’s Golden Gate, receiving the imperial decree and bestowed talismanic banners; I traversed everywhere the rocky passes and the Lake of Blood, seeking the voice to rescue my mother. I uprooted sin and suffering, and was born above in Heaven. Great filial piety, great benevolence, great mercy, great kindness. The Lord of the Lake of Blood, the True Man of Precious Appearance, the True Lord of extending merit and repaying virtue.
