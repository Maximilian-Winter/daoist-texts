# The Precious Proclamation of the Venerable Lord of Zhao

With devoted heart I surrender and pay homage.  
Secretly cultivating spirit and refining the self,  
Arrayed are the ranks of the Primordial Heaven,  
The True Lords of the Great Way,  
The Boundless of the Dharma Realm,  
The Essence of the Way of Non-action;  
Transmitting the wondrous instructions of the Venerable Lao,  
Recording the spiritual talismans of the Patriarch of the Way.  

In hand is held the Seven-Star Dragon-Slaying Sword,  
Beneath the feet treads the Southern Serpent on the Five-Coloured Clouds.  
Slaying demons and fiends within and beyond the Three Realms,  
Proclaiming and teaching transformation throughout the Four Seas, ancient and modern.  

Opening the altar of the Illuminating Teaching,  
The Profound Lineage ever to be relied upon,  
Summoning spirits and dispatching generals,  
With vows boundless in compass,  
Spiritual communication penetrating the Dipper.  

Constantly opening blessings and auspiciousness,  
Great compassion and great vows,  
Great sage and great mercy,  
The Primal Sovereign initiates the teaching,  
Master of myriad laws,  
Thunder and lightning responding to transformation,  
The True Man of Supreme Clarity,  
Delivering the Profound and expounding the Correct Heavenly Exalted.
