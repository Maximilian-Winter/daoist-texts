# Precious Edict of the Medicine King

With a devoted heart I bow in reverence. Within the Palace of the Great Ultimate, above in the Celestial Realm of Perfect Truth, there is one who excels in the wondrous art of restoring life, who opens the quintessence of the Great Way. In youth he was called the Divine Child; in manhood he wrought many marvels; renowned was he by the sects of wide accomplishment, and his wise rewards were not without cause. In the courts of Qi, Liang, Sui, and Tang, his years were unfathomed; on lofty peaks his writings left no trace; behind the elbow the heavenly secret entered the palace and opened the secret teachings. He embraced the three doctrines, established the method, was indeed the Medicine King of the Thousand-Weight True Medicine Mirror, and the leader appointed by the Mysterious Ancestor. Great compassion and great mercy, great saint and great vow; most wondrous, most divine, he descends dragons and subdues tigers. Protector of the state and saviour of the people, the Spirit-Responsive Great Perfected Sun.

Precious Edict of the Medicine King Sun the Perfected One — With devout heart I bow in reverence  
I respectfully invoke the Most High Medicine King, the Compassionate Heart who aids the world, the Perfected Sun.  
In the Nine Elders’ Cave he transmitted the true doctrine, under the Three Heavenly Gates he refined the elixir of immortality.  
Mounted upon a black tiger he wanders the world; treading upon a fiery chariot he journeys to Kunlun.  
Clothed in a red robe with a white jade belt, he always carries wondrous medicines at his side.  
A guest among the immortals of Penglai’s isles, the Medicine King revered in the mortal world of Yanfu.  
His jade image stands majestically before the Golden Gate, his attire and cap neatly arranged to pay homage to the High Perfected.  
At the Orange Well the elixir was perfected in full; he turned stone to gold to aid the good people.  
When illnesses arise among men they come to seek him; humbly we implore the Venerable One to save the people.  
He blocks before and cuts behind, taking away the burden; exchanging money for talismanic paper he halts men’s misdeeds.  
He transforms households and dwellings into Golden Gates; the populace is changed into heavenly immortals.  
Eighteen generations of illustrious physicians, twenty-eight Medicine Kings revered,  
He illumines the dragon’s eyes and the phoenix’s gaze, dispels evil spirits, seizes demons, and cuts down monsters.  
He heals dragons and tigers, manifesting virtue; hastens births and guards offspring, vowing unending aid.  
His disciples open the petition and await his coming; great bestowals of auspiciousness are ever granted for protection.
