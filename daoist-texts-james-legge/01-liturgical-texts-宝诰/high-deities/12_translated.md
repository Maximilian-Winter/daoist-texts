# The Precious Declaration of Kehan

With devoted heart I bow and surrender myself in reverence. On high, beyond the cinnabar heavens, attached to the Supreme Yuan Court; the vermilion officials and the crimson palace, where the spiritâ€™s radiance is nurtured in the house of the great kalpa; the precious trees rise in the forest, manifesting auspicious tokens in the realm of the Supreme Clarity. The movement of the great transformation is one of compassion; it sends down the mechanism of true essence and the talismanic keys. It cuts away death and brings forth life, expanding the one virtue of Heaven and Earth; it fashions souls and molds spirits, returning the hidden numinous to give life to myriad beings. It illuminates the Yang brightness, universally spreading through the Yin domain. Great compassion and great vow, great sage and great mercy, the Blue City of the Nine Heavens, the Venerable Elder Kehan, the Celestial Lord of the Vermilion Mound who ferries souls across.
