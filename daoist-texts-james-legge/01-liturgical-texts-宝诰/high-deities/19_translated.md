# Precious Proclamation of the Great Emperor of the Water Office of the Lower Origin

With reverent heart I submit myself and offer homage. In the Yang Valley, the Cavern of the Primordial, within the Palace of the Azure Spirit, are arranged the Forty-two Divisions, together with Nine Hundred Million Multitudes. They have charge over the affairs of the myriad spirits of the Rivers and Waters, Emperors of the Water. The great assembly for the Flood Calamity is at hand, the appointed time for the period of tribulation. The Ruler of the One Correct Law presides over the registers of the souls of the dead in the long night, the ghosts and spirits; the Master of Non-action records the merits, demerits, offences, and blessings of all living beings. Above, he relieves the calamities of Heaven, and redeems the spirits whose karma is fulfilled; below, he succours the dark gateways, and apportions the paths of men and ghosts. Life and death are alike at peace, and his power to succour is without limit. Of great compassion and great vow, most holy and most compassionate, he is the Water Officer who dissolves calamities by the Five Energies of the Lower Origin; the Golden Spirit, Cavernous Yin Great Emperor; the Lord of Yang Valley.
