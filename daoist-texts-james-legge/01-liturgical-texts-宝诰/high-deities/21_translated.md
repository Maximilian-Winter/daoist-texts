# Precious Invocation of the Marshal Tianpeng

With reverent heart I bow and surrender my life in worship. On the left of the Six Dragonsâ€™ Terrace, within the Gate of the Nine Tigers, there appears the awe-inspiring form of Three Heads and Six Arms, wielding the great power of the Seven Celestial Governors and the Eight Spirits. The imperial bell sounds its might, and the myriad holy ones assemble together; the axe and halberd lightly wave, and the host of demons is utterly shattered. His divine radiance shines resplendent, ever to protect living beings; his true nature lofty and august, vowing ever to prosper the path of righteousness. He cleaves through corpses a thousand li, and cuts down ghosts in five forms. Great pity and great vow, great saint and great compassion, he communicates with Heaven in prayer and blessing, extending good fortune and washing away calamities, preserving body and life. He is Marshal of the Eighty-one Armies of the Northern Pole Tianpeng, the True Lord who Guards the Nation and Disperses Demons, the perfected fruit of the Dharma, the Universal Cloud Enveloping Heavenly Venerable.
