# The Precious Edict of the Cavernous Abyss

With devoted heart I reverently submit myself. In the exalted realm of the Great Highest Azure Heaven, there dwells the Official of the Cavernous Abyss of the Six Heavens. Auspicious signs are solemn and majestic, manifesting radiant light in the region of the Blue Firmament; the true body is vast and ample, diffusing wondrous grace upon the heaven of all peoples. He restrains the demonic spirits of the Five Palaces, and dispels the pestilence and noxious vapours of the ten thousand quarters. He raises the lives of men towards benevolence and longevity, and gently governs the transformations in the region of mystery and obscurity. Great Compassion and Great Vow, Great Sage and Great Mercy, the Great Emperor of the Cavernous Abyss of the Six Heavens, the Subduer of Demons, Most High Sovereign of the Great First Heaven.
