# Sacred Ordinance of the Western Dipper

With devoted heart I bow and submit my life in reverence. Passing through the responses of the cinnabar origin, the clouds in accord shine purely. Bright auspicious hues divide the imperial seat’s tally; the assembly of the azure subtlety hangs the celestial street’s signs. Moving and abiding as a joined jade disk, (he) governs the power of the eastern well’s stone liquid. Retreating and guarding the balance of division, he presides over the commands of the southern land’s upper wall. Observing the seven cycles to pass the barriers, binding the four seasons to inherit transformation. Great compassion, great vow; great saint, great mercy. The Great Emperor of the cavernous shadow of Western India, the luminous star lord who gathers the celebratory true sovereign, especially the mysterious embodiment, the Dao Heavenly Honoured One.
