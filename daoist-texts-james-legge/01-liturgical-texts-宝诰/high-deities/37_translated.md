# Precious Instruction of the Northern Dipper

With devoted heart I bow and surrender myself in reverence.  
Illuming the Three Luminaries, turning over the Five Constants.  
A pivotal mechanism of creation and transformation, the sovereign master of human spirits.  
Proclaiming power throughout the Three Realms, ruling over myriad spirits.  
Determining the appointed time of good and evil among men, overseeing the eyes that discern right and wrong in the nether world.  
Able to absolve all crimes, to subdue the demons and spirits.  
Of great compassion and great vow, supremely sage and supremely kind,  
From the Central Heaven the Most Holy Northern Dipper Nine Sovereigns bestow blessings, the Star Lord of Fortune.
