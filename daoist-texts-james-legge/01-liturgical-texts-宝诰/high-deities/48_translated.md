# The Precious Decree of the Three Terraces

With devoted heart I bow and submit my vow. Within the Taiwei Enclosure, in the Heavenly Stair Palace, there is one who holds the vital breath of Void and Non-being, spontaneously acting as the master who harmonizes Yin and Yang. He appears in the form of three ranks, showing the image of two eyes. He adorns the imperial robe and solemnly proclaims the imperial edicts; he assists and supports the Dipper and Chief Star, presiding over the recording of life and death. He controls the balance of fortune and virtue, examining and testing the ascent and descent of the various immortals. He evenly regulates the six vital airs, securing the peace of the Three Powers. He generates and nourishes myriad things, protects all living beings in their embryonic state. Great is his compassion and great his vow; great is his saintship and great his mercy. He drives away demons and binds evil spirits, preserving life and guarding the body. The Upper Terrace is the Lord of Pure Essence and Virtue Star; the Middle Terrace is the Lord of Six Purities and the Minister of Space Star; the Lower Terrace is the Lord of Twisting Life and the Minister of Fortune Star. These are the Star Lords of the Three Terraces and the Glorious Canopy.
