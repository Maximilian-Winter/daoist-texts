# Precious Edict of Shangqing

With devoted heart I pay homage and take refuge. Residing in the realm of Shangqing, he is called the Lord of the Spirit Treasure. From the primordial kalpa he was transformed and born, with more than ninety-nine thousand and nine hundred Brahman breaths; the Red Scripture shines forth, containing six hundred and sixty-eight true characters. By reason of the chaotic red characters he opened the Nine Heavens; by recording the Jade Calendar of the epoch he divided the Five Kalpas. The Heavenly Classic and Earthly Meridian are the lofty ancestors of creation; the pivot of yin and the mechanism of yang, he is the eminent progenitor of thunder and lightning. Of great compassion and great vow, great saint and great mercy, the Jade Palace Dao Lord, Spirit Treasure Heavenly Venerable.
