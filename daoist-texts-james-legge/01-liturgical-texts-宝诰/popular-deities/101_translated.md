# The Great Divine Precious Declaration of the Supervisors of Life in the Nine Heavens

With devoted mind I bow and submit my life in reverence.  
The descendants of the Eastern Peak sit in judgement, the Supervisors of Life in the Nine Heavens.  
They bind the formation of the embryo, receiving the creative transformation of the Two Modes.  
They accompany birth and guard the delivery, these are the chief pillars of the Two Saints.  
They regulate with measure Yin and Yang, dispersing and controlling smallpox and measles.  
The Nine Heavens acclaim and celebrate; they look upon all alike with impartiality.  
Great is their compassion and great their vow; great are the saints and great their mercy.  
They universally aid and universally ferry across; these are the Bright and Plain True Lords, Supervisors of Life in the Nine Heavens.  
Many sons and many daughters, the Sacred Mothers of the Guard Chambers of the Nine Heavens, Original Lords.
