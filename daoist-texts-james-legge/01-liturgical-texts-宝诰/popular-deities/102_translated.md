# General Edict of Thunder and Lightning

With sincere heart I bow and submit my reverence.  
The Commander of the Thunder and Lightning, the Chief Officer,  
The talisman round and the register of laws, all the officials and lords:  
Suddenly the fire regulations, Marshal Deng,  
The fierce officer of silver teeth, Lord Xin of Heaven,  
The swift messenger Zhang, reporting in flight,  
The azure-toothed, iron-faced Lord Liu of Heaven,  
Generals Ma, Guo, Fang, Deng, and Tian,  
The Thunder Mansion’s Jiang, Bi, and Hua,  
The great powers of Pang, Liu, Gou, and Bi,  
Wen, Kang, Yue, Meng, illustrious in might and spirit,  
Spirit Officers Wang and Ma, the two marshals,  
The Earth Office Grand Duke Yin, the General,  
The Fire Rhinoceros Marshal Zhu of the Thunder Mansion,  
In the Dipper, the two Thunder Gods, Zhuan and Ba,  
The heavenly physicians who attack the qi and heal the sick,  
The multitude of spirits of the Fengdu Mansion and Court,  
City Gods and the Commanders of the Altars, the officers of merit,  
The Divine Tigers He and Qiao, the two Way Spirits,  
The ranks of guards standing dense on left and right,  
The banners flashing, shining upon Heaven and Earth,  
Swords, halberds, spears, and pikes ever in hand,  
Spears, knives, axes, and battle-axes all borne about the person.  
If there be below any evil cutting off the Great Way,  
They seize and bring to the Thunder Prison to carry it out.  
Sweeping away the fierce winds to greet the Emperor’s chariot,  
Upholding the Dao and its laws to rescue the good people.  
Now I make my petition, hoping for your arrival,  
That great thunderous awe may be bestowed to add support and protection.
