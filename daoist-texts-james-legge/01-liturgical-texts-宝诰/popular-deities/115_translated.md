# Precious Decree of the Marshal of the Central Altar

With devoted heart I bow in reverence and surrender. He who raised the sacred host of Zhou and destroyed the vanguard of Zhou’s overthrow; wrapped in golden light like a furnace of refined gold, he descended by command at Chentang of the Jade Void. In his left hand he holds a golden ring, in his right he wields a pointed spear; beneath his feet he treads the twin wheels of sun-fire and sun-wind. He drives away demons and exterminates monsters, cutting down the demon kings. Having personally endured one thousand seven hundred great calamities, he attained the perfect Way’s fruition; breaking through thirty-eight thousand evil formations, he eternally guards the Heavenly Palace. A single lotus blossom, transformed into a solemn and wondrous aspect. Throughout the ten directions of the worlds, he widely aids and rescues the suffering, a compassionate ferry across sorrows. His profound mysteries are unfathomable, his transformations are endless; he traverses earth and ascends to heaven in the twinkling of an eye. Facing the foe he fears not; majestic and dignified, of great loyalty and filial piety, of utmost courage and strength; he pacifies the people and protects the state—the Marshal of the Central Altar, Heavenly Venerable.
