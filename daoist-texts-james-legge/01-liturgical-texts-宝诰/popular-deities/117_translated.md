# Treasure Inscription of the Marshal of the High Origin

With devoted heart I bow and submit myself in reverence.  
The Purple Tenuity, the Imperial Zenith, the Primordial Spirit of Taiyi.  
Reciting and entrusting to the Azure Grove, I meet the Medicine Master who marks and transforms.  
Secretly transmitting the cinnabar cauldron, reviving men and beasts to health and peace.  
Favoured and attached to the grace of the court, encountering the peril to life.  
Receiving the protection of the Primal Chaos, presenting the commendation of the Jade Minister of the Court.  
Commanding the Golden Basin, the Yin and Yang hands to nurture, bestowing the treasured sword to divide male and female embryos.  
The cap and tassel fashioned by Heaven and Sun to create destiny,  
To protect and embrace the infant and pour forth grace.  
Great benevolence and great virtue, utmost heroism and utmost zeal.  
Sealed with jade from the Nine Heavens, bestowed upon the qilin supervisor of life, the Golden Basin bearer of children, the Marshal of the High Origin.
