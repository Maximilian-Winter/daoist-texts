# The Precious Declaration of the Five Ways Gods of Wealth

With heartfelt mind I pay homage and submit myself. The fragrant token shines upon the purple clouds, and merit and virtue descend upon the golden stele. Throughout life pure and upright, accumulating virtue most abundantly. All the days upright and straightforward, gathering benevolence deeply. When seeing profit, one thinks of righteousness; worthy to be lord over ten thousand generations. To covet not is the treasure, meet to enjoy a thousand autumns of fragrant renown. Great compassion and great vow, utmost fairness and resolved benevolence. Presiding over the worldâ€™s sources of wealth, immeasurably augmenting blessings and increasing emoluments. The Five Directions and Five Ways Gods of Wealth, the Great Perfect Lords.
