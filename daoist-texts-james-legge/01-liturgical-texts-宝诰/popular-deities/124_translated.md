# The Precious Proclamation of Zhong Kui

With devoted heart I take refuge and make obeisance. He is the Jinshi of Zhongnan, the General who Guards the State. His voice is like a sudden thunderbolt, shooting through the evil mountains and valleys; his eyes are like mighty lightning, encompassing the imperial palace walls. Together with the reverent Duke Qin, he acts as the Captain of Demon-Subduing; alongside Shen Tu and Yu Lei, he stands as the God who devours ghosts. He commands three thousand ghostly soldiers; the goblins and spirits lose heart, their courage failing and terror striking them. He drives forth a million divine troops; the spectres and fiends grow cold at heart and lose their colour. His name is carved upon the Tiger List; he guards the dragon palace. He has been granted the imperial title of Top Scholar, and his office is that of Deputy Judge. His renown is august and resplendent; his awe-inspiring spirit is pure and clear. Later he was appointed Captain of the Nine Provinces Islands, inspecting each island in turn. He holds authority over the summer season, and is the guardian spirit of transformation. The Great General who expels evil and slays demons, he is the Iron-Faced Divine Lord of Zhongnan, the Heavenly Venerable who sweeps away malignant vapours.
