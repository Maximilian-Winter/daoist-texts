# The Precious Edict of the Door Gods

With a heart of reverence I make obeisance and submit my life. Their station is at the way of entering and going forth; their office is to guard the rights of the dwelling. With golden whips and silver rods, they drive away the unseemly spirits within the hall. With righteous courage and loyal hearts, they protect the old and young, men and women within the house. Looking up to the Supreme Deity, they defend the common people beneath. Their grace shelters the whole household; their virtue benefits the lanes and alleys. The Door Captains and Household Guards are the most efficacious of the spirits. They remove calamity and bring good fortune; they banish evil and destroy wickedness. They keep watch over the door and gate, and forever pacify the entrance to the dwelling. Such is the divine might of the General who guards the house.
