# Precious Declaration of the Thunder Perfected

With devoted heart I bow and surrender my life in reverence.  
The High and Lofty One of the Heavenly Mansions,  
the Mysterious Capital's Upholder of the Law, the Exalted One who unfolds the Teaching,  
the Jade Emperorâ€™s Attendant Censor, Inspector of the Nine Heavens.  
The Compassionate Father of the Revealed Teaching, the True Master who saves the world,  
the Overseer of the Three Realms, Commander of Myriad Spirits,  
the Prime Minister of the Jade Capital,  
the Perfect Lord of the Primordial and Wondrous Way who universally aids all,  
the Thunder Voice who unfolds the Teaching, the Celestial Venerable.
