# The Declaration of the Seven Perfected Ones of the Northern Seven

With reverent heart and bowed life I pay homage. The Way first gave birth to the One Vital Breath; in the world there appeared the Seven Perfected. They realized the words that do not reach the Five Elements, and obtained the secret of the Nine Transformations and Return. Sweet springs moisten all things, transforming decay and restoring spring. The immortal forms of the Golden Kingdom attained the Four Sayings and thus harmonized with the Way; in Weizhou transformations were wrought, after sitting ten years to accomplish perfection. On the walls the ink traces are not common; the forms of snow, bamboo, moon, and pine are wondrously different. The two wells bear record of abundant life; at one time they manifested the power of transformation. At Pan Creek six years, at Dragon Gate seven years. The功 of the Way was complete, and their fame reached the ruler of the time; the cinnabar talisman was bestowed, and they held sway over spirits and immortals. On the stone they discoursed on the mysterious; in the void floated the flying canopy. The Primordial Lord repeatedly proclaimed and inquired of the Way; sweet rain fell at appointed times to aid the people. Early they exhausted the words of the Easy Way; late they fashioned the secret of immortality. The diagrams of the trigrams thus unfolded, the supreme Way attained in full; the serene and tranquil hermit sought the profound and attained the Way. The immortal path of Penglai, held alone for myriad kalpas; compassion to relieve suffering, the Perfected Ancestor.  
The Seven Perfected Lords who embrace the One of Cinnabar Yang and Universal Transformation in Non-action; the Lord of Lasting Perfection who Concentrates Spirit and Conceals Virtue in Mysterious Stillness; the Lord of Long Life who Assists Transformation with Profound Bright Virtue; the Lord of Eternal Spring who Completes Virtue and Spirit, Manifesting Responding Teaching; the Lord of Jade Yang who Embodies Mystery, Broad Compassion, and Universal Salvation; the Primordial Lord of Vast Peace who Communicates the Profound and Most Sublime Truth; the Lord of Serene Origin and Pure Integrity who Follows Transformation in the Mysterious Void — these are the Seven Perfected Celestial Excellencies in their transformation.
