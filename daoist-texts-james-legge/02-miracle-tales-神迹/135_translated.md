# The Affairs of the Cook of Baiyun Cave in Taicang

Baiyun Cave in Taicang, Jiangsu, is a place of the orthodox Daoist school. One day, the Daoist priest Hou Mingde of the Longmen branch of the Quanzhen school journeyed hither. Loving the scenery of the watery region of Taicang, he requested to reside permanently in Baiyun Cave, to which the steward consented. But difficulties arose concerning the meals: how was this so? Because the orthodox Daoists usually eat meat, only observing fasting on the triple festivals and the fifth and twelfth lunar months; whereas the Quanzhen Daoists chiefly observe a vegetarian regimen. When the meal was served, all went to take their rice and eat, but only Daoist Hou took his bowl of plain white rice to eat apart. The steward, perceiving this, asked, "Does the fellow Daoist not eat meat?" Daoist Hou answered, "I have eaten vegetarian for three years; if I eat meat, my stomach is uneasy." Whereupon the steward instructed the kitchen to prepare for Daoist Hou one vegetarian dish daily, forbidding the use of animal fats, and disallowing scallions and garlic.

The kitchen cooks agreed, but perhaps being countryfolk ignorant of prohibitions, or careless in their dealings, after cooking the meat dishes they did not wash the pots, but proceeded directly to cook the vegetarian dish. Daoist Hou ate, finding the flavour displeasing, and said to the cook, "Be merciful, I pray you, when you prepare the vegetarian dish hereafter, might you wash the pot? I ask but a little, only a single vegetable." Thereupon the cook was vexed, saying, "I have washed the pot; how is it that you, a Daoist, speak thus? You are fastidious over your food; what harm is there in eating meat?" Then he went and reported to the steward, saying, "The newcomer, Daoist Hou, complains that I prepare only one vegetable for him, whereas others have many meat dishes."

Daoist Hou would not contend with this worldly man, and so departed from Taicang. After but a few days, the cookâ€™s mouth began to ulcerate, swelling and discharging pus, causing unbearable pain. It was then midsummer, and flies incessantly flew about his mouth, which he could not drive away. He sought many doctors, but none could cure him. The other Daoists spoke among themselves, saying it was the punishment due to his former slander of the religious men. At length, they sought a Daoist of the orthodox school in the temple to recite several scrolls of the "Sanguan Jing" (Scripture of the Three Officials), and then he was restored.

The Iron-Crowned Daoist said: "In all spiritual altars and temples are guardian spirits, who protect the Daoist place and quietly assist those who cultivate the orthodox Way. Some who labour long in the temple lack reverence for the Daoist priests. They know not that to serve in the temple is a good opportunity to accumulate merit and virtue. Yet their hearts harbor cruelty, and they seek to harm the cultivators. Such persons receive severe retribution in the netherworld."

In praise it is said: "The Daoist observes fasting with great strictness, while the worldly ignorant utter slanders. Good and evil are hidden, yet surely there is retribution; why not repent and pay respects at the triple festivals?"
