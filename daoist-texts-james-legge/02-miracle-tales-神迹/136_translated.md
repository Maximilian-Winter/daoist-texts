# Cao Yongchun’s Seeking Immortals in the Five Elders’ Cave

Cao Yongchun was a Daoist priest of the Jianfu Palace on Mount Qingcheng. His conduct was eccentric and wayward, and his fellow Daoists all regarded him as a madman. In the year 1998, he suddenly said to the Daoist companions of Jianfu Palace, “Yesterday I dreamed of the Green Snake; he invited me to go and visit the Five Elders’ Cave.” For Mount Qingcheng was originally the place where Bai Suzhen and the Green Snake cultivated; the Green Snake and the White Snake had also cultivated in the Five Elders’ Cave on Mount Emei. Mount Emei was originally a Daoist grotto-heaven, and the tradition told that the Five Elders’ Cave was a passage leading to the realm of immortals; yet no one had ever been there. The Daoist companions all took Cao Yongchun’s words as the ravings of a madman, and did not regard them seriously. The monk Puming of Wenshu Monastery in Chengdu was on good terms with Cao the Daoist, and hearing that Cao was to go to the Five Elders’ Cave on Mount Emei, gladly asked to accompany him.

Daoist Cao Yongchun and Monk Puming came to the entrance of the Five Elders’ Cave on Mount Emei. At the cave’s mouth they set out fruits, lit three incense sticks, and burned some paper offerings. They prayed, saying, “Mountain God, Earth Deity, this poor Daoist has been invited hither, and humbly prays you to grant him a passage.” When their prayer was ended, they turned on a torch and entered the cave.

The entrance grew narrower, just wide enough for one to crawl through. After about five minutes, it suddenly opened into a broad space; within the cave it was cold and damp; from time to time bats flew out; beneath their feet venomous snakes lay coiled. Monk Puming said, “If we go further in, will we not lack air?” Daoist Cao replied, “No matter; since they have called me, surely there will be no harm.” So they went further in; but alas, the cave was full of branching paths, interspersed with deep pools and marshy places. About an hour later, Daoist Cao said, “See, there is light ahead; we must surely be near.” They walked towards the light, but found it shifted to another place. They went towards that light, and the light again moved to another spot. Thus thrice repeated, a faint warmth was felt; after going on a little further, the two found themselves outside the cave. They met two tourists, and Monk Puming hastened forward to ask, “Ah, Buddha! Pray tell us, where are we?” The tourists said, “Master, this is the Xianfeng Temple on Mount Emei!” Then the two perceived that they were no longer in the cave.

Cao Yongchun was much displeased, and said, “That Green Snake has indeed deceived this old Daoist! It vexes me to death!” At that moment a voice came from the Xianfeng Cliff saying, “The immortal’s prohibition lies in secrecy. I intended to invite you to the immortal’s realm to enjoy yourself; but who bade you bring the monk with you? Had it not been for the respect that this monk usually shows to the Daoist teachings, your disciples and followers would long since have bitten you to death within the Five Elders’ Cave. And you say I deceive you?” At this Cao the Daoist was filled with regret.

In praise it is said:  
Daoist Yongchun, mad and wild,  
On Mount Emei seeks the true Immortal.  
The secrets of the Immortals must not be revealed,  
Let the immortals of later ages take heed!
