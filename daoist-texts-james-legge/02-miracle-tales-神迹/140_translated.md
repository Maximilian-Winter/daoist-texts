# The Record of Kang Tongsheng of Shaanxi Upholding and Supporting the Teaching

Kang Tongsheng was a man of Shaanxi, who took a wife of the Wang family. Kang Tongsheng devoutly served the Way, and extensively practised offerings and support. When he saw temples being built or repaired, or when he journeyed about, he would always offer some money, sometimes five yuan, sometimes ten, sometimes a hundred. In this manner he continued for about ten years. At times his wife disputed with him concerning this matter; Kang Tongsheng then reasoned with Wang, saying, ‘The power and virtue of the immortals is beyond all thought; because we see not the spirits, must we therefore deny their existence?’

In the year 2003, Kang Tongsheng fell ill, and went to the hospital for examination; it was found that he had liver cancer. At that time his family was poor, and considering that his children still needed schooling, he did not go to a great hospital for treatment, but only obtained some Chinese medicine from the barefoot doctors in the village. Seeing that his disease grew more and more severe, with cirrhosis of the liver and oedema appearing, one day he said to Wang, ‘On the third day of the third month the You Sheng Palace will hold a celebration for the sacred birthday of the True Martial Great Emperor; you must go to the temple and burn an incense stick for me.’

On the third day of the third month, Wang prepared offerings and incense, and went to You Sheng Palace to burn incense and worship. She knelt before the deity and prayed, saying, ‘O Immortals, you have said that our old Kang has not spared offerings to the temple, and has done so many good deeds; why then has he received no good return? Why has he fallen ill with this disease? O Immortals, I pray you make your presence manifest!’ As she thought thus, she could not help but weep. Wang reflected, ‘It is indeed my fate; the Immortals can do no more,’ and so she returned home.

When she arrived at home, she heard a noise in the kitchen, and thought it strange, saying, ‘Could it be that the neighbours have come to cook for old Kang?’ Entering the door she saw Kang Tongsheng cooking at the hearth, and was greatly astonished. Old Kang said, ‘When you went to burn incense, I dreamed that an Immortal came to treat my illness, saying that my allotted time of life should have ended this year. The Three Officials Great Emperors examined my merits and demerits, and, recalling that formerly I had meritoriously upheld the teaching, reported this to Dongyue and the Northern and Southern Dipper. They granted me an additional ten years of life, and sent a heavenly physician to treat me; now my health is much better than before. At present I am preparing a vegetarian feast to give thanks for the grace of the Immortals.’

The Iron-Crowned Daoist said: The length of a man’s life and the time of his death are all fixed from the moment of his birth. But if a man can do many good deeds, then when the Immortals examine him, they add blessings and life to him; but if he does evil deeds, they diminish his blessings and life. We must know that the misfortunes and blessings, the length and brevity of life, all depend on Heaven. Though it be predestined, it may yet be altered. The Book of Poetry says: ‘Long may we match our destiny, and seek many blessings for ourselves.’ Misfortune and blessing have no door, it is man himself who summons them. Among many good deeds, the offering to the Three Treasures is the greatest merit. If one can sincerely serve the Way, and take refuge in the Three Treasures’ field of blessing, in life he may avoid calamity and untimely death, and after death may be born to the land of eternal joy of the immortals. Some men fancy themselves wise and say that ghosts and spirits are empty and unreal, that no response is to be had; this is all because their sincerity is insufficient, their faith unsteady, and they are inadequate to communicate with the spirits.
