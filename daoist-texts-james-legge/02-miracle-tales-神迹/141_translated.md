# Liu Jing of Quanzhou, Receiving Response from the Dark Heavenly Highest Deity

Liu Jing was a native of Jinjiang in Quanzhou. She had from ancient days reverence for Buddha and the Dao, delighting in kindness and beneficence. In her household she maintained an altar to the Dark Heavenly Highest Deity, daily offering incense and flowers, never daring to be remiss.

In the year 2008, at the Peach Spring Cave of Wuyi Mountain, while burning incense, she took occasion to inquire about her recent fortune. The Daoist priest of the mountain told her, "Your eight characters possess both wealth and official rank; your nature is benevolent and sincere. Yet you were born in the month of Yi-Wei, and in the coming year Ji-Chou, Heaven conflicts with Earth. Moreover, your Day Master is Geng Metal; encountering Chou is as entering the tomb. According to reason, in the year 2009, you should experience a great calamity."

Having heard these words, Liu Jing's heart was troubled and anxious. In the summer of 2009, while driving towards Xiamen, she met with a carriage accident and fell beneath the Haicang Bridge, nearly drowned. At that time, fortunately, there was a tortoise by her side, which bore her upon its back to the shore.

In the year 2010, returning again to Wuyi Mountain to burn incense, she met that same Daoist priest. When speaking of this matter, the priest said, "The tortoise is a messenger of the Dark Heavenly Highest Deity. Is it not so that you have an altar to the Dark Heavenly Highest Deity in your home?" Liu Jing then understood that because of her sincere worship of the Deity, she had received secret protection from the divine, who preserved her through a great calamity. From that time forth she became even more devout towards the True Warrior Ancestor.
