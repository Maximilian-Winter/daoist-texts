# The Case of He Guobao of Nanping Being Harassed by a Wronged Spirit

He Guobao, a man of Fujian, suffered from pain in the perineum, and sought many remedies but to no avail, expending considerable sums. He heard that in Dou Tian Palace at Xinyu, Jiangxi, there resided a Daoist named Master Li, who was very skilled in acupuncture. He therefore drove swiftly to Xinyu to seek treatment.

After the customary greetings between host and guest, Master Li inquired: "When did this illness of yours begin?" He Guobao replied, "In the year 2009, shortly after moving into a new house." Master Li thought within himself: Could this be a matter of geomancy? Or perhaps the work of a ghost or demon? He then took forth his silver needles, and, following the sequence of the thirteen needles of the Ghost Gate, inserted them one after another. When he reached the Qu Chi point, there came a woman's voice, sternly saying: "This is no concern of yours; meddle not in it!" Thereupon Master Li ceased his treatment.

After dismissing all present, he asked He Guobao: "Have you ever wronged a woman? Or done anything to offend a woman?" He Guobao answered: "In 2010, when I graduated and returned to Xiamen, my university girlfriend wished to accompany me. But while in Xiamen, a woman took a liking to me, and I broke with my original girlfriend. Later I heard that she, not long after, fell into depression and drowned herself in the sea. Could this matter be connected with her?" Master Li said: "I now understand. The woman whom you betrayed has become a wronged spirit, and she clings to you. Your illness is caused by this ghostly disturbance, which no medicine can cure." He Guobao, filled with both regret and fear, asked: "What then should I do? Pray instruct me, Master!" Master Li replied: "These are errors which you yourself have committed. If you wish to be well, first you must sincerely repent and seek the forgiveness of the woman; secondly, it is necessary to perform the Yellow Register ritual at a Daoist altar, to send her spirit on for transcendence and rebirth."

He Guobao promptly consented, and so chose an auspicious day and invited a master of high merit to conduct a Yellow Register ritual lasting three days and three nights. The merit was complete and the ceremony perfect. He Guobao's illness healed without further treatment.
