# The Merchant of Kunming, Performing Fasting to Obtain Offspring, and the Verification Thereof

A merchant of Kunming, named Wu Tai, and his wife, being in early years busy with trade, for the sake of advancing their business, did not think of having children until more than forty years of age.  
We know that a woman of forty years is reckoned a hazardous mother; on the one hand it is not easy to conceive; on the other hand, childbirth is very perilous.  

In the summer of the year 2011, they came to the Zhenqing Temple to seek a divination, in order to ask: "Shall the delivery be smooth?" The lot they received was, "After a long drought comes the sweet rain." The Daoist priest interpreted thus: "The long drought signifies that Madam Wu's body is already like withered wood, advanced in years; and the sweet rain, it must be by the assistance of external power. According to the indication of the lot and the efficacy of the ritual prayers, the hope of bearing a child is still present."  

Mr. Wu was exceedingly joyful, looking forth with delight, and besought the Daoist priest of Zhenqing Temple to offer prayers on his behalf. Thereupon an altar was established for the petition of progeny, to entreat the Lady Bixia Yuann√º of Mount Tai to grant offspring, that the incense offerings may be continued. At noon on that day, the chief master of Zhenqing Temple, the Daoist priest Xia Chengde, ascended the altar, drew talismans, recited incantations, and personally prayed. He took a chopstick, bound it with five-coloured threads, then invoked divine power to bless it, wrapped it in red cloth, and delivered it to Mr. Wu, saying: "Place this chopstick beneath your pillow until conception; only then may it be taken away." Mr. Wu respectfully bowed his head and gave thanks.  

In the autumn of that year, Mr. Wu came again to Zhenqing Temple to fulfil his vow, saying: "Thanks to the protection of the Ancestor, my wife is now pregnant, and it is a boy. I also request the master to bestow a name." The Scripture of the Three Officials says: "Pray for blessings, and blessings come; ward off calamities, and calamities vanish." The power of the scripture and ritual is vast and mighty, inconceivable; how could it be falsehood!
