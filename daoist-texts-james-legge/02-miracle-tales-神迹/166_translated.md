# Jia the Good Man, Physician, and the Secret Protection of the Spirits

In the decade of the sixties, upon the plains of Northern Huai, there arose a divine physician surnamed Jia. His medical virtue was lofty, and his skill in healing was profound. In curing maladies he often employed the teaching of cause and effect to enlighten men, thereby restoring health to both body and mind. Hence the people called him Jia the Good Man.

When he encountered poor sufferers, he took not a single coin, but even aided them with money. Once, an old woman of over eighty years in the same village, named Huang, fell ill and lay upon the earth. Jia the Good Man, seeing how utterly destitute her family was, not only refused to take any fee for his treatment, but secretly placed sixty yuan in her shoe. After Jia had departed, Huang’s son, Huang Gang, discovered that twenty yuan, which his sister had placed beneath their mother’s pillow, was missing; he suspected that Jia the Good Man had stolen it. So he pursued him to his house and demanded whether he had taken the money. Jia confessed to having stolen twenty yuan from the old woman, and took from his drawer twenty yuan and handed it over. Huang Gang cursed Jia and kicked him thrice. Returning home, Huang Gang, upon seeing his sister, learnt that the money beneath their mother’s pillow had been taken by the sister. Perplexed, Huang Gang hastened back to Jia’s house, and knelt before him, asking with bewilderment, "If you did not steal from my family, why did you confess?" Jia said, "Your mother was in peril and must not be angered. Had we not found the money, her sudden distress might have endangered her life. For the old woman’s health, I was compelled to admit to the theft. I trust that sooner or later the truth will be revealed. If by my suffering shame I may secure your mother’s life and health, it is well worth it." Hearing these words, Huang Gang blushed deeply, and was filled with shame.

Once a girl came seeking Jia the Good Man to treat her mother. When they reached the ferry, the boat was full; Jia had just stepped on board when the boatman bade him disembark. Others entreated the boatman to ferry Jia across, but he steadfastly refused. The girl, seeing this, wept and knelt before the boatman, beseeching him to relent, that Jia might cross to heal her mother. Yet the boatman would not consent. Jia said, "Very well, let the others cross first; I will wait for the next boat." The boatman said, "Even if you wait till nightfall, I shall not ferry you across." When asked why, the boatman kept silence. Jia and the girl stood upon the shore, gazing at the river with a sigh.

When the boat reached the river’s centre, a whirlwind overturned it, and all aboard perished in the water. The boatman swam ashore and then told Jia, "Last night I had three dreams: at first, the Lord of the Land told me that tomorrow, when the doctor Jia came to cross, I must not ferry him; at midnight the River God told me the same; and at dawn the Benevolent Immortal repeated the warning. They said that if you crossed, it would bring me harm, so I dared not ferry you. Now I understand the reason. Truly, good is repaid with good, and evil with evil." Jia from his heart gave thanks to the many spirits for their gracious protection.
