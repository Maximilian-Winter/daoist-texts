# Hubei Xiao Guoping's Enlightenment on Events of a Former Life

Xiao Guoping, a man of Enshi, in his early years wandered to Mount Wudang, where at Prince's Slope he met the Wudang Daoist chief, Master Wang Guangde. Wang the Daoist, seeing Xiao Guoping, said, "Come with me a while, and I will present you with a sword. When hereafter your left hand moves disorderly, place it behind the door, and it shall keep you safe from harm." Xiao Guoping was filled with doubt, thinking him a deceiver, and said, "Daoist, I have no money upon me." Wang the Daoist replied, "I do not require your money."

Having taken the sword home, Xiao Guoping gave it no heed, thinking the Daoist strange and superstitious. As for the sword, he carelessly laid it aside in a corner of the house, where it remained for more than ten years. Until the year 1996, when Xiao Guoping began to dream often of evil visions; soon after, his left hand ceased to obey, trembling violently. He sought physicians and medicines far and wide, but all in vain. Xiao Guoping recalled the Daoist he had met on Mount Wudang, fetched forth the treasured sword, and placed it behind the door; from that time he found peace for a space.

One day, Xiao Guoping went to Changchun Temple in Wuhan to burn incense, where he met a wandering Daoist. In their discourse, he spoke of his troubles. This Daoist, skilled in the arts and profound in the Way, told Xiao Guoping, "In your former life you were a general; because of the many slaughters, rancorous spirits have clung to you, causing this strange affliction. On a fortunate day yet to come, come to the temple, and I will recite a scroll of the 'Scripture of the Three Officials'; perchance it will unravel these grievances."

When the propitious day arrived, the Daoist opened the altar and recited the scripture, while Xiao Guoping knelt behind him, trembling with awe and fear. The sound of the wooden fish echoed throughout the hall, and the Daoist's chanting rang to the heavens. In a trance, Xiao Guoping saw a throng of ghosts appear before his eyes, lamenting their wrongs. After a while, two youths, holding splendid banners, came forth and led these wronged spirits away.

The Scripture of the Three Officials says: "By repeatedly reciting this Scripture, and repenting of faults and misdeeds, even if they be eternal misdeeds, man and ghost are separated, and no difficulty arises. Mothers and children remain both alive; pestilences and punishments are removed; growth to maturity is attained; both parents are benefited. The power of the Scripture is vast and profound; prayers bring blessings; rituals dispel calamities. The sorrows of men melt as ice; enemies and debtors vanish by themselves. The lonely souls and the multitude, the nine mystery ancestors and seven progenitors, the four births and six paths, the cycles of transmigration of life and death, are freed from hell, and go forth to the Eastern Extreme of the Heavenly Realm, the Gate of Deliverance from Suffering."
