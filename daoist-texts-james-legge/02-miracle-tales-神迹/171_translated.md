# The Daoist Who Entered the Way After Fifty Years, Holding the Scripture of Deliverance

At Tiantai Temple there was a Daoist named Chen Taiqing, who did not enter the Way until he was more than fifty years of age. After entering the Way, he held and recited the Scripture of Deliverance without weariness, by day and by night; even when walking, resting, or sweeping the ground, he did not forget to hold in mind and recite the words of the Scripture. Before entering the Way, Chen Taiqing was of fierce temper, and the people nearby did not like him. When he became a Daoist, his teeth were nearly all fallen out, and his hair was almost quite white. But the wonder was, that after holding the Scripture for more than ten years, his white hair turned black, teeth grew again, and his steps became light and nimble; when he climbed the mountains, even the young men could not compare with him.
