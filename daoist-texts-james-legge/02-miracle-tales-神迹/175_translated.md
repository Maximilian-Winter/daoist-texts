# The Attainment of the Way by Daoist Master Zhao Liqing of Mount Hua

Zhao Liqing was a native of Datong in Shanxi. Born into a family of literary refinement, he early entertained the aspiration to transcend the world. At the age of twenty, his family compelled him to marry, but he fled to the Puji Monastery on Mount Wutai and became a monk, taking the Dharma name Juehai. Master Juehai diligently cultivated the Buddhist teaching. Besides reciting the Buddha's name and practicing meditation, he deeply studied the Buddhist scriptures. Yet he often felt a sense of incompletion; he was profoundly aware that the doctrines of transmigration and reincarnation were insubstantial and illusory, insufficient to satisfy and nourish his heart. Afterwards, a Daoist wandering hermit came to Mount Wutai; at their first meeting, Juehai felt as though they had long known each other. He inquired of the hermit the methods of cultivation in the Daoist teaching — the arts of Qimen Dunjia, piercing mountains and breaking stones, beheading evil and expelling demons, and the inner alchemy of longevity. The Daoist expounded each in turn, and further said: “My own practice is yet shallow. Mount Hua is the blessed land of the Western Peak, where many adepts and recluses dwell. If you have affinity, you may go and seek them out.”

The next day, Juehai went to the Yunshui Hall to find that Daoist master. The attendant said, “He went to take a look this morning and is no longer here.” Thereupon Juehai’s yearning for the Dao grew yet more intense; moreover, having witnessed the decadence and shameful conduct of the monks, he was disillusioned. In the third year of the Guangxu reign, he left Mount Wutai and journeyed to Mount Hua to pay homage to Li Yixing, an elderly recluse and practitioner at Yinquan Temple, becoming a disciple of the Mount Hua sect, and receiving the Daoist name Liqing.

After entering the Dao, Zhao Liqing came to know the profundity of the learning. Master Li instructed him in the Mount Hua sect’s Dragon-Stinging Sleep Skill: a short sleep of thirty days, a long sleep of one hundred days. During his lying down he mingled the waters and fires, harmonizing the Four Symbols. After one year, his complexion grew radiant and moist; his countenance appeared younger than when he had first come. Afterwards, owing to the ravages of war, Daoist Master Zhao lived alone, retiring to seclusion in the Lesser Upper Chamber on Mount Hua. Periodically, Yinquan Temple sent persons to deliver dry provisions. About half a year later, Daoist Master Zhao instructed the attendant boy who brought provisions: “Look at the things you bring me; I do not consume them, and yet you trouble yourself to make the journey. Henceforth bring no food; come to see me again in three months.” The boy obeyed.

After three months, the temple sent a party to the mountain in due time. They saw Daoist Master Zhao Liqing sitting upright in a stone cavern, motionless, his body covered with dust. The attendant boy was sorely frightened, and hastened down the mountain. Reporting the matter to the elder practitioners at Yinquan Temple, several Daoist masters resolved to ascend and inspect the situation. The elder recluse went forward and felt for his breath — none was found; the pulse had ceased; all signs of life were absent. But the flesh was soft, and the body gave forth a slight warmth. This elder said: “This one has already cultivated the infant stage, but his yang spirit is closed within the body and cannot find an outlet. It is necessary to use a stone chime to draw it forth.” So at the ear of Daoist Master Zhao Liqing, he gently struck the chime three times to summon the spirit. Before long, Daoist Master Zhao opened his mouth and began to speak, clasping his hands in gratitude for the aid of his Daoist friends. The accompanying Daoists urged him to descend the mountain, and to desist from cultivation, for by ceasing he might live several years more. Daoist Master Zhao said, “My infant stage is now accomplished, and I am gradually finding the way out; soon I shall ascend on high.” Resolute, he would not come down. The Daoist friends, unable to move him, shook their heads and departed, saying, “We shall come to see you again after a time.”

About thirty days later, it was already the eleventh month of the lunar year. Great snow fell upon the mountains, and the cold grew the more severe. One night, thunder rolled heavily, with lightning and thunderclaps resounding through the valleys, shattering the hearts and spirits of men. All thought the weather strange; some said it was the waning of the empire’s fortune that caused such portents. Some Daoist friends feared for the safety of Daoist Master Zhao in the Lesser Upper Chamber. The thunder roared for about half an hour and then ceased. The snow stopped; clouds dispersed and the mist cleared; the bright moon shone over a thousand li. From the Lesser Upper Chamber came the sounds of silk and bamboo instruments, floating away on the breeze.

The next day, all ascended the mountain to see Daoist Master Zhao, and found the cavern filled with celestial fragrance; but the master himself was nowhere to be found.
