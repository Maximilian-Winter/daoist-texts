# The Efficacy of the Women's Ritual Battle against Evil at Lidu Town, Nanchang

In Lidu Town there was a woman surnamed Sun, who for many years had been harassed by evil spirits and demons. Her body was cold as ice, and her belly would rumble with noises. At night when she went to sleep, there were always persons who came to knock at her door; yet when she opened the door, there was nothing to be seen. Thus was she vexed and troubled for many years, seeking physicians and medicines, but without effect. She said that when she was in her twenties and had just borne a child, during her confinement at home, she heard at night the cries of a child outside the door. She opened it to look, but the child was not there; a ray of light flew into her body. She saw a man in the courtyard who said, "That thing is now your burden to look after."

Though Sun was ordinarily like other people, the spirit and demon intrusion was entangling her greatly; her mind was not very clear. Many years passed, and now in her forties, her countenance was dark and her vital energy wasted away; her hair had turned white in patches. In 2010, a Daoist named Zhang Youqin came from Xishan to reside at the Wanshou Palace of Lidu, to officiate and revive the temple of the Ancestor Master. Sun, who had long admired the secret arts of Daoism, with their power to restore life and save from calamity, came to the Wanshou Palace of Lidu and prostrated herself, begging for help. The Daoist, moved by her suffering, examined her destiny and knew that this was the consequence of a grudge from a past life, now the retribution was complete and she could be delivered. Thus he consented to her request.

Thereupon he set up an altar for the Sacrificial Offering at the Wanshou Palace of Lidu, summoned the Divine Troops of the Court of the Forest, and the Generals of the Fighting Government. Each one flew as clouds and lightning, rode cranes and mounted dragons, wielded axes and halberds, and trod on auspicious clouds. The blades gleamed and the array was awe-inspiring. Sun sometimes prostrated herself on the ground, sweating without ceasing; sometimes she wailed aloud and looked up to heaven with a long sigh. Yet the voice was that of a man, not her usual tone. After the burning of an incense stickâ€™s time, Sun recovered her senses and looked joyful, saying, "Just now it seemed a certain General came, leading a host of troops, and took away that which clung to me. Now I feel much lighter; I thank the kindness of Daoist Zhang!"

The Scripture of the Northern Dipper says: "The Great Saint, the Seven Lords of the Northern Dipper, can dispel spirits and calamities." The Northern Dipper can relieve all calamities and save those who follow the Dao. The Northern Pole Institution for Expelling Evil is specially charged with the affairs of driving away demons and subduing devils. From this it may be seen that it is no empty talk.
