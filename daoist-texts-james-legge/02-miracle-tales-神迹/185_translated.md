# The Good-hearted Mason Meets an Immortal and Receives the Celestial Master's Talisman

In Chengdu there was a mason named Xie Zhen, whose skill was consummate and whose character was honest and sincere. Once he came to the summit of Mount Heming, to the Shangqing Palace, and beheld the stately edifices of the temple, but for the lapse of years the bricks and tiles were broken, and the plaster of the walls had fallen away, so that all around was a spectacle of decay and desolation. The Taoists of the temple told him that the Celestial Master Zhang had once cultivated the Way here, and that this Shangqing Palace was built by him in former days. Xie Zhen had heard many tales of the Celestial Master, and greatly admired him. Seeing the palace built by the Master thus fallen into ruin, he made a solemn vow to restore the place to its former glory.

Xie Zhen was but a mason, and his family was not rich. To gather the funds for repairing the Shangqing Palace, he laid out his savings of many years, and besides he went about soliciting alms. All the money he obtained was devoted to the repair of the temple. He also employed his peculiar skill in masonry to make the walls both firm and beautiful, and painted many murals extolling the Tao. Because Mount Heming was high and its roads remote, communication was difficult, and the transportation of materials was both hard and costly. To prevent the work from stopping, he was compelled to sell his property and to add hands, so that the work could continue.

One day, while he was painting upon the wall, suddenly a Taoist priest came in at the main gate, accompanied by two novices. The priest was tall and vigorous, his long beard hanging upon his breast, and he had the air of an immortal, breath of the Way about him. Approaching Xie Zhen, and watching him busy awhile, he said, ‘Your heart is sincere and your will firm, bent upon the repair of the temple; such devotion is indeed rare. Because of this you have exhausted your fortune, and no doubt your future life will be hard. Now let me teach you a method of earning your living. Mark it well, and remember it.’ Saying this, he drew upon the ground with a twig a strange figure, neither character nor not character; and above it there was a faint effulgence of spirit. The priest said to Xie Zhen, ‘This is a talisman for saving lives and curing diseases. When you have learned to draw this talisman, you may use it in healing men, charging a proper fee; so long as you are not greedy, the money you get from drawing talismans will suffice for your food and clothing.’ While Xie Zhen was still amazed, the priest had already turned and gone his way.

Xie Zhen recalled how the priest had drawn the talisman, and followed the pattern on the ground, copying it over and over again. After three days he had it firmly in his mind. When the repairs of the temple were complete, an epidemic happened to rage in his native place. He then tried drawing talismans for the patients, and found the effect to be very efficacious. Thus by degrees he gained a name in the locality; many came from far and near to seek talismans from him; though he took but little or no money, his family fortunes gradually recovered. All this was the gift of that immortal priest! Xie Zhen pondered continually, ‘Who indeed was this divine being?’

One day, a wealthy merchant from another place held a ritual offering in the locality, and upon the shrine was set up a portrait of an immortal. Xie Zhen approached and looked: ‘Is not this the immortal who taught me the art of the talisman?’ Then he asked the merchant who this immortal was. The merchant said, ‘This is the Celestial Master Zhang.’ Amazed, Xie Zhen at once bade a painter copy a large portrait of the Celestial Master, and hung it in the Shangqing Palace, for the worship of all devotees from the ten directions.
