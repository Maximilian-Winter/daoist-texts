# Zhang Zhengyuan's Practice of the Great Brahman Secret Words and its Verification

Zhang Zhengyuan was a man of Jingzhao. He visited Yin Sixuan, and under his instruction received the Great Brahman Secret Words. Morning and evening he recited them diligently, abstaining from flesh and fish.

When the bandits in Weinan raised arms and invaded the court, on the road Zhang Zhengyuan was driven and plundered by the robbers. At that time, the bandits were rampant in slaughter, their corpses lay all along the way; there was no place to flee, and he was exceedingly distressed and fearful.

While being driven along, suddenly there appeared many war horses, about as numerous as the bandits, which blocked the robbers' driving and plundering. Zhang Zhengyuan was sent out to beneath a great locust tree, and was told: "Sit here, and have no fear." Zhang Zhengyuan sat for a long time, yet there was no sign of further fighting; fearing that night was late and that he could not arrive (at his destination), he quietly rose and hastened on his way. He was already beneath the locust tree at his home. All his family were there, not one missing. Having dwelt for several days in peace and safety, he then journeyed with companions over the mountain, and settled in Jinzhou.

Later he came to Chengdu, and in the court he related this spiritual and strange matter to Master Mingdao. Diligently and reverently he upheld and practised the true scriptures, causing his whole household to chant the scriptures.

Note: The so-called Great Brahman Secret Words here are not the Sanskrit of India, but are the Brahman Qi of the Great Luo Heaven, the mysterious rhyme of the Nine Heavens.
