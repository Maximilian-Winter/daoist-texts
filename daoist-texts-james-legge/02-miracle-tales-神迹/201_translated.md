# The Story of a Servant’s Self-Destruction

Mr. Dong, a native of Tientsin, had opened a company in the capital, belonging to the class of high technologies. Mr. Dong, in quest of success in his affairs and of abundant wealth, was wont frequently to burn incense and worship the gods; he was also on close terms with me.

One night, Mr. Dong sent me a message by the Weixin, asking, "Daoist, art thou yet asleep? Is it convenient to call thee?" The tone was urgent, as if in great distress. I had but just finished a game of Nongyao, when I saw the message, whereupon I replied by phone.

Mr. Dong said, "Daoist, there is one in our company making a disturbance with intent to self-destroy."

I said, "What is the matter? Have you withheld another man’s wages?"

Mr. Dong: "I did not deliberately withhold them. At the year's end, owing to a balance due on a certain project of the company not having been received, the wages of the employees were delayed two months. Perhaps this man was naturally taciturn; added to that, with no money to celebrate the new year, and some harsh words from his family, he was somewhat discomposed. He took sleeping pills, cut his wrists, but fortunately was saved. Today I went to visit him, and found in his home a statue of the Buddha, set opposite his bed. It seemed he burned incense diligently. Before the new year, I had heard that he was cultivating some method or other; his eye-rims were all blackened. I then advised him, saying, ‘Thou art yet young, do not...’"

At this point, the call was lost.

After a few minutes, Mr. Dong called again, saying, "Excuse me, my phone has just reset itself to the factory state."

I said, "This matter is somewhat uncanny; the method he cultivates is indeed potent in evil. Leave him alone. Each man has his own fate and affinities. This year thou art in conflict with the Tai Sui; at the year's opening thou hast already met with this matter. In all things be careful and circumspect."
