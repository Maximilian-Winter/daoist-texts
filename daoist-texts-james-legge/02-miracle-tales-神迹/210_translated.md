# The Virtuous Resident of Shandong Who Delivered the Neglected Orphaned Spirits

Li Chengshun, a man of Qingdao in Shandong, in this year suddenly had a dream. In his dream were three or five children, their garments ragged and torn, following after Li Chengshun; and indistinctly there was also a monk.

Upon awakening from the dream, he gradually found that all things went against him, and his whole body was weak and without strength. Therefore he sought out a local Daoist priest to inquire into the cause. The priest asked: "Have you ever caused an abortion?" Li Chengshun answered: "I have always been single and have no such experience."

The priest then asked: "When did this condition arise for you?" Li Chengshun said: "Only this year."

"Have you lately changed your residence?"

Li Chengshun replied: "Yes."

Li Chengshun continued to say that he was now working at a construction site, which formerly had been a memorial hall for the War of Resistance. When the Japanese invaded China, a battle once occurred here; the Japanese devils killed many innocent people. Yet no rites of deliverance were ever performed, so the resentment was heavy, and solitary spirits wandered about. Sometimes, even in the heat of summer, a sudden chill wind would arise in the room, causing the hair of the body to stand on end. The elders said that there used to be a monk's temple here. The monk had taken the side of the Japanese, aiding the invaders; the villagers could not endure this, and so put the monk to death.

The priest said: "Dead souls that bear grievances, when some matters are left unresolved, refuse to descend into rebirth. Or at the time of death, spells may have been cast to bind the soul here. They become solitary wandering ghosts, unrecorded by the City God, unnoted by the Eastern Peak, and cannot enter into reincarnation. Alas! Alas!"

Li Chengshun bowed his head and said: "Today they have come to me because they know that I have a destiny with the Way. Therefore, come what may, I will assist them. I hope the priest, in his compassion, will raise the great Law as clouds, let fall the great Law as rain, universally bestow sweet dew, rescue the netherworld, guide the neglected orphaned spirits, that they may directly ascend to the joys of Heaven and Earth. Your disciple will empty his purse to assist."

Thus a day was chosen to open the altar, to perform the great rites of the Yellow Register, to universally aid the netherworld. The offerings were complete, and Heaven sent down sweet rain. On the next day the clouds dispersed and the rain ceased; he perceived that the air was clear and the breath of auspiciousness filled the hall.
