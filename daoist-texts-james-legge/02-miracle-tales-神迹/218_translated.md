# The Miraculous Response of Wen Shuhua of Jiaxing in Assisting the Printing of the Scripture of the Three Officials

Wen Shuhua was a native of Jiaxing in Zhejiang. She bore a son surnamed Liu. This young Master Liu was from childhood bright and clever; all at home loved him greatly, esteeming him as the treasure of the whole family. The house of Wen Shuhua kept a garment factory, busy all the year with business; in a few years’ time, there was amassed a wealth of hundreds of thousands of taels.

In one year, upon the Festival of the La-baba, Wen Shuhua took her beloved son to offer incense and worship at the Great Blessing Temple in Jiaxing. The Great Blessing Temple was a place with two monks and Taoist priests. A certain bhikkhuni, seeing this child, was very pleased, and took some of her bowl of La-baba porridge to give to the little boy. Wen Shuhua did not give it much thought, for it was a blessing bestowed by a recluse. But after returning home, the child began to suffer from loss of control in his bowels. Often he soiled himself. They took him to the hospital for examination; all indicators were normal.

They then went to Shanghai and sought the best physicians for a consultation, but no ailment was discovered. Diviners were consulted, geomancers likewise, but no effect was seen. Once, because of business affairs, Wen Shuhua took the child on a journey to Jiangxi. As soon as the child reached the borders of Jiangxi, his condition returned to normal. Wen Shuhua and her husband knew that something was amiss; they feared the work of ghosts and spirits. They then summoned a local shamaness, but she said it was a grudge from a past life, and she was powerless to help.

Because of this matter, the couple lost heart in managing their garment factory; business declined swiftly, and debts accumulated. Yet they continued seeking medical aid everywhere. Someone recommended a great master of the Esoteric Buddhist school, a Rinpoche in Shanghai, renowned for profound power and excellent practice. So the couple drove to seek his help. This living Buddha examined Wen Shuhua’s son, and said: “Your son has a profound root of wisdom. Yet because your ancestors once committed sins, enemies watch for opportunity to avenge.” Wen Shuhua said: “It seems our ancestors did not create such karma. Moreover, if it were revenge, why did it not begin after my child was five years old?” The living Buddha said: “Demons and spirits harm men when their fortunes decline. As to whether sins were committed, you shall know in time.” Wen Shuhua bowed and entreated the living Buddha for aid; the living Buddha ordered his attendant to give the child a nectar pill, and commanded that at home, before sleep, it should be taken with warm water.

Truly, this nectar pill had some effect. After taking it, the child knew to ask Wen Shuhua for toilet paper when needing to relieve himself. Wen Shuhua was greatly pleased, and daily chanted the mantras of the Esoteric school at home. But the good state did not last long; about three months later, Master Liu’s affliction recurred. Wen Shuhua returned once more to Shanghai; the living Buddha said: “I can only help you to this extent.” The Wen family was deeply vexed, at a loss, and Wen Shuhua’s eyes gradually grew worse.

Once, Wen Shuhua went to the Jiaxing People’s Hospital for treatment of her eye disease. On the way back, she saw ahead a Taoist priest, hair bound and knotted, wearing a star-crowned cap, dressed in a dark blue hemp Daoist robe; he held a staff, wore double-beam shoes, and carried a bundle slung across his body. Wen Shuhua called out: “Daoist Master! Daoist Master!” The Daoist stopped, and Wen Shuhua hastened forward to pay her respects. The Daoist’s countenance was clear and lean, and his eyes bright and lucid. He said: “Lady devotee, you call me?” Wen Shuhua answered: “Yes, Daoist Master!” And she recounted to the Daoist her years of medical seeking and suffering, saying: “Pray, Daoist Master, have compassion and grant aid.”

This Daoist, surnamed Li, was a disciple of the Qingwei sect. All his life, he delighted in wandering to noted mountains and blessed places, seeking immortals and inquiring after the Way. This time he was bound for Siming Mountain in Ningbo, passing through Jiaxing. Wen Shuhua invited Daoist Li to her residence. The household told Daoist Li: “Last night there were strange clanging noises from upstairs; we know not the cause.” Daoist Li said: “He knows I will come today.” He then instructed Wen Shuhua to prepare lamps, candles, fruits, and such, to arrange an altar in the hall, surrounding the house with red candles. He told Wen Shuhua: “While I perform the ritual, you must not make loud noises.” About the ninth hour of the night, Daoist Li began the rite. First he lit incense and summoned guardians to watch over the altar. Holding a golden fire bell in his right hand, and making a jade seal with his left, he chanted esoteric mantras. Suddenly a cold wind rose from the ground. Daoist Li, unhurried, shook the bell, guiding the cold wind into a prepared jar, which he quickly sealed with the talisman of the Celestial Master.

Daoist Li said to Wen Shuhua: “Your father once schemed and caused the death of another. That man, after death, went to the Three Officials to lodge a complaint, and having obtained their approval, now comes to revenge. The time limit is fulfilled; he should have reincarnated. Yet he still haunts you because his grudge is not resolved, and his resentment remains unlifted. Today I bring him back and shall properly guide his deliverance.” Hearing this, Wen Shuhua was filled with boundless gratitude. Daoist Li said: “Yet you must print five hundred copies of the Scripture of the Three Officials. This will both dedicate merit to him, helping to resolve the resentment in his heart early, and also accumulate merit for yourself.” Wen Shuhua prostrated, saying again and again: “So shall it be done.”

From that time onward, Master Liu’s health returned to normal. Wen Shuhua’s business gradually resumed its profit.
