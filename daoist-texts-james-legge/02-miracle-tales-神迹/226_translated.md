# Zhang Rong’s Disrespect to the Taoist Talismans and the Punishment that Befell Him

Zhang Rong, a Taoist priest of Suizhou, was wont to copy talismans and incantations, demanding exorbitant prices. When drawing talismans and writing charms, he would sometimes cast them upon his bed, or place them among cups and plates on the dining table, near meats and fish, mingling them in disorder; at times he even slept upon the talismans, showing not the least reverence.

Some fellow practitioners admonished Zhang Rong, but he replied with sophistry and arrogance. The more he took, the poorer his household became. His wife was solitary and sickly throughout the year. More than twenty years later, he fell ill, with a stubborn malady that was hard to cure. Each day at noon, he would leap down from his bed to the floor, springing several feet high; when he fell, he was breathless and fainted in agony, crying out loudly.

At midnight, the same happened; thus twice every day and night for over half a year. His bones were broken, his muscles pained; wounds formed that discharged pus and blood, emitting a foul stench. He could not eat; at times he forced himself to take a little food, only to suffer immediate colic, as if cut by knives.

A Taoist of Tiantai, named Hanzhen, heard the townsfolk discussing this matter, and so went to Zhang Rong’s house, saying to him: “The talismans of the Three Caverns and the treasures of Heaven’s script you have never guarded, but repeatedly and wantonly have violated them. This is the cause of the heavenly trial you suffer. You must cleanse your heart, repent and confess your offences. Even if you receive no favour in life, after death you may be spared from further punishment. Such extreme suffering—how can it be endured?” Zhang Rong, hearing Hanzhen’s words, wept like rain, deeply sorrowful; he loudly vowed, entreating the Guardian Deity of the Law and the true scriptures, and the divine soldiers and generals to pardon his former crimes; he promised to reform and thus preserved his life, no longer daring to treat the scriptures and talismans with disdain. Then he wailed and knocked upon the spirits, his voice heard from outside.

After a moment, his heart became tranquil. That night he dreamed that over three hundred golden-armoured divine kings stood sternly in the void; they sent a messenger saying: “Because you have defiled the Guardian Deity, have blasphemed and belittled the true Law, you have undergone a total of two years’ trial. Since you now understand your errors and offences, we will grant you temporary pardon. In the remainder of your more than eight years of life, you must not again traffic in talismans as before. Should you commit this offence anew, you shall be forever condemned to hell. Henceforth the trial ceases.” His illness gradually abated and within half a month was restored as before. He recorded this entire matter on the wall, earnestly exhorting his fellow practitioners.

The Jade Emperor’s Repentance says: “May those who use impure speech in reading, and defiled hands in touching, have their offences cleansed.” To read the scriptures with a base tongue, and to touch the sacred texts with impure hands, are very great sins. One should speedily repent to seek forgiveness. If one persists in error, knowingly committing offence, the Three Officials’ trials will be exact without remission.
