# A Tale of a Daoist Who Changed His Course

There was a Daoist friend, skilled in the various methods of Qingwei and Lingbao, adept in the arts of the Earth Office’s investigations and reckonings; he treated diseases and expelled evil spirits, and his efficacy was marked. He was a famed judge of the Minnan region. A few days ago he sent me a message, saying: “The heavy burden of driving away evil and killing karmic debts weighs too much; next year I intend to have children, and I no longer plan to continue this work.”

Though it is said that Daoist judges, by driving away evil and curing diseases, do have the merit of protecting the people, yet they are after all opposed to certain ghosts and gods. When fortune is good, or when the precepts are well observed, the ghosts and deities have no means of retaliation. But once fortune declines, or if there be transgressions of the precepts, so that the spirits find opportunity to enter, escape becomes difficult in the end.

For instance, we are well acquainted with Master Sa, who leveled altars and temples, and burned the temple of Wang Lingguan. Wang Lingguan went to the Jade Emperor to lodge a complaint. The Jade Emperor bestowed upon him a golden whip, bidding him follow Master Sa closely, saying: “If he commit any breach of precepts, smite him to death with this golden whip.” The term was twelve years. Wang Lingguan secretly followed Master Sa for twelve years, and found that every day he was engaged in cultivation, without a single breach of precept. He greatly admired him, and thus made obeisance and took refuge, willing to uphold the Daoist teachings and obey Master Sa’s commands. This is what is meant by “Observing faults for a twelve-year term, receiving the command of the Jade Emperor; accumulating merit in myriad forms, vowing to assist the Patriarch.” But many of our Daoist friends can hardly accomplish what Master Sa did.

“Heaven has the virtue of loving life,” and so it is also with regard to malevolent spirits and resentful ghosts. It is said, “Enemies should be reconciled, not aggravated.” When such cases arise, one usually speaks kindly to persuade, untying resentments, explaining grievances. Then one performs transcendence ceremonies, burning gold ingots to send off the resentful spirits. One would never at once resort to beating and killing. Among the Eight Great Mantras there is a line, “Slay demons and expel evil, kill ten thousand ghosts.” In our ordinary recitation, we say, “Slay demons and expel evil, save ten thousand souls,” striving to transform, not to antagonize.

I have a Daoist friend who excels in thunder magic. When he first entered the Way, he was exceedingly devout, daily reciting the Jade Pivot Scripture. Later, a household that was haunted invited my friend to come and see. Upon arrival, my friend set up an altar, struck the wooden fish with a clatter, and began chanting the Jade Pivot Treasure Scripture and the Northern True Martial Wonderful Scripture spoken by the Primordial Heavenly Lord, saying he wished to invite the Thunder Patriarch and the Great True Martial Emperor to take away the malignant spirits. At first, the chanting went well; but after he left, the disturbances grew fiercer. Not only was the ailment not cured, but the next day, riding his bicycle, he fell. He told me this, and I said, “Your way is not right; you cannot begin by driving away evil spirits. You must first ascertain the cause of the haunting. If possible, send them away; if you cannot, then take further measures.” So I prepared some paper money, incense, candles, and rice with water. In the evening, at the northeast corner outside the house, I lit incense and candles, burnt the paper money, poured the rice and water upon the ground, spoke kindly, and sent them off. The northeast is the Gen Palace, the ghost gate. One usually sends spirits off at this location. The morning yang energy is too strong; in the evening, when yin and yang meet, is the best time. Using this method, I have handled many similar cases with good effect.

The Inner Method of the Taiji Sacrificial Refinement says: “In former times there was a man who throughout his life devoted himself solely to sacrificial refinement; his responses were remarkable. He would not perform other methods for controlling ghosts and gods. When urged, he said: ‘Do not teach me to harbour murderous thoughts to harm ghosts and gods, thus spoiling my heart filled with compassion and refinement.’ His words were subtle; even spirits and gods pity those with compassionate hearts, and cannot bear to see them harmed; how much less would they suffer from being controlled! Those who practice magical methods are after all opposed to ghosts and gods; opposition breeds ill will. The great virtue of Heaven and Earth is the love of life, which is the fundamental mind of the Supreme Ruler. If one can preserve one’s essence and spirit intact, one will have great virtue and great merit towards all things. Should one but speak a word, it would suffice to transform ghosts and gods, summon rain and clear skies; what need is there then to perform magical rites? Just as in times of perfect government, men are transformed by the Way, and never governed by magical arts.” It is said once there was a Daoist who devoted himself solely to sacrificial refinement, and was very efficacious. He would not resort to magical arts to govern ghosts and gods. Some urged him to study the laws of judgment and summoning, the arts of expelling evil and curing disease. This friend said: “Do not teach me to harbour murderous thoughts towards ghosts and gods, spoiling my heart of compassion.” For magical arts are after all opposed to ghosts and gods, and opposition breeds ill will. It is better to devote oneself to sacrificial refinement, having great merit towards all things, so that ghosts and gods naturally respect and obey, and one may pray for clear skies and rain; what need then to perform magical rites for efficacy?
