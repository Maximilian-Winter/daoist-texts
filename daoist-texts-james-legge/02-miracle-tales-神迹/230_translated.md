# The Story of the Departed Seeking Paper Money

Du Xin was a native of Nanjing in Jiangsu. She was born into a family of moderate means, and after graduation entered upon employment. Afterwards she resigned her post to pursue further study. From childhood Du Xin was reared in her grandmother’s house; afterwards her grandmother, being over ninety years of age, passed away. Sometimes Du Xin dreamt of her deceased grandmother; at the annual festivals of the Zhongyuan and the Han Yi, she would burn paper money and bundles for the old lady.

In the Dingyou year, at the Zhongyuan festival, Du Xin, according to custom, burned paper money at the street corner for her grandmother. It was then evening, when suddenly two little boys came by the roadside and fixed their gaze upon her; one even asked, “Aunt, why are you burning paper money here so?” One of the boys ran forward, his foot stepping within the circle drawn for burning. Du Xin paid no heed to the child, praying in her heart, “Earth God, and all ancestors, forgive him, the child is ignorant.” Presently, the mother of the children arrived and took them away, saying, “This is not to be looked upon.”

After the two boys had gone, suddenly there appeared opposite a lad of some ten years sitting upon the curb, watching her burn the paper. After a time he asked, “Aunt, has someone in your family died?” Du Xin felt something strange, but made no reply and went on burning the paper. At that moment the boy’s mother came and hastily took him away. When the burning was finished, as Du was about to rise, a little girl emerged from the roadside grass and asked, “Aunt, why do you burn paper here?” Du was frightened and hurried back home, but told no one in her family of the matter.

Du Xin’s mother worked at an office, and Du carried her lunch daily. At noon on the sixteenth day of the seventh month, Du went as usual to deliver the meal. Her mother asked, “Do you still remember a certain cousin of yours?” Du replied, “Certainly I do; we were on very good terms.” Generally, cousins have little intercourse, but this cousin had been close to her, even speaking before of entrusting her with the management of his company in Nanjing. Du’s mother continued, “He died in a car accident in the first month.” Hearing this, Du’s lunch box fell to the ground and tears streamed swiftly down her face.

The Iron-Crowned Daoist said: The ancients spoke of tokens; the Plum Blossom Numerology taught of external correspondences. On reflection, the children encountered on the night of Zhongyuan were in truth reminders to her that someone in her family had passed away, and that paper money must be offered for him also. The affairs of the world are truly beyond clear explanation; science avails not to interpret them. The boundary between man and spirit is also very vague; though ghosts and spirits cannot be seen, yet they are as if above and below, as if at left and right.

The departed, when seeking aid to perform transcendence rites or to have paper money sent to them, will generally find the one certain to help them. If the person thus entrusted in a dream fails to timely render assistance to the departed, other misfortunes may befall. In our daily life, we must hold a heart of reverence. Moreover, Ms Du said she had dreamed many times of her cousin, his image clear but without a head. Generally those who die in accidents are bereft of their whole form. To perform transcendence for such persons requires cultivation of the Heavenly Medical Altar, to restore their entire form, that they may be reborn and be led to the Southern Palace.
