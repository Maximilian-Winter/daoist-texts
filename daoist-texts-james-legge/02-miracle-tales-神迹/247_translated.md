# The Elderly Grandmother Bewitched and Deceived of a Hundred Coins

Seeing that all are sharing their own experiences of the supernatural, ha… I too have undergone one, and would fain tell it. Although born in a village of the southern region of the Yangtze, when a child in the hot summer nights I most loved to sit in the courtyard and listen to the elders tell stories of spirits, ghosts, gods, foxes, and strange creatures; yet in my heart I held them as but stories, and was a materialist who believed not much in spirits or gods.

Five years ago, in a summer, my grandmother, aged ninety-three, was suddenly taken ill.

This illness was indeed strange; though in summer people’s appetites often fail, the old lady’s spirit was still good. The week before her falling ill, I came from Hangzhou to see her; we sat together in the courtyard and talked. She said, “Child, these days I keep feeling that your grandfather has come to see me, and at night I feel that he lies beside me. Perhaps your grandfather feels lonely, and wishes me to go to him.”

Then I comforted her, saying, “It must be your grandfather protecting you. He has been gone for more than thirty years. Then your mother and uncle were small; you bore the burden alone, and raised the children to adulthood. Now I have grown up, it is your time to enjoy happiness. You have suffered much; your grandfather surely wishes you to enjoy happiness.”

My grandmother laughed softly, saying, “Yes, yes, I am enjoying happiness.”

A few days later I returned to Hangzhou, and had not yet entered the gate of the housing estate when I received a call from my mother: “Your grandmother is seriously ill, speaking nonsense; she has no fever, and her blood pressure is not high; the hospital sent us home…”

This was uncanny.

I turned back and hastened home.

When I saw her again, she lay there. She would say now that the rain outside was too heavy, and she did not wish to go; now that her shoes were worn through and she must buy new ones; now that the ditch was too deep, and she could not jump across.

So she wandered in a daze for two or three days. Several elderly neighbours, who were close to grandmother, came to counsel my mother and uncle, saying: “Her soul has been seized away; preparations should be made for the end.”

My mother and the aunts still held a faint hope, believing grandmother would recover.

Indeed, after four or five days of such wandering, grandmother recovered. The first words she uttered on waking were, “Ah! Why are so many people around me? I have only taken a long journey. It was very tiring. Quickly bring me some water!” Then she called my uncle’s name to send water.

Grandmother drank half a small cup with a gulp, and leaned against the head of the bed, panting a while (indeed like one who has just run back), then told us:

“One night, after dinner, I lay on the lounge chair and dozed a while, when I saw the flower woman of the next village (an old lady about my grandmother’s age) come, bringing two others, calling me to go pick tea leaves, a hundred coins a day. So I took my basket and followed her. The place to pick tea was so far: first a carriage, then a train. After we alighted, I saw they were all dressed unlike those here. Then a man with a great beard came and pulled me and the flower woman to join the queue, very fierce. The lines marched orderly.

We went on and on. I was at the last of the queue; the flower woman was in the middle. We walked one or two days through unknown places. Seeing no one behind me, I secretly hid myself. I called to the flower woman to hide too, but she ignored me and kept walking with them… I hid a while, then tried to go back, but I knew not the way and could not find the road home. Not far off I saw my brother trading, who took me home to eat. My mother made me a pair of shoes to change on the road, and my brother sent me to the station, telling me where to alight and which way to go. I took the carriage to the station, and saw my father-in-law had opened a small eatery (my grandfather). My mother-in-law was still so beautiful, like a gentlewoman. She packed a bowl of small wontons for me to eat quickly and depart, saying if I missed the returning train, I would not be able to go, for war was coming, the Japanese were coming. I did not finish the wontons but left. The rain fell more and more; I lost one of the shoes my mother made. The planes of the Japanese roared overhead; I was terrified and ran desperately. Later, I saw your grandfather; he brought me back.

Along the way he scolded me for being foolish, for being so old and yet being tricked out of a hundred coins, and for neglecting the many young ones in the family; for taking a basket and running away with strangers. He told me to behave well at home, eat regularly, sleep on time, but not to eat too much, only seven-tenths full at each meal, and above all to remember this phrase. Then, behold! I see so many of you gathered here.”

The next day, the flower woman’s youngest son from the neighbouring village came to our grandmother’s village to “announce the death,” saying his mother passed away last night; that she had been unwell a few days, lying at home… and had then departed.

My grandmother is now ninety-eight; except for somewhat deaf ears, her mind is still clear, and she can care for herself.

Ha ha ha, this is the experience of my grandmother.
