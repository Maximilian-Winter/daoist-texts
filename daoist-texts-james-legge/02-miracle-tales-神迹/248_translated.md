# The Last Meeting with Grandfather ere his Rebirth

My grandfather passed away when I was but twelve years old. In his lifetime, owing to atrophy of the brain, he had forgotten many persons and many matters, and his power of speech was no longer clear; yet he was able to remember me.

When I was still very young, I began to perform various labours of the farm, doing many things; I helped my grandfather to wash clothes, to fetch water, to bathe, and so forth. Thus it was not easy for me, in the days when my grandfather cherished the male child above the female, to obtain his affection. Yet I loved him very much.

During the three years after my grandfather's death, I dreamed of him but two or three times; and when I awoke, the memory of the dream was never clear. Only the last time that I dreamed of him, I clearly knew that he had passed away; he said to me, "I am going to a very distant place, to be reborn again; hereafter you will dream of me no more." Then he turned and departed.

I wept, and said to him, "Grandfather, do not go!" I kept following him, not allowing him to depart; but he constantly bade me not to follow. I pursued him to the back of the house of my uncle, and he said to me, "The dawn is near; I must go." Then he vanished. The cock of my uncle crowed several times, and the sun arose in the dream.

I suddenly cried out aloud, "Grandfather!" and awoke. It was then that my clock had sounded (for I had set it to imitate the crowing of a cock). Yet the tears in the corner of my eye told me that this was true. Since that time I have never again dreamed of my grandfather. Therefore I believe in the affinity of former and present lives.
