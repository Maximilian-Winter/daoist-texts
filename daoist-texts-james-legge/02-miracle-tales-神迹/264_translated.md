# The Story of a Worthy Man of Shandong Delivering the Unoffered Orphaned Spirits

Li Chengshun, a man of Qingdao in Shandong, one year suddenly had a dream. In his dream were three or five children, their garments tattered and torn, following after Li Chengshun; dimly perceived also was a monk.

Upon awaking from the dream, he found gradually that all things went ill with him, and his whole body was without strength. He therefore sought out the local Daoist priest to inquire into the cause. The priest asked, ‘Have you ever caused an abortion?’ Li Chengshun replied, ‘I have been unmarried all along, and have had no such experience.’

The priest again inquired, ‘When did this circumstance first arise?’ Li Chengshun said, ‘It has only been this year.’

‘Have you recently changed your dwelling?’

Li Chengshun answered, ‘Yes, I have.’

Li Chengshun further related that he was now working at a building site; the place had formerly been a memorial hall to the War of Resistance. When the Japanese invaded China, a battle had there taken place; the Japanese soldiers slew many innocent people. But no rites of deliverance had been performed, and so the resentment was heavy, and orphaned spirits wandered. At times, even in the heat of summer, a gust of cold wind would come through the room, causing the hairs to stand on end. The elders said that formerly there was a monastery here; the monk sided with the Japanese and aided them, and the villagers, unable to endure it, slew the monk.

The priest said, ‘The spirits that die having grievances, when some matters are not resolved, refuse to be reborn. Or, at their death, a spell was cast to bind their souls here. They are orphaned spirits and wild ghosts, unregistered by the city god, unnoted by the Eastern Peak deity, and cannot be reborn. Alas! Alas!’

Li Chengshun prostrated himself, saying, ‘Today they have come to me, knowing that I have the Daoist connection. Therefore, in any case, I will assist them. I hope the priest will have compassion, and raise the great dharma cloud, let fall the great dharma rain, universally bestow the sweet dew, rescue the nether regions, receive the unoffered spirits, and conduct them straight to the joys of men and heaven. I, your disciple, am ready to lay out all my means to help.’

They therefore chose an auspicious day to open the altar, constructed the Great Yellow Register fasting; universally benefited the nether regions; the fasting feast was completed; the heavens sent down sweet rain; on the following day the clouds dispersed and the rain ceased; and it was felt that the place had a clear and bright air, and auspicious energy filled the court.
