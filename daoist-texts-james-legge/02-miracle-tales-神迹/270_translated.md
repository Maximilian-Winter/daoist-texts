# The Worthy Emperor Wenchang Exhorts Men to Reverence and Cherish Written Paper

The Worthy Emperor Wenchang, also called the Emperor of Zitong, is the deity presiding over literary fortune and examinations. In ancient times, the scholars who took part in the imperial examinations held him in special veneration. The Worthy Emperor Wenchang is often named together with the Worthy Emperor Guan, one civil, the other military; these two spirits are not only important deities in the Taoist system, but also significant emblems of Chinese culture. The faith in Wenchang flourished exceedingly in the Southern regions, whence came the saying, 'Confucius in the North, Wenchang in the South.' There are three well-known scriptures exhorting to goodness, widely influential in society, venerated as the three sacred scriptures, namely the Taishang Ganying Pian, the Wenchang Dijun Yin Zhi Wen, and the Guansheng Dijun Jueshi Zhenjing. Besides the Yin Zhi Wen, the Worthy Emperor Wenchang has many other scriptures exhorting goodness and educating the world, such as the Wenchang Dijun Quanyao Wen, the Wenchang Dijun Gongguo Ge, and the Jiao Chuang Shi Ze.

The Worthy Emperor Wenchang advocates culture and education, and especially lays stress on exhorting men to reverence and cherish written paper; that is, to show respect and love for paper inscribed with characters. The scriptures entitled Wenchang Dijun Quan Jingxi Zi Wen, Wenchang Dijun Xi Zi Zhenquan, and Wenchang Dijun Xi Zi Gong LÃ¼ Ershisi Tiao are all on this theme.

Characters are sacred and exalted; the characters inscribed upon paper ought not to be profaned at pleasure. Reverence and cherishing of written paper bring rewards of wealth, honour, and longevity, whereas disrespect and wastefulness bring poverty, hardship, premature death, and heavenly punishment. Those who reverence and cherish written paper may enjoy long life and riches, and their descendants may be renowned and distinguished; especially the scholars who take the imperial examinations may succeed in passing them. But those who do not cherish written paper may suffer diverse calamities during life and after death. Yet it must be that the contents written on the paper to be cherished are upright and conform to moral regulations; as to strange, licentious, and evil books, these must be burnt without delay.

Paper inscribed with characters must not be cast away or trampled under foot at will, nor used to paste windows or doors, nor mingled with other refuse. Even waste paper must be sincerely and respectfully burnt. Hence in many regions there have arisen structures called the Tower for Cherishing Characters and the Pavilion for Cherishing Characters, specially built for the burning of books and paper inscribed with characters. On appointed days ceremonies are held, and the burning is concentrated, the ashes of the characters being cast into rivers and streams. In some places associations for cherishing characters have been organized, carrying lanterns bearing words urging the cherishing of written paper, going about the streets to collect paper, and regularly purchasing waste paper and old books.

The Chinese characters are profound and extensive, with a source and flow unending. Cangjie, the creator of the characters, was called by Fuxi the historiographer, and was afterwards venerated as a deity; in many places there are temples to the Emperor Cang. Cangjie invented the writing; hence history could come to be, able to record and compile annals, and to manifest themselves to the world; hence came the government by letters. Moreover, Cangjie's creation of characters moved Heaven, which sent down grain, and after Shen Nong's discovery, it was widely cultivated and spread all over the land. This myth also reflects the exalted position of writing in Chinese culture.

Characters are the carrier of culture; it is through Chinese characters that Chinese culture has been transmitted through a thousand years and flourished. To reverence and cherish written paper, and to exhort men to protect books, has important and positive significance for the preservation of ancient works and the transmission of traditional culture. Moreover, in these days of advanced computers and networks, many employ computers in office and study, and often suffer from the fault of forgetting characters when taking up the brush. From this point of view, the Worthy Emperor Wenchang's teaching men to reverence and respect characters has strong practical significance.
