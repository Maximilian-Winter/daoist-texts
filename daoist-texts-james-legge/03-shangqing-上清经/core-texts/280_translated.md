# The Great Cave Golden Flower Jade Scripture

### Title of the Scripture: The Great Cave Golden Flower Jade Scripture.  
The author is unknown, and it is roughly dated to the Southern and Northern Dynasties period. It is a revised and compiled work from the "Female One Jade Examination Five Elders Precious Scripture." It consists of one scroll. The source text is from the "Orthodox Taoist Canon," section on the Cavern of Truth, under the category of methods and formulas.

He who obtains the secret of the Great Cave, the Great One Above the Way, the Female One in union and transformation, must first recite the Imperial Lord’s Supreme Wishes and the Mysterious Mother’s Eightfold Golden Flower Hidden Texts. These are the forbidden books held within the bosom of the Emperor of the Nine Heavens. If one is to transmit them to disciples, one must first observe a fast, one day before and one day after, and then a pure fast of one hundred days is required before it may be entrusted. A middle fast of seventy days and a lesser fast of thirty-nine days are observed, fasting severely and mutually transmitting thus. If the person is not examined, or if the fast is not observed and the text is transmitted, the master of the scripture shall die, and the recipient shall lose both lights. If the fasting is not strict, the master will become ill, and the recipient shall lose speech. The giving is weighty upon the master of the scripture, guarding against light perusal. Disaster will befall the disciple, therefore be careful of mouth and eyes. Heavy offences will bring calamity upon seven generations, and troubles will be born in the world beyond. If one obtains this scripture and accepts it, then practice it without error, neglect, or substitution, expounding its covenant exactly as the supreme method dictates. Serve the master of the scripture during the three periods of fasting as one would serve sovereign and father. Reflect in a secluded chamber in a quiet grove as if no one were present. Preserve the Five Spirits in the purple chamber as if the true numinous were therein. Those who are not sovereign masters, father and son, or brothers must not receive it; this shows the use of the object of the void and the true, and makes clear the difficulty of guarding the prohibitions and of not offending them. Those not in the chamber of sovereign master, father and son, or brothers must not tread therein; this shows the stopping of the feet and not spreading abroad, and reveals the embracing of unity in concealment and seclusion. Those not of the garments of sovereign master, father and son, or brothers must not wear them; this shows the heavenly kinship in not having many, revealing overflowing and self-pruning. Refine the subtle awareness of the heavenly essence, cut off all mundane burdens and near imaginings, and by utmost practice manifest in bitter hardship, completely disappearing like no shadow; three meals suffice by the mountain stream; seal sincerity tightly in the attainment of going forth. Then your voice will speed to the chamber of the Five Elders, your virtue rise above the Three Pure Ones; preserve the inner concentration in the clear jade; cause your robes and kerchief to be fresh and undefiled; think of the Three Origins in the mud pellet; guard the Nine Truths in the dwelling of the form; exhale and inhale the Five Flowers; breathe the jade liquid; seek immortality morning and evening in the sameness of the void; in sleep and rest awaken the spirit in the Great Desert; diligently without weariness, carefully without cessation. Such a man may at last be spoken to concerning the gate of the Great Cave, and premeditate the subtle imaginings of the Way. He who reveres it ascends the Three Mornings and roams the Great Firmament; he who violates it sinks into the Three Springs and enters the Great Quiet.

He who transmits must cause the scripture and secret instructions to be given twice, and not suddenly impart all at once. Those first imparting the method and secret wish that it be practiced and preserved in thought, refining the Five Forms, recalling the Purple Chamber, dispersing defilement and dissipating passions, earnestly maintaining unity, expecting the spirit night and day. Hence the Great Elixir is hidden and mysterious, called the "Golden Flower Scripture," the Three Origins Jade Mornings, thus called the Female One Essence. According to cultivation of the Female One for three years, one then obtains to recite the "Great Cave True Scripture of Thirty-nine Chapters." Now when receiving this secret instruction, one also may practice it; in practicing the secret matters, one is sure to attain to spirit immortality, without necessarily holding the entire "Great Cave True Scripture" to understand it thoroughly.

If one preserves sincere feeling and unites with truth to face the image, the Three Origins are revealed. Having obtained this scripture, the mysterious and empty descend and bestow it; Huang-Lao (the Yellow Emperor and Laozi) announce the talisman; spirits move and guide the radiance; the Five Elders scatter flowers; documents are received in the empty space, immediately ascending to the Great Nothing.

The twelve wishes of the Imperial Lord are: Wish Heaven, Wish Earth, Wish Wind, Wish Clouds, Wish Yin, Wish Yang, Wish Great Void, Wish Great Nothingness, Wish Great Emptiness, Wish Great Existence, Wish Self-Generation, Wish Birth of Spirits.  
The Mysterious Mother’s Eightfold Gate and the text of traveling in between are:  
Wish that the Mysterious Mother be born with me amid vital breath;  
Wish that she exist with me between sun and moon;  
Wish that she protect me amid the Nine Heavens;  
Wish that she feed with me amid nature;  
Wish that she drink with me beside the Gourd River;  
Wish that she rest with me amid the Jade Truth;  
Wish that she sleep with me within the Immortal Hall;  
Wish that she roam with me amid the Three Mysteries.

The oracle in the separate chamber must always read this scripture, never forgetting for a moment; this is the inner wish to the Imperial Lord, opening the Eightfold Gate of Goodness. Now the immortals of the Five Sacred Mountains and the divine maidens of the Sacred Land still sip the jade nectar and hold precious fruits, speak of the great wishes, proclaim the Eightfold Gate, await the Great Origin, serve the Three Origins, aspire to the morning firmament, be the Jade Truth, pluck the seven generations, enter the Broad Cold—how much less are those common and vile of the world, base of the Five Turbidities! They ought to take their places and cultivate; having heard, will they not act? Though form and spirit be refined and suffer the pains of life, if the seven generations bear guilt and do not release it, there is no hope of immortality for oneself. Therefore it is necessary to open the Great Wishes, proclaim the Eightfold Gate, to resolve accumulated knots. When the seven examinations are blessed, the oracle may be immortal; immortality is the root and origin of the Way, the foundation of becoming an immortal. Those who aspire to these tasks should not fail to be diligent in long preservation.

The Twelve Supreme Wishes of the Emperor of the Nine Heavens and the Mysterious Mother’s Eightfold Divine Gate Texts, in the Return-to-Origin Fivefold Communication, dispel worldly calamities, bestow blessings on the seven ancestors, causing the body to attain immortals. In quietude within the secret chamber, incense is scattered and smoke made proper, while reading the "Great Cave Golden Flower Scripture," saying:

### The Great Whirlwind Great Mixture Imperial One’s Way of Preservation and Cultivation Nine Diagrams

In cultivating this scripture, after completing the prayers and name invocations, one closes both eyes, holds within the hundred spirits transforming into white vapor, like ear smoke, coming from the mysterious void into the mouth. After long meditation, one feels the white vapor descending, issuing from the lower orifices, again issuing from the jade phallus orifice. One perceives the white vapor issuing from the soles of the feet and palms of the hands, surrounding the whole body with a crown, hands and feet mingling, forming one body.

The white vapor flows like smoke up and down, but they do not see each other.

![](/media/202305/2023-05-09_170123_3473020.6441306240432735.png)  
After long meditation, the white vapor suddenly changes colour, becoming a dense purple cloud, again entering through the mouth to the head and into the five viscera, filling the abdomen.

![](/media/202305/2023-05-09_170128_7838230.8191262039294841.png)  
After long meditation, the purple cloud issues again from the soles of the feet, the palms, the great orifices, and the jade phallus orifice, crowning and encircling the body.

![](/media/202305/2023-05-09_170138_0026600.5703383784966397.png)  
After long meditation, the vapor thickens up and down, uniting with the purple cloud in form, but they do not see each other.

![](/media/202305/2023-05-09_170144_5012730.27860402200214796.png)  
Suddenly, holding the vapor of the purple cloud, filling left and right and within one chamber, then seeing a fan of wind issuing from the mouth, the purple cloud smoke turns, entwines, and knots.

![](/media/202305/2023-05-09_170155_4859380.4629117323623554.png)  
Suddenly forming a true man, male form, image of beginning of birth, four cun in height, called the Great Cave Imperial One Venerable Lord, named Father Ningzai, styled Union Mother Essence; he is the guardian of the death gate of many spirits, returning wind mixed, jointly forming the Imperial One Venerable Lord.

![](/media/202305/2023-05-09_170202_9756550.7593995263066019.png)  
Again holding this Venerable Lord, entering my mouth beneath the tongue, again ascending directly from under the tongue to the purple chamber and the Six Harmonies Palace, sitting upright facing outward to the Venerable Lord, left hand holding the oracle’s five registers, right hand holding the oracle’s five talismans; to the left side of the Venerable Lord’s mouth shines sunlight, nine cun in diameter; to the right side shines moonlight, one cun in diameter. The Venerable Lord’s tongue emits the returning wind’s Qi, blowing upon this sun and moon light, all luxuriant, sometimes white, sometimes red, sending the luminous Qi down into the five oracles, six palaces, and hundred joints of the whole body, penetrating and illuminating, inside and outside as bright as the midday sun. After long meditation forgetting the self, suddenly the matter is complete.

This diagram roughly paints the image between the eyebrows, as stored in the eighth diagram, greatly in the purple chamber and Six Harmonies Palace, which is the Mud Pellet Palace of the Six Harmonies.

![](/media/202305/2023-05-09_170216_5441510.4450766068166174.png)  
Then the mind prays:

Great Cave Imperial One, Supreme Origin Venerable Spirit, Father Ningzai Mother Essence, Two united in dual completion, Hundred true great mixture, One cycle beginning birth, body formed of eight smokes, transforming fetal origin infant, sun and moon precious light, illuminating my form, Supreme One above, united with the Emperor, Mud Pellet guarding jade, five viscera bright and clear, long united with sun and moon, hands holding the Cave Scripture, position as Immortal Elder, spirit ascending Upper Clarity, thirty-nine chapters, golden talisman feathered court.

This is the way of the Great Whirlwind Great Mixture Imperial One, completed. Ten thousand transformations and a hundred changes, the method of the True Cave Supreme One, exhausted in this.

Every evening keep the Great Cave Imperial One Venerable Lord present, beneath the oracle’s nose, in the middle of the philtrum, always present inside the mouth beyond the upper teeth, beneath the nose and upper lip. The Venerable Lord’s form always faces outward, sitting, standing, moving, abiding in the mind’s preservation. Preserve the Venerable Lord holding sunlight in the mouth, nine cun in diameter, shining ten thousand measures, brightening the oracle’s body. The One is the true one of the Emperor. The transformations of the One return to the One. When reading the Great Cave True Scripture, also preserve the Imperial One Venerable Lord before the oracle’s face, with the Venerable Spirit’s mouth facing the oracle’s mouth, facing each other to hear my reading of the Cave Scripture, to disperse the bindings of seven generations.

The Imperial One Venerable Lord, named Father Ningzai, styled Union Mother Essence, is to be remembered day and night without forgetting, driving away ten thousand trials, extinguishing a thousand suffering, removing evil demons, leading to spirit immortality. If the oracle’s body holds pain or unrest, quickly preserve the Imperial One Venerable Lord, cause the mouth to emit sunlight and white vapor to fumigate the painful place, and the pain will immediately be healed.

The Imperial One Venerable Lord appears as a newly born male, naked, four cun in height. This is called the great mixture returning to the fetal, the true form of beginning.

### The Great Cave Inner Method of Preservation and Cultivation of the True Unity of Female and Male in Thirteen Diagrams

According to the nine palaces in front and behind, one by one the palaces hide each other, facing and backing shadows, unable to face each other, making it difficult to paint a correct front image. Now following the order of arrangement, being on the right side, painting a frontal figure would be heavy; if painted in profile, again the conception is not correct. Please preserve the true spirits of each palace, facing forward and sitting upright; among them the three truths, that is, the two truths facing each other, let them appear as in seclusion notes. The head inch and the Bright Hall together form one inch; though painted frontally, it is also fixed on the right side. The fine details preserved and used, as in the scripture for nine years, the white sun rises to heaven.
