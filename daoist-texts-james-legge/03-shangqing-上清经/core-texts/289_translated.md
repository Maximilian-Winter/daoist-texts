Opening the Scripture, the profound mystery incantation:

Penetrate the subtle mysterious gate, brilliantly illumining the empty vastness. The supreme Way is attained through stillness and silence; then will one behold the Three Pure Palaces. Here the great Way is perfected; mounting the chariot of splendour, driving the cloud-dragon. To the left and right attending the true Scripture are Jade Maidens and Jade Boys; the body crossing the ferry of immortality, releasing bonds and harmonizing with the spirit wind. The Seven Ancestors return to the embryonic birth, becoming the sect of the immortals in the world.

Clicking the teeth, closing the eyes, bowing the heart to intone:

I, the insignificant servant named ***[name omitted]***, now have a humble word to offer, first to present to the Jade Pure Qiong Yuan Sovereign, the Most Holy Ten Thousand True Supreme Dao Sovereign, the Central Yellow Old Elemental Dao Sovereign, the Supreme Pure General Immortal Great Marshal Longevity Master Lord of the Three Heavens Bai Cheng, the bestowed Great Scripture Master, Supreme True Holy Mother Ziwei Primordial Sovereign Lady Wang, the bestowed Master of Returning Wind Great Mixture, Supreme True Holy Mother Zhonghou Primordial Sovereign Lady Wang, Supreme Pure Nine Micro Supreme Jade Protector Sovereign Jinque Chief Minister Great Commander of Fate Gao Chen Master Eastern Sea Sovereign Qinghua Little Child Lord, Supreme Pure Supreme No East Rosy Dawn Fusang Cinnabar Forest Great Emperor Supreme Dao Sovereign, Patriarch of the South Pole Purple True Supreme Pure Dao Lord Yuchen Holy Empress Jinque Supreme Protector Donghua Dao Sovereign, Jinque Great Officer Supreme Pure Immortal Marquis,

Closing the eyes to preserve the Emperor’s One Honoured Sovereign, like an infant, four cun in length, dwelling beneath the nose in the philtrum skin, presiding over the assembly of the hundred spirits, seated among the five-coloured clouds.  
Preserving the Emperor’s One Honoured Sovereign in the void mystery, whose mouth faces directly the servant’s mouth, listening to the recitation of the Jade Scripture.

## The Great Cavern Jade Scripture Volume One

### The Supreme Void Emperor Lord's Dao Scripture, Chapter One

The qi of the Supreme Jade Emperor resides in man’s body as the bright beam qi of the nose, responding beneath the nose in man’s philtrum. For man receives the embryo's formation, first the nose is born; the meaning of the nasal ancestor is taken from this. The sect wind is another name for the ancestor qi, continuously generating and transforming, profound beyond profound, the meaning of grandchild is taken from this. Those who once personally knot and scatter mean that man’s body is the ancestor’s secret cast-off shell, hidden and manifest; within lies the mechanism of natural invocation; knotting and scattering is to obtain great liberation. Emperor One Supreme Radiance is the true One Non-dual Dharma Gate, the most supreme wonderful Way. Linking multitudes to gather the mist means connecting multitudinous qi, gathering spiritual smoke, taking the lungs as the five organs’ splendid canopy; the bright beam ancestor qi is rooted in the nose. The six luminaries refer to the Southern Dipper six luminaries; qi floats Southern flame, signifying the embryo’s transformation and ease of form alteration.
