The Method of Taking the Nine Stars of the Northern Dipper

The Method of Taking the Five Stars of the Five Directions

The Method of Taking the Nine Stars of the Northern Dipper

The brightness of the sun and moon is called Light; the essence of the stars is called Radiance; collectively named the Seven Luminaries, and collectively called the Three Luminaries. Luminary (jing) is the image of bright essence. When the image is attained and brightness embraced, containing radiance and receiving it, one attains longevity and immortality, called a person of the Three Luminaries. Such a one ascends into emptiness and enters the luminary, becoming one with the True, transforming freely and conforming to the True. This is the secret of the highest sages; be cautious not to transmit it rashly.

Regularly, on the months of the first, fourth, seventh, and tenth — the months of the four beginnings — in the early ten days, on the ninth day at dawn; also on the second, fifth, eighth, and eleventh months — the months of the four middles — in the middle ten days, on the nineteenth day at midday; and on the third, sixth, ninth, and twelfth months — the months of the four ends — on the twenty-ninth day at midnight; on the first day of the month, perform the practice thrice. From dawn to midday and night; from midday to night and dawn; from night and dawn to midday. Thirty-six times a year, corresponding to the count of three hundred and sixty degrees. The five is the fullness of qi and its remainder. At the appointed times, enter the chamber with pure solemnity, burn incense, concentrate the spirit, close the eyes and hold the breath, strike the teeth nine times until thorough, retain the vision of the Nine Star Palaces and Lords, whose majestic countenances are dignified and correct, standing guard firmly.

The First is the Yang Bright Spirit Person, who exhales the light of azure qi.

The Second is the Yin Spirit Person, who exhales the light of black qi.

The Third is the True Spirit Person, who exhales the light of yellow qi.

The Fourth is the Mysterious Darkness Spirit Person, who exhales the light of red qi.

The Fifth is the Vermilion Origin Spirit Person, who exhales the light of white qi.

The Sixth is the North Pole Spirit Person, who exhales the light of green qi.

The Seventh is the Heavenly Pass Spirit Person, who exhales the light of crimson qi.

The Eighth is the Auxiliary Star Spirit Person, who exhales the light of blue-green qi.

The Ninth is the Supporting Star Spirit Person, who exhales the light of profound black qi.

Each of the nine qi descends from the stars, emitting through the "portals of portent" in the mouth in turn, breathing out accordingly; the utmost qi is swallowed, the subtle and infinitesimal qi communicates, delicately breathing out the accumulated qi, gradually receiving the new qi of nine colors; when all is swallowed, strike the teeth nine times thoroughly. Whether sitting, lying, walking, or resting, in movement or stillness, regulate appropriately. Thus continued for nine years, the Nine Sovereign Spirit Lords descend and bestow the portent secret, granting longevity and immortality, ascending to the Three Heavens, joining fellowship with a multitude of perfected ones, becoming united with the Way.

The Method of Taking the Five Stars of the Five Directions

Regularly on the days of the Five Kings, at the hour of the Six Ding, enter the chamber with solemnity, burn incense and preserve the spirit, close the eyes and hold the breath, strike the teeth twenty-five times thoroughly, swallow saliva twenty-five times, harmonize the heart and calm the qi, straighten the body and remain still; then see the year star with azure qi, the Mars star with red qi, the Venus star with white qi, the Jupiter star with black qi, and the Saturn star with yellow qi, each in its proper direction, luxuriant and resplendent, their mists intermingling and surrounding, the five colors blending, bright and luminous, crowning heaven and penetrating earth, spreading throughout the four directions, centrally illuminating the portent body, permeating inside and out. After a while the body warms, the fragrance of incense is fragrant. Then turning toward the direction of the King, first swallow the King's qi, next swallow the generating qi, proceeding all around until finished. Swallow each according to the King's number: East nine, South eight, Center three, West six, North five. When completed, again strike the teeth twenty-five times thoroughly, swallow saliva twenty-five times. Practice thus for five years, and the Five Emperors will support and guide you, roaming and feasting in the Jade Capital, forever becoming a True Person.

Whoever takes the essence qi of the sun, moon, Northern Dipper, and Five Stars must not speak much, must not overexert, must not be negligent or idle, must not show joy or anger, must not raise the voice, must not foolishly inquire after other affairs, must not seek rank or inferior status, must not be partial, withered, or solitary, must not mix with those unequal in rank, must not claim to possess the Way, must not disclose the method of the teaching, must not eagerly desire rapid results, must not doubt the spirits, must not forsake self for the pursuit of things, must not control things while conforming to the body, must not oppose the two images, must not contravene the Three Honors. Though one observe other precepts and practice all rules, without this principle the mysterious spirit will not be proud, nor descend nor protect, nor manifest nor complete. The capacity to accomplish the Way depends on this secret. Those who pursue higher learning must reverently obey and practice it.

Those who revere the Three Luminaries are called Disciples of the Three Luminaries. After crossing three persons, entrusting to teachers and friends, thereafter receiving transmission, one is entitled Master, Teacher, or True Person of the Three Luminaries. By the command of the teacher and recommendation of friends, one may then be so called. Without formal declaration, one must not falsely claim the title. Those who falsely claim great names, coveting honor, will be severely punished with no pardon for three offenses. If one offends, one must promptly repent, first turning to the Azure Youth to reform old faults. Following the words of the teacher, one must not offend again; three offenses lead to original cause. Repeated apologies increase labour and guilt. The diligent scholar must be especially careful.

All who receive the Way value immortality, cultivate effective practice, secure longevity, and unceasing life, thereby becoming perfect sages. The foundation of a sage is to conduct transformation; transformation teaches to revive the lost; the confused do not follow; compassionately they are not abandoned; returning from confusion to order, soothing them with utmost diligence. Kindly encouraging the compliant, they do not grow weary; sorrowful thoughts do not arise; anger and resentment are not roused. When anger reproves, first observe the heart; if possible, employ kindness to move it; if not, do not conceal resentment to pacify it; pacification must not allow the grudge; grudges lead to further fault. More stirring must be given, surely to advance them; retreat gains blessings, gain blessings; solitary study is ineffective, virtue cannot be perfected. In primeval antiquity, there was no business; faults were rare and required no merit to atone. By earnest thought and guarding stillness, without mutual intercourse, all attained the true Way. Since the middle ages, affairs have become complex; resentments accumulated; urgent merit is required; self-diminution to save others; preserving the Way and reciting scriptures; following teachers without slackening; day and night focusing, body and mind in movement and rest, enduring hardship without complaint; avoiding evil tendencies, startled as if stepping into boiling water; delighting in good, as thirsting for drink. When the world is blocked, one temporarily preserves solitude; when the world is open, one forever widely assists. When danger is unmanageable, one departs carefree; sorrow is in the heart, thoughts unceasing. Decline can be saved by diligent management, restraining and drawing in, expanding and contracting, observing times; joy and anger, reward and punishment, promotion and demotion follow the time. The fate of times has its yes or no; sages and true ones have their conduct and retirement; except for utmost subtlety, none can fully understand this. The superficial and unlearned, falsely calling true, feebly acting great, not knowing obstruction and passage, confused not knowing avoidance, rashly desiring merit — calamity comes without awareness; planning success results in failure. Some do not repent, taking calamity as blessing; some repent late, with nothing to pursue. The revolving five sufferings are profoundly painful. Those aspiring to higher learning must increase study and detail; transformation of body and things must be by ability and talent; one cannot have a mosquito bear a mountain; one must not fail and only then realize; great and small each have subtle methods; measure strength and proceed step by step; all follow the teacher’s secret, not acting arbitrarily. The mind is like a monkey or ape, or like a blazing fire; it must not be grasped or held; unless one is a true master, how can one make it right? Rightness comes from oneself; oneself is half teacher, half self; the two halves make one; thus one attains perfection. Without teacher, one cannot return; without self, no transformation. Transformation is returning, changing and exchanging; discarding old and embracing new; abandoning evil and entering good; refining falsehood into truth. This is the merit of the true teacher, the virtue of true quality; merit harmonized and united forever, one with the Way.

All who desire to learn the Way should be ashamed to steal scriptures or purchase precepts; not understanding the profound instructions, acting at will. Some do not follow the sacred texts, acting by nature to do good; good indeed is good, yet goodness is not full; partial small good is not great virtue; demons come to destroy it; thus falling into evil factions, forever separated from the Way, vainly learning reputation, without learning substance — this too is lamentable. Such persons urgently should repent; early awakening is curable, late hardly accomplished. The learner should examine oneself and others; though others be hard to know, know them by law; law investigates rising and resting; observe inside and outside; heart and body may be resolved; emptiness and fullness may be clarified; remove emptiness and praise fullness; merit and virtue have proofs.
