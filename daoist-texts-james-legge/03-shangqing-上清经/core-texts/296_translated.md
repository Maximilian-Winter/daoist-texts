### The Scripture of the True Text of the Golden Chapter of the Supreme Cavern of Perfected Reality, the Tiger Talisman

The true talisman of the Right Golden Tiger, bestowed by the Heavenly Emperor of the Supreme Netherlight (Taiwei), to the Emperor of the Golden Palace. Written in vermilion on white silk, enclosed in a purple brocade pouch, and worn upon the head. When so borne, it commands the heavens and earth and the multitude of spirits; the immortals reverently submit; the Jade Splendour holds the kerchief; the Heavenly Guardians defend the body; the mountains and rivers prostrate their essences. Added are the spells of the august and mighty gods, and the seals of the jade essence; thus one may behead the nine demons and destroy a thousand spirits. This is the talisman of the Upper Clarity; it is not transmitted in the world. Whoever obtains and wears it will ascend and be raised to the Upper Clarity.

The inner spell of the Mighty and August Golden Truth of the Great Origin and Highest Radiance, to summon and command the divine soldiers, to behead and destroy evil souls. When entering a chamber, incense must be burned; one must knock the teeth thirty-six times in communication; sitting or lying at will, then recite the spell:

“Expel the Dry Poison King, shake the banner of Zhen Shi Luo; the Eight Immortals hold their axes; the Five Spirits of the Supreme Emperor; the Supreme Mysterious Falling Radiance; the Seven Mornings of the Guarded Court; the Yellow True Shining Talisman; the blazing fire bell cast forth; the Divine Tiger rouses its vigour; the poison blade wild and unrestrained; the purple swelling ritual; the four leaps resound upwards; Nine Heavens and Six Heavens; the four heavens crystal clear; the outer encirclement of the Mysterious Breath; the inner guarding of the commanding soldiers; left is majesty, right is vigilance; the wind smites, the fire marches; shouting to behead ten thousand demons; drawing out and beheading a thousand essences; the Golden Truth opens the thunder; the nine demons seize their forms; the northern Feng crushes and falls; all destroyed and overturned. I wear the true talisman, commanding ten thousand spirits; the Three Origins announce the truth; the Mysterious Union is the sincerity of the Emperor; the Supreme Netherlight issues the highest command; ascending to the Three Pure Ones.”

The method of the inner spell of the Mighty and August Highest Radiance is all a forbidden scripture of the Upper Clarity. The Dry Poison King is the inner name of the great ghosts of the Six Heavens. The shaking banner of Zhen Shi Luo is a concealed name of the demon king of the Northern Emperor. The four heavens crystal clear are the names of the souls of the ghostly forms of Northern Feng. If one knows the names of these three ghosts, then a thousand demons will flee and vanish, ten thousand ghosts will hide their shapes, nine demons will not dare to move or try, and a hundred evils will not be able to display their harm. Whether dwelling alone in the mountains and forests, or among the gods and ghosts of the official temples, one may proceed with the spell without burning incense or entering a chamber. Furthermore, write the talisman in orpiment on blue silk, three chi in length and one chi two cun in breadth; it may also be square, one chi two cun each side. Border the outer edges with four strips, and bind with cinnabar brocade, to be worn on the right side at the waist. When ascending to a fast or entering a chamber, or at the court celebrations of the eighth and ninth days, to command demons and summon spirits, to drive and direct the divine truths, wear it and then proceed. Care must be taken not to face corpses or filth; the guilt is as for leakage of the secret, and the ancestor of the Seven Mysteries will punish in Hell.

The Supreme Divine Tiger Jade Scripture, the Inner True Talisman of the Divine Tiger

The true talisman of the Divine Tiger issues from the Parents of the Nine Heavens of the Great Reality; the Great Reality Elder transmitted it to the Little Boy of the Eastern Sea; the True King of the Nine Heavens transmitted it to the Supreme Dao Lord. The Supreme Dao Lord ever treasures it in secret, storing it within the jade chamber of the Jade Palace of the Ling Metropolis of the Supreme Netherlight. Guarded by great beasts and defended by poisonous dragons; the Divine Tiger with seven thousand forms, ready in the Golden Palace; the Golden Morning Jade Boy and the White Spirit Jade Maiden, each three hundred persons, attend and guard the spiritual script. The mysterious splendour fills the void, scattering smoke over the purple court; majesty shakes the nine distant regions; divine light shines forth in the Upper Clarity; the subtle joy opens naturally; penetrating and extending through the formless. The Divine Tiger bears its mark; the Golden Tiger extends its truth; wisdom marks its standard; it dispels demons and reveals its source. The subtle instructions and hidden phrases, of wondrous delight, are difficult to detail, all bearing the concealed names of heavenly demons or marking the inner names of myriad gods. To recite its chapters causes a thousand essences to be startled; to chant its verses binds ten thousand demons. With the founding of government in the Three Heavens, it was entrusted to the Heavenly Emperor of the Supreme Netherlight, to wield power over the Six Heavens, to behead ten thousand demons, to command mountains and call the seas, to bind the multitude of spirits, to awe demons and destroy tests, to circle the five stars. Thereupon the Heavenly Emperor of the Supreme Netherlight received the two talismans of dispelling demons and wisdom, to wear in roaming the Upper Clarity, riding the void and drifting on the Supreme Netherlight, clearing the radiance of the Great Reality’s palace, halting on the steps of the Jade Emperor, tranquilly conforming with heaven and earth, moving in accord with the seven radiances, rectifying the nine mysteries, grasping the pivot of spiritual mechanism, leading and embracing myriad degrees, gathering countless laws. He excites the hundred yang to generate lightning, operates the thousand yin to emit majesty; divine clouds envelop the Dao at the Golden Palace; the heavenly gate responds and opens of itself; commanding the eight radiances to ascend high; harnessing the Divine Tiger to rise and fly; the assembly of immortals opens the path; the seven stars hasten their movement; the mysterious light dims and lingers; myriad transformations and wondrous changes; penetrating to observe the boundless realm; surveying the utmost edges of the heavens; casting the gaze upon the five impurities; foretelling decay and life and death. How subtle it is! The marvel of spirit’s northern mystery.

The Heavenly Emperor of the Supreme Netherlight commands the Prime Minister Qing Tong Jun and the Western City King Jun: The Great Wisdom Scripture of the Upper Clarity for dispelling demons is the true scripture of the Jade Chapter of the Great Ultimate, the supreme treasured secret. The true poem of the spirit and soul, the treasured chapter of the Nine Heavens of the Great Reality. Wisdom may expel filth; dispelling demons may bind evil; the true talisman may control demons. There are jade slips with purple characters; those who obtain and cultivate the superior method will not be molested by the masses of demons, nor tested by myriad devils. It may be said that ten thousand harms cannot injure, and myriad tests cannot harm—all owing to the majesty of the Divine Tiger and the wondrous efficacy of the true scripture. Now, entrusted to you, it may be passed to later disciples who aspire to be perfected persons. They should follow the regulations of the Great Reality; within seven hundred years permit three transmissions, but do not reveal it to unworthy persons. To reveal lightly the true text is to suffer the punishment of the wind knife, and to involve the Seven Mysteries in calamity.

If there be a golden name Donghua, or green characters Upper Clarity, who obtains this talisman from me, then with thirty-six attendants of jade boys and jade maidens to attend their person, they may pass through dangers and risks, cross mountains and seas, summon gods and control ghosts, seal and govern spiritual mountains. Wherever they go, a thousand demons will prostrate themselves, ten thousand devils will bind their forms; the assembly of immortals shall attend and guard; their bodies shall shine with extraordinary light. After cultivating for not less than seven years, the true spirits shall descend to the disciple’s chamber; riding a green palanquin, ascending in broad daylight. The recipient must fast and face the altar for ninety days, or thirty days, or seventy days, all furnishing ten taels of superior gold as the proof of the divine truth, ninety feet of brocade to swear by the Nine Heavens, and thirty feet of blue silk to covenant their heart. Those who delight in the Dao and love the truth, diligently meditating on the mystery, not sparing their wealth, esteeming the Dao above riches, the Dao will surely be preserved. Such persons may be spoken with. Those who love treasures inwardly and are frivolous outwardly, the Dao will reflect upon them; they close their jade casket and add the Golden Palace; after ascending degrees, they hide deeply in the renowned mountains.

Wearing the talisman of the Divine Tiger above, with blue as the ground and yellow characters written. If the Five Great Mountains lie amid adversity and danger, in places of ghosts and demons, then one should perform the great august spell of majesty, knocking the left teeth thirty-six times in communication, reciting the spell:

“The mysterious sounds of the Nine Heavens, the hour of the ox holding harmony, commanding the hidden plan, opening the divine hundred splendours, transcending stagnation without trace; the three baskets of Luo Bo, returning the plain full of radiance; the pearls flourishing in the canopy; vermilion bright to cast fate; the pear secret and devouring the calamity; containing light to shine forth; ascending to fill the home; Bo Le riding the void; steering the celestial demons; adjusting the alternations and severing the breeds; destroying the forms of the nine networks; the tiger transforms into divine majesty; commanding and restraining myriad evils; slaughtering without measure; from great to small all perish; demons extinguished in time; calamities destroyed in great harmony; riding the radiance and steering the void, treading the flying clouds; entering and exiting the imperial court; long preserving the spiritual branch.” Complete, then swallow the breath thirty-six times and cease.

Those who do not receive the talisman of the Divine Tiger above must not lightly recite this spell. These spells are all secret names of the great demons of the Nine Heavens; one incantation startles the Nine Heavens, binds ten thousand ghosts, deprives a thousand essences of sight, and commands a hundred gods to assemble in court. To recite without receiving is to lose one’s soul and spirit. The supreme spell to destroy demons is likewise such; take heed and be cautious. Furthermore, there are dispelling demon talismans and Divine Tiger talismans in the Scripture of Dispelling Demons, all concealed sounds of the demon kings of the Nine Heavens. They should also be worn and spells recited when commanding them; to wear one is best.

On the first day of the seventh month, in the year Yichou of the third year of Xingning, the Perfected Person Tong Bai bestowed it upon Xu Yuanyou, saying that in the years Jiashen, Yihai, Renshen, and Guisi, on the first day of the ninth month, the seventh day of the seventh month, and the eighth day of the fourth month, there shall be Daoists wearing seven-coloured ceremonial robes, holding nine-curved sceptres, either at spiritual altars or among men begging alms, or chanting scriptures and poems, or singing wild songs. If you see them, diligently inquire of their Way; they will surely bestow on you the talisman of the Divine Tiger above. This is the Perfected Person of Southern Mountain, the Supreme One who at all times sends forth those below in the world to observe the hearts of those who study the Way.
