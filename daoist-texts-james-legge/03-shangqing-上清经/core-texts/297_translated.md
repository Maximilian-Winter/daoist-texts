# The Inner True Scripture of the Supreme Taoist Nine Scarlet Banfu of the Five Emperors of Dongzhen

Title of the Scripture: The Inner True Scripture of the Supreme Taoist Nine Scarlet Banfu of the Five Emperors of Dongzhen; abbreviated as the "Nine Scarlet Banfu." The author is unknown; it was roughly composed in the Eastern Jin dynasty. It is an important early classic of the Shangqing school. It consists of one scroll. The base text is found in the Zhengyi section of the "Zhengtong Daozang."

### The Inner True Scripture of the Supreme Taoist Nine Scarlet Banfu of the Five Emperors of Dongzhen

The Nine Scarlet Banfu, also called the Nine Talismans of the Feathered Forest Flying Heaven, are treasures hidden by the Primordial Heavenly King within the Golden Chamber and Jade Room of the Shangqing Yao Terrace; the divine truths shine forth, their radiance illuminating the empty expanse, supervising the four extremities, guarded by the Five Emperors. The Supreme One commands three hundred Jade Children of the Cloud Palace, and the Superior Origin commands again seven hundred Jade Maidens of the Western Flower, attending to the spiritual texts. Their divine mark is Shangqing, august and majestic in the nine heavens, controlling demons and banishing evils, severing the heads of many villains, sealing and governing named mountains, summoning the water spirits, commanding multitudes beyond count, presiding over myriad immortals, the Five Great Mountains, the Four Marshes, and the bodies of future students; they are accompanied by divine soldiers, punishing faults and rewarding merits. Every nine thousand years, one of the nine heavens opens; when the heavens open, its texts reveal the chambers of the Five Mountains, secret teachings given to those who attain the Dao. Those without immortal bones or jade names who carve these texts for future lives shall not behold their chapters. Those who possess their texts become teachers and masters of the Five Mountains, kings of the four seas. Those who serve them celebrate and prolong the souls of the Seven Ancestors, blessings flow to the nine kinds of kin, and those who cultivate them carve themselves into Shangqing High Immortals and Perfected Ones. The Nine Scarlet are the qi of the Nine Origins, flying mysterious feathers and forming jade script. The primordial culture was transmitted by the Supreme Dao Lord, the Primordial Heavenly King passed it to the Northern Pole Superior Origin Lord, the Supreme One passed it to the Fusang Great Emperor, the Great Emperor passed it to the Supreme Celestial Emperor Lord of Taiwei, the Taiwei Celestial Emperor Lord passed it to the Later Sage Golden Gate Emperor Lord, passing to the Supreme Minister Green Youth Lord, and the Northern Pole Superior Origin Lord passed it to Master Hongya and the Four Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate. The qi is transmitted one to another, all inscribed on golden slips, bound with purple scrolls, placed within brocade pouches, sealed with the marks of the Three Origins, stored within the dense treasury of Nine Bends. The Jade Immortals burn incense, Taihua holds the kerchief, four supervisors monitor and reflect, the Five Emperors guard the pavilion, the Three Origins perform the evening rites, myriad immortals pay homage to the truth; their Dao is subtle beyond reach, according to the calendar transmitted every seven thousand years. Should it be lightly divulged or revealed to improper persons, the Seven Ancestors will verify, and the body shall perish in the River Source.

Later students, diligent and earnest in thought, seek the immortal with sincerity and purity; moved by the profound virtue of the Great Void, harmonizing with the mysterious essence of the Three Origins, the meeting will naturally grant them this text. They shall receive the true talisman to wear, then may they traverse the mysterious mountains, lodge in the secluded hills, employ the Nine Scarlet to seal the mounds, command the Five Elements to summon spirits, cause the Water Emperor to cut away sins, grasp the sea spirits to open the source; thus the registers of guilt are extinguished in the Nine Palaces, the records of life inscribed in the Three Purities. The qi stirs the vast waves, commanding myriad spirits, extinguishing demons and trials, immortal officials descend in form, directing the Six Jia, controlling the heavenly soldiers, penetrating dark and subtle places, perceiving the unborn; thus they become divine immortals, flying and journeying to Shangqing.

If one study without seeing the Nine Scarlet White Feathers of the Feathered Forest Flying Heaven talismans, then the Five Mountains will not claim their mysterious names, the water spirits of the four seas will not be dispossessed by the registers of sins, nor will the Three Purities be inscribed. Wandering through rivers and marshes, hiding in secluded mountains, if one does not wear these texts, the mountain spirits and heavenly demons will test and defeat their purpose, myriad harms arise of themselves, and in the end one will not become immortal; the Water Emperor composes registers and enumerates the criminal Emperors.

The Supreme Method of Carving Names and Fixing Immortality in the Inner Contemplation of the Five Mountains

Supreme Nine Scarlet Banfu to Diminish the Mountains and Seek Immortality

Eastern Mountain Blue Emperor Inner Contemplation of the Jia-Yi Entry Wood Nine Qi Banfu

The Eastern Blue Emperor Lord, surname Chang, given name Jingmeng, wears a nine-origin heavenly crown on the head, dresses in blue brocade with a green ornamented flying skirt, wears the Supreme Nine Qi Life Spirit talisman, and bears a sash of green feathers intertwined with spiritual ribbons. He customarily, on the day of the Beginning of Spring, rides a teal rosy nine-dragon cloud chariot, accompanied by twelve Jade Maidens of the Blue Waist, holding a nine-colored flowering staff banner of the Blue Forest, wandering the Eastern Mountain Taishan, reviewing the registers of Perfected Immortals and officials, as well as the names of students; he then visits the Eastern Sea Water Emperor, calculating merits and sins in the study of the Dao, and returns to descend upon the talisman wearer’s body. The student wears the talisman to summon this spirit, preserves its qi to bring down the truth, cutting away the Water Emperor’s registers, naming the jade slips’ chapters. On the day of the Beginning of Spring, at dawn, one should bathe and fast, enter a chamber to burn incense, wear the Jia-Yi Entry Wood Nine Qi Banfu, knock the teeth nine times, and contemplate the Eastern Blue Emperor Lord, surname Chang, given name Jingmeng, in dress and form, riding the teal rosy cloud chariot, descending upon the destined chamber, the blue qi flourishing, filling the room, the crown encircling one’s form. One perceives the Emperor Lord transforming within the blue qi into the Venus star, shining brightly, descending from the crown to enter the destined body, illuminating clearly between the liver. Then one draws the qi through nine swallows, feeling the body warm; presently the red light disperses within, emerging from the nine orifices, returning to the crown above the head, transforming into blue clouds; the destined body perceives itself among the blue clouds, ascending with them. After a long time, with settled perception as if treading empty space, one reverently chants:

"Great Elixir, myriad fasts, revolving the nine gates, lifting the profound void to present the truth, the Scarlet Banner early divides, wearing armor entering wood, riding Yi to guide clouds, commanding the Five Mountains, sealing mounds and summoning mountains, reporting below to the Nine Rivers, the twelve water sources, removing old registers, arranging and presenting jade chapters, recording my true self. Lord Blue Emperor, descend upon my teal haze, flying the blue feather skirt, in union with the Emperor’s light, presenting homage at Jade Dawn."

Afterwards, again knock the teeth twelve times, swallow saliva twenty-four times and cease. If practiced for nine years, one can inscribe talismans to cast upon mountains, causing the mountains to send forth clouds and rain, thunder and darkness; casting talismans upon water causes dragons to rise upon it, able to enter abysses ten thousand fathoms deep. Like a traveller among men, inscribing talismans upon wood will not perish; the script shines brightly; bearing the talisman and embracing the wood, the body becomes forested mountains. The Eastern Mountain is guarded by twelve immortal officials. After eighteen years, one can fly to ascend Shangqing. To lightly reveal this Dao is to be punished with ghost soldiers, calamity extending to the Seven Ancestors, the body perishing in the River Source.

The Supreme Jia-Yi Entry Wood Nine Qi Banfu is inscribed in vermilion; on the day of the Beginning of Spring at dawn, facing east, wear it and recite the above method. Also on the days of Jia-Yin and Yi-Mao in the first and second months, inscribe in blue on the paulownia board, nine cun wide and one chi two cun long, bury it at the residence in Eastern Mountain, at a depth of nine feet; Jia-Yi days are unique. This method buries once every three years, not annually. But preserving thought and wearing it, following the seasons, nine years will not fail to bring response. This is also called the White Feathered Feather Forest Flying Heaven Nine Talismans, also called the Nine Changes Three Combinations into One; those who see its text share the same truth as the Five Emperors. On the day of burying the talisman, one should face east, knock the teeth thirty-six times, contemplate the blue qi cloud, cover the head with a mountain, the Eastern Mountain Taishan Lord rides a nine-colored dragon, holding a blue feather banner, accompanied by twelve immortal officials of Taishan, within the blue qi supervising the destined body, reverently chanting:

"Heaven communicates with earth, the two qi blend truth; the nine scarlet yang brightness, four degrees open and display; above opens the Five Emperors, Eastern Mountain Taishan below reports to myriad spirits; the divine without constraint removes my old faults, records this chapter of mine, extinguishes and dispels demon trials, enabling me to become immortal, sealing and awarding the spiritual mountain, rising as smoke with qi, stirring clouds and rain, flying the blue pavilion, ascending to the mysterious void, before the High Emperor."

After completion, bury the talisman according to the method, and reverently swallow thirty-six breaths of the blue qi.

The Eastern Mountain Taishan Lord customarily, on the day of the Spring Equinox, lists the names of true immortals who have attained the Dao and those just beginning to study, reporting to the High Supreme Emperor Lord to examine and verify the mysterious names. To cultivate the Dao of flying immortals, one should on this day at the appropriate hour bathe and fast, enter a chamber to burn incense, face east, and contemplate the Eastern Mountain Taishan Lord, surname Xuanqiu, given name Mulu, wearing a triple treasure nine-light night crown, dressed in blue feathered skirt, draped in nine-colored patterned fur robe, bearing the imperial command talisman, riding the blue cloud chariot on a nine-colored azure dragon, accompanied by twelve immortal officials, holding five sprigs of Ganoderma, returning northeastwards, ascending to the boundless Jade Pure Heaven, wandering within the mysterious void among the blue clouds. One should knock the teeth nine times, mentally say: "Today is the great festival, eight vows open anew; may the returning spiritual melody descend to me, accept my requests, present my petitions, obtain the supreme jade slip, the Dao Lord responds; I attain the Supreme Immortal."

Having finished, one envisions Taishan Lord descending on his chariot, blue qi flourishing, filling the chamber; the Lord is within the blue qi, holding a blue slip, inscribing my name upon the blue slip’s chapter, softly chanting:

"The Jade Truth wanders, shining brightly in the east, riding dragons and chariots, flying through the great void, the returning spiritual melody reflecting, descending to my chamber; the blue yang announces the beginning, vows open and communicate, accepting my petitions, cutting faults and recording merits, carving names on blue slips, presenting them to the High Emperor, binding the western turtle records, east flower inscribes the boundary, five spirits assist and support, eight emperors shine together, coming forth Jia commanding Yi, exiting wood entering void, six heavenly guards escort, jade maidens assist generals, controlling mountains and summoning seas, commanding and restraining dragons, roaring winds and raising clouds, none fail to bow, heavenly demons subdued and tested, myriad spirits reverently follow, transforming scenery and forms, ascending the jade palace, annually honoring Taishan, preserving eternally without end."

Then reverently swallow the nine breaths and cease. If cultivated for nine years, the Taishan Lord will appear in the destined form, descend in blue qi clouds, give to nine spirit children, bestow natural spirit Ganoderma, and know affairs of the eastern ten thousand li. After eighteen years, one obtains the dragon chariot, rides the void flying, ascending to Jade Pure Palace.

[The text continues in similar fashion for the Southern Red Emperor, Western White Emperor, Northern Black Emperor, and Central Yellow Emperor, each with their specific rites, appearances, talismans, rites for talisman burial, and instructions for cultivation and ascension.]

The Four Seas Water Emperors’ Inner Contemplation for the Removal of Sins and Deletion of Registers

Supreme Nine Scarlet Seal Sea True Banfu

Eastern Sea Water Emperor Nine Source Blue Qi Banfu

The Supreme Nine Origin Blue Qi Banfu, customarily on the days of Beginning of Spring and Spring Equinox at dawn, inscribed in vermilion on blue paper, is worn facing east. After completion, the vermilion talisman is inscribed on a paulownia board, recording year, month, day, time, county, village, mountain lord’s name, age, and birth month beneath the talisman. Placed under nine taels of blue stone, bound with blue silk, attached beneath the talisman, and cast into the east-flowing water. On the designated day, one should fast and bathe, enter a chamber to burn incense, face east, knock teeth twelve times, contemplate the Eastern Sea Water Emperor God King, surname Wang, given name Duyuan, wearing a great morning bright crown, dressed in blue pattern with emerald feather flying skirt, bearing seven-colored lion tiger head sash pouch, riding a blue chariot flying dragon, accompanied by twelve immortal envoys of the Eastern Sea Water Emperor, riding twelve azure dragons, flying to visit the High Emperor Jade Emperor, roaming among blue clouds, returning to descend upon my body, blue qi flourishing, internally and externally dark; the divine king sits facing me, cutting my death registers, annotating my immortal register, softly chanting:

"Deep abyss nine sources, ascending to Jade Pure, dividing and flowing two qi, mixing and co-producing, above commanding Supreme Truth, below supervising destined names; this day is auspicious, eight vows together; Water Emperor erases sins, records merits on high spirits, Great One stabilizes years, preserves life and peace, form intersects Nine Capitals, qi responding to divine essence, left serving heavenly armor, right mobilizing six heavenly officers, commanding mountains and summoning seas, descending chariots and dragon pavilions, guiding my flight ascent, attending court with Three Purities, feathers fluttering, golden pendants tinkling, wandering empty steps, feasting in purple court, viewing water palace below; water receives my form, causing me to endure, coeval with kalpas."

Afterwards, wear the talisman and swallow saliva nine times, then cast the talisman into the east-flowing abyss. After eighteen years, the Water Emperor erases the destined sin registers, the jade pure descends causing dragon chariots, flying through void, the body entering abysses of ten thousand fathoms, conversing with the Water Emperor. The profound and subtle Dao must not be rashly revealed.

[Similar instructions follow for the Southern Sea Water Emperor Red Qi Banfu, Western Sea Water Emperor White Qi Banfu, and Northern Sea Water Emperor Black Qi Banfu, each with their specific rites, inscriptions, burial customs, and spiritual effects.]

The Supreme Nine Scarlet Banfu are formed by binding flying mysterious purple qi into their text. The Supreme True Emperor Lords seal mountains, summon mountains, govern rivers, and command spirits. Their text is subtle and bright, descending Shangqing. The Primordial Heavenly King hid them within the Yao Terrace Golden Chamber and Jade Void. The old calendar transmits once every seven thousand years. Without golden names or jade characters, cinnabar script or mysterious platform, one must not pry or listen. Those who see their text may become Supreme Immortals. One must follow ritual, on the eight festival days, wear the talisman with rites and prayers, bury on mountains and cast into seas. Within nine years, the Five Mountain immortal officials attend the destined body, the Water Emperors and water spirits watch and greet according to direction, the Five Emperors announce names in the mysterious palace, the water officials remove and extinguish registers of sin, dragons descend and clouds cover, transformations are boundless. One must write and wear talismans in their proper colors, ascend mountains and cross rivers, myriad spirits guard the form, demons are destroyed and trials extinguished, mighty command over spirits, five clouds descend chambers, purple smoke arises spontaneously, bearing a round radiance, inner and outer brightness, eight scenes in harmony, Three Origins descend pavilions, flying through mysterious void, ascending Jade Pure.

Those possessing golden names and jade bones, treasures of Shangqing, who obtain these talismans and wear them for three years, will become Perfected of the Five Mountains, traversing rivers and seas, becoming kings of the four seas, with the assistance of the Five Emperors and myriad spirits reverently greeting. If cultivated for nine years, one may walk on water ten thousand fathoms deep, control dragons, enter mountains to study; then the Five Emperors and Five Mountains appear in form and speak together, stirring clouds and rain, summoning dragon smoke, transformations myriad, responses manifest. If cultivated for eighteen years, one flies and ascends Shangqing. The way is subtle and profound, not to be spread abroad; to lightly reveal the spiritual texts will incur the responsibility of the Seven Ancestors, the body perishing, long filling ghost officials. Disciples receiving it must fast thirty days, or seven days, present three taels of superior gold, fifty chi each of five-colored brocade, forty chi of brocade, one jin of incense, go to the mountain of the Five Mountains, report to the Five Emperors, shut the Five Spirits, Three Rivers, Four Seas Heavenly Officials, Earth Officials, Water Officials, according to the Four Extremities’ covenant, then transmit. Those receiving without linking to the heavenly spirits, serving Jade Children and Jade Maidens, listing to the High Supreme, will be punished by the Five Emperor divine soldiers. Lightly revealing it will be punished by the Nine Ancestors, their body extinguished. Receiving but not covenanted will bring calamity to the Seven Ancestors, the body afflicted by wind and fire, naturally losing the scripture. Therefore the Superior Origin Lord reported to the Five Emperors: "The scripture without covenant will not be revealed; receiving without linking loses the truth; both bear the responsibility of life and death." Students should follow the text and serve it. The Dao is not without descent, the immortal not without completion, life and death enjoy their blessings, blessings flow to the kinds of kin, the spiritual texts are of utmost importance; this is the utmost truth of the Way.
