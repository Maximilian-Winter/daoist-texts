### Scroll One of the Supreme Taoist Scripture of the True Cavern, the Great Expanse, and the Luminous Records

Composed by Lady Ziwei, the Chapter of the Jade Text Emperor

The Cloud Service Master is the scion of the Primordial Emperor of Jade Emptiness, the middle son of the Supreme Emperor. He bears the jade embryo in the jade chamber, condenses cloud essence at the golden gate, contains sun and moon in the purple membrane, transmutes vast dew to concentrate spirit, refines embryonic breath to promote movement, endures kalpas to turn the wheel, manifests within the Yuan clan, informs the Yang path to achieve truth. Thus, in the first year of the Supreme Emperor, on the first day of the third month, when heaven’s radiance opens the dawn, he is born above the nine mysteries, in the immeasurable heavenly treasure radiance, beholding the sun on the cloud cliff, shining the golden visage in the jade pavilion, conforming to the imperial foundation in the emperor’s chart, following the jade elegance of nature, washed by the nine spirits’ brilliance, irrigated by sweet fragrant jade springs, drinking the spirit consort’s imperial ganoderma, nursed by the nine refined flying frosts. The divine dragon wings his side, the jade phoenix shades his crown, purple smoke births the son above, flowing light luxuriates the neighbour, the two symbols uphold his thread, three mornings harmonize his truth, the divine land sings his marvel, seven transformations alter his spirit, the spirit wind speeds his body, revolving fragrance stirs his dust, the clear void above whistles softly, the gentle waves lap the shore. At the age of twenty-nine, contemplating subtlety and mystery, adapting nature’s principle, following the time’s changes, disdaining the imperial way, roaming untroubled the Central Plain, entertaining in the Great Expanse, wandering the purple heavens, casting glances across kalpas, finding delight in forgetting cycles, moving not by his own decree, standing forth as an immortal. Thus named the Scripture Emperor’s Tablet, rank ascended to Supreme Truth, teaching below in the Three Origins, conferred the royal scroll, receiving appointment at that time, attending the jade heaven court, ascending the platform of the nine mysteries, the palace of vast possession, the purple phoenix jade capital, the seven treasures vermilion chambers, in the hall of bright clouds, pure fasting jade pavilion, spiritual sincerity reports response, neck bearing round light, night illuminating divine candles, self-illuminating jade hall. Then the Void Emperor Tao Lord, above the empty cavern, within profound emptiness, by the chapter of the Great Expanse Luminous Records, the Jade Text Emperor Chapter, descended and bestowed upon the sovereign. At that time, heavenly light darkened and spread, three mornings returned essence, five constellations changed their degrees, seven origins moved spirit, nine colors flashed and shone, sparkling jade clarity, flying smoke thick and luxuriant, flowing through the eight abysses, ascending jade steps, myriad emperors gathered in the court, flying immortals with feathered canopies, assisting the Supreme Truth, immortal boys and jade maidens, each commanding a thousand, holding handkerchiefs scattering incense, spreading fragrance to sweep dust. Then the mandate was issued, summoning the five spirits, flying in the expanse turning the wheel, riding the empty woven smoke, divine phoenix reins pulled taut, spirit consort guiding immortals, the luminous emperor opening the path, three ways combined in brightness, flowing lightning raising essence, swift carriage through the nine mysteries, roaming the jade gates, feasting in the three origins, circling the jade expanse, wandering the purple dawn. Thus unfolding the Luminous Records in the boundless, reciting the emperor’s chapter in the blue clouds, regulating the ancestral roots in the jade formula, commanding the awe of spirits in the jade text, chanting wondrous melodies in the empty cavern, concentrating stillness in the jade pavilion, governing the two principles in the mysterious chart, managing the emperor’s record among myriad immortals, commanding the earth’s bureaus at the five sacred mountains, leading the Supreme Truth through the three barriers, governing the boundlessness above, embracing the cavern’s source below, from heaven downwards, none but submit to the Supreme Truth. The spirit is unfathomable, transformation beyond naming, near things hard to discuss, distant things impossible to seek, clarity hard to soil, confusion hard to clarify, subtle and wondrous indeed, this is the imperial spirit of utmost virtue, lofty and exalted.

The Great Expanse Luminous Records are the melodies of the Nine Heavens Kings flying in the expanse; the Jade Text Emperor Chapter is the writing above the Nine Heavens. Together with the Primordial Beginning, born in the natural void, the Void Emperor Jade Emperor received it at the nine mysteries. The heavenly kings accordingly inscribed names, cast gold into tablets, carved jade into chapters, gold threads and jade characters to manifest precious script. Secreted above the Nine Heavens, in the palace of vast possession, the western flower jade maidens and golden dawn jade boys, three thousand each, attend and guard incense. Thus the nine emperors, the supreme sages, each month on the first, fifteenth and thirtieth day ascend the jade steps thrice, attend the divine truth feast, cycling through myriad kalpas, passing to the Supreme Truth King. Their way is lofty and subtle, the head of all scriptures, spirits outstanding and elegant, essence crowning the Nine Heavens, jade kindness clear and bright, entry into the mystery, none but the highest truth men may partake and hear, all given to perfect immortals, not transmitted to mid-level immortals. The Great Expanse Luminous Records are the melodies of the Nine Heavens Kings flying in the expanse; the Jade Text Emperor Chapter is the way of high spiritual mystery reflected; the essence of the Nine Heavens, overseeing myriad breaths, governing myriad scriptures. Whoever cultivates the "Great Cavern Thirty-nine Chapters," circulating wind and blending with the one emperor’s way, the "Female One Jade Inspection Five Elders Precious Scripture," explaining ancestral roots, extracting degrees through the seven mysteries, without this text, the Nine Heavens Kings do not accept its sound, the nine breaths entangle, divine truth is displeased, heavenly demons invade the vision, myriad tests come to interfere, thought does not penetrate subtlety, heaven does not open the barrier. Whoever cultivates many scriptures begins with the Jade Text, chanting in the silent chamber, peacefully celebrating the rosy court, smoothly clearing the nine heavens, arranging the highest mystery, causing the jade palace to be startled in hearing, myriad truths attending the pavilion, demon clusters subdued, myriad tests dare not advance; according to intention cultivated, then attaining the true way, ten thousand times the way complete, soaring into the great clarity. The essential formula is not complicated, it lies in this scripture, with attentive spirit and arduous practice, one may overcome the superior immortals.

The Cloud Service Master did not cultivate other ways, but received from the Void Emperor Tao Lord the "Great Expanse Luminous Records Jade Text Emperor Chapter," singing the wondrous chapters above the nine heavens, wandering and enjoying, inspiring and expressing divine truth, bringing down teaching to the three origins, one rank ascending to the Supreme Truth King. Transmitted to the Great Hua Perfected, the Three Heavenly Longevity Lords, the Great Harmony Perfected, Eastern Hua Laozi, Southern Pole Supreme Banishing Lord, Western Terrace Middle Marquis, Northern Emperor Middle Truth, Nine Spirit Princes, Great Spirit True Concubine, Red Essence Jade Boy, Mysterious Valley Master, Southern Mountain Red Pine, Zhongshan King Qiao, Purple Sun Perfected, Western City King Lord, Central Emperor Master, Zhao Bo Xuan, Mountain Ancestor Sect, and others eighteen persons, all cultivating this way, their faces radiant with golden visage, neck bearing round light, riding the void ascending the expanse, roaming the purple court, transforming myriad directions, roaming freely, roaring commands, summoning myriad spirits, controlling demon clusters, deciding life and death, riding the expanse and smoke, entering and leaving the emperor’s court, all by the Jade Text to reach the Supreme Truth. The King Lord now resides in Xicheng Mountain, lodging with the golden-named Emperor’s Tablet, green characters purple clarity, genuine persons shall obtain this text. Those who obtain it, keep it as a precious secret, do not rashly transmit it; if the spiritual chapters leak, the nine ancestors are held accountable, filling the ghost official’s responsibility, locked long in hell, unrelenting through myriad kalpas.

The Nine Heavens Nine Kings are the root and source of myriad breaths, the ancestors of the many emperors, the essential origin of the nine breaths. When heaven and earth were yet uncondensed, the three lights not yet bright, they combined with nature and were born within the void, within the murky abyss, enduring ninety thousand kalpas before branching and governing each breath, establishing the nine heavens, whence the sun, moon, and stars shine, myriad breaths flow and evolve, forming the Way Truth. The Primordial Supreme Emperor and the High Supreme Jade Emptiness were born at the beginning of heaven; the thirty-nine emperors and twenty-four truths thus established palace and official order. The Supreme Emperor’s treasured scriptures all combine natural chapters for practice. The way of longevity, the method of immortality, talismans and jade formulas all arise from the kings of the nine heavens, transmitted through generations of the true. At the change of three and five eras, the nine spirits respond in due time; later sages of the nine mysteries Tao Lords, verifying the original source, spanning ninety-nine trillion nine thousand kalpas, the Supreme Emperor’s canon often does not concur. The Tao Lords on the first year of the central emperor in the ninth month, on the first day, at the jade heaven jade chamber golden palace, ordered the Eastern Flower Azure Palace to seek the rules of rise and fall, to collate and verify ancient scripts, revise and compose spiritual chapters, collected into three hundred precious scriptures, entrusted to the highest official Azure Youth Lord to transmit to later students named to harmonize truth. Those who learn and seek immortality but do not know the origin of the Way, nor the birth of precious formulas, cast about blindly learning without ancestral foundation, the truth will not descend, nor the way prevail. Those who desire immortality must seek the root of the nine heavens, obtain its original essence, the way is complete and immortality assured. But the secret taboo names of the nine heavens kings are hidden above the nine heavens in the palace of vast possession, not transmitted to the lower world. There is the mysterious named Emperor’s Chart, golden characters of Supreme Clarity, regulating fortune and meeting, obtaining knowledge of the nine heavens king’s names; the kings then dispatch twelve jade boys and nine jade maidens to attend and guard the destined body. Following the prescribed fasting for ninety days or nine days, bearing nine taels of upper gold, and ninety feet of purple patterns, swearing the nine heavens’ trust, then the master teaches and swears to transmit. One must not rashly reveal this spiritual text, lest the seven ancestors be tested, condemned to serve ghost officials, enduring fire mountain long imprisonment, bearing stone labour, the body perishing in the three officials’ offices, never attaining immortality.

Right Jade Text Emperor Chapter two hundred forty sounds, all the essence of the Nine Heavens, names of myriad truths. When carving the text on jujube wood, receiving it from the pure spring of the precipice, applying to the flying gauze veil, facing north swearing to the Nine Heavens, receiving the chapters of the Nine Heavens. Disciples carry nine taels of upper gold, ninety feet of purple patterns, facing south prostrate, master reads the jade text and grants to disciples. If not yet obtaining carved seals, one may write in orpiment the blue-green supreme, swear and grant, then may slowly re-carve the text, ascending the mountain to swear to the Nine Heavens.

If carving the jade text upon jujube wood, the seal must not be suspended facing the four directions, but kept in a jade box in a separate chamber, properly oriented upwards, morning and evening burn incense and worship the kings of the Nine Heavens. To summon the Eastern Mountain Immortal officials for auspicious or inauspicious signs, communicating spirit and truth, use the Jia and Yi days, read the emperor chapter once facing east, then the immortal officials arrive and converse with the truth. To summon the Southern Mountain officials, use Bing and Ding days, as above; to summon the Western Mountain officials, use Geng and Xin days; to summon the Northern Mountain officials, use Ren and Gui days; to summon the Central Mountain officials, use Wu and Ji days, following the same method. All methods of summoning the five mountains face the proper direction, knocking teeth thirty-six penetrations, then reciting the emperor chapter. With attentive fasting and purity, the spirit cannot fail to descend. If one is practicing amid noise and filth, not yet penetrating the mystery’s darkness, close eyes and concentrate deeply; no spirit will fail to appear. One shall investigate the depths and darkness, know the auspicious and inauspicious signs, and after nine years be of the same form as the truth, exiting the void entering the boundless, roaming and feasting the jade morning. Those who cultivate the way thoroughly have perfect immortals descending, cloud chariots and purple canopies come to welcome the destined body. One should imprint the emperor chapter’s seal upon the soles of both feet and both palms, immediately forming wings, moving the destiny with ascent. If in the secret quiet places of the five mountains one cultivates and chants, and strange beings feign true forms to descend to the destined chamber, one should imprint the emperor chapter’s seal toward them, then truth and falsehood become manifest. If truly immortal officials, the destined shall bow and welcome, follow wishes to present petitions, gaining essential words; if demonic spirits, they revert to their true forms. The destined shall knock teeth thirty-six penetrations, recite the emperor chapter once, and the demon is extinguished and loses form before the destined. Such method requires heart and mouth in accord; guard against showing it to others. Revealing it causes the way not to prosper. When alone at night, place the emperor chapter upon the heart, and the Great Expanse true immortals come to guard, the destined form responding to dreams, conversing with the truth, within nine years one will meet the immortal face to face. Whoever receives the emperor chapter’s seal must not rashly expose it to others; seeing three persons the way departs, usage fails. Whoever cultivates this way must not lightly tread amid noise and filth, offending the true spirits, violating the Nine Heavens’ tests, seizing the destined body. If possessing the mysterious chart emperor’s tablet, green characters purple writing, golden bones and jade marrow, named writing in the Azure Palace, the Nine Heavens shall send the four extremities true immortals to bestow the destined body the jade text emperor chapter. If having prior affinity, meeting a bright master, all are spiritual and eminent, should obtain this text, and attain superior immortality. All must with genuine gold thread trust visit the master fasting purely, receive and cultivate. Without trust and alliance, heaven does not open spirits, truth does not descend, immortality cannot be achieved. The master teaches that revealing lightly causes the seven ancestors to be tested, condemned to serve ghost officials; take care with the mysterious law, do not reveal rashly.

Whoever transmits the "Great Expanse Luminous Records Jade Text Emperor Chapter" should in the high supreme empty stillness spread the flying gauze veil facing north, place incense cakes, jujubes and fruits upon separate plates, place the scripture upon the flying gauze. The master faces north, knocks teeth thirty-six penetrations, respectfully petitions the Nine Spirits Primordial Truth, the mysterious beginning supreme official, the golden immortal jade maiden, Supreme One spirit, supervising true envoys, five emperors myriad truths, now there is certain mountain gentleman Wang Jia, purple netted membrane, fated immortal, bearing golden thread trust, seeking to receive the spiritual text, Nine Heavens true taboo jade text emperor chapter, heaven’s law caution, sworn treasure truth, wishing to transmit divine light, mysterious reflection ministers, should there be a day of leakage, returning to river source, seven ancestors confessing guilt, not daring again to be immortal. Finished, holding the scripture in hand to give disciples. Then bury cakes and fruits in the mysterious mountain, not for other use. This is the secret essence of the Nine Heavens Kings, the mysterious formula of the Supreme Truth; scholars without this text labor in the empty mountains, without response in the silent court. Diligent, earnest, thoughtful of the nine mysteries, the heaven kings are pleased, dispatching jade boys and jade maidens to attend the destined body, within nine years one may ride flying jade and ascend to the nine heavens.

The three codes are difficult to seek; by these essentials.

All three vehicles’ usage are similar in general, but differ in minor details; the mind’s work results in major differences and minor similarities. Only those who penetrate the mystery can distinguish them; those rushing to practice, the three codes are essential. The essential usage method is to measure oneself carefully; what one cannot bear, do not force; what others are not ready for, do not hard press. Persuasion or coercion have corresponding punishments and disasters; forcing causes dismissal and withdrawal tests. Refine the body with attentive heart, change evil to good, test oneself and others, abide by wondrous formulas, dwell and rest with proper robes, offer and report, participate and receive, transmit and give, only letting it fit perfectly, not failing the hidden and manifest spirits and ghosts, not failing the mind and body’s capability, not lax to oneself, not burdening others, not violating masters and friends, not disgracing the true Way, not fearing slander and envy, not ashamed before kin or strangers, not doubting near or far, not confused by rank and lowliness, not ashamed of faith and vows, not neglecting ancient sages. Sages and saints must fast; demons and evil must be subdued. Among the three vehicles’ people, some are superior and some inferior.

The Second of the Four Extremities Bright Code Precepts and Formulas

The preface says: One who has golden name obtains the Four Extremities, observes regulations and follows precepts; the four realms’ officers receive, sever yin and yang, avoid mingling with the vulgar; the defilements of life and death, offending true spirits, eating the five pungent items, qi rushing to stomach, damaging essence and losing spirit, naked in three lights, slighting the jade morning, collecting their own punishment, disaster destroying destined body. One must not rashly discuss scriptures and texts with worldly learners, comment on ancient mysteries, understand the ultimate truth, propagate improper doctrines, leak the origin of the Way, rashly show to the world, bringing disaster upon the seven ancestors.

The Eight Sections, Life’s Fate, pure fasting burning incense, repenting before the emperor lord, extracting sins of the nine yin, dispersing the seven mysteries. At beginning of spring and spring equinox, burn nine lamps in the central court; beginning of summer and summer solstice, burn three lamps; beginning of autumn and autumn equinox, burn seven lamps; beginning of winter and winter solstice, burn five lamps; life’s fate twelve lamps. At midnight light lamps facing the kings, life’s fate facing the year lord, knocking teeth twenty-four penetrations, whispering incantation:

High Supreme True, myriad holy emperors, five emperor jade officials, all immortals supervising truth, today auspicious and good, eight sections life’s fate, presenting yang sins and yin trials, eliminating the nine yin, thus far, extracting the seven mysteries, escaping the fiery village, forever leaving the knife mountain, three roads five sufferings, not burdening my body, attaining the same as heaven and earth, long preserving the emperor morning, five wishes eight gatherings, none not fulfilled. Finished, remove headgear bow head one hundred and twenty times, forehead touching the ground, do not cause pain. Finished, restore headgear, face heaven with mind: Today my body receives the heavenly grace, returning form and bones to receive life and fly as immortal. Finished, knocking throat twenty-four qi stops. Thus for three years, past faults all removed, body and truth united, not treading the five sufferings, escaping the fiery village, capable of attaining immortal roaming destined chambers.

The Upper Palace Code says: Whoever receives Supreme Clarity must not add or subtract heavenly writings, damage Taoist scriptures, erase or smudge characters, neglect spiritual writings. Three violations cause loss of merit and ten years’ cessation, then fasting purely, first repentance, then may resume cultivation; five violations held by left officials, seven ancestors and self join knife mountain. Receiving scriptures and copying one set, all offerings placed in separate chambers, bed five feet five inches high, according to the numbers of heaven and earth, length four feet nine inches, corresponding to the names of four seasons. Thus scriptures have the names of four seasons. Morning and evening burn incense, worship before scriptures to entreat the divine spirits. One must not allow profane vulgar persons to defile, tread filth, enter chamber or touch prohibitions. Receiving scripture must fast purely, separate chamber burning incense, not mingling with mundane affairs, pure paper and brush. Facing east begin scripture, when beginning scripture, must not orally chant chapters. All must compare characters three times; if not relying on ancient classics, words or phrases omitted, all counted as ten decades lost. Failing to follow is investigated by right officials, seeing worldly manners as knives, seeking death yet unable to cross. One must not divulge Supreme One Emperor Lord’s name to unlearned persons. Facing north afterwards the same.

Lower Palace Code says: Whoever has supreme scripture, all are bone and form combined immortal, must abandon family and wives, roam the five mountains, long fast in mountain forests, think and meditate diligently, eat properly and simply, drink plain water from gourds, not laboring in cold and hardship, morning and evening without laziness, then the emperor lord jade officials on the right side of the three origins will visit the chamber, three years’ plan ascending the great clarity. If one is lax, defiling spiritual writings, propagating and leaking, causing the world to hear and see, breaking the oath and vow, disaster follows the seven mysteries and oneself, knife mountain fiery duty, bearing stone labour filling the night river, receiving supreme clarity scriptures, or by fate meeting, unable to abandon home and enter mountains, thus residing in the world, mind revering and respecting, aspiration for mystery and spirit, preparing one set, separate chamber offerings, morning and evening burning incense, entering and leaving worshipping, as serving lord and father, matters petitioned, none disobeyed, heaven dispatches jade boys and jade maidens to attend this scripture, observing one’s heart. Returning affectionately to reverence, spirit spontaneously responds truth, as wished fulfilling desires, averting disaster and expelling affliction, myriad demons subdued, thousand spirits losing form, riches and honour auspicious, official rank rising, seeking the Way and attaining the Way, seeking office and obtaining office, descendants flourishing, gold and treasures like woods, seven years according to the method, a true immortal shall descend to the destined chamber, communicating with spirit, imparting essential words, no learning needed, no labor but immortal. Thus superior men learn the Way, dwelling in the three movements. If met but not received, also fate; received but no faith, then their fate; faith but no treasure, truly their fault. When all three are complete, the seven mysteries are tested, oneself suffers, left and right two officials punish with wind knives, three roads five sufferings, nine calamities eight hardships, myriad kalpas born not human’s way.

Independent Bright Code Essentials Third

Right Palace Code says: High Supreme True Jade Emperor Lord, Jade Clarity Perfected, myriad immortals and saints, attained Way spiritual persons all wear Supreme True Bright Code. All scholars who receive Nine Truth Bright Code, Supreme Great Tao Lord receive Four Extremities Bright Code, this is the Four Bright Supreme Saint Jade Formulas.

Cultivating Supreme Clarity Tao Scripture, on the day of entering the chamber, wear deerskin cap and veil, or hemp veil, purple sash and blue wrap; the veil is four feet nine inches wide, five feet five inches long, sash twenty-four bars, wrap fifteen bars, collar and belt matching purple; also may wear the mysterious crown. Women of Supreme Cavern are all lady lords, purple gauze brown, two zhang four feet long, divided into thirty-six stripes, twenty-three on the body; blue gauze skirt, forty-five feet, eight widths, each width four feet nine inches, totalling thirty-two bars, remaining used as skirt belt. Males and females both have twelve jade boys and jade maidens, managing ritual robes. Upon entering chamber, outside knock teeth thrice, eyes closed, store the purple cloud qi of the chamber to crown the body, jade boys attend left, jade maidens right, golden light precious fungi, clarity inside and out; incantation:

Heaven bright breath clear, three lights cavern clear, golden chambers winding rooms, five fungi treasures born, mysterious cloud purple canopy, come to illuminate my form, jade boys and jade maidens, bring me spirit, nine emperors together radiate, three origins same carriage, obtain flying canopy, ascend the purple court. Finished, draw breath through thirty-nine throat passages, then enter chamber to worship and act. Separate yellow court has another formula.

Upon entering chamber recite scriptures, five emperors bind belts, four bureaus accompany positions, must not linger beside the scriptures or stay on tone, nor talk with outsiders, skipping a sentence costs a hundred words, up to five sentences deducts five hundred words, upon missing a sentence recite a chapter. Eyes fixed on scriptures, mind thinking of divine truth, no other thoughts to disturb heavenly sounds. Under one thousand words no drinking allowed; above one thousand up to five thousand words allow one drink; ten thousand words two drinks; above ten thousand three drinks; no reckless eating or drinking. When exhausted, rest and remain silent; after finishing reciting a chapter, no overnight scripture study. Males and females may study together in same chamber but on separate beds facing north, men east, women west, not sitting, rising, or resting mixed on same mat. First apply golden true demon-subduing talisman, then recite the thirty-nine chapters. Sit on square mat, sweep and cleanse inside and out, always maintain purity, burn incense and bright lamps, cut off outside causes, ritual implements neat and wrapped, must not borrow from others.

Central Palace Code says: There is a jade name Azure Palace, receiving thirty-one scrolls, unable to sever ties and abandon worldly affairs, or mountain provisions insufficient, may also cultivate in the world, offerings morning and evening, worship as serving lord and father. Couples paired may also cultivate seven scriptures’ Way, supreme emperor radiance and lady lords’ descendants all descend. Those with the Way form pairs in radiance by qi matching, also enduring fate accordingly. Offerings to masters and ancestors as serving divine spirits, entering chamber burning incense, first preserving the master’s whereabouts, mind worships before master, then acting. No elaborate or false speech, no deception of fellow disciples, no inducing stealing scriptures, no slandering master lords, no fabricating without cause, no revealing precious formulas to unallied.

Whoever has golden name obtains treasure scriptures, according to code swears transmission, carefully judging persons. After transmission, disciples bear responsibility for violations, sin affecting master’s body. Male and female disciples jointly serve master and ancestors, entering chamber fasting, following learning depth and seniority order, same virtue precedes order, then by age. Highest virtue and talent as chief ritual master. No contention or mutual pushing or disrespect. Sharing master’s alliance, with harmonious minds and manners, qi resonance mutual, body and conduct united, gestures alike, all ensuring each attains true way, all receive master’s path, ascending to heaven by day. No attacking or disputing, no strife or quarrels, slander or baseless accusations. Once master alliance is united, expressions not joyful, then one may claim self, contesting for immortality, thus causing guilt and enmity, becoming foes, investigated by four bureaus, no further immortality.

Whoever receives Supreme Clarity, on eight-section days sends two golden rings, ninety feet of blue silk, to present to master. Master receiving this trust records disciple’s name, province, prefecture, county, township, year, month, in middle of the ninety-foot blue silk, beside the mysterious mountain peak, facing north reporting to Azure Palace, knocking teeth twenty-four penetrations, whispering incantation:

Heaven returns breath shoots, eight ways move essence, three five respond period, nine blessings replace decline, original truth mysterious quiet, assisting minister imperial spirit, jade tablet already sealed, now reporting azure name, respectfully word to nine offices, five mountains spirit officials, record what I list, upper hearing jade clarity, after three years come to welcome certain form, grant riding eight scenes, ascend emperor court.

Finished, bury blue silk beneath the precipice. Thus for three years, true descent. Without reporting this name, Azure Palace will not record, four bureaus investigate, same as theft crime. If master first transforms or is far apart, must not send rings, can perform on own, but sending rings to master, not sending one section, cannot again be immortal.

Whoever cultivates the Way, open heart and quiet mind, silent watchfulness of truth, entering and exiting with remembrance, only the Way as body, pure fasting carrying code, counting days to become immortal. Must not harbor anger or wrath, binding breath with vexation, cursing and swearing, invoking ghosts and spirits, touching heavenly laws, receiving extended investigation officers. Should think of ten heavenly locusts flying and stirring, born and unborn, all attaining true way, accomplishing without precedence, wishing heaven universally exalt, work complete virtue achieved, counting days to become immortal. Must not harbor rebellious mind, hand harming living, envy others’ superiority, wishing others downfall, acting without good, taking evil as foremost; this prohibition especially severe, investigated by right officers. Should think of the five viscera and six bowels purified, inner calm and external cinnabar, all refined essence, precious flowers binding, spirit elegance clear and bright, no drinking wine to drunkenness, overflow overturning, five gods of viscera flying in alarm, wish mind not firm, deeds fail, inner heat attacks, counting days decaying. Such study is futile. Must always bathe and wash urgently, shoes and clothes not to be defiled, true spirits stay far, evil riding is removed. Must not rashly enter filthy places, crying and sorrowful tears, mourning death, entering and leaving three lights, dark eyes lying resting, must not expose knots, remove clothes bare form, disparage body and spirit, shame true writings, true spirits depart, empty corpse left alone. Must not cohabit with yin families, or sit with strangers wearing clothes, or share bedding and resting, shoes and clothes crossing. Must not face north toward life fate, nor two places of defilement, offending jade morning, defiling and slighting original truth. Practicing imperial splendor Way, on lunar eclipse and new moon gatherings, all heavenly breath attacks and fights, two symbols battle; according to purple book formula, guard and rescue.

Without practicing this method, one may not cultivate sun and moon methods.

Whoever receives the supreme scripture must first fast, swear alliance, and transmit. Without receiving the alliance, must report fasting and begin scripture; upon finishing scripture, then swear and transmit. Without alliance and handing over, master and recipient alike are investigated by left and right officers, harshly forbidden. In the last ages, seekers of the Way are few, three heavens hastening their course, requiring worthy to assist and correct. If one has bones divided, receive the scripture according to Supreme Three Heavens Zhengyi method. Before seven years of scripture reception are complete, the azure register jade name mysterious pattern is not fixed, one must not hastily become master. Supreme always dispatches three official bureaus, four parts supervisors, circulating the world; if one violates by receiving scripture and leaking it, they descend to female azure, seize their seven ancestors, consign to fire village hot cauldron, scorched soul, then tread knife mountain for myriad kalpas, returning to bear stone labor, self and lightly receiving persons all fill wind knife and world investigation, seeking death but unable, seized then charged with knife mountain and fire village, twenty-four prisons, three roads five sufferings myriad kalpas, still bearing stone labor.

Before the term is complete, if meeting jade store matching immortals requesting this scripture, should be guided by former wise dharmic body, must not block seeker’s way by withholding previous transmission. If persuading to transmit to three harmonizing persons, their merit moves heaven, the jade emperor right bureau reports to four bureaus, cutting their sin names. Receiving scripture complete with trust, trust sworn with oath, approved by hair pulling and blood drinking oath. Without trust receiving scripture is called violating heavenly Way; without alliance transmitting scripture is called leaking heavenly treasure. Those transmitting and receiving must each guard their burden. Receiving disciples’ trust, dividing into three parts, one rescues mountain hermits to relieve poverty, one supplies ritual robes, one establishes merit for disciples’ seven ancestors, incense and ointments and the like. With trust and visit master, before fulfilling quota, receiving later years and numbers, must not take trust for self, must send to immortal master to complete prior quota, then may receive three divisions. Receiving trust but not dividing, accumulating and managing for others, poor persons have no infinite rescue benefit, seven mysteries parents have no power to remove sins, self has no imperial robes, harming deity and violating law, thrice violating cannot again be immortal.

Wearing talismans and carrying codes, all in quietness as task, must not roam assemblies or mingle with vulgar people, quarrels and disputes, enmity and anger, mutual hatred, pointing to heaven and earth, offending deities and breaking laws. On eight sections, year lord, life fate days, wear supreme true spirit talismans fifteen heads, to remove lingering knots and sins, eliminate wind knives, water and fire tests, transcend eight hardships, nine years descend truth. Without complete great scripture, may also singly guard this talisman, separately receive alliance and trust, upper gold two taels, purple pattern forty feet, report fasting and transmit. Receiving talisman each on their day, enter chamber burning incense, facing east knocking teeth twenty-four penetrations, incantation:

High Spirit Jade True, Supreme Nine Mysteries, jade writing firm soul, preserve form guard spirit, three refinements nine trials, my Way is natural, transcending Yandu, forever leaving knife mountain, three roads five sufferings, not binding my body, report above to jade officials, note my true name, azure register purple tablet, Way attainment chapter, three origins together shine, nine emperors same carriage, obtaining plan purple cloud, ascending to Dipper and Star, blessing flowing to seven ancestors, together obtaining superior immortality. Finished, wear talisman swallow saliva twenty-four times, according to method three years, roots of disaster dispersed, able to self immortal.

Whoever receives Supreme Clarity but sees no bright code, will never succeed. Those who desire to learn, bright code is first; see the code and learn, effortless attainment. Spread incense and flames respectfully, repent whenever offending, bright lamps in courtyard, swallow true talisman, eliminate sins preserve form, jade emperor fully moved, right bureau observing feelings, no sin notes, mysterious capital no penalty name, heaven sends boys to attend destined body, Supreme Micro crown on seven ancestors, Southern Palace reversing form to further immortals, Supreme True mysterious Way, diligently practice.

Whoever has Four Extremities Bright Code body, four bureaus five emperors list destined names, report to Azure Palace, high saint supreme emperor, thirty-six spiritual jade boys, twenty-four western flower jade maidens, serving and guarding destined body, averting disaster removing evil, eliminating sins removing afflictions, correcting faults rewarding merits, communicating spirit and truth. The destined shall burn incense, worship morning and evening, thrice recite code monthly, always prepared, not lightly neglect or defile spiritual writings, rashly discussing spiritual writings with three persons, body dies form remains, seven ancestors filling knife mountain fire cycle. Precious scriptures to be practiced seven hundred years, if encountering proper persons, receive the code and exchange five-coloured brocade each ninety feet, phoenix pattern gauze forty feet, golden dragons and jade fish each one, jade tablets one foot two inches long. Recorded text as follows:

Certain year, year lord certain month, new moon certain day and hour, certain province prefecture county township, male and female officials Taoists certain mountain gentleman name, age as heavenly stem and earthly branch years, birth month day and hour, fate belongs to certain mountain certain emperor lord, respectfully at mysterious mountain high mountain rock or certain chamber lodge, swear to Nine Heavens, upper receive Four Extremities Bright Code, serve true Way, request to register purple tablet, state name Azure Palace. Violating alliance and breaking oath, dare not hope for immortality.

Master faces north, knocks teeth twenty-four penetrations, petitions high spirit mysterious void Nine Heavens great kings, bright emperor jade emperor, thirty-nine truths, high saint mysterious, myriad immortals Tao Lords, supervising spirit messengers, attending immortals jade attendants, four bureaus five emperors, leading true supervising immortals. Now there is a superior Taoist named certain mountain gentleman, male and female names, cultivating great law, receiving precious scriptures, all as certain scrolls. Sinking in the last vulgar, unable to ascend, striving mysterious and lofty, public and private crowded and distressed, aspiring to supreme truth, all longing for true Way, though no great teacher, few attain. Some few or many, independent minor officials, hidden and manifest various. According to certain received, because green not prepared, order confused, main scroll separate, text erroneous, formulas uneven, years accumulated, cultivation no effect, also due to faint roots, now merit not great, though receiving names and titles, not seeing text or diagrams, or obtaining text and diagrams but no essential formulas, or inquiry with no resources, or report mysterious not understood, not able to concentrate nor to study broadly, only wasting time, hoping for effect at silence end, day and night worried and ashamed, increasing vexation. Now seeking to receive again, writing this text, following order practicing, forever the body’s treasure, mind words daily, principle can be proud. We of mundane lower, quality distant from high, mistakenly with ant knowledge, arrogantly grasping dragon phoenix chapters, presumptuously drawing honor, influenced by great vehicle law, recording transmission of mysteries, meeting master bowing respectfully, before and after obtaining inner and outer essentials, true words wondrous principle, deathless method, spirit talisman precious diagrams, longevity techniques, chapters and formulas, ancient and modern nearly complete. Universal aid without end, gladly receiving immeasurable, but matters heavy and body
