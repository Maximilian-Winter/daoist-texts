The Supreme Clarity, besides the writings of the Six Heavens and the Correct Methods of the Three Heavens, was compiled by the order of the Holy Lord of Dongling by the Heavenly King of Little Existence of the Clear Void. It is a secret register of the perfected immortals, collectively named the Writings of the Six Heavens and the True Correct Methods of the Three Heavens of Supreme Clarity, to capture myriad ghosts and restrain the host of evils. For seven hundred years it was transmitted thrice, and once in a hundred years a perfect person re-bestows it. All observe fasting three days, or seven days. Moreover, within the fast, they present to the master of the scripture ten taels of fine gold, as a token of faith to communicate with the spirits. Those in the world who do not follow these rules will suffer punishment for seven generations, according to the penal laws of the Four Extremities. To wear the register is not to suffer the noxious vapours and filth of the nether world; should one suffer it, the body will perish and certainly become a lower ghost. To serve it is to be of Supreme Clarity, to ascend to Supreme Clarity. The Eight Sovereigns regard it as the true certificate of the perfected immortal. Those who possess the true certificate have the Tai Chi script on a jade slip.
