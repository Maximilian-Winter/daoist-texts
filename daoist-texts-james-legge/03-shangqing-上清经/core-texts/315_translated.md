### The Mysterious Register of the Supreme Purity, Most High, Turtle Mountain

The True Writ of the Nine Heavens’ Right Qi of the Supreme Purity Xuan Lao, naturally from the Cavernous Void, was expounded by the Jade Emperor within the hollow chamber of Mount Hua, Jade Capital, among the dark rosy clouds and emerald feathers. At that time there were four thousand billion jade youths and nine thousand billion jade maidens, who offered gold as their ground and white jade as their couch. The Heavenly Venerable came down, with golden mats spread; all the immortal spirits and kings were summoned; they knelt long and opened the inquiry to the Mysterious Emperor of the Nine Heavens: humbly reporting the hearing of the Supreme Ones’ sacred songs and jade scripts, shining with cinnabar and verdant hues; phoenix-ridden, dragon-drawn, they came to meet the Capital’s Highest Deity, jointly chanting the nine strains of the Grand Harmony’s spiritual chapters. The cavernous mystery was carved on stone in true script, to illustrate the supreme register of the Primordial Heaven on Turtle Mountain, appointed by the Jade Void True Kings of the Nine Heavens’ chambers, bearing the standard of the Demon Spirits. On the thirty-second Heavenly Day, the month Yin, day Bing, clouds moved and rains bestowed moisture upon the world; all the myriad grasses sprouted; green trees and jade-like branches, leaves like vermilion blossoms, with fragrant gardens, fruit forests, and the three treasures of the triadic scenery. The Most High Heavenly Venerable, the Supreme Purity Jade Youths, and the True Splendid Jade Maidens, within the jade chambers of the gem halls, manifested transformation upon all beings. Ministers and sovereigns bore the jade register of the azure scenery; the officials of the ten directions, immortals, perfect sages, and the myriad lords of demons soared through the void, covering heaven and earth in flying jade-cloud chariots, with twelve hundred mysterious dragons’ carriages, thunder and lightning, and brilliant flashes illuminating the ten directions; they came down to our chamber, bowing and singing praises.

The fragrant offerings of the heavens and the hundred notes sounded as one; the wondrous gems shone in unison; the heavenly music, seven treasures, and three lights blended in harmonious sound, to delight and make joy. Summoning the nine heavens’ demons, ghosts, and evil spirits, all attended at the side of the Heavenly Emperor’s seat, flying clouds and feathered canopies, twelve banners and standards, waving banners and drumbeats, arranged before the seats, receiving the heavens’ praise. The twelve heavenly venerables, great officials among the immortals, each chanted and praised the cavernous spirit’s precious triadic chapters:

Swift winds whirl lightly as ten saints follow the venerable’s travel. Clouded banners harmonize the divine commands; purple chariots float on auspicious airs. The Supreme Purity’s heavenly venerables suddenly alight upon Jade Capital’s peak. The assembly of immortals revel in heavenly music, the hundred tones naturally blended. Together they rejoice and dance among the cloud blossoms; who can fathom the joy of the myriad perfected ones? The jade and precious forest of seven treasures sings praises, wishing to cross the same boat. The heavens chant sacred sounds, faintly flying on cloud peaks. The assembly of saints sing spiritual melodies, jade maidens chant profound joys. Together they roam the Queen Mother’s chamber, lingering at the jade hall observatory. The immortals’ jade splendour dazzles like orchids and narcissus. The cinnabar scene shines with the sun’s essence, causing my heart to hesitate. The immortals recite the emperor’s chapters; this joy admits no rival. At the green pool, rinsing in clear streams, the Kun mountain’s precious forest glows. Dragons fly swirling, the purple cloud altar gleams brightly. Evening visits to Penglai Peak; morning greets the radiant glory. Immortals wander upon cinnabar leaves, sending their radiance through literary scripts.

The true script is written in vermilion ink.

The eleven talismans of the North, on a purple ground with azure characters.

The Nine Elders of Supreme Purity, the Cavernous Spirit’s Precious True Skill, the radiance of flying cinnabar flowers; the signs of spiritual response from the Nine Elders Most High Lords; according to the canonical rites of the Jade Emperor of the Imperial Capital, the Heavenly Jade Mountain, in the first year of the Elderly Man’s reign, on the seventh day of the first month of the year Jia; in the chamber of the Seven Treasures’ jade forest upon the platform of Chaos; the Three Primordial Jade Emperors command the nine heavens’ scripts to be given to the True Lords of the Nine Heavens; no gathering of disorderly persons is allowed to mingle in one view; this is called the Supreme Truth, and strictly obeying the ritual laws of command.

All immortals and Most High Ones obtain free passage through Supreme Purity, ascending to the void’s midst, to join the Most High Divine Sovereigns and immortals, together ascending to the purple terrace of Jade Capital and the mountain, discoursing the marvelous scripture to completion, thus enabling the Turtle Mountain Primordial Cavern to obtain this true script according to the commands of the Supreme Elder, Supreme Laozi and other saints.
