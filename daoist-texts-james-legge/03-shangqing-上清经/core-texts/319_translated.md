The Text of the Supreme Transformation of the Nine Elixirs, the Emperor of the Great Subtlety imparted to the Jade Youth of the Three Heavens, is the Supreme Transformation of the Nine Revolutions, returning essence and condensing spirit, dissolving the root of the purple embryo’s nodules, restoring essence to nourish and sweeten the spirit, calming the extreme intestines, filling within and overflowing without the nine orifices bright and clear, refining marrow and changing bones, segment by segment receiving the true. Its method is lofty and subtle, secreted in the palace of the Nine Heavens’ Golden Chamber and Jade Room of the Spiritual Capital, according to the bright method of the Four Extremities, transmitted once in myriads of kalpas. Without the mystic name of the Purple Script, the Green Characters of Upper Purity, it must not be consulted or heard. Whoever offends the spiritual prohibition shall be smitten by divine weapons; in secret cultivation of the Dao, one ascends in broad daylight as an immortal.

The Elder of the Nine Heavens declared to the Jade Youth of the Three Heavens: Heaven and earth interoperate, the two polarities combine truly; yin and yang descend as qi, responding above to the Nine Mysteries, flowing the pill through nine revolutions; qi condenses as essence, essence transforms into spirit, spirit changes into man. Thus, man’s form resembles heaven and earth; his qi follows nature. The qi of nature all is the essence of the Nine Heavens, transformed into the human body; containing the fetus and nourishing it, the nine months’ qi fills, the nine heavens’ qi pervades; in the tenth month is birth. The fetus’s formation and reception of transformation has good and ill, longevity and premature death, short or long life; all depend on the inherited roots and condensed qi being impure; thus stomach accumulates stagnation, the six viscera are injured and corrupted, form and spirit are not firm, the body does not receive spirit, death qi enters the orifices, how can one survive? Only knowing to cultivate study, not understanding this origin. Now I inform you: the true form of a single body, with birth, dissolves knots, nourishes the myriad spirits, the body naturally shines, the inner palace is bright, the spirit dwells peacefully in the mansion, myriad qi together with immortals. You must keep this secret, be careful not lightly to proclaim it.

All men, upon being born, condense the Nine Elixirs of Supreme Transformation within the fetal membrane, following the qi of the Nine Heavens; when qi is full the spirit is complete, then in the fetal sac one recognizes one’s fate, knowing one’s root; the revolving wheel of cause and effect follows the kalpa of the Nine Heavens, transforming the body. Having beheld the yang path, opening and brightening the Three Lights, one then forgets the cause whence one was born. This is due to the root of the fetus knotting and blocking, tightly coiling the Three Passes, the Five Viscera neglected, death qi blocking the gates, causing the spiritual passes not to open, and thus forgetting cause and effect. If the spiritual truth entrusts transformation, containing and refining the jade fetus, passing briefly through the purple gate, operating within the human path, upright and natural, shining and radiant in spirit, then ascending the Nine Heavens, no longer knotting essence nor receiving qi to form man. All who cultivate at home, aspiring to the divine immortals, should know to refine the body in the Nine Elixirs, dissolve the knots in the Five Spirits, lead qi to the original birth, extinguish roots at the Three Gates, nine refinements and ten transformations, one hundred joints opening bright, severing and annihilating fetal knots—thus knowing the original truth. Having known the original truth, one becomes a supreme immortal. Without these methods, the Three Palaces are not enlightened, death qi is not extinguished, the stomach does not receive spirit, qi separates and the spirit wanders, the infant is not joyous, the dwelling is empty and wasted, evil demons enter the body; hence a hundred illnesses arise from this, death does not exhaust fate, how could there be joy?

The yang qi is red, called the Mysterious Elixir. The yin qi is yellow, called the Yellow Essence. Yin and yang combine, the two qi descend, essence transforms spirit, corresponding above to the Nine Heavens. The qi of the Nine Heavens flows downward to the cinnabar field, condensing with essence; they join at the life gate, needing to pass nine times—this is the Nine Elixirs, the supreme transformation condensing below, to complete the human. In the first month, receiving qi; second month, receiving spirit; third month, containing transformation; fourth month, condensing essence; fifth month, body and head complete; sixth month, transforming form; seventh month, spirit position arranged; eighth month, nine orifices clear; ninth month, nine heavens’ qi universal; then voice arises; tenth month, the controller of life records the register, receiving fate and birth. Therefore man inherits the qi of the Nine Heavens, the essence of yin and yang, called the Nine Elixirs, united into the human body. Having attained humanity, one should return to nourish the original truth, open the five viscera, dissolve fetal roots, sever death orifices; naturally then one becomes immortal.

All men born in the fetal membrane inherit the qi of the Nine Heavens, condensing essence to form themselves. After birth there are twelve nodules in the membrane, tightly coiled in the five internal organs; the five internals stagnate and block, knots cannot be untied, nodules cannot be extinguished. Hence human illness arises from nodal stagnation; human life ends from nodal firmness. If one is able to dissolve the twelve fetal nodules within the membrane, then even seeking death is impossible.

The upper part of the membrane has four knots: one in the mud pill, two in the mouth, three in the cheeks, four in the eyes. To dissolve the four knots of the upper part, on the day of one’s birth at dawn enter a chamber, burn incense, face northwest and bow nine times, facing the Primordial Father of the Nine Heavens, knock the teeth nine times, thrice call the true name of the Primordial Father, Zunhui; face southeast and bow thrice, thrice call the true name of the Mysterious Mother of the Nine Heavens, Dunhuan.

Contemplate the parents transforming into the blue and yellow two qi, intricately overlapping, contending above the head and face. Then knock teeth nine times and softly pray:

Carefully by one’s birth report to the High Dawn Primordial Father and Mysterious Mother, shining down upon my body; the eight lights shine together, the Nine Heavens are united in truth; together dissolve the four upper knots of the fetal root, return the spirit to guard the door, the nine orifices knot to immortals, internally refine and transform, the Nine Elixirs condense spirit, change the blue into red, the two qi entwine, longevity equals the Three Lights, enjoy for myriad years.

The talisman of the Three Passes and Twelve Knots within the fetal embryo

In vermilion ink on bamboo membrane, three pieces, after contemplation all complete, take facing the Grand Duke; softly pray:

The upper four knots, firmly man’s mud pill, falling man’s radiant countenance, premature life flourishing; the middle four knots, gathering misfortune in groups, tightly coiling the great granary, hastening man’s wandering soul, inviting deception and adultery, dreams unclear; the lower four knots, knotting man’s posterior gate, blocking man’s nine orifices, severing man’s root of life; Emperor Lord commands spirit, Nine Heavens five characters, dissolving and removing nodules, annihilating all roots and sources, Primordial Father and Mysterious Mother nurturing and raising the Three Passes, Eight Lights guarding fully, true qi dispersing and dividing, Upper Purity below Yellow, outer square inside round, wrapped in complete clarity, descending to summon Three Primes, riding Eight Lights, flying in the sky and flowing clouds, soaring in the void, ascending to the Golden Gate. Complete, swallow twelve qi, swallow twenty-four times, all stop.

On one’s birth day at dawn, midday, and midnight, dissolve the three sections and twelve knots; the eight seasonal festivals should also be observed, to hasten the near attainment of immortality. Cultivation at the eight festivals is also like the three times of contemplation; practiced for three years, the face produces jade light, the body reflects golden truth, flesh consumes and bones lighten, internally transforming to immortal knots; nine years spirit descends, ascending in broad daylight. Without these methods, all efforts are vain, death knots do not dissolve, stagnation coils daily, spirit and qi do not disperse, evil demons enter the body, wandering spirits scatter; how can one attain immortality? Those with heart aspiring to the utmost should deeply search this origin, dissolve knots at the three times, and surely obtain supreme immortality. Returning fetal jade beauty, receiving truth at the Three Passes, Three Sections and Eight Lights, Twenty-Four Spirits, a thousand carriages and ten thousand riders, together riding purple smoke. The high and sublime transformation, the Jade Emperor’s spiritual chapters; careless transmission and leakage harms the seven mysteries, death spirits bear blame, long fall into the river source; one’s self is examined, enduring the three paths and five sufferings, countless kalpas without restoration. Students be cautious, carefully understand these words.

The spirits of the Two Lights are all the essence born of the Nine Heavens’ transformation. Primordial Father transforms above, Mysterious Mother forms the fetus, the Nine Heavens nurture and raise to form man, Twenty-Four persons, each having spiritual passes. Those who wish to cultivate, not knowing to keep mindful of their form, then the spirit wanders and qi scatters, death qi knots and sinks, evil demons enter the lights, hastening demise in youth. If one understands cultivation, dissolves the Three Passes, spirit rests in the palace, spirit guards the jade gate, nodules dissolve by themselves, death qi vanishes by itself, myriad spirits all shine, then one ascends in broad daylight.

All men inherit the qi of the Nine Heavens; qi condenses to essence, essence transforms to elixir, elixir changes to man, forming fetus and containing pregnancy, following nature. Having attained humanity, one should return to nourish the original truth, making essence overflow the six palaces, qi descending the spirit court, inside and outside bright and fresh, united with truth and spirit. This method is lofty and subtle, not passed to lower immortals; those who cultivate and attain this path return to white and halt age, living as long as the Three Lights, heaven and earth inclined; to carelessly leak its essentials is to examine one’s self severely.

All who study the higher way must first dissolve the knots of the Three Passes in the body. The method of dissolving knots must be regularly practiced according to the month of fetal formation, nourishing the original source, causing death knots to sink and disappear, nine truths guarding spirit, true qi having descended, then one naturally attains longevity, qi and image mutually respond, thus learning is unnecessary. To practice this way, suppose one is born in the seventh month, then the tenth month is the fetal month; the tenth month fetus receives the qi of Polida He Heavenly King, thus on the first day of the tenth month at dawn, the eleventh day at midday, the twenty-first day at midnight, and the third day of the month at the three times, one bathes in fragrant water, burns incense, enters a chamber, faces northwest and bows nine times, faces the Primordial Father of the Nine Heavens, faces southeast and bows three times to the Mysterious Mother of the Nine Heavens; then faces the moon branch and sits calmly, knocks teeth thirty-six times, closes eyes and contemplates Polida He Heavenly King, surname Yu, named Ling Wu, wearing nine-coloured seamless mysterious cloud treasure robe, head adorned with limitless flowing yellow filling star flying essence crown, riding five-coloured cloud carriage, accompanied by twelve Tai Xuan jade youths, coming down into the body of the omen, guarding the mud pill palace. Seeing the verdant cloud dense and rich, the crown surrounds the body of omen; after a long time, still drawing cloud qi from the mouth, swallowing nine times, softly pray:

Mysterious origin spreading qi, yang path open and clear, two polarities combine and descend, blue and yellow accompanying, supreme transforming Nine Elixirs, condensing essence in the Three Palaces, form patterned by nature, qi patterned by the great void, Emperor Lord guarding spirit, Mysterious Mother guarding the room, myriad spirits stable, six stomachs flourishing, Nine Heavens crowned and girded, three lights shining down, five truths assisting and winging, returning the body to the void cavity, riding the void and driving the floating, ascending to the Emperor’s hall. Complete, again swallow qi nine times, swallow liquid twenty-four times and stop. Thus the qi of the Nine Heavens nourishes the body; the fetal nodules stagnate and knot, thus one cannot be reborn at the Three Passes. Practiced for three years, one gains knowledge of things ten thousand li distant, omens of good and ill. This is because the joints receive truth and the orifices open and enlightened.

In the eleventh month receive the qi of Brahma Ma Jia Yi Heavenly King; thus on the second day of the month at dawn, twelfth day at midday, twenty-second day at midnight, third day of the month at three times, bath in fragrant water, burn incense, enter chamber, face northwest and bow nine times to Primordial Father, southeast and bow three times to Mysterious Mother, face moon branch and sit calmly, knock teeth thirty-six times, close eyes and keep calling Brahma Ma Jia Yi Heavenly King, surname Xuan, named È Fēi, wearing nine-coloured original phoenix flying cloud robe, head adorned with mysterious morning star flowing essence crown, riding white qilin plain cloud flying wheel, accompanied by thirty-two Taihua jade youths, coming down into the body of omen in the chamber; seeing green cloud qi dense and rich, crown surrounds the body of omen; after a long time, still drawing cloud qi from mouth, swallowing nine times, softly pray:

Nine Heavens flowing pill, supreme transformation condensing essence, Primordial Father injecting qi, Mysterious Mother receiving spirit, five flowers scattering radiance, three truths mingled, Emperor Lord commanding register, Great One inscribing birth, supreme dark and lower yellow, three palaces purified, nine orifices receiving truth, myriad spirits peaceful and harmonious, riding fate and returning the year, restoring original form, ascending with qi, born with spirit, flying in the profound void, reporting to the imperial court. Complete, again swallow qi nine times, swallow liquid twenty-four times and stop.
