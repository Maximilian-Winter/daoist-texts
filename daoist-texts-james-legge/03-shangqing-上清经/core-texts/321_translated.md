# The True Scripture of the Mysterious Elixir of the Bright Hall of Supreme Clarity

Title of the Scripture: The True Scripture of the Mysterious Elixir of the Bright Hall of Supreme Clarity. The author is unknown, but it is roughly dated to the Eastern Jin and Southern Dynasties. It is compiled by excerpting from the Great Marvelous Scripture. The original text is found in the Zhengyi section of the Daoist Canon of Orthodox Tradition.

Guarding the inch on the left is the Great God of the Scarlet Terrace and Azure Chamber, named Zhengxin, styled Chufang; on the right, the Great God of the Yellow Gate and Violet Chamber, named Pingjing, styled Fawang. Their forms are like infants; their garments correspond to their chamber’s colours, and they hold streaming golden fire-bells in their hands. When one desires to recline or to think deeply, one first summons the two great gods in their forms and appearances; then thrice calls their names, and softly utters this invocation:

"Violet Door, Azure Chamber, there dwell two great gods;  
Hands grasping the flowing bells, bodies born of wind and cloud,  
Chivalrous protectors of the True Way, heedless of the outside world —  
Let my thoughts be moved, and open the spiritual passes,  
Entering and exiting with virtue and purity, ascending the nine gates,  
At once beholding the Nine Truths, the supreme exalted ones."

Having completed this, one then contemplates the Three Ones: on the left of the Bright Hall, the Bright Child True Lord, Xuanyang, styled Shaoqing; in the centre, the Bright Mirror Spirit Lord, named Zhaojing, styled Siming; on the right, the Bright Female True Official, named Weiyin, styled Shaoyuan. Their forms are like infants, all clad in green brocade robes, girded with four red jade bells, their mouths holding red jade mirrors; they sit facing outward, or sometimes face one another. This is the Dao of the Bright Hall.

If a Daoist be fearful or afraid, he should summon the Three Spirits and cause the jade bells to ring; the sound will be heard as the Supreme Ultimate, and his mouth shall emit the red light of the jade mirror, flashing and sparkling for ten thousand zhang. Having completed their summoning, then thrice call the names of the Three Lords, gnash the teeth nine times; then a thousand demons will be subdued, and ten thousand ghosts lose their forms.

If the Daoist be hungry or thirsty, summon the Three Spirits and call their names; the spirits then emit red breath from their mouths, pouring it into the mouth of the summoner, who inhales and swallows it, and presently becomes full.

If the Daoist travels at night and cannot see the way in the dark, then summon and call the Three Spirits, who each emit firelight from their mouths to illuminate the path before him, and presently all is radiant and clear.

If one meets with misfortune or calamity, or comes to the place of knives and weapons, summon and call the Three Spirits and shake the jade bells; the sound fills the six directions and all within, and the calamities will no longer arise to harm.

If one seeks longevity, or desires to dispel sickness, one should first rectify the mind and lie down in peace; then summon and call the Three Lords, who will kneel long facing outward, and from their mouths emit red breath, which they pour into the mouth and body of the supplicant. He must swallow it abundantly; the red light encircles the body on every side, transforming into fire, which then burns the body. The body and the fire merge and become transparent and clear; after a long time the body is reduced to mere ashes. Then one preserves the breath of the Four Kings, dispersing it on the wind, then gathers it again and opens the eyes of the spirit. By frequently doing thus, one’s countenance becomes like that of a young maiden, and this is the foundation for long vision.

In the Chamber of the Bridal Room’s Palace: on the left, the Young Hero Lord; in the centre, the Yellow Old Lord; on the right, the White Prime Lord — this is the Way of the Flying True Ones, recorded in the Scripture of Golden Flower.

In the Palace of the Elixir Field dwells the True One Lord of the Upper Origin, together with two ministers; the three dwell together. This place is the true carriage of clouds, controlling the way of dragon and deer. There is another scripture for this.

In the Palace of Flowing Pearls is the Way practised by the highest nobles of the Supreme Ultimate, the Lords of Life and Death. Three hundred years fulfilled, one uses pearl and silk to swear an oath, and then it is transmitted.

The Scripture of the Former Three Officers seeks the immortal spirits and the True Persons’ way, to be practised in the world. But the frame of bones and life must be upright; in the world there is the true name; when the time and encounter are fitting, the Supreme Ultimate Lord may give a command to confer it.

In the Jade Emperor’s Palace dwells the Jade Pure Spirit Mother, surname Lian, name Xian, styled Huangyan; she wears the dark yellow pure spirit’s ribbon, and on her head is called the Vermilion Jade Chignon, crowned with the Crown of Infinite Merit.

In the Heavenly Court Palace dwells the Upper Essence True Lady, surname Jue, name Hui, styled Bilei; she wears the blue treasure divine light embroidered brocade and frost gauze of nine colours, her head adorned with the jade treasure flying cloud chignon, crowned with the dark yellow Crown of Merit.

In the Utmost True Palace dwells the Supreme Ultimate Empress, surname Xuan, name Xusheng, styled Bowu; she wears the dark gauze streaming light ribbon of five colours with phoenix patterns, her head the seven treasures dark pattern chignon, crowned with the Crown of Infinite Merit.

In the Great Emperor’s Palace dwells the Supreme Sovereign Queen, surname Qian, name Hanhai, styled Heyansheng; she wears the seven treasures flying essence dark light cloud brocade frost gauze of nine colours, her head the nine dark jade essence drifting cloud chignon, crowned with the dark yellow infinite triple treasure jade crown.

These Four Palaces’ Scriptures belong to the Female True One’s transmission of self-cultivation to become immortal and seek the True Way, surpassing the Male True One. For beginners, the palaces are all empty; their essentials cannot be approached or heard; the Pure Spirit imposes great restrictions.

In the Mysterious Elixir Palace sits the True Lord Taiyi, surname Jue, name Guiying, styled Huaxuan; his form is like a newborn infant, seated on a golden bed within a jade canopy, wearing purple embroidered brocade robes, girded with a belt of flowing fire bells; his left hand holds the seven stars of the Northern Dipper, his right hand the cord of the Northern Pole; he alone sits upright in the Mysterious Elixir Palace.

If a Daoist, having completed the contemplation of the Three Ones, then should summon and call the Supreme Clarity Yellow Central Taiyi True Lord, seeking longevity and long vision. From the Taiyi Palace he takes rest, drinks fifty times the clear breath emitted from Taiyi’s mouth, then swallows fifty times the saliva. When complete, he softly utters:

"True August Taiyi, Yellow Purple Lord, his name is Guiying, styled Huaxuan,  
Golden bed, jade canopy, purple embroidered brocade robe, girded with fire bells,  
Slashing evil and destroying treachery, hands grasping star essence,  
At the crown is the genuine birth truth, sitting upright, breathing forth,  
Let me swallow and take within, and speak with me,  
Together to enjoy the Mysterious Elixir, to refine and cleanse the seven souls,  
To harmonize and soften the three spirits, the divine spirits protect and guard,  
Let me become a flying immortal, the five viscera self-generate,  
Returning to the white child’s visage, receiving the scriptures of Supreme Clarity,  
Overseeing fate and the Emperor Lord, all wishes and desires,  
Hundreds of blessings are intimate."

Thus ends the recital. It is practised for fourteen years, and together with Taiyi reaches the cord of the Seven Primes. At eighteen years, one goes to Supreme Clarity to receive the scriptures and talismans, commanding eighteen jade boys and jade girls. One may name each and cultivate them, or solely cultivate this Way; it is not necessary always to keep the Three Ones.

The True Talisman of the Right Supreme Ultimate Lord: six talismans of the Upper Origin, five talismans of the Middle Origin, five talismans of the Lower Origin. The Supreme One summons the Three Ones to guard the form, on the days of the Beginning of Spring, Vernal Equinox, Beginning of Summer, Summer Solstice, Beginning of Autumn, Autumnal Equinox, Beginning of Winter, and Winter Solstice, writing in cinnabar, at dawn facing the king one talisman is worn; in succession across sixteen days, all sixteen talismans are worn. Afterwards, the eight festivals are treated in the same manner, all facing the king with repeated bows, chanting:

"Upper Origin True One, guarding the firm cinnabar pellet,  
Middle Origin True One, calming the spirit in the Scarlet Palace,  
Lower Origin True One, guarding my life gate,  
Three Origins shining together, preserving life and enduring,  
Calling the spirits and drawing in the breath, sitting down naturally,  
Transforming form and refining body, bones transmuted to immortality,  
Hair flying like feathers and gauze, soaring at the imperial dawn."

Also the cinnabar-written talisman, placed in a brocade pouch, worn upon the head, one must not tread upon filth or defilement. Wearing the talisman for five years one may meet a True Person; after nine years one attains clear spiritual vision, sitting or standing in dying and rising, commanding the six Jia, the heavens sending twelve jade boys and twelve jade girls, riding clouds and driving dragons, feasting in the Jade Palace. The method of guarding the One is the foremost chapter of the True Scripture of the Emperor Lord of the Supreme Refined Golden Gate Heaven above, the highest jade Dao, the ford of the immortals, the wondrous secret of the many True Ones. If you can guard the One, the One guards you; if you can see the One, the One sees you. The One must stand in the body, the body must be one to be born; continually think of it, sleeping or waking, never releasing it — then longevity may be hoped for.
