### The Superior Purity Jade Palace Spirit-Flying Six Jia Left and Right Supreme Talismans

The Superior Purity Jade Palace Spirit-Flying Six Jia and the sixty Jade Maidens, their secret names together with the left and right supreme talismans, were received by the Supreme Ultimate Nine Divisions Sovereign Supreme Ultimate Perfected Person from the Jade Morning Great Dao Lord. The left and right Spirit-Flying Six Jia talismans are also called the Jade Essence True Secret Method, the Way in the Bright Interval, and the White Feather Black Wing Hidden Wandering Superior Scripture, which is the Spirit-Flying Six Jia Divine Way.

The gods of the Six Jia ride six dragons in their time, feasting amid celebratory clouds, gazing upon the six directions, then returning to subdue the talisman-bearer's sleeping chamber. In accord with the seasons, they also ride the chariot of the white luan, driving the black-winged phoenix, to feast in the constant Yang inverted brightness, watching the traveling gods of the eight directions and the sacred mountains.

The talisman-bearer's body is harmonized and united with soul and spirit, spiritual communication reaches the form, the three breaths blend with incense, the five viscera generate splendour; sitting or standing at death, he may command and summon ten thousand demons, tread sharp cliffs and precipices, receive ten thousand blessings harmoniously, cross mountains and enter waters, follow coasts and walk rivers without regard for ferries or bridges, fear no dangerous heights, transform and hide, summon wind and thunder, raise clouds and rain, sit to cause the kitchen to act, enter battle without harm, enter water without wetting; mountain gods attend and guard, jade maidens come to welcome.

If worn for six years, the Six Jia will appear to the body, speak with the person, instruct in the true writings, granting long life in heaven and earth, the two images united with the talisman. One must keep separate from other sleeping places, avoiding licentious and false desires; with a quiet mind like a mirror one may behold and seek.

The Four Perfected Persons of the Supreme Ultimate say: The six qi run their course through the ten heavens; the Six Jia complete their cycles through the netherworld. Possessing their talisman, one may hide and transform without limit; hearing their name one supplements the heavenly truth; practising their Way one flies in emptiness and rides the brightness; wearing their script the jade maidens hold the scarf.

To use it for six years is to inscribe merit on the green palace jade slips and record names and titles; ten thousand gods attend and guard; perfected persons build the chamber. Practising it for fourteen years, the Three Primal Lords of the Great White receive with the three morning feathers of the festival, clothed in purple mist cloud cloaks; in the evening they travel the eight brightnesses, in the morning ascend the tiger carriage, sing with phoenix flutes, enjoy the mysterious music, ten thousand gods support the carriage, control wind and summon clouds, the Great One reins the bridle, in broad daylight ascends the morning.

The Six Jia Spirit-Flying Left and Right Jade Maidens, their names number sixty persons; every jia day at early dawn, facing the royal direction with eyes closed, one inwardly contemplates the sixty jade maidens of the Six Jia cycle, all come arrayed and stand before me, their clothing, form and appearance as above. After a long while is ended, then one knocks the teeth six times, swallows saliva sixty times; when finished, one softly chants the incantation:

Left flies, right spirits, eight brightnesses splendid essence, above planted jade chamber, below refined cinnabar jade; combining and measuring eight cycles, governing and directing all beings, divine powers accumulate feeling, six qi practiced pure; cloud officials and jade splendour, ride void and follow life, brocade scarves and flying skirts, rosy clouds reflect purple chambers, waist belts with tiger script, bestow feathers and erect azure, hands hold divine talismans, flowing gold and fire bells, wave away evil and repel demons, protect my benefit and chastity, cleave and carve myriad demons, all evil perishes and is levelled, together roaming the three lights, returning old and reverting infantile, sitting and standing at death, attending me the six ding, fierce beasts guard the body, following heavenly soldiers, breathing rivers and streams, mountains and peaks flowing and inclining, finally bringing about the kitchen's action, golden nectar and jade blossoms, gathering and binding tigers and leopards, shouting and ordering the netherworld, commanding ghosts and spirits, capturing and subduing a thousand essences, wishes follow the heart, all matters succeed, divide the Way and disperse the body, freely transform form, supplement perfected persons, heaven and earth born together, ears sharp and eyes bright, thoroughly see the Yellow Court, Six Jia Jade Maidens, act as my envoys.

When the incantation is finished, close the eyes; at the first meditation, one should sit upright, pressing hands upon the knees, not letting others see. If seen, the true light will not be uniform, thoughts will scatter, and the mind will not rest; one must be careful. Before donning the talisman, first call the name of the jade maiden of the direct day; when complete, softly chant the incantation:

Heaven mysterious, earth yellow, great void six qi, morning attire spirit essence, divine golden tiger script, command my truth, also command my spirit, disperse form and shadow, seal mountains and summon spirits, command and use myriad gods, sitting at death and standing with life, high travel in Supreme Purity, northward facing Jade Morning.

The two foregoing talismans are the fundamental talismans of the Spirit-Flying Six Jia. Before wearing the talismans, one must fast and purify for six days, then wear them. After wearing them for sixty days, one may obtain the sixty jade maiden talismans. These two talismans chiefly summon the spirits, communicate with myriad essences; continued wearing does not fail, and one flies to immortality and long life. Having worn the sixty jade maiden talismans, one must also cultivate these talismans at the same time. Male and female officials each use them according to their names; avoid places of disease and death, must not share bed or couch with others, clothing must not be lent to others, abstain from eating the five pungent herbs and meats of the six domestic animals, and avoid contact with women, especially strictly forbidden, lest one lose the spirit and soul, become afflicted with evil and lose nature, suffer calamity to the three qi, and die as a lower ghost. One must constantly burn incense at the head of the sleeping grove.

There are sixty-two such talismans, received by the Four Perfected Persons of the Supreme Ultimate Upper Palace from the Supreme Dao Lord. The receiver must be vigilant and pure in heart, wash away the five accumulations of defilement and filth, cut off losses from dust, dirt, and lust, correct the eyes and preserve the six essences, concentrate thought on jade truth, scatter incense smoke in the chamber, seclude the body in a lonely room, accumulate virtue and merit, harmonize the soul and protect the center, imitate the five gods roaming the three palaces, cease contention among ordinary folks, keep silence to produce responsiveness; then the Six Jia gods will descend upon oneself within a year. If one can cultivate this Way with care, one must attain ascension to immortality. Those who trust and serve are spiritual persons; those who do not believe will sink to the Nine Springs.

The Superior Purity Six Jia Spirit-Reflection Way must be given only to the most refined and true persons; then it may be transmitted and the descent attained. The Perfected Person of the Nine Peaks, Xu Weiyuan, formerly received this method at the Central Peak from Song Dexuan. Dexuan was a man of the time of King Xuan of Zhou, who wore this Spirit-Flying Six Jia talisman, attained the Way, could travel three thousand li in a day, often changed shape into birds and beasts, and obtained the Way of true spirit; now he dwells on Mount Song. Weiyuan long followed him and received this method; practising it successfully, he now dwells on Mount Jiuyi. Women Guo Shaoyao, Zhao Aier, Wang Lulian, and others received this method and attained the Way, numbering several tens; some wander in the Mysterious Continent, some dwell at various platforms in the Eastern Blossom region, now seen dwelling there. The Lady Wei of the Southern Peak said: This Guo Shaoyao was the daughter of General Guo Qian of Han's Liaodong, from Yangping; from youth she loved the Dao and sincerity, so the Perfected Person imparted to her the Six Jia technique. Zhao Aier was wife of Liu Yu, the governor of Youzhou, and elder sister of Assistant Governor Zhao Gai; she loved the Dao, attained corpse liberation, and then received this talisman. Wang Lulian was a city gate captain under Emperor Wei of Wei, daughter of Prince Bozhou; she also studied the Dao, suddenly abandoned transformation one day, her husband Li Ziqi entered Mount Luhun; the Perfected Person again conferred this method, Ziqi being a Sima of Wei and duke of Qinghe. It was always said this woman ran wildly, and one day lost her way.

The Superior Purity Six Jia Spirit-Flying hidden and elusive; wearing these true talismans, one may wander the eight directions. Practising these true writings, one will find the proper person. According to the bright regulations of the Four Extremities, those who transmit the Superior Purity inner writings must all enroll and swear the oath; in seven hundred years only six persons may receive it; exceeding the time limit is forbidden, and not to be revealed again.

Those receiving the degree must fast seven days, prepare incense, firewood, and white mulberry silk sixty feet long, six pairs of golden rings, two and twenty feet each of five-coloured silk to replace hair-cutting on ascending the altar; they swear by blood to break the covenant and pledge to implement the spirit talisman, never to reveal the jade name. If the covenant is broken and the oath violated, the seven ancestors and parents and oneself will all suffer the trial of the wind blade, go to the River of Accumulated Night, and carry the stone of Meng Mountain to fill Mengjin.

Teachers of the scripture, upon receiving the method and faith, must provide to the poor, the homeless, the sick, old, feeble, and weak; not to use it alone. If they violate the regulations, the Three Officials will record and inspect, and the offender will die as a lower ghost. One must be most respectful and cautious.
