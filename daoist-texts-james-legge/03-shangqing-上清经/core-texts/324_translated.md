# Scripture of the Shangqing Qu-Su Formula and Charms

Title of the Scripture: Scripture of the Shangqing Qu-Su Formula and Charms. Author unknown, probably issued in the period of Nan and Bei.

Source text: in the Zhengyi section of the Daozang Zhengtong edition.

### Scripture of the Shangqing Qu-Su Formula and Charms

Also named the “Great Writ of the Nine Heavens’ Phoenix Qi and Mysterious Mound”

Transmitted by the True Man of the Left of the Supreme Ultimate

The Supreme One transmitted these to the True Man of the Left, to deliver to the Azure Youth Great Lord of the Eastern Sea Palaces, who would pass them to the superior adepts bearing the jade name, those who are true immortals and perfected ones. Wearing it for thirty years, one may behold the Three Primal Lords, and welcome the Holy Lord at the Shangqing Golden Palace. For seven hundred years the two are heard transmitting. In the fasting chamber, the sacred battle is invoked and the rite completed; a blood oath on golden silk is sworn, substituting for the blood covenant on the altar.

[Qu-Su]#1 Formula and Charms

The Qu-Su commands the ghosts of the six heavens with awe, marshals the spirits of multitudinous essences, orders the Five Emperors, controls the Five Sacred Mountains, inscribes talismans on rivers and marshes, and summons a hundred ghosts.

The formula restrains the tigers and leopards of the famous mountains, governs the dragons of a hundred rivers, commands ten thousand ghosts, and drives away ten thousand evils.

The foregoing talismans are all written in cinnabar.

White Silk E

A white silk of thirty feet, to preserve the voucher of blood and essence, substituting the Qu-Su blood oath. Without fasting one may not open or wear the talisman. A plain brocade of twenty feet, to preserve the voucher of immortals, serving as the oath of the three transmissions over seven hundred years, to be worn entering illness, water, fire, mountains, or chambers. Three pairs of golden rings, to preserve the voucher of longevity and great forbearance, as the pact to guard the heart without obstruction. The Daoist without this text cannot see the Three Primal Lords. Nine taels of incense, to preserve the voucher of spiritual communication, as the covenant with the dark spirits and to summon and command the ghosts of the six heavens. Men receiving it face north, the master faces south; women receive it facing south, the master faces north. When surrendering the writing and offerings, the formula is orally transmitted by the master. The bestowal is made facing north. The man is granted it for ten years, then another fast with surrender of the writing. The woman is granted it for ten years, then one offering. Talismanic wine and dried meat are arrayed within a chamber, invoking the Supreme Pure, the Lofty True One, the Perfected True One of Radiant Spirit, the Supreme Elder’s Palace to perform the precepts. The receiver responds to the talisman and oral transmission, without employing writing in the incense oath of the attendant.

The Supreme Pure Lofty Immortal of Radiant Cloud True One opens the great celestial talisman; the Supreme Elder receives the Five Sacred Mountain Lords; wearing it removes calamity and banishes misfortune, repels evil and pursues demons, guards the multitudinous essences, commands the hundred birds and beasts, controls ghosts and spirits, prolongs life by ten years, restores the soul and repels old age, securing the person’s long abiding. Also named the “Three Heavens’ Certain Life Contract.”

The Nine Heavens’ Elder commands ten white plain-clad jade female officers, who are stationed on the left and right of disciples.

The foregoing talismans, except for the casual notes on their colours, are all written in cinnabar.

The “Nine Heavens’ Phoenix Qi Mysterious Mound True Book,” the Mysterious Capital Elder’s Immortal Talisman, conferred for wearing for three days, entrusted with blue silk, three pairs of rings, and silk incense as a covenant of bestowal. The transmission records the Grand Duke of the Year, neither tardy nor deceitful, neither vicious nor ill, practicing benevolence and accumulating virtue, preserving spirit and true thought. The wearer of the register is an immortal.

To the right is one line, the officer writes from wearing. Originally, the Sun, Moon, and Five Planets constituted the Seven Primordials; outside of these are another five talismans, presumably from the “Exorcising Demons Scripture.” But the “Exorcising Demons Scripture” contains forty-nine talismans, its text mostly blank with differing extents. Now there are also several of these, but the rest are scattered and lost. Also one yellow talisman, whose scripture says it comes from the “True Proclamation,” saying it is the talisman of the North Emperor Fengtai, commanded by the True Man of the Supreme Ultimate, in the Jade Horse Scripture, not yet fully examined. Otherwise, the Seven Primordial talismans have roughly established usages in extant scriptures; this is the wearing edition, so no explanation is given. It is appropriate to follow the True Proclamation, using various coloured inks and miscellany colours to write and wear. The command of Fengtai says in the talisman proclamation: whoever carries this talisman in a heavy purple pouch wears it upon the head.
