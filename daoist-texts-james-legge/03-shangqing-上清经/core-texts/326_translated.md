# Pure Spirits of the Supreme Clarity, First Chapter

### Title of the Scripture: Pure Spirits of the Supreme Clarity, First Chapter.  
Author unknown, roughly dating from the Eastern Jin and Southern Dynasties. It is compiled by excerpting the Great Marvelous Scripture (Da You Miao Jing). The original source is the Zhengyi section of the Daoist Canon.

The Supreme Emperor of Heaven, the Highest Emperor, and the Supreme Emperor of the Great Subtlety, the Three Lords of the Mysterious Elixir Scripture, transmitted by the Great Lord of the Azure Youth, Chapter One.

The Three Lords—Highest Lord, Supreme Emperor, and Supreme Emperor of the Great Subtlety—formerly received the Mysterious Elixir Scripture from the Supreme Dao Lord. Having cultivated the Way to completion, they supplemented the truth of emperors and kings. On the day of their ascension to the firmament, the Highest Lord transmitted the true scripture to the Western Queen Mother; the Supreme Emperor transmitted the true scripture to the Supreme Origin Lord of the Southern Pole; the Supreme Emperor of the Great Subtlety transmitted the true scripture to the Sacred Lord of the Golden Gate; the Sacred Lord of the Golden Gate transmitted the true scripture to the Prime Minister Azure Youth Lord; the Prime Minister Azure Youth Lord transmitted the true scripture to Juanzi. This scripture is the Pure Spirits, First Chapter. This Way is lofty and subtle, not to be heard by the middle immortals. Unless it be the famous book of crimson slips and the green characters of the Great Ultimate, the Mysterious Elixir Scripture cannot be encountered or perceived. A Daoist who has thoroughly cultivated the Three Supreme True Scriptures occupies the rank of supreme duke and supreme minister among emperors and kings. If the scripture received be partial, and the hearing of the Way limited, his rank will be that of a minor lord of a spiritual palace, minister of the Divine Land, or a mid-to-lower official of the Great Ultimate. Yet he may ride dragons and drive clouds, ascend flying and control the void, serve as divine officer, guiding and protecting, dispersing light to the eight quarters. Subtle and profound indeed, difficult to lightly proclaim. The titles of the scripture derive from the Eight Pure Chapters of the Supreme Secret Book, having their measure of raising and lowering.

The Triune Supreme Emperor of the Mud Pellet is the spirit ancestor of the one body, the root of life for a hundred spirits, the source of generated fluids, the jade chamber of soul and essence. Hence the stomach pool is square to receive things; the brain palace is round and empty, fitting the truth; myriad hairs stand erect, and a thousand pores emit smoke. Virtue completes heaven and earth, blending with the Great Mystery. Thus it is named the Mud Pellet, the upper spirit of the corporeal form. Those who think only of swallowing saliva and breathing qi, or who sound their teeth and take in liquid, but do not know the source thereof, are but like the dregs of the Mud Pellet’s flow, the side branches of the brain palace. Now I shall instruct thee in the secret of assisting the pursuit of unity, so that thou mayest become a perfected person among the highest immortals. The disciple receiving this scripture shall fast and purify for forty-five days; then transmit it, using forty blue silks, five bright red mirrors, and three pairs of golden rings, as the covenant of the single cave. Do not reveal this upon any clear oath.

Above the space between the eyebrows, measuring one inch inward, lies the Bright Hall; two inches inward, the Cavern Chamber; three inches inward, the Elixir Field. Directly above, one inch square is the Mysterious Elixir, the chamber of soul in the Mud Pellet of the brain.

Within the Bright Hall, on the left is the Bright Youth True Lord, on the right the Bright Maiden True Lady, in the middle the Bright Mirror True Lord. The Bright Youth True Lord is named Xuanyang, styled Shaoqing; the Bright Maiden True Lady, named Weiyin, styled Shaoyuan; the Bright Mirror True Lord, named Zhaojing, styled Siming. These three lords govern together the Bright Hall Palace, clad in green brocade, with belts bearing four jade bells, holding jade mirrors in their mouths, the mirror and bells both of red jade. Heads like infants, their forms likewise; they sit facing outward, or sometimes face each other. This is the way of the Bright Hall, the practice of immortals, the cultivation of the Way and virtue. If a Daoist fears and is timid, preserving the Three Spirits, let him ring the jade bells, whose sound is heard as the Great Ultimate; let him emit from his mouth the red light of the jade mirror, ten thousand zhang in length; preserving these perfectly, then calling thrice the names of the Three Lords, and striking the heavenly drum nine times, then a thousand demons will prostrate themselves, and ten thousand ghosts will lose form. If the Daoist be hungry or thirsty, let him also preserve the Three Lords, and with mouth emit red qi, pouring it into his own mouth, inhaling and swallowing it, and presently he will be full. If the Daoist walk by night, darkness preventing seeing the road, again preserve the Three Lords, let the mouth emit three flames to illuminate the path ahead, and in a moment the road will be clear and bright. Further, if he walk among peril and calamity, where blades and arms threaten, quickly preserve the Three Lords, cause them to ring the jade bells, and with intention and spirit consider; the enemy’s heart will naturally be struck with fear and awe, and no longer conceive evil or harm. If the Daoist desires to seek longevity, life extension, and immortality, or when sick and troubled, seeking aid and survival, he shall lie calmly, spiritfully preserving the Three Lords of the Bright Hall, facing outward with long kneeling; mouth emitting red qi, first passing through his own body, circulating about the mouth’s edge, containing and swallowing the red qi. Much and without number, he shall close his eyes and slightly swallow. Presently the red qi will encircle his body, all turning to fire, fire turning about the body, body and fire becoming one. Within and without, light shines through, long continued until it ceases, called the training of sun and moon to the form, death and rebirth. Also, lying at dusk, this must be done regularly; then one will surely live long and not die. Often preserving and swallowing the red qi makes one’s complexion pale and youthful like a child; this is the way of immortality, followed by immortals, the essential secret of the Bright Hall.

At dawn, always swallow saliva thirty times, wiping the face with the hand and rubbing the eyes as usual; preserving the saliva as red fluid.

Within the Cavern Chamber are three True Lords: on the left Wuyingzi, on the right Bai Yuanjun, in the middle Huang Laojun. These three True Lords govern the Cavern Chamber; this is the way of the Flying Truth, having its own separate scripture.

Within the Elixir Field is the Supreme Origin True One Emperor Lord, with three ministers governing together the Elixir Field, holding the way of the Three Origins True One. This place is the essential path of truth, the road controlling the dragon chariot. The Heavenly Truth delights in earthly immortals; earthly immortals conceal themselves in office, not laboring or wasting themselves in court banquets; thus they are composed and at ease, wandering with the times, driving seven or more chariots, stepping the four breaths at the Great Origin. Although Heavenly and Earthly Truths differ slightly in rank, they are one truth. Earthly Truths each rest where they belong, no longer desiring to be officials among the clouds.

The Mysterious Elixir Palace has the Mud Pellet Supreme One True Lord. Behind the Elixir Field, one inch inward, lies the Streaming Pearl Palace; the True Spirit has its own scripture, governing the course of life. This Way is greatest, obscurely entangled, knotting and binding; only thus can it be entrusted. Transmission occurs once every three hundred years, ending at five transmissions; no further exit. This is the Way of the Great Ultimate dukes and ministers who govern life.

Man’s head has nine palaces; let us first speak thereof. Above between the eyebrows, enclosed are the Yellow Gate, Purple Door, Crimson Terrace, and Blue Chamber, together constituting a one-inch guard, inside the left and right ears. To the left of the guard is the Crimson Terrace; to the right, the Yellow Gate. The True Lords of the Nine Palaces enter and exit by the path between the Yellow Gate and Crimson Terrace, hence the placement of the terrace and gate. The terrace and gate watch for unusual signs, welcoming the comings and goings of true persons. The Purple Door Great God is named Pingjing, styled Law King; the Blue Chamber Great God is named Zhengxin, styled Initial Square. Both appear as infants, clothed in garments matching the colours of the chambers and doors, holding flowing golden bells. The guard, one third of an inch inward, is called the Guard Inch. At night or during meditation, first preserve these two great gods, as if before the eyes, then thrice call their names. Afterward a slight incantation is uttered:

Purple Door and Blue Chamber, two great gods, hands holding flowing bells, bodies born of wind and cloud, guardians of the true way, not heeding external affairs, causing my thoughts and feelings to open, facilitating spiritual gates, entering and exiting with purity and blessing, ascending the nine gates; then one beholds the nine truths, the supreme honour of the Highest.

Thus ends the preservation and meditation on the triune Cavern Chamber and the essentials of the Nine Truths.

The two gods of the Guard Inch hear only the true officials within the Nine Palaces, those who enter and exit within the Nine Palaces. From the trust and command of the Highest Emperor, to the Jade Youth Spirit Truth, to worthy sages and immortals coming to the imperial pavilion, they attend and admit; others who are not true are not heard by these two gods, who prevent their advance. This is the law and order of the Yellow Great One. Then the Infant Emperor Lord commands two ear gods, tender maidens of the cloud rites, to guide the admissions. Hence when a man perceives ringing in the ears, it is because an external envoy has entered. Should there be likes or dislikes, Cloud Rite at once strikes the chime bell to sound the Nine Palaces, so as to know the entry of outsiders and alert for defence. The chime bell is now the sound of ringing in the ears. Hearing it, one crosses the hands to cover the ears, and prays: “The infant is in the palace, the nine truths are in the chamber; please attend to the divine command, and also observe the inauspicious. The Great One’s flowing fire, with power over ten thousand evils.” After this, strike the ear gate with the hand seventeen times; then one should feel the face warm, a good sign. If a cold sensation is felt at the head, this is evil qi entering. One must quickly lie down and close the eyes, preserving the Supreme One True Lord of the Mysterious Elixir Palace; with the flowing fire bell, flare forth and cast it out, causing the evil qi to immediately exit the ear, the fiery light following behind, brightly illuminating the whole body; after a while it calms. If suddenly within the ears are heard rushing waters or thunderous drums, this is bodily toil and inner loss, extreme injury to the heart storehouse, unable for the pearl truth to be injected and generated, but dissipating and disordering, causing the six palaces to lose their seats, soul and spirit to wail. This is the sign of impending disease and death. Therefore when the Mud Pellet’s law is abandoned, the Nine Palaces lose their order, sorrow and disturbance are reversed and confused, drums sound and disorder reigns, the man desires to change dwelling and abandon the body. The listener must attentively meditate on the Supreme One True Lord, wholly returning to concentrated mind. If the fault be not deep, he may listen and amend. The cause of deafness is the loss of the ear spirit.

The ear is the listening gate of the Emperor Lord. The eye is the sun and moon of the Supreme One. The nose is the hill and mountain of the Three Origins. The mouth is the crimson abyss of the Scarlet Palace. The eyebrows are the flowering canopy of the White Origin. The hair is the forest spirit of the Bright Hall. The tongue is the dragon shaft of Wuying. The teeth are the power of the stomach palace. The hand is the external aid of the gall spirit. The foot is the spiritual gate of the kidney origin. The Yin Pole is the true mechanism of the Cavern Chamber. The one body has a hundred spirits, each belonging to its proper place, not to be neglected or treated lightly.

If suddenly within the ears is heard the sound of gold and jade, the true qi has entered and the Way is about to be completed. If suddenly is heard the sound of string music, the six officers and jade maidens come to guard the person; all indicate the Way is about to be accomplished. One should be hidden and quiet, diligently cultivating, the mind of effort increasing more than before. Thereafter the true person will gradually manifest in form. Unless thou art their master, speak not of this to others.

If within the ears is heard the music of flute and horn, it is an auspicious sign of noble arrival. If cries and shouts are heard, it is an inauspicious sign of lowly arrival. If foul qi is smelled, surely there is foul and filthy business, a sign of unclean and verified disease. Hence the foul qi reveals it. Immediately bathe, burn incense, and sweep the chamber in response; this is the Emperor Lord warning and exhorting man. If fragrant qi is smelled, it means divine officers and spirits attend beside thee, viewing thy condition. At such times one should cultivate all good deeds, practise virtue and kindness, aid the poor and distressed, perform hidden merit, and bestow benevolence and love. The divine officers and spirits will report thee to the Supreme, concerning whether the Way Child is good or bad. The subtlety of the Way must not be neglected; all such signs are such as these. If fragrant qi is smelled, reveal it to none except thy master. If foul qi is smelled, it must be reported, to reveal the sign of crime and contact with filthiness. If blood qi is smelled or blood appears without cause, it portends war and disaster. Quickly flee to the human world, guard the Three Origins Emperor Lords, seek aid, and fast for three months; the calamity will vanish. These are all warnings first given by the Emperor Lords concerning good and ill, to cause fear and caution in regard to misfortune and blessing. When evil signs appear, one should perform secret virtue, plan kindness and rescue; when others cannot, one should do, thus escaping the certain sign of death. Be diligent and maintain constancy.

Above the space between the eyebrows, three parts inward is the Guard Inch Twin Fields; one inch inward is the Bright Hall Palace; two inches inward is the Cavern Chamber Palace; three inches inward is the Elixir Field Palace; four inches inward is the Streaming Pearl Palace; five inches inward is the Jade Emperor Palace. One inch above the Bright Hall is the Heavenly Court Palace; one inch above the Cavern Chamber is the Utmost True Palace; one inch above the Elixir Field is the Mysterious Elixir Palace; one inch above the Streaming Pearl Palace is the Supreme Emperor Palace. In all, the head contains nine palaces. The scriptures of the Bright Hall, Cavern Chamber, Elixir Field, and Streaming Pearl — the Four Palaces — are the Way of true persons among gods and immortals, transmitted in the world. The Mysterious Elixir Scripture is also the essential words of true officials who govern life, the chief lineage of the Four Palaces. This single scripture requires permission granted by the Great Ultimate Emperor Lord before it can be given; then it is issued and bestowed. All who combine the Way of the Five Palaces and practise in the world, and have true names, will encounter it. Unless by bone and fate, this is not heard. There is also the Jade Emperor Palace, where the Jade Pure Spirit Mother abides; the Heavenly Court Palace, where dwells the Supreme Clarity True Maiden; the Utmost True Palace, where dwells the Great Ultimate Empress; and the Supreme Emperor Palace, where dwells the Supreme Lord and Lady. These four palaces are all Female Truth One, the Way surpassing the Male Truth One. There are also precious scriptures, transmitted to perfected true persons. True persons are those not yet perfected, and not to be heard of. The essentials of the Female Truth are likewise not given. The Supreme formerly sent forth the Eight Extreme Scenes, entered the Jade Pavilion, the Three Thousand Jade Maidens attended the True Support Chariot, the Spirit Consort sang chivalrously, and the Divine Queen held the kerchief — all guarding the Female One Way, used to assemble the mysterious morning. This is the root and source of the Supreme, transmitted by the Void Emperor. Though all have these four palaces, those who do not cultivate this Way find the palaces empty. Those who do not fully cultivate the Nine Palaces find the palaces empty; not only the four Female palaces. Within the Elixir Field Palace is always the Emperor Lord; within the Guard Inch always the Great God. No further inquiry; only those who cultivate will see their presence. Those who cultivate are immortals; those who do not, live out their allotted life. The Male and Female One Spirits may both be cultivated by men and women alike, all present without exception; only with utmost diligence and hardship is benefit attained.

To guard the Way of the Mysterious Elixir Supreme One Lord: in evening and night, lying quietly, casting off thoughts, sitting or lying at will, first preserve the Northern Pole Star Purple Qi descending into the Mysterious Elixir Palace; presently the palace is filled, overflowing outside the body, encircling and connecting within and without, united with the Purple Qi. Then preserve the sun entering the Mysterious Elixir Palace, filling it within, amidst the Purple Qi; gazing there, it appears like a pearl of fire in darkness. Then preserve the Supreme Yellow Great One Lord of Supreme Clarity, descending from Northern Pole Purple Qi into the Mysterious Elixir Palace to sit. His name is Guiying, styled Huaxuan, his garments and appearance as above. Then preserve thyself suddenly rising into the Mysterious Elixir Palace, sitting facing the Supreme One Lord, garments at will; following the heart, bowing with knees before him, asking the Way for immortality, speaking at will. Then preserve swallowing Purple Qi thirty times, completed; swallow saliva thirty times, completed. Then preserve the Northern Dipper’s seven stars, within which is red qi, large as a bowstring, descending straight into the Mysterious Elixir Palace. Thereupon the Supreme One Lord and thyself both ride the sun and enter the path of red qi, going directly up to the chief of the Northern Dipper, resting for a long while. This rest is true response. After fourteen years of practice the two will roam together, reaching the mainlines of the Seven Origins. After sixteen years, they will arrive at the Supreme Clarity Palace, receiving books and talismans, commanding eighteen Jade Youths and Jade Maidens each. One night’s preservation suffices, just counting; do not let it slip past the night. Also one may solely cultivate this Way without needing to guard the triune; combined cultivation is beneficial, the spirit reaching perfection swiftly.

On the first, third, seventh, eleventh, and fifteenth days of the month, at midnight, preserve the Supreme One Lord of the Mysterious Elixir Palace, facing outward, emitting blue qi from the mouth, descending into my mouth, swallowing accordingly, fifty times only; then swallow saliva fifty times; utter a slight incantation:

Supreme One True Emperor, Supreme Yellow Purple Lord, named Guiying, styled Huaxuan, golden bed and jade curtain, purple embroidered brocade robes, belt bearing the flowing fire bell, severing evil and destroying treachery, holding the star essence, born head of true, sitting upright emitting qi, causing me to swallow and take in, discoursing with me, feasting in the Mysterious Elixir, refining and cleansing the seven souls, harmonizing the three spirits, true spirit serving and protecting, causing me to fly as immortal, the five viscera self-generated, returning to the white youthful countenance, receiving the Supreme Clarity scripture, governing life and destiny, all wishes and desires, a hundred blessings ever renewed.

Completed, preserve thyself ascending into the palace before the Supreme One and rest. Thus by taking qi to sleep, one shall also dream and respond wondrously. By thus accumulating often, there is a gradual progression to encounter. The Supreme Dragon Scripture says: Sitting upright in the Mysterious Elixir, neither inclined nor crooked, this is the essence of the Way. One should always preserve the Supreme One Purple Qi to encircle the body, and swallow it. One should also always preserve the Supreme One True Lord in the Mysterious Elixir. Thus longevity is without limit, ten thousand evils do not affect; the Way of the Mysterious Elixir is complete.
