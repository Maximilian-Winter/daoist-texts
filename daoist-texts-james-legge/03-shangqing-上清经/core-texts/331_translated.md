### The Supreme Purity Great Lord's Yellow Essence Forty-Four Formulas Scripture

The Great Lord of the Supreme Way, mysterious, spiritual, elegant, and empty, sustains the supreme transformation, comprehends the myriad truths, visits the ten directions, and then summons the eight Emperors. Veiling the waves, he advances at dawn, beheading and extinguishing the six heavens, establishing rightly the three ways, his awe-inspiring edge cleaving the firmament, radiating brilliance ten thousand fathoms high. Then he commands the True Man of the Great Ultimate and the Four Directors of the Supreme Overseers, who attend the Jade Dawn, to open the high chapters of the orthodox cinnabar essentials, to destroy the doctrines of the cold spirits, and so to inaugurate the supreme way of the Eight Assemblies, regulating the crucial principles of the gods and immortals. In all there are forty-four formulas, combined into a catalogue, known collectively as the Book of the Yellow Essence. It was then sealed in a cinnabar bud box, encompassed in a mysterious and spiritual brocade pouch, entrusted to the Left Duke of the Immortal Capital, and stored in the chamber of the seven crystals. Further, thirty-seven Jade Maidens of the Northern Cold were commanded to constantly guard the body of the one who possesses the scripture. In accordance with the clear regulations of the Four Extremities, it was decreed that within seven hundred years, it should be transmitted to three persons.

The “Great Lord’s Yellow Essence Forty-Four Formulas” are all writings from the Nine Heavens, secret texts of the Eight Assemblies. Therefore the Great Lord of the Way commands the Supreme Purity High Immortal and the True Man of the Great Ultimate to compile, classify, and arrange these into forty-four divine yellow formulas, setting out their respective order. These are the doctrines established subsequent to the pacification of the six heavens, as their essence. The chapters herein all proceed from the command of the Most High Sage, written by the hand of the Supreme Overseer; hence the Way is complete and most true, its subtlety surpassing all categories. This is the so-called correct law of the three heavens, whose awe and sincerity subdue the malignant energies of the six heavens and destroy the inauspiciousness of a thousand demons.

Those who have a predestined fate to receive this writing will see it; all are mysterious and robust, summoned to assembly, assuredly having divine immortal allotments. This divine scripture is not transmitted in the secular way: those who reveal it are pierced by the three heavens for treachery, and the imperial lords above are informed of their guilt, treating it as a breach of solemn covenant. Before three years pass, the Great Lord sends the divine soldiers of the Five Emperors to punish the offending person’s body, who dies to become a lower ghost; the seven ancestors and grandparents are examined along with the Water Official.

Those who receive the “Great Lord’s Yellow Essence Forty-Four Formulas Scripture,” the master and disciples each fast for forty-five days, refraining from worldly affairs; they first open by informing the divine spirits and carefully judge if it may be entrusted, then swear the transmission. The oath employs a single jade tally, one foot and five fen in length, one inch and four fen in width, inscribed with the true oath of the Spirit of the Face. Also used is forty feet of yellow essence, two pairs of golden rings, in place of blood-drinking to solemnly declare the agreement. If after receiving the scripture one violates the agreement or breaks the oath, or transmits it to an unqualified person, the punishment is the same as recorded above, and the divine soldiers will punish accordingly. Be most cautious!

The Great Lord of the Way commands the True Man of the Great Ultimate and the attendant Supreme Overseer to jointly compose the “Yellow Essence Divine Scripture Forty-Four Formulas” as follows:

Whoever reads the “Great Cavern True Scripture Thirty-Nine Chapters,” and can understand the subtle sounds, discourse without obstruction on the mysterious, exhaust the profundities, expound and praise the spiritual chapters, amplify sound and echo, comprehend the wonderful principles widely, recite in the quiet chamber, clear and without hindrance — such a person is surely of the talent of the highest immortal. By reading this scripture, one is able to lead the Supreme, command the Nine Trues, share rank with the high immortals, and have complete governance over destiny. According to the “Great Lord’s Yellow Essence Forty-Four Formulas,” one may claim the title of Great Cavern Master. The Great Cavern Master is truly called without kindred, supervising emptiness and leading mystery, communicating with spirits and connecting with subtlety, radiating light to myriad truths, holding position equal to the Great Ultimate High Immortal. This signifies deep research and secret response, not limited by ten thousand directions. If one only has this scripture but does not study it or recite it in secret, one may still undertake the office of Supreme Master and be leader of ghosts and spirits.

Whoever reads the “Great Cinnabar Secret Book Golden Flower Cavern Chamber” and the “Female One Precious Chapter,” and can taste the wandering flavour of the mysterious truth, comprehend the principles of the cavern scriptures, attain dark enlightenment of the obscure paths, roam free in the empty court, touch categories without obstruction, be sincere and faithful to the rare truth, report to the quiet chamber, and secretly wish to communicate with the spirits, that person is perhaps refined and responsive to the Great Essence, ascending and descending the Nine Trues, blending the five spirits, governing the destiny and recording chapters. According to the “Great Lord’s Yellow Essence Forty-Four Formulas,” such a person may claim the title of Three Caves Master and Primordial Spirit True Man. The Primordial Spirit True Man’s rank equals the Emperor One High Immortal. The Emperor One High Immortal supervises the emptiness above non-being, being the supreme true of the total spirits. If one only has this scripture and has not yet attained understanding and response, one may still be the master of the Three Origins and undertake the office of terrestrial Immortal on earth.

Whoever reads the “Great Cinnabar Secret Book Cavern True Mysterious Scripture,” and the matters of Emperor One’s untying, feeding, and nourishing of the hundred spirits, and can diligently research and deeply respond, penetrate mystery and attain spirit, return essence to the mysterious origin, open and scatter the seven scriptures, regulate the obscure and clear obstructions, taste the brightness of the firmament, that person is the mysterious and simple Emperor’s Window, charts the scene of the Three Origins, thoroughly understands spirit and brightness, responds to the meeting at Turtle Mountain. According to the “Great Lord’s Yellow Essence Forty-Four Formulas,” such a person may claim the title of Mysterious Cavern Master, Superior Light True Man. The Superior Light True Man’s rank equals the Nine Palaces High Immortal Grand Master. Such a scripture therefore can greatly mix Emperor One, comprehensively govern the five spirits, the nine spirits attending as overseers, and the three officers governing ministers. If one has not yet cultivated these matters, one may still be master of the Three Heavens, and have the highest office in the terrestrial governance.

Whoever can diligently advance in the three scriptures, expound and explain the strange writings, wander and roam upward in accord, indulge in the flavour of the mysterious and distant, such persons must be recorded in the jade books and beautiful tablets, with golden registers and jade names. Some, at the beginning of receiving the book, see and are granted the spiritual person’s cause; some encounter this assembly and suddenly attain it. Those who obtain this scripture are all tested by the Great Ultimate, examined on their sincere intention, graded in rank, thus already presented before transmission; there is no need to fully venerate the master or bind by blood oath. According to the “Great Lord’s Yellow Essence Forty-Four Formulas,” such a person may claim the title of General Divine Master, Supreme Light Gentleman, and Nine Mysterious Grand Master. If in the assembly there is response and the jade sounds and secret echoes are full, the ten thousand directions all covered, male and female also mingled, then one may ride clouds and dragons, soar in daylight, ascend to the Three Purities, and attain the highest offices of Great Ultimate nobility and high immortality.

Whoever obtains the Great Lord Dragon Book True Tao Scripture, and the Jade Purity Secret Writings of Mysterious Feathers, can understand subtle explanations of the mysterious, discern doubts and interpret the obscure, praise the wonderful principles alongside, touch categories and achieve myriad completions, release aspirations to the morning firmament, and taste the distant pure, such a person must have golden books, jade tallies, jade tablets of the imperial chamber, mysterious true and undulating, clear empty and virtuous. Such talents must be high immortals. In accordance with the “Great Lord’s Yellow Essence Forty-Four Formulas,” they may be called Three Heavens Masters, Supreme True Men. The Supreme True Man’s rank equals the Great Ultimate Immortal Official. If one only has this scripture, then the three officers attend him, the four illuminations govern ministers, the myriad directions conform; by testing one’s observance and not neglecting it, commanding ghosts and communicating with spirits, one must obtain the earth’s true essence.

Whoever diligently tests and deeply moves, indulges in the mysterious truth, purifies by fasting as if reaching perfection, reveres and yearns for immortals, suddenly encounters these three grades of scripture and does not receive them from a master, such persons are all of mysterious meeting and ancient response, registered in the imperial village as true men. There are secret transmissions indicating that one should receive this scripture, and such persons are outstanding and marked by worldly merit. According to the “Great Lord’s Yellow Essence Forty-Four Formulas,” one may receive the secret oath of mysterious covenant and divine rules. One should on a day of the sexagenary cycle, purify and enter the chamber at midnight when life breath is born, sit at ease and close eyes, imitate and calm the brow, click teeth twenty-four times, heart bows to the four directions, then softly chant:

“The Great Lord Nine Spirits, Three Essentials Primordial Essence, Immortal Capital Great Gods, Four Extremities Three Purities, Who formerly obeyed the law of transformation, met at the assembly scripture, mysterious master remote and profound, perused the true forms, solicits the secret covenant, sworn by divine spirits, jade youths attend guard, jade flowers support life, eight vows nine unions, wondrous wisdom communicates with spirits, wishing gods and immortals to fly forth to Jade Purity.”

After the chant, again click teeth twenty-four times, swallow saliva ten times, heart bows before the scripture; then sleep or rise to recite the scripture—there will surely be auspicious response. If constantly practiced, within three years one becomes a scripture master, fulfilling the office of true man and great gentleman. This is the inner method of the Yellow Essence, no need to again seek a master or bind by blood oath. Even the True Men who have received the scripture constantly practice it.

Whoever receives the Great Cavern Three Scriptures method, should secretly and quietly retire to a separate chamber, not mingling with worldly persons, and carefully copy out a complete copy to keep upon the desk. One should always offer incense, and separately place a bed facing east to calm the desk. At the time of vows and petitions, all ceremonies are to be conducted facing each other; scriptures that may be recited must not be placed on the desk.

All Daoists who receive the three grades of true scriptures, the Female One Cavern Mystery Secret Feather Chapter, should diligently yearn for the supreme covenant, respond with divine spirits, purify their hearts and fasting, firmly hold the Way and sustain life, persist without ceasing, taste brightness and mystery, then such persons will surely attain the high immortals. In accordance with the “Great Lord’s Yellow Essence Forty-Four Formulas,” they may perform the eight morning and three morning inner ritual secret methods. On days of Jia Yin, Wu Shen, Geng Shen, Ding Si, Ji Si, Gui Hai, and Yi Hai, at dawn enter the chamber, burn incense on both sides, imitate and calm the brow, click teeth twenty-four times, bow heart to the four directions, and softly chant:

“The Great Lord Supreme Spirit, Three Essentials Primordial Essence, Cautiously on this auspicious day, inwardly perform the true scripture, spirit youths and jade maidens scatter incense in the empty court, so that my spirits and immortals, heaven and earth incline mutually.”

After the chant, quickly close both eyes, so that inner and outer darkness combine, without mutual hearing or sight. Then click teeth thirty times, swallow saliva three times, open eyes, all completed. This is called the eight morning three origins inner ritual secret method. If constantly practiced, it makes one communicate with spirits clearly, respond finely to the three origins, truly meet the wonderful response, ascend and descend the Great Mystery, attend the scripture jade maidens, petition the son for life; immortals do not die, heaven and earth incline mutually. Those not yet having received the scripture who practice this for three years may become scripture masters and obtain spiritual auspices and blessings.

Whoever cultivates and receives the Great Cavern True Scripture and the Female One strange writings, should have a separate chamber, not mingling with others, always place the scripture in a clean and neat place on the desk, offer incense morning and evening, present wishes for the human world, and internally expunge the registers of sin. On the third, seventh, and twenty-first days of the month, the attending scripture jade maidens then report a person’s faults to the Three Origins and jointly with the Emperor One Lord thoroughly explain the person’s offences. On these days one should enter the chamber, burn incense, click teeth thrice and seven times, and softly chant:

“The Great Lord Divine Formula, Great Cavern True Scripture, formerly by fortune met with the divine spirits, opened the shade of seven diagrams, received the assembly of the Three Purities; if there is shadow of sin, emperor lords scatter the spirits, the three images open brightness, the Supreme Emperor combines form, commanding me to fly as immortal, godly truth long-lived.”

After the chant, again click teeth twice and seven times, bow heart to the four directions, open eyes, all completed. Those who constantly practice this have secret response from the Three Origins, the emperor lords pardon faults, and all reported sins are not enacted.

All Daoists who hold in mind the supreme Way and cultivate the affairs of Emperor One are forbidden to see death doors, blood, and filthy things. If the omen sees them, they may receive the Three Lights secret cleansing and defilement elimination inner method. One should use one zhu of true cinnabar, scatter it in inner water, and wash the eyes and rinse the mouth, also wash hands and feet; then enter the chamber and proper bed, clasp palms, click teeth twice and seven times, bow heart to the four directions, then softly chant:

“The Three Origins Supreme Way, Emperor One guards the body, Commander of Life son, Five Spirits Yellow Peace, blood and corpses scatter and vanish, evil filth sinks and disappears, seven liquids entwine and pour, five viscera flourish, command my spirits and immortals to long enjoy virtue and constancy.”

After the chant, quickly close eyes and cause breath to act, so that inner and outer darkness combine, without hearing or sight. After a long time one feels a slight heat in the body as a sign. Then click teeth seven times, swallow saliva thrice, all completed. This is called the Three Lights secret cleansing and defilement elimination inner method.

Whoever cultivates and receives the supreme Way, and wishes to see visions and understand, when opening the box and reading scripture, must burn incense on both sides, bow heart before the scripture, click teeth thrice, then softly chant:

“Jade Emperor Supreme Way, above hears the Three Purities, auspicious day fasting in sincerity, dare to open the divine scripture, ten thousand tests secret and hidden, all directions succeed, jade youths attend guard, jade flowers scatter fragrance, above report to the Three Origins, with me long life.”

After the chant, open the scripture, then recite. This is called the Great Emperor’s method of opening scripture. Let the jade maidens and jade youths attend, burn incense, and invoke descending spirits, reporting above to the Nine Heavens.

All Daoists who receive and study the cavern scripture, and cultivate Emperor One’s affairs, must not reveal the name of Emperor One Lord to those of differing will. To reveal it is to offend the Great Mystery’s hidden examination; if one offends thrice, then the five spirits abandon the house, and one may no longer become an immortal. After three offenses, one dies to become a lower ghost, with no hope of immortality.

All Daoists after receiving the scripture always in the morning and evening invoke the name of Emperor One Lord, first clicking teeth thrice, then softly chant:

“Ascending Brahma, the Senior Elder of Seven Spirits, Emperor One’s governance, Five Spirits Yellow Peace, ascending to the Nine Heavens, united with the emperor, entreating to fly immortal, seven ancestors and fetus infants, absolving faults and releasing sins, ascending to Jade Purity.”

After the chant, again click teeth seven times, swallow saliva thrice; this is to preserve spirit, release sins, and entreat the emperor for immortality. If practiced seven years, the divine spirits respond, the emperor lord delights, the mysterious mother guides birth, the five spirits constantly endure, the seven ancestors’ sins are absolved, receiving the fetus of southern immortals, living long and not dying, rising in daylight morning.

All Daoists who receive the student’s method must not mention matters of death. If they do, then vital breath changes and does not dwell with the emperor; hence death breath enters and the living spirit abandons, so evil breath roams the corpse, manifesting in holes between; this is the gradual approach of sickness and death. Those who receive Emperor One to preserve the five spirits, cultivate the Nine Palaces mixed emperor lord must be cautious not to feel resentment or wish for their own death. After receiving the scripture, those who talk forty times or more may no longer become true men; the attending scripture jade youths report the person’s sins to the emperor lord, treating it as the crime of fleeing life. Such omens must be examined in the mysterious void, receive blame from the Great Lord, and before three years the body will perish. This is the rule of the Yellow Essence, the usage of the Great Mystery.

All who cultivate and receive the supreme Way, and practice the Female One and Emperor One affairs, all scriptures must be offered with incense and ritual chants to the divine spirits; the body must not offend with arrogance or slander the scripture’s methods to those of differing will. Those who commit these faults are recorded by the attending scripture jade youths, and their faults reported above to the emperor lord. Speaking to one person reduces one jade youth and one jade maiden, returning them to the Three Essentials chamber. If trespassing three persons, the jade youths all leave the person. Sometimes by water or fire disaster, the scripture is suddenly lost or unintentionally left behind. If transmitted to an unqualified person, then the Three Heavens Destiny officers punish the body, who dies to become a lower ghost, long conscripted to the Water Official. This is the imperial lord’s rule and table of penalties.

All who cultivate Emperor One affairs and practice the supreme Way to preserve spirit must be careful not to see corpses or blood filth. If one sees a dead body once, one may not perform affairs for a year, losing a year’s merit; however this Emperor One rule commonly remits penalties for the past and also blocks those to come. If one sees twenty-four corpses, one may no longer cultivate Emperor One for immortality.

All who cultivate and receive the supreme Way, and the Female One and Emperor One affairs, the vital breaths of the three souls and five spirits in the body are constantly permeating the clothing and coverings, and the seven souls and nine spirits’ residual essence constantly dwell beneath shoes and slippers. Therefore Daoist students do not mingle seats and sleep together, thus their rough clothes do not borrow breath not their own; they dislike that shoes and slippers be fouled by earth and filth, and do not wish to let outsiders touch their belongings so as to disturb the three souls.

All Daoists who breathe out and take in to harmonize breath, preserve spirit and wear the rosy clouds, cultivate the path to long life, must be careful not to eat the five pungent vegetables, nor indulge in the diseases of wine and lust. Hence the ancients said: the five pungents are axes and hatchets cutting the viscera; wine and lust are coffins and tombs that destroy the body. Those who can cut off the harm of axes and hatchets, and block the dwelling of coffins and tombs, may then cross the path of life and death and extinguish the road of gods and immortals.

Those who desire to dispel fear and dread should first sound the celestial bell at the left teeth twenty-six times, then close breath, and loudly sigh five times; this always repels essence, evil and harmful breath. At night before sleep, one should stroke the heart three times, close eyes, and softly chant:

“The Supreme Spirit Nine Palaces, Emperor One guards the chamber, the hundred gods assume their places, souls and spirits harmonize, long life and immortality, blocking and lessening evil and misfortune.”

After the blessing, sleep. This is called the nine palaces secret charm to put souls to rest. If constantly practiced, it makes one’s souls and spirits peaceful and always preserves good fortune.

When transmitting the supreme Way, the master possessing the scripture must first seek response, then transmit. One should enter the chamber, burn incense, secretly wish to the divine spirits, then bow heart before the scripture, softly chant:

“The Great Lord Primordial Sovereign, Immortal Capital Great God, this day is auspicious, eight vows open and declare, desiring to transmit a certain supreme Way, dare to inform the spiritual origin, unknown if permitted, must await approval before declaring.”

After the chant, sleep and surely obtain spirit response. The person knows their own goodness or not, carefully judging if the method may be entrusted.

The method of scripture masters transmitting the scripture is first to bow heart to the four directions to move the divine spirits, being the chief master’s lord. Then the master holds the scripture, rises, looks to heaven and chants, informing and swearing to the spirits, making a secret covenant. The name of the recipient is declared, the great gods aroused, the grade of scripture received stated, the regulations and articles inscribed, and an agreement pronounced. After the chant, the disciple bows twice, kneels to receive, then bows twice more. This is the true man’s internal method of informing the spirits by covenant, not requiring full bloodletting to seal the secret agreement.

When the scripture master transmits, they should follow the above method, purify and fast in a separate place, avoid worldly affairs, inform the spirits and seek secret response, then transmit. If response is contrary or the spirit sensed is inauspicious, this is the heavenly spirit revealing root and not permitting transmission. If the disciple does not obey the spirits and transmits in violation, according to Yellow Essence’s rule, they will be examined in the dark void, blamed by the Great Lord, and before three years pass, the body will perish; there is no hope of immortality.

Those who cultivate Emperor One affairs and wish to make offerings and petitions must be cautious not to bow their heads. If they bow, they overturn the Nine Heavens, move the myriad truths, the divine palaces return, the mud pellet hangs inverted, the Heavenly Emperor laments in the upper palace, Emperor One weeps in the central field. If such occur repeatedly, then holding thoughts is of no benefit, the Three Trues abandon the palace, the seven spirits disperse, the mysterious dwelling receives misfortune; this is the utmost taboo of the Great Lord’s Five Spirits. Therefore the ancients, true men, only hold their hearts to bow the head, moving essence and response in action, not relying on the cheek to pray to the spirits.

Those who cultivate the Way of Emperor One, true men and Daoist priests must not carry out worship; this is also the taboo of the emperor lord and five spirits. If one has sincere thoughts and performs rites and offerings, then only bow the heart, not visibly stooping. Those who do not cultivate and receive the supreme Way must not be like the outer scholars.

When Daoists enter the chamber to fast sincerely, and have stored cultivation, if suddenly there is divine response and wondrous effect, there will be auspicious dreams, all indicating the Way is about to succeed. The omen should diligently cultivate to perfection, and respond to the highest assembly; if so unceasingly, then the true spirit jade maidens will come to rest at the person’s bed. When lying down to sleep, one should face upward in correct posture, clasp palms, click teeth three and seven times, close eyes, and softly chant:

“Highest Supreme Child, Cinnabar Emperor bearing the pearl, Emperor One venerable, condensed Heavenly Elder Non-being, seven spirits ascend response, five gods return and roam, spirit youths and jade maidens, opening and falling pair of talismans, seven stars rise together, ascending the Morning Hill.”

After the blessing, again click teeth three and seven times, swallow saliva thrice, open eyes, all completed. This is called the Emperor One’s retaining spirit charm to respond and meet the immortals. If so practiced for three years, the Nine Heavens’ gods and Great Mystery jade maidens will descend to guard the person.

When Daoists enter the chamber to fast sincerely, and have stored cultivation, if frequently there are inauspicious things, strange blood and light, various ghosts and evil spirits come to test the person, the omen should perform the Northern Emperor’s prayer to exorcise ghosts and kill evil spirits. First click teeth thirty-six times, then chant:

“The two images revolve and overturn, mysterious One’s banner, seven spirits guard life, ascend to the Three Purities, twin emperors drive aside, great soldiers of Hebolo, three hundred thousand men, attend the divine camp, great beasts a hundred kinds, emit awe and restrain essence, wave swords to pursue evil, behead and fall demons and spirits, commanded by the divine lord, destroy a thousand heresies.”

After the blessing, again click teeth thirty-six times. This is called the Northern Emperor’s prayer to exorcise ghosts and kill evil spirits formula. All divine spirits and true energies who hear this prayer come to serve and guard the person, and the inauspicious energies immediately die.

When a Daoist sleeps alone in mountain forests and is frequently assailed by mountain spirits and evil ghosts testing him, he should click teeth twice and seven times, close breath, and softly chant:

“Yesterday I was summoned by the emperor, to lead true essence, commanding me to seal and govern the Five Mountains, to strike and cut Feng Mountain, mountain spirits and myriad souls all come before the emperor, seven gods lead and guide, Three Origins govern truth, if there be any small demons, immediately beheaded and destroyed, mountain spirits and marsh officials, hasten to attend, the divine master’s mouth command, report to the Three Purities, as with the Great Cavern method.”

After the chant, again click teeth twice and seven times. This is the emperor lord’s method of capturing spirits, chanting and striking mountain spirits and a hundred ghosts. All mountain gods, earth deities, and ancestral spirits of rooms and shrines, true energies of the gods, when hearing this chant, all come to wield whips and attend, divine soldiers guard, as if lodging with ten thousand people.

When a Daoist hides in mountain forests, meditates and moves spirits, or reads the cavern scriptures and makes sounds, often the Northern Emperor’s great demon tries and is defeated by him. Whenever it approaches dusk, one should click teeth thirty-six times, then chant:

“Northern Emperor Great Demon King, serving before the emperor lord, springs and streams spirits, Four Illuminations Feng Mountain, a thousand heresies mixed form, nine-headed single body, divine tiger releases poison, beheading and destroying thunder and quake, divine lord emits spells, those slain have no kin, Supreme Micro has command, governing mountains and rivers, ringing bells thrown together, radiating the Nine Heavens, wind and fire campaign and punish, divine edge ten formations, evil tests crouch and perish, myriad spirits beheaded and destroyed, demon poison dares arise, closed the three passes, request according to cavern laws, none disobey commands.”

After the chant, again click teeth thirty-six times. This is called the Three Heavens correct law spell to subdue demons and spirits formula. If constantly practiced, then divine soldiers guard, mountains and rivers govern essence, a thousand heresies are closed, ten thousand tests do not interfere.

Whoever cultivates the Great Cavern method and Emperor One and Emperor One affairs, always at dusk should enter chamber, burn incense, bow heart before scripture, then click teeth twice and seven times, then softly chant:

“Emperor One Venerable, Emperor One mysterious scripture, five clouds scatter brightness, permeating the Three Purities, jade youths and jade maidens, burn incense to serve spirits, above wish to open and declare, unite with me in form, cause me to become immortal, long prosper with virtue and constancy.”

After the chant, again click teeth twice and seven times. This is called the Emperor One’s burning incense, opening and declaring vows, and uniting with spirits method. If constantly so, then jade flowers attend guard, spirits assist truth, scattering fragrant clouds, reach the Nine Heavens, and in the coming three years, the jade maidens and jade youths will all appear to the person.

When a Daoist enters the chamber to fast sincerely and has wishes to cultivate, at the time of taking food one should hold a jade pestle in the left hand three times, then softly chant:

“The Two Mysterious Supreme Ways, Four Extremities clear and cold, Emperor One Lord, Hundred Spirits Yellow Peace, receiving grain from the Three Palaces, irrigating the spleen spirit, offering to the Great Harmony, tasting the five fragrances, soul and fetus destiny, seven liquids flow and cease, hundred passes harmonize, five viscera brightly flourish, twin emperors unite brilliance, flying and ascending to Supreme Purity.”

After eating, again hold the pestle three times. This is called the soul and fetus receiving fragrance, hundred spirits feasting grain method. If constantly practiced, one’s divine spirit and breath harmonize, soul and spirit are peaceful, evil is warded off and tests removed, and virtue and constancy are preserved.

When a Daoist is to arrange hair or to wash head and scatter hair, first click teeth seven times, then softly pray:

“Great Emperor scatters splendour, mysterious return great god, today is auspicious day, arrange hair and wash dust, repel evil and remove disease, long live immortals.”

After the prayer, complete hair dressing, click teeth seven times, all completed. This is called the Great Emperor’s dispersing splendour hair dressing inner method, causing one to be free from illness all year, ears and eyes clear, and head and brain free from pain.

When a Daoist enters the chamber to burn incense and has cultivation wishes, first click teeth three times, then softly chant:

“Jade flower scatters brightness, nine breaths combine as smoke, incense clouds enmesh, swiftly ascending the Nine Heavens, serving incense jade maidens, above report before emperor, command me to long life, be a true immortal in the world, all directions and wishes without fail.”

After the chant, bow heart and concentrate, also fitting the wishes presented. This is called the Great Constant secret charm to scatter incense, the Nine Heavens descending spirit chamber, and the method to wish to meet gods and immortals.

When a Daoist travels alone, lodging in mountain forests or temples, where there are many demonic spirits and evil ghosts, first click teeth thirty-six times, close breath, softly chant:

“Great Emperor Yang Essence, Four Pillars secret passes, thousand heresies and myriad poisons dare to face me, great beast with heavy jaws, gutting belly and liver, divine lord’s envoy, guards the camp and multitude, yellow robed master soldiers, cut down demon souls, behead and destroy a thousand demons, crush and fall mountain traitors, sever lineage and wipe out species, order to behead and destroy, jade emperor’s supreme command, cleanse and purge the Three Origins.”

After the chant, again click teeth thirty-six times. This is called the Great Constant wielding spirit inner charm, to block and destroy ten thousand demons method. If constantly recited, divine soldiers appear to guard, ten thousand ghosts obey, a thousand heresies die and crouch.

When a Daoist is about to sleep and undress, first click teeth three times, stand and pray:

“Receiving command from Great Emperor, ascending Nine Palaces, hundred spirits settle in place, arrayed attending divine lords, souls and spirits harmonize, five viscera flourish, hundred potions mysterious infusion, seven liquids empty and fill, fire bells interchange brightness, destroy ghosts and remove misfortune, above wish for gods and immortals, always live without end.”

After the prayer, again click teeth three times, undress and lie down. This is called the Great Emperor’s sleep spirit destroying ghosts and misfortunes method. It causes one’s essence to be clear and bright, free from illness, with soul and spirit constantly present, and often auspicious response.

When a Daoist bathes body and washes hands and face, first approach water and click teeth three times, then softly pray:

“Four great open mysteries, heaven and earth are constant, mysterious water washes filth, repels and removes inauspiciousness, twin emperors guard the gates, seven spirits secure the chamber, cloud ferry refines and irrigates, myriad breaths mingle and prosper, inner and outer virtue and constancy, preserve this yellow robe.”

After the prayer, again click teeth three times, then bathe and wash. This is called the washing of filth and removing misfortune seven chambers blessing method. Those who constantly practice it have spirits and blood purified and remove all evil breath.

When a Daoist at night travels or is in a place of fear and trembling heart, click teeth twice and seven times, then chant:

“I am a little true king, master of the three heavens, formerly received the Great Lord’s divine formula, the script to kill evil, night walking wandering corpses, seven evil demon souls, nine ghosts band together, thousand demons form groups, great Hebolo troops, great beasts arrayed, wielding cleavers to strike myriad heresies, dragons and beacons seven alone, pursue evil without interval, jade emperor’s divine spell, wield sword east and west, destroy evil and remove demons, ten thousand ghosts suspended, three heavens correct law, all as I say.”

After the chant, again click teeth twice and seven times. This is called the Three Heavens correct law to expel the six heavens’ secret charm. Ghosts struck by this spell are all blind in eyes and lame in feet, naturally dying out. Wherever one journeys in fear, by following thus there is no need to travel at night. If constantly recited, ten thousand demons crouch and tests perish.

When a Daoist prays to destroy the Three Corpses method, always on the last and first days of the month, and on days Jia Yin, Geng Yin, and Geng Shen, the seven souls, wandering corpses, and various blood ghosts within the body report sins to Heaven, and return injuries within the body; or wander to other lands, called external ghosts, cooperating to become heretical thieves. Hence evil dreams occur intertwined with the sleeping soul, illnesses afflict the spirit chamber. The cause of evil dreams and sickness is the seven souls and wandering corpses. On these days one should bathe in common cleanliness, wear clean clothes, burn incense entering the chamber, concentrate ardently, not engage in other affairs. At the hour of night’s birth of breath, or at dusk, lie facing east, clasp palms, first click teeth thrice and seven times, then softly chant:

“Seven spirits and five gods, eight vows and four declarations, above report to spiritual life, central emperor twin truths, register souls and refine spirits, block and destroy evil essences, blood ghosts and wandering corpses, filth and obstruction long extinguished, harmonize my life gate, close my death door, if there be dark fate, listen and respond before emperor, cause me to long live, seize years and constantly endure, Great Emperor’s method, dare to report to the Three Origins.”

After the chant, again click teeth thrice and seven times, swallow saliva ten times, all completed. This is called the Great Emperor’s soul regulation and corpse destruction spirit spell method. Blood ghosts and seven souls struck by this spell all perish beneath the death corpse, souls bright and spirits soft, receive transformation within the Three Palaces, repel evil and remove illness, make one’s spirit immortal. If constantly recited, one will never tire of darkness.

Whenever holding thoughts of the supreme Way and chanting to remove the Three Corpses, one should always gather white angelica root and green agarwood, combine with eastern flowing water, boil to extract the juice, and bathe with it to repel all blood ghosts and evil breath; also commonly burn harmonious incense to summon the divine spirits. If there is no green agarwood, one may use white angelica alone.

On days Geng Shen and Jia Yin, these are days when blood ghosts and wandering corpses are in charge and join together. On these days heavenly breath joins, seven souls compete in confusion, licentious filth mixes with truth, evil essences radiate, bright laws toil, seven gods scatter. Each such day one must purify and fast separately, not mingling with other seats, must not see spouses, nor sleep in the same bed. Also one must not compete for wealth and lust; such conduct is not the Way. Whenever burning incense and sensing breath, cultivating and reciting spells, one may also recite scriptures to blend spirits. If thinking of the cavern chamber Emperor One’s affairs, only let essence and truth be the intent.

If a Daoist suddenly has an inauspicious dream, or dreams of fighting with others, or being arrested, this is also the work of the seven souls and wandering corpses. Or they lead external ghosts to enter the original residence, or the three souls scatter and obscure, the five spirits fight and rage, or are bound and unable to come and return; thus causing inauspicious dreams and misfortune, and the onset of disaster. When lying down to sleep, one should position correctly facing upward, clasp palms, click teeth thrice and seven times, then softly chant:

“Nine Heavens Supreme Emperor, four gates and eight spirits, seven chambers and two mysteries, three essentials primordial essence, Emperor One Peach Health, ascend to the Three Purities, please inform the emperor lord, govern destiny and yellow peace, swiftly summon the seven souls, examine the spiritual court, if there be misfortune, seven corpse ghost soldiers, following calls of twin truths, flow as candle to refine form, Great Emperor Supreme, behead and destroy evil essence, harmonize the three souls, wandering corpse flows and disperses, spirit returns to severed dwelling, directing toward virtue and constancy, let me be immortal, long preserve years.”

After the chant, again click teeth twice and seven times, swallow saliva ten times. This is called the Great Emperor spirit blessing to repel dreams and remove evil method. Those who practice it have their three souls harmonized and refined, seven souls controlled, divine spirit and breath correct, corpse filth dispersed, and the ghosts named by the chant are already received in hell. After three chants, unless there is spiritual response and auspicious effect, one will no longer dream of the unusual.

Whenever a Daoist worships and petitions the gods and spirits, concentrates on the supreme Way, and performs secret charms, all must burn incense and bow heart, softly chant only, not letting others hear. If one desires to chant to exterminate the six heavens and destroy all evil ghosts, one may only utter a low voice, not a loud or high one, to avoid being understood by bystanders. When reading and reciting, one may do so at will.

On the eight festival days, all are days of the Three Heavens’ immortal spirits, days appointed for feasts and ceremonies. The omen who cultivates rites and petitions at morning ceremonies must fast on these days; as for the new and full moon morning ceremonies, these are not supreme methods.

On such days, when one wishes to perform rites, petitions, and present charms, one should first click teeth seven times, bow heart to the four directions, then softly chant:

“Supreme Purity Jade Emperor, Three Essentials Primordial Sovereign, Great Supreme High Spirit, Immortal Capital Great God, this day auspicious, open and declare eight vows, highest wish to fly to the firmament, long live the immortals, middle wish heaven and earth unite brightness, wind and cloud, lowest wish five viscera, with me always, next wish seven ancestors, release and remove errors, also wish emperor lord, to cut off birth roots, six wishes for eternal wisdom fully opened, seven wishes to destroy ghosts, behead and cut six heavens, eight wishes to lower spirits, fully hear east and west, highest wish one union, none not as wished, wish gods and immortals, ascend court of Three Origins.”

After the chant, bow again as at the beginning, also fitting wishes presented, seeking release of the seven ancestors’ faults and one’s own sins, to continue after the rites. This is called the Three Origins Eight Morning secret charm, the essential method for highest wish to gods and immortals. If practiced three years, the seven ancestors and grandparents, and one’s own sins, are all resolved. Then the jade flowers descend to guard, divine spirits respond, eight vows open and declare, surely obtaining the essential covenant of spiritual immortals.

The foregoing Supreme Purity Great Lord’s Yellow Essence Forty-Four Formulas are the Great Lord Supreme Way’s proper breath Three Heavens method, later compiled into a wondrous scripture as a regulation and table. According to this scripture’s text, the divine method is truly subtle and wondrous; those who cultivate life may use it to govern the body, a certain and efficacious divine formula. Unless of the Three Origins’ elegant tablets and imperial jade tallies, the Forty-Four Formulas must not be contaminated. This divine formula is wondrous beyond all registers and hidden within the imperial chamber. When transmitting, all must be high immortals of superior rank, examined by the Great Ultimate, again consult the Jade Emperor, formally report the Great Lord, then may be granted it. The so-called Three Heavens right method, linked in alliance for seven generations, is not transmitted to those not of mysterious and noble nature. If one does not venerate the heavenly prohibition, rashly divulges the secret method, the allied ancestors shall be closed in hell, the body examined by the Water Official, can immortality be hoped for?
