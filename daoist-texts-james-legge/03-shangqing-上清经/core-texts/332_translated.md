The Most High Jade True Hidden Origin Inner Observation employs the six jia and the day of the six ding in the ten-day cycle, at midnight—the time of vital breath—to display the Heavenly Origin, where the embryo is bound and firmly consolidated. The seven souls ascend to report; the three spirits record offenses; violations against the seven ancestors, accumulation of penalties in the three yin; therefore there is the method of elimination, to relieve offenses and sins. Those who practice this Way are called those who seek immortality.

Always on the day of jiazi in the cycle, the dingmao day, at midnight, one sits peacefully on the bed in the sleeping chamber, facing north, receiving with the hands. After knocking the teeth seven times completely, then one looks up to preserve the seven stars, making them shine brightly in the north. After some time, one softly utters the incantation: "First, Supreme Star, Mysterious Pivot, Bright Yang, Soul Spirit, Most High Nine Lords." Seven calls are made, then one further prays: "May it be granted to remove the yang sins and yang offenses from the seven generations past down to this very body; all be made to vanish; all intentions fulfilled; all affairs accordant to the heart; flying steps of the seven origins, inclining in accord with Heaven; name recorded in the Dipper Morning; prolonging the record for a hundred million years." When finished, one preserves the Big Dipper’s seven stars coming down from Heaven, flying into my mouth, straight to the heart. One preserves the star light, making the inward and outward clear and penetrating, deeply meditating on it—this is called resolving the morning knot, the internal reflection of the Superior Way.

On the jiaxu day, dingchou, at midnight, in the sleeping chamber on the bed, sitting peacefully facing north, receiving with the hands, first knocking the teeth seven times completely, then looking up to preserve the seven stars, shining brightly in the north. After some time, softly incant: "Second, Original Star, Northern Platform, Yin Essence, Heavenly Xuan, Soul Spirit, Most High Jade Nine Lords." Seven calls are made, then one prays: "May it be granted to remove the yin sins and yin offenses from the seven generations past down to this very body; all be made to vanish; the six qi fill abundantly; the four spirits act in emptiness; flying through the seven origins; name inscribed in the Jade Book; ascending to Purple Clarity; riding the Mysterious Chariot without obstruction; entering and exiting auspiciously; in accord with Heaven’s talisman." When finished, one preserves the Big Dipper’s seven stars coming from the midst of Heaven, flying into my mouth, straight to the lungs, making clear and penetrating inward and outward, the five viscera distinct. Also preserves the star coming into the mouth, making the mouth feel the light scatter in all directions, the mouth feels slight warmth—this is the proof of the star essence entering.

Those who think upon the seven origins, preserving the Way of the Nine Mornings, do not share the bed or sleeping mat with others; likewise with clothing. If man and woman lie on the same mat to rest, they are then registered in the offense records of the Northern Mystery. If one violates the defiled and filthy, calamity descends to Hell. Master and friend breathing the same breath do not constitute offense.

On the jiashen day, dinghai, at midnight, in the sleeping chamber on the bed, sitting peacefully facing north, receiving with the hands, knocking the teeth seven times completely, then looking up to preserve the seven stars, letting them shine brightly in the north.

Seven calls are made, then one prays: "May it be granted to remove from the seven ancestors past down to this very body all death sins and death offenses, accumulated evil and secret faults, offenses against Heaven, Earth, Water, and the Three Officials; all be made to vanish; eyes bright and penetrating vision; clear inspection of the hidden and obscure; flying through the seven origins; name recorded in Supreme Clarity; serving myriad spirits; ascending to the Jade Court; riding the radiance, traversing the void; inclining with Heaven." When finished, one preserves the Big Dipper’s seven stars coming down from Heaven, flying into my mouth, straight to the liver, making light shine upon the five viscera, inward and outward clear. When finished, the heart preserves facing north to bow twice; after bowing, swallowing saliva nine times, one may also rise to bow.

Then pray: "May it be granted to remove the offenses and sins committed and enacted, robberies, treacheries, rebellions, chaos, and those who attract the records of imperial officers, all be made to vanish; all hundred ailments healed; body and qi auspicious and firm; name inscribed on the Immortal Terrace; engraved in Supreme Clarity; commanding myriad spirits; flying through the nine brightnesses." When finished, preserve the Big Dipper’s seven stars coming down from Heaven, flying into my mouth, straight to the kidneys, making light bright and penetrating, the five viscera distinct. When finished, swallow saliva twenty-one times. The yang day’s star is preserved in the left kidney; the yin day’s star in the right kidney. One day is yang; two days are yin. This Way especially forbids seeing blood, filth, stench, and eating mixed foods, meat, or spicy things; otherwise, the above offenses extend to the seven ancestors, descending calamity reaches the body, death leads to becoming a lower ghost, named removal from the imperial gate.

On the evening of the month’s last day, before the cock’s crow on the first day of the new moon, one should sit peacefully on the bed in the sleeping chamber, facing east, receiving with the hands, knocking the teeth seven times completely, then looking up to preserve the Big Dipper’s seven stars, making them shine brightly to my left face. After some time, softly pray: "Seventh, Pass Star, Mysterious Yang, Heavenly Pass, Jade Radiance, Great Brightness, Most High Jade Emperor, Dao Lord." Seven calls are made.

When finished, preserve the Big Dipper’s seven stars coming down from Heaven, flying into my mouth, entering through the mouth to the pupils of the eyes, shining into both eyes, causing inward and outward self-illumination, preserving and seeing the five viscera, making them distinct. On yang days the preserved star enters the left pupil; on yin days the preserved star enters the right pupil.

On the jia day of the six jia days, at midnight, in the sleeping chamber on the bed, lying or sitting with head turned as desired, holding firmly and closing breath to calm the spirit, after some time, knocking the teeth nine times completely, preserving the nine stars of the Big Dipper, making them shine brightly above the nape, causing the nine stars’ light to shine, two stars before the dipper’s handle shining mutually and illuminating this place. Then softly pray: "Eighth, Emperor Star, Most High Jade Emperor, Divine Eight Radiance Origin Lord; Ninth, Revered Star, Supreme Subtle Jade Emperor Lord, Divine Great Origin Seven Morning Origin Lord." Nine calls are made, then pray: "May it be granted to remove the sins and offenses of the nine ancestors and grandparents from the seven generations past down to this very body, all hills, mountains, rivers, sources, great and small; all sins named in the death records; hidden and evil, treacheries, concealments, deceits, numbering billions, listed on the ghost emperor Feng Mountain; death sins and fault rules recorded on the black register of the Northern Nine Origins Supreme Ultimate True Person; I beg the Nine Origins Most High Emperor, Revered Jade Mysterious Lord, may all matters be made to vanish; flying through the seven paths; ascending to Jade Clarity; journeying with the Great Void; riding the radiance of morning birth; feasting in the Eight Plain Courts; inclining with the sun; attending the imperial consort; governing myriad spirits." When finished, preserve the Big Dipper’s seven stars coming down from Heaven, flying into the Mud Pellet Purple Chamber, making clear and bright the Mud Pellet, causing light to penetrate the entire body and five viscera, making inward and outward permeated with purple light and cloud qi, reaching utmost flourishing, deeply meditating on it. When finished, swallow saliva twenty-seven times.

If on the six jia days and the month’s last day, or six ding days, the preserved thoughts are near to each other, one may adjust and measure accordingly, not requiring them to be frequently and closely successive. Every matter is to be effected thus, only requiring perfect completeness in the true method. Thus the Way of Supreme Return to Origin for the Removal of Offense is completed.

The Most High Concealed Five Passage Days are sealed within the Jade Box of the Five Sacred Mountains. The Hidden Return to Origin Way is hidden in the Palace of the Nine Mornings. Having cultivated the Five Passages, one then proceeds the Return to Origin; the Five Passages open at the imperial beginning; the Return to Origin closes at the Mysterious End. Therefore, those who cultivate the Five Passages and practice the Seven Origins Return Hidden Way neither eat blood, fish, meat, nor pungent food; if one sees corpses or filth, the offender receives the trial of the Great Mystery. The Five Passages are the Most High’s auspicious days; the Return to Origin is the Most High’s renewal day. Not knowing the Five Passages, one cannot remove offenses and sins; not knowing the Return to Origin Hidden Way, one cannot be enrolled among the Most True Ones. Always on these days think to preserve auspicious matters, first thanking the body’s sins and offenses, so-called releasing the seven generations past and escaping penal names. This is not shown to the immortals in the Nine Palaces. All those who cultivate in the Deep Chamber and Purple Chamber matters, and preserve the Nine Origins and Seven Origins, at first rising or lying down to sleep, and at the beginning and end of meals, first softly pray:

"Five stars, five passages; six harmonies, Purple Chamber; Return to Origin, Hidden Way; dispersing the seven mornings; souls born of the Mysterious Father; the father transforms one into the spirit; souls born of the Mysterious Mother; the mother transforms two to give life; those governing my sinews and bones are the Young Lords; those preserving my essence and breath are the White Origin; long life and lasting vision; flying immortals in the ten heavens." When finished, do not let the ears hear the prayer’s sound. This is the Most High Hidden Prayer, to remove evil qi, to bring forth the spirit, to cause man to never grow weary or dull throughout life.
