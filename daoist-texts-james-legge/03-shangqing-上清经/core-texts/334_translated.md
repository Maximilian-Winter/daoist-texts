**Preface to the Supreme Concealment Scripture**

The Lofty Three Sovereigns, Most Perfect, Profound, Mysterious, Cavernous, Upper Cavernous Dao Lord said: The Golden Tiger and Phoenix Writing True Talisman is issued by the Most Perfect Parents of the Nine Heavens; the Most Perfect Patriarch received it from the Three Sovereign Lords, transmitted through countless kalpas to the Eastern Sea Little Child. The Nine Heavens Kings handed it down to the Most High Great Dao Lord, who always treasured it as a secret, hiding it in the Jade Chamber of the Spiritual Capital of Taiwei, guarded by great celestial beasts, defended by venomous dragons and golden tigers, guided by seven thousand men, complete within the Jade Palace; Golden Morning Jade Boys, Pure Spirit Jade Maidens, three hundred each, attend and guard the Spiritual Writing. The Mysterious Radiance fills the void, scattering smoke over the Purple Court, its majesty shaking the nine distant regions. The Sovereign Heaven Great God shines brightly on Supreme Clarity, marvelously opening to the natural; penetrating wisdom in formlessness. The Divine Tiger leads its head in order, the Golden Tiger guards its truth; wisdom marks its essence, dispelling demons and severing their source. The subtle meanings are profound and abstruse, wondrously difficult to explain; all are marked with the secret names of heavenly demons, also indicating the inner names of a hundred spirits. To recite its chapter causes a thousand spirits to be startled and moved; to chant its verses binds the forms of myriad demons. With the establishment of governance in the Three Heavens, it was entrusted to the Taiwei Heavenly Emperor Lord, to wield might over the Six Heavens, to cut off myriad spirits, to govern mountains and valleys, to summon sea gods, and to bind host spirits as girdles. The assembled spirits apply talismans, greatly terrifying demons; evil is extinguished in form; true gods of the underworld reverse the net and turn the five stars. Thus the Taiwei Emperor Lord received the Demon-Destroying Wisdom Golden Tiger and Phoenix Writing, wearing the talisman to roam and sport, penetrating Supreme Clarity, transcending and riding on the void, mysteriously floating the celestial wheel, Taiwei purifying the bright scene in the high pavilion, Most Perfect halting at the steps and court, harmonizing with heaven and earth, shining sevenfold brilliance and great brightness. Equal in movement and measure to the Three Sovereigns, shining sevenfold in the Nine Underworlds, grasping the cloud regulations on cliffs and ridges, illuminating jade chapters with spiritual cunning, encompassing myriad degrees with mysterious wisdom, issuing decrees to call the true spirits and summon the hundred yang. Thereupon lightning shines on myriad poisons, sweeping away millions, causing ten thousand demons to be destroyed by poison, the majesty shaking distant courts. Golden Morning unfolds the Dao, no hindrance in its opening, looking upward into the Golden Palace within; the eight scenes respond to the mandate and revolve; the Spiritual Officer commands the Golden Tiger, bearing me beyond the void to fly; the host dragons open the immortal road, ascending afar to pay homage to Taiwei. The Three Terraces serve as guides, the seven stars follow in swift pursuit; flying clear to display divine constructions, richly prospering the heavenly mechanisms, penetrating and viewing the Nine Profound Gates, journeying to the utmost ends of heaven, resting in the jade chambers and pavilions, returning and going without decline. Subtle indeed is the Heavenly True Talisman, the Imperial Spirit approaches wondrous titles.

**Preface of the Earth Sovereign on the Phoenix Writing**

The Earth Sovereign entrusts the Golden Tiger and Phoenix Writing talisman chapter to the Taiwei Heavenly Emperor Lord. The Taiwei Heavenly Emperor Lord informs the Supreme Holy Azure Youth Lord. Then the Western City King Lord also said: "The Supreme Clarity Great Wisdom Demon-Destroying True Scripture," this is the Phoenix Writing of the Three Sovereigns, the inner text of the Supreme Ultimate, the secret names of the host spirits, the jade chapter of the Lofty Sovereign, the treasured formula of the Supreme Sovereign, the precious chapter of the Golden Tiger. Wisdom can expel filth and destroy demons, greatly effecting the removal and control of poisons, also discerning evil; no demon can but be crushed in form. Wearing it one may harmonize form and fly transcending, scattering radiance to all directions, roaming waves and sea ferries, unharmed by myriad harms, sitting or standing without perish, joining with the mysterious and communicating; must stand firm, what wish would not be fulfilled? Now by the might of the spirit it is entrusted, diligently cultivating oneself; the true scripture is lofty and wondrous, one should recite this myriad-communication, proclaim and exhort later sages to receive this true companionship. One must follow the system of the Most Perfect; if not in accord, be cautious to not open to it. The world has no faithful and obedient persons; seven hundred years hence they shall follow each other, again appearing at the end of the Ma lineage, the virtuous reaching Songfang, the mighty assisting the three transmissions, thus ascending the Supreme Ultimate Duke. If not of dragon and phoenix nature, how may one attain the companionship of the precious worthy?

**Preface of the Human Sovereign on the Phoenix Writing**

The phoenix writing having long descended, the golden tiger shines as divine truth. The added power is original merit, not descending to impure and turbid men. Covering and conveying the Three Caverns masters, ascending beyond the High Profound guests. Passing the Queen Mother’s Gate, roaming the heavenly river ferry. First bowing to the Supreme Ultimate Emperor, enduring thirty celestial kalpas. Repeatedly receiving the heavenly truth descent, jade maidens numbering several thousands. Golden boys descending on the left, jade maidens attending the right side. Added bestowal of nine-bend tokens, jade and unity bright and fresh. Heavenly officers follow its descent, Five Mountains lead before it. Heavenly men beat bamboo drums and castanets, flutes and songs guarding its midst. Mountains and seas become still waves, the clear path free of dust and cloud. Descending to play in the Four Rivers, the Five Mountains also momentarily turn. All demons lie subdued and concealed, sprites and spectres all extinguished in body. Flying radiance in the Scarlet Palace, richly accompanying host immortals. The will solely receives the heavenly descent, the white sun rises over Imperial Heaven. Why not diligently penetrate thoroughly, broadly view the clear master’s ferry? The Heavenly Sovereign’s Dao is lofty and wondrous, connecting above and penetrating holy truth. The Earth Sovereign next in brightness, virtue and emperor’s command follow. The Human Sovereign also is sagely transformed, virtue equal with heaven’s wheeling circle.

The master receiving disciples should all strictly purify by fasting ninety days, or thirty days, or a minor fast of seven days. All require seven taels of superior gold, as the token of the Golden Tiger and Phoenix Writing. Vermilion brocade ninety feet, for swearing to the Nine Heavens; blue silk forty feet, to covenant its writing. Love the Dao and accord with the True, diligently focusing on the mysterious, be not sparing of wealth and possessions, esteem the person and love faithfulness, responses will all descend, none fail to be renewed. Receiving it one should diligently seek, not be foremost in excess; attentively at night not sleeping, striving to advance before distinguished persons. Why be lazy and negligent, uprightly receiving and sitting in error? The body and model should accord with the Dao, if not accord do not speak presumptuously. Inside and outside both floating in liking, how can one mutually revolve in this? Be cautious, wealth is a burden, destroys fame and buries the person. The smallest hair is already known by heaven; do not say small things do not entangle. I wish the disciple to avoid the worldly net, gradually forsake the shelter of famous mountains; mountains and marshes are silent and without pleasure, able to preserve myriad spirits. At all times scatter wealth and treasures, to redeem past offenses, bridging generations to cross and rescue remote persons. Reduce excess and supplement deficiency, merit spreading to all directions; calamities must come through the Dao; the Dao descends wings to be covered; grace bestowed calls for acceptance; do not await calamity’s attack; calamity’s attack and fault already fixed, not to be again calculated or communicated; calculation and power not reached, think of the disciple sitting guarded in poverty.

Wearing the Golden Tiger and Phoenix Writing upper talisman, writing it in vermilion, or also may write it in blue for the earth.

The Imperial Dao says: The Daoist who learns the path of the immortal truth, establishes merit and virtue in the human world; after full years should enter the Five Great Mountains. The scholar suffers hardships, not yet refining the hidden retreat, setting hopes on the magical fungus, directly visiting the mountains; the roads long and distant, suddenly encountering three calamities and five difficulties, finally unable to perform the prescribed methods. The body is in the midst of evil bandits and demons; all should become mighty gods and great invocations. Then facing evil places, sounding the heavenly drum thirty-six times, fully embodying the inner spirit, and accordingly chanting:

May the mysterious sound of the Nine Heavens descend regulations with myriad harmonies; commanding the four quarters, opening divine myriad flowers; surpassing obstructed heavenly traces; three and five combined in netting; returning pure verdant scenes; chanting commands swiftly; allying vermilion and opening oaths; sweeping and removing sickness; containing light shining high; flowing radiance filling homes; the able horseman using strategy; mighty severing heavenly demons; collecting and recording extinct kinds; extinguishing forms in nine nets; tiger talisman divine might; might compelling myriad evils; cutting and slaying none large; minutest all perish; evil extinct in nine shadows; calamity destroyed in drifting sands; myriad poisons all subdued; hundred difficulties all passed; this shall be spoken of for merit and promotion, not failing supreme harmony.

**Preface of the Lofty Sovereign on the Phoenix Writing**

Bright and glorious is the Five-Pointed Ridge, its lone peak shining with supreme radiance. The learners are not strict and pure, the officials and soldiers also do not obey. I uphold the correct Dao and walk it; what evil dares to come near? Wearing the golden divine token, flowing bells fly with the body. Three Heavens’ talismans and Five Mountains, both guide me forward and behind. The heavenly net is already stretched; the earthly web also set with snares. Demons, evil, and venomous beasts, on seeing me immediately are destroyed and broken. What thief or bandit dares to approach? The Golden Phoenix devours your decline. Thousand spirits lose their sight; myriad demons flee like thunder. Why allow thieves and robbers? The Three Officials should strictly enforce. Quickly flee and disperse; tiger soldiers should severely drive. Quickly quickly receive the imperial decree, strictly and clearly proclaim the supreme might. Those meritorious shall be promoted and rewarded; those without merit pursued with myriad plans. Quickly quickly as the clear heavenly invocation, command and law.

Moreover, there is a great demon-dispelling talisman, in the Scripture of Demon-Dispelling Heavenly Water, which may be applied in advance to repel evil, then the divine incantation and order may be executed.

This is the secret sound of the demon kings of the Nine Heavens; also one should wear it and invoke it, to control demons. Without invocation one should first wear a talisman, further commanding the inner spirits to respond.

In the third year of Xingning, year of the Yi-Chou, seventh month, seventh day, Master Tongbai, receiving from Master Lezi and Master Anqi, took forth from the Three Sovereigns’ treasury the Golden Tiger and Phoenix Writing talisman, ordering late learners of the Dao, Xu Yuanyou, to receive it, to control myriad demons. The divine invocation will be performed in the years Yi-Wei, Jia-Shen, Yi-Hai, Ren-Chen, Gui-Si; on the first day of the ninth month, and the seventh day of the seventh month, and the eighth day of the fourth month, on these three days there shall be worthy men and Daoists, wearing seven-coloured ritual robes, holding staffs, on the spiritual altar or in the human world seeking alms, at times chanting scriptures and texts, or uttering wild song-like cries. If you see such persons, diligently inquire of them the details of the Dao, they will surely grant you the Golden Tiger Upper Talisman, and all the essential words of learning. Be cautious not to treat lightly, this is the hidden and transformed true man. The Southern Mountain True Man serves the Most High Limitless Great Dao Lord and Heavenly Emperor Lord as usual envoy; at times descending to the human world, observing the late learners’ diligent hearts in these last days.
