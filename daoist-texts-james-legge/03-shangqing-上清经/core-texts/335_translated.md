# Canon of the Two Flights of the Original Truth from the Secret Writings of Supreme Clarity and Grand Firmament

Title of the Canon: Canon of the Two Flights of the Original Truth from the Secret Writings of Supreme Clarity and Grand Firmament. The author is unknown; it is approximately from the Eastern Jin. Originally it formed a chapter in the "Jade Pendants and Golden Danglers, Supreme Ultimate Golden Writings, Upper Canon," but afterwards was separated into a single tract. The source text is from the Zhengyi Section of the Daoist Canon.

### Canon of the Two Flights of the Original Truth from the Secret Writings of Supreme Clarity and Grand Firmament

The Way of the Six Assemblies and the Transference of Degrees must be practised by observing the Five Mornings of Separation at the Gate of Death, passing through the Palace of Life, and ascending by the method of the Flying Immortal. The days of Ren-shen, Bing-shen, Wu-shen, Jia-shen, and Geng-shen — these five days of Separation — are the appointed times. At these times the High Emperor usually rides in the chariot of the Dragon of Radiance, a green misty carriage, attended by the Jade Maidens of the Immortal Officials; he journeys in a circuit of ten heavens, descending to the human realm to inspect those who seek immortality. He commands the Northern Emperor, the Lord of the Five Energies of the Great Yin, to bear the Record of Death and ascend to the Lord of the Counting Palace at the Capital Plain, to examine and collate the registers of life and death. The Five True Emperors of the Five Directions are Lords of the Way, each governing his quarter, overseeing all Immortals who are to attain the Dao, their name being Donghua.

There are Yin sins and Yin transgressions; Yang sins and Yang transgressions; those bound to the Northern Emperor. The Great Yin Lord’s palace is called Fengdu, which separates the good and evil, the living and dead. Therefore, on the days of the Five Separations, the first guilt is presented to the Great Yin; the life is cultivated by the Great Yang; the death records are submitted to the Northern Emperor; the Immortals are sought at the Five Stars. Whenever the day arrives, one prepares with fasting and fine garments, burns incense in the chamber, repents and contemplates the good, preserves the spirit within, concentrates the mind single-heartedly on the mysterious, with no distracting thoughts. The Emperor proceeds through the Five Realms, and the divine officials record the merits of the person, reporting up to the Jade Emperor. After five years of this, one may succeed in having the Five True Emperors descend into the chamber.

At this day’s dawn, noon, and midnight, enter the chamber and burn incense; face north and bow twice; knock the teeth three times; and recite the spell:

"Most High Jade Emperor, I entreat that you pardon, from my seventh ancestor onward to myself, all the Yin evils and unprincipled deeds, the killing of life and licentiousness, hundreds and thousands of offenses of Yang sins and Yin transgressions, which have been reported to the Northern Emperor. I beg for their removal and reduction, to have the guilt erased, the root of death cut off, to pass through the heavenly gate, and to be received in Donghua. The characters are recorded upon the Jade Tablets. The seven ancestors and grandparents shall return to the Southern Immortals in the womb."

This done, then think upon the True Emperor of the Northern Star of the Northern Quarter, dressed in purple brocade flying skirt, girded with a tiger tally, wearing a splendid floral crown, riding the brocade mist and flying cloud jade chariot, attended by twelve immortal officials; from the North he comes down to cover my body, his brilliance dense and resplendent, shining with radiant light; and raise a prayer, saying:

"True Emperor of the North, Commander of the Flying Immortals, riding the cloud-drawn carriage, come crown my body; I beseech you to fill the ghost gate, sever the root of death, called Jade Clarity, to open the Heavenly Gate. Let me depart from the Northern Emperor, ascend to the Southern Pavilion, with longevity equal to the True Emperor's, jointly guarding the North Star."

Then hold the breath five times and stop. Face east, bow twice, knock the teeth thrice, and recite the spell:

"Jade Morning Supreme Lord, Supreme Ultimate Original Radiance Lord, I entreat that you pardon the Yin sins and Yang transgressions committed by me since the first year, extending to the seven ancestors' repeated heavy offenses, bound in the three Yin; I beg for their removal and obliteration of guilt, to fill the root of death, the Northern Emperor to erase my ancestral bonds, Donghua to record my Jade Tablets; the seven mysterious parents to ascend with me to the Imperial Morning."

This done, next think upon the True Emperor of the Central Star, the Eastern Quarter, Qingya, dressed in cloud brocade dragon robe skirt, girded with a phoenix tally, wearing a splendid floral crown, riding the blue mist and flying cloud jade chariot, attended by twelve immortal officials; from the East he descends to cover my body, his brilliance abundant and dazzling, shining in the East; raise a prayer, saying:

"True Emperor of the East Centre, flowing mist of the nine gates, light shining beyond the borders, cover and crown my body; I beseech you to bestow upon me, to report to the Northern Emperor, to sever my root of death, to pass me my Jade name within the Eastern Hua Inner Truth; may I ascend and be delivered, forever departing the path of death. The seven mysterious parents all enjoy blessings, born with the moon, set with the sun; riding the void soaring on high, ascending by flying steps."

Then hold the breath nine times and stop. Face south, bow twice, knock the teeth thrice, and recite the spell:

"Supreme Lords of the Three Origins of Supreme Clarity, Lord of the Southern Pole Upper Origin, Solar Nine Qi Jade Worthy Original Lord, I entreat that you pardon all the original evils and unfilial acts committed by me from consciousness onward, rebellions and lawlessness, treacheries, thefts, Yin sins and Yang transgressions, extending to the seven ancestors’ ancestral bonds, accumulated up to the white tablets; eyes fixed upon the Great Yin, guilt bound to the Northern Star — I beg for their removal and obliteration; sever the eyes of the Three Officials’ ancestral bonds; fill and cut off the root of death energy; pass beyond the Northeast Gate; ascend the Southwest Open Gate; the seven mysterious parents all receive the Imperial grace."

This done, next think upon the True Emperor of the Southern Star, Mars, Wei Chun, dressed in snow frost phoenix dragon bell skirt, girded with a tiger tally, wearing a flying azure crown, riding the cinnabar mist and crimson chariot, attended by twelve immortal officials; from the South he descends to cover my body, his brilliance splendid as the rising sun; raise a prayer, saying:

"True Emperor of the South, Mysterious Image flowing light, lingering around the three gates, riding the cinnabar chariot, ascending the Upper Origin, shining within; cover and crown my body, remove and erase my Northern Emperor’s guilt; loosen bonds and disperse stagnation; annihilate the Great Yin; body depart from the ghost gate; sever the root of ancestral bonds; ascend the Heavenly Gate; enter the Southern Pavilion; the seven ancestors and grandparents accompany me to the Imperial presence."

Then hold the breath eight times and stop. Face west, bow twice, knock the teeth thrice, and recite the spell:

"Supreme Lord of the Three Origins of the Great Element, Lord of the Four Elders of the Central Way, I entreat that you pardon the errors and offenses committed by me in the past, the leakage and decay of the scriptures, treading the filth and stained dust, polluting and slighting the Three Luminaries; my oaths and tears rise to touch the Imperial Lords; ancestral bonds tied to the Great Yin; guilt sworn to the ghost officials; I beg for their removal and obliteration; sever the root; block the path of death; pass beyond the Gate of Life; the seven ancestors and grandparents ascend the Hall of Blessings."

This done, next think upon the True Emperor of the Western Star, Venus, Bai Xing, dressed in white brocade flowing bell skirt, girded with tiger insignia, wearing the Morning Assistance crown, riding the white mist flying carriage, attended by twelve immortal officials; from the West he descends to cover my body, his light penetrating, brilliant in the West; raise a prayer, saying:

"True Emperor of the West, shining with pure light and mysterious emblem, riding the jade chariot, white brilliance filling the sky, returning with the morning light to descend; true form displayed in the crossing; for me turn the nine gates; pass through the imperial court; body depart from the Great Yin’s records; ascend the Mysterious Palace with the jade; longevity surpassing heaven and earth, enduring a myriad years without decay; the seven mysterious parents all ascend the morning sky."

This done, then hold the breath six times and stop. Next face the centre, bow twice, knock the teeth thrice, and recite the spell:

"Most High Great Emperor Jade Sovereign, I entreat that you pardon the countless errors and offenses which I have committed from birth until this day, a thousand faults and ten thousand transgressions; the seven ancestors’ ancestral bonds still bound and unresolved; matters tied to the Great Yin; I beg for their removal, obliteration, dispersion; destroy the Northern Emperor’s mysterious name; sever the root of the ghost gate of the Gui earth and the death energy; pass the Heavenly Gate; pass through the Five Mornings; the seven ancestors and grandparents all receive renewed immortality."

Then think upon the True Emperor of the Central Guardian Star, Tan Yan, clothed in yellow cloud dragon brocade tiger skirt, girded with golden tally; wearing purple crown, riding the yellow mist flying chariot, attended by twelve immortal officials; from the centre he descends to cover my body, his light penetrating, brilliant in the middle origin; raise a prayer, saying:

"True Emperor of the Centre, chief of the Five Emperors, directing the mysterious order, riding the yellow mist, journeying through the four directions; for me remove the root of death; pass through the Southern Sun palace; separate the five and return the six; fly with me together; transform the myriad ferries; forever enjoy boundlessness; ascend the Supreme Ultimate, Golden Palace and Jade Hall; the seven ancestors and grandparents share the benefits and prosperity."

This done, hold the breath twelve times and stop.

The Five Separations first pass to the Five Emperors; the Five Mornings are preserved to pass the life; the matter is here completed. If one persistently performs this on the appointed days without neglect, after seven years one will be touched through with the Five Mornings’ True Stars, and see forms in the child’s bedchamber. The Great Emperor will send five Jade Maidens of the Five Directions to guard the child’s body; the Northern Emperor of the Great Yin will also come to the child’s door, but dare not restrain the child’s guilt. Those who seek immortality and truth should be diligent in practice. Repenting and seeking the Way of Life — this is the method of petitioning the Lord Qing Tong of the High Minister to entreat the Lord of the Golden Palace; it is a model for later seekers of life, and not the repentance of the Great Emperor. If one acts according to this, the Lord will also judge the heart; if ancestral offenses are not fully exhausted, the six heavenly officials will not let the death name fall upon the person, nor will the Gate of Opening and Closing let the person pass. Therefore there are the Mansion of Separation and Joining, the Gate of Opening and Closing. The Gate of Opening and Closing is the Palace of Passing Life; the Mansion of Separation and Joining is the source of filling death. Only by earnest seeking can one obtain the truth.

Those who cultivate life do not know that Heaven has the Gate of Opening and Closing, and Earth has Fengdu; the Gate of Opening and Closing commands the spirits; Fengdu governs the ghosts. These are two Emperors, presiding over birth and death, connected through the pivot of the Seven Stars; hence the Seven Stars move and pass judgment. The Northern Emperor has no name of the Six Palaces; the Gate of Opening and Closing has the records of the Immortals; the mysterious branch is covered with a floral canopy; the Seven Origins confer the release; the path of the Immortals is near at hand.

The Lord of the Southern Pole Upper Origin says: The will of man is illuminated by the Seven Stars and the Nine Sovereigns, mysteriously shining upon the heart; if one earnestly seeks and contemplates with difficulty, one can attain this practice in seven years and ascend with the morning light. If one only reveres this Canon without keeping the mind in contemplation, burning incense on left and right, the Seven Stars’ spirits will still mysteriously shine upon the chamber, and the officials of Fengdu will not dare to approach the person’s body.
