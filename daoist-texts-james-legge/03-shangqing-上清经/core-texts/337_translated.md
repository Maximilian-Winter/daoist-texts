### The Scripture of the Three Diagrams of the Heavenly Gate of Upper Clarity

The Secret Instruction of the Great Firmament

Whosoever cultivates the Way of the Transit of the Seven Stars must invoke above the Nine Lords of the Jade Hall, the Mysterious Essence shining within, severing and blocking the root of death. One must quiet the mind in the chamber of tranquility, be unperturbed by the dust of the world, stand alone facing the appointed realm, watch the dawn of the firmament, and spread incense to left and right, the smoke and rosy clouds filling the courtyard. Within the essence, bitterly meditate, preserve the thoughts and do not sleep. Thus for seven years, the splendid chariot and flying canopy with cinnabar shafts shall come to welcome the destined body, ascending to the Heavenly Gate, blocking the path of death in the northeast, recording the register of life in the southern immortal realm. This is called the Way of Difficult Aspiration and Easy Descent of the True.

There is the Golden Pattern and Jade Name; he who obtains to unfold this Way should do so on the six days of Renyin, Bingyin, Jiazi, Jiawu, Xinwei, and Xinchou, these being the days of the six meetings, the times of the Most High’s conjunction. The Jade Emperor often on these days commands the attendant Jade Youths to verify and settle the Golden Pattern and Jade Name of the Azure Radiance Eastern Palace, recording the registers of the immortals.

On these days, those who diligently aspire and penetrate above, and move the Jade Sovereign, shall command the Northern Emperor of Fengdu’s Six Palaces to sever the roots of the death register, verify the life register at the human gate, conceal the seven stars within the ghost gate, transit the Mysterious Pivot, and open the Heavenly Gate.

Whenever one purifies oneself and meditates deeply on the mystery, closing the eyes and storing within, knocking the teeth thirty-six times, one contemplates the First Great Star, the Mysterious Pivot, the Yang Bright Heavenly Pivot, the Soul Spirit, the Supreme True Nine Lords, clad in flying cloud brocade skirts, wearing the crown of Mysterious Dawn, descending from the Mysterious Dipper into my body, then chanting thus:

Mysterious Pivot, Yang Bright Heavenly Pivot, Soul Spirit, Supreme True Nine Lords, blended and transformed, united as one deity, I pray you sever for me the path of death at the ghostly door, transit the life register at the southern pavilion, remove the seven mysteries in the three paths, receive the root of birth and ascend anew to immortality, return the seven essences to the Mysterious Shade, transit my form at the Heavenly Gate. Thus finished, swallow the breath twice seven times.

Diligent in practice without slackening, one then invokes the Jade Emperor’s guests; the Emperor descends in the purple haze cloud, guarded by the twelve treasure-bearing jade maidens and golden dawn jade youths, guarding the body.

Next, one contemplates the Second Original Star, Northern Fetus Yin Essence, Heavenly Pivot Soul Spirit, Supreme Jade Nine Lords, clad in yellow brocade flying skirts, with the crown of Mysterious Dawn, descending from the Mysterious Dipper into my body, chanting the breath incantation:

Northern Fetus Yin Essence, Heavenly Pivot Soul Spirit, Supreme Jade Nine Lords, blended in myriad transformations, united as one deity, I pray you remove my yang sins at the Great Yin, transit the yin breath at the Great Yang, move the seven origins to sever death, open the six harmonies at the Heavenly Gate, extract the seven ancestors in the three paths, receive the root of birth at the southern pavilion. Thus finished, swallow the breath twice seven times.

Next, one contemplates the Third True Star, Nine Poles Supreme True Upper Origin Lady, Heavenly Gauge Soul Essence, Supreme White Nine Lords, clad in blue brocade flying skirts, crowned with the Mysterious Dawn, descending from the Mysterious Dipper into my body, chanting the breath incantation:

Nine Poles Supreme True Upper Origin Lady, Heavenly Gauge Soul Essence, Supreme White Nine Lords, blended and transformed, united as one deity, I pray you untie the root of the former pairings, sever the source of the path of death, grant my eyes clear insight, perfect vision without limit, the Mysterious Truth gazing upwards, essence pouring into my body, ascending to grasp the Imperial Leader, flying steps through the seven origins, riding the light and traversing the void, inclining with Heaven. Thus finished, swallow the breath twice seven times.

Next, one contemplates the Fourth Pivot Star, Long Gauge, Mysterious Darkness Heavenly Authority, Soul Essence, Supreme Void Nine Lords, clad in purple brocade flying skirts, crowned with the Mysterious Dawn, descending from the Mysterious Dipper into my body, chanting thus:

Long Gauge, Mysterious Darkness, Heavenly Authority, Soul Essence, Supreme Void Nine Lords, blended in myriad transformations, united as one deity, I pray you move and transit the seven stars, fill and block the ghost gate, cut off the breath of death, open the clear Heavenly Gate, return the Northern Dipper to the Mysterious Pivot, transit the breath of life to the western Kun, separate the Northern Emperor from Fengdu, record the name at the southern pavilion. Thus finished, swallow the breath twice seven times.

Next, one contemplates the Fifth Strong Star, Heavenly Balance, Cinnabar Origin, Jade Scale Soul Spirit, Supreme Mysterious Nine Sovereign Lords, clad in cinnabar brocade cloak and skirt, crowned with the Mysterious Dawn, descending from the Mysterious Dipper into my body, chanting:

Heavenly Balance, Cinnabar Origin, Jade Scale Soul Spirit, Supreme Mysterious Nine Sovereign Lords, blended in myriad transformations, united as one deity, grant me ascent and descent of the seven essences, instill into my body, return the four turns thrice, open and descend the seven origins, block the door of death at the northern bundle, receive the palace of life in the nine mysteries, record the name of the Eastern Radiance, and serve at the Jade Morning. Thus finished, swallow the breath twice seven times.

Next, one contemplates the Sixth Record Star, Life Mechanism, North Pole Kai Yang Soul Spirit, Supreme Cinnabar Emperor Void Nine Lords, clad in vermilion brocade flying skirts, crowned with the Mysterious Dawn, descending from the Mysterious Dipper into my body, chanting:

Life Mechanism, North Pole Kai Yang Soul Spirit, Supreme Cinnabar Emperor Void Nine Lords, blended in myriad transformations, united as one deity, for me open the Heavenly One Three Diagrams Mysterious Gate, descend to the Northern Emperor Fengdu’s Six Palaces, govern the Yin officials, remove the root of nine deaths, return the three and restore the four, transit the name of the seven origins, preserve eternity, born with the Dipper. Thus finished, swallow the breath twice seven times.

Next, one contemplates the Seventh Pass Star, Mysterious Yang, Heavenly Gate Shaking Light, Great Bright Supreme Jade Emperor Dao Lord, clad in cinnabar brocade flying gauze skirts, crowned with the Mysterious Dawn, descending from the Mysterious Dipper into my body, chanting:

Mysterious Yang, Heavenly Gate Shaking Light, Great Bright Supreme Jade Emperor Dao Lord, blended in myriad transformations, united as one deity, I pray you summon above the Jade Morning Nine True Emperor Lords, mix the nine yins, return the turning heavenly gate, untie my seven mysteries’ ancestors, grant me to roam the Mysterious Clouds, remove my northern yin death root, record my Eastern Radiance Jade Scroll. Thus finished, swallow the breath twice seven times.

Having preserved the seven origins, knock the teeth twelve times, close the eyes and contemplate the seven stars of the northern quarter, their bright radiance illuminating the north, star essence shining within, coming to cover my body. The True Lord in the Dipper, in chaos and transformation, without fixed form, jointly rides the green mist cloud to welcome my body, ascending among the seven stars. I feel my body beneath the central canopy of the Dipper, essence light shining brilliantly, crowned all over the body, following the Dipper’s rotation like the wheel of a cart. In a moment, the Heavenly Gate opens, the Seven Stars and Nine Lords each bestow upon me talismans to open the gates of the seven origins, to govern the Northern Emperor’s six palaces, severing the root of death breath.

Receiving the talismans, I whirl to restore the original element back to the Dipper; the seven talismans shine like the essence of fire, conveying me downward. Suddenly treading the void, in an instant I rest upon my bed. Knock the teeth thirty-six times, raise the head and chant:

Mysterious light shines forth, flowing radiance shakes my form, riding the mist fleeing and transforming, ascending the seven stars, the Heavenly Pivot reins urged like lightning, the Heavenly One opens the gate, transiting my birth, Northern Emperor’s Yin palace, casting down my death name. Not transited, not cast down, ascending to the seven essences, I wear the seven origins, flow of golden fire bells, opening the heavenly mechanism, flowing through the eight darknesses, commanding the six Jia, driving the six Ding, Heaven descends the mysterious canopy, the Emperor gives divine weapons, begging the Eastern Radiance, recording my jade name, flying through the void and riding the emptiness, ascending to Jade Clarity. Thus finished, swallow the breath thirty-six times once more and stop. By opening the Heavenly Gate, severing the root of death, blending myriad transformations, the Way is accomplished here. Practiced seven years, wearing the talisman of seven origins, wealth comes as flying mist and green palanquin, coming to welcome the destined body. This is secret cultivation; take heed not to lightly transmit it.

The Emperor’s Talisman of Seven Origins

The talisman to open the Heavenly Gate is within the lower scroll. When the practice of the Transit of the Seven Stars is finished, and practiced seven years, wear the talisman of seven origins.

Within the scroll is the image of the Perfected One, besides the annotations, wearing a green crown and mantle, crimson robe and vermilion shoes, riding a five-coloured cloud. The Perfected Ones meditate, each wearing green crown, yellow robe, green mantle, blue skirt; the palaces ornamented suitably with gold.

The Northern Emperor’s Fengdu Six Palaces’ Death Transit Method

Mount Fengdu lies in the north, at the Gui point; hence the northeast is the ghost gate, root of death breath. The mountain is sixteen hundred li high, with a circumference of thirty thousand li; its cave origin lies below the mountain, with a circumference of fifteen thousand li. Above and below are ghostly palaces. On the mountain are six palaces, and in the cave are another six palaces, each palace a thousand li in circumference. These are the palaces of the six and two heavens of ghosts and spirits.

The first is named the Palace of the Severing Yin of Zhou.

The second is the Palace of the Tai Killing and Honest Affairs.

The third is the Palace of the Bright Morning Resisting Offense at the Martial City.

The fourth is the Palace of Quiet Illumination and Crime Breath.

The fifth is the Palace of Ancestral Spirit and Seven Wrongs.

The sixth is the Palace of Daring to Command Lianwanlu.

These six palaces are under the lordship of the Northern Emperor, governed by the six heavenly ghosts and spirits, holding dominion over the death names of men; none who die fail to pass through Fengdu’s six palaces. Therefore the Emperor often commands those who study the Transit of the Seven Stars to pass the Heavenly Gate, open the Southern Pole’s palace, and sever the ghost gate of the northeast. When the student completes the transit of the capitals, he should knock the left teeth nine times, call the names of the six palaces, and incant:

I am the servant of the Emperor, my name recorded in Jade Clarity, commanding the six heavens, the Northern Emperor’s ghost palace, all are my domain. What ghost dares to act? Wearing the talisman of severance on the right, and fire bell on the left, casting fire ten thousand li, subduing myriad spirits; offenders are slain, disturbers destroyed. The Emperor commands, capturing without pause.

When this is finished, a single incantation makes the heaven’s light tremble and move, ten thousand devils are bound, three incantations extinguish ghosts and demons, the six palaces cut off death names, the Heavenly Gate transits man, the Southern Pole births man. He who does not know the names of the Fengdu palaces and the domain of the bird spirits fails to sever the root of death; no one attains immortality.

When the practice of the Transit of the Seven Stars is finished, next contemplate and preserve the two Emperor Lords. Sitting upright facing East, knock the teeth thirty-six times, contemplate the two Emperor Lords, the High Jade Emperor, Eight Scene Primordial Lords, Nine Venerables, the Taiwei Jade Emperor, the Seven Star Lords of the Supreme Origin, clothed in flying cloud and purple brocade skirts, crowned with the Mysterious Dawn, descending from the Mysterious Dipper into my body, chanting:

High Jade Emperor, Eight Scene Primordial Lords, Nine Venerables, Taiwei Emperor, Seven Star Lords of Supreme Origin, nine transformations blending the two Emperor Lords, open the Heavenly Gate for me, transit the jade name, sever the ghost gate of the Northern Emperor’s six palaces and their death roots, ascend the seven origins, grant me the eight scenes, seven essences, nine sovereign flying chariots and green palanquins, together ascend the Jade Morning, govern the imperial consorts, control myriad souls. Thus finished, swallow the breath thrice seven times.

Next preserve the two Emperor talismans, ascending amidst the seven stars under the canopy; the two Emperor stars govern beneath the canopy, always covering the two stars whose essence light is invisible and unseen by men. Hence the Golden Script and Jade Characters say: "He who sees the two stars prolongs life by six hundred thousand years." Without the two Emperor flying sky talismans, one cannot ascend beneath the canopy, nor see the two stars. Wearing the two talismans, the two Emperors shine their mysterious light upon one’s body. Cultivate for nine years, at white day ascend the morning.

The Method of Five Separations for Surpassing Death and Attaining Life

When practicing the Way of the six meetings and one opening transit, one should perform the five morning separations at the death door, transiting the life palace and flying immortal method. The five days of separation are Ren Shen, Bing Shen, Wu Shen, Jia Shen, Geng Shen. On these days the Emperor holds a great feast, riding the dragon carriage, green pavilion and flying palanquin, attended by immortal officials and jade maidens, revolving down from the ten heavens to the human world to examine those who study immortality. One’s fate is carried to the Northern Emperor Tai Cang and five lords, who present the death register to the lord of Pingdu and calculate the records of life. The five directions’ five star true sovereign lords each govern their directions, commanding the immortals to receive those worthy of the Way, naming the bindings of the flowers. Yin sins and yin faults, yang sins and yang faults, are bound at the Northern Emperor Tai Yin Lord, named the palace of Fengdu, separating good and evil, life and death. Hence on the five days of separation, the chief sin is at Tai Yin, cultivation of life at the Tai Yang, death register at the Northern Emperor, seeking immortality at the five stars. When these days come, one purifies with sumptuous fasting, wears fine clothes, burns incense entering the chamber, repents faults and thinks of good, stores the spirit and meditates within, with one heart focused on the mystery without distraction. The Emperor tours the three realms, spirit officials record one’s merits, naming them before the Jade Emperor. Thus for five years one obtains the five star true sovereigns, who descend to one’s chamber.

At each of the five separation days, at dawn, noon and midnight, enter the chamber, burn incense, face north and bow twice, knock the teeth three times, and chant:

High Jade Emperor, I beseech that from my seven ancestors until now, all the yin evils and yang faults committed by me, killing, licentiousness, theft, thousands of offenses and faults, yin sins and yang faults, all reported to the Northern Emperor, be removed and dispersed, erase the names of sin, sever the root of death, transit into the Heavenly Gate, record my name in the Eastern Radiance jade scroll, that my seven ancestors and grandparents may be reborn in the southern immortal realm.

Thus finished, contemplate the northern star of the time, the true sovereign lord, clad in purple brocade flying skirt, tiger talisman at the waist, crowned with flowery crown, riding the green mist flying cloud, accompanied by twelve immortal officials, descending from the north to cover my body, the light dense and magnificent, radiant essence shining forth. Looking upward, chant:

Northern True Sovereign, commander of flying immortals, riding clouds and turning carriages, come and crown my body, I beseech that you fill and block the ghost gate, sever the root of death, named Jade Clarity, unveil and open the Heavenly Gate, that I may leave the Northern Emperor, ascend the southern pavilion, live as long as the True Sovereign, and together protect the northern morning.

Then swallow the breath twenty-five times and cease.

Facing East, bow again, knock the teeth three times, and chant:

Jade Morning Supreme Lord, Tai Ji Primordial Scene Lord, I beseech that from the year one until now, the yin sins and yang faults committed by me, and the seven ancestors’ former heavy offenses bound in the three yins, be unveiled and dispersed, the names of sin erased, the root of death filled and blocked, the Northern Emperor remove my old bonds, the Eastern Radiance record my jade scroll, that my seven mysteries’ parents ascend the Jade Morning.

Next contemplate the Eastern Jupiter True Sovereign Lord Qingya, clad in cloud brocade dragon patterned skirt, tiger talisman at waist, crowned with flowery crown, riding the azure mist flying cloud and jade carriage, accompanied by twelve immortal officials, descending from the east to cover my body, the light dense and brilliant. Facing east, chant:

Eastern True Sovereign, flowing mist and nine gates, light reflects within and without, covering and crowning the destined body, I beseech you to grant me, report to the Northern Emperor, sever my root of death, transit my jade name, Eastern Radiance internal truth, that I may ascend and transit, forever free from the path of death, the seven mysteries’ parents, enjoying blessings and fortune, born with the moon, setting with the sun, riding the void and floating in the air, ascending by flying steps.

Then swallow the breath nine times and cease.

Facing South, bow again, knock the teeth three times, chant:

Upper Clarity Three Primordial Lords, Southern Pole Upper Origin Lord, Sun Nine Qi Jade Worthy Lord, I beseech that from my original knowledge until now, all original evils and unfiliality, rebellion and lawlessness, treachery, theft and licentiousness, yin sins and yang faults, and the seven ancestors’ former bonds and captures, be judged at the Tai Yin, sins named at the Northern Morning, I beseech unveiling and dispersing, severing the three officials’ former debts, filling and cutting off the root of death breath, the Northern Emperor remove my old bonds, the Eastern Radiance record my jade scroll, so that the seven mysteries’ parents may all receive the Emperor’s grace.

Thus finished, next contemplate the Southern Mars True Sovereign Lord Huaiding, clad in cloud frost phoenix dragon bell skirt, tiger talisman at waist, crowned with the Mysterious Dawn, flying blue brocade robe, riding the cinnabar mist red carriage, with twelve immortal officials, descending from the south to cover my body, the light brilliant as the rising sun. Looking upward, chant:

Southern True Sovereign, mysterious image and flowing light, wandering the three gates, attending the cinnabar carriage, ascending the seven origins, light shining within, piercing and crowning my body, for me to descend and sever the Northern Emperor’s sins, untie bonds and dissolve stagnation, destroy the Tai Yin, body separated from the ghost gate, sever the former pairing roots, open the Heavenly Gate, ascend the southern pavilion, the seven ancestors and grandparents together visit the Emperor’s presence.

Then swallow the breath eight times and cease.

Facing West, bow again, knock the teeth three times, chant:

Tai Su Three Primordial Lords, Four Elders Daoist Lords, I beseech that from my original knowledge until now, all my offences and faults, neglecting scripture, trampling filth and dust, arrogance towards the Three Luminaries, swearing and sobbing, touching the Emperor’s heart, former debts bound in Tai Yin, sins named at the ghost officials, I beseech unveiling and dispersing, severing the root of examination, blocking the path of death, transiting the gate of life, the seven ancestors’ parents ascending the hall of blessings.

Thus finished.

Next contemplate the Western Venus True Sovereign Lord, clad in white brocade flowing bell skirt, tiger talisman at waist, crowned with the Supporting Dawn crown, riding the white mist flying palanquin, with twelve immortal officials, descending from the west to cover my body, the light penetrating and brilliant in the west. Then chant:

Western True Sovereign, pure shining mysterious mark, attending the jade carriage, pure splendour rising to the sky, returning morning to descend, true form unveiled, turning the nine gates, transiting my imperial court, body separated from the Tai Yin register, ascending the mysterious palace and joining the song, longevity filling heaven and earth, a hundred million years uncorrupted, the seven mysteries’ parents all ascend the morning dawn.

Thus finished, swallow the breath six times and cease.

Facing Center, bow again, knock the teeth three times, chant:

High Supreme Great Emperor, Jade Emperor Lord, I beseech that from my birth until this day all my faults and countless errors, the seven ancestors’ former debts and stains unresolved, matters bound at Tai Yin, be unveiled and dispersed, severing the Northern Emperor’s mysterious name, cutting off the Gui earth ghost gate, root of death breath, transit the heavenly gate, passing the five mornings, the seven mysteries’ parents all receiving renewed immortality.

Thus finished.

Next contemplate the Central Governor Star True Sovereign Lord Tancheng Yan, clad in yellow cloud dragon brocade tiger skirt, wearing golden talisman at the waist, crowned with the purple crown, riding the yellow mist flying carriage, with twelve immortal officials, descending from the center to cover my body, the light penetrating and brilliant, illuminating the center of origin. Looking upward, chant:

Central Governor Star True Sovereign Lord, commander of the five Emperors, operating the mysterious thread, attending the yellow mist carriage, touring the four directions, severing for me the root of death, transiting the name of the southern sun palace, separating the five and returning the six, flying together with me, transforming myriad crossings, forever enjoying uncountable blessings, ascending the Tai Ji golden palace jade hall, the seven ancestors and grandparents sharing the benefit and prosperity.

Thus finished, swallow the breath twelve times and cease.

The five separations begin with the five Emperors, preserving the five mornings to transit life, the matter finished here. If regularly on their days the practice is not discontinued, after seven years one will be enlightened by the five morning true sovereigns, and see the form in one's sleeping chamber. The Great Emperor himself dispatches five jade maidens from the five directions to guard the body; the Northern Emperor Tai Yin also comes to attend the door of one’s chamber, daring not to restrain one’s sins. Those who study immortality and seek truth should diligently practice. Repenting and seeking the Way of Immortality, this is the method of the Prime Minister Qing Tong Jun requesting the Golden Palace Holy Lord’s Way, a warning for later followers seeking life, and not the repentance of the Great Emperor. In practicing this matter, the Emperor also perceives one’s heart; if one’s former faults are not exhausted, the six heavens’ palaces will not release one’s death name, the gate of opening and closing will not transit one’s body. Therefore the gate of separation and union, the gate of opening and closing, the gate of opening and closing is the palace of life transit, the gate of separation and union is the source of filling death. Only by refinement of essence can one obtain its truth.

The Emperor’s Bright Lamp Internal Contemplation Method for Seeking Immortality

Received from the Southern Pole Upper Origin Lord

The Emperor always dwells on the platform of Clear Mystery, within the golden chamber and purple door, shining the bright mystery lamp to illuminate himself, opening the misty light through eight windows, contemplating the Great Truth in the five forms, unsealing three wishes in the Emperor’s chamber, the spiritual sovereign descending to the purple canopy, the Primordial Emperor granting the golden youth, naturally called my imperial rank, commanding the Mysterious Palace. The Supreme Birth issues from the subtle marvel; the Dao lies in the faint light; now this is told to you; be diligent and observe.

Speak to the Southern Pole Upper Origin Lord: You study the Way of Spirit and Truth, dwelling on the spiritual palace above, within the jade chamber, yet do not know the bright lamp to shine upon yourself, to open the mysterious light within the five viscera, thereby attaining clarity, the spirit of the form thereby returning. If you can light the lamp at dusk upon your original life, light the lamp at dawn upon your annual journey, and always keep the lamp burning at the great year, these three places of wishful thought, then your body will be clear, breath rectified, true light shining within, myriad spirits bright and clear. The Primordial Lord receives this method and practicing it for three years will bring twenty-four luminous children of the night; the mysterious light shines naturally and clearly; no need for lamp to shine through.

Yet this supreme true subtle method is not transmitted to the later generations. If there be those of Golden Name, Jade Character, and Mysterious Pattern, who obtain my Way and practice it nine years, their bodies will shine bright, their vision penetrating ten thousand li, their clear observation of nature, the luminous children of the night descend to their chambers, granting true texts, ascending by day’s dawn.

Always keep the bright lamp burning above the chamber of original life where one dwells in tranquility. At dusk enter the chamber, kneeling long towards the lamp, knocking the teeth twelve times, chanting:

Mysterious light shines upon the Tai Yin, spreading and illuminating brightly, clearing the spirit, wrapping the chamber’s corners, gazing upwards to shine on Upper Clarity, five rays issuing from the bright platform, jade mushrooms naturally grow, penetrating and communicating with the Great Truth, myriad spirits observe my form, cutting away the nine yin breath, recording my Eastern Radiance name, preserving me without end, long enduring with sun and moon, severing and transiting the seven mysteries’ difficulties, the southern palace further receiving honour, bright light playing before the Jade Emperor, receiving the internal contemplation scripture, Heaven descends the flying mist carriage, soaring riding the green palanquin, obtaining to visit the Great Emperor’s hall, advancing to worship the Jade Emperor’s court.

Thus finished, bow twice more, facing the original life, raising the head, swallow the saliva seven times and cease.

Also always keep the bright lamp burning above the annual journey; at dawn face the lamp, knock the teeth twelve times, chant:

Bright lamp shines on the annual journey, scattering light illuminating the eight directions, the lustrous colours clear, internally observing the bright sky alike, unveiling and brightening the spiritual collar, you connect with the Jade Truth, looking up to the High Supreme Dao, distant and without trace, meditating to receive the descent of the mysterious clouds, holding the reins and riding the flying dragon, returning my hundred years’ span, again returning to infant’s form, granting me the western flower maiden, giving me the golden dawn youth, attending incense and annual fate, bowing before the Jade Emperor’s chamber, spirit peaceful and Dao also clear, fearing to enter the incense smoke, straightening the heart and focusing on the Great Mystery, essence moving to penetrate the void, the chamber summons the divine firmament to descend, closing the eyes fix the gaze on the immortal lords, severing the seven ancestors’ difficulties, transiting the form returning to the southern palace.

Thus finished, bow twice more, face the lamp, swallow the breath twice seven times and cease.

Always keep the bright lamp burning on the great year to communicate with the spirit, ordering the wish to seek truth. After three years the mysterious light shines within, spirit and truth descend, granting the method of immortality; then there will be response. Every dawn and dusk burn incense, knock the teeth twelve times, face the lamp and chant:

The lamp’s fire shines on the Great Truth, bright light penetrating the mysterious void, unveiling the unsurpassed Way, the heart focusing within the Jade Emperor’s abode, penetrating the empty hollow, spirit seeing the form freely stretched, accumulating response to bring spirit descent, heart tranquil and principle deep dwelling, morning worship at the Great Emperor’s hall, evening reciting the Golden Truth Scripture, roaming the mysterious capital’s wrapping, ten thousand years returning to infant state, Heaven crowns with purple misty clouds, the Emperor grants a green jade carriage, floating and roaming the five summit peaks, reaching satisfaction and obtaining as one wishes, the seven ancestors freed from the three paths, blessings and celebration abundant.

Thus finished, bow twice more, swallow the saliva twice seven times and cease.

If one can constantly keep the three lamps burning without extinguishment, the seven mysteries and nine ancestors shall attain to leave the ten sufferings, ascend the southern immortals, one’s entire spirit will be clear and correct, eyes seeing ten thousand li, ears hearing afar, mind and wisdom knowing what has not yet come, spirit and truth shall descend, the luminous children of the night shall instruct one in the Way of Immortality. Nine years thus, the spiritual light naturally brightens, communicating within and without. The five separations begin with the five Emperors, preserving the five mornings to transit life, the matter finished here.

The Emperor’s Five Wishes for Seeking Immortality

The Emperor often on the days of the ninth of the ninth month, fifth of the tenth month, third of the third month, eighth of the fourth month, seventh of the seventh month — these are the times of the five wishes and ten meetings — ascends the Tai Ji Jade Terrace, within the High Jade Palace and golden chamber, preserving the five wishes in the jade palace, hoping the Mysterious Truth will descend, the void opens to the Jade Emperor, golden sounds resound in the great void, summoning the five Emperors to guard the spirit, myriad blessings gathering in the cinnabar chamber, hence there is response calling forth the true, and the true also responds and descends.

On these days, one bathes and purifies, enters the chamber and burns incense, bows the heart to the four directions, arranges the seat facing straight, facing east, for it is where the sun begins to shine. Knock the teeth thirty-six times. The first great wish: That I may be born of the natural breath, the breath forming my body, my body equal to the Three Luminaries, long enjoying the limitless root. The second wish: That my body may always dwell above the great void, within the jade palace and jade chamber, dining with the Jade Emperor by day, resting with the Mysterious Mother by night, thirst quenched with bubbling jade mushrooms from the spring, hunger satisfied with dragon embryos, jade fat, red trees and children. The third wish: That my body may be born with myriad auspicious signs and seventy-two lights, strange hair and wondrous bones, feathers and garments, riding clouds and driving the void, entering and leaving the Emperor’s palace, myriad celebrations coming. The fourth wish: To live and die with the void, to die and be born again, born as the True Emperor, enfeoffed to govern the ten heavens, commanding the myriad immortals. The fifth wish: That all beings, born and unborn, may together protect the sun, moon and Three Luminaries; those with the Way, the seven mysteries’ ancestors, may ascend the southern palace; the blessing of all under Heaven, none undeserved. The four directions and five wishes assemble in the jade hall.

Next the great wish: That the nine mysteries nurture my body, the soul and spirit always dwelling in my palace, connecting above to the celestial immortals, below reaching the cave abyss. I wish heaven, earth, wind, spirits and immortals, the five wishes united, fixed in the register of longevity, Heaven descends the purple smoke, Earth guards the five spirits, riding clouds and driving the void, flying carriages and green palanquins, ascending the golden palace, advancing to Jade Clarity, blessing the seven ancestors, again receiving birth and life, the five wishes united, long enjoying benefit and uprightness.

The middle wishes are also five: To obtain the root of the Way, I wish Yin, Yang, Great Void, Great Nothing, Great Mystery, to dine in the jade chamber, with the Emperor’s cause, wandering and gazing at the place of birth, unveiling the bright nine heavens, the Primordial Father fixed in the register, the Mysterious Mother recording the years, peach health binding essence, protecting firmly the cinnabar field, the body ascending the golden palace, name recorded in the jade scroll, the seven ancestors freed, blessings and celebration arriving.

The lower wishes are also five: I wish Great Void, Great Being, Great Supreme, Great Truth, Divine Immortals to move my body on the five summit peaks, fluttering in the ninth heaven, entering and leaving the palace of opening and closing, escaping beyond the death door. I wish Heaven and Earth to be my parents, the Three Luminaries to guard me for ten thousand years, spirits guard the nine origins’ apertures, spirits descend the breath of nature, the eight directions and five wishes together respond.

When the five wishes are completed, knock the teeth twice seven times, chant:

Great Emperor Upper Origin, Emperor One Mysterious Scripture, five clouds scatter light, flourishing in the Three Purities, jade youths and maidens burn incense attending the spirit. The great wishes open and lay out, joining me in form, making me spirit and immortal, ascending the imperial court, the Northern Emperor casting down death, the Southern Pole attending life, Eastern Radiance Golden Pattern granting my superior name, infinite wishes, joining me together.

When finished, knock the teeth thrice seven times, raise the head and swallow the breath five times and cease.

This is the Emperor’s Way of Opening and Laying Out the Great Wishes, joining with the spirit in form. Those who can constantly do so shall have the jade radiance attending guard, jade youths scattering incense, penetrating the nine heavens, responding to the Emperor and Sovereign. After five years thus, the Way naturally descends.

In all directions of Heaven and Earth there are those who wish for the Way; the Way does not fail to descend to the heart of such. At the moment of the oral wish, the heart and intention must be united as one, no other thoughts or distractions; if the true spirit scatters and departs, the true will not descend. Treading in defilement and filth, the true is likewise distant. The Emperor’s Way of the Five Wishes and Five Meetings is finished here. When each day comes, if one can with refined heart and contemplation proceed according to the method, the Emperor dispatches jade youths to guard the body, summoning the five directions’ wishes, the Way of Immortality descends upon your form. After five years thus, one may ride clouds ascending the nine heavens, register a name among the splendour, the seven ancestors and grandparents also bearing blessings, able to leave the three paths and receive immortality in the southern palace.

The Southern Pole Upper Origin Lord says: The people of the world who study only know to seek in the morning and receive by evening, to utter incantations and hope for response, yet do not know to ascend the peak of Qi, to rise on mountain paths, a thousand zhang tree arising from a hair’s tip. The Way is lofty and truly subtle; how can one set foot and ascend a cloud ladder? The Emperor received the breath and mastered the truth, still holding the bright lamp to open communication, the five wishes to hope for blessings, how can they not encompass nature? The Way of seeking immortality always begins with wishing and then seeking the wish, to move and bring the spirit. The five wishes are great. The wishes encompass all; blessings cover all; celebrations flow everywhere, truly a freeing of wishes and goodness. If one can refine the heart on the wishes, there is nothing not to respond; those with feeling later, should return and inquire.

The Prime Minister Qing Tong Jun said: I studied and experienced seven hundred years, scaling steep peaks, crossing east and west, traversing south and north, roaming the central plains, with thirty-two masters, receiving over three hundred matters, but had not yet ascended the Golden Palace, nor visited the Holy Lord to receive the spiritual purple text, to serve the Way of binding souls with the yellow brilliance of sun and moon, to untie forms and transform the purple degree and flame light, to flow the golden fire bell, breathe out and receive the flying mist, soar the void, tread clouds, and step the seven treasures of the classic. The Holy Lord instructed on the Transit of the Seven Stars, treasured by the Great Emperor, commanding to sever the six palaces’ death names, fill and block the northeast ghost gate, then ascend the Heavenly Gate to transit my body; only then may one ascend the three origins and carry out the Way, becoming the Prime Minister commanding the myriad immortals.

The Seven Stars shine forth in heaven, revolving the nine origins’ essence, ascending and riding the three origins’ breath, commanding the six heavens’ names, birth and death, separation and union, all are by the Seven Stars. Hence man is made by the Dipper; where the Dipper adds, there is death; where the Dipper moves, there is life. Therefore the Seven Stars are the countenance of Heaven; the opening and closing is the palace of life transit. If one studies without knowing to sever the death gate at the Northern Dipper, or transit the life register at the southern gate, life cannot be preserved.

The Supreme Deity by this scripture transits the house of the six harmonies, commanding three hundred Western Flower Jade Maidens and Golden Dawn Jade Youths to guard the spiritual texts. Later transmitted to many Perfected Ones, it came forth from the famous mountains. The King of Western City later in the stone chamber of Wangwu mountain saw this text; the King had just ended a three-month fast, bearing credentials to the mountain, receiving the scripture with reverence; this is the Transit of the Seven Stars. Cultivate the Way, and attain Perfected Personhood. Those without a jade name to attain immortality have never heard or seen this Way.

Those with this scripture shall have their names recorded in the six palaces of Fengdu, and be transited to the southern gate. Moreover, if cultivating in practice? The King said: This originally had three scrolls, Heavenly Gate and Heavenly Diagrams two scrolls, not circulated in the world, received by the Lady of the Southern Peak, correctly obtaining one scroll of the Transit of the Seven Stars only.
