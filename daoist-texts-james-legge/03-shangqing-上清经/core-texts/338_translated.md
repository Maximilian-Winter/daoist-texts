### The Inner Text of the Qing Tong Chapter of the Shangqing Foreign Dispensation, Volume One

The Inner Text of the Gao Shangren Guoyin Yuan

The Shangqing Supreme True Jade Protector King, Grand Prime Minister and Grand Marshal, commanded the Master Gao Chen of the Eastern Sea Jade Gate, Qing Hua the Little Youth Lord, to receive from the Supreme Jade Emperor the Inner Text of the Yuan of the Foreign Dispensation. The Way therein is lofty and subtle; it was born before the Nine Mysteries, compounding the flying mysterious purple breath in natural chapters; the spiritual script manifests the extraordinary, radiant in Shangqing. Through ninety thousand kalpas it was inscribed on the mountain of the spirit bird of the country of Luona, set upon the shadow of piled stones on the Eastern Flowery Peak in the mysterious garden. The flowing light shines through the caverns, illuminating the lofty space; the sun and moon shine heroically; five dawns wing the spirit; eight elements intertwine in bands; four gatherings knot the smoke; flying clouds obscure the vapour; the spacious void court is luxuriant. Three hundred daughters of golden splendour and three hundred children of jade dawn attend as guards of the divine text. The Celestial Consort scatters incense, the spiritual wind spreads the truth; flying dragons and running beasts guard the jade passes; vermilion phoenixes stroke their wings; divine luans shade the mystery; the Western Flowery banquets and ceremonies; myriad saints pay homage at the pavilion.

On the first day of the third month, in the first year of the Central Emperor, at the time when the Heavenly Virtue concurs, the Grand Prime Minister Qing Tong Lord held a pure fast in the empty mountain, the golden-blue covenant with Heaven received from the Supreme One. He traversed the six states, crossing famous mountains, circled the five sacred peaks, trod the sources of rivers. The Five Emperors lend their wings, descending to summon the spirit pavilion; Saints of the Ten Realms hold wide ceremonies in the court, penetrating to the remote and desolate, grasping the formless. He channels essence and shines light to communicate the Way; the great sun stirs the lightning to issue its majesty. The Seven Origins move through the purple void; the Eight Scenes guide the reins to ascend in flight; chanting the jade sounds in the foreign land, he dispenses the divine dispensation to enter the subtle. He commands the Five Elders to arrange positions, summons myriad perfect ones to gather and return; the Nine Spirits agree in harmony, the Three Scenes combine their brilliance. The cinnabar spirit reports auspices; the Supreme One watches and reflects; he ascends to the position of Grand Prime Minister, named Purple Dawn; his person crowned with the robe of nine-coloured frost gauze, wearing the emblem of flowing light illuminating the spiritual cavern; the crown of the Spiritual Treasure’s myriad transformations, jingling bells falling in order, cinnabar clouds coiling ninefold. The daughters of golden splendour, children of purple dawn, each three thousand in number, attend as his guards.

Thus the Heavenly Mystery opens the resonance, exemplifies virtue responding to truth, exercises authority over the higher transformation, presides over the Nine Heavens, commands the whole world, universally leads myriad immortals; the register of life and death is without detail unconnected. The lord's virtue and the Way are complete, shining with jade purity, the seven origins blaze forth; the Five Elders attend the spirit, the Three Lights shine heroically; the Nine Emperors advance together, flying smoke and purple canopies, mysterious clouds born of the void. The Jade Maid raises her voice; the spirit string rings like a zither; the dragon roars, the phoenix sings; broad music fills the empty court; flying high around the sun, flowing lightning excites essence; splendid light mingles and scatters; the divine candles unite in brightness. Alone he rides the rhythm of the spirit talisman, waving the banner commanding demon spirits; roaming freely the hall of purple clouds, pacing the chamber of blue splendour; his might extends over the six heavens in coming fortune, cutting down myriad spirits among the hostile; gathering later scholars on the golden slips, checking the green registers of the various directions, extending the myriad emperors in the curving characters, expounding the treasure formula in the subtle chapters, enacting the Nine Mysteries through the cycles, unraveling the curving to reach the obscured; composing the independent to accord with the perfect; strictly guarding the Four Extremes to detect transgressions; commanding the Four Officers to execute punishment; marking the Five Emperors to correct errors; universally governing the boundless, the Four Corners, the Six States, the Five Sacred Mountains, countless myriads of perfected ones, none but are subject to the Blue Palace, serving the Grand Prime Minister.

Such is the precious text, the chapter of the Supreme Mysterious Void Nature, compounding the flying mysterious purple breath as hidden script, dispensing the thirty-six sounds of the foreign dispensation, setting the Six States under the offices of the Five Elders, to be practiced by those who have the Way and fly as immortals. The jade sound is clear and brilliant; the subtle meaning is ethereal and profound, all manifesting the resonance of the Supreme Ancient Sovereign. The Four Gatherings and Eight Reaches are joined to form the sound; the true intent is difficult to detail, its principle hard to pursue; unless one is born of the purple embryo, connected with the jade treasury, and a person who receives spirits through the nine apertures, they cannot comprehend its subtle resonance or communicate with the jade sound.

The Supreme One keeps it secret, hence it is handed down orally; the Nine Heavens on the left assist the festival with the Immortal Capital; on the right stand the attendant jade gentlemen and the five-direction spiritual officers, each fifty thousand in number, charged with guarding the precious text; jade children and jade maidens hold scarves to attend incense; the mysterious spirits and purple canopies scatter smoke in the distant court; the myriad perfected ones assemble, radiant in Shangqing. Thus the supreme holy jade emperor, on the day of the eight festivals, ascends the jade chamber, performs rites and chants sounds, the jade echoes resound clearly, shaking the Nine Heavens.

On the day this is written, the five stars emerge from their lodgings, the Seven Origins pause their rays, the Five Emperors float in their positions, myriad immortals assemble in court; a thousand demons lose their sight, legions of devils perish their essence; the majesty controls the six states, countless realms are purified; divine and marvelous transformations are ineffable; the flowing glances endure through boundless kalpas, the great transformation renews and freshens; the spirits are lofty and glorious, hard to name.

If one has this scripture, it is all carved on slips before birth, inscribed in the imperial register, the movement responds to the immortal. Some heavenly perfected descend and obtain this text; or in the world by fate encounter a master of the scripture; dreams and resonant visions respond, uniting with the true spirit. Upon receiving the jade sound, one should burn incense in a quiet chamber, make vows to cultivate practice, chant it once; myriad perfected ones assemble, the Five Elders pay homage, heavenly demons bow their heads, a thousand fiends lose their essence, the majesty shakes the six states, summons immortals and brings forth the true. Nine years, the Three Origins come to the chamber, descending cloud chariots, flying to Shangqing.

If one has this scripture but cannot practice in the world, yet offers devoted heart and sustenance, then twelve jade children and twelve jade maidens will attend on either side to guard the bearer, warding off myriad disasters, exorcising weapons, a thousand troubles and ten thousand harms dare not rashly approach; the Five Emperors protect and guard. One may obtain the lower immortals, or undergo corpse transformations, wheel revolutions, ascend to the spirit chamber, but cannot accept the appointment of the Jade Void, only roaming among the Three Purities.

### The Thirty-six Insignias of the Six States

The Heavens and Earth, and the Five Directions, each have colours controlling hardness and softness, forbidding collapse. The earth is deep twenty billion li, receiving moisture; below the moisture twenty billion li is the Golden Millet Marsh; beneath that twenty billion li is the adamantine iron marsh; deep within twenty billion li is the water marsh; beneath the water marsh eighty billion li is the Great Wind Marsh; below the Great Wind Marsh five hundred and twenty billion li is the framework of heaven and earth, governing so that it does not fall, as the sun, moon, and stars are held by the wind. Scholars who do not know the moist depths beneath, the colours and depths, then the Five Emperors only float their bodies in the foreign realm.

The Eastern Fu’er Da, ninety thousand li beyond the extreme, a wilderness of grand forests, its country called the kingdom of Hēluó tí, its territory regular and circular, land colour like fresh green fat, no hills or mounds, spanning ninety thousand li. The people are two zhang tall, living four hundred years. The country has six sound insignias; these are the beginnings of the Supreme Qi set in the foreign Hu Lao dispensation. The Supreme One often chants its sounds to transform the Hu Lao people, to make them know that the foreign land has the teaching of immortality. If the people all perform rites and chant the sounds, they obtain four hundred years of life without premature death. Scholars who know the foreign land’s colours and often chant the six sounds attain the immortal official Wei Zhao’s body; after nine years, naturally they obtain a visit to the kingdom of Hēluó tí, conversing with Hu Lao, transforming and flying in the void, roaming the eastern extreme.

The Eastern Hēluó tí Kingdom:

- First Insignia Sound: Shàn ā yí tí nà wéi
- Second Insignia Sound: Yuè jiā mó xū yún chí
- Third Insignia Sound: Tán zhēn shì zhē yuán tuó
- Fourth Insignia Sound: Gào bō jūn yùn wū zǐ
- Fourth Insignia Sound: Xī jìn líng fǎ pó yí
- Sixth Insignia Sound: Shè lí dìng qū ní tái

In the Eastern Hēluó tí kingdom, six sounds are dispensed, Hu Lao titles set; the wise are as long-lived as heaven and earth, cultivate the Way, thus foreign flying immortals come to guard their bodies. On the day of the Tai Sui, their birth fate, and eight festivals, the six sound insignias are written in blue, one garment donned, facing eastwards with nine knocks of the teeth, chanting the six sounds six times. Afterwards, they close the eyes, calm the body and mind, discard other thoughts, think of the Eastern boundless realm, the realm of Hēluó tí, clear and comprehended, imagining the innumerable Hu Lao immortal officials all coming to pay homage and chant the foreign sounds. Then a subtle prayer:

Heaven and Earth open the realm, eight reaches bright and clear, penetrating the infinite, the name of the foreign land, dispensed sounds transforming, binding qi into spirit, summoning immortals and bringing forth truth; countless myriads all together, deeply probing the mysterious subtle; watching and reflecting formless; responding above and below; inside and outside purified; green rosy wheels fly, coming to assist my form, guiding my ascent, north to visit Jade Capital.

Afterwards, breathing is held nine times, then stopped. This is the Supreme Dispensation of the foreign land’s divine immortal highest method; practice it for nine years and summon immortal officials, perceiving the subtle, speaking with spirits, flying in the void, ascending white day to heaven.

The Southern Yánfúlì, three hundred thousand li beyond the extreme, the wilderness of Yang in the cave, its country’s name is Yīshātuó, a kingdom of Fire Court in India. Outside the country is the Long Continent, also called the Green Hill, five thousand li square, twenty-five thousand li from the shore. There grow great trees three thousand zhang tall, some two thousand circumference, many spiritual herbs, sweet nectar and jade essence, all things complete. The people live three hundred and sixty years. There are spiritual fox beasts, some as big as dogs, coloured in five hues; their cries resound four thousand li, mighty over tigers, leopards, and myriad birds; their fur is worn as clothing, their longevity equal to heaven and earth. To the left is Wind Mountain, whose constant rumbling is the Purple Palace, where celestial immortals and jade maidens roam and view. Also the Flame Continent in the South Sea center, two thousand li wide, ninety thousand li from the shore, with wind-born beasts like leopards, blue in colour, as large as martens; fire accumulates to the sky, burning for months without dying, their fur not burning, incisions unable to pierce; struck thousands of times they die, but open-mouthed to the wind, soon revive; plugging their nostrils with stone calamus causes death. Their brains combined with chrysanthemum flowers are taken as medicine, longevity equals heaven and earth. Also the Fire Forest Mountain, with fire-light beasts as large as mice, fur three or four cun long, red or white; at midnight their light shines as if on fire; their fur is woven into cloth called fire-washing cloth, which when soiled is renewed by fire. The people of Yīshātuó wear this fur, immortals descend their forms. Scholars who know the country’s sounds and think on the thirty-six years of the Yue Lao officials will have the divine beasts and wondrous things of the country offered to them.

The Southern Yīshātuó kingdom dispenses six sounds, sets Yue Lao titles; the wise live as long as heaven and earth, cultivate the Way, thus foreign flying immortals come to guard their bodies. On the day of the Tai Sui, birth fate, and eight festivals, the six sound insignias are written in vermilion; entering the chamber facing south to wear, knocking teeth nine times, chanting the six sounds six times. Afterwards, close the eyes, calm the spirit and breath, discard other thoughts, think of the Southern boundless realm, clear and bright, imagining countless Yue Lao immortal officials coming to pay homage. Then a subtle incantation:

High spirit hangs and reflects, dispersing to the vermilion palace, flowing six sounds, binding into cinnabar form; myriad immortals come to pay homage, paired with true life; penetrating the eight lights, witnessing the Hua chamber; dividing scenes of Shangqing, issuing in blue entering yellow; five colours flow essence, making bright light for me; obtaining visits to the six states, ascending to jade halls, receiving immortal rites and garments; flying in blue feather robes, flowing gold bands, phoenix patterns and purple chapters; true with the emperor, shining form in Jade Capital.

Afterwards, breathing is held nine times, then stopped. Practice nine years, summon Southern Yue Lao immortal officials to guard and attend the form, inspect the subtleties of the void, commune with spirits, summon flying clouds and mysterious dragons to welcome.

The Western Junayi, seven hundred thousand li beyond the extreme, the ridge of white purity, its country's name is Nīwēiluó Lǜnà, the land full of high ridges, adjoining the Western Gate of Heaven; the soil white as jade, area sixty-eight thousand li. The people are one zhang six chi tall, living six hundred years. The country has six sound insignias; these are set by the Supreme One among the foreign Di Lao dispensation.

Then a subtle incantation:

Afterwards, breathing held nine times, then stopped. Practice nine years, summon Northern Qiang Lao immortal officials to guard and attend the form, penetrating the obscure and remote, fully observing yet unseen matters, commune with spirits, fly in the void, ascend Purple Dawn.

Above the Nine Heavens is the Clear Yang Void, without colour or image, without form or shadow; an empty and hollow inscription of Original Essence, the natural country of Blue Chaos, using blue qi as the fragrance of the world, the highest peak without limit, covering the Four Heavens. Thus the Supreme Jade Emperor, the myriad sacred emperors, receive their root of birth, without life span or measure, only kalpa as their year. Within this hollow is also the six sound inscription, the Original Beginning set among the True Sovereign Nature dispensation. The Supreme One chants its sounds to extend the assembly of immortals, to make them know the mysterious void has countless truth.

The Supreme One’s secret method has no golden names or purple slips, nor green characters of Shangqing. One may not practice this Way without them. Whosoever rashly divulges to others brings disaster upon the Seven Ancestors, is arrested by the Three Officials, and perishes with no hope of immortality; therefore be careful in observance.

The Great Wind Marsh directly beneath China, five hundred and twenty billion li distant, is the source of rigidity and maintenance of the earth, governing so that it does not fall; soil colour like golden essence. China’s sounds are the insignias of the Great Harmonious Treasure True Boundless Country. The Central Mountain Kunlun lies at its centre, the various heavens’ alternative names; above is the Mysterious Garden’s Seven Treasure Pearl Palace, meeting the end of Heaven, the abode of upper true flying immortals. China measures one hundred and twenty billion li in circumference; its people are nine chi tall, all studying guiding and stretching arts, living one thousand two hundred years. The country has six sound insignias; these are set by the Supreme One among China’s dispensation. The Supreme Jade Emperor chants and chants its sounds to transform the ancient people of China, making them know the country has the teaching of immortality. If the people all cultivate the Shangqing Way, perform rites and chant, they obtain one thousand two hundred years without untimely death. Scholars who know China’s colours and chant and cultivate thus obtain the ancient immortal official Wei Zhao’s body; after nine years, naturally they converse with the ancient, ascend to the great void, flying in Shangqing.

- First Insignia Sound: Dìng shì yīn jié róng hé
- Second Insignia Sound: Zhōng bǎo zhū ruò lái huá
- Third Insignia Sound: Guǎng yuán yuán lǐ yún ā
- Fourth Insignia Sound: Tiáo qióng fēn jìn shì luó
- Fifth Insignia Sound: Dòng líng yīn jiě shì tuó
- Sixth Insignia Sound: Jīn gēn bǎo zhū yáng pó

On days of Tai Sui, birth fate, and eight festivals, the six sound insignias are written in yellow; enter the chamber facing birth fate to wear, knock teeth nine times, chant the six sounds six times. Afterwards, close eyes, calm spirit and intention, discard thoughts; think of China beneath the great wind marsh, entering the abyss five hundred and twenty billion li deep, clear and distinct; imagining countless ancient immortal officials coming to pay homage. Then a prayer:

Central plain is total truth, myriad emperors mysterious spirits, Nine Heavens lower records, binding qi and condensing essence, great yellow vast court of billions of zhang; China dispenses sounds, dividing six names; jade faces bright sky, penetrating subtlety entering blue; flowing truth spreading and covering, nurturing my form; transforming great harmony, treasure truth beneficial and upright; beneath the cave no abyss, ascending Jade Clarity.

Afterwards, breathing held nine times, then stopped. Practice nine years, perfected ones descend, granting true sounds; converse with ancient immortal officials, ride the void, fly in the void, ascend the emperor’s dawn.

The Supreme One set the Six States’ sound insignias, transformed into thirty-six sounds; at the beginning of the Original Beginning, carved in metal and stone, each set in a country, now all sealed at the national borders, or sealed in the caves of the Five Sacred Mountains. For example, China’s sound faces the shadow of piled stones in the Mysterious Garden. Such divine text is guarded by purple dawn jade children, blue splendour jade maidens, each three hundred persons, guarding incense. The former code is to be transmitted through myriad kalpas, given to the perfected ones; those who obtain this text are exalted as immortal lords, can circulate through the six states, converse with the Five Elders, penetrate the mysteries and void; drive and command myriad spirits; if without jade bones, carved on purple slips before birth, one may not obtain this text; those who obtain it without learning become middling immortals. Lightly divulging the precious sounds, the Seven Ancestors charge; the turning of mountains and bearing stones, myriad kalpas not forgiven; one’s body is examined by the world’s wind and knife, death falling into hell, no further immortality.

Wearing this text, roaming the six states, crossing the five sacred peaks, traversing famous mountains, reaching their borders, one should first knock teeth thirty-six times, hold breath thirty-six breaths, and chant:

Jade True roams, cloud chariots soaring, this day most auspicious, dragons fly, phoenixes soar, arrayed in feathered order; the four ways open, six teachers guide; the Ten Realms come to welcome, immortal youths hold banners, jade maidens scatter incense, Five Elders bow deeply; winged and vast; sun and moon interweave; spirit immortals assist and command; traversing the six states, circulating the four regions, four rivers, five sacred peaks, as my bridges; the emperor’s commands sweep away misfortune; everywhere all is auspicious; divine marvels of the strange directions; immortal refinement flourishes within; the foreign lands are clear; ascending Jade Capital.

Afterwards, drawing in breath thirty-six times, then stop. This is the Grand Spell of the Grand Prime Minister’s Roaming Majesty, practicing it governs the six states, subdues myriad spirits, summons immortal officials to court; transformations without form, ascending to Great Clarity.

The recipient fasts seven or thirty days; during the fast carries thirty-two chi of blue patterned silk; one gold fish, one jade dragon; nine pairs of gold rings; five taels of gold in place of the vow to cut hair and tear silk. The master faces north to announce the covenants and transmit; disciples receive and observe the Four Extremes’ discipline, collecting carefully, forbidding breaches, practicing in secrecy and reverence.

The Supreme True Jade Protector King, Grand Prime Minister and Grand Marshal, commanded the Master Gao Chen of the Eastern Sea Jade Gate, Qing Hua the Little Youth Lord, to receive from the Supreme Jade Emperor, transmitting the Four Extremes’ perfected ones, commanding the Five Emperors’ divine soldiers, punishing leaks of the vow, violations of the covenant; the Seven Ancestors charge; one’s own life is lost; three disciples and five sufferings; myriad kalpas unforgiven.

### The Inner Text of the Qing Tong Chapter of the Shangqing Foreign Dispensation, Volume Two

The Supreme Nine Mysteries Thirty-six Heavens Inner Sounds

The Supreme Nine Mysteries hollow thirty-six heavens, deep abyss nine earths foreign dispensation inner sounds, were born before the Great Void Nine Mysteries, compounding the flying mysterious purple qi natural chapter; the spiritual script is lofty and high in the clouds; the true light shines in Shangqing; the marvels manifest the extraordinary in the Great Han; jade sounds ring clearly in the Golden Court; wind returns flowing in purple smoke; incense spreads over the eight darknesses; cinnabar brightness shines its jade stems; vermilion sun irrigates its divine truth; flowing through countless kalpas, empty descending into the void mysterious; three elements open the cycles; nine degrees push and move; spiritual sounds appear and manifest; inscribed on the Kunlun mountain, above the Mysterious Garden piled stone’s shadow; the script’s brilliance hangs like rays, essence shines on high heaven; sun and moon equal their light; five stars share their brightness; four gatherings, eight reaches, penetrating Jade Clarity; flying immortals and purple youths each three hundred persons; guarding incense awaiting spirits; wearing the beast of the Jasper Heaven; guarding with ten thousand layers of golden heads; nine colours flow like clouds atop; the divine luan and vermilion phoenix stroke their pavilion; Five Emperors inspect truth; Four Extremes govern immortals; Seven Luminaries emit essence to illuminate; jade splendour scatters truth to decorate dust; traversing the Yang and Yin without weariness; through myriad kalpas ever fresher. At the first year of the Central Emperor, third month, first day, the Heavenly Virtue concurs; the Supreme True Jade Protector King and Grand Prime Minister commanded the Master Gao Chen of the Eastern Sea Jade Gate, Qing Hua the Little Youth Lord, to purify fasting nine hundred days in the upper palace, the blue-gold covenant with Heaven, receiving from the Supreme Jade Emperor; traversing the various heavens, penetrating the void and nothingness; flowing glances through countless crossings; observing the boundless above; playing broadly in the vast hall; circuiting the six states; revolving through the nine mysteries; the Four Officers inspect and test; Upper Origin sets immortals; Jade Void reflects downward; Turtle Mother descends true; Eight Scenes hold reins; Five Elders wing the pavilion; flying immortals race each other; Eight Winds play with smoke; flowing lightning excites majesty; a hundred suns emit essence; jade wheels shine in void; feathered canopies luxuriate mysteriously; golden children scatter splendour; jade maidens brush dust; myriad spirits bow; Five Sacred Peaks pay homage to truth; various heavens hold calm ceremonies; Ten Directions govern welcomes; commanding myriad paths; universally supervising myriad immortals; ascending to Grand Prime Minister position; presiding over Gao Chen; truly by the Supreme Jade Emperor’s subtle decree; the thirty-six heavens’ jade sounds govern life and death in the register; hold immortal titles in the blue palace; command golden names in the mysterious record; control white slips in jade chapters; overseeing boundless boundless boundless below; embracing the deep abyss nine earths myriad spirits; Five Sacred Peaks, Four Extremes, rivers and seas myriad immortals; to the thirty-six states, none but are subject to Qing Tong. The former code transmits through myriad kalpas; the nine five eras; the three dynasties merge; there should be jade names inscribed in the imperial register for thirty-six persons; those who see their texts and wear these sounds, the nine earths erase traces, six states invite and welcome; thirty-six heavens’ inscriptions; the upper palace Three Origins descend; naturally become immortals. The mysterious canon is contained in the cave’s source; the spiritual track is lofty beyond measure; jade bay deep and hard to fathom; wondrous transformation hard to repeat; roughly one per thousand; roughly marked one truth among myriad marvels.

The heavens’ inner inscriptions, nine earths thirty-six sounds, preserved with the Original Beginning; hollow and spiritual titles, natural names manifesting in the nine mysteries; unfolding to foreign lands’ thirty-six sounds. Thus Heaven and Earth each have thirty-six divisions; the heavens have thirty-six heavenly kings responding to thirty-six states; the earth has thirty-six soil emperors responding to the thirty-six heavens. The heavenly kings and true soil emperors govern immortals; those who study without knowing the heavens’ inner sounds, then the heavenly kings do not lead the heralded names, do not know the earth’s sounds; soil emperors do not erase traces, cannot close immortality. Those who see their texts, receive their secret sounds; heavenly kings’ mysterious mirror; seven saints inscribe chapters; western turtle fixed record; eastern flowery inscribed names; soil emperors erase corpses and traces; nine yin protect and recommend Shangqing; Five Spirits reverently guard; Ten Realms assist and welcome; circuiting six states; pacifying and destroying evil hordes; five weapons crush and subdue; heavenly demons bind form; nine years riding the void; flying in Shangqing. The true Way is lofty and subtle; must not be rashly declared; lightly divulging the precious sounds, the Seven Ancestors charge; one’s body perishes; three paths and five sufferings; myriad kalpas unforgiven; perfected ones must observe discipline.

The heavenly kings often on the eight festivals and new moons, roam viewing the boundless, traverse the cloud chambers, roam free in Jade Clarity, flowing glances over ten directions; on the bright rosy clouds, often chant the heavens’ inner sounds, flying mysterious chapters; upper rejoicing of Heaven’s truth; inner joy of the spirit robes; jade sounds hollow and clear; jade rhymes combined in harmony.
