# The Grand Diagram of the Jade Morning, the Turbid Regulation, the Knotted Lint, and the Flight to the Sun and Moon by the Most High

Title of the Scripture: The Grand Diagram of the Jade Morning, the Turbid Regulation, the Knotted Lint, and the Flight to the Sun and Moon by the Most High. The compiler is unknown; it was probably composed during the Northern and Southern Dynasties. It is a compilation and adaptation drawn from the Nine Perfect Middle Scriptures. One scroll. The original source is: The Orthodox Daoist Canon, Cave of Mystery Section, Category of Spirit Diagrams.

### The Grand Diagram of the Jade Morning, the Turbid Regulation, the Knotted Lint, and the Flight to the Sun and Moon by the Most High

The Middle Chapter of the Hidden Book of the Most High says: "If you desire to become a True One, you must cherish the Lord of the Sun, drive the dragon and harness the phoenix, ride the heavenly shining clouds, journey eastward to the rare forest, and then enter the Gate of the Emperor. With focused thought, you shall obtain it. The essential Way is not burdensome; it is called the Supreme Pure Spirit. The ranks of true officials hold the script of the Turbid Regulation."

The Middle Chapter of the Hidden Book of the Most High says: "If you desire to ascend to Heaven, you must cherish the Lady of the Moon, drive the ten celestial dragons, ride upon my flowing bells, and proceed westward to the Six Ridges. Then enter the Emperor’s Hall. With focused thought, you shall behold the court of the Heavenly Sovereign, and hold the chapter of the Knotted Lint."

The rightward Flight to the Sun and Moon is the secret treasure of the Most High, the Supreme Pure, the Great Ultimate, the Nine Emperors and Four True Men, the jade chapter of the Mysterious and Profound Lord. Unless one has the Golden Pavilion Jade Name and the Recorded Characters of Eastern Splendour, one may neither hear nor see these two chapters. Those who practise it must first purify themselves by fasting a hundred days, and sever all human relations; only then may it be performed. Persevering in it for long, one ascends in flight to the Sun and Moon, receiving fifty jade youths and jade maidens each. The crimson script of the Turbid Regulation and the yellow chapter of the Knotted Lint are the secret scriptures of the Most High Jade Emperor. They are stored in the chambers of the Nine Heavens, on the platform of cinnabar and jade. Unless one is diligent in heart and loves the True, and already possesses the record of the bones of the Flying Profound Heaven Immortals, none shall see or hear them. Hearing of these chapters, none may rashly speak or mention them. Whoever rashly speaks or mentions them, the offender will be examined by the Three Officials and Heaven and Earth will not pardon. At first, one in three hundred years may receive and propagate it once; afterward, after seven hundred years, another may again receive it. If the Divine Truth invisibly reveals the need for transmission, then transmit it. The method of transmission is that master and friend mutually give it, to exalt the Profound Arts. If not by such persons, not following the law and order, the heavenly writings will be leaked. Neglect and breach of oath cause death and descent to lower ghosts, which is the sin of the seven ancestors who were scourged by the wind blades. Unless of the same spirit, best to keep silence. In the Western Profound Mountain’s cave platform are these two scriptures, engraved on jade slips and written in golden characters. Also in the Pure Void of Wangwu, there are copies, though not complete. The officials among the immortals and the Supreme Pure officials do not know what these books are about. In the northern cave of Mount Emei, in the stone chamber with a pivot door, there is an inscription in stone: "The Turbid Regulation draws in the Sun’s essence; the Knotted Lint brings forth the Moon’s spirit. Those who attain the Way are high officials of rank, entitled Great True Men." There are twenty characters in all. The immortals who see it do not understand the meaning of this matter at all. Among such immortals there are many who never see the catalogues of these chapters. The Golden Liquid and Nine Cinnabars, indeed minor arts, do not permit flight to the Supreme Pure. Those who desire to practise this Way need not be wise or foolish, only that on earth such writings be absent. The true officials’ mysterious methods open the oath and transmit it; those who obtain it and practise become high True Ones, riding the eight shining jade wheels, journeying through the nine dawns. Hence the secret saying: "If you obtain the Turbid Regulation and Knotted Lint, then you become a True One of the Supreme Pure. Without cultivating this Way, you shall not see the Lords of the Three Primes."

The True Man of the Great Origin said: "If you cherish the Sun’s essence, the Five Emperor Lords, and orally contain the script of the Most High Turbid Regulation, you must complete this Way to behold the Lord at noon; without this, you toil in vain and vex yourself with grievance." Again he said: "If you cherish the Moon’s essence, the Five Emperor Ladies, and orally contain the chapter of the Most High Knotted Lint, you must complete this Way to behold the Lady of the Moon; without this, you labor in vain and bewail yourself."

These two passages were received by the True Man of the Great Origin from the secret instructions of the Great Emperor Lord. The Hidden Book of the Most High says: "In preserving, hold them." The Emperor Lord says: "Contain them."

The True Man of the Great Origin taught Lord Pei to contain in preservation one text and hold in preservation another, and practise them both.

The True Man of the Great Origin transmitted to the True Spirit Man Lord Pei two matters: the script of the Most High Turbid Regulation and Knotted Lint, by which the spirits of the Sun and Moon are reached; the flight to the Sun and Moon, the Way of traversing the heavenly radiance and flying in the great void. All ride cloud chariots and feathered canopies, harnessing the dragons of fate, and ascend to the Emperor’s Purple Court.

In inner vision of the central direction it is said: "If you desire to tread the void, you must cherish the Sun and Moon. If you desire to ascend to the Pure Spirit, you must cherish the Five Stars. Secret chambers, secret practice, not going beyond your door and courtyard — this is called thus."

The Simple Spell of the Cinnabar Talisman says: "Great is the Turbid Regulation, wondrous is the Knotted Lint, not to be seen by lesser True Ones, not to be heard by lesser immortals. It brings forth the spirits of the Sun and Moon’s Five Essences, riding dragons to tread the void, capturing the shining clouds, pursuing the Five Emperors, entering the Heavenly Gate. If any hear of it, be careful not to rashly speak. On leaving the world it may be discharged; sworn by gold to transmit it to disciples. Those with heart who rashly speak of the chapters, the jade youths report it above; if leaked, the offender is examined, and at death does not become immortal. The jade youths and jade maidens depart and do not return; the writings must be lost, and the Three Officials punish. You should be careful in speech, for speech is the source of guilt."

The Solar Palace

The Principles of the Jade Hall say: "At the beginning of the month, sit facing east, purify with clarity and tranquillity, click your teeth thirty-six times until communication is clear, first cherish your own cinnabar field as a great sea, the sun rises from the sea. Seat yourself at the crown of your head, body like a mountain rock, and chant:

‘Yang arises in the primal sea, ascending from below; mingling yang essence disperses many yin. Within is the great spirit, the Lord of the Turbid Regulation, descending this true qi, washing my form.’

The Principles of the Jade Hall say: "After chanting, swallow saliva nine times, next cherish the rising sun; golden light illuminates my true form, I face the Sun Palace, and chant:

‘Golden wheel presents auspice, shining bright with yang clarity; fiery light rushes flying, ten thousand li flowing essence; demons vanish extinguished, dust and filth swept clean; soaring steps through emptiness, riding qi to ascend high.’

The Principles of the Jade Hall say: "After chanting, swallow saliva nine times, next ride the fire dragon to the Sun Palace, and chant:

‘Fire dragon leads ahead, piercing crown flying bright; spirit enters the void, paying homage to the Turbid Regulation; in an instant commanding, mingling spirit radiance; one true pursues the root, burning away the bloated corpse.’

The Principles of the Jade Hall say: "After chanting, swallow saliva nine times, and meditate entering the Sun Palace, becoming one with the body, long forgetting form, warm as spring. Practising this for a year dispels disease, commanding ghosts and spirits to come and go naturally; two years bring communion with immortals, the three realms attend; three years bring the protection of the demon kings; nine years accomplish merit, the Five Emperors descend to befriend, and issue a decree making you a True Man, attaining longevity."

The Grand Jade Morning Turbid Regulation Flight to the Sun with Crimson Radiance Jade Script

The Spirit Book in purple characters says: "The method of gathering and wearing the flying roots, swallowing the sun’s qi, was formerly bestowed by the Emperor Lord of the Supreme Microcosm Heaven, also called the Red Cinnabar Golden Essence Stone Radiance Water-Mother Jade Embryo Scripture. The method is always at sunrise, facing east, clicking teeth nine times, then softly invoking the sun soul’s name. The Solar Noon Five Emperor characters are:

‘Sun Soul, Vermilion Radiance, Illuminating the Sheath, Green Reflecting Returning Clouds, Red Youth, Mysterious Flame, Whirlwind Elephant.’

Calling these sixteen characters firmly, cherish the flowing five-coloured clouds of solar noon coming to receive the body; the sun’s light and flowing clouds all enter the mouth."

The Supreme Pure Purple Book says: "The method of swallowing the moon’s essence: at moonrise, face west, click teeth ten times, softly invoke the moon spirit’s name. The Moon Lady’s characters are:

‘Moon Spirit, Warm and Gentle, Fragrant and Beautiful, Enveloping and Lofty, Graceful and Vacuous, Spiritual Orchid, Turbid and Rich, Knotted and Elevated, Pure Gold, Clear and Bright, Radiant Face, Platform Mark.’

Chant these twenty-four characters; then close eyes and grasp firmly, cherishing the five-coloured essence light of the moon all entering the mouth. There is also among the moonlight a yellow vapour as large as the pupil, called the flying splendid jade embryo’s essence. Those who cultivate this way become immortals who fly to the sun and moon."

In all practising the Turbid Regulation flight to the sun Way, at dawn always watch for the time of the sunrise; if no sun, be in a quiet chamber, facing east to the sun, clicking teeth nine times, then closing eyes and holding breath for nine breaths, then swallowing the sun’s radiance nine times, cherishing the light and clouds to enter the mouth, then swallow. After which softly call:

"Blue Emperor of the sun, named Yuan-chang, styled Illumining Dragon Sheath, clad in blue jade brocade cape, with azure feathers and flying skirt, wearing green lotus morning crown."

"Red Emperor of the sun, named Dan Ling-shi, styled Green Rainbow Reflection, clad in crimson jade brocade cape, with vermilion feathers and flying skirt, wearing red lotus spiritual bright crown."

"White Emperor of the sun, named Hao Yu-jiang, styled Returning Golden Radiance, clad in white jade brocade cape, with white feathers and flying skirt, wearing shining spiritual lotus crown."

"Black Emperor of the sun, named Cheng Qin-ting, styled Mysterious Green Flame, clad in dark jade brocade cape, with black feathers and flying skirt, wearing mysterious mountain lotus crown."

"Yellow Emperor of the sun, named Shou Yi-fu, styled Whirlwind Radiance Elephant, clad in yellow jade brocade cape, with yellow feathers and flying skirt, wearing yellow spirit purple crown."

The moon lady’s soul essence inner spirit is named Warm and Gentle Platform Mark.

Three times chanting, closing eyes and holding firmly, cherish seeing the five-coloured flowing clouds of the sun all coming to receive the body, descending to the feet, and cherish the five qi ascending to the crown. Thereupon the sunlight and clouds’ five colours all enter the mouth. Among them is a purple vapour as large as the pupil, layered many tens, glowing within the five-coloured light, named the flying root water-mother. All these with the five qi enter the mouth. Facing the sun, swallow the clouds with forty-five swallows of breath. After which, swallow saliva ten times. Then click teeth nine times and softly invoke:

"Red furnace cinnabar qi, perfect round heaven flying essence, hard receiving softness, fiery water yin essence, sun and stars primal radiance, called Great Bright, nine yang all transform, two mists both arise, condensing soul harmonizing spirit, essence of five qi, producing five emperors in the midst, riding light to govern form, gathering flight to emptiness, sipping root to fill, head wrapped with dragon splendour, cape vermilion belt azure, reins black flowing dark, clouds reflecting Supreme Pure, granting books jade slips, golden pavilion carved names, wearing and eating morning clouds, uniting with the Way’s spirit, flying immortal of Supreme Microcosm, ascending the Purple Court."

Having finished the invocation, cherish the Blue Emperor Lord descending from the sunlight to my left; cherish the Red Emperor Lord descending from the sunlight to my right; cherish the White Emperor Lord descending from the sunlight behind me; cherish the Black Emperor Lord descending from the sunlight above my left hand; cherish the Yellow Emperor Lord descending from the sunlight above my right hand. The Five Emperors all come; cherish wearing their colours in utmost likeness. Then click teeth five times, swallow saliva nine times, softly invoke:

"Red furnace cinnabar radiance, perfect brightness of nine, great brilliance opens morning, shining flame vermilion essence, five emperors initiate clouds, illuminating the cave of myriad beings, observing fallen True Ones, empty without boundary, moving qi refining essence, flowing dispersing five forms, making my spirit transform, six viscera spread spirit, united with Emperor Lords, Great Yi without brilliance, harnessing scarlet clouds, sun drill nine wheels, ascending to the sun’s noon, uniting spirits with Emperor, life equal to Heaven and Earth, two dawns tilt one another."

Having finished, click teeth three times, swallow saliva three times, then softly invoke:

"Moon spirit essence, Warm and Gentle Platform Mark, grant me to obtain, the sun’s cave heaven, Eastern Mountain Long Hill, granted the chapter of wielding spirit, wearing the talisman of the nine existences, eating the blue essence candy, drinking the cloud green fat, feasting in the domain of the Eight Extremes, ascending the platform of the luminous True, sitting in the rare forest hall, chanting the words of the Jade Morning."

Having finished the invocation.

On the right is the flowing bell flying cloud chariot, driving ten yellow dragons, coming from the moonlight before me, still cherishing to ride with the five ladies and rushing to the moon. Entering my form, long after swallowing saliva fourteen times, then closing eyes and deeply reflecting, cherishing thoughts as if, then again bowing to the moon. Those who can long practise this Way surely obtain riding the radiance to fly to the moon; this is the completion of the Way of Knotted Lint. The key to practice is as in swallowing moonlight; if able to swallow it each evening, one will immediately feel the body born with jade brilliance and the eyes possess flying essence.

The essential days are the 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, 14th, 16th, 18th, 22nd, 24th, and 26th of the month; eleven times in all in one month suffice to become immortal. On these evenings the yin essence flies and joins, the three qi fill and overflow, the moon water forms splendour, and the yellow spirit descends to receive it. Practising eighteen years, the Supreme Pure shall refine the soul and change the substance, illuminating with jade brilliance, riding the mysterious reins and radiance, flying in the great void.

The Purple Microcosm method of swallowing the moon essence, the Supreme Profound Yin Birth talisman

At midnight of the last night of the month, in yellow script on blue paper, facing east swallow it, to first inform the moon soul. At this time one must first swallow the Opening Brightness Spirit Talisman. When swallowing the moon talisman, hold breath, right hand holding the talisman, and in heart chant:

"Purple Microcosm yellow script, named Supreme Profound, bringing the moon’s splendour water, nourishing soul and harmonizing spirit, in central solemn rites, issuing from the mysterious gateway, concealing Heaven’s hidden moon, the five spirit ladies, flying light nine ways, illuminating the bright mud pellet."

Having finished the chant, swallow the talisman.

It is said: "He who knows the moon spirit’s name shall have no disasters in life, and all harm shall not injure him. The Most High stores the names of the sun and moon emperor ladies in the Palace of Great Origin; those who know them are divine immortals."

It is said: "He who knows the sun soul’s name shall have no sickness in life, and all calamities shall not befall him. The Most High stores the sun and moon soul names in the Purple Void Jade Palace; those who know them communicate with spirits and employ the divine."

Those who preserve the Way of Flight to the Sun and Moon use it as suits convenience; it need not be done in full. If one desires to have a quiet chamber and concealment, only to see the first radiance of the sun and moon. If one does not sever human affairs and is involved with external things, one cannot practise this Way. At night regularly burn incense, cherish the names of the Five Emperors and Five Ladies, and in heart chant: "May I unite with the Emperor Lords, the Supreme One, and the Five Spirits, merging radiance as one."

Thus practising for twenty-four years, one also ascends to Heaven in broad daylight, without needing to practise flight or preservation. Constantly cherish them at my sides, and in heart chant. The ancient saying forbids letting ears hear it. If one has already attained the immortal Way and fully refined essence and thought, preserving it for two years will bring visions, three years will manifest form, five years will enable flight to the sun and moon. Unless already immortal, if one begins only to refine essence and thought, it is therefore untimely. Those who can long cultivate it ascend to the two radiances, becoming Supreme Pure True Men, and after seven hundred years transmit it to one person.

The Grand Diagram of the Jade Morning, the Turbid Regulation, the Knotted Lint, and the Flight to the Sun and Moon by the Most High is complete.
