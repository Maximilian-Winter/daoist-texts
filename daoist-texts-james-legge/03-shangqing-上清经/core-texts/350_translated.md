## The Conduct of Masters and Disciples

### On the Writing of the Scripture and Instructions

Whenever a scripture is obtained, it should be transcribed anew; the earlier copies serve only for veneration and offering. The present transcription is carefully proofread and enriched, with sufficient means and strength. Three separate copies are made: one for long-term preservation, one for ritual offerings, and one for study. The study copy should always accompany the disciple in their place of residence, kept separately upon a stand, personally guarded and not to be entrusted to others. If family members or disciples of the same spirit and sincere heart are present, they may be permitted to use it, but not wholly entrusted. If through negligence or superficial learning and imperfect understanding, prohibitions are violated, calamity will befall both parties. Be clear and cautious, admitting good fortune and preventing misfortune.

When transcribing the scripture, a pure fast is observed; the law requires hand-copying, with the master exchanging copies. If one must attend to menial tasks at the gate and lacks time to write personally, or lacks ink and brush at hand, or is slow and unskilful, the wealthy may employ others with gifts of silk and brocade; the poor may employ hired laborers to assist, but the exquisite trace must be borrowed and cannot be carelessly managed. Errors in characters or images, deformation of diagrams, all carry examination and punishment; how can blessings be thus attained? The scripture contains images, sometimes in separate scrolls, each with attendant officials, true officers in charge of diagrams, jade boys and jade maidens, corresponding to the scripture’s main text. One must not arbitrarily change or avoid difficulties, nor begin the scripture and forsake the images. Erroneous allowance for erasures: no more than three places per sheet of paper; plain sheets also no more than three; exceeding three is an error, to be corrected by fire cleansing. Jointly dyed, cut, and trimmed; the front scroll bears a seal; the pouch and kerchief for storage, the kitchen box must be firm and pure. Nothing overly ornate is permitted.

The world inquires about teachings and transformations, the transformation of the world abandons ornamentation; where ornamentation cannot be abandoned, it is used by rule and measure. Ordinarily men reduce vulgar splendour; splendour supplies the rites; gradually they come to recognise simplicity; after obtaining simplicity comes splendour; naturally it is not destroyed; it is not sought but spontaneously attained; not made for itself but naturally so; none can prevent this. Because simplicity is the basis and the result, do not cling to vulgar splendour. The adornments of halls and terraces have their degrees of richness and frugality, suitable to wealth and poverty; one must not forcibly transpose. The rich forcing themselves to be coarse, the poor forcing splendour; splendour extravagant or coarse and frugal alike, all contradict the Way’s regulations. The Way’s regulations value the mean, correspondence of interior and exterior. Not to be wilfully lost or mistaken; first acknowledge faults and offences; pure fasting and repentance are each according to the Tai Zhen’s code. Long disrepair and changes are exactly as the Tai Zhen’s method requires. Incense, lamps, and prostrations: respect and practice must be sincere; sincerity leads to saintliness, in accord with the Dao and truth.

### Instructions for Opening and Notification

When disciples seek the green register and request the method from the master, those to whom transmission is fitting should first be made to write the scripture and complete the catalogues; then a day is chosen to begin the fast. At the time of the fast, notification is made, roughly as follows.

Though the fasting methods are many, all conform to the Three Primes; the fasting disciplines of the Three Primes encompass all methods. The bestowal and reception of the supreme scripture use the upper prime; the proceedings and notifications vary with circumstances, subject to alteration and simplification, not to be prolix.

At all openings and notifications of fasting, first prepare a written petition; it must not be obscure or negligent, and should be succinct and authentic. The petition should begin by naming the country, the year of the Great Year, the month, the first day, the hour; the province, district, county, township, village; the ranks and names of male and female officials, ritualists, Daoist priests, masters, true persons, sovereigns, and ladies; now residing at a certain mountain hermitage, palace, or residence within the province, district, county, township, village; the names of male and female Daoists and ritual masters who have received the great Dongzhen scripture, catalogued as follows. The Dongzhen section, volume number so and so, written in order; those fully received should be carefully listed from first to last; those partially received should not be fully accepted but issued according to suitability, no need for volume number; simply enumerate the number of chapters, according to the actual one or two articles. Thus the volumes are listed; now in the opening fasting notification for transmission, carefully petitioned.

The petition then gives the province, district, county, township, village, name of the person petitioning; happily enrolled in the green register, yearly serving the mysterious pole, participating in the reception of the precious texts, sincerely fearful and comforted; rashly fearing short life, aspiring to long life; greedy to advance and unmindful to retreat; encountering an auspicious time, entreating to receive the above-mentioned volumes, according to the discipline, transmitting certain methods and certificates; humbly petitioning and reporting, beseeching the master sovereign to graciously permit; sworn with heart to cultivate and practice, not to disappoint the master’s Way; should there be any violation, one’s own fate will be the executioner's blade; daring not to entertain resentment; all according to the clear discipline, carefully petitioned.

On the day and hour of the Great Year, at a certain mountain hermitage, respectfully offered.

### Instructions on the Transmitting of Names

In all transmissions of the treasured scripture, the key is to preserve the master, the master’s master, and the master’s master's master; three visits to the village or dwelling; the ranks and titles of men and women; names, style names, and years; the place of scripture transmission; to be written in yellow plain paper; to be carried and worn at all times; not to be lost or neglected, lest punishment ensue, all according to the Tai Zhen’s discipline. If not constantly carried, it should be attached inside the scripture, separately wrapped in kerchiefs. The masters, instructors, mysterious masters, blue youth lords, and also little lords, preserving these two lords, the rites and petitions are to be conducted according to law.

### Instructions on Certificates of Method

The certificate of method proceeds from the discipline, differing from the scripture. The master’s secret codes, each having their own green register; the discipline and matters change with time, therefore they differ — be careful not to be confused. Follow the master’s practice; if no master is present, open the mystery with ceremony, issuing certificates according to regulations, with no violation permitted. Each scroll is received separately; each discipline is transmitted gradually; scriptures and disciplines correspond. The master and disciple measure and observe, though some things be easy or hard, to remove difficulty by what is easy. One must reflect on the objects and ceremonies, not deviating from their methods, and receive according to the green register. Those who receive suddenly must use the following:

1. Nine taels of superior gold;  
2. One hundred and twenty feet of purple brocade;  
3. Forty feet each of five-coloured patterned silk;  
4. One thousand two hundred feet of white plain silk;  
5. Twenty-four zhang of purple patterned silk;  
6. Colourful motifs of heavenly stems and earthly branches, patterned silk measured by year and length;  
7. Three catties each of five-coloured silk threads;  
8. Nine catties each of five kinds of incense;  
9. Three jade dragons and three jade fish;  
10. Five gold dragons and five gold fish;  
11. One jade wild goose and one jade sheep;  
12. One gold wild goose and one gold sheep;  
13. Three jade tablets;  
14. Nine pairs each of gold and silver rings;  
15. Three hundred sixty pearls, each the size of a parasol tree seed;  
16. Five-coloured threads according to the prescribed weights;  
17. Three hundred sixty sheets of large paper;  
18. Five pairs of brushes;  
19. Five dragon-headed scribal knives;  
20. One purple canopy wrapped in red; two sets of vermilion-dyed headpieces, made of gold and silver;  
21. Five blue canopies wrapped in green; three sets of black-dyed headpieces, made of ivory and copper;  
22. One bright mirror, diameter about one foot, not less than nine inches;  
23. One set of ritual garments, crown, shoes, and handboards; both fine and coarse, new, clean, and fragrant;  
24. One pure receptacle and plate each, made of gold, silver, copper, or tile, various as the occasion requires.

These twenty-four items constitute the certificate of method for receiving the scripture.

Each of these twenty-four items has its proper use; accumulate and prepare them without omission. In remote and poor regions, other items may be used, conforming to the category and filling the place; do not deviate from the plan. If none are immediately available, note the missing items and prepare them after receiving the method.

At the beginning of the fast and the submission of the petition, all should be prepared; consult with the master and reverend; note whether offerings are to be made, and all fixed in writing; set after the scripture catalogue, appended before the petition; read at the opening notification; then again at the time of the scripture transmission, issue official memorials with full mention; do not neglect this.

The master who receives this certificate, following the clear disciplines, will employ it rightly; both parties mutually preserve and perfect the truth. If binding the mysterious alliance, follow this method likewise. After adopting the golden scripture, carry out the dispersal ceremony; if the scripture is incomplete, do not use this instruction. The great man’s highest purpose: to observe carefully and faithfully.

## The Nine Disciplines of the Tai Zhen

The Supreme Sovereign of the Tai Zhen, having established disciplines and completed all methods, scattered them through the many scriptures, before and after, so that the reader may not distinguish them; one should seek the original text. The present text comprises three scrolls, secret to the master, who having obtained it practices it closely, becoming a teacher of heaven and man. Now this great summary marks nine essentials. The nine Celestial True Persons all observe and use these together; their teachings transform all without exception, whether moving or settled, avoiding calamity. If there be men of wisdom and discernment seeking to receive the treasured scriptures, they should be shown these essential laws, the proper manner of bestowal and reception; according to the nine articles, following analogy, nothing is wanting. Unless one embodies the truth, do not rashly add or subtract; all the many scriptures of the Three Caverns are to be measured and observed together. The Supreme Ultimate True Person, the Lord of the Western City, the Immortal Ministers, and the great talents, all guard these treasures carefully; let none leak them.

### The First Discipline

Upon completion of fasting, bestow the precepts; after bestowing the precepts, according to the rites transmit the scripture. The year of scripture transmission is the limit. The limit restrains the mind, the term is to see the Way. The Way is the sovereign of all marvels; to behold marvels, one must see their source. To restrain desire is foremost; to lessen desire next. The depth of this depends on one’s ability; excellence depends on virtue. The measure of virtue is boundless; its great divisions are six: first, forty thousand kalpas; second, forty thousand years; third, four thousand ages; fourth, four hundred lifetimes; fifth, forty years; sixth, the proper four cycles. Upon the completion of the cycles and kalpas, one may transmit to one person, up to nine. This is the honour of seeing the Way, the value of virtue. When the times are urgent and swift, great mercy widely saves; when a worthy person is met, transmission is made without fixed number. But the initial reception must be subtle, with trial within the limit.

If the foundation encounters peril, pressed by calamity and misfortune, wisdom and strength cannot transform it; submission and compliance avoid disaster. The essence obtained is in the heart; do not delay the scroll, lest it harm the mysterious truth. If constrained by power and prestige, compelled and coerced by the original master, only after self-judgment and ability to treat the matter and preserve the original purpose may one request the master to temporarily comply with such intent; if not so, sever by death; be careful not to slight or insult the true master, nor destroy the correct Way. If wisdom and strength cannot manage it, do not rashly say you wish to treat it; without measuring virtue or strength, you will destroy life, and have no success, only increasing guilt. It is good to reflect thrice.

If by chance it be lost without self-awareness, or seized by robbers, with unknown fate and survival, all must long fast and repent; surrender body and life and wealth; depend on the master for many years; exhaust single sincerity; no hatred or laziness; then receive again. On receiving thrice with loss, do not lightly receive again; rather add repentance; until spirit is moved, then receive anew, and surely ascend the true Way. Without response, receiving in vain brings no fruit, only causes future cause; better to receive the superior than receive the inferior. Continuously receiving, the mind and spirit change; though at first no accomplishment, in the end one attains the Way.

### The Second Discipline

After receiving the scripture, diligently seek the master’s teaching; illuminating brightness within, do not display or boast. When the term is ended, then transmit to the worthy; worthy persons are not easily found; do not rashly transmit to unworthy. Both parties face executioner’s blades; extending from ancestors to descendants, evil deeply cuts off the line, filling the ranks of demons. If within the limit there be disaster, or family loss by death, public or private strife, bloodshed, imprisonment, water, fire, robbery, grave illness or injury, though the term be passed, do not transmit to another. Properly repent and make good merit; upon joyful completion of term, transmission may be granted. If the Three Honoured Ones prolong life and ascend, or if innocent but unjustly imprisoned, these cause no harm; transmission may be made according to term.

### The Third Discipline

Faith confirms the heart, illuminating and revealing subtle meaning; it must be made excellent and good, obtained by reason. The proper part is handled, collected and diligently prepared; do not boast or talk excessively; do not generate stinginess. Be careful not to seek evil, nor to exchange, beg, or forcibly demand. To steal or slightly obtain and claim merit only increases guilt and punishment, with no blessing expected. The master receiving should use well; one-third is used by disciples to prepare fasting, to assist in incense, oil, and scriptures; one-third to aid the mountains and secluded suffering; one-third to supply the master’s ritual garments, fine and coarse, offered to the Three Honoured Ones; none to be privately scattered. Distribution is according to law, without stinginess; do not covet to gather, lest calamity follow, damaging the Dao and disgracing the law, inviting ridicule from men and spirits. In urgent cases, use partial relief; according to the time, first open the Three Treasures, then count supplements; no violation, no theft. For those sharing the Spirit Treasure Altar, follow the Twelve Disciplines.

### The Fourth Discipline

After receiving the scripture, preserve propriety without fault; if encountering sudden illness or unintended public or private affairs causing failure, upon recovery immediately repent, awaken shame and fear, exhaust purification of the cinnabar heart. If one roams and indulges in licentiousness, pursuing pleasure and arrogance, violating and replacing, long falls into Fengdu (the netherworld).

### The Fifth Discipline

The method requires long fasting; those unable should choose auspicious meetings, manifest sincerity. The year has six months, the month has ten days of directness; if even these cannot be fully observed, then the first, middle, and last days of the month, the four seasons and eight festivals, the birthday of one’s life sign, according to what can be cultivated; none should be entirely abandoned, for if abandoned there is no merit. To forget the Way and abandon the law invites evil calamity. An unintended breaking of the fast requires repentance; repeated breach without repentance leads to falling into the demon host. Cultivate without slackness; do not break or retreat; preserve the Way and promote the law; reconcile self and things; the saint’s attainment is assured; receive the title of Mysterious Virtue. The months of long fasting are: the first, third, fifth, seventh, ninth, and eleventh months. Each month employs the odd numbers, owing to the fullness of Yang and the establishment of Yin’s work. The days of merit belong to each month’s fixed ten days: the 1st, 8th, 14th, 15th, 18th, 23rd, 24th, 28th, 29th, and 30th.

### The Sixth Discipline

Fasting to read scriptures and precepts, to be familiar and practiced in recitation and study; to expound and declare clearly; daily seeking subtle understanding, which must be practiced. Do not violate what is understood; if violated, repent and do not repeat. In conduct, whether sitting or standing, preserve the text; do not be negligent or forgetful. If secretly deceiving oneself, deceiving others; not observing success or failure; lazy in answering questions; wearied or jealous of excellence; speaking falsely and craftily; or falsely understanding and pretending knowledge; making confused and erroneous sounds, disrupting the text, increasing or spoiling chapters, fabricating erroneous doctrines, producing heresies, violating truth and transgressing right, all bring deep calamity.

### The Seventh Discipline

Proclaim scriptures and precepts; establish virtue and merit; aid others and perfect self; exhort and transform: these are foremost. Hold the correct and open the way; avoid arrogance and falsehood. Expedient benefit requires wisdom and talent. If talent is not deep and thorough, do not act lightly; false expedients lead into false words. But follow the true meaning; guide those of one heart to the master’s door; read scriptures and precepts; prove the subtle principles; arouse good hearts; prepare for fasting and transformation; enable hearing and seeing of blessings and green registers; joyfully accord and succeed; do not scold or incite anger, which increases fault. Use parable to induce advance; do not forcibly drag others; guard moderation; balance firmness and gentleness; one with one, variously soften; firmly lost do not turn; be compassionate but not stingy. Compassion without end; do not foster abandonment; obtain good knowledge; vow together to ascend mystery; prize the master’s love and support; succeed in achieving the highest truth.

### The Eighth Discipline

The master pities disciples, treating all equally with one heart; no partiality. Rewards and punishments must be clear; punishments to stop evil; rewards to encourage good; not a jot to be omitted; the slightest error brings calamity; hidden and manifest are severely examined.

### The Ninth Discipline

Disciples should be reverent and cautious; serve the master without division; move little and speak little; be deep, calm, quiet, and sincere; attend to the master’s countenance; inquire and report mysterious instructions; reflect on building merit; assist and praise the Three Treasures; concentrate and exhaust effort; execute commands promptly; avoid fire and water; do not refuse near or far; when in doubt, immediately ask for examination; if permitted to reform, then repent; if not permitted, continue to follow; if disobedient, lose the Way and fall forever into ruin. Be cautious at the outset; diligently strive to the end.

The above nine disciplines are clearly declared by the Nine Palaces True Persons; the countless great saints who have attained the Way in the ten directions all jointly observe and practice them, to rescue and transform all beings.
