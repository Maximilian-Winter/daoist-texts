Record of the Supreme Master of the Cavern of Truth's Scripture on the Flying Feathers, and the Nine Truths Ascending to the Mystery

The Supreme Great Dao Lord once received the Scripture on the Flying Feathers, the Nine Truths Ascending to the Mystery, a treasured text recording the characters of the Purple Script and the Golden Characters. It expounds the Way of transcending the void, treading the air, and floating in the vision, bestowed upon the Jade Pure Upper Palace, the Celestial Emperor of Emptiness, the Supreme Dao Lord. Thereupon, the Supreme Great Dao Lord, by this essential transmission, passed it on to the Jade Emperor of the Upper Purity; the Jade Emperor in turn passed it to the Supreme Elemental Lord of the Primordial; the Supreme Elemental Lord again passed it to the Heavenly Emperor of the Supreme Subtlety. The Heavenly Emperor of the Supreme Subtlety then practiced the true secrets and passed them on to the Yellow Radiance Lord of the Morning Centre; the Yellow Radiance Lord passed on to the Purple Spirit Lord of the Imperial Beginning; he passed to the Central Yellow Elder Lord; the Yellow Elder Lord passed to the Nine Subtle Supreme True Jade Guardian King, the Golden Pavilion Chief Minister, the Great Fate Commander Morning Master, the Green Youth Supreme Lord, and the Brahman Mei, assigning them to instruct those who are to become Perfected Ones with this text.

Those who possess the Crimson Records of the Supreme Elemental and the inscribed Golden Slips shall certainly behold this text. None outside the proper persons may encounter it. Those who desire to transmit it must be refined, responsive, and filled with heartfelt gratitude before it is entrusted to them. They must pledge with blood and break gold, vowing secrecy in truth. Those who have this scripture shall have the Supreme Elemental Three Primes dispatch to them twenty-four Jade Boys and twenty-four Jade Maidens to attend the book on all sides, to prickle and reprimand any presumptuous offences, and to guard the person possessing the scripture. This is the Way of the Supreme Middle Truth, not a sequence of stages, but the central harmony of the Middle Truth. It is paired with the Three Primes on slips inscribed with the name of the Supreme Elemental, carried with the purple banner’s token; when riding, the brocade carriage of eight splendours moves. Before it follow myriad spirits, behind it follow a thousand truths; nine phoenixes cry in concert; the celestial scales sing a string; the divine dragon opens the way; the Jade Emperor attends the chariot, flying through the great void, roaming and reveling in the cinnabar firmament, taking rank as a Perfected of the Upper Purity, teacher of the Jade Nobles.

Those who possess the Supreme Scripture on Flying Feathers and the Nine Truths Ascending to the Mystery, may listen for three thousand years and six transmissions; when meeting the proper person, it shall be conferred in a single day. If none may be conferred upon, when the term of three thousand years expires, it shall be written in vermilion and white with six passages, sealed in the chamber of the Golden Terrace of Mount Emei; beyond this it shall be no longer transmitted. To confer without permission is to disclose the way of the Perfected; to receive but not accept the precepts is to violate the oath of the Perfected. The conferrer is the master of the scripture; the receiver is the entire lineage. Whoever violates the text, presumptuously discloses the treasured writing, shall be pursued by the seven ancestral grandparents to the Mysterious Capital, enduring the torment of the wind blade; their body shall become a lower ghost, condemned to the Night River. Those who wish to receive the flying practice must scatter gold as a pledge; to know the immortal taboo, a silk kerchief shall be their token. When the Feather Writing is known, Heaven and Earth accord; when the secret script is heard, one transcends and rides auspicious clouds. This is called issuing the inscription on the Feather Cavern Platform.

The Supreme Elemental Three Primes have said: "Immortals first know the way of sheltering beneath the Dipper stars, but they do not yet know the method of the Perfected in storing the Dipper essence. The Nine Dipper Stars are the central canopy of the celestial pivot, the wondrous gem of the mysterious axle, the hinge of the eight dimensions, revolving in nine degrees, encompassing round and square, governing and nurturing harmonious qi, regulating yin and yang, administering the proper without excess. The mysterious radiance of the Dipper stars shines with two lights, forming the nocturnal veil of the celestial pivot; their movement employs the Four Phenomena for streaming and falling; the mysterious brightness is combined and resplendent, their mighty splendour altogether magnificent."

The Supreme Emperor has said: "Immortals only know to chew and digest yin and yang, to inhale and exhale the two qi, but do not know that the Dipper stars are the root mansion of yin and yang, the mysterious framework of the two phenomena. They laboriously delight in their ripples and ends, but do not recognize the origin and beginnings which are easy; they shelter its branches but lose the root. Why not have the heart store the Nine Dippers, and cultivate and cool the two phenomena? Practicing for fourteen years, the Supreme One greets with a jade wheel, transcending the void, treading the air, ascending to Upper Purity, ranked among the Supreme Truths, returning to the infant countenance; the assembly of spirits attend the chariot."

The Green Youth Great Lord has said: "Immortals only know the mighty celestial pivot, the brilliant splendour of myriad stars, seeing the flow of the Nine Ways together, delighting in the circle and movement to govern spirit, sheltering it to seek great magnitude, using it to seek spirit immortality, yet still do not know to return to the nine qi within to illuminate, hiding the bright Dipper in the Mud Pellet; thus the soul condenses and the spirit refines, combining virtue and spiritual smoke, resolving the way to ascend Upper Purity, attaining the Dao body to become a Supreme Truth. Therefore, the Perfected hold the great image to conceal the rosy clouds, and enclose the Dipper essence to hide the body. My former master was therefore left-reined with green clouds and right-reined with crimson dawn; his body ascended the Supreme Elemental, transcending the void, treading the air. He preserved the colour of the Dipper stars as purple; their firm redness, he felt the warmth of the purple qi. He preserved the stars’ size and position in intention and practice. This is the Green Youth Lord’s secret formula."

In former times, Wuchengzi, Guxizi, Guangchengzi, and Qingzhenzi each preserved the qi of the Dipper stars, and entered with their bodies into the lotus seed. Suddenly, they beheld within the lotus a golden pool a thousand li wide, jade mountains stretching ten thousand acres, official terraces and mansions, linked as clouds, vermilion trees bearing fruit, purple blossoms growing in gardens, green chariots of dark yellow, the Three Elements and the Eight Transmissions; a wondrous sight beyond naming. The four gentlemen roamed and enjoyed the experience, then returned. At that time, they did not perceive the centre of the lotus seed. This is called casting the great into the small, transformations without trace; this is the utmost sensitivity of preserving the stars, the measure of breadth and narrowness. One may magnify the tips to be the eight seas; how wondrous indeed is the lotus seed!

On the first, third, and fifth days of the month, at the time of midnight and the central hour of the night, the sole time, entering a chamber and sitting upright, facing north, joining hands, settling the qi and looking steadily, then preserve the nine stars of the Northern Dipper descending, entering the head Mud Pellet. With the dipper handle pointing forward, the Dipper’s leader tips upward. After a time, suddenly one sees in the Dipper leader a great divine person, whose garments and name are as the invocation says. For a long while, the head feels a slight warm heat. This is the coming of the Upper Origin Nine-essence True Qi, hence the warmth as a sign of proper response. Then swallow saliva fifty times, strike the teeth nine times; lifting the left hand’s third finger, pinch the space between the brows, then softly invoke:

"Supreme Purple Radiance, the honour of the Nine Ways, the splendid canopy falling in seven layers, revolving splendour of myriad stars, moving and guiding the high spirit, quiet and harmonizing the shining clouds, yin and yang flowing and pouring, the two qi dividing the centre, revolving aid without excess, bright and clear throughout heaven, commanding the moon to open its teeth, coming to ascend the Mud Pellet, the primordial essence forming response, transforming into a great god named Marvelous Pivot, his character is the spiritual framework, seated upright in the Dipper, roaming my bright hall, phoenix feathers and purple robe, tiger brocade and cinnabar garment, left sash jade pendant, right waist golden ring, hand holding the flowing bell, head covered with morning light, breathing qi to water the essence, the Mud Pellet becomes healthful, soul and spirit condense harmoniously, establishing splendorous pillars and beams, causing me to fly as an immortal, transcending the void, treading air, ascending to Upper Purity, commanding the tiger and the dragon, facing the northern king emperor, the jade forest upper palace, visiting the Supreme Elemental, bowing to the Three Primes."

When the invocation ends, swallow saliva thirty times, strike the teeth nine times, repeat the invocation as before, then rise, face north and bow twice, turn west and bow twice, then cease looking steadily; the matter is finished.

In a quiet chamber above the lungs, one may perform this. The bows need not touch the ground. The Perfected in performing the method value above all to rest where one is at rest, to revere the subtle and simple, no longer twisting or disturbing the usual, nor opposing one’s habitual place. The essence of the Way is not to be vexed; the essential point is matchless.

Later, when practicing the method of the three invocations, all depend on this model. Only the invocations differ, and the preservation of the stars has differences in facing backward. The essential matter is to be in a secret chamber or curved room, not allowing any to see the preserved thoughts. For this reason, at the time of preserving thoughts, Jade Boys and Jade Maidens attend beside and watch. Also, one must not attend funerals or approach corpses, nor suffer defilement or evil, nor err in clothing, coverings, kerchiefs, shoes, or anything else, so as not to be borrowed by things of an alien kind. What is alien kind? It is those of like mind and accord. Those who are not of the same liking do not sit with them; those not of the same alliance do not eat with them; the Daoist and the world are thus distinct. Those who revere the Six Heavens or serve mountain and river demons do not dwell in their chambers, nor partake of their food; do not put on their clothing, nor wear their kerchiefs; for it avoids their corpse defilement’s lower breath, and halts the evil wind’s coming and going. This is called the true Way of the true Way, the subtlety of the subtlety. If one can accomplish this subtlety, then one attains the true; if one can avoid the defilement, then one gains the new. But if one is mixed and confused, foul and fragrant alike, not marking the spirit, not rectifying the qi, licentious and chaste in the same pen, greedy and honest in the same position, abiding by evil wind and not sweeping the heart, treading on dust and soil and not thinking to transcend—if one seeks truth by this, truth is no more. The night light does not grow in the dung well; the low talent is not planted on a shining ridge—thus it is said. The essence responds faintly; the spirit accords subtly; jade splendour announces response; divine light manifests radiance. If not your master, do not speak of it.

The great god in the Dipper is indeed the essence of the nine stars, arising suddenly from response and transformation. When practicing, one must hold in the mind the name; until the last invocation ceases, the final invocation itself has spirit, and the preservation is as at first. If so, the star spirit in the Mud Pellet constantly abides therein. In every matter, conform thus as a model.

Preserving the Dipper stars descending causes the utmost thought to be unaware, suddenly seeming already within my form. At first the preservation may not respond clearly, but with utmost thoughtfulness, as if already in the body, it suffices to bring forth response; long and gradually it enters the marvel.

On the seventh, ninth, and twelfth days of the month, at midnight or the central hour of the night, enter the chamber and sit upright, join hands, settle qi, and look steadily; then preserve the nine stars of the Northern Dipper descending, entering the heart, with the dipper handle firmly pointing upward towards the throat, the Dipper leader facing outward. After a time, suddenly one sees in the leader a great god, whose garments and name are as the invocation states. For a long while, one feels warmth in the heart, as true qi enters. Then swallow saliva fifty times, strike teeth nine times; raise the right hand’s second finger to pinch the heart; then softly invoke:

"Supreme Purple Truth, spirit of the Nine Qi, encompassing myriad degrees, the celestial pivot shines bright, flying rosy clouds flow radiance, illuminating and candleing Jade Pure, mysterious canopy of myriad stars, yin and yang divided and formed, the four harmonies intercross and descend, the seven dimensions follow life, the auspicious month and day arise, coming to shine in the heart court, flowing light and falling shadow, the middle origin fills, the six palaces open gates, the splendid liquid is extinguished and balanced, soul and spirit disciplined and refined, obtaining the essence of truth, sensing to the touch and change, a hundred million transformations established, suddenly seeing the great god seated in the heart chamber, regulating qi and greeting the essence, all joints flow freely, climbing the Dipper, seizing the leader, gazing afar to the hundred directions, called Celestial Degree, its character is Pure Health, green feather and splendid robe, dragon belt and tiger garment, body shining with precious brightness, neck bearing round light, head adorned with flying dawn, adjusting the crown high and low, causing me to fly immortal, transcending the great void, ascending the purple pavilion, facing the Northern Jade Emperor, commanding myriad gods, spirits all attend, the heart grows flowers, auspicious clouds forever flourishing, phoenix cries clear, luan flute resounding."

When the invocation ends, swallow saliva thirty times, strike teeth nine times, repeat the invocation as before, then rise and face south and bow twice; the matter is done. Then open the eyes.

On the fifteenth, nineteenth, and twenty-third days of the month, at midnight or the central hour of the night, enter the chamber and sit upright, join hands, settle qi and look steadily; then preserve the nine stars of the Northern Dipper descending, entering three cun below the navel in the Lower Origin Palace, with the Dipper handle standing upright, pointing to the heart, the leader facing outward. After a long while, suddenly one sees in the leader a great god, whose garments and name are as the invocation states. One should feel warmth and heat in the navel, as true qi arrives. Then swallow saliva sixty times, strike teeth nine times; raise the left hand’s third finger to pinch below the nose at the philtrum; then softly invoke:

"Supreme Purple Emperor, dazzling the central pivot, nine jade tablets shining bright, radiance splendid as the great rosy clouds, myriad spirits uphold and govern, a thousand dawns plant the teeth, seven degrees employ brightness, nine vapours fragrant blossoms, regulating yang on the exterior and following order, wielding yin to harmonize, true brightness opens array, mysterious root encircles all, the auspicious month and day only, viewing and shining within the navel, purple qi issuing to the skies, flying light streaming down, refining my soul and spirit, splendid liquid encircling, suddenly seeing the great god, noble of the upper palace, named Invocation Sprout, its character is Flowing Abundance, seated upright in the navel, riding the nine qi of the Dipper, breathing in and out the cloud liquid, pacifying blood and regulating the stomach, yellow phoenix feather robe, dragon garment and tiger belt, hand opening the sun root, head wearing the green talisman, waist producing flowing fire, shining lightning reflecting the void, causing me to fly immortal, transcending space, treading the void, ascending the jade chamber, bearing and carrying the firmament, commanding myriad gods, Heaven and Earth in harmony."

When the invocation ends, swallow saliva thirty times, strike teeth nine times, repeat the invocation as before; then rise and bow to one’s birth sign; after bowing, open the eyes; the Lower Origin Way is completed. Whenever raising the hand to pinch something, it is the verse of the invocation; when finished, hands return as before.

On the eight festival days at midnight, enter the chamber and sit upright, join hands, settle qi, close eyes and look inward; then preserve oneself rising slowly and ascending the Dipper leader. After a long while, it feels as if my form is already in the Dipper. With utmost thought for it, one will feel the heat within the body; this is the true qi uniting with virtue. Also preserve the names, garments, and colours of the nine essences and three great gods, resembling a newly born infant. The three gods sit opposite me, my heart bows to them; the essence imagines their appearance, the form fades and dims, causing a faint daze. Then swallow saliva eighty times, strike teeth nine times; raise the left hand to soothe the heart; then invoke:

"Supreme Cinnabar Spirit, mysterious light flashing and brilliant, nine jade tablets open the celestial pivot, radiant qi clear and dispersed, purple dawn flickering candles, seven luminaries gathering, two lights perform brightness, yin and yang divided and formed, four degrees use flourishing, cloud liquid returning and pouring, eight festivals open qi, ascending the nine origins, seizing the Dipper and grasping the pivot, attending the three gods, asking why I linger and do not ascend as an immortal; I bow in fear before the ghosts; the emperor then is bright, holding the sun root in his mouth, left breaking through the six heavens, right frowning at Mount Deng, flowing bell shining above, myriad demons shatter and disperse, then harmonizing my spirit, strengthening my three souls, hiding the Dipper’s radiance within, nine essences in the heart, purple haze shining in the caverns, flying light ten thousand zhang, harmonizing soul and mastering spirit, six bowels purified and refined, essence sensing transformation and leaping, jade concubine suddenly appears, sitting in my heart, looking down and gazing up, named Secret Flower, its character is Neighboring Blue, breathing and nourishing vermilion qi, harmonizing all gates, body clad in brocade robe, phoenix light and luan skirt, waist girded with tiger pattern, dragon emblem and jade script, hand holding moonlight, erecting the sun crown, leaping to the great firmament, driving the cloud canopy, writing named Supreme Elemental; I attain flying immortality, transcending the void, riding the jade great origin, ascending the cinnabar chamber, commanding myriad gods, recording the two degrees, returning to infant countenance, the Northern Emperor stirring lightning, the Southern Emperor arranging fire, binding the granary and opening candles, dazzling thunder shaking, west flowing twin wings, sounds singing the scales, four raised leaps, offering me the pure jade, then riding the eight splendours, roaming and feasting among nine vapours."

When the invocation ends, swallow saliva thirty times, strike teeth nine times, repeat the invocation as before; then rise and face northwest and bow twice; then open the eyes, the performance of the eight festival truths is completed.

This Way is the secret subtlety of transcending the void, the wondrous method of the Nine Truths, practicing the three stages of true working, using the nine days of the month; thus it is called the Text of the Nine Truths Ascending to the Mystery. This is a sacred forbidden text of the Supreme One, the essential secret of the true. If the proper person receives it for transmission, the receiver shall fast and purify for one hundred days, or thirty days, or ten days, as befits the occasion. One shall also first announce a fast of one day to cleanse the pure heart. The conferrer fasts in response, as does the receiver. On the day of conferral, first pledge with blood at the altar, shave the head and make an oath, to vow secrecy. Later sages, to prevent the violation of life energy by blood enemy, shave the head and violate the skin, carefully substitute two taels of gold for the blood pledge, and thirty-two feet of soft blue silk for the shaving covenant. The master receiving the oath object may not scatter it for private gain or misuse; all such shall retire to mountain hermitage, solitary and poor in wayfaring. If ascending and soaring the void, or casting it in a mountain chamber or scattering it in cloud rocks, so it is. For thus Heaven’s trust is noble, binding oaths and measurement of the Way; the refined despises love and nurture. If the precepts and agreements are not observed, the seven ancestral grandparents in life and death will bring the test of the Mysterious Capital’s wind blade, and the body becomes a lower ghost. The years of transmission and conferral, and the discipline of conferral, are as the above. One must carefully observe it; the pledged objects are all refined and noble. Prepare the heart with solemnity and order, sincere and single-minded, leaving nothing undone.

To receive the book is the lineage; to confer the book is the scripture master. Hearing the Way, one looks up to the exemplar, seeking life by preserving near the place of birth. If not observing what is offered, neglecting or being presumptuous, the three ancestors shall suffer punishment of the fire official, the body generating karmic illness. Master Xuanyuan judged the Mountain Elder; the Elder only understood the way of refining stone, nothing else wondrous. Is he superior to Jin Yun? Xuanyuan once asked about the way of refining stone, so he became his disciple. The Mountain Elder of Jingshan is Ji Youzi, now dwelling on Mount Weiyu, able to refine stone into water, boil water into jade, powder jade into powder to be taken in medicine. He knows the Way and coexists with Heaven, but cannot fly through the void, only holding the morning glow. Refining stone, though wondrous, is but a minor technique.

The above is the Record of the Supreme Master of the Flying Feathers Scripture on the Nine Truths Ascending to the Mystery. Its Way is complete. The following scroll is the Supreme Nine Truths Middle Scripture. Though the book has upper and lower sequences and formulas, the differing methods and uses are unrelated. Central Yellow Elder Lord divides to transmit Supreme Void Perfected, with the secret words of the Eight Ways in sequence. The Nine Truths Middle Scripture is practiced among men, and also has formulas, but these are secret and not recorded here. Now I shall speak of them:

The first true method is to be practiced five times in the month on the fifth, fifteenth, twenty-fifth, twenty-seventh, and twenty-ninth days, all at dawn.

The second true method is to be practiced six times in the month on the eighth, eleventh, fourteenth, nineteenth, twenty-third, and twenty-seventh days of the eighth month, all at the hour of the dragon.

The third true method is to be practiced six times in the month on the sixth, seventh, seventeenth, eighteenth, twenty-fifth, and twenty-sixth days of the sixth month, all at the hour of the snake.

The fourth true method is to be practiced six times in the month on the second, eighth, fourteenth, eighteenth, nineteenth, and twenty-eighth days of the first month, all at the hour of the horse.

The fifth true method is to be practiced five times in the month on the third, eighth, thirteenth, twentieth, and twenty-sixth days of the third month, all at the hour of the goat.

The sixth true method is to be practiced seven times in the month on the seventh, eleventh, fourteenth, eighteenth, twenty-third, twenty-fifth, and twenty-eighth days of the seventh month, all at the hour of the monkey.

The seventh true method is to be practiced eight times in the month on the second, sixth, ninth, thirteenth, sixteenth, nineteenth, twenty-third, and twenty-seventh days of the eleventh month, all at the hour of the monkey or the hour of the rooster.

The eighth true method is to be practiced seven times in the month on the second, seventh, ninth, fifteenth, eighteenth, nineteenth, and twenty-seventh days of the second month, all at the hour of the dog or the hour of the pig.

The ninth true method is to be practiced six times in the month on the third, ninth, seventeenth, nineteenth, twenty-sixth, and twenty-ninth days of the twelfth month, all at the hour of the rat.

Thus ends the formula of the Nine Truths Middle Scripture. These months and days are the times when the truths unite and return in compliance, when the life qi seizes the essence; it is good for preserving thought and easily bringing forth the mysterious response. If one is high and retired on the remote ridge, marking the cloud rock, severing human affairs within and without, cutting the grain of food to cleanse the intestines, joining hands and rectifying the heart, accordant with the morning containment, one shall perform daily according to the scripture. But now men are busy and cannot daily be idle to perform it. Practiced for fourteen years, one transcends the void and nothingness, able to die and live, emerging from water and entering fire, ascending to Upper Purity, the five viscera producing blossoms, inclining with Heaven.

The ascending mystery feather scripture upper scroll is practiced by three ways, on the ninth day of the month; this is also the time when men have not yet attained great stillness.

If one fasts long and rests long, journeys alone in solitary light, gazing on the clear void, with a heart single and detached from affairs, all are suitable to practice on this day, in order, one after another. The nine practices in one month are applied to the human centre only.

In the eight festival ascending Dipper, when preserving thought, suddenly one sees the Jade Concubine of the Dipper sitting before me; the Jade Concubine sits in purple smoke entering my heart. After a long while, her garments are as invoked on the eight festivals. This woman is the yin spirit of the nine essences, the Jade Pure upper concubine. From the Green Youth secret formula.
