## The Scripture of the Supreme Clarity on the Five Constants, Transforming and Adapting the Myriad Changes of the Dark Obscurity

The Most High Lord of the Great Way said: The Constant Void is the soul and spirit of Heaven and Earth, the potent and clear force of Yin and Yang. The Void is the soul essence of the Nine Heavens; the Constant is the spirit of the Nine Earths. These two airs conjoin to form the great spirit of the Sovereign Emperor, whose splendour aids and supports with brilliant radiance. The Constant Void thus serves as the guiding vision and assistant, governing the movement of heavenly light, observing the myriad directions, recording the heavenly constellations, returning and transforming the Five Constants, summoning, moving, and gathering, hastening the machinery of turning and transmission. When Heaven rests and Earth is peaceful, the Constant Void hides; when Heaven is obstructed and Earth is stirred, the Constant Void shines forth. Auspicious and inauspicious retributions are promptly announced; the transformations of myriad qi, the changes of Yin and Yang, the four seasons' alternations, all proceed from it. Therefore, the two stars are noble and hidden within splendid dawns; all are subtle delights of the Constant Void, difficult to behold repeatedly. To see the two stars grants endless longevity; cultivate the Way, ascend to the splendid hall, and receive the secret words of the Supreme Truth: this is what is meant.

The Prime Minister, Lord Qing Tong, dared to ask: The Way of the Constant Void, its spiritual sound is wondrous and precious—can it be heard?

The Most High Lord of the Great Way said: The Constant Void is the utmost name of Heaven and Earth, yet it is called nameless, mingled into one—it is thus named. But the secret spirit sound of the Nine Heavens is not uttered in the scriptures. Having employed the assistant to serve as ear and eye, relying on the light and brightness to communicate the truth, the Emperor Sovereign receives it to bring order; the scholar controls it to attain immortality; the mindful seek it in the unfathomable, hence again naming it with a name. Having a name yet not transmitted to the multitude, none can fathom it; those who fancy themselves refined cannot obtain its truth. Is this then the foundation for exhorting study? Yet the Nine Heavens issue commands; only the constellations possess secret diagrams and jade characters, carved on tablets. Those born in accord with the truth may obtain the hidden names. You shall oversee all directions, examine myriad immortals, regulate the subtle mysteries, rescue the multitudes; you must not disclose these prohibitions; you shall keep them secret.

Thereupon the Lord ascended the upper heavenly scene to the vermilion chamber of the elixir spirit, purified for three months, tore silk to announce to the spirits, gold sheep and silver geese ceremonially offering to Heaven to receive the truth. The Lord of the Way said: The Nine Heavens have prohibitions, passed down once in myriad kalpas; commands regulate the cycles and returns, the qi returns to the Supreme Clarity, and the Way is to be practiced now. According to the secret method, in seven hundred years there will be one to hear the three transmissions; without such merit, one is sealed back to the Nine Heavens, or entrusted to the chamber of the nine caves on a sacred mountain. Light leakage and negligence bring blame to the seven ancestors; they draw from the dark waves to irrigate the four rivers, bear the mountains to fill the seas. These are retributions of calamity and blessing; not one is mistaken. You must clearly examine these words and act cautiously.

All who desire to walk the Constant Void, flying on the threads to escape bodily transformation and changes in appearance, flying in the Jade Clarity, should proceed seven times in one month; on the eight solar terms and the days of the six Ding, the Way may also be practiced. On the proper day, enter the chamber, burn incense on both sides, spread out the diagram mat, face south and knock the teeth twenty-four times; close the eyes and think upon the five stars shining bright in the five directions. After a long while, they descend into the five viscera of oneself: Venus enters the lung palace; Saturn enters the spleen palace; Mars enters the heart palace; Jupiter enters the liver palace; Mercury enters the kidney palace. The five stars' brightness illuminates the five viscera; the body feels warm; then think upon the five imperial consorts of the stars and the twenty-five points of the Constant Void morning lords, their surnames, names, and garments, each in their respective directions. When all is complete, then softly utter the prayer:

Venus, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth, governing the four origins, mysterious essence flowing and reflecting, illuminating the five gates; within are the five imperial consorts, the spiritual lords; the twenty-five points of the Constant Void celestial sovereigns, changing form and shadow, thousands of unions and ten thousand divisions; descending into the five viscera, forming the jade immortals, refining my seven souls, nurturing my three spirits, lifting my form to ascend, flying into the Dipper Gate, roaming the supreme city; the five stars all together. Today, the mysterious celebration, please come as declared.

## The Way of Cultivating the Nine Morning Five Stars

One should observe the eight solar terms and the days of one's birth sign; at midnight enter the chamber, face north, knock teeth nine times, close eyes and think on the nine stars, shining bright upon the north. Then think upon the five stars, clearly illuminating the five directions, letting their light descend and penetrate oneself; feel oneself within the red light, inner and outer dimly mingled. After a long while, think again on the nine stars and five stars imperial lords, and the imperial consorts and inner concubines of the nine stars; their surnames, names, styles, and garments, each in their constellations, all made distinct. Presently, all the spirits reverently combine and transform into a small child, appearing as a newborn infant, called the Wandering Child, styled the Transforming Spirit King; holding the nine stars and five stars, garbed all over, with a band bearing the sun and moon. The child uses the day, moon, and star light to illuminate and permeate the destined body; the body is within the red light, its surface transparent throughout; thus is the Way of blending myriad transformations. Then swallow breath nine times, and pray:

## The Way of Cultivating the Transformations of the Constant Void

One often uses the eight solar terms and the days of one's birth sign; at midnight enter the chamber, face south, knock teeth twelve times, close eyes and think upon the two divine Constant Void spirits, the twenty-five points of the Constant's hidden names, clothes and garments, each in their respective directions, clearly arrayed in the stellar palaces; their light shining and illuminating the destined body. After a long while, suddenly transform into the two beasts, the phoenix and the black turtle; descending from Heaven, the phoenix rides the red qi light, descending to the head above; the black turtle rides the white qi light, descending beneath the two feet below. The phoenix enters through the mud pellet within the destiny; the black turtle enters through the destiny gate below; the red and white two qi interlace the destined body; feeling my form transformed into the phoenix, standing upon the black turtle, within the red and white two qi. Then knock teeth twenty-five times, swallow breath twenty-five times, and raise the prayer:

Heavenly essence and earthly spirit, called the Constant Void; north entering the five airs; south restraining the three yang; wood produces flowing fire; seven qi break and injure; water irrigates the nine tremors; central origin does not move; earth king nourishes metal; wood qi hides and conceals; golden talisman commands spirit; Great Emperor supports and welcomes; six wu escape the self; hidden shadow in the dark village; Supreme One protects the lungs; gold secures the kidneys and intestines; upper origin assists the heart; refines the immortal liver palace; inside fresh and outside flourishing; jade truth of the four directions; transform myriad scenes; blend two lights; spiritual phoenix and black turtle; divine beasts come to welcome; penetrate the void and enter the subtle; form and soul both fly; thousand transformations and myriad changes; according to will go where desired; bind west, south, north; none do not support and lead; long preserve Heaven and Earth; enjoy blessings without end; obtain with the Bright Emperor; together roam the supreme capital.

Having finished, draw breath twice and stop.

This Way of the Constant Void's hidden dissolution is profound and subtle; the matter reaches its utmost. The so-called transformations of myriad directions, body producing water and fire, distant harmony of Heaven and Earth, fulfilling one's wishes. Those who obtain it rise to the rank of Immortal Duke; their names are recorded at the Northern Star; the Southern Palace records their registers; the five stars descend; myriad spirits attend; blessings and virtue come naturally, without seeking outside help. Cultivate for nine years, establish flight and movement, ascend the heavenly constellations, roam and feast in Jade Clarity. Without this method, one despairs of distant thought, harming spirit by day and night. The Supreme Heaven forbids the book; light leakage and negligence bring punishment upon nine ancestors and elders; the body perishes and is shut in the ghostly realm.

## The Dragon's Flying Nine Paths Lettered Secret

The Most High Lord of the Great Way, on the first day of the second month of the first year of the Supreme Sovereign, in the Boundless Heaven made a covenant; transmitted and passed down the flying feather scripture of the Constant Void's transformations and hidden text; entrusted to the True Lord of the North Pole. At that time, the Emperor of the Nine Heavens, the High Immortal and Great Sage, all appeared at the covenant place; the five emperors bound in bands; myriad spirits attending the pavilion; the sun and moon emitting radiance; the stars arrayed in their essence; the seven origins opening gates; the yellow path ceasing; Heaven and Earth stopped their machinery; the three realms were purified; crimson clouds followed shade; purple clouds soared in four directions; time harmonious and days joyful; eight scenes unfolded. The Lord tore silk beneath the splendid dawn; bestowed the secret formula by golden mouth; uttered words to the Nine Heavens; sang the name from afar; the Emperor expressed joy; the heavenly truths bowed; the demon kings bound forms; preserved and lifted the mystery; ascending to Jade Clarity. The five elders supervised the test; the four assistants aided the truth; attendants on both sides of immortals; divided the covenant and announced to the spirits; according to rules of raising and lowering, facing north, prayed:

Cold does not ascend the stage; commands the nine spirits; regulates the cycles and shifts; sun and moon do not cease. At this time announce the dawn; sincere heart releases form; bearing the sword at the southern official; breathing the elixir of the cold court; gold sheep and silver sores; ceremonially offering to Supreme Clarity; dividing the plain scripture; announcing the covenant to Heaven; requesting as the four poles; once in myriad kalpas transmitted; any who leak my words suffer the seven mysteries' punishment; any who violate my covenant shall perish in body; life and death cease responsibility; forever closing the dark obscurity.

Having finished, silk was torn to measure the scripture; secret words delivered by mouth.

Heavenly truths descended; the five emperors guarded the spirits; nine mornings gave nine hundred golden morning jade children; nine emperors gave seven hundred jade flower jade maidens; the five emperors again gave five hundred jade maidens to each emperor. The five elders commanded the carriage; the four assistants held the banners; purple clouds flew and ploughed twelve precious transports; phoenix song led the front; followed by the heavenly balance; six troops opened the road; nine dragons winged the chariot; to welcome the True Lord. Ascended Jade Clarity North Star Supreme Palace; roamed the seven origins; circled five constellations; traversed heavenly passes; ranked among supreme immortals; governed the wide spirit palace of the North Pole. By the first year of the Kaihuang era, passed to the Eastern Azure Youth Lord; transmitted once in myriad kalpas.

The Way of the Dragon's Flying Lettered Paths derives from the Emperor of the Nine Heavens; bearing the names of Heaven, Earth, Nine Mornings, Five Stars, and the Constant Void. Its precious secret spirit sound is the covenant document; unless one has reversed and inscribed the profound tablets in the previous ninety thousand kalpas, recording the words of Supreme Clarity and destined to be a True Person, one may not glimpse its chapters nor discern its hidden sounds. Those who see this text gain life and death immortality; can cultivate the Way; their spirit light flows and shines; the Emperor Sovereign descends; seven years hidden dissolution; transforming in a hundred directions; entering and leaving the obscure darkness; floating the scene of nine voids; fourteen years ascending the morning in daylight; flying and ascending Jade Clarity. Possessing the grand scripture, daily worship of the divine truth brings longevity; extending life without limit; a thousand calamities do not touch; ten thousand misfortunes do not fall; wars and disasters cease; jewels and grain abound; all obstacles removed; entering and exiting brings the nine emperors' response; face reflecting round light; five emperors guarding and welcoming; wherever they go they govern the reception; able to serve the holy lord in the Supreme Clarity palace. This Way was born together with the Primordial; the nine origins' Void Emperor transmitted to the Supreme Great Way Lord; the Great Way Lord passed it to the Later Sage Golden Palace Emperor Lord; and the Supreme Emperor Lord, the Supreme Subtle Heavenly Emperor Lord, the North Pole True Lord; entrusted to the Bound Azure Youth Lord; transmitted once in myriad kalpas to those who attain the Way.

## The Method of Transmission, Examination, and Oath

Those who receive the transmission must be true in accord with the rules; crimson patterned cloth ninety feet; five-colored patterned cloth fifty feet each; come before a master of the scripture; purify for a hundred days, or seventy days, or seven days. At the mysterious mountain set up an altar in a high secluded place; write the text facing north, divide the covenant formula. With five taels of gold sheep announce the five stars; nine taels of silver crow announce the nine mornings; these two offerings ceremonially present to Heaven to receive the scripture; serve the master and follow the mind. At the hour of the Rat, dew falls upon the altar; crimson patterned cloth holding the sheep placed to the east; white patterned cloth holding the goose placed to the west; swear to the Nine Heavens; divide the covenant in halves; orally transmit secret names. At the time of transmission, follow the prayers above. This is the precious Way, noble and true; sworn not to leak the covenant. If one transmits lightly without covenant, master and disciple alike perish; seven ancestors held responsible; never forgiven in myriad kalpas. The prohibition of Heaven should be carefully examined. At the time of covenant, disciples hold sheep and goose; face north and bow nine times; then bow once to each of the five directions, starting from west, ending south then west; prostrate facing east; place sheep and goose to master’s sides. Master at the center, facing north, knocks teeth nine times, saying:

I, a True Person of such mountain, servant of such Jia, dare at good time auspiciously enter the imperial altar; strip form with sincere heart; purify and drink elixir; array covenant in Heaven. May the Most High look down and regard the humble servant; the Northern Emperor endorses such mountain gentleman Jia; former body bestows blessing; deep celebration in next life; wheel turning and flowing prosperity; Nine Heavens unceasing; previous name profound tablet; destiny receiving today; eyes open to reveal the hidden text; mouth chants the One Emperor; coveting and admiring the immortals; looking up hope for a spiritual pact; now here in such Heaven; granting the feathered scroll of flying the void; reporting to myriad emperors and supreme origin emperor; high immortal and great sage; boundless Way Lords; may they look down and respond; carefully supervise covenant spirits; with the spirit of the Jade Clarity Supreme Palace; attend to such body; report to five emperors, five sacred mountains, myriad spirits; jointly supervise the covenant text; ask as performed; according to the rule transmit.

The left half of the lettered formula should be written on white silk two feet; let half be on one foot, the two halves joined at the central talisman. The recipient writes the name with purple brush; writes the text and talisman with vermilion brush. The master transmits the name; requests the jade children and jade maidens to guard the recipient’s body; then at the central talisman tears it into halves and wears them. Males take the left half; females take the right half; in cinnabar brocade as a pouch, holding the text at the heart. Never violate life and death concealment; thrice violate and the heavenly constellations collapse; five emperors weep; souls and spirits disperse; lost spirits and broken souls; not moving years and losing the body. The prohibition of Nine Heavens is to be carefully observed. If careful, heavenly spirit and mysterious light descend; divine truth arrives; body grows water and fire; myriad transformations follow.

The Primordial Parents of the Nine Heavens, the Supreme Truth Elder, together feasted in the Dragon’s Chariot of the Scene; from the mulberry grove a thousand truths and myriad riders; the flying immortals rode the great chariot; flowing lightning swift union; body free and moving; mouth chanting spiritual chapter; leisurely roaming the mysterious hill’s cave; resting and reclining beside clear waves; wandering the purple void’s coil; resting and riding the boundary of no year.

Thus reciting finished.

The Supreme Subtle Heavenly Emperor Lord rose and commanded the feathered immortal attendant to hold the golden altar; received the scripture facing north standing long; to transmit to the Supreme Truth.

## The Flying Feather Scripture Nine Truths Ascending the Origin Supreme Record

The Most High Lord of the Great Way formerly received the Flying Feather Scripture Nine Truths Ascending the Profound Supreme Record; precious words in purple and green-gold characters; transcending the void, treading the void, floating the scene; at Jade Clarity Supreme Palace; the Mysterious High Supreme Lord. Thereupon the Most High Lord of the Great Way passed its essentials to the Supreme Clarity Jade Emperor Lord; the Supreme Clarity Jade Emperor Lord passed to the Upper Origin Supreme Element Lord; the Upper Origin Supreme Element Lord again passed to the Supreme Subtle Heavenly Emperor Lord; the Supreme Subtle Heavenly Emperor Lord passed to the Morning Center Yellow Scene Lord; the Morning Center Yellow Scene Lord passed to the Imperial Beginning Purple Spirit Lord; the Imperial Beginning Purple Spirit Lord passed to the Central Yellow Old Lord; the Central Yellow Old Lord passed to the Nine Subtle Supreme Truth Jade Protector King Golden Palace Upper Prime Minister High Morning Master Qing Tong Lord Fan Mei; to use this text to instruct those to become True Persons. All having the Upper Element Crimson Record and Golden Palace inscribed names should obtain this text. Those not of such persons may not meet or receive it. Those desiring to transmit it must be spiritually responsive and clear, then it may be entrusted. Swearing a covenant severing gold, vowing not to disclose it.

Those having this scripture, the Upper Element Three Origins Lords send twenty-four jade children and twenty-four jade maidens to attend the scripture on both sides; correcting and piercing faults of leakage and negligence; guarding and protecting the bearer’s body. This is the true Way, not among the ranks of immortals.

## Words of the Upper Element Three Origins Lord

Immortals first know the Way of sheltering under the Dipper Star; but do not know the method of storing the True Person in the Dipper Star. The Nine Dipper is the central canopy of the Heavenly Pivot; the essence jewel of the mysterious axis; the mechanism and hinge of the eightfold support; governing the nine degrees; turning and shading round and square; operating and controlling harmonious qi; managing and adjusting Yin and Yang; supervising the appropriate without exception. The Dipper Star shines bright to form the night shade; the rotating arm serves as movement; the four images as flowing fall; mysterious brightness shines brilliantly; power and radiance splendid and great.

The Supreme Emperor Lord spoke: Immortals only know to chew Yin and Yang; breathe in and out the two airs; but do not know the Dipper Star as root and storehouse of Yin and Yang; the mysterious thread of the two images. They laboriously delight in its waves and ends; but do not recognize its beginning; so easily overlook it; shelter its branches; lose the root. Why not hide the Nine Dipper; cultivate the utmost image? Practice fourteen years; the Most High welcomes on the jade chariot; transcend the void; tread the void; ascend Supreme Clarity; ranked among the Supreme Truths; reverse to infant visage; myriad spirits attend the pavilion.

Qing Tong Lord said: Immortals only know the great power of the rotating arm; shining and fearing myriad stars; seeing the nine paths’ flowing splendour; delighting in the round motion to control spirits; shelter it to seek great measure; using it to seek immortals; yet still do not know to turn the nine lights inward to illuminate; hiding the brightness of the Dipper in the mud pellet. Thus the soul condenses and spirit refines; uniting virtue and union; solving the Way and ascending Supreme Clarity; obtaining the Way body and becoming Supreme Truth. Therefore the True Persons embrace
