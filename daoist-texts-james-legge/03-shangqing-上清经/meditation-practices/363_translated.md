## The Precious Jade Scripture and Secret Formula of the Supreme Clarity Purple Imperial Lord, the Southern Pole Primordial Lord

The Supreme Imperial Lord of the Great Microcosm, the Great One, forms the body; the Purple Origin Inner Spirits, and the twenty-four Perfected Ones, arise from the mixed breath. They govern the superior essence of Immortals, dispersing and resolving fetal knots, releasing obstructions, and opening the origin.

The twenty-four knots must be commanded by the twenty-four spirits, in order to be removed and dissolved. Those who can cultivate and preserve the names thereby govern and pacify the whole body, preserving the primal essence. On the day of dissolving the knots, one must first offer supplication, only then can the gates be opened. The Purple Spirit is also the mysterious chief of the bound breath, the true spirit of the completed body, directing and guiding clouds and mists, bringing forth true smoke and each able to summon jade chariots and dragon-riders, in myriads arranged in ranks, all united as one body, ascending in the daylight at dawn. These are the twenty-four Perfected Spirits of the Supreme Perfected One, guarding the origin, the Imperial Lord of the Great Origin, ascending the jade clarity and riding the whirlwind.

One should always maintain an undisturbed body and a tranquil mind, rectifying breath and harmonizing form, closing the eyes and looking inward, forgetting the body and contemplating the spirit; burn incense, wash and rinse; preserve the spirit and guard the truth, imitating the threefold entry into a hazy, radiant mystery. Practiced for eighteen years, the Supreme One commands the Supreme Imperial Lord, the Great One, and the five spirits to transform and produce the Mixed Spirit Dao Lord, inviting the twenty-four Perfected Ones, a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, treading the wind and moving through clouds, breath flowing with rosy clouds, creating heaven in broad daylight.

The method of preserving the spirit forbids mingling with unrelated things; keep to a deep chamber, avoid affairs, dwell in essence and gather spirit. The heart preserves the eyes’ vision; subtle and mysterious guards the void; calm the soul and settle the form, then myriad harms do not injure, a hundred demons flee and hide, a thousand monsters do not act; disasters are dispelled and calamities scattered; wonderful beyond measure. First knock the teeth with the twenty-four passes, and then begin to preserve thought.

The Sacred Scripture of the Supreme Treasure and Divine Spirit says: The method of knocking the teeth is as follows: Left to left is called Breaking and Controlling the Heavenly Bell; right to right is called Shaking the Heavenly Mallet and Heavenly Chime; middle, up and down opposing knocks is called the Stern Sounding Heavenly Drum. If at last one encounters misfortune and ill-omen, one should break the Heavenly Bell thirty times. If crossing a mountain, warding off evil with mighty divine blessing, one should strike the Heavenly Mallet and Heavenly Chime. To preserve thought and meditate on the Way, summoning true spirits, one should sound the Heavenly Drum. Though knocking the teeth is but one act, it really has left and right, up and down. Thus the ill-omen fears the sound of the Heavenly Bell; the mountain spirits are controlled by the hollow sound of the Heavenly Chime; summoning spirits is made solemn by the vibration of the Heavenly Drum. The mysterious commerce has its measure; the subtle inner response cannot be sought with a pointed instrument, nor can it be anciently accidental. Thousands and tens of thousands of sections all follow thus; the method of knocking the teeth is expounded, the sounds of bell and drum distinguished. Therefore the numbers of the Way must not be disordered; the arts and methods must not be confused. Disorder brings defeat in obscurity; confusion brings quarrels and destruction; this is not from the ineffable void’s incoherence, but from practising the ineffable void without order. The Way fails, events do not prove true, all because seekers of truth do not obtain the method, treading the edge of the track and making many faults.

Breaking the Heavenly Bell thirty times means no other supplications; simply perform this to remove misfortune. If there is a prescribed practice, then follow the number of knocks in this text; it is not necessary to break thirty times.

The brain spirit is named Awakened Origin Child, styled Dao Du. Its form is one inch and one fen long, colour pure white.

On the right, preserve the names of the eight scenic spirit children of the upper part of the body, first preserving them, with their infant forms imitated on the body, each placed in its proper position. When done, knock the teeth eight times, swallow saliva eight times, and slightly supplicate thus:

The Eight Spirits of the Upper Scene, united and entering the body, the Imperial Lord and Mysterious Mother, the five spirits each present in order, forms raised and transformed, flowing and changing to the truth, a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, all ascending to the Imperial Dawn; pure origin without distinguished ones, guiding and nurturing the Supreme Guests, eight spirits winging the body, jade splendour grasping smoke, faintly radiant for ten rounds, directly arriving at the Sun Gate.

At the beginning of preserving thought, first call aloud three spirit names; after the supplication, call aloud three spirit names again, letting the voice just leave the mouth, the three parts in unison.

The right kidney spirit is named Elephant That None, styled Dao Yu. Its form is three inches long, colour white or black.

On the right, preserve the names of the eight scenic spirit children of the middle part of the body, then preserve them, with their infant forms imitated on the body, each placed in its proper place. When done, knock the teeth eight times, swallow saliva eight times, and slightly supplicate thus:

The Eight Spirits of the Middle Scene, four transformations and nine flights, refining the soul and preserving the body, bright scene and harmonious radiance, the Imperial Lord loosens the knots, fetal bonds all returned, communicating upward with the Mysterious Mother, dispersing spirit and issuing power, obtaining union with the eight spirits, riding chariots flying in harmony, a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders ascending the Great Microcosm.

The stomach spirit is named Together Arriving Nurture, styled Dao Zhan. Its form is seven inches long, colour yellow.

The lower intestinal spirit is named Signalling Teng Health, styled Dao Hui. Its form is two inches and four fen long, yellow-red colour.

The right yin and right yang spirits are named Bud Manifest Bright, styled Dao Sheng. Its form is two inches and three fen long, colours blue, yellow, white; in males preserved as right yang, in females as right yin.

On the right, preserve the names of the eight scenic spirit children of the lower part of the body, afterwards preserve them, with their infant forms imitated on the body, each placed in its proper place. When finished, knock the teeth eight times, swallow saliva eight times, and slightly supplicate thus:

The Eight Spirits of the Lower Scene, dispersing form and transforming spirit, purple smoke thickly arising, containing origin and guarding essence, the Great One Primordial Father, the Imperial Lord standing upright, seven splendours illuminating the records, controlling life and recording spirit, soul and spirit at peace, five splendours nurturing brightness, a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, united with me, first creating the Great Essence, next bowing to Supreme Clarity.

The Dao One Inner Spirit is named Escaping No-Horse, styled Dao Ji Sheng. Its form is two inches and two fen long, purple in colour. In males preserved as Dao One Inner Spirit; in females preserved as True Origin Central Spirit.

On the right, the utmost root subtle spirit of the body guards the upper central spirit. Afterwards preserve it, as in the form of an infant, seated in its proper place. When done, knock the teeth thirty times, swallow saliva twenty-four times, and slightly supplicate thus:

Mysterious Supreme Inner Truth, nurturing the form and attending the dawn, governing all bonds and gathering threads, nine degrees and eight rotations, outer stars arranged, inner chambers ninety-fold, the Imperial Lord united and flourishing, nine ways and seven gulps, issuing fluids within essence, harmonizing and irrigating the myriad spirits, the five viscera producing splendour, reversing age and restoring youthful countenance, a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders ascending with me to heaven, attending the Supreme Terrace, deeply saluting the Jade Dawn.

On the right, the treasure name of the body’s inner character, the spirit of transformation and birth. Without knowledge of this name, the Immortal Way cannot be accomplished. If on the day of unknotting this is not first supplicated, the knots will not be dissolved. If the knots are not dissolved, the three souls lose their place; the upper origin is lost within; the five elders lose their sight; the Imperial Lord is separated and distant. Males preserve it as the male child spirit; females preserve it as the female child spirit, both having the same name.

Preserving the twenty-four spirits, always at midnight, leave the pillow and lie flat, grasp firmly and relax the body, regulate breath subtly; think of the whole body spirit, rest the mind on the Imperial Lord, causing the imitation to dwell in place, close the eyes and look inward. If any are incomplete, then burn incense, sit upright with closed eyes, firmly grasp both knees; essence preserved, all supplications performed according to law. At dawn and noon preserve the spirits likewise, proceeding from sitting upright, and do not allow any to see them; all are inwardly gazing and guarding with eyes closed.

On the first day of the month at midnight, after preserving the spirits, also preserve the white vapour in the middle of the two eyes, the size of a chick’s egg, before the face; presently it changes into two bright mirrors, each nine inches, reflecting front and back the whole body with the twenty-four spirits, making clear and distinct the discerning mirror. After a long time, the heart supplicates thus:

Great Bright Precious Mirror, dividing form and scattering transformation, mirroring the original spirit, restraining myriad demons, flying and ascending to Supreme Clarity, spreading cloud kerchiefs and gauze, commanding myriad spirits, sealing mountains and summoning rivers.

Finished. Practice this once every five days. This is what is called covering and embracing the inner essence, inspecting and gathering the five spirits. If constantly practiced, disasters will not arise, and one’s rank will ascend to high Immortality.

## The Method of the Whisk Bearer, to Thoroughly See the Five Spirits of the Imperial Lord, and the Method of the Twenty-Four Spirits

Always on the ten-day period of the Jiazi, on the day Gengwu, at noon, take one sheng of clear water, with one zhu of true cinnabar, cast into the water and stir; walk left in three sevens, supplicating thus:

Mysterious Flowing Vermilion Ford, producing light of eight brightnesses, body and spirits arrayed in ranks, all come to see the form, thoroughly viewing ten thousand li, penetrating the nine spirits, the Imperial Lord illuminating the child, enabling me to ascend the essence.

After the supplication, face east and wash the eyes with water twenty-seven times. Those who constantly practice this thoroughly see myriad spirits. The supplication should be whispered, facing the month’s position.

The Supreme Perfected One summons the five celestial bodies in the secret chamber, registers the flying souls in the six harmonies hidden preservation secret Way; the Southern Pole Primordial Lord’s Precious Jade Scripture and Secret Formula.

At midnight, calm and pure, sitting or lying at will, settle the body and clear the mind, broaden breath and regulate spirit; look inward and preserve the Western White Star on the face above the two eyebrows, named Jade Pendant Purple Gate. One inch above the eyebrow, straight in one inch, is the Jade Pendant Purple Gate. The Yang day preserves the star on the left eyebrow; the Yin day preserves the star on the right eyebrow. Next preserve the Northern Celestial Star in the imperial village Mysterious Palace. The imperial village Mysterious Palace lies from the nose straight upward to the hairline five fen, straight in one inch. Next preserve the Eastern Wood Star in the secret gate Vermilion Terrace. The secret gate Vermilion Terrace lies one inch behind the eye, straight in one inch; Yang day preserves the star behind the left eye; Yin day preserves the star behind the right eye. Next preserve the Southern Mars Star in the jade gate splendid chamber. The jade gate splendid chamber is five fen straight in from the inner corners of both eyes; Yang day preserves the star at the left eye corner; Yin day preserves the star at the right eye corner. Next preserve the Central Guard Star in the golden treasury yellow chamber long valley. The golden treasury yellow chamber long valley lies in the centre of the philtrum, straight in two fen, the star like a suspended bead above. When preserving thought is complete, imitate and cause the stars to take their places, one should feel the five stars sending forth rays, emitting five-coloured smoke, penetrating the whole body, internally and externally, as if within the body black star essences enter. Then knock the teeth five times, swallow saliva twenty-five times, and slightly supplicate thus:

Exalted Purple Gate, within seeing the Imperial Lord, Great One Mixed Unity, Purple Chamber’s Gate, within the gate brightness shining, this is the Three Origins; the Three Origins bind essence, thereby having five spirits, the precious radiance spreading light, emitting rays guarding the dawn, essence transforming and accumulating life, changing into an old man, wearing a white crown first, green cloak and scarlet skirt, right side bearing flowing bells, left side wearing tiger armor, hand grasping heavenly steel, scattering sharp flying stars, feet treading splendid canopy, spitting rays refining the body, three scenes preserved and guarded, enabling me to obtain truth, nurture soul and govern spirit, riding the whirlwind flying Immortal.

Those who can constantly practice this Way fifteen years will be met by the Southern Pole Old Man Danling Supreme Perfected, welcomed with a carriage of green clouds; the Western Extreme Old Man White Cloud Zi Qi, welcomed with a carriage of yellow whirlwind; the Northern Extreme Old Man Mysterious Supreme Immortal Sovereign, welcomed with a dragon of mysterious radiance; the Eastern Extreme Old Man Supporting Yang Young Master, welcomed with a green carriage of attendants; the Central Origin Old Man Central Supreme Mysterious Son, welcomed with a bent dawn canopy. The five elders united all ascend Purple Void. Practice this without interruption, preserve it with care and precision. Avoid treading on filth, forbid mixed places, constantly burn incense, often bathe. Those who violate these will decline; those who follow will fly as Immortals. After preserving the stars, if one wishes to make a vow, after the intent and supplication, continue as follows.

Preserve the five stars’ common dwelling, straight in two inches below the nape, also shielding one inch square; the stars like pellets shining upon the secret chamber’s face and body. On the new moon, full moon, seventh, ninth, thirteenth, seventeenth, twentieth, and twenty-fifth days of the month, at cock-crow hour, preserve the symbols of sun and moon in the soul chamber of the six harmonies. The soul chamber of the six harmonies lies above the outer corners of both eyes, slightly elevated in the high void; pressing it and knocking the teeth, one hears below four gatherings, moving beneath, straight in one inch square of nine fen, named the soul chamber six harmonies mansion. The sun at left, moon at right, preserving to cause brightness and penetrating form, causing the imitation to dwell in place, opening eyes and concentrating, not allowing loss or escape. When finished, knock teeth seven times, and slightly supplicate thus:

Great Bright Spirit Dawn, nine degrees deep blue, summoning rosy clouds and hiding radiance, pouring and refining the five forms, palace chariots of six harmonies, seven spirits in harmony, enabling me to fly as Immortal, soul ascending Supreme Clarity.

Finished; after fifteen years’ practice, the Jade Emperor sends three white carriages to welcome. One should cultivate the ability to crow like a cock, enabling the office of dawn to have regular timing. If concealed and done secretly, the union of sun and moon’s radiance will be lost. The Southern Pole Master receives this technique from the Supreme High Perfected, named Twin Scenes Winged Form Hidden Preserving Secret Way; only those of true immortal bones may hear this scripture’s title.

Facing east to Supreme Clarity Mysterious Origin Three Heavens Infinite Great Dao, all Lords and Venerable Masters; facing west to Celestial Masters, Female Masters, Successor Masters, and System Masters, the three Master Lords; facing north to the Supreme Old Lord, Supreme Mysterious Upper One Lord, Supreme Venerable Master; facing south to the Lord of Dao and Virtue, Virtue Venerable Master, Ten Thousand Prosperities Lord, Ten Thousand Blessings Venerable Master, Ten Thousand Life Lord, Ten Thousand Life Venerable Master.
