The Scripture of the Supreme Emperor of the Great Microcosm and His Twenty-four Spirits Returning to the Origin

The Supreme Emperor of the Great Microcosm is the Great One who forms shapes, the Inner Spirit of the Purple Origin. The twenty-four Perfected Ones arise from the mingled breath and transformation, presiding over the essence of immortality, dispersing and resolving cellular knots, releasing impediments at the vital gate.

By the command of these twenty-four spirits one obtains deliverance and liberation. Those who can cultivate and preserve the name thus govern and guard the body, preserving the primal essence. To untie the knots and knots of the body’s bindings, one must first invoke them in prayer, then the gates are opened. These spirits are indeed the mysterious ancestors of knotting qi, the true spirits of the formed body, directing the clouds and vapour, bearing the living smoke and mist, able to summon jade chariots and dragon steeds, thousands of ranks moving in order, united as one body, ascending in broad daylight to heaven. This is the way of the Supreme Perfected One, the twenty-four spirits preserving the mysterious origin, the Emperor of the Great Microcosm, riding the high winds of the Upper Clarity.

One must always repose the body and quiet the heart, maintain upright qi and a level bearing, close the eyes and look inward, forget the body and consider the spirit, burn incense and cleanse oneself, preserve the spirit and guard the truth, imitating the triadic entry into the gentle radiance and mysterious essence. Practising thus for eighteen years, the Supreme Being commands the Supreme Emperor of the Great Microcosm, the Great One and Five Spirits, to transform and bring forth the mixed and spiritual Daoist Lords, following the twenty-four Perfected Ones, with a thousand chariots and ten thousand steeds, speeding on the wind and gathering clouds, breathing and rising in flow, in broad daylight making heaven.

The way of preserving the spirit is to avoid mingling with the unfit, to keep to a deep chamber and avoid affairs, to handle the essence with care and creep through the void, the heart maintaining visualisation, guarding the subtle and profound centre, quieting the soul and resting the form; thus all harm cannot injure, a hundred ghosts flee and hide, a thousand demons do not act, disasters are dispelled and misfortunes scattered, blessings and felicities cannot be numbered. First knock the teeth twenty-four times completely, then preserve the thought:

The brain-spirit, bright and aware, named Yuanzi, styled Daodu, form length one inch and one fen, colour pure white. The hair-spirit named Xuan Wenhua, styled Daoheng, form length two inches and two fen, colour mysterious dark. The skin-spirit named Tong Zhongzhong, styled Daolian, form length one inch and five fen, colour yellow. The eye-spirit named Xu Jiansheng, styled Daotong, form length three inches and six fen, wearing five colours. The nape marrow-spirit named Ling Mo Gai, styled Daozhou, form length five inches, colour white, dressed in plain robes. The back-spirit named Yili Fu, styled Daozhu, form length three inches and a half, white jade plain robes. The nose-spirit named Chong Longyu, styled Daowei, form length two inches and five fen, dressed in blue-white yellow. The tongue-spirit named Shi Liangshi, styled Daoqi, form length seven inches, bright red in colour.

These are the eight spirits of the upper part of the body, the names of the spirit children. First preserve them, all in the form of infants, imitating the triadic form on the body, each settled in its place. When complete, knock the teeth eight times completely, swallow saliva eight times over, and softly pray:

The eight spirits of the upper aspect, united and entered into the body, the Emperor’s mysterious mother, the five spirits each set forth, lifting their forms to transform and flow, changing to reach the true, a thousand chariots and ten thousand steeds all ascend to the imperial palace, pure origin without brilliance, the Dao nourishing the great guest, eight spirits winging the body, jade flowers holding smoke, faintly circling ten times, directly approaching the gate of the sun.

At the beginning of preserving the thought, first call out the names of the three spirits thrice; after prayer, again call out the names thrice, letting the voice then issue forth, the three parts all together. At dawn, noon, and midnight, constantly preserve the twenty-four spirits in order, reciting them, praying and calling as above.

The Scripture of the Highest Treasure Spirit and Brightness states: The method of knocking teeth is to knock left to left, called the knocking of the heavenly bell. To knock right to right is called the beating of the heavenly plate. To knock centre above and below opposite is called the sounding of the heavenly drum. If one suddenly meets with evil and inauspiciousness, one should knock the heavenly bell thirty times. If crossing a mountain, to ward off evil and invoke mighty spirits, one should beat the heavenly chime. If preserving thought and meditating on the Dao to summon the true and call the spirits, one should sound the heavenly drum. Though knocking the teeth is one action, it in truth has left and right, above and below. Therefore evil fears the sound of the heavenly bell, mountain spirits fear the movement of the heavenly chime, and summoning spirits inspires awe at the trembling of the heavenly drum. The mysterious azure has its order, subtle inner responses, not to be sought by one stroke, nor by chance combined. Thousands of sections and myriad affairs must all be so; the way of knocking teeth is thus unfolded, the sounds of bell and drum distinguished. Therefore the numbers of the Dao must not be disordered, the laws of protection may not be confused; disorder brings ruin in darkness, confusion brings disaster in clamour. It is not that the obscure is without coherence; when the obscure is carried out without order, the Dao cannot be accomplished, affairs cannot be verified; the reason is that the path of seeking truth is not obtained. To tread the traces of stumbling and to be named a fault in the vulgar world. Knock the heavenly bell thirty times alone, meaning no other prayer, going alone thus to remove misfortune. If there is a case to be handled, follow the prescribed number of knocking teeth, it is not necessary always to knock thirty times.

The throat-spirit named Bailiu Fang, styled Daotong, form length eight inches and eight fen, wearing nine colours. The lung-spirit named Su Lingsheng, styled Daoping, form length eight inches and one fen, pure white. The heart-spirit named Huanyang Chang, styled Daoming, form length nine inches, colour red. The liver-spirit named Kai Jun Tong, styled Daoqing, form length six inches, colour blue-yellow. The gall-spirit named Longde Ju, styled Daofang, form length two inches and six fen, colour blue-yellow-green. The left kidney-spirit named Chun Yuan Zhen, styled Daoqing, form length three inches and seven fen, changing often white, red, blue, five colours unsteady. The right kidney-spirit named Xiang Di Wu, styled Daosheng, form length three inches and five fen, colour white or black. The spleen-spirit named Bao Yuan Quan, styled Daoqian, form length seven inches and three fen, colour pure yellow.

These are the eight spirits of the middle part of the body, the names of the spirit children. Next preserve them, all in the form of infants, imitating the triadic form on the body, each settled in its place. When complete, knock the teeth eight times fully, swallow saliva eight times, and make the incantation:

The eight spirits of the middle aspect, four transformations and nine flights, refining the soul and rectifying the body, bright aspect like the sun’s radiance, the Emperor’s release of knots, embryo training with four returns, the upper communicating with the mysterious mother, dispersing spiritual steps with awe, obtaining union with the eight spirits, united chariots with assembled gates, a thousand chariots and ten thousand steeds ascend to the Great Microcosm.

The stomach-spirit named Tong Lai Yu, styled Daozhan, form length seven inches, colour yellow. The middle bowel-spirit named Zhao Teng Kang, styled Daohuan, form length two inches and four fen, colour yellow-red. The great and small bowel spirit named Peng Song Liu, styled Daochu, form length two inches and one fen, colour red-yellow. The trunk-spirit named Shou Hou Bo, styled Daoxu, form length nine inches and one fen, wearing nine colours. The diaphragm-spirit named Guang Ying Zhai, styled Daozhong, form length five inches, colour white. The two flanks-spirit named Bi Xia Ma, styled Daocheng, form length four inches and one fen, red-white in colour. The left yin and left yang spirits named Fu Liu Qi, styled Dao Gui, form length two inches and three fen, blue-yellow-white colours; in men preserve as left yang, in women as left yin. The right yin and right yang spirits named Bao Biao Ming, styled Daosheng, form length two inches and three fen, blue-yellow-white colours; in men preserve as right yang, in women as right yin.

These are the eight spirits of the lower part of the body, the names of the spirit children. Afterwards preserve them, all in the form of infants, imitating the triadic form on the body, each settled in its place. When complete, knock the teeth eight times fully, swallow saliva eight times, and softly pray:

The eight spirits of the lower aspect, dispersing the form with nine spirits, thick purple smoke arises, containing the origin and guarding the essence, Great One, primordial father, the Emperor stands forth in birth, seven clear ones exempt from registry, overseeing fate and recording life, soul and spirit at rest, five flowers nurturing brightness, a thousand chariots and ten thousand steeds united with me, first bringing forth the Great Element, bowing north to the Upper Clarity.

The Dao One Inner Spirit named Dai Wuma, styled Dao Jisheng, form length one inch and two fen, purple in colour; in men preserved as Dao One Inner Spirit, in women preserved as True Origin Middle Spirit.

This is the utmost root and hidden spirit, guarding the upper centre. Next preserve it, like an infant in form, seated in its place. When complete, knock the teeth twenty-four times fully, swallow saliva twenty-four times, and softly chant:

Mysterious highest inner truth, nurturing the form and attending the dawn, gathering and fastening the net, nine degrees and eight revolutions, stars of the Big Dipper shining within, palaces and halls nine arranged, the Emperor united in flourishing, nine paths and seven throats, liquid issuing within essence, harmonising and irrigating all spirits, five viscera producing splendour, reversing age to childlike countenance, a thousand chariots and ten thousand steeds, with me ascending to heaven, presenting homage to the great steps, bowing to the jade morning.

This is the precious name of the body, the spirit of transformation and birth. Not knowing this name, the way of immortality cannot be accomplished. If on the day of untying knots this is not first invoked, the knots will not be undone. If the knots are not undone, the three souls lose their place, the upper origin is lost within, the five elders lose their sight, the Emperor becomes estranged and absent. In men preserved as the spirit of the boy, in women preserved as the spirit of the girl, both with the same name.

Preserving the twenty-four spirits, one should at midnight rise from the pillow and lie flat, grasp firmly and loosen the body, adjust the breath gently, preserve the thought of the body’s spirits, rest the mind on the Emperor, commanding the triadic forms to take their place, close the eyes and look inward. If anything is incomplete, then burn incense, sit upright with eyes closed, grasp firmly on the knees, preserve the essence and multitude of spirits, pray and act according to the method. At dawn and noon, preserving the spirits, begin from sitting upright and proceed; do not allow any to see. All inwardly look and close the eyes to preserve.

On the first day of the moon at midnight, having preserved the spirits, again preserve the white qi in the eyes, as large as a chicken’s egg, before the face, shortly changing into two bright mirrors, each nine inches in diameter, reflecting my whole body and the above twenty-four spirits, so that the inspection is clear and distinct. After a while, then the mind prays:

Great bright precious mirror, dispersing forms and scattering flowers, illumining the original spirit, controlling and dispelling myriad demons, flying forth to Upper Clarity, unveiling the cloud veil, commanding a thousand spirits, sealing mountains and summoning rivers.

Thus ends. Perform every five days, so called to cover and check the inner essence, to examine the five spirits. Constantly able to perform this, disasters do not arise, and one’s place is raised among the high immortals.

The way of the whirling children enables penetration to see the Emperor’s five spirits’ method: always on the cycle of sixty days, on the gengwu day, at noon, take a measure of clear water, one sheng, and throw in one zhu of true cinnabar, stirring it three or five times counterclockwise, praying:

Mysterious flowing vermilion essence, producing light entering brightness, the body’s spirits arrayed in order, all coming to see and act, thoroughly viewing ten thousand li, reaching the nine spirits within, the Emperor reflects the children, enabling me to ascend to Upper Clarity.

After prayer, bind the hair and wash the eyes twenty-seven times. Those who constantly perform this can thoroughly see all spirits. The prayer should be softly spoken, washing the eyes with water facing the moon, not always eastwards.

The Scripture of the Supreme Emperor of the Great Microcosm and His Twenty-four Spirits Returning to the Origin is concluded.
