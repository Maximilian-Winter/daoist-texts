The Supreme Clarity Divine Treasure Secret Writing of the Inner Chamber, Upper Scripture

This scripture is also named the Annals of the Daoist Lord Qingtong, and the Grand Protector Jade Scripture. It is cultivated by the immortals, being the true teaching of Supreme Clarity. In former days, Lord Wei Junhua transmitted it to Xu Junyuanyou, who dwelt at the Western City Ramparts Tower, pledging the ten splendid elixirs of the Purple Aspect, cutting the brocade of the Star Clouds and the Flying Phoenix of the Treasure Firmament, to communicate with Supreme Clarity. For a hundred years it passed among the Perfected, not revealing its text to common people, but manifesting the truth openly in heaven.

The Jade Protector King Qing left behind the Daoist Lord, named Longguangxuan, styled Youwu, born from the primal wood qi, flowing as azure rays with nine transformations upon the Eastern Jade of the Nation Xuanluo Mountain; verdant splendour imbued with essence, flowing pearls guarding, nine thousand cycles passing, fragrant with jade blossoms, revealing the root of medicines, a jade measure nine chi long, viewing the ten directions of the grotto, heavenly maidens holding robes, the Jade Emperor bowing his head, voices chanting clearly and loudly, the valleys and forests shaken with terror. The Celestial Treasure Immortal King conferred upon the Supreme Yuan True Secret Registers of one hundred and fifty-five writings, the truths comprehended throughout. He transformed the myriad beings, to open the Brahma’s destiny, declaring the root of the Dao as follows:

The utmost Dao is the hollow void.  
The root of transformation is the awakened mind.  
Heaven and Earth speak not, yet there is manifestation.  
The myriad things, the multitude of kinds, have their images.  
Thunder, wind, clouds, and vapours respond by means of stimulus.  
The reason (for this) is that the awakened mind attains it; none do not penetrate the hollow and transform.  
Transformation is permanence; change is its name.  
Heaven and Earth, myriad phenomena, all arise from the hollow void, which is non-being.  
Transformation, image, awakened mind, all proceed from the Inner Chamber.  
The Inner Chamber has the middle and the no (non-being); the hollow void has no middle and yet has being.  
The chamber has being; things do not depend upon man.  
Heaven, in its craft, is more skilful than man; it does not perceive but attains meaning; man attains by thought.  
To attain is to take it.  
Heaven manifests meaning to man, and gives it.  
What is given and united becomes the Dao, virtue, and primal qi blended as one, able to do all things and see all things.  
Birth and death, coming and going, the myriad kinds of cessation and generation, lie within the awakened mind.  
Heaven and Earth are my father and mother; there is no difference.  
The end and beginning, being and non-being, do not go beyond this.  
Following production, responding accordingly, it is manifested in the subtle.  
The subtle is the Supreme Clarity Divine Treasure Inner Chamber Secret Writing.  
Truth is truly in this.  
Secret is secret in this.  
He who attains this is a Supreme Immortal.

The Jade Protector Daoist Lord, at that time, body flowing with jade radiance, illuminating infinity without end, head adorned with a lofty crown, pearls and treasures reflecting his form, clad with the colours of guarding clouds, Heaven and Earth announced auspicious signs, cinnabar mushroom presented fragrance. By true Dao attained, retiring to fasting, he reported to the Golden Pavilion Sovereign, the Later Sage Truth, saying: "Great indeed, profound and supreme, by generation and wide bestowal, by long nurturing the source of transformation, this is called Jade Treasure, infant guarding the female, abundant grace without form; therefore named Qingtong." The Golden Pavilion Sovereign told Qingtong: "Thy body has jade bones, thy heart contains the Nine Sovereigns; the sun’s orifice high and low, under purple aspirations, the blue eye deeply reflecting; thou shouldst rightly ascend to the high truth; the supreme Dao secret is now opened to thee, and one form abides in Heavenly Harmony, also should refine coldness, so that being and non-being blend and transform, ascending to the Mysterious Palace." The Daoist Lord Qingtong retired to fasting in the gloomy forest, advancing by elbow steps to inquire deeply; then was told: "Thou shalt dwell in leisure, closing thy eyes to practice vision, so that it is as if they open; opening eyes and closing eyes, thou must not seek to see by seeing. Hold to this one hundred days; at night gaze and the light will pass through. Then again gather heavenly light in the mysterious mirror; diligently recollect that within thy body is crystal, and look upward to the True Ultimate below; in the Inner Chamber is the square inch of the Three Truths. Viewing for one hundred days, thou shalt hear as if heaven shakes with thunder; the square inch within may be as large as a zhang. One hundred and eighty days, like a great house. Three hundred days, like an official hall. One thousand days, equal to Heaven and Earth.  
Not by thinking but thinking, not by sensing but sensing, not by awareness but awareness, not by intention but intention; only the essence is what passes through, all phenomena complete.  
What the awakened mind attains is all within it.  
The Way of the spirit manifests itself, manifesting and yet obscure, vast and distant from the world.  
Within the Inner Chamber thou shalt see thy creation and transformation boundless, without limit or boundary.  
Suddenly thou shalt ascend to Heaven, sitting peacefully in the Inner Chamber, holding the scripture facing south; the Yellow Old one then nurses thee with divine marvel."

The Daoist Lord Qingtong practiced thus for a thousand days, body wearing the luminous jewels, riding the phoenix and mounting clouds, to visit the Sun Palace. At midday the red qi condenses essence, coiling and twisting a thousand folds; the spirit of the sun’s root gathers the quintessence of jade, named Yuyi Chizhang with dragon patterns. Qingtong saluted it, gathering the sun’s essence.

The Illuminated Jade Clarity Supreme Writing

Daoist Lord Qingtong said: "Drinking the cinnabar of the sun, the heavy rings shine brightly, drawing in the utmost essence, ascending to the moon; the yellow qi blends the expanse, secretly gathering golden radiance, containing the void and nourishing the clarity, calm is its spirit; therefore it is called binding the lapis yellow script of tiger patterns."

Daoist Lord Qingtong looked upward to the empty True Ultimate, merged with the shining deity; sun and moon conjoin qi, refining cold true form. Heaven and Earth receive its subtlety, spirit and brightness come forth from its chamber, turning and glancing at the Nine Heavens, flying swiftly to the eight directions, golden truth captures qi, jade firmament doubles its light. Light permeates the one form, inwardly seeing the three palaces, three palaces blend and transform, twenty-seven palaces, towering golden courts, seated arrayed jade infants.

The Nine Officers of the Mud Pellet, each palace named, below reaching the long tower, twelve jade cities.

The Middle Elixir Field has nine palaces. The hollow at the high place between the two breasts is the guarded double field; left is the great deity named Mingning, styled Shuping; right is the great deity named Zhengjing, styled Zizhang, wearing red embroidered garments, holding a fire bell to illuminate the four quarters.

The Lower Elixir Field has nine officers. By the navel on both sides the high hollows serve as guarded double fields; within are two great deities, left named Biaoyuan, styled Qi Wang; right named Liming, styled Jingqing, wearing purple embroidered robes, holding a fire torch, illuminating the nine abysses below, guarding and stabilizing life’s clarity. One inch inward is the Hall of Light, with great deity Taokang, named Yuwei, styled Shangming, wearing red brocade robes, sitting on a golden bed. Two inches is the Inner Chamber, with Mysterious Supreme Emperor Sovereign, named Wuyou, styled Mingzhen, wearing dark brocade robes, holding a key. Three inches is the Elixir Field Palace, within is Birth Palace great deity, named Wuguang, styled Qinyuan, wearing red cloth robes, holding jade bells.

Two inches above is the Inner Court Palace, within is Azure Origin Supreme Emperor, named Dahuang, styled Zengzi, wearing yellow embroidered robes.

Four inches above is the Inner True Officer, within is Emperor One great deity, named Bogao, styled Duyuan, wearing vermilion robes, sitting upright, facing outward. The nine palaces of the lower elixir field are also each a square inch, spirits and forms like infants, sitting among yellow clouds.

The Daoist Lord Qingtong had inner vision of the twenty-seven truths, arraying and enveloping the jade infants, secret in the lotus chamber, reversing spirit and ignorance, form united with Supreme Mystery, Dao and virtue come to dwell, becoming one with Heaven. He pronounced this blessing:

"Row upon row, clustered dwellings, jade officials and nine cities, three officials arrayed, cinnabar and bluish-green woven essence, circulating through a hundred gates, subduing and refining the corpse-form, wondrously uniting qi, transforming to generate brightness, serving and governing the great existence, ascending to Jade Clarity."

The Dao is complete with divine treasures, mysteriously leading the true secret; virtue covers the myriad kinds; the Jade Emperor smiles; the body bears the dragon chariot, turning among ten thousand heavens, looking down upon the three stars, sitting to know a hundred million years.  
He composed one chapter of scripture, engraved upon the Eastern Flower Jade Pavilion Mysterious Sanctuary, to transmit the Golden Name, Blue Writing, Jade Tablets, for those of high perfection.

The Lord Qingtong Jade Protector Dao Scripture

Nine openings of the dragon embryo first; the embryo’s subtlety is the Great Non-Origin.  
Jade emptiness flows a constant non-being, the true treasure of the perfect mind gathers.  
The gallant sun at East Mulberry mist, swallowing and drawing forth the Purple Pavilion.  
Three origins, utmost origin and beginning, highest virtue and principle supreme mystery.  
Inspired and moved though faint, wondrously awakening the Dao naturally.  
Taokang Xuanji father, fate’s essence ascends the Mud Pellet, vermilion pearl nourishes cloud root, heavenly radiance descends and enters the abyss, true spirit unites with mother essence, trickling faint flowing springs, silently governing Lord Bo Yu, morning mist rises and condenses smoke, illuminating and protecting Lord Jade above, guarding the town palace chamber, golden radiance conceals mushroom splendour, Supreme Emperor bows upon jade steps, mixed transformation true constant name, wisdom and benevolence command nine returns, hundreds of millions of years not much, unchanging flying spirit cinnabar, great Dao attains long existence, long existence opening and closing between.

The Dao Scripture of the Daoist Lord Qingtong Jade Protector, most solemnly pledged, is the mysterious pivot of the Way.  
Now resting in the blue forest, perfected by Supreme True, regulating and commanding divine qi, nurturing primal life, divine treasure true secret existing before Heaven and Earth.  
Whoever knows this writing and body attains immortality; knowing its precious secret, rises to ancestral mystery, in high attendance upon the imperial court, with unending longevity.
