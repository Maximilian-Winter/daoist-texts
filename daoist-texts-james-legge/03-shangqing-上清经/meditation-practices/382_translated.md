## The Primordial True Scripture of the Bright Hall of Supreme Clarity

The White Jade Turtle Terrace Nine Spirits Supreme True Lord and the Western Queen Mother imparted the teaching of the "Mysterious True Scripture of the Bright Hall," saying:  
"The Most High is mysterious beyond mystery; the two vital breaths are fully luminous; the true mystery shines within; the Bright Hall is pure without; it swallows the two lights of breath; the spirit and essence of long life are above; it supplements the Director of Fate; it supervises and commands myriad spirits; the six flowers overflow; penetratingly it perceives the Yellow Tranquillity."  
These forty characters constitute the original scripture of the True Mystery. What follows are all the Western Queen Mother's comprehensive and true further teachings on the methods of conduct, just as in the scriptures among the Nine Truths, only with the dragon as chief.  
All forty characters were carved by the Most High on the Southern Pavilion of the Phoenix Terrace; it is not taught to those who are not disciples of the General Truth, nor transmitted except to the chosen of the Director of Fate.  
The Record of the Profound Chosen, entitled "One who is to be born must first practice this Way," Yang Jun, as the divine Director of Wu and Yue, and Chief Steward of the fief, was granted to receive it; it is not necessary that all be disciples of the General Truth. This is doubtless an exhortation and inducement to assemble and encourage.

## The True Mystery Method

The Jade Maiden bears the title of the Supreme Mystery and the Upper Mystery, and is named the True Mystery; this is the so-called inner illumination. Moreover, it is the highest method of the true mystery; hence Dongqing says this is the way of true mystery, essential and not vexatious.  
Preserve the sun and moon in the mouth; according to this, at first one takes the Jade Maiden’s saliva; the forms of sun and moon enter the mouth, the rays of the mists flow in; finally returning to the Bright Hall, then one causes them to enter the mouth and ascend.  
If one does not preserve this Jade Maiden matter, one should use the later single-method formula, initially preserving the sun and moon as large as a ring in the mouth only. Preserve the sun by day, preserve the moon by midnight; it is also permissible to preserve without differentiating day and night. One may also depict the night and preserve both together. Generally, in all the ways of sun and moon, the rule is not so; hence it does not reach to the division into day and night methods.  
This says to preserve the sun by day, meaning the whole day is called by one term; preserve the moon at midnight, meaning the whole night is so called; it is not meant literally at noon or at midnight. Hence the later formula says to depict and preserve the sun and moon.  
If one were to preserve only once by day and night, one should do so at the time of the sun and moon’s first appearance, commonly following the actual written matter and then preserving it. If one desires to preserve multiple times, three times each by day and night make the measure; by day face the sun, by night face the moon, sitting upright with eyes closed and hands joined. If the sky is overcast and one is in the chamber, and the moon is not visible, one still faces where it ought to be.  
The sun is red in colour, the moon is yellow; the sun has nine purple rays, the moon has ten white rays. Cause the sun and moon to face the mouth at a distance of nine feet, the rays directed towards the mouth, straight as strings, to enter the mouth.  
At first, the sun and moon are preserved in the sky, as now seen as great luminous bodies; according to the method, they gradually descend, their forms shrinking, until nine feet from the mouth, perfectly round as pearls, bright and penetrating. The purple rays of nine beams are the purple rays of nine beams. Each ray has light and colour, each arranged as counted, all distributed around the edges of sun and moon, directed straight before me.  
Suppose one preserves the sun, then all the rays around the east and above, south and north, are bent inwards, and with the western rays collectively enter my mouth as if a string to the east; do not let them be scattered all around to left and right.  
Moreover, within the sun and moon is a maiden, her head adorned with a purple kerchief, crimson brocade mantle and skirt. She calls herself the Supreme Mystery, Upper Mystery, Red Glow Jade Maiden, named Chanxuan, styled Mizhen. When preserving the sun and all the rays are complete, one again preserves the vision of a maiden in the sun, reverently sitting receiving the hands, her veil three feet long, form and colour as jade, headwear a purple lotus kerchief, crimson brocade mantle, vermilion flying skirt, green and white belt, facing my mouth, kneeling and saying:  
'I am the Supreme Mystery, Upper Mystery, Red Glow Jade Maiden, named Chanxuan, styled Mizhen,' and because of opening the mouth she exhales red breath.  
The mouth exhales red breath, filling the space between sun and moon rays, combined with the mists and rays and all entering my mouth. According to the later prayer, to go out by the sun and enter by the moon is the prayer for taking the moon, and it says the mouth exhales scarlet breath; now in taking the moon, preserving the Jade Maiden, she should also exhale red breath, and all combined with the rays in complex union enter my mouth.  
This so-called mists and rays are still the previously passed outer red light of the crown rays; hence she is called the Red Glow Jade Maiden. Although the moon rays also have them.  
I command to swallow it; the preserved maiden also exhales accordingly; after ninety swallows are finished, I perceive the sun and moon’s forms closely approaching my face.  
The Jade Maiden exhales, I immediately swallow; the three kinds of breath at first are caused to descend thirty times to the palace of the Gate of Life; the next thirty times descend to the Scarlet Official; the last thirty times ascend to the Mud Pellet Palace; the conjoined light flows through the four limbs, penetrating the five viscera.  
Thus the forms of sun and moon gradually come near; at each swallow the light proceeds one inch; after ninety times, it rests upon the mouth, rising to the tip of the nose, descending beneath the chin; its brightness is clear and brilliant, distinctly hot; the form of the Jade Maiden also diminishes with the sun.  
Make the mouth of the Jade Maiden lap over my mouth, so that the vital fluid flows down into the mouth. The Jade Maiden always dwells in the sun and moon, causing her head and mouth to correspond with mine, the red breath and cinnabar liquid flowing into lips and teeth; it should not be swallowed yet, only after the prayer is finished should one swallow again.  
I then softly pray:  

"Great Firmament Purple Truth, Bright Hall Yin Spirit, Sun and Moon generate essence, Jade Maiden Chanxuan, first born from the void, styled Mizhen, headkerchief of purple radiance, lotus spirit crown, body clad in brocade mantle, vermilion flying skirt, going out by the sun and entering by the moon, heavenly light subtle and fragrant, mouth exhales scarlet breath, pouring into my three origins, face speaking to the heavenly court, soft soul controls the spirit, mysterious fluid flows, embryo essence grows full, the five viscera born of splendour, opening the infant’s returning countenance, supervising myriad spirits, Director of Fate flying immortal."  

Within these eleven lines, when taking the sun one should perhaps change the rhyme, for it says to go out by the moon and enter by the sun.

Finished, preserve the Jade Maiden’s mouth saliva, causing it to drip into my mouth, as if the previously flowing fluid were uninterrupted; after the prayer is finished, cause it to follow the breathing and swallowing. I also rinse the fluid and swallow again, and again ninety times.  
The saliva thus exhaled remains red in colour; one exhale and one swallow, through the three palaces in order, as in the former method. When the count is finished, the Jade Maiden raises her form, each following the sun and moon into the mouth, holding it a long time, then returning upward to the Bright Hall.  
At the time of the sun, she resides in the right Yellow Gate enclosure; I concentrate and recollect, and so all is finished. Calm the mind and reflect with much practice, without limit.  
Thus by day and night with no interruption, it may be done; it need not be limited to three times only. But since the bright numbers are many, combined with other tasks, thoughts may clash.  
If preserving the sun, then not the moon; if preserving the moon, then not the sun; this is because one cannot at one time preserve both sun and moon. The key is to preserve them evenly.  
This means one must not偏行 one method, but keep the numbers of sun and moon preserved by day and night approximately equal; by day one preserves the sun once, by night one preserves the moon once; by day three times sun, by night three times moon.  
If one cannot take at the appointed time, one should cause the two images to return to the Bright Hall, the sun on the left, the moon on the right, causing the sun and moon radiance to unite with the pupils, mutually communicating the energy and infusion.  
This is for times when one does not preserve for taking; one should also reflect on the sun and moon in the Bright Hall, the two images of red and yellow, purple and white rays communicating with the two pupils, mutually illuminating the whole body and face, shining through the nine palaces; when sitting upright one should often reflect thus.  
At this time the sun and moon are united and no longer divided into day and night preservation; hence it is necessary to preserve thus when not taking. If taking, the sun and moon cannot be at once in the same place.  
It is also permissible always to preserve the sun and moon in the Bright Hall, without awaiting the usual two images taken, but using them together.  
This means that unlike preserving the sun and moon where the Jade Maiden dwells, the Bright Hall always contains the refined essence divided; sitting or lying, one often reflects on it as if seeing it.  
By practice for five years, the Supreme Mystery Jade Maiden will descend at the hour of the Rat, and lie and breathe with one; the Supreme Mystery Jade Maiden can also divide her form into several tens of Jade Maidens, under the command of the Rat.  
This is the accumulation of sensation, congealing essence, transforming and producing visible forms, the utmost of essence, the subtle and wonderful response of sensation.  
This title of Supreme Mystery is the realm where sun and moon dwell; the Jade Maiden is also the daughter of the sun and moon lord; her form of transformation and influence can lie and feast together, not merely for pairing and meeting.  
Before, when lapping over the mouth and dripping fluid, if one harbours some anxiety in the middle chest, there will be no way for her descent. If the inward and outward are equal and smooth, then the crown is solid; afterwards dividing the body and scattering the image, though able to command, the true substance is difficult to attach.  
The Primordial Real One of Great Origin first studied the Way at Changshan; he dreamed that the Supreme Mystery Jade Maiden held a jade talisman and carried him west to the city; this was indeed this maiden; afterwards he truly received and practiced the True Mystery, sincerely responding, having deeply experienced the foretoken.

## The Most High True Official’s Use of the Way of the Sun’s Glow

Drawing upon the method of the Two Images, enabling man to be spiritual and attain truth, embodying jade radiance, commanding myriad spirits, ascending to the imperial chamber.  
The Most High True Official refers to the various Directors of Fate.  
Formerly the Real Man of Zhong Mountain taught the Way of Xia Yu; this is the True Mystery method, but only an excerpt without mention of Chanxuan.  
According to the Sword Scripture preface, Xia Yu took the Lingbao and practiced the Nine Truths; also recorded in the Five Talismans, the Real Man of Zhong Mountain taught Yu the method of taking sun, moon, and the five stars, differing from the present teaching.  
This is said to have no Chanxuan matter, corresponding to the later teachings of Dongqing, initially imparting only a single method to the second brother.  
What is recorded in this transmission exhausts the principles of the True Mystery, only the yin and yang Two Images internal true talisman in the Golden Scripture remain, not yet practised in the world.  
Formerly the Director of Fate received the True Mystery from the Queen Mother, and the General Truth formula; taught practice for three years, appearance like a maiden, with flowing light of the sun, face shining with jade luster; afterwards the Director of Fate gave the method of preserving the scripture to the second brother; with utmost sincerity and thought, within three years divine light was thus seen; then the matter of Chanxuan was further received, thus obtaining the position of the fixed record and life preservation.

## Dongqing Director of Fate Says:

My late master Wang Jun once saw the bestowal of the "Most High Bright Hall Mysterious True Upper Scripture," with clear fasting and rest from grains, preserving sun and moon in the mouth, by day preserving the sun, by night preserving the moon, making them as large as a ring; the sun is red with nine purple rays; the moon yellow with ten white rays; preserve and swallow the radiant liquid, always secretly practicing countless times.  
If one does not cultivate at the proper time, cause the sun and moon to return to dwell in the Bright Hall of the face, the sun on the left, the moon on the right, causing the two images to unite with the pupils, their qi communicating.  
This Way captures the movement to generate essence, harmonizes soul and spirit; six Ding attend, heavenly soldiers protect; this is the highest true Way.  
The Most High Mysterious True Scripture is first sworn to then practised; after practice one may hear the jade pendants and golden earrings sound.  
Ji Wei formerly fasted three years with sincerity and utmost single thought, thus able to receive it; then divine light shone upon the body, and then the scripture was received.  
This is the Way of True Mystery; essential and not vexatious. I always treasure it as a secret, keep it in my pouch and sleeve, thus showing it to you; it is to be cautiously kept secret.  
This should be the method received by Xia Yu; the Director of Fate now first imparts this simplified formula to Yang Jun, desiring the chief steward to practise it. At that time the Chief Steward’s spiritual pool was not yet clear, so the Jade Maiden matter was temporarily hidden; later convenient transmission records will show it; this is the so-called subsequent practice of True Mystery.  
The Bright Hall True Mystery has its own scripture, but little; mostly mnemonic formulas, exactly thus practised.  
Wei formerly did not obtain the scripture but followed this method and thus obtained the scripture.

If you desire to obtain it, go to Wei; the hidden script of jade pendants is not what Wei saw. The scripture is as recorded above; "if you desire to obtain it," meaning Yang Jun may seek the simplified method; the jade pendant and golden earrings are secrets of Dongqing, identical with the True Mystery class, all practising the Way of sun and moon, but fearing Yang Jun would seek it from two lords, thus this is also nurtured.  
At night walking and lying in darkness, if one fears in the heart, preserve the sun and moon to return into the Bright Hall; in a moment countless evils vanish; always so is best.  
This is the same as when not preserving for taking, preserving thus; in mountain seclusion, if thoughts have intrusion and trial, it is therefore best always to preserve thus to repel it.  
This formula is separately taught in the "True Decrees," not recorded above; since it is a family affair of True Mystery, it is taken to follow it; now those able to practise the Way of the Jade Maiden no longer cultivate this; therefore no further explanation.

## The Right Mao Transmission Formula

Of the original four matters, here is taken only one.

## The True Man of the Great Ultimate Taking the Highest Directions of the Immortals of the Four Poles and Cloud Teeth

A female disciple Wei Huacun received from the Real Man of Clear Emptiness the formula and a twelve-character annotation.

The Real Man embraces the radiance of the five directions’ primordial morning, eats the essence of nine mists, so that the spirit shines within, vermilion brilliance displayed without, the body produces jade radiance, form and qi luminous. Practising this ten years, the Elder of the Four Poles, Central Sovereign, descends at the hour of the Rat, merges with him, rides clouds and dragons, and ascends to heaven.  
The Five Elders of the Directions are the spirits of the natural five directions, not the work of worldly learning. The marvel of ten years is how swift it is—a wondrous Way of empty and real talk, a secret method of inhaling and exhaling.

Formerly the True Man of the Great Ultimate, son of the Western Beam, received the Most High formula, transmitted over a thousand years in five generations, not to be rashly revealed; the Four Bright Method, according to the secret book’s system, requires a five-day fast before imparting; an oath is made to abstain from swallowing the essences of the five directions, to fulfil the pledge of heaven and man without disclosure.  
The five-day fast and the five directions cover the living; when Wang Jun was at Huayin, he once abruptly obeyed with clear knowledge; in the mountains and forests this is the long fast; obscurity is true heart.  
The Real Man of the Western Beam having transmitted the Green Essence formula, again imparted this method, as its principles mutually assist daily, combining void and reality.  
The five pairs correspond to five directions, meaning they accord to the use of the five directions; or perhaps the Real Man calls pairs “directions,” hence the formula again reveals it; the formula is five pairs of rings.  
Also using five taels of blue silk; this is the method of the Real Man of the Western Beam. This annotation of the formula is correct; what the man proclaims is Wang Jun’s words. This original red annotation is by Yang Jun, orally transmitted.

## Eastward Facing, Tap the Teeth Nine Times, then Yin Prayer Says:

"East blue tooth, purple clouds flowing mist, three whites lingering, mysterious frost jade gauze, taking in the morning radiance, drinking the morning splendour." Three rhymes.  
After the prayer, with the tongue lick and touch outside the upper lip, take saliva and swallow the liquid thirty times. Each lick and touch causing one swallow; preserve the blue liquid, causing it to enter the liver.  
Practise ten years, the Elder of the East Pole comes, grants the offspring the Blue Truth, and merges; all ascend together. Blue Truth, this is the scripture name.

---

## Next Face South, Tap Teeth Nine Times, then Yin Prayer Says:

"South vermilion cinnabar, mist shining Supreme Subtle, nine paths of scarlet smoke, dispersing and spreading brilliance, taking in the spiritual morning, drinking from the cinnabar pond." Three rhymes.  
After prayer, with the tongue lick and touch outside the lower lip, take saliva and swallow the liquid thirty times. Preserve the red liquid, causing it to enter the heart.  
These two directions both lick the outside fluid of the chest, hence both have the word "touch."  
Practise ten years, the Elder of the South Pole comes complete, grants the offspring Scarlet Radiance, merges and ascends. Scarlet Radiance, this is the scripture name.

---

## Next Face West, Tap Teeth Nine Times, then Yin Prayer Says:

"West bright stone, flying mist golden liquid, taking in the Supreme Brightness, essence of pure spirit, drinking the jade nectar, spirit splendour awakening spirit, enabling me to ascend the void, rising to clear height." Four rhymes.  
The spirit perhaps fears it is morning already.  
After prayer, with the tongue lick and touch inside the upper lip, take saliva and swallow the liquid thirty times. Preserve the white liquid, enter the lungs.  
Practise ten years, the Elder of the West Pole comes, grants the offspring Pure Spirit Mighty Spirit, merges and ascends. Pure Spirit Mighty Spirit, this is the name of the six talismans.

---

## Next Face North, Tap Teeth Nine Times, then Yin Prayer Says:

"North profound nurture, auspicious clouds opening embryo, green mist spreading morning, purple canopy blue banner, taking in the moonlight, drinking the jade honey." Three rhymes.  
After prayer, with the tongue lick and touch inside the lower lip, take saliva and swallow the liquid thirty times. Preserve the black liquid, enter the two kidneys.  
Practise ten years, the Elder of the North Pole comes, grants the offspring Profound Record Precious Bright, merges and ascends. Profound Sickle Precious Bright, this is the scripture name.

---

## Next Face South, Sit Upright, Tap Teeth Nine Times, then Yin Prayer Says:

"The origin of Wu and Ji, yellow white five clouds, four mists purple view, eight images nine mornings, two lights stirring brightness, seven luminaries spirit honored, harmonizing essence pouring qi, taking in the central origin, brilliant splendour dragon embryo, drinking the sweet spring." Five rhymes.  
After prayer, rinse the mouth full, inside and outside the chest, between teeth and tongue, all covered and connected, take saliva and swallow the liquid forty times.  
This is also rinsing full once then swallowing each time; preserve the yellow liquid, causing it to enter the spleen.  
These forty characters, the true original wrote thirty, later added the character 丁; the brush side still seems true.  
This should be the center governing the four directions, like the meaning of the star gate’s guard.  
Practise ten years, the Central Sovereign the Upper Mystery Yellow Elder Lord descends, grants the offspring Yellow Qi Yang Essence Hidden Heaven Moon Escape Record Chapter Blue Essentials Tiger Book, all merging with the four elders and ascending.  
Among these are also scripture talisman chapter three books.

## This Jade Scripture Supreme Formula

Attains the Way of the Five Elders, cutting off grain and leaving the corpse behind, face radiant and youthful, unaffected by cold or heat, unharmed by disaster, spirit and immortality bright and clear, prolonging years and increasing measure, extending life ten thousand fold; at the limit of ten thousand periods, one attains the nine jasper jade liquids and eight precious flying essences, thus uniting the two images, heaven and earth in accord.  
This is doubtless specially speaking of the division of Cloud Teeth.

## All Five Yin Prayers Should Tap Teeth Nine Times

May be practised continually, no need for cockcrow or dawn; sitting calm at midnight in a quiet chamber, body pure, spirit at leisure, then it may be done.  
Formerly tapping the teeth only crowned the East; now it is clarified for all directions.  
The Five Mountains are named Suns, all also directions, closing breath.  
The one who guards unity, if hearing this Way, the matter quickly accomplished; empty and faint within, preserving the original swallowing liquid, this is called the true one, seeking many blessings for oneself.  
Attaining spirit by the six liquids and five breaths, the breath is already prepared; hence it is said "seek many blessings for oneself."  
In practising this Way, avoid eating dried meat; if hungry, eat flour foods, to gradually dispatch the grain, never to abandon it in one day; so called "reduce it again and again" until reaching non-action.  
Able to practise this grain-cutting is yet more virtuous than the Green Essence, the supreme Way above grains.  
Yet one must be quiet, faint, and without disturbance, devoting to accumulation of years for gain only.  
If combined with miscellaneous affairs, fear it is beyond the power of qi; it will not suffice to use food and striking support; outward and inward mutually assist.  
One must also consider the four forms of men, their weakness or strength, age distinctions; not to exhaust a single dish or use it all at once.  
Though men formerly received this method and praised it, yet ultimately did not use it, this is indeed a lofty consummation, and also should be followed by those nearby and remote.  
This Way of void reflection is the law of nature, so called "taking far the essence of heaven and earth, and near the various bodies"; this is what it means.

## Cloud Teeth

The essence qi of the Five Elders, the mist and smoke of the Great Ultimate; hence gathering the edge of the brilliance to fill and harmonize the six liquids, penetrating and mystically sensing, myriad spirits come down, dark reflections respond to one another, answering without singing.  
Therefore dragons roar in myriad abysses, and the image clouds fall from the sky; tigers roar on spirit hills, thus wind shakes in four directions; the fire drill summons brightness and vermilion fire rises; the place is rare and dark, and mysterious flow is full and overflowing, natural and spontaneous, beyond all measurement.  
Moreover, the student now dwells with fixed mind focused on mystery, carefully investigating the root of the Way, cleansing accumulated filth from the middle chest, truly preserving the three palaces, gathering the scattered brilliance of the five mornings
