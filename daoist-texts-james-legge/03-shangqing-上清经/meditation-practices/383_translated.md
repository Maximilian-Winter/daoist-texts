## The Supreme Clarity Cave-True Formula for the Explanation and Removal of Faults

### The First: On the Eight Seasonal Festivals the Perfected Spirit Qingling Lord Pei Offers Confession

The Perfected Spirit Qingling Lord Pei said: The Supreme Ultimate Perfected One is accustomed, at the noon hour on the day of the Beginning of Spring, to assemble immortals in the Palace of the Supreme Ultimate, to carve jade tablets, and to record the names of immortals. At midnight of that same evening, facing true north, looking upward to the North Pole, he bows twice, touching the ground with his head, stating the number of his faults and offences, and petitions for their explanation and removal. When this is completed, he bows twice again, and then ceases.

On the day of the Vernal Equinox, at noon, the Perfected One of the Jade Terrace of Kunlun, Taosu, gathers the officials of the immortals to establish the true scriptures.

On the day of the Beginning of Summer, at noon, the Five Emperors of Supreme Clarity convene the immortals in the Purple Tenuity Palace, see the Four Perfected Ones, and discuss the merits and faults of those who seek the Dao.

On the day of the Summer Solstice, at noon, the Three Officers of Heaven meet at the Departments of Life and the River Marquis, to verify the sins and blessings of all the people, increasing or decreasing their years accordingly.

On the day of the Beginning of Autumn, at noon, the Perfected Ones of the Five Sacred Mountains visit the Central Yellow Lord on the Yellow Chamber Cloud Court Mountain, assembling the officials of the immortals at noon to set the divine charts and spiritual medicines for the world.

On the day of the Autumnal Equinox, at noon, the Supreme Emperor ascends the Supreme Clarity Spirit Tower and the Pavilion of Taiwei, convening the Three Supreme Old Lords, the True Lords of the North Pole, the Great Gods of the Eight Seas, the Revered Spirits of the Five Mountains, and myriads of immortal officials, to collectively deliberate on the sins and blessings of the myriad masses of the world, to record the diligence or laxity in the study of the Way, itemizing all, and entrusting these to the Departments of Life.

On the day of the Beginning of Winter, at noon, the Perfected One of the Yang Terrace meets the officials of the immortals and the Jade Maidens, newly revising the register of those who have attained the Dao and entered the immortal records.

On the day of the Winter Solstice, at noon, all the genuine immortals assemble at the Eastern Sublime Palace, visiting the Eastern Sea Azure Youth Lord, to carve and fix the names of the immortals in the golden register.

Always, on the evenings and midnight hours of the Eight Seasonal Festivals, one offers thanks and confession for the sins of seven ancestral generations, parents, and one’s own faults, removing the names of offences from the self. By continuing in this practice, immortality is attained.

On the days of the Autumnal and Vernal Equinoxes, the Supreme Divine Truths convene to observe and deliberate on all immortals. Those not truly perfected should not lightly use these days for confession. The great immortals and officials assemble daily at noon on the Eight Seasonal Festivals, and in three days the confessions are resolved. Those who desire to cultivate the Dao must first fast and purify themselves, lest they fail in this.

The disciple Zizi Yuan received from Master Jiang the fifth secret formula, to on the Eight Festival days maintain mindfulness, to state the number of faults and offences since establishing oneself, to sincerely report them upwards, hoping the Celestial Sovereigns and all the perfected ones will inscribe and protect, to restrain the self and return to goodness, thereby seeking long life and immortality.

The festival of the Autumnal Equinox is the season when the Qi dwells in clear emptiness, the day of perfect harmony. On this day, the myriad true immortals hear all complaints. The officials of the region below, the inspectors of treacherous officers, and the officials of all territories investigate and report the merits and faults of the Daoists and the sins, deaths, and lives of all peoples.

The "True Record of Immortal Avoidances" states: If one desires to ascend to Heaven, one must be cautious at the Autumnal Equinox; sins, great or small, are all reported upwards. To seek immortality through sin is exceedingly difficult; therefore the heart of the Daoist is chilled. This is the essential teaching of Master Zhongyang of the Vermilion Fire Danling. The Qi of Autumnal Equinox harmonizes at midday, to follow Heaven and Earth. The great flame Qi is crushed by the force of decay; the profound water envelops the saliva, gestating in the abode of metal-birth. Thus the sun’s light transforms to minor Yang, nurturing Heaven and Earth, establishing the boundary of firmness and softness, uniting the order of the two principles, shining forth a flowing brilliance, separating the three lights of Yin and Yang — truly the marker days of the Eight Festivals, the essential ladder for seeking the Dao.

At noon on these days, the Supreme Emperor ascends the Supreme Clarity Spirit Residence of Broad Cold, the Purple Pavilion of the Heavenly Void, the long brocade jade tower, where the assembly of perfected ones gathers in the Taiwei Pavilion, opening the gate of the Nine Heavens, inviting the True Emperors of the Nine Heavens, calling the Three Supreme Old Lords and the True Lords of the North Pole, as well as the Great Gods of the Eight Seas, commanding the Immortals of the Five Sacred Mountains. The reverent myriads assemble in the Palace of Luminous Yang, to collectively judge the sins and blessings of all peoples, to record the diligence or laxity of those who seek Dao and immortality, to note their infractions according to days and months, their conduct of good and evil, penalties, and conditions of life and death. All are arranged according to their respective departments and origins, and entrusted to the Departments of Life, inscribed in the Imperial Register. The minutest sins and hidden merits of secret virtue are all separately known and recorded.

At midnight of that evening, one must go out into the central courtyard, face true north, look upward to the North Pole, remove the cap, bow twice, touch the ground, kneel long, and open to the Supreme Celestial Sovereign of the North Pole. Thereupon, one secretly thanks the sins of the seven ancestral generations and parents, and states one’s own faults and offences since establishing oneself. One begs for pardon and remission, promising henceforth to abandon former ways and cultivate the future. One’s words must be faithful; one swears by the red heart, pledges by Heaven and Earth, and dares not commit evil acts. The words must be said with the intent to express them; if one continues thus, immortality is assured.

When finished, one prays: May the Supreme Emperor remove the listed offences, send notice to the Three Officers, that the record of immortals be inscribed on jade tablets, granting long life and lasting vision, attaining truth and spiritual penetration.

Then one bows four times in all directions, bows twice more, and returns to quiet chamber to deeply restrain and remember the Three Primes and the Central Gods, to make an upward petition to the Supreme. This is done thrice, and the name is inscribed in the immortal register, the offences and faults removed.

The Three Primes are the Three Spirits of the Mud Pellet, the Crimson Palace, and the Cinnabar Field. To remember the Three Primes and Three Spirits, to petition the Celestial Sovereign, to request grace and pardon, and to assist what has been stated, ensuring it is surely heard above.

With these three petitions at the Autumnal Equinox, the register of the living is established, and the names of the dead are removed. This method is issued from the scripture’s command and Qing Tu, a secret method of long life.

Though common folk love the Dao, they have not departed the human world, which is full of offences and transgressions; those who commit them are many, so this method of the first confession of the Autumnal Equinox is not readily applicable.

Entering the mountains and forests, removing oneself from human affairs, dwelling in calm solitude, not harming any living thing, then one may perform it.

Since there are words of returning to goodness and oaths of reform, the words are already heard by the high and lofty. One must be cautious not to again commit evil or violate life.

Those who commit ten offences of grave crime will not be pardoned by Heaven and Earth; death is the proof, and no further amendment is possible. To seek the Dao by this means, nothing more is required.

Nourishing life is like the meeting of water and fire; if well obtained, one ascends to Heaven by day; if the precepts are violated, one perishes in the Three Springs.

Moreover, this day is especially important among the Eight Festivals, the so-called gateway of birth and death by Zhao Boxuan.

The "Plain Words of the Three Nines" say: On the day of Autumn Judgment, all ranks assemble; it is the day of birth and death. The ancients took the Autumnal Equinox as the day of Autumn Judgment for this reason: on the day of the Autumnal Equinox, the Emperors Supreme of the Nine Heavens and Eight Earths, all true immortal spirits, and the Supreme Emperor convene for three days and three nights to establish the fate of all people.

The matters gathered for discussion are many, and all the gods and spirits assemble.

On all the Eight Festival days, the true officials of Heaven and Earth meet successively for three days and three nights, and then each returns to their post.

This is the secret formula of Master Zizi Gong, a special case distinct from the regulations of the Seven Festivals.

### The Night Spirit Child's "Golden Root Scripture" says:

On the days of the Eight Festivals, when seeking the utmost assembly of immortals, the fated true immortals all gather for audience. The day before the festival, myriad spirits arrive at the palace; at noon on the festival day, the ranks and grades enter to pay respects; on the day after the festival, sins and blessings are distinguished; after three days and three nights, the heavenly affairs conclude.

You should be cautious with your sins, strive for merit and virtue, that your name may ascend to the true ones, and be registered in the Supreme Ultimate annals.

I do not speak deceitfully; those who know this are deeply secretive; hasten to confess faults, and keep it secret and cautious.

This was also told orally by Master Zhi to instruct Lord Pei.

### The Second: Master Xu’s Formula for Confession on the Eight Seasonal Festivals

Master Xu’s formula says: Always on the nights after midnight of the Eight Festival days, sit calmly facing north, preserving the form and mind, making the spirit as if seeing the portentous body.

When completed, place both hands crossed on the top of the head, knock on the ground, and expel the sins by twenty-seven strokes; then the offences will be removed, form and spirit will be separated.

---

### The Third: Master Xu’s Five Passage Days for Confession of Ancestors

Always on the Five Passage days, face north to thank and request pardon for the sins of three, five, seven generations of ancestors, that the sins of ancestors be removed.

The Five Passage days are the tenth month’s morning and the first day of the second month.

If the sins or punishments of ancestors are not removed, the desire for immortality is far away.

---

### The Fourth: Master Xu’s Five Reach Days for Confession of Ancestors and Self

On the Five Reach days, face north, bow five times, and in mind call the names of the Supreme Emperor and his consort thrice:

Jupiter True Emperor Yucan Yucan Yucan, Consort Feiyun Feiyun Feiyun.

Mars True Emperor Weiting Weiting Weiting, Consort Huaping Huaping Huaping.

Saturn True Emperor Tanyan Tanyan Tanyan, Consort Feixian Feixian Feixian.

Venus True Emperor Debiao Debiao Debiao, Consort Lingen Lingen Lingen.

Mercury True Emperor Jingyuan Jingyuan Jingyuan, Consort Long’e Long’e Long’e.

The five Empresses of the Right, the special characters, have no precedent in the ancients; this is the special formula of Consort Zhaoling.

When finished, knock teeth five times, complete the Five Passage, remove the cap, kneel long, and respectfully open to the Five Star, the Sun and Moon, the Supreme Emperor, the High True Daoist Lord, the Daoist Lord’s Consort, the Jade Clarity Supreme Highest Supreme Emperor, the Great Dao Sage Lord.

Then state the sins and offences of the seven ancestors and parents below, and down to oneself, numbering thousands of offences and faults since former lives, begging release.

The Three Officers will report to the Heavenly Emperor, so that the offences be released and removed from the cinnabar records.

Begging to be joined with the Five Stars’ true powers to hasten to the glorious morning, ascend Supreme Clarity, and to visit the Jade Pavilion.

The auspicious days of the Five Reach are:

- The sixth day of the first month at noon,
- The first day of the second month at feeding time,
- The seventh day of the third month at midnight,
- The ninth day of the fourth month at meal time,
- The fifteenth day of the fifth month at midnight,
- The third day of the sixth month at noon,
- The seventh day of the seventh month at midnight,
- The fourth day of the eighth month at noon,
- The second day of the ninth month at dawn,
- The first day of the tenth month at dawn,
- The sixth day of the eleventh month at midnight,
- The twelfth day of the twelfth month at midnight.

These are the recorded auspicious days of the Five Reach.

The Supreme hides the Five Passage days sealed in the Jade Bamboo of the Five Sacred Mountains, concealing the Way of Returning to the Origin, hidden in the Palace of the Nine Mornings.

Having cultivated the Five Passage, one should practice Returning to the Origin.

The Five Passage opens at the beginning of the Emperor; Returning to the Origin opens at the profound end.

Therefore, those who cultivate the Five Passage and practice the Seven Primes’ returning Way do not eat blood or strong-smelling flesh, nor see corpses or filth; those who violate this endure the trial of the Supreme Mystery.

The Five Passage are auspicious meeting days of the Supreme; Returning to the Origin is the day of renewal of the Supreme.

Without knowledge of the Five Passage, one cannot remove offences; without knowledge of the Returning to the Origin secret Way, one cannot inscribe names among the true perfected.

Always on these days, maintain auspicious thoughts, first confess the offences in the body, called liberation from seven generations, release from penal names.

These are not to be shown to the immortals of the Nine Palaces.

### The Fifth: The Supreme One’s First Formula for Confession and Removal of Faults at Midnight and Noon

The Supreme One said: If one has offences and wishes to first confess and seek to remove faults, at midnight and noon, enter the chamber, close the door, sit upright facing north, and imagine the Emperor Lord in the purple chamber within oneself.

Imagine the self also in the purple chamber, prostrate before the Emperor Lord, internally state one’s failings, breathe deeply for a long time until the whole body sweats, the clothes damp and steaming.

Do this three times; the offences will disperse.

When sweat pervades the whole body, then pray:

I, [name], have offences; may they be remitted by the hundred gods above; I beg to cross the seventy-two (steps), the calamities of water and fire; guardian fate Supreme One, beseech the Emperor Lord; with sweat flowing over the entire body, the three souls tremble in fear; by the grace of the Supreme One, forever remove these calamities.

Then call thrice the Emperor Lord’s name.

The Emperor Lord’s name is Lingfan, styled Lichangling, also called Seven Spirits, also Divine Old Man.

He constantly dwells in the Supreme Ultimate Purple Chamber, sitting upright and steady, with the appearance of an infant.

A purple aura covers his divine form, dressed in five-coloured splendid robes, wearing the crown of sun and moon.

Above the left ear is the sun’s diameter of nine cun; above the right ear is the moon’s diameter of one chi.

When the meditation is complete, open the eyes.

This is called the Emperor Lord’s Way of Removing Faults, internally giving thanks to the Five Spirits; the sweat is the response.

Common people, in confession, knock their heads and slap their cheeks; this is another method.

But for those cultivating the Three Ones and guarding the Cave Chamber, serving the Emperor Lord and the Supreme One, it is improper to knock the head and slap the cheeks.

Knocking the head frightens the three souls, disturbs the mud pellet, troubles the purple chamber, and vexes the Emperor Lord.

Slapping the cheeks causes the solid membranes to contract, the eastern spirit’s sinews to strain; the Supreme One grieves, the Five Spirits depart; this is greatly forbidden.

If one’s thoughts and actions are pure, even if the heart retains the motions of knocking and slapping, the faults are internally removed.

Immortals only maintain reverence of heart and bow; the form is not bent.

I say this is proper.

### The Sixth: Master Liu’s Formula for the Five Virtue Days of the Earthly Branches Chen and Si for the Family to Confess Faults

Master Liu recorded: Many have faults; Heaven’s net is loose but does not let any slip; the net of the unseen takes one’s fate, hence one’s lifespan is cut short.

Though the Way of Life is within the body, if one does not confess faults, many illnesses and worries will arise.

This text is from the Inner Chapter of the Taiwei Wen Chang River Chart, chapter twenty-three.

In such a family, there is decline and wasting; things do not succeed; children and grandchildren do not prosper; officials do not advance; livestock perish; sudden disasters assemble.

All these arise from many faults.

If able to wash away filth and clear the heart, to avoid lust and jealousy, to refrain from unrighteous conduct, to be kind and compassionate, to grieve at others’ grief and rejoice at others’ joy, to see others’ faults as one’s own, to see others’ gain as one’s own, to avoid slander and double-tongued speech, to give and relieve affliction, to increase lifespan day by day, and always attain one’s wishes.

Then on the day of Chen or Si at dusk, cleanse the place of Heavenly Virtue, which is said to be the land of Jia, Geng, Bing, Xin, and Ren.

Burn incense, the whole family facing north, remove caps, bow dozens of times, saying nothing aloud, but in the heart wishing to remove all offences of the whole family.

If faults persist, even many confessions do no good.

If no faults remain, and one can always cultivate this way of confession, one will never have worries or afflictions.

The auspicious Five Virtue days are:

- Jia Chen, Bing Chen, Wu Chen, Geng Chen, Ren Chen,
- Ji Si, Xin Si, Gui Si, Yi Si, Ding Si.

### The Seventh: The Supreme’s Returning to the Origin Secret Way for Removal of Faults and the Five Passage Days for Confession

The Supreme Returning to the Origin Secret Way Inner Chapter states:

The Supreme Jade True Hidden Origin Inner Vision uses the six Ding days.

At that time, the Heavenly Origin is displayed, membranes firmly bound, the seven souls report upwards, the three souls record faults, accumulated failings of seven ancestors, and accumulated penalties of the Three Yin.

Therefore, there is a method of elimination to liberate from fault and affliction.

Those who apply this Way are great seekers of immortality.

One must consider the Seven Primes, maintain the Way of the Nine Mornings, avoid sharing bedding with others, also clothing.

If men and women sleep on the same mat, they are recorded in the register of the Northern Mystery.

Those who violate by defilement will incur calamities and be sent to Hell.

Teachers and disciples mingling closely is also a violation.

The Five Passage are the auspicious meeting days of the Supreme.

Returning to the Origin is the day of renewal of the Supreme.

Without knowledge of the Five Passage, one cannot remove offences.

Without knowledge of the Returning to the Origin secret Way, one cannot inscribe the name among the true perfected.

Always on these days, maintain auspicious thoughts, first confess the offences in the body, called liberation from seven generations, release from penal names.

These are not to be shown to immortals of the Nine Palaces.

The Supreme hides the Five Passage days sealed in the Jade Bamboo of the Five Sacred Mountains, concealing the Way of Returning to the Origin, hidden in the Palace of the Nine Mornings.

Having cultivated the Five Passage, one should practice Returning to the Origin.

The Five Passage opens at the beginning of the Emperor; Returning to the Origin opens at the profound end.

Therefore, those who cultivate the Five Passage and practice the Seven Primes’ returning Way do not eat blood or strong-smelling flesh, nor see corpses or filth; those who violate this endure the trial of the Supreme Mystery.

Those cultivating the Cave Chamber and Purple Chamber, and maintaining the Nine Mornings and Seven Primes, upon first waking, at the first hexagram time, before and after meals, first lightly pray:

The Five Emperors of the Five Passages, the Six Harmonies Purple Chamber, Returning to the Origin secret Way, revealing the Seven True Ones.

The living soul is the Profound Father; the father transforms into the One and becomes the spirit.

The born spirit is the Profound Mother; the mother transforms into the Two and produces the body.

The one who controls my sinews and bones is the young lord; the one who takes my essence and qi is the White Origin.

Long life and lasting vision, flying immortals of the Ten Heavens.

Finished, do not let the ears hear the prayers.

This is the Supreme Hidden Prayer, to remove evil Qi, to bring forth spirit and energy, so that one’s life will never weary of darkness.

Then imagine the Northern Dipper Seven Stars descending from Heaven, flying into my mouth, straight to my heart, preserving the shining light, illuminating inside and out, deeply meditating.

Then imagine the Northern Dipper Seven Stars descending from the sky, flying into my mouth, straight to the liver, making light illuminate the five viscera, inside and out clear.

When finished, face north, bow twice, swallow saliva twenty-seven times, then rise.

On the day Ding You of the Jiwu cycle, at midnight, sitting upright on the bed facing north, holding hands, knock teeth seven times, look up to the Seven Stars, illuminate the north, long time.

Then imagine the Northern Dipper Seven Stars descending from the sky, flying into my mouth, straight to the spleen, making light clear and piercing, illuminating the five viscera.

When finished, face north, bow twice, swallow saliva twenty-seven times, then rise.

On the day Ding Wei of the Jiashen cycle, at midnight, sitting upright on the bed facing north, holding hands, knock teeth seven times, look up to the Seven Stars, illuminate the north, long time.

Then imagine the Northern Dipper Seven Stars descending from the sky, flying into my mouth, straight to the stomach, making light bright and illuminating; the five viscera distinct.

When finished, face north, bow twice, swallow saliva twenty-seven times, then rise.

On the day Ding Si of the Jiayin cycle, at midnight, sitting upright on the bed facing north, holding hands, knock teeth seven times, look up to the Seven Stars, illuminate the north, long time.

Then imagine the Northern Dipper Seven Stars descending from the sky, flying into my mouth, straight to the kidneys, making light clear and piercing, illuminating the five viscera.

When finished, face north, bow twice, swallow saliva twenty-seven times, then rise.

On Yang days, the star enters the left kidney; on Yin days, the star enters the right kidney.

One day is Yang, the next day Yin.

This Way forbids seeing blood, filth, foulness, sloth, or eating mixed, strong-smelling, or spicy foods; violation will cause extension of calamity to seven ancestors, and ruin the body; death condemns one to lower ghosts; this is called removal from the Emperor’s gate.

On the evening of the lunar month’s last day, the new moon, before the crowing of the rooster, one should be on the bed in the sleeping chamber, facing east, holding hands, sitting upright.

Knock teeth seven times, then look up to the Seven Stars, illuminating the left side of the self, long time.

Lightly pray:

Seventh, the Pass Star, Profound Yang, Heavenly Pass, Shaking Light, Great Brightness, Supreme Jade Emperor Dao Lord.

Call seven times; when finished, pray:

May the offences from seven generations below and those of my own dark private concealment, crimes of the five punishments, and tens of millions of spirits within the body be removed, recorded in the Northern Emperor’s ghost officials.

May my spirit and essence be fully open and manifest, sitting in the place of death and rise, hearing keen and free of noise, seeing purple light, carving jade in the Great Element, discerning ghostly forms, my name inscribed by the Emperor Lord, my fate balanced between two lights, flying among the Seven Primes, resting and feasting in the Purple Court.

Then imagine the Northern Dipper Seven Stars descending from Heaven, flying into my pupils, illuminating both eyes, causing inner and outer reflection, preserving sight of the five viscera, making them distinct.

On Yang days, the star enters the left pupil; on Yin days, the star enters the right pupil.

When finished, face north, bow twice, swallow saliva twenty-seven times, then rise.

On the Jia day at midnight, sitting or reclining on the bed in the sleeping chamber, head facing at will.

Hold firmly and close breath, settle spirit, long time.

Knock teeth nine times, then imagine the Northern Dipper Nine Stars, shining brightly on the crown.

When their light reflects mutually, then lightly pray:

Eighth, the Imperial Star, Supreme Jade Emperor, Divine Eight Scenes Lord, Ninth Revered Star, Taiwei Jade Emperor Lord, Tai Su Seven Morning Origin Lord.

Call nine times; when finished, pray:

May the offences from nine generations of ancestors below, and those of my own hills, mountains, waters, and springs, large and small, be removed; may the names be erased from the death register.

May secret hidden thieves, evil and treacheries, concealed and deceiving, matters numbering in the billions, recorded on the ghostly Mount Feng by the Northern Emperor.

May the death sins and violations be recorded by the Northern Supreme Nine Primes Supreme Ultimate True Lord Black Tablet.

I beg the Nine Primes Supreme Emperor Jade Profound Lord to remove all matters, to fly along the Seven Ways, to ascend Jade Clarity, to roam the Great Void, to ride the morning light, to rest in the Northern Eight Elements, to incline with the sun, to attend the Supreme Empress, and to govern myriad spirits.

When finished, imagine the Northern Dipper Seven Stars descending from Heaven, flying into the Mud Pellet Purple Chamber, illuminating the Mud Pellet, and the light piercing thoroughly through the whole body and five viscera.

Inside and out, emitting purple light and cloud Qi, making it abundant and luxuriant.

Meditate deeply.

When finished, face north, bow twice, swallow saliva thirty-six times.

If the Jia day coincides with the lunar month’s last day or with a Ding day, the thoughts and meditations are similar and close; one may adjust accordingly, not needing to be too frequent or close.

By acting thus, one attains completeness in true methods.

Thus the Supreme Returning to the Origin Way of Confession of Faults is complete.

The Supreme Clarity Cave-True Formula for the Explanation and Removal of Faults.
