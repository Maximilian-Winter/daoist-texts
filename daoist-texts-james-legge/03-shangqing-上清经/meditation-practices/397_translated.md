## The Supreme Clarity Dan Yuan Jade-True Emperor Sovereign Flying Immortal Supreme Scripture

The way of the Supreme Clarity Dan Yuan Jade-True Emperor Sovereign is the method of the Jiaotai Wonderful Spirit Jade Consort Qionghua’s nursing and nourishment, secreted in the Palace of Supreme Clarity Jiaotai and Imperial Pole. The jade book is engraved and given to the worthy perfected person. To pursue this way, one must purify the body and keep far from the hills, cleanse the heart and dwell in distant groves; the spirit and qi become obscurely one; observe a pure fast for thirty days, and then proceed thus for fifteen years. When the Way is accomplished, one becomes a Supreme Clarity perfected person. Again, one must mould gold and prepare cinnabar to offer to the master of the scripture, to show the pact not to be revealed; only then to cultivate according to the method, so that the purple qi descends, the Jade Consort ascends the chamber, the five viscera shine thoroughly, the hundred bodies become firmly golden, enveloped in vermilion clouds, receiving the book from the Jade Emperor, and flying to Supreme Clarity.

Each morning at the time of sunrise, one goes forth to the courtyard, burns incense and offers seats, knocks the teeth twenty-four times, then bows nine times and takes position. One places the hands on the knees, awaiting the equilibrium of qi and the settling of the will, and intensely contemplates that at the sun’s centre flows a radiance and rosy mist nine million zhang; from the sun descends, shining through my body. After a long while, one draws forth the essence of the mist, making it into forty-nine swallows into the abdomen, seeing the five internal organs dissolve and reflect one another, the outer wrapping shining like a torch; the spirit gazes upon the purple mist, reaching the endless heavens; then knocking the teeth nine times, the heart prays thus:

> Primal Essence Great Spirit, purple mist luxuriantly born,  
> Golden light entwined and whirling, refining and tempering my form,  
> The corpse-dust loosens and falls away, uniting with the Way and spirit,  
> Enabling me to perceive clearly the Great Luo Supreme Clarity.

Next, one imagines under the sun’s purple mist light-root a female figure like a babe, with a head formed of three-cornered cloud-knot, wearing a vermilion veil, clad in brocade garments, adorned with pale jade pendants; in the hand she holds the talisman of the Sun Emperor Jade-True purple mist, flying and stepping on the mist, coming before me; commanding the utmost attention, not to be neglected; silently praying:

> Supreme Clarity Dan Yuan Jiaotai Wonderful Spirit Jade Consort, named Yu Dongzhu, styled Jing Mingying.  
> Thus thrice repeated:  
> Let my body master the purple mist, ascend to the sun palace,  
> Drink the jade-purity, and live in accord with the Way’s age.

Next, one imagines the Jade Consort supporting my left hand with her right, taking my form up, flying upon the purple mist and radiant light, hastening to fly into the sun. After a while, feeling the form somewhat warm, one sees my shape within the sun’s gathered light; then one sees the Supreme Clarity Dan Yuan Jade-True Emperor Sovereign seated upon a purple cloud in the sun’s centre, his form like a babe, wearing red brocade and jade robes, a belt of five bright moon pearls, the mouth holding a red sun; from the sun arise nine rays, the rays become purple, and on each purple ray is attached a jade essence, like a chicken’s egg, as large as a pellet; the radiance hangs down, about nine inches long; the jade essences are of purple, vermilion, blue, white, yellow, green, indigo, dark blue, and azure nine colours; the jade essences move in circles, the light and qi whirl about them.

Next, one imagines the Jade Consort at the Emperor’s right, my form kneeling before, bowing nine times with the heart, praying:

> Supreme Clarity Dan Yuan Jade-True Emperor Sovereign Supreme True Way Lord, named Long Jingteng, styled Jiaoxi Lu.  
> Thus thrice repeated.

Then one imagines taking the jade essence by mouth, beginning from pale jade, receiving the jade essence into the mouth, feeling some warmth, then swallowing into the lower elixir field.

Next one imagines the essence of dark blue jade entering the elixir field, next the essence of green jade settling in the Ming Hall, next the essence of blue jade entering the inner chamber; these four jade essences suspend and fix in their places, shining brightly as the sun. Next the purple enters the left kidney, the female enters the right kidney, vermilion enters the heart, blue enters the liver, white enters the lungs, yellow enters the spleen, causing the five viscera to receive them; the jade light interchanges and reflects, form and spirit become one. Knocking the teeth nine times, one imagines the form standing before the Emperor, praying:

> Spirit rays mysterious transformation, nine jade divine essences,  
> Sun True Emperor Sovereign, king of the supreme Way,  
> Purple mist rushing in, Ming Hall and inner chamber,  
> Refining my five viscera, spontaneously generating jade pendants,  
> Precious marrow and elixir liquid, clouds soaring high and flying.

Suddenly forgetting the form, one is united with the sun as one body; after a long while, the work completed, one finds oneself unconscious of being on the seat, still as the sun’s appearance. At the time of the sun’s zenith, in a chamber facing south with great seat, one places hands on knees and contemplates that at the sun’s zenith there is a vermilion mist nine hundred feet long, flowing down from the sun’s border to connect with my body, shining brilliantly. One imagines the Jade Consort holding a purple jade jar, flying upon the mist, coming down before me, silently praying the name and style as before, thus thrice repeated. Next one sees the Jade Consort placing the jade jar to my mouth, imagining in the jar yellow jade nectar, drinking thereof, taking nine sips, the heart holding the jade nectar growing lively like clouds, dispersing thoroughly through the five viscera, raising the whole body into red radiance. Then praying:

> Wonderful Jade High True, spirit of the Sun Emperor,  
> Holding and directing marvelous transformation, guiding the sun spirit,  
> Jade jar with yellow nectar, feeding upon the sun’s spirit,  
> Blossoming throughout the five viscera, long life renewed by the jar,  
> Form dwelling in Jiaotai, abiding with the qi.

Next one imagines the Jade Consort bowing and taking my form, rising together and ascending to walk upon the vermilion mist, arriving at the sun’s centre, clearly seeing that at the sun’s centre there is a vermilion jade platform, high and broad, a thousand leagues in extent, in the midst a golden bed, whereon one lies; the Jade Consort facing south with head bowed, my form facing north; then forgetting the form, dwelling within the Jiaotai. At midnight awakening on the bed, facing the place where the moon resides, bowing five times with the heart, one imagines that in the moon there is a white radiance mist seven million zhang long, flowing down to connect with my body; within the mist a female, wearing a crown of green lotus and hibiscus, yellow brocade garments, holding a golden plate in which is a divine pearl like the bright moon, slowly descending to stand before me. Knocking the teeth six times, praying:

> Golden True of the Moon, Supreme Clarity Divine Mother,  
> Named Yue Wu Ting, styled Wei Ni Yan.  
> Thus thrice repeated.

Taking the pearl and swallowing it into the heart, causing the light and qi to penetrate fully, praying:

> Golden essence primordial element, divine pearl of utmost truth,  
> The essence light densely shining, dispelling the dust of the heart,  
> A hundred spirits transformed and refined, my qi combined with brightness,  
> Wishing to abide with the Most High, dwelling in form at Supreme Clarity.

Next imagining the Golden True Divine Mother hiding form, becoming one with light and mist, I also forget the form, vast and ungraspable.

The talisman of the Sun Emperor Jade-True purple mist, written in vermilion on blue silk, kept in a vermilion pouch, is worn. Another smaller talisman is written on blue foil, to be taken on the first, third, fifth, seventh, ninth, thirteenth, fifteenth, seventeenth, nineteenth, twenty-third, twenty-fifth, twenty-seventh, and twenty-ninth days, each to be taken once; facing east, bowing twice in taking it, and sending it down with the mysterious spring.

## The Text of Jade Purity’s Naturalness

The Daoist who pursues this Way must above all avoid uncleanliness, decay, and unrefinement. With utmost diligence practising it for fifteen years, receiving the book, becoming a Supreme Clarity perfected person, he obtains mastery over flying dragons, and from the thousand jade youths enters and exits the Great Ultimate. He pursues the way of the Jade-True Emperor Sovereign taking the sun-centre jade essence, the Jade Consort drinking the yellow nectar of the sun-centre golden truth.

The method of taking and consuming the divine pearl, when the Way is accomplished, the nine jade sun essences transform into nine cinnabars, engendering portentous divine qi; after fifteen years the nine jade essences transform into nine-coloured divine dragons; the essence of the divine pearl transforms into a chariot of divine light, raising the portentous body to ascend Supreme Clarity. The Western City’s General True Lord transmits Master Mao of Great Mystery; the Wen River perfected person Lord Cai secretly at the Supreme Clarity Jiaotai Imperial Pole Palace, the Emperor Sovereign Jade Consort’s regulation of refining the immortals.
