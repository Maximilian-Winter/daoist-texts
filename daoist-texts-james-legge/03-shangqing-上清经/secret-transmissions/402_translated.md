# Secret Instructions of the Scripture of Shangqing

The scripture is named: Secret Instructions of the Scripture of Shangqing. Originally it bore no title of its author. Within it are the words "I have heard," which must be attributed to the Tang emperor Minghuang as the author. It was compiled from the Three Caverns and their scriptures and secret instructions. The original number of scrolls is uncertain; now only more than six hundred characters remain. The original source is from the Zhengyi division of the Daozang in the Zhengtong edition.

Secret Instructions of the Scripture of Shangqing

According to the purport of the scripture, one should knock the teeth together and ponder the spirit, silently meditate and call it to mind, and then one obtains ascent by flight.

The great Way is the One Vehicle, divided into the Three Caverns; hence the teaching unfolds gradually and suddenly. Men have the wise and the foolish; methods are set to suit occasions, but the essential point is to harmonize with the Dao. Yet there is the precept to guard against error and stop evil, to regulate and sever the six emotions; the talismanic registers advance in rank to ascend to immortality and far transcend the three worlds. Therefore the "Chapter on the Nature of the Dao" says: Precepts and conduct gather all living beings, recording and drawing them back to the One of truth. From superficial investigation there is no lack of superiority and inferiority; from the mundane entering the sacred, each has its ranks and degrees. The orthodox and singular immortals are the initial precepts; the Jade Purity ascending to the mysterious is the final register; penetrating the mysterious and harmonizing with the Dao, conforming to true words and images, to found the Way, instruct the person, practise the teaching, and observe the rites. I have heard that in the boundless expanse the true Ruler abides; at the first dusk and dawn the sages are seen and heard; their teaching is benevolent but not possessive; their Way is daily used and yet ever new. Then, shining are the cloud-seals and immortal writings, secret in jade chapters and jade slips; none but the lord who grasps the chart and receives the register can practise the teaching; none but the recluse of truth who selects the worthy can open its writings. The bright truth has five branches; the Most High left ten precepts. Our state’s ancestral emblem is the accumulated blessing of white clouds, inheriting the wondrous purport of the Mysterious Origin, uniting the virtues of the Two Agencies, and sharing the radiance of the Five Saints; all by the supreme Way nurture myriad kinds, and foster virtue to oversee the myriad people.

The Scripture of Shangqing says: The Three Caverns are: first, the Cavern of Truth; second, the Cavern of Mystery; third, the Cavern of Spirit, each having twelve gates, divided into thirty-six departments of venerable scriptures, corresponding above to the Three Pure Ones and the thirty-six heavens, below to the nine ramparts and the thirty-six palaces and mansions. Hence the human head has nine palaces, the heart nine apertures, the navel nine spirits, the form nine gates, in all thirty-six places. The Scripture of the Creation of Spirits in the Nine Heavens says: Man is born within the womb; the Three Primes nourish and foster him; nine vital airs form the body; for nine months the spirits are distributed; when the qi is full he can utter sounds; the body yet has the spirit complete; the Nine Heavens acclaim the blessing; the Great One holds the talisman; the emperor sovereign appoints the orders; the registrar records the registers; the master of fate fixes the reckonings; the Five Emperors supervise birth; the holy mother guards the chambers; the heavenly spirits and earth deities, the three realms together attend, none are lightly regarded. The Secret Instructions on Ascending to Truth say: The principle discussed is that same one principle, which is the pure contending Way-nature within the body of all living beings. The Way-nature is neither existent nor non-existent; the true nature ever abides; therefore by it one communicates with the Dao. The Dao is existent but without form; it has form but has feeling; changes and transformations are unfathomable; it penetrates the myriad beings; in man’s body it is the spirit and brightness; therefore it is the heart; therefore teaching men to cultivate the heart is to cultivate the Dao; teaching men to cultivate the Dao is to cultivate the heart. The Dao cannot be seen; by birth it is made manifest; birth is not constant; by the Dao it is guarded; birth and death then cause the Dao to fail; harmony with the Dao is longevity.
