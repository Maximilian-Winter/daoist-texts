# The Scripture of the Yellow Writ of the Supreme True and Most Subtle, Heavenly Emperor Lord of the Stone Scene, Golden Yang

Title of the Scripture: The Scripture of the Yellow Writ of the Supreme True and Most Thorough, Heavenly Emperor Lord of the Stone Scene, Golden Yang. The author is unknown; it is roughly dated to the late period of the Eastern Jin. Originally it formed one of eight scrolls of the "Yellow Writ of the Supreme True and Most Thorough." It treats of the methods of swallowing talismans, amulets, and incantations. The original source is the "Zhengtong Daozang," section on Supreme Truth, category of divine talismans.

### The Supreme Emperor’s Summoning of Souls, Various Texts

The "Golden Yang Simple Scripture" says:  
He who desires to live long and become a spirit-immortal ought to know the Way of Embryonic Breath; this is the treasure of seeking life. It restores years and returns whiteness, prolonging life without ageing. Always, after midnight, in the time of the birth of life-energy, sit upright facing east, close the eyes and hold the breath; when the breath is at its extremity, then cease. If one can constantly do this, a hundred diseases and myriad harms will not affect him; the spirits, goblins, and demons will not dare to molest him.

At daybreak, when the sun first rises, face it directly and slightly inhale the essence of the sun through the nostrils; swallow it, but after a short time stop. This will give one the appearance of a young child, a radiant face, never with wrinkles or spots.

Taking in the breath prevents hunger; the method of swallowing the sun's essence prevents ageing; closing the breath and practising embryonic breathing prolongs years without limit. Constantly maintain the twenty-four spirit commands of the signs, so that there will be no illness. When illness secretly comes, call the name of the spirits and pray; in a moment the sickness will be healed.

The "Golden Yang Scripture" says:  
Constantly think of the red energy issuing from the heart; it rises and passes through the throat. With the mind close it at the Mud Pellet (the point below the tongue), and do not let it cease. The Three Corpses will depart of themselves. Long life and extended vision are thus secured. The Director of Destinies carves the name, and affixes the talisman of immortality in purple.

If you desire to ascend as a dragon to enter the Dipper, always take the Nine Terraces talisman; then you will meet the Great Unity. If you do not take the Nine Terraces talisman, then the celestial gate remains closed and will not open. When you wear it, all the myriad gods and celestial immortals come to descend into your chamber; by day you fly and ascend to the palace of the Most Subtle, where you may govern the officials of the immortals.

The Supreme Subtle Heavenly Emperor says:  
The eighteen talismans of the Stone Scene of Supreme Clarity, and the single chapter of the Supreme Emperor’s Summoning of Souls, are secret writings of Supreme Clarity. Originally issued from the Jade Pavilion of Supreme Clarity, afterwards sealed within the Kunlun Mountains, inside the Golden Hall and Jade Gate, opened but once in ten thousand years. Formerly the Supreme Subtle Heavenly Emperor received them from the Immortal Elder of the Mysterious Garden, and thereby obtained flight to Supreme Clarity, receiving the rank of Heavenly Emperor and accomplishing all his desires, paying homage at the Golden Palace, and guiding the cloud dragons. Those who desire to learn the Way and do not obtain these talismans will not succeed; they will labour in vain upon mountains and marshes, and cannot escape defeat at the hands of demons and trials.  
Those who wish to take them should write the talisman with orpiment ink; do not use cinnabar ink. Write it on paper, burn it and swallow the ashes; it is also possible to make a twelve-inch paulownia tube with characters inside and outside, which will surely cause a swift ascension to heaven. Do not disclose it frivolously; it is not to be transmitted to the unworthy. Here it is recorded and set forth to control the myriad spirits, to call Yin and summon Yang, that all desires may be instantly fulfilled. If this is leaked or the rules disregarded, disaster will befall seven generations. Can one not be cautious? Can one not be cautious?

If you wear the talisman of the Eastern Peak, the divine writing opens out Supreme Clarity; the cloud chariot will receive you, and you will know all things beforehand. The Five Peaks follow the same method; begin with the Eastern Peak and then take the others in order. As for the eighteen visiting talisman seals, write them all on purple silk, first store them in a tube, and on the first month present them at the famous mountains; after the presentation, place them between great stones, allowing no one to know. Use seven sheng of yellow earth to make mud to seal above. At the end, pray thus:

"Adorned with the talisman of Supreme Subtle Stone Scene Yellow Writing, now carefully written a single copy, to return to the Immortal Lord, so that I may ascend the void, move without riding clouds, with immortal spirits to serve and protect, together with the true as a host."

Thus is it finished. The Five Peaks all employ such methods; these are the writings of the sacred immortals of mountain stone chambers, revealed to you; the divine elixirs and wondrous herbs will naturally appear.

If you desire to make the Golden Yang talisman, prepare the seal and burn the writing; swallow both seal and ashes, and suddenly you will possess divine faculties. The method of wearing the seal is to write it in ink; swallow one seal and follow the prescribed course; seal the talisman with it, and wear the talisman. Always first eat and wear it; when the talisman enters, you will feel heat and cold, and your vision will be more clear. In a moment there will be a white-robed jade youth, or a scholar, standing upright before you. Do not be alarmed; in a moment, he will disappear. Keep it for thirty days; your body will naturally grow light and rise. The highest adept can soar into pure emptiness and feast in Supreme Clarity; the middle adept can elevate his form a hundred zhang; the lower adept ten zhang.

When you wear the eighteen talismans, you will see the seal-wearing person. This proves your sincerity and earnestness; the jade youth and jade maiden of the talisman guard will appear as true manifestations.  
Before wearing the talisman, abstain from the five pungent foods, blood foods, and sexual relations; do not walk in filth. For a hundred days dwell in a secluded chamber without companions; do not mingle with the vulgar or make noisy company. Thus the Way will be accomplished.  
Those who wear the Stone Scene Golden Yang talisman must especially avoid impurity, arrogance, and evil deeds. Cultivate the person and meditate on the Way; fasting, stillness, concentration, and earnestness come first. If you can cultivate this Way, you may ascend as an immortal, befriend the genuine Heaven, communicate with the myriad immortals, command and summon spirits, and bring down golden elixirs and miraculous herbs. You will be seated and conduct your journeying kitchen, with dragon chariots and feathered canopies, spirit youths and jade maidens, the myriad spirits of the world all come running to serve you. Nothing is unknown; all requests are fulfilled.

The separate talisman of Heaven and Earth can ward off armies for ten thousand li; those who plot against you will suffer disaster; those who raise five weapons against you will injure themselves. They may be sealed, burned and swallowed, or placed in a bamboo staff. The twelve-inch tube, nine inches long and four inches wide, contains the talisman writings, and is kept in a talisman tube to be tied to the arm—left for men, right for women. Secret, most secret! Unless one is a recorded son of the Supreme Ultimate Jade Tablet, one must not encounter it. Those who obtain it will float and roam the four quarters, avoid myriad disasters. Those who wear it will enjoy blessings and long life; their descendants will flourish. Daoists who possess it will fly to Supreme Clarity; those who have it receive blessings; those who cultivate it ascend to the void.

If you desire to ascend and enter the Supreme Subtle, you must wear the unsurpassed spiritual talisman, then you will enter the Great Unity of the Primordial Sovereign.  
If you desire to pay homage to the Heavenly Emperor in the Purple Palace above, you must wear the Supreme Spiritual talisman.  
If you desire to see the Supreme Dao Lord, you must wear the Bright Hall talisman.  
If you desire to enter the Five Peaks and have their great mountain gods and all the immortals come to serve and protect you, you must each wear their respective peak talisman.  
If you desire to enter the Primordial Pass, you must wear the Primordial Ancestor talisman, and then you will see the Primordial Ancestor Lord.  
If you desire to wear the talisman to obey the immortal officials and see the one hundred and twenty spirits, you must wear the Myriad Spirits talisman, and then you will see the various immortal lords.  
If you desire to descend and see the Nine Spirit Men of Supreme Clarity, you must wear the Heavenly Gate talisman, and then you will see the Supreme Clarity Lord.  
If you desire to ascend to heaven and enter the abyss, flying and travelling through the eight simples, moving at will with concealment, you must wear the Supreme Subtle Heavenly Emperor Stone Scene separate talisman; then the spirits of heaven and earth will not detain you.

The Supreme Subtle Heavenly Emperor Lord says:  
The Heavenly Gate talisman is the fourth from above. If you practice and wear it, first burn incense on the left and right; forty jade youths and forty jade maidens will each guard it. Those familiar with the scripture will worship with reverence, presenting splendid yellow brocade. Do not allow the jade youths and maidens to find fault with you; should you not be diligent in this?  
Those who receive this text should use forty feet of yellow brocade and seven taels of gold. Before receiving it, master and disciple must fast and purify for seven days, or four days, then make a solemn covenant. Those who wear and keep this text are all under the great blessing of the Golden Yang Stone Scene.

The "Golden Yang Scripture" says:  
Whenever you keep, wear, or carry it, click your teeth thirty-six times, swallow saliva thirty-six times, then look before you and silently pray thus:

"Supreme Subtle Heavenly Emperor, Purple Palace Spiritual Revered, Mysterious Void Supreme Truth, the forerunner of the Emperor, whose Way is vast, whose transformation is natural, whose true principle is latent and unobstructed, flowing through without interval, essence entering the Bright Hall, protecting the embryo and benefiting the soul.  
The Vermilion Mountain opens twice; reverently we welcome the spiritual origin.  
Left gather the sun’s splendour; right gather the moon’s root.  
Flowing fire ten thousand zhang, golden gauze, blue skirt,  
Waist girdled with the celestial record, headwear a splendid crown;  
Grant so-and-so ascent to the void, flight to Supreme Clarity, petition to ascend as immortal, commanding myriad gods, heavenly spirits and earthly deities, none dare disobey; all directions gather, blessings and virtue as mountains, wondrous sounds resound afar, evil demons vanish as smoke."

Use the right Supreme Emperor’s summoning soul talisman; at cockcrow face north, burn incense and swallow it, thus gathering the soul and spirit. After wearing the talisman, silently pray thus:

"The Supreme Emperor shines bright, harmoniously gathering souls in the court.  
The three souls and seven spirits guard the old form;  
Spirit rests and body is whole, thus one may live long;  
A hundred diseases disperse, the five viscera are peaceful,  
Grant me flight as immortal, guiding cloud chariots;  
The red child supports and assists, receiving essence of breath,  
Cover me with the purple canopy, leading and following the grass spirits."

Then click teeth three times and swallow saliva three times. After wearing the talisman, always keep in mind the prayer and method, so as not to lose the myriad spirits, and keep it secret in practice.

According to the True Maiden of the Nine Flowers:  
The Supreme Subtle Yellow Writ originally consisted of eight scrolls. The perfected man formerly taught Xu Yuanyou in the Red City Mountain with the "True Writ of Eight Talismans Intertwined," which the enlightened ruler possessed. The reason you have not yet soared to Supreme Clarity, nor ridden cloud dragons, is because you have not beheld the eight simple chapters of the Stone Scene Yellow Writ. Now I hand them to you, there are altogether eighteen talismans with the scripture preface; study and cultivate them, driving the dragon step by step, gradually raising the form.  
Keep it secret and treasured; the Yellow Writ of the Stone Scene of Supreme Subtle is no trivial art of yellow and red. Many successive warnings have been given. If your heart and mind are not stirred, though your conduct is already manifest and your jade body marked by auspiciousness, tasting the mystery and chewing the truth, calling and drawing the radiance, condensing and quieting the six spirits, seeking and distinguishing the eight clear lights, resigning and following the spiritual root, preserving and refining thrice, nourishing the fluid and harmonizing the soul; even if fierce winds rage and stir, they cannot damage your true nature.  
Cut off arrogance and conceit; how can you then return to purity and simplicity? You then chant in emptiness, with an open heart await the spirits, managing the myriad severances, dwelling in clarity and utmost truth, so that grief and burdens do not afflict your mysterious abode, and sorrowful thoughts do not disturb the crimson ferry.  
With detachment and subtle observation, regard the radiance with delight; thus supreme joy resounds in your ears like cloud chimes or tiger strings striking empty pavilions. The mouth tastes fragrant wind, the eyes receive three clouds, wearing and bearing Golden Yang, commanding the myriad demons, bowing and raising in the four seasons, naturally attaining truth.  
What you see and hear has already harmonized with the spirits. The perfected man attains truth in this way, and only thus gains it. To force truth without truth is to stumble and fall.  
Again, if errors and diseases fill the records, with sorrow and anxiety choking the breast, constantly labouring and burdened, secretly lamenting the petty Way, trying to please all listeners, seeking a heart at ease in old age, suddenly a sorrowful sound arises.  
All night long bewailing death and demise, with a grieving heart for the departed, essence and spirit separated, three souls fallen and breath departed; evil fate occupies the space, the spirits warn the goblins and demons, abandoning me in the empty chamber, encountering myriad calamities. How can one grasp the Way of life only to rush into the death chamber?  
The spiritual wind already stirred, just about to tread the death room, casting away auspicious omens and throwing oneself into evil filth? Though fame and renown be high, yet hesitating; though clear laws be seen, yet doubts remain unresolved.  
Thus they weave filthy petitions, making foul the early morning hidden writings, drums beat at the four extremities, the three officials search for spears, swearing to forget the Great Beginning.  
Then the divine tiger claws, the poisonous dragon bares its teeth, the eight directions are truly vast, nowhere to escape.  
After giving thanks, one then understands the purity and clarity to be admired, and the words of the speaker are not false. Yet the sorrowful voices confuse the truth and disturb the correct breath.  
Why then should the enlightened ruler not always dwell in the land of blessing, to shake off his clothes here and return to his chamber?  
Now I entrust the Stone Scene Golden Yang writings to you, so that you may fully see the head of the eight scrolls.

The Scripture of the Yellow Writ of the Supreme True and Most Subtle, Heavenly Emperor Lord of the Stone Scene, Golden Yang.
