The True Text of the Binding Cords of the Supreme Clarity and Great Subtlety Sovereign Lord

Also called the "Text of Interlaced Bands," it arises from the Scripture of the Supreme Ultimate Interlaced Bands.

This text appears in the Fourth Section of the Cavern of the Perfected, Scroll Thirty-One, fully issued from the True Edition of Master Lu, with colors and numbers as follows.

This method requires thirty days of fasting, with nine pairs of talismans of the Guo, Yuan, Ling, and Sang knots. According to this method, the Great Subtlety Sovereign Lord purifies himself in Jade Heaven, receiving it from the Most High Jade Emperor, dividing the spiritual pledges among the nine households, binding the central cord at the Heavenly Gate, and casting oath and faith into the Vast Void. He commands the Nine Mysterious Regions, takes charge of the Five Spirits in the Jade character, summons myriads of riders upon the Path of No Interval; this is also called the Text of Interlaced Descents.

The method’s foremost upper section contains nine talismans, which are those of the Most High Jade Emperor who has not yet manifested within the Nine Voids; binding the essence of nature, issuing from the womb of the Mysterious Mother, refining the pure jade embryo to transform into talismans of the Nine Sovereigns. These are written with a yellow brush, worn facing north, whereby one changes shape and alters appearance, and gains to see the Great Subtlety Sovereign Lord, who rides upon the flying rosy clouds and feathered canopy, sporting in the Mysterious Capital.

The middle section of nine talismans is the solidified qi of the Nine Heavens, binding the natural chapters formed. Passed through the Mysterious Mother of the Nine Mysterious Regions, generating the spiritual text, these are written with a blue brush, worn facing north, whereby one gains to see the Great Subtlety Sovereign Lord, who rides in the void flying, ascending the Nine Heavens.

The lower section of five talismans is the primal state before the Five Sovereigns were divided, wherein the empty and hollow essence is bound within the void, refining the Mysterious Mother of the Nine Mysterious Regions to generate the text. These are to be written with a vermilion brush, worn facing west, and there is a five-coloured spiritual light, riding the void flying, ascending to the Great Clarity.

Men use white patterns, women purple patterns, making the breadth nine cun and the length nine chi, writing according to order. The subsequent text says that the Seven Ancestors fulfill responsibilities, that myriad kalpas will not revert, all as the Most High purple plain pledge text. This means that in accord with the Most High’s will, one having become a Perfected Person, should harmonize and measure the purple plain text; hence its beginning says it should be transmitted to the later sages who attain the Way.
