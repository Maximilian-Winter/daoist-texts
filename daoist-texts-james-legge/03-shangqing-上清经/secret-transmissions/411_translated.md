### Chart of Cultivation and Practice of the Five Births

The Azure Tooth of First Birth is that which the Queen Mother of the West cultivated, transmitted by Master Gu Xi, the Yellow Child Perfected Man of the Great Valley. The Supreme Ultimate Perfected Man sealed one communication on Mount Tai, three transmissions in seven thousand years; there is a mysterious name, the Purple Slip. When one obtains this text, within a hundred years there will be persons who also receive the three transmissions. Cultivating for five years, the Three Corpses are extinguished, the Five Spirits are peacefully established, the Five Emperors converse, and the Three Pure Ones roam at ease.

The Eastern Azure Tooth represents the Original Image of the Blue Heaven; its centre is the Planet of the Year (Jupiter), its flowing essence is the Wood Essence; below is Mount Tai, which governs the Liver palace of man. Its qi is newly born, like spring grass just sprouting; its radiance shines forth, like the beams issuing from the bright sun. Two persons swallow it together, becoming one with the deity.

The Southern Vermilion Tooth represents the Original Image of the Red Heaven; its centre is the Wandering Star (Mars), its flowing essence is the Fire Essence; below is Mount Heng, which governs the Heart palace of man. Its qi is newly born, like red clouds enveloping the white sun; its radiance begins to shine, like black jade reflecting the cinnabar deep pool. Two persons swallow it together, becoming one with the deity.

The Central Yellow Tooth represents the Original Image of the Yellow Heaven; its centre is the Stationary Star, its flowing essence is the Earth Essence; below is Mount Songgao, which governs the Spleen palace of man. Its qi is like yellow gauze wrapping red clouds; its radiance is like purple smoke enveloping the setting sun. Two persons swallow it together, becoming one with the deity.

The Western White Tooth represents the Original Image of the White Heaven; its centre is Venus (the Great White), its flowing essence is the Metal Essence; below is Mount Hua, which governs the Lung palace of man. Its qi is like bright clouds surrounding the bright moon; its radiance is like gems seen in a dark night. Two persons swallow it together, becoming one with the deity.

The Northern Dark Tooth represents the Original Image of the Dark Heaven; its centre is the Constellation of the Dragon (Mercury), its flowing essence is the Water Essence; below is Mount Heng (in the North), which governs the Kidney palace of man. Its qi is like white smoke circling the jade tree; its radiance is like a shooting star rushing through the vast waves. Two persons swallow it together, becoming one with the deity.

For men and women under twelve years, it is known as attainable, but not to be practised. Above twelve years, knowing it and practising it, if there be no secret intercourse, it is called First Birth. Above fifteen years, all is late indeed. The knowledge of late is mostly already impaired; to repair and restore is exceedingly difficult. Though there be no secret intercourse, the knowledge of birth is late; late birth may yet be prolonged, but cannot be called First Birth. If after secret intercourse one knows the Way of Birth, one must first fast and abstain according to the regulations and fixed times; not knowing the method of abstinence, one may not partake of the Scripture of First Birth. Those who receive it do not die; those who obtain it must be born. The born person swallows the five qi together, the five viscera form their blossoms, the five spirits rejoice, the five stars flow and circulate, the five elders descend in spirit, and bear a journey to the five sacred mountains, ascending to a banquet in the five heavens, living long without death, preserving the Perfected Immortal. If the Scripture be damaged or impaired, one cannot obtain the Scripture of First Birth, nor swallow the Azure Tooth qi, nor receive the essences of the five colours; though one practice many methods, one will never be restored. To restore is not yet attainable; whence then can one summon the Way?

Those of like mind, diligently cultivate the five virtues, diligently take the five teeth; day by day without ceasing, they may also practise the five directions. Within no more than five years, their station is raised to Immortal Sage; the Five Emperors send their missions, feathered chariots riding the clouds, welcoming them day and night; at ease and free, their destiny not yet ascended to mystery, their traces not yet sunk into obscurity; they journey and transform in the world, passing in and out without hindrance. Those who slander them suffer their own calamities; those who offend incur their own faults; evil men and wicked demons cannot destroy them; the more they are insulted, the more pure they become; the more concealed, the more bright; their grace and virtue flow abroad; Heaven and men look up to them as their venerable model.
