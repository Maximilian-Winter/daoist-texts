# The Chapter of High and Lofty Jade Palace’s Joy and Sorrow

Title of the Scripture: The Chapter of High and Lofty Jade Palace’s Joy and Sorrow. The author is unknown; it is roughly produced in the period of the Southern and Northern Dynasties, or the Sui and Tang. Within it are contained the words of the Qusu on joy and sorrow and wisdom; it is also seen in the “Verses and Praises of the Many Perfected of the Supreme Clarity.” The base text is from the “Wanli Sequel to the Daoist Canon.”

## The Chapter of High and Lofty Jade Palace’s Joy and Sorrow

I bind my natural breath, to condense and transform the Purple Phoenix City. The high terrace towers beyond the Nine Ridges, crags sharp and formed like flying jade. Illumined it lies beyond the many voids, winding and twisting, revealing the Eight Pure Ones. The purple canopy shines upon the Cloud Palace, its flowing radiance obscuring the Five Spirits. Four directions reach out to the boundless wilds; the eight airs revolve in perfect brightness. Whirling and soaring through the vast firmament, the seven lights turn the celestial canon. Movement comes as if without form; time departs following transformation’s fall. Within the nine enclosures’ intersection, the two images mutually contend. The One Emperor firmly holds the Central Origin; the four principles do not decline the spirit. The South gathers the flying imperial treasures; the North arrays the Broad Cold Court. The Profound Chamber unites the true assemblies; the void-song arises naturally. The Five Emperors command the spirit banners; the demon flags marshal myriad spirits. Demons howl from the void above; the Dao world’s joy is unending. Therefore arise the Qusu words, celebrating the gods rejoicing in great peace. How long shall we agree? Ten thousand kalpas count as one age. Revolving through ninety thousand kalpas, together we journey the Purple Phoenix’s palanquin.

The void births the Purple Phoenix Terrace, the jade towers joining the Great Subtlety. The spirit wind pierces the eight assemblies; the northern window’s gates open wide. Above is the howling songster, ever chanting the passing of decay and decline. At dawn he rides the light to roam; at dusk he attaches to the light to return. The two lights are one body, ever fearing the loss of radiance. The nine breaths do not dwell constantly; heaven and earth stand on the verge of peril. The great kalpa ends in one great tree; the one hundred and sixty rotations return. The mighty spring wells up the Nine Ridges; the great crow soars, hanging in the sky. Ten thousand crawling things drift in the long stream, looking back to the mountains but finding no rest. They wail without end at the boundless verge; can they but grieve the heart of man? The worthy and sages diligently recite the scripture, thus gaining the ride on the light and flight. When the time comes they wait to welcome, gathering at the gates of the nine heavens. The numbers end with the golden horse’s star; ten thousand plagues run rampant. No awakened immortal is seen, but only those who mourn the corpses in sorrow. Alas this ignorant common man’s substance, bearing fate is pain and grief indeed.

Scatter sorrow on the Nine Mysterious Terraces; gather joy, together with the great void. Grasp the contract of the Ten Heavenly Perfected, laughing with the child of the Eastern Sea’s fate. Four directions reach forth the eight assembly airs; mysterious movement is the wind of the Lang Terrace. The eye shines on the Western Flowery Hall; intent is united with the Broad Cold Palace. Beneath the dancing Purple Phoenix, the Nine Ridge peaks lie desolate. The flowing glances reach to the boundless wilderness; looking upward at the kalpa blade’s midst. The clear songs of palace tones harmonize; joy and sorrow follow each other naturally. Two courses harmonize in one contract; reason reverses yet returns alike. Together they rejoice unendingly, holding beginning and holding end again. Drunk on the jade pool’s nectar, looking upwards to drink the flying splendid sovereign. The spirit melon feasts by the river, tasting like the light of sun and moon. The seven luminaries emit fragrant radiance; how can such joy ever be forgotten? The great kalpa has its final movement; the turning meets the two images’ fall. The Dragon Gate severs the Heavenly River; the three and five oppose and contend. The Red Town guards the Eastern Well; the Flowery Canopy hides the Morning Star. The dark light brightens the eight wastes; the turbid airs obscure the sky’s essence. The three officials hasten their command; the five mountains no longer hold spirit. Ten thousand plagues run rampant; the Northern Emperor commands brave demon soldiers. The eight principles net beyond the heavens; only the holy ruler can purify. Thus I bind the natural breath, rugged as the ninefold city. The high view pities the myriad peoples; joy and sorrow arise from this. The profound song scatters spirit’s collar; veiled joy turns into flowing tears. Alas these stubborn common men, stingy with wealth, greedy for lust and fame. Cheerfully they wait for fate’s arrival, heedless of the disaster they embrace. The wise and intelligent come contrary; day and night diligently reciting the scripture. Respecting the void and contemplating the profound, they cross the boundless lifespan. If one can seek the source of the Dao, the eight sections tune the jade name. When the rabbit brings the nine luminaries’ disaster, it will grant you to see great peace.

The jade phoenix thickly weaves the morning; the Purple Terrace shines the jade forest. Flowing light brushes the great mystery; the crags rise over the nine shadows. The purple radiance scatters vermilion clouds; flying smoke pursues each other mutually. The seven treasures vibrate jade branches; spirit beasts run across the cloud ridges. Myriad immortals ride the void chanting; the divine immortals raise wondrous sounds. Above is the high morning master, reverently silent, howling and chanting. The eight assemblies naturally accommodate; the void descends all as orchid and gold. Jade chewing the kalpa dawn, jade wine scatters into the heart. Bright pearls chant the spirit song; the Dharma form harmonizes the clear zither. The jade chapter reaches the Dao’s ancestor; joy and sorrow unravel man’s weariness. Releasing me from endless age, the good joy is how profound! The natural high immortals’ rhyme, how can they be compared to this reverence? Morning plays in the Eastern Flowery Palace; evening roams the Western Flowery Hall. Taking joy in the two Flowery Halls, yet joy does not meet with joy. Only heard is the profound songster’s voice, sorrowful sounds that wound the heavenly child. The mournful echoes flow through the cold court, lamenting the world’s fate exhausted. Heavenly horses leap the nine rivers, the crow mother rides the flying dragon. The profound ford has no bridge; the two breaths are separated and not communicated. Ascending my rugged terrace, I look up at the nine calamities. The turbid airs fill the three spirits; myriad peoples bear the disaster’s balance. The eight domains have no remaining people; great and small mountains collapse. Considering this I know not learning; hearing the scripture as though deaf and foolish. Together relying on fate to be born, suddenly finishing the appointed end. Alas how cruel the disaster’s time, thinking of you wounds my breast.

The Purple Phoenix rides the void forth, rugged the nine mysterious summits. Where breath condenses a shadow appears; when breath disperses the spirit disappears. Floating without bound, the heavenly music suits my delight. How agree with the eight assemblies’ song, matching my lofty immortal company! Grasping the contract of the Ten Heavenly Perfected, feasting on my nine phoenix body. Ascending the jade capital towers above, below playing in the Lang wind state. Feathered riders swift on jade wheels, purple smoke in the void supports. The utmost morning comes and waits for dawn, together rejoicing unending rest. Flowing glances freely change; with one hundred million kalpas a cycle begins. Rejoice my natural collar, disperse my worldly sorrow. Without the profound spirit treasure, who may journey thus with me? Alas within the void’s hollow, joy arises again and sorrow. At dawn setting forth from the Bound Mist Ridge, at dusk observing the Western Hills. No sight of the Nine Spirit Mothers, nor the Northern True Dao companions. Inquire of the great image’s measure; the two breaths suddenly circle the clouds. Nine dragons turn the Eastern Well; heavenly horses start from the Western corner. The Northern Emperor releases heavenly troops; the five mountains’ profound accords. Ten thousand demons are already bound; the five elements have early conspired. The battle disasters spread throughout heaven; myriad peoples have been restrained. Above and below all receive assembly; cleansed and scattered with no lingering. Alas in these five calamities, fate comes with no kin or stranger. High ascending the eight assembly palace, I bind my dark companions. Journeying through the highest learning, the blessed lands mutually support. Abandoning home to seek my Dao, able to cross over this body. Diligent in heart cultivating the supreme scripture, when Dao is accomplished it must be mutual. Leisurely viewing the Phoenix Terrace, is it not joy to roam?

Great joy meets the Central Origin; the Central Origin gathers the joy court. Above are the eight assembly airs, dancing with the purple phoenix born. Golden branches attach to jade roots; seven treasures form flowery bells. Dragons soar beyond the peak ridges; phoenix howls scare the myriad courses. No sight of the wandering guests, only the phoenix clouds arise. Palace tones harmonize with themselves; sounds and echoes naturally complete. The profound song sings wondrous melody; joy and sorrow bind into scripture. I and myself seek each other; who knows the true man’s spirit? Brocade clouds gird the night moon; purple radiance covers flying jade. The three mornings move the great light; seven voids shine the five stars. Spirit banners bear majestic light; flowing smoke veils purple clarity. Claiming to be the West Flowery’s marvel, not as the Purple Phoenix City. Above is the collar-releasing man, one face rejoicing in ten thousand ages. Together rejoicing without end kalpas, thus perceiving heaven and earth collapsing. The spirit movement has its proper limit; numbers end and freedom is profound. Going and coming following the turning, why should sorrow entangle itself? Scatter sorrow beyond the eight wastes; the great image is not crooked truth. Leisurely joy court, who with sorrow befriend? The five calamities are regular assemblies; those they harm have their own cause. Palace tones though discordant, return to reason and balance. Therefore arise the joy and sorrow songs, to cross the awakened Dao body. Bitter practice studies the spirit script; wonderful meaning naturally fresh. But to wear the Qusu chapter, able to cross the sorrowless ford. Riding the void ascending Phoenix Terrace, high view receiving the Tang years. What joy is this joy? Know where sorrow is heard?

The Chapter of High and Lofty Jade Palace’s Joy and Sorrow, the void births the Phoenix Terrace above, the spirit brilliance shines on the five directions, golden sounds float clear through the Ten Heavens, the jade capital’s nine chapters of the highest truth, all cast in gold as slips, written with purple brush, voices joined as one singing profound songs of joy and sorrow. Its words are deep, its subtleties profound and penetrating the abyss; save for those of high and lofty rank, none can fully comprehend its text. There is the golden name “East Flowery,” the jade word “Phoenix Gate,” only thus may one see this writing. Wearing the phoenix breath and the profound hill, commanding demon spirit banners, reciting the joy and sorrow chapter, then the Five Emperors guard the truth, heavenly demons reverently protect, supporting the superior immortals, to receive and welcome the holy sovereign into the Supreme Clarity Palace, roaming the Phoenix Terrace hall.

All who receive this text, on their own fate day, the Tai Sui, and the days of the eight sections, and also on the fifth, fifteenth, and twenty-fifth of each month, bathe and purify and enter the chamber; first facing east recite two chapters of the Blue Emperor to completion, then pay respects to the Jade Perfected; turn south and recite the Red Chapter to completion, then pay respects to the Jade Perfected; turn west and recite the White Emperor Chapter to completion, then pay respects to the Jade Perfected; turn north and recite the Black Emperor Chapter to completion, then pay respects to the Jade Perfected; facing the Tai Sui recite the Yellow Emperor Chapter to completion, then pay respects to the Jade Perfected. When the five directions are all finished, return north to perform nine bows, salute the Jade Morning Sovereign, and swallow breath nine times then stop. Thus offer the five services and five emperor banners in the chamber’s five directions. From the “Supreme Clarity High and Lofty Jade Morning Phoenix Terrace’s Qusu Supreme Scripture.”
