### First Hymn

I bow my head and pay homage to the Heavenly Venerable,  
Burn incense and return to the ten directions.  
Twin lights revolve with tenfold brightness,  
The flying Brahman law-wheel’s framework.  
All the heavens share this celebration,  
Together reins are held over life and death.  

Flowing gold shines forth the Great Nothingness,  
Distant and mysterious is the True King.  
Three cycles ascend the Jade Realm,  
Majestic and dignified to roam the Void.  
In the deep and lofty Great Net above,  
The Golden Origin Hall stands dense and rich.

### Second Hymn

The golden spirit’s wondrous aspect,  
The jade’s elegance naturally communicates.  
Riding the scene of perfect clarity,  
The ten directions all hold golden forms.  
Loftily atop the hundred million heavens,  
Ten thousand paths are all equally joined.  

Scattering flowers are the essence of sun and moon,  
Primordial beginnings celebrate the golden wind.  
Returning through the kalpa of constant sands,  
Ever joyful on the Jade Clarity peaks.  
Twisting incense to greet the Sovereign of the Way,  
Roaming freely within the golden mysteries.

### Third Hymn

Brocade clouds stroke the rising smoke,  
Within lies the Jade Emperor’s court.  
Majestic with seven treasures’ forms,  
Brilliance reflects the Supreme Clarity.  
Wondrous awakening through profound truth,  
Wandering through the flowing golden city.  

The mandate summons the divine heavens to send,  
Drifting and chanting the cavern scriptures.

### Fourth Hymn

The Jade Clarity’s many wonders gather,  
Towering at the edge of the celestial net.  
The Most Exalted Primordial King,  
The venerable among the ten directions.  
Flying blossoms scatter the Great Nothingness,  
A jeweled canopy shades the golden wheel.  

Eight garrisons above the Mysterious Clarity,  
Dense and resplendent shines the golden nothingness.  
Gleaming and radiant is the seven-treasure forest,  
Phoenix songs sound as flying luan sing.  
At left the heavenly treasure youths guard,  
At right attend the Jade True Lord.  

Clear and bright are the twin scenic images,  
Illuminating the golden flower gate.

### Fifth Hymn

The Most Exalted Golden Mysterious Palace,  
Rises high on the Jade Heaven Terrace.  
The Mysterious True rides the void and issues forth,  
Steadily patrolling the void and returning.  
Spiritual cypress and beasts dance together,  
The dharma drum vibrates and heaven comes.  

Ten rare and wondrous radiances flash,  
Mysterious sounds are all in harmony.  
Pure fragrance and rare elegant music,  
Safeguarding and opening the ten thousand years.

### Sixth Hymn

Golden truth’s tenfold wondrous views,  
Rare and subtle enter the formless.  
Lowering command to the golden morning youth,  
Holding reins with the high spirits together.  
Incense and flowers scatter with the wind,  
Mysterious chanting is the natural sound.  

Seated in the carriage summon the heavenly balance,  
Flying truth plays the jade canopy.  
Bright and clear within the great light,  
The ten sages all assemble together.

### Seventh Hymn

Profound, silent is the great vehicle’s功功功,  
The ten directions’ heavenly sovereign.  
The morrow’s dharma wheels revolve,  
The true form shines resplendent.  
Six degrees, kalpa-like peaks,  
Adorned with the golden spirit’s emblem.  

Auspicious responses arise without number,  
Flowing forth the many radiant images of yang.  
Seven treasures naturally arise,  
Palaces govern the vast void.  
All heavens rejoice together,  
Banners and blossoms scatter pure fragrance.

### Eighth Hymn

The Great Way has no boundary or limit,  
Its universal salvation is the bridge and ford.  
The Heavenly Venerable descends the scene,  
Ten flowers cluster to form a neighbourhood.  
The Most True Great Holy Assembly,  
Scattering blossoms opens the three benefits.  

Bowing and looking, the law’s admonitions bear fruit,  
Long serving as the Jade Emperor’s kin.  
Constantly dining on jade smoke and mist,  
Governing the essence without dust.  
Form is received and long endures in appearance,  
The Way’s conduct naturally renews.  

Seated to summon the celestial court,  
Eternity cuts off the cause of cold.

### Ninth Hymn

Far, far is the Jade Mysterious Capital,  
Lofty is the Golden Spirit’s mansion.  
Void Emperor’s dragon smoke banners,  
Eight assemblies secure the true origin.  
Supporting and raising the Nine Heavens’ Kings,  
Glancing back at the golden immortal ancestors.  

Carefree is the mysterious scene’s retreat,  
Transcendence all attain liberation.  
Countenance wondrous, strange and good,  
Chanting and singing flying mysterious steps.  
If not the Jade Emperor’s comrades,  
How could they share this path?

Ascending the scene with jade chariots,  
In unison reciting the long-preserved memorial.  
Golden wings patrol the void,  
Hand holding a jade radiant lotus.  
Suddenly releasing the three nets,  
Preserving the kalpa’s allotted years.  

Golden youths strike the jade chime,  
Jade bells sound through the heavens.  
Gathering the great myriad multitudes,  
Jade void scatters dragon smoke.  
Flying blossoms roam the ten directions,  
Joyful before the Heavenly Venerable.  

Wondrous without without wondrous,  
Entering the mirror, wondrousness is ever profound.

Void origin is utmost truth,  
Mysterious void is natural.  
Clear and pure is the misty cave,  
Condensing the pure golden truth.  
Primordial high talisman commands,  
Preserving heaven’s long existence.  

Primordial form, the threefold Way,  
Illumination profoundly clear.  
Flowing and pouring through heaven and earth,  
The three scenes shine together.

Supporting and winging my body.  

Numerous spiritual descents,  
Majestic light flows and shines.  
Distant and mysterious entering the profound,  
Together ascending the Jade Clarity.

Luxuriant and elegant is the Most Exalted Palace,  
The highest heavenly treasure court.  
Mysterious and peerless are the twins,  
Light shines gloriously through the heavens.  

My body is born of seven treasures,  
Brahman scenes enter the formless.  
Mysterious and wondrous, utmost true virtue,  
Flying to heaven offering the green canopy.  

Liberated from seven generations of trials,  
The Jade Emperor comes to welcome.  
Bright wheel shines the ten directions’ scene,  
Carefree ascending the Jade Clarity.

Burning incense, the cave is perfumed,  
Touched by the assembly’s Most True.

The five sufferings share joy.  
Golden morning youths,

Eight scenes and jade chariots,  
Escort me to the morning.  
Golden youths and mysterious maidens,  
Scatter blossoms, remove confusion.  
Blessings flow from the Imperial Lord,  
The heavens all protect their words.  

Lofty and majestic is the Jade Clarity,

Pay morning homage to the Heavenly Venerable.

Carefree ascending the Supreme Capital.

Descending in form to the ten directions.  
Transcending and translucent is the cave of clarity,  
Purple void intermingles and reflects.

Speeding their bodies to the Jade Court.
