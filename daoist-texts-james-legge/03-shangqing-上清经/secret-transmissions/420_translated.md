## The Hymns of the Assembly of Immortals in Praise of the Sacred Manifestation

### The Hymn of Azure Splendour Saving from Suffering

#### Early Morning Court

The Celestial Venerable utters a vow with great compassion,  
To save the suffering in myriad quarters and transform causes to goodness.  
The Five Sacred Mountains and Four Offices all receive the mandate,  
The Northern Prefecture of Fengdu altogether halts punishment.  

True talismans are issued, all receiving pardon;  
Boy attendants proclaim and deliver salvation to sinners.  
The Primordial Spirit manifests the true wondrous aspect,  
Delivering men without limit, the Way thereby fulfilled.

#### Midday Court

The Celestial Venerable swears to save all living beings,  
Preaching the Dharma adorned, seated in the Precious Grove.  
The Lion with Nine Heads displays auspicious signs,  
Its radiance of wisdom illumines the dark and secret places.  

Mountains of knives and trees of swords are all broken and crushed;  
Fire obscurations, winds, and thunder cease altogether.  
Infinite great compassion comes to rescue and deliver,  
All the hells of Fengdu are reverently surveyed and heard.

#### Evening Court

The Celestial Venerable’s wisdom-power rescues the contained spirits,  
Seeking the cries of suffering to break the iron city.  
The vast aid of the Primordial Border saves according to vows,  
Bright light universally shines to reach the shadowy shoulders.  

The fan of wisdom disperses the fiery smoke;  
The rain of Dharma moistens at the time, causing decay and growth.  
Infinite mercy and compassion all bring salvation,  
Lost souls all obtain the countenance of the Compassionate Venerable.

## The Farewell of Lady Taizhen to Master Ma Mingsheng

Temporarily dwelling within the city walls,  
The mandate directs the carriage towards Mount Dai.  
I look up to the palace of the Great Pure,  
Cloudy towers rise lofty and precipitous.  

In the void dwell true beings,  
Coming and going with manifold splendours.  
Refining form to preserve the natural,  
Looking up and down drawing from the Great Harmony.  

Every morning the Nine Heavenly Kings assemble,  
In the evening returning to the Western Splendour.  
Refined essence may soar and ascend,  
Breathing in and out nurturing the blue teeth.  

The supreme medicine is not of metal or stone,  
The wind naturally gives rise to song.  
Ascending above the bright firmament,  
Feathered garments dance gracefully.  

The Five Mountains are not concubines,  
The Mysterious Capital is my home.  
Looking down upon the sons of glory and contention,  
Firm as frogs and toads they are.  

Casting a glance towards the dusty and turbid midst,  
Worries and troubles ensnare one another.  
If one has not awakened to the wondrous meaning,  
What concern has he with carving and polishing?  

Misfortune arises from the leakage of the Way,  
Careful secrecy, many blessings arrive.

In former times at the Palace of Kunling,  
We discoursed together on the prolonging of life.  
Though golden elixir can extend far,  
It is not comparable to the Immortal of Great Harmony.  

Looking up to ascend the Mysterious Immortal Terrace,  
Imagining the recitation of the Spirit People.  
Suddenly meeting the King of Fusang,  
The nine ancient immortals of the capital indeed.  

Riding the purple horned dragon carriage,  
The sacred countenance how fresh it is!  
Opening for me the path of lengthened steps,  
Inviting me to the ferry of nature.  

Teaching me the art of great flight,  
Bestowing the Jade Fetus treatise.  
Jade ointments congeal the profound breath,  
The pure maiden unfolds for me its display.  

Bending down to draw the essence of the jade phoenix,  
Looking up to ascend the three heavens.  
The net of clouds supports your steps,  
The Five Mountains can be temporarily circled.  

The Mysterious Capital is not far,  
Penglai lies at your feet.  
Passing on and receiving mutual love,  
Forming friendships as heavenly beings.  

If you replace the punishment,  
Misfortune surely will not come to the wise and the foolish.  
If secret, you enjoy without overturn;  
If leaked, body and life will be overturned.

## The Farewell of Yang Zhenren to Registrar Xu

Suddenly riding forth to roam the Eight Emptinesses,  
Returning to feast in the Eastern Splendour chamber.  
Mother A extends an invitation to the Pavilion of the High Seat,  
With loud shouts treading on the spiritual wind.  

I have matters yet to attend to,  
Therefore I cross the Canglang River.  
Soaring and leaping with the clouded carriage,  
Floating and observing the rosy clouds above the sky.  

The celestial canopy dances in all directions,  
The purple canopy supports the sacred square.  
Scarlet smoke entwines the banners,  
Feathered robes fan the fragrant breeze.  

Thunder roars like wild beasts,  
Lightning sings and rouses the mysterious dragon.  
Harmonious music resounds in the Kun Court,  
Golden bells chant and strike the divine chime.  

Gathering herbs of Canglang Ah,  
Plucking flowers of the Eight Pure Peaks.  
Scarlet countenance grows daily anew,  
The calamity gone, the infant remains.  

Nurturing form in quiet East Ridge,  
The Seven Spirits communicate among themselves.  
Dust and cares bring sorrow,  
Falling to me, the white-haired elder.  

Long lament for the distant past,  
Regret for not retreating early.  
Halting the carriage to watch the moving moon,  
Turning the wheel, returning to Canglang.  

At last I see such a person roam,  
Suddenly thinking how to attain peace.  
Good cause awaits youthful spring,  
To express the forgotten heart within.  

Controlling the light floating purple smoke,  
Eight views observe the Fen River flow.  
Feathered youths hold jade wine,  
Jade blossoms send off the jade essence.  

We agree to meet at the White Water shore,  
Raising my withered pearl.

## The Eastern Hall Glows with Rosy Clouds

The purple made floats the crimson dawn,  
Twin virtues grasp the Way’s sect,  
To serve as guards of the True Elders' guard.  

The Eight Platforms may be seen,  
Looking northward one sees the flying nothingness.  
Clear and pure, viewed among clouds,  
Far and slight treading on shifting light.  

Breathing in and out the cave’s mountain essence,  
Concealing the brilliance in the Eastern Hills.  
Long abiding in human affairs,  
The day also knows no idle leisure.  

How unlike the easy yielding substance,  
Returning to the childlike countenance within.

---

## Morning Palace of the Great Rosy Clouds

The jade chamber rises into the clear sky,  
Brief hymns of the three wondrous sights,  
Floating scenes fly beyond the dark.  

Red blossoms exist in the empty sky,  
Golden rays nurture the pure essence.  
The eight winds drum the brocade robe,  
Green trees shine with the four spirits.  

The floral canopy shades the orchid’s radiance,  
Purple reins spur the green carriage.  
Binding truth to communicate divine fellowship,  
Touching similars, leading the heavenly sincerity.  

Why should the outward form be affected?  
One must behold the precious jade and gem.

---

## The Three Scenes, Lofty and Mysterious

The sky reflects the bright eight directions,  
Red clouds float over the high palace,  
At ease and wandering with the spiritual wind.  

Beating wings ride the white gale,  
Looking up at the jade terrace within.  
Green canopy enters the harmonious morning,  
Blue carriage darts together in empty space.  

Bowing to the Emperor of the Eastern Grove,  
Attending the Court of the Great Void Sovereign.  
Jade attendants open the phoenix brain,  
Howling in joy they fly the medicinal brew.  

Cloud chimes circle the curved bed,  
A thousand sounds how sonorous.  
Brocade banners summon fierce beasts,  
Splendid flags rise and fall.  

The fragrant mother bends her waist to sing,  
Purple smoke arrays the beams and rafters.  
Gathering reins atop the High Palace,  
Unbinding the carriage in the fair ladies’ chamber.

In former days, when destiny had not yet appeared,  
The spiritual transformations followed the breath and soared.  
My mind is faint, sensing the mysterious boundary,  
Years follow the accumulated longevity.  

The form’s defilement and foul flavour,  
Movement and stillness lose the Canglang.  
My friends are truly not so,  
Glory and disgrace yesterday already forgotten.

## Scarlet Scenes Float in the Mysterious Morning

The purple pavilion rides the smoky journey,  
Looking up beyond the Green Pavilion,  
Looking down upon the Vermilion Fire City.  

Eastern rosy clouds open broad radiance,  
Spiritual light shines upon the Seven Spirits.  
Obscuring shadows float over three candles,  
Flowing freely together dark and deep.  

Wind weaves through the empty vastness,  
Fragrant sounds strike the rhythmic beats.  
Hands carry the Weaver Girl’s dance,  
Together with the gourd courtyard.  

Turning left the blue feather banner,  
Floral canopy bends with the clouds.  
Feasting and resting nine times on the surface,  
Right and wrong do not engage me.

Drawing up truth to dwell in Great Tranquillity,  
Golden form daily grows infantile.  
How unlike the defilement within,  
Mournful, miserable, and without joy.

Four banners shine bright in the sky,  
Scarlet pavilion flies to the spirit mound.  
Jade canopy corresponds to the Seven Scenes,  
Beating wings float above the sky.

Nine sounds resound in the purple sky,  
Jade bowls echo through the Great Void.  
Feasting and chanting in the Three Morning Palaces,  
Singing and howling call me to the fields.

Unconscious, longevity has come,  
How can one know the flow of the Two Scenes?  
Fair ladies though forgetful,  
Have not yet cast aside a hundred worries.

The long forest truly can be still,  
Among the cliffs there is much joy.

## Northern Ascent to the Mysterious True Palace

Joining hands to form the high net,  
Fragrant smoke disperses the Eight Scenes,  
Mysterious winds beat the crimson waves.

Looking up beyond the Lang Garden ferry,  
Looking down upon the Sky Hill and pass.  
Jade pipes play above the clouds,  
Phoenix cries stir the Nine Distant Places.  

Riding the breath, floating in the Great Void,  
Why should one tread the mountain passes?  
Golden scepters command winged spirits,  
Mobilizing troops to break ten thousand demons.

Together drawing up the Two Morning Radiances,  
A thousand springs just budding teeth.  
Losing truth, entering the competing chamber,  
Unable to understand what to do.

Looking up at the Great Rosy Cloud Palace,  
Golden pavilions shine with purple clarity.  
Floral chambers reflect the Great Primordial,  
Four pavilions all of vermilion and jade.

Throwing wheels at the empty ferry,  
Gathering reins dance the green carriage.  
Jade blossoms fly beneath the cloud canopy,  
Western consorts move brocade banners.

Suddenly from the dusty and turbid brink,  
At once arriving at the fair ladies’ court.  
Overnight sensing the true descent,  
What is summoned is already in the dark.

Riding the wind playing the morning sky,  
Together reveling in the cinnabar forest urn.  
Dukes and marquises but slight and faint,  
How can they know the spirit of the true man?

At dawn drawing up the crimson clouds,  
Gathering the breath to roam above the sky.  
Turning the carriage treading winding waves,  
Here at last seeing the world’s cares.

Words and meanings arise in splendour,  
Not dispersing the Three Elegant Ants.  
How better to patrol the Mysterious Village,  
Touching the bowls for your delight.

Your heart knows no bounds,  
I wish for having without wanting.

## Drawing Reins to Ascend the Morning Sky

Traveling and feasting at the Canglang official’s place,  
Colourful clouds encircle the red dawn,  
Sacred aura disperses into the void.

The Supreme True chants in the jade chamber,  
High immortal sings in the jade chamber.  
Nine phoenixes sing the scarlet flutes,  
Empty segments clash the feathered bells.

Resting together in the golden court,  
Forming my companions in the dark.  
Together drawing up the jade nectar ferry,  
Suddenly already an infant.

How can one halt on the road,  
Disease and calamity rise day by day?

Morning roams the Great Primordial Palace,  
Controlling the carriage to observe the Jade River.  
Evening feasts in the lofty hall,  
Morning gathers the perfect radiance flowers.

Plucking bowls at the Northern Cold Terrace,  
Seven spirits shine with purple cloud.  
Crowded high immortals arise,  
Confused in the dust’s net.

Lingering within the noisy mist,  
Calamities and burdens should not be many.

Riding the breath galloping the cloud carriage,  
Morning ascends the Great Calm Hill.  
Crimson ferry joins the hills with shaking,  
Clear waves beat the deep currents.

Walking the sky observing the Nine Latitudes,  
The Eight Networks all have been traveled.  
Briefly feasting the Three Golden Elegants,  
Coming to see the companions of established purpose.

Diligent and remiss do not conceal each other,  
Therefore accumulating a hundred worries.

Crossing the waves, surpassing Canglang,  
Suddenly creating the Golden Mountain.  
Looking around all day long to roam,  
Rarely meeting the cloud-dweller.

Purple pavilions build above the void,  
Mysterious halls piercing the utmost gale.  
Jade and brilliant adorn the sacred garden,  
Floral growth forms jade and precious stones.

Riding the carriage to Canglang ferry,  
Eight winds stir the cloud’s melody.  
Spreading feathers fanning the northern shade,  
Grasping the scepter blowing the golden flute.

Phoenix notes harmonize the thousand chimes,  
Western youths sing the morning court.  
Heart wide open beyond emptiness,  
Spirit robe how clear and vast.

Turning and dancing at the Great Void Ridge,  
Six energies operate the deep and dark.  
How can my path be sought,  
So that you never decay?

Mysterious waves shake the vast tides,  
Great ferries beat the myriad currents.  
Riding the radiance, looking upon the Six Voids,  
Longing to travel with the fair ladies.

Wondrous song answers not to me,  
Clear sounds who could cast to?  
In clouds riding the jade wheel,  
Why rush amid the dust?

Pine [unknown character] grows on the mysterious ridge,  
Dense as the cold forest’s wildness.  
Abundant blossoms flourish with ice,  
Not fearing the white snow.

In the chaotic world, dark heavy peaks,  
The wandering one’s path is always pure.  
Flying this free rein wheel,  
Casting that far off human track.

Dukes and marquises come and go,  
Why cannot they be cut off?

## Pure Contention Wishes for the Eastern Mountain

Shading radiance to dwell in the spirit cave,  
Silent and peaceful in the empty courtyard,  
Obscuring the dense blue forest.

Round brightness reflects the Southern Pavilion,  
Scarlet winds fan the secluded chamber.  
Bowing beneath the idle chamber,  
We agree to open the wondrous arts.

Clear and distant thoughts of mystery,  
Desolate, the spirit’s heart is at ease.

Releasing heart through the empty ferry,  
Refining reins urging the scarlet carriage.  
Fair ladies, why do you delay?  
When will the first virtue be fulfilled?

Parables surely may be used,  
Not using them is without feeling.  
How to obtain the traces of sudden flight,  
Seeking this mid-air spirit?

Subtle sounds surely have meaning,  
One must use them cautiously and not lightly.  
Matters respond to spirit occasions,  
Protecting you to see great peace.

## Drawing Reins Descend to Canglang

Leaping over the Blue Sea ferry,  
Crimson smoke disturbs the sun,  
Feathered canopy tilts the nine heavens.

Cloud car floats in the empty together,  
Suddenly at Canglang’s midst.  
Coming to seek true friends,  
Together accompanying the Emperor’s morning.

Jade children harmonize bright virtue,  
Heads raised to summon jade worthies.  
Looking down on the Eight River Palaces,  
Resting atop the rare forest summit.

Rinsing this purple jade essence,  
Only then knowing the bitterness of the foul path.  
Where will the fair ladies be?  
Diligence is needed to gain intimacy.

Crimson Pavilion arrays the broad sky,  
Spreading cinnabar, ascending the radiant chamber.  
Purple flags shake the clouds and mist,  
Feathered morning dances the eight winds.

Stopping the canopy to raise the blue creek,  
Gathering blossoms on the moon-bearing peak.  
Chewing the three spiritual flowers,  
Breathing in and out the nine divine rays.

Longevity without end or limit,  
Cooperating with the sun to accumulate infancy.  
Joining sleeves in the clear true hall,  
Looking up hoping for the Supreme Sovereign.

Northern Jun sings the feathered men,  
Jade mysteries shining the worthy multitudes.  
Sound ends. How can the wave and vast sky,  
Loss and gain be my bell?

Raising the neck within the noisy court,  
Opening the heart to judge the turbid rush.  
Accustomed to the domain of honour and disgrace,  
Rarely treading the rare forest palace.

One quietness is enough suffering,  
Try to depart and see Canglang.

## The World’s Treasures Fragrance Intermingled

The Way’s sect meets in the Mysterious Firmament,  
Shaking robes to seek the true fields,  
Returning carriage to the dust and wind border.

Good virtue shines in the mysterious light,  
Outstanding gathered floral splendour.  
Secret words repay blessings,  
Tranquillity and sincerity still truly precious.

Always the Two Images comply,  
Joining hands bearing the robes.  
Why amid human affairs,  
Day by day do troubles arise?

Have heart to promise the axe-bearer,  
Saying one shall gather the five mushrooms.  
Mushroom grass need not be obtained,  
You also cannot come.

When you come you will surely obtain,  
Mushroom grass and your food.

## The Scripture of Great Ultimate True Man’s Wisdom

Learning immortality detaches from fragrant thoughts,  
Thought upon thought mutually accumulates.  
Departing and coming disorder my spirit,  
Spirit restless, no place untouched.

Extinguish thoughts and rest in vacancy,  
Desolate and entering empty stillness.  
Please the scripture as if hungry and thirsty,  
Hold the resolve like metal and stone.

Protect the child to fly the mysterious path,  
Five spirits cross the talisman registers.

Aid me in the six degrees of practice,  
Therefore able to break the three nets.  
Pure fasting honors the Great Primordial,  
Breathing in and out nurtures the cloud teeth.

At ease inside the Golden Palace,  
The Jade Capital is my home.  
Naturally born the seven treasures,  
Everyone sits on lotus flowers.

Looking up chewing Mysterious Capital K,  
Looking down holding the empty void reed.  
Countenance shines like ten suns,  
How to calculate many kalpas?

Dharma drums gather the heavenly immortals,  
Wailing bells summon the great demons.

Sacred wind fans the fragrant flowers,  
Brightly opening the profuse robes.  
Great Truth caresses clouds proudly,  
Assembly of immortals play the spiritual zither.

Elegant songs ascend above the three heavens,  
Scattering wisdom in the jade flower forest.  
Seven ancestors ascend the blessing hall,  
From here they step the mysterious sound.

In former lives virtues were insufficient,  
This scripture is far and hard to find.  
Belief in the Way’s feeling is not exhausted,  
Seeking to fly only sinks again.

The Supreme One’s non-action Way,  
Expands within the prophetic heart.

Learning the Way through cinnabar faith,  
Serving the Master as if close kin.  
Bowing to the light in clear emptiness,  
Diligently following daily renewal.

All men have not yet attained deliverance,  
Never will deliver my own person.  
Great vows have heavy recompense,  
Profound virtue is altogether trustworthy.

Yin and evil crimes run deep,  
Facing the future like a revolving wheel.

Learning the Way is exceedingly bitter,  
Morning and evening building fields of blessing.  
Planting virtue is like planting trees,  
Roots deep and fruit also abundant.

If you can delight in mystery and stillness,  
You shall float and ascend to the pure heavens.  
Cultivating this non-action Way,  
One must associate with goodness.

The Supreme One promotes the highest Way,  
Scriptural writings of wisdom’s chapter.  
Removing suffering through great talent,  
Surpassing the mundane to obtain the true.

Sacred form is wonder of the world,  
Shining like a lotus in the abyss.

Men act each with their root,  
All arising from past life merit.  
Establish virtue, strive in timely fashion,  
Vows are made and none do not follow.

Good and evil both await response,  
Relying on principle is hard to exhaust.  
Wise men serve the Law’s words,  
The Way and virtue lie in forgetting both.

This is great wisdom,  
On high is the Great Ultimate Lord.  
A precious canopy joins the jade carriage,  
Mandate to ride controlling the nine dragons.

Golden splendour lifts the cave scripture,  
Holding incense attended by immortal youths.  
Howling and singing through the Mysterious Capital,  
Striking jade knocking the jade bell.

## The True Record of Wu Zi

Unworthy is Wu Zi, knowing destiny and trusting the true,  
Aiming at the mysterious and simple, heart delighted in pure poverty.  
Traversing and experiencing myriad mountains,  
Sole and lone I stand.  

Learning not yet clear on the Way,  
Form only preserving the spirit.  
Mountains and waters are home,  
Form and shadow are neighbors.  

Wearing patched robes and grass belt,  
Deer crowned, gauze kerchief.  
Feeding on pine and drinking springs,  
Passing Sichuan and crossing Qin.  

The Great Way is dim and obscure,  
Who is my Master?  
Looking down upon the world,  
Thinking of the exalted guests.  

Mine is endless sincerity,  
No phantom but close.

All day idling in the grass hut,  
Refreshing breezes constantly come and go.  
Ears untouched by worldly affairs,  
Heart having amusement in clouds and leisure.

Facing wine only thinking of the moon,  
Eating pine not weary of the mountain.  
At times chanting the inner scene,  
Naturally fitting to keep infantile appearance.

This life and this thing shall be my livelihood,  
White stones and green pines are my home.

Facing the moon reclining on clouds like a wild deer,  
At times buying wine drunk on mist and rosy clouds.

Silent and solitary roaming,  
Sole and alone I stand.  
Drinking fallen dew of magnolia,  
Wearing fallen feathers of the crow.

Not seeking profit in the human world,  
Renouncing fame throughout the empire.  
This is the mountain-dwelling Wayfarer.

After writing, shaking robes and arranging staff,  
None know where I have gone.

## Farewell from Immortal to Bai Yongnian

In the clear autumn no affairs,  
Riding mist issuing forth to distant heavens.  
Leaning on the woodcutter’s words,  
Agreeing to meet Bai Yongnian.

## Li Gongzuo’s Immortal Servant Poem

I have a pearl within my garment,  
Not caring for dust upon the robe.  
I have the principle of longevity,  
Not weary of having this living body.  

In the Southern Divine Immortal Cave,  
I shall merge with its truth.  
Not caring for market and city ties,  
Coming to save the world’s people.  

Su Zi’s traces have already passed,  
Zhuan Meng’s affairs are close.  
Do not speak of the East Sea changing,  
Heaven and earth have eternal spring.

## Farewell Words of Ju Haoran to Leihun

When traveling, clouds become companions,  
When sitting, wine is the mate.  
The belly is filled with non-transformation,  
Robes patched with clouds and rosy clouds.  

Zhou’s cruelty and Yao’s benevolence,  
Alas, both are decayed and rotten.

The boat needs no false support,  
Free and far like a duckweed raft.  
Morning floating in the sun’s radiance,  
Evening shading beneath the moon’s light.  

Man busy in works and achievements,  
Decayed bones become dust and sand.  

To drink Ju’s wine,  
And again ascend Ju’s boat,  
Thus obtaining a pure spirit body,  
Surpassing the distant and vast without care.

## The Spirit Sound Hymn

This sound is not a valley echo,  
My heart knows it is a spirit immortal.  
Never leaving the ear’s fold,  
High and low like the autumn cicada.  

Entering night the sound is loud,  
In daytime the sound is faint.  
The spirit repels all evil,  
With me it forms a majestic wind.  

Wondrous sounds have no fixed time,  
Day and night continually revolve.  
How is it a coincidence?  
The Upper Realm sends special envoys.

How to discern spirit responses?  
Matters must have a medium.  
Since the spirit sound descended,  
It is as if a true man has come.

Keeping thoughts always in the heart,  
Turning round without ceasing sound.  
Pity the clear and cool night,  
Quietly listen to the autumn cicada’s chant.

## The Immortals’ Words on the Void Path

Floating and drifting upwards the cloud path,  
Dimly entering the long firmament.  
Star palaces recede daily,  
Time and kalpas are distant and remote.

Looking up the virtue of golden countenance hides,  
Leaning thought waits upon the spirit gale.  
Wishing to obtain the reflected rosy feathers,  
Burning incense, bowing in the morning.

## The Mysterious Wind Turns the Flying Canopy

Purple aura overflows the immortal chariot,  
Floating in the void needing no reins.  
Suddenly rising to the empty void.

Lingering and lamenting the lower world,  
Looking back with mercy on the multitude.  
The three origins of true transformation complete,  
Suddenly entering the Great Void.

Myriad energies float above the void,  
Thousand lights join the Supreme Subtle.  
Among the firmament viewing the floral canopy,  
Heaviness of emptiness gazes upon rosy robes.

True ceremony enters the cloud path,  
Round brightness chases the wind’s flight.  
Wishing to attain the Three Origins assembly,  
Golden countenance rides the movement to return.

Auspicious radiance soars with purple aura,  
Sky path wanders the cinnabar heaven.  
Banners raise and fragrant winds whirl,  
The canopy moves, transcending floating smoke.

The Way within still is the Way,  
The mystery within yet mystery again.  
True light knows no bounds,  
The Great Way is indeed without form.

The Dharma wheel constantly spins,  
Rare sounds cannot be heard.  
In empty leisure awaiting the Three Treasures,  
In the void hearing the cave scripture.

Seven transformations the roaming soul returns,  
Myriad energies settle at the declining age.

Fragrant winds flutter the feather canopy,  
Roaming energies turn the whirlwind chariot,  
Clear and cold ascending the cloud path,  
Profoundly entering the long void.

Looking with mercy on the dust-stained sons,  
Conforming to the times unfolding the spirit writings.  
Wondrous fruition matches today,  
A dark pact, the natural tally.

## The Great Lord Qingtong Often Chants

To plant the root of extinction and deliverance,  
One must uproot the tree of birth and death.  
Musing deeply, falling to the Nine Springs,  
Only sitting to pity the form and frame.

## Lady of Southern Mountain Composes with Xu Changshi

The spirit valley’s graceful waves coil,  
Hiding the body resting in the rocky capital.  
Donning rough garments evenly embroidered with dragons,  
Wearing white belts matching jade and humming.

The form coils in the remote spaciousness,  
Casting the spirit in the Great Rosy Courtyard.  
On high are worthy steps,  
In the void is the true voice.

Looking up my crooked morning flight,  
Facing this green pavilion carriage.  
Looking down on the Eight Degrees within,  
Sighing at the dust and wind entanglement.

Free from the waves of release,  
Ascending this dim and slight body.  
Worries end, the three ferries exhausted,  
Galloping swiftly cutting your years.

---

## Lady of Southern Mountain Composes

Beyond the mysterious and wondrous phenomena,  
Harmonious sounds mutually invite.  
Cloud writings dense with purple morning,  
Orchid winds fan the green carriage.

The Supreme True feasts on the jade terrace,  
Lofty as models among earth immortals.  
What is expected is noble and far surpassing,  
Therefore able to be outstanding and eminent.

Playing with those eight pure feathers,  
The Way is formed at the beginning of the sixth great expanse.  
How can human affairs be anticipated?  
Causing your form and breath to dissipate.
