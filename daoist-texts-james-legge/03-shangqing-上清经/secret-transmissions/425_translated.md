"A hundred times refined divine metal, nine inches in perfect roundness;  
With the protection of birds and beastsâ€™ wings,  
The seven luminaries communicate with the spirit;  
The mirror embraces Heaven and Earth,  
Its majesty subdues demons and spirits,  
An immortal ornament of famous mountains,  
It hastens the wheel of the Supreme Clarity."
