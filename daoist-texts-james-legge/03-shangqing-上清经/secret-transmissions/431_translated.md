The Supreme Emperor's Golden Tiger Talisman Register

Rank of the Jade Clarity Division, First Grade

In the year of such and such, the month of the Tai Sui, on the day of the Zi hour, at such and such a prefecture, district, county, village, the male or female person born named so and so, aged so many years, born on such month, day, and hour, now bearing the certificate and petitioning to the Master of the Three Caverns, Master so and so, to receive the "Supreme Emperor's Golden Tiger Talisman Register." After receiving and wearing it, according to the regulations perform the observances, and do not lightly divulge or defile the true texts. Should one once transgress, one shall suffer examination and punishment, with no pardon through ten thousand kalpas. If practiced according to the law, life and death alike shall become immortal, just as pledged by the regulations and decrees.

The Golden Tiger Jade Essence True Talisman of the Supreme Emperor of the Great Microcosm Heaven is the inner sound of the Supreme Origin’s Upper Scene Natural Golden Seal. It serves to command the Golden Immortals, to seal mountains and summon spirits, to awe and govern the six heavens, and to behead ten thousand demons. The Supreme One constantly deploys the Four Spirits and the Six Jiajia, numbering seven hundred thousand, to guard the talisman in the Great Microcosm Jade Palace. He who wears this talisman commands the heavens and earth with power, rebukes spirits, reins the scenic dragons, and holds office among the exalted immortals. When the jade sounds resound, then the jade splendour stands by, the golden true guards, a thousand Zoroastrians tremble with fear, ten thousand ghosts vanish, nine demons gather heads, the six heavens collapse, the Way is wondrously true, the spirit accrues five spirits; on the left whistles the mysterious youth, on the right seizes the golden morning. Great indeed is the precious text, the emperor’s power and truth; it is not merely to ward off poison, repel tests, and extinguish Zoroastrianism, but to seek the marvels of immortality and obtain the true heading. Twenty-seven jade maidens attend, overseeing the body of the scripture bearer. The bearer reveres the talisman and regulations, ascending to the Three Pure Ones’ palace. Should one disrespect or transmit to unworthy persons, the body shall enter wind and fire and be eternally unpardoned. The talisman is inscribed in cinnabar on white plain silk and worn upon the head. Furthermore, orpiment and green bands are placed in the middle of the waist on the right side. All according to the Supreme Pledge Regulations.

Within the volume, talismans are all inscribed in cinnabar.

The Supreme Origin Upper Scene Golden Elixir True Talisman, a mighty and divine internal blessing, summons divine troops to slay evil spirits. When entering a room, burn incense, click the teeth thirty-six times, sit or lie at will, then pronounce the blessing:

Repel the Poison King of Heaven, shake the banner of the Shiluo, the Eight Immortals wield the halberd, the Emperor’s Five Spirits, the Great Mystery descends, the Seven Mornings guard the courtyard, the Yellow True Shining Talisman, shining and casting fire bells, the divine tiger strikes fiercely, poison blades disorderly display, purple motifs of the ceremonial, four leaps singing upwards, the four heavens resound, able to know ghost names, external traverse of mysterious Qi, internal guard of the master’s troops, left commands, right surveys, wind strikes, fire attacks, shouting to behead ten thousand Zoroastrians, crushing beheading a thousand spirits, golden truth shakes its power, nine demons capture forms, northern Feng strikes down, all destroyed are overturned. I wear the true talisman, command ten thousand spirits, the Three Origins notify truth, mysterious union of imperial sincerity, the Great Microcosm Supreme Emperor, ascending to the Three Pure Ones.

The method of the Supreme Origin Upper Scene Mighty Divine Internal Blessing is a forbidden scripture of the Supreme Clarity. The Poison King of Heaven is the internal name of the six great heavenly demons. The shaking of the Shiluo banner is a euphemism for the northern emperor demon king. The four heavens resound refers to the soul names of the northern Feng ghost apparitions. Those who know the names of the three ghosts cause a thousand Zoroastrians to flee and ten thousand ghosts to hide forms; nine demons cannot dare to move or test, a hundred evils cannot harm. Whether in mountain forests alone or among ghosts and spirits of temples and mansions, one may act according to command without the need to burn incense or enter rooms. Yet when fasting and entering rooms, holding morning and evening banquets for the Eight Origins, controlling demons and summoning spirits, driving and commanding divine truths, then wear the talisman and act accordingly.

The Supreme Divine Tiger Talisman

The Supreme Emperor of the Great Microcosm Heaven commands the Upper Minister Qing Tong Jun and the Western City Queen Mother, saying: "The 'Supreme Clarity Wisdom Text for Dispelling Demons and True Scripture' is the jade chapter of the Supreme Ultimate, the exalted true formula, the divine tiger true talisman, the treasured seal of the Nine Heavens Supreme Truth. Wisdom can expel filth, dispel demons can bind evil, the true talisman can control demons and destroy Zoroastrianism. The jade tablet is of purple name; those who cultivate according to the highest method will not be ridden by the multitude of Zoroastrians nor tested by ten thousand demons. It may be said that ten thousand harms cannot afflict it; this is the spirit power of the divine tiger and the wondrous use of the true scripture. Now I entrust it to you, to transmit to later disciples who should become true persons. They shall follow the Supreme Truth’s regulations, allowed three transmissions within seven hundred years. It must not be shown to unworthy persons, nor lightly reveal the true text, lest the body be struck by the wind-blade’s trial. Those who love the Way truly, diligently concentrating on mystery, not sparing wealth, valuing the law over riches, the Way will be preserved. Such persons may be spoken to. Those who love riches inwardly and show fickleness outwardly, the Way is already illuminated and closed within the jade box, sealed with golden gates, after ascending degrees, concealed in famous mountains.

On the right is the Supreme Jade Capital Nine Heavens Golden Firmament Mighty Divine Jade Blessing, Supreme Original Scripture, Supreme Divine Tiger Talisman.

On the right are the great characters of the divine tiger and the invocation of the spirit. The Supreme keeps it in the hall of the Primordial Origin, not transmitted to the world; only those who are Supreme Truth persons may see it. According to the regulations of the Supreme Ultimate forbidden methods, on the day of ascending degrees, one person is allowed to transmit; after the day passes, no further issuance is allowed. The ceremony of transmission is as per the highest method. Furthermore, when the above text is given, disciples should write a copy by hand to the master, who after a hundred days sinks it into the Eastern flowing waters, not to be seen by others. This text is named "Crossing the Human Path," a solemn pledge of the Three Officials.

The Supreme Divine Tiger Great Talisman Invocation and Blessing

Whoever receives the Supreme Jade Spirit Divine Tiger Great Talisman Formula, having completed the ritual of alliance and reception, the disciple clasps hands and draws a path to present to the Master. After receiving the scripture, for one hundred days the Master fasts and purifies for three days; with the text drawn by the disciple, and the oath and blessing all sealed with iron checks and sunk into the deep waters of the Eastern Sea, then facing heaven, the blessing is pronounced:

Supreme true talisman, jade spirit divine tiger, the receiver carves name in the immortal register, dispelling reductions and punishments, surely attaining truth, dispersing worries and sufferings. Do not divulge or leak; a moment of ten thousand years, carefully pledging to the water official, swiftly swearing to the Earth Official. Blessing completed, return directly, do not look back. This is called the Completion of the Pledge. The Three Officials’ Supreme Official’s immortal talisman begins here. Should one after receiving fail to perform this, throughout life one may not wear the divine tiger text or carve the Supreme Clarity name. After three years, the body too shall perish, long examined by the water official.

After the solemn pledge, on the day of the four seasons in the month, the day of Wushen, use vermilion brush to inscribe the text on white silk, making it three feet two inches long, writing in the style of Bai Wang, clicking teeth seven times, blessing:

The spirit of the Supreme Divine Tiger, binding Qi with purple writing, containing shining jade essence, subduing strong demons, commanding ten thousand spirits, divine youths attending guard, jade maidens supporting form. I wear this writing, commanding golden troops, to become immortal king, flying ascending Supreme Clarity. Finished, again click teeth seven times, swallow saliva thrice. On that day, place it in a purple silk pouch or plain brocade pouch to wear on the body.

According to the method of the Four Extremes, this talisman is weighty and may not be worn on earth among men; formerly there was an immortal named Jade Ting who was permitted to hear and see it. On the day of receiving the talisman, write in vermilion on white silk, the scroll small or large as desired, place in a pouch, if not sullied, it may be worn on the form. In all matters, conceal strictly, do not mix with other scriptures or reveal the chapters. This is forbidden by the Supreme Ultimate, be cautious.

The Supreme Origin Upper Talisman Spirit Qi Essence Scene, binding life spirit divine tiger seven heads, constantly attending to guard the body, to subdue and destroy evil demons, repel misfortune. After commanding the divine tiger, do not tell others, saying I have a heavenly talisman or reveal the chapters. If you tell one person, one tiger leaves; two persons, two tigers leave; three persons, three tigers; seven persons, all seven tigers leave; then the form’s body has no guarding troops; evil demons and ghosts, and the Three Officials and Northern Emperor, all come to test for defeat. If not yet immortal, keep it deeply secret. The regulations of the Four Pledges, be cautious, be cautious.
