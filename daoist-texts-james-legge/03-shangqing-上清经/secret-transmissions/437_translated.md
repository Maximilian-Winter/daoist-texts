# Record of the Traces of the Dao and the Spiritual Immortals

Title of the Scripture: Record of the Traces of the Dao and the Spiritual Immortals. Originally no author was indicated, but it is suspected to be a fragment of the Daoji Scripture by Gu Huan of the Southern Dynasties. Many of the names of ghosts and spirits recorded therein are also found in Tao Hongjing’s Zhen Gao. One scroll.

Record of the Traces of the Dao and the Spiritual Immortals

### The Six Palaces, Their Names the First

The Luo Feng Mountain lies in the northern Guǐ direction. The mountain is two thousand six hundred li high, and its circumference is thirty thousand li. Beneath the mountain there is a grotto heaven, which lies below the mountain and extends around fifteen thousand li; above and below are palaces of ghosts and spirits. Upon the mountain are six palaces; within the cave are also six palaces; each palace measures a thousand li in circumference. These are the six heavenly palaces of ghosts and spirits. The palaces upon the mountain are the outer palaces; those within the grotto are the inner palaces; their structure is equal.

The first palace is named the Palace of Severing Yin of Zhou; the second palace is the Palace of Supreme Killing and Honest Affairs; the third palace is the Palace of Bright Morning Enduring the Violent City; the fourth palace is the Palace of Tranquil Illumination and Sinful Qi; the fifth palace is called the Palace of Ancestral Spirit and the Seven Faults; the sixth palace is the Palace of Bold Command Linking Wan and Numerous. Altogether six heavenly palaces, which govern the six heavens of ghosts and spirits. The six palaces within the cave bear the same names and resemble those above, being called the six inner and outer palaces of the six heavens. If men know the names of the palace gates of Fengdu’s six heavens, then a hundred ghosts will not dare to do harm. When one wishes to lie down, one first faces north and chants a spell thrice, softly sounding it. The divine spell is thus:

'I am the disciple of the Supreme, commanding the six heavens below. The palaces of the six heavens are my jurisdiction; not only mine, but also that of the Supreme Lord. I know the names of the gates of the six heavens; therefore I live long. Whoever dares to offend, the Supreme Lord will sever you. The first palace is called the Palace of Severing Yin of Zhou; the second palace lies eastwards next; from here onward the palaces are numbered till the sixth palace ends. Then one clicks one’s teeth six times and lies down, repelling the qi of ghosts and demons.'

When a man first dies, he goes first to the Palace of Severing Yin of Zhou to receive his affairs; some go first to famous mountains, Mount Tai, or rivers, but it is not necessary to go straight to the first heaven. The day one receives one’s affairs, when sins are examined and auspicious and inauspicious matters are judged, one must come to this first heavenly palace alone. The Palace of Supreme Killing governs the ghosts of killing; it is the second heaven, and those who die sudden violent deaths also pass through here. Worthy men and sages, on departing this world, first pass through the bright morning third palace to receive their affairs; calamity, fortune, auspiciousness, inauspiciousness, predestined fate, and sins are handled by the tranquil illumination fourth palace. The ghost official of the Northern Dipper presides here. The Northern Dipper of the ghost officials is not the Northern Dipper of the heavens, but a separate Northern Dipper official who governs life and death. The ghost official titled Supreme Emperor is the Northern Emperor Lord, who governs the first palace and supervises all six heavenly palaces. The other four heavenly palaces each have a clear lord ruling within. Each second palace has an official established; the six heavens have three officials in total, known today by the offices of punishment, responsible for examinations and banishments, who commonly report to the true immortals, the supervisors of fate, and also have overall command. They govern the immortals’ mansions and jointly oversee the duties of death and life. All great decisions and regulations are made by the immortal officials.

The ghost official Northern Dipper Lord is the Daoist examiner of the Seven Stars and Northern Dipper; this ghost official is also subordinate to the Nine Star spirits, and ultimately to the Jade Lord of the North Star. Xiang Liangcheng composed the "Praise of Fengdu," saying:

'Severing Yin marks the Emperor Morning,  
Honest affairs encounter the great Altar.  
Flaming like smoke in the sky,  
Flourishing like the splendour of radiance.  
The Violent City bears the Spirit Peak,  
Tranquil Illumination swallows the Blue River.  
The gates stand by the Red Well,  
Cloud Gates rise towering and steep.  
Seven Faults connects the wondrous canopy,  
Linking Wan spreads the demon throng.  
The six heavens stretch across the northern path,  
This is the home of ghosts and spirits.'

The poem consists of twenty thousand words; here only the inscriptions of the six heavenly palaces are briefly cited. It may be softly read at night, said also to repel evil ghosts.

Upon Fengdu Mountain, the trees, waters, and marshes resemble those of the human world, but the grains of rice are as large as pomegranate seeds, and taste like water caltrop; the other four grains are as usual, but called rice and given great regard. Du Qiong composed the "Rhapsody on Heavy Thought," saying:  
'Dense spring growth, verdant heavy thought,  
Spiritual qi mingles, fine grain comes in due season.  
After the four seasons have been enjoyed, the sacrificers offer their rites.  
The divine grain flourishes in vast strongholds,  
Huge ears stretch across our mysterious terraces,  
Here are bright auspices,  
The Emperor shines in glory.'  
This is the meaning thereof.

The Fengdu rice is called Heavy Thought; its grains resemble pomegranate seeds, large and differing in size; its colour and flavour resemble water caltrop, and it is also offered as tribute to the immortal officials.

### The Ghost Spirits Rule the Second

Yan Qingjia was the ancient Yan Emperor, now the Northern Supreme Emperor Lord and the lord of all ghosts and spirits under heaven.

King Wu became the ghost official Northern Dipper Lord. Xia Qi is the Eastern Clear Lord, commanding the Dipper Lord’s troop. King Wen is the Western Clear Lord, commanding the Northern Emperor’s troop. Shao Gong Shi is the Southern Clear Lord. Wu Ji Zha is the Northern Clear Lord. The four clear lords each have four attendants. These four lords will later all undergo transformation and ascension to the immortal grade. The four clear lords govern the ghosts of the four directions; the sixteen clear lords govern the blood offerings of ghosts of the world’s ancestral temples.

Zhou Zhuan is the chief ghost official, commander of the supervisors of fate; today Deng Yue and Cheng Xia act in his place on account of many affairs.

The Western Clear Capital has the officer Jia Yi, formerly in charge of the affairs of Ma Rong; he was deposed and assigned to guard Mount Tai; the Lord of Mount Tai recently petitioned to make him supervisor of the military.

The southern gate chief is now Zhou Fu, replacing Xie Jian. One heavenly gate has two chiefs; each chief commands four door attendants; altogether eight door attendants at the heavenly gate. The door attendants serve under the gate chiefs; these belong to the Northern Emperor’s gate. The Northern Dipper Lord’s gate chief is now Zang Hong, who replaced Wei Xiao; another is Wang Bo, newly appointed.

Ji Zhan was formerly a river pacification general and supervisor; now he is a Northern Heaven door attendant, replacing Tian Yin Zhan and Yu Tan, and guards the heavenly gate continuously.

Wei Zhao commands the Marquis of Mount Lu.

Gu He returned from the garrison of Liaodong; after affairs dispersed, the Northern Emperor Lord appointed him as an official to hold the banner; this official office was given to Fan Ming, who was promoted to the Marquis of Ceremony.

Yin Hao attended Emperor Morning, debating with He Yan.

Wen Taizhen is the Overseer of the Sea, Count of the Opening Country, governing the East Sea; recently took Du Yu as his Chief Clerk; his rank corresponds to that of a great general’s chief clerk.

He Cidao began as a censor within the Northern Emperor’s palace, later allowed to receive transformation in the Vermilion Fire Palace, on account of his many previous meritorious deeds.

Wei Wu Di is the Northern Ruo Grand Tutor. The others cannot be enumerated here. These are matters of ghosts and spirits, not for display to the world, as said by Lord Xun.

### The Rules of Lying Down the Third

When a man lies down on his bed, it should be high; if too high, the earth qi will not reach, and ghost breezes cannot invade. The invasion of ghost qi depends on the earth and rises upward.

The room where one lies should be clean; cleanliness brings receipt of spiritual qi; impurity brings old qi. The disorder of old qi in a room causes failure of designs and the lack of establishment of undertakings. The body is the same; one must often wash, bathe, and cleanse; if not, there is no hope.

Do not say one studies the Dao, studies the Dao, and ghosts invade people and affairs fail, causing illness; this is because the body is not true. In distant mountains, inheriting the precepts of Master Meng, one reads first the "Yellow Court Inner Scripture" before sleeping, then slumbers; this causes the soul and spirit to train themselves. By doing this for twenty-one years, one becomes immortal; this is to combine ten thousand faults. To recite three or four times at evening is best. Lady Jiang of Mount Bei says: reading this also makes one free of illness; this is the way of not dying.

### At Night One Often Clicks One’s Teeth the Fourth

When travelling at night one often clicks one’s teeth, and the number of clicks is infinite. The killing ghosts and evil ghosts always fear the sound of clicking teeth; therefore they dare not invade men. If one combines this with gargling spells, it is better.

Once there was a man named Bao Zhu, from Jibei, who never studied the Dao or knew of magic arts. At over forty years old he suddenly contracted facial paralysis; his mouth and eyes were distorted; wind qi entered his mouth and his upper and lower teeth constantly clicked and struck each other with a loud noise, day and night without cease. He lived to the age of one hundred and twenty-seven. Later he encountered great cold and crossed a great river, falling into the River of Longevity and dying. The Northern Emperor also dispatched killing ghosts and punishment envoys of the day to take him, but these killing ghosts never dared approach to assist; when the ghost official asked why, the heavenly killing replied: This man used many magic arts to control us, always clicking his teeth and beating the heavenly drum to warn the spirits within his body; the spirits cannot scatter, ghost qi cannot enter; thus no opportunity arises to kill him. From this it follows that if one did not cross the river by water, one might live a thousand years without blame. But when encountering great cold, walking on water, the mouth is closed and one cannot click the teeth; thus the ghosts caused drowning in the river. Those suffering wind illness whose teeth click by themselves are still avoiding death and killing ghosts; how much more so a Daoist truly clicking his teeth and beating the heavenly drum to guard his body and spirits? The immortals’ prescriptions say: frequently swallowing saliva and clicking teeth cause a person to become younger.

### The Supreme Emperor’s Officials Belong to the Fifth

Emperor Morning has eight attendants: Xu Shu, Pang De, Yuan Yu, Li Guang, Wang Jia, He Yan, Xie Jie, Yin Hao, all dwelling therein, like attendants of the world.

The four clear lords and the Northern Dipper Lord all have five attendants of Emperor Morning; these eight attendants are officials of the Northern Supreme Emperor; their selection and usage are the same.

There are also mid-level attendants of four persons, like ministers of the imperial secretariat. Dai Yuan, Gongsun Du, Liu Feng, Guo Jia, these four are now in office. Feng was the adopted son of Xuan De; Xuan De is now Marquis of the Northern River, opposing Han Sui, and commanding the immortal officials.

There are also two great attendants, like present-day ministers; Han Guangwu and Sun Wentai now hold these posts.

There are mid-attendants, like mid-secretariat officials; two supervisors are Yan Huai and Yang Biao. Huai’s style name is Siji, Biao’s is Wenxian.

Xu Chief Clerk’s father is now Marquis of the Southern Prison; the Marquis of the Prison has two persons, each in charge of south and north. Xu Chief Clerk’s father is Marquis of the Southern Prison, Liu Zan is his supervisor, Bao Xun is Marquis of the Northern Prison, Wei Zun is supervisor; each is master of the south and north gate keys. Xu commands one thousand soldiers of the Southern Guard; Bao Xun commands one thousand soldiers of the Northern Guard; mostly they guard gates, arrest and detain, like the imperial guards of the current world. The Southern and Northern Guards resemble the Daoist heavenly soldiers and armored infantry.

Sun Ce is a guest friend of the Eastern Clear Lord; Han Gao is a guest friend of the Southern Clear Lord; Jin Xuan is a guest friend of the Western Clear Lord; Xun Huo is a guest friend of the Northern Clear Lord. Among them, those who in previous lives had virtue and benevolence, sometimes are appointed to heavenly posts, or enter the Southern Palace to receive transformation, regardless of office. The amount of sin and fortune in the world is judged and measured.

Generally, those practicing secret virtue often aid the poor and distressed, and quickly enter the Southern Palace to be transformed into immortals.

Yu Yuan Gui is the Northern Supreme Emperor’s former central guard general, taking Guo Changxiang as chief clerk, and Hua Shao as supervisor; these are called military lords, commanding several thousand ghost soldiers.

Kong Wen Ju is the rear central guard general, with Zhang Xiu as supervisor and Tang Gu as chief clerk.

Tao Kan is Marquis of Western River, also commanding several thousand soldiers; he has recently requested Teng Han to replace him, but has not yet been approved; Xu Ning is chief clerk; having arrested a rebel at the northern gate, he was not captured but dismissed, and Cai Mo is to replace Ning.

The four garrisons each command ten thousand ghost soldiers; the central officers command only several thousand. The four garrisons have four officers: Lord of Mount Tai, Duke of Lulong, Grand General of Eastern Yue, Marquis of Southern Ba; each commands ten thousand soldiers.

He Ceng is Marquis of Southern Ba; Cao Ren is Duke of Lulong; Liu Tao is Grand General of Eastern Yue; Xun Lei is Lord of Mount Tai. Each commands ten thousand in their garrisons, with several hundred posts. Those commanding several thousand troops also have several hundred posts, mutually subordinate. Each has chief clerks and supervisors. Zhuan took Gu Zhong as Mount Tai general, using Cao Hong as supervisor and Huan Fan as chief clerk.

Wang Yishao has been ill in prison for five years, saying affairs have dispersed.

Jiang Ji is Count of Southern Mountain, commanding two thousand soldiers.

Wang Yu is general of ghost troops. Those with posts are roughly recognized by name; those without posts cannot be all known, as the dispersed are innumerable. Referring to the Chinese, the border regions cannot be enumerated.

Xu Zhao is now right commander attendant of the Eastern Clear Lord; the attendant commander’s office corresponds to secretary of the imperial secretariat.

Shao Shi is Eastern Clear Lord, said to have been appointed right protector of the Nine Palaces.

There are three ranks of underground lords; the ghost generals have three ranks; these are those with accumulated merit and virtue, or those who seek long life, reaching the Dao; some are good acts of descendants, spreading their ancestors’ merits; some praise and clarify Dongxuan, transforming and transmitting to ancestors. Those who seek it are not one, but acquire it by many paths; it depends on accumulated secret virtue, then one ascends this broad life.

The ghost generals Wu Jie and Zhu are the beginning of immortality; also called Donghua and Jian Kan, they do not belong to Fengdu officials, nor submit to the three officials’ jurisdictions. The first rank of underground lords live scattered outside mansions, idle and without occupation, not subject to the Nine Palace teachings, nor hearing of transformation work; though all in grotto heavens, they are beneath the lords. According to the Four Clear laws, it takes one hundred and forty years to advance a grade; advancement first attains immortal rank and receives orders from immortals. The second rank of underground lords advance straight to immortal rank, receive immortals, and in forty years advance to supervisory office; the supervisory office corresponds to scattered minor officials of the world. This rank corresponds to the middle category of lower lords; Li Dong and others are now in the first rank. The third rank of underground lords are the high lords; they enter and leave the immortal halls and chambers, wander the divine lands, exit the mansions Yiqian, Tongchu, and Erfu, enter feasts of Donghua on the high terrace, receive teachings of transformation, advance in clarity and qi; in twelve years qi seizes the soul and spirit; fifteen years spirit comes and hides the corporeal soul; thirty years in the coffin bones return, attaching to spirit and spirit qi; forty years calm restoration and rebirth, return to wander the human world; fifty years advance to immortal official; sixty years gain to wander the Broad Cold; one hundred years enter the palace of Kunying. These are the high lords, indulged by immortals. Zhang Jiangzi and others were formerly in the third rank, just gaining entry to Yiqian. The ranks of ghost generals are the same. On the twenty-fourth night of the seventh month the Life Protector Lord informed thus.

### The Spirit Man Xin Xuanzi’s Self-Introduction and Poem the Sixth

Xin Xuanzi, styled Yanqi, was a man of Dinggu in Longxi. In the reign of Emperor Ming of Han he was remonstrance officer, and son of Xin Yin of the three commanderies Luo, Yunzhong, and Zhao. Xuanzi was fond of study from youth, reverent of precepts and discipline, sincerely diligent; abstained from meat at noon; refined his form and guarded his essence, not encountering external things; refused all invitations from governors and prefects; sometimes wandered mountains and forests, abandoned worldly dust. He wished to meet Zi Jin in Wei Cen and journeyed from Junyang to walk with Xuan, thus changing his name to Xuanzi and styling himself Yanqi. He did not expect many faults of his ancestors to bring disaster upon descendants; engraved on the emperor’s tablet, his fate reached the afterworld; his life was not long, and he died at Changliang Ferry. The Queen Mother of the West saw his hard practice; the Fengdu Supreme Emperor pitied his Daoist heart; ordered the Supervisor of Fate; summoned the three officials; took his body; restored his soul and true form; made his womb and seat into a spiritual deity, now for over two hundred years. Recently he attained the rank of Duke of the South Palace; settled his plan at Zhu Ling; stored essence awaiting the time; about to be listed as immortal. The Supreme Emperor now soon appoints him Lord of the East Sea, replacing Yu Sheng; again selected as mid-level attendant general; commanding ghosts and spirits of Wu and Yue; responsible for affairs without neglect, this is also hard work. As for those wearing the crown attendants’ blue, with desolate feather sleeves, ringing the immortal steps, turning the jade chariot in the chamber, though truly of pure heart, they have yet no day. He regrets not quickly joining the immortals together to feast at Kunlang’s battlements, to observe the remains of the musical pitch, to pluck the jade ganoderma from the secluded peaks, to shake the emerald robes in the nine skies, to dance the cloud wings in the ten directions. Now he commands the multitude of ghosts, governs right and wrong, dwells amidst filth; hears the confusion of evil demons; affairs differ widely from Dao and virtue; eyes twice glance and truth is sparse; familiar with brightness and stillness in the mysterious realm, roaming at ease in the Great Beginning. Those in harmony with one voice and united, all things are likewise divided and classified; their mutual sounds are distant; their fate relies on accumulated merit; hence the text is inscribed in the Upper Clarity, the cinnabar registers, and the mysterious steps; the Daoist qi accords with spiritual virtue, entrusting the body to high radiance; thus they come to follow. Now three poems are presented to relate the utmost of feelings. Their words are:

'Once entering the dark land,  
Following the chariot responding to the spirit’s summons.  
The spirit follows the chamber without dispersal,  
Qi merges with congratulatory clouds and vanishes.  
The form is not bright jade substance,  
How can the mysterious craftsman carve?  
Treading lightly, singing softly,  
Raising the hand to play the whistling reeds.  
In forest chambers there is ease and joy,  
Surpassing this pavilion’s exterior air.  
The lingering light attaches to the perfect radiance,  
What a scant and clear sound.'

'Silent communication, sending forth feelings and responses,  
Mysterious qi seizes and moves sound.  
Though the high wheel is uneven,  
It seeks the ten-thousand fathoms.  
The Daoist son grinds finely,  
Unites spirit and covenants with spiritual collar.  
Surrendering to the worldly transformations,  
The heart marks the deep forest.  
Together wandering beyond principle,  
They rest in quiet at East Cen.'

'Commanding the chariot to vast Feng Altar,  
Escaping the border, crossing the dark land.  
In the void there are things,  
In the midst there is also no permanence.  
Awakening words of boundless being,  
Together meeting at Hao Bridge.  
Eyes perceive the mysterious interpreter,  
Ghosts and spirits’ principles are forgotten.'

Xuanzi says: In Wei times Xin Pi, styled Zuozhi, was his seventh generation grandson; in the second year of Jianwu of Han, he moved from Longxi to Yangdi county in Yingchuan. Pi served Wei as envoy, grand general, supervisor of the army of Prince Xuan, lieutenant, and marquis. Pi’s son was named Chang, governor of Henei and Minister of Ceremonies.

Xuanzi says: Yu Sheng was the Jin Grand Commandant Yu; the Northern Emperor employed him as eastern pacification general; later he became Marquis of the East Sea; now he serves at Fengtai with Emperor Morning; now a court attendant. The right censor is like the world’s right guard general but of great importance. The left censor is Xie Youyu, taking Fengyue as supervisor.

Xie Nanchang Gong was formerly the Southern Zhu Yang Gate Spirit Pass Marquis of the Northern Emperor; later he became supervisor of Gaoming; formerly removed for dispute with Liu Qingsun; now begins to resume office. Supervisor of Gaoming is like a minister of the imperial secretariat.

He Cidao is now in the Southern Palace, serving at the Huatai; already received writings; advancing to the Southern Mountain. This man performed many acts of kindness in life, thus early received transformation.

Zhou Boren was recently employed as protector of the central capital of the Western Clear Lord; protector of the central capital is like the world’s Grand Tutor; he was removed for selecting Deng You unjustly; demoted to protector; protector corresponds to junior tutor. The right is what Xin Xuanzi spoke of; many affairs exist in the dark realm; now roughly written in a corner; no more details are recorded.

### Pei Junshuo’s One Year of Attaining the Dao the Seventh

In Mount Huo there were Dao learners Deng Boyuan and Wang Xuanfu; they took the blue essence stone rice, swallowed the sun’s cinnabar and scenic methods, refined and contemplated in the grotto chamber for thirty-four years; then internally saw the five viscera; at night in the dark wrote that on the fifth day of the fifth month this year the Supreme Emperor sent a feathered chariot to receive them. Boyuan and Xuanfu then rode the clouds and drove dragons, ascending to heaven in broad daylight; now at the Northern Mysterious Garden Terrace, received writings and rank as mid-level perfect man.

In Huayang Mountain there were Dao learners Yin Qianzi, Zhang Shisheng, Li Fanghui, all of the Jin Wu Emperor’s time; they received the immortal Guan Chengzi’s steaming cinnabar and wood method; all took these and gained longevity and daily vigor; also received Su Men Zhou Shouling’s cinnabar and rosy clouds way; practiced for fifty years with refined heart, internally viewing, no longer eating or drinking; body and bones light and agile, complexion like a child; on the twelfth day of the second month this year the Supreme One sent to receive them; on that day they rode clouds and ascended to heaven; now at the Mysterious State received writings as high immortals; Shisheng is Duke of Eastern Source.

In Mount Heng there were Dao learners Zhang Lizheng and Li Mingqi; Lizheng took Huangjing in the mountains at the end of Han, complexion vigorous and strong, always like a man of forty years; Mingqi entered mountains at the end of Wei, took Zexie and Wushi pill, and together rested in the caves; later both received the Western City Lord Hongjing’s elixir formula; having taken the elixir for forty-three years, suffered the pill sand difficulty, both went out to Guangzhou as travelers; this was when Teng Han was governor. They penetrated inside and out, clear-eyed and light-bodied, one day travelling five hundred li, also keeping watch, already thirty years; on the first day of the third month the East Hua sent to receive them; on that day they rode clouds and ascended to heaven; now in the chamber of the Eastern Windstorm as upper immortals.

In Mount Lujiangqian there were Dao learners Zheng Jingshi and Zhang Chonghua; both in early Jin received immortal Meng Deran’s secret formulas; entered mountains, practiced guarding five viscera and containing the sun method; also took hemp seed and mysterious elixir; long time without eating or drinking; body light and strong, restored former form; on the nineteenth day of the fourth month this year the Northern Mysterious Great Supreme One sent to receive them by cloud chariot, ascending to heaven in broad daylight; now in the Mysterious State.

In Mount Kuocang there was Dao learner Ping Zhongjie, from Hedong; during the great barbarian upheaval in China came crossing the river into Mount Kuocang; apprenticed to Master Song Jun at the Heart Mirror Way; understood the hundred spirits; practiced grotto chamber affairs; thus accumulated forty-five years; refined essence and mind; body diminished; possessed true qi; on the first day of the fifth month this year the Central Huang Lao sent to receive; that day rode clouds and drove dragons, ascending in bright daylight; now at the Canglang Cloud Terrace.

In Mount Shanxiaobai of Yan there was Dao learner Zhao Guangxin, of Yangcheng; at the end of Wei crossed the river into this mountain; received Li Facheng’s qi nourishment method; apprenticed to Zuo Jun in the mysterious Dao; internally saw the five viscera and thorough observation method; for eighteen years traveled county and state, sometimes selling medicines and entering and leaving; no one knew; often came to the county market to make cinnabar, making the Jiuhua pill, one dose. Supreme Dao Lord on the seventeenth day of the sixth month this year sent to receive; stayed three days; bade farewell to comrades in the mountain; then rode clouds and dragons, ascending in bright daylight; now in the Eastern Hua sea.

In Mount Langwu there was Dao learner Yu Wengsheng, from Kuaiji; formerly received immortal Jie Jun’s sun essence food method; at Wu time came to hide in this mountain; also practiced cloud qi and returning form Dao; refined and contemplated long; body lessened like a child; on the twenty-third day of the seventh month this year the East Hua Supreme Emperor sent to receive; on that day rode clouds and ascended; now in Tanggu Mountain.

In Mount Chishui there was Dao learner Zhu Ruzi; at the end of Wu entered this mountain; took chrysanthemum flowers and wood bait; later met Xi Gui Zi, who begged to cross the world; Xi Gui Zi taught him essential words; entered the chamber to preserve the mud pellet method; after thirty years was able to cause clouds and rain in the grotto chamber; on the fifth day of the eighth month this year the Queen Mother of the West sent to receive; on that day rode a five-coloured cloud chariot and ascended; now in the Accumulated Stone chamber.

Among the famous mountains and the Five Great Mountains there are hundreds of thousands learning the Dao; this year there are those who attain the Dao and ascend to heaven, their names separate; every year and every month some depart; these cannot all be recorded in detail; now a brief record only of one year’s attainments. There are many who do not enjoy ascending but remain long in the Five Great Mountains and famous mountains; they are countless; some are appointed immortal officials to guard and manage the famous mountains; there are also several thousands. On the twentieth night of the ninth month the Clear Spirit record was issued.

### The Order of the Daoist Lords the Eighth

Sima Jizhu later entered and entrusted to Yushan stone chamber of great abundance; received the stone essence, golden light, hidden radiance transformation method from the Western Spirit Lady Capital. The Western Spirit Lady Capital is the Supreme Mysterious Immortal Maiden. Those now in the Great Abundance chamber are Guangyu Bao Shuyang, Taiyuan Wang Yangbo, Yingchuan Liu Weihui, Dai Commandery Duan Jizheng, all disciples receiving the Dao of Master Western Spirit Lady Capital. Jizhu, on departing, entrusted his form and pillow as the image of the fifth and sixth terrestrial branches. His tomb lies south of Mount Shengpan in Shu Commandery Chengdu; Zhuge Wuhou once erected a stele and inscription before Jizhu’s tomb, the stele praising:

'Vast and silent the great stillness,  
Yin and Yang mingled and joined.  
Heaven and earth floating in union,  
Ten thousand things flourish and grow.  
The master lays down principles,  
Distinguishing softness and hardness.  
Ghosts and spirits observe,  
The six degrees manifest clearly.'

Guangyu Bao Shuyang was a minister of Kings Zhang Er and Zhang Ao of Zhao during Han Gaozu’s time; fond of nurturing life and taking cinnamon powder, but died in laughter and talk; his tomb is on the northern hill of Liao Ji city.

Wang Yangbo of Taiyuan was a central attendant in the regency of Empress Lü; middle attendant Wang Cai, from youth took Zexie; with Liu Hou Zhang Liang gathered medicines on Mount Zhongnan; Yangbo did not return, apprenticed to Jizhu.

Liu Weihui of Yingchuan was public carriage supervisor Liu Feng in Han Jing Emperor’s time; later served Jizhu; late took sun and moon qi; became an inner chamber disciple; Dao achieved. Returning late to home, entrusted form to staff and shoes; died beneath a mulberry tree; tomb now on western hill of Ancheng county, Runan.

Duan Jizheng of Dai Commandery was a recluse; no record of practice; late studied Dao with Jizhu; traveled and crossed Qin Chuan; both obtained corpse liberation and were buried by the river; now south of Zheng Qin Chuan. He was also an inner chamber disciple of Jizhu.

Jizhu had one son and one daughter who both attained the Dao; son named Fayu, daughter named Jihua; both now in Yushan. Jihua today is reading the "Thirty-nine Chapters," still not finished.

Jizhu read the Jade Scripture, took the flower of bright cinnabar, drew support from morning radiance; now his colour is like a woman of twenty; beard three chi long; black as ink. Yesterday East Qing Lord spoke the record; such is a truly strange matter; unknown what cloud it is. Jizhu entrusted form to conceal brightness, hid traces in Yushan; the "Ziyang Transmission" fully records this matter. Last night East Qing came; briefly requested to ask Jizhu the beginning and end; East Qing saw and answered. This record is separate, submitted above; may it not be blamed; after reading, consign to fire. Later the holy Lord Li commemorated also; mostly similar to the former; yet East Qing also added nearly ten thousand words of annotation; a great wondrous work. Recently much discussed spiritual transformation matters; briefly touching on Jizhu alone. Last month again received the "Spirit Tiger Scripture Explanation and Annotation," unheard in the world; also did not appreciate its meaning. If more be heard of the like of Jizhu, it should be secretly reported.

Record of the Traces of the Dao and the Spiritual Immortals
