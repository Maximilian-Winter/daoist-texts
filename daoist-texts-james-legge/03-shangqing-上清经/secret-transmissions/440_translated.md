## The Supreme Three Origins Talismans for Pacifying the Dwelling

The Most Supreme Primordial Supreme Origin, the Great Supreme Jade Emperor of Limitless Dao, on the fifteenth day of the tenth month in the year of Ren-Shen, at the hour of Yin, the Dao Lord descended upon the layered palace on Mount Kunlun. At that time, the True Ones were arrayed in the void, their august radiance splendid, suspended above the empty firmament, announcing with clear decree unto the Seven True Ones of Golden Brightness: "You are to become the masters of the orthodox Dharma of Heaven and Man in the Ten Directions of the coming age; those who would become True Ones must first hasten to save the world, thereby should you widely increase merit and virtue and open the way to rescue Heaven and Man. This merit is unsurpassed; when accomplishment is attained and virtue universal, the Dao will be obtained of itself."

At that time, the Seven True Ones, abiding in their truth, embodying the ten contemplations, the Golden Origin soared into stillness; the Mysterious Celestial Venerable, in the highest highest of the great stillness, the supreme and subtle, bowed and made obeisance, and asked the Celestial Venerable: "Since the recent times, the Three Realms have collapsed and fallen; between Heaven and Earth the air of man, ghost, and soldier in warfare rises tumultuously day and night. In this last kalpa, how could the Seven True Ones, ignorant and benighted, know how to aid? I humbly beseech enlightenment for the unenlightened, that the Seven True Ones may ascend here to Right Awakening and serve as a bridge of Dharma to save the world; not only to receive grace in this life, but also to aid the future, and thus broadly save future rebirths. I only wish the Celestial Venerable to grant vision, in pity for the fault of the Seven True Ones' insufficiency."

Then the Celestial Venerable immediately told the Seven True Ones of Golden Brightness: "Your fate is to receive the record and to become the great true masters of the orthodox great Dharma in the Ten Directions, to turn the Golden True Dharma Wheel. The merit of this Dharma Wheel is the supreme, most subtle, true great vehicle king of orthodox Dharma. Its merit and virtue are majestic and vast, encompassing all phenomena; indeed there is infinite merit beyond compare. Except for the sons of the most noble and perfect men, who else can establish such merit and found such blessings? Yet the sentient beings of the Three Realms sink in the sea of suffering, the dead lie buried in dark night, their souls suffer manifold torments; the living are unhappy. At this last kalpa, amid the workings of the Three Calamities and Five Defilements, evil abounds and calamities and soldiers march side by side, this has long endured; is it not a matter of sorrow? Yet the great vehicle's highest meritorious works are not those constantly cultivated by all the common people. Thus, I now issue the Supreme Talismans of the Three Origins of the Heavenly Officials of the Highest Origin, the Spirit Inspection Deity, the Capturing of Ghosts, the Curbing of Demons, the Great Talisman of Spirit Control, to hold and maintain the upright Qi of Heaven and Earth, assist the country and support the times with talismanic commands of the Three Origins; by this one may sustain and save the world. I seal it with the seal of the Supreme Three Origins, to be placed above the doors of the halls of Heaven and Man, to drive away the demons, spirits, ghosts, pestilence, and plagues of the Ten and Five Directions, the hundred poisons, the baleful and ominous airs, the images of devils, evil spirits, and shape-shifters, and command them to be controlled, that all calamities, wars, demons, and spirits may not escape, and the householder shall forever keep the state of non-action. Whoever obtains this will be preserved from the Three Calamities and the great disasters amid the Five Defilements. If the ruler of the state is a follower of our Dao, the blessing will be peace; when ruler and ministers walk the Dao, the state and altar endure forever." The Seven True Ones then bowed twice and earnestly requested to receive the talisman.

At that time, the Celestial Venerable said to the Seven True Ones: "Now I shall make a universal proclamation to Heaven and Earth, and jointly bear witness to the covenant. The head of the talisman for spirit pacification is to inspect and curb all unrighteous Qi, bringing it into the orthodox Dharma." The Seven True Ones made obeisance and accepted it, then reported to the Celestial Venerable: "We shall reverently act in accordance with the law." Upon completion, the Celestial Venerable ascended into the void and vanished.

The master shall then confer the talisman to the disciple, who shall bow and declare as a disciple of the orthodox pure great Dao, and bow nine times.

## Preface by the Seven True Ones of Golden Brightness

The orthodox Dharma is the orthodox Dao; thus it can enlighten to the great awakening, ascend to right awakening, enter subtle awakening, truly great and subtle indeed. The subtle and profound cannot be fully spoken or pictured. Unless one be an arcane sage, who dares point beyond form or lead within form? The talismans originally issued from the Most Supreme Primordial Supreme Origin Jade Emperor’s transmission, coming from infinite kalpas, constantly active in the last kalpa, producing the world and saving the suffering amidst the Yang Nine and protecting the Six Hundred and Sixteen without harm. Thus the Dao Lord’s compassion and transformation, is it for himself alone? The orthodox teaching truly resembles a loving mother, ever mindful of her infants, like a good physician treating illness, willing to effect but unwilling to fail. Yet the vehicle for saving the world is even more than this. Thus the sentient beings of the Three Realms, in this heat and suffering, their lives like lamps and candles, how know they their pain and say there is joy? I observe the multitude bewildered, truly not joyous. Thus their years are short as the flash of lightning, finally sinking into the eight calamities, long kalpas, five poisons complete, ten sufferings of the nether regions; what joy is there? Before the body ceases, seeing the world tumultuous and soldiers unperceived, how much more the sinking corpse? Said truly, the compassionate teaching descends to awaken the nether regions, only when the nine nights are bright does the darkness dissipate, opening the gate of the mirror of wisdom, to illuminate the unawakened beginnings of sentient beings, enabling them to pass through the six wisdoms, clear and unimpeded, making the household auspicious and pure, the dead ascend and transform to heaven, the wandering spirits free, benefiting the future generations’ peace. This is the orthodox teaching of the talisman, securing the household from the Five Defilements and preventing the Three Calamities and Six Harms from afflicting it. Its function is to control the operation of Heaven and Earth, how much more the ghosts and spirits that are not extinguished. But the troops of the Most Supreme Three Heavenly Jade Officials of orthodox Dharma are thus mighty spirits, naturally the spiritual generals. The soldiers likewise, only those who trust me; how could the household’s people come to understand?

## The Supreme Three Origins Talismans for Pacifying the Dwelling
