The Primordial Register of the Three Hundred and Sixty-Five Divisions of the True Spirits of the Nine Heavens of the Supreme Origin of the Golden Perfect Jade Emperor of Shangqing

Golden Illumination saith: The Seven Perfected Ones first received, on the day of the Wu hour of the fifth day of the fifth month in the year Guǐhài, the Celestial Register of the Supreme Origin from the Great Supreme Jade Morning Lord; now nine years have passed therefrom. The Precious Register of the Seven Perfected Ones gathers the divine spirits and breath, never once failing in its divine characters. Again, on the first day of the fifth month in the fifth year of the Great Purity era, the Heavenly Treasure Jade Emperor descended truthfully at the Qiong Palace of Dai Ridge, and anew assigned the Seven Perfected Ones to establish the Supreme Origin True Spirit Mysterious Register of the Nine Heavens, and the official ranks and titles were thereby set aright.

Golden Illumination saith: At that time the Heavenly Treasure Jade Emperor spake in golden formula to the Seven Perfected Ones, saying: "This Supreme Origin Register of the Three Hundred and Sixty-Five Divisions of the True Spirits of the Nine Heavens, the generals and heavenly officers therein, were not composed by later scholars. The truth thereof is the Supreme Origin of the Flying Condensation Pure True Born Spirits, wondrous energies, which respond to the natural bright operation, becoming perfected persons. Their vesture is naturally the five-coloured flying heavenly feather robes; their forms are all Vajra, their height more than three thousand zhang. The officers under their command wear naturally the three-coloured flying azure feathered immortal robes, and ever guard the Supreme Origin of the Nine Heavens, assisting the governance of the Thirty-Six True Emperors. Thus the law conforms to the four symbols of Heaven and Earth, the Jade Pass and the difficult mechanisms of the Three Hundred and Sixty-Five Degrees. Likewise it conforms to the guarding of the Nine Dawns, the Three Lights, the Seven Luminaries and the stars, the Nine Palaces, the Eight Trigrams, and the exact positions of Three Hundred and Sixty-Five Degrees. Also it conforms to the beginnings of the Three Hundred and Sixty-Five Qi of the Four Seasons of Heaven and Earth. Within, it guards the forms and revolutions of Heaven and Man, the number of Three Hundred and Sixty-Five joints and viscera. Above, it presides over the balanced Qi of Heaven and Earth; in the middle, it assists the Heavenly Emperor in sustaining fate, the national ruler’s bright destiny; it clarifies the operation of the Three Origins and the virtuous kalpa; below, it delivers the Three Realms of living beings, opens the gate of true law in great light, ferries Heaven and Man over the bridge of blessing, rescues from the eight hardships in the sea of suffering, draws out from the three paths and six destinies, cures sickness in the world through the Mysterious Register, guards against celestial disasters by the spiritual officers, regulates the nine breaths by divine power, protects the destined body by heavenly soldiers, preserves blessings and fortunes through kalpas, averts the ten evils of the heavenly hall, restrains poisonous ghosts by divine generals, controls the myriad demons by celestial truth, repels the myriad calamities by spiritual officers, subdues myriad spirits by heavenly might, pierces hordes of monsters by divine force, extinguishes water and fire by divine wisdom, dissipates noxious vapours by pure waters, sweeps away dust by golden winds, preserves the destined form by wondrous Qi, cures myriad diseases by heavenly physicians, and guards the destined joints by true essence. Therefore its功 (achievement) is without omission, without limit; its law is the measure of Heaven, Earth, and Man. It ever follows the bright operation to descend teachings, saving men in the latter kalpa. It preserves non-action in the future. Its law is to prosper in the era of the Spiritual Dragon. At that time, the sovereign practises the Dao and cultivates virtue; that is its運 (operation). The imperial fortune is at peace; that is its功 (achievement). The fates of Heaven and Man are not cut short; that is its blessing. The Most High hath said: ‘When this prospers, it is the completion of myriad Dao, the Mysterious Model arises, the Great Vehicle moves on, preserving the destined heavenly years, and attaining equality with the Three Origins.’ This may be called the功 (achievement) of Nature, and the opening of salvation is not difficult. Therefore this preface is written, to clarify this功 (achievement). Later sages, perfect men, and the faithful and esteemed, should surely reverently observe and carry it out.

Now there are men and women of a certain county, township, and hamlet, numbering thus and so, who submit and earnestly bow to the Three Excellencies, seeking to receive the Primordial Register of the Three Hundred and Sixty-Five Divisions of the True Spirits of the Nine Heavens of the Supreme Origin. On the appointed day they write the regulations and the heavenly officers’ ranks, according to the law of the mysterious register; when to present memorials and when to deliver registers is stated in time, and in due course they shall respectfully request the Three Origins and Nine Heavens’ officers to deliver. Now again they present a memorial, opening to the Limitless Great Dao, the Primordial Great Supreme Jade Emperor, the Limitless Utmost True Great Sage Heavenly Lord, the Golden Palace Jade Emperor, the Immortal Capital True Officers, the summons and administration officers, the Most High Dharma King, the Limitless Eight Primal Heavenly Masters; beseeching them to issue commands to the ten directions, the eight extremities, the five directions, and to supervise and summon the seventy-two official lords of the Three Origins and Four Beginnings, the thirty-six officers of the Red Sun Bing and Ding, the officials of Heaven and Earth, mountains and rivers, the nine rivers and eight seas, all spiritual officers, to summon the local true officials, to observe and note the Qi, the magistrates of the communities, all to reverently receive the imperial talismanic orders, to attend to the memorials, to certainly pass them on, not to withhold or delay the official documents. The celestial gods and the earth deities shall mutually assist in guarding. If any official of the six heavens with strong foul and unrighteous Qi attempts to intercept the memorials and prevent their passing on, the celestial officers and soldiers shall immediately, according to the three heavens’ righteous laws of the Immortal Capital, seize and deliver them to the prison of the North Great Yin of Tianyi, and must certainly cause the memorial to reach the Limitless Great Dao before the True Jade Emperor. Having finished, bow again, then present the memorial. When the memorial is finished, again issue an imperial command to announce功 (achievement).

---

Then the功 (achievement) is declared.

Jia again moves the true official commissioners, celestial officers, generals, soldiers, commanding officers, the flying white tiger delivering memorials, the flying dragon cavalry officers, etc., who proceed to speak and memorialize for Jia, for Jia, following events to present memorials, laying bare the matter. May Jia’s family thereby through this功德 (merit) open the way to the Nine Mysteries and the Seven Ancestors, to be delivered from the five roads of suffering, to receive pardon from the ten sufferings, eight hardships, and three condemnations; may life and death be both delivered and saved, ascended to Heaven to receive blessings, the Southern Palace clothing and kitchen naturally favourable. All ailments in Jia’s household, great and small, shall be healed; certain matters explained and dreams interpreted, all truly so. The evil spirits, goblins, demons, five direction plagues and poisons, spirits hunting in the clouds, floating and roaming evil ghosts and their bands, shall all from now on be destroyed; myriad calamities shall not arise, a hundred blessings shall be adorned, and eternal prosperity enjoyed. Those transformed by Jia shall be transformed; those healed shall be healed; those subdued shall be subdued; all together guarding and assisting. Jia’s commanded true celestial officers, each shall return to their ethereal chariots, restore the palaces, golden cities, and jade mansions, settle in their proper places, assisting Heaven and supporting Earth, fully arrayed within Jia’s body, numbering twelve million true celestial officers, each returning to their positions through vermilion gates and wondrous portals. Jia’s memorial ascends before the Limitless Great Dao. Having finished, bow again.

---

Then the furnace is rekindled.

Left and right incense officers, flying immortal post dragons riding steeds, incense attendants, flying heavenly dragon cavalry, etc., shall cause the spirit altar and quiet chamber above to manifest natural golden radiance and precious brilliance, the mystery reflecting jade and golden liquid essence; may Jia receive the Dao’s blessings and happiness at ease, the world receiving favour, the ten directions’ jade youths and maidens attending and guarding, incense smoke ascending directly to the Seven Perfected Sons’ opening of the Limitless Great Dao before the True Jade Emperor. Having finished, immediately withdraw.

Golden Illumination saith: The Seven Perfected Ones received the High Supreme Mysterious Register, the Golden Mouth Formula, and established the ritual and regulations, jointly composing this one scroll. The Mysterious Register’s運 (operation) ever follows the natural運 of the Seven Perfected Ones, assisting the Thirty-Six True Emperors’ proper governance, ruling in the virtuous kalpa; it depends on this. The ten directions’ Heaven and Man, if not knowing that myriad Dao have completed their勢 (tendency), will only regard counterfeit regulations as to be discarded. Thus the Three Caves shine forth, the True Scripture is illuminated and clear, radiant and pure like a mirror of the law. The right path is in motion; the law is riding the運功 (operation), thus the Scripture arises; the law and teaching prosper; myriad demons descend. At that time Heaven will not accept sacrifice, spirits will not accept worship, ghosts will not receive food, demons shall hide, evil and harm vanish, the six heavens are correct, the wild Dao is subdued. At that time, this is truly joyous, how could the ten directions’ Heaven and Man not rejoice? Now I briefly outline the later chapters to verify thus. Transmit and inform later sages, do not divide this scroll to distinguish outwardly, but rather make it into scrolls. Whoever offends shall receive punishment by the wind blades; take heed. If one desires to transmit, just seek this writing, and will not exceed the sect; prudently guard and caution yourself. The true intention of the Jade Emperor must not be violated; the Seven Perfected Ones’ Scripture Body dare not fail the sacred teaching.
