## Chart of the True Spiritual Ranks and Offices of the Cavern Profundity and Numina Treasure

### Preface to the Chart of the True Spiritual Ranks and Offices of the Cavern Profundity and Numina Treasure

To gaze into the mirror of the mysterious essence, to discourse upon the great and small that shine in the scene;  
To look down upon the level fields, to behold the loftiness and depth of the cliffs and seas.  
To search out the human bonds, to investigate the order of the morning spots;  
To study and collect the heavenly scriptures, to measure the grades and offices of the true spirits.  
Though the names and ranks be hidden or manifest, the titles learned and the degrees advanced or retreated,  
Within the Four Palaces, the doubtful and alike are mutually referred to.  
Now it is fitting to compare and classify according to the scriptures and standards, to collate the garments and ceremonies,  
To equalize the high and low, to distinguish the palaces and domains.  
Further there are indications of precise units, such as the Supreme Emperor Dao Sovereign and the Five Emperors and Seven Elders, as indeed to be compared and classified.  
Briefly to state the names, the example of Ink Feather Meng Zhuo is such.  
Or to entrust those of the same rank but different order, such as the Four Emperors of the Golden Gate, the Four Primes of the Supreme Ultimate, and examples from the lower teachings.  
Those whose offices and traces are distinct are the examples of the various ranks and orders.  
For instance, the Realized One Xilin is the Right Duke of Taiwei, and leads the Upper Minister of the Nine Palaces, but has not been entrusted as the Northern Banquet Supreme Clarity, thus is personally known here below.  
Examples such as these are difficult to verify conclusively.  
It is said that they succeed in the offices they hold, and follow from the higher domains.  
Briefly to discuss every matter in sections, to explain the later chapters.  
If by slight knowledge one belittles the lower-born and the higher sages, if the ascent and descent be disordered, the steps reversed,  
It will bring ruin to the Black Mansion, and implicate the Underworld Departments.  
With care and sincerity I follow the truth and open it to your hopeful illumination.  
If it should be found not in accordance, I pray for admonition and warning.  
What is now expounded and thoroughly connected is indeed the deep purpose of the notes, the essential point preserved and directed.  
I pray with folded hands and kneel to request that the dignity and rank in sequence be properly assigned;  
That in facing the true and connecting the diverse, the weight of the encounter be thoroughly examined.  
Therefore the Three Lords jointly disclaim, first to express the fault of the unlearned;  
The lower class dwelling on high, the wise in part obstructed in comprehension.  
Though all bear the title of Realized One, the true grades are indeed numbered;  
All are called Immortals, yet even among immortals there are orders numbering in the thousands of millions.  
If one does not carefully and precisely manage the sections and leadership, a slight knowledge of the origin of the lineage is like a rustic emerging from the court,  
Seeing a red-robed officer entering the Central State, and calling all alike by the rank of Captain.  
How could he understand the distinction of gentlemen and commoners, and the differences of rank and title?  
Tao Hongjing’s Preface.
