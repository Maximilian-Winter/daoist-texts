## Supreme Clarity Cave-True Wisdom Observing the Body Great Precepts Scripture

"The Wisdom Observing the Body Great Precepts" have been scattered through time, shining brilliantly through the boundless void, enduring over thirty kalpas. This text was received by the Primordial Heavenly King from the Most High Supreme Holy Dao Lord; together they ascended to the hall of the Cave-True, discoursing and reciting it, transmitting it orally to the Supreme Emperor of the Great Microcosm and the Supreme Immortal Heavenly Kings of the Great Ultimate, word by word without inscription. When the Supreme Emperor of the Great Microcosm received the precepts he recited:

> Wisdom arises from the originless,  
> Radiant and transcending the ten directions.  
> Binding the void and standing in the mysterious firmament,  
> The heavens embrace the flowing fragrance.  
> Its subtlety is beyond thought and speech,  
> The void perceives reality and is thoroughly connected.  
> Being is and non-being not being,  
> Non-being is not not accommodating all.  
> Wisdom ever contemplates the body,  
> The study of the Dao is first in this.  
> Dimly it lets the mystery loose,  
> Naturally recording my spirit.  
> The Heavenly Venerable constantly guards,  
> The Demon King promises protection.  
> The dazzling adamantine body,  
> Transcends before the Most High.  
> Wisdom gives rise to the root of precepts,  
> True Dao precepts are the lord.  
> The Three Treasures arise from this,  
> Revered and received by the Holy Worthy.  
> Spreading this immortal boat,  
> Swiftly crossing the great abundance.  
> When these precepts are spoken,  
> The heavens come to pay homage.

This Observing the Body Precepts, from the first to three hundred, is the Way of the Most High Boundless, named the Most Lofty Jade Clarity Wisdom Upper Origin Precept Chapter.

The Primordial Heavenly King said: The "Loftiest Cave-True Wisdom Scripture" is not declared to worldly scholars, all having passed on and already attained truth. Men find it difficult to see and difficult to exhaust in seeing it; therefore it is rarely seen in the world. These precepts are esteemed and cannot be spoken of. They observe the three hundred joints of the body’s various spirits; the true spirit must not rashly emerge; the demon’s test cannot offend. One who receives and recites these precepts, not violating them, may also without study emerge in clouds and mist; the blue chariot naturally welcomes him; the white sun ascends to heaven; the body floats in empty waves, casting forth round light from all directions, shining brilliantly through the Great Void, leading the heavenly saints; none dare fail to reverence him. The six heavens’ great Demon King then hands over the precept bearer to the East Blossom Palace, also called Great Brahma Heaven Palace; the Great Brahma Heaven Palace is called Jade Capital Golden Palace, where the upper immortal grades are inscribed.

The Primordial Heavenly King said: Reciting the Great Cave-True Scripture ten thousand times, the cloud chariot descends to welcome. The Lingbao Dongxuan Scripture contains words on passage through kalpas; some cultivate it but do not become immortal, and the golden elixir’s spirit is incomplete — why? Because they have not received and cultivated the "Wisdom Observing the Body Precepts." Therefore these precepts are the wondrous of the wondrous, supremely powerful and revered; nine hundred golden-hued immortals stand guarding, burning incense. This is the truly secret Way, not transmitted in writing, only to be recited and practiced. Those who study the Dao without receiving these precepts will never attain immortality. Some make karma, following sound and color; some begin diligently but end slackly; some enter mountains and homes only to be tested and defeated by demons; some generate strange thoughts, doubt the true scriptures; some return to the world and lose the Dao mind; some slight masters and friends, insult fellow students; some suddenly go mad and foolish, their nature and temperament reversed; some covet wealth and lust, disdain the Three Treasures; some have family disasters and grievances all gathered; some suffer nightmares and troubled thoughts, spirits gloomy and depressed. All arise from lacking the great precepts to govern their heart and spirit; the three poisons float in the corpse of cunning, the five organs know the trouble; thus the Demon King does not erode the spring and ledger of death; the three realms but pass through immortal grades.

The Primordial Heavenly King said: These precepts appeared through spiritual immortals, causing the heavens, earth, sacred mountains, and immortals to all obey and practice them. At every new and full moon and the eight festivals, at one’s natal star, on the days of fasting of the heavens, fellow students and masters enter the chamber and speak the precepts in a cycle. First they pay homage to the ten directions, one bow each way; when the heavens hear the precepts they all make obeisance. Disciples desiring to observe the precepts should provide five taels of superior gold as the trust of the Five Emperors, and ten zhang of cinnabar brocade as tribute from the ten directions. The covenant of dropping the hairpin must not reveal the precepts, but be offered to the master who has the precepts, fasting three days, reflecting on the essence of the precepts. That night naturally ten lamps are lit, offering light to the ten directions’ great saints, to manifest our mind. If at that time winds, rain, thunder, and lightning are fierce and swift, one should not receive but fast again, renew reverence and solemnity, for at the moment the spirit may open and the mind scatter. Observing the precepts for nine years, the spirit’s candle shines clearly; the sun, moon, and cinnabar radiate, golden form manifest within, youthful countenance fills the skin, spirit powers reach all directions, equal in virtue to the high immortals, entering and exiting without barrier. One who can observe these great precepts may bathe in the flowing pools, untie and lift at the jeweled terrace, wander and observe upon the splendid pool’s shade, returning to fragrant forests, golden light shining splendidly, from kalpa to kalpa, forever enjoying the true Dao. When the natal sun is at its zenith like midnight, facing north one recites the "Most High Returning Mystery Great Chapter," thus observing the Ten Directions Most High.

The Supreme Emperor of the Great Microcosm said: These precepts are named "Wisdom Observing the Body Precepts," also called "Scripture for Preserving Immortal Spirit," and "Most High Cave-True Life-Saving Elixir." Unless one has accumulated blessings and merits from past lives, extended by fortune, one will never see this precious secret. The East Blossom has no gold slips or jade names, and does not allow meeting this master. Those who can observe them, their destiny is to be immortals. Having scriptures but no precepts is like wishing to cross the sea without a boat, like having a mouth but no tongue; how can one cross the thousand myriad bodies? Those who study do not know to seek scriptures; those who know to seek scriptures but not precepts are yet to grasp the root of the true essentials; long dreaming without awakening, how grievous! Each should measure their own ability to observe, providing trust to receive them. Those who receive them will pass them orally to one person in nine hundred years, not exceeding one person; to exceed is to leak the precepts. The sin of leaking the precepts affects the seven ancestors, parents, and hellish realms; the body traverses the three paths, five sufferings, and eight hardships; kalpas cycle anew, the wheel turns to evil paths; the day of immortality recedes; enemies and creditors will meet in time; all should be cautious of their body.

The Supreme Emperor of the Great Microcosm said: If anyone secretly listens to the precepts, they will be pursued by the great demons, surely bringing calamity; no doubt. Those observing the precepts, dwelling alone in mountains and forests, places to be feared, sounding the heavenly drum twelve times, with heart holding the precept spirit, the precept spirit guards them thrice; demons, ghosts, and spirits dare not approach; blessings and virtues accompany; the heavens and good spirits each uphold. Former enemies and creditors are all born with compassion.

The Supreme Emperor of the Great Microcosm said: When I began to study, I only knew to request scriptures, not to seek precepts, thus cycling through kalpas of birth and death. The Most High pitied my Dao mind; the Holy Worthy grieved over my perseverance; they told me: "Though you study more diligently, if you do not observe the ‘Observing the Body Great Precepts’, how can you attain immortality?" Thus I bowed beneath the Golden Palace for three thousand days; the Most High bestowed the essential precepts; I observed and cultivated them; within nine years the cloud chariot came to welcome; the true persons of the three realms and ten directions met in the mysterious void. Therefore Dao study should begin with precepts; the Dao family’s honored root. The methods should be practiced and recited orally; the ancient saints kept them secret and fully recorded. Now receiving them is the same; do not let the text fall to the mundane.

Most High Bright Lamp Hymn:

> Have not seen such a lamp,  
> All should recite this text, not only when receiving precepts.  
> Knock the teeth thrice, gently,  
> Do not let others hear the sound; all teeth knocking thus.

Most High scatters ten directions, brilliant lamps link spirit sincerity,  
All heavens likewise, all lands resplendent.  
My body too shines thoroughly, the five viscera produce radiant splendor,  
The blazing light shines through the Great Void, far-reaching and full of jade clarity.  
The cinnabar essence lodges in the Great Void,  
The mysterious yang points to the empty midst,  
Containing form, extinguishing the root of suffering,  
Subtle and profound to true thought.  
Drooping brilliance is not real,  
Showing light and image according to conditions,  
My body is likewise thus,  
Riding transformation, entrusted to flowing radiance.  
Night light manifests the yang cinnabar,  
Far-shining into the spiritual chamber,  
The heavens shine universally,  
All darkness at once extinguished.  
My spirit is also clear and bright,  
Ever delighting in wisdom and understanding,  
Freely wandering to the Dao’s movement,  
Changing and flowing according to heaven’s power.  
Raising form, leaping the empty cave,  
Night candles shining with gathered radiance.

The Supreme Emperor of the Great Microcosm said: Merely lighting lamps without knowing this recitation, the six heavens’ demon abodes are but the destiny of death; the eight directions’ heavens do not send jade boys, jade maidens, or flying true persons to descend upon you. The ten directions and the three realms do not transcend the thousand myriad immortals’ name in the East Blossom Southern Palace, nor accept your seven ancestors’ birth Dao.

The Supreme Emperor of the Great Microcosm said: Dao practitioners who do not observe the "Observing the Body Precepts," though reciting scriptures ten thousand times and hiding in mountains and forests, their immortality is hardly to be hoped for. If able to complete the precepts inside and harmonize the light outside, it is close to the boundary of the spiritual mark. It is not that the Dao is difficult, but observing the precepts is difficult. If you can complete the precepts, I, the Most High of the Ten Directions, will lead you to ascend immortality. With complete precepts and reciting precious scriptures, wearing great talismans, if still not immortal, then the world must have no immortal Dao. My lament for the precepts is that men seeking them are hard to find. In the last days many rely on fame and fleeting glory, rarely seeing the true heart of Dao virtue; thus the Three Treasures lie obscure, the sages hidden; is this not a lack of Dao’s spread? If the precepts are complete, the great saints of the ten directions will naturally be seen in you; this is immortality attained without study. This is no empty talk; why speak falsely? It is truly to pity the aspiring men of the world. When conditions meet, there will be those to teach. You must encourage and exert yourself; once the immortal Dao is attained, what joy there is! Free and carefree in the Most High Jade Capital, letting go in the realm of nature, this is the joy before the Most High, even for ten thousand kalpas never beginning; thus it is said. Truly not words to be spread by pen and paper.

The Great Ultimate True Person said: I once heard from the Most High that reciting the Three Treasures Cave Scripture without the great precepts, how can the immortal Dao’s many wonders be completed? Therefore it is passed orally only, not declared in writing, so as to remain secluded in the Three Treasures’ garden enclosure. Those without the aspect of the Most High Immortal are never allowed to see it; only by the accumulated blessings of the seven ancestors, the flourishing branches and thick leaves, the dark功 through many kalpas, can one know to delight in the "Most High Observing the Body Precepts." Those able to observe these are then great masters of the Most High great law, the root of the Three Treasures. The ten directions all revere you in the cloud firmament; the assembly of immortals will lead you to the East Blossom, summoning the heavenly demons. The Demon King raises the thousand myriad talisman, commanding the three realms and six heavens’ spring and ledger office; the mountain lord, the earth official, no longer has records of death and responses; the Azure Palace immortals’ names are fixed here. You shall become a high immortal of the Jade Capital, a true person of the Most High.

The Great Ultimate True Person said: The Dao’s essence lies in practice in accord with the mysterious methods; accumulating goodness internally is sufficient; then one begins to enter the great Dao’s realm. Those unable to do so only toil vainly in dust and wind, of no benefit to life’s lengthening or shortening. The Dao is within me, not from outside; only compassion, love, patience, and endurance — if one can practice these four, one is a neighbor to the Dao. Able to be diligent and trustworthy, able to begin and to end, able to admonish and remonstrate, able to abandon lust and wine — these are the six perfections, also companions of the true. Able to accept wrong without self-defense, able to yield to others, able to relinquish desire, able to tolerate the unreasonable without contention, able to keep from the world and hide in seclusion, able to not violate the heart, able not to betray scriptures and precepts, able not to boast of precepts with the mouth — these eight abilities are also the best friends of goodness.

The Great Ultimate True Person said: The precepts as Dao are majestic and wondrous; fearing men have no heart to sincerely observe, they must therefore be secret and unwritten. Hence the Wisdom Scripture cannot be fully made known to the later students. It is passed orally only. When the precepts are spoken, the ten directions’ heavenly beings cross their hands in reverence and listen; ghosts and spirits pay respect; how can what is heard be lightly treated?

The Great Ultimate True Person said: The ancients’ Dao was profound and silent; still of spirit, mindful of truth, naturally unmoved; sitting forgetting the true Dao, they had attained the perfect posture, and were greeted by cloud chariots. Some rode winds through the void, drove dragons through the emptiness, leapt and soared without support, ascended to the Great Ultimate, embodied in the void cave, waiting for nothing. Thus their traces cannot be seen; the world does not know me, those who know me are rare, and thus I am precious — this is it. The seal is matched. If friends and masters rely on false words and obstinacy, that is not the ancient method, nor is it the rule of later students. If scholars desire the treasure scripture, examine them carefully; if their mind is enlightened, then in front of the Most High read the scripture, open and give it to them, so that they may study the texts and reverently observe them, thus conforming to the Most High mysterious methods and great law. If they lack the talent to spread the Dao,
