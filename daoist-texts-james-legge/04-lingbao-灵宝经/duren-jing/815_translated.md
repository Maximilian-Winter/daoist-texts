Title of the Scripture: Commentary on the Mysterious Scripture of the Supreme Grade of the Infinite and Primordial Transcendence of Men.

Source edition: The True Dao Collection of the Orthodox Canon, Section on Cavernous Truth, Category of Jade Secrets.

## Preface to the Mysterious Scripture of the Supreme Grade of Transcending Men

I venture to say, that exquisite jade mingled with dust must borrow the skill of grinding and polishing; sublime words concealing mysteries require the art of embellishment. Therefore the scriptures and commentaries can exhaust their words; the Book of Changes contains the maxim "Exhausting the symbols." The heavenly mechanism is understood; profound principles are thereby revealed. Reverently considering the "Supreme Cavernous Profound Spiritual Treasure Infinite Transcendence of Men of the Supreme Grade Mysterious Scripture," it is of soaring profundity, conjoining the vital breath, cloud-script forming the text, being the root of myriad laws, the chief among the Three Caverns. It is deep and recondite, difficult to seek and explain. If not already crafted in subtlety, who would dare disorderly arrange annotations? Moreover, the vulgar rarely glimpse its chapters, the profound doctrines strictly forbid fanciful transmission. Though one may recite diligently, none understand the essential principle; like ascending a treasure-hall with pure hands but turning away, tracing with ink but ending with no gain.

Therefore the Eastern Sea Qingyuan Zhenren, pitying this ignorance, widely proclaimed the grand voice, rejecting doubts old and new, establishing clear essential treatises, dividing into eight matters, explaining two chapters in detail. First to elucidate the cause of reason and nature, last to reveal the secret root of destiny, opening the blind and explaining the deaf, expounding the Dao and attaining reality, breaking the partial observation of attachment, connecting and probing the ultimate metaphysics. Sometimes subtly introducing similes, sometimes unraveling profound discourse, alongside the Compassionate Lord of Vast Eons, the golden mouth is not different; occasionally including matters not fully detailed, I composed eulogies to extol the meaning, so that reciters may thus diligently exhaust understanding. Then earth moves and radiates light, everywhere millet grains appear; by words awakening principle, all may immediately be freed from affliction. This is the origin of religion, and may be deemed the fundamental intent of transcending men; hence named Infinite. Printed and promulgated to the Daoist sons widely, carved and distributed, widely bestowed upon the unenlightened — how trivial a supplement to the world is this!

Thus wrote the Elder of Qinghe.

## Commentary on the Mysterious Scripture of the Supreme Grade of the Infinite and Primordial Transcendence of Men, Volume the First

Annotated by Eastern Sea Qingyuan Zhenren, eulogized by Elder of Qinghe, collated and praised by the pure and bright Daoist disciple Guo Gangfeng.

### Supreme Cavernous Profound Spiritual Treasure Infinite Transcendence of Men of the Supreme Grade Mysterious Scripture

The two characters "Supreme" cannot be fully expressed; the undivided and confused is yet undistinguished. This one vital breath is included within uncertainty, nameless and formless, containing the spirit of the true One, which is its image. "Supreme" means great, being the title of utmost greatness. "Highest" means honoured, dwelling in exalted position. Formerly heaven and earth were not separated; first were the five supremes: Great Void, Great Origin, Great Simplicity, Great Substance, Great Ultimate. After the five supremes were divided, then the Three Powers were established, heaven and earth arranged in place. The Dao is great, heaven is great, earth is great, kings also are great; the Dao attains unity and thus becomes great, hence called great. The highest gathers the essence of the Three Powers, hence called highest. Supreme is the ancestor of Dao and Virtue, the root of heaven and earth; thus the scripture's head is marked. Cavernous Profound signifies the grade of the Three Caverns: Cavernous True, Cavernous Profound, Cavernous Spirit. Also "cavernous" means penetrating and thorough; "profound" means mysterious and subtle. It signifies the Primordial penetrating the profounding of the one Dao without two to govern the spiritual treasure. The Spiritual Treasure is the Jade Palatial Dao Lord who receives the primordial one vital breath, transforms and generates the Red Bright kalpa, residing in the palace of Spiritual Treasure. Know that this scripture is the teaching received by the Dao Lord from the Primordial. Spiritual refers to encompassing and nurturing all things, transformations without end. Treasure means brightness and purity, precious to man. This Spiritual Treasure is the origin of all transformations, the chief of divine brightness, encompassing the heavens, generating myriad entities, none not by it.

Infinite Transcendence of Men signifies the Primordial Supreme Saint who from vast kalpas past extensively transforms beings, transcending the mundane and entering the sacred, count beyond measure, reaching from antiquity to now, the original limit. The foolish reverence it, the dull regard it as wisdom; thus called Infinite Transcendence of Men. Supreme Grade, as among the Three Caverns' thirty-six divisions, governing the celestial laws and treasury, exceeding three million nine hundred thousand in number, all regard this scripture as foremost. At kalpa end and kalpa beginning, uniquely standing in Jade Capital, hence called Supreme Grade. Mysterious means subtle and wondrous; scripture means governance. Scripture also means path; it is the path for human and celestial cultivation, entry into Dao and escape from the secular, ascent to immortality.

### Eulogy

The great Dao is extended and conjoined with cavernous profundity,
Rescuing men and benefiting things without limit.
Mortals wishing to become soaring guests,
Must for my sake purify the heart and read the mysterious chapter.

### The Dao speaks:

To look upon it and not see it is called Dao;
To listen to it and not hear it is called Word.
The Dao as Dao is clear, tranquil, empty, silent,
Inexpressible in name or form.
Even the Supreme cannot know it,
Assuming a name forcibly — how can words speak it?

Only the Supreme Dao Lord thoroughly understands the subtle origins of the Primordial,
Deeply cultivates the Spiritual Treasure Dao,
Assuming phenomena and transformations,
So that beings may comprehend the Spiritual Treasure, provisionally called words.
The Dao as words is like seeking fish or rabbits, which require traps and nets;
Having caught them, one should forget the traps.
Indeed the Dao is the fish and rabbit of emptiness and mystery,
Words being the traps and nets of the great Dao;
Originally Dao has no words,
Words reveal use, hence the phrase "Dao Word."

### Eulogy:

Dao originally has no sound, how can there be words?
The sage establishes law and forcibly proclaims.
Seeking fish must rely on the trap's strength,
When fish are obtained, why use the trap?

### Collation note:

The Dao De Jing says: "There is a thing confusedly formed, born before heaven and earth, and it is called Dao." The Dao is the same as heaven, earth and man; its root is in man’s heart, in the heart is nature. Nature is Dao, Dao is nature. Perfecting nature to destiny, form and spirit are wondrous, united with Dao in truth. The Confucianists say: words are sounds; Dao is the substance of the heart, words are the use of the heart. The Dao Lord expounds the teaching of the Primordial, according to the human heart to transcend men, hence called Dao Word.

## Preface to the Supreme Grade Mysterious Scripture of Infinite Primordial Transcendence of Men (continued)

In the former green sky, amidst the blue heavens, the empty song of the Great Floating Li land sounded, receiving the "Primordial Infinite Transcendence of Men Supreme Grade."

Formerly, in endless kalpas past, called former times. The Supreme Dao Lord says: I formerly received this supreme grade at the Primordial place. The Beginning Blue is the Eastern Great Brahman of the Nine Heavens. The blue celestial treasure agglomerated and condensed to form this heaven. The East is the beginning of all directions. The Celestial Lord speaks of the Spiritual Treasure transcending men, over a hundred assemblies, foremost at this heaven, representing the multitudes, honouring the meaning of supreme grade. This heaven’s vital breath is blue-green, transforming into blue mist, widely dispersed, hence called Blue Fall. The breath of Blue Fall is stirred by the divine wind, naturally forming the empty song, unfolding the mystery of non-emptiness non-colour, hence called Empty Song. This heaven’s realm is called Great Floating Li. Floating means void, Li means splendour. Its breath floats and is splendid without peer, called Floating Li. The earth has purity and impurity, but this great country Blue Fall Empty Song is the supreme pure realm, incomparable to the Three Realms. The Celestial Lord says this scripture’s power to transcend men is limitless, hence named "Primordial Infinite Transcendence of Men Supreme Grade."

### Eulogy:

Primordial first opened supreme grade,
One sound first issued to all who know.
The lamp of Dharma self-promises continuation,
Not only Celestial Lord and Dao Lord.

---

## The Primordial Celestial Lord

Primordial means profound. Profound one not two, profound beyond profound, the gate of all mysteries. Beginning means first. The Primordial receives the profound one, at the beginning of the Primordial, before heaven and earth, the root of all mysteries, the first birth, hence called Primordial. Heaven means the highest vital breath; Lord means the utmost depth of myriad laws. When its mist was not yet apparent, it stood alone, clear and distinct, heaven and earth relying on it and dwelling in greatness, hence called Primordial Celestial Lord.

### Eulogy:

Great mass first divided one breath confused,
Before heaven before earth alone supreme.
All beings do not regard as Primordial sovereign,
This thing from ancient vast kalpas remains.

## The Scripture’s Explanation of Ten Circuits to Call the Ten Directions

When the Celestial Lord intends to speak this scripture, by law he circuits ten times, widely calling the ten directions, before seating. Ten is the utmost expression of totality. By the method of utmost number, the spirits of utmost directions are summoned; how can they fail to appear? The vital breath transforms and responds, the response is so. Circuiting means universally informing; revolving means proclaiming in reverse and forward order; the reason for calling and informing is clear. The law responds and is universally applied; the Dao forbids fanciful transmission; all are the Primordial summoning of spiritual life and truth. If a man guards the practice of the Lord of the Embryo and performs the law of circuiting ten times, then the thirty-six thousand spiritual breaths will all assemble to respond.

### Eulogy:

The Celestial Lord intends to penetrate mysteries,
Law summons all directions to widely inform.
Just so the master descends to set the fixed,
Naturally moves and causes men to follow.

## The Great Celestial Spirits and High Saints, the Mysterious Practitioners, Countless in Number, Riding the Void Heaven

The Great Celestial Spirit is one who has transcended the Three Realms, without cultivation and proof. The High Saint Supreme Honour cultivates from beginning to proof, from proof to ascend to truth. The Mysterious Practitioner accumulates wonder to become true, naturally with the Dao. Countless in number means their multitude; all are Primordial flying, coming and going without hindrance, hence called riding the void. The Celestial Lord will speak the scripture, first dividing three grades; the high truth to encourage, cultivation of truth is in man, being essence, breath, spirit. If the person’s embryonic origin is fixed, myriad breaths all darkly conjoin, differing little from the multitude of the countless. 

Flying clouds and cinnabar heavens, green chariots and jade carriages, feathered canopies casting shade, flowing essence and jade light, five colours flourishing, caverns illuminating the vast space, seven days and seven nights.

The flying clouds and cinnabar skies, essence light five-coloured, all are the spirits of the High Saints. United, they form clouds; dispersed, they are breath. The pure yang is clouds and mist; pure yin is wheels and canopies. As for flowing essence shining with colour, five colours vigorous, spaciously illuminating the vast sky, all are wondrous transformations. In man, these are the flowers of the five viscera; refining them according to the method, the yin-yang numbers suffice, the Spiritual Treasure radiates light, pouring through the whole body, penetrating the empty scene. Three is yang, four is yin, united make seven. The saint’s light and scene revolve, though eons pass, never extinguished; more than seven days and nights, their meaning is the law of yin and yang.

The heavens’ sun, moon, stars and constellations sing sweetly, the Northern Dipper and Jade Balance, momentarily halting their wheels.

From the Great Luo downwards, heavens all have sun, moon, stars, transformations of primordial breath. The Northern Dipper is the ladle, the Jade Balance the handle; waxing and waning, disappearance and growth, day and night cycles, wheels turning without ceasing. Now the Celestial Lord’s preaching is in fixed meditation, hence the heavens, animals, and plants temporarily rest, demonstrating subtle function. In man, the heart is the Northern Dipper, the eye the sun and moon; heart and eye both fixed, myriad transformations never stop.

### Collation note:

The scripture says sun and moon and balance wheels cease turning; this is also a provisional phenomenon for teaching. Qingyuan’s note: in man, heart and eye fixed, myriad transformations cease; this is truly the gateway to entry into meditation. According to the Record of the Holy Lord Laozi: constantly practise cessation and contemplation to check the heart; this is the meaning.

The divine wind is quiet and silent, mountains conceal clouds, heaven has no floating obscurity, the four breaths bright and clear.

The Celestial Lord in meditation, myriad phenomena empty and original, yin and yang already harmonized, wind, clouds and climate naturally pure and solemn. But by wisdom observing the body, if conditions do not move, then breath of going out and coming in is calm and fixed; what breath is not clear?

### Eulogy:

Divine wind quiet and silent, sea without cloud,
Heaven and earth clear, the four breaths pure.
If one circumstance but lightly moves,
The Northern Dipper is again the wheel unceasing.

### Collation note:

The four breaths are not further detailed in the commentary. The scholar Guitang Jushi’s Record of the Great Brightness of the Buddha Dharma discusses the mystery of the Four Truths, citing this passage. The clarity of the four breaths is the four truths: true permanence, true self, true joy, true purity, to illustrate the mystery of nature and life blended; thus attached here.

A nation’s earth, mountains, rivers, forests and trees, all equal and level, no more high or low; the earth all becomes jade, without difference of colour. The assembled true spirits attend the seat.

By symbol, a nation’s earth is the Floating Li. From the Daoist viewpoint, all heaven and earth are the primordial single nation. Mountains, rivers, forests and trees, however, are not equal or uniform, flourishing and withering not the same, earth varies in purity and impurity. Now the preaching, all is equality, purely jade-like, without disparity. The assembled true spirits attend their seats, but only observe this function, what scene it is. In man’s body, mountains, rivers, forests and trees all are fully possessed; by fixed strength and one contemplation, all dust ceases instantly, equal and level like flawless jade; how can there be difference of high and low? It rests only on the heart; if the heart is not level, then heaps and mounds form.

### Eulogy:

One nation’s mountains and rivers are within the self,
In meditation observed, calm and level.
Pure as jade without difference,
High and low all from delusion born.

### Collation note:

The scripture says equal and level, no more high and low; and no difference of colour; these are provisional phenomena for teaching. The Diamond Sutra says: "This law is equal, without high or low." The Chan Master Huangbo Ye explains: if the heart is equal, distinguishing high and low ceases; then it is equal to all beings and all Buddha worlds’ mountains and rivers, manifest and unmanifest, throughout the ten directions, without the self and other; this is the original pure heart, always perfect and bright, illuminating everywhere. Its meaning corresponds exactly, hence attached here.

The Primordial Celestial Lord is suspended seated upon the five-coloured lion.

First by Dao law he summons the assembled true spirits, second by meditative power equalizes falsehood and truth. When truth and falsehood cease, finally ascending to the profound, this is the meaning of suspension seated upon the void and floating. Furthermore, suspension seated is unfathomable; void floating means without limit. Suspended means mysterious; void means empty. Mysterious and empty sitting, not attaching to true form. The lion is king of the hundred beasts, signifying the master of the law. Subduing the beasts, representing the Celestial Lord’s fearless transformation of men, subduing a hundred demons, leading to Dao realms. The five colours signify the five senses of heaven and man: eye, ear, nose, tongue, body; colour, sound, fragrance, taste, touch, the root of illusion; the cultivator must first subdue them and sit upon them. Though the Celestial Lord ascends this seat, his body floats in void; he desires men to empty their hearts and extend their forms; thus Dao responds and becomes the root of transcendence.

### Eulogy:

Dharma body deep and silent, originally true and constant,
Seeking form and appearance is madness.
An empty heart is the void floating seat,
Right intention is called king of beasts.

## Progress of Recitation of the Scripture

At the first recitation, all the great sages of heaven simultaneously praise with "Good." Then the nation’s men and women, deaf and blind, all ears open to hearing. At the second recitation, the blind gain sight. At the third recitation, the dumb speak. At the fourth recitation, the lame, sick and crippled all rise and walk. At the fifth recitation, long-standing chronic diseases instantly recover. At the sixth recitation, white hair returns to black, fallen teeth regrow. At the seventh recitation, the old regain youth, the young all become strong. At the eighth recitation, women conceive, birds and beasts bear fetuses, both born and unborn all obtain life. At the ninth recitation, the earth’s treasures exude, gold and jade appear. At the tenth recitation, withered bones regenerate, all rise as men. At this time, all men and women of the nation wholeheartedly receive protection and transcendence, all attain longevity.

The Celestial Lord’s preaching does not merely bethink the scripture once, but raises the great law. Therefore after one circuit, all heavens and great saints according to their grades receive life, with fear and joy, voices praising arise simultaneously, hence called "daily good." The meaning of the ten circuits is all the manifestations of the hexagrams. As the first circuit summons the East Infinite Infinite Grade Supreme True Great God and the countless flying beings, the hexagram responds East Zhen, trembling a hundred li, thus the deaf ears all open to hear. The second circuit summons the South, hexagram Li, illuminating myriad things, so the blind eyes are opened. The third circuit summons the West, hexagram Dui, meaning speech; through speech and recitation, the dumb speak. The fourth summons the North, hexagram Kan, meaning to stop things; since stopping does not mean ceasing but still moving, the lame and sick can rise and walk. The fifth summons the Northeast, hexagram Gen, the end and beginning of things, ending and beginning again, so the chronic diseases restore form. The sixth summons the Southeast, hexagram Xun, clean and pure, so white hair returns to black and fallen teeth regrow. The seventh summons the Southwest, hexagram Kun, nurturing and governing, so the old regain youth and the young become strong. The eighth summons the Northwest, hexagram Qian, the way of Qian, rectifying nature and life, preserving harmony; thus women conceive, birds and beasts bear fetuses, all born and unborn obtain life. The ninth circuit calls upon the earth treasures to exude, gold and jade appear. The ninth sun emits naturally, yielding the complete form; having obtained life and destiny, the earth treasure responds to open and manifest; all obtain precious treasures of gold and jade, transforming decay into wonder. The tenth circuit is the utmost number; the utmost reverses the old withered essence, regenerating men. If beings’ ears are diseased, they cannot hear the Dao; eyes diseased, cannot see the Dao; tongue diseased, cannot proclaim the Dao; feet diseased, cannot walk the Dao; chronic diseases cannot advance in cultivation. Hence the Celestial Lord’s four circuits of preaching smooth the roots and vessels. Upon the tenth circuit, one returns to the root and origin. The power to transcend men is thus complete. When function is fulfilled and Dao attained, illness is instantly removed, and all obtain longevity, turning their hearts to the realm of utmost Dao. The commentary on the scripture explains the nine circuits in detail; thus further notes by Xue Youqi are added.

### Eulogy:

The whole body relies on six roots to be whole,
Root and nature confused and diseased.
Only from the ear’s first comprehension,
Instantly free of sickness, attaining longevity.

## The Dao speaks:

At the first preaching, the Primordial Celestial Lord summons the East Infinite Infinite Grade Supreme True Great God and the flying multitude, floating in the void. At the second preaching, the South Infinite Infinite Grade Supreme True Great God and multitude arrive, floating in the void. At the third preaching, the West Infinite Infinite Grade Supreme True Great God and multitude arrive, floating in the void. At the fourth preaching, the North Infinite Infinite Grade Supreme True Great God and multitude arrive, floating in the void. At the fifth preaching, the Northeast Infinite Infinite Grade Supreme True Great God and multitude arrive, floating in the void. At the sixth preaching, the Southeast Infinite Infinite Grade Supreme True Great God and multitude arrive, floating in the void. At the seventh preaching, the Southwest Infinite Infinite Grade Supreme True Great God and multitude arrive, floating in the void. At the eighth preaching, the Northwest Infinite Infinite Grade Supreme True Great God and multitude arrive, floating in the void. At the ninth preaching, the Upper Infinite Infinite Grade Supreme True Great God and multitude arrive, floating in the void. At the tenth preaching, the Lower Infinite Infinite Grade Supreme True Great God and multitude arrive, floating in the void.

The Celestial Lord preaches, circling ten times, summoning true life spirits, bearing men and women, variously speaking repeated words. This scripture’s essential is transcending men; therefore first manifesting spiritual efficacy, next the unique appearances of confusion and response. The Dao Lord’s preface’s great meaning thus is not two but ten circuits. The ten directions’ worlds, all heavens and nations, all true spirits, infinite infinite grade, all receive the true vital breath, dwelling in the utmost great realm. Spirits dwell within, their transformed bodies are unlimited, floating void to the Celestial Lord’s place, also the natural vital breath of the Primordial responding and transforming with definite names. The East-Northeast high meditation goodness, infinite longevity heaven, brilliant jade perfect heaven, etc. up to the ninth realm, Zhen Gong Mao position, is the flying multitude. The South-Southeast is the Brahman monitor Xu Yan heaven to Red Bright Harmony Yang heaven, Li Gong Wu position. The West-Southwest is spiritual transformation Brahman assistant heaven, original carrier Kong Sheng heaven up to the nine lands and nine waters, Dui Gong You position. The North-Northwest is high void clear bright heaven, bright courtyard sky transcend heaven up to Kan Gong Zi position. The upper and lower directions’ nine winds, nine waters, many in number, multitudes too numerous to record, now briefly stated. Beginning at Primordial in the Clear Subtle Heavenly Palace preaching, then the Jade Emperor arrived at the meeting, raising six supernatural powers emitting great light, illuminating all infinite Brahman realms, dividing his body to show the celestial palaces. Now each heavenly palace manifests Jade Capital golden palace, bright precious seat. Each precious seat has a transforming Jade Emperor; each Jade Emperor in his direction expounds the way of liberation. Do these heavens each have a Jade Emperor? This is teaching to show the division of truth and transmission.

### Eulogy:

From the beginning spirits countless,
Like echoing sounds in empty valleys.
Ten directions’ sun and moon appear in the void,
Only for men’s Dao eyes to open.

## After the Ten Circuits Complete, the Ten Directions Infinite True Gods Arrive Together

All men and women of the nation turn their hearts in reverence; the arriving are like fine rain and dense mist. The flying multitude numbers half the nation; the earth tilts and sinks, not to be stopped.

When the ten circuits are complete, all ten directions assemble. Then heaven and men, men and women sense this divine transformation, turn their hearts to homage, reverently approaching like fine rain flying in the void, dense mist all around. Hence half the nation is so numerous. Floating Li is the limited earth; the Celestial Lord manifests the flying multitude body; with the flying multitude’s number confronting the limited land of Ze, reason is incompatible; hence the words of a tilted sinking form. Tilted and sinking reveal heaven and men have not heard the supreme principle; their hearts narrow, confused without limit, none can stop their stopping.

Then the Primordial suspends a precious pearl, as big as millet grain, in the void mystery, five zhang from the earth.

Treasure is what men love; pearl means pure, round, bright; millet grain signifies the smallest and most widely used things. It represents the Spiritual Treasure’s body and shape, small in use great, pure and bright, beloved by all. Also millet is the chief of grains, man’s sustenance, not to be temporarily lacking; showing men cannot temporarily be without Dao. To be apart from this yet live is like man without food, is it not not a body? Suspended in void, five zhang from the earth, shows the Spiritual Treasure’s subtlety, unbound by the five movements, hidden subtle in the great mystery, showing men and heaven transcend the five turbidities, relying on the subtle in spiritual void.

### Eulogy:

A single pearl like millet grain,
Everyone has it but not of Primordial.
Neither above nor below suspended in void,
Who can comprehend the Celestial Lord’s intent?

---

## The Primordial Ascends and Leads the Great Celestial Spirits, High Saints, Mysterious Practitioners, Infinite True Gods of the Ten Directions, and Flying Multitude, All Enter the Pearl

Heaven and men look up, see only the rushing sound waves entering the mouth of the pearl; once entering, none know where they are. The nation’s people collapse, disperse, the earth returns level, no more tilted or sinking.

To look upon it and not see is called "Yi"; to listen and not hear is called "Xi"; to grasp and not obtain is called "Wei." These three cannot be questioned, returning again to non-being. The subtle mystery of the Dao is based in emptiness and the celestial true body; how can there be obstruction? But because heaven and men and holy truth assemble confusedly together, even the earth tilts and sinks, none can stop it. Thus to embody transformation and transform men, suspending the pearl to respond to change, so the formless returns to non-being. Ascenders arise and climb; guides point and lead. The flying multitude all unite with the true Dao, hence able to follow the Celestial Lord ascending into the pearl. Yet heaven and men have burdens, cannot all go together. Then true and false bodies, cultivation and proof distinctions become clear. The Dao again hides; its traces cannot be pursued; spreading and dispersing, the earth returns level without tilt or sink. This all is the Primordial manifesting divine transformations, from non-being to being, from self to non-self, blending the path of a hundred spirits, incomparable to technical arts.

### Eulogy:

The sages’ nature is originally emptiness,
Gathering and scattering initially without sameness or difference.
All realms gathered in the true silent domain,
Where else may one seek remaining trace?

---

## The Primordial Within the Pearl, After Preaching is Complete, the True Spirits Supervise the Transcendence, and Confer it upon Me

At this time, joy and celebration are ineffable; the ritual roughly complete; the heavens return to their places; suddenly the sounds cease, the silence of the origin lingers.

After the Celestial Lord leads the true spirits to ascend to the mysterious profound within the pearl, he there transmits the Dao and preaches, conferring upon the Supreme Dao Lord. The true spirits all gather to supervise the transcendence; the Dao Lord receives this teaching, the joy difficult to express in words. The ritual means the law and order of conferring and receiving. The matter roughly detailed, not waiting for its end, the heavens all return to their places. Why? The Spiritual Treasure Dao is not in its complexity, but values its essentials; sages transmit to sages, one hearing thousand awakenings — this meaning is inexhaustible. Generally a slight has five sudden moments; in a sudden moment all is silent without remainder sound. This shows the supreme Dao again returns to the ordinary.

### Eulogy:

This spiritual root is originally free,
The Celestial Lord personally entrusts it to whom?
The dragon palace finds linked city treasures,
The golden casket securely kept not to lose.

### Collation note:

The metaphor of the pearl five zhang from the earth is explained by those who have attained enlightenment and cultivation, to show the mystery within the body. Five zhang means measure by length, foot and inch; this explanation is fitting. The commentary metaphorizes the subtle pearl of nature, its intent especially deep. Above it is said the Primordial leads the Great Celestial Spirits and the infinite multitude into the pearl, yet heaven and men only look up, unable to accompany, to distinguish true and false bodies, cultivation and proof differences. Those not truly seeing and proving Dao cannot enter the pearl’s pure bright realm; this is especially fitting to the meaning of realizing nature. Five zhang metaphorizes transcendence of the five turbidities, unbound by the five movements; this explanation also connects. When the final sudden moment, silence without remainder sound, then proof of self-completion returns to the One Non-being. The Confucian Classic Zhongyong speaks of utmost silence without sound or smell; Buddhist scriptures speak of emptiness of person and law, the realization of emptiness of emptiness; the Qingjingjing’s emptiness being without and the ultimate of no-no also means the same. Therefore these are attached here.

At this time heaven and men encounter the scripture’s law, all receive salvation, fulfill their original years without injury.

Heaven means the heavens; men means the world’s people. Here they are mutually said, heaven and men, to connect with the lower scholars; whether encountering or meeting, all universally receive transcendence, fulfilling their original allotted years without suffering premature death. Moreover, man’s birth is all endowed with wonderful Dao, precious beyond words, not by high or low, all living a hundred years. In man, doing good or evil only is the cause. Some due to former causes, some due to later karma, shorten their lives, cannot reach their full years; not that heaven has differential distinction. Generally man’s world lifespan is ninety years or more called upper lifespan; seventy or less called midyears; fifty or less are mid-term premature deaths. In Nanchang there are those who accumulate good deeds and obtain upper lifespan; when dying they first receive refinement and transcendence; if not, their bodies sink and await.

All turn the land in reverence, all walk with good heart. Do not kill or harm, do not envy or hate, do not lust or steal, do not greed or desire, do not detest or grasp; no vanity or gaudy display, mouth without evil words, all equal in compassion and love, differing bones become kin. The nation is secure and the people abundant, joyful and peaceful.

Thoughts, sights, and hearing are all called killing; falling into injustice, harming all things is called harm; destroying others’ success is jealousy; seeing others’ wealth and rising crookedly is envy; foolish attachment to appearances is lust; taking unjustly is theft; love and joy without limit is greed; unrestrained thoughts is desire; biting, spitting, skill or clumsiness is hatred; doubt and suspicion of benevolence and trust is wormwood; speaking improperly, shallow learning harming others is evil speech. Now the entire nation’s men and women have received protection and transcendence, so they turn the land in reverence and act thus, also called the twelve good deeds. Not killing and not harming and not lusting and not stealing removes bodily sins. Not envying, not hating, not greedy, not desiring, not detesting, not wormwood removes mental sins. Words without vanity, mouth without evil removes verbal sins. Before ears were clear and eyes bright, these are the six roots pure; now the three karmas are instantly removed, thus forming deeds of compassion and love. Compassion is harmony and gentleness without contention; love is mutual accommodation, benefiting self and others. The magnitude of compassion and love is such that although differing bones become kin, then the nation is peaceful, people abundant, mutually forgetting in the land of Dao and Virtue, rejoicing in the era of peace. Tranquil and constant happiness is called supreme; calm and without desire is called peace. The nation represents the body, the people represent the breath.

The scripture first issues teaching; one nation by Dao, with prior aspirations, all reverently observe rites and respect, all receive salvation and transcend the world.

This means the Dao Lord first received this scripture, instructing one nation of those with prior aspirations, all reverently observing rites and respect. To reverence means to reverence this scripture, like a boat or oar, like a bridge or beam, relying on it to seek salvation and transcendence. To observe means to revere this scripture, like parents, teachers, elders, in awe and love, fearing neglect and casualness. To respect means to esteem this scripture, like gold and precious treasure, like pearls and jade, cherishing it endlessly, fearing loss. Having these four hearts fulfilled, all obtain transcendence and longevity.

### Eulogy:

Tracing with ink to circle and patrol the form,
One must do good, act by rules and admonitions.
Longevity and transcendence require no other,
Only cultivation of a single pure heart.

## The Dao speaks:

What the Primordial Celestial Lord says in preaching is the hidden rhyme sound of the various heavenly emperors, also the taboo words of the demon kings, the hidden names of myriad spirits. Not ordinary worldly words. The High Saint has become a true man through penetrating mystery and subtlety, able to understand all chapters. When recited ten times, the heavens chant from afar, myriad emperors set rites, rivers and seas quiet, mountains conceal clouds, sun and moon stop movement, the Northern Dipper is motionless, demons restrained, ghosts extinguished, corpses raised from death, white bones become men.

The thirty-two heavenly emperors are their hidden names and rhymes. The Blue Emperor guards souls to the flowing bell eight strikes, which is the demon king’s forbidden name. The immortal gods descend to Tao Kang and He Yan, all hidden names of myriad spirits. The Spiritual Treasure is the ancestor of Dao vital breath, transcending men is the precursor of myriad laws; Primordial contains the wonderful Dao, issuing laws to transcend men, flowing scattered words, composing rhyme and sound, not comparable to later writings. Lower and middle immortals cannot glimpse its chapters, only Upper Saints and true men deeply cultivate Dao mysteries, then can fully understand the subtlety. The rhyme and sound spoken of are harmonious sounds and rhythms. Moreover, the heavens, emperors, sun, moon, mountains and rivers all form from the ancestral vital breath’s scattering into shape and quality; now the Celestial Lord preaches, thus the ancestral breath’s sounds gather and encompass scattered breaths’ forms, how can it not respond? Thus mist conceals, three scenes halt and rest, demons vanish, ghosts perish, return to origin, all correspondingly respond arising from fixed scenes. Like the summoning of yin and yang by the pitch-pipe and lute, it is necessarily so.

### Eulogy:

Thoroughly penetrating subtle mystery, knowing the Dao root,
Mountains, rivers, sun and moon, a single wind.
Not boastfully praising the Spiritual Treasure,
Truly the true man’s fixed realm merged.

## The Practised Scholar, Reciting Ten Times, then the Five Emperors Guard, the Three Realms Bow, Demons Lose Eyes, Ghosts Extinguish, Saving the Dying, Severing and Gaining Life

Such is because scholars’ defilements have not yet dissipated, essence not yet thorough truth, summoning and commanding the ten directions, might not yet govern heavenly governance, virtue may subdue and control terrestrial spirits, bind and curb demon spirits, only to repel death, cannot reincarnate.

Diligence and earnestness without retreating or turning back is called ultimate study. Therefore, upon reciting the scripture ten times, the five directions’ five emperors all come to guard, the three realms’ spirits bow and reverently submit, all demons and ghosts lose their eyes and perish. Now the utmost of the scholar’s cultivation is body refined, breath tranquil, all spirits guarding the body, never departing, called divine consciousness self-guarding. The three realms signify the three corpses; the five emperors signify the five viscera. If myriad conditions rise, this is called inner demons; when afflicted by suffering, called outer demons. The greater the suffering, the more refined the demon spirit. The seven emotions and six desires are called ghosts; vexation, confusion and overturning obstruct Dao and virtue, called spectres. With ultimate study and reciting scripture, all are not invaded. Even when great limit arrives, able to resist killing ghosts and spectres, may prolong this life; yet only able to subdue terrestrial spirits, only repel death, cannot extend this frame to longevity. Though repeated scripture recitation for millions of kalpas, it remains empty and void at last. For true men unite with Dao; ultimate study is not yet complete, reciting scripture then rank differs. Thus it is due to illusion and falsity, ultimately not true; small kalpas may be escaped, but upon kalpa end all is destroyed. Because the Dao is not complete, lacking true permanence, defilement not dissipated; body temporarily firm, unable to enter true realm; thus no power to summon the ten directions. Governance means the Seven Governments.

### Eulogy:

Escaping impermanence life prolonged,
Calculated still within illusions of immortality.
Shallow-rooted scholars desist from easy delusion,
Refining substance then expect ascent to high heaven.

## Careless Recitation Brings Disaster; Offering Respectful Rites and Worship Brings Prosperity and Protection Against Ten Thousand Calamities; Divine Spirits Guard the Gate

This scripture is honoured and excels in Jade Capital; infinite transcendence of men, the root of myriad Dao. If recited or received carelessly; or only for amusement; or with inattentive mind; or in improper teaching; or without selectivity in receiving or imparting; all these are light offences. For this scripture is treasured by myriad heavens, most urgent hidden sage’s true treasure, birth and death, warding off calamities and disasters, protecting and stabilizing countries and families, all come from it. If lightly recited, the body suffers disaster, disaster continuous and unceasing, can it not be guarded against? Also establishing offerings, respectful worship to connect with lower scholars, bringing prosperity and flourishing, with good cause green, ten thousand disasters not harm, divine spirits guard the gate, all these are common men’s understanding of the scripture’s universal merits. This scripture is wondrously precious, formed by Brahman vital breath, revolving and dispersing; though vast kalpas alternate, heaven and earth broken, this text alone remains, grand indeed, the great law of myriad heavens, who can describe its virtue? Jade Capital is Jade Capital Mountain, above the Great Luo Heaven, with golden towers and jade palaces. Secret true texts and talismans are everywhere; this scripture stands unparalleled there.

### Eulogy:

Immortals mouth to mouth secretly transmit,
Do not think lightly nor treat as idle.
All things change with mulberry and sea,
This text alone stands unchallenged in Great Luo.

## The Dao speaks:

Whoever recites this scripture ten times, all heavens arrive together, countless ancestors past and present, lingering souls suffering and vexations are all received and transcended, ascending to the Vermilion Palace. Those with the pattern of nine years receive transformation and rebirth, becoming noble persons.

"Those" do not distinguish by high or low. Countless ancestors from without beginning have gathered bodies and received bodies, nurturing parents, ancestors and forebears. When ordinary men recite the scripture, then the heavens’ emperors all arrive before them, responding to countless ancestors’ lingering souls and vexations, all receive transcendence, ascending to the Vermilion Official. The southern red heaven world has the upper palace of Nanchang, the Vermilion Mound’s manor, the court of flowing fire, the place of refining transformation to transcend immortals. Those of the world who attain transcendence pass through this palace, receive the three fire great refinement, furnace five turbidities of impure form, with jade eyes’ light refining breath and substance; next with yellow flower water washing the corpse form; then controlling and nurturing true spirit, depending on retribution and transformation to thus renew birth. The pattern of refining and transcending has three grades: upper study three years to transcend, middle wisdom nine years, lower study twenty-four years. Now by the power of reciting scripture, all ancestors of countless generations receive transformation according to middle grade, reborn as noble persons, again cultivating from noble to attain transcendence.

Those diligent in studying the supreme scripture, when their merit is fulfilled and virtue complete, all become immortals, ascending the golden tower, roaming and feasting in Jade Capital. Upper students cultivating this scripture all immediately receive transcendence, ascending the southern palace.

To love and not abandon, to remember and not forget: this is called diligent study
