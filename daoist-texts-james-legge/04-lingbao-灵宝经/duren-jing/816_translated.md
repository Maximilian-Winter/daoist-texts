### Preface to the Inner Meaning of the Supreme Wondrous Scripture of the Primordial Beginning and Infinite Salvation of Men

The servant Yingsou says: Carefully examining the *Lingbao Scripture of Salvation*, I have composed its inner meaning into a book, engraved on woodblocks and circulated among men. The Primordial Beginning of the Ancestral Kalpa is called the Former Heaven; the *Lingbao* is the original chapter, hence named Supreme Grade. The transformation of Creation as a solitary returning elixir may be compared; who other than the Great Brahman can encompass its scope? Having thus compiled and issued this, I dare not forget to make it manifest. I am truly fearful and trembling, bowing my head in reverence.

I secretly consider that the one truth, vast and profound, comprises both Heaven and Earth; the manifold transformations, birth and death, have the same root. Though it is said that spirits have distinction in consciousness, all fundamentally accord with the subtle mystery of emptiness and non-being. Why then do men strive after fame and profit, their will and temper confused? The source is one though the flow is divided; nature is near though habits are distant. All arise from grasping illusions; how can one know constancy? The five colors confuse the eyes; who is willing to return the light? The myriad changes are countless; who can reverse them? It is said the boat is safely hidden in the valley, yet the sun's chariot does not linger. Rather than lamenting premature death and clinging to life, it is better to cultivate truth and cherish fate.

Hence, our Void Sovereign Holy Lord proclaimed the marvelous Way before the Empty Kalpa; the Jade Dawn Supreme received the true explanation within the millet and pearl. The salvation of men is infinite; the measure of blessing is unending. The Great Way is all in the center and yet later ages, through ceaseless quibbles, regard the marvel as a golden lock, and the source of confusion as a fish in a basin. They speak of emptiness and purity, yet drown in bitter vacuity; they discuss cinnabar, mercury, lead, and silver, yet cling to solid existence. Without the creation of the Ancestral Qi, how could the profound subtleties of the Great Brahman be verified? Following the true scripture as the model, the mysteries flow forth without revealing their purpose.

In former days, the crow was not yet a horse and disputes were unavoidable; now, seeing without the whole ox, one perceives the prohibitions of knowledge and restraint. Turning the confused cart back to the southern direction, resisting the mad billows and following the lower stream, all beneath are led to climb to benevolence and longevity. I respectfully consider the Supreme Great Heaven, the Jade Emperor, the Most High Lord of Jade, majestic and immeasurable, vast and ineffable, impartial and unselfish, most profound and difficult to inspect, ever beneficial in saving things and never abandoning men. Thus, this humble and slight work is freely offered. Should it benefit even one in ten thousand, I pray it be examined with diligence and sincerity; if it adds no advantage even in the smallest measure, I beg forgiveness for my presumption.

The entire inner meaning is divided into two scrolls, engraved in blocks for printing and collected, submitted to the capital, petitioning for imperial permission for distribution, and humbly presented for report. I dare to offend the heavenly majesty. I am truly fearful and trembling, prostrating my head. Humbly spoken.

In the second year of Baoying, year of Bingxu, seventh month, first day of the cycle, the seventh day, hour of Gengshen, the great master of the Three Scenes of the Great Cavern of the Supreme Purity, servant Xiao Yingsou, presents this memorial.

### Purpose of the Scripture

The Supreme One is the Limitless Most High, the Primordial Beginning itself. Before father and mother were born, a point of true Yang essence, two Qi mutually responding, gave birth to two kidneys; once the kidneys are born, then the two eyes arise. Then gathering the five viscera, their form is complete, and thus the body exists. The beginning is at the cavity. The cavity is the body complete with limbs; upon descent to human birth, one sees the body. The profound is the essence of the One. Once the body exists, the essence guards the gate of origin; once the essence guards the gate, the Qi circulates; once the Qi circulates, the spirit is complete. The spirit complete opens the hundred orifices, and all things respond. The eyes perceive light and can see all things; the nose opens its passages and can smell fragrances; the ears open and can hear sounds; the mouth connects with the heart and can taste all things. These four complete, then the spirit is efficacious. Among all things, only man is most efficacious, for this very reason.

Yet, man is efficacious but not awakened. The reason men live long and do not age is to keep one spirit unspilled outside. Let the eyes not gaze on colors; then the soul guards the liver, solidifying the wood Qi, and does not leak out; let the nose not smell fragrances; then the corporeal soul guards the lungs, solidifying the metal Qi and does not leak out; let the ears not hear sounds; then the essence guards the kidneys, solidifying the water Qi and does not leak out; let the mouth not speak; then the spirit guards the heart, solidifying the fire Qi and does not leak out; let the body sit upright and the four elements not move; then the mind guards the spleen, solidifying the earth Qi and does not leak out. When the five directions firmly hold, the spirit, Qi, and essence blend as one, returning to root and original, returning to the root and restoring destiny, then all spirits gather and transform into an infant. Casting away the illusory shell, entering and exiting with the Creator without connection, uniting with the Way and conforming with truth, this is the treasure. Man who attains this treasure within the body moves freely in and out, floating and at ease, eternally youthful and unaging, resting with Heaven.

By distributing true Qi, one can transform earth and stone, making earth and stone treasures; by distributing true Qi, one can raise dry bones, making dry bones into man; by distributing true Qi, one can cure myriad diseases, and all diseases self-heal; by distributing true Qi, one can repel demons and evil, and demons and evil self-destroy; by distributing true Qi, one can move wind and thunder, and wind and thunder self-shake; by distributing true Qi, one can support all things, and all things self-thrive; by distributing true Qi, one can extract hidden spirits, and hidden spirits self-extract. This is indeed the infinite salvation of men.

The Supreme Grade is the Great Vehicle Dharma. Wondrous refers to profound and arcane expediency. Scripture is the path of cultivating truth. If one can recite its scripture by mouth and awaken its profundity in the heart, then in every thought there will be a mysterious response. As to cultivating truth and studying the Way, saving life and delivering the dead, all is contained herein. Practiced secretly, only then is the Way attained.

### On the Great Meaning of the *Lingbao Scripture*

The meaning of the *Lingbao Wondrous Scripture* is vast and profound; it is not difficult to explore for those who penetrate mysteries and delve into the subtle. I, a fool, say otherwise. Therefore the scripture says: “If one attains the one, all affairs are completed.” The Heavenly Lord would not make matters difficult to confuse men. For the common man, what is daily used and practiced is all this scripture. The good investigator is like a noble observing vessels; though numerous cups and goblets are arranged before him, he knows their metal. Why is it difficult? The one who poorly observes is caught by the form of the vessel, and how can he be free of confusion?

This scripture is but the Way; wondrously it expounds mysterious principles, secretly elaborates vast names—all are Brahman Qi’s root and true emptiness’s unfolding. Men fabricate scenes, scattered and difficult to enter. To understand this scripture, there is none better than to view oneself as equal to creation; they are so, and I am so. Careful observation and true reflection must bring accord. This is not only so for this scripture; the entire great collection of teaching is likewise. Laoquan Sugong said: “That which Heaven gives to me is no chance. That which Heaven gives is surely to use me.” I know it but cannot act it forth or tell others; Heaven surely uses it, but I indeed cast it aside—this is called abandoning Heaven. To seek fortune through humiliation and to seek the Way through smallness, what is this but profaning Heaven? Abandoning Heaven is my sin; profaning Heaven is also my sin. I often take this as admonition, trusting in Heaven’s grace, and with the instruction of friends and teachers, I have secretly perceived the root of *Lingbao*—this too is Heaven’s grant to me. Having attained it, I strive to practice it and dare not abandon Heaven. To speak in detail, I carefully keep it and dare not profane Heaven. Neither abandoning nor profaning, I abide here, rest here, cultivate here, hide here. This is my wish. If fellow travelers understand, let them share with the multitude; I fear profaning Heaven and so decline. They say: “Have you not heard of Li Guangxuan? Formerly he diligently sought the Way for many years. One day on Shaoshi Mountain he met a strange man who said to him: ‘You now seek the Way; should you raise the world’s men? Or should you only understand yourself? If only for yourself, immortals will not accept you.’ Nor have you heard of the fool of Song? Formerly, the fool of Song obtained Yan Stone, hid it as a treasure. A visitor from Zhou saw it and laughed, saying: ‘This is only Yan Stone, no different from bricks and tiles.’ The fool became angry and guarded it more firmly. If your words are true, then you are like Li Guangxuan; if your words are false, then you tread the path of the fool of Song. If you share with the multitude, the great house may correct your error, open your hole, and enlighten you; not only benefiting men, but Heaven surely gains from you, which is no slight matter.” Though I am not intelligent, I carefully keep these words; I also take the commentaries of Yan, Xue, Cheng, and Li, and gather their clearest points, coupling them with the words of my teachers and friends, appended beneath the text in small characters, to clarify the scripture’s purpose. As for the principle arising from images and images clarifying the principle, the scripture’s purpose and the elixir Way are consistent without difference, with appended explanations written afterward. Peering like a tube at Heaven, scooping like a ladle at the Sea, though unable to exhaust even a tiny mote, this is my measure of it. Alas! Confucius said: “He who understands me, it is only the *Spring and Autumn*; he who censures me, it is only the *Spring and Autumn*.”

In the second year of Baoying, year of Bingxu, seventh month, first day of the cycle, Guanfu Daoist Xiao Yingsou recorded this.

### The Diagram of the Mysterious Transformation of the Supreme Ultimate and Primordial Spirit in the Mixed Void Red Text

The Mixed Void Red Text is the supreme unexcelled truth; this is called the Limitless and the Supreme Ultimate. The Primordial Beginning of the Ancestral Kalpa transforms and produces the various heavens, illuminating the Three Scenes, which are the root of Heaven. Above are no ancestors; only the Way is the body—this is called the Supreme Ultimate moving and producing Yang. Movement at its extreme becomes stillness; stillness produces Yin; stillness at its extreme returns to movement; one movement and one stillness mutually root each other, dividing Yin and Yang, and the Two Modes stand.

The five characters open and expand; this is called Yang changing and Yin uniting, producing water, fire, wood, metal, and earth; the five Qi spread in order, and the four seasons proceed. The five phases are one Yin and Yang; Yin and Yang are one Supreme Ultimate. The Supreme Ultimate is fundamentally Limitless; each of the five phases has its own nature. They universally plant the spirits, no character without light, no character without brightness, no character without form, no character without completion, no character without measure, no character without life. This is called the true Limitless, the essence of the two and five, wondrously combined and condensed. The Way of Heaven is male, the Way of Earth is female. The two Qi inter-respond, transforming and producing myriad things. The myriad things produce and transform endlessly. The scholar should investigate its words and seek its meaning, so that the Way of Former Heaven is understood without planning, and the marvel of Creation may be glimpsed.

Therefore the Confucians understand the cause of light and darkness, encompass all things, trace the origin and return to the end, exhaust principle and nature, achieving the marvel of fearing not death or life. Laozi says: “Deep-rooted and firmly grounded, long-lived and far-seeing.” Each has its own root and master. How is this attained? The scripture says: “Know the male, keep the female, and return to the infant; know the white, keep the black, and return to the Limitless.” This is the Way of the Golden Elixir returning the Pill; thus it can be deeply rooted and firmly grounded, long-lived and far-seeing.

### The Diagram of the Form and Image of Yin and Yang Rising and Falling

**Parable:** This body is the furnace of Heaven and Earth; the central palace is the cauldron; outside the body is the great void. The official of Heaven is the marrow sea; the palace of Earth is the essence chamber; the spirit chamber is the elixir cauldron, named the Three Palaces. Heaven and Earth are the threads and order of the universe. Yin and Yang move within. Heaven and Earth are the great smelter; Yin and Yang are the transforming mechanism; one Qi is the medicine. All elixir refining depends on Heaven and Earth, the yin and yang Qi, moving and nurturing with the stars, forming the vessel of the cauldron; the Metal Mother dwells centrally, using wondrously transforming Qi, alternately inspiring and exciting, called cultivation. The Yang essence burns daily, true spirit transforms and produces, called the sacred embryo. The Yin strips away the pure Yang, called the infant. This is the so-called Supreme One containing truth, coinciding with emptiness and non-being, returning to the Limitless. The place of the spirit chamber, the mechanism of nurturing, if lightly dispersed, the oath and transmission fail. The master who instructs clearly points out, lest he mislead the aspirant and cause him to fall into the confusing ford.

### The Eight Rings of the Diagram

1. The first ring is the Eight Trigrams, representing Earth and forming images, each used mutually.
2. The second ring is the Twenty-Eight Mansions, representing Heaven, clearly using the heavenly movement to measure the great number, originating the heavenly beginning.
3. The third ring is the Thirty Circle Phases of the Moon, corresponding to sixty hexagrams, used mutually.
4. The fourth ring is One Hundred White and Black Dots, the Yin Talisman and the Yang Fire marking the water clock, corresponding to the heavenly talisman’s movement and stillness.
5. The fifth ring is the Twelve Trigrams, representing the progress and retreat of lines, the rise and fall of dragons and tigers.
6. The sixth ring is the Twelve Periods, the fire-hunting ascending and descending, gathering heavenly talismans.
7. The seventh ring displays the great number of the Zhou Heaven, corresponding to the four seasons and five phases, matching the inner image.
8. The eighth ring arrays Yin, Yang, Five Phases, and myriad images within the cauldron, assisting the metal, fire, dragons, and tigers; Li (fire) female and Kan (water) male, husband and wife yin and yang, copulating and generating true sand and true mercury, thus forming the divine elixir.

This diagram of the Great Returning Heart Mirror of Fire-Hunting was composed by the Right True One, Peng Xiao, to elucidate the hidden phrases of the Great Brahman.

### The Recitation Rules

There are five prohibitions and ten useless words.

The art of scripture recitation must not be unknown: purification and bathing, discarding worldly thoughts, desiring interior and exterior to mirror each other, this is good. I once saw the method of recitation of the Supreme Ultimate Master Ge Xian Gong, with five prohibitions and ten useless words. The noble seeking goodness, if able to follow these words, benefits are boundless. Not only is the body elevated and saved, but blessings flow to descendants.

The five prohibitions are:
1. Do not recite with the mouth while the heart is contrary.
2. Do not lightly disdain words and principles.
3. Do not create notions of self and others by oneself.
4. One must be humble and defer to teachers.
5. Be kind and benevolent in receiving and guiding, mutually clarifying.

The ten useless are:
- Not loyal to ruler,
- Not filial to parents,
- Not kind to things,
- Clinging to ignorance,
- Contending about self and others,
- Jealous of the worthy,
- Envious of those surpassing oneself,
- Slandering the good,
- Insulting the lonely and poor,
- Evil speech and gossip,
- Deceiving heart and harming things,
- Loving wine and meat, delighting in licentiousness,
- Giving rise to greed and anger, stirring hatred and love.

If able to follow these, what disaster is not eliminated, what sin not blotted out? The heavens record the name, demon kings support. Otherwise, even reciting a lifetime, seeking blessings and wisdom is unattainable. Noble and accomplished men should reflect and be cautious.

### Instructions for Reciters

Anyone may recite, regardless of Daoist or lay, male or female. Keep pure and free from distracting thoughts inside; outside, avoid rich meats. Enter a quiet and clean room. Arrange appropriate garments, robes and clothes may be worn but must be clean. Clack the teeth upon the central upper and lower incisors, sounding daily the ritual drum, gathering body and spirit. Burn incense, rich and fierce fragrance, communicating sincerity. Bow toward the four directions—east, south, west, north—next bow toward northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest, above, and below, each once. After bowing, seat facing east on a level seat. Bowing to ten directions is because of the scripture’s scope and connection. Bowing with body is less than with heart. Facing east is the order of ascent to Heaven, from east, west, and above. The level seat is the correct seat; sometimes sitting cross-legged or with feet down, initially without constraint. Then clack teeth, recite cleansing heart-mouth spells and body spells, guarding and adorning body and spirit. Then clack teeth and recite cleansing heaven-earth spells, opening the scripture’s profound treasures.

After these spells, open the volume and recite the scripture. Other rules and details are fully annotated and complete below.

## Scroll One of the Inner Meaning of the Supreme Wondrous Scripture of the Primordial Beginning and Infinite Salvation of Men

The Disciple Guanfu Xiao Yingsou Studies

Carefully following the *Lingbao Great Dharma*, clarifies the seven matters within the *Salvation Scripture*, broadly arranged: The Primordial Beginning Ancestral Qi, formless before comparison, what can it be likened to? Descending in substance and becoming Qi, transforming to give birth to myriad treasures, what form does it take in this world? Further, refining this Qi into treasure, feeding it to ascend to truth. Secretly observing the Former True Highest Sage, showing this one principle, truly the supreme opportunity beyond birth and death, the great essence of nature and life. If not the Way of the Golden Elixir Returning the Pill, how would one understand the mystery of the Primordial Beginning Ancestral Qi? Exhausting the subtle and recondite, tracing and seeking wonders, deepening divine grace, irrigating the field of the spirit.

The Supreme Great Cavern Mysterious Treasure Infinite Salvation of Men Supreme Grade Wondrous Scripture

This scripture is revered by myriad saints, admired by all true ones, unsurpassed, profound beyond profundity. The term Cavern Mysterious Treasure is the general title of rank; Infinite Salvation of Men is the title of this volume. The scripture is the model, hence called Supreme Grade; from this, the Way is clarified, hence called Wondrous Scripture.

The Imperial Composition of Our Dynasty says: The Great Change (Yijing) bestowed teaching, prior to utmost spirits; the Mixed Origin wrote books, based on the Wondrous Way. It accords with the unfathomable Yin and Yang, marks the indistinct silence hard to name. Thus it unfolds the action of non-action, displays the image of no form, encompassing the hidden and praising, concealing and manifesting benevolence; dim and profound, transforms men and nurtures things. Though ancient and modern differ in regulation, the true teaching leads all to one end. The treasure chamber and spiritual script, the bright platform and secret books, the myriad jade boxes, fill the elixir caskets. The turtle gate and rampart city descend from the high truth and grant; the red brightness of the dragon river flows with the kalpa’s change. This is indeed prior to sight and hearing, before name and word, assisting in perfect governance, gradually nourishing all beings. First emerges from the nine streams, advancing through the hundred generations, amid arms and strife, using it then who would delay? Insects and fishes alike are as stars, who can gather them?

The *Salvation Scripture* is the wondrous words of the Primordial Beginning, the precious proclamation of the Jade Dawn. The floating multitude’s true realm, recording the first reception of the words; the Purple Palace upper chamber, manifesting the concealed traces. Truly the hidden rhyme of the heavens, the celestial chapter of the Great Brahman. Eight corners hanging rays, from the divine pen; a thousand spirits arrayed guards, universally saving human spirits. If cultivating substance round and square, partaking of Heaven and Earth, few desires and little lust, turning from falsehood to truth, pure thoughts and fasting, cleansing heart and perfect recitation, concentrating and accumulating without dispersal, pure and full within, able to darken oneself and yet shine, illuminating all darkness. Like the white born from the void, like warm springs dissipating evil, happily ascending the spring terrace, crowding the longevity domain. Utmost sincerity, how boundless the blessings!

Ah, wondrous indeed! The *Lingbao*—some say Ling is holy transformation, Bao is precious and esteemed; some say Ling is the general name for myriad saints, Bao is what the saints cherish; some say transformation boundless is Ling, respectful esteem is Bao; some say Ling is in Heaven, Bao on Earth; some say spirits descend as Ling, Qi gathers as Bao. Those benevolent see it and call it spirit; the wise see it and call it knowledge; common folk daily use it without knowing. Therefore forcibly giving it form to correspond to transformation, governing things and benefiting life. Qi refined to essence, reaching formlessness, great to the immeasurable. If far fetched from things, near gathered from the body, then great is Heaven and Earth; subtle not departing from likeness; clarity is sun and moon, obscurity is Yin and Yang; in Confucianism is benevolence and righteousness; in Buddhism is wisdom; in man is divine Qi; in alchemy is mercury and lead. All things are embraced in nature and feeling; the primordial Qi governs creation; in reality all is Dao. Only the adept can unify it, yet they cling to illusion and lose truth, indulge feelings and pursuits of things, thus the spirit source is split and the marvel’s root torn, unable to return old to young, leading to decay.

Therefore the *Chapter on Birth of Spirit* says: Man returns to birth on the human path, washing the form with the sun’s rays, startling heaven and shaking earth. Noble too hard to surpass. Heaven’s truth, Earth’s spirit, the three realms all present, are not lightly treated; at the time of birth, not regarded as base. But man obtains life yet does not honor his Qi, esteems the form, treasures the fate, loves the spirit, and brings death and decay, departing from original truth. The *Scripture on Western Ascension* says: Born from emptiness, placed in non-being; born by spirit, killed by heart; accumulating Qi and gathering blood, forming my body. The body is the chariot of spirit, the dwelling of spirit, the master of spirit. At rest, spirit dwells; when agitated, spirit departs. The *Scripture on the Yellow Court* says: For long life, be cautious in the chamber; why die and cause the spirit to weep? Inch field, foot house can be managed for life; if flooding the sea, a hundred rivers pour. Leaves fall, trees wither losing green; Qi lost, essence leaked, form is no more.

Zhuangzi said: My life is limited, but knowledge is unlimited; following the limited to pursue the unlimited is perilous. Again said: Life is the gathering of Qi; gather is life; disperse is death. If the form labors without rest, it is injured; if essence is spent without ceasing, it is exhausted; exhaustion leads to depletion. The Grand Historian said: Men born are spirits; what they rely on is form. If spirit is overused, it exhausts; if form is overlabored, it is worn out. When form and spirit separate, death ensues, and death is irreversible, separation irreversible, so sages value it highly.

Contemplating these words, all know to return to root and source. Thus the natural Way of *Lingbao* and the great return of the Golden Elixir are sought by the adept, who are never wanting. The Supreme One opens the Way of guiding and commands men: Always observe the marvel with no desire; always observe the subtle with desire. The Buddhists also say: Men are turned by things; if able to turn things, then one is thus the Tathagata. Therefore Daoism and Buddhism, each has the principle transcending birth and death. Buddhism regards nature as fundamental, thus cultivates meditation; Daoism regards spirit as chief, thus refines the Golden Elixir. The extremity of meditation is silence in Yin; the extremity of the Golden Elixir is return to Yang. These two arise together but differ in use; all formed from the original nature, becoming true reality, not falsely made by external things. Spirit and nature can be understood in mind but not by principle analysis; analysis causes disturbance of right and wrong, differentiation of self and other; understanding brings accord of difference and sameness, without distinction of this or that. This is the supreme true marvelous Way; therefore myriad laws and thousand doors are all *Lingbao*.

The *Record of Mixed Origin* says: Since ancient times, Laozi and the Dragon River have taught by emanating bodies and illuminating truths, issuing true texts from the Great Heaven of Great Blessing, South Pole Red Bright Land, East Pole Floating Multitude Land, West Pole Xina Land, North Pole Yudan Land; these five all receive the teaching of *Lingbao*. Also in the Xia dynasty, *Lingbao* five talismans and true texts were given to Yu; also transformed the Hu kings, saying: “I dwell in China, always opening and transforming men by the Way and Dharma.” The king asked: “What is meant by Way and Dharma?” Laozi replied: “Way and Dharma are the Supreme *Lingbao*, born before Heaven and Earth, embracing all without exception, encompassing the subtle without omission. Heaven without it cannot shine; Earth without it cannot manifest form; spirit without it cannot enter darkness; man without it cannot be born. Therefore all things flourish and depend on the Way as their root. The snake obtains it and is a dragon; the bird obtains it and is a phoenix; the beast obtains it and is a qilin; those that obtain it become immortals. If able to cultivate it, one roams the vast void, changing the five viscera, transforming form, commanding ghosts and spirits, manifesting and hiding unpredictably, the Way of the Supreme Immortals.” The king said: “What you speak of *Lingbao* is indeed rare; therefore, what then is it that is obtained and cultivated?” Then it is known that *Lingbao* and the Golden Elixir arise together and differ only in name. The *Lingbao Scripture* is that which the Celestial Emperor of the True Heaven bestowed on Emperor Xuanyuan Huangdi at Emei Mountain. Also bestowed to Emperor Ku of Mude Terrace; Emperor Yu descended at Zhong Mountain; Helü secretly glimpsed at Gouqu. Afterwards, there were the likes of Ge Xiaoxian, Zheng Siyuan and their disciples, masters and pupils succeeding one another without break. This is the scripture’s meaning imparted by teaching.

### The Way Speaks:

The Supreme Jade Morning Dao Lord is the speech of the *Lingbao Heavenly Lord*. Formerly he received the scripture from the Void Sovereign Primordial Heavenly Lord, compiled it into volumes, stored in the Purple Palace of the Mysterious Capital, and the Dao Lord transmitted it to the Mysterious One Real Man and thus circulated.

Formerly in the Beginning Blue Heaven,

The Eastern Nine Qi, the Blue Heaven. Beginning is the name for the establishment of the five directions; Blue is the color of the East.

The Azure Void Song of the Great Floating Multitude Land,

This heavenly Qi is blue-green, the amber sky fallen, thus called Azure Void. The spiritual wind, jade trees, drums and songs in the void, thus called Void Song. The Great Floating Multitude Land is the Eastern Extreme Great Floating Multitude Country.

Receiving the Primordial Beginning’s Infinite Salvation Supreme Grade.

The Dao Lord said: “Formerly I was in this heaven and country, receiving the wondrous scripture from the Void Sovereign Heavenly Lord, broadly saving men and heaven, merits beyond count, truly supreme grade and true explanation.”

The *Inner Meaning* says: Heaven and Earth’s vastness, the minute like feathers, all limited forms and numbers are nothing but the body of Creation and production. The *Lingbao Heavenly Lord* begins the scripture with: “In the Beginning Blue Heaven, Azure Void Song of the Great Floating Multitude Land,” showing the beginning of Creation. Things are born from earth and end in earth; therefore the *Yinfu Jing* says: “Fire born from wood, calamity surely arises.” Knowing this and cultivating it is called being a sage. Within wood there is fire; if unleashed without restraint, ashes and smoke vanish, losing their original nature. One who can control it, even if fire burns wood to ashes, gathers and becomes earth; being earth, the original nature remains. The Beginning Blue Heaven is the place of harvest; Azure Void Song is the image of fire. The Eastern Extreme Great Floating Multitude land is all jade, always producing blue mist. There is also the blue forest tree; the wind blowing in the forest sounds like a cave, brilliant and clear in the great void. The Floating Multitude country belongs to the northeast Jade Prosperous Heaven. Northeast in the position of Yin is the place of fire birth. The blue forest tree blown by wind: blue is the color of wood; the character for forest is two wood characters. Guan Yin said: “Two woods create fire by friction; the tree is also wood.” Wood wind is Xun. The hemp-clad Daoist says: “The earth produces fire; the Qi of Li is nurtured in Xun wood.” Brilliant and clear through the great void is the image of fire’s brightness. The azure mist is vast and clear; fire nature is void and bright, like sounds in the sky. Thus it is called Azure Void Song. The Great Floating Multitude land is the root of earth. Earth is the basis of the returning elixir. The returning elixir is the way of returning to root and origin. The scripture says: “Attain the utmost emptiness, keep the utmost stillness, all things arise together, I observe their return.” All things flourish and return to root, returning to stillness is returning to destiny; this is the principle of return. The *Yijing*’s Fu hexagram is this. Return is the way of Yin and Yang’s return. Therefore it says: “Return to see the heart of Heaven and Earth.” Heaven and Earth are the bodies of Yin and Yang; the heart shows their use. Heaven moves and Earth is still; Yang moves and Yin is still; Heaven moves to the extreme and Yin arises; Earth is still to the extreme and Yang arises. It strips off above and returns below, movement and stillness wax and wane; this is to see the heart. Man is the same. The Fu hexagram is one Yang under the king Yin; its body is Zhen below and Kun above. Zhen wood is the Beginning Blue Heaven. Wood produces fire, Azure Void Song. Fire produces earth; thus Kun earth is the Great Floating Multitude land. Azure Void Song, in scripture terms, is the Qi and voice; from nothingness entering existence. In elixir terms, Zhen wood and Kun earth each have form, within which the image of fire appears. From this one can understand the scripture’s purpose; elixir Way is natural, conforming with Creation. Earth is the basis of Creation, thus earth produces metal, named void Qi. Metal embryo is the ancestral Qi of Former Heaven; hence “Receiving the Primordial Beginning Infinite Salvation Supreme Grade.” The Primordial Beginning is the ancestral Qi. From its own former kalpa, the indestructible original spirit named True Lead, it is the mother of the elixir. The *Dragon Tiger Scripture* says: Metal and fire are true lead. Alchemical arts clearly say that none is greater than metal and fire. Zhang Ziyang’s *Awakening to Truth* says: Fire is born in wood; wood hides the blade; without resolving and probing, do not force attack; calamity arises from this harm to oneself; one must discipline and seek the Metal Lord.

It also says: If Li and Kan return without Wu and Ji, though containing the four images, no elixir can be made; all because they embrace true earth, thus the Golden Elixir can return. From this it is clear the elixir way is indeed seen. Master Zhaozhou said: “The golden Buddha does not pass the furnace; the wooden Buddha does not pass the fire; the clay Buddha does not pass the water; how can they save me? If you want to save me, you must save yourself.” Therefore this Way is to return my spirit, restore my nature, and save my body. Man saves himself; none is without salvation. Initially infinite and uncountable, this is the highest vehicle. Hence it is called Infinite Salvation Supreme Grade.

### The Primordial Heavenly Lord

This is the title of the Void Sovereign’s response. From true arising and responding, it is called verification and cultivation. Marvelous thought is the mysterious source, possessed solely by one's own nature. The *Scripture on the Cavern Spirit* says: The wondrous image is formless, responding and manifesting with form.

This scripture shall be explained.

The scripture is the path; by it one can cultivate and attain the Way. The *Inner Meaning* says: The Primordial Heavenly Lord is the Dharma body’s ancestral Qi, the so-called original face, the indestructible original spirit named True Lead. To explain this scripture is to clarify that ancestral Qi is the elixir’s body. Laozi said to Master Yin: “If you can know one, all things are completed; close off desires, enter the secret chamber, refine metal and ingest Qi as foremost; if you can know this, guard and do not lose it.” Also said: “Red lead and black tin, the great elixir’s head; from red into black is true cultivation; from black extract essence, red extract marrow; resolve red and black, the incomparable medicine; using red into black to preserve longevity; using black into red is celestial immortality.” Also said: “One is lead as sovereign, two is mercury as minister. If lead is not true, mercury finds it hard to unite; if lead is true, it will not lose its minister. The blue-waist messenger, the red-blood general; harmonizing the two surnames, releasing separately but in the same group. White mercury is the brain, yellow bud the root; transform lead to powder, refine mercury into dust; Yin dwells in Yang’s place, Yang numbers Yin’s balance; moon waxes, sun wanes, cold and heat distinguish; opening and setting the Dharma images, brightly patterned.” Only our Way, Heaven and Earth long endure. Thus the principle of this scripture is visible. Some ask why the scripture only speaks of cultivation, recitation, saving life and delivering death, yet never mentions dragon, tiger, Kan, Li, mercury, lead, silver? The answer is: The Great Way has no fixed form; it uses things to manifest principles. It is like the *Yi* as a book, beginning with one Qi, dividing into Yin and Yang, hard and soft interwoven, changes endless. Fuxi drew it to clarify the Way; Shennong devised it to fashion vessels; Yao used it facing south as ruler; Shun facing north as minister; King Wen expounded it to exhaust the marvel of Creation; Confucius expanded it to exhaust the store of Heaven and Earth; Boyang borrowed it to expound elixir’s purpose; the Hemp-Clad One entrusted it for transformation. Partitioning south and dividing numbers, Ting spoke on nature and life; Kang Jie exhaustively studied Former Heaven; Lian Han fashioned the Supreme Ultimate. Some exhaust principle, some predict by divination; circle the marvelous transformations, no limit to one end. Is this scripture’s Way different? The transmission says: “Knowing ritual but not spirit is not a person of long life.” To transcend principle and enter spirit, mixed in Qi, acting without acting, this is the Way of our True School. Therefore Master Yin said: “Those who are good in our Way know in one thing Heaven’s complete spirit, creating mysterious supreme fate; losing it and yielding difference is called split sameness, gaining it and matching sameness is called different name with same purpose.”

### The Tenfold Recitations Summoning the Ten Directions

The *Inner Meaning* says: To speak of reciting scripture ten times to circle is to summon the true saints and great lords of Heaven and Earth. Cultivating elixir for ten months to completion is the operation of Yin and Yang’s essence and refinement. The tenfold recitation corresponds to the number five born and formed as number five. Heaven One is water; Earth Two is fire; Heaven Three is wood; Earth Four is metal; Heaven Five is earth. Earth Six is lead; Heaven Seven is mercury; Earth Eight is sand; Heaven Nine is silver; Earth Ten is elixir. To summon the ten directions is composed of the odd numbers (1,3,5,7,9) which are the heavenly numbers, and the even numbers (2,4,6,8,10) which are the earthly numbers. This is the wondrous use of the returning elixir. More subtle transformations are detailed below.

### The Primordial Heavenly Lord Ascends the Seat

The Void Sovereign Heavenly Lord ascends the seat.

The Heavenly True Great Spirit, Highest Saint and Most Honored, Marvelous Conduct Real Person, Infinite Numbered Multitude,

These are the five hundred million heavens, the eight-circled world, the three origins and nine saints,

The nine true and nine immortals, sun, moon, stars, and heavenly and earthly spirits.

Riding the void, flying clouds and cinnabar clouds,

Three pure clouds, rouge glow Qi.

Green carriage, jade wheels, feathered canopy shading.

Formerly the Queen Mother of the West gave scriptures to Emperor Wu; all official vessels and texts follow the Han system; viewing the present to understand the past, thus not further explained.

Flowing essence and jade light, five colors flourishing, illuminating the great void,

Flowing essence is the brilliance of sun, moon and stars; jade light is the immortal true round image; five colors interlaced, illuminating the great void.

The *Inner Meaning* says: The arrival at the seat is the Metal Mother entering the chamber. The Metal Mother in the chamber pursues the two voids in the Yellow Path, unites the three natures in the original palace, gathering the five phases, harmonizing the four images. This is called the Heavenly True Great Spirit, Highest Saint, Marvelous Conduct Real Person, Infinite Numbered Multitude, riding the void. The spirit governs Qi, Qi refines spirit, lead and mercury mutually attract, Yin and Yang rush and play, the Metal Mother shines in the spirit chamber, silver essence emits brilliance in the elixir room. The void chamber produces whiteness, spirit hall is serene and settled, thus flying clouds and cinnabar clouds, green carriage and jade wheels, feathered canopy shading, flowing essence and jade light, five colors flourishing, illuminating the great void.

### Seven Days and Seven Nights

The heavens, sun, moon, stars, the Northern Dipper and Jade Balance, all halt their courses at once. The spiritual wind is silent, the mountains and seas hide clouds. No floating haze in the sky, the four Qi are bright and clear; one country’s land, mountains, rivers and forests, all level and equal, with no high or low.

The heavens mentioned are all the thirty-two heavens. Each heaven contains sun and moon. Their essence and light originally formed, all are divisions and roots of this realm. The Northern Dipper and Jade Balance are the Big Dipper’s seven stars. The four Qi bright and clear are the Qi of Heaven, Earth, Sun and Moon. The true begets true, the holy bestows holy; thus there is the three lights and the breath of the wheel, the mountains and seas receive Qi, the wind master dares not sound his whistle, clouds will conceal no shadow; Heaven and Earth are clear, sun and moon bright, mountains and rivers even, level and equal. Since the wheel is halted, how can there be night? This is measured by the usual time, seven days and seven nights as a span. The mystery master says: This is great stillness, spirit light shining, seeing the Jade Pure realm.

The *Inner Meaning* says: The *Yi* Great Commentary says: Hardness and softness are the images of day and night. The commentator says day is Yang hardness, night is Yin softness. Yichuan says: Hardness and softness are the coming and going of one Qi. In man, the coming and going of one Qi is breathing. One breath out and one breath in are one breath; between one breath, Yin and Yang divide. Breathing out is bright, Yang, and day; breathing in is dim, Yin, and night. The seven orifices’ breathing is seven days; the seven orifices’ inhaling is seven nights. The Metal Mother’s work proceeds without moving the heavenly mechanism; spirit condenses and gaze settles, pulse rests and heart stops. Therefore seven days and seven nights, the heavens, sun, moon, stars, the Northern Dipper and Jade Balance halt their wheels. The spiritual wind is silent, breathing neither out nor in; mountains and seas hide clouds, Qi neither ascends nor descends; Heaven has no floating haze, false thoughts and vain attachments do not arise; the four Qi are bright and clear, movement and stillness, existence and non-existence all dispatched; to the point of forgetting form and ceasing thought, all things are emptiness, no self no man, profoundly the nature of being. Therefore one country’s land, mountains, rivers, and forests are all level and equal, with no high or low.

### The Earth All Becomes Jade, Without Other Colors

Before are heavenly blessings; this is the response of Earth.

The *Inner Meaning* says: Earth is nature’s clarity. The nature is void and transforming giving birth to spirit, residing in the chamber called Wu Earth; Qi responds and excites with feeling, contained in the cauldron called Ji Earth. Spirit pleased, Qi silent, nature again obscure, like flawless blue color, like true jade without impurity; thus it is said the earth all becomes jade, without other colors.

---

### The Spirits Attend the Seat

The *Inner Meaning* says: Will is undivided, thus condensed in spirit.

The Primordial Heavenly Lord’s mysterious seat floats on the five-colored lion,

This one is the Heavenly Lord’s Dao image.

The *Inner Meaning* says: The Primordial Heavenly Lord is the original spirit. The mysterious seat is the spirit chamber. Floating in void is the Dharma body. The five colors are the wondrously transforming Qi. The lion is the heart’s knowledge. The original spirit in the chamber governs heart and Qi; the Dharma body is void and silent; the heart’s knowledge is the luminous spirit commanding the Qi; the heart images the master; is this not the Heavenly Lord’s Dao image?

### Reciting the Scripture Once, All the Saints of Heaven Praise It Together; At That Time, The Deaf in One Country Have Their Ears Opened

The *Inner Meaning* says: Reciting the scripture once is Heaven One producing water. This is the Qi of Kan gestating in the gold of Qian. All the saints of heaven praise it together, the myriad spirits all flow smoothly at once. The men and women of one country are the Dharma body’s Yin and Yang two Qi. Deafness belongs to Kan, the ears. Man’s spirit and Qi nourish each other; when the spirit is dim, Qi stagnates; when Qi is confused, spirit is turbid; deep dim and dark, like deafness and dumbness. Practice leads to smooth flow, Qi calm and spirit clear, perceiving what was previously unnoticed; thus it is said ears opened. This is the beginning stage of entering the Way; as for bodily diseases, when encountering scripture and method, they heal; no annotation needed.

Reciting the Scripture Twice, The Blind Are Made to See

The *Inner Meaning* says: Reciting the scripture twice is Earth Two producing fire. This is the Qi of Li gestating in Xun wood. Li is the eyes, corresponding to the heart. The heart is obscured by things, dark as if blind; relying on the Way and acting, the heart opens and the mind awakens; nothing can conceal, right and wrong are known; like the eyes becoming bright, following the path to approach.

Reciting the Scripture Thrice, The Mute Are Able to Speak

The *Inner Meaning* says: Reciting the scripture thrice is Heaven Three producing wood. This is the Qi of Zhen gestating in Gen water. Gen is the mountain, high and thick with earth, from which springs issue. This is the explanation of Ashes and Gray. Speech is sound and voice; the nature of metal is present. Heaven Three produces wood, and reciting thrice makes the mute speak; why so? This shows the image of metal in wood. Metal is cut off at Shen and gestates at You; though metal overcomes wood, wood returns and gestates in the metal village. Metal produces water, water produces wood; thus metal is the ancestor of wood. Heaven Three produces wood, the third transmission of metal manifesting wood, like the metal in the sea at Jiazi and Yichou. Metal is in the sea, water produces Zi and Chou; water produces wood, Jia and Yi; Yang is born in Zi, three Yang grow from Earth. Therefore Zhuangzi says: “Bright and splendid, born of earth.” From below it is born; above it resembles Zhen and Dui, showing metal in wood.

Reciting the Scripture Four Times, The Lame, Sick, and Long-Accumulated Ills Are All Able to Rise and Walk

Accumulated and long-accumulated illnesses are traditionally said to be contagious and linked. The *Inner Meaning* says: Reciting the scripture four times is Earth Four producing metal. This is the Qi of Dui gestating in Kun earth. To rise and walk is the appearance of standing and establishing; wood nature is present. Earth Four produces metal, and reciting four times says the lame, sick, and long-accumulated illnesses are all able to rise and walk; why so? This shows the image of wood in metal. Metal is cut off at Yin and gestates at Mao; metal is the ghost of wood, gestating in the wood village; wood produces fire, fire produces earth, earth produces metal; thus wood is the origin of metal. Earth Four produces metal, the fourth transmission of wood manifesting metal, like the metal in the sand at Jiawu and Yiwei. Jia and Yi are wood, producing fire; Wu and Wei are fire, producing earth; sand and stone are earth, producing metal. Yin is born in Wu, three Yin descend from Heaven. Therefore Zhuangzi says: “Solemnly arising from Heaven.” Descending from above to below, resembling Dui and Zhen, shows metal in wood. From this one may understand the separation of metal and wood. Yet Creation is profound, not fully grasped by mere words.

Reciting the Scripture Five Times, Chronic Illnesses and Old Diseases Are Suddenly Restored

The *Inner Meaning* says: Reciting the scripture five times is Heaven Five producing earth. This is Li Qi gestating in Ji earth. All things are born from earth and end in earth, as above are the five phases’ birth numbers. Regarding chronic illnesses and old diseases, the *Daozang* says: Man is the spirit of things. Life spans over 43,200 days; its spirit is 36,000 original Yang true Qi. The weight is 384 zhu, corresponding to Qian. Not knowing to preserve and manage it leads to dispersal, hence the median way ends prematurely. Qian is six Yang complete and unknown in action and emission. Knowing this cultivation means being a spirit immortal. From fifteen to twenty-five years, emission without ceasing causes true Qi to lose 48 zhu, the remainder corresponding to Gou Two. Excess desires for ten more years lose another 48 zhu, corresponding to Dun. Not knowing to nurture for another ten years loses another 48 zhu, corresponding to Fou. At this point the Qi between Heaven and Earth is present; not knowing to nurture for ten more years loses 72 zhu, corresponding to Guan. Not knowing to nurture for five more years loses 96 zhu, corresponding to Bo. Not knowing to nurture, after 8864 hexagrams, the original Qi is exhausted, corresponding to Kun. Kun is pure Yin. Only grains and Qi are alive, hence called long life. Man reaches this, death is near; no longer able to cultivate the elixir; some are even more impaired, not reaching this limit. As original Qi is consumed and reduced, is this not chronic illness? Suddenly restoring shape means the cultivation of this Way, the true spirit daily strong, original Qi daily abundant, returning fate and root, peaceful and long-lived; this is meant.

Reciting the Scripture Six Times, The White Hair Returns to Black, Teeth Fall Out and Regrow

The *Inner Meaning* says: Reciting the scripture six times is Heaven One producing water, Earth Six completing it. In the north, gathering Kan Yin true Qi is lead, Qian and Kan unite and water is formed in gold. Lead is mother of metal, black lead and white gold; the whitening hair returns to root and origin. Teeth falling and regrowing means withered returning to flourishing.

Reciting the Scripture Seven Times, The Old Return to Strength, the Young All Are Strong

The *Inner Meaning* says: Reciting the scripture seven times is Earth Two producing fire, Heaven Seven completing it. Returning south and going to Li palace is mercury, born by Xun and Li uniting to fire in wood. Mercury is extracted from sand. The south is fire, mercury is also fire. Fire upon fire, the image of ceaseless blaze. The scripture says: When things grow strong they age, this is called not following the Way. Not following the Way means early death. If one does not know the Way of return, fire burns and smoke flies, no longer able to remain, how can one be strong and not old? Having attained the Way of return, turning and exhausting all use, returning and restoring origin, reaching the extreme and returning to root, thus old becomes strong, young becomes powerful.

Reciting the Scripture Eight Times, Women Conceive, Birds and Beasts Bear Embryos; All Whether Born or Unborn Receive Formation

The *Inner Meaning* says: Reciting the scripture eight times is Heaven Three producing wood, Earth Eight completing it. Returning east to Zhen is sand, born by Gen and Zhen uniting to wood in water. Sand is mercury responding to lead Qi and coagulating. Sand contains mercury substance, symbolizing pregnancy. Mercury meets lead and coagulates, Qi meets spirit and mixes. This Qi is not the postnatal Yin Qi of the body, but wondrously transforming prenatal Qi. The scholar must not fail to investigate. The coagulated Qi grows stronger daily, producing spirit Qi again mixing and coagulating, not following material transformation, nourishing the sacred embryo; thus it is said all whether born or unborn receive formation.

Reciting the Scripture Nine Times, Earth Store Releases and the Golden Jade Dew Forms

The *Inner Meaning* says: Reciting the scripture nine times is Earth Four producing metal, completed by Heaven Nine. Returning west to Dui is metal, born by Kun and Dui uniting metal in earth. Mercury returns to the earth cauldron and becomes treasure. The *Cantong Qi* says: When metal returns to nature, it is called the returning elixir, the so-called one Qi returning to origin. Heaven One’s water begins from the void Qi metal embryo without yet seeing metal substance. Earth Four producing metal is still a transformation mechanism; at this point it returns origin and restores nature, residing in the central palace, thus having the elixir body and mysterious image. The central palace is earth. Earth is the land; metal mother dwells in it; thus it is said earth store releases, golden jade dew forms.

Reciting the Scripture Ten Times, Dry Bones Revive, All Arise as Men

The *Inner Meaning* says: Reciting the scripture ten times is Heaven Five producing earth, Earth Ten completing it. This is Li at Ji, earth forming in fire, dwelling in the center as the basis of all creation and the elixir body. The Dao Scripture says: The middle is harmony. Harmonious Qi is able to produce all things. Heaven Five is Yang earth, Earth Ten is Yin earth, two earths overlapping, metal dwells within. Hence the returning elixir is called the knife and chisel. The wondrousness of the returning elixir is to return old and become young, transcend the mundane and enter the holy. Men of the world expect death; lifting their eyes they see only walking corpses. Having attained this Way, cultivating it brings long life; no longer the souls of earth and soil, is this not dry bones reviving, all arising as men? These are the five phases’ forming numbers. The Han Heavenly Master’s preface to the *Golden Liquid Divine Elixir Scripture* says: The quest of immortals requires wondrous words and reason beyond reason. Otherwise it is great indeed. Already contained in the profound root, not a hair is left uncovered. The Supreme One also expounds this wondrous Way of emptiness and void.

At that time, all men and women of one country incline their hearts, all receiving protection and salvation, all attaining long life.

Those who clearly obtain the Way live long without death. At this time, whether men or women, old or young, all receive holy grace and universal salvation. The living do not die; the dead are reborn.

The *Inner Meaning* says: One country is like one body; men and women are like Yin and Yang. Inclining the heart is like similar affinities. Protection and salvation is receiving nurture. Yin and Yang accord, spirit and Qi are nurtured, the body is secure and the Way prospers; this is the principle of long life.

## Scroll Two of the Inner Meaning of the Supreme Wondrous Scripture of the Primordial Beginning and Infinite Salvation of Men

The Disciple Guanfu Xiao Yingsou Studies

The Way says: At this time, the Primordial Heavenly Lord

Reciting the Scripture once, the Eastern Limitless Infinite Grade True Great Spirit Unnumbered Multitude comes floating in the air.

Reciting the Scripture twice, the Southern Limitless Infinite Grade True Great Spirit Unnumbered Multitude comes floating in the air.

Reciting the Scripture thrice, the Western Limitless Infinite Grade True Great Spirit Unnumbered Multitude comes floating in the air.

Reciting the Scripture four times, the Northern Limitless Infinite Grade True Great Spirit Unnumbered Multitude comes floating in the air.

Reciting the Scripture five times, the Northeastern Limitless Infinite Grade True Great Spirit Unnumbered Multitude comes floating in the air.

Reciting the Scripture six times, the Southeastern Limitless Infinite Grade True Great Spirit Unnumbered Multitude comes floating in the air.

Reciting the Scripture seven times, the Southwestern Limitless Infinite Grade True Great Spirit Unnumbered Multitude comes floating in the air.

Reciting the Scripture eight times, the Northwestern Limitless Infinite Grade True Great Spirit Unnumbered Multitude comes floating in the air.

Reciting the Scripture nine times, the Upper Limitless Infinite Grade True Great Spirit Unnumbered Multitude comes floating in the air.

Reciting the Scripture ten times, the Lower Limitless Infinite Grade True Great Spirit Unnumbered Multitude comes floating in the air.

The *Inner Meaning* says: With respect to the scripture, the Heavenly Lord reciting ten times summons the great spirits of the ten directions, namely the Three Origins, Nine Saints, Nine True Immortals, High Sages, Supreme Saints, Heavenly Gods and Earthly Spirits, all gathered to listen in the Beginning Blue Heaven Floating Multitude country. With respect to elixir, the Primordial Beginning recites the scripture, that is the True Lead as the ancestral medicine, the Mysterious Essence as the elixir base. The ten times corresponds to the number of Heaven and Earth’s generation. The ten directions correspond to the number of the five phases paired. Odd numbers 1,3,5,7,9 are heavenly numbers, totaling twenty-five, Yang essence. Even numbers 2,4,6,8,10 are earthly numbers, thirty, Yin essence. Numbers 1 to 5 correspond to the four proper upper directions; 6 to 10 correspond to the four corner lower directions. Yang’s generating number is five, the basis of the five phases. Yin’s completing number is ten, the root of myriad transformations. Numbers 1 and 9, 4 and 6 each combine to ten, metal and water sharing the same root; 2 and 8, 3 and 7 combine to ten, wood and fire sharing the same body. In summary, the total is fifty-five, divided among the five directions. One and six are in the north, two and seven in the south, three and eight in the east, four and nine in the west, five and ten in the center. Dividing by law, the five directions remove 1,2,3,4,5, yielding the origins of water, fire, wood, metal, and earth. Removing 1 to 5 also yields the basis of the five phases. Excluding the five directions, each remains with five numbers, together twenty-five, the root of the five phases, the body of true Yang Wu Earth. Dividing the root number twenty-five by the basis of the five directions—north 1, south 2, east 3, west 4, center 5—one sees the north remains four numbers, symbolizing metal; metal originally produces water. Metal returns from water and is born, like lead from silver Qi; silver born in lead is child giving birth to mother. Metal is tiger. Metal in water is tiger birthing in water. South remains three numbers, symbolizing wood; wood originally produces fire, wood returns from fire and is born, like mercury responding to lead Qi to coagulate sand; sand comes from mercury, child giving birth to mother. Wood is dragon. Dragon emerges wrapped in fire. East remains two numbers, symbolizing fire; fire is born from wood, mercury extracted from sand; this is the seven returns of cinnabar returning to root. West remains one number, symbolizing water; water is born from metal, one Qi returning to origin, this is the nine returns of golden liquid returning to truth. The center is void, the four images combine to form ten, showing the true Yin Ji Earth’s natural wondrous use. Therefore Zhang Ziyang says: “The Zhen Dragon Mercury emerges from the Li village; the Dui Tiger Lead is born in the Kan place. These two things are total child giving birth to mother; the five phases must all enter the center.” He also says: “The Red Dragon and Black Tiger are at west and east; the four images intersect in Wu and Ji. From here Gou is able to operate; who says the Golden Elixir does not succeed?” The Supreme One Real Person says: “The five phases reversed, the dragon emerges from fire; the five phases not in order, the tiger is born in water; this is so.” The Infinite Great Spirits arriving are the traces of true and pure movement of Heaven and Earth, forming the Dharma images, dividing the 384 lines, cycling within fire, moving the five stars and twenty-eight mansions, circling within the cauldron, compressing the 3600 correct Qi, turning the seventy-two periods’ key passes, driving the sixty-four hexagrams’ Yin talismans, beating the twenty-four Qi’s Yang fire. Subtle and detailed, seen in the secret language of the Heart Mirror. Therefore Heaven and Earth cannot conceal the mechanism of Creation; Yin and Yang cannot hide the root of nurturing. Hence spirit transformations are without form, pure and true, fully within the grasp, mixed in the void cavity.

Some ask: Cheng Yichuan says: “The sage does not depend on immortals, his arts differ. Can the sage do such things?” It is said: “This is a thief in Heaven and Earth; if not stealing Creation’s mechanism, how can he prolong life?” Therefore the *Yinfu Jing* says: “Man is the thief of all things.” To steal creation and rob myriad things is to own all within Heaven and Earth; taking without restriction and using without depletion.

When tenfold recitation is complete, the true great spirits of the ten directions all arrive simultaneously. Men and women of one country incline their hearts and offer homage; those who come are as fine rain and dense mist. The multitude of unnumbered spirits reaches half the country; the earth is all inclined and sunken, which cannot be stopped.

The Heavenly Lord opens the country; myriad saints are all assembled, their might and virtue revered and weighty, greatly burdened and unable to bear, hence the inclination and sinking. Where there is extraordinary matter, there is extraordinary response. Master Niutou Fa-rong lectured on the *Great Prajna Sutra*; when reaching the chapter on Stillness, the earth even trembled; much more so the Void Sovereign manifesting creation!

The *Inner Meaning* says: When the tenfold recitation ends and the great spirits of the ten directions all arrive simultaneously, spirit rests and condenses, Qi returns to the chamber. Men and women of one country incline their hearts and offer homage; the body’s Yin and Yang Qi mix and melt. The gathering of spirit and Qi is dense and fragrant. The *Cantong Qi* says: “Golden sand enters the five viscera; mist disperses like wind and rain.” Metal is Heaven and Earth’s utmost essence, the spirit; sand is the pure essence of Yin and Yang, the Qi. Therefore it says: “Those who come are like fine rain and dense mist; the multitude of unnumbered spirits reaches the golden essence at the elbow, true Qi passes Yang pass, thus nature and feeling mutually conflict, Heaven’s mechanism silently moves, Yin and Yang stimulate, true spirit transforms and produces.” Though it is said that form is natural and operation spontaneous, still there are changes of agitation overcoming cold and stillness overcoming heat; this is because of holding and filling; nature and feeling are not yet bright. Nature and feeling belong to earth, hence it says half the country sunk, the earth all inclined and sunken, which cannot be stopped.

### The Primordial Beginning Suspends a Treasure Pearl

As large as a millet seed, it hangs in the void mystery, five zhang above the earth.

The treasure pearl symbolizes the Way, suspended in the void mystery; likewise the meaning of the mysterious pearl. Inside transmission scripture, pearl within pearl, mystery within mystery, truth within truth, Way within Way. Five zhang above the earth causes men to remove the five turbidities of the world, to escape the use of the five phases. The five turbidities all arise, so no more manifold calamities; the five phases not used, forever free from mutual conflict. Therefore the five phases do not conflict; all things may be preserved intact, naturally long-lived and far-seeing, attaining the Way and becoming true. The mystery master says: This is the Jade Pure treasure pearl, the Way of spirit transformation and embryo immortals.

The *Inner Meaning* says: The Primordial Beginning suspending the pearl is spirit united with Dao. Previously said the scripture’s lion throne is the spirit condensed in chamber, from nothing seeking existence. Now this suspended pearl in the void mystery transcends spirit and material, beyond existence entering non-being. The Heavenly Lord worries that later generations of inferior scholars do not reach this principle, only clinging to stubborn emptiness; thus manifests the wondrous transformation, clarifying that within the utmost void there is utmost truth and utmost essence. The scripture says: “Dim and dark, inside is essence; the essence is very true, inside is trust.” In principle, it is spirit’s dark nature returning, extremely bright and clear, open without cover, void without base. Radiant and joyful, dim and silent, certainly not the numbers of the five phases can be grasped, nor the realm of five turbidities mixed. Master Chuan says: “Both appearance and seeking are false; formless and invisible fall to partial withering. Lofty and dense, never apart; one Way’s cold light shines through the great void.”

The Primordial Beginning ascends and summons the Heavenly True Great Spirit, Highest Saint and Most Honored, Marvelous Conduct Real Person, the unnumbered multitude of the ten directions, all enter the treasure pearl. The heavens and men look up, only seeing the multitude enter the pearl’s mouth; once entering, none know its location.

The Heavenly Lord deploys the profound wondrous great transformation; the pearl hangs in the void mystery, its suspension incomprehensible. Ascending, he summons the Three Origins, Nine Saints, Nine True Immortals, all entering therein. All the heavenly men except the Heavenly True Supreme Saints and Real Persons find it difficult to follow the spontaneous transforming mechanism, unable to enter the marvel of the void mystery, only looking on. Seeing the multitude enter the pearl mouth, once in the mouth, none know where. Moreover, as the lesser immortals have the marvel of containing Sumeru in a mustard seed, a pot suspending heaven and earth, how much more the great saintly Heavenly Lord manifesting great transformation and divine change.

Saying the pearl is as large as a millet seed is already subtle; having it five zhang away, able to see the pearl in the void mystery, if not heavenly men, none have such wisdom; how much more to see its mouth is indeed the Heavenly Lord ascending and guiding saints into the marvelous realm of being and non-being. At the time entering the pearl with the Heavenly Lord, the heavenly men look up and see them enter the pearl, unable to see the secret marvel transformations within.

The *Inner Meaning* says: The true spirit once dim, Qi also follows silence, accords with emptiness and unbeing, ascends to the marvelous and enters the wonderful. So gathering myriad things in one breath, dispersing one breath in myriad things. Welcoming it one sees no head, following it one sees no rear. Its coming has no source, its going no place.

### The People of the Country Scatter and Move; The Earth Returns to Level and Stillness; No More Inclination or Sinking

The *Inner Meaning* says: Forgetting movement and stillness, dispatching existence and non-existence.

The Primordial Beginning speaks within the pearl, the scripture all completed.

The *Inner Meaning* says: The Primordial Beginning is spirit pearl, the nature. Speaking scripture means pointing out ancestral Qi as elixir body. The scripture complete means spirit and nature perfectly bright, without one thing.

The myriad spirits supervise salvation, conferring it upon me.

The *Inner Meaning* says: The myriad spirits are the wondrously transforming and producing Qi. I am the Dao Lord.

At this time, the joy and celebration are beyond words. The ritual is roughly complete; the heavens return to their places. In the blink of an eye, silence without echo.

The *Inner Meaning* says: At the time of cultivation, wondrous responses are hard to describe. Like a man drinking water, cold or warm he knows. When the work is done, myriad spirits return to origin; in the midst of vague dream, the remaining brightness ceases to shine.

At this time the heavenly men encounter scripture and method, universally obtaining salvation, completing their original years without injury.

The *Inner Meaning* says: Examining ancient and present, their principle is not distant. Scripture, method, and elixir Way are one in principle. The Sixth Patriarch said: “Now I speak the Dharma like timely rain, broadly moistening the great earth. Your Buddha nature is like seeds; encountering this moisture, all sprout.” This is the principle of encountering scripture and method, universally obtaining salvation. The inner image forms the body; this is the meaning. Those who obtain it know its spirit and love it; understand its Qi and treasure it; can complete their original years without injury. The original years mean not meeting sudden calamities; if one takes a step upward, one must advance.

The earth inclines with homage, all practicing the heart of goodness. Do not kill or harm; do not envy or resent; do not commit licentiousness or theft; do not greed or desire; do not hate or slander; speech without flowery words; mouth without evil sounds; all with sameness of kindness, different bones become relatives.

The *Breaking Fate* says: Killing and wounding are harm; hating others’ success is jealousy; hating peers is resentment; men and women not interacting with propriety is licentiousness; stealing others’ possessions is theft; insatiability is greed; craving is desire; disliking others is hate; suspicion is jealousy. When the ten evils are eliminated, different bones become kin, myriad deeds become one, voices without irritation. The section on licentiousness means men and women not meeting properly, to correct human relations. Cultivators should cut off this desire; hence the *Taiwei Ling Shu* lists licentious desire as the prime of ten defeats. Formerly the Lord of Purple Emptiness and Lord Mao collated the merits and losses of all true immortals in the world; forty-seven were immediately struck down, only two restored; all because of hearts holding licentious desire, practicing true Way is not only immediate loss but also trial at the Three Officials. Those seeking long life, how can they not cut off this thought? The section on theft is not only stealing others’ things but receiving without Dao; all are the same. Desire is not only craving but private self. The Supreme One said: “No greater sin than desire; no greater fault than covetousness.” Once desire arises, then the above evils arise. All this causes disorder in the state, loss of peace among myriad beings; the heart of profit and use must not be ignored!

The *Inner Meaning* says: The human heart is all good, none is evil; due to worldly desires it is obscured, losing its beginning. Once hearing the Way’s essentials, all evils melt away, self and other are one, relatives and strangers have no barrier. The above matters are detailed in the *Reflection on Response* chapter, the daily errors of worldly men. The Shu scholar Li Changling explained the ten thousand words of retribution and cause, reading which one shudders; even the slightest selfishness is not allowed to arise; beneficial to the world’s teaching. Contemplating the scripture’s meaning, saying all practice goodness, do not kill or harm, etc., means completely eliminating evil thoughts. If even the slightest evil thought lurks in the heart, it cannot be called goodness. Why? Jade with a slight flaw can it be called fine jade? Good and evil are not seen in deeds; once a thought arises, spirit and brightness have recorded it. Formerly Wei Zhongda was a hall officer, taken to the underworld court; the underworld official ordered attendants to present his good and evil records. On arrival, the evil record filled the hall, the good record was like a stick. The official changed color, weighing the scales; the small axis was able to outweigh the evil record, causing the earth to move. The official rejoiced and said: “You may leave.” Wei said: “I am not yet forty years old; how can I have so much evil?” The official said: “No, it’s because your thoughts are not correct; this is written, no need for commission.” Wei said: “Then what does the small axis record?” The official said: “You once advised the court to cease great works, building the Three Mountains and stone bridges; your memorial is the remonstrance.” Wei said: “Though I said so, the court did not listen at first; what benefit is there, and how can there be such power?” The official said: “Though the court did not listen, your thought was on the ruler; this is enough. If they had listened, your good power would be far greater. You would see arising through this the salvation of the world; how then can they detain you? But alas, too many evil thoughts have halved your power; no hope for great success.” Alas, having such thoughts, even they reduce blessings; how much more if truly committing them? Good and evil retribution is difficult to record completely; but viewing Fan Wen Zhenggong’s account of Dou Jianyi’s *Record of Hidden Virtue* is enough to know goodness can be done. Some say: “Though I treat him kindly, he returns evil; how can this be fair?” No. If one knows the words of the Red Lord of Southern Mountain, Qi naturally balances. He says: “If one meets me with calamity, then with blessings go; naturally the blessing Qi is born in me, the harmful Qi and heavy calamity in him.” This is the grand conduct of learning the Way. Is the Red Lord of Southern Mountain one who deceives men?

The country is safe and the people abundant, rejoicing and peaceful.

This is the fruit of all practicing the heart of goodness.

The *Inner Meaning* says: The Supreme Lord Laozi gave Master Ganji the Way of Peace. Its essence is: Man’s life is given by Heaven the spirit, by Earth the essence, and by the Harmony the Qi. If man preserves essence, loves spirit, and guards Qi, inside the body is preserved and long life assured; outside the country attains peace. Also said: Ministers should love their ruler, wishing him long life; children should remember their parents, fearing their nearing death, tempering their mind to enter the Way; always seeking strange methods and rare techniques to serve ruler and parents. Disciples should remember their teacher’s kindness. Man is born of parents, attains morality and virtue through teacher, receives honor from ruler. Always remembering ruler, parents, and teacher, as they age without return, or studying and practicing further, wise and bright seeking rare methods and peculiar techniques to aid—this is responding to the ancient Supreme Sovereign as the most loyal minister, filial son, and obedient disciple. If all do this, the world will be peaceful. What is within must have what is without, thus good deeds manifest and are called blessings; spirit and nature are bright and called wisdom. Blessings and wisdom cultivated together, inside and outside both aided. Then the country is like the body, the people are like the Qi; the country has a ruler, the body has a heart. If the ruler governs, the people are secure; if the heart is correct, the Qi is harmonious. The scripture says: “I do not act, yet people naturally transform; I prefer stillness, yet people naturally correct themselves; I do nothing, yet people naturally become rich; I desire nothing, yet people naturally are simple.” Governing the country and cultivating the heart are one and the same policy.

The scripture first issued teaching in one country; those with sincere heart, revering and practicing ritual and respect, all obtain worldly salvation.

The *Inner Meaning* says: Scripture issued teaching and established; people follow the Way; “preceding” means prior and before. Man is born with Dao Qi; is the heart ever tranquil? Once lost in illusions and confusion, upon meeting scripture and method, the heart brightens again. It is said that what now points out the elixir body is everyone’s original possession, not non-existent before hearing scripture and Dao. Though obtained after hearing scripture and Dao, it was really prior to hearing scripture and Dao; hence it is called “preceding sincere heart.” The so-called “ancestral” is the Dao’s root; “to reverence” is to honor its text; “ritual” is to respect its law; “respect” is to admire its virtue. Therefore the *Original Beginning Scripture* says: Those who cultivate the Way should know the Way, Virtue, Scripture, and Practice; the Way is the path; Way and Virtue are good works; Scripture is the path; practice is stepping; law is accomplishing. The Way and Scripture can be cultivated and the Way attained; that is, a path of accomplishment can be followed. One who can follow this will all obtain worldly salvation.

### The Way Speaks:

All that is said in the scripture by the Primordial Heavenly Lord are the secret rhymes of the various heavenly emperors, the inner names and hidden tones of the Heavenly Emperor Jade Word; also the inner taboo of the Demon Kings and the secret name of the Hundred Spirits, not the common words of the world.

The *Inner Meaning* says: The so-called inner names and secret rhymes of the Heavenly Emperor, the inner taboo of the Demon Kings, the secret names of the Hundred Spirits, are like the *Elixir Scripture* says: sun spirit, moon soul, Geng tiger, Jia dragon, mercury and cinnabar, red lead and black tin, yellow sprout and white snow, crimson girl and infant, yellow old woman and golden lord, furnace, stove, cauldron and vessel, etc. Though names and titles differ, all are the one primordial Qi, not separate and impure things.

### The Supreme Saint Has Already Become the Real Person, Penetrating the Profound and Subtle

The *Inner Meaning* says: The Supreme Saint cultivates the wondrous Way and has attained success. The Real Person understands the profound ultimate meaning and discerning the mysterious subtle. There is practical use, not clinging to empty words. Like the Mixed Void Red Text, the Primordial Beginning Ancestral Kalpa at the beginning of the Three Scenes, widely circulating Brahman Qi, all know its root and secret. Having its key, the marvels of Heaven and Earth’s Creation, life and death, existence and non-existence, are all before the eyes, not far outside the body.

One able to fully understand its chapter and recite it ten times,

The *Inner Meaning* says: Having thoroughly penetrated the profound and subtle, one can know its Way; the effect of ten times is equal to the Primordial Beginning. In elixir terms, ten times means the work is complete in ten months; in principle, nine revolutions.

The heavens chant from afar, praising its merits. Myriads of emperors arrange rites, honoring this scripture. Rivers and seas are silent,

Zhou Gong governs, seas do not raise waves. The Real Person recites scripture, rivers clear and seas calm. Different events, one principle; differing merits, one virtue.

Mountains and hills hide clouds.

Gathering clouds for rain, nourishing myriad things.

Sun and moon stop their light, the Jade Balance does not move.

The effect of ten times is equal to the Primordial Beginning, such is said.

The demons bind forms, ghost spirits perish.

The scripture says binding means sending away demon spirits, cutting off six ghost blades.

Returning corpses, raising the dead, dry bones become men.

Laozi raises Xu Jia’s dry bones.

The *Inner Meaning* says: The heavens chant from afar, myriads of emperors arrange rites, as *Zhuangzi* says, “serene and limitless, with all excellences following.” Heaven and Earth’s virtue, sage’s Way. Rivers and seas are silent, the sea of suffering is calmed. All human hearts are illusory, loves arise from feelings, suffering arises from knowledge. Having virtue accord with Heaven and Earth, Way accord with true saints, then the sea of love calms and the sea of suffering is quiet. Mountains and hills hide clouds; the *Yellow Court Scripture* says: Clouds above the Five Mountains correspond to the clouds of the five viscera. The Real Person’s breath is deep and full; the five viscera’s Qi is abundant, like mountains gathering clouds. The sun and moon are the two eyes; light is spirit. The Real Person’s spirit does not stray; though the eyes see things, it is fixed and unmoving; thus it is said light stops. The Jade Balance is the Big Dipper. The human heart resembles its pole, revolving without shifting; viewing and examining, it appears unmoving. The Real Person acts naturally; though the heart responds to things, it remains clear and still; thus it is said “does not move.” The demons are the myriad confusions disturbing the heart. Having acted naturally, respond as if nothing happens; this is called binding the form. Ghost spirits are the Three Corpses. If the Three Corpses do not leave, the Way cannot be accomplished. One able to embody purity and simplicity causes the Three Corpses to self-eliminate; thus it is said destroying the bright. Returning corpses, raising the dead, dry bones become men means that those who have completed the elixir not only perfect their own body but extend their merits to all things; thus the *Pure Bright Dharma* says: “Once my elixir is complete, transformation is at will. What is lacking is the Heavenly Emperor’s decree has not yet come. Therefore accumulate merits to await the true destiny.” All kinds having good merit can extend their years. Those ill-fated and dead are saved and revived, as Wu Meng Zhenjun did for Qing’s death.

### The Utmost Learners

The utmost learners have hearts as hard as iron and stone; they hold steadfast amid water and fire, Heaven and Earth cannot surpass them, ghosts and spirits cannot confuse them, they do what others cannot, being those with true name above the Supreme Ultimate. The utmost learners do not wait for thoughts to arise before learning; hence they can act diligently in the midst of thought or no thought, matter or no matter. These are the Real Persons, still next in rank.

Reciting ten times, the Five Emperors guard and the Three Realms bow.

This scripture is wondrous Qi condensed into spiritual text, the root of myriad Qi. Wherever there is five-phase Qi, the spirits of the Five Phases follow; they are called Emperors. Thus it says Five Emperors guard. Ji Kangzi asked Confucius about the Five Emperors; Confucius answered: “They assist the Supreme Emperor with the Five Phases and are called Five Emperors.” The Three Realms are the Three Great Demons. The utmost learner, with steadfast practice and accumulated merit, is guarded and revered by the Three Realms’ demon kings; thus it says “the Three Realms bow.”

Demonic essences lose their eyes, ghosts and demons extinguish their brightness.

Having been guarded and revered by the Great Demons, how dare the ghosts and spirits confront? This is likewise the principle of binding form and extinguishing brightness.

Saving and delivering those near death; cutting off and gaining life.

The *Inner Meaning* says: The Five Emperors are the spirits of the five viscera: liver soul, lung corporeal soul, heart spirit, kidney essence, spleen thought. If man is calm and peaceful, spirits settle, souls are clear, mind is peaceful, corporeal soul is tranquil, essence does not run away. If man is restless and competitive, spirits tire, souls murky, mind confused, corporeal soul scattered, essence lost and wasted. Man desires peace and long life, yet daily interactions tire the spirit; the Three Corpses and Nine Worms act as thieves. Thus the True Palace is disturbed. The cultivator causes the corpses and worms to vanish; the five viscera spirits each peacefully perform their tasks; thus it is said they guard. The Three Realms are the Three Corpses. These are the three parts of the human body’s Yin turbid and dark evil Qi, belonging to the three disciples’ realms. Upper corpse Peng Ju dwells in the head; middle corpse Peng Zhi dwells in the intestines; lower corpse Peng Qiao dwells in the feet. Man’s desires and cravings, all unwholesome acts, are caused by the corpses and demons. On the day of Gengshen, they go to the heavenly office to report man’s sins without omission, desiring man’s swift death, rejoicing. Guan Zhichuan said: “Can you cut off the three Peng’s hatred?” The three Peng are the three corpses. Methods to remove them are many, all recorded in the *Daozang* Gengshen section. Yet none surpass the Golden Elixir. An ancient poem says: “To exhaust the innumerable methods of the world, none but the elixir can kill the three corpses.” Zhang Zhenren said: “Since the Gengjia Shen Ming order, killing all three corpses is possible.” This is casting away evil to accomplish good, transforming stubborn ones to goodness, being subdued, thus it is said bowing. Demonic spirits and ghosts are the nine worms and six thieves. The three corpses are the leaders; the worms and thieves are followers. When the leaders are destroyed, the followers collapse; hence it is said eyes lost and brightness extinguished. If so, then one can extend the years near death, continue the ended fate; spirit and Qi strengthen. The scholar strives and practices; its merit is manifest.

Therefore, the scholar’s impure Qi not yet cleared, body not yet fully true, summons and commands the ten directions, power not yet controlling heavenly governance. Virtue may subdue and control earthly deities, binding demon spirits, but only death is prevented; revival is impossible.

The *Inner Meaning* says: The scholar’s desire is not cut off, nature and reason not clear; though probing and refining diligently, the mysterious void is not attained. One can only guard spirit and store Qi, subdue shadow demons, extend life, repel disease. The Way of long life is not yet to be expected.

Light recitation of this chapter brings disaster.

Meaning: not arranging proper form and clothes, not following ritual, acting or standing, sleeping or lying, merely reciting or thinking carelessly. If reciting without reverence, it is worse than not reciting at all.

The *Inner Meaning* says: Light recitation means light practice of this Way. The essentials of the Golden Elixir lie in harmonizing and regulating: first in gathering, next in avoiding excess, awaiting the cauldron’s completion and the full preparation of the medicines; then moving talismans and adding and extracting mercury and lead, harmonizing with the time and season, never failing the periods. Obtaining sufficient Yin and Yang Qi, the Kan and Li pearls round, spirit transforms into truth, long life and far seeing. But if feelings are restless, heart lazy, reckless acting; the timing and talismans miss, the rituals fail; then in midwinter or great heat, summer or severe frost, the crimson girl flees, the red dragon runs wild; spirit and essence lost, golden liquid hard to obtain; Qi exhausted, body wasted, form declines and life ends.

Offerings and reverent rites make the household prosperous. Generations flourish, connected with good causes. No calamity harms; spirit protects the gate.

The *Inner Meaning* says: If cultivation is sincere and reverent, outside the house prospers, inside the body and mind are peaceful. Daily renewing virtue, moving with auspicious meetings, disasters do not invade, spirits guard and protect.

This scripture is supreme and wondrous, unparalleled in the Jade Capital. Infinite salvation of men, the root of myriad ways. Majestic and vast, virtue difficult to surpass.

The *Inner Meaning* says: The *Seven Sign Scriptures’ Teaching Section* says: The Three Caverns are indeed the wondrous meaning of one vehicle, the profound words of the three realms. One who comprehends can become the Supreme Saint; one who illuminates can ascend to High Sage. The dragon pattern and phoenix seal display the excellent explanation of supreme principle; jade tablets and golden books guide to return to the source’s essential art. Thus this scripture is supreme and wondrous, unrivaled in Jade Capital, also the crown of the three caverns. From ancient times to the present, immortal saints and supreme sages all cultivate and verify through this. Records and books are complete, countless. Myriad laws and thousands of gates; none is not from this. Majestic and vast, beyond naming or reflection.

The Way says: Whoever recites this scripture ten times, all heavens arrive together; innumerable ancestors and spirits suffering in darkness all receive salvation, ascending the Vermilion Palace.

All reciters, regardless of rank, if able to diligently recite ten times following the Dharma, then all heavens arrive together, myriad saints descend to the ancestral halls, extracting ancestral spirits in darkness and the suffering spirits of kin, from the Lower North Mansion ascending to the Upper South Palace.

The period is nine years; receiving transformation and rebirth, becoming noble persons, and those who love learning until scripture功满德就, all attain immortality. They ascend to the Golden Pavilion, roaming and feasting in the Jade Capital.

The period of nine years means the nine-year period, the number of three fires, three threes making nine. The Vermilion Palace is the south, belonging to fire, using fire to refine the form; hence called three fires. Nine years undergo its refining and transformation, then rebirth as nobility. After rebirth, they cultivate this scripture; formerly needing practice, now at completion of myriad recitations and full merits of three thousand virtues, then transcend and ascend, directly attaining immortality, ascending the Golden Pavilion and serving the Holy Lord, roaming the Jade Capital and visiting the Primordial Beginning. According to the *Three Origins Admonitions*, the Vermilion Salvation period has three ranks: Great Blessing three years, Middle Blessing nine years, Small Blessing twenty-four years. Nine years corresponds approximately to the middle blessing rank.

The *Inner Meaning* says: Ten times corresponds to the month’s principle. All heavens arriving is myriad spirits mixed returning to unity. The innumerable ancestors are the assembled parents; the suffering spirits are the Qi after the body, all receive salvation. Ascending to the Vermilion Palace is refining and transforming the mixed and assembled turbid Qi, transcending the mundane body. The nine-year period of receiving transformation and rebirth is to become noble persons, harmonizing and refining mixed and assembled turbid Qi into Yang spirit, rebirth of true Qi; myriad spirits become one spirit, myriad Qi become one Qi, nurturing the sacred embryo. The scholar arriving at this degree has attained complete spirit and sufficient Qi, extending life and long years; the so-called immortals are not yet said. Therefore it says "and those who love learning until scripture功满德就, all attain immortality." Further cultivation is required; internal skill accomplishment and virtue conduct may then be hoped for. Internal skill is the Way of fire-hunting and spiritual transformation. The cultivation method is detailed below. Virtue conduct is to aid and benefit others; like Han Heavenly Master distinguishing men and ghosts, Ge Xianweng universally saving spirits in darkness, Xu Zhenjun exterminating and cutting dragons and snakes. The scripture says: “Even if the scholar guards the Way but does not produce merit and virtue, he cannot attain the Way.” Formerly Han Heavenly Master’s elixir was complete but not taken; he said to Master Wang: “When the spirit elixir is accomplished and taken, one will surely rise to Heaven and become a Real Person; but I do not yet possess great virtue; I should first serve country and people, remove harm and promote benefit; only then take the elixir and lightly ascend.” I serve the Three Realms thus without shame. Only so can one ascend the Golden Pavilion and roam the Jade Capital.

The highest learners cultivate and recite this scripture, all instantly receive salvation and ascend to the South Palace.

The highest learners hear the Way and diligently act, seeing the Dharma and learning it, beginning to end without change, regardless of cold or heat; these are the Immortals below the Nine Palaces of Supreme Purity. Having cultivated and recited this scripture, the body attains the Way and ascends to the Immortal domain, receiving refining at the South Palace Vermilion Mound. The soul and corporeal rise to immortality, fire refines ghost substance; the living boat attains the Way, fire refines filthiness; thus all enter the South Palace; then ascend to true original position.
