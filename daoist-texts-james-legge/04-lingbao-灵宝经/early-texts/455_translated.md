### The Supreme Mysterious Spiritual Treasure Red Writ Jade Secret Sublime Scripture, Scroll One

At that time, the Primordial Heavenly Honoured One, the Supreme Great Way Sovereign, the Five Elders Supreme Emperors, and the Ten Directions Great Spirits assembled at the Southern Cinnabar Cave Yang Upper Pavilion, seated upon a luminous pearl seven-coloured precious throne. Present were the Five Emperors Great Sages and the Mysterious Harmonious Jade Maidens, fifty-two thousand five hundred in number, who came to the seat. Heaven scattered fragrant blossoms, divine dragons played music; countless multitudes moved without restraint; purple clouds spread in four directions; the Three Luminaries shone together; the Heavenly Origin united in celebration; all the perfected beings took their places. At that moment, the diligent scholar Wang Longci attended at the seat, requesting to receive the precepts.

The Way spoke to Longci: "For seven million kalpas have I devoted myself to cultivating the Spiritual Treasure, established vows to bestow, upheld precepts and fasted, diligently without retreating, passing through birth and death, enduring humiliation and striving earnestly, cutting off diverse thoughts, receiving emptily without thought, accumulating feeling in profound silence, thereby attaining the way and dignity of the myriad sages. Constantly employing compassion, desiring to widely save beings, be they male or female, well-wishing perfected persons, all are enabled to see the wondrous methods of the Spiritual Treasure. Thou hast a good heart, come to return to the Dharma Gate; by thy former lives of ten thousand kalpas, thou hast already served the utmost truth, merits full and virtue sufficient, born into the world of the Way, encountering the rising Dharma. Now I shall explain to thee the tenfold condensed sublime scriptures, that thou mayest save and liberate the peoples of the ten directions. Diligently apply thy mind, and let not the words of demons prevail."

The Way said: "The causes and conditions of birth and death, the revolving of fortunes and vows, all proceed from the body. The human body is hard to obtain; the world of the Way hard to meet; the scriptures and Dharma hard to attain; words of secret formulas hard to hear. Therefore I unfold the profound meaning and explain the essential sayings. Reflecting on the ten directions' heavenly beings born, who cannot preserve their bodies, long abiding in suffering and affliction, willingly bearing guilt, revolving through the five paths, none able to awaken. Hence I widely illuminate the Dharma teachings, open the way to the ignorant, that all heavenly beings may enter the unsurpassed true gate, universally save all who live and meet this world. Truly by the conditions of past karma, perfected beings all obtain deliverance. I have received the ancient scriptures of the Primordial True Text, spoken to save the world through ten thousand kalpas, to return to the unsurpassed Wanli Heaven. After passing from the world into the midst of the five turbidities, fate fails to reach, be they male or female, they see not the bright teaching, abiding always in evil paths, born and dying without opportunity, filled with sorrow, suffering great injustice, self-born and self-dying, revolving through the five paths, falling into the three realms and eight difficulties, calamities answering one another without limit, birth and death separated, without distinction of high or low, truly a painful heart. Now I explain these essentials for those who may be saved. Thou shalt sincerely receive my words." Then annotating the secret formula, Longci bowed his head and humbly received the teaching.

The Way said: "Thou who receivest the great Spiritual Treasure precepts, shalt rise facing north, bowing thy head and body to the ground, worshipping the ten directions, turning eastward, lie prone to hear the ten precepts.

First, keep thy heart free from malice and envy, bear no shadowy thieves, guard thy mouth carefully from faults, and keep thy thoughts on the Dharma.

Second, uphold benevolence and do not kill, pity and aid all beings, extend compassion widely to save all.

Third, keep chastity, humility, and righteousness, avoid lewdness and theft, always practice good thoughts, diminish self to aid others.

Fourth, restrain from lust and desire, keep the heart from wandering, guard purity and caution, act without spot or stain.

Fifth, the mouth speaks no evil words, speech is not ornate or vain, inwardly and outwardly be loyal and straightforward, commit no fault in speech.

Sixth, cease drinking wine, moderate conduct, harmonize qi and nature, spirit unharmed, avoid all evils.

Seventh, envy not others' victory over oneself, contest not for fame and merit, in all matters be humble and yielding, withdraw to save others.

Eighth, do not criticize scriptures and teachings, nor revile the sacred texts, keep the Dharma in thy heart as before the gods.

Ninth, do not quarrel with words, nor debate the four ranks, lest heavenly beings and men blame thee, injuring spirit and qi.

Tenth, in all thy conduct and deeds, hold equality and one heart, harmony with men and accord with spirits, act as is natural.

Cultivate and observe pure precepts, always accord with heavenly mind. Constantly practice great compassion, desiring to universally save all in distress. Revere the teaching without negligence. Better to keep goodness and die, than do evil and live. Thus without retreat, thou mayest attain deliverance from the five paths, refrain from the three evils, be protected by the heavens, revered by myriad spirits, keep fast and observe precepts, and naturally attain liberation."

The Way said: "The Spiritual Treasure opens the Dharma to save men; there are twelve methods by which one may be saved in the world. Thou shouldst follow these and obtain uprightness, finally entering non-action.

First: See the true scriptures issuing Dharma, opening deliverance for all, then arouse the mind of the Way, the heart desiring future lives, and attain the great sage.

Second: Constantly practice compassion, wish for all to universally see the Dharma, open deliverance far and wide, without obstacle.

Third: Delight in scriptures and teachings, read deeply and widely, resolve firm and clear, open the ignorant.

Fourth: Honour and accept teachers' instructions, widely promote exhortations, cause entrance into the Dharma gate, and be far from blind paths.

Fifth: Believe in the profound mystery, reverence scriptures and secrets, recite morning and evening without weariness.

Sixth: Do not seek glory or wealth, cut off worldly causes, concentrate heart and resolve, all efforts directed to the Dharma.

Seventh: Diligently recite great scriptures, wish for all, open wide bridges, make conditions for future lives.

Eighth: Always generate good heart, no evil or falsehood, no envy or harm, no evil or jealousy.

Ninth: In all places where born, always meet the holy world, meet the Spiritual Treasure Dharma teaching without break.

Tenth: Keep the body pure, observe precepts, cultivate fasting and build merit, broadly save beings, all obtain liberation.

Eleventh: Study widely, declare and communicate scriptures and Dharma, beforehand with heavenly beings, universally cause deliverance.

Twelfth: Always meet bright teachers generation after generation, receive instruction and propagate, save men without measure.

These are the twelve wondrous secrets. If one can practice this good mind, generation after generation will see the sacred texts, form connections with the Way, be friends with heavenly beings, walk alone through the three realms without obstruction, long free from the three evils, five paths, and eight difficulties. Spirits revere and protect, earth deities escort and guard, the gates are pure and solemn, myriad calamities do not harm. All that is sought and wished, reading and reciting this scripture, all is fulfilled.

Thus, good men and good women, with earnest hearts revering and observing, all belong to the great saints of the ten directions, comprehending nature, born of water and fire, transforming their forms and shadows, flying and ascending to Supreme Clarity. If their merit be not yet complete, when the scripture is finished and they pass away, they shall be welcomed by the Five Emperors, directly ascending the heavenly palace, not crossing Mount Tai, transformed and born as noble gatekeepers, meeting with the scripture and Way, truly attaining deliverance of the world."

The Way told Longci: "Diligently practise and truly receive, do not be negligent." Longci bowed, prostrating to accept the precepts.

The Way said: "True texts, incantations, high and supreme methods of deliverance, ancient texts profound and hidden, not to be sought in detail, later learners find it hard to apply them. Therefore the High One set down the pen to explain the obscure. The Jade Secret's true essentials unfold ancient words, subtle phrases profound and mysterious, revered by the heavens. Recite the jade chapters; the ten directions sing afar; heaven sets rites; spirits and demons subdued; ghosts and goblins extinguished. Attending the text are jade boys and jade maidens, fifty each; from no previous lives of ten thousand kalpas may they inscribe the great mystery, nor see these jade texts. When the time and meeting come, those who obtain immortality and blessings from the nine ancestors and nurture the mysterious descendants all obtain deliverance from the three evils, five paths, and eight difficulties. This text is venerable and precious, wondrous beyond measure."

The Supreme Way Sovereign requests to annotate its text, to transmit the utmost truth. According to the Spiritual Treasure mysterious method, once every forty thousand kalpas transmission. Thus the Spiritual Treasure is clearly revealed, issuing Dharma to save men.

True texts shining brightly, illumination and penetration, five qi viewing radiance, shining inside and out, clouds and scenes clear and bright, like the moon among stars, wondrous appearances and many excellencies, beyond measure.

At that time in the northern chamber was a diligent worthy man named Wang Fudu. He had a daughter named A Qiu Ceng, aged sixteen, then in the bathing chamber, bathing in fragrant water, washing herself, seeing golden bright light bending and shining, doubting some abnormality, went out of the house climbing the wall, facing south saw the Dao True, spirit bright and shining, appearance radiant like the sun. The girl rejoiced, clasped hands in salutation, from afar named herself: "I am Qiu Ceng, now fortunate to meet, body sees the Heavenly Honoured, returns to the ten directions' heaven of heavens, wishing to receive precepts, obey and accept Dharma text, uproot all evil roots, early obtain transformation wheel, change to male form, after ten thousand kalpas, hope to become flying immortal."

The Five Emperor Demon Kings seeing the girl's heart and great vow, fearing she would surpass our realm, therefore transformed into Five Elder old men, went to tell the girl: "I have received mission from Ten Directions respected spirits, come to tell you the Spiritual Treasure Dharma Code. Our Way now practises, Dharma uses benevolence and love, compassion and filial piety as foundation. At first heard your father will take you from female form, already heard human words, cannot be disobeyed. You should first obey, human Way already prepared, rites and instructions also sufficient, the rest may cast off body. Heaven supervises your heart; if you do not obey your father, immortality cannot be attained."

The girl answered the demon: "In my former life I was unfortunate, lacked karmic affinity, merits not full, causing birth as female. Morning and evening I repent, swear to keep one heart, intention firm and strong, arising from nature. Born by father and mother, fate belongs to Ten Heavens, truly disobeying father's teaching is not as you say." The demon saw the girl held firm and upright, could not interfere, and so withdrew. Qiu Ceng said: "The Way is lofty and distant, no chance to be free, so I gathered firewood and climbed the wall, burned my body, hoping my form and bones may become flying dust, descend with the wind to the Way's presence." Then fire burned; Qiu Ceng clasped hands to heaven and said: "Ten Directions Infinite Heavenly Honoured, today return my form and bones to heaven among heavens, wish to attain freedom, like scattered dust." Then cast herself into fire, burning without attachment, body like stepping on air, in a moment, her female body transformed into a male, directly to the Way's presence, thus receiving sincerity. The Primordial immediately ordered the Southern Pole Venerable Spirit to be the girl's master, teaching her the true texts, giving three hundred jade maidens of Taihua and three hundred jade boys of Jincheng, many good ones wearing thirty-two marks, penetrating and reflecting the female body.

The Way told the Southern Pole Venerable Spirit: "This girl in former life already served the Spiritual Treasure, transmigrated through ten thousand kalpas, now obtains transformation born among men, seeing me issue Dharma, immediately obtains transformation, will further save ninety-nine thousand nine hundred, then attain true great god. At that time, all in ten directions, male or female, all arouse true Dao intent, none not diligently keeping fasting and precepts, cultivating and receiving Spiritual Treasure, bearing supreme vows, all attain deliverance of the world."

The Way told A Qiu Ceng: "The Southern Pole Venerable Spirit formerly was also a woman, born in the Chanli world in the Red Bright Heaven, greatly made merits, praised by all heavens. The Way task not yet complete, then encountered fiery calamity numbers crossing, Heaven and Earth shift, in the example of abandonment and chaos.

Qiu Ceng's mind awakened, looking down saw Southern Pole dwelling on southern wall inscribed text: Year Tai Jia, month seventh, day first, Huang Duming and A Qiu Ceng together at Dan Yang Cypress Grove Cottage made vows. Total twenty-three characters, character very clear. Recalled this not long ago, suddenly through Heaven and Earth three changes of kalpa fate, now obtaining birth in Spiritual Treasure's world."

The Way spoke to Qiu Ceng: "Thou
