The Precious Edict of the Eastern Flower Sovereign Lord

With a devoted heart I turn and submit in reverence. The pure and subtle Great Way, the limitless Divine Lord. The primal beginning’s transforming qi divides the true; the hidden dragon of the Purple Mansion must not be used. He was proclaimed Emperor upon the Mountains of the Directions, charged with the heavenly registers of the immortals; He established the palace above the Blue Sea, and the Way is called forth to nurture all living beings. The Three Palaces have offices of governance; the Eight Emperors are the seats of Non-action. When the appointed time comes, ascending the terrace He looks southwards; lo, the purple qi comes from the East. Calm and tranquil, truly still; manifesting and enlightening the mysterious功 [power]. The peerless Sovereign, the ancestor of all the true. Great Compassion, Great Vow; Great Sage, Great Mercy. The Eastern Flower Great Controller of Destiny, the Lesser Yang Emperor Lord, the Fusang Emperor Sovereign, the Eastern King Wood Duke Heavenly Venerable.

With a devoted heart I turn and submit in reverence. The Purple Mansion’s Cave Heaven, the azure yang transforming qi. He holds the registers of all immortals, opening and expounding the beginning of the Dharma gate. He composed the Yellow Court and the Tao Te Ching, mutually interwoven inside and out; He balanced the Jade Garden assisting the Divine Precious Lords, secret and preserved for maintenance. The blue clouds form a canopy, purple qi joins the city. Great Compassion, Great Vow; Great Sage, Great Mercy. From the azure yang arises the sect, the Purple Mansion Eastern Flower Sovereign Lord, assisting the Origin and establishing the Pole Heavenly Venerable.

With a devoted heart I turn and submit in reverence. The leader of the celestial immortals, the Great Way’s framework. Receiving the primal spirit of the nine qi, gathering the pure subtle mysteries. Opening and spreading the elixir methods, elucidating the pre-heaven. Perfectly clear and free, reflecting the void; broad and illustrious, communicating with the unoriginated. He aids living beings and vows to extend the solemn oath, to raise and transcend the classes and to halt and elevate the fallen and the lowly. The decayed and withered receive qi from the East; in the dark see the light on the red earth. Brightly proclaiming the orthodox teaching, governing and restraining the evil traces. Great Compassion, Great Vow; Great Sage, Great Mercy, presiding over the precious seals of the host of immortals, Eastern Flower establishes the Pole, Great Way Emperor Lord, transmitting the elixir and delivering the world Heavenly Venerable.
