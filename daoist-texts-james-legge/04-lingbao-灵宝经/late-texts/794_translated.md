Title of the Scripture: Commentary on the Scripture of the Jade Chapter of the Born Spirits of the Nine Heavens of the Natural Lingbao of Dongxuan. Composed anew by Huayang of the Yuan. Three scrolls. Original source: "The Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Tradition," Dongxuan section, category of Jade Secrets.

#### Preface to the Commentary on the Scripture of the Jade Chapter of the Born Spirits of the Nine Heavens

The Jade Chapter of the Born Spirits is that by which the Highest Emperor proclaims the virtue of cherishing life. Therefore, in all treasures refined and mixed, ascending the Way of Morning, nothing is wanting. Yet its purport transcends and surpasses common speech, not being words of the world; if there be no transmission and annotation, it is not easily understood. I have heard that the Daoists of Mount Heng, Xue Youqi, Li Shaowei, attendant of the Great Purity, and the Dharma Master Cheng Xuanying of Xihua, transmitted it all, penetrating mystery and investigating subtlety; yet I have not seen their works. Later commentaries are many, but only the three families of Wang Yinxian, Xiao Zhenyou, and Fushan Zhenshuai have expounded thoroughly. Yet what they have seen differs and agrees; the reader cannot comprehend one but is rather perplexed with doubt. As for the reckoning of the year of Jia Shen, the matter is difficult to verify, and yet they seek the obscure and recondite, startling the world and shaking vulgarity, transmitting thus. The spirit is the spirit of qi, riding upon yin and yang, commanding transformation, traversing above and below, north, south, east, and west, without interval. Heaven moves the four seasons, producing all things. The sage man bathes in heaven without drowning, the earth and mountains are scorched but not heated, riding clouds and commanding winds, nothing can injure him; all this is by virtue of this spirit. When a man's spirit gathers he lives; when it disperses he dies. The Nine Chapters are named after the Born Spirits; their meaning is profound. Old commentaries are lost, numbering several dozens; the higher enter into remoteness, the lower sink in vulgarity, often sighing. A guest came from Haolai, showing me the commentary of Huayang Fu. Examining its general purport, it gathers and distils the strengths of various discourses, blends them into one, cites the "Lingbao" and "Huangting," unfolds the Way of the Elixir, simple and easy to be seen. Like clouds dispersed and the bright moon hanging in the sky, it makes one clearly understand. Alas! This commentary is the guide for the study of the Way. Its words are indeed lofty; those of superior virtue must be diligent and put them into practice, as our Old Master said. On the fifth day after the double noon of the Ren Shen in the utmost summer, embodying the mysterious response of the Great Harmony True Man, Zhang Shouqing of the Wudang Great Purity Subtle Transformation Palace composed this preface.

#### Commentary on the Scripture of the Jade Chapter of the Born Spirits of the Nine Heavens of the Natural Lingbao, Scroll One

Commentary by Huayang Fu

Dong means emptiness. Xuan means profound and remote. Only emptiness can contain all mysteries; only profound remoteness has a deep and lasting meaning. Lingbao (Spirit Treasure) externally signifies sacred transformation and profound weight; internally it means spirit descended to be spirit, qi gathered to be treasure. Among the three treasures in the scripture, only Lingbao is thus named, marking the time of writing for the salvation of men. Natural means the original Three Qi, appearing at the fitting time, condensing the great void, phoenix seals and dragon characters, possessing form but no trace, naturally inscribed, not made by the mind of a sage. The Nine Heavens are the Yudan, boundless, utmost, without knot or affection, together nine. Born Spirits are the methods of issuing and transforming. Scripture is a book recording the Way, the path of cultivating truth.

The Three Treasures Great Possession Scripture

The Three Treasures are the Heavenly Treasure, the Spiritual Treasure, and the Divine Treasure. Great Possession is the name of the Heavenly Treasure Palace. The "Scripture of the Salvation of Men" says: The Great Possession is a wondrous court, meaning the heavenly palace is abundant beyond compare. This book was once hidden in this palace. Gold is most precious and indestructible, hence taken as the right. Its text is the source and flow of the Nine Chapters.

The Lord of Heavenly Treasure is the honored spirit of the Great Void. The Elder of Heavenly Treasure is the ancestral qi of the Lord of Heavenly Treasure. The Elder is the qi of the Mixed Void, the Supreme Without Origin, High Sovereign King of Emptiness, ninety-nine trillion nine hundred ninety billion qi. In the first year of Longhan, the Lord of Heavenly Treasure was transformed and born. At the time of issuing the scripture, he was called the High Supreme Great Possession Jade Pure Palace.

The Lord of Heavenly Treasure is the Jade Pure Primordial Heavenly Venerable, condensed from the mysterious unity of qi. The utmost is Heaven; above it is the sovereign called the Emperor. The Dao precedes the Emperor, thus is the Primordial. In the human body, he is the Great Unity Emperor Lord, namely the primordial spirit. The Great Void is the authority and vehicle of teaching and law. Elder is a title of dignity, noble but without position, transformed and born as the Lord of Heavenly Treasure, the name first established. The Mixed Void Supreme Without Origin is the form of the Jade Void Heaven before the breaking of Hongmeng. The number nine corresponds to Qian (Heaven). The "Chart of Opening and Transformation" says: first is Longhan, second Yankan, third Chiming, fourth Shanghuang, fifth Kaihuang; all are names of heavenly past kalpas. "Long" means spirit; "Han" means heaven. At the time of issuing the book, the five texts of "Scripture of Salvation of Men" were opened and spread to all spirits. Jade Pure Palace is the mysterious seat of the Lord of Heavenly Treasure. The ancestral qi is the Dao; the Dao is the Lord of Heavenly Treasure. Its subtle origin is self-formed, with no ancestor above, taking emptiness as lord, naturalness as root, long but not ruling, without form or name. The sage when establishing teaching cannot but respect its origin, thus forcibly naming it the root of the Dao.

The Lord of Spiritual Treasure is the honored spirit of Dongxuan. The Elder of Spiritual Treasure is the ancestral qi of the Lord of Spiritual Treasure. The Elder is the qi of the Red Mixed Supreme Without Origin, Mysterious High Purple Void, ninety-nine million nine hundred ninety-nine thousand qi black. Later, in the Longhan era, opening the chart, the Lord of Spiritual Treasure was transformed and born; after one kalpa to the Chiming first year. At the time of issuing the scripture for salvation, he was called the Supreme Pure Mysterious Metropolis Jade Capital Seven Treasures Purple Star Palace. Purple Void, from the Zhao family text.

The Lord of Spiritual Treasure is the Supreme Pure Heavenly Venerable. From one is born two, the qi of primordial one. Ling means ineffable. The Dongxuan Scripture and Lingbao both come from the Great Void. According to the "Canon of the Treasury, Preface of the Many Sections": Dongxuan is the root; Lingbao is the trace. The qi of the Great Void is born in emptiness, flowing as Dongzhen, next as Dongxuan, then as Dongshen. The earlier chapter does not say Dongzhen but Great Void, meaning its root. The Red Mixed Supreme Without Origin is the light shape of the Supreme Nothing in the middle, about to emerge. From the opening of the Longhan chart, it has subtly shown its trace. At Chiming, issuing the scripture, human culture began to be declared. Chiming Purple Void, Dongyang's literary form. Salvation of men transmits scripture and teaching, all rescuing from life and death. Purple Star Office is the place where the Lord of Spiritual Treasure expounds teaching and stores scripture. Its qi compared to Jade Void is less by nine hundred million, thus it manages the descent of kalpas and disperses into myriad beings, no longer as in the ancient undistinguished state. I privately consider the sage's intention in issuing the book: fearing the later degenerate age, with falsehood and cunning, shortening heavenly years, turning in the sea of suffering, it desires a return to purity and root, valuing qi as solid root, to advance the path of immortality. Therefore issuing the Spirit Chapter, earnestly warning and awakening, virtue is greatest.

The Lord of Divine Treasure is the honored spirit of Dongshen. The Elder of Divine Treasure is the ancestral qi of the Lord of Divine Treasure. The Elder is the qi of the Dark Quiet Mysterious Penetrating Supreme Clear Void, ninety-nine million nine hundred ninety thousand qi. Later, at Chiming first year, the Lord of Divine Treasure was transformed and born; after two kalpas to the Shanghuang first year. At the time of issuing the scripture, it was called the Three Sovereigns Dongshen Great Purity Supreme Ultimate Palace Clear Void, from the Zhao family text.

The Lord of Divine Treasure is the Great Purity Heavenly Venerable. From two is born three, the qi of beginning one. Shen (spirit) means the name of the unpredictable transformations of yin and yang. The Dongshen teaching and law is the Great Purity unfolding the Way of Great Peace and non-action. Its honored scripture has twelve parts, externally such as Purple Void Registers, Disaster Dispelling and Disaster Exorcising, Pure and Quiet Heavenly Child and other scriptures, all belonging to it. Dark Quiet Mysterious Penetrating Supreme means no thought, no action, quiet and unmoving, responsive and thus penetrating. The old text lacked the character Yuan; Wang Yinxian supplemented it to complete the Three Origins. Clear Void means light and pure as heaven; its qi compared to the Red Mixed is less by ninety thousand, becoming ever more descending and thinning. Supreme Ultimate Palace is the Great Purity immortal realm. In the Great Void method are the Three Origin officials; the Heavenly Venerable once ordered the generals Tang, Ge, and Zhou to guard and solemnize the official gates. Their spirits correspond above to the Three Qi, below governing the three parts of the human body, assisting in heaven the pivot of the Northern Dipper, also managing talismans, spirit texts, and covenants. If a man cultivates the Great Void skill to perfection, these three spirits guide him to ascend and meet the imperial palace, this is the path of harmonious mixture. During the Song Zhizhe period, Emperor Renzong was unwell and dreamt of wandering in thorns, confused and lost. He saw a divine man clad in golden armour, who said to the emperor: Heaven grants Your Majesty longevity for one era because of your benevolent heart. The emperor said: "Where shall I return?" The divine man said: "I will escort you with my chariot." The emperor mounted the chariot and asked the divine man's name. He replied: "I am General Ge." When the emperor awoke, he was at ease and ordered a search of the Daoist Canon; indeed there was a record of General Ge guarding the Heavenly Gates. Thus was his rank raised and a temple established in the capital. Alas, at that time none reported this spirit, to use his own divine qi to augment the work of preservation.

Though these three titles differ in year and name, their essence is one. They are divided as Mysterious Origin, Primordial, and Beginning Three Qi to govern. The Three Treasures are all honored spirits of the Three Qi, named for their giving birth to the Three Qi; the three titles together give birth to the nine qi. The nine qi emerge before the great void, hidden in emptiness, without light or form, without shape or name, without color or thread, without sound or voice.

The three titles are the officials of the Three Purities. The years are the ages of the five kalpas of transformation. Though the names differ, the principle is one. From the mysterious unity qi is born the Heavenly Treasure; later the primordial and beginning qi divide to become Spiritual Treasure and Divine Treasure. When the Three Qi are sufficient, they give birth to nine qi; the nine qi scatter into myriad qi, to plant the root of living things. Moreover, before the nine qi emerge, light is dim, traces hidden, mixed as one, not subject to governance: a riddle indeed.

Guiding the movement and managing the world, opening and penetrating the mysterious, the three colors mix in chaos, appearing and vanishing, movement pushes to the utmost number. The Three Qi open light; qi is clear, high, and pure; accumulated yang becomes heaven; qi congeals and coagulates dregs; accumulated stagnation becomes earth. The nine qi are arranged in order: sun, moon, stars, constellations, yin bowels, five phases, peoples and kinds, all receive generation.

From one dividing into three is the Lord of Divine Treasure, moving the dark quiet mysterious penetrating supreme qi, to guide yin and yang, complete transformation, govern birth and death of the world and men. The three colors are mysterious qi blue, primordial qi yellow, beginning qi white. The original Three Qi not yet divided, sometimes present, sometimes absent, the mechanism already foretold, about to ride the movement of numbers and emerge. After division, heaven and earth thereby fix their position, peoples and kinds thereby arise; thus heaven, earth, and man are seen to proceed from the Dao together.

The myriad transformations of heaven and earth, if not nurtured by the Three Origins and led by the nine qi, none can be born. The Three Qi are the honored of heaven and earth; the nine qi are the roots of myriad things; thus the three unite to form virtue, the utmost of heaven and earth.

The Three Origins and Three Qi are the ancestors of heaven and earth, thus called sun honored. They transform to give birth to the nine qi, govern yin and yang, nurture myriad kinds; thus called roots. The union of three is the condensation of the Three Qi, transformations infinite, the virtue of generation complete. The meaning of utmost accords with the Great Ultimate, the meeting place of yin and yang and the five phases.

Man is born in the womb; the Three Origins nurture him; the nine qi form his shape; thus in the ninth month the spirits array and the qi is full and able to speak. Speech yet spirit complete, the nine heavens acclaim and celebrate. Taiyi holds the tally; the emperor lords command ranks and fates, register and record, govern destiny and fixed reckoning; the Five Emperors oversee birth, the Holy Mother guards the chamber; heavenly and earthly gods, the three realms all guard. The Nine Heavens Marshal stands in court, facing east reading the Nine Heaven Born Spirit Treasure Chapter nine times. The male then the myriad spirits sing homage; the female then the myriad spirits sing service. The male marshal reverently accepts the command; the female marshal faithfully obeys. Hereupon is birth. If the Nine Heavens Marshal does not issue the command chapter, the myriad spirits do not sing homage; birth will not occur.

Man is the spirit of myriad things, receiving the qi of heaven and earth in harmony. Before birth, in obscure darkness, by feeling and transformation, he enters the mother's womb to become a man. The Three Origins distribute qi as three fields, governing the whole body. The qi of the Nine Heavens successively gathers soul and spirit, five viscera and hundred bones, and concretizes. When the two hundred and seventy days of the ninth month are complete, the three nine numbers suffice; then he separates from the mother in form; at this time voice, form, spirit, and qi are all perfect; the work of the Nine Heaven Born Spirits is thus complete; how can there be no celebration? Taiyi, according to the "Mysterious Mirror," is the great lord of longevity, the Great Void Taiyi, holding the tally to unite the myriad spirits. The emperor lord is the lord of myriad spirits, ranking and fixing their heights and depths. The destiny officer is the central elder, named Liming Mingchu, styled Xuandu Qing. Fixed reckoning forecasts lifespan. The Five Emperors, masters of the five phases, send their true qi to the body. The Holy Mother is the Nine Heaven Holy Mother, the lord of utmost yin, delighting in forming things, thus forbids the inauspicious. The Nine Heavens Marshal once guarded the jade chapter, facing east reciting scripture to awaken birth qi. The myriad spirits sing homage and service, like the performance of drum and chimes, distinguishing male and female. If the marshal does not issue the command chapter, then heaven's mandate is not granted. If the myriad spirits do not sing homage, heaven's principle does not flow. How can birth be obtained? That man has birth, how is it easy? Should he not diligently advance the good Way to preserve heaven's gift to him? Fushan Zhenshuai said: when a man is born good, his yang spirits rejoice, saying: "Today is joyful; we are united with this man and with heaven." If he does evil, the spirits mourn, saying: "We have neglected to observe and assign him; he falls into the dark shadow." Su Dongpo and Chen Luchang in their "Poem on Abstaining from Killing" say: "Though Wang Wuzi is not seen, his spirit weeps before death." This is the same meaning. The command chapter is the mandate heaven bestows as fate; as the "Book of Documents" says, "Only the Supreme Emperor bestows the heart on the people." The "Doctrine of the Mean" calls this the mandate of heaven and nature. Though heaven does not speak, it entrusts the work of creation to the Jade Chapter; therefore it is called the Command Chapter.

When a man obtains rebirth on the human path, washing the form in the sun, startling heaven and earth, even high rank is hard to surpass. The true heaven and earth spirits, the three realms all present, do not treat lightly. When the time of birth comes, it is not lowly. Therefore he can cherish his form, preserve his spirit, value his qi, fix his root, never dying or decaying, and attain spirit immortality. Bone and flesh fly together, ascending to the Three Purities, harmonizing with the Three Qi and the nine qi altogether. But a man obtains birth yet cannot honor his qi, value his form, treasure his fate, cherish his spirit; he brings death upon himself, departing from his true root.

Man has death and birth; nature has no death or birth. Beyond birth and death, who hears the Dao and sees nature? Ordinary men, having habits not removed, are held by karma, detained in dark shadows, some mutually repaying; when karma is exhausted, the good nature is not destroyed; returning to be born in the human path, he must first wash the form in the sun before entering the womb. On the sun above is the pavilion called the Dongyang Palace, a pool of flowing fire in which is true water of yellow flowers; the spirits there also wash their bodies in this water. The scripture of the brief teachings of longevity says: yellow flowers wash the form; this is what is meant. When one obtains being human, through many stages, startling heaven and earth, how can it be mean or lowly? If one can refine and nurture the primordial spirit, return to root and purity, correspond with the Three Qi and nine qi, all will ascend with bone and flesh to the Three Purities. Yet without self-effort, death and decay ensue; lamentable indeed. Formerly Ouyang Wenzhong did not study the Huanglao teachings; in later years he guarded the Bo shrine; suddenly he had enlightenment. One day he asked the Dao of the recluse of Shitang. The recluse answered: your dwelling is already broken, hard to speak further; but if you can illuminate your prior state, this would be a great matter. Your literary works and achievements surpass the world; you have the capacity to receive the Dao, but lost it not early enough. Yet the work of Dao consists in awakening the nature; one must cultivate the foundation of fate; if unable to honor qi, value form, preserve fate, cherish spirit, decline and old age will come, mercury dry, lead exhausted; the foundation of life cut, true nature dimmed; to cultivate at this time is as if thirsting and digging a well, is it not late?

The Nine Heaven Born Spirit Chapter is the combined sound of the three Dong flying mysterious qi, forming spirit text; blending myriad spirits, hidden rhyme, inner names, born qi forming shape, a chapter of nature.

Flying mysterious means the primordial qi flying in great void, combining the three Dongs to form text, sounds harmonious as metal and stone, gathering the meaning of heaven and earth giving life. Within are myriad spirits' inner names; reciting it, spirits hear their names and gather and communicate. The "Jade Pivot Scripture" says: in the body are nine spirits; why not call them? Calling them is auspicious. In the body are three essences; why not call them? Calling them is a blessing.

Reciting the Heavenly Treasure opens the light of heaven and earth. Reciting the Spiritual Treasure opens the soul of the nine darknesses long night. Reciting the Divine Treasure controls myriad spirits. Reciting Taiyi equips body and spirit. Reciting the Emperor Lord binds form. Reciting the Nine Heavens gives birth to men. Scholars recite to ascend heaven.

Those who recite the Jade Chapter of the Three Treasure Lords declare the marvels of the Dao. Taiyi is the Lord of the Primordial One. Emperor Lord is the Taiyi Emperor Lord. Though the Jade Chapter is one, those who recite differ; each according to their Dao virtue and strength; the enlightenment and response vary in depth.

Ghost spirits hearing it ascend and progress. Ordinary men hearing it prolong life. Hidden souls hearing it open to salvation. Rot and decay hearing it emit smoke. Infants hearing it speak. Dead bones hearing it return to man.

Ghost spirits are ghost officials. The "Flying Immortal Treasure Sword Scripture" records: Xiao Miao was a talented and respected ghost of goodness; after four hundred years he became the lord of the underworld. Now hearing the scripture, no time limit is needed; ascent and progress are hoped for. Ordinary men possess all six desires; through the scripture become pure and quiet, and may thus long survive in the world. Hidden souls are ghosts imprisoned in hell; hearing the scripture they have the fortune to be saved; Zhang Lihua begged the Spirit Chapter to recommend and deliver them. Rot and decay are rotten wood and dead grass; emitting smoke means the primordial qi revives. The returning immortals at Yueyang city south use elixir to save old trees thus. Infants can speak, the orifices open and clear; dead bones return to man. Xu Jia, once dry bones, was raised by Laozi with the Great Mysterious Life Talisman; this is the principle.

The mystery of the Three Treasures is the root of myriad things. Hence it is not known to ghosts and spirits, but heard by ordinary men.

The Jade Chapter is precious to the three honored guests; its function is to collect the roots of all births and growths. Tracing its profound principle, though ghosts and spirits have souls, none can hear it, much less ordinary men.

Those who study the highest Dao aspire to immortals; when obtaining corpse liberation, passing beyond transmigration, finally returning to the immortal path, spirit and form together without separation, both entering Dao truth. Without this text, the fetal knot stagnates, death qi solidifies the root of fate; true light cannot be guarded long; birth qi has no passage; the nine gates are blocked; the body is bereft of spirit; merely receiving one form as if qi dwells in the body. Those who learn this method can sit and cause nature.

The Way of the Supreme True has seven; the Way of the Most High three; the Way of the Middle True six; the Way of the Lower True eight. This chapter accords with the "Great Void Scripture Thirty-nine Chapters." Those who study immortality but are weak in power, not out of the three realms, only attain corpse liberation. Though escaping transmigration, these men finally return to the immortal path. If they can cherish form and preserve spirit, they approach the Dao. The "True Declaration" says a man dead as alive, feet not blue, skin not wrinkled, eyes bright like living, all corpse liberation. Without this text, one cannot obtain the Jade Chapter's great void essentials, cannot sever fetal knot stagnation, fearing death qi solidifying the root of life, true light cannot be long guarded. True light is spirit light. Though obtaining corpse liberation, one merely receives one form, as if qi dwells in the body; like dry wood with a brief spring, fluids not moistening, cannot long survive. Those who obtain this method possess the secret of blending myriad spirits. Generally, the body of man is born of the Three Qi; having received this brilliance, one becomes one with the Primordial, can blend with all mortal qi, and spirit follows. Initially with Three Qi giving birth to Three Spirits, dividing into Three Parts, Eight Scenes, Twenty-four Spirits. If one can blend and transform, the Three Five True Men form the primary unity; can call yang and summon yin, come and go without fixed place. Yang qi transforms to dragon and phoenix; yin qi to jade maiden; riding the whirlwind wheel beyond the eight extremes; sitting causes nature—how could this be false?

The Three Treasures are honored, the Nine Heavens utmost true, secret in the Great Possession, ninefold golden rack, purple yang jade terrace. Unless heaven and earth open as one, the text does not emerge. The Primordial forbids the book; ghosts and spirits cannot hear it. Stealing it means ten thousand kalpas of the wind blade, soul death without life. According to rites, it is reverently honored; form and spirit together are immortal.

According to the "Scripture of the Seven Transformations Injuring Heaven," the Supreme Pure Treasure Scripture has three hundred scrolls, seven thousand jade secrets, seven thousand talisman chapters, and the Natural Chapter, secret above the Nine Heavens in the Great Possession Palace; this is one of them. The ninefold golden rack and purple yang jade terrace are all places of scripture storage. Ninefold means ten sets; rack means the kinds of book shelves. The "Dao Treasure Scripture" mentions jade rack and golden rack; the secret is strictly guarded; how dare ghosts and spirits steal to see? When heaven and earth brighten, mysterious wind flows, true text and precious talisman descend in due time; after long reverence, surely awakening and understanding will come; fitting for form and spirit to become immortal.

In the Three Origin Palace dwell gold names, purple characters carved in the book; those born again should be persons of the Three Purities immortals, who shall obtain this text. Those with affinity will take funds and treasures, honor the master and exert the heart, follow the ritual and covenant, close heart and obey, be careful not to lightly reveal, lest the wind blade examine the person.

The Three Origins examine and judge, not only dead souls, but all who have attained or not attained the Way. Only gold names and purple characters distinguish those who study immortality. The Daoist Canon records the Three Origin examination of hell's grades, called the Ink Ledger, or black register. The gold names and purple characters are the difference between heaven and earth. Formerly Li Jue, commoner of Jiangyang, with long cultivation in the immortal register, though not elevated, his name was already used in the immortal official position in Huayang Dongtian. Not only the immortal family have this; for example, Emperor Yuan of Liang, when Prince of Xiangdong, recorded loyal ministers, righteous men, and those with excellent writings, with three types of writing pens: gold tube for loyalty and filial piety, silver tube for virtue, bamboo tube for literary excellence; also distinctions. This shows those with prior affinity and recorded in the immortal register may hold the Jade Chapter, fasting with gold treasure, honoring master and exerting heart, without lightly transmitting. Closing heart and obeying means resting heart and screening thoughts, quietly and firmly practicing scripture and teaching. Those who leak and are lax bring disaster upon themselves.

The method of cultivation: fasting one thousand days, not concerning worldly affairs, all dusts and leaks exhausted. Calm heart and silent recitation, holding pure incense and precepts, entering chamber facing east, knocking teeth nine times, adjusting voice and correct qi, reciting and chanting the precious chapter.

Fasting means single-minded and humble heart. The method of cultivation aims for accomplishment in three years. Before fasting, the heart contends with things, wind rushing, fire blazing, with no moment's rest. After fasting, thoughts are equalized, becoming deep and constant silence, one with the great void. The Dao scriptures record eight leaks: eye tears liver leak, nose mucus lung leak, mouth saliva kidney leak, external sweat heart leak, night sweat small intestine leak, drooling during sleep brain leak, dreams and spirits intercourse leak, lust body leak; when the heart lord is settled, these stop. Equal means level. Silent recitation means preserving thought to ultimate truth. Formerly Master Ge Xianweng fasted on Mount Tiantai, not yet a year, communicating with the supreme sage Qu Xin in the hidden chamber; this is the effect of long fasting. Enter chamber facing east, to harmonize with life qi. Knocking teeth: left is heavenly bell, striking ghosts; right is heavenly chime, gathering myriad spirits; middle is heavenly drum, greeting true sages. Knocking teeth, burning incense, adjusting voice and correct qi are all essential methods of reciting scripture.

Reciting once, voice heard in Nine Heavens. Reciting twice, heaven and earth set respect. Reciting thrice, three realms pay homage. Reciting four times, heavenly kings descend as immortals. Reciting five times, Five Emperors pay homage to truth. Reciting six times, demon kings bound. Reciting seven times, stars stop their gates. Reciting eight times, dark nights show light. Reciting nine times, all under heaven gather; all spirits guard the pavilion.

This chapter unites the subtle continuity of heaven and man; heaven and man have no two principles. My heart is the heart of heaven and earth; my qi is the qi of heaven and earth. Having held one sincerity, this response is thus. Once recited means opening and reciting one chapter, voice heard in the Nine Heavens. Formerly Lord Song Jing said one word and Mars withdrew. Tang blamed himself with six matters; a great rain over thousands of li. Such response is so; how much more reciting the voice of ancestral qi! The transformation of ancestral qi is great and universal over heaven and earth, the three realms, stars, constellations, and five phases; externally demons and kings, below ghosts and spirits, all are distributed and transformed by this, following place, according to good and evil, high and low. Twice recited, heavenly and earthly spirits hear and set respect. Thrice recited, three realms' divine beings bow to the scripture room. Four times, heavenly kings descend as immortals. Daoist heavenly gods have titles such as Dharma King and Heavenly King; responding and descending; like Master Ge Xianweng's diligent fasting, causing Master Xu to descend and transmit scripture. Five times, Five Emperors, masters of five qi, see the true scripture and honor it. Six times, demon kings of yin number six, great demons of the six heavens, arranged by Primordial. Ritual fasting has methods of commanding demons to drive them away, making them hear the scripture, bind their bodies, and dare not offend. Seven times, stars stop gates, that is the "Scripture of Salvation" spinning wheel, divine light greatly fixed. Eight times, dark night shows light, yin broken by yang. Nine times, all under heaven gather, spirits guard the pavilion. As Li Shun recited the "Great Void Scripture" three years, one night suddenly a thousand flying immortals gathered in the air, divine light illuminating the chamber, thus obtaining the Way. The merit and virtue responded; corpse dwelling and dragon appearing; profound silence and thunder; unbidden and spontaneous.

Once recited penetrates heaven, the fetal root is declared and communicated.

The foregoing words respond without; this speaks of internal功 to clarify the method of returning the elixir of the Great Void. Once recited the fetal root is declared and communicated means Heaven One produces water. Man's birth begins from the fetal root, condensing embryo yellow and spreading qi, flowing and rising and falling, not losing its measure, then the intent of birth gradually grows. If the fetal root is not open, surely there will be the trouble of heavenly gate. Cultivators of truth, at the first internal elixir work, fix thoughts and breath, gathering spirit; at the gate of life below, from there opening communication.

Twice recited sounds earth, the fetus knot dissolves root.

Earth two produces fire, in the second month the fetus is formed. Still afraid that death qi fixes the root, making it knot firmly, must rely on true qi to fumigate and scatter, then nurture long. The "Supreme Pure Dongxuan Scripture" has a talisman of the Taiyi Emperor Lord releasing three gates and twelve knots, written in vermilion on green bamboo slips, with incantations to release them.

Thrice recited divine rite, soul gate refines immortality.

Heaven three produces wood; in man it is the soul. At three months yin and yang begin to divide, soul obtains form. The soul gate is on the left, belonging to yang. The three transitions of elixir work; yang qi suffices. Its method is to concentrate spirit and breath to nurture it; thus spirit and wisdom naturally arise; the Blue Emperor guards the soul, the Wood Duke records and writes.

Four times recited heavenly king descends as immortal, the gate of the po closes.

Earth four produces metal; in man it is the po. The po is born in the fourth month; the gate of po is on the right, belonging to yin. The four transitions of elixir refining use yang to nurture yin, making po and soul mutually borne. Its method uses the nose as heavenly aperture, connecting to the lungs. The lungs govern po, calm and unmoving, cutting off the coming and going breath, called closing the gate. Naturally, the pool water is full, watering the heart network, heart fire descends, kidney water rises, Ding and Ren combine to unite with the inner elixir. If the gate is not closed, the soul disperses and wanders, following dreams to come and go; the soul cannot control, acting at will, finally entering the host of ghosts.

Five times recited Five Emperors pay homage to truth, viscera and bowels clear and cold.

Heaven five produces earth; in man the fifth month, five phase qi sufficient, birth of five viscera six bowels. The five viscera: heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney. The six bowels: small intestine, gall, stomach, large intestine, bladder, triple burner. Clear and cool means peaceful and not vexed. Cultivators of truth, abstaining from desires, kidneys do not leak essence; silent and still, heart does not lose spirit; fixed breath, lungs can calm po; simple vision, liver can nurture soul; concentrated thought, spleen can calm intent. Yellow center governs principle, maintaining harmony and unity, spirit, soul, and po, intent gathered as one. This is called the clustering of the five phases; its qi ascends to the mud pellet, called paying homage to truth. Then the Blue Emperor guards the soul, the White Emperor attends the po, the Red Emperor nurtures qi, the Black Emperor opens blood, the Yellow Emperor presides centrally, myriad spirits do not transgress.

Six times recited demon king submits and agrees, stomach tube produces fluids.

Demon king internally means six desires. Agree means compliance. Controlled by the Jade Chapter, hence subdued. The stomach and spleen are external wrappers, storing grains and water to nourish the five viscera. The "Classic of Difficulties" says the qi of the five viscera all meet in the stomach. Moreover, the moistening and drying depend on thought. If thought is led astray by six desires, the proper path is lost, then food becomes saliva, meeting sorrow becomes tears, shame produces sweat, anger rushes blood, outgoing and not returning. The internal nourishment is lost; essence, qi, and spirit then disperse and leak; only dry bones remain, that is the dead. If the six demons submit and agree, thought is correct and governed within, then fluids are born in the stomach cavity, watering the limbs, moistening the elixir cauldron; essence, qi, and spirit thereby condense; this is the way of the living.

Seven times recited stars and constellations brighten, orifices open and clear.

Heaven has seven luminaries; man has seven orifices; by the seventh month all open to govern sight, hearing, eating, breathing, and excretion. Some say brightness and clarity originate in the heart; seven respond to fire numbers. The wise person has seven holes in the heart, thus is bright and clear. The foolish open few, or partially, hence dull and turbid. The seven transitions of elixir work, heavy gates open blockages, upper and lower bright and clear. The "Scripture of the Seal of the Heart" says: seven orifices are all connected, each bright; sacred sun and moon shine upon the golden court.

Eight times recited dark night reveals light, three parts and eight scenes, complete form and spirit.
