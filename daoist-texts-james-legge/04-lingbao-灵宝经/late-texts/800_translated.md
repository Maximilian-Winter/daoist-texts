The Supreme Cavernous Mysterious Spiritual Treasure Highest Grade Precept Scripture

At that time, the Celestial Venerable, on the first day of the seventh month in the first year of the Kaihuang era, at noon, in the fragrant mulberry forest of the floating net precincts on Mount Yucha of the Western Nayu Kingdom, imparted the Supreme Dao Lord’s highest grade great precept text of wisdom. At that moment the Dao Lord received the precepts, prostrated with head to the ground, turned his mind to the ten directions, and meditated upon the Three Honoured Ones. Then the host of heavenly immortals soared down from the sky, riding upon dragon chariots and tiger carriages, phoenix litters and luan palanquins, waving green banners and feather fans, amidst azure mist and coloured clouds, immortal flowers and precious standards, shining with brilliant light; the cranes cried loudly, music sounded clearly; they descended from the air surrounded with coloured rain, and came to the Daoist assembly. Immortal men and jade maidens circled about, burning incense as they moved, chanting praises, bowing and gazing in reverence. The Celestial Venerable smiled gently, his countenance radiated light, and spoke the precepts for the salvation of men; those who heard were freed from calamities.

The Celestial Venerable commanded all good men and good women, and the heavenly officers, that on the first day of each month two youths should descend to the human realm to examine their good and evil deeds, and to record men’s rights and wrongs. Those who do good deeds have their merits inscribed in the celestial register; those who do evil have their evil names recorded in the underworld. After death, the good enjoy blessings, the evil suffer calamities. Therefore, exhorting all men, on the first morning of the New Year they should wear square-coloured fresh garments, assemble at their Daoist halls, have their names inscribed on bamboo and silk, and report upwards to the celestial officials to make known the good deeds of the year. On the first day of each month, in the spiritual palace, they should hear the precepts, to understand the connection and cultivate goodness for the month. At the place where the precepts are taught, men and women sitting together harmoniously, fixing their minds upon their names, each quietly concentrating, sitting down to listen, hearing the precepts and awakening to the Dao, realizing the patience of non-arising. Those who come to this gate of the law should be jade maidens, golden spirits, their bodies in accord with the Dao qi, accompanied by immortal countenances, in wondrous speech, with true faith in the teaching, willing to hear the Celestial Venerable speak the precepts, while the earthly deities offer treasures. Then arise the devoted heavenly maidens, the patient immortals, crowned with stars shining at their heads, moon mantles illuminating their bodies, holding offerings and bowing reverently. Thus they speak the ten supreme vows, and proclaim them before the assembly.

First, to vow to give up the flesh of the body to feed hungry birds and beasts.

Second, to vow the body’s eight rich oils, to burn lamps and extend light.

Third, to vow to exert strength in returning merits, aiding those who bear burdens.

Fourth, when seeing poverty and nakedness, to vow to bestow food and clothing.

Fifth, when meeting the sick, to vow to give decoctions and medicines.

Sixth, when seeing the needs of others, to vow to supply what is timely.

Seventh, when those are suffering distress, to vow to cause joy according to circumstance.

Eighth, when prisoners are punished and killed, to vow to substitute the penalty with one’s own body.

Ninth, in the case of pregnant women, to vow early to resolve the foetus.

Tenth, in border garrisons and expeditions, to vow early to return safely.

Having made these ten vows, tears rained and sorrowful lamentations arose, and they addressed the Celestial Venerable: "Your disciple’s offences and obstacles are truly deep; we wish to hear the wondrous precepts." The Venerable Master, sorrowful and displeased, wept and said: "Men and women have especially heavy obstacles and karma; to leave and attain the wondrous Dharma is a great matter of conditions. I shall now open it to you, to universally save sentient beings. Their roots and foundations of consciousness are shallow; what can knowledge do? Alas, how grievous! Life is wasted in vain, sinking and drowning in the six paths. I now speak to this audience these precept texts, that you may awaken, return your minds, and take refuge in the right path; those with offences should repent, those without offences should listen silently."

The Celestial Venerable said to the Supreme Dao Lord: "Now we must exhort precepts, to open the enlightenment of sentient beings, to remove disasters and misfortunes for men and women, to request blessings and save lives, to uproot all sources of suffering. The living will see the Dao, their bodies freed from the eight hardships; the dead will obtain joy, and not endure the three tortures. Entrusting their retribution to men and heavens, they receive supreme honour. Practising fasting and seeking the Dao, revolving as holy kings. All should with one heart request and observe the ten exhortations of the precepts; receive them attentively and do not forget; keep them in mind; do not be confused; listen silently and quietly."

The first exhortation is to revere the Three Treasures, support the Dharma masters, expound the sutras, cultivate life and teach goodness, act as exemplary persons, instruct the worthy and talented, honour the gates and families, glorify the clan.

The second exhortation is to copy scriptures, cause people to read and recite them, widely hear wondrous praises, hear clearly through generations, clarify meaning, and propagate the chapters and sentences.

The third exhortation is to cultivate the spiritual temples, practice fasting and abstinence, offer various sweet foods, support the worthy sages, repay these nobles, clothing and food natural.

The fourth exhortation is to offer incense and oil, light lamps to shine everywhere, observe the flourishing of the world, keep clean and intelligent, countenance incomparable, heavenly features lofty and elegant.

The fifth exhortation is to give to revered masters immortal robes and Dharma garments, so that persons in the world may live in refined ease, not fall to border lands, always be born in the central kingdom, families inherit crowns, men and women be upright and dignified.

The sixth exhortation is for all men and women to honour and support parents, revere relatives and friends, care for the weak and receive the strong, love those below and pacify those above, so that in the world they shall receive reward, and children and nephews be worthy and good.

The seventh exhortation is to aid the sick with food, drink, decoctions and medicine, compassionately healing and rescuing, the highest field of blessing, being great medical kings, receiving supreme honour.

The eighth exhortation is to give to the poor, forgo one’s own clothing and food, so that they may be full and warm, prolong life and live in peace, and see the world’s gates honoured, and abundance in families.

The ninth exhortation is to harbour no envy or jealousy towards others, always practise restraint of thought, do not make enemies, abandon poisonous hearts, and meet others with joy.

The tenth exhortation is to make offerings to the Celestial Venerable’s holy images; whether there be cessation of suffering or death, or falling into hardship or disaster, all shall be saved and protected.

The Celestial Venerable said: "These ten important exhortations and essential precepts, you must truly believe and practise. Good and evil karmic connections will surely receive retribution. Those who live in wealth and honour and laugh at the poor and humble shall surely receive poverty and lowliness in return. Those who live with beauty and laugh at the ugly shall surely be made ugly in return. Those who live with intelligence and do not teach others shall surely receive ignorance as retribution. Those who live healthy and laugh at the sick shall surely suffer sickness in return. Those who do not believe in the Daoist teachings and laugh at the scriptures shall surely receive stubbornness and violence as retribution. Those who live by seizing others’ husbands shall surely have few descendants as retribution. Those who entice others’ wives shall surely be widowed and solitary as retribution. Those who set their hearts as husband and wife shall receive retribution unlike that of born persons on the path. Those who delight in killing and taking life shall surely have short lives and untimely deaths as retribution. Therefore I exhort all men to do good and receive good retribution; do evil and suffer evil calamity; opposition is of no avail; there is no rescue. Man has one mind, which contains the six consciousnesses; performing good and evil deeds, encountering occasions and conditions, wisdom opens and passion closes; the true gate does not move, and one shall attain the immortal Dao. I now further speak of the six passions precepts, for highest and middle persons, that they should open their enlightenment.

First, the eyes shall not gaze widely and disorder the splendid colours; lest the pupils lose their light and the eyes be dimmed. At their eye root they can control the brightness; immortals appear in the world.

Second, the ears shall not hear confusedly, mingled with the five tones; lest the spirit be harmed and rightness spoiled; painful sounds and lamentations at their ear root; they can control the music; immortals appear in the world.

Third, the nose shall not be broad and full, nor mingled with foul airs; stinking and fishy scents disordering, harming the spirit and stirring desire; at their nose root they can control the accumulation of fragrance; immortals appear in the world.

Fourth, the mouth shall not crave flavours, nor be mixed with greasy and various kinds; the six bowels be violated, the five viscera, spleen and lungs, at their tongue root; they can control Dharma joy; immortals appear in the world.

Fifth, there shall be no desire to shake the passions; the body not receiving contact; the vital essence thus peaceful; guarding the mind is foremost; at their unique root, they can establish wisdom; immortals appear in the world.

Sixth, the mind shall have no disturbance; the thought not clinging to conditions; original nature empty and serene, clear and able to be firm; in all their conditions they can control the Dharma gates; immortals appear in the world.

The Celestial Venerable said: "These six roots are great afflictions of the body. Though men and women be born again, and receive human form, if their six passions be not pure, not having seen the scriptures, or heard the Dharma sound, they will not know themselves, but sink deep in the gates of crime, receiving short lives, not fulfilling heavenly destiny, abiding long in evil paths, very pitiable indeed. Therefore this precept is spoken, to open and save men and heavens. With good hearts revering and believing, submitting and taking refuge in the Cavernous Mysterious, with emotions calm and spirits quiet, the fate is prolonged. The Supreme Ultimate Perfected Ones receive the six precepts, attain the six penetrations, joyfully leap, sing and chant praises."

The Celestial Venerable said: "Good men and good women sitting here, hearing this praise and acclaim, observing the precepts without deficiency, shall attain the true Dao. If any man praises and recites these precepts, after death he shall not be detained by evil karma, and shall surely have offences extinguished. Again: When a man has illness arising, and does not care for his body, vain thoughts become disaster, clinging and causing sickness, mostly without awakening. I shall now speak of this maze of hundred diseases, briefly listing ten kinds; if you wish to hear the origin of illnesses, listen quietly.

Poison and killing men is one disease; the monk’s other wish to die is a second disease.

Lust and bad virtue is a third disease; pursuing old evils is a fourth disease.

Not accepting counsel is a fifth disease; being obstinate and self-willed is a sixth disease.

Teaching men to harm men is a seventh disease; forcibly seizing another’s possessions is an eighth disease.

Loving to complain and blame is a ninth disease; using power to threaten and coerce is a tenth disease.

If one desires to be healed of these ten diseases, one must use medicine and be confident in the remedy.

Weak body and gentle nature is a wondrous medicine; acting with broad mind and harmony is a wondrous medicine.

Near to virtue and far from lust is a wondrous medicine; not taking others’ wealth is a wondrous medicine.

Rescuing disasters and helping difficulties is a wondrous medicine; supporting the old and weak is a wondrous medicine.

Receiving insult without blame is a wondrous medicine; restraining anger is a wondrous medicine.

Keeping far from suspicion and avoidance is a wondrous medicine; mind quiet and intention settled is a wondrous medicine.

Speaking of this wondrous medicine, corresponding to the diseases, if one does not use mind to treat, sudden death will come, and the time of transmigration arrive. Words left to the world say thus:

The great sage’s equal mind speaks the true immortal precepts, desiring all sentient beings to gather in the hall of ten thousand blessings. Those with blessings aspire to heavenly immortals, reciting the Spiritual Treasure precepts; on the day of new moon and full moon, they request to ascend the lion’s seat. Upright in body, regulating the vital breath, harmonious in tone, speaking the wondrous sutra. Compassionate to the lower world’s men who do not believe the highest precepts, they wander the sea of suffering, without birth, in the wondrous heaven of bliss. Those who hold and receive these precepts immediately enter the ranks of immortals and sages. Each silently listens, each gradually sends forth the mind of Dao.

First, counting to the end of the age, the world will grow dark.

Second, promulgate the right Dharma, virtue fitting the heavens and earth.

Third, obey wind and rain, kindly open the gates of sweet dew.

Fourth, pity withered bones, spirits’ talismans repel and return souls.

Fifth, ancestors above, bless and protect descendants below.

Sixth, many evil natures, changing and producing good roots.

Seventh, reverse short life, extend life and long preservation.

Eighth, ancient sins, all receive holy grace.

Ninth, liberation marks, remove obstacles and erase stains.

Tenth, gradually accumulate quantity, to attain unsurpassed honour.

The Perfected One teaches the precepts saying: Why not cultivate and maintain them? Now is the proper time; every inch of time is precious; do not waste the fleeting light; it is fitting to be secret and wondrous; only those who practise and verify will know."

Exhortation to the Precepts, in verse:

Human life already consumed, like fire in hard fat.

The four great elements are like branches and leaves, the five aggregates like flowers and fruits.

In prime years one should be diligent in study; how can one keep notions of self?

When blessings are exhausted, spirit and consciousness disperse; one should obscurely sit in hell.

The highest saints fear sinking and drowning; seek the Dao to cross this calamity.

The great earth and all things rely and rest, each having a spirit.

Finally awaiting the kalpa’s number, blessings exhausted, heaven and earth collapse.

Returning and going among the five paths, departing and coming again, death and birth.

The foolish man does not believe the Dharma, and sins and pains constantly torment him.

If you desire to cross this calamity, take refuge in the Supreme Scripture.

Expound the highest wondrous precepts, receive them as bodily treasure.

Studying perseveringly with distress and craving; treating the body, regret not having started early.

All should uncover the profound mysteries; swiftly they devastate man’s old age.

Therefore I, at a young age, abandoned the world and hastened to learn the Dao.

The Celestial Venerable spoke these precepts to all the great assemblies, the kings of the heavens, the hosts of heavenly beings, the kings of countries and their peoples, the queens and attendants of the palaces, the eight divisions of dragons and spirits, the saints of the ten directions, the Brahma kings and heavenly emperors, all the true ones of the three realms, the emperors of the five directions, the spiritual lords of the four poles — such multitudes cannot all be named. Hearing the precept scripture, all attained the true Dao. The blind saw forms; the dumb spoke; the lame walked; the deaf heard; all the earth’s patients were healed; hell ceased to burn, and they forever left the ghostly paths. There were then five thousand scholars, gifted in literature and discourse on heaven, elevated among the nation’s worthy and virtuous, seeking crowns and honours, turning their hearts to reverence the Dao, prostrating and taking refuge.

The Celestial Venerable, compassionate, at once transmitted liberation, each bestowed jade slips, universally granted golden crowns, Dharma robes and immortal garments; the heavens upheld the offerings; clear streams and open spaces; blue heavens and carefree ease; breathing in the qi and eating clouds; riding dragons and controlling cranes. The multitude rejoiced, singing praises to the clear void, flying immortals in the air, inscribing secret registers, guiding and receiving in the clouds, pointing to the heavenly gate, awakening to the Dao and certifying the truth, dwelling in quiet joy. Those who reverence the scriptures, believe, accept and practise.
