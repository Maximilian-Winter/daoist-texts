# The Scripture of the Supreme Cave Mysterious Spiritual Treasure Lower Origin Yellow Register: Treatise on Simplicity, Text and Dignified Protocol (Dunhuang Edition)

Title of the Scripture: The Scripture of the Supreme Cave Mysterious Spiritual Treasure Lower Origin Yellow Register: Treatise on Simplicity, Text and Dignified Protocol. Abbreviated as "Yellow Register Simplicity Text". The author is unknown; it is roughly dated to the Eastern Jin Dynasty. It forms one of the ancient "Spiritual Treasure Scriptures". Lu Xiujing in his "Cave Mysterious Spiritual Treasure Transmission of the Ordination Rites" has already quoted this scripture. The original text comprised one scroll; it is not included in the "Orthodox Taoist Canon". The following is taken from the Dunhuang fragmentary copy.

(Fragment R3148 copy, preceding text lost)

In the exposed text at the central altar, no wind is present through the night; the text is not stirred by wind; when the True One is duly united, then transmission is permitted. If blown by the wind, it denotes that the person is not united, and transmission must not be made rashly; to transgress the regulations and violate the law is to be examined by the Office of the Clear Brahman.

The Lower Origin Yellow Register Simplicity Text, Spirit Immortal Section, says: Regarding the protocol for conferring the scripture, the disciple with sufficient faith and sincerity requests to receive the scriptural text; all must first be measured and assessed according to their grade to receive the books and texts. The exposed altar remains all night without wind or darkness; the text is not shaken or blown; the bones and qi are called lawful and proper; they swear the oath and then transmit. If blown by the wind, the person must retreat to fasting thrice and then begin anew as before according to the law. If blown by the wind three times, and the person first had no mysterious name or good merit, then he is not to be raised in the Three Realms, nor protected by the Five Emperors; the bones and qi are not united, and he must not lightly transmit. This is to be examined by the Office of Rectification.

The Lower Origin Yellow Register Simplicity Text, Spirit Immortal Section, says: Regarding the protocol for receiving the scripture, one with faith and sincerity approaches the master and requests to receive the scripture titles. The master, measuring grade and not meeting the conditions, must not immediately confer the ordination. The person must retreat again to fasting, reflect upon his faults and shortcomings; he must not expect speedily to receive it, lest resentment and anger arise, extending to fellow students, provoking anger against the master's treasure. This is to be examined by the Office of the Four Luminaries.

The Lower Origin Yellow Register Simplicity Text, Spirit Immortal Section, says: Regarding the protocol for receiving the scripture, the scripture has ranks and order; one is to accord with bowing and raising, and confer according to merit and measure; the wise and the foolish are to be properly matched; the sequence is to be observed in order; each union must accord with the mysterious canon. There must be no transgression or omission; the weight and lightness must be appropriate. This is to be examined by the Grand Ritual Office.

The Lower Origin Yellow Register Simplicity Text, Spirit Immortal Section, says: Regarding the protocol for receiving the scripture, the merit and faith must be complete according to the regulations; one swears allegiance to the Five Emperors and enumerates the various heavens. There must be no stinginess or greed, no parsimony of wealth or desire for favour; one must not seek the scripture without faith, nor despise the law or scorn the True Ones. This is to be examined by the Office of Heaven Surveillance.

The Lower Origin Yellow Register Simplicity Text, Spirit Immortal Section, says: Having obtained the protocol for the scripture, if one has no master or patriarch, does not concern the Five Mountains, nor swear allegiance to the heavens, but privately exchanges and lends, transmitting ordination to others, the soul and spirit are liable to be cut by the wind blades; the Seven Ancestors are imprisoned by the ghost officials; the long discipleship endures ten thousand kalpas; there is no origin at the end of heaven. This is to be examined by the Office of the Demonic Execution.

The Lower Origin Yellow Register Simplicity Text, Spirit Immortal Section, says: Regarding the protocol for receiving the scripture, swearing allegiance to the Five Emperors and making oath to the heavens, one should diligently cultivate and seek response; one must not lightly divulge or falsely show the scripture to others, nor openly discuss the titles; nor reveal the True Ones of Heaven. This is to be examined by the Office of Heavenly Oaths.

The Lower Origin Yellow Register Simplicity Text, Spirit Immortal Section, says: The merit and protocol consist in reverential worship of the Three Precious Divinities and Scriptures, adherence to the Three Masters, offering incense and lamp-light, and diligent and unwearied merit. One is thus raised in the Three Realms, acclaimed by the various heavens; the name is inscribed in the Mysterious Register among the superior Immortal ranks; all Seven Ancestors are enabled to ascend to the Heaven of Birth, freely roaming the Seven Precious Palaces, receiving blessings naturally. The merit proceeds from the Office of Supreme Origin Spirit Power.

The Lower Origin Yellow Register Simplicity Text, Spirit Immortal Section, says: The misconduct and protocol consist in reviling the Three Treasures, disrespecting the master and patriarch; one is punished by the territorial deities, and upon death the wind blades cut; ten thousand kalpas without reprieve; the Seven Ancestors fill the night; the world is without light. This is to be examined by the Netherworld Office.

The Lower Origin Yellow Register Simplicity Text, Spirit Immortal Section, says: The merit and protocol consist in observing the master's law, and conferring ordination upon three disciples as ordained scripture teachers; those receiving the law are immediately numbered among the meritorious deities of the heavens; when merit and name are established, they can associate in the Three Realms, with the Five Emperors as guests; the merit and mysterious name come from the Office of Clear Power.

The Lower Origin Yellow Register Simplicity Text, Spirit Immortal Section, says: The misconduct and protocol consist in receiving the law but not conferring ordination upon disciples as scripture teachers; merit is not established, the heavens have no name for one; one must not ascend fasting to recite scripture; cultivation is without protocol; one is punished by the Three Officials, the soul and spirit disperse, the will is not concentrated. This is to be examined by the Office of Clear Law.

The Lower Origin Yellow Register Simplicity Text, Spirit Immortal Section, says: The merit and protocol consist in observing the master's law, and conferring ordination upon seven disciples as record teachers; those receiving the law are immediately numbered among the meritorious deities of the heavens; their names are spoken among the Immortal ranks; they are promoted to the Seven Ancestors, advancing to the Heaven of Birth. Good merit proceeds from the Office of Clear Power.

The Lower Origin Yellow Register Simplicity Text, Spirit Immortal Section, says: The misconduct and protocol consist in receiving the law but not conferring ordination upon disciples as record teachers; merit is not established, the heavens have no name for one; one may not obtain the Great Eight-section Vow, nor report name to the Five Emperors, nor recite the Spiritual Chapters. Such offenses are held by the Three Officials; this is to be examined by the Office of Clear Law.

The Lower Origin Yellow Register Simplicity Text, Spirit Immortal Section, says: The merit and protocol consist in observing the master's law, and conferring ordination upon nine disciples as ordaining teachers; those receiving the law are immediately numbered among the meritorious deities of the heavens; their names are spoken in white registers; their merit is great; the nine ancestors ascend together, all attain freedom in the Seven Precious Woods; merit and name proceed from the Office of Clear Power.

The Lower Origin Yellow Register Simplicity Text, Spirit Immortal Section, says: The misconduct and protocol consist in receiving the law but not conferring ordination upon disciples as ordaining teachers; merit is not established, the heavens have no name for one; one may not participate in the Three Divisions and Eight Scenes and Twenty Mysteries, nor ride the celestial steeds of the highest officials; merit and name are not established. Receiving the Great Law lightly, one is held by the Three Officials, facing the pains of life and death. This is to be examined by the Office of Clear Law.

The Lower Origin Yellow Register Simplicity Text, Spirit Immortal Section, says: The merit and protocol consist in receiving the Great Law in the body; one must establish good merit, first for ancestors and then for oneself; one confers ordination for the master, merits accrue to the master, and one’s name is spoken among the heavens. Then one may receive one’s master's patriarch; merit accomplished, one ascends by day to heaven. Merit proceeds from the Office of Protocol.

The Lower Origin Yellow Register Simplicity Text, Spirit Immortal Section, says: The misconduct and protocol consist in receiving the Great Law in the body but not establishing good merit for the Three Masters; the master has no recorded name or origin; the heavens have no name of merit; thus the Three Realms do not register the life’s degree; the territorial deities do not terminate the root of death; no merit in study. This is to be examined by the Office of the Nine Capitals.

The Lower Origin Yellow Register Simplicity Text, Spirit Immortal Section, says: Observing the scripture protocol, when merit is not established and the Three Masters have no merit recorded, though the term of receiving the law be fulfilled, when worthy ones request the law, one must confer ordination within the Three Masters’ gate, and the master must measure and confer upon disciples; one must not accept rites without merit, nor confer lightly by oneself. This is to be examined by the Office of Examination and Rectification.

The Lower Origin Yellow Register Simplicity Text, Spirit Immortal Section, says: Observing the scripture protocol, when conferring merit for the master and ordaining disciples, and merit is full and virtue complete, the name register is inscribed. If the term of receiving the law is not complete, and worthy ones request the law, the master must issue a yellow formal document to disciples; when merit is full, then ordination may be conferred. If the master does not issue such a document and confers ordination lightly, the Five Emperors will take charge, and life and death will bear the responsibility; the offense is the same as leaking the scripture. This is to be examined by the Office of the Four Luminaries.

The Lower Origin Yellow Register Simplicity Text, Spirit Immortal Section, says: Observing the scripture protocol, if before the term is complete one transmits the scripture, one is held by the Three Officials; the body bears the wind blades, death is imprisonment in hell; the Seven Ancestors fill the night, the dark prison endures ten thousand kalpas. This is to be examined by the Office of the Four Luminaries.

The Lower Origin Yellow Register Simplicity Text, Spirit Immortal Section, says: Observing the scripture protocol, when merit and virtue are complete and the term fulfilled, if worthy ones request to receive, one must transmit according to the regulations; one must not conceal or cut off the law’s gate. This is to be examined by the Office of the Great Yin.

The Lower Origin Yellow Register Simplicity Text, Spirit Immortal Section, says: Observing the scripture protocol, when ascending fasting to recite the scripture, one should bathe with fragrant water and incense, to refine the spirit qi and divine qi; if spirit and qi are not refined, the soul will be distraught and fall away.

1. Seven fragmentary copies of this scripture have been discovered among the Dunhuang manuscripts, numbered R3148, P3663, W11969A, W11969D, UX0158, BD14841K, BD1484J. All are fragmentary and untitled. Ouyen Ren'er’s "Catalogue of Dunhuang Taoist Scriptures" mistakenly titles the scripture as "The Scripture of the Supreme Cave Mysterious Spiritual Treasure Gold Register Simplicity Text of the Three Origins Dignified Protocol Natural True Scripture". The present title is based on the content of the copies.

2. "Exposed text" originally written as "spiritual text", supplemented according to Lu Xiujing’s citation.

3. The characters "blown by" were missing from the original, supplemented by Lu Xiujing’s citation.

6. According to the R3148 and P3663 copies and the first five passages of P3663, the content is all "Observing the Protocol of Receiving the Scripture"; from this point onward, the text is "Protocol for Extracting and Redeeming the Root of Sin". The "Unspeakable Secret Essentials" volume 54 extracts about forty such protocols from the latter half of this scripture. The present translation uses the "Secret Essentials" as a collational text to supplement missing Dunhuang text.

7. The phrase "Eastern Gate Inscription" is corrected from a copying error "East Gate Title" as per the "Secret Essentials".

8. The three-character phrase "Southern Gate" is missing in the copy and supplemented by the "Secret Essentials".

9. The "Xun Palace" is corrected from a copying error "Xuan Palace" as per the "Secret Essentials".

10. Two lines of text here in the original copy are obscured and supplemented by the "Secret Essentials".

11. The "Secret Essentials" adds a further passage titled "Incense Prayer" after this sentence.

12. P3663 copy ends here; the following lines are supplemented from the "Unspeakable Secret Essentials" citations, referencing Dunhuang script style.

13. The above two citations from "Secret Essentials" are supplemented, but boxed characters appear in Dunhuang S2969 fragment, which is a composite of multiple small fragments; seven fragments remain with 18 lines and 57 characters, also seen in "Secret Essentials" volume 54, thereby identified as part of the "Lower Origin Yellow Register Simplicity Scripture" fragment.

14. The Russian collection UX158 copy, and Chinese National Library holdings BD14841K and BD1484J copies are all severely damaged; two fragments combined preserve 84 lines of scripture, which by content can be assigned to the present scripture. The present translation uses these copies as the base text, supplemented and corrected by the "Secret Essentials".

15. UX158 ends at this line, continued by BD14841 fragment.

16. BD14841K ends here, continued by BD14841J copy.

17. In the copies, "various gods and immortals" is mistakenly rendered "inviting gods and immortals", corrected by "Secret Essentials".

18. The two characters for "parents" appear in both preceding and following entries and the "Secret Essentials", possibly a textual expansion.

19. BD14842 fragment ends here; following text supplemented by the "Secret Essentials".
