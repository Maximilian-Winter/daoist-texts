## The Scripture of the Cavern Mystery, Spirit Treasure, Abode of Long Night, Nine Nether Jade Casket: The Clear and True Precepts

In the time of the Primordial Celestial Worthy, within the Fragrant Grove Garden, together with seven thousand two hundred and forty youths, He taught and transformed the laws, delivered beings with His radiant majesty. Then the Celestial Worthy emitted five-coloured light, penetrating and illuminating the heavens’ Long Joyful Blessing Hall, and the boundless worlds of the ten directions, the realms of hell.

At that time the youths were all in one place, and beheld the men and women of the heavenly blessing halls, good and virtuous persons, roaming free and without action, their clothing and food natural and unforced; and everywhere they perceived in the boundless worlds of hell the prisoners and exiles, the hungry ghosts and dead souls, naked and without clothing, their heads and feet fettered, standing upon knife mountains, bearing iron staves, great and small linked together, their five limbs corrupted, no longer of human form. When hungry they ate charcoal, when thirsty they drank fiery essence, drifting through the three paths and eight hardships.

Then the highest wise youth closed his eyes and prostrated himself on the ground, bowing his head and addressing the Celestial Worthy: 'Today, attending Your seat, I have seen the root fates of good and evil in the heavens and hells, my heart shaken and my thoughts fearful, my five spirits sorrowful and anxious. I dare, relying on the mercy of Heaven, to humbly ask without end, desiring to inquire. Only do I hope that the Celestial Worthy will by some means open the hearts of the ignorant, directly bestow instructions, fully unfold the profound teaching, so that all may attain clarity. The people of future generations who see not the precepts and rules and so must walk into the five turbid and poisonous cauldrons, encountering disaster and harm, unable to save their bodies—whether male or female—shall be as now seen in hell, prisoners, hungry ghosts, and exiles’ souls, doomed to endless ages of suffering without return, ignorant and without response, truly lamentable. I pray that the clear and true precepts and rules may be established, to serve as the causes and conditions of goodness for those born into the world, so that in every generation they may obtain this great blessing, escape the roots of suffering, be delivered from the three paths, and ascend to heaven.'

The Primordial Celestial Worthy said: 'Good, good indeed. Thy inquiry is profound. The clear and true precepts and rules of the Abode of Long Night, Nine Nether Jade Casket, fully declare the causes and conditions of sin and blessing, past destinies, good and evil retribution, the removal of roots of suffering, exhortations to govern conduct, the body’s entry into light, the turning from evil to good, and final return to the gate of blessing. Its method is vast and universal, widely delivering heaven and man, bestowing grace upon life and death, freeing from the eight hardships, transcending the three realms, enjoying natural felicity, rejoicing in blessings without end. Now I proclaim it for thee; observe it in secrecy.'

The highest wise youth stepped forward and made obeisance, kneeling long and bowing his head, addressing the Celestial Worthy: 'I inquire now concerning all that I have seen throughout the heavens’ blessing halls and the boundless worlds of hell, the causes and conditions of good and evil retribution, whence they arise. By what practices in life is flying achieved? Roaming free in the Upper Clarity, attaining high immortal rank? By what causes is the body freed from corpse, extinguished and non-acting? By what causes does one die and not rest, but return again to rebirth? By what causes does one die and supplement the celestial officers, the body shining with light? By what causes does one die and be born among the heavens, as honoured guests of the Most High? By what causes does one die and be free from restraint, associating with the Five Emperors? By what causes does one die and receive titles, becoming spirit gods on earth? By what causes does one die and become among the saints, driving clouds in their chariots? By what causes does one die and ascend to the blessing halls, clothing and food natural? By what causes does one die and ascend to the Southern Palace, returning to be born among men? By what causes does one die and enter hell, the long night without end? By what causes does one die and suffer Chu’s poison, ten thousand pains added to the body? By what causes does one die and be denied food, among hungry ghosts? By what causes does one die and suffer separation, the body broken and torn? By what causes does one die and be a prisoner, drifting among the Three Officials? By what causes does one die and enter the boiling cauldron, no longer of human form? By what causes does one die and follow the sword tree, the wind knives coming and going? By what causes does one’s head and face burn, crowned with fiery mountains? By what causes is the body without clothing, bearing an iron staff? By what causes is the body shorn and mutilated, bearing stones without rest? By what causes does one die and suffer chains and fetters, confined in the three lights? By what causes does one drive on as if in extremity, eating and breathing without peace? By what causes is the tongue pulled out and pierced with iron spikes? By what causes does one die and be drawn in the dark waves, to pour into the four rivers? Now, having seen such among the hells, what have they offended in life to receive such retribution? Their souls and spirits are in pain to this degree. I wonder how many years it will be before they are delivered; on the day of deliverance, they shall be born as beasts and return to the human realm. I pray to distinguish and explain the roots of fate, to declare the conditions of future birth and the causes of goodness; if it be granted to open understanding, I receive the holy grace.'

The Celestial Worthy then commanded to summon the flying heavenly spirits of the ten directions, and opened the Abode of Long Night, Nine Nether Jade Casket, producing the clear and true precepts and rules to rescue the youths. At that time the great holy ones of the heavens, the primordial revered deities, immortals and jade maidens, countless as the sands, came together without number to the seat. Heaven scattered fragrant flowers; divine dragons played music; songs flew abroad on four sides; beautiful sounds drifted smoothly; the sky was bright and the air clear, free from mist and clouds; the sun boys poured essence, the moon maidens scattered flowers; streams of light met on all sides, illuminating the heavens; harmonious sounds washed away filth; divine winds swept away dust; rivers and seas subsided; mountains swallowed smoke; dragon scales leapt; divine beings all rejoiced; birth and death were opened to prosperity; blessings and felicity were widespread; the five sufferings were released; the nine nether pardoned souls; the long captives were freed and ascended to heaven. Men and women rejoiced, long joy and gladness; the heavens acclaimed and celebrated, listening in reverence to the secret words.

Let future sages heed my words. Then all the great holy celestial youths, seven thousand two hundred and forty in number, at once praised the good. The flying heavenly spirits recited fully the ten good causes and conditions, the merit and retribution of deeds, the root of evil unbroken; the celestial youths rejoiced and made obeisance.

Returning to human realm, extreme foolishness, or born among barbarians, or afflicted with six diseases, linked and dragged, no escape for countless kalpas, brief life, long death, once losing the path of good, forever estranged from the domain of sages, in the long and dark night, when will deliverance come? Men and women of future birth, clearly exhort and encourage, establish great merits, to redeem and save themselves, holding the ten precepts, able to avoid this calamity, wisely heed my words, be cautious not to forget or lose them. Then all the great holy celestial true persons, seven thousand two hundred and forty youths, at once praised the good. The flying heavenly spirits recited fully the fourteen categories of evil deeds and their retribution, the unbroken roots of evil; the celestial youths rejoiced and made obeisance. Then the flying heavenly spirits composed this poem:

In life thoughts not good, cruelly attacking masters and treasures; dying enduring ten thousand pains and poisons, ten thousand kalpas losing the human path. Cruelly flattering good and loyal, slandering and striking worthy men. Born among barbarians, dying as beasts. Greedy and covetous, only desiring gain, not considering giving to all living beings. At death soul is hungry ghost, later born in beast form. Rich and noble oppressing the poor, separating kin and relatives. Body suffering rupture, souls shorn and shackled. Cursing innocent men, licentious rites, dancing with evil spirits. Drifting among the three paths, ten thousand kalpas born in base forms. Plotting rebellion and abusing lords and fathers, defiling and destroying heavenly truth. At death cast into boiling pot, suffering pain without return. Holding heart not single, despising heavenly treasures and scriptures. Destined to follow the sword tree, wind knives without pause. Not holding compassion, cruelly harming living beings. At death soul bearing iron pot, ten thousand kalpas wearing fiery mountain. Apostate to evil gods, reviling and abandoning true persons. At death form lacking clothing, iron staff not leaving body. Robbers stealing property, hacking and stabbing heavenly men. At death soul shorn and mutilated, in life punished and maimed. Moving in darkness into homes, acting as pleased. At death soul long confined, seeing no sun or moon. Accumulating deeds not considering kindness, hunting and capturing living beings. Iron staff repaying grudges, driving without rest. Fierce nature in words and tongue, fighting chaos without kinship. At death tongue pulled out in retribution, later born always barking at men. Fond of wine losing original nature, five spirits all unruly. At death drawn into dark waves, poured into four rivers.

Thus the flying heavenly spirits recited poems on good and evil causes and conditions and retribution to the celestial youths. Then all heaven and men were awakened, all saw the roots of fate, universally reflecting on past sins and origins, changing hearts and self-exhorting, cultivating and revering scriptures, past burdens removed, nine nether regions purified, all obtaining rebirth in good causes and conditions. The celestial youths reverently received the dharma sounds, rejoicing at once, made obeisance and departed.

## The Nine Nether Jade Casket: Sins, Blessings, Causes, Conditions, Retribution and Delivery, Highest Grade

The Supreme Tao Lord stepped forward, prostrated, and addressed the Celestial Worthy: 'Today attending Thy seat, I have seen the youths receiving majestic radiance, universally illuminating the heavens’ blessing halls and the boundless worlds of hell, good and evil retribution, pain and joy not the same. The good rejoice and are at peace, roaming free without end; the evil are in misery, drifting in eight hardships, no longer human in form, truly lamentable. Such retribution, bearing evil causes and conditions, endless through countless kalpas, not knowing the roots of fate, not discerning if merit exists, to redeem and open deliverance for dead souls, to lead them out from the long night and nine nether regions, entering the light, reborn in the gates of blessing—would this not be so? If granted compassion, bearing life and death’s grace, the departed at ease and joyful, seeing the world flourishing, wealth and prosperity burning bright, long life, then the clouds shade the eight directions, the wind scatters orchid forests; men and women of future birth hear the dharma sounds. I pray the Celestial Worthy will distinguish and explain, bestow secret words, so that all may see the clear precepts and rules, and all be at peace.'

The Celestial Worthy said to the Supreme Tao Lord: 'Hear my words attentively, think well and mark them in thy heart, morning and night remember, and do not let them be forgotten. Now I will explain the wondrous sounds to thee, so that thou mayest rely upon them, redeeming sinful souls, opening them out from the long night and nine nether regions, the eight hardships, past burdens removed, turning into roots of faith, life and death
