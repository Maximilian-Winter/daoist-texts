# The Supreme Cavernous Mysterious Spiritual Treasure True Scripture of Deliverance and Fundamental Practice (Dunhuang Edition)

The name of the Scripture: The Supreme Cavernous Mysterious Spiritual Treasure True Scripture of Deliverance and Fundamental Practice; abbreviated as the "Cavernous Fundamental Practice Scripture." The author is unknown; it was composed about the Eastern Jin dynasty. It is one of the ancient Scriptures of the Spiritual Treasure. The original is one scroll; it is not included in the Zhengtong Daozang. The base text source is the Dunhuang manuscript P.3022v, copy 1.

Thus begins the clear True Writ of the Spiritual Treasure. The Supreme Dao Lord, on the Western Na Heaven, Mount Fuluo of Mount Yucha, sat beneath the seven precious [wood], observing a long fast in the empty mountain, calmly meditating on the spirit and the true, harmonizing the celebration of the dark pivot, serene and natural, overseeing the myriad transformations, bending over and harmonizing all sentient beings. At that time, the great saints and most genuine honored spirits from the ten directions came to the seat, burning incense, bowing their heads before the Dao, and respectfully addressing the Dao Lord: "We do not examine whence the Spiritual Treasure's methods issued, from which kalpa they come, until this day; how many beings have been delivered to completion? Is there again a turning wheel? In what kalpa was the Heavenly Venerable born, encountering the True Writ, and obtaining the present Supreme Office? Therefore, in this deliverance, why is there such a lofty virtuous ancestor, exalted beyond measure? We beseech that you graciously bestow and reveal the causes and conditions of the fundamental practice, expound the essential words, and open the enlightenment of those born later."

The Dao Lord then played the Dragon Cloud Drum of Jing, the ethereal sound floating and resounding, flowing and rushing a thousand fathoms; the heavens surged, the purple canopy revolved; celebration in the four meetings of the sky; the eight ways shining bright; the two lights shining together; the nine breaths clear and pure; scattering fragrant flowers; penetrating and watering without end; divine dragons with music and dance; fifty million multitudes; splendid and luminous; piercing the ten heavens; rivers and seas calm with waves; mountains and hills veiled in smoke; myriad sounds silent; the heavenly origin displayed and arranged; fullness and spaciousness unfolded; myriad captives rejoiced therein.

Then the Dao spoke: "The heavenly origin’s turning wheel, kalpa by kalpa changes the operation; one success and one failure, one death and one life; extinction yet not cessation, obscurity yet again brightness; the Spiritual Treasure issues methods, delivering men according to the world. From the beginning when the primal origin opened the light, until the first year of the Red Bright, in nine hundred ninety-nine billion kalpas, beings have been delivered like grains of dust and sand, incomparable in number. Before the Red Bright, in the vast obscurity, kalpa by kalpa transformations issued, inconceivable. After Red Bright, until the first year of the Supreme Emperor, the orthodox great methods appeared; many were delivered; throughout the heavens it is spoken of, and will not be exhausted. Now, to make roughly clear the true and correct framework and standard, this is but to mark the distant traces of those who have attained the Dao. Now I briefly instruct those who come later, leading them to comprehend the marvel of the spiritual writ.

I wash in the flow of the purple dawn’s fragrance, being the progeny of the august sovereign. I follow the kalpa’s death and life, generation after generation unbroken, constantly encountering the Spiritual Treasure and issuing methods; in seven hundred billion kalpas. At the ending of the Blue Emperor kalpa, when the nine breaths changed the operation, then I was entrusted to be born within the womb of the Hong family, concentrating spirit in the palace of the jade womb, accumulating three thousand seven hundred years. At the opening of the Red Bright operation, in the year of Jiazi, I was born on Mount Fuluo of the Western Na Jade Kingdom, again issuing methods together with the Spiritual Treasure for the deliverance of men. The Primal Origin Heavenly Venerable, in recognition of my merits and causes, bestowed upon me the title of Supreme, sealed me as the Jade Emperor King of the Yuyue Forest of Yuna, and my rank ascended to the High Sage, governing the mysterious capital of the Jade City. Indeed, it is by my noble person that the great method of the Spiritual Treasure True Writ is upheld, generation after generation without ceasing, widely delivering heaven and men, compassionately caring for all things, universally aiding all sentient beings. The merit and virtue are great, the achievements and fame recorded through countless kalpas, resulting in present-day reward, and I am venerated among the heavens.

The Dao said: The Eastern Precious Treasure Blossom Forest Green Spirit First Old Emperor Lord dwells in White Illumination, ruling during the golden kalpa. Temporarily born in the Yuyue Golden Shining Cloud Heaven Forest of Na, in the Western Lou Boundless Jade Kingdom on the Vast Bright Mysterious Mountain, named Yuanqing. In this heaven, he greatly built up merit and virtue, cutting his body and giving it away, supporting the Daoists without laxity at first; his merit and name reached upward; the Vermilion Mound Fire Palace wrote down his name, recorded in the Red Canon; the immortal Dao was nearly completed. Yet he met a many-colored woman of the kingdom, of surpassing and easy beauty. Yuanqing then indulged in worldly dispersions and scattered thoughts, opening the door to love and desire. The spiritual demons raised their turbid eyes; the vermilion palace struck out his immortal name; although he did not return to the earthly officials, he was extinguished here, gradually retreating through three kalpas. At the change of the Fire Kalpa operation, Yuanqing again accepted illumination and was entrusted with a fetal body within the womb of the Hong family. Heaven, seeing his former life’s fondness for lust, transformed him into a woman to fulfill his past desire for sensuality. In the first year of Vermilion Mound, in the year of Bingwu, he was born in the Dan Child Dragon Luo Guard Heaven Cave Bright Jade Kingdom Zhu Huo’s Abyss, changed surname to Hong, named Natai. At fourteen years old, his appearance was surpassing and brilliant, beloved by heavenly beings; at that time no kingdom did not incline its heart towards him. Natai held his heart firm, maintaining chastity and steadfastness, and never gazed upon evil. Respectfully fond of the Dao and its methods, his heart wished for the immortals; constantly offering incense and ointments, lamps shining in the dark; treasures scattered in offerings to Daoists; wishing for the kingdom’s peace, the land’s abundance, the people’s prosperity, and the eternal existence of the whole heaven. He greatly performed merit and virtue, praised by the heavens and marked in the Supreme Clarity. The Northern Pole Supreme Spirit Purple Void Primordial Lord, taking on a humble form, descended to teach in the world, met Natai’s chastity, esteemed the utmost law, returned his carriage to the Dan Platform’s Abyss, and presented Natai with the "Spiritual Treasure Red Scripture Southern Direction True Writ."

Thus Natai strove with great diligence, claiming himself to have been born a woman for this life, dwelling in a secluded chamber, unable to attain the Dao. Hence he maintained long fasts and precepts, thinking and wishing to transform his body into a man. Morning and evening he was fearful and earnest, never weary or careless. His true heart reached far and deep, thereby effecting spiritual communication with the Supreme Truth descending.

At that time, the Primal Origin Heavenly Venerable sat at the Langbi Creek, at the Fuyao Hill beneath the withered mulberry tree of the long forest, with many spirits attending the seat, distributing and examining the "Warehouse Original Treasure Register Spiritual Treasure True Writ." The heavens sprinkled fragrant flowers, music and dance flowed with the water of the refined moon, numberless varieties without limit, brightness penetrating, illuminating the ten directions. On that day, Natai was performing the incense ceremony indoors and making his wish when he saw a five-coloured purple light bending and shining upon the fasting hall. Then his heart was enlightened, doubting it was impermanent. He then went out and climbed the wall to look westward, far seeing under the eastern mulberry forest a radiance splendid beyond measure, impossible to name. Between Natai’s residence and that place were several hundred li, separated by the Min Shungu and the mouth of the vast sea; his heart leapt with joy but he could not reach it. From afar he wished to pay respects to the Heavenly Venerable, and, crossing the hands [gesture], respectfully saluted, calling his name "Natai," saying: "Former causes were insufficient, causing me to be born a woman; my vow is to delight and aspire to immortality; the Dao high and the method wondrous, not to be grasped, day and night I think, hoping to attain deliverance, to transform into a man. Many years have passed without effect; I always fear birth and death, unable to accomplish perfect longevity."

At this present day the heavenly river obstructs, making it impossible to reveal fully. Now I will cast my body into the blue sea, lose my life in heaven, hoping my form and soul may quickly turn the wheel, again build merit and virtue through countless kalpas, hoping to see the true Dao. When these words were finished, he then threw himself from the wall into the void, his fate proceeding to the depths of the vast sea’s abyss. Swiftly and without falling, he was received by the Water Emperor Divine King, carried by the five-coloured flying dragons; in an instant the female body was transformed in midair into a male form, mounting a dragon and riding the void, flying to the Dao before him. Then the Primal Origin immediately commanded the Immortal Capital to confer the imperial title, to be in charge during the Fire Kalpa, assisting the Spiritual Treasure Azure Emperor’s Jade Chapter. For seven hundred years, through the many extremities of the Fire Kalpa, the blue breath circulated, following the origin to extinction and deliverance. In the first year of opening the light at the Mifanluo Platform, among the cloud heights and desolate hills, the root of flying clouds’ capital, the Cangxia nine clouds’ ruin, the Primal Origin again bestowed the title Anbao Huolin Qingling Shilao Emperor Lord.

The Dao said: The Southern Brahman Treasure Prosperous Yang Dan Spirit True Old Lord, originally surnamed Zheng, styled Ren’an, is a descendant of the Great Flame, born in the Chanli World Red Bright Heaven. At birth, three breaths of cloud surrounded his body; the Vermilion Bird Drum and Eagle covered his form. At three days old he could speak, already knowing his past fate. At twenty years old, his face was golden and jade-like; he abandoned the world and the mundane, wandering far in mountains and forests. In the cold forest cave palace he met Master Xuanhe, who gave Ren’an the "Spiritual Treasure Red Scripture Five Qi Mysterious Heaven Black Emperor True Writ," a supreme wisdom and ten precepts, then departed. Ren’an thereafter upheld the precepts and fasts, greatly building merit and virtue, distributing treasures, delivering from punishment, cutting his mouth to feed birds with honey, his merit and fame reaching heaven. Then in the Western Na kingdom there was a great flood disaster, waters overflowing the heavens, ten thousand families adrift. Ren’an floated in a boat over the vast waters, reciting precepts, writing the Black Emperor True Writ to cast into the water; the water opened a path a hundred qing in breadth; birds and beasts, deer, tiger, leopard, lion, all sought refuge with him, all were unharmed. At that time the king and a hundred of his people climbed a tower but were drowned, lamenting that they could not be delivered. Ren’an saw the king sinking, thus floated the boat to him and gave the king the true writ he had worn. The king respectfully accepted it, the water disaster immediately retreated, and all passed over safely. After the king was saved, the true writ flew away into the clouds, its location unknown. Ren’an lost the true writ, withdrew one rank among the immortals, his fate approached extinction and deliverance. He entrusted his fate and ended, dying in the north Rong’s Abyss, his spirit body exposed for more than thirty years, his form not decayed, his light bright, no different from when alive, residing beneath the long forest of the north Rong. At that time the king went hunting, set fire to the mountain, fire encircled on all sides, within a hundred steps of the spirit body the fire would not burn; deer, tiger, leopard all sought refuge. The king was amazed and went to see the spirit body; above it was three-coloured light, clouds and mist dense and dark, birds and beasts gathered around. The king then cut wood to circle the body and set fire to burn it. At that time the body released fire, rose in a human form, sat upon blue smoke, pointed to and plucked at the void, five colours blazing. Three hundred attendants, immortal children, jade girls and boys, solemnly arrived. All birds and beasts that sought refuge were within the fire, all attained deliverance. Ren’an, in the second year of the Red Bright, in the year of Bingwu, was born in Gamatanlou in Yitian’s cave of the desolate Mount Lingliao, changed surname to Dongfu, named Riji Yan, and was bestowed the Southern Single Brahman Treasure Prosperous Yang Dan Spirit True Old Emperor Lord title, the Dan Spirit Old Lord.

The Dao said: The Central Heaven Jade Treasure Primordial Spirit Primordial Old Lord, originally surnamed Kun, styled Xinran, is a scion of the Dongyuan and a descendant of Zhonghe, born in the Good-Endurance World Blue Primordial Heaven, in the Flowing Birth Hill. He was born into one kalpa, silent and without speech, chaotic and without mind, feeding on breath as nourishment. Heaven and earth were not yet illuminated; the Impermanent Child was in the colourless country, who gave Xinran the "Spiritual Treasure Red Scripture Red Emperor True Writ," and thus he spoke. At that time he cultivated only himself, at first not expanding, widely delivering heaven and men, his good works not complete, his fate approaching extinction. In the Blue Primordial Heaven, at the end of his life in the Flowing Birth State, beneath the Hill of Absolute, he lived over one hundred years, died without decay, always covered by yellow breath. At the spread of the Water Kalpa, the world was vast and dark, spiritual remains surged with earth to the sky, blocking clouds and waterways. Xinran responded to transformation, rising sorrowfully, reborn into human form, changing surname to Tongban, named Yuan. After the water passed, heaven and earth opened the light, three images mysterious and bright, seven primordials illustrious. The Primal Origin Heavenly Venerable, in the second year of the opening light, in the year of Jichou, at the High Peach, Dragon Luo Heaven, Reversed Soul Forest, bestowed on Yuan the Jade Treasure Primordial Spirit Primordial Old Lord title.

The Dao said: The Western Seven Treasures Golden Gate Bright Spirit Supreme Old Lord was originally the son of the Spiritual Phoenix. The Spiritual Phoenix descended in the Heluo Heaven, born in the Weiluotian Paradise World; the king of Weiluo took it and kept it. The king had six daughters, the eldest named Peiying, greatly affectionate and loving, often playing with it. Thus the Spiritual Phoenix often fanned the girl’s face with its two wings; after twelve years, the girl suddenly became pregnant, the pregnancy lasting three months. The king was puzzled, so cut off the phoenix’s head and buried it in the Longlin Hill. The girl afterwards bore a daughter, who fell to the ground and could speak, saying: "I am the phoenix’s child, my position should be Heavenly Consort." The king immediately named her Huangfei (Imperial Consort). At three days old, a flock of phoenixes came to congratulate, with mysterious nourishment of jade frost, great springs and winding waters, and eight refined zhi herbs. At eight years old she held her heart in solemn conduct, transcending worldly norms. Every morning she paid homage to the sun, every evening saluted the moon; within the heavy palace the king set up a kitchen, but the food had no taste for her. Heaven caused great snow to fall for a year without ceasing, snow ten zhang deep, birds and beasts starved to death. The king’s daughter thought of the Spiritual Phoenix, went to visit and play, riding to Longlin Hill, singing: "Far away is the Spiritual Phoenix, endlessly returning home, my thoughts are long and deep, forever opposing my wishes, countless kalpas without end, when will you come flying?"

Then the phoenix killed by the king was revived, flying with the girl, directly into the clouds. The king’s daughter now above the splendid sky received the scripture as the Southern Pole Supreme Primordial Lord, always riding the nine-coloured phoenix. This daughter in former kalpas had already served the Spiritual Treasure, causing the Spiritual Phoenix to descend in form, and she was conferred the title of Southern Pole Primordial Lord. Huangfei’s merit and virtue reached afar, the heavenly truth responded and descended. In the first year of the Supreme Primordial, in the year of Gengshen, on the seventh day of the seventh month at mid-day, the Primal Origin Heavenly Venerable assembled at Weiluo Jade Kingdom on Phoenix Unicorn Hill, seated beneath Jianhua, with many spirits attending. At that time, within Huangfei’s room, suddenly there was a solar phenomenon, like a round mirror, suspended empty before her eyes. Huangfei reflected and saw the heavenly truth great gods, universally present in the mirror beneath the long forest, the room brightly illuminated. Then she ascended Tongyang Platform, looked westward, seeing the Phoenix Birth Hill, purple clouds flourishing, divine light splendid, beyond naming. About five hundred steps from Huangfei’s residence, pressed by the female root place inside the palace, she could not reach it. Suddenly a divine phoenix came flying, gathered on the platform. Huangfei asked the phoenix, "In the west is the Dao; my heart wishes but has no cause; I wonder whether the divine phoenix may briefly ride and bring me there?" The phoenix then spread its wings, seated her on its back, and directly brought her before the Dao. The Primal Origin Heavenly Venerable pointed to the Golden Platform Queen Mother, saying, "She is your teacher; you may pay respects." Huangfei prostrated and reported: "Only hoping the many honored ones will graciously pity, so that this dried corpse may be reborn." When finished, the Golden Mother conferred on her the title Western Spirit Jade Consort, commanding nine light spirit children to don frost gauze robes and bring forth the "Spiritual Treasure Red Scripture White Emperor True Writ" as a single chapter, giving it to Huangfei. After receiving the title for three hundred years, again encountering the blue kalpa change of operation, Huangfei was entrusted with a fetal body in the Li family womb for three years, born beneath the Li trees of the Golden Mound Secluded Valley in Western Na Jade Kingdom, transformed into a male body, changed surname to Shangjin, named Richang. At the first year of opening light, in the year of Shangjia, the Primal Origin Heavenly Venerable bestowed upon him the Western Seven Treasures Golden Gate Bright Spirit Supreme Old Lord title.

The Dao said: The Northern Cavern Yin Shuo Dan Yu Absolute Five Spirits Mysterious Old Lord, originally surnamed Hao, styled Fuming. He is a descendant of the Mysterious Emperor and scion of the Great Clarity, born in the Yuanfu Abandoned Worthy World First Blue Heaven. At twelve years old, he was fond of solitude, delighted in mountains and waters, far from home, sometimes gone ten days, sometimes returning once. At that time, the world suffered famine and disaster, people starving to death, a kingdom nearly perished. Fuming, beneath the earth boundary mountain, encountered a vast field, gathering by himself and giving to the poor and destitute, daily obtaining several times, saving and delivering thousands at the point of death. Taking and giving, for three years without ceasing; others sought him but none knew his place. At that time, worn and thin, no leisure for his body, aiding the people, thus exhausted, died beneath the mountain. The nine heavens recorded his merit and virtue, inscribed his jade name in gold tablets, delivered his soul and spirit to the Vermilion Mound Palace. Later the Emperor sent a golden-winged great bird, always spreading its two wings to cover his corpse; for seven hundred years his body did not decay. At the change of the Water Kalpa operation, the flood was overwhelming, water floated his body, drifting to the Abyss of the Boundless. After the water passed, Fuming’s corpse fell to Bei Zhou Yaqu, the beginning silent heaven of the Northern Ridge Mysterious Hill. For forty years, also a mountain fire raged, burning the corpse; in the fire he was tempered and rose, transformed into a true man, covered by five-coloured clouds. The fire still fierce, Fuming coughed and spat, producing a great flood of rain water to extinguish the fire’s strength. Though Fuming had attained the Dao, having undergone both water and fire hardships, he had completed his tasks. At the first year of opening light, at the Northern Ridge Mysterious Hill, he changed surname to Heijie, named Linghui. The Primal Origin Heavenly King bestowed on Linghui the Cavern Yin Shuo Dan Yu Absolute Five Spirits Mysterious Old Lord title.

The Dao said: Formerly in the Chanli World, the king of the team had a daughter, styled Jingyin, who was born mute. At fourteen years old, the king was puzzled and abandoned the girl in the southern floating long mulberry’s abyss of the empty mountain. The girl lacked food, often looking up at the sun swallowing breath, drawing in the moon taking essence, naturally full and not fatigued, often roaming the mountains, circling among caves and rocks. Suddenly she met a divine person beneath the cypress grove of Danling’s dwelling, who held Jingyin’s right hand, inscribed on a red stone, speaking to Jingyin: "Though you cannot speak, you may remember this." Jingyin privately mourned: born with misfortune, unable to speak, abandoned in the poor mountain, vowed to return to the human world, to accomplish merit and virtue, without attachment or fondness, after a hundred kalpas hoping to meet her vow. Heaven, moved by her, sent twenty-four jade girls of the Vermilion Palace to descend and teach Jingyin the art of governing the body, giving her the eight characters of the Red Scripture; Jingyin then was able to speak. Morning and evening she saluted the heavenly pattern; the Dao truth having descended, she reversed knowledge of auspicious and inauspicious, commanding a hundred spirits, seated in order in the ten directions, emerging on the mountain and returning to the king’s kingdom. At that time the world suffered great drought, people smoked and burned; the king greatly feared and prayed to the gods. Jingyin went to report to the king: "It is often heard that in the mountains there is a girl who cannot speak, but is moved by heaven; does the king know of her?" The king then realized it was his daughter, and welcomed her back to the palace, seeing she could speak, the king was ashamed. The girl revealed her Dao, howled upward for the king, heaven sent a great flood, pouring water ten zhang deep. Then she transformed and hid her form, departing; again she was entrusted with a shape in the Li family womb, fate not yet turned, again born a female body. The father styled her Fuqing, named Aqiuhui. At the age of maturity, she opened great compassion, distributed to the poor and destitute, slept alone in one place, not mingling with objects; yet lamps burned incense, long fasting in a secluded chamber, her red sincerity accumulating response, the Dao descended for her.

In the first year of opening light, the great saints and honored spirits of the ten directions, the wondrous conduct true men, assembled in the southern garden Danhuo’s abyss, Three Primordial Cave Chamber, Qinghua Forest; many spirits attended, five thousand fragrant flowers and musicians, the true writ shining bright, brightness penetrating inside and outside, clouds and scenery blazing like moon among the stars, about tens of li from Aqiuhui’s former residence. At the time Aqiuhui was sixteen years old, seeing the dwelling bright and shining inside and out, doubting it was impermanent, then went out facing south, saw the Dao truth. Aqiuhui rejoiced, joined hands in salutation, called his name from afar saying: "Aqiuhui now encounters a happy meeting, seeing the Heavenly Venerable in person, an unmerited joy, not knowing how to express it, I return my life to the heavens in the ten directions." Only by the mysterious mirror was he granted admonitions, ten thousand kalpas for extinction and deliverance, winged to fly among immortals. The demon seeing Aqiuhui made a great vow, his strength surpassing the demon realm, thus transformed into the Five Emperor Old Lord, going to inform Aqiuhui, saying: "I have received the mission of the honored spirits of the ten directions, coming to tell you: the Spiritual Treasure Dharma flourishes, the five ways are all proceeding; each wishes to cause men to be benevolent, loving, compassionate, filial, respectfully serving superiors, honoring parents. Hearing your father about to betroth you, your person having already been promised, receiving another’s words, the command of father and mother cannot be disobeyed; you should first comply with it. When human ways are complete, then you may cast off your body. To disobey the father’s teaching, immortality cannot be attained."

The girl answered the demon’s words: "In my former life, I was unfortunate, previously without cause or connection, my merit was not complete, resulting in my female body; morning and evening I strive, vowing one heart, my intent firm, responding to nature. Born of father and mother, my fate belongs to the ten heavens; truly to disobey the father’s teaching is less than your words." The demon saw Aqiuhui’s firm heart, and then withdrew. Aqiuhui said to himself: "The Dao is high and remote, no cause for release." He then gathered firewood and set fire, burning his form, hoping his body and bones might become flying dust, borne by the wind to reach the Dao. Thus the fire blazed, Aqiuhui threw himself in, swiftly without falling, his body as if treading the void. In a moment he was seen to transform into a male, standing before the Dao. The Primal Origin Heavenly Venerable appointed the Southern Pole Honored Spirit as Aqiuhui’s teacher, conferring on him the Ten Precepts Spiritual Treasure True Writ. The Primal Origin Heavenly Venerable further said to the Southern Pole Honored Spirit: "Aqiuhui in former kalpas had long served the Spiritual Treasure, his merit incomplete, thus entrusted to be born in the turning wheel, until this day born among men, seeing my issuing of the method, he immediately attained transformation; he shall further deliver ninety-nine thousand nine hundred men and become the Supreme True Great God, the Cavernous Yang Red Bright Heaven Emperor."

The Southern Pole Honored Spirit, originally surnamed Huang, styled Duming, was the daughter of King Wan of Yanfuli Kingdom. Born in the Chanli World Red Bright Heaven, born into wealth and honor, her father was king. The girl dwelt in the palace, golden bed and jade couch, seven-coloured precious canopy, twin bright moons, shining inside and out; the king gave her thousands of courtesans; the kingdom’s treasures were not lacking in anything. She often wished to scatter and greatly build merit and virtue; her will was extreme for mountains and waters, seeking the immortals; trapped and constrained in the palace, unable to find a path, her will and conduct unhappy, her heart sorrowful and troubled. The king pitied and comforted her with many words, asking her intention; the girl never spoke, tears fell like rain, utterly without joy. The king added courtesans and music daily to sing. Duming, hearing the music, was as if not hearing, alone in a quiet place burning incense, fasting and upholding precepts, eating once at midday. The king knew her mind, and in the palace made an earthen mountain, a hundred zhang high, planted with bamboo forest, on the mountain made a platform named Seeking Truth Jade Platform. Duming abandoned the palace, ascended the platform to dwell, blocking and barring the Dao path, no one could pass, alone she stayed for twelve years. Accumulating merit, the Emperor of the Vast Heaven sent twenty-four jade girls of the Vermilion Palace to descend riding clouds and phoenixes to welcome Duming. On the eve of her departure, heaven rose great wind and rain, thunder and lightning flashed, the earth and house spun, frightening a kingdom. The king was greatly shaken and fearful, not knowing what to do. At dawn the light parted, the mountain platform was lost, and the girl was not seen. The Heavenly Emperor received Duming on the Yangqiu Mountain Danling’s upper dwelling forest, with vermilion phoenix guards, divine dragons winged and swift, jade boys and girls numbering over three hundred. After the great kalpa changes, heaven and earth exchanged place, Duming was supposed to fall and be abandoned, but ascending south responded to her red elixir, the Vermilion Palace recorded her purple name, transformed her form and bones into the primordial womb, born in one kalpa, attained male body. In the Southern Dan Cavern Yang Upper Hall Pearl Seven-Coloured Precious Forest, the Red Emperor Brahman Treasure Prosperous Yang Dan Spirit True Old Lord bestowed upon Duming the Southern Pole Supreme True title.
