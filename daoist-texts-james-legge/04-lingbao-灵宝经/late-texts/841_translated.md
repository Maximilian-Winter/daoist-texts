# The Scripture of the Original Practice and Conditions of the Supreme Cavernous Mysterious and Spiritual Treasure

In the third year of Wu Chiwu, the year of Geng-shen, on the first day of the first month, at the hour of Renzi, the Immortal Lord ascended Mount Laoshen, and in quiet meditation contemplated the Way. At midday of that day, there came thirty-three earth-immortals and Daoist men, who approached the seat, burned incense, and reverently circumambulated the Scripture. When this was finished, the Immortal Lord bade them sit. After a while, a Daoist withdrew from his place and asked: "We, your humble servants, have studied the Way for a very long time, six hundred Jia-zi cycles accumulated till now; and early have we been conferred the title of Supreme Pole Left Immortal Lord, ascended to the Jade Capital, entered the Golden Palace, and paid homage to the Most High Heavenly Sovereign. Yet we do not clearly comprehend by what ancient causes and what merits we have received the heavenly office and attained this lofty dignity, so that the Three Realms’ Northern Feng revere us. We wish to have enlightenment concerning the root and origin of our former destinies and conditions."

The Immortal Lord said: "That which you inquire is distant and subtle indeed. Sit again, I will tell you. The One Breath arises from Emptiness and Non-being; the Two Forms divide from the One Breath: the pure is Heaven, the turbid is Earth; Man receives the central Breath and is born, and with Heaven and Earth constitutes the Three Powers. At first there was no difference between the mundane and the holy, no distinction of long or short life; all was confused and dark, no cultivation was required, and the Way took its place by itself. But when confusion was broken through, and great simplicity was dispersed, human affairs became entangled and the Way was far removed. Your generation in former lives studied the Way and received Scriptures, and did small good works, desiring only to save themselves, thinking not of saving others; sought only their own attainment of the Way, without thought of others obtaining the Way; disbelieved the grand and far-reaching words of the great Scriptures; neglected fasting and abstinence; did not honour the Three Caverns’ Masters; delighted in the Lesser Vehicle. Therefore they attained the Way of Earth Immortals, but only so far as to surpass and roam the Three Realms and the ten directions, looking up to the Supreme Jade Capital and the Golden Palace. If you wish your Dharma Wheel to speedily ascend and fly to the Upper Purity Heavens, you must further establish merit, save the lands and peoples from calamities, diseases, and sufferings; when your great works and great merits are full, then the Supreme One will confer upon you His reception. Therefore Peng Zu lived eight hundred years, An Qi one thousand years, Bai Shi three thousand years; hence they roamed among the common folk, because in their former lives their study of the Way was of small merit and thin accomplishment. And some yet remain for more than ten thousand years in mountain caverns, still not ascending to Heaven. You who number only several hundred years, what is there to be called long? Immortals secret themselves in mountains and forests, practising hidden virtue and ascending; and those who shed their corpses and entrust their forms often manifest signs in the world, yet those honoured in the country and recorded in name, books, and Scriptures are few indeed."

At that time there was an Immortal surnamed Ji, styled Facheng; the Immortal Lord looked upon him and said: "He is indeed my disciple from a former life, but he has not yet seen the root of former destiny; I can cause you to see the affairs of your past lives." Facheng said: "Yes, yes, Heavenly Venerable." In a moment he became enlightened, crossed hands and made reverence: "Your servant is dark and blocked, not knowing my original practice; I beg for your mercy."

The Immortal Lord said: "In the days of Emperor Yao, you followed me into Mount Songgao to study; your ambition was small and your hope quick. You often perceived my emptiness and exaggeration, the remote hopes, and difficult paths; you laughed at Xu You and Chao Fu for their refusal on Mount Ji to accept Yao’s abdication, and their regret in dealings with She. You were not content. You often urged Facheng to study the Way of Upper Purity, but he did not follow. Though drinking the sea, he could not fill his belly; he knocked on stone but did not find jade. Xu and She early ascended the Supreme Pole Palace; now I have just taken the office of Left Immortal Lord; you remain but an Earth Immortal, not dying yet; how near is your virtue to that? Are you not distressed? Now you perceive that my words have proof, and you believe without deceit." Facheng rejoiced, remembered this not long ago, and his heart was clear; formerly not following instructions, this was hard to obtain; now he wished to be saved and liberated, to attend the cloud chariot and hold the reins, to face the Heavenly Countenance in person; thus he said: "This is the meeting of past destinies."

The Immortal Lord said: "You are lofty and eminent, ready to ascend Heaven; but how can you follow me to the Supreme Pole Palace, to attend the Most High Jade Capital and Golden Palace? I have nothing to regret."

The Immortal again asked the Immortal Lord: "Concerning the former life’s original practice, is it completed? If not yet finished, please instruct."

The Immortal Lord said: "My former lives have undergone experience and practice, sin and wealth, revolving transformations of forms, speaking of Heaven; yet it is also not to be completed. If you desire to know, I shall briefly mention one corner. Formerly I was born a noble, yet overrode the poor and lowly, supported the strong and oppressed the weak; died and entered Hell. Afterwards born a petty man, poor, humble, diseased, solitary and forlorn; then arose the thought: 'What was my former destiny, that I now suffer thus?' What was that former destiny’s virtue that it enjoys wealth and honour? I thought to do good, yet my heart did not unravel, anxieties deep and hard to express; died and ascended to the blessed hall. Afterwards born rich, with treasures sufficient, lacking nothing; yet cruel to slaves and servants; died and entered Hell in vain. The three officers’ sins completed, afterwards born in a low chamber, observing men’s breath, serving diligently; when moved, was beaten with whips; labouring in misery, trampled without exception. Then arose the thought: 'What guilt of former lives caused me to be this low servant?' And with private possessions supplied the poor, revered Daoists, offered incense and oil, only wishing to be born in a noble family, to die and ascend to the blessed hall, with food and clothing natural. Afterwards born a noble, yet again killed many living beings, made hunting and fishing a matter; died and entered Hell, passed through mountains of blades and trees of swords, boiled and swallowed fire; the five sufferings complete. The sins brought in the next birth as swine and sheep, to repay former grudges. Afterwards receiving form as a lowly man, foul and loathsome beyond measure, cheating and taking others’ wealth without return; died and entered Hell. Born as an ox, to repay men by labour and to be eaten by men as meat. Afterwards receiving form as a middle man, treasures near at hand; at that time arose thoughts of merit, constantly supported Daoists, received Scriptures and precepts, humble and lowly, gave alms to the distressed, in every matter followed the Way, hearing good sought to follow it; at eighty years died and immediately ascended to the blessed dwelling, with food and clothing from Heaven’s kitchen. Afterwards born in a noble family, cultivated fondness for martial valour, made war and slaughter a matter; yet all the while respected and obeyed Daoists, believed in orthodox Law; died and entered Hell, undergoing testing and torment. At that time the Supreme One gave instruction: this man though guilty of killing and slaughter, having entered Hell, yet in life believed the Law, respected the Way, gave alms to the distressed; now pardoning his penalties, he can be allowed to ascend the blessed hall and be supplied with Heaven’s kitchen. Afterwards born noble, faced approaching enemies, then arose the vow and thought of the Way, reverently received Scriptures and teachings, practised hidden virtue, rescued the imperilled, governed affairs by the Way, showed compassion to beings, supported Daoists, served the ruler with loyalty and ministers with propriety, constantly thought to renounce honour and abandon emolument; thus escaped enemies, died and ascended to Heaven’s hall. Born again a noble, most reverent and sincere; when young, arose thought to burn incense, wishing that my future lives be wise and clear, deeply understand subtle teachings, and at death ascend the blessed hall. Afterwards born in a middling scholarly family, became a Daoist, wore ritual robes and walked the Way; at times expounded the scriptures with intelligence, moved to be Master among many, patrons revered him; then arose the thought: 'This one life cannot attain the Way, better to be a woman, quiet and without affairs, to attain leisure and ease.' At death was born a woman, with fair countenance, brilliant talent, fluent speech; then arose thought to be a man, with great ability, thorough in mystery, penetrating Emptiness, understanding rare subtleties, wishing to be a king, to associate with Daoists, to roam mountains and waters, enjoy music and women, often hold scripture lectures; at death ascended Heaven’s hall, with natural food and clothing. Afterwards born in the king’s family as prince, leisurely preparing to inherit the throne, supporting the kingly estate, delighting in inviting Daoists, worthies, and scholars to observe rites and lecture on the Way, cultivating fasting and stillness, indulging in what he desired, country secure and people plentiful, solemn and without disturbance. At that time three attendant ministers made the same vow: 'In the next life I will be a Daoist, I a recluse, Shi Dao Wei and Zhu Fa Lan will become monks, Zheng Siyuan and Zhang Tai will be Daoists, Pu Zhi will ascend to immortality and save the world, renouncing royal affairs, dying and ascending Heaven’s hall, with food and clothing from Heaven’s kitchen.' In our next lives we shall be recluse, monk, and Daoists, all entering to study the Way and seek immortality. I shall be teacher to many, with great resolve to the Great Vehicle, practicing constant fasting and reading scriptures, bringing treasures to the great Masters, receiving the Three Caverns’ great Scriptures, offering support and homage, fasting, precepts, and practising the Way, taking medicines and breathing exercises. Because conditions are not yet fulfilled, after death passed to the Great Yin, born of a worthy family, again became Daoist and monk, again received fellow students, mutually teacher and disciple, again received the great Scriptures, fasted, and practiced the Way. Therefore the supreme sage opened his eyes and discerned, true teachings descended upon me. At that time Lan Wei and Zhang Zheng attended the seat; today they accompany me, this is the cause of the wishes of past lives. All Immortals without exception were clear; the four seats consulted and said: 'Heavenly Venerable Supreme One, having sought the Way for long, through many kalpas and cycles, has therefore obtained the position of Immortal Lord; surely there is reason in this. We have now fully seen the thin merit of past deeds, the little Scriptures received; how can we demand high immortality? Hereafter we should think to receive the great Cavern Scriptures, yearn for the Way and diligently practise, with compassion save those distressed and straitened, hoping for the Way of ascent to Heaven.'"

The Immortal Lord said: "You do not honour the Superior Way Cavern Scriptures, the manifold and primal principles; each of you should think diligently, make great merit, and rescue all suffering and distress. With such resolve, why should you fear not swiftly ascending Heaven? Only if you desire to immediately ascend the Supreme One’s palace, still there will be no appointed day."

The Immortal Lord said: "I have trodden everywhere, not recorded in brush and paper; diligent hardship hard to speak of; now I begin to receive the reward."

The Immortal asked: "Formerly with the Venerable One we entered Dongting, saw the King of Heaven’s separate palace, as if ascending Mount Bao; at that time we saw a company of Immortals seeking to follow the Venerable One to see a spectacle; what sort of Immortals were they? So many of them." The answer was: "Those Immortals are all Immortals of the famed mountains and cavern platforms; their numbers are not many; you have not seen Kunlun, Penglai, Zhongshan, Songshan, Xumi, the human-bird great mountain caverns; there are countless Immortals."

The Immortal said: "I do not know what Dongting connects to." The answer was: "It connects to all these great heavenly mountains and vast seas, the Northern Feng, Mount Dai Zong, the Five Sacred Mountains; there is nothing it does not connect to. Five Immortals said they were returning to Jiqu Mountain; is that the Venerable One’s native place?" The answer was: "Jiqu Mountain is what I see with my eyes, also a fine mountain of Jiangzuo; it is the western gate of the Nine Springs Dongting; below the cavern platform is forty li square; the palace chambers shine like the sun; there are thirty-six small heavens in number. It does not receive impure Qi; Daoists can properly dwell and shelter there. Often there are sages; formerly Master Mao attained the Way, now dwells there in the mountain cavern palace on the mountain’s summit, called the Empty Cavern, where the Mysterious Palace Temple is established, housing Immortals."

The Immortal asked: "Recently I ascended Kunlun’s Mysterious Garden Palace to attend the seat, saw the Perfect One of Zhengyi, the Three-Heaven Master Zhang Daoling descend to the seat; Fengdu awaited and welcomed him; the Three Realms bowed their heads; the Heavens saluted, asked, moved, and were still; the dragon chariot shone in the void, its peak bore round radiance, its body born with heavenly light, its words brilliant and splendid; what merit of former lives caused this attainment? Is he alone thus? I wish to hear." The answer was: "The Heavenly Master’s original practice also passed through many kalpas of diligent hardship, fasting and reading Scriptures, spreading the Way and great forbearance, high model of mystery and truth, delighting in rare subtleties, turning the wheel seeking the Way; especially surpassing me, it cannot be fully told. His aim is the great Scriptures, his practice the great Way; therefore he obtained the office of Three-Heaven Master, and the title of Supreme Perfect One of Zhengyi; is this not great?" At that time the East Flower Blue Youth, and all Immortals, gathered in the Songgao cavern, quietly fasting and chanting Scriptures. Those who study heard the Immortal Lord speak of the original practice; none did not yearn for the great Dharma, to strengthen and encourage themselves.

The Blue Youth said: "The Immortal Lord’s wondrous words are remote and profound; the matter is trustworthy and worthy of reverence." All the Immortals made reverence and said: "We do serve these words." The Blue Youth said: "I formerly wrote to you, receiving reply and care, and have never for a moment forgotten it; now you have received the Supreme One’s conferment; I should first cultivate respect and affection, not immediately manifest certain things, often turning and tossing, wishing not to fail this heart." The Immortal Lord said: "Formerly I received your letter, your care and favour was more than enough; deeply I feel shame, and more wait in emptiness; how can my feelings cease? Not for lack of little things, my virtue is unworthy of the supreme sages’ manifest proof, the letter’s mandate is resplendent; I am ashamed I cannot bear it. Together with you I discourse on virtue, roam the Three Realms, always thinking of untroubled ease, roaming reverently in emptiness; this feeling can be spoken of. Public respect, what need to add more? Only soon to ascend to high office; to part from distant days draws near; if there be longing and regret, what then?"

The Blue Youth replied: "I hold your great wishes, often there is grace and comfort." The Immortal Lord said: "The Heavenly Master said that on the fifteenth day of each month one can fast in quiet chambers, read the received Daoist Scriptures, and all Immortal Daoist traces are to be for the later sages’ people; living to meet this age, is it not joyful? On the Dingmao day, I paid homage to the East Flower Blue Youth at the Quiet Centre, facing north with three bows, seeking the wished-for affairs of gods and immortals; and on my birthday read Scriptures, not mixing with human affairs; all are the main words of seeking immortality. The Daoists have many such matters; the proper object of worship; the great secret lies in the cinnabar; feelings act upon the mysterious teaching; wishes are all fulfilled."
