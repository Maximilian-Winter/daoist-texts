Its height surpasses the nine heavens above; its depth penetrates the nine earths below. It unfolds through myriad transformations, the Dao exhausted therein. If there be one who can receive, uphold, read, and recite this scripture without slackening of heart, he shall obtain immeasurable wisdom of life, increase immeasurable wholesome causes, extinguish immeasurable karmic obstacles, dissipate immeasurable vexations, extend immeasurable calculation of longevity, lengthen immeasurable fields of blessing. In all generations he shall rejoice and prosper, in each birth be glad and happy. Always must he be reverent and respectful, copy and circulate it, to benefit all beings. This is immeasurable. Real Persons, hearing this, believe, accept, and practice it."
