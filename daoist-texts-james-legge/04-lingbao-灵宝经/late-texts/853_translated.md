The Scripture of the Twenty-Four Precepts Spoken by the True Person of the Great Ultimate

At that time, the Primordial Heavenly Honoured One, who was born before Heaven and Earth, diffused his Qi to the ten directions, accomplishing the myriad images. He is the Lord of men and gods, the sovereign of rivers and mountains. The sun and moon follow him in their courses; the four seasons receive from him their forms. He made the ladder and the raft of the Way, to be the ferry and bridge of life and death. From the manifestation of being to non-being, adapting to the time, he expediently set forth teachings, to save and ferry the living beings. To form his Dharma body, he pervades all under Heaven, accomplishing all wisdom, and arousing boundless heart. Sometimes he assumes the form of an emperor, sometimes that of a magistrate, sometimes that of a official attendant, sometimes that of a recluse, sometimes that of a Dharma master, sometimes that of a Dragon King, sometimes that of a man, sometimes that of a woman, sometimes that of a beggar, sometimes that of one lowly and base. Varied are his transformations, conforming to the world; the eyes of the common mortals cannot see him.

Because of not knowing, there is manifold confusion and inversion, and distinctions of right and wrong, self and others. Greed and ignorance arise from following love and desire. From attachment and grasping there springs up hell, and enmity is formed. From birth to birth, from kalpa to kalpa, not once awakening to true mindfulness, body and mind have not entered the source of stillness; rising from falsehood to truth, falling into the evil paths; drifting upon the river of love, blown by the wind of karma, how can one be rightly fixed? The three karmas one sows, the ten evil thoughts one creates; within the true Dharma all is discriminated, sinking forever in the sea of suffering, unable to find cause for release. Ever mindful of the boundless suffering of living beings, I now transmit the precepts, to stop evil and prevent transgression; he who can rely on them and practise them, thus attains the fruit of the Way.

The True Person of the Great Ultimate further said: In my past five hundred lives, I set my mind to cultivate the Way, and saw that all dharmas are none but true dharma. How is this? Because one does not see the false as real. Knowing all dharmas, there is none that is not true. Why? Because of true knowledge. Therefore, those who know the false see false; those who are true see the true. If one but makes a true heart, that is true wisdom. Truth does not part from falsehood; falsehood transforms back into truth. Falsehood does not part from truth; the deluded true becomes false. But if one can sever the false and return to the true, keeping the precepts as taught and practising them, reading and reciting day and night, he will be ever free from hell, all attaining the heavens.

Whenever mindful of the precepts, on the days of the month: the 1st, 8th, 14th, 15th, 18th, 23rd, 24th, 28th, 29th, and 30th—if the month be short, then the 27th—these are called the ten straight fasting days. The days of the solar terms: Beginning of Spring, Spring Equinox, Beginning of Summer, Summer Solstice, Beginning of Autumn, Autumn Equinox, Beginning of Winter, Winter Solstice—these are called the eight seasonal fasting days. The 15th days of the first, seventh, and tenth months—these are the three primary fasting days. The 1st days of the first, fourth, seventh, and tenth months—these are called the four beginnings of fasting. The 7th day of the first month, the 7th day of the seventh month, and the 5th day of the tenth month—these are called the three meetings of fasting. On such days, the practitioners of the same calling assemble together, cultivating the Way and precepts, some more, some less; dwelling together in quiet chambers, purifying by fasting and chanting, thinking sincerely and burning incense; or in the contemplation halls, called blessed places, sweeping and cleaning the rooms and courtyards, that is the mysterious altar, able to command the Dharma masters, reciting my wondrous sincerity, burning manifold wonderful incense.

At that time there are attendants and officials on the left and right, the thirty-two heavenly true immortals and emperors, the spiritual officials of the ten directions, the generals of the Five Mountains, the earth spirits of the nine provinces, the great officers of the forests and hills, the spirits of the water palaces, the twelve stream-nymphs, the flying heavenly kings, the heavenly children, and innumerable host, all at once assembled to recall the precepts. They record the merits, and note those who awaken their hearts; surely for them their sins will be eradicated. If one can steadfastly copy, receive, and uphold this text, ever mindful of it, from kalpa to kalpa, life to life, one shall not fall into hell.

The True Person speaks the precept verses, saying, "We now, all assembled, with deep heart and shame, each one receiving and holding them; only do we pray that the Precept Masters will continually explain them."

---

**The First Sincere Precept:** One must not kill life, nor sever the lives of others; nor boil and cook dainties for the sake of one's own body. Nor kill oneself, nor teach another to kill, nor rejoice at seeing killing; nor feast upon living beings. The transgressor in past life suffers the penalty of the cauldron of boiling water in hell.

**The Second Sincere Precept:** One must not steal nor take wealth unjustly; neither enter a man's house by night, nor peep into gardens by day, taking advantage of opportunity to rise to thieving mind. Nor steal oneself, nor teach others to steal, nor rejoice seeing theft. The transgressor in past life suffers the penalty of the mountain of knives and the forest of swords in hell.

**The Third Sincere Precept:** One must not harbour secret plots, nor unjustly entrap the good. Seeing another surpass oneself, one desires to harm him, scheming for unfair advantage, seeking own profit; if he loves me, I recognise him; if I hate him, I resent him. The transgressor in past life suffers the penalty of the furnace of burning coals in hell.

**The Fourth Sincere Precept:** One must not be false in word while hiding the heart; sow discord among kin; speak ill of the Three Treasures; slander the recluses. The tongue running riot, not laughing at the good, slandering the holy teaching, doubting with a divided heart; speaking words unjustly, inciting discrimination. The transgressor in past life suffers the penalty of the iron plough cultivating the tongue in hell.

**The Fifth Sincere Precept:** One must not disdain the scriptures nor scorn the Way; deceive and entice others, ruin the mysterious altar, infringe on the constant residence, hide one's merit, trample the blessed land. The transgressor in past life suffers the penalty of the file and millstone filing the body in hell.

**The Sixth Sincere Precept:** One must not drink wine. Drunkenness disquiets the mind, making one fierce and unmeasured, without reverence for rites and music; shouting, disturbing the honoured and kin; calling upon spirits in alarm, damaging heart and qi. The transgressor in past life suffers the penalty of the serpent that devours the heart in hell.

**The Seventh Sincere Precept:** One must not utter false words or ornate speech, nor speak evil or sow discord. Cursing honoured and kin, defaming teachers and elders, turning good words to evil, changing friends to enemies. The transgressor in past life suffers the penalty of molten copper poured into the mouth in hell.

**The Eighth Precept:** One must not act with evil heart or crooked mind; be addicted to lust and love of beauty; fixate and become bewildered; forsake the grace of others; seize another's favour and separate another's household. The transgressor in past life suffers the penalty of embracing a pillar of copper in hell.

**The Ninth Sincere Precept:** One must not be stingy, covetous, or grudging of wealth, seeking only own profit; envy others, curse all; mutually suspecting and deeply resenting each other. The transgressor in past life suffers the penalty of the iron wheel in hell.

**The Tenth Sincere Precept:** One must not break fast or precepts; be unfilial and unkind; steal fasting food, conceal kitchen offerings, causing their merits to be incomplete. The transgressor in past life suffers the penalty of carrying stones and piling mountains in hell.

**The Eleventh Sincere Precept:** One must not destroy revered images, steal banners and flowers, to offer them to oneself as clothing and bedding. The transgressor in past life suffers the penalty of the iron bed in hell.

**The Twelfth Sincere Precept:** One must not witness merit destroyed, houses and halls collapsing; neglect repair and upkeep, harbouring vanity and fault. The transgressor in past life suffers the penalty of the forest of swords cutting body and mind in hell.

**The Thirteenth Precept:** One must not, upon visiting a household or seeing another’s possessions, immediately lend or borrow, making no effort to repay. Fabricating poverty and hardship, unreasonably pressing to seize. The transgressor in past life suffers the penalty of the cold ice in hell.

**The Fourteenth Sincere Precept:** One must not rejoice at another’s anxiety or sorrow; at another’s wealth, think to take it away; at another’s kindness, hold dislike and disdain. The transgressor in past life suffers the penalty of iron nails piercing the body and the body in fierce fire in hell.

**The Fifteenth Sincere Precept:** One must not enter the Way-hall without washing hands and rinsing mouth, thereby defiling the scriptures and images, polluting the sacred characters. A mind not reverent produces much laziness and neglect. The transgressor in past life suffers the penalty of the iron rod disturbing the examinations in hell.

**The Sixteenth Precept:** One must not probe nests to break eggs, harm the unborn or cause miscarriage; act unreasonably and arbitrarily, cutting off the path of birth. The transgressor in past life suffers the penalty of a great stone crushing body in hell.

**The Seventeenth Sincere Precept:** One must not expose the naked form beneath Heaven, the sun, moon, and stars, nor amidst the three enlightenments and six samadhis. The transgressor in past life suffers the penalty of the iron awl piercing the body in hell.

**The Eighteenth Sincere Precept:** One must not consume and destroy the constant residence, nor pluck flowers and fruits, damage gardens, or pollute the contemplation halls. Without shame or remorse, one lightly esteems the blessed land. The transgressor in past life suffers the penalty of swallowing iron pellets in hell.

**The Nineteenth Sincere Precept:** One must not eat mixed flesh and pungent spices — scallions, garlic, leeks, and alliums — which bring foulness within the body and cause spirits not to dwell. Reciting and cultivating, one thereby offends the sacred spirits. The transgressor in past life suffers the penalty of swallowing fire and charcoal in hell.

**The Twentieth Sincere Precept:** One must not be self-righteous, nor mock another’s household; in all dharmas raise up self and other antagonistically, holding fast to the mind, not seeing the true and correct. The transgressor in past life suffers the penalty of the millstones and grinders in hell.

**The Twenty-First Precept:** One must not administer poison or harmful drugs to others, harming their nature and life, thus creating enmity. The transgressor in past life suffers the penalty of the hundred poisonous juices pouring and boiling body and mind in hell.

**The Twenty-Second Sincere Precept:** One must not calculate the Three Treasures, separate from kin, nor think of giving and charity, seeking only own benefit. Words are two-hearted, faith is not practised. The transgressor in past life suffers the penalty of the tongue pulled out in hell.

**The Twenty-Third Sincere Precept:** One must not mix fasting food with pungent meats, wine, and flesh, nor disrespect the fasting precepts; the heavens will punish such men. The transgressor in past life suffers the penalty of iron chains binding the body, and inability to be reborn in hell.

**The Twenty-Fourth Sincere Precept:** One must not rely on the strong and mighty, deceive and entice the poor and lowly; separate male and female; disbelieve in the true immortals; give rise to the two views; not sever self and other; act wrongly without knowing the cause of sin. The transgressor in past life suffers the penalty of sawing and cutting body and mind in hell.

The True Person of the Great Ultimate further said: These twenty-four sincere precepts are the great afflictions of the body. The transgressors suffer knives for ten thousand kalpas, constantly examined by the life-soul tribunal. Ordinary men may be afflicted with pains all over, or their bodies discoloured with blue and red, hearts full of anxiety and sorrow. This is the life-soul being judged by the dark officials; each must according to power burn incense, enter fasting, perform rites of the Way and repentance, hold the mind to receive the precepts, think of the supreme Heavenly Honoured One, make offerings of lamps, and widely create merit, further never to transgress again; their sins will surely be removed.

The True Person further said: Whoever desires to learn the Way must first fast and keep the precepts, cleanse the heart and guard against calamities. The merit of holding the precepts exceeds the number of dust particles. The number of dust particles can be seen and measured; the merit of fasting and precepts is boundless and endless. One person holding the precepts causes nine ancestors to be born in Heaven, the whole family to be blessed, and to be helped in peril and dissolution. Even if one gives away all the family property in alms, he must still hold to this precept scripture. If one studies the Way without holding these precepts, in the end no accomplishment will be attained. One who can hold these precepts will have all the heavenly emperors, heavenly true great sages, divine immortals and jade maidens, and all spiritual officers of the boundless world. Burning incense and lamps, those holding the precepts gain immeasurable blessings, able to accomplish the genuine Way; the heavenly incense and flowers then come forth to welcome them, surely guiding them to be born according to their wishes. If good men and good women hear this precept scripture and their hearts rejoice, their evil karma will be removed. If they can give up stinginess and greed, and use pure wealth to redeem the transmitted scriptures and precepts, arousing heart and diligence, then for those sending off the deceased or during the first seven days of chanting, even until the seventh week, reciting this precept will enable the souls to fly to pure realms and be reborn in Heaven. A pregnant woman hearing this precept scripture, at the time of peril and dissolution, if it be for the calamities of her own body, will dispel the suffering causes, and the whole family will gain immeasurable blessings. By restraining vexations and blocking demon minds, diligently cultivating and hastening liberation, the heavens all chant in unison, and say this verse:

> All who cultivate and learn,  
> Swear to attain the genuine Way.  
> Compassionately recalling the precepts,  
> Following the voice to sever vexations.  
> Forever free from suffering birth and death,  
> Attaining the unsurpassed Way.  
> Returning heart toward the true and correct,  
> The red countenance shall not fade nor grow old.
