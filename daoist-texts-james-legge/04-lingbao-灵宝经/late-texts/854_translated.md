The Most High Twelve Supreme Grades Flying Heaven Dharma Wheel Admonition and Precept Wondrous Scripture

The Supreme Ultimate Perfected Transmits to the Left Immortal Elder

My original Master is the Primordial Heavenly Honoured One. At that time He dwelt in the Great Luo’s Vaulted Heaven among the many-treasured palaces, naturally upon the fragrant realm’s Dao and Virtue Flower Terrace, never departing from the causal mind, vowing to save all sentient beings. Thus He rested in stillness yet moved, exercising equanimity of mind; by means of expedience He opened manifold wondrous portals, unfolded great compassion and kindness, and by the method of non-action benefited and delivered the three periods. Thereupon He assumed a transformation-body, named the Void Sovereign. The title Void Sovereign is honoured as the Dao Lord; the transformations of the Dao Lord pervade the ten directions, the three thousand great-thousand boundless worlds.

In each single world are various countries; each country manifests diverse transformation-bodies; each transformation-body emits boundless light; within each light appear true images; each true image is a perfect shining circle, dazzling the sun and illuminating through heaven. On the face of heaven and sun there is no darkness unilluminated, and the wondrous perfect brightness removes all obstruction. Sentient beings receiving these gifts, moving and growing, feel gratitude; the three paths cease contention; the six destinies ascend and advance. The heavens and men overflow; hells are left empty and quiet; wherever touched there is purity; the Dharma realm shines bright.

Then He gathered all the lights and returned to the Dao, uniting with the body, the true rite profound and clear, manifesting and opening subtle wonders. Again He struck the golden finger and unfolded the jade-like voice. At that time the bells and drums sounded themselves; heavenly immortals leapt for joy; the golden censer and treasured seal emitted incense smoke spontaneously. All the heavens and men, and the boundless multitudes, each increased their blessings and powers, meeting in non-action; their spirits opened to awakening and understanding; worldly anxieties were suddenly forgotten; they entered the source of wisdom and meditation; they saw the boundless saints and together beheld the Most High Primordial Heavenly Honoured One.

Then the Heavenly Honoured One addressed the Perfected of Wondrous Practice and the great assembly, saying: “This day is good; this time is also good; your hearts are good; the great assembly is good. Therefore I for your sakes open and exercise compassion, to protect the world, the small blessings and inferior meritorious acts; all sentient beings may ascend and advance, not suffer decline and loss. Therefore I now establish the unsurpassed bulwark, faithfully guarding sentient beings and increasing the virtuous and good, namely the Nine True Wondrous Precepts, the illuminating light of wisdom, to which the three realms and ten directions turn in reliance, faith, and acceptance. Therefore I now speak to comfort and make happy sentient beings, truly as I have said.”

At that time the assembly, foreseeing the speaker, each fixed their hearts, long kneeling and kowtowing, submitting to the holy honoured one, earnestly wishing great mercy, that He might grant the honoured precepts to me. Thus earnestly entreating, for half a kalpa’s time, the heavens scattered incense, the saints offered treasures, bowing heads thrice to entreat, with unyielding hearts.

Then the Heavenly Honoured One, seeing this earnest entreaty, joyfully pronounced it good. Thereupon the Compassionate Honourable again spoke these words: “All sentient beings through ignorance and attachment fall into a long night and ultimately reach extinction. My concern and thought for you are more compassionate than parents, the grace heavy and embracing. Like children fallen into a great deep pit, whose pit is dark and perilous, full of poisonous snakes; the parents hearing of this have great sorrow and pity, first chanting divine incantations to forbid the poisonous snakes, to keep the child safe and not swallowed. They bind a precious pole firmly, and with hooked ladders and strong men enter to support and bring out, all to place them on smooth paths. These children are foolish and unaware of fear, and suddenly fall a second time, surely losing their lives. Parents again beseech the Heavenly Honoured One, who again devises plans, teaching divine incantations to subdue poisonous snakes, giving the precious pole again to carry away from the dangerous pit. So it is now with my teaching and method.

The bottomless three paths are but deep pits, with pains and poisons, the most poisonous snakes. All sentient beings are my children, and therefore I honour these precepts. This divine writing and incantation can cause ignorance to vanish at a single thought. This is the method of peace and happiness, the supreme means of advancement, revered by sages of the three periods. Even to the realms of the forty-eight heavens and five hundred million earthly abodes, emperors, queens, crown princes, and princesses, all officials, at their first taking office should observe and recite it.

Again, all those with the heart of the Way, monastics and laymen, the four orders of men and women, high and low, mountain or worldly, all sentient beings without rank or difference of kind, desiring to receive the precepts, must first purify themselves, make great vows, proceed to the Master’s gate, perform the Dao ceremony and recite. If no Master is available to grant (them), they must obtain the good by reciting before the seats of the Three Treasures, pronouncing thus: ‘What is called attainment of true good is as if at the place of the Dao ceremony, the eyes open to divine light, shining bright as the sun, at first small then great, the three realms glowing. Heaven and earth, mountains and rivers, without obstruction, and all boundless wondrous causes — this is called brightness, the clear and uncontested mark of the precept.’ If not so, it is not attainment of the cause of the precept. If one meets a great good Master, this is called the meeting of a prior predestined auspicious assembly, and there is no need to distinguish by appearance. Now I tell you, to meet the cause of the precept is rare as a kalpa, at this time and occasion you must raise your resolve and together stir up good thoughts.”

Then the Heavenly Honoured One uttered a verse:

With equanimity of mind I speak the true wondrous precepts,  
Desiring all beings to be peaceful and sit in the Dao’s place.  
Heavenly dragons, demons, spirits, night-raiders, and non-human beings,  
The foremost eloquent ones all attain them in receiving and holding.  
Know that those who obtain the precepts enter the true saintly grade.  
Whether heavenly or mundane saint, all should hold reverence.  
At new moon and full moon they ascend to the Lion’s Seat.  
With upright mind and regulated qi, harmoniously they speak these precepts.  
All who hear the Dharma sound silently listen.  
Those who do not recite themselves enter the hall of blessings through faith.  
Therefore at this good time I for you proclaim the wondrous precepts.  
You having obtained the precepts must again disseminate and proclaim.  
All desiring to receive precepts, and reading or reciting,  
Must first take refuge in the Three Treasures, then next declare the precepts.  
Those who properly hold and recite see seven kinds of worldly blessings.  
You should well believe and not give rise to doubting thoughts.  
First, those with short lives will gain prolonged life in due time.  
Second, those with dull natures will all open broad hearts.  
Third, those of lowly form will gradually assume noble aspect.  
Fourth, all poor and needy will soon become rich and ample.  
Fifth, those of ugly countenance will increase all their comeliness.  
Sixth, internal and external diseases will daily be removed and healed.  
Seventh, vexing and harmful causes will soon be found to yield great peace and well-being.  
Know that those receiving precepts have blessings and merits such as these.  
In the future they will have superior good causes, endlessly for countless eons.  
Ascending through the six stages of the three nines, they attain the unsurpassed Way.

The Heavenly Honoured One of Full-Wish.

Having spoken the verse, the Honoured One addressed the four assemblies: “Those who desire to hear the great Way’s Dharma sound and the Perfected’s precepts, must be upright within and without, with the three deeds pure, listen attentively and accept, and hold according to the law. All who receive and hold precepts take refuge in the Three Treasures, all sincerely saying ‘good’, without arising divergent thoughts.

Take refuge in the Three Treasures of Dao, Scripture, and Master.

The Honoured One said: “Disciples receiving the true precepts must not engage in the killing trade, nor suicide, nor instruct others to kill, nor kill expediently, nor rejoice in killing, nor kill even from causes and conditions, nor kill when forced, nor repay killing, nor kill maliciously; all such kinds of killing are forbidden. Have compassion for sentient beings as your own life. Those who commit killing suffer six kinds of retribution:

1. Meeting terrible retribution in the world.  
2. Becoming enemies to all sentient beings.  
3. Attracting harm from ghosts and spirits.  
4. The proper retribution of dying and falling into hell, suffering sword trees and knife mountains, undergoing all pain without cease.  
5. Miscellaneous retributions as beasts and animals, eating and being eaten in turn.  
6. Even if reborn human, suffering further punishment and torment.  

This is a great evil deed, not the practice of a true man.

The wickedness of killing is eradicated.

The Honoured One said: “Disciples receiving true precepts must not steal nor take improper wealth, nor accept what is lost on the road, nor what the wind blows, nor what birds carry, nor what is found in the wilderness. Nor kill to gain power or possession, nor delight in trickery, nor entice others, nor take the smallest fraction or particle; all such are forbidden. Those who steal suffer five kinds of retribution:

1. Begging for sustenance and being poor and lowly.  
2. Endeavours fail; all things wasted; harmed by water, fire, and insects.  
3. Constantly vexed by quarrels and losing wealth.  
4. Proper retribution: pervasive torment in hell, pain and poison hard to bear.  
5. Other retributions as oxen, horses, and beasts.  

This is a great evil deed, not the practice of a true man.

The wickedness of stealing is eradicated.

The Honoured One said: “Disciples receiving true precepts must not commit illicit sexual conduct, nor illicitly join male and female in impurity and disorder, polluting the monastic order, violating chastity, no distinction of old and young, nor regard for kinship, nor choosing by beauty or ugliness, nor dividing brothers and sisters; all such causes are forbidden. Those who commit illicit sexual conduct suffer seven kinds of retribution:

1. The root of birth and death.  
2. The source of filth and vexation.  
3. Destroying the practice of good deeds.  
4. Causes of short life, loss of soul and spirit.  
5. Confusion of night and day, consciousness lost and wandering.  
6. Death and falling into hell, iron beds and copper pillars, body burned and bones rotten, appearing and disappearing in cold pools, ice spears and frost blades, dying and being reborn, revolving endlessly, enduring great suffering.  
7. Miscellaneous retributions as pigs, dogs, and unclean beings, beasts and such forms.  

This is a great evil deed, not the practice of a true man.

The wickedness of illicit sexual conduct is eradicated.

The Honoured One said: “Disciples receiving true precepts must not speak falsehoods, slander, or revile the Three Treasures, emperors, kings, masters, monastics or laymen who hold or break the law, whether mundane or saintly; all should be reverenced and lawfully served. If differing in appearances or sects yet sharing the same good, one may follow without dispute. Those who slander suffer six kinds of retribution:

1. Suffering evil diseases in the world.  
2. Darkness in the future, no light.  
3. Mixed retribution over hundreds of kalpas, becoming worms without eyes.  
4. Though among men, often tongueless.  
5. Constantly hated and reviled, none love or respect them.  
6. Born again and again without affinity for good, their words distrusted and shunned.  

This is a great evil deed, not the practice of a true man.

The wickedness of slander is eradicated.

The Honoured One said: “Disciples receiving true precepts must not be double-tongued, speak maliciously, or poison with words, harming sentient beings, creating strife, speaking on both sides. Even ghosts and spirits and mundane men dislike hearing such speech; how much less would saints? Those of evil mouth suffer six kinds of retribution:

1. Enduring abuse in the world.  
2. Death and falling into hell, tongues pulled out and ploughed.  
3. Becoming mute among men.  
4. Hated and harmed by others.  
5. In all directions, constantly dissatisfied.  
6. Receiving retribution as pigs, dogs, bees, scorpions, poisonous creatures, even two-headed snakes and nine-headed birds.  

This is a great evil deed, not the practice of a true man.

The wickedness of evil speech and double tongue is eradicated.

The Honoured One said: “Disciples receiving true precepts must not envy those superior to oneself, nor suppress the wise and bright; having no Dao or virtue oneself, they falsely slander others, stirring up evil thoughts, craftily injuring others and causing their destruction. Those who envy suffer five kinds of retribution:

1. Never seeing the Three Treasures and saints.  
2. Cutting off all good affinities, entangled with evil.  
3. Proper retribution: foolishness, deafness, and blindness.  
4. Often encountering peril and danger, bringing about their own ruin.  
5. Evil affinities and vexations without release.  

This is a great evil deed, not the practice of a true man.

The wickedness of envy is eradicated.

The Honoured One said: “Disciples receiving true precepts must not be stingy and greedy, harming others to benefit oneself. If seeing sentient beings, the heart is never satisfied; by expedient means instructing to have few desires is the heart; attachments to greed are like drinking salt water or a leaking vessel, unable to be filled. Those stingy and greedy suffer four kinds of retribution:

1. Having many gains and losses in the world.  
2. Afterwards lowly, poor, hungry, and cold.  
3. Having the form of hungry ghosts, swallowing fire and charcoal.  
4. Falling to be beasts, wolves, birds, insects, and other retributions.  

This is a great evil deed, not the practice of a true man.

The wickedness of stinginess and greed is eradicated.

The Honoured One said: “Disciples receiving true precepts must not indulge in anger, foul speech, violent cruelty and oppression. Those given to anger suffer four kinds of retribution:

1. Consuming spirit and qi, harmed by poison and force.  
2. Sentient beings do not like to see or hear them.  
3. Dying and becoming poisonous birds, bees, snakes, and evil beasts.  
4. Even if reborn human, lowly, foolish, and despised, lacking power and dignity.  

This is an evil deed, not the practice of a true man.

The wickedness of anger is eradicated.

The Honoured One said: “Disciples receiving true precepts must not be wantonly foolish, self-righteous and perverse, deceiving the wise and good, refusing to be taught or corrected. Those foolish and perverse suffer four kinds of retribution:

1. Losing protection of the divine.  
2. Cutting off the root of goodness.  
3. Losing the right and entering error.  
4. Being entangled by ghosts and spirits.  

This is a great evil deed, not the practice of a true man.

The wickedness of folly and perversity is eradicated.

The Honoured One said: “Disciples receiving true precepts must not rebel against the king, being disloyal and unjust in heart, raising armies and disturbing the masses, harming the innocent. Those disloyal suffer six kinds of retribution:

1. Suffering pain themselves.  
2. Breaking and destroying their families.  
3. After death, constantly in the three evil paths, for countless kalpas without release.  
4. Receiving retribution as poisonous snakes and evil beasts.  
5. Though returning to human form, suffering further torment and slaughter.  
6. Always born in evil places, never a free body.  

This is a great evil deed, not the practice of a true man.

The wickedness of disloyalty is eradicated.

The Honoured One said: “Disciples receiving true precepts must have filial hearts, not disobeying or opposing parents, nor being without reverence and love, nor estranging kin, nor forgetting kindness and grace, nor lacking shame and remorse. Those unfilial suffer six kinds of retribution:

1. Punishment by royal law.  
2. Being abandoned and despised by sentient beings.  
3. Falling into hell with tenfold suffering.  
4. Taking forms of owls and hawks, mutually harming one another.  
5. Even if born human, being unfilial causes men and women to trouble and harm one another.  
6. Being struck by horizontal and vertical forces, cut down by heavenly thunder.  

This is a great evil deed, not the practice of a true man.

The wickedness of unfilialness is eradicated.

The Honoured One said: “Disciples receiving true precepts must not drink wine or eat meat, nor encourage others to do so. Those who drink wine suffer three kinds of retribution:

1. In the world they hinder and lose good Dharma, and even in the future their divine awareness is dulled.  
2. Becoming mad and confused, lacking decisive illumination, often falling to the level of bats and frogs.  
3. Even if they obtain human form, their consciousness is confused and lost, suffering from folly and ignorance.  

Those who eat meat suffer two kinds of retribution:

1. Not practising good Dharma, cutting off the seed of compassion, always repaying sentient beings as enemies.  
2. Their families and relations become separated, much sorrow and little joy; dying to fall into hungry ghosts and hells, taking forms of wolves and beasts.  

This is a great evil deed, not the practice of a true man.

The wickedness of drinking wine and eating meat is eradicated.

The Heavenly Honoured One said: “The above twelve great evil deeds you must swiftly examine and regret, diligently practice repentance. If you do not repent, after death you will suffer the wind-blade’s test upon your body, long falling into evil destinies, born again and again without affinity for the Way. Those with knowledge but lacking feeling do not like to hear or see (these truths), how much less those of true wisdom in body and mind, who themselves endure humiliation.”

Having spoken these precepts, the Heavenly Honoured One again chanted these words: “Disciples receiving true precepts must next make great vows, so that the root of the precepts is firm as the Mountain of Mystical Capital, the marks of the precepts adorned like the Jade Capital palace, the virtue of the precepts bright like the glaze pearl.” The heavens and men together chanted and spoke a verse:

Kowtowing to the Lord of the Three Realms,  
Submitting to the Honour of myriad Dao-s,  
May You bestow the true wondrous precepts,  
Open deliverance for heavens and men.  
Able to raise a fragment of good heart,  
With earnest heart not turning back.  
May Your power always protect,  
Together returning to the Seven-Treasure Grove.
