## Preface to the Scripture of the Supreme Perfected One of the Cavern of Mystery and the Spirit Treasure Inquiring into Illness

At such a time, the Heavenly Venerable Spirit Luminosity and Treasure, of the Cavern of Mystery, appeared in the world of the Benevolent and Wise at the Black Dragon Mysterious Seat in the Dragon’s Tooth Mountain, beneath the Lofty Flowering Tree. There assembled ten directions’ great holy multitudes, numbering many thousands of myriads of myriads of myriads; all assembled at the dharma seat, discoursing, explaining, discussing, and examining the great vehicle scripture, composed of five thousand characters. The whole day and throughout the night they enjoyed its flavour, yet were never sated, never weary, never slack, never remiss. The multitudes who had attained the Way, those yet attaining the fruit of the Way, those who had attained the fruit already—such multitudes were as the sands of dust. Alongside were the Four Heavenly Kings, the Brahma Qi Heavenly Kings, the various heavenly Emperors Shakra, the myriad myriads of Kunlun Kings of the ten directions, all dominions of Kunlun, the thirty-two Brahma Heavenly Kings of gods and spirits, the various heavenly demon kings, the mountain and sea divine kings, the Yang Valley divine kings, numbering many thousands of myriads of men. The three realms’ sentient beings, human and non-human alike, those of the blood-bearing kind, numbered many thousands of myriads of myriads. The external-path sentient beings numbered ninety-eight kinds; the external-path ghosts and spirits also numbered many thousands of myriads of myriads. Moreover, there were the Wheel-turning Holy Kings, the Sun and Moon Sons of Heaven, the various heavenly sons of the ten directions’ worlds, numbering many thousands of myriads of myriads. Each dwelt in their seats or mounts, with their palaces and wives and concubines, all gathered beneath the Lofty Flowering Tree to listen to the Heavenly Venerable’s discourse. The great vehicle scripture’s meaning was profound and difficult to comprehend. None of these multitudes could understand; though unable to understand, their hearts rejoiced, forgetting all dust and filth, each scattering incense and flowers, offering them to the Heavenly Venerable, wishing to understand and illuminate the matter clearly.

The Heavenly Venerable said: ‘I speak of the great vehicle scripture and of the three attainments, things beyond ordinary understanding. Among the multitudes are ever-dwelling Perfected Ones, also Perfected Ones of the past and present, numbering many thousands of myriads. Among them are bright and clear disciples of the great vehicle, eighty-six thousand in number, bearing names such as: Yuan Shi Zhen Ren, Tian Huang Zhen Ren, Tai Ji Zhen Ren, Gao Huang Zhen Ren, Shang Huang Zhen Ren, Tai Yi Zhen Ren, Tai Ping Zhen Ren, Tai Su Zhen Ren, Tai Shi Zhen Ren, Jing Huang Zhen Ren, Chang Ye Zhen Ren, Zheng Yi Zhen Ren, Ding Guang Zhen Ren, Luo Qiao Zhen Ren, Miao Yin Zhen Ren, Liu Luo Zhen Ren, Tai Xu Zhen Ren, Xuan Miao Zhen Ren, Zhi Cheng Zhen Ren, Da Tong Zhen Ren, Wu Liang Zhen Ren, Xuan Ji Zhen Ren, Zi Zai Zhen Ren, Tong San Jie Zhen Ren, Da Li Zhen Ren, Wu Liang Li Zhen Ren, Xiang Hao Zhen Ren, Ming Liao Zhen Ren, Zhi Hui Zhen Ren, Wu Chang Zhen Ren, Dao Shi Zhen Ren, Po E Zhen Ren, Bao Chang Zhen Ren.’ These Perfected Ones are all thoroughly versed in the great vehicle scripture and dharma, having cultivated in former kalpas superior deeds, thus abiding as Perfected Ones. Among the multitudes are those with lesser kalpa bodies, like grains of dust, who in their former existences did not delight in the great vehicle dharma; they are bodies of lesser kalpa. When hearing the great vehicle scripture, their hearts are pleased, yet none dares to ask questions. Among the multitudes the fifth disciple, Wu Shi Zhen Ren, arose and made obeisance, saying to the Heavenly Venerable: ‘Now, speaking of the great vehicle dharma, many among us cannot understand, nor have knowledge sufficient to bear it; only let us constantly make offerings, and when the heart’s wishes are fulfilled, we may attain the supreme Perfected One.’

The Heavenly Venerable said: ‘I now speak the great vehicle dharma; you all understand. The multitudes of future kalpas will be unable to understand this purpose.’ Then he raised his left hand, pointing to the fifth and sixth disciples, Wu Shi Zhen Ren and Ding Guang Zhen Ren: ‘You two shall be the instructors in the Worthy Kalpa; you shall be named Wu Shi Tian Shi, and Ding Guang Tian Shi respectively.’ He further pointed to the seventh disciple, Zheng Yi Zhen Ren, and the eighth, Xuan Miao Zhen Ren: ‘You shall teach the three vehicles in the Turbid Kalpa; Zheng Yi Zhen Ren shall be named San Tian Fa Shi, Xuan Miao Zhen Ren shall be named Liu Du Fa Shi. You four disciples have repeatedly experienced the scriptures of the past, present, and future, entering the subtle and profound, and through the kindness of the great persons, the kings, and the sons of kings, you guide multitudes, rescue those in hellish sufferings, transform the great heavens’ movements, diligently applying yourselves, so that those in the Worthy and Turbid Kalpas may come to know and understand my dharma purpose.’  
‘I now divide my body and titles, numbering hundreds of thousands of myriads. This is because of my illnesses and sufferings. Yi is the first name, Xi is the second, Wei is the third; these are the heads of the three vehicles, also called the origin of the three caverns, with dispersals within, also forming scriptures numbering in the hundreds of millions. The first kalpa henceforth is the Yuqing Palace; the Heavenly Treasure Lord is my first name; the second kalpa is the Ziwei Palace; the Spirit Treasure Lord is my second name; the last three kalpas are the Taiji Palace; the Divine Treasure Lord is my third name.’  
It was said: ‘In the coming kalpas, the first abides in Yuqing, the second disperses as Spirit Treasure, the third controls the demon spirits. Spirit is my first title, the father of all things, able to complete all things. Treasure is my second title, the mother of all things, able to give birth to all things’ sons. This is the Spirit Treasure dharma, to save sentient beings in the turbid ages to come, clearly guiding according to this dharma, recording the text in the Void Sovereign.’  
‘I also have ten names: one for the coming, two for the past, three for the present, four for the ever-abiding, five for guiding the world, six for compassion, seven for purity, eight for emptiness, nine for existence and non-existence, ten for heaven and earth. You all should know and reverently receive my words, remembering these numbers.’  
At that time, all the Perfected Ones, and all the Perfected Ones in the four directions, and all the heavenly sons and kings, spirits and ghosts, human and non-human alike, all rose and made obeisance, praising, ‘Good indeed! May we understand the matter.’  
Then Wu Shi Zhen Ren again asked: ‘Now what has been spoken is divided into hundreds of millions of parts, difficult to understand and comprehend. As disciples we know the multitudes in the turbid world have not fully grasped it. I wish you would explain the nearer and smaller matters, so that all sentient beings may come to understand clearly. The Heavenly Venerable is often afflicted with diseases and sufferings; I wish you would explain the causes of these ailments, why there are such sicknesses, pains, and difficulties, so grievous and intolerable, leading to death-transformations, death not being usual death, transformation not being usual transformation, which the Great Sage does not avoid. As disciples, we often worry and are troubled; though not poisoned by sorrow, yet there is this suffering.’  
The Heavenly Venerable smiled, from his mouth emitted light of eight colours, like dense clouds, and then snapped his fingers, saying to the multitudes: ‘No such question has been asked before. Now there is this great disciple who can well inquire of my deathly disease’s torment. Death’s matters are hard to know and easy to know. Now I shall explain the causes of disease, and speak of them. Let all quiet their hearts. My illnesses have existed from kalpa to kalpa, like the sands that flow, countless entering countless, not to be reckoned as many; always self-troubled and distressed, all because I have a body. If there be a body, there is disease.’

## The Scripture of the Supreme Perfected One of the Cavern of Mystery and the Spirit Treasure Inquiring into Illness

### Chapter One: Inquiry into Illness

Then the Heavenly Venerable said: ‘In later ages, those who study to become immortals, outwardly donning the dharma robes, inwardly harbouring yin evils—this is my great disease; outwardly adorning themselves with splendour, within having no sincere faith—this is my great disease; not constantly practising the Way and repentance—this is my great disease; not thinking on saving sentient beings—this is my great disease; not being compassionate to all—this is my great disease; having lax and backward thoughts—this is my great disease; transmitting the supreme dharma without regard to heaven and earth—this is my great disease; transmitting scriptures without investigating rites and norms—this is my great disease; harming the body and yet undertaking vows—this is my great disease; failing the tests of demons—this is my great disease; kings and ministers dwelling in pride—this is my great disease; riches and honours not founded on reason—this is my great disease; miserliness and greed—this is my great disease; killing and coveting flavours—this is my great disease; disharmony in the household, discord among kinsfolk—this is my great disease; not filial to parents, not compassionate to wife and children—this is my great disease; not practising benevolence and righteousness—this is my great disease; destroying quiet retreats and fasting halls—this is my great disease; not believing in the Three Treasures—this is my great disease; not fearing ghosts and spirits—this is my great disease; stealing and robbing—this is my great disease; scheming against rulers—this is my great disease; disobeying lord and father—this is my great disease; lords and fathers being unrighteous—this is my great disease; despising stars, sun and moon—this is my great disease; ancestral evil roots not exhausted, meeting with calamities, still blamed by enemies and accusers—this is my great disease; turning away from masters’ kindness—this is my great disease; deceiving righteous friends—this is my great disease; slighting masters and neglecting friends—this is my great disease; mocking masters’ faults—this is my great disease; not loving disciples—this is my great disease; not teaching disciples to awaken—this is my great disease; hiding truth and revealing falsehood—this is my great disease; coveting sound and colour—this is my great disease; abandoning dharma for falsehood—this is my great disease; coveting the lesser vehicle—this is my great disease; delighting in external paths—this is my great disease; serving evil spirits—this is my great disease; envying ability and claiming oneself—this is my great disease; not yielding virtue to others—this is my great disease; quarrelsome and self-righteous—this is my great disease; not knowing what is knowing, not understanding what is understanding—this is my great disease; not seeing what is seeing, deceiving and enticing the poor—this is my great disease; borrowing without returning—this is my great disease; incurring debts, taking large measure and giving small, using light scales to give heavy, and heavy scales to take away—this is my great disease; evil speech and cursing—this is my great disease; falsehood and lying—this is my great disease; excessive drinking of wine—this is my great disease; excessive clothing and food—this is my great disease; eating blood and fishy odours—this is my great disease; coveting pungent condiments—this is my great disease; going in and out, walking, lying down and rising, without arising compassion—this is my great disease; heavenly fasting days marked by anger, pardon, hatred, and jealousy—this is my great disease; killing on auspicious fasting days—this is my great disease; husband and wife’s sexuality not according to law—this is my great disease; scolding wind and cursing rain—this is my great disease; mocking the poor and sick—this is my great disease; speaking of others’ gains and losses—this is my great disease; hating others’ successes and failures—this is my great disease; polluting clean streams and roads—this is my great disease; killing and burying dead bodies—this is my great disease; loving and hoarding wealth, unwilling to receive dharma to resolve former karmic roots and establish good causes and conditions—this is my great disease; harming the foetus and aborting children—this is my great disease; cutting and felling trees and fruit groves—this is my great disease; not believing in predestination—this is my great disease; saying heaven and earth have no ghosts or spirits—this is my great disease; not knowing how to give alms to all—this is my great disease; giving alms grudgingly—this is my great disease; cursing and driving away beggars—this is my great disease; accumulating clothing and precious treasures—this is my great disease; belittling others for good or evil—this is my great disease; not aiding the poor and destitute—this is my great disease; passing through all death and decay—this is my great disease.’  
‘I have these seventy-two diseases, from kalpa to kalpa cannot escape, cannot be freed. Because of this, my form changes and my breath scatters, dividing my spirit and body, to create seventy-two saints. Among the saints are Perfected Ones; among Perfected Ones are ranks; among ranks are sections; among sections are phrases; among phrases are sentences; among sentences are words; among words is breath; among breath is form; among form is subtlety; among subtlety is fineness; among fineness is nothingness; in nothingness there is being—this is called the subtle and wondrous. In the wondrous, the upper breath, without breath, forms the true body; the lower breath, with breath, forms the fleshly body; hence there are water, fire, wind, and earth, united to form the four great bodies. My great disease is that I have the four great bodies; without these, what harm would there be? I truly have no four great bodies; what great harm is there? To know my body is to be my body; not to know it is not my body; to know my body is to endure; not to know it is to perish, in pain and poison in hell, enduring long in the five ways, revolving endlessly; hence I transform.’  
‘Without great deeds none can seize it; the method of seizing it I have spoken and heard. My deathly sufferings arise from old age and sickness; birth must have death, flourishing must have decline; men and things are unified, none born without an end. Things are born in spring, grow in summer, wither in autumn, fade in winter; affairs succeed and fail, high things are in danger, peace has sorrow, joy is little, suffering is great—who can know? Death brings vexations and poisons; spirit and essence are hard to transform, sinking and swelling through the night, bitter indeed; though heavens rejoice, they long worry over change; spirits dispersed, four great elements difficult to unite, hence the dwelling is hard to return to.’  
‘I have these sufferings, but they are not truly my sufferings; my death is not death, my life is not life, my old age is not old age. Bitter indeed to have them; to have them is not my body, not to have them is my body. It is said "I die," it is said "I live," these opposing facts of birth and death— I am freed from them; those not freed are sentient beings.’  
The multitude in the seat, both awakened and unawakened, all wished to understand in time, and arose, making obeisance and praising, ‘Good!’

The Heavenly Venerable said: ‘To practise the great vehicle to loosen bonds, one must always fast and observe precepts, wear the great talisman of the three caverns, carry the great register of the three caverns, and contracts, practising the Way according to the dharma, turning the scriptures, six times daily without weariness. The making of the six times is because man receives the four great elements born into six passions; if the six passions do not leave, there must be sources of sin. At one time remove the eyes’ passion, at second time the nose’s, at third the mouth’s, at fourth the ears’, at fifth the heart’s, at sixth the hands’; if one can do this day and night, the six passions vanish of themselves, the six wisdoms then open, practising the six perfections, no longer obstacles remain, divine powers and various demons are freely possessed, longevity and long vision, no sufferings, poisons, or vexations.’  
‘The lamp is the light shining through the long night’s house, to resolve the seven generations of father and mother, the worldly parents’ darkness; the burning of incense is to remove the foulness in the three realms, so that hell returns to fragrant purity. It is like the fragrant apple grass, also called ghost medicine, also called Yi Lan, which in a radius of four hundred li constantly raises fragrance to fumigate the three realms’ sentient beings, making the various airs; diseases are soothed by the incense of sandalwood and agarwood and other scents, so that the three realms and hell return to fragrant purity, the souls and spirits are transformed, sentient beings revived, the world joyful, the six passions extinguished, the five constants at rest. The five constants resting can repay the five virtues: one, parents; two, teachers and disciples; three, hosts; four, kings and fathers; five, the people’s parents. Affectionate love between teachers and disciples, concern and aid from hosts, offerings to kings, care and love for the people and the poor—this is called the five virtues. Among numbers it is clear, clearly known by itself; the words as spoken are not vain or false, but true words; sentient beings can know and learn, reflect deeply, reflect deeply.’

### Chapter Two: Rites for the Ears and Universal Hearing Divine Powers

One hears the Perfected One’s chanting and whistling, the seven treasure palaces’ natural music of maidens, the heavenly beings’ discourse and recitation, the dragon and phoenix’s cries and songs, the spiritual winds scattering flowers, the demon kings’ chaotic songs, the celestial boys and jade maidens’ harmonious voices, heavenly drums sounding naturally, the saints’ court assembly sounds, the Five Emperors’ transcendence to immortality sounds, the North Emperor’s death registry sounds, the Southern Dipper’s life determination records, the Central Dipper’s celestial notebooks, the three realms’ separation of good and evil sounds, Mount Tai’s judgment of the net of punishment sounds, the kings’ palaces’ music of maidens, the shining soldiers’ military instruction sounds, literary thoughts and poetry discussions, the Taoist priests’ incense rites and vows, preaching and teaching universal meanings, educating children, rescuing the sick and crossing dangers, the voices of boys and girls, the speech of mountain, forest, river, sea ghosts and spirits concerning good and evil, the hermits’ secluded valleys enjoying the ultimate scriptures’ sounds, hellish hungry ghosts begging east and west, the hellish monsters’ torments and cries, the labours of the three officials seeking death without success, the yang officials’ prison interrogations and pains, the six kinds of beasts’ cries when killed by men, the birds and beasts and fish devouring one another, the sounds of struggles and the summoning of ghosts and spirits, killing and sacrifices to evil spirits, drum sounds and bells, play, sorrow, weeping, mourning, the poor men’s complaints, the sick’s groans, the rich and noble’s pride, the calamities of robbers and thieves, licentiousness and sensual pleasures, the heavens above and the earth below, all these various sounds can be known and heard, yet do not disturb the root of the ears; all are the divine powers obtained by the discipline of precepts.

### Chapter Three: Rites for the Eyes and Universal Seeing Divine Powers

One sees the Perfected Ones discoursing in heavenly palaces, the great saints of the ten directions at peace and unmoved, the sun and moon dividing the light, the notes and tones harmonizing, yin and yang mutually producing, dragons and phoenixes crying, flying devas scattering flowers, the Heavenly Venerable guiding in the air, the great assembly’s teaching of the Way to heavens, the three realms’ transcendence to immortality, the Five Emperors’ name recording, kings and ministers at play, Taoist priests discussing scriptures and dharma, repentance and practising the Way, birth and death parting, weeping and mourning, hellish suffering souls, yang officials’ prisoners in sharp pain, hunger and thirst without food or drink, birds and beasts harming and eating each other, killing and sacrifices to ghosts and spirits, licentiousness and flower-falling, false speech and untimely words, yin evils, slander and jealousy, laxity and complaints, the heavens above and the earth below, all such times can be clearly seen, yet do not disturb the root of the eyes; all are divine powers obtained by the discipline of precepts.

### Chapter Four: Rites for the Nose and Universal Smelling Divine Powers

The various heavens’ natural fragrances, the subtle fragrance of Tuo Luo, the Sha Mo Ni scales’ fragrance, Bo Ti Man Hua fragrance, the wind-born Mi He fragrance, the Blue Flower and White Flower fragrance, the Purple Flower and Red Flower fragrance, the Blue and Yellow Flower fragrance, the Yin Clouds of the Two Places fragrance, the Diamond Hue fragrance, the beautiful fragrances of the Ten Directions’ Perfected Ones’ forms, the fragrant airs of the heavenly colourful maidens, the sandalwood and agarwood fragrances, the high-cool green cassia fragrance, the Anxi sparrowhead fragrance, Ai Na and Ju garlic fragrance, the insect and tick and Jia Dang fragrance, the fumigation of Anxi incense, the herbs Gan and Ming Lan fragrance, the beautiful water medicines’ fragrances, the living flower forms’ fragrance, human heads and bird feathers fragrance, the boy and girl fragrances, the Mao Xian Ke Moon fragrance, breath soft and tender fragrance, the heavens above and the earth below, all such fragrances can be known and smelled, yet do not disturb the root of the nose; all are divine powers obtained by the discipline of precepts.

### Chapter Five: Rites for the Mouth and Universal Taste Divine Powers

The heavens’ sweet spiritual flavours, swallowing the sun and taking the flower flavour, drawing the moon and eating essence flavour, food without light absorption flavour, Luo Sheng reflecting the mysterious flavour, the green water and yellow essence flavour, the Ying grass and beautiful garlic flavour, the jade seal penetrating mystery flavour, wind-born jade and stone flavour, pine and cypress sweet mouth flavour, life without life fumigation flavour, the heavens above and the earth below, all such flavours can be fully known and tasted, yet do not disturb the root of the mouth; all are divine powers obtained by the discipline of precepts.

### Chapter Six: Rites for the Hands and Universal Power Divine Powers

The hands do not take from themselves or others; they do not move yet are full; do not shake yet are abundant; do not shift yet are even; do not work yet have power; do not grasp yet come naturally; do not hold yet are lifted; do not clutch yet are full; like divine hands, all are divine powers obtained by the discipline of precepts.

### Chapter Seven: Rites for the Heart and Universal Subtle Divine Powers

The heart can contain the three realms, can move the great void, can command demon spirits, can subdue multitudes of spirits, can form palaces, can form yin and yang, can guide the sun and moon, can sport in the Way-place, can roam the Perfected Ones, can be light and splendour, can enter the subtle, can form great forms, can be water and fire, can be wind and earth, can aid heaven and earth, can save hell, can pass through various calamities, can dissolve various forms, can harmonize with all things, variously able to do all, yet does not confuse the root of the heart; all are divine powers obtained by the discipline of precepts.

The Heavenly Venerable said: ‘This is the body that receives the four great elements, able to conform and regulate, and to observe the precepts. One may see that in the present world-body, universal divine powers are attained, though the Way-true is not yet realized; thus the spirit may move freely, from here advancing in study, gradually entering the subtle. From one to three, the time of accomplishment is the way of long vision; though far from the three evils, without sorrow, vexation, or poison. When the six are all opened, one merges with the One Spirit, and together they soar to the Upper Purity.’

The sentient beings hearing this did not understand, not knowing my true words, yet constantly offered incense, lamps, food, precious treasures, canopies, banners, brocades, robes, beds, mats, high seats, and halls to the dharma masters, their resolve and conduct thus, the fruit’s reward will surely come, one seed gaining ten thousand, like the grain of paddy in the field. Strive by your own power; do not give rise to doubt and lose your causes and conditions, lest you fall into the long night, revolving through the five ways; this is the difficulty of awakening and understanding.

### Chapter Nine: The Merits and Recompenses of Beings in Former Kalpas

The Heavenly Venerable said: ‘In former kalpas, all sentient beings who studied the supreme Way and made offerings to the Three Treasures had long ago attained the true Way; those who chanted the Cavern Scripture had long ago attained the true Way; those who practised fasting and precepts had long ago attained the true Way; those who swallowed essence and drew breath had long ago attained the true Way; those who practised medicine and guiding breath had long ago attained the true Way; those who performed the eight rhythms among the five mountains and three rivers had long ago attained the true Way; those who furnished the dharma masters with robes had long ago attained the true Way; those who encouraged and aided the incense offerings and the poor had long ago attained the true Way; those who made vows and rejoiced in the great vehicle had long ago attained the true Way; those who gave alms and released life had long ago attained the true Way; those who aided others in making quiet retreats and chambers had long ago attained the true Way; those who planted fruit groves to offer to dharma masters’ halls had long ago attained the true Way; those who aided others to read and recite scriptures had long ago attained the true Way; those who aided others in fasting and conveying strength had long ago attained the true Way; those who observed and listened, practised the Way, repented, and developed faith and understanding had long ago attained the true Way; those who had faith and chanted the phrase ‘Good indeed’ had long ago attained the true Way; those who examined themselves with reverence for the dharma had long ago attained the true Way; those who in going out, lying down, sitting, or rising always practised compassion had long ago attained the true Way; those who gave life release and saved the dying had long ago attained the true Way; those who did not envy the learned and studious had long ago attained the true Way; those who constantly praised the good and excellent had long ago attained the true Way; those who did not think on killing life had long ago attained the true Way; those who bestowed alms upon beggars and the poor had long ago attained the true Way; those who rescued the distressed and assisted the urgent had long ago attained the true Way; those who lit lamps to shine in the night had long ago attained the true Way; those who were good and wise protectors of the dharma had long ago attained the true Way.’  
‘With such merits many Perfected Ones attained the Way in former kalpas. Briefly speaking of these matters, all are recorded in golden registers and jade scrolls, all due to the causes and conditions made in former kalpas.’

### Chapter Ten: The Metaphors of Virtue’s Covering

The Heavenly Venerable said: ‘I am the father and mother of all sentient beings, pitying and loving you, compassionate to all, covering and nurturing all, moistening all. All things obtain me as fish obtain the deep, as children obtain their mother, as the hungry obtain food, as the thirsty obtain drink, as the sick obtain medicine, as the people obtain a king, as the fearful obtain a guide, as the drowning obtain a boat, as the poor obtain treasure, as the punished obtain pardon, as the lost obtain revival, as the defeated obtain success. My dharma universally saves all sentient beings, like great clouds spreading over the sky, distributing fine rain, none not receiving moisture. Do sentient beings know me? I bring you into being, nourish you, nurture you, grow you, pity you. Why do you not know compassion and repay my kindness by practising good deeds? Yet when you see my dharma and do not repent and uprightly establish causes, you tend to fall into evil paths, sinking into hell; it is grievous and sorrowful. Therefore, each should diligently exert themselves to remove the roots of sin and obtain eternal bliss, as I have spoken.’

### Chapter Eleven: The Causes and Conditions of Sentient Beings’ Original Evil Recompenses

Those who in former lives murdered men and exterminated families now suffer having no descendants; those who killed children and harmed the foetus now suffer many children dying young, becoming the children of enemies; those who hated others’ misfortunes now suffer constant misery; those who hated others’ gains and losses now suffer constant slander; those who mocked the poor now suffer such calamities; those who stole and robbed, and were unrighteous in riches and honours, luring the poor and humble, borrowing and not repaying, now suffer as oxen burdened, only thinking of grass and water; those who lent debts seeking tenfold repayment now suffer constant poverty; those who hated others’ diseases of sores, scabies, palsy, and paralysis now suffer those diseases; those who envied others’ wisdom now suffer dull darkness; those who wore shoes in quiet halls now suffer broken feet and impassable barriers; those who entered others’ homes at night to commit theft now suffer blindness, and also hate the blind; those who dwelt in rich houses eating alone, feigning ignorance and not caring for the urgent, not practising benevolence or righteousness, slighting the poor and humble, now suffer birth in barbarous lands of non-human kind; those who did not hear or see and hated the deaf and blind now suffer these diseases; those who indulged in licentiousness with their own kin now suffer the bodies of donkeys and horses; those who killed and devoured the blood-bearing kinds and craved their flesh now suffer birth as beasts and wild animals, killed by men in return for former enmity; those who killed life and buried dead bones now suffer in the forms they killed; those who killed husbands now suffer having no husbands; those who killed wives now suffer having no wives; those who hated others’ success and failure now suffer constant calamities; those who were hot and haughty now suffer ignorance; those who were ministers and officials hating each other, slandering and harming without reason, causing ruin and enmities, now suffer being slandered by others; those who drank to feed ghosts and spirits now suffer chronic insufficiency; those who cursed and reviled now suffer being reviled and hated, born as dogs and hounds; those who drank wine without measure, violating the good, now suffer disorder of nature; those who were unfilial to parents now suffer birth of unfilial children; those who were unkind to brothers, wives, and children now suffer families not flourishing, constant strife, being mocked; those who wished for others as servants and slaves now suffer being slaves and servants.’  
‘There are many such causes; now I briefly speak one, to make you understand roughly. Sentient beings should not give rise to such wishes or such acts. The recompense of good and evil is firmly established in faith. Without such causes, all would be born as men, sharing the four great elements, yet differing in wisdom and folly; differing in talents; differing in high and low; differing in brightness and darkness; differing in having or not having the six passions complete; differing in talking and discussing or not discussing; differing in being respected or not; differing in respecting rites or not. Thus briefly speaking these matters.’

### Chapter Twelve: The Recompenses of Sentient Beings’ Good Deeds

Those who dwell in worldly wealth come from former lives’ almsgiving;  
Those who dwell as kings come from former lives’ offerings to the Three Treasures;  
Those who dwell as dharma masters, skilful in guiding and transforming, come from former lives’ thoughts on the great vehicle;  
Those who dwell as wise and intelligent come from former lives’ reverent study of scriptures and dharma;  
Those who dwell as feared and respected by men come from former lives’ caution and precepts for the Three Treasures;  
Those who dwell with adequate clothing and food come from former lives’ aid to the poor and needy;  
Those who dwell as officials and nobles come from former lives’ not harming living beings;  
Those who dwell with complete six passions come from former lives’ not destroying the Three Treasures;  
Those who dwell speaking without error come from former lives’ teaching of the great vehicle scriptures;  
Those who dwell as refuge for all come from former lives’ care for all;  
Those who dwell encountering good seats and being praised by men come from former lives’ practising good deeds and wishing for others’ success.’  
‘Such recompenses as these, I now briefly explain their principles. The causes and conditions are many. The roots of good and evil, their recompense is like the sun and moon’s light, the waves of the great sea, the turning of the four seasons, the movements of the five elements, like the wheel of a cart. Sentient beings, do you know? Do you awaken? Do you understand? Do you comprehend? Do you practise? Do you believe? Do you beware? Can you accept? I now speak clearly of these matters of good and evil.’  
All the multitudes were joyful, made obeisance, and praised, ‘Good! May we understand.’

Wu Shi Zhen Ren said: ‘What the Heavenly Venerable has spoken is the great and wondrous matter, sufficient to turn sentient beings’ hearts. Its chapters number hundreds of thousands, yet sentient beings have not been able to comprehend them; only the Way with the Way, and the True with the True, and the Non-being with the Non-being, can mutually understand. I receive the title of the teacher of the later kalpa, to guide the supreme great vehicle dharma. As I reflect on these words, many among the multitudes have not awakened to this reality.’

The Heavenly Venerable’s kalpa body is like the Yang Valley Palace, with a Water Spirit platform, eighty thousand li in circumference, level at all heights. Within there are golden sands, grains as large as mustard seeds, filling it; one grain lasting ten thousand years self-consumes, thus dissipating. This is called the Heavenly Venerable’s lesser kalpa body, like in the north where one hundred and eighty Kunlun domains rule, among thirty-eight thousand worlds, mountains, hills, tiles, soil, forests, all in an instant become fine dust; if scattered in the great void, their numbers are like the Heavenly Venerable’s body. After one great kalpa’s cycle, sentient beings do not awaken, do not believe; among those seated are the four multitudes, lesser vehicle bodies, lesser kalpa bodies, heavenly sons, heavenly kings, heavenly emperors, none know or hear. Now speaking of it, all have doubts; how much more among the turbid multitudes of the world who generate doubts? Therefore I speak it; it can be made clear. To believe is difficult, to know is difficult, to awaken is difficult, to accept is difficult, to meet is difficult, to see is difficult, to serve is difficult; these are the difficulties of my body. I, as instructor, find this difficulty the greatest; the difficulty is subtle and without equal.’

Wu Shi Zhen Ren said: ‘The five thousand characters are the spirit of the five bodies of the Heavenly Venerable Spirit Luminosity and Treasure; the spirit is also Laozi, who decreed five hundred. Laozi gathered together this meaning; Spirit is the father of sentient beings, Treasure is the mother, Luminosity is the sun’s light, enlightening and moistening all; Treasure is the containment in which all things are born. I too have studied it.’

The Heavenly Venerable surveyed the myriad myriads of Sumeru worlds, the multitudes of good and evil, those who study and those who do not, human and non-human, one-legged, two-legged, four-legged, many-legged, born in turbid and moist ways, born from eggs, wombs, or transformation— all such evil are before my eyes, arising from my body, ever departing a few inches from my eyes. Sentient beings say they do not know and do not see, not seeing their true father and mother; some say the true sage is lofty and far, some say there is no spirit or deity; if one can be filial to parents, then the spirit descends; if not filial, misfortunes arrive. Being born from parents is a cause and condition of gestation, the meaning is equal; who can know? Learning the great vehicle is the cause and condition; only wish to be born not thus; the supreme wish to attain the Way; and if merits are insufficient, there is again returning birth and death, but the roots of blessings never cease, and future births are always noble, rich, and virtuous, respected by men, with perfect appearance, led by good spirits in movement, meeting bright teachers in learning, buried in auspicious mountains, wives meeting good women, going out meeting food and salary, evil spirits dare not interfere.’  
‘Those who do not delight in the Three Treasures, do not believe in sacred words, speak evil and curse, do evil deeds, constantly born in the lowly; those who meet dark teachers in learning, are buried in evil mountains, have coarse wives, lose wealth upon going out, linked with corrupt officials, suffer adverse events, are not protected by good spirits, but are drawn by evil spirits—all are due to former causes and predestination, each under the governance of stars; good belong to good stars, evil to evil stars. Birth and death are paired, very distinct; if not saved by the great vehicle, none can escape. Do sentient beings know? Yet they reverently believe external paths and their writings; this error is deeply lamentable. There are one hundred and ninety-eight kinds of way; these also are the Heavenly Venerable’s body. Therefore, in the ten directions’ worlds, sentient beings’ minds and conduct differ, not knowing of ghosts and spirits; thus evil is transformed by evil methods to lead them; good is encouraged to awaken them; conforming to their original minds, gradually causing them to know and awaken to the supreme Way. The perfect is without inner or outer, without surface or wrapping, without fine or coarse, without two or three, without ten or hundred, seeking by practice; seeking it by the mind, the principle of dark and bright, very subtle indeed.’  
‘Sentient beings see and do not see, always as if seeing; fear and do not fear, always as if fearing; beware and do not beware, always as if aware; act and do not act, always as if acting; accept and do not accept, always as if accepting; love and do not love, always as if loving; cultivate and do not cultivate, always as if cultivating; it is necessary to make these three hundred and sixty accords true and not true, one and not one, as I have explained.’

This scripture is the Heavenly Venerable’s golden mouth’s utterance; do not lightly disparage it; lightly disparaging brings punishment, revering it brings blessings and pardon. If there be a son of the great vehicle with resolve, he will surely be devoted to offerings, reading and reciting, pondering this meaning, to understand the sins of the present world, to extinguish the evils of former causes, to release the calamities of the nine ancestors, to save all sufferings. In the future, to seek the Way, making spirit clear and correct, surrounded by ghosts and spirits, demon kings respectfully greeting, bringing gold and treasures, devoting the heart to fasting a thousand days, then he may receive it.’

Wu Shi Zhen Ren said: ‘I receive non-action by the breath of all things; the beginning is the condensation of all things’ essence and breath; the principle of birth and death is my body. It is called Dragon Tooth Mountain, also called Dragon Body, Dragon Liver, Phoenix Cry, Lion’s Head, Lesser Kalpa, Everlasting, Present, Future, and Past. This mountain is eighty thousand myriads of li in circumference; beneath the Lofty Flowering Tree is four hundred myriads of li in circumference. The Most High and Perfected descended once in a kalpa to this mountain to speak the great vehicle scriptures and gather multitudes.’

At that time the Heavenly Venerable spoke various dharmas, each one knowing for himself, awakening to the words and their kinds, not erring; like the king of birds and moths, all with one understanding, beginning at this mountain, whose altar is gold, steps of silver, trees of seven treasures, auspicious clouds as flowers, where dragons, phoenixes, and heavenly beasts rest. Among the multitudes are sentient beings who have not yet met or seen.

The Heavenly Venerable opened a great pardon to show the form of this mountain. It is also the karmic cause of former lives. Those who study this diligently cultivate the great vehicle dharma, and after the fruit will meet this mountain. The mountain also has seven treasure palaces and natural music from maidens; this kingdom has no spring, autumn, winter, or summer; yin and yang, climate and season exist naturally and everlastingly. The great vehicle scripture is but one ear, scattered into hundreds of millions; the dragon chariot cannot carry it, the eastern well is insufficient for a reservoir. One is the five thousand characters; it is emptiness, it is void, it is non-being, it is being, it is heaven, it is earth, it is all things. The ever-abiding Perfected Ones of the ten directions jointly consider it endlessly. This one character is the Heavenly Venerable’s inner name, constantly shown to the world, but sentient beings do not awaken. In later generations, those who attain the fruit of the Way, and the worthy, the sagacious, the learned Confucians pondering this meaning, or employing it as external teachings and empty talk, also it is good. This scripture is the great sage’s body, within drawing in spirit and breath, without spreading wondrous meaning, no one can exhaust it. In former kalpas, sentient beings thought on this purpose, each believing the words, their minds already dissolved. Words and talks are reason and unreason, gain and loss, knowing and not knowing the purpose; I also can bear it, not reproaching others, conforming to the people’s minds, thus it is said to take the people’s mind as one’s own.’

Wu Shi Zhen Ren said: ‘The Way school’s methods of governing the body are like the sands of the Ganges, not to be fully learned, but only to hold to one. Wearing talismans and Taoist guides, practising exhalation and inhalation in hidden retreats, before the功 is full, one cannot, but may diligently offer this scripture, worship, bow, pray, recite, study, with good heart and faith, without doubt, laxity, or weariness; with daily renewed resolve, one can also attain the flight and guide the dragon chariot; the nine ancestors share the same wheel; take good thought. This scripture is five thousand characters.’

Yuan Shi Zhen Ren diligently studied and chanted, his words saying:

‘Wondrous indeed is the supreme Way, the true Way of five thousand characters.  
Emptiness has no root, no trace; traces are dispersed like rosy clouds.  
The dispersed are hard to think and measure; three and one united as the Sovereign Lord.  
The three vehicles have no two; the Void Sovereign spreads out, guiding and declaring.  
Sentient beings have many doubts; speaking the dharma awakens and transmits.  
Removing the roots of evil causes, departing from old age, sickness, and vexation.  
Longevity residing in long vision, the fruit and deed riding scenic clouds.  
Free and easy in the great void, the great saints assemble together.  
Countless kalpas from dawn, no sorrow, no vexation, no enmity.  
Looking back at later learners, lax and unfaithful,  
Jealousy equal among them, how can they ascend the chariot together?  
Sinking and perishing below nine nights, testing Chu is your soul.  
Turning in the three evil paths, good causes are no longer heard.’

Wu Shi Zhen Ren said: ‘In former kalpas, men studied the way of the upper immortals and long life, the method of not dying, not thinking of dwelling in the world; dwelling in the world involves many thoughts; many thoughts involve sorrow; sorrow burdens the heart; the burdened heart forgets the Way. If there are wives and children, one worries about them; if there is wealth, one worries about it; if there is sickness, one worries about it; if there is death and loss, one worries about it; if one is poor, one worries about it. Such conduct is not free from death’s pain and is contrary to long life. One who has a body does not know worry; not knowing worry, then the Way and dharma endure. The body is the house of the four great elements; how can a house endure long? When men depart, the house does not stand. If the spirit is scattered, the spirit’s wheel will not perish, not sink, not cease. Fools build large tombs and great coffins, killing and burying, thinking this is filial and kind, not knowing the opposition of the long night; how deluded, how deluded! Not wishing to be the supreme guest, but to be a king’s subject—this is called suffering.’  
‘A sage’s disciples are not really his disciples; they are the fortunate of former men who place their sacred name there; sages have no seed or learning one must make understood thoroughly. In former kalpas their功 was not full, studying the Way and immortal grades, insufficient to respond and attain extinction, the body experiencing the moon phases; disciples petition dharma masters, with their righteous friends and relatives, to practise the three sevens of fasting, to turn the five thousand characters ten times to rescue their souls and spirits. Those who study the upper Way seek swift turning of the wheel, not needing long life, like foolish common men who protect their lives but have not awakened. Having not awakened, there is weeping; weeping reveals the body’s sickness; pitiable men have success and failure, short and long lives, and weeping always. Therefore the three sevens of fasting: one seven for the water official to remove sins, two sevens for the earth official to absolve faults, three sevens for the three realms to cross sentient beings away from hellish suffering, no longer opposing it, and quickly transforming. Completing three sevens days, making dharma is excellent; if not, the days are divided into sections, which are also good. Six times diligently and painfully, with those who pass their lives first. All things are by faith, offering to the dharma masters and the three treasures; think well on this; it is wondrous indeed, and is the confusion of all men in later generations, who in life do not know to do good, do not establish the field of merit; in death their clothes and treasures are buried in coffins and tombs, increasing trouble for the deceased, not knowing it is to open the path to liberate the dead and ferry them over.’  
‘Those living who cannot bear it may each year perform one passage in cold and heat; there is no need for long forgetfulness of sentient beings’ reality. Understand and think on my words.’

Wu Shi Zhen Ren said: ‘In the coming world, sentient beings’ minds are coarse and evil, not awakening to good causes and conditions; not as in this life’s simplicity; there shall be later worthies and sages to tell dharma’s precepts and ritual teachings. The principle of causes and conditions is the filial and fraternal duties of father and mother, brothers, uncles, sisters, aunts, and kinsfolk, with mourning and mourning clothes; this is for all common men’s charity, not to be shared by those who study the upper Way.’  
‘At the end of parents’ life, each issue a mind of merit, wishing to together transform and be born before their true parents, no longer born and dying, with no spirit of memorial rites, increasing the way of loss. This is called the head of confusion; think carefully on it.’

Wu Shi Zhen Ren said: ‘Later learners most avoid excessive greed and wrongfully suppress human reason, forcing profits for themselves, causing others’ resentment, calling on ghosts and spirits. Though receiving scriptures and dharma, wearing talismans, guiding breath and exhalation, fasting and practising the Way, and taking spiritual medicines, restricting food and drink, they but labour their forms outwardly; immortals are not moved, and are quickly tested and fall away. Small matters cannot be extravagant, taking this to study the Way, seeking worldly competition, this is not the true. To see the world as evil ghosts kill without awareness, and at death thus, spirit sinks and falls into hell, suffering greatly; hard to understand my words.’  
‘Those who study make their hearts enter the ants and worms, also making their hearts enter six domestic animals, also making their hearts enter birds and beasts, also making their hearts enter ghosts and spirits, also making their hearts enter those who love and hate, also making their hearts enter forests and trees, also making their hearts enter all things; all things equally good in their conduct, without a trace of vexation or blame in their hearts. Thus they can be supported by ghosts and spirits, protected by the three realms, naturally attaining the true.’

Wu Shi Zhen Ren said: ‘The Heavenly Venerable and I observe the unfulfilled and the past and present matters clearly as if in my heart.’

At that time the Heavenly Venerable emitted from his forehead a purple hair-like light, universally illuminating the ten directions’ myriad myriads of Kunlun, thirty-six thousand great thousand worlds, among which all various sentient beings were without exception clearly seen and understood. Its light was like gold-colour, within the light were hundreds of thousands of kinds of sound; sentient beings joyfully heard; searching within the light, they found themselves unawares beneath the Lofty Flowering Tree, all good fortune gained and hearing the dharma’s causes and conditions. This is the Heavenly Venerable’s metaphor for all great and mighty spirits. Once in a kalpa one encounter; suitable to oversee later learners, to diligently practise and walk.’

The Heavenly Venerable has great mighty spiritual power, striving to aid sentient beings, hence like in the three realms there is an invisible great sound, an invisible great force, grasping yet unattainable, like the sun, moon, and stars in the void, dwelling mysterious and unattached, extending naturally down, revolving in men likewise. Hence breath and spirit communicate powerfully; thus man preserves truth, truth preserves man; man reveres spirit, spirit reveres man; man loves spirit, spirit loves man; man forgets breath, breath forgets man; man neglects the Way, the Way neglects man. Hence it is said: ‘Having good causes and conditions, from brightness to brightness, from seeing to seeing, from understanding to understanding, from joy to joy; without good causes and conditions, one passes into passing; from darkness to darkness, from suffering to suffering.’ These opposites exist; in later kalpas those who can believe and act, can serve and cultivate, can be good and diligent, are dharma masters, skilfully speaking my words and being instructors, exhorting all to enter the dharma gate, practise fasting and recite scriptures, repent and pray, to save from the bonds of birth and death. Their ritual and disciplines are very numerous, mainly using the collections compiled by later sages. Establish功 and vow, from one to ten, from a hundred to a thousand, from a thousand to ten thousand, assemble brocades and treasures to offer the fasting officials; divided into three: one part to offer the Spirit Treasure’s three teachers, one part to offer the highest Perfected Ones, one part to offer the good causes and conditions. The principle of fruit and recompense is also like being and non-being; in being and non-being there is truth; from this it is made.’

The Perfected Ones say the three parts are: one to the fasting officials, one to the offering of dharma masters, one to the offering to the masters and ancestors every year or three years; if the two masters are not present, hand over to the record masters, transmitting according to the three heavens’ dharma; thus it is.

The title of Perfected One has its rites and forms, still far from the Way above; it is divine power and freedom, no longer retrogressing, commanding ghosts and employing spirits, yet still active, diligently working great功, entering subtly through kalpas, gradually arriving at the Way above; all such have counterparts. In former kalpas those who studied the Way and became true were not easy to seek; rare as life’s causes and conditions, bound to the nether world, naturally not forgotten, suddenly lax and tested, falling yet again into the five ways, never returning. Understand my words; I have received the Heavenly Venerable’s teaching and command, in later kalpas to be the parent of sentient beings, teaching the children to grow, avoiding evil men; diligently consider my words.

The cycle of response and opening of the kalpa, only the Heavenly Master appears in the world; he is the One, not born from the saints; scriptures and precepts have no large or small, no before or after, no high or low, all are one; they have qualities, sections, and volumes; saints each have their work, for the sake of sentient beings. Not two not three, like my body; students who can understand well, the ancient pattern of the mysterious capital, the thirty-one scrolls of Yuqing, the thirty-six scrolls of Ziwei, the three scrolls of Taiji, their sections and parts all have alliances, having alliances as precious bodies to protect their breath. Death arises from within, not from without; since arising from within, outside there is response; response brings great calamities. Inside firmly not moving nor shining, clear and tranquil in spirit; it is said the silent spirit dwells in itself.  
Hence it is said: ‘To learn above is non-action; non-action is breath governed; to learn below is action; action means body and mind work together. When working together, old bonds are broken and scattered; gradually arriving at breath governance; not the silent spirit; sins once destroyed, spirit is naturally still; spirit still means long vision;功 not yet full, silent spirit also not established; must suffer toil and pain of the body, to save all things, not weary in suffering.’  
‘The king is distressed; recite this scripture; the ruler is not peaceful; recite this scripture; epidemic poisons prevail; recite this scripture; people die of illness; recite this scripture; sun and moon lose their darkness; recite this scripture; stars err in their courses; recite this scripture; great kalpa’s cycle ends; recite this scripture; winds and rains come not in season; recite this scripture; teachers and friends fall ill; recite this scripture; households come to end; recite this scripture; five grains fail to mature; recite this scripture; robbers and thieves abound; recite this scripture; sentient beings curse each other; recite this scripture; study declines and is unsteady; recite this scripture; cursing and anger; recite this scripture; heavenly fasting days; recite this scripture.’  
‘Practising fasting and reciting scripture, the voice penetrates the great void, the sound descending and rising, causing Brahma sounds, subtle Brahma sounds, touching the saints, demon kings respectfully bowing, all Perfected Ones praising, having such功, above equal to the heavenly true’s virtue, gradually entering spiritual concentration. The thirty-two marks arise naturally and completely: blue hair grows long, the nape shines purple, eyebrows shaped like the moon, ears listening darkly, eyes bright and clear, nose cold and moist, mouth square and round, teeth moist and firm, white and clean as silver, numbering forty, fine and even, tongue moistening springs, drawing moon essence, saliva palace fluid, throat high and firm, pillars strong and firm, hands soft and grasping, holding inside and outside, feet strong and powerful, stepping the mysterious void, heart upright and calm, subduing demon kings, liver shining bright, entering Mount Tai, lung breath white, wearing Hua Yin, kidney exerting power, observing Mount Heng, spleen receiving breath, peaceful Song Gao, gallbladder powerful voice, vibrating spiritual sounds, chanting penetrating the subtle, entering the unbroken, all these are gained by study, not by nature.’
