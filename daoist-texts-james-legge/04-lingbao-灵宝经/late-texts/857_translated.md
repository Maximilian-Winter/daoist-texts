The Wondrous Scripture of the Merits and Causes of the Ten Titles of the Most High Cavernous Mysterious Spirit Treasure

The Most High Great Way Lord, together with the Five Old Emperors, the Limitless Flying Heavenly Great Sage, the Supreme High Perfected, the Ten Ultimate Perfected, Left Mysterious Perfected, Right Mysterious Perfected, Wondrous Conduct Perfected, Universal Aid Perfected, Mandate Bestowing Perfected, Calamity Relieving Perfected, Suffering Rescuing Perfected, the Great Compassionate and Great Merciful Perfected, the Great Compassionate and Great Wise Perfected, the Orthodox One Emperor Lord, the various Great Celestial Masters, the Vajra Spirit Kings, the Powerful Ones, the Heavenly Dragons, and the Ghost Spirits, in the World Abandoned by Worthies, by their spiritual powers instantly transformed countless red jade beds and seats, shining bright and clear; the host of True and Holy Ones were arranged upon them.

At that time the Way Lord ascended the seat of the Lion made of Seven Treasures, which was adorned with mixed treasures of coloured glaze, pearls, fire pearls, moon pearls, coral brain, coral, amber, red jade, white jade, turquoise, green jade, yellow jade, glass, gold, purple gold, blue fire gold, fragrant sandalwood, richly decorated thereon. On this seat there naturally grew a lotus of a hundred treasures, with layers numbering one hundred thousand; upon each lotus leaf appeared the pure lands of the ten directions, all complete. In the assembly was a great forest of seven treasures, its fine leaves closely intertwined, its fragrance thick and bound, vast and lofty beyond measure; when the wind moved it was harmonious and elegant, emitting subtle melodies. Among it naturally appeared various heavenly music, sounding without drum or lute. Then the Way Lord on the lotus throne, standing upright, emitted from his body five-coloured light, illuminating boundless heavenly realms. The holy assembly in the air walked through the void circling and singing praises and laudations; immediately heavenly rain of fragrant flowers, wondrous true flowers both great and small, red golden flame flowers, purple golden flame flowers, phoenix-headed fire flowers, fragrant fire flowers rained down. Wondrous garments, precious fruits, white cranes, phoenixes, auspicious parrots, azure luan, peacocks, great good golden birds, radiant golden birds, reciting golden birds, musical golden birds—all carried different flowers in their beaks, flying about the assembly. Then there appeared the immortals, flying immortals, heavenly immortals, earthly immortals, water immortals, fire immortals, the immortals of the Five Sacred Mountains, and all the great immortals of the large and small Caverns of Heaven, each holding talismans and banners, canopy covers and precious standards, singing and praising, chanting spiritual verses, performing wondrous music, offering homage to the Way Lord. At once the great earth trembled, the assembly looked at each other, marvels beyond measure appeared.

There was a Perfected One named Universal Aid who stepped forth from the crowd, arranged his clothes and headwear, and with composed and dignified steps approached the Way Lord. Bowing and touching his head to the ground, he spoke to the Way Lord: "Lowly servant is ignorant, unable to fathom what Way fruit the Lord cultivates, but I see this is spiritual power and freedom, no different from the Primordial Heavenly Venerable. Humbly I beseech compassion for me and all future sentient beings, and pity for later students of the Way, that this principle may be expounded, so that they may comprehend the profound essentials of the Law, ascend the Most High Way, and attain the fruit hard to imagine—lowly servant’s great fortune."

The Way Lord heard Universal Aid’s words and sighed, saying: "Good! Good! Thou hast great original wisdom, able to suppress or raise the wondrous Law for sentient beings in future turbid kalpas. Keep this in mind, and I will tell thee this cause and effect. For countless eons I have thought on my original master, the Primordial Heavenly Venerable’s ten titles and their merits, praised and chanted them, cast and inscribed diagrams, contemplated the Primordial Heavenly Venerable, worshipped, made offerings with reverence, bestowed countless pearls and gold without stinginess; up to this day, without one thought of neglect, and thereby accomplished these merits."

Universal Aid again spoke to the Way Lord: "I have not yet clearly heard the ten titles of the Primordial Great Sage Heavenly Venerable. May lowly servant and all present hear them? I wish to praise and sing with the host of True Immortals." When he had spoken, he prostrated and touched his head to the ground with tearful sadness, looking up to the Way Lord. The entire assembly silently meditated, gazed upon the true countenance, and hoped for the expounding of the Law.

The Way Lord smiled slightly and said to Universal Aid: "Thou mayst concentrate thy thoughts on hearing, and attain the fruit of the Most High Way. I further tell thee: My original master, the Great Sage Primordial Heavenly Venerable, is void and natural, the wondrous way incarnate. From eras uncounted, surpassing name and speech, dust and sand kalpas, he has saved all sentient beings, entered the Most High Way, possessing seventy-two marks, and eighty-one excellences, ten titles complete. Sometimes appearing with myriad radiant forms, sometimes with boundless forms, sometimes with great body, sometimes with small body, sometimes transforming into millet grains. Sometimes opening hair pores to receive boundless worlds; sometimes holding the three thousand great thousand worlds; sometimes raining sweet dew to sprinkle hot and afflicted sentient beings; sometimes acting as emperor to subdue rebellion; sometimes as virtuous aide to uphold the Way; sometimes descending as a holy sovereign to be master. Such are the merits, spiritual powers, and wondrous appearances none can exhaust in praise. There are ten titles comprising the general praise: these are Most High Way, Primordial, Supreme Ultimate, High Sovereign, Radiance, Jade Emperor, Orthodox Dharma King, Great Compassionate Father, Immortal True Master, Heavenly Venerable."

Universal Aid again said to the Way Lord: "Though I have heard the merits of the ten titles, I have not yet examined their explanation, so that I and the great assembly, even sentient beings in future turbid kalpas, may be made to understand the most true essentials of the Law. Humbly I beseech compassion to reveal and declare one by one the wondrous merits, practices, and manifestations of the ten titles; lowly servant’s great fortune."

The Way Lord replied to Universal Aid: "The ten titles spoken of are those by the host of True and Holy Celestial Beings and Heavenly Perfected Sovereigns who open the hundred-treasured caskets in the White Jade Palace of the Red Bright and Harmonious Yang Heaven, unroll the silken brocade, translate the great Brahman secret speech, and set forth the correct sounds. The Most High Way is the fruit of the Primordial Heavenly Venerable when his Way was complete; among all dharmas without ancestor, lineage, root, or connection, a single mark suddenly arose, upon which all dharmas depend; he is the King of all dharmas, the ancestor of all forms, the origin of one qi, void and unfathomable, deep and boundless, dwelling before all multitudes; thus named Most High Way. Primordial denotes dwelling at the source of the Ultimate Way, making the dark abyssal root; thus called Primordial. Supreme Ultimate comes from countless eons, when the simple was divided and the retribution body appeared; then he began to appear in the azure sky as a transforming body, thus named Supreme Ultimate. High Sovereign is the title of him who resides in the boundless sky, roaming above the Great Luo, named Most High above Most High, transcending all phenomena; thus named High Sovereign. Radiance denotes the true essence of Dharma-nature, bright as glaze, transmitting merit and light, illuminating dark places, dispelling the obstructions of sentient beings, breaking the mountain of vexations; thus named Radiance. Jade Emperor dwells in the Jade Palace, revered as emperor of myriad heavens, solid and true nature, wondrous appearance complete, majestic and vast, standing among True Ones as the stars circle the moon; thus called Jade Emperor. Orthodox Dharma King expounds the orthodox Dharma, destroys deviant and heterodox sects, opens the Way of Non-action, extinguishes all suffering, clarifies boundless Dharma gates, seals and confirms the three heaven scriptures and talismans, subdues demons and devils, removes petty views, and leads into the Great Vehicle Way; like a great physician king, the Dharma-medicine cures suffering, like a spring thunder shaking the sprouts and buds, fostering growth and life, like sprinkling sweet dew rain watering all root natures; thus named Orthodox Dharma King. Great Compassionate Father has, from incalculable and boundless kalpas, from dust and sand kalpas impossible to measure, appeared in the great sage body, saved sentient beings, freed them from the net of birth and death, entered the true orthodox Way, sometimes saving beings in evil realms, rescuing the guilty and suffering, surpassing even newborn babes; thus named Great Compassionate Father.

Regarding the Immortal True Master, the Way Lord told Universal Aid: "From boundless and immeasurable kalpas, the Heavenly Venerable Great Sage, many True Great Immortals, having attained the Most High Way fruit, all Heavenly Venerables, True and Holy Beings, Heavenly Kings and Emperors, Jade Emperors and Great Emperors, Three Flower Emperors, Five Emperors and Great Demons, residing in famous mountains, cavernous abodes, space, water and land, all sentient beings, those who have attained fruit, those now attaining fruit, and those not yet attaining fruit, all are my original master, the Primordial Heavenly Venerable, manifesting void original dharma body, natural retribution body, primordial transforming body; by true and real Law leading and instructing, expounding the thirty-six divisions of revered scriptures. Sometimes in forests and springs, famous mountains and great peaks, sometimes in great caverns of heaven or small caverns of heaven, sometimes among the thirty-six heavens, sometimes in the thirty-two imperial palaces, sometimes in the Three Pure Great Luo and boundless realms, sometimes in other lands, and in all clusters of sentient beings, having form and appearance, thus variously, according to root capacity they watch speech and language, transforming and guiding. Those not yet opened to liberation, vow to open them; those not yet attaining the Way, vow to cause them to attain; those not yet at peace, vow to bring peace; those not yet liberated, vow to cause liberation; those not yet elevated to mystery, vow to lead them upward. By these great vows they open and lead all, expound the essentials of the Three Caverns, the great treasury wondrous texts, heavenly books jade characters, golden treasure secret chapters, all complete. Transmitting various Laws, though boundless, I collect and circulate them. Twelve matters and divisions, according to root differences, cause all sentient beings to return singly to one purpose and attain the comprehension of orthodox Law. These are: (1) this text; (2) spirit talismans; (3) precious formulas; (4) spirit diagrams; (5) registers and talismans; (6) precepts and rules; (7) dignified conduct; (8) methods; (9) guarded arts; (10) records and transmissions; (11) praises and chants; (12) memorials and tables. Fully furnished with such wisdom, opening such gateways of the Law, leading, transforming, and receiving sentient beings of turbid kalpas, regarding them as sons. The sons themselves not understanding, though spreading great compassion thus, setting nets of pity, sentient beings love sound and colour, various attachments, and wander in the three realms, not returning to the orthodox Way but holding to false views. When they meet the Heavenly Venerable’s transforming inducements to the true Law, all open their understanding, and from kalpa to kalpa tirelessly save suffering; thus named Immortal True Master."

Universal Aid spoke to the Way Lord: "I have not yet clearly understood the twelve divisions of matters, wondrous principles and essential Laws; what are their appearances and transformations? Like great Law rain filling containers, changing and moving with the root natures of sentient beings. Lowly servant has not comprehended the subtle principles; pray explain the two awakenings and enlightenment, lowly servant’s great fortune."

The Way Lord said to Universal Aid: "The first, this text, is the heavenly book of the eight meetings, phoenix seal and dragon script, the root of heaven and earth and all things, enlightening men and spirits, establishing all Laws, summoning the nine heavens’ gods, immortals, and emperors, arranging diagrams and talismans, regulating the celestial pivot, controlling Fengdu, subduing demons and ghosts, commanding the Water Emperor, summoning dragons to stop clouds, heaven and earth’s kalpa periods, holy true names, governing the platform city, the holy realms, widely declaring and distinguishing, all differences, controlling and transforming the original essence into form, all expounded in mysterious and wondrous clarity and completeness. The second, spirit talismans, are texts in cloud seal script, faith of gods and true ones, summoning and restraining all demons, mighty control of gods and ghosts, governing qi and movement, preserving life and extending years. The third, precious formulas, are the heavenly true highest saints explaining the heavenly book of the eight meetings’ characters, as correct sounds, opening the view of the Great Way. The fourth, spirit diagrams, are traces of the various saints’ transformations, appearing boundlessly, diagrams describing transformations, causing things to understand. The fifth, registers and talismans, are the saints recording names of immortals and true ones, ancestral origins and descendants, divine officials and ranks. The sixth, precepts and rules, are ordinances, commands and controls, preventing errors and examining faults, explaining and measuring sins and merits, distinguishing light and heavy. The seventh, dignified conduct, shows fasting, advancing and retreating models, bowing and looking up, proper order and bearing. The eighth, methods, are the saints’ writings on elixirs and secret essentials, divine herbs and lingzhi, soft gold, water and jade, the way of cultivation. The ninth, guarded arts, distinguishes discerning the spirit, preserving true thought of the Way, mind fasting and empty forgetting, roaming the void and flying steps, consuming and inhaling six qi, leading out the three lights, refining substance and transforming form, the Way of Immortal passage. The tenth, recorders, are the saints recording studies, attainment of the Way and realization of truth, penetrating the mysterious and entering the wondrous, cultivating causes and methods, certifying fruits and seasons. The eleventh, praises and chants, are the true great saints skillfully composing Dharma words, extolling the orthodox Way, causing things to believe and rejoice, arousing dedication and turning, producing reverence of mind. The twelfth, memorials and tables, are masters, disciples, transmissions, wondrous treasures and marvels, the three origins and eight sections, altar ascendings and covenant announcements, opening oaths and transmissions, repentance, thanks and petitions for blessings, words of closure and notification. These twelve divisions fully manifest orthodox Way, all intentions and aims, none lacking. Transforming and leading the three vehicles, certifying the Most High Way. My Great Sage original master, named Heavenly Venerable, dwells always above the Three Pure Ones, transcending the path realms of all saints, revealing the world low and humble, alone residing in heaven as most revered; thus named Heavenly Venerable. This is the wondrous essence of the ten titles and merits of the Primordial Heavenly Venerable’s Law gateway."

The Way Lord further told Universal Aid: "If there be sentient beings of future turbid kalpas who hear my original master the Great Sage Primordial Heavenly Venerable’s ten titles and their causes and merits, and are able to plan, cast images, sing praises and laudations, worship and reverence, and expound this Law, such persons will be born among the nine ancestors in heaven, with past karma extinguished, their bodies attaining the Way of long life and deathlessness. Their households will be peaceful and secure, their descendants prosperous, in every generation meeting the Way, never encountering calamity or adversity. If any one writes and cultivates this scripture, merits will be boundless. After explaining these ten titles and merits, all in the assembly will ascend and advance in immortal ranks, be elevated to holy stations, all comprehending the supreme orthodox true Way fruit. Perfected Universal Aid attained the celestial honour, named Hearer of Cries and Rescuer from Suffering Heavenly Venerable, possessing eighty-one excellences and seventy-two marks, ten titles complete, luminous and clear. In the air praises were heard from Universal Aid, thus entreating merits, inconceivable and unfathomable wisdom. In future worlds, among all sentient beings, he will be king of teachers of the Way, great eye of the great Law, no different from the Way Lord in spiritual power. Then all future sentient beings hearing these Law essentials will leave birth and death suffering and comprehend the orthodox true Way. Then Universal Aid receiving the Way Lord’s spiritual power desired to ascend the three heavens, and composed this hymn:

The Way Lord is greatly compassionate and merciful,  
With golden mouth expounding the true treasury.  
Now hearing the ten titles,  
Cause me to attain the true Way.  
I bow to the Unconditioned Master,  
Possessing the complete marks of a thousand rays.
