The Most High Cavernous Profound Spiritual Treasure All-Heavenly Spirits' Scripture of Fate Delivery and Wondrous Teachings

At the time of the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, he was seated in the Great Hall of Great Blessings within the Land of Chang Le, together with the great hosts of Holy Ones of the heavens, the Flying Heavenly Kings. They sat amidst seven-coloured precious clouds. At that moment, the Primordial One said to the Most High Dao Lord: "Have you heard the sound of lamentation and weeping in the lands of the Ten Directions within the Great Hall of Great Blessings?" The Dao Lord bowed his head and respectfully replied to the Heavenly Worthy: "I have entered this realm for seven million five hundred thousand kalpas, and have not heard the sound of lament or sighing in this land; I am uncertain of the reason." The Heavenly Worthy further inquired: "Have you heard sounds of strings and songs, of joyous music?" The Dao Lord bowed and answered: "Herein the men and women, from the time their eyes first beheld this land, for seven million five hundred thousand kalpas, have not perceived decay in their forms; whether man or woman, all bear the same visage. Thus they receive birth, dwell within blessings, ever without sorrow or grief, delighting only in joy." Then the Primordial Heavenly Worthy smilingly emitted five-coloured radiance from his mouth, illuminating a nation's territory. The Spiritual Treasure True Text shone brilliantly within the light, its script clear and resplendent, radiating and reflecting brightly in all the four directions. The Dao Lord knelt long, bowed his head in reverence, and wished to hear the essential meaning thereof.

The Primordial Heavenly Worthy replied: "Do you see the True Text within the radiance? This scripture issued in the era of Long Han from this land. At that time, together with the Highest and Most High Holy Jade Emperor, ten wondrous scriptures were composed to deliver and guide men, and hence this land was named the Great Hall of Great Blessings, the abode of Chang Le. Its sacred sounds resounded with power, benefitting the Ten Directions. Therefore the men and women of this land live long lives, without premature death, do not endure various sufferings, nor tread the path of worries and vexations; they fall not into the three wicked paths, nor pass through the eight gates of calamity; no sound of lamentation or weeping arises, only the sound of joy. Those born in this world who meet this scripture and Dao are truly of countless kalpas' predestined connection, a fate without affliction—how can they not rejoice? The reason I once smiled without cause was because the people of this land know not whence their joy springs, nor do they know that in other lands there is sorrow and grief. After I depart, the True Text will be hidden, the cycle of deliverance will quicken, the five turbidities will contend, myriad evils will arise. Those born then will be born into it, willingly bearing guilt, wandering through the Five Paths, enduring prolonged sufferings and the eight calamities, mutually harming one another, afflicted with sorrow and vexation to their very selves, without seeing the scriptures nor encountering the holy texts; they will be subject to the fate of life and death—it is truly pitiable. I deeply pity these, who do not know their former karmic calamities and whence they come. Now I shall explain to the future births the ten wondrous scriptures, to deliver men and heavenly beings. You must diligently apply your mind and with rectified intention receive this; suddenly forget these words."

Thereupon the Most High Great Dao Lord arose, bowed his head in obeisance, and humbly received the mandate. At that time all the saints rejoiced without exception. The Primordial Heavenly Worthy in the abode of Chang Le expounded the Spiritual Treasure True Text, issuing methods to deliver men, beginning with this land. At that time, the true great saints of the boundless worlds of the Ten Directions, the flying heavenly kings, and wondrously active perfected persons, countless in number, assembled together simultaneously. The land was all molten gold poured into the earth; the stairways on the four sides were adorned with blue jade and lapis lazuli treasures, arranged uniformly all around, the radiance shining through. The Dao and the Law unfolded widely, delivering men without limit. Hence this land was named the Great Hall of Great Blessings. Those born here had destinies without mutilation, hearts without vexation, bodies without worry; they followed their desires, and when their fate was fulfilled they obtained deliverance into the Vermilion Tomb. At that time the men and women, with mindful hearts, all attained delivery from the world. At that time the Great Hall of Great Blessings' country was perfected; the Dao journeyed to the eastern extremity of the Azure Sky, the Great Floating Li Country.

The Primordial Heavenly Worthy, seated upon the Azure Mist in the Great Floating Li Country of the Azure Sky, was then approached by the boundless hosts of great saints of the eastern limit, flying heavenly kings, supremely true great gods, An Bao Hua Lin Qing Ling Elder, the Cang Emperor of the Nine Qi Heavenly Lords, the Most High True Kings, the green-belted jade maidens, and the spiritual officials of the eastern region, countless in number, assembled together at once. The land was level and even, without height or depth; the earth was all turquoise jade, with stairways on the four sides adorned with gold, silver, and precious jewels, arranged uniformly, the brightness brilliant and clear.

Then the Primordial Heavenly Worthy said to the Cang Emperor Lord: "Is this land one of immortal cultivation? What wondrous method is there? Do you know the karmic causes and conditions of fate?" The Cang Emperor Lord bowed his head and respectfully replied: "Since entering this realm for nine million nine hundred thousand kalpas, there have been initially no persons who cultivate immortality; all are naturally undying. This land has various marvels: there are blue forest trees whose leaves naturally bear purple writings. When the wind blows and the trees move, their sounds form cavernous inscriptions; the spiritual sounds shine brilliantly and resound through the great void. Above them always dwell nine-coloured phoenix birds. When these birds sing, all the men and women of the land bow and offer reverence to the sound. When the bird drops a feather, whoever obtains it is able to fly. The men and women of this land have no decay or aging, no sorrow or grief; they do not endure bitterness or poison, nor do they pass through anxious vexations; they live only in joy, not knowing whence their causes and conditions come. Those born in this age truly are of former karmic cause."

The Primordial Heavenly Worthy told the Cang Emperor Lord: "In the former Long Han era, the Spiritual Treasure True Text was issued in this land to deliver men. The Highest Holy Jade Emperor at that time composed wondrous scriptures and wrote them with purple brush upon the blue skies of the forest. Hence when the wind blows through this tree, the sound forms music. The nine-coloured birds always eat the leaves, their bodies bearing inscriptions; therefore those who obtain their feathers are able to fly. At that time, all attained the true Dao. After I depart, the cycle of deliverance will quicken; wars and disasters will follow one upon another, heaven and man will be devastated. Men will willingly bear guilt, wandering through the Five Paths and Eight Calamities, not meeting this life nor seeing the scriptures and teachings; great suffering will follow. Now I speak this scripture, that the men and women of this land may know whence the years of undying come, opening the root of deliverance for future births. You must diligently apply your mind and truthfully understand my words." The Cang Emperor Lord bowed and humbly received the mandate. The assembly of saints all rejoiced. At that time the Great Floating Li Country of the Azure Sky was perfected; the Dao journeyed to the southern extremity, the Red Bright Country of the Southern Limit, the Southern Garden of Dan Huo, the Three Primal Caverns.

The Primordial Heavenly Worthy, seated upon the Crimson Cloud in the Red Bright Country of the Chan Li World, was then surrounded by the boundless hosts of great saints of the southern limit, flying heavenly kings, supremely true great gods, the Fan Treasure Chang Yang Dan Ling Elder, the Red Emperor of the Three Qi Heavenly Lords, the Three Qi Lord, the Vermilion Palace Great Dan Jade Maidens, and the spiritual officials of the southern region, countless in number, assembled together at the Three Primal Cavern of Dan Huo. The land was all coloured like cinnabar, forever producing red qi, like crimson clouds. The stairways on the four sides were all lapis lazuli and precious ornaments, shining brilliantly, illuminating the entire land.

At that time the Primordial Heavenly Worthy asked the Red Emperor of the Three Qi Heavenly Lords: "What is the lifespan of the people of this land?" The Three Qi Heavenly Lord bowed and answered: "Since residing in this realm for three million three hundred thousand kalpas, we have not heard the sound of sorrow or lamentation in this land; only the sight of those who do not age." The Heavenly Worthy again asked: "What wondrous method causes this?" The Three Qi Heavenly Lord bowed and answered: "This land has a court of cavernous intestines and a pool of fire refinement. The people thrice yearly visit the fire pool, refining themselves with fire essence, polishing their forms. Therefore there are those who do not grow old. Above is the Southern Palace lord of fondness for life, who keeps the registers of human life, so there is no sound of lamenting corpses. They know not whence the origin is, only wishing the Heavenly Worthy to reveal what is unknown."

The Primordial Heavenly Worthy said: "The reason this land has the Court of Unity of Cavernous Yang and the pool of flowing fire is because when the Spiritual Treasure True Text was first opened, the script was not yet clear. At that time, together with the Highest and Most High Holy Jade Emperor, I was also in this land, refining the True Text with fire, making the characters clear and shining with splendor, illuminating the five directions. Hence this land was named the Red Bright Country. The fire essence flowing in the bay formed the Court of Cavernous Yang; thus men and women undergo fire refinement in the fire court to attain non-decay. The people of this court all owe their merit to the True Text. The method is wondrous and weighty; above is placed the Southern Palace lord of fondness for life, who manages the registers of life and death, refining those who die and delivering those who live. Therefore in this land there is no sound of lamentation. Those born in this age are truly joyful! After I depart, the True Scriptures will be hidden; the cycle of heaven will quicken; the five turbidities will contend fiercely; poison will flow among heaven and man; men and women will be destroyed. Willingly bearing guilt, wandering through the Five Paths and Eight Calamities, they will not see the bright teaching nor encounter the True Scriptures. Therefore I now expound this wondrous scripture, granting you the True Text, so that the men and women of this land may know whence the immortals and long-living deities come, opening the causes and conditions of deliverance for the men and women of the renewed world. Apply your mind diligently and do not forget my words." The Red Emperor of the Three Qi Heavenly Lords bowed and humbly received the mandate. Then the assembly of saints made obeisance and departed. At that time the Red Bright Jade Country of the Chan Li World was perfected; the Dao journeyed to the western extremity. The Western Extreme Great Blessings Hall World of Wei Na Jade Country.

The Primordial Heavenly Worthy in the Great Blessings Hall World of Wei Na Jade Country, seated beneath the Yu Cha Mountain's Floating Luo Peak, beneath the seven precious soaring trees, was surrounded by the boundless hosts of the western limit, great saints, flying heavenly kings, supremely true great gods, the Seven Precious Golden Gate Hao Ling Elder, the White Emperor of the Seven Qi Heavenly Lords, the Bright Stone Seven Qi Lord, the Most High White Pure Jade Maidens, and the spiritual officials of the western region, countless in number, assembled together at the Floating Luo Peak. The land was all white jade as a carpet, with golden steps; all around were treasures, the brightness brilliant, illuminating the entire land. The country’s elegant music and wondrous sounds gathered gloriously; various marvels were present; the voices of forest trees and birds and beasts bore jade-like melodies; golden pools poured forth essence, delivering a nation’s people. This land was named the Supreme Bliss Country.

The Primordial Heavenly Worthy then asked the White Emperor Heavenly Lord: "Why is this land named Supreme Bliss Country? What wonder does the country have to be without sorrow and grief?" The White Emperor Heavenly Lord bowed and answered: "Since entering this realm for seven million kalpas, only elegant music of hundreds of harmonies has been heard; no voice of sorrow or grief among the country’s people. All men and women have faces resembling golden splendour. The forest contains seven precious soaring trees, producing red fruits with white rings. On them are phoenixes, peacocks, and golden-winged birds; day and night, six times daily, they utter elegant sounds. Lions and white deer sing and roar melodiously. There are golden essence and jade pools refining ointments; flying heavenly gods descend thrice yearly to bathe therein. The flowing essence and mysterious bays universally deliver without limit. Therefore this country is named Supreme Bliss. They know not whence the origin is, only wishing the Heavenly Worthy to reveal what is not yet understood."

The Heavenly Worthy said: "In the ancient Long Han era, together with the Primordial Heavenly King and the Highest Jade Emperor, I encountered the Spiritual Treasure True Text upon the Floating Luo Empty Mountain in this land. The phoenixes, peacocks, and golden-winged birds flew over its ridges. Suddenly, in a moment's space, five-coloured radiance shone forth, illuminating a land, revealing hiddenness and clarity together. I, upon the Empty Mountain, expounded the True Text, composed ten wondrous scriptures, beginning in this land to issue methods to deliver men, desiring that the sound of the Law might flow and transform future generations. The Law opened and blossomed. At that time, people and birds and beasts all received deliverance. Therefore, the flocks of birds constantly utter unusual elegant music; hearing their sounds, they naturally produce Daoist meanings, generate good hearts, perform good thoughts. The men and women of this land all attain true Dao. To be born in this land is to have from former seven hundred kalpas’ good repute recorded in the heavenly lands, causing birth in this country. The country has divine birds, who utter elegant sounds six times daily; it is named Supreme Bliss Country. To be born in this age is to have boundless blessings. After I depart, the True Scriptures will be hidden; the cycle of heaven will quicken; the country will be destroyed; future births will be overwhelmed; they will not meet the scriptures and teachings; they will wander in the five sufferings and eight calamities; men and women’s lives will be cut short; the suffering will be great. Therefore I now expound this scripture, that the people of this land may know the root of former karmic cause, opening the crossing of deliverance for future births. Understand my words clearly and diligently apply your mind." The Seven Qi Heavenly Lord bowed and accepted the mandate. At that time, the Great Blessings Hall World of Wei Na Jade Country was perfected; the Dao journeyed to the northern extremity. The Northern Extreme Yuan Fu Qi Xian World, Yudan Country.

The Primordial Heavenly Worthy, upon the northern ridge of Yudan Country in the Yuan Fu Qi Xian World, sat on five-coloured mysterious clouds above the Northern Ridge Mysterious Hill. The boundless hosts of great saints of the northern limit, flying heavenly kings, supremely true great gods, the Five Qi Mysterious Heavenly Lords of the Cavernous Yin Shuo Dan Yu Jue Five Spirits, the Black Emperor Heavenly Lord, the Mysterious Nourishing Five Qi Heavenly Lord, the Most High Spiritual Lord, the Night Shining Jade Maiden, and the spiritual officials of the northern region, countless in number, assembled together on the Northern Ridge Mysterious Hill. The land was all condensed water essence, lapis lazuli poured on the earth and walked upon. The country had a sealed pool, five hundred li in length and breadth. The pool had flowing essence, jade mushrooms, and in its midst a natural cavernous spiritual pavilion. The pavilion was as high as the clouds, fifty li in diameter, all carved with golden inscriptions, inscribed on all four sides. The place was dark and obscure, without light on all sides, forever like the dark night, unseen by man. The men and women of the land drank water from the pool; their faces were like jade and fat; initially they had no sickness, no sorrow, and lived three ten-thousand years, without premature death. After death, their bones did not become dust; ten thousand years had no day of stench or decay. The land had no rites or music, only knowledge of upright hearts. This land was named the Land of No Suffering.

The Heavenly Worthy asked the Black Emperor Heavenly Lord: "Why is this land named the Land of No Suffering? What wondrous methods does the land possess?" The Black Emperor Heavenly Lord bowed and answered: "Since entering this realm for five million kalpas, each kalpa’s cycle reveals the spiritual pavilion, bright and clear; after the kalpa passes it becomes dark. Below the pavilion is a cold pool. The men and women all come to drink and eat; their faces are like jade, without signs of aging, knowing not sickness or pain; they live their years fully, and upon death their bodies do not decay. Hence the land is named the Land of No Suffering. The men and women of this land only know birth; they do not know whence it comes nor how they obtain such lifespan. They only wish the Heavenly Worthy to reveal what is not yet understood."

The Heavenly Worthy smilingly emitted five-coloured radiance from his mouth, illuminating a nation, the spiritual pavilion brightly seen, transparent on all sides, like the sun at its zenith. The city walls were resplendent with radiant colour, beyond description. The people of the nation rejoiced without limit. The Heavenly Worthy said: "The Spiritual Treasure True Text went to this land to issue methods to deliver men. I sealed the heavenly text within this pavilion, hence its name, the Spiritual Pavilion. Below the pavilion is the cold pool, all the outlets of spiritual crossings. Therefore the people drink the pool water and attain deathlessness. After I depart, this pavilion, scripture, and text will return to the boundless sky of Yudan. The cycle of heaven will hasten with myriad disasters; lives will be cut short, men and women injured; future births will be overwhelmed, not meeting the scriptures and teachings; wandering through five sufferings, which is unbearable to behold. Therefore now I expound this scripture, that the people of this land may know whence their causes and conditions come, opening the crossing of deliverance for future men and women. Those with good hearts, when granted the text, will obtain life, deliver from suffering amidst myriad disasters. Understand my words clearly, diligently receive and practice; do not be negligent or careless, lest you wrong future births." The Black Emperor Heavenly Lord bowed and accepted the mandate. In the nation, none were not joyful.

The Heavenly Worthy said to the Most High Dao Lord: "The Five Elder Emperor Lords and the Spiritual Treasure by their karmic connections have endured life and death through countless kalpas, meeting each lifetime, their teaching and transforming never ceasing. The True Text, having been given to the Five Elder Emperor Lords, each received one true scripture and wondrous secret, securing and calming the five directions. Hence their lands are filled with blessings and virtue, so that men and women have long lives without premature death, all obtain their years of life, see no worry or affliction, do not encounter sufferings, nor tread the eight calamities; their forms bear no decay, the land has no sound of lament, only the sound of wondrous elegant music. The joy of the land is transmitted kalpa after kalpa. Other countries and distant lands of the four directions, places where blessings and virtue do not reach, whether man or woman, do not see the scriptures and teachings, do not know former karmic fate, but are subject to the turnings of birth and death, wandering through the Five Paths without return. The absence of blessings is truly pitiable. Now I shall again widely open the teaching, universally delivering the heavens, that the men and women of these mixed border lands may all turn their hearts, enter my Law-gate, be taken out from all suffering and the eight calamities, behold all goodness, none failing to change their hearts. The Seven Ancestors shall receive their blessing and happiness, and all shall be born again among men. The blessings widely pervade; the whole world rejoices in heart."

The Heavenly Worthy perfected the lands of the five directions, delivered all men, all receiving the bright teaching. Each spontaneously aroused good mind and benevolent intention, cherished the great Law, did not violate the precepts, did not tread evil, did no unlawful actions, their bodies without a spot of defilement. Universally practicing compassion, reverently obeying the spirits, respecting the aged and loving the young, acting in accord with nature, obtaining long life, their forms without decay. The sound of the Law was widely spread, the heavens venerated it. In anticipation of these mixed border lands and distant domains of short-lived places where blessings do not reach, wherever the Way is heard, all obtain delivery from the world and long life; none do not leap joyfully. At that time men and women all came to submit and take refuge. The Heavenly Worthy then returned to the Chang Le abode; these mixed lands, great and small, all turned their lands and came in; it was impossible to forbid.

The Heavenly Worthy for three days and three nights closed the heavenly light, so that no light shone forth. He gathered firewood to a height of some two hundred zhang; the Heavenly Worthy sat upon the wood and burned himself with fire. The fire flamed and shone illuminating the four directions, brightening the various lands. Men and women from afar saw the Heavenly Worthy sitting upon the fire, without cause to approach and reveal their hearts. The Heavenly Worthy wished to observe their hearts, and thus told those who came: "If you desire longevity, enter the fire and receive my Law." Those who earnestly desired and admired the great Law, numbering seventy-two thousand four hundred and fifty persons, cast themselves into the fire, all attaining the Dao before me. The Heavenly Worthy immediately within the fire bestowed upon them the scriptures and Law; as they entered, so they were granted; their bodies all attained deliverance and they disappeared unseen. The remainder, numbering four hundred thousand, saw from afar those entering, saying their bodies could not come out, all said they burned to death, and so retreated and returned to their own lands. Those who entered the fire to receive delivery all first arrived home; those who did not enter came later. When they met again, they lamented and sighed, repenting to no avail. Those who received delivery all attained long life, bodies without suffering, forms without decay, their years all thirty thousand, ending in death. Those with good hearts diligently cultivated the scriptures and teachings, all attained deliverance from the world.

The Heavenly Worthy said to the Most High Dao Lord: "In the time of Long Han, I was the formless ever-existing Lord who came into the world to teach and transform. Then there was heaven and earth, sun and moon shining, the three luminaries complete. There was man and woman, birth and death; though there was yin and yang, there were no rites or ceremonies, nor the implements of the five tastes and clothing; chaos generated itself. I used the transformation of the Dao to gradually awaken awareness, to know conduct, benevolence and righteousness, turn the heart and trust; at that time the years of life were all long. Those who did not believe in the Law had short lives. After I depart, heaven and earth will be destroyed; within them there will be vast darkness; countless kalpas without light; above, no colour; below, no abyss. The wind, marsh, cavern and void, dark and obscure, formless and shadowless, boundless and infinite. Chaos without limit, called Yan Kang. When the Red Bright opened its light, heaven and earth returned to position; yin and yang began; people were complete and death and birth began. I again came into the world, called the Nameless Lord, using the Spiritual Treasure teaching to transform and deliver heaven and men. At that time men and women had utmost sincerity and admiration, revering the scriptures and precepts, not at all weary; all attained the true Dao; their bones and flesh all flew, moving naturally in the void. Although not yet attaining the Dao, all lived long lives; upon death they ascended to heaven, repeatedly reborn, the turning wheel unceasing; afterwards all attained immortality. After I depart, within one kalpa’s cycle, heaven and earth are again destroyed, light disappears. Within five kalpas, dark and obscure, three qi chaotic, born by the turning of fate. When the Kai Huang era arrived, the Spiritual Treasure True Text opened the three luminaries; heaven and earth returned to position; the five characters shone bright; sun, moon, stars, and constellations then shone clearly; the four seasons and five elements, yin and yang, were born. I, among the Primordial Blue Heaven, was called the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, opening and spreading the Law teaching, perfecting the heavens. Then there were people, men and women simple and honest, tying knots to walk, no rites and ceremonies, no five tastes, no clothes, no five colours, no writing; naked bodies sleeping exposed, mingling with birds and beasts. Using the Dao to open transformation, gradually hearts arose, knowing benevolence and righteousness; rites and music revived; clothing and food were provided; the five elements mixed; thus the teaching was proclaimed, the sound of the Law spread widely; scriptures and classics distributed; the foolish were exhorted and warned; hearts turned and trusted; gradually they entered the gate of the Law.

At that time the Heavenly Worthy went out to the western river's edge, sat upon the Weak Water, and emitted five-coloured radiance from his mouth, illuminating the heavens and the lands of the four directions, universally revealing light. The Heavenly Worthy divided his form into a million, everywhere appearing simultaneously. Men and women everywhere, all saw the Heavenly Worthy within the five-coloured light, as if all in one place; wherever they were, young and old, male and female, all went to bow. The Heavenly Worthy followed their lands; from his mouth he issued the five articles of the Spiritual Treasure True Text, its radiance dazzling beyond description. He expounded the ten wondrous scriptures, bestowed precepts and prohibitions. He declared to men and women that if anyone wished to obtain longevity, they should come to register, receiving cinnabar books and iron contracts, biting their arms and swearing blood oaths, pledging faith and devoted mind, receiving the Law and departing. At that time, from the borders of the four directions, men and women, old and young, none did not turn their hearts; each brought gold, silver, brocade and silk, five-coloured patterned silks, pearls and jade and precious treasures, countless beyond measure, coming to the Heavenly Worthy. They humbly received the precepts and revered the wondrous scriptures. For seven days and seven nights, the radiance shone brightly, and the four directions returned to normal. The nations’ precious faith filled an entire land. The Heavenly Worthy at once bestowed charity to the poor; the poor were satisfied; the rich lacked nothing; poor and rich were equal; no one bore resentment. The Heavenly Register recorded those with former good merit and reputation; all obtained delivery from the world, flying through the great void. Having entered the gate of the Law, all had long lives of thirty-six thousand years. In the first year of the Supreme Emperor, the forms of men and women of the heavens changed to simplicity and purity; hearts gradually grew lax and corrupt. Fearing decay and decline, the orthodox teaching was incomplete; therefore I constructed bodies and lands of nations, perfecting hearts. After I depart, within half a kalpa, future men and women’s hearts will be broken and corrupt, turning to suspicion and division, not believing the scriptures and teachings; jealousy and harm will arise; they will contend for victory; mutually attack; their words contradict their hearts; each makes their own law; they do not revere heaven and earth; they despise the divine; kill life, commit lust and improper worship; make prayers to evil spirits. These men and women will curse each other; lust will run wild; theft without cause; unwilling to accept their fate; self-inflicted harm; bodies entering evil paths; treading sufferings and calamities; their lives brief; sorrow and vexation from infancy; wandering through the three evil paths and five ways; self-born and self-dying; karmic calamities following one another; flesh and bone separated; truly heart-rending. Now I expound this scripture, to deliver those who can be delivered among future births; those with good hearts must clearly receive and listen; deeply remember my words." The Most High Dao Lord bowed and accepted the mandate.

The Heavenly Worthy said: "I have observed the heavens throughout countless kalpas until today. The great saints and great gods who have attained the Dao in the upper heavens, as well as the perfected ones of the heavens, the Three Pure Ones, the Nine Palaces, the Five Mountains and the flying immortals, all have without exception received delivery through the Spiritual Treasure, only becoming true immortals. Next, observing the Southern Hill Vermilion Palace and the Nine Spirit Blessing Halls, the heavens grant spirits their natural kitchen food; none are not supplied in the world by offerings to the Spiritual Treasure, practicing fasting and precepts, naturally generating good hearts and performing good deeds; attaining deliverance and ascending to the blessed halls, receiving heavenly kitchen food. This scripture is esteemed and wondrous; delivering men without number. At the turning of the great kalpa, when heaven collapses and earth sinks, the four seas darken and join, gold and jade vanish, myriad paths end, this scripture alone remains; its Law does not cease. All other miscellaneous methods, guiding and nourishing arts, transformations of formulas, and scattered common customs, all pertain to the six heavens and desire realm; encountering a small kalpa, their methods vanish without remainder. The miscellaneous transformation talismans of the Supreme Clarity, the Great Peace Daoist Scripture, miscellaneous Daoist arts, and small scripture collections, all revolve within the eighteen heavens above and below, within the form realm. At the turning of the great kalpa, heaven and earth change their degrees; their texts vanish without remainder. The highest clarity of the upper Dao, the three caverns of spirit scripture, the spirit true tiger texts, golden script and jade letters, the Spiritual Treasure True Scriptures, all issued from the Primordial One, located above the twenty-eight heavens, the formless. At the time of the great kalpa’s turning, their texts return to the supreme Great Luo within the Jade Capital Mountain’s seven precious mysterious platform, where disasters cannot reach. The Great Luo heaven is above five hundred million five thousand five hundred and fifty-five heavens. Therefore the Great Cavern True Scriptures, the Spiritual Treasure Cavernous Profound, the Cavernous Void and Cavernous Nonexistence, are natural texts, perishing and arising with the cosmic cycle, encompassing myriad scriptures, the sect of the heavens. Those earnest and long-practising attain immortals, longevity, and deliverance of the world; flying in the broad daylight, riding dragon chariots, entering the void and nothingness. Those who can uphold them and offer reverence, the Seven Ancestors ascend to heaven, the turning wheel holy kings, unceasing generation, linked with good causes and conditions.

The Heavenly Worthy said: "These four chapters are the wondrous products of the four heavenly emperor kings for delivering fate; the four heavenly highest saints, perfected persons and jade maidens constantly chant them, retaining spirit and securing qi, harmonizing form and soul, elegant and wondrous sounds, wisdom penetrating the void. Therefore those upright and correct of the four directions receive the sound of the Law, naturally attain the true Dao, have long lives; on the day their fate passes, they ascend directly to heaven, ceaseless generation, turning wheel holy kings. Their way is lofty and wondrous, the most revered of all scriptures, nurturing life and protecting death, the great vehicle of the Law. Future-born men and women’s hearts and fate differ greatly from present births’ simple and sincere faithfulness. They constantly harbor suspicion and division, striving and contending, harming one another, injuring their years of life, not speaking of their own evil conduct, all saying the scriptures and teachings have no divinity. After I depart, the scriptures and Dao will return to the Great Luo Heaven above the Three Realms. Examining their hearts from afar, among them will be those who can be delivered. You diligently proclaim and transform, that those with hearts may hear the Law, deliver from the root of suffering and vexation, seeing light and good causes and conditions. Those who do not believe turn themselves to destruction, wandering birth and death, drifting through the Five Paths, without time of liberation. How diligent am I, therefore I repeatedly warn you, unable to bear to see future births foolish and pitiful. Therefore I leave bright precepts; diligently practice and do not be lax. The Most High Dao Lord, the great saints of the ten directions, the supremely true revered gods, all at once bowed their heads and received the mandate and departed.
