The True Man of the Supreme Ultimate’s Instructions on the Essential Rules and Rituals of the Lingbao Fasting and Vigilance

The True Man of the Supreme Ultimate said: As for the study of the way of the true immortals who ascend by day, all base their cultivation of virtue upon fasting and abstinence. The Lingbao Scripture possesses the great law: in the first, third, fifth, seventh, ninth, and eleventh months of the year, these are the six fasting months of the year. On the 1st, 8th, 14th, 15th, 18th, 23rd, 24th, 28th, 29th, and 30th days of the month, these are named the Ten Fasts of the Month. By prolonged fasting and deep contemplation, one aspires to the way of transcending the void. Therefore, the Lingbao Supreme Fast, revered by the august Old Heaven Lord and Great Sage, is constantly observed without weariness; how much more then should Daoist adepts and immortals not ardently yearn after it! Since antiquity the paramount matter in the path of immortality has been to invite and reverently observe the Supreme, to teach and unfold the codes of fasting, vigilance, and regulation in the form of concise instructions. This scripture is profound and subtle; disciple, quiet your heart and listen attentively.

The True Man of the Supreme Ultimate said: When entering the fasting hall, face eastward. Facing the incense burner, recite the following:

‘Supreme Lingbao Old Lord, summon the true officials, the merit officers and messengers, the left and right dragons and tigers, the bearers of incense; open the gates of the Supreme.

The Three Heavens, the Mysterious Origins, and the Great Way: we, your servants, now enter quietude, burning incense and facing the truths, seeking to obtain the Supreme’s correct qi from the ten directions, to enter into our bodies, so that when the gates are opened it may be heard directly before the jade throne of the True One, the Jade Emperor.’

Then kneel long, and strike the heavenly drum twenty-four times.

Carefully send forth from our bodies the five true officials, the merit officers; send forth from our bodies the supreme Three Heavens enforcers, who open and transform yin and yang, the merit officers; send forth the officials who cross the way to remove calamities, scatter misfortunes, and resolve hardships, twelve of each. Send forth the officials who govern the person, the chief officers who regulate and monitor, the great generals, the front, rear, and auxiliary officers, the courier station magistrate and assistant, the four regional supervisors and attendants. From within our bodies come forth the celestial spirits, commanding messengers, Zhengyi merit officers, healers, left and right officials and messengers, yin and yang spiritual decision officials, chariot attendants with red talisman, fierce wind cavalry officers, courier riders with dispatches, flying dragon cavalry officers, two each. Those sent forth are clad in solemn garments, wearing hats with hanging tassels, arrayed in their dignified regulation. The commanding merit officers wear the crown of Tongtian, clothed in black silk single garments; Zhengyi merit officers wear the vermilion sun headdress and red-embroidered single garments; the messengers wear the crown of Nine Virtues, five-colored longevity robes, belts with tiger tokens, holding jade tablets. The commanding merit officers stand at the four cardinal points; Zhengyi merit officers stand at the centre; healing merit officers camp about our bodies. The left official messenger holds the banner before, the right official messenger carries the standard behind; the yang spiritual decision officers stand to the left, the yin spiritual decision officers to the right. The upper merit officers gaze towards the heavens; the middle merit officers look towards the eight directions; the urging merit officers hasten the messengers of the officials from the ten directions, circling about our bodies. The attendants, tiger guards, inspectors of treachery and riders, chief attendants of the heavenly army, heavenly armored soldiers, heavenly strongmen, collectors of qi and food, collectors of spirits and ghosts, collectors of evils and poisons, executioners of talismans and breakers of temples, chariot attendants with red talisman, fierce wind cavalry officers, courier riders with dispatches, and flying dragon cavalry officers encamp before, behind, left and right of us. The merit officers and messengers, having solemnly completed their duties, arrange the records and seal the Lingbao officials, commanding the celestial overseers of fasting and all commanders. The Heavenly Masters distribute the twenty-four administrations, the thirty-six peaceful lodges, the seventy-two blessed places, the three hundred sixty-five famous mountains of Kunlun and so on; the upper palaces with their thirty-six thousand gods, the sun, moon, stars, constellations, the five emperors of heaven and earth, officials and commanders of the three realms, and so forth; and the two mysteries, three origins, four beginnings, and four facing directions with their winds and qi; the officials and commanders of the heavenly stems and earthly branches; the summons officials; the nine eastern barbarians with their Old Lords; the eight southern barbarians, Western six Rong tribes, Northern five Di and Qiang Old Lords; the central three Qin Old Lords; the Five Mountains and Four Rivers marshland lords; the gods of temples, the local mountains, rivers, valleys, forests, and the twelve stream maidens; the root origin and primordial Earth Lords and state protectors, all arrayed solemnly together with the merit officers and messengers within us; they open before the Supreme, the Limitless Great Way, the Supreme Great Way Sovereigns, the Supreme Old Lord, the Supreme Venerable Father, the Limitless Mysterious Elder; the ten directions limitless great ways; the Dao, Virtue, and the multitudes of holy heavenly Lords; the Supreme True Emperors, the Heavenly Emperors, Heavenly Masters, Lingbao fasting grand masters and officials. We, born and nurtured amidst demons and vulgarity, sinking in the last days, indulging in pleasures and honours, by fate and cause suddenly see the opening and are able to serve the Great Way. Not being of lowly fondness for pleasure, the way of true ascension to immortality, yet with deep accumulation of past sins, bound and unresolved. Now jointly we cultivate the Lingbao Supreme Fast, and beg to burn incense and turn the scriptures to seek our wishes. The merit officers and flying dragon cavalry officers separately report and seal according to time, ascending to the heights. When the sealing is complete, all return to dwell within us and again enter the palace chamber. Should summons be needed again, it proceeds as before. Then strike the heavenly drum three times.

The Celestial Elder said: This is called the ceremony of first establishing the fast and opening the matter. On this day, at the six hours of day and night, burn incense only facing the incense burner and recite the prayers, then bow.

The wonderful incense burner prayer is:

‘Incense officers and messengers, the left and right lords of dragon and tiger, the bearers of incense, cause the purified chamber and fasting hall to naturally generate golden liquid, cinnabar spores, and blue herbs, the hundred spirits gathering; before this incense burner let us attain the Way, thus obtain divinity and immortality, our entire households receiving blessing, the whole world receiving grace. The jade boys and jade maidens of the ten directions attend the incense smoke, transmitting and reporting our words directly before the Supreme Golden Tower and the Jade Emperor’s throne.’

Then at one time, the fasting leader kneels long, and the fasting master proclaims: ‘So-and-so, presiding as Sacrificial Wine Official, and I, so-and-so, now burn incense.’ Then, taking incense, burn it and utter wishes. Each time three incense burnings and three prayers.

The first incense burning wish is:

‘We burn incense, returning body, spirit, and life to the Great Way. We cast ourselves down, returning homage to the Supreme Three Honors. May the merit of this be dedicated to our seven generations of fathers and mothers, beseeching release from the ten sufferings and eight hardships, ascending to Heaven, with clothing and food natural, dwelling ever in non-action. Now we burn incense, returning ourselves to the Master, the Great Sage, the multitudes of Supremely True virtue. After attaining the Way, ascend into the formless, and unite with the Dao in truth.’

The Three Honors are the Dao Honor, the Scripture Honor, and the True Man Honor. These three united honors pass through the human person.

The second incense burning wish is:

‘We burn incense, returning body, spirit, and life to the Great Way. We cast ourselves down, returning homage to the Supreme Three Honors. May the merit of this be dedicated to the lineage of emperors, kings, lords, ministers, and subjects. We receive the Dao Law Masters, parents, fellow disciples, and all Daoist sages. May they be freed from the ten sufferings and eight hardships, each preserved in blessings, finally entering non-action. Now we burn incense, returning ourselves to the Master, the Great Sage, the multitudes of Supremely True virtue. After attaining the Way, ascend into the formless, and unite with the Dao in truth.’

The third incense burning wish is:

‘We burn incense, returning body, spirit, and life to the Great Way. We cast ourselves down, returning homage to the Supreme Three Honors. May the merit of this be dedicated to our own persons, that we may be made immortal, ascend into non-action, and unite with the virtue of the Four Great Elements. The people of the world, the creeping and flying worms, all living beings, be freed from the ten sufferings and eight hardships, the five poisons, water and fire, thieves, plagues, ghosts, and calamities. All preserved in blessings and happiness, dwelling peacefully in non-action. Now we burn incense, returning ourselves to the Master, the Great Sage, the multitudes of Supremely True virtue. After attaining the Way, ascend into the formless, and unite with the Dao in truth.’

This time of incense burning proceeds in order, with each person offering incense, selecting one of great virtue as fasting master, called the Dharma Master. It is not necessary for all to pray.

When the incense and prayers are complete, and the white incense has finished burning, the fasting person bows eastward and proclaims:

‘We now return homage to the Eastern Limitless Supreme Lingbao Heavenly Lord, beseeching that our wishes be granted as our hearts desire.’

Then facing south, then west, then north, then east again, then southeast, southwest, northwest, upward, and downward. These are called the ten-directional wishes, following the former method, three bows to each direction, or else one bow. Completed.

Facing due west, bow twice again and say:

‘We now return homage to the Western Great Sage multitudes of Supremely True Lords and Venerable Fathers who have attained the Way; may the wishes granted be complete.’

Then face north, then east, then south. Facing the scripture, thrice repeat the prayers as before. Completed. These all return towards the incense burner, taking the proper aspect of each direction. This is the Lingbao fasting rite to the ten directions, the Supreme Great Law profound and inscrutable. All should walk calmly and gracefully, carefully arranging order; men and women must not join together, that the dignity accords with heavenly precedents, so that ghosts and spirits may gaze upon it, flying immortals may sigh with admiration, and it may be the model of the three realms. Immortals cultivate this fast without cessation, how much more so the worthy! When the bowing ends, the fasting people proceed leftward in order, circling the incense burner thrice. At this time they should also chant the “Stepping Void, Treading Air, Unfolding the Void” scripture. The reason for circling the incense burner is that above is the model of the Mysterious Root, the Supreme Jade Cave of Heaven, the Great Luo Heaven where the Supreme Great Way Sovereign presides over the natural seven treasures platform; the Supreme True Men hold fast the fast and chant, circling the Supreme Seven Treasures platform—thus is the method of now.

Also, all disciples of the Three Caverns who cultivate the fast law must burn incense and chant, above symbolizing the assembly of True Men and Great Sage multitudes, circling the Supreme Dao Sovereign’s platform. Therefore those who seek the Supreme True Great Way may also circle the high seat of the Shangqing Lingbao Scripture. The reason for circling the incense burner is that those who now study are often superficial, unable to receive the Supreme Scripture. Hence the fasting method is shown, entrusting the heart to the incense smoke only. When the Way is practiced with utmost sincerity, the wishes sought will follow the incense smoke, already reaching the Supreme. The Supreme Dao Eye constantly and thoroughly surveys all people’s good and evil, with not a particle overlooked—how can one not be tremblingly cautious?

The Celestial Elder said: Always imagine seeing the Supreme True Man sitting upon the high seat, turning the scriptures and expounding the law.

Method of turning the scriptures

Set up a small bed, facing east, turning the scriptures as transmitted, arranging the Lingbao methods. The bed is five chi high, and five chi broad and long. Another method: the bed is four chi five cun high, and five chi broad and long. The quiet chamber should be neat to accommodate a refined room. This is the method for fasting days and temporary Way practice. If one desires prolonged fasting, long contemplation seeking the immortality Way, one must separately establish a fasting hall, surely making it quiet, pure, solemn, arranging scripture table and incense burner, placing a high seat within. Then face the high seat and worship the scriptures, making three bows, saying:

‘We now return homage to the Supreme Limitless Great Way, the Supremely True, the Supreme Thirty-Six Department Honored Scriptures and Talismans, the Supreme Three Honors. Now we burn incense and turn the scriptures, hoping to behold the Supreme’s grace in salvation. We beg for our seven generations of parents, as well as emperors, kings, and all people; all living beings, our bodies and households, that our past and present life’s birth and death, our great sins and errors, be forgiven. Whether slaying father or ruler, or being unfilial to parents, or betraying teachers and deceiving friends, or abandoning truth and embracing falsehood, or acting as robbers or aggressors upon family and country, or attacking other states, or killing living beings for pleasure, or committing adultery, mingling family lines, separating mothers and children, seizing what others love, or killing worthy persons and Daoists, or being a tyrant ruler, or a disloyal minister, disobeying superiors and oppressing inferiors, cruelly tyrannizing the people for personal glory, or kin slaying kin, or damaging the purification chamber and spirit altar, or stealing scriptures, or burning scriptures, or defiling the sacred texts, or ridiculing Dao and Virtue as nonsense, or laughing at those who do good, saying ‘I am myself’, or envying the virtuous and able, unwilling to be surpassed, or not revering the Way, disrespecting elders, neglecting the six illnesses, or insulting wind and cursing rain, and the heavens, earth, sun, moon, stars, emperors, kings, masters, Daoists, scorning the Four Greats, or cursing ghosts and spirits, calling them ignorant, or speaking falsely, deceiving oneself and shadow. All such great crimes cannot be recalled or reckoned, accumulating through generations, entwined and unresolved, grievances never ceasing. Now we burn incense and practice the Way to liberate ourselves, thus repent, submit, and observe the precepts, daring not to offend again. Also, we offer thanks at will, all at once our heads and hearts bowing to the ground, hearts joyful. Thus the sages surely attain liberation from all sufferings and hardships, all entering the non-action Way.’

The True Man of the Supreme Ultimate said: The Lingbao fasting method uses ten lamps, according to the law of the ten directions. Ten is the number of completion, hence men are born after ten months. Light lamps beside the door. Seven generations of parents light seven lamps before the hall. The purification chamber always lights one lamp; beside the doors light two lamps. And where talismans are affixed to the gate, ghosts and spirits striking people, do they not enter by the gate? Heaven constantly sends down six department messengers, who roam the world, observing men’s good and evil. Ghosts and spirits seeing the talisman lamps all say: ‘This is the gate of a good man; it must not be violated.’ By this is distinction made, life and death and receiving blessings are thus decided. The sun, moon, stars, and constellations, the sick person’s yearly fate each light one lamp. At fasting times, three times morning and evening burn incense and repent of faults, listening with one heart to receive the subtle and profound meaning of the scripture. Hence turning the scriptures and expounding the law resembles the teaching and transformation of the ancient True Men. The sages transmit the scriptures and teachings, transforming later generations, so that those who have not heard may hear, those who do not know may know. This method is a bridge to universally save all people. Therefore, when practicing the Way, disorderly speech is not allowed; only ask the Dharma Master about scripture meanings and precepts; the Master must explain the essential truth. If one can make the inner and outer tranquil and still, respectfully receive a single scripture sentence, the Controller of Fate adds ten accounts. If inner and outer are agitated and competitive, and a single scripture sentence is destroyed, the Controller of Fate subtracts ten accounts. Hence the True Man does not speak without cause; all words must hit the mark. Words are all made into methods; if a man can magnify the Way, it is not the Way that magnifies man, thus it is said.

The Celestial Elder said: By the great fasting law one may obtain the Cave True, thus the Seven Ancestors are freed from hell and ascend to the Supreme Mysterious Palace, their bodies first to receive the five-spored lotus.

The True Man of the Supreme Ultimate said: Princes and nobles all receive the blessings of past lives, whereby they become wealthy and honoured, wise and intelligent, their merits fulfilled. They then should again love the Way; this is because their past sins have been exhausted. When past sins have been exhausted, the person will surely be earnest in fasting and abstinence, studying the great scriptures and great laws, and so will be close to immortality. If one studies the precepts without slacking, one may obtain the highest immortality. Daoists who delight in fasting have all exhausted past sins. Those whose past sins are not exhausted never truly delight in it. This is a long way from immortals and sages. Those who study the Way seeking longevity and long vision, enjoying endless years and kalpas, securing ancestral temples, flourishing clans, delivering seven generations of parents from suffering and hardship, ascending to Heaven, and thereafter producing worthy and wise descendants who will receive the true Lingbao texts—by practicing this fast they obtain this great blessing. The great blessing is to save others first; therefore the elders come before the self, relying on and forgetting, forgetting that which should be forgotten, their mind in accord with the Mysterious. Superior men hearing the Way diligently practice it; middling men are as if present or absent; inferior men laugh at the Way.

The True Man of the Supreme Ultimate said: To move Heaven and Earth, to summon the multitudes of spirits, to communicate with the Way of Immortality, to penetrate the Supreme Truth, to resolve accumulated sins of many lifetimes, to destroy calamities, to repel enemies, to cultivate great virtue, to heal illness, to save all beings, there is nothing nearer than fasting, quietude, and turning the scriptures. It was heard in antiquity; now we hope to see such men.

The True Man of the Supreme Ultimate said: If the worthy desire to cultivate the great law of non-action, this scripture may be circulated, as also the scriptures transmitted by the True Men. The Dao and Virtue Five Thousand Characters is the supreme and highest true scripture. It embraces all great and enters all subtle; it is the great foundation of Dao and Virtue. Looking at those who have attained the Way, none do not study the Five Thousand Characters, such as Yin Xi and the followers of Pine and Cypress. It is called the scripture of the Great Vehicle. Also, the Great Cave True Scripture of thirty-nine chapters is not to be recited among men. Therefore it is the scripture of the true Way’s mystery of ascension. The heavenly emperors descend to receive it, scattering incense and flowers; the six heavens’ great demon kings and their officials and guards acclaim it, all coming to prostrate and receive orders; the mountain and sea spirits all serve their agents. To chant a single line, the heavens assemble rites; how much more so the ghosts and spirits? Therefore it is not to be rashly practiced among men. The Lingbao Scripture is the Daoist’s supreme scripture, the mysterious root of the Great Vehicle, having high and low grades. The True Men who have attained the Way in the ten directions constantly perform rites, burn incense, scatter flowers; it is the root and truth of all Dao. Daoists reverently study Lingbao, bowing in fasting and abstinence, cultivating the laws, all thereby attaining the Way. How could it be otherwise? If this scripture cannot cause one to attain longevity, ascend as immortal, and save the world, then there are no immortals in heaven or earth. The key is to eliminate external distractions, to concentrate within on the profound truth; then one may soar above the Han River and secure longevity. The Five Thousand Characters gather subtle wonders and return to equality, surpassing worldly practice. All fasting methods descend from the supreme original Lingbao fast.

The Celestial Elder said: This great fast is the Way of the highest immortals, by which the Seven Ancestors freed themselves from bondage and soared to the Supreme Mysterious Palace, their bodies first receiving the five-spored lotus like the lotus flower. The five spores also arise spontaneously.

The True Man of the Supreme Ultimate said: The Five Thousand Characters are the secret rites transmitted by the immortals, always concurrent with Lingbao. Talented and superior men who delight in chanting and reciting, seeking the natural Way of flight to immortality, carry the method’s talismanic banner fifty chi long, receiving it at the same time as Lingbao, on famous mountain peaks. The Master faces south, the disciple faces north, making three bows, dividing the gold ring in half, wearing it upon the person, and after receiving the scripture the disciple makes one bow, beginning from north, circling the ten directions. When reading the scripture they also first bow to the ten directions; such is the method. This is the old code of the Great Mysterious Capital; now you clearly understand it, and your descendants will transmit it by rule to later worthy men. The Supreme secret instructions should be kept hidden. You should often think on the Void True Man, the High Supreme Great Law King, the Lord of the myriad chariots, the one called the Old Master. The Old Master is the great law master of the mystery within. With the Dao eye he observes all heavens and men’s good and evil. You propagate this Way, and surely you will become an immortal. On the day you obtain the marvel, you will know that this scripture is not false. Illumined by the text of silence and stillness, the purpose of the Great Way is all here.

The Celestial Elder said: Among the world there are men of great virtue who desire to chant and recite and hope to ascend to immortality; they must receive it simultaneously with Lingbao. The talismanic banner is a covenant of observance of the scripture. Hence it is said: without leaving one’s door or window, one may know the Way of Heaven; this is what is meant. Such men will be rare in the world. If one desires to speak of the Void, and hold to something higher than the times, it is not necessary to receive it by this method. The True Men teach immortality directly. Daoists study it seeking immortality; if not receiving, the Way does not prosper.

The True Man of the Supreme Ultimate said: The True Man embodies the Dao and Void, and fears nothing. Among men there is filth, which the sage shows concern for because of the souls and spirits of the world. When men’s scriptures are soiled, not washed with fragrant water, many illnesses afflict people; this is to show the people the difference between purity and impurity. The Way of ghosts and spirits is even more defiled; where there is filth, the Way cannot proceed. Even gold must not be polluted or wasted; how much more so the supreme Way. The great law of true Way is without stain and bright.

The True Man of the Supreme Ultimate said: When men’s scriptures are soiled, whether great or small, they should be immediately purified. After purification, incense is burned and the Way observed; there is no fixed day limit.

The True Man of the Supreme Ultimate said: The virtuous receive blessed food in numbers according to their rank. Guests from outside also partake. The Zhengyi True Man and the Three Heavens Masters about to ascend to Heaven, seeing the poor and weak people, restore and replenish, preparing meals of ten persons. If suddenly more than ten guests assemble, and there is no supply for them, if the provisions are incomplete or one person is not covered, it is still not universal. Hence the law is made that after all affairs are finished, the surplus kitchen serves all people and living beings, praying blessings for the master. Later generations do not know this; hence it is shown. Wine must not be entirely forbidden but kept measured, according to people’s ability, no need for strict limits. Hence the worldly teaching says: only wine without measure leads to disorder; this is what is meant. Too much wine confuses and disrupts the correct qi; the three true palaces are lost; therefore it must not be excessive; the examining officers should be cautious.

The True Man of the Supreme Ultimate said: Some men who do not study the Way, hearing Daoists discuss the profound and subtle meaning of the supreme scriptures, do not believe, and slander the sacred texts calling them vain and fabricated, not worth study. Since they do not believe, they envy others’ scripture study and methods of cultivation, saying all is false. Such a man in past lifetimes made no connection with immortals and sages; the worthy formed bonds; in this life he has no great wisdom, and fails to perceive the true essence of the worthy and sage. Not believing the supreme Way scriptures and teachings, he delights in sorcery and miscellaneous untrue matters. On meeting, only wine and meat are foremost; his mouth says one thing but his heart another; he is cunning and contentious; lust is unrestrained; he acts as he pleases, craving things without satiation. Sometimes he becomes a teacher, initially with no mind to teach good, oppressing the weak, always wishing to vent his cruelty; in his heart greed, envy, slander, harm, lust, theft, deceit, and rebellion; this man’s body always harbours ten evils. How do we know such a man acts so, yet does not suffer punishment or punishment’s net, and appears stable in the world? Some never transgress the law, always obey the scriptures and teachings, yet suffer more affliction. When a man dies and his body decays, his soul and spirit do not perish, following the good or evil of his life and all have their retribution. Therefore, although the world’s people act evilly and wrongly, killing and offending rulers and fathers, cruel beyond comparison, they are not immediately examined, because they receive blessings from past lives; when blessings are exhausted, sins come. One may be governed by yang officials in life, enter hell in death, suffer unbearable tea poison, and be tormented beyond words. If good men now do not act accordingly, it is because their past evil sins are not yet exhausted, and when exhausted blessings come. Some appear noble in the world, or die born into royal families, or are born in heaven, or become ghosts and spirits. Evil begets evil, good begets good, this is called the root of fate. Those who study the Way should also know this. Those who study the Way and do not obtain before death have incomplete merits, no great past connections, only slight causal ties. Later generations all rely on these merits to obtain immortal salvation. If one studies the Way for several years, hopes for ascension, but before success suddenly slackens, or falls into desires and returns to the vulgar, the body perishes, name is lost, revolving in death and suffering, further torments. Or one loses the human body and suddenly leaves the human Way, with no return. Some are sharp and intelligent yet do not teach others, and become foolish in later life. Servants and slaves have no seed; all are due to past lives’ deception of others, now repaid by strength. The six beasts are fed as meat offerings. The world’s people do not believe the Way scriptures, doubt the orthodox teaching, and face such severity; is it not sad? Daoists who meet good with evil, endure injury and insult, observe these laws and precepts, will surely preserve their present merits. To be poor but not to stray from the Way, such a one is a Daoist, and in death will enter the houses of rulers and kings. You, therefore, having obtained the Way, will surely see the roots of past lives in great almsgiving and unwearied study of the Way, thus attaining immortality.

The Left Celestial Elder said: You should be diligent; no past age has attained immortality without study. The key to immortality study is to exhaust the mind; if the mind is not exhausted, study will not obtain (the Way). The sage does not mislead men.

The True Man of the Supreme Ultimate said: The Sacrificial Wine Official should observe and practice the Lord Lao’s one hundred and eighty great precepts; thus he may be called Sacrificial Wine Official. Hence it is said that without receiving the great precepts one may not properly receive the respect of the people and disciples. Those who receive these precepts, with heart mindful of practice, are now the Sacrificial Wine Officials. The Sacrificial Wine Official should cut off desires, abandon many evils, and carry out the precepts accordingly. The Yellow Old Dao is subtle, examining men’s methods; not all are true, but among myriad many are.

The True Man of the Supreme Ultimate said: If the scholar can abandon the burdens of the world, and have the aspiration to travel far in mountains and waters, to follow the utmost law wheel, he is called Master. He always sits on a high seat reading scriptures, teaching the foolish and wise, opening and delivering all scholars. Suppose one’s birth fate is Tiger or Rabbit, belonging to the two eastern earthly branches, he is called Eastern Mountain Master. The four directions follow this. Those born in Dragon, Dog, Ox, or Sheep are called Central Mountain Masters. If again one is pure and true with highest virtue, able to penetrate subtle and profound meanings, accompanying disciples and fellow students, they are called such and such Master. Such a person is profound and far-reaching, learned and mysterious, aspiring to the Great Vehicle, called Profoundly Called Master, or Wandering Profound Master, or Far-Traveling Master, or Declaring the Way Master, or Expounding Profound Master. Briefly speaking, their ranks cannot be reversed. There must be such men in the world, and learners call them so. This is the usual method. When we say name Shangqing, it is the Clear Fast of seven days. The Master’s rank is lofty and must not be rashly claimed; ghosts and spirits do not receive or serve one so; Heaven tests and examines men. The Master is a Daoist. In this study of immortality the title of True Man is earned; embodying the Dao and great law, he is called True Man.

The True Man of the Supreme Ultimate said: Observing the world as the Way, those who desire fasting, abstinence, and scripture turning, seeking an enlightened Master to receive and read, and to inquire into the meanings and faithfully observe them, are mostly superficial and shallow men, their hearts full of sounds and colours, their aspirations without great refinement, fond of minor vehicle methods. Sometimes there is one person desiring fasting and abstinence and studying the Way, but lacking an enlightened Master to mutually encourage. His aspiration is the Way of immortality, to save all the people, and the people do not ridicule him. All say: ‘That is unnecessary, I have not seen many study that method; the scriptures are full of vain words.’ Hence they say that their own methods can dispel calamities and scatter misfortunes. The deaf do not hear Shao and Wu; the blind do not see white and black; can it be said they are already sick? Thus the Great Way does not prosper, the true law does not flourish, true scriptures lie neglected, and evil spirits and demons increase day by day. They each claim to be the three palace maidens; evil confusion arises; the people will abandon truth and pursue falsehood. All this arises from Masters not diligently studying and encouraging disciples to study orthodox scriptures and laws. True truth dwells in the heart; then demons and goblins are far away. Not understanding the grand meaning of the highest scripture, there is no way to examine the heart; evil spirits and demon qi enter the heart and act without limit. It is like clutching a stone to cross a great river; is it not so?

The True Man of the Supreme Ultimate said: Zhuang Zhou was the Supreme Southern Flower Immortal. In a previous life while studying the Way he desired thus: ‘If I attain the Way and become immortal, my intelligence and insight will be great, and I will go out among men, expounding and explaining the Dao and Virtue Scripture of Five Thousand Characters, spreading the meaning of the Way.’ Hui Zi was his disciple, and then said: ‘If Master attains the Way, able to come and go at will, the disciple wishes to attend, chant and praise the subtle words, penetrate the profound meaning, and thoroughly observe the source of the Way to resolve the worldly snares.’ He checked the hearts of vulgar men’s vain rivalry, guiding them by the natural gate; hence the profound and profound again, the gate of all wonders. Afterwards both obtained their wishes, and wrote books all conveying the Way’s meaning. The world today does not know these to be true Immortal Venerables, but regards Zhuangzi’s works as many allegories. The great roc, the great pillar, the Ming spirit, are all real recorded sayings, not idle tales. On a grand scale great things produce these great creatures; now in the celestial gardens, Kunlun, Penglai, and the Northern Sea, these divine creatures abound. On a small scale small things arise. If one desires all things visible to be real, and invisible to be unreal, the world would have very little at all. The Daoist scriptures use parables, speaking of aeons of long duration, with a stone like Kunlun mountain’s mustard seed, forty li across, heaven and men’s robes, once a hundred years wiping this stone clean, taking one mustard seed as the end of a kalpa. So long, who would believe it?

The True Man of the Supreme Ultimate said: The Lingbao Scripture is the ancestor of many scriptures, hard to speak or explain. The Five Thousand Characters are subtle and profound, the great meaning to which all scriptures return. The Cave True’s thirty-nine chapters are spoken by the thirty-nine True Men; these are words of non-birth. These were transmitted by True Men. Their persons are of Dao and Virtue true qi, mixed and transformed naturally into True Men, companions of Laozi. Having passed through uncountable kalpas, they are not men who merely study the Way. Men not possessing past grace and full merits, obtaining the Cave True Scripture, cannot know this meaning. What is taught is the supreme Three Heavens natural palaces, ten thousand creatures and mountains and rivers. These mountains and rivers and ten thousand things have worldly names like those on earth, but are not the mountains and rivers and ten thousand things of the world; all are natural things, hard to hear and difficult to explain. The Cave True Jade Clear Scripture’s brief explanation of its meaning fails to catch its thread; how can one comprehend it? Reverently observing it brings great blessings, life is prolonged, ancestral temples are peaceful, reciting it makes one king of True Men, their Way supreme. In former times those who obtained the highest immortality and supreme truth all revered the Lingbao Scripture.

The Three Heavens call immortals, Brahma calls the Way. Heaven and Earth have beginning and end, so also there are great and small kalpas; all scriptures likewise perish. Later sages again issued laws; only the Dao and Virtue Five Thousand Characters, the Great Cave True Scripture, and Lingbao are indestructible and inexhaustible, transmitted everlastingly. Hence called the chapters of non-birth, the king of scriptures. Therefore successive generations teach and transform so that immortality is attained, but generations know not the source. Lofty and supreme, not seen by ghosts and spirits; only the six heavens’ great demon kings come to serve the scripture masters; the upper three heavens’ officers supervise the immortal officials. Nor are they heard by lower immortals; only True Men can study them. The world does not know these are immortals, and say immortals are not the Way; this is because their past debts are not exhausted. When debts are exhausted, one obtains profound understanding and great wisdom, clearly knowing, knowing is attaining the Way. The Five Thousand Characters are very difficult to understand; those who do understand all do. Therefore it is said one should comprehend the supreme great wisdom.

The True Man of the Supreme Ultimate said: To establish the Lingbao fasting law, select a person of high virtue and profound understanding of scripture meaning as Dharma Master; next one of talent and clarity, able to convey subtle principles and report upon the law and precepts as chief lecturer; next fasting supervisor, to strike and punish violations; next scripture attendant; next incense attendant; next lamp attendant; and so on to seating order. Those who first receive this scripture are above; those who receive later are below. If one in the household receives the scripture, others desirous of fasting may listen and fast. If at times there is a Yellow or Red Taiyi Sacrificial Wine Official who desires to see the fasting methods, they may listen and observe the great law’s transformation, but may not sit on the same bed. Even those of great virtue and worldly fame should take the last place, according to the order of the registers. Burning incense is the same. This is because such persons have slight past connections; therefore now they may be beforehand.

The True Man of the Supreme Ultimate said: At fasting times all hearts should be fixed on the profound truth, never distracted by external thoughts. Thoughts should be on the scripture master; first thinking of the Three Ones in the palace chamber, settled and clear, possessing the three souls and seven spirits, the Taiyi stationed in the Mud Pill at the center, as in the method of the Wind Returning Emperor. Then together with the soul one fasts listening to scripture, receiving by mouth and storing in heart; then the Three Corpses flee and vanish, evil qi is destroyed, inside and outside receive the true; thus one is near immortality. Additionally one exhales and inhales, guides and harmonizes the fluids, practicing the various subtle ways above; the heavenly truth surely will descend upon you. Superior men obtain the Way within the chamber. Even if dwelling in caves and holes, so long as external thought is not a particle lessened, it is but vainly wasting strength. To study the Way is only to exhaust the mind; when the mind is exhausted, the immortal will immediately observe and test it. You must carefully examine it.

The True Man of the Supreme Ultimate said: Daoists keep far from human paths, quietly dwelling on famous mountains, cultivating prolonged fasts, living alone in secluded valleys, then no longer selecting a Dharma Master, but only speaking from heart and mouth. Those who cultivate this fast among men, Daoists who eat five grains, if no food is taken, so be it; if medicine is taken, take it rightly. Drink moderately, with clear drinks and abstain from food, in the morning drink gruel, at noon eat vegetables. When the fast limit ends, end the fast, like setting up a grand kitchen; cleanliness alone is suitable. Fruits and seasonal delicacies should be given first incense and prayers, wishing the fasting master to ascend to immortality and save the world.

The True Man of the Supreme Ultimate said: The way of fasting is always to practice the ten good thoughts:

1. To think of the Dao and the Four Greats, so that the seven generations of parents are freed from suffering and worry, ascending to Heaven, with clothing and food natural.

2. To think of the flourishing of emperors, kings, lords, the orderly schools, the imperial teaching extended and grand, dignity majestic, universally gazed upon, the six barbarians subdued, evil and demons daily destroyed, worthy sages daily born.

3. To think of the Dharma Master’s great accomplishment and teaching, illuminating and clear, all attaining flight to immortality.

4. To think of fellow learners, quickly attaining the Way of Immortality, mutually opening the Way.

5. To think of harmony among relatives, loving benevolence and righteousness, esteeming the Way and despising wealth, acting as a model.

6. To think of giving to Daoists and the hungry and cold, so that all people receive their due.

7. To think of the creeping and flying worms, all living beings, all receiving accomplishment.

8. To first thank the past and present lives’ birth and death offenses, establishing merit to make amends.

9. To think of family’s prosperity, ancestral temples established, and worthy talents born in the world.

10. To think of reverently receiving the Master’s scriptures, daring not to be negligent, with equality and one heart, broadly saving all, my body ascending to immortality, rising by day to Heaven, worshipping the Supreme, forever becoming a True Man, swallowing the five-colored spirit liquids, uniting with the Dao.

Mr. Zheng said: When receiving the scriptures atop a mountain, one need not bow with a memorial; only open the mouth and recite.

Anthem:

‘The Way takes fasting as foremost, diligently practising ascending the Golden Tower. Hence establishing the great law bridge, universally saving all beings. Past life’s grace repaid, the Dao mind transcendently arises. The body soars to the Mysterious Capital, the Seven Ancestors all freed.’

When finished, one must chant this text.

Mr. Zheng of the Southern Mountain said: My former Master the Celestial Elder always kept this book secret, not transmitting it except to the supreme true; ten thousand gold pieces are insufficient to value it. Immortals transmitted it by word; now it is written. The Celestial Elder said: One copy is sealed and returned to the famous mountain; one copy is transmitted to disciples; one copy is entrusted to family descendants, recorded generation by generation, knowing the Way. Along with the original Lingbao Scripture it is transmitted; it is the Daoist mystery.

Bao Puzi said: Hong Yi said that those who take many days of great fasting are either noble persons or Daoists, naturally weak and feeble; day and night at six times they bow and worship. The ignorant desire to burn incense and bow three times in daytime; night may be omitted. This is for expounding law and meaning only. Those who can burn incense six times must complete the law. I fear some not yet obtaining the Way have extremely weak qi and strength, only fasting one day and one night, yet this suffices for six times practice of the Way. Learners should carefully make use of this.

To conclude fasting, one may eat dried dates, venison preserved and dried; these are fresh foods, no other is permissible.

If not mountain Daoists and those who cultivate scriptures at home, how could they practice prolonged fasting and long contemplation? One should correspond to fasting, for at least ten, nine, seven, three, or one day to practice the Way. Such merits are vast and universal, the highest method of studying the Way. The Seven Ancestors depart suffering and poison, ascend to the hall of blessings; this may be called the utmost Way of filial piety. The utmost filial piety passes through spirit brightness, extending far to the Seven Mysteries; how much more than ancestors. Hence the highest immortals keep it secret.
