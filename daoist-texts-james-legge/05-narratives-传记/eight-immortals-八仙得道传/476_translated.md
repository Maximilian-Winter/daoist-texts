# Chapter 8: The Old Jiaolong Ascends the Shore to Destroy Blessings; The Yue Lao Descends to the Sea as the Dragon's Matchmaker

Meanwhile, the Fire Dragon Immortal, hearing that the Bat was to be one of the Eight Immortals assisting the Jade Emperor in the future, could not but nod his head and say, "So it is; I truly knew it not." Piaomiao smiled and said, "Now I will again tell you the matter of the old Dragon’s calamity."

It came to pass that the Bat, having received the instruction of the Wenmei Immortal, was told that having rendered service to the people of Guankou, he might enjoy their incense offerings for a thousand years; thereafter he could early transform into a human form, with a bright future before him. Moreover, he summoned the great and small earth gods of Guankou, bidding them to proclaim among the people that a temple should be erected in his honour, to offer worship and thus manifest reverence and gratitude for his merits, fulfilling thereby one of the good causes and fine results.

The people of Guankou, receiving the orders from the earth gods, indeed every household eagerly participated, building a temple for the Bat. Though the place was not large, it was solemn in structure. The people, because it was by the command of the earth gods, revered the Bat exceedingly, calling him the God of Blessings and Virtue. This was a play upon the homophony of "blessing" and "bat," expressing both respect and a hope that he would bestow blessings forever. Later, throughout the thousand-li region of Guankou, whenever there were joyous occasions or festivals, every family would hang a scroll depicting five or nine bats, to signify the wide reception of many blessings.

It was said that although this creature was small, it was quite intelligent; those who sincerely worshipped it could perceive some return in kind. Because of this, the incense in the temple grew prosperous. The Bat, long nourished by the incense of mortals, even came to be able to change into human form and appear in the countryside; but this lasted not long—seven or ten days at most—before reverting to his original shape. He was a diligent and cautious being, seldom daring to leave the temple lest he incur trouble and bring down the wrath of the celestial gods.

Yet fate was fixed; those doomed to calamity could not escape. This Bat, without understanding how, suddenly became acquainted with me, a humble disciple. We were both persons who valued righteousness and virtue, and naturally became very intimate. Whenever the old Dragon ascended the shore to visit his mother’s grave, he would surely go to the Bat’s temple to converse. Though the Bat could not enter the water, sometimes he changed into human form and went alone to the seashore, using the peaceful name Pinghe. The old Dragon would then emerge and play together with him. Their companionship was most close.

This was all but ordinary, and bore no great consequence. But there was another Jiaolong in the sea, who had cultivated for a shorter time than the old Dragon, yet whose learning of demonic arts was no less. Hearing that his younger brother had gone to reform the old Dragon and soon achieved success, he felt great resentment.

One day, having taken human form, he passed by the Bat’s temple and went in to look about. Seeing within only a great flying bird fashioned in statue, he knew not its origin, and mistakenly thought it was the peacock atop the Western Buddha’s crown. He hastened to bow before it. Coming out, he inquired of the locals and learned that it was a Bat transformed from a rat, and was told the reason for erecting the temple. This angered him nearly to death. Immediately he made magical signs and summoned many earth gods of the area, rebuking them:

"Why have you made such a small insect into so grand a figure, receiving incense offerings from the people’s households? Today I mistook it for the peacock on the Buddha’s crown and bowed deeply to it. That beast dares to sit so high and in such splendour, and not even utter a word of courtesy—this is intolerable indeed! I, the old Jiaolong, am coeval with heaven and earth, having attained the supreme Tao. Except for the Erlang God who governs me, and the several immortals and Buddhas I revere, when have I ever spoken soft words to those base and unrelated lowly spirits? But today I suffer loss before this little beast! This is intolerable! Now, to make things short, I set you three days to tear down this temple, drive out this little beast beyond the borders, and end all matters. Should you dare disobey, I will first break your legs, then set fire to burn his rat’s nest."

The earth gods, seeing the old Jiaolong so enraged, yet knowing the Bat’s background was not slight, were truly in a dilemma. They looked at one another in silence, unable to answer. The old Jiaolong raged, "You say nothing! Do you think the power of the old Jiaolong is less than a mere rat? Do you fear rats, but not me? Very well! Since you thus despise me, I must apologize to you no longer."

So saying, he angrily drew a three-pointed, two-edged blade, forged from the hairs of his own beard. The moment the blade left its sheath, ten thousand cold rays flashed, striking the faces of those present. The old Jiaolong brandished the blade fiercely, displaying a readiness to fight. The earth gods, terrified, huddled together in a heap. They shouted, "Great Lord, stay your wrath, and suffer us earth gods to explain the matter." The old Jiaolong, brandishing the blade, shouted, "Speak quickly! Speak quickly!"

The earth gods, seeing the old Jiaolong unreasonable, held a consultation. One among them, being more shrewd, thought: since the Dragon is king of the waters, and all things in the water obey his command, and hearing that the Bat was close friends with the Guankou old Dragon, why not borrow the old Dragon's prestige to frighten him and see how he would deal with it? Smiling, he said:

"Great Lord, there is no need to display wrath; surely the Bat is no match for your lordship. The earth gods obey his commands but are not content. Yet his master, the Wenmei Immortal, is a powerful high deity, and lately he has been on very close terms with the Guankou Dragon King, coming and going in great familiarity. The earth gods intended to obey orders and dismantle his temple and drive him back to the mountains. If Wenmei Immortal learns of it, and you, Great Lord, defend us, the earth gods would have no fear. But the Guankou Dragon God is near at hand; hearing that his friend suffers loss, he will surely come to help. As king of the watery tribes, his power is greatest. Should he become enraged and move his divine body, he could overturn seas and remove mountains, making the two worlds of yin and yang insecure. Then indeed the earth gods would perish, and even you, Great Lord, and the local people could not escape his harm. What then will become of us?"

These words, spoken so smoothly by the earth gods, unwittingly touched the old Jiaolong’s anger. Having heard them, he roared with rage.

His shout was no ordinary one; even the high mountain at Guankou trembled. The earth gods fled in great numbers into the earth, not daring to show their heads. The old Jiaolong ceased seeking them, and, venting his spite, went straight to the temple, where he smashed the Bat’s image into a messy ruin. Then he dismantled the entire temple, reducing it to rubble.

It is said that there is no story without coincidence. At that moment, the Bat was at the seashore visiting his good friend. Both had taken the appearance of Daoists, strolling leisurely among flowers and trees by the shore, enjoying conversation. Suddenly the Bat shivered as if from cold, then appeared dizzy and faint. In a moment his body and mind were greatly unsettled, and he said to the old Dragon, "Senior brother, I am very unwell now; my heart feels as though it has burst, and I am exceedingly uneasy. Surely something has happened to my little temple."

The old Dragon laughed and said, "Senior brother, you are too suspicious and timid. Setting aside your kindness and great virtue, who among the local people does not worship you sincerely? As for demons and evil spirits envying you, that is well known. Who does not know the close friendship between you and me? In this region, who does not know my fame? Offending you is as though offending me; would I let it rest so? I imagine the weather is untoward; you have suffered some influence of the times. We who cultivate Tao are subject even to death and life, unable to control ourselves; how much less a trifling ailment? Wait a moment longer and it will pass. Senior brother, do not be so anxious; it is not like the spirit of those who cultivate Tao."

The Bat replied, "I will not conceal from you, Daoist brother, that I am here to receive the incense offerings in obedience to the orders of my master. At that time my master commanded that it should be for no more than a thousand years. Now that period is nearly ended. For days my heart has been troubled, fearing accidents might happen. I am not like those greedy men who crave official rank and emolument; besides, the incense is ample, and it is just time to return to the mountains to follow my master, to devote more effort to life, and thus early transform into a human and attain the Great Way. I have no longing for these vain things. I only fear that after a thousand years of caution, one moment’s carelessness may bring disaster to the temple, which would be a crime laid to my charge—this is the first great matter. Secondly, upon leaving I must temporarily separate from you, Daoist brother. Our affection is close, and separation makes my heart uneasy—this is another matter. Just now while walking well, without cause, I suddenly shivered; this never happened before. When I came here after the great flood from Central Plains, a journey of thousands of li, nothing like this occurred. If illness it be, such things are not to be expected in those who cultivate Tao. I think there must be some hidden reason; only we are of too shallow a Taoist power to foresee it. I think the time is late; I will take leave for now, and go see what the matter is. If truly nothing is wrong, I will return tomorrow to report to you."

The old Dragon, hearing this, consented with a nod, inwardly smiling at his timidity. While he pondered, several earth gods hurriedly came, and all together paid obeisance to the two. Then they said to the Bat, "Does the honoured deity know of the changes in the temple?"

Before a word was fully spoken, the Bat was struck dumb, and even the old Dragon was greatly astonished. He quickly asked, "What say you? Has some demon come to the temple? Or have the temple attendants been making mischief outside?" The earth gods then recounted the entire matter.

The old Dragon angrily said, "Detestable demon beast! Does he not know how powerful I am? Well then! Senior brother, stand aside and let me deal with this demon. First, to avenge you; second, to prevent him from troubling the neighborhood; third, to let him recognize the power of the old Dragon, so he dares not speak arrogantly again!"

The Bat was originally a very conscientious being, and knowing his incense term was near its end and that he must return to the mountains, he had no need to quarrel with others. Yet the old Dragon was of a different mind. He was a man of great impetuosity. Having spoken a few words to the Bat, and before he could reply, he revealed his true form, rose into the sky, made a turn, and soon arrived at the Blessings and Virtue temple.

By chance, the old Jiaolong, having just smashed the idol, his anger still unspent, was pointing at the sky and earth, wildly berating the assembled crowd. His words were all directed against the old Dragon. The old Dragon, unable to restrain his fury, shouted from midair, "Wicked demon, cease your insolence! Your grandfather is here!"

The old Jiaolong did not expect the old Dragon to arrive so soon, and was taken by surprise. Hastily revealing his true form, he rose upon a cloud, brandishing his three-pointed, two-edged blade, and engaged the old Dragon in battle. The Dragon’s body was vast; he struck with his head as if pressing down a great mountain, and lashed his tail with the force of uprooting trees in a storm. The Jiaolong was agile, leaping and dodging with furious spirit, making gods and ghosts shudder, and the earth and heaven mourn.

The two were evenly matched, fighting for some time without decision. The old Dragon, inflamed, suddenly spat forth a spiritual pill which became ten thousand fireballs surrounding the Jiaolong. The Jiaolong was a fierce beast of the deep waters, accustomed to using water. Seeing the flames, he sought to counter with water, but did not know the old Dragon’s pill was forged from the essence of sun and moon, and was the Dragon’s own Samadhi True Fire, not to be extinguished by ordinary water power. The Jiaolong summoned all his strength and brought half the sea’s water to quench the divine fire. The result was like pouring oil on fire, further enhancing the flames, and causing great harm to many people and much farmland. Knowing he could not withstand the enemy, the Jiaolong transformed into a small loach, hid among the waves, and plunged into the deep pool below. The old Dragon searched long but could not find him, and his anger flared. Without thought, he used a wild method, bringing several great mountains from afar and dumping them into the sea, hoping to fill the water, fearing the Jiaolong would not be crushed.

The Piaomiao Immortal, relating this, caused the Fire Dragon Immortal to laugh heartily, saying, "It turns out my disciple really is a rough and bold dullard. Has he not thought, if he truly fills Guankou to dry land and the old Jiaolong is crushed, what will become of his own old lair? Does he suppose that after filling the sea, your master, just at that time, would come to summon him to the Eastern Sea, so he can abandon his own lair?" Piaomiao Immortal smiled, "That is why he is called a wild and foolish force! By his stirring, he did indeed press the old Jiaolong beneath the sea, but nearly lost his own life. This place is under Erlang’s jurisdiction; all matters of the three realms are governed by him alone. Having heard the news of the dragon fight and the flooding of dwellings, he hurried with his troops to suppress it. But he came too late; most of the sea had been filled by the old Dragon. Erlang was furious, saying, ‘The poisonous dragon caused calamity and death; now the old Dragon’s crime is no less. If this is not strictly investigated, the sea and land will change at will, and even I shall lose sovereignty.’ He ordered a search for the old Dragon, who was captured and brought before me. Yet the old Dragon’s life was spared, for upon learning of Erlang’s forces, he fled the realm, leaving me to deal with matters. Who could have foreseen that within moments such a great calamity would arise? Where to begin telling it!"

The Fire Dragon Immortal laughed, "So we two may be said to share the same unfortunate lot. Our master has laid this bitter task upon us. These two unruly beasts are of such wild temperaments; they bring disaster upon themselves and must bear the consequences. Yet, we as their teachers, unable to control even two disciples, would be ashamed if our fellow disciples learned it!" Piaomiao Immortal smiled, and asked again the details of the dragons’ mischief. The Fire Dragon Immortal told all in order, and then laughed, "Originally, they disobeyed the master’s orders and should be punished severely, to show our strict discipline! But now is the time we need them, so we can do no more than threaten them and command their assistance to the worldly lord, turning their merits to offset their crimes." Piaomiao Immortal laughed, "Nowadays the rulers below speak of tactics and stratagems. We immortals should treat others with courtesy and sincerity, and not resort to such deceit!" Fire Dragon Immortal laughed, "This is a method of expediency; without it, how could we make these two beasts bend the knee and serve with care?" Piaomiao Immortal laughed heartily, "What expediency or not, I only know that sincerity cannot reach things; we must resort to some semblance and lies to deceive men." Fire Dragon Immortal laughed, "Even so, we as their masters, when no other remedy exists, must adopt such expedients once." The two immortals laughed together.

Soon they came to the sea surface. The Fire Dragon Immortal made a summoning gesture for a dragon; Hu Feilong changed into a maiden and came forth. Seeing his master, he was filled with shame and remorse, prostrating himself with tears like rain. Piaomiao Immortal also summoned Pinghe. The two masters sat upon their swords on the water’s surface, and as the waves rose, they became golden lotuses embracing the two immortals, in most solemn form. The two dragons bowed low on the sea, knowing their guilt and not daring to raise their heads. The two masters cried out, "Do you know your guilt?" Feilong wept without speaking. Pinghe, more obstinate, raised his head and recounted the Jiaolong’s ravages. Piaomiao Immortal waved his hand, saying, "I fear I do not need your telling!" Pinghe was frightened and lowered his head, speaking no more. Then he sighed to the Fire Dragon Immortal:

"Considering their intentions, they are not wholly evil; but all their deeds have exceeded bounds, which is their great crime. Moreover, there was the matter of the havoc in Heaven’s Palace. Had we not arrived in time, your lives would have been ended. They pride themselves on minor magic arts, thinking none in the world or the heavens are stronger than they. Yet among the nine continents, myriad nations, and three realms with islands, how many men of talent and virtue are there who surpass them! Those who arrogantly rely on magical power will in time perish beneath it. Know that magic is for self-defense or for helping the world and saving men, not to oppress others or defy order. When we first reformed you, what injunctions did we give? How have you violated your master’s face and wrought such calamities? According to immortal law, you must bear the guilt of disrespecting your elders, disobeying your masters, and wanton recklessness. Say now, what punishment do you accept upon seeing us?"

Feilong was loyal and humble, and besides bowing his head in apology, dared say no more. The Fire Dragon Immortal then asked Pinghe, "What say you?" Pinghe replied solemnly, "Master and uncle, if it were not for your love, you would not have come to rescue us today! Since you have saved us, it shows our crimes are not to the death. How to punish us you two masters know best. Whether we live or die, we shall be grateful to you; this is all." These words were very appropriate, causing the kind Fire Dragon Immortal to smile. Piaomiao Immortal also smiled and said, "Since you both know your guilt, will you henceforth be careful and diligent, and no longer act recklessly and wantonly?" The two dragons bowed, saying, "We accept the great and deep grace of our masters! If we dare again to act arrogantly in magical arts, we wish to die beneath our masters’ flying swords!"

The two masters then rose and told them of their origins. The two dragons stood beside their respective masters, ready to obey. The two masters taught them to perform the ceremony of senior and junior brother and sister meeting. Just as they began to speak of what was to come, suddenly from the northeast a cloud of many colours slowly descended. The two immortals looked up and laughed, saying, "That is the Yue Lao come here to do what?" Before the words ended, the cloud of Yue Lao alighted upon the sea and met the two immortals.

What this old one came to do is unknown, but will be revealed in the next chapter.
