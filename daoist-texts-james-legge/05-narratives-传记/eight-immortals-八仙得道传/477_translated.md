# Chapter IX: The Heavenly Invitation to Bestow the Dragon King; The Court's Joyful Feast and the Artifice of Snail Meat

It is related that the Old Man under the Moon descended to the head of the clouds, and met with the two Immortals, the Misty and the Fire Dragon. The two Immortals inquired, "Fellow Daoist, what brings you hither?" The Old Man smiled and said, "Poor as I am, I meddle in no affairs but those of the three heavens — the upper, middle, and lower — and the great marriages throughout the seas and lands of all quarters. Now your two worthy disciples are bound by a marriage fate; how is it that you do not invite me to drink a cup of joyous wine?" The two Immortals then perceived his purpose, and both laughed, saying, "So it is indeed! We are much obliged for your presence. But our young disciples are all of the dragon stock; can their marriages also be under your management?" The Old Man laughed, "How naturally! I govern all marriages, without distinction of Immortal or Buddha, or man."

Then, drawing forth a register from his sleeve, he opened it and showed it to the two Immortals, saying, "Pray look, are these not the names of your disciples?" The two Immortals examined it for a while, and saw there recorded that Pinghe and Hu Feilong were originally of the dragon stock, who later became men, and on a certain year, month, and day, were joined as husband and wife.

Having perused the record, the Old Man closed the register. The two Immortals then summoned their two disciples to pay respect to the Old Man, and bade them perform a deep obeisance. The Old Man, beaming with kindness, said repeatedly, "I dare not, I dare not!" and further added, "In time to come, you two shall hold office as kings of the water tribes, overseeing the affairs of the four seas, and beget dragon stock, each presiding over their own sea. Your future prospects are indeed vast. Moreover, since you govern not one another, but are friends among the people, how can you accept so great a ceremony?" The two Immortals smiled and said, "Future affairs are for future consideration. Now that you are the great matchmaker, how can you refuse thanks for your mediation?" The Old Man, though reluctant, received their salutation.

The Old Man bade the two disciples pay respects to Heaven and Earth and to their two masters, then performed the mutual salute, thus consummating a harmonious union. The Fire Dragon Immortal laughed and said, "Our young disciples have obtained a good match; all your labours, most noble Daoist friend, have brought this about. A cup of wine is the humblest token of respect. But since they shall soon receive their appointment, and have not yet presented themselves before the two emperors, either celestial or mortal, nor prepared a residence, they cannot even express this lowest courtesy, which is truly most embarrassing!" The Old Man laughed and said, "This matter ought to be arranged by the teachers on their behalf. Since it is now spoken of, let this banquet be entered in record, and when your disciples are honoured with their edict and have a new palace, you may hold a double feast to celebrate their promotion!" The two Immortals laughed heartily. The Old Man said, "My affairs are many, and I cannot tarry. I must take my leave."

The two Immortals smiled at each other and said, "This old fellow is indeed witty. Since we are their teachers, we ought to present them with some gifts." Pinghe, hearing this, said, "The gifts from our masters will naturally be of great value. Now that we disciples are married, yet without a home, let us stay here with our masters for the present; when we have made some progress and have a home, then we may receive all gifts at once." The two masters laughed and said, "That is reasonable; let us await the imperial decree, and then we will arrange a palace for you!" Pinghe and the others hastened to bow their thanks. The two masters then instructed, "At present, in the northern regions, great floods have arisen. The mortal emperor there is called Yu Shun, a most benevolent and virtuous sovereign. Because of the calamity of the floods, he has laboured day and night, and commanded his loyal ministers, Xia Yu and Bo Yi, to take charge of the water affairs. You two should go to assist them, taking charge of the seas. When we came, the Patriarch had already petitioned the Heavenly Court to issue the imperial decree, which will arrive shortly. After you have received grace, you may proceed to your posts, and we shall take you to meet Xia Yu and the others, after which you may separate the waters and lands, each fulfilling your duties."

As the two Immortals spoke, suddenly music sounded in mid-air. All looked up and beheld countless celestial officials, riding clouds and mist, descending from the sky. The two Immortals hastened to lead their disciples to bow upon the sea's surface. The officials halted some ten or more zhang above the sea, and read aloud the imperial edict. Its purport was as follows:

The paths of Immortal and mortal are separate; water and land diverge in their courses. Now in the lower realm there is a flood calamity; beasts and demons run rampant. The mortal emperor has appointed worthy ministers to attend specially to these affairs. As for the myriad duties of the water tribes, it is by My command that talents are dispatched to assist the mortal sovereign and ministers, so that both sides may work together, and thus the floods may be quelled, the beasts and demons hidden, and the millions of people may live in peace and plenty. Now the two Immortal Ancestors, Yuanshi and Laojun, recommend Pinghe and Hu Feilong as fit for this charge. Though these two ministers have previous faults, they are for the present not to be prosecuted. Pinghe is hereby invested as Dragon King of the Four Seas, Hu Feilong as Queen, and further graced by Heaven. It is permitted that your descendants shall, in time, govern the various great and lesser seas, and be Dragon Kings forever, never to be removed. You must reform your faces and cleanse your hearts, to repay Heaven's grace. Having established your merits and wiped away past faults, great hopes are held for you.

The two masters received the edict, then led their disciples to bow towards the sky, and saw off the celestial officials. The two disciples then came forward to offer thanks to their masters. The two masters admonished, "We have cultivated the Way until now, and our offices are those of Golden Immortals, yet we have not received such distinction as you. You should consider whence you came, and what your attainments are, that you may obtain such honour. Henceforth be diligent at all times and circumspect at every moment; do not, for a moment's sentiment, endanger the myriad living beings. Do not arrogate to yourself high station and disdain all others. Ever preserve a heart of benevolence and shun a spirit of pride. Cultivate virtue and establish merit; past faults may be covered, and future blessings be boundless. Be solemn and diligent; forget not this teaching." The two disciples bowed in acknowledgment. The two masters further said, "Now is the time for your homage to the Jade Emperor. We can accompany you to Heaven, but cannot speak on your behalf. Since you have previously transgressed, at your audience you must strive to be magnanimous, not overstep proprieties, and not be cast down by past matters. Nor should you indulge in arrogance because of favour. You must know that the power of Heaven is close at hand; honours, favours, losses and gains, are all matters of great import; how can you not be most careful?" The two disciples assented repeatedly.

The two masters led them first to the Crane's Cry Cave of the Fire Dragon Immortal in the region of Yanzhou, where they changed into court robes and took jade tablets in hand, their whole bearing bright and radiant. The two masters looked at each other and smiled, saying, "Look at these two fellows; they have some presence. Yet we must see whether their inward and outward accord, whether their words and deeds correspond." The Misty Immortal then taught them the courtly rites and ceremonies, having them practise a while.

Both men had old roots in the Way, and their cultivation was already complete; naturally, they learned with ease. The two Immortals were greatly pleased, and then took them to Heaven. Upon reaching the Southern Heavenly Gate, four heavenly generals and their soldiers guarded the pass. The two masters explained their purpose. The four generals bowed and admitted them. Presently Li Chang-geng came forth to greet them. Meeting the Fire Dragon and Misty Immortals, they greeted each other warmly and spoke of their mutual separation.

The Fire Dragon Immortal apologized to the two disciples for previous offenses, and the Misty Immortal laughed, bidding them to make their apologies in person. Startled, Chang-geng steadied one of them with a hand and laughed heartily, "Brothers of the Dao, such formality! Why should we dwell on past matters? Moreover, ignorance is no crime; the Jade Emperor has pardoned former faults and newly conferred the kingship. How can I harbour any resentment?" After some gracious exchanges, the masters and disciples followed Chang-geng to ascend to the Golden Palace. Chang-geng entered to present their petition; an edict was issued for the masters and disciples to have audience. The Fire Dragon and Misty Immortals gave the two disciples some final counsel. All arranged their robes and caps, took jade tablets at their breasts, and with earnestness and reverence proceeded into the court. The Jade Emperor sat high in the hall, with large and small celestial officials standing in two ranks at his sides. The four together proclaimed in unison, "May the sacred lifespan be boundless!" and knelt before the throne. The Jade Emperor issued orders to comfort the Fire Dragon and Misty Immortals, and also exhorted the couple Pinghe and Hu Feilong. The masters and disciples all bowed thanks in due form.

After the audience, many celestial officials came to renew old acquaintance with the two Immortals. The two Immortals bade their disciples pay respects to each in turn. Lingering for a while, due to the need to pay homage to Yuanshi Laojun and other emperors and Golden Immortals, they dared not delay, and so took their leave. They left by the Southern Heavenly Gate, first visiting the Yuanshi Heavenly Venerable on Mount Kunlun, thence to the Eight View Palace to see the Patriarch Laojun. Laojun presented each of the couple Pinghe and Hu Feilong with a set of imperial dragon robes, and bestowed upon Pinghe a treasured sword, and upon Hu Feilong a divine needle of the Flying Dragon, all capable of taking the lives of demons and monsters from hundreds of li afar, and able to be used at will with wonderful transformations. The two disciples were greatly delighted and bowed their thanks.

Laojun said to Misty Immortal, "At Guankou, from land to sea, and sea to land, the number of the vicissitudes is all predetermined. To move mountains and overturn seas is rash indeed, but in truth it is not Pinghe's fault. That place has much land and little water, and is far from the sea, so salt is hard to procure. You may go to the mortal world and, with the ruler, use the Law to create a surveillance well, and beside it set up a volcano, for the convenience of the people. Incidentally, there is one who should attain salvation there; when he comes he will know it himself. I too shall soon journey to the lower realm to finish a mundane bond. Moreover, your elder brother Donghua will likely descend to the mortal world, but that will be after the Central Plains have been pacified; it is yet early now." To the Fire Dragon Immortal he said, "You established a sluice in the Qiantang River to guard against many demons, which is very good. But in the future, a mighty Jiao demon will be able to pass through the sluice. When that demon appears, there will be many harms. You must keep watch and find means to suppress him, so as to prevent destruction of living beings; this will be a great merit." The two Immortals received their commissions and, seeing Laojun had no more words, dared not further profane his hearing, and took their disciples to take leave of the palace. They then toured various places again. The two disciples obtained many rare and precious gifts, and went to the Eastern Sea to meet the Emperor Hua.

The Emperor and the two Immortals were close friends, and specially held a grand feast to welcome the masters and disciples. At the banquet, the Emperor asked about affairs in the mortal world, and the two Immortals briefly spoke of them. The Emperor sighed, saying, "I attained the Way overseas and immediately ascended to the Immortal realm. I have long regretted not being able to behold the flourishing culture of China. When I have the opportunity, I also wish to descend and travel there. What say you, brothers of the Dao?" The two Immortals were taken aback and greatly astonished, hastily asking, "The Heavenly Palace is the highest and most revered place of all realms; the Emperor has just assumed his celestial office, how can he entertain thoughts of wandering the mortal world? The sages have no jest in their words; what they say they perform, and what they promise they accomplish. We beg the Emperor to take heed!" The Emperor still did not comprehend, and unwittingly said, "What difficulty is there? Many Immortals and Buddhas have played in the mundane world; why may I not go?" The two Immortals, seeing his persistence, dared not further dissuade him, nor speak more, fearing he might utter more ominous words. They signaled to one another to take leave, and bowed their farewells. On the way, they spoke of how the Emperor had suddenly aroused mortal desires, and marveled that the Patriarch had earlier foretold the descent of Donghua; even one who cultivates the Way to this realm is not free from greedy desires and delusions of the mind, much less others. Truly, this is a matter of great fear for us. So saying, they sighed awhile.

The Flying Dragon interposed, "Pray, Master, just now the Patriarch said he would 'soon descend to the mortal world'; thus going in and out of the three realms is common for Immortals. Why then are you so worried about Elder Brother Donghua?" The two masters said, "How should you know? The Patriarch is the ancestor of all the myriad nations, the nine continents, the five sacred mountains, the three mountain ranges, and myriads of Immortals. No matter what demonic calamities there are, his Dharma body cannot be broken, nor can his Dao mind be confounded. When he descends, it is because he has unfinished karma; he goes and returns. No one else need worry for him. As for Elder Brother Donghua, though his virtue is deep, how can he compare with the Patriarch? Long ago, the Jade Emperor, seeing that in the lower realm the seven treasures trees were shining to the nine heavens, was stirred to covetousness, and thus a soul was sent to fall to the mortal realm to undergo tribulations. His mind was confused, and he nearly failed to return to Heaven. Luckily many assisting Immortals guarded and guided him at all times and places, so he completed his tribulation and returned to truth. The present True Warrior Emperor was indeed formed from that soul of the Jade Emperor sent to the lower realm. Even the Jade Emperor himself, with such deep roots, cannot move one jot of greed or anger, nor utter a jest. How much less Elder Brother Donghua, and still less the Emperor himself!"

The two disciples, hearing this, were greatly struck, and said, "I, born lowly and with shallow knowledge of the Way, have always been arrogant and ignorant of the heights of Heaven and Earth. Now hearing your teachings, I feel myself as though utterly without talent. Henceforth I will more earnestly examine my body and mind, lest I fall into the calamity of rebirth." The two masters rejoiced and said, "If you can thus restrain yourselves, your future is indeed boundless. Although your fate is set for tribulation and suffering, why may you not cultivate virtue and merit, and turn your fortunes around?" The two disciples assented. The four masters and disciples having paid respects to the various heavenly lords and Immortal gods, returned to the lower realm.

At this time the capital of Yu Shun was located in what is now Shanxi province. That which was called China then comprised only part of the land north and south of the Yellow River. The regions of the upper and lower Yangtze were considered southern barbarian lands, outside the realm. The Yellow River basin was all low and flat; its floods flowed in all directions, mingling with smaller waters such as the Ji and Huai rivers, increasing the total volume beyond containment, flooding the entire Central Plains into a vast marsh. The people could not settle and were forced to flee to higher ground. The region was also infested with lions, tigers, leopards, wolves, and other fierce beasts, who would attack men on sight. Those not drowned by the waters perished by beast.

The people then knew not what great sin they had committed to bring such a calamity upon themselves, a calamity rare in the ages. Fortunately, Emperor Shun was wise in appointing the loyal Xia Yu and Bo Yi to the task of flood control. They accepted the emperor's orders, but the waters were so great that at first they found it difficult to begin. They consulted together and issued a proclamation seeking advice on flood control. The Fire Dragon Immortal and Misty Immortal chanced to be bringing Pinghe and Hu Feilong to pay respects, and passing by, first went to meet Yu and Yi, presenting plans for dredging and flood control, and informing them that Pinghe and Hu Feilong had been appointed Dragon King and Queen of the Great Sea by imperial decree, to aid in the pacification of waters and to oversee water tribes. Yu and Yi were exceedingly delighted, and took them to meet Emperor Shun, explaining their purpose. Emperor Shun praised them, and as with the Jade Emperor, conferred upon Hu Feilong the title of Queen. Thus the two Immortals sent Pinghe and Hu Feilong into the great sea.

The Fire Dragon Immortal personally journeyed to the South Sea, gathering great quantities of crystal. Using wondrous methods, he built a palace for them, where the water was still and the inner and outer chambers were bright and clear; this is the famed Crystal Palace of the world. The Misty Immortal arranged all manner of furnishings and vessels, placing them in order. In a short time, the palace was a most splendid Dragon Palace. The Dragon King and Queen were deeply moved; beyond bowing in thanks, they had little to say. The two masters said, "Though you come from humble origins, you have attained such high positions. This is because of your accumulated merits and also the fortunate coincidence of this flood disaster. Even the Patriarch and Jade Emperor pay great regard to you, so we can do our utmost to teach and guide you, and arrange so fine a place. Know that all this is due to imperial grace, and it is hoped that you will not fail this grace, but will exert yourselves to assist the mortal sovereigns and bring this calamity to an end. Hereafter the boundary between water and land will be quite clear, not as in the past a chaotic mixture causing frequent disasters. All affairs of the seas shall henceforth be under your exclusive charge, and you must be careful, vigilant, and diligent in your duties. In decades hence, your descendants will be born and grown, and may be assigned to govern the distant and strategic rivers, lakes, and marshes. These shall all be supervised by you; if there be errors, you shall not be excused."

The Dragon King and Queen listened respectfully to their commands. The two masters, seeing all arrangements complete, returned to the Eight View Palace to report. Since then, the Dragon King and Queen carefully and unremittingly aided Yu and Yi in directing the waters into the seas. Whenever sea beasts such as dragons, turtles, and soft-shelled turtles flowed into the Central Plains and harmed living beings, the Dragon King would dispatch subordinates to capture and return them to the sea. Yu and Yi were loyal and good men; for flood control they followed the plans presented by the two Immortals, dredging, diverting, deepening and opening channels. For the beast problem, Bo Yi led able-bodied men, prepared fire weapons, burned the mountains, hunted and slew countless beasts — all within human power. As for works on the sea surface, it was only through the cooperation of the Dragon King and Queen that complete success was achieved. The people enjoyed their labors and new boundaries were drawn, dividing provinces and establishing a simple local system. These matters are all recorded in the Book of Yu's Tribute, and have little to do with this book; they are here omitted.

Now this book recounts but a small matter, somewhat connected with this flood calamity. At that time, beneath Mount Song in Henan, there lived a poor family of three, a mother and her son and daughter-in-law, who made their living by farming. Their surname was Sun, the son named Jie, the mother Wang, and the wife Liu. Wang, having lost her husband in middle age, reared her orphaned son, and since her widowhood abstained from meat and fish, to manifest her resolve. Because of the flooding disaster, the whole family fled to the mountains. Wang was aged and could not bear hardship and sorrow, and was afflicted by dampness, both within and without, becoming seriously ill. After the waters receded, returning home, she found all household goods and utensils washed away, which greatly distressed her and worsened her illness.

In the countryside it was hard to find medical care, and after the flood, the family was poorer still, so there was no means to pay for medicine. They could only watch as her condition grew dire. Sun Jie and his wife tended her day and night without rest; there was no other remedy. One day, as Wang's end drew near, she suddenly revived somewhat and wished to eat something. The couple rejoiced, thinking she might recover, and asked what she desired. But Wang refused many things, liking nothing except field snails. This was because after the flood, a large field snail had come to the house from some unknown source. Liu, seeing the snail's unusual size, kept it in clean water, and Wang had seen it, so now wished to taste this novel delicacy. Sun Jie said, "If mother wishes to eat, be it meat or vegetable, we will feed her and see." Liu, however, knew this was a fatal desire. Wang had eaten vegetarian for decades; to break this resolve with a snail might cause sudden remorse and further illness. Moreover, for a vegetarian to break their vow is a great offense. Therefore Liu devised a plan; she went outside and collected some snail shells, washed them with boiling water until all smell was gone, then mashed wheat gluten and dried tofu into a paste, shaped it like snail meat, and placed it in the shells to deceive Wang. She said, "By your order, the snails have been cooked; please taste this novelty." Wang happily ate several, not knowing it was a fabricated substitute. After a day more, her allotted span was fulfilled, and she passed away.

Sun Jie and his wife were grief-stricken and emaciated, no need to recount further. They completed the funeral rites. Because Wang had wished for snails at her end, Liu grieved deeply at the sight of the large snail. Sun Jie took it and released it back into the water. Later Liu also fell ill and died. At her deathbed, she wept and said to her husband, "I have followed you twenty years, cared for your parents and managed the household, and think I have not failed in virtue. Yet I have not borne you a son or a daughter. Our fortunes are so poor; after I die, how can you have money to marry again? The Sun family line will be cut off by you. This is my dying regret." Having spoken, she died.

From then on, Sun Jie was left alone. He could no longer work the fields, and each day found work as a hired hand in the village among the wealthy. Such labourers were generally provided only with a midday meal; breakfast and supper must be taken at home. Sun Jie had to work and cook for himself, often finding difficulty in balancing both. Moreover, with no one to care for the home, all was inconvenient. He wished to marry again, but lacked strength. Often recalling his wife's dying words, his heart was like a knife's cut. Thus passed half a year.

One day, it was his wife's birthday; he went to the grave to mourn and make offerings. Returning home, he saw from afar smoke rising from the kitchen, and was greatly puzzled. Hastening back, he found the rice cooked and dishes boiling, all waiting for him. Searching for the cook, he found no trace, and was doubly perplexed. Hungry, he ate the ready meal without further thought. Day after day, he went out to work as usual, and each day returned to find the meal prepared, the tea boiling, but no one to be seen cooking, and the doors and windows locked tight, with no sign of disturbance. This greatly astonished and delighted Sun Jie. At first he dared not tell others, but each day he returned slightly earlier than usual, hoping to surprise the cook. Yet the cook seemed forewarned and always left before he arrived. Sun Jie missed him several times.

One day, he took leave from work and left early, and at night borrowed a ladder from a neighbour, climbed the wall and looked into his kitchen. The sight so startled him that his very soul was shaken. He saw that the one cooking for him was a peerless beauty. Such a rare and precious thing!

If you ask who she was, even Sun Jie himself was not quite sure. The writer can only say that this will be explained in the next chapter.
