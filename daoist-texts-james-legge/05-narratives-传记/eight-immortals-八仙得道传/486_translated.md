# Chapter Eighteen: The Golden Mountain Becomes an Ancient Landmark — Repaying Kindness in the Life to Come

In the last chapter it was related how within a snail's shell was made a Taoist sanctuary, a place of solemn and peculiar interest. The nun Huìtōng had spoken of the chief Master of the sanctuary’s main altar, a lame Immortal surnamed Li. Now is the time to unfold the history and origin of this lame Immortal, and to recount the story of his success in attaining the Tao, of his aid in times of distress, and of his saving the world; and along with this, also to relate the tale of the Fairy He, who was connected with him by fate.

Have the gentlemen heard that in the geography of China there is a famous solitary mountain standing in the midst of a great river? That mountain is called the Golden Mountain; it is not a naturally formed mountain. Many thousands of years ago, it was not a mountain rising above the plain; indeed, there was not even ordinary land there, but only a vast expanse of water in the midstream of the Yangtze River. Until the middle of the Zhou dynasty, on the bank of the river, there was a great village, where lived a gentleman called Ma Shangyuan, who was half a scholar, half a farmer, half a recluse, and who did not serve in office. He had a daughter, both virtuous and comely, whom all called Ma the Eldest Miss. When the girl was over eighteen, she was married to a scholar of the same village, surnamed Gu, who was poor and destitute, and had a fierce and unbearable stepmother, Madame Yu. At first, the relations between the daughter-in-law and the mother-in-law were not so bad; but afterwards, when Madame Yu saw that neighbours and relatives were affectionate with her eldest daughter-in-law, she turned herself away in coldness, not wishing people to know that it was because of her own harsh temper, which was unlike the gentle nature of the eldest daughter-in-law; she suspected that Ma spoke ill of her before others. Thereupon a breach was made in the relationship between them. Moreover, Madame Yu was born with a heart full of prejudice, and such prejudice was fixed and unalterable. Though the eldest daughter-in-law strove diligently to observe filial duty in hope of softening her mother-in-law’s resentment, Madame Yu said, “She hides her malice deliberately, and acts these appearances to deceive others; but in her heart she bears a sharp knife, and would fain stab me to death!”

The eldest daughter-in-law, thus wronged, did not dare to speak to her husband. The scholar Gu was a son well versed in letters and reason, and a dutiful son besides. Knowing well the discord between his mother and wife, he dared not blame his mother; sometimes he would not even say a word of comfort to his wife. When he saw the sorrow on Ma’s face, he blamed her for showing such signs of trouble, as if she wished to displease her elders. Therefore the days of the eldest daughter-in-law grew harder to endure. The ill feeling between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law made the son caught in the midst more embarrassed and distressed. A once harmonious family was filled with clouds of sorrow on account of these disagreements.

Year after year passed without notice, six or seven years unknown; Madame Yu’s treatment of the eldest daughter-in-law grew ever harsher, and her cruel devices more and more strange. In short, there are many strange and strange villainies which the writer would find no difficulty in recording one by one; but as this book is not specially concerned with domestic affairs, the account of the Gu family’s matters is but a brief mention, naturally kept as simple as possible, so as not to provoke aversion. Enough has been said and expressed in a word.

The scholar Gu, grieved at his own impotence in managing the family affairs, and knowing that his wife was a woman of virtue and merit, and that she daily suffered unreasonable blows and insults from her stepmother, could not bear to add to her distress. On the other hand, Madame Yu, besides personally subjecting the eldest daughter-in-law to oppression, ceaselessly reproached her son, saying that if he did not help his mother to chastise his wife he was rebellious to his mother and favoured his wife, committing the great offence of disobedience. The poor young couple were at their wits' end, in a desperate plight. At first the scholar Gu also assisted his mother in blaming his wife; but as his mother’s methods grew more violent, and his wife was beaten almost to skin and fleshlessness, his feelings of pity were stirred. Who has not a heart of compassion, especially for the one who shares his bed? How could he not suffer? Yet his mother branded him with the name of rebel. How could he endure such days?

Heaven did not utterly forsake him, but left him a way to live. Though the mother provided meals regularly, the young couple often had one meal or none; if they had midday meal, there was no supper. In wintertime, the mother would not allow the least chill to touch her person; but the two were scantily clad, shivering together, looking indeed a pitiful sight. Hunger and cold so extreme, together with the hardship of cooking and the severity of blows and threats, made the couple’s faces as withered as those of hungry ghosts. Knowing that days so difficult would last long, and that they were still young and could bear some hardships, the scholar Gu feared that if matters should come to want of rice and clothing in his mother’s sixth decade of life, how could he support himself? Therefore he early sought relatives and friends outside to find some employment, partly to earn wages for supporting his parents, partly to avoid much trouble. He had told this to his wife before. She, pitying her husband’s toils, was willing he should leave home early. So the scholar Gu resolved to seek his fortune elsewhere. At that time a friend recommended him to a merchant to assist in trade and commerce. Merchants of those days were not highly regarded by the world; the order was from scholar and farmer to merchant, clearly lowering the social rank some two or three degrees.

But the scholar Gu had no thought for such distinctions; so long as the business was honest and could support his family, and he could answer to his superiors without shame, what matter was the rank of the business? With farewells to mother and wife, he set out joyfully. The night before his departure, the husband and wife sat silently opposite each other, feeling that a thousand words clamoured to be spoken, yet none could be uttered. They sat thus till dawn, both unaware of their broken hearts, shedding tears like rain. The scholar Gu said only: “I know all; you must merely perform your rites and duties; there is no need to say anything more, nor to speak at all, for I think you would not. Since it is so, we may part here. When I have some success, I shall come to see you again!” The eldest daughter-in-law was even less able to speak, but only acquiesced, nodding her consent. The two parted with tears filling their eyes.

The scholar Gu was a man of talent and noble character, who had abandoned letters for commerce, which was a great underemployment of his gifts; naturally he had no difficulty in his new calling. After half a year his employer trusted him greatly, and he sent home his wages in succession. The days of mother and daughter-in-law grew harder after his departure.

It was rare that Ma the Eldest Miss could act both as wife and son, and she was especially diligent in her filial devotion; yet though she contrived by all means to earn money to support Madame Yu, that lady accused her of having an affair, saying, “If not, how could a woman have such skill to earn money outside?” This reached Ma’s ears, more severe than all the insults of six or seven years put together. She was suddenly enraged, and fainted for a long time. Madame Yu took no notice, and said she was feigning death to frighten her. But the eldest daughter-in-law did revive, and Madame Yu felt confirmed in her suspicions, saying, “This vile woman is so cunning; even if she should really die, I will not trouble myself about her.” Ma, though full of resentment, thought of dying to prove her resolve; but then she reconsidered, saying, ‘Though she be unkind, I cannot fail in filial duty to her; besides, when my husband left, how did he charge me? If I take my own life lightly, who will support this aged mother?’ So she forced down the bitterness of her wrongs, enduring them with all her might. The feud continued for some time.

The money sent by the scholar Gu was received by Madame Yu, who cared only for her own comfort, no longer inquiring about the well-being of the eldest daughter-in-law. Having money enough for living, she felt no need of the eldest daughter-in-law, whom she regarded as a thorn in her side, and planned to drive her out. She sought everywhere to sell her, whether as concubine or maid, caring not for the price, so long as she was quickly gone. Poor Ma, confined to the women's quarters, knew nothing of such cruel schemes! At this time a villain of the same village, called the Living Tiger, hearing that Ma was both talented and beautiful, had long harboured ill designs, but was foiled by her chastity and self-restraint. Hearing the news, he rejoiced exceedingly, hastened to send people to negotiate, and agreed on the price in silver, with wedding to be conducted two days later.

The next day Madame Yu suddenly called Ma, and spoke to her with gentle words and kindly manner. Ma was amazed; Madame Yu said, “In former years your father-in-law was ill, and a vow was made at the River God’s temple; afterwards your father-in-law died, and I forgot to fulfill the vow. But last night I had a dream, in which the River God sent someone to reproach me for my breach of faith. I said, ‘How dare I forget the vow? It is only because of my old age and weakness that I have delayed!’ Then the messenger said, ‘Since that is so, you may send your daughter-in-law in your stead; that will serve as well.’ When I awoke, the vision was vivid, not at all forgotten. This matter is surely most true and not false. Good daughter-in-law, I know you do not often go out, but now for the sake of the family, you must go and speak for me. When your husband returns, he will surely be grateful to you!”

Since her marriage, Ma had never known such favour. Moreover, she had never once refused an order from her mother-in-law; now, for this small matter, she humbled herself so, was this not strange? She thought these things in her heart, but outwardly only obeyed. Returning to her room she pondered long, but could find no reason for it. The next morning she made ready hurriedly. Madame Yu said, “The carriage is outside; daughter-in-law, get in quickly and go!” Ma was alarmed, and asked, “Mother, why have you hired a carriage? Though weak, can I not walk these seven or eight li? Why need a carriage? It wastes your money.” Madame Yu laughed, “Not so. It will take you half a day to go and come, leaving me alone at home in loneliness. With a carriage, it will be quicker. Fortunately your husband has sent money enough for the household. The small cost of carriage and horse is nothing. Daughter-in-law, do not hesitate, go quickly and return early! Lest I wait long in vain!”

Ma knew this journey must be some trick, with little hope of good; but she could not guess what device was used or what was intended. Believing that she was ready to die, and that death was preferable to all else, she put on a cheerful face, bade farewell to Madame Yu, and went out the gate. Seeing the carriage and many men, she understood more and guessed the scheme. With no choice, she mounted the carriage.

After three or four li, the carriage turned aside, not toward the River God’s temple. Ma then suspected something, lifted the curtain, and asked the men, “Stop the carriage a moment; I have a question to ask.” The men obeyed. The driver took the reins and stopped the carriage. Ma, calm and smiling, asked, “Are you sent by my mother-in-law to take me to the River God’s temple?” The men looked surprised, and said, “We are sent by Lord Liu of West Market Town to fetch the lady; how is it you do not know?” The leader nodded and said, “I think I understand; the young lady does not wish to marry Lord Liu, but your mother-in-law forces you; is that so?” Ma answered nothing.

The men asked the leader, “How do you know?” He laughed, “This is very clear. If the grandmother arranged the marriage and gave orders, it would be straightforward, no need for such secrecy. Moreover, I fear the young lady’s anger; the house is so poor, the River God’s temple is not far; why such fuss? This is a slip that leaves the grandmother helpless. When the young lady asks, that will be discovered. So the grandmother told me beforehand: ‘If the young lady asks anything, just answer her lightly; do not say more.’ This was to prevent a leak. But the young lady calmly took the carriage without a word, careless indeed; no wonder she was caught!”

Ma had no time to argue. Her heart was like seventeen or eighteen deer running wild; she knew not if the taste was bitter, sour, sweet, or spicy! She sat stiffly, fixing her clear eyes, dumb, not knowing what to do. The drivers saw she said nothing and called out; the carriage started again. Ma thought long, seeing the carriage hastening forward; knowing she could not make them return, she thought of going back home, but knew her mother-in-law would not tolerate it. If she returned to her parents’ home, they were long dead, no siblings remained but a cousin, who was also not a good person. Perhaps this matter was in league with the cousin. So to retreat was difficult, and there was no place to retreat to. To go forward and marry another would lose her chastity and her husband’s honour, which Ma the Eldest Miss would not do. If she went to Liu’s house, that Liu was a notorious villain, and would not spare her. Thus, caught in a dilemma, death seemed the lesser evil. Thinking so, she clenched her teeth until they clicked, and hardened her heart, turning to the path of death. She sought quickly a way to kill herself, lest entering another’s house bring further complications. While pondering, the carriage stopped again, saying a boat was to be taken across the river. Liu’s bridal boat was already moored by the shore. Hearing this, Ma was filled with joy. Two bridesmaids came aboard and opened the curtain, inviting the bride to alight. Ma, having resolved her mind, stepped down boldly, leaning on the bridesmaids’ shoulders as they led her to the riverbank. Just as she stepped on board, she suddenly stretched out both hands, pushing the bridesmaids into the boat, and swiftly leapt into the river; a splash was heard, and the waves bore away a chaste woman upon the clear current. The others hastened to rescue her, but the river was deep and turbulent; rescue was impossible. After a brief disturbance, they gave up and returned to report to the Living Tiger. The Living Tiger had just opened wide his mouth to feast, but suddenly lost this fresh morsel, and was furious. Unlucky he was: those who fetched the bride suffered his blows and curses in vain.

Now, after Ma had plunged into the river, borne by the waves downstream, there chanced to be a Taoist, more than a hundred years old, with white beard and hair, yet vigorous in spirit. He was crossing the river, steering his boat slowly. He chanced to see the woman floating downstream, not knowing if she was alive or dead. Moved by compassion, he resolved to save her. But he was a man who had never touched a woman in his whole life, from youth to old age; now, aged so, he was unwilling to break his lifelong vow for this woman. If he resolved not to touch her, how could he save her, when the river was swift and the chance fleeting?

After a moment’s reflection, he resolutely said, “I would rather lose my vow than see death without aid.” Drawing near, he thrust a pole under her body, then crouched and pulled her aboard. But Ma had been drowned too long; her spirit was gone, and she was beyond hope. The Taoist thought: since life is gone, the corpse must be taken up and buried properly. He exerted all his strength to haul her aboard. But her swollen belly and bloated bones made the task difficult; halfway done, there was a crack as he broke off one leg of the corpse. Then a great wave struck and overturned the Taoist’s boat. Though the Taoist struggled, he could not save the corpse; he himself, knowing something of swimming, escaped with life, but the body of Ma floated away, lost. The Taoist, once ashore, reflected that though he meant to save, he had ruined a person; not only was this cruel, it was a great violation of his lifelong vows. He thought he had never done such evil in his life, but now at death’s door had wrought this great disaster. His conscience was troubled day and night; he became insane and died within a few months.

Ma’s spirit was taken by the River God to the Crystal Palace. The Dragon King honoured her chastity and filial piety with great respect, and explained her former life, which made her heart clear. The Dragon King smiled, saying, “You have a fellow traveler, one who shares your exile and guilt; for a matter such as this, if you pass this life, in the next you shall be exiled together again, cultivating the Tao and returning to truth. This person in this life is a Taoist, devout and strict in discipline, now more than a hundred years old. Because of saving you, he injured your corpse, and grieves bitterly; he will soon also pass away.”

Ma was moved, saying, “For my miserable fate alone, another has suffered; not only must I die, but even after death I involve the good in misfortune; is it not dreadful?” The Dragon King answered, “This is his fate. Though he died because of you, it is not really your fault. But he committed the sin of wounding a corpse unknowingly; in the next life he may suffer some bodily defect. Fortunately it does not affect his life or merit.” Ma felt still more compassion. After some exhortation, the Dragon King ceased.

After some time, the scholar Gu returned laden with gains. It happened that Madame Yu had died a few days before. Grieving, the scholar Gu inquired among friends and relatives about the wife’s martyrdom; he was overwhelmed with sorrow, and cast all the treasures he had earned into the river at the place where his wife had drowned. He himself abandoned the family and pursued the Tao, whereabouts unknown.

The matter was reported to the Crystal Palace. The Dragon King summoned Ma to explain the cause, saying, “The virtuous couple’s chastity, loyalty, and filial piety are esteemed by gods and men alike. The husband has already become a recluse; his future is boundless. The wife will soon be sent by me to the netherworld, then reborn. After a thousand years’ cultivation, she will attain fulfilment. I, considering their virtues and sufferings, have ordered the River God to raise at the place where the wife made her sacrifice, by the power of the treasure cast by her husband, a solitary island to emerge in the river, to be a place for future generations to venerate and remember them. The decree has long been given; it will soon be fulfilled.” Ma thanked with deep gratitude.

Later, the mountain indeed arose from the river; men knowing the cause called it the “Golden Mountain.” Over the centuries it grew higher and broader, and remains to this day a famous place of scenic beauty in China. This is another tale, left untold here.

It is said that Ma’s soul, after being sent by the Dragon King, was reborn in a family surnamed He at the foot of the Golden Mountain. She was born able to speak, with a clear spirit and no darkness; from infancy she refused to eat meat or fish. As she grew, she resolved to cultivate the Tao. Her father He Jie and mother Liu were honest and kind folk who believed deeply in Immortals and Buddhas; seeing their daughter’s devotion, they did not oppose her. Ten years passed swiftly. The girl’s milk-name was Lanxian. Finding little progress at home, she asked her parents to let her go far afield to seek Immortals to teach her the great Tao. He Jie and his wife were somewhat unwilling; past forty, she was their only child, and to let her go far would trouble them and leave them lonely. They discussed with Lanxian, hoping to wait until more children were born before letting her go. Lanxian had not yet consented.

While they hesitated, a young Taoist surnamed Li came to call. He Jie was surprised, and asked his daughter where she knew this Taoist. Lanxian was puzzled. Father and daughter went out to meet him. The Taoist was graceful and handsome, with a noble bearing and an ethereal presence; Lanxian felt she had seen him before. The Taoist looked at Lanxian with a strange expression. Advancing, he saluted them. They quickly returned his greeting, asking his Taoist name and place. The Taoist sat and smiled, saying, “My surname is Li, given name Xuan; I am from Henan. I have fateful ties with the young lady from a former life. When I was reborn, thinking of the lady’s former life, I came specially to meet and resolve our predestined ties.” He then related the causes and effects, and departed.

Thus it is that Ma’s soul, not forgetting the Golden Mountain and the Taoist who had suffered for her, was reborn as a daughter in the He family at the foot of the Golden Mountain. From an infant she spoke with intelligence, took no flesh food, wore no fine clothes, and vowed never to marry. From seven years old, a mysterious female Taoist appeared in human form to instruct her. The girl, born with past-life wisdom, recognized the woman as a true Immortal descended, and sought her teachings earnestly. But she never forgot her past life, and wished to find the reincarnation of that Taoist, so that when he became an Immortal, she might transcend the mortal and attain the Tao. The mysterious woman praised her resolve, saying, “This is fate, not to be forced. But I know that the old Taoist was reborn in a family surnamed Li in Henan, and will become a disciple of the Taoist Patriarch Laozi. Since you have vowed to wait for him, wait till he attains the Tao, then I will send him to meet you.” She then taught her many formulas for refining Qi, nurturing the mind, guiding the body, and fasting, as well as several arts of self-defence, such as invisibility and flying swords. The girl received all, and the mysterious woman departed. The girl then devoted herself to cultivation at home, awaiting the arrival of the Immortal Li to transcend. The reader should observe that this is none other than the Fairy He of the Eight Immortals. Because of her association with the lame Immortal Li Xuan, we first record his story.

Now we return to the matter of the lame Immortal. At that time in Luoyang there was an official family, surnamed Li, given name Qi. The lady You bore a single son, named Li Xuan. At his birth, she dreamed a Taoist embraced her; when she awoke, the room was filled with strange fragrance, and the infant had already been born.

The parents knew their child was of some note, and cherished him. Li Xuan was of strange nature; he did not desire office but sought to become a recluse and cultivate the Tao. Often he spoke to his parents of his former life, saying, “I was once an old Taoist, kindly and upright, who never did the least wrong. Unexpectedly, at the end of that life, in saving a woman, I wounded her corpse; this is my greatest grief and I have never forgotten it. After I attain the Tao, I must first find that woman and repent before her; only then can I complete my attainment.”

His father Li Qi thought him mad, and only scolded him for such nonsense. His mother believed in the Immortals, knowing there was cause, and comforted him kindly. Li Xuan paid no heed. After more than ten years, Venus (the planet Venus, the Golden Star) was commissioned by the Taoist Patriarch Laozi to descend on the Li household, causing Li Qi and his wife and family to kneel and burn incense in greeting. Venus smiled and said, “Doctor and madam, pray do not be so formal; I am a humble Taoist, come because of my predestined relation with the young master. I ask the doctor to allow the young master to come out to speak.” Li Qi, fearing his son would be taken away by the Immortal, hesitated much; but his wife at once sent for Li Xuan. Li Xuan, seeing Venus, as if meeting an old acquaintance, bowed eight times low. Venus took his hand and laughed, “A thousand years have passed; do you still remember me?” He patted him thrice on the neck. Li Xuan suddenly recalled the events nine lives before, and knelt, saying, “Master, save your disciple from the sea of suffering.” Venus laughed coldly, “There is no such easy Immortal in the world. If Immortals were so easy, they would be no different from mortals.” Li Xuan understood, and said, “Master, lead me on; I will suffer disaster and forsake the red dust, and will never regret it.” Li Qi, hearing this, was greatly alarmed and tried to stop him; Venus raised his sleeve, and at once a golden light filled the room, blinding all. Where the light passed, Venus and Li Xuan vanished.

Whither Li Xuan went is unknown; we await the next chapter to unfold.
