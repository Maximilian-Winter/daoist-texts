# Chapter 025: The Old Lord’s Verses on Cause and Effect — Li Xuan’s Loss of the Dharma Body Amidst the Fire Calamity

Now it happened that Li Xuan, having received the Old Lord’s commands, returned home to enlighten his parents, that they might together ascend the immortal realm. Li Qi and his wife were both originally endowed with good roots; Li Qi himself was a loyal and upright minister in the court. In all cases, loyal ministers and filial children have the most upright hearts, and are nearest to immortality. Moreover, having received the elixir from Li Xuan, they had already cast away the grosser elements of worldly dust and vapour. At this time their spirits were clear and their aspirations lofty; awakened by Li Xuan’s single word, the couple at once attained great enlightenment, casting away all earthly ties clean and absolute. Both entered the mountains to cultivate the Way, and after fifty years were delivered by Li Xuan to become earth-immortals. Such was the end of Li Qi and his wife, which the book mentions no more.

Having completed the matter of his parents, Li Xuan then thought of his second concern. He returned to seek the Master’s permission. The Old Lord, before he could speak, smiled and said: ‘Thy parents have already been enlightened by thee, having returned to the right path and cultivated the Way; this is indeed cause for joy. Now thou mayest repay the long-cherished vow made at birth, and then there was one who asked thee to preside over a Taoist assembly. The master of that assembly, though not of my school, is yet a disciple of the Way. In time ye shall have occasion to work together; thou must watch attentively and receive him well.’ Li Xuan bowed and asked: ‘May I inquire, Master, where shall this ancient vow be repaid?’ The Old Lord cried out: ‘I have a verse for thee to remember clearly: “To fast from grains is not enough; when the cart is light, the road is familiar. If thou wouldst regain thine old form and frame, thou must meet the new visage.”’ He added: ‘One comes from the place of right and wrong, and goes to the land of right and wrong. The one thou seekest is still keeping watch for thee at home; thou must see him before he can go forth to cultivate the Way.’

Li Xuan, hearing this, was suddenly enlightened. He took his leave of the Old Lord, and mounting a cloud came first to the Green Mist Cave. Yang Ren knelt and admitted him within. Li Xuan examined his recent progress in cultivation and found it advancing swiftly, whereupon he was greatly pleased and gave him some words of praise. He then instructed: ‘I have newly received from the Master the technique of soul-travel. After seven days have passed, the stubborn shell may be discarded; then burn my body with fire without hesitation. Because the soul clings to the body, at the time of return it must reunite with the stubborn shell; when ascending to Heaven there will be more trouble. It is better to burn it early. But before seven days are complete, do not burn it rashly, lest my soul and body fail to separate; at the time of return, the soul will have no place to rest, and shall become a wandering spirit.’ Yang Ren responded with a humble ‘Yes, sir’ in obedience. Li Xuan lay stiff upon the bed, silently chanting spells, and his soul had already gone forth, straight to the southern lands.

From the summit of Golden Mountain he gazed once upon the river landscape, and his mind and heart were greatly refreshed. Journeying thence to the foot of Golden Mountain, he inquired and heard that the maiden He of that family had many strange tales of cultivation. Rejoicing, he said: ‘Here indeed may my ancient vow be fulfilled.’ So he went to seek an audience. The maiden He Lan had been cultivating at home for more than twenty years. This night, in a dream, the Mysterious Maiden came to instruct her: ‘The one thou art to wait for surnamed Li, named Xuan, is a disciple of the Old Lord. He has attained the Way before thee. He also vowed to see thee go forth to seek the Way in monastic life, before he himself shall attain the perfect fruit. This man shall arrive at noon on the morrow; thou must wait well for his coming. I go now.’ With these words she vanished. Lan was greatly alarmed, yet enlightened, and recalled the dream as vividly as if it were reality. Early next morning she told her parents, who said: ‘The immortal’s dream is surely no error. Our daughter must sincerely await this immortal’s coming.’ Lan assented.

At noon indeed Li Xuan arrived. Lan was both startled and joyful; she changed into a new Daoist robe, took her dust whisk, and lightly came forth to meet Li Xuan, and they bowed to each other. Lan first smiled and said: ‘Last night the Mysterious Maiden revealed in dream that the immortal elder would surely arrive this noon. I have waited long in respectful anticipation.’ Li Xuan smiled and replied: ‘I dare not accept such praise. Poor Daoist and the fair lady were exiled together for ten generations, and may be called comrades out of the world. The matters of past lives fill my heart with regret at all times. Now happily the fairy lady has returned to the true path, not hiding her true spirit; in future there is hope of golden immortality, and the perfect fruit may be set before us. I cannot but admire with all my heart.’ Lan laughed and said: ‘The immortal elder’s praise is too great for me to deserve. I was born fond of the Way, and having been instructed by the Mysterious Maiden, I know somewhat of the path. But because my vow is so firm, I desire to see with my own eyes the immortal elder attain the Way and ascend to Heaven; only then shall I myself return to truth and take my fate. To behold the immortal elder’s countenance radiant, and to hear that the Mysterious Maiden has said he has bowed to the Master’s school, and that his future is vast beyond measure, this indeed fills me with joy beyond all hope.’ Li Xuan heard and could not but rise soberly, offering thanks repeatedly. Thus the two conversed for several days upon the arts of cultivation and the secrets of entry, delving deeper than the lessons formerly given by the Mysterious Maiden, and Lan expressed her gratitude.

Unaware, six days passed. Li Xuan urged Lan to take this opportunity to enter monastic life, to travel among famous mountains and great rivers, to seek renowned teachers and virtuous friends, that she might strengthen body and bones, cast off worldly ties, and thus lay the foundation for success in the Way. Lan bowed her head to receive instruction. That evening, Lan paid obeisance to her parents, expressing her intention to enter monastic life. When her parents sought to detain her, Li Xuan raised his sleeve, and Lan saw a great round portal, within which were palatial chambers and flowering trees, spacious and splendid, such as the world had never seen. Lan’s heart brightened, and she leapt forward into the gate. Her parents saw before them suddenly a city wall of empty space, of the same colour as Li Xuan’s robe, but Lan was held outside the wall and gate; though they heard her clearly call out ‘Father and mother, take care; your daughter goes now’, they could see her nowhere. After a while the wall vanished, and all was once more their own home; Li Xuan and Lan knew not where she had gone. Knowing Li Xuan had come specially to enlighten their daughter, her parents could do nothing; besides, in recent years they had borne other children and no longer thought on Lan, allowing her to go her way in cultivation. This matter the book does not further relate.

As for Li Xuan, having led Lan outside the gate, he no longer saw her again. A cloud carried her to a natural stone cave upon the summit of Mount Heng in the south. Lan hid within his sleeve for a while, when suddenly a voice called near her ear: ‘Immortal Lady He, Immortal Lady He, this is the place of thy cultivation. Work diligently for ten years, and great masters shall surely come forth to advance thee. Take care well; be not diligent at first and slack at the end, lest Heaven’s judgement fall, bringing calamity. Take heed, take heed; I go now.’

Lan opened her eyes and found herself upon a great mountain, whose scenery was marvelously like that within Li Xuan’s sleeve. She sighed at the wondrous workings of the immortals, filled with mingled admiration and envy. From that time forth, Immortal Lady He dwelt alone in the stone chamber of Mount Heng, cultivating. Within five years she had already cast away the smoke and fire of mortal life, each day seeking only fruits in the mountain to eat; sometimes she could go ten or fifteen days without food or drink, feeling neither hunger nor thirst. Later still, the Mysterious Maiden descended in person and took her as disciple, teaching her a secret scripture of the Jade Void, and Immortal Lady He’s progress then became especially rapid. This is a later tale, to be related in due course.

Meanwhile, let us hasten to speak again of Li Xuan. After sending Immortal Lady He to Mount Tai, six days had passed since their going and coming. On the journey, Li Xuan felt the strings of his heart stirred, as if some matter were afoot. For immortals fear most the movement of the heart; once the heart moves, great events must follow. Often a faint thought may bring forth great calamity and invoke Heaven’s judgement. Though Li Xuan could foresee somewhat, unless he made calculations he could not be sure. Now he paused in mid-air, gathered his mind, and silently made calculations. But mischievous spirits were at work; matters ordinarily small and easily divined now became vague and unclear. It seemed that some calamity hung over him; yet also it seemed there was no hindrance. As the vulgar saying goes: ‘Matters not concerning the heart confuse those whose hearts are concerned.’ Li Xuan, for his part, was disturbed in mind because the matter concerned himself; naturally his spirit could not be united. This must be so; save for a few celestial leaders, none can escape this circle. The Buddhists call ‘no self and no ego’ the highest achievement; it is for this very reason.

Since Li Xuan could not make clear calculation, he suddenly remembered the Master’s words at parting, and that four-line verse. Though still unable to guess the full meaning, the Master’s tone was calm, and so he thought no great matter was impending. He composed himself and hastened back on a cloud. Yet entering his cave abode, he found all strange: not only was Yang Ren missing, but his own stubborn body was nowhere to be found. Sitting down, he recalculated, and then understood.

It happened that after Li Xuan’s departure, Yang Ren indeed kept watch over Li Xuan’s body with trembling care, not daring to move a step. Six days had nearly passed, and half a day more would be the appointed time for burning the body. He was doubling his vigilance when suddenly a countryman rushed into the cave. Yang Ren recognised him as his own neighbour, Zhou Xiao Guan’er, who from childhood had studied and played with Yang Ren, though long unseen. Yang Ren was greatly surprised but still guarded Li Xuan’s body, not stirring or rising, but urgently inquired why he had come, and whether there was any urgent matter. Xiao Guan, somewhat recovered from breathlessness, said that Yang Ren’s mother lay at death’s door, and earnestly awaited Yang Ren’s return. Xiao Guan had come on his behalf.

The reader may well remember that when Yang Ren came to Mount Tai, he was sent by Li Xuan to move his mother to the region of Tai’an, only a hundred li or so from the Green Mist Cave. Zhou Xiao Guan was a merchant trading north and south, and whenever he came north he visited Yang’s mother; he had also before been to the Green Mist Cave. Now by chance he was at Yang’s home, and seeing Yang’s mother gravely ill, thought of her son, and so made the journey up the mountain to summon Yang Ren home. Yang Ren, hearing this, was both surprised and pained, and much troubled. If he returned now, he feared he would fail the Master’s commission and delay his great work of cultivation; if he did not return, he feared it might be too late to say farewell to his mother. The matter was a dilemma, and he knew not what to do. He stood before Xiao Guan in a daze, speechless. Xiao Guan urged him: ‘Brother Yang, what say you? Thy mother, holding out her last breath, waits solely for thy return to take farewell. How canst thou stand by a corpse and play the fool? If thou delay, and thy mother departs without seeing thee, would it not be a lifelong regret and sorrow beyond all reckoning?’ Then with tears Yang Ren said: ‘I will not hide it from Brother Zhou. This lying here is my Master; he is not dead, but has undergone such a matter. Only one day’s duty remains to me; how can I leave?’

Zhou Xiao Guan laughed aloud: ‘No wonder thy mother says thou hast become obsessed with learning the Way, grown somewhat foolish. A man dead six days cannot return to life. Even if thy Master be a man of the Way, he allowed seven days; thou hast guarded him six and a half; half a day more will make seven. Can there be such a coincidence that he returns at just this moment? Would he not be mocking thee? In my view, thou hast done ninety-nine parts for thy Master; missing this last would not incur blame. But thy mother’s hour is the last chance for mother and son to meet. Weigh the matter carefully, and decide which comes first.’

Yang Ren hesitated: ‘If I follow what you say, what of my Master’s dharma body?’ Zhou Xiao Guan smiled: ‘Is that not easy? Just as thy Master commanded, so do thou. Is not that settled?’ Yang Ren said: ‘If perchance my Master does not return early, nor come late, but just now returns, I have been his disciple, and have received his great kindness, which I have never repaid; yet I destroy his body, leaving his soul nowhere to rest. Then though I were to break my body in pieces, it would be too late. What then?’ Having spoken he bowed over Li Xuan’s body and wept aloud. The hand that touched it felt Li Xuan’s dharma body as cold as ice, without a trace of warmth; he was startled and told this to Xiao Guan. Xiao Guan cried out: ‘Then awaken from thy dream! A man dead six days will rot; what hope hast thou for his return? If thy Master were truly an immortal, immortals do not die so easily. Moreover, immortals most carefully consider the body’s ascension; the body is naturally discarded. Burning it therefore does no harm. If the Master cannot part with this stubborn shell, then he is no immortal at all. Good brother, do not delay; thy mother is about to breathe her last. She has summoned her strength to wait for thee; how canst thou attend to thy Master alone, and not thy mother who gave thee life?’

Yang Ren, hearing this, was sorely grieved and had no time for further thought. He immediately rose, knelt before his Master’s body, and bowed his head countless times, weeping bitterly without ceasing. Until midnight was past and dawn was near, then Zhou Xiao Guan came and gathered men to arrange the funeral.

Alas, such ritual proprieties were not understood by Yang Ren, nor even by the author of the book, who professes himself a man of the world and not a Taoist adept; moreover, times past and present differ, and funeral rites now used are not necessarily those of old. Rather than pretending proficiency and inviting ridicule, it is better to conceal one’s ignorance. Besides, in the course of the story the reader is eager to learn how Li Xuan regains his soul after losing his dharma body; there is no time to dwell upon such trifling ceremonies. We shall pass this over without further mention.

To know how Li Xuan regains his soul, we must await the next chapter.
