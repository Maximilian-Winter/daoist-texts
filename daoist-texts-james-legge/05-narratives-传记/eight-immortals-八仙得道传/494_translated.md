# Chapter 26: Borrowing a Body and Attaching a Soul to Become Iron Crutch — The Disciple Cries Over the Loss of His Master and Mother

It is related that Li Xuan returned to Mount Tai, and beheld the cave gate wide open; no human figure was to be seen, and even his own stubborn body was nowhere to be found. Counting on his fingers, he knew the certainty of the matter. For at this time Li Xuan knew that his corporeal frame would surely be incinerated in advance by Yang Ren, and in his heart he entertained no doubt. Knowing too that the heart’s agitation and the spirit’s distraction on the midway course were the cause, he recalled the verses of the Old Lord, and in his heart was suddenly enlightened; his countenance was calm, and his reckoning of the matter was most accurate. Yet he had not fully resolved the verse concerning the new visage—could it be that he still had hope of returning to his body? He stood for a while, yet understood not fully.

At first he was vexed at Yang Ren, who though anxious to visit his mother, ought not to have disobeyed the master’s injunction, thereby causing the master’s soul to wander and be cast adrift, without any place of reliance. Afterwards he reckoned that Yang Ren’s mother was already dead, and though Yang Ren hurried back, he could not utter a single word, nor receive any parting instructions. The mind of an immortal is after all different from that of ordinary men. Li Xuan's thoughts went thus far, and he forgot not only his own pain and peril, but suddenly took up the boundless grievances of Yang Ren. Then he turned his thoughts again: "It is I who have harmed him. Had I not indulged in this spirit-travel game, he might not have needed to guard my body, saving much effort and trouble, and the mother and son might not have lost the chance to speak together. But now all is as if they saw each other not; all this has arisen from my small play, is it not a great sin?" Recalling the Taoist scriptures he had studied, he remembered the methods of restoring life to the dead: "If I could instantly enter, so long as her corpse is not decayed, I might restore her to life for ten or eight years, and so atone for my fault; would this not be a great marvel? What I regret is that my own cultivation has not yet reached the time of corpse liberation, nor can my flesh ascend to the immortal realm; having no stubborn shell to serve as a vessel to attach my soul to, with the lapse of days and years my soul will gradually dissipate, and then my life will be insecure, how can I pursue the Way?" Thinking thus, he hesitated.

After a while he resolutely said: "This is my fate; life and death are fixed by Heaven. Why should I indulge in such distant anxieties and fail to act as an immortal should? Rather the rescue of Yang’s mother is urgent; if it can be done and I do not do it, is it not adding one more great sin to me?" Having fixed his resolve, he rose swiftly, issued forth from the cave, and mounting a cloud, prepared to take his journey southward.

Suddenly there came a swift cloud of auspicious vapour from the northeast corner, like a flying arrow, and it seized Li Xuan’s cloud. Li Xuan opened his eyes and looked, and was greatly joyful, saying: "Senior Brother Wenshi, whence come you? Do you know aught of my affairs?" The Perfected One Wenshi smiled and said: "Were it not for your karmic debts of former lives, how should I have leisure to see you?" Li Xuan was much astonished and said: "Pray, Senior Brother, I have but one grievance in life, concerning the matter of Mount Jin; now in obedience to the Master’s command I have conveyed the maiden of the He family to Mount Heng; how then is there yet karmic debt?" Wenshi sighed and said: "In the world, only those who cultivate the Way have the greatest success, the highest character, and live as long as Heaven and Earth, enduring as the sun and moon, with infinite enjoyment. But also it is only they, and none others, who bear the greatest responsibilities and encounter the greatest difficulties. You say you have delivered the maiden of the He family and so your debts are ended; little do you know that this is but one obligation of conscience fulfilled, and that there is yet an unintentional karmic bond which you have forgotten."

Li Xuan, hearing this, was still at a loss. Wenshi sighed again: "It is no wonder you cannot remember, since it was originally unintentional. How could you recall? There are two matters in your former life that were done with good intent but became evil, and you yourself have not perceived them, or though perceived, have thought them unrelated. First, you vowed from childhood to avoid women, and for over a hundred years have never touched even a hair of a woman, yet one hundred years later you had this close connection with a woman already dead. Second, you failed to save that woman, but broke her leg bones; fortunately her root foundation was deep, and the Dragon King granted her an elixir, so that she was not maimed in this life. Had she been an ordinary person, the sickness that caused her death in former life would have followed her into this life, and though her leg was broken after death, the result would have been as if she had died from a broken leg. If this were so, would it not be your sin? Brother, do not say that the affairs of the immortals are everywhere merciful, and that a small inadvertent fault will surely not incur Heaven’s punishment; how is it known that the more one is heavenly, the less debt one may incur? Your present misfortune is precisely occasioned by the repayment of debt. The Ancestor Master long ago calculated for you that this misfortune would come. It is called misfortune, but indeed it is repayment; if this debt be not repaid, there will be no attainment of the Tao. Therefore, this misfortune is not your ill fortune, but indeed a matter for joy and congratulation."

Li Xuan, hearing this, was as if intoxicated and entranced, trembling with awe. Wenshi smiled and comforted him. Li Xuan then asked: "Since matters have come to this, surely you have a method to save me?" Wenshi laughed aloud: "How could there be no method? If your compassion had gone so far as to be irreparable, Heaven would not be so cruel. But you were originally a handsome and comely youth, and now you must inevitably become a sorry and sordid figure, with one leg imperfect; this is a method of your debt repayment. Look at what I hold in my hand—what is it but a crutch prepared for you to use when lame? Brother, do not despise this gift; on examination it has some history." Li Xuan, listening, was somewhat entranced; he took the crutch, speechless. Wenshi laughed again: "This crutch was made at the very first Peach Banquet in the Queen Mother’s Garden. One of the peach-pickers, through carelessness, broke off a branch. The Queen Mother gave this broken branch to the Ancestor Master. Though a dried branch, it can discern fair weather and foul, know cold and heat, and serve as a weapon; ordinary demons and goblins dare not face this crutch. When I first entered the sect I did not know its use; I asked the Ancestor Master, who related its origin and then bestowed it upon your humble brother. Now it is just right to be your magic treasure; as it is said, things come by fate, and this gift to you is just the most fitting." Li Xuan then understood, and hastened to bow and thank him.

Wenshi, laughing, drew Li Xuan up, and said: "Brother, do not be ceremonious; come with me to seek your transformed body." Li Xuan followed, crutch in hand, riding down the cloud, and they stood upon a patch of wild grass. Wenshi pointed to a spot beneath a tree, saying: "Brother, there is your substitute." The two immortals walked hand in hand to the place. Li Xuan, anxious, went first, and fixed his eyes upon the object; it was a dead beggar, black and ugly, one leg longer than the other. Li Xuan was startled, and bent to feel him, but found the body cold as ice, plainly long dead. Seeing his substitute so filthy and loathsome, Li Xuan’s heart was displeased. Wenshi came up and, seeing his stupor and silence, laughed aloud: "Though a god and immortal, must you also be particular about a fine countenance?" Li Xuan mused: "Senior Brother, it is not so. Immortals take their law and magic for their principle, roaming beyond Heaven and Earth, and naturally need not be comely or fair; but this dead beggar’s appearance is excessively ugly. When my cultivation is complete, I must accompany you to meet the heavenly golden immortals and true gods of the three realms, all of whom have a dignified and splendid mien; but I alone have this sorry visage. Not to say that others despise me as sordid, even I myself cannot but feel ashamed of my form. Good Senior Brother, could you devise a method to cast off this dead beggar, and let me find another, somewhat fairer dead man to be my substitute? Would such be possible?" Wenshi laughed heartily: "Brother, I say not that you are ignorant, but I fear that even though you have attained the Tao, your words betray one not of the profession. Know you not that the immortals prize above all the word 'fate'? What fate binds, no man can sever. It is as though my brother and I, in these words, have come together by fate, unawares. If not so, you could not have summoned me."

Li Xuan would not wait for him to finish, but smiled bitterly: "Your high discourse, Brother, I well understand; but how then am I linked to this beggar?" Wenshi nodded: "That, of course, is no accident. In your former life as a man, this beggar once saved your life; properly you should have repaid him his great grace, before becoming a recluse to cultivate the Way. As your root nature differs from ordinary men, this life’s banishment will soon end, and you will ascend to the heavenly host; it is no longer fitting to return to the human world for acts of gratitude and reward. Therefore, after his death you were made to attach your soul to his body; though his soul dissipates, his body does not die, and thus you may be said to have repaid him the grace of saving your life. This is truly a stroke of two gains for one deed. Moreover, Heaven’s decree fixes it so; how can you disdain his filth and seek another? Furthermore, the precious thing in immortals is that, if they can cast off the mortal body and change at will, how can they not transform the ugly to the fair, the bad to the good, even change male to female, old to young; there is nothing impossible. Since you have not yet reached the time of corpse liberation, you must for a time borrow this beggar’s corpse to travel to and fro in the world; when your cultivation is complete and the time comes, your new body will be a hundredfold fairer—will you then still need him?"

Li Xuan, hearing this, was completely enlightened, and repeatedly nodded. He then asked: "After the time of corpse liberation, may I no longer need this ugly body?" Wenshi said: "No, not so. Since you borrow his corpse to live, both before and after attainment you must take his form for your body; only at any moment you may transform it as you please." Li Xuan, having heard this, bowed and thanked Wenshi for his teaching, saying, "I will go now." His soul entered the corpse, which immediately rose erect, crutch in hand, fitting his body in length. Li Xuan leaned on the crutch and saluted Wenshi again. Wenshi hastily caught him, bidding him walk a few steps to see. Li Xuan complied, limping a few steps. Wenshi, seeing this awkward gait, could not but laugh aloud.

Li Xuan came to a river-side and, looking at his new form in the water, felt somewhat discontented. Wenshi comforted him: "True Perfected Ones never show their true form; the Ancestor Master, whenever descending to the mortal world, often takes a hideous guise, to test the sincerity and falseness of the mortals who bow to him. Now you are but a phantom form; what harm is there in that? Your business to save Yang’s mother is urgent; go quickly. But Yang’s mother’s lifespan is short; though by your magic you may restore her to life, it will only be for a decade. You must instruct Yang Ren to do many good deeds, so as to make up for the deficiency; otherwise not only will Yang Ren’s future be impaired, but you yourself will not escape some Heaven’s punishment!"

Li Xuan accepted this teaching, parted from Wenshi, and mounting a cloud looked upon his body once more, finding it black as cast iron, without a speck of white flesh. He laughed to himself: "This dead beggar must have grown in a black-skinned land. Since I am now a black man, I will take a new name, even attaching my own surname, and call myself Iron Crutch Li." Looking again at the peach-wood crutch Wenshi had given him, he saw it was pale yellow, like a new staff, and laughed: "My body is so black and shiny, yet this crutch is so fair; should it not be made to match?" So he blew upon it, and the crutch turned jet black, the same colour as his skin. He then nodded and laughed: "Thus it is, that the words 'Iron Crutch' are truly fitting to me."

He quickly descended to the region of Taian, and went straight to Yang Ren’s household. But Yang Ren was locked in a fierce struggle with Zhou Xiaoguan, neither letting go. Yang’s mother’s corpse had already been placed on the coffin board; the house was cold and silent; besides the two, only some country folk drawn by Xiaoguan were present. The Iron Crutch did not know why they fought, and watched awhile from outside; then he knew the two were not angry, but that Yang Ren was unable to deliver his mother’s final words, and had not heard a single parting instruction, while he had failed his master Li Xuan in that the master’s true body had been burned prematurely. This was disloyalty to the master and unfilial to his mother; therefore he felt unworthy to stand before Heaven and Earth. Waiting for the coffin to be purchased and all to be completed, he would entrust all matters of burial and funeral to Zhou Xiaoguan, and then draw his sword and kill himself before the coffin, in thanks to the heavenly master and his mother below. Xiaoguan could not allow him thus to die; seeing the sword drawn, he rushed forward disregarding life and death, and grasped his shoulders firmly, so the sword could not fall. Yang Ren wailed aloud, blaming himself for disloyalty and unfilialness, shamefaced to live. Xiaoguan did his best to detain him, but could not turn him from his purpose.

The Iron Crutch saw this and often nodded his head, comforting himself: "Though his self-destruction be foolish beyond measure, thus may I see his heart and spirit; the more he calls himself disloyal and unfilial, the more clearly may his loyalty and filialness be seen. Truly he is worthy to be my disciple, Iron Crutch; my assistance to him is not in vain." So he limped in, and with a single gesture asked the two: "Why do you quarrel thus?" Xiaoguan told the whole story. Yang Ren still wished to die, but the Iron Crutch laughed and said: "Yang, this is indeed your great fault. Have you not heard that life and death are decreed by fate and may not be forced? A son who serves his parents, whether living renders them filial duty, or dead performs rites, has fulfilled great filialness; what other filial duty is there? As for your master’s matter, though your fault cannot be pursued, the affair was difficult, and your master will not blame your lapse; thus the doctrine of loyalty may well be maintained. Being both loyal and filial is enough for a man. Should you seek to atone by self-destruction, you may fail to atone, and instead cause your master grief in Heaven, and your mother pain below; such a fault is too great. How then do you excuse yourself?" Xiaoguan, hearing these great sayings from the black, lame beggar, was astonished and delighted, and exclaimed assent repeatedly. Yang Ren was struck dumb, bowed his head, and sighed in silence; he had no mind to inquire the visitor’s origin.

After a while, he suddenly bowed beside the coffin and wept aloud. Xiaoguan no longer urged him, but quickly beckoned to Li Xuan, and asked his surname and name. Li Xuan smiled faintly and spoke at length, restoring Yang Ren’s gladness and banishing his sorrow.

How Li Xuan spoke is yet to be seen; we await the next chapter for its explanation.
