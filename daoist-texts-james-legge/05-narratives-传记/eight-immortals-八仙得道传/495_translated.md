# Chapter 27: The Immortal’s Art Applied, Yang’s Mother Revived; The Summons to Invite Li the Immortal to the Sea

It is told that when Master Iron Crutch beheld the young official, and inquired his name, he no longer concealed himself, but straightway hastened to the coffin of Yang’s mother, loudly calling, “Yang Ren, my child, how is it that thou dost not recognise thy master?” Yang Ren, who was weeping as if overwhelmed, hearing these words, was so startled that tears and nasal mucus all rolled back down into his stomach; opening his eyes, he looked up and down, scrutinising Li Xuan. Even the young official Zhou was greatly astonished, and stepping forward a few paces asked, “How is this? Art thou truly the master of my friend Yang? My friend, from his youth, entered the religious house, and followed a certain master surnamed Li, with the single name Xuan; never had he a second master. Pray, good sir, what cause hast thou to say that thou art his master?” Yang Ren ceased his grief and with tears nodded to Li Xuan, saying, “Indeed, this humble brother in life hath but one master Li; truly I know not what brotherhood in discipleship thou and I may have. There must be a reason; I pray thee, instruct me.” Master Iron Crutch, hearing this, could not but both laugh and sigh, then cried aloud, “I am indeed thy master Li Xuan. Thou sayest thou knowest me not; this is not wonderful. For who bade thee first to burn my body, thus causing my wandering soul to lose its home, and wander in bewilderment? Were it not for some skill in the Way that I possess, how should I even borrow this strange and hideous frame? ” Yang Ren, hearing these words, recognised the voice of Li Xuan, and the circumstances were so exact that he believed truly it was his master present. In great haste he knelt down, striking his head repeatedly upon the ground as if pounding garlic, calling himself accursed, and imploring his master to punish him. The young official Zhou also hastened to kneel.

Master Iron Crutch quickly stretched out both hands and lifted the two up, saying, “As I have said, thy error arose from filial piety, and may well be forgiven; moreover, there are certain fixed decrees in this. Hadst thou not burnt my body, yet this old shell of mine could not have been preserved. Let me slowly explain this to thee. As for thy losing the opportunity to perform the last rites for me because thou didst guard my body, that is I who have wronged thee.” Yang Ren heard this and was filled with anxiety. Iron Crutch went on, “Thy mother’s lifespan was limited to this measure alone. When thou didst enter religious life with me, did I not give thee some words of guidance, which perhaps thou dost yet vaguely remember? Now I pity thy pure filial heart, and also that because of me thou wert denied the final rites; I am heartily sorry. Yet now by my power I can cause thy mother to rise from death, live again twelve years, and then return to heaven. But in these twelve years thou must do many good deeds, and widely establish merit for the dead, that thou mayst not cut short thy own blessings and life, and that I may not contravene the course of Heaven. How sayest thou?” 

Yang Ren, hearing that his mother might return to life, was already overjoyed beyond measure; he eagerly prostrated himself upon the ground, knocking his head countless times, almost breaking his forehead, saying, “If my master will show such mercy, this disciple will even to powder and bone perform many good deeds, to repay the lofty kindness of Heaven and Earth.” Master Iron Crutch employed no medicine nor uttered any spell, but stepped forward and blew upon the corpse, crying out, “Arise!” Wonderfully, the corpse suddenly sat up, calling out once, “I am stifled to death!” Yang Ren joyfully advanced and embraced her; tears and mucus which had been swallowed now burst forth in laughter. Yang’s mother opened her eyes, seeing her son and a black beggar standing by, was filled with surprise and joy, her face streaming with tears, saying, “My son, why dost thou come only now? I thought I had already reached the nether world; suddenly a pure wind blew me back. Was it thou who saved me?” Yang Ren hastened to say, “Mother, my master is here; it was by his immortal art that he saved thee to life.” Hearing this, Yang’s mother wished to descend from the coffin to pay reverence. Yang Ren hastily said, “Mother, thou hast but just returned to life; take no trouble. Let thy son present thanks in thy stead.” Yet Yang’s mother was now tenfold stronger in spirit, more vigorous than before her illness; needing no support from Yang Ren, she stepped down from the coffin, and mother and son together bowed down before Master Iron Crutch. The master laughed heartily, saying, “Good mother and son, do not thus; we who take the religious life save and succour others as our duty, and should not receive many thanks.” Then he bade Yang Ren, “Go quickly and help thy mother to enter and rest. Having performed this deed against the course of Heaven, it is all dependent on thy doing many good works. In these twelve years thou needst not return to the mountain; with thy skill thou mayst travel abroad at will. After twelve years I shall come again to guide thee.” So saying, he transformed into a pure wind and rose halfway to heaven. Below, Yang’s mother and son and young official Zhou had their own farewell, which needs not be further described.

Master Iron Crutch returned to the Eight Scenes Palace, where all the immortals saw his queer form, and one and all could not restrain their laughter, and they jested with him for a while, making Iron Crutch ever more embarrassed. Presently, the Old Lord ascended his seat. Master Iron Crutch respectfully paid homage. The Old Lord smiled, saying, “This form is good. Mortal men’s filth lies in the heart; thou alone art ugly in appearance. When in future thou shalt travel the four great continents, the three realms, and the five hells, ordinary men will find it difficult to recognise thee in thy hideous form of the Great Golden Immortal. By this means thou mayst test the sincerity and truth of men’s seeking the Way. Is it not excellent?” 

Master Iron Crutch, hearing this, was greatly pleased; he bowed and said, “I had thought so indeed, and having received from my elder brother Wenshi a staff, I changed it to iron colour, and took the name Iron Crutch Li. I know not if this be acceptable?” The Old Lord nodded, “Good, very good. Upon the iron crutch’s head thou mayst also hang a gourd.” Turning, he ordered a boy, “Go and fetch a gourd from behind.” The boy obeyed, and presently returned with a large gourd. The Old Lord took it in hand and bestowed it upon Iron Crutch. The master reverently received it, saying, “Pray teach me, Patriarch, what is the wondrous power of this gourd?” The Old Lord said, “This gourd was plucked from a forest tree, and is no rare thing in itself; yet by my refining it has been changed in substance. Ordinary gourds contain seeds and pulp; this gourd is filled with the greatest treasures of the immortals. Thou mayst use it to subdue demons and monsters; it can produce raging fire and mighty water. When the fire blazes, it may be compared to a mountain of flames; when the water rises, it may rival the entire Eastern Ocean. Except for the immortals of the upper realms, who can withstand it? If thou dost use it to succour the suffering and relieve the needy, lifting the lid thou shalt find medicines and money; sometimes, by misplacing a hostel sign, it may even lodge many as a temporary inn.”

At this the immortals could not but smile. The Old Lord laughed, saying, “Doth this gourd seem fit to contain but one man? This is indeed what men call ‘a frog in a well contemplating the sky’.” Then he bade Li Xuan place the gourd down, mouth outward, and bade him close his eyes and stride boldly towards the mouth, opening them only after three steps. Master Iron Crutch obeyed, closing both eyes firmly, striding three steps before opening them; behold, his body was already within the gourd, and all the comrades and patriarchs outside were nowhere to be seen. As he walked further, the interior grew ever more spacious; looking closely, it was a round great house. Within were cupboards and beds, and all manner of utensils complete. Going further in was yet a larger round chamber, containing almost every article for human use — clothing, food, amusements — scarcely one thing wanting. More wonderful still, just as Iron Crutch was thinking this great house would require servants for cleaning, cooking, and washing, instantly many attendants in blue robes appeared, standing with hands lowered; two perfect maidservants approached, one bearing tea, the other a towel, lightly smiling and calling, “Master, your tea.” Iron Crutch could not help laughing heartily, thinking, “My patriarch surely doth play tricks. But alas, I am but a cultivator; why should I need such comfort? A humble earthen jar and rope bed, a humble door and window, suffice me well. Now that I am a black beggar, I need no fine clothes; as for food, it is even more dispensable to a cultivator; yet would I not be ungrateful to my patriarch’s great kindness?”

Just as he thought thus, the magnificent hall, the precious utensils, and the servants all vanished unknown whither; the two round chambers became worn and broken, shabby and mean. The furniture was now exceedingly plain and coarse, the very opposite of the former wealth and splendour. Iron Crutch nodded and sighed inwardly, “Indeed, for a monk must be such as this, and so the heart may be at ease. The patriarch is truly a sage immortal, and knows well my tastes.” He thought further, “My junior brothers just now hearing the patriarch’s command seemed full of doubt; I will invite them in, that we may play together and so increase their insight, and also hold a gourd gathering with all the immortals here; would not that be excellent?” While thinking thus, he still proceeded onward. Going yet a layer further, the house was greater than the two preceding; at last a great round wall separated off the boundary of the gourd’s end and the outside world. Since his heart was calm and indifferent, the interior was arranged in the plainest and simplest fashion. Iron Crutch looked awhile, then retraced his steps to the middle room. Unknown to him, the great courtyard already swarmed with many brothers; upon seeing Iron Crutch, they all rose and congratulated him. The immortals said among themselves, “We saw thee enter the gourd mouth and vanish; we were just considering this when the patriarch said: ‘Thy brother Iron Crutch is within, thinking of you; go in and see what good things he hath to entertain you.’ Thus we have come in succession, seeking thee the host, when lo, thou didst emerge from the back again. No wonder the patriarch said we were frogs in a well; truly this little gourd can hold several thousand.” Iron Crutch greeted the immortals, rejoicing that the interior had now restored its former splendour. He hastened to bid the immortals sit, while the blue-robed attendants continuously served tea and cakes with much cordiality. The wonder was that Iron Crutch needed not command; a mere thought sufficed for all to be well arranged. What worldly servant could be so clever? The immortals greatly admired this, congratulating Iron Crutch on his possession of so great a treasure. At this, Master Wenshi was also present, laughing and saying, “Though we have followed the patriarch so long, we never knew the Old Lord made such a thing. Our younger brother hath recently come, with some special gift; it shows the patriarch’s especial favour. Without previous affinity how could this be?” 

Master Iron Crutch laughed and said, “Though it be the patriarch’s great kindness, yet I owe my elder brother’s promotion and instruction, and the help of my brothers. I, Li Xuan, have but a single petal of incense, and humbly pray that my brothers may have long life and happiness.” The immortals laughed, “This is truly a predestined connection; what merit have we? Only now first entering and viewing thy gourd immortal abode, we have brought no gifts; we feel somewhat ashamed.” Iron Crutch hastened to reply, “I dare not take it; when I find a place for cultivation, if aught be needed, I shall certainly beg of you; but for now I will leave it with you all.” Thereupon all laughed.

Master Wenshi said he would inspect the whole gourd immortal abode; Iron Crutch led them again to the rear; but behind there was no door, and all returned by the small entrance in front. Looking back at the gourd, it was still but a few inches long, a trifle. Thus the immortals followed Iron Crutch, all joyful, praising and giving thanks without end. The Old Lord smiled, saying, “This is but a toy; it is not the great Way. Ye are too amazed; this is but a small glimpse.” The immortals were silent. The Old Lord commanded Iron Crutch to tie the gourd to the staff’s end. Master Wenshi hastened to say, “Pray let me bring a strap to tie it.” The Old Lord smiled and nodded. Master Wenshi took off his immortal coronet, plucked a hair about an inch long, stretched it to ten feet, then let it contract again; he tied the gourd to the staff’s end, the light flashing, as if of gold, soft as cotton, fine as silk, tough as ox sinew, impossible to break by pulling. Master Iron Crutch hastened to bow and thank again. The Old Lord commanded, “Last time I bade thee go down to the sea, and at the critical moment, even I and thy elder brothers must go once. Though not a great matter, there is a demon sect leader seeking to take advantage and trouble our sect, so we must be cautious. As for the origin of this matter, it is related to Wenshi’s disciple, Master Hui Mei. When thou returnest, thou mayst await in the cave of thy disciple at Mount Tai; in one or two days some will come to summon thee. That man will be Wenshi’s disciple. He will tell thee all that is in the case.” Master Iron Crutch responded to each word.

The Old Lord further said, “In truth, this matter is the responsibility of the newly enlightened He Lan Immortal; the owner of the matter hath some previous affinity with her, and it should be she who takes charge. But as she is still in devout practice, and cannot be distracted by such trifling matters, this matter has been put upon thee; regard it as thy merit in place of Lan Immortal.” Master Iron Crutch hastened to say, “As for Miss He’s matter, this disciple ought to undertake it; if there be any merit, it belongs to her. I dare not arrogate another’s credit.” The Old Lord smiled and nodded, saying, “Religious men seek only to benefit others; the present master will soon attain the Way, and later be a comrade and fellow disciple with you, helping one another; this is natural, and there is no need to divide duties strongly.” Iron Crutch respectfully bowed and accepted the command.

Returning to the Jade Cliff cave at Mount Tai, he summoned Fei Fei and Dian Dian by summons to await orders. Before nightfall the two arrived to pay respects to the master. Iron Crutch told them all that had happened since parting; both rejoiced and praised. Iron Crutch also spoke of the escape of Yu’er down the mountain; the two were angry and said, “Pray point out the place, and we will go forth to seize and punish her.” Iron Crutch smiled, saying, “This creature hath a wild and unruly heart, and cannot be enlightened to join (our assembly); it is my overzealousness that brought this trouble. Since she hath fled, I think she will not dare harm the people for a while; we may wait till she commits some crime and then deal with her.” They agreed.

Iron Crutch said, “Tomorrow some one shall come to summon me down the mountain to deal with a great matter in the sea; ye may wait outside the cave gate to receive him.” The two obeyed, standing afar outside the cave mouth. After noon, suddenly a sound as of a great bird flying in the air was heard. The two were startled, and lifting their eyes beheld a female Taoist descending through the air, standing before them. They knew she must be the one who came to fetch their master, and hastened to salute, asking, “Fair lady, art thou from the sea? Pray give thy Taoist name, that we may duly report.” The female Taoist joyfully said, “Honoured master is indeed a true immortal of the Way, and hath known already that I would come to pay respect. My Taoist name is Hui Tong; I am the disciple of Master Wenshi, thy elder brother, who is also a comrade with you two; and thou and our Master Wenshi all issued from the Old Lord and the Primordial Lord’s teachings; we are all one family.” Fei Fei smiled and bade welcome; Dian Dian entered to report. Master Iron Crutch, as newly enlightened, owed much to the help of fellow disciples; he was humble and did not regard himself with undue pride, and so went forth with Fei Fei to receive her.

Hui Tong, seeing Iron Crutch, knew him to be the lame immortal spoken of by her master, and hastened forward to prostrate herself, saying, “Elder uncle above, thy disciple Hui Tong pays respects.” Master Iron Crutch returned a half bow, smiling, and invited her inside to sit. Hui Tong first related how Madam Luo Yuan had attained the Way, and by the master’s command had set up the Way place, specially inviting elder uncle to grace the altar affairs. Iron Crutch readily consented, and asked Hui Tong to relate the former matters of Luo Yuan. Hui Tong told all in order, and Iron Crutch then understood the cause and effect, and knew that the patriarch had said the future fellow and colleague would be the Zhang Guo spoken of by Hui Tong; at once he formed a warm affection. Hui Tong further said, “Madam Luo Yuan by the master’s command hath changed her name to Jue Xian, and now awaits the arrival of the sacred carriage. She will invite all the mountain comrades, the great immortals of all realms, and the Dragon King and his consort of the sea, to join the grand assembly, and earnestly begs elder uncle to set out early.” Master Iron Crutch hastened to say, “Religious men have no business other than saving and helping others. Since this honour is bestowed, I will accompany my elder sister and set out at once.”

Hui Tong was greatly pleased, and with Iron Crutch and the two, Fei and Dian, rose to the clouds. The village of Huaihai lay to the south of Mount Tai; the four proceeded southward. Midway, suddenly a black wind blew from behind them. Iron Crutch and Hui Tong knew that something was amiss; looking back, they saw four Taoists laughing and coming through the black clouds. Hui Tong whispered to Iron Crutch, “Elder uncle, these must be demons. I have heard from Master Chang that with Jue Xian’s attainment and altar setting, enemies will come to plot and destroy; all must be on guard. Now these four wear demonic countenances, and go the same way as we do; surely they are bound for Huaihai village. Elder uncle and I should proceed slowly, and wait for them to arrive; then we may question and decide how to deal with them. What sayest thou?” Iron Crutch nodded, “This is well.” So they slackened their pace, waiting for the four to come up and meet them.

Whether the four be demons or not is yet to be told in the following chapter.
