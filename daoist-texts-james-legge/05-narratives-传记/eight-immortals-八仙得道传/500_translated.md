# Chapter 32: Contest of Magical Arts — The Sealed Gourd is Broken; The Spirit of the Clam Shell Surrenders

Now it happened that the immortals within the gourd, hearing the words of the demon without, all found it exceedingly diverting, and for the moment forgot their own peril. After a while, they suddenly perceived that the air within the gourd had changed; indeed, as Zhang Guo had said, it grew somewhat hot, yet they did not feel it otherwise unbearable.

The Venerable Wenshi laughed and said, 'Zhang Guo fears the cold; this warmth is a welcome relief, and indeed ought to be more comfortable; but should it grow hotter yet, it will inevitably parch you all—what then is to be done?' Hui Tong smiled and said, 'It matters not: your disciple judges that the Three-Element True Fire of the Lord of All under Heaven is but of such force as this; yet, as he is indeed the head of a sect, his Taoist power surpasses the common, and so his power is manifest. Were it less, perhaps Brother Zhang could not even induce him to increase the heat as he desires. Masters, if you doubt, listen again to what is said without.'

All present heard and quietly pricked up their ears, when they heard the voice of the Lord of All under Heaven speaking with resentment: 'Do these gang of rogue Taoists really endure thus? That even my Three-Element True Fire cannot burn them to death shows that these fellows do possess some measure of skill!' So saying, the immortals burst into loud laughter. Then the Lord of All under Heaven was heard speaking to others: 'Come quickly and listen, these rogue Taoists are still laughing within!' Another demon said: 'This fellow’s substance is thin; therefore, when we speak without, they hear all. Otherwise, how could we hear their laughter?' Thereupon another demon expressed surprise: 'This is indeed strange. The gourd is so thin, and the Patriarch’s Three-Element Fire so mighty—how can it fail to burn them? Moreover, the gourd remains intact, unmarred even by a scratch—is this not a marvel?' These words within made the immortals more and more unable to restrain their laughter.

Fei Fei and Dian Dian, by nature frank and straightforward, could no longer endure, and shouted aloud: 'You demon fellows, not understanding even this principle, and yet you dare pretend to be immortals! The name of Immortal is truly a bitter reproach upon you. Let us tell you: we indeed are Golden Immortals of Heaven; but your Patriarch’s Three-Element Fire, after burning so long, cannot injure our Master’s treasures; to think it can harm our persons is but a dream.'

These words reached without, and indeed startled both great and small demons under the Lord of All under Heaven. Present was a little demon of the Bai family, originally a serpent spirit who had attained whiteness and thus called herself Lady Bai. Lady Bai said to the Lord of All under Heaven: 'May it please the Patriarch! The gourd is a thing of the Old Master’s own garden, and he himself has tempered it; naturally, it cannot be burned. If the gourd remain unharmed, how can these rogue Taoists die? In your disciple’s opinion, it would be better to bring this thing back to the mountain, there to bind these rogues beneath Mount Yunfeng with the Patriarch’s talismans, so that for a thousand or ten thousand years they shall not rise again; though alive, it will be as if dead. Meanwhile, we might burn the spiral conch shell and so claim complete victory. Why linger further here? Tomorrow the Old Lord will come, and there must be another bloody battle. Though we fear them not, there is no profit to be gained. What say you, Patriarch?'

As these words reached the immortals within the gourd, Dian Dian leapt up first and said to Hui Tong and Zhang Guo: 'Brothers, did you hear? This little wanton demon of the Bai family has devised a plan far more cunning than the others. Should the Lord of All under Heaven heed her counsel and confine us in the mountain prison, will we ever again see the light of day?' Hui Tong laughed, chiding him for too deep thought, when suddenly Master Tieguai cried out: 'No nonsense! What do you know? I have already reckoned that the Patriarch will come to rescue us within two hours. Let us be patient and wait a little longer.' Fei Fei, Dian Dian, and the others were thus half surprised and half delighted.

Meanwhile, outside the Lord of All under Heaven approved Lady Bai’s proposal, commanding her to lead thirty little demons to destroy the spiral conch shell, to drive away Luo Yuan and the others; once done, they were to come at once to Mount Yunfeng to see me, and not fail. He further ordered Hou Kong the Recluse, the Bull Demon King, and others to patrol the sea surface for wind; if any rogue Taoists came from that side, they should report at once. He also commanded the Old Flood Dragon to bring up the rear, to oppose the Dragon King and his consort, to resist as best he could, but to lose rather than win, retreating all the way to Mount Yunfeng, to see if they could pursue as far as the home mountain. Having thus arranged his forces, the Lord of All under Heaven commanded Lingxuzi, Tongxuzi, and others to bear the gourd. Yet none suspected that these arrangements were all clearly heard by the immortals within, and the several high immortals had already determined that the Patriarch would come to their rescue, and soon they would be delivered from their calamity. Their hearts were exceedingly calm, and those with lesser cultivation seeing their composure were also reassured, and no longer fearful.

At that moment, they perceived that the dwelling seemed again to stir as if shaken; the Venerable Wenshi smiled and said: 'Those two fellows, whatever their names, have brought the Patriarch’s command to bear, and play with our temporary abode!' With Wenshi, Wenmei, and four other immortals, they made a heavy-body art, pressing the gourd down so solidly that it was heavier than Mount Tai. Lingxuzi and others could no longer move it, and despite their utmost efforts, it did not stir, like a dragonfly shaking a stone pillar. Indeed, the Lord of All under Heaven was formidable; seeing this, he laughed and cried aloud: 'They have used the heavy-body art, and your little strength is of no avail!' So saying, he muttered incantations, drew forth his precious sword, and pointed it at the gourd, instantly releasing the weight as if it were a mountain. His chief disciple Hu Shanhai lightly lifted the gourd, turning it over and over, causing the immortals within to be tossed about and somersault in succession. Venerable Wenshi was greatly angered and cried: 'Detestable demon dogs! How dare you be so rude?' He then requested Master Tieguai to use his art to enlarge the gourd as much as possible. Master Tieguai chanted seven or eight times the character 'Great', and the gourd grew larger than a house, frightening Hu Shanhai so that he dropped it at once. Master Tieguai then chanted 'High, high, high', and the gourd became higher than a mountain, growing ever larger and higher without limit, until the clam shell was nearly crushed. The demons within the shell were pressed and battered, driven into a corner, their cries shaking the heavens. The Lord of All under Heaven could not attend to these demons but hastily cast a spell to tighten his Immortal Execution Net. Yet the gourd’s power was no less than the net’s; the external pressure and internal expansion were balanced, a stalemate. Alas! The clam palace was already filled completely by the gourd; all within were destroyed utterly; several hundred little demons were crushed to death; those with magical power were grievously hurt, unable to move, lying on the ground and wailing.

The Lord of All under Heaven quickly took out pills, first healing their wounds; then he used his arts to enlarge the clam palace swiftly, like Master Tieguai’s gourd. Smiling to the demons, he said: 'Fear not; however formidable the lame thief may be, if he can enlarge the gourd to cover sun and sky, I have means to expand this old clam shell beyond the heavens. If they think to break through this shell by such petty arts, they only dream.' After a while, he saw the gourd gradually shrink, and laughed again: 'Surely these foolish rogues know the magic is vain, and dare no longer deceive.' The demons rejoiced, praising the Lord of All under Heaven’s boundless art.

Just as the Lord of All under Heaven was about to speak, suddenly a great crash was heard from outside the clam shell. The Lord of All under Heaven paled and said: 'This is the Old Lord’s Palm Thunder; could it be that the old Daoist himself has truly come to oppose me?' Before he finished, two more tremendous explosions followed in quick succession. The Lord of All under Heaven stamped his foot and said: 'Enough! I should not have sent them to patrol the winds. Hou Kong and Bull Demon have limited power; how can they withstand such thunder and fire? This surely will be their death. I wonder how Lady Bai fares at the conch shell; can she escape this calamity?' Saying this, he silently summoned his mind and calculated the present matter, then nodded and said: 'It is fortunate, indeed fortunate, that Lady Bai has already escaped the water’s surface, that a fisherman captured her, but soon another bought and released her; this thing will surely have some destiny; no need to mind her. Most pitiful are Hou and Bull Demon, who gave their lives in vain — is it not lamentable?'

No sooner had he spoken than the clam shell shook fiercely, breaking in several places. The old clam, tears flowing and sorrowful, knelt before the Lord of All under Heaven, begging for mercy. The Lord of All under Heaven, both ashamed and angry, impatiently shouted: 'Ignorant beast! What nonsense do you babble? If it is not your time to die, you shall not find death; but if it is your time, what use your bitter entreaties?' Having spoken, he kicked the old clam aside and, drawing his sword, went forth. There he met the Old Lord Patriarch riding a blue ox, holding a whisk; he was accompanied by only four young attendants, and brought few soldiers. Seeing the Lord of All under Heaven, he laughed gently and said: 'Brother Dao, being head of a sect, how can you fail to understand the principles of order and rebellion? That Jue first attained true fruit by the aid of other species, and now comes by his master’s command to invite the Moral Master to hold rites for the spirits wronged before — this is indeed a good thing. The Old Flood Dragon was once his son; having oppressed his mother, he has already rebelled to the utmost; now, after a thousand years, to come seeking revenge — how can that be justified? You, as head of the sect and Patriarch to them, should have reprimanded and restrained such improprieties; how have you listened to this slander and rashly stirred troops to make trouble? As a result, not only have you harmed your own disciples, but injured many living beings besides — is this not your fault? Now that I have come, for the sake of our common alienation and pity for your ten-thousand-year cultivation and Patriarch’s rank, I cannot bring punishment upon you. You see I come alone, without troops, and so you may understand my meaning. Hear my words: return to your mountain and repent. If not, consider well: your Taoist power and arts cannot contend with my disciples; how then can you withstand my blow? Prepare your fight as you wish; I shall not strike first.'

The Lord of All under Heaven was abashed by this rebuke from the Old Lord, and with anger flushing his face, shouted: 'Li Er, do not vaunt yourself! Your disciples daily treat my followers with great disgrace, making my pupils ashamed. I take this chance to test who is superior. Now your high disciples are already caught in my net, soon to be reduced to pus and blood; how do you prove I am inferior? You bring no troops — I am alone to contend with you; whoever seeks aid is not head of a sect.' The Old Lord laughed: 'Do you suppose that my disciples are all caught in your net? Such nonsense you speak. Look behind you and see who is there.'

The Lord of All under Heaven turned and looked; indeed, the captives he had so recently taken stood untroubled, happy, and at ease, watching the battle. He did not know how or when the Old Lord had freed them. Filled with anger and surprise, the Lord of All under Heaven turned and shouted: 'Li Er, do not overreach! See how I will take your head with my sword-light!' Saying this, he opened his mouth and spat forth a thousand or more blue rays, which quickly became a thousand blades surrounding the Old Lord, attacking from all sides. The Old Lord laughed and waved his whisk lightly; the sword-lights scattered as dust. The Lord of All under Heaven, seeing no way, hastily withdrew them.

At that moment, the Old Lord shouted: 'Lord of All under Heaven, try my blade-light!' No sooner had he spoken than myriad golden rays flew forth, becoming myriad daggers attacking the Lord of All under Heaven. The Lord of All under Heaven swiftly swayed his body, transformed into a hawk, and soared heavenward, fiercely pouncing upon the Old Lord’s head. The Old Lord feigned ignorance, acting as if untroubled; a lotus flower appeared above his head, shielding him; the hawk could not descend, but this angered the Old Lord’s several high disciples. Venerable Wenshi cried aloud: 'Lord of All under Heaven, you care not for your honour; men say beasts attain human form, but I have never heard of a sect leader who imitates beasts to harm others secretly. Such conduct is unworthy of comparison with our Patriarch. Open your eyes and behold my Taoist treasure!'

The Lord of All under Heaven hovered in midair, circling incessantly; hearing this, he grew wrathful, eager to see the treasure, and opened his eyes wide. Meanwhile, Venerable Wenshi spoke and drew forth a divine crossbow from his sleeve, shooting straight at the Lord of All under Heaven’s eyes. The Lord of All under Heaven was taken unawares and was struck in one eye, blood streaming down his face, pain intolerable. Fortunately, he had divine pills at hand, and hastily applied them, pain ceased, but one eye was blinded. For the divine crossbow was forged in the Old Lord’s alchemical furnace from golden essence, empowered with talismans; an ordinary demon could not endure it. The Lord of All under Heaven had attained the body of Deathless Ten Thousand Calamities, so only one eye was harmed. Having suffered this great loss, how could he be content? He turned from the south to the northeast, still intending to return to the clam shell and summon disciples from all quarters for revenge. Yet, the clam spirit, having endured insult from the senior brothers and rebuke from the Lord of All under Heaven, harboured resentment and had already communicated with Guang Chengzi and others, delivering into the Old Lord’s hands all the demons stored within the shell. Only the Old Flood Dragon, quick of wit, had escaped, and by chance met the Lord of All under Heaven on the Cloud Road. The Old Flood Dragon wept and prostrated himself on the clouds, narrating the clam maid’s repeated treachery. The Lord of All under Heaven sighed toward heaven, knowing he could fight no more, and took the Old Flood Dragon back to Mount Yunfeng.

Thus ended the contest of magical arts between the two sects: the Old Lord’s disciples owed their safety to Master Tieguai’s gourd hiding place, and won the victory; such is the wondrous use of the gourd. The vulgar say there is a sealed gourd that cannot be broken, a phrase derived from this matter; also, that the medicine sold within the gourd extols the gourd’s efficacy. Many say that the mysteries therein are beyond the knowledge of outsiders. From ancient times to the present, this tale has passed for many thousands of years. Though we were born late and have not seen the true countenances and holy deeds of the high immortals, based solely on these two ancient sayings, we can imagine the profundity of the gourd; and from the gourd’s mystery, we may conceive of the boundless Taoist arts of the high immortals above. This is but empty talk and not to be elaborated. Gentle sirs, pray sit a while; allow me to rest briefly, then I shall continue to relate the strange wonders of He Xian’s attainment of the Tao, the emergence of Zhongli, the transformation of Meng Jiangnu’s flesh into silver fish, the formation of the Zhejiang tides by Xuan Zhuzi, and other remarkable tales.
