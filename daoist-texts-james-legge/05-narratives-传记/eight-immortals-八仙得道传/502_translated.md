# Chapter Thirty-Four: The Naked Herd of Female Spirits, the Toxic Bull; The Iron Sand Immortal’s Method is Potent

Now it happened that the Fairy He was cast forth by the demon in a cloud of black smoke; she felt dizzy, and fell from the clouds to the earth. In an instant, she was almost bereft of all sense; yet, being a body trained by cultivation, although at that moment she could not endure it, as if dead, yet by the demon’s command all the women took her up and supported her. As they turned her about, the flow of blood and breath was restored throughout her frame; instantly her spirit returned. She opened her eyes and beheld the demon standing aside, overseeing many women — the very naked and sorrowful ones she had just seen — who bore her away towards the rear. The Fairy only wished to flee from that naked demon; life and death were for the moment left aside. She observed that those who bore her were shedding tears, some whispering complaints; their voices were low and indistinct, but it could be guessed that they bore hate and cursed the demon to swift death. The Fairy inwardly grieved and said, “These women are indeed without shame, which is rare.” When they had borne her beyond the main hall, the demon did not follow; her heart was much eased. She smiled and said to the company, “My sisters, fear not, be not anxious. I have come to rescue you; I did not expect such cruelty. Your master is now held by the demon in a thousand-person pit three hundred li away, guarded by earth spirits and ghostly soldiers; you shall not suffer loss.”

The women heard and were all astonished. Some bolder ones asked who she was, why she came to save them, how she knew their master was in the thousand-person pit, and how she could speak with the earth spirit. The Fairy briefly told her own origin. Suddenly without, the demon’s shouts drew near. The women hurriedly bore the Fairy into an exquisite small chamber, laid her upon a couch, and fearing the demon’s entry, hastened to shut the doors, leaving the Fairy alone and unattended. Fearing the demon’s return to molest her, the Fairy took advantage of the empty room and leapt down from the bed. Seeing a small courtyard outside the chamber, she forced open a window and escaped through it. She rose on clouds in the courtyard to seek the earth spirit, but found him gone. Hastening to the temple, she looked down and saw the Earth Mother speaking tearfully to a ghostly soldier beneath the divine seat, recounting her own sufferings.

The Fairy was deeply moved, and quickly lowered her cloud-head, calling out, “Earth Mother, grieve not for the ancients; your dear friend the great Miss He has returned.” The Earth Mother, hearing this and seeing the Fairy graceful and lively before her, turned sorrow to joy and said, “You! You have distressed me almost to death, yet here you are, laughing and jesting!” The Fairy laughed and thanked her for her care, then recounted the whole matter.

The Earth Mother, hearing this, clicked her tongue and said, “You are indeed reckless. I warned you before that this demon is not an ordinary tree spirit or wood monster, but has real power, beyond our capacity to deal lightly with. Since the City God thus gave command, surely there will be some immortal to save this great family. Yet you, so impatient, would needs go and try your hand, and so have suffered loss.” The Fairy smiled and said, “The aim of the cultivator is to aid the world; how can one care for many things? Now, the City God says the immortal will come, though when is uncertain; but the great Wu family now faces danger of life and death. My opinion is that I must find some way to move him to a safe and secret place, so the demon cannot seek him, thus averting peril. Otherwise, if the demon knows I have escaped, he will suspect I went to rescue the Wu family; would not their lives then be endangered by my hands?” The Earth Mother replied, “That is not certain. Since you have gone, the demon will be occupied in his own pleasures; how can you be sure he will go after the Wu family?” The Fairy smiled, “I hope that is so. My meaning is only to be cautious, lest in rescuing others I harm them, increasing my guilt. You have the duty to guard the earth and cannot lightly leave your post; I have no responsibility here; I must go now to see, whether the demon is present or not, and in any case to move the great family elsewhere.” The Earth Mother could not restrain her, and so let her go.

The Fairy rose into mid-air, urged the clouds forward, and in a moment arrived at the thousand-person pit. There, a ghostly soldier charged with guarding the family met her, and hurriedly reported, “The demon came just now and took the great Wu away. Had you come one step sooner, you might have caught him.” The Fairy stamped her foot and sighed. She asked whither the demon had gone, and if he had been clearly seen. The ghostly soldier said he had gone northeast. The Fairy bade the soldier return, and herself drove the clouds northeastward.

Passing over two mountain ridges, she saw ahead a mass of black vapour, vague and drifting before the wind; the Fairy knew it must be the demon. As he moved slowly, she planned to overtake him and with one sword-stroke slay him, to avoid further trouble. But suddenly she thought, the demon must be carrying the great Wu with him; if her sword harmed the demon, the Wu would be cast down and his life endangered. She must needs press forward with all her strength, and shouted, “Demon, stop and leave Wu behind!” The demon looked back and smiled, “So it is you again, wench! I was much displeased when you escaped me before; how now do you come to my door?” As he spoke he descended upon a great mountain summit, cast down the great Wu, and beckoned upward, “Come hither, sister!” The Fairy, enraged, flew to the summit and drew her sword at the demon. The demon drew his blade to meet her; sword met blade, blade met sword, fighting many rounds. Then the demon grew impatient, rolled on the ground, and revealed his true form — a vast green bull, massive beyond measure, bearing two great horns, which he struck fiercely at the Fairy. Knowing his power, she sought to flee. The bull was incomparable; with one leg he struck her with a flying kick. Though the Fairy had magic arts, the bull’s prowess was tenfold hers; she was unsteady and fell backward to the ground.

The bull then changed his shape to that of the great Wu, smiling, “Good sister, fear not; love your features and fair flesh. I bring you back to play and enjoy happy days. If you obey me, you shall know no disgrace.” Saying so, he seized the Fairy and bore her on his back. She understood well, and though the kick had drained her strength, she still held her sword ready to strike at his vital parts. But looking closely she perceived the bull’s skin was thick as leather; when her finger struck it, it sounded like metal on stone. She knew her sword might not harm him, and that this time she was truly at a loss. Distressed, she summoned all her strength to seize the bull’s horns, pluck out his hairs, and kick fiercely at his rump. Yet the bull’s power and thick hide were as if insensible; though carrying the Fairy, he advanced slowly, singing lewd village songs.

The Fairy struggled in vain, feeling she could resist no longer. Perspiring profusely, her heart trembling, she sought a way to end her life. After some thought, tears fell, and she cried aloud, “Master Xuan-nü, Brother Iron Crutch, I owe you your great kindness in teaching the path of cultivation. Who would have thought that before I had accomplished it, I would lose my life? Can my masters know of this wretched disciple’s plight here?” After calling thus and weeping bitterly, she looked towards the Wu household and resolved to take her sword to slay herself. Suddenly she recalled, “No, no! I have heard it said that a man seeking death is the most useless thing. Unless death is at hand, why lightly attempt it? If my purpose be firm, I may strive to the death; then what is there not to be done? Even if walking this desperate path, I may delay a moment and see how things go.” While she thought thus, the demon arrived at the courtyard, brought the Fairy into a room, cast her upon a bed, and summoned a troop of naked women to guard her. He commanded, “This is my cherished beauty; guard her well, lest she escape again, for then none of you shall live.” Saying this, he went away laughing.

The women, seeing the Fairy thus captured, wept bitterly and said, “We are doomed; to come to this pass needs no more words. Sister, since you have escaped with your life, how came you again into the demon’s hands, sharing our shame?” The Fairy was about to speak of escape when the demon suddenly re-entered, stripped bare as before, and with a few strides came to the bed’s edge, laughing, “Good sister, we shall now enjoy ourselves.” Alarmed, the Fairy pushed away the naked women, leapt from the bed, drew her sword, and attacked the demon. The demon was unarmed; he opened his mouth and spewed forth a dreadful blue smoke. The Fairy and many women fainted to the ground. The Fairy’s spirit was not confused; she saw the demon still in human guise, smiling as he stripped her clothes, untying her sash. The Fairy’s heart was heavy, her body soft and powerless; only tears flowed in torrents.

At that dire moment, suddenly there came from the sky a thunderous crash that shook the great mansion on all sides. The demon was terrified and fled. The Fairy was roused by the thunder, sprang up, but found the women still faint and senseless, as if dead or mad. She knew this thunder came from nowhere, surely for some purpose. Anxious to leave, her heart was kind; seeing the women so abused, she could not leave them. The blue smoke was so potent that it might be some time before they could recover, and she had no means to help them.

While she hesitated, suddenly a golden light flashed into the courtyard, filling it with splendour, blinding the eyes. After some time, when she could see again, she beheld a fairy standing on a red lotus in the midst. Around her were many attendants, each beautiful and pure, who clustered about and smilingly called to the Fairy, “Lan Xian, why do you not flee? Are you not afraid of the demon’s insult?” The Fairy prostrated herself and thanked them for their grace, asking the fairy’s celestial name. The fairy bade her attendants raise her, and smiling said, “We are fellow disciples, equals; no need for such ceremony.” She told the Fairy she was the Lady of the Ninth Heaven’s Upper Origin, also a disciple of Xuan-nü, a fellow scholar with the Fairy. She said the Master had ordered her to come because the ancient Lord Lao’s blue bull mount had been released by a boy, running wild in the mortal world, spreading poison. The Master knew the Fairy’s compassion, her lack of self-measure, and rash overreach; though that was an offence hardly to be pardoned, it was a commendable heart. Therefore she was sent to aid, and to teach the Fairy a method for exorcising the demon. Henceforth she must apply herself diligently to cultivation, avoid worldly affairs, lest demons arise and calamity befall. This time the Master forgave her without penalty; the junior sister bade her express gratitude.

The Fairy, hearing this, was greatly startled and ashamed, and knelt to thank the heavens. The Lady waved her sleeve, and the naked women seemed to awaken from a dream, rising and staring at the Lady, the Fairy, and the attendants, not knowing what had happened. The Fairy wished to speak to them further, but the Lady took her hand, and with a flash of golden light they were all transported out of the courtyard to a mountain.

It was the Fairy’s cave itself before them; the Lady led her attendants and bade the Fairy enter first. The Fairy gave thanks again and again. The Lady smiled and said, “We are sisters of the same path, and by Master’s command; no thanks are needed.” The Fairy asked of the demon bull’s origin. The Lady sighed, “It is a small calamity, an unavoidable matter. This was originally the mount of Lord Lao, guarded by a boy. Before your Iron Crutch friend had attained immortality, he suffered from this creature; later the Master Wenshi went to fetch it to the mountain, freeing Iron Crutch’s trouble. At that time the Master had intended to punish the boy for negligence, but was spared through the brothers’ intercession. Now, the Master held a grand Taoist assembly in a snail’s shell under the sea; the demon sect took the opportunity to vex our sect. The brothers defeated the demons, but the demon sect’s founder came to the sea floor and set up a contest platform, boasting wildly and binding the brothers with talismans, imprisoning them. Only the Master’s arrival freed them. The Master stayed five days at sea, and needing no mount, left the blue bull in the palace. The bull, angered by the boy’s whip in a race for being slow, bore a grudge; when the boy was tired, the bull lay down on the grass and escaped, fleeing to the mortal realm. This happened three days ago, months ago below. The bull roams wildly, causing much trouble. The Eastern Emperor and Great Emperor Zhenwu learned of this and sent forces to expel it, bringing it here. The great Wu was a butcher of cattle in a past life, and loves beef now, so his misfortune is greater than others’. The Master has since banished the boy to earth, sending a mature boy to reclaim the bull, who will soon arrive. Moreover, the Master said: ‘All cultivators must establish merit and virtue; this is the unique foundation of the Way.’ Though your recent acts were rash and ill-measured, your heart is right, and you must not err. After subduing the creature, you may learn protective skills; after ten years you may go to the mountain foot to benefit the people. The Master will have further instructions then. Apply yourself diligently, and await the decree.”

The Fairy agreed to all. The Lady took out a grain of iron sand, as small as a mustard seed, and said, “The Master orders you to carry this sand; when facing the divine bull, seize the moment to cast it into the earth; there will be wondrous effect. Take care, and do not err. I cannot go with you; I shall wait here.” The Fairy received the sand but could not imagine how such a small thing could subdue the mighty divine bull. The Lady spoke no more; the Fairy, troubled, took leave and departed on clouds. She returned to the Wu household; before descending, she heard wails and cries. Parting the clouds she saw the naked women tied high on many pillars, while the demon struck each with a weapon. She knew this was punishment for their escape, suspecting they had freed the horses, and so he sought them out with cruel severity. The Fairy, full of pity, descended and stood outside the courtyard, her hand on her sword, crying out, “Wicked beast, how dare you be insolent? See my sword!” She sent a sword flying. The demon, unarmed, caught a large stone mortar from the courtyard and met the blow. The mortar was cleft in two; half fell to the ground, half remained in his hand.

Furious, the demon prepared to use magic. Suddenly the iron sand flew from the Fairy’s hand and fell to the ground. Surprised, she cried aloud and sought to pick it up. Looking down, she saw not ordinary sand but a spreading patch of sand and mud, growing deeper and wider. In a moment it engulfed the demon’s feet. The demon cried out like thunder: when his left foot lifted, the right sunk deeper; before the right rose, the left went deeper still. The Fairy knew the celestial treasure’s wondrous power, and stood firm in the air, sword pointing at the demon, shouting, “Behold, divine bull! Thou art the mount of Lord Lao, not a common beast. Even the richest kings and princes seek thy longevity and freedom in vain; they are but vain dreams. That thou, a beast, hast attained such station is due to the Master’s great grace and thine own deep root and long cultivation — a great honour. Thou shouldst advance and seek higher station, not abase thyself, fleeing to the mortal realm and harming men. The Master has, for thy misdeeds, banished thy keeper boy to earth; how canst thou rest? That great thunderbolt just now could have slain thee; know that it was sent by Lady Xuan-nü through the Lady of the Upper Origin to warn thee. Because thou art the Master’s mount, none dare harm thee utterly; else thy hundred lives would be ended. Understand this!” The demon, overcome, ceased resistance, all anger gone, and wept, confessing guilt and begging the Great Immortal’s mercy. The Fairy pointed once, saying “Stop,” and the sand ceased rising; half the demon’s body was buried and he could move no more.

This was the Fairy’s pity for the divine bull, trying to restrain him without full knowledge. She thought: this sand seems to understand human nature, rising and stopping at will. The trial succeeded, and she greatly rejoiced. She said, “Setting aside all else, in this matter a single grain of this divine sand can bury thee for three years or five; see now if thou canst save thyself. Thy life is spared not from pity for thy pleas, but for the Master’s sake. Know this: away from the Master, death waits all around. If thou canst repent and behave, thy future is boundless. The choice is thine. Since thou hast spirit and can change in a moment, know good and ill, think on these things. I go now; endure a while longer in the earth. These days thou hast feasted well; stay a few days more; soon thy new master will come for thee.”

She looked at the women, still bound high on pillars, who were not buried. She pointed, and their bonds fell. She led them to the back chamber, bade them clothe themselves, and told them all the past events and her own origin. She bade them look up and thank Lady Xuan-nü and the Lady of the Upper Origin for their rescue. The women thanked her in turn. The Fairy smiled and said, “The great family is now safely hidden somewhere in the mountains; the earth spirit will find a way to rescue them. No need to worry. Though some loss and shame have been suffered, life is safe. The root of the calamity lies in their eating much beef; in future they should kill less and thus gain boundless merit.”

Having spoken, she took leave. From afar came the lament of the divine bull. The Fairy wept and sighed, “When I came I heard the women’s weeping; now I hear his wails. The retribution is swift as thunder and lightning. Men’s failure to understand this leads them to violence; is it not pitiful and lamentable?”

On the way, she saw a white cloud in the west, bearing a shepherd boy flying swiftly. She knew it must be the Master Lao’s envoy to reclaim the divine bull. He landed in the great family’s courtyard. The Fairy then relaxed and returned to her cave.

How the Fairy sent back the great Wu will be told in the next chapter.
