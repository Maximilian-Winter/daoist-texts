# Chapter 35: How the Fairy Maiden Enters the World by Imperial Decree, and Young Master Zhao Gathers a Band to Court Women

It is related that the Fairy Maiden returned to her cave and reported to Lady Shangyuan the matter of subduing the Divine Ox. The lady smiled and said, “My congratulations! Though this be a small matter, it may be counted as the first merit of my junior sister in emerging from the mountain.” The Fairy Maiden smiled and replied, “Were it not for the gracious aid of Master and elder sister, one life would long since have returned to the nether world; where then is any merit to speak of?” Saying this, they exchanged a smile.

The Fairy Maiden first repaired to the Earth God’s temple, and commanded the Earth God to dispatch his ghostly soldiers to escort Master Wu home; she also gave a pill to Master Wu, bidding him swallow it to restore soul and strengthen body. The Earth God received the imperial decree and proceeded to perform his charge.

The Fairy Maiden then returned to her cave, where she had just received many defensive arts from Lady Shangyuan. Being exceedingly intelligent, she learned at once whatever was explained, and soon remembered all. The lady rejoiced and said, “My virtuous sister is so quick to comprehend; the time of your attainment of the Way is not far off. Your elder sister, though but humble and stationed in the celestial bureau, awaits your speedy advancement.” The Fairy Maiden gratefully bowed and thanked her.

Lady Shangyuan ordered her maidservants to retrieve the iron sand from Master Wu’s household. Seeing the Fairy Maiden praise this iron sand repeatedly, she generously bestowed it upon her, saying, “Hereafter, when you encounter formidable demons and spirits, you may use this substance to restrain them.” The Fairy Maiden was greatly pleased, and asked the name of this sand. The lady replied, “As to the nature of this sand, it is but a common iron sand such as is seen ordinarily. Only by my refining has it obtained these slight transformations; truly, it is of no great value.” The Fairy Maiden laughed and said, “Celestial treasures are often those of no worth; were all as you say, to be weighed and valued by men’s reckoning, they would become but goods at secondhand stalls.” The lady smiled faintly, then gave her a few words of admonition and took her leave.

Having sent the lady on her way, the Fairy Maiden remained in her cave practising the arts imparted by Lady Shangyuan until thoroughly mastered. In the blink of an eye, ten years had passed. The Lady Xuan then came down to the stone chamber with Lady Shangyuan and several disciples, imparting many methods of transformation, all of which the Fairy Maiden could comprehend.

The Lady Xuan commanded, “You may now descend the mountain. The present time is the Qin dynasty, where Emperor Yingzheng is exceedingly cruel. Soon many heroes will arise, the four seas will be disturbed, and the imperial throne will pass to the Liu family; the true Mandate of Heaven has appeared in Pei County. Your senior brothers Li Tieguai, Zhang Guo, and others have already been sent by the Master to the world to relieve suffering and enlighten those with fate; one among them is to be sent down to the mortal realm and will also attain true accomplishment. On this journey down, you may meet together. Many matters remain for you to accomplish; you must attend to them with diligence, neither neglecting nor fearing. This concerns your own merit and future, and is of great importance; you must be especially cautious.” The Fairy Maiden received these orders one by one.

Lady Xuan further bestowed upon her ten cinnabar pills, capable of restoring life and reviving the dead; a jade bottle to contain souls; and a golden needle, able to multiply into thousands and to strike the eyes of men. She earnestly warned, “Of these three treasures, only the cinnabar is an elixir of life to save men. Should you meet a person predestined to receive it, whose illness is critical, or who suffers grievous injury, or even who has been dead three days—if the body be yet uncorrupted—half a pill will restore soul and dispel disease; the wounds will heal. A further half pill will restore health and vigour. But not all may be given this freely; one must know that the span of life is fixed. Except for those of great virtuous merit and good deeds, none may have delay granted. It is said King Yama fixes the hour of death at the third watch; none may be allowed to live to the fifth watch. I do not speak only of the cinnabar, but teach you that in saving others you must first consider whether it be their fate to be saved, and whether saving them would contravene Heaven’s will. Thus it is seen that the word ‘doing good’ is not a matter lightly undertaken! Otherwise, throughout the vast world, every day many perish; even with the utmost compassion, how could one extend aid to all and prolong their days? Moreover, where would you find so many pills to revive the dead?”

The Fairy Maiden listened, perceiving this instruction to surpass her usual thoughts; she understood the meaning behind Lady Xuan’s words. For her heart was generous and her nature compassionate, and she often acted without weighing right or wrong, good or harm, but moved solely by a moment’s pity, regardless of the cost to her own happiness, as in the case of Master Wu’s household before. Lady Xuan’s caution was a fitting remedy, though veiled by the use of the cinnabar. At that moment Lady Shangyuan stood nearby, and, hearing these words, could not help but smile faintly at the Fairy Maiden.

The Fairy Maiden, more deeply convinced that Lady Xuan’s words came from true purpose, bowed with sound and silently said, “In obedience to Master’s command, how dare I disobey or forget? This journey down the mountain I shall be doubly cautious, holding the mandate ever in my heart. I dare not commit evil, nor even rashly perform good, but must examine all carefully. Though my merit be slight, and I cannot decide who should be helped or not, who should be saved or not, I shall use my own conscience as standard, mix it with Heaven’s law and human feeling, and act neither too close nor too distant, neither servile nor haughty. If I dare thus, Master will surely approve.”

Lady Xuan, seeing her sincerity, smiled with pleasure and said, “Very good indeed. My duties are many and I cannot often descend to earth to instruct you; but in critical moments I shall know beforehand. If correction be needed, your senior brothers will surely come to guide you; you need not fear.” She went on, “The purpose of the cinnabar is solely to save life; if misapplied, though Heaven will punish, the Heavenly heart is most merciful. As for the bottle and needle, these are for harm and killing. Regardless of right or wrong, when you use them, you must first have in mind the intention to kill or harm, and fear lest men escape your killing—this is certain. Such thoughts are called evil thoughts. We who cultivate the Way hold saving the world and relieving hardship as our foundation; if to protect the good we must first remove the violent, though meritorious in deed, our conscience must nevertheless bear the blame. Much more so where action is mistaken, killing in excess, or wounding upright men justly. The guilt accrued is great and cannot be offset by good. Once Heaven’s punishment falls, even I cannot save you. Is this not terrible? Therefore these things are best left unused, kept in deep reserve. Only in extremity, or where you harm none but are harmed yourself, and life or death is at stake, may you have no choice but to employ them. Yet still you must hold in mind the principle of letting go, resolving grievances and avoiding resentment; leaving some margin is itself a merit. Should you meet a man of the Way or a demon already grown strong, many who have laboured long, you must remember that reaching such a stage is no easy matter. If you can bring them to fulfilment, you must not kill but rather instruct them with kind words, or take them as your disciples. This is not impossible. But one word in warning: to take disciples and teach them is a very dangerous matter. The deeds and intentions of disciples, whether good or evil, are the responsibility of their master; this is not to be undertaken lightly, and you must take heed.”

These words filled the Fairy Maiden with awe and reverence; she prostrated herself and said, “I am young and inexperienced, and in all things unskilled. To receive the Master’s great and kind instruction, I now know that in the Way there are many dangers besides personal hardship. This causes me to tremble and be cautious, and to dare not speak rashly or act foolishly to bring punishment upon myself.” Lady Xuan bade her rise and smiled to comfort her, saying, “The first necessity for the cultivator is boldness. The timid cannot do evil, but neither can they accomplish good. We stand beyond Heaven and Earth, and must take upon ourselves all that is to be done in the world. To be ever afraid is to be a coward, not the conduct of a cultivator. In sum, one must be careful; especially when using magic arts, one must be very cautious. But careful does not mean timid or fearful. You are so clever, what need is there to learn these truths? Yet I think, since this is your first descent, and you have neither managed great affairs nor experienced the many subtleties and deceits of the human world, how could you fully judge? One small slip and you will be deceived. Thus I warn you again and again, with the utmost care and caution. Since you understand, I hope you will act accordingly, and not merely speak well or think well, but forget all when it comes to practice. That would be a grievous loss.” To each word Lady Xuan spoke, the Fairy Maiden answered, and when all was finished, she respectfully bowed several times. Then Lady Xuan and the other immortals and maidservants departed.

Because the Fairy Maiden’s friendship with the Earth God was close, and over many years she had received much care and attention from him, she went in person to bid him farewell. The Earth God, hearing that she was soon to journey far, was greatly reluctant. The Fairy Maiden comforted him, then took the treasures bestowed by Lady Xuan, dressed in Daoist robes all white from head to foot, which made her appear pure and noble beyond any earthly beauty. Returning to her cave, she sealed it with talismans and spells, then mounted upon a cloud and rose.

Her Master had said the present emperor was named Yingzheng, cruel and merciless, oppressing the people. She resolved to go and see what sort of tyrant he was, and among the oppressed populace to seek those with fate, to save as many as she could, which would be a merit. Having decided this, she made the hand seal and summoned an Earth God, asking the location of the emperor’s capital, the paths and methods to reach it. By chance an aged Earth God of many generations’ knowledge came, well versed in the rise and fall of past dynasties. Seeing the Fairy Maiden’s request, he did not spare words and related a long tale which the Fairy Maiden found novel and interesting. He then gave detailed directions to Xianyang. The Fairy Maiden thanked him repeatedly, parted, and with a swift cloud arrived at Xianyang. Choosing a place bustling with people, she alighted, but fearing notice, first transformed into a tiny flying insect, descending to the plain, and only when unseen resumed her original form.

It was just noon, early spring, the weather fair and temperate, the best season for men’s enjoyment and the beginning of all trades. The Fairy Maiden walked the city streets several times, observing shopkeepers and passers-by buying and selling, all with troubled faces and knitted brows, as if burdened by some care. She sighed and said, “It is said that when rulers are wise and ministers good, the people live in peace; but now there is a tyrant, and naturally the people suffer, who can be joyful?” She then went to a quiet place and found a temple finely built by the order of the First Emperor, who desired to meet immortals and hence established many Daoist shrines. Inside, an old Daoist came forth to greet her. The Fairy Maiden explained her wish to lodge there. The old Daoist, seeing her beauty, looked her up and down with some suspicion. She smiled and said, “Daoist, you gaze so intently; do you doubt that I am a good person?” The old man hastened to smile and said, “No, not so; but a young and beautiful Daoist like you should be enjoying great blessings in the world. Why come unbidden to this path outside the world? I do not meddle, but there are reasons within, which I dare not conceal lest trouble follow.” The Fairy Maiden was surprised, saying, “Every man has his own will; why should a young woman with beauty be bound to worldly joys, and not be allowed to leave the world to cultivate the Way? That is surely unreasonable.” The old man laughed and said, “Ah, then you have not understood my meaning. Since you have come to this humble shrine, and doubtless have not eaten, please enter the guest room and take some refreshment, that I may explain my difficult situation, so you will know it is out of kindness that I cannot detain you.” The Fairy Maiden, much perplexed, followed him to a small guest chamber.

The old Daoist said, “This place is called the Temple of Clear Emptiness. I am the steward here. We have more than ten priests, some deeply versed in the Daoist arts, and one named Fei Changfang, a true disciple of celestial immortals, whose power is very great indeed. These priests live here and receive support from the court. The temple was built less than three years ago, and all was peaceful at first. But this year, early in the first month, the son of official Zhao has been abusing his father’s influence. Knowing that noble maidens come here to incense the spirits, he often leads a band of ruffians and scoundrels, claiming to seek immortals. When they see a beautiful woman, regardless of her background, upon a secret signal they seize her. Sometimes they follow the women on leaving, to ambush them later. No good maiden escapes their notice; once caught, all are defiled. Some, fearing death and craving fame, submit and receive some benefits for a few days, then are discarded; others of noble family resist and are beaten until bruised, even endangering their relatives. This month already six or seven such incidents have occurred. Seeing you, so fair as a celestial immortal and in your prime, I say none of the maidens harmed before could compare to you; if they could not escape, how could you? I speak without offense; this Zhao young master is the son of Zhao Gonggong, the ‘Standing Chancellor,’ called Lord Gao; none in the world has such power. Many noble ladies have fallen prey; you, a Daoist, are like me, a humble one, and cannot claim such influence. So I urge you to dwell here; other matters will be bearable, but I fear when Zhao young master comes, your pure body and chastity may not be preserved. Is this not terrible? I beg you consider carefully. I am ninety years old and have never spoken falsely; please do not doubt me.”

The Fairy Maiden thanked him for his kindness, but having resolved to investigate the villainies of the Qin emperor and ministers, that she might save the suffering, she could not forsake this evil. Smiling, she said, “Your kindness is great. I am no tree or grass, and know gratitude; how could I mistake your meaning? But to be frank, I met a stranger in my youth who taught me some minor arts. Though not strong to harm others, I have some confidence in preserving my life and defending my body. Please assign me a small room to rest. If Zhao young master comes and I can avoid him, so much the better. Should he see me, I have means to make him retreat; I do not wish to bring strife or harm him, nor trouble your noble temple or yourself.”

The old Daoist was astonished, looked her over again and again, then joyfully exclaimed, “You have a countenance not of this world, and such beauty! Now at my age of over ninety, this is the first time I have seen such. I wonder if you are a true immortal come down to play among men? If so, fear not the trivial Zhao young master, nor even the present Qin...” At the word “Qin” he suddenly stopped, looked cautiously around, spat once, then laughed. “What times are these? What place is this? To be so garrulous at my age may bring me trouble tomorrow, and I fear this true immortal before me may not come to my aid!” Then, with a sudden flash of colour from black to blue to purple, he put on a most charming mien, turned to the Fairy Maiden and smiled, “Is it so, Daoist?”

The Fairy Maiden, seeing his sudden change from garrulousness to self-reproach and then to such a manner, could not help but laugh heartily. Knowing he dared not say more, for the capital was tightly controlled and spies surely watched, she recalled the ancient words, “Better to guard against the people’s speech than against the river’s flood,” and sighed. The old Daoist would not linger, but summoned a servant to escort the Fairy Maiden to a side chamber in the west wing, telling her to ask this servant for anything she might need.

The Fairy Maiden thanked him repeatedly, followed the servant out of the guest room and walked westward. Thinking deeply, she wondered which among the priests were men of the Way, and what powers they possessed; if possessing profound arts, she might visit and ask a few questions, which would be a good opportunity on this journey.

Lost in thought, she suddenly heard the sound of men’s laughter and chase behind her, and turned to see—alas!—the very group the old Daoist spoke of: Young Master Zhao and his band of lackeys were just entering the temple. Upon arrival, several flattering Daoists approached, boasting of a newly arrived peerless female Daoist priest, describing her beauty and form as matchless in heaven and earth, exceeding the beauties Zhao had so far acquired many times over. The old Daoist was escorting this woman to the guest quarters, and the young master was eager to meet.

The young master hurried to the guest quarters, just as the old Daoist was supervising servants tidying the rooms. Upon entering, the young master found no sign of the beauty. Among the lackeys was one named Wei Yingqin, who stepped forward before the young master spoke, seized the old Daoist’s headgear, then tugged his collar, shouting, “Wretched old man, where have you hidden my master’s celestial beauty?” The old Daoist, busy directing servants and startled by this, jumped back in fright, then turned with a smiling face and bowed deeply with a grand obeisance, replying, “Gentlemen, do you ask for the female Daoist who came just now?” The young master and his men laughed heartily at his manner. Hearing the question, the young master laughed and said, “Exactly so; weren’t you the one who entertained her? With such a treasure, you did not send word to your master, but wait for me to come search. Where have you hidden her? Should you not be beaten to death?” The old Daoist stuck out his tongue and laughed, “Master, you speak lightly. At my age of over ninety, my legs are no longer willing to serve my poor heart. I intended to keep her here, arrange her room, and then report to the court. But, seeing your great fortune, word must have reached your ears and you came speedily. Such swift means leave this dying old man no chance to act.”

This made the young master laugh aloud, and he bade Wei Yingqin release the old man. “This Daoist is a good man,” he said, “do not play harsh jokes. At his age, if you frighten him too much, he may fall ill tomorrow. If a case arises, my master will not come to your aid.” The lackeys laughed loudly, and old Wei muttered to himself but gave up. The old Daoist then sent one of his men to accompany the young master and his party to seek out the new immortal beauty.

Hearing the words “immortal beauty,” the young master laughed again. “See this old fellow,” he said, “so old and yet so lustful.” Saying no more, he led his men in a rush westward in pursuit of the Fairy Maiden.

The Fairy Maiden, both thoughtful and desirous to observe the temple’s scene, unawares was near when suddenly a whistle sounded. The band of lackeys swarmed around her, encircling her from all sides. Though skilled in Daoist arts and possessing courage, she was startled by this sudden violence.

How the Fairy Maiden fared under this predicament, will be told in the next chapter.
