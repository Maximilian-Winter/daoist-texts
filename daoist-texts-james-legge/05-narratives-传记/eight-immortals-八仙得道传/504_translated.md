# Chapter 36: The Immortal Maiden Insulted, The Loyal Son Quan Castrated Seeking the Lord

Now it chanced that the Immortal Maiden was surrounded on all sides by a band of ruffians and scoundrels under the command of Young Master Zhao. She cried aloud, "Immortal, pray stay thy steps; my young master entreats a word with thee." The Immortal Maiden, knowing well the hidden design, settled herself upright, unhurried and smiling, and asked, "From what place do you all come? And who is your young master? I, a poor Daoist, am one who dwells apart from the world, pursuing the Way in deep mountains, never associating or conversing with outsiders. Yet I know not wherefore your young master has summoned me?" As she spoke, Young Master Zhao quickly advanced, scattering the crowd, and before a word was spoken, made a profound obeisance to the Maiden, bowing down to the ground. The Maiden could only smile and return the salute with composure.

Then the young master said, "Long have I admired the fair beauty of the Immortal Sister, so comely and youthful, at the very prime of enjoyment. Why do you thus flee to a Daoist temple, mingling with that rabble of wild Daoists? It is like a piece of pure white jade buried in dog dung — is it not a pity?" The Immortal Maiden, hearing this, laughed so heartily that she nearly fell, and after restraining herself, replied, "According to your view, what should be done then?" The young master laughed and said, "Does the Immortal Sister not yet understand my meaning? I am none other than the son of the Grand Eunuch Zhao, who now serves the Emperor."

Before he had finished, the Immortal Maiden interrupted with a smile, "How is it that there are eunuchs at the Emperor’s side? Is he not a great-uncle of the Emperor?" Hearing this, Young Master Zhao’s face flushed red, and he laughed, "These matters are not for the Immortal Sister to understand; I will speak plainly. My family is now the most powerful and wealthy in the capital and its environs. As to all a man’s needs — clothing, food, dwelling, and pleasures — our mansion is the most exquisite, second only to the imperial household. In my judgment, the Immortal Sister, with such a heavenly appearance, like a celestial immortal, should not conceal her grace in a wild mountain or a Daoist temple, but rather should not be made to suffer in these humble places."

The Immortal Maiden would not let him finish, saying further, "Well, I understand your meaning now. By your reckoning, it is to display your family’s dignity. Besides, a beauty like myself should be moved to your mansion, so as not to wrong my appearance. But is this not so?" The young master, hearing this, could not conceal his delight, gesticulating with joy, and quickly assented, "Not a word amiss! Immortal Sister is a being like a celestial immortal; only a mansion and gardens such as mine could be fit for your abode. As to clothes of silk and brocade, delicacies of mountain and sea, not a single item is lacking. Speak but the word 'want,' and it shall be brought before you instantly, for your enjoyment. Such a state of things, save for my household, where else shall you find its equal? But none besides Immortal Sister is worthy to enjoy such blessings. You are wise; consider, is it better to dwell with these wild Daoists at the temple, or to return with me to enjoy days of wealth and ease?"

Without hesitation, the Immortal Maiden smiled brightly and said, "If your family indeed has these blessings, even if you did not invite me, I should seek my way there myself. Moreover, since it is a young master such as yourself, one close to the Emperor’s eunuch, so illustrious a personage entreating me, how could I fail to visit for a few days? Let us go!" Turning about, she beckoned to the young master. The young master, seeing her half in earnest, half in jest, and her careless manner, words and deeds all beyond his expectation, found himself at a loss to discern her true intent — whether she yielded or resisted. Yet, as she was a frail woman, and he had many retainers and a lofty mansion, was he afraid she would fly away? Seeing her beckon repeatedly, he followed after her.

The Immortal Maiden laughed and pointed at the crowd, saying, "What manner of folk are these? I find them vexing to behold. Would it not suffice to leave them waiting here?" The young master hesitated. But when the Immortal Maiden pointed at them, every one of the men stared wide-eyed, halted their steps, and could not move a foot.

The young master did not perceive this, and said, "These men are here to guard you and me; why do you dislike them?" The Immortal Maiden made no reply, but lightly tapped him on the shoulder and said, "Let us go." The young master, unable to resist, followed obediently behind her and hurried out the door.

Within the temple courtyard, a group of Daoists were discussing the meeting of the Daoist maiden with the young master. They said, "If she is sensible, she might become a ready-made young mistress. But if she proves stubborn, her life may turn through ten cycles of transmigration, and none may avenge her grievances."

Others said, "What woman does not covet romance and wealth? This Daoist maiden must have suffered great loss to become a recluse. Her heart surely desires this. With such an opportunity, why should she pose or make a scene?" The Immortal Maiden, just emerging with the young master, heard these words and smiled to herself. She thought to chastise these spiteful fellows with a little magic, when suddenly a Daoist came forward. Seeing the Immortal Maiden making finger gestures and muttering incantations as if performing a rite, he smiled slightly, opened his mouth wide, and blew gently toward those whom the Immortal Maiden had enclosed in her spell. Instantly, her magic lost all effect. Greatly alarmed, she bowed to the Daoist. The Daoist returned the salute and said, "Fellow Daoist, why do you oppose these ignorant and foolish men? One who cultivates the Way should be magnanimous; where is there room for hatred? For my part, I beg you to pardon them."

The Immortal Maiden wished to explain the matter to the Daoist. But as Young Master Zhao followed closely behind, her movements were hindered. She could only nod and say, "I will tell you in due time," and then departed. Young Master Zhao, as if entranced, followed closely after.

The Daoist clapped his hands and laughed heartily, saying, "Good, good, good! This fellow has met his match today, and the loss he suffers will not be slight." The Immortal Maiden, astonished, turned and smiled at the Daoist, showing her admiration for his high Daoist skill and her hope for his assistance. The Daoist nodded smiling, but said no more.

The Immortal Maiden left the temple and pushed Young Master Zhao ahead, scolding, "Do you not lead the way, but set me before you to open the path?" Zhao said nothing, walked forward hastily, and made straight for his mansion. The road between was long, but the Immortal Maiden felt her feet grow light as if floating on clouds, and in a blink she had vanished from sight. She exclaimed, "Is this not the Immortal art of shrinking the earth? My master and senior sisters possess this skill; they are far away and will not aid me. Could this be the Daoist’s doing? Yet the Daoist’s countenance is upright and just; he is no rogue who aids evil. To accept some help is not unbecoming."

Thus she arrived at the gate of the Zhao mansion. Young Master Zhao did not look back, but rushed inside. The guards and servants all stood to attention as she followed. Seeing that the young master did not greet the Immortal Maiden, they suspected they had not come together. Yet knowing the young master’s ill temper, if he had summoned this female Daoist, they would not dare oppose her, lest they suffer grievous punishment. So without a word, they led her deeper through many courtyards to a spacious hall, the place where Zhao Gao received guests. The Immortal Maiden reached out and tugged the young master, saying, "Stop!" and he halted.

At that moment, servants came in and maids went out, surrounding the young master, questioning why he did not enter the inner chamber. Seeing the Immortal Maiden, all praised her as a celestial immortal brought back by the young master. But the young master said nothing, standing dumbfounded by her side, drooling, and rolling his eyes as if possessed by some evil spirit. The men and women present realized something was amiss and all looked at the Immortal Maiden, unsure of what was happening.

The Immortal Maiden smiled at the crowd and said, "You probably do not know me. I am one who has renounced the world to cultivate the Dao, never knowing the meaning of enjoyment, nor dreaming of wealth and honor. The pleasures of clothing and food are strange to me. But this young master of yours esteems me; he says he will invite me to your home to enjoy rare and peerless delicacies, garments, dwellings, and amusements — such great blessings. Should I not accept his invitation? Surely your young master agrees with me. If I were ungrateful, I would not come. So I hearkened to him and, without ceremony, followed from the Pure and Empty Temple here, hoping that he would soon present the blessings he promised, so that a never-enjoying soul like mine might taste such unheard-of delights. I must hasten to Mount Hua to find a Daoist friend and cannot delay. Yet he has come all this way, looking the fool, neither greeting nor speaking, making me embarrassed. I dare not leave him here alone, so I have come with him. Laugh if you will, this silly fellow stands like a wooden figure; see how he looks like a dead pig or dog. I wonder when he will deliver on those many blessings he promised me. Surely he is not one to promise gifts and then cleanly renounce them?" Saying this, she laughed scornfully at the crowd.

Those present, now aware that the Immortal Maiden must possess some magic, understood that the young master had offended her, and she had cast a spell to bewilder his soul, following after him to take revenge.

As they whispered among themselves, a man suddenly came running, drenched in sweat. He was a deputy general in the household, often accompanying the young master on errands, usually engaged in dubious affairs. This day he had taken leave and not accompanied the young master to the Pure and Empty Temple. He now brought news that the young master’s retinue had been bound by a female Daoist’s magic at the temple; their speech and movement were restrained, and that the female Daoist had escorted the young master back to the mansion. He hurried to report this.

Entering the hall and seeing the scene, he pointed at the Immortal Maiden and called out, "Why do you not report to the master and seize this witch? The young master is caught in her magic." He related fully what he had heard. Several clever women present quickly went to report inside. The Immortal Maiden, however, feigned indifference, pacing the hall with a slight smile, nodding to the deputy general as he spoke. The rough deputy, eager to gain merit and favor, rolled up his sleeves, clenched his fists, and shouted, "Brothers, come! Let us seize this witch; to see the master will be a good thing!" Hearing this, and seeing the Immortal Maiden unmoved, the crowd doubted her power and rushed forward to attack her.

The Immortal Maiden laughed aloud and waved her whisk thrice around; all saw that about her stood many copies of Young Master Zhao, each waving to them. When seeking the Immortal Maiden, only laughter was heard, but no figure seen.

Fearing harm to the young master’s body, none dared strike her boldly. They shouted and raged in confusion, uncertain if any of the many young masters was genuine. If so, to strike wildly might kill him. They stopped and watched.

Presently, a servant announced the arrival of the master. They hurried out to meet and, in a crowd, a tall old man with a white face and no beard was borne in with noise and clamour. The Immortal Maiden pointed and drove the many young masters forward, hiding herself, and commanding, "Kneel!" All the young masters prostrated themselves. She then commanded, "Why no cry of 'Grandfather'?" And at once all cried out, "Grandfather!" Their shouts shook the courtyard like the clamour of a thousand armies on the field of battle.

This so startled and troubled Lord Zhao Gao that he was at a loss, and the men and women present could not help but laugh aloud. Unable to deal with the Immortal Maiden and unable to discern the true young master, Zhao Gao, in anger and shame, vented his wrath on his servants, railing at them with curses and reproaches.

Poor fellows, come to please and failing, were thus cursed, their ill fortune complete.

Meanwhile, the hall was packed with the many Zhao young masters, and the crowd between them made the place unbearably crowded. Zhao Gao sought a path to the inner chamber, but wherever he stepped, another young master blocked the way and knelt. After ten attempts he found ten more young masters had appeared behind, all kneeling as before. Zhao Gao was scared witless and at a loss. Then suddenly he had an idea, and quickly retreated, leaving the hall. As the sedan chairs had not yet dispersed, he mounted one and hastened to court. At the palace gate, as chief eunuch and favourite of the Emperor, he passed unchallenged and went straight in.

Learning that the Emperor was at the Western Palace with the Empress, he hurried there, and knelt long before the Emperor, beating his head and weeping like rain, crying, "Your Majesty, save my life, save the lives of my family!"

The Emperor was then discoursing with the Empress on ancient and modern matters of immortals, and said, "I, as Son of Heaven, govern all beneath the skies. Yet why should my fortune be less than that of an immortal? Immortals may live long; though my rank be higher, when my time comes I must still relinquish life. Remembering how I have borne arms and quelled disorder in my days, it has been no easy matter. If those who enjoy honours must then die, is not that the greatest sorrow and regret?"

The Empress asked, "The last time Your Majesty sent Xu Fu with a band of youths and maidens across the sea to Penglai, seeking the way of immortality, why has he not returned?"

The Emperor shook his head, "Xu Fu is loyal and honest. I entrusted him with this great matter, trusting he would not fail. But the sea is unlike the land; the duration cannot be foreseen, for storms and waves are frequent. When the weather is foul, travel must cease, and the boat lie at anchor. Only when skies clear and winds cease may the oars be resumed. Now is autumn, the worst time for travel. Delay is inevitable. Besides, the location of Penglai is only recorded in books; none have really gone there. Xu Fu was given five years to seek the elixir. It may take longer, but this undertaking is not easy; if the elixir be found, a delay is no matter."

Before the Empress could answer, Zhao Gao burst into the palace, startling both Emperor and Empress. They asked, "What troubles bring you here? Speak quickly; I will settle the matter for you."

Zhao Gao wept, "Your Majesty and Empress, you have honoured me greatly; I have no complaint. Yet today, after court, a female demon appeared in my household, and has so insulted my sworn son and attendants as never before in my life. As a high minister, this concerns the national order. If within the imperial carriage or mansion gates a demon dares so to insult me, it is not only an affront to me but to the laws and dignity of the realm. I have considered well: as ruler of the four seas, with authority over Yin and Yang and the three realms, I beseech Your Majesty to pity my innocent suffering, to uphold the law’s dignity, to visit my home in person, so that though the demon be present, it shall be subdued. My family will be blessed, and all under Heaven share Your Majesty’s grace."

Having finished, Zhao Gao glanced at the Emperor’s countenance. Yet the First Emperor showed no fear, but laughed heartily, and spoke words hard to understand.

To know what he said, we must await the next chapter.
