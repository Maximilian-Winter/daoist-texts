# Chapter 49: The Immortal Master of the Purple Mist Cave Discusses Cause and Effect — The Heroic King beneath the Sahā Tree Transforms into a Craftsman

Now it came to pass that Master Iron Crutch having arranged the matter of the transmigration of the husband and wife Fan and Meng, led a company of elder brothers and disciples, and together they proceeded to the Purple Mist Cave on Mount Hua. Fei Fei and Dian Dian knelt to receive them within. Master Iron Crutch took possession of the foremost chamber of the stone cave, while he assigned the five persons — including the Immortal Maiden He — to dwell in two separate chambers, divided by sex on right and left; and the two attendants Fei and Dian were sent forth each to attend them separately. On this day, having assembled all present, he discoursed once more upon the meaning of the sutras. The multitude felt as if their minds were anointed with fresh oil, and were exceedingly pleased.

After the main instruction, the Master addressed He the Immortal Maiden and the other four: "You have repeatedly inquired of me concerning the past lives and the cause and effect of Fan Qiliang and Meng Jiangnu. Now I may in outline speak somewhat thereof. In former days there was a sovereign named Hou Yi, valiant and skilled in archery, who once obtained the elixir of immortality from the Queen Mother of the West, and prepared to select a most auspicious day to return thanks to her, and then to take the medicine. Therefore he entrusted the medicine temporarily to his consort Chang’e for safekeeping. Hou Yi was cruel and savage, addicted to war and arms, and long entertained designs upon the Son of Heaven himself, aspiring to be emperor. Chang’e often remonstrated with him in vain; he regarded her as a thorn in his eye, and hated her as though he would sever her in twain with a single stroke. Only because of her surpassing beauty, matchless in the world, did he refrain from destroying her. Hou Yi’s heart could not truly cast her away, so he kept her alive as a kind of plaything. Now Chang’e had formerly been an attendant of the Queen Mother of the West, but was exiled on account of some offence. One born with celestial affinity is naturally clever and quick-witted; seeing how Hou Yi treated her, could she fail to be on her guard? She also longed to free herself from him at the earliest, lest she suffer at his cruel hands hereafter. But as Hou Yi kept strict watch, she could not escape the palace gates; day by day she sat sorrowful within her prison, having no means to save herself. It was also not fitting that she should perish violently; Hou Yi’s life was not to be prolonged. Having long neglected Chang’e, and merely gone through the motions with her, he now, not knowing what to do, unwisely entrusted the elixir to her.

When Chang’e had obtained the medicine, she thought thus: 'Whether it be potent or not, I myself cannot escape death; better by taking this medicine to ascend on high, even if I become no true immortal, yet I may flee this hardship, and not fear his further harm. If the elixir be inert, and after taking it I remain but a captive upon the chopping-block, imprisoned within the deep palace, then when he returns and inquires after the medicine, will I have any hope of life? If then he slay me, better at once to take my own life.' So she placed about her all the means of self-destruction, such as knives and ropes, preparing that if the medicine should not bear her upward, she would end her life. Having made all ready, without hesitation she took the medicine into her hand and swallowed it. Presently a fragrance pervaded her inmost heart; a pleasure unknown before filled her whole being. The medicine was no larger than a bean, and was swallowed whole without mastication. Chang’e felt her spirit clear and sweet, her vital energy increased tenfold; her whole body seemed to be as if freed from all weight. Rejoicing, she closed her eyes and concentrated, sitting quietly for an hour. Then a heat arose from the crown of her head and reached her lower abdomen, spreading throughout her limbs and bones, everywhere bringing a surpassing quickness and delight.

This was indeed the elixir which the Queen Mother of the West, using the true fire of the sun in her five-element furnace, had refined, and then by means of her own samādhi vital fire, had dried and completed. A tyrant such as Hou Yi, no less lawless than the present Emperor Ying Zheng, how could the Queen Mother have entrusted him with such a celestial pill? Truly it was because she had calculated that Hou Yi must entrust it to Chang’e, and by his hand cause it to enter her mouth, thus enabling her to ascend to heaven. The Queen Mother’s calculation could not err. Indeed, Chang’e’s surreptitious taking of the medicine wrought the power of lightness and flight, enabling her to ascend to the heavens. After sitting quietly for an hour, she suddenly thought that delay was unwise; if she could fly away, she must do so quickly; if not, she should die early, lest he shoot her down. Rising at once, she stepped forth from the hall and courtyard, and looked upward at the sky, where a bright moon hung high in the air. She thought, 'The moonlight is so pure and clear; the scenery must be excellent there. If I could fly into the moon palace, and dwell there for some time, even should Hou Yi pursue me to the heavens and slay me with a shower of arrows, I would be content.' While thus thinking, unknowingly she formed another celestial affinity. She suddenly felt the ground beneath her feet grow light and she rose into the air. At first she flew slowly, then higher and faster, reaching half-way to heaven. As joy and fear mingled in her heart, by chance Hou Yi returned and looked upward, seeing a beautiful woman rising among the clouds, greatly astonished. His eyes, sharper than ordinary, as befitted his mastery of the divine bow, soon recognised his beloved consort Chang’e. His heart understood at once, and he roared like thunder. Fortuitously having his bow and arrows at hand, he aimed aloft at Chang’e and loosed his arrow. Yet before the arrow could reach her, Chang’e’s cloud path was swifter than Hou Yi’s arrow. This was because Chang’e was utterly without Taoist power; moreover, her ascent was but the flight of the body, lacking great skill, and hence far inferior to the flight of ordinary immortals. Hou Yi’s archery was exceedingly precise; how could that arrow fail to hit? Yet after the whizz of the arrow, there followed a cry in mid-air. Poor delicate Chang’e could not endure the blow. Fortunately, being in mid-air, the force of the arrow was spent; it only wounded her toe. Still the pain was so great that she swooned and could not stand, falling headlong, tumbling feet upward to the ground. Hou Yi rejoiced greatly, and hastened to seize Chang’e. The place where Chang’e fell was but a hundred paces from where Hou Yi stood. He strode forth and pursued her with all his might, but strangely though he chased long, he could not overtake her. Hou Yi suspected his own eyes were dimmed by drink, and called forth many soldiers to seize Chang’e. Poor Chang’e, alone and feeble, already faint from her fall, was unable to withstand the rough treatment of these armed men."

At this point Master Iron Crutch paused, and those listening all felt pity for Chang’e, especially Tonghui and the Immortal Maiden and Fei Fei, being women, their hearts were softer than men's. Beyond pity, they clenched their fists and each perspired coldly. Tonghui, fretful, could not wait to hear more, and hurriedly asked: "Master Uncle, was it indeed that Chang’e was slain by that foolish sovereign? Would the sovereign of the immortals, the Queen Mother of the Jade Pool, deceive people with a false medicine?"

Master Iron Crutch made no answer, but just then Zhongli Quan smiled derisively. Master Iron Crutch did not reply to her question, but smiling faintly asked Zhongli Quan: "Ah Quan, why do you laugh so?" Zhongli Quan said: "I laugh that this elder brother asked so foolishly, and yet is more impatient than I, interrupting the Master before he has finished, and rashly asking such a silly question. Have you not heard the tale of Chang’e in the moon? Chang’e still dwells in the moon palace to this day. If she had truly been slain by Hou Yi’s arrow, and after death could not enter the moon palace, how could she still be there?"

Master Iron Crutch heard this and laughed heartily, nodding his head: "Your reasoning well answers Tonghui’s question. The clearest thing in the world is the moon; the realm of the moon is more serene and pure than the Isles of Penglai beyond the sea, or the immortal mountains on the ocean. No matter how beautiful and refined Chang’e is, her body remains but a mortal frame, one who was once wed and consort to a cruel king; such a body is the most unclean in the moon palace. Although you have not attained the Great Way, you know that the Lord of Taiyin Star is the ruler of the moon palace. She is the third princess of the Jade Emperor, dwelling close to the Emperor himself; who is there more noble than she? Yet her nature is singular and exceptional; she sees both heaven and earth, yet lacks any trace of elegance or refinement; dwelling in the celestial court is like being imprisoned in a dungeon, without a day of ease or joy. Though the Jade Emperor has sought out the most serene and beautiful places in heaven and on earth, to provide the third princess with exquisite mansions for her seclusion and cultivation, the princess herself chose only a corner of the moon palace as her abode, most to her liking. Besides this, there is nowhere on earth or heaven clean and pure enough, all are unsuitable for residence. The Emperor was at his wit’s end and could only appoint her as the Lord of Taiyin Star, granting the moon palace as her dwelling; then the princess was at peace and contented. This princess’s aloofness and purity are so intense that though Chang’e is very refined, she cannot compare with that spotless and tranquil body. Chang’e’s impurity lies in her having been Hou Yi’s consort. As for her character, she is different from ordinary people, possessing a certain refinement and distinction. Moreover, she has ever loved the bright moon, and even in adversity longs for the moon’s abode, fulfilling a long-cherished wish; though dead, she bears no resentment. On this point, she may be said to be a comrade and sympathiser of the Lord of Taiyin."

Master Iron Crutch continued: "It happened that the Lord of Taiyin was returning from a visitation to the celestial palace, passing by here. She chanced to sense Chang’e’s sincere heart, and was involuntarily moved. Peering through the myriad clouds, she used her divine sight to gaze upon the mortal realm, and beheld Chang’e wandering in sorrow and longing. The Lord pondered a moment and understood the matter; seeing her love for the moon and pitying her ill fate, she wished to rescue her to the palace to attend her side. Yet, on the one hand, she found Chang’e’s body too impure; on the other, she feared she could not explain matters to the Queen Mother. While in this dilemma, Chang’e suddenly sped upward, flying swiftly towards the moon palace. The Lord was still in doubt, unknowing the truth, when she saw Hou Yi draw his bow and, full drawn, shoot Chang’e down to earth. Seeing this, the Lord was glad, and quickly stretched out her index finger to make a downward sweep, lengthening the distance between Hou Yi and Chang’e by three or four li. Turning to her attendant celestial officials she said: ‘I would fain take Chang’e back to the palace, but her body is too impure, and I fear to wrong the Queen Mother. Now that she has fallen, her body is surely broken, and her soul must have left the body. You must hasten to bring her soul to me. As for her stubborn frame, though impure, it must not fall into Hou Yi’s hands again; use divine wind to carry her to a place where no man walks, and there burn her to ashes. Then return to the Jade Pool and explain this matter clearly to the Queen Mother.’ The celestial officials received her orders and began their rites. While watching Chang’e’s soul depart her body and seizing it, they raised a great wind and blew Chang’e’s stubborn body to a vacant spot by the sea, summoned the local earth god, and burnt her to ashes, and then the wind blew her until she vanished without trace. Because Chang’e had taken the celestial pill, after falling she was but faint and did not die. Had the Lord not taken away her soul, she might have recovered at once and would again have suffered at Hou Yi’s hands; then indeed she would have been unable either to live or die. Thanks to the celestial official who carried away her soul, and to the Lord who lengthened her path, though Hou Yi was cruel, he could not seize even her corpse, but she was borne by the wild wind to the sea shore. Hou Yi could only stamp his feet in rage and return to his palace in gloom."

When Master Iron Crutch came to this point, Tonghui laughed: "So it turns out that Chang’e must die before she is better off. Master Uncle, if you had explained this earlier, we would not have been so anxious over the ancients in vain." Master Iron Crutch smiled: "Truly, no man becomes a man without passing through some danger and hardship. Much less can immortal life be attained by chance and folly." Zhongli Quan said: "In my view, the Queen Mother’s elixir is still not altogether efficacious. Though called the medicine of immortality, why does one faint at the touch of a divine arrow? Were it not for the Lord lengthening her path and sending others to seize her soul, she would surely have died at Hou Yi’s hand. Is it not that the medicine is powerless?" Tonghui and the Immortal Maiden laughed: "You speak too far. The Queen Mother’s elixir is surely efficacious. As you say, how could one of mortal body ascend to the heavens? How could one utterly destitute of Taoist power follow the Lord of the moon and join the ranks of immortals? To say that she suffered a violent death is another matter, unrelated to the elixir’s virtue. Is it to be supposed that after taking the elixir one may act at will, and that neither sword nor fire nor water can harm her? That would be a medicine of eternal life indeed, a talisman to avert all danger."

Master Iron Crutch heard this and smiled, nodding: "Nowadays many foolish men vainly seek the Way of Immortality without cultivation, even nourishing many alchemists and charlatans who burn mercury and refine pills, imagining thereby to live forever and never grow old, without needing to do good or seek pain. Such men are indeed foolish to the extreme. They know not that the elixir serves only to strengthen sinews and bones, aiding the work of cultivation; it is not connected with the affairs of heavenly immortals, nor greatly concerned with the study of the heart and nature. Therefore those who take the pill must at once hasten their cultivation, so that the power of the pill and their own skill may mutually respond, bringing enhancement with less effort. If, as you say, the matter were otherwise, and the taker of the pill were reckless and unrestrained, it would not be that the pill’s power was void, but that he would surely incur the wrath of Heaven. Can the power of Heaven fail to cause him a violent death?" This discourse made all laugh.

Master Iron Crutch went on: "Chang’e’s arrival in the moon palace was a good place for her to settle and establish her destiny; she followed the Lord with joy, passing her days without restraint or care. Yet Hou Yi was not one to suffer loss lightly. He was originally the black tiger star of evil descending to earth, taught from youth by a famous master, and possessed some innate foundation. But his conduct was crooked and his deeds absurd, so he fell into the path of demons. Then a member of the demon cult told him that Chang’e was now in the moon, and taught him the art of flight, and the drawing of bow and arrow, bidding him storm the moon palace, and demand the Lord surrender Chang’e, on pain of utter destruction of the moon and its immortals. It is laughable that the moon palace, so pure and serene, has ever seen such a wild man or such a tumult. Moreover, the Lord residing deep in the palace never knew of war or arms; all the immortals there obey her wholly, spending tranquil and free days. Never in their dreams would they have thought that over one Chang’e such a great trouble would arise. Though the Lord might foresee, she was careless; whatever might be, she never imagined such a pure place could suffer such troubles.

Just then, as the Lord and her attendants were discoursing on the affairs of Heaven, a great tumult was heard outside the hall, and the Lord was greatly startled. Amidst cries and shouts, the name Chang’e was called aloud. The Lord composed herself and calculated, sighing: 'Evil obstacles, evil obstacles! How dare this beast be so reckless as to come here? Surely some demon has taught him foul arts to dare come alone. I have long been too careless, failing to summon soldiers for guard. Moreover, my life is solitary and peaceful, competing not with others, and having forsaken the splendour of the celestial palace, I willingly keep this remote and lonely place. I abhor war and all the cruel and sharp weapons. Now, even if I call on Heaven for help, it is too late; must I go out myself and seize this demon beast? Surely he dares not be rude before me; yet I lose face and go against my usual purpose. What can be done?' While pondering, Chang’e knelt and wept, saying: 'Because of me, your Honour, you have been startled, and your officers, sisters, and the people have suffered. My crime is great. I beseech you to deliver me to the demon, to end the strife and avoid further calamity.' She wept without ceasing. The Lord angrily said: 'What talk is this? Since you are here with me, you are mine. The Queen Mother, for my sake, does not summon you back; how can you be carried off by a demon? Not only would I lose face before the Queen Mother, but all the immortals of the moon palace are pure maidens; if any evil villain should come to claim you by foul arts, should I deliver you one by one? That would be unjust, and such a custom must not be allowed to spread. You retire now; I have a plan.'

Chang’e dared not speak further, kowtowed, and withdrew to one side. The Lord thought a while and commanded that the elder Wu Gang be summoned, and sent a celestial official to Hou Yi, saying: 'The Lord has decreed that Chang’e is now to be sent back to her former mistress, the Queen Mother of the Jade Pool; her summons has been issued. You must wait a while, and not act rudely or cause disturbance in the moon palace, lest you bring down Heaven’s wrath.' Hou Yi bowed and obeyed.

When the official returned with these orders, Wu Gang also arrived. The Lord instructed: 'Hou Yi, using his sorcery, disturbs the moon palace and utters reckless words, demanding Chang’e. You must proceed thus and so to convey the decree. If he obeys, take him to the Sahā tree below, and so forth, and be careful to err not.' Wu Gang went to Hou Yi and declared: 'The Lord commands: Though Hou Yi is Chang’e’s husband, his nature is foolish and violent, intolerable to Heaven. Taking his beloved wife is a warning from on high. Their fate is not yet fulfilled, the red thread may yet be tied. But Hou Yi was wrong to disturb the moon palace and is guilty of a capital offense. Yet in consideration of their conjugal affection, and his rashness, the matter may be pardoned. Now the Lord finds the palace insufficient in lodging, and intends to build a hundred jade mansions in the western garden. The first task is to fell the great Sahā tree which blocks the way. It is reported that Hou Yi is unmatched in valour; he is therefore commanded to fell the tree and atone for his crime. When his guilt is expiated, Chang’e may be delivered to him to return to the lower world.' Hearing this, Hou Yi thought: 'I am peerless in courage and strength, unmatched in heaven and earth. Ten days ago I obeyed Emperor Yao’s command and shot down nine suns. Having done such great deeds, how difficult can it be to fell this one tree? It will surely be done in no time.' He repeatedly bowed, saying he obeyed the command. Wu Gang then gave him a large saw and led him to the Sahā tree in the garden, bidding him begin at once; he also hung a basket of wine and food upon the branches, smiling and saying: 'I have observed your great courage and strength, rare indeed since ancient times; surely this small task will not take long to complete. I have hung this basket of food upon the branches; when the tree falls and the basket descends, you may refresh yourself.' Hou Yi laughed: 'No need for so long; watch me.' Then he squatted down firmly, poised to saw the wood. Wu Gang, following the Lord’s instructions, chanted spells, traced several circles about where Hou Yi sat, and shouted sharply. Hou Yi’s body became rooted as if growing into the earth, unable to move. Hou Yi now knew he had fallen into their trap. Yet being a man of resolve, he was not angry but smiled and said a remarkable thing: 'Our matter is one of skill and strength. It is laughable that I, a hero without equal, should be deceived thus. It shows my skill is less than that of your Lord of the Stars. Since that is so, I should submit to her, and need not persist in foolish stubbornness. But there is one thing I must say: Though I should not have broken into the moon as the Lord says, for the sake of conjugal love, my rashness is excusable. Since the Lord has consented, I dare not disobey. I bow with reverence, because the Lord is the Jade Emperor’s princess, as much as the Emperor himself. We are all stars under the Jade Emperor’s dominion; how dare I not pay proper homage? But for the Lord’s sake, to use such deceit to lure men into her snare on behalf of that lowly Chang’e, I hold my life cheap no longer. How will future generations regard the Lord as an immortal?' These words were sharp and reasonable." At this, all laughed.

As to how Wu Gang dealt with Hou Yi, Master Iron Crutch could not remember for the moment. To know how Wu Gang replied, patience is asked; the matter will be explained in the next chapter.
