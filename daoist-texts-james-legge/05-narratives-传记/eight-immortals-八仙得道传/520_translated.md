# Chapter 52: On the Electric Power as One Face Throughout Ten Thousand Directions â€” The Transmission of the Mysterious Scripture to Various Disciples, Each According to Their Destiny

Meanwhile, within the Purple Mist Cave on Mount Taihua, the assembly of immortals was engaged in discourse concerning the manner of the death of the First Emperor Qin Shi Huang. Suddenly, Fei Fei entered swiftly, reporting that Elder Brother Yang of Mount Tai had arrived. Master Iron Crutch smiled, saying, "I reckon he should have come by now. Let him be called in." Fei Fei then hastened out and shortly returned, bringing in Yang Ren, who respectfully bowed eight times before Master Iron Crutch. The Master bade him pay respects to the elder brothers and uncles, and then, with Fei Fei and Dian Dian, sat him at the head.

Master Iron Crutch smiled and addressed Immortal Woman He, saying, "You first urged me to hasten to rescue Master Liu of the Qingxu Temple; why then did you cease to speak of it?" Immortal Woman He laughed and replied, "At first, I was indeed anxious on his behalf, but upon seeing how Elder Brother attends to matters with utmost care, sparing none who ought to be saved, and performing every task required without omission, I thought that since Master Liu had been repeatedly admonished by me, yet persisted in neglect, and since Elder Brother's deeds could not be in error, it must be that this man had taken a path to his own death, and hence was beyond saving. Therefore, he could not accept Elder Brother's grace. As my learning is limited and my cultivation slight, I ought always to follow Elder Brother's lead, and thereby avoid errors. I dare not interfere with those whom Elder Brother chooses not to save. If I dare not meddle, why then should I speak further to Elder Brother?"

Hearing this, Master Iron Crutch could not restrain a hearty laugh, and, pointing to Yang Ren, said, "Look well, this is Master Liu whom Zhao Gao seized. It was by my taking advantage of the First Emperor's summoning of magicians that I dispatched him to the capital to be engaged. Afterwards, he was assigned to Qingxu Temple to serve as a Taoist priest. I charged him with the duty that when the First Emperor's wickedness was full, he should hasten to assassinate him. For nearly a hundred years, the people endured the calamities of war and harsh taxation. It was hoped that after unification, with a true Mandate Heaven Emperor, even if the glories of Wen, Wu, Cheng, and Kang could not be restored, yet the times would no longer be like those of the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, when war and suffering were unceasing, and the people destitute. But since the First Emperor's accession, boasting of Heaven's mandate, he has been cruel and violent, trampling on the people's lives more than in the time of the Seven Kingdoms. Indeed, all this is decreed by fate, and not the fault of the Emperor alone. Even Qin Shi Huang himself is but a demon lord born according to calamity. Such men first violate the laws of Heaven and are cast down to the mortal world. They must endure the punishments of the mortal realm in place of the heavenly penalties; both sovereign and subjects are governed by fate, and cannot act autonomously. Yet the emperor, styled as Son of Heaven and parent of the people, if he could govern with righteous policy, might still call upon Heaven. If he could cherish the heart of self-examination as did Cheng Tang in seven matters, and bear the guilt of King Wu upon himself, he might yet reverse his fortunes and turn great calamity into auspiciousness. Know that this is the burden of the sovereign. If, knowing that it is impossible, he yet intensifies his harm to the people, what honour can there be in such a ruler? The people have no need of such an emperor. Now the border guards of the Great Wall have already been chosen as leaders, raising their axes and banners, rising in rebellion. The true Mandate Heaven Emperor has appeared. It is now impermissible that Ying Zheng linger in the human world. Because this man exercises no benevolent virtue, yet his terror shakes the universe, so long as he reigns, the righteous armies suffer delay one day more. Is it not better to take advantage of the time and end him, how much more convenient would it be? Such matters concern the life and death, the peace and peril, of the entire nation, and the heavenly secrets cannot be revealed beforehand. This is why you repeatedly asked and yet received no answer," he said. All listened with astonishment and sighs.

As they spoke, suddenly there was a great roar in midair; the trees in the mountains rustled, and the birds on the branches cried out in alarm and scattered in flight. Master Iron Crutch smiled at Zhang Guo and said, "Your master has sent an old friend to deliver a letter to you; you may go and see." Zhang Guo, not understanding the cause, stepped out to look, and saw at the cave mouth a large maple tree, its branch broken, with a letter hanging askew upon it. Zhang Guo hastened forward, took it down and looked. It was indeed an edict sent by the Perfected Wenmei.

Zhang Guo bowed his head, holding the letter in his hands as he returned into the cave to present it to Master Iron Crutch, asking with a smile, "Is this not the sword light used to send letters?" Master Iron Crutch handed back the letter and bade him open it himself, replying, "Sword light can send letters over tens of thousands of li in no time. If one could borrow the power of lightning, even to the utmost east or west, one could transmit words and have them appear on the opposite side in an instant after writing. Compared with sending letters by sword light, this is much more convenient."

All present were greatly amazed. Zhang Guo read the letter. It appeared that Perfected Wenmei, seeing Zhang Guo's cultivation was too shallow, ordered him to go to Mount Wudang to cultivate in secret. Passing through the Mangdang Mountains, a man drunk on the road was blocked by a great white serpent. This man was the True Mandate Heaven Emperor. The white serpent was the spirit of the dead Qin Shi Huang, whose grudges persisted, knowing this man would succeed him, and thus possessed the serpent's body to seek his life in the narrow pass. "You must conceal yourself in the mountains; when two great lights appear at the mountain foot, that is when the white serpent emerges; swiftly aid the true master to slay it." This was a great merit not to be neglected, and so on. Master Iron Crutch immediately ordered Zhang Guo to set out at once. Afterwards, he also commanded Yang Ren to return to Mount Tai. Then smiling at Zhongli Quan, he said, "I intend to travel the world with Sister He, and by the way go to convert the reembodiments of Fan Qiliang and his wife. Ah Quan, you should receive my mysterious scripture, and there study well with Fei Fei and Dian Dian. In twenty years, your master will surely come to test your progress. Should there be no improvement, not only will your master abandon you as worthless, but I also dare no longer instruct you."

Zhongli Quan bowed again and promised compliance. Master Iron Crutch gave him three volumes of the mysterious scripture, commanding him to guard them well, under penalty of thunderbolts should they be lost. Zhongli Quan bowed and received them. Fei Fei, Dian Dian, and Fei Changfang stood aside, seeing Master Iron Crutch entrust the scripture solely to Zhongli Quan, their faces showed some displeasure. Master Iron Crutch laughed heartily, then ordered Zhongli Quan to place the scripture upon the central stone table. He bade the four bow thrice together, and then casually opened a page, commanding Fei Changfang to read it first. To their surprise, the page was blank, and upon turning several more, all were alike. Fei Changfang, Fei Fei, and Dian Dian all examined the pages, finding only blank sheets. Master Iron Crutch asked what they saw. The three had to answer truthfully. Then he commanded Zhongli Quan to read, and he found the characters clear and distinct, and recited aloud.

Master Iron Crutch sighed, and said, "The fate of immortality is fixed, and accomplishment varies accordingly. I have no partiality; it is merely that your affinities with the Dharma differ. Otherwise, why is it that Ah Quan sees clearly this mysterious scripture, while the three of you see not a single character?" The three could say nothing in reply, but a certain grievance was visible on their faces.

Master Iron Crutch then said, "Though you lack the affinity and dharma of Ah Quan, it does not mean you are wholly unfit to study. Yet of the highest and deepest kinds, unless you undergo bitter toil and meditation to truly reverse destiny, do not think you can comprehend them. Moreover, when that time comes, it will still require mutual instruction between me and Ah Quan. To read this scripture straightaway is utterly impossible. This is the so-called fate preordained, things having their masters, and not to be forced in the least. When I first read this scripture, you all saw with your own eyes that I read ten lines at a glance, with great ease. Now, when Ah Quan applies himself, though he may not surpass me in speed, he is certainly not inferior. After he finishes reading, the parts he can teach others, besides those I have already given you, number some dozens, which we can handle without difficulty. For you, who toil day and night, it will take at least twenty or thirty years to make some headway. Even ordinary men, after thirty years of effort, cannot grasp the most superficial mysteries. Compared to you, it is not the same matter. When I cultivated, I was seized by demons and later took you two to recover the scripture. You should remember this. In truth, what use is the scripture to him? It is but a blank sheet. Yet at that time, I did not know this principle, and feared the secret methods contained within might be stolen by demons. Even if the scripture could be recovered, the harm done was already grave, hence my urgency. Looking back, it seems laughable. Now in these mountains, all the demons and ghosts have been mostly driven away by me, or slain by Fei Fei and others, and the place is nearly cleared. Yet you must not be overconfident. Better be cautious, since this scripture is a secret treasure of Heaven and Earth, the supreme treasure of the Eight Scenery Palace. When I finished it, I presented it to the Patriarch, who decided that Zhongli Quan might inherit it. Hence it was still entrusted to me for safekeeping, saying: 'Should a great immortal affinity and profound wisdom arise, one able to read this scripture, it may be transmitted to him.' Now that it has come to Zhongli Quan, though he is not my disciple, he is of the same school and by relation is even above master and disciple. He can truly read it, showing he is indeed the one spoken of by the Patriarch. I transmit this scripture to him, partly to obey the Patriarch's command, partly to cultivate his immortal talent, and partly to relieve my burden. Three gains for three benefits; there is nothing more fitting. For Ah Quan, the obtaining of this extraordinary book is a rare destiny and great blessing. Yet he must bear this heavy burden and not neglect it. Furthermore, this scripture must be completely read within three to five years. Then, after decades of practice and the addition of cultivation and virtue, rapid progress will be made, and within a thousand years he will be qualified as a Great Lord of Heaven. As for his abilities, even among heavenly immortals he will be rare indeed."

Hearing this, Zhongli Quan was exceedingly joyful, and bowed to the empty air in thanks to the Patriarch.

Fei Fei, Dian Dian, and Changfang also bowed, for both Master Iron Crutch and Zhongli Quan consented to transmit to them in turn what could be taught from the scripture. Such ceremony was proper by reason. Only Fei Changfang, having finished his obeisance, saw Master Iron Crutch smile at him. Changfang, puzzled, asked, "Master, why do you smile upon your disciple? Has your disciple committed any impropriety or unseemly act?" Master Iron Crutch laughed, saying, "Though you are my disciple, your foundation is indeed shallow. Your immortal affinity is even less than that of Fei Fei and others. I think you have been away from home long enough, and it is time for you to return to see your family."

Changfang was greatly alarmed, saying, "Why does Master suddenly say this today? If I had no immortal affinity, how could I have met you? If my resolve in the Way were not firm, you would not have taken me by your side. In this time, I think I have done no wrong. Why then does Master now wish to send me back?"

Master Iron Crutch laughed, saying, "Ordering you to return is not necessarily casting you out. Your rank as junior brother is fixed; if you cannot cultivate immortality, that rank cannot be abandoned. My meaning is only that your future accomplishment will be thin at best; you may only reach the rank of Earth Immortal, and for that you must toil ten times harder to attain your wish. When you took the tonsure, your entire family was deeply grieved and anxious. It is only proper that you return to comfort them."

Hearing this, Changfang could not help tears and said, "So Master is but teasing, and has made me rejoice in vain. When I took the tonsure, by your power, my family already suspected me dead abroad. Though I have been only a few days in the mountains, my family may have aged, or the young grown up, and things changed beyond recognition. Even if I go back, it would be meaningless. In any case, I beg Master to continue to aid me, to keep me by your side. If blessed, to become an Earth Immortal would be my willing wish, with no other words to burden you."

Master Iron Crutch smiled and nodded.

That night, the three disciples took leave of Fei Fei and the others, departing from Mount Hua, still taking the route by Xianyang, preparing to go south to seek the couple Lan Caihe and wife. Meanwhile, the capital had been invaded by Xiang Yu's forces, burned, and ravaged, many residential quarters reduced to rubble. The First Emperor Qin Shi Huang, having expended great effort and the people's blood for his palaces, corridors, and gardens, saw much of it turned to scorched earth.

Master Iron Crutch and company wandered leisurely, lamenting and sighing, conversing idly about past matters. Only Changfang was silent, pondering upon his own dwelling, uncertain whether it had been burned. His entire family, he knew not where they had gone. His heart was heavy with sorrow, and tears fell unchecked. Fearing Master Iron Crutch might notice, he tried to conceal his feelings. Seeing no sign of attention from the Master, who chatted with Immortal Woman He, his heart was somewhat eased. Suddenly Master Iron Crutch raised his hand and pointed, saying, "Changfang, is that not the former Qingxu Temple? Can it be that the dwelling has suffered no damage? Perhaps Yang Ren contrived to preserve it; who can say? Since we have arrived, let us enter and see. If it is habitable, we may take temporary residence there."

Immortal Woman He and Changfang both agreed.

The three entered the temple and found the buildings still intact, but no one was present. Even the utensils and implements were all gone, their whereabouts unknown. Master Iron Crutch sighed and said, "The mulberry fields have become the sea, and the sea has become mulberry fields; changes are many. This place was once a bustling and prosperous site. How soon has it become so desolate! Reflecting that life in the world, the flesh and bones of man, is a thousand times more perishable than wood, stone, water, or field. The more one clings to fame and profit, the sooner one dies. Truly a fearful and lamentable thought!"

Glancing briefly at Changfang, he smiled. Changfang said, "Master, do you suspect your disciple still harbours desires for fame and profit?" Master Iron Crutch laughed, saying, "It is not for you alone that I speak thus. Knowing this, good. Furthermore, your home is near; having come so far, it is proper to go and see. The cultivation of the Way is not apart from human affection; the immortal Way also values affection. Though attachment to worldly matters is to be avoided, if one is indifferent and unmoved toward one's nearest and dearest, as if having no concern, that is not the way of the practitioner."

Changfang replied, "Since I have followed Master to many places, I have come to see worldly matters as increasingly thin and remote. Yet even between family and sons, I have not attained full release. I blame my shallow learning and poor understanding, my foolish attachment to family, which opposes the heart of the Way. Therefore, storing these thoughts in the five viscera, I do not dare present them before you; sometimes recalling them, I use forceful means to cast them away. Now, hearing your clear teaching, I know that all things within the bounds of human feeling are like ordinary men, and need not be forced or feigned, lest one lose his true nature. Master, is this so?"

Master Iron Crutch shook his head, saying, "This is somewhat plausible yet fallacious. Not forsaking flesh and bone, not abandoning human relations, is the way of being human. Why did the Patriarch of old take his house and ascend? Why, after my own attainment, did I also by the Patriarchâ€™s command save my parents? All this is because of the word 'affection.' The word 'affection' cannot be broken by mortals, nor by immortals. But the affection of immortals must first be formed from a state of no affection, so as to be able to use affection. Because they first have no affection, they can manifest true affection later. If one were like mortals, clinging day and night, husband and wife, father and son ever near, how could there be time or energy for cultivation? You said that since leaving home, you often think of your family; such thoughts are a longing to be ever with kin, inseparable. But by strong will you prevent being lost in it; this stage is necessarily passed by beginners. To say that cultivators can be thus without betraying the Way, or that without this they are not fit for the Way, is a great error. In sum, when cultivation is complete and the heart in the Way is pure and single, external demons and heretics cannot harm. Then you may do as you will. Coming and going, entering and retreating, all according to your wish and measure. The Confucians say 'Follow your heart's desire without transgressing the rules,' and this can be understood. Now at your present stage, though your heart in the Way is firm, the body of the Way is not stable, and the power of the Way very weak. You think you have great assurance, but cannot withstand the enticements and temptations of demons. Once caught, all your efforts are lost. You should be ever watchful, and always mindful, expanding your so-called forceful effort. As for all affairs and all thoughts, return them to the One and the Pure. No need to attend or consider, and there will be no thoughts at all. Only then can one comprehend the Great Way; this is the first step of the path. Now, at your stage, you are at a point where you may advance or retreat, enter or exit. Though you cannot wholly abandon mundane thoughts, nor cut off worldly cares, you must by no means keep such thoughts always like ordinary men. Better to move from forceful effort to naturalness, so that you reach a state of unmoved heart; even if thoughts arise, regard them as passing clouds, not bound by them. Thus, gradually you attain the One and the Pure. I send you home to see, not that you must not abandon worldly cares or lessen mundane thoughts, but to order you to focus your heart and not be led astray. By my stillness responding to others' movement, by my emptiness confronting others' substance, keep this mind and not forget human relations. This is the Way of perfect harmony. What you say is somewhat similar but different; the difference is minute, but you must understand it clearly."

Changfang accepted this teaching with both shame and gratitude, feeling his mind grow much clearer. That night, bidding farewell to Master Iron Crutch, he went to seek his family. Upon leaving the temple, he inquired and learned that his village was not ravaged by war, which comforted him greatly. He hastened his pace. At the village entrance, he suddenly saw a woman being dragged and pulled by several ruffians, uttering many foul words. The woman cried out for help, saying, "My family has broken the law and must take it to the officials. You have no right to abuse me so." Hearing the voice, Changfang felt it like that of his wife. Looking closely, it was indeed Bai Shi, his wife. Just then one ruffian twisted her face and laughed, saying, "Your husband fled long ago, and your family committed a great crime. If you are capable, come with us; we guarantee you food and clothing, and you will suffer no wrong for life." Bai Shi cursed loudly. The ruffians grew angry and said, "Let us drag her away and enjoy ourselves tonight; tomorrow we will deliver her to the officials." With a raucous shout, they seized Bai Shi and fled like the wind. Seeing this scene, Changfang's three corpses [the Three Corpses demon] leapt, smoke issued from his seven orifices; without thought he sprang forth in pursuit.

Whether he could overtake them or not, we shall see in the next chapter.
