# Chapter 61: Li Tieguai Visits Xuan Zhuzi; Wang Yueying Tests and Inspects Lan Caihe

Now it happened that He Xiangu and Wang Yueying followed Master Tieguai, riding upon clouds, and proceeded to the Lan family. On the midway, master and disciples discoursed once more upon the disposition of the Lan descendants and the punishment to be meted out to the Hu family. Tieguai then said, "This is but a small matter. For Caihe's sake, and out of respect for Yueying, I could not omit this journey. Besides, there is yet a greater affair." He Xiangu hastily asked what other matter there was.

Tieguai was about to reply, when suddenly there appeared on the northeastern corner a mass of black clouds, flying southward. He sighed, saying, "Wicked indeed is this thing. Who knows how many living creatures it will harm?" Thereupon he told the two, "Just now I spoke of another great matter; it is this. Can you discern what stands upon that black cloud?"

The lady immortal, having attained profound cultivation, had already seen that it was a great flood-dragon, vast beyond measure, its golden scales flashing, a monstrous and vigorous dragon; so she told Master Tieguai. But Yueying saw nothing, only a black mass. Tieguai sighed again: "As for this creature's age, among the present heavenly immortals on high, few can surpass it. As for cultivation, it can evade heaven, and can change its form. Among common immortals, how many can equal it? Yet why it delights to sink into demonic ways, doing harm to heaven and men, I know not. Though it may escape heavenly punishment a while, when its destined time comes, it cannot escape thunderbolts. Why bring such misery upon itself?"

He shook his head repeatedly, saying only, "What a pity! What a pity!" Yueying inquired of the creature's birth and its evil deeds, and Tieguai smiled and said to He Xiangu, "That is the wicked beast which made havoc in the Snail Hermitage. Time and again it sought to seize the Qianjiang River, making it its stronghold. Fortunately Xuan Zhuzi guards it well, and its designs were frustrated. But fate is fixed; in time it will cause mischief. I now go to take to Xuan Zhuzi a certain object, which can save a million living souls. If all else fails, it can be used for emergency." Hearing this, the lady immortal greatly admired it. At once Tieguai related to Yueying the history of the old flood-dragon. Yueying was amazed and said, "We are resolved to seek immortality, a rare attainment of the Great Way. Since this old flood-dragon has such profound cultivation, yet acts so arrogantly, is it not courting its own destruction? Is it not wasting ten thousand years of cultivation?"

Tieguai and He Xiangu sighed in mutual sympathy thereupon. Presently they arrived at the Lan household. Tieguai, He Xiangu, and Yueying descended from the sky together, so that the Hu family, young and old, were terrified and prostrated themselves on the ground, not daring to raise their heads. Only Yueying did not accept their excessive reverence, but quickly rose aside to avoid it. Seeing Yueying come with immortals, the Hu family knew she had become immortal and dared no longer cherish disrespect. Fearing that she had come to revenge past injuries, they trembled, and their mouths stammered forth: "M-M-Miss Wang… young… young… young mistress," as if spitting out a string of arrows of words, all in such affectionate address. As they sought to recount the past, to find excuse and explanation, Tieguai shouted sternly, frightening her so that her soul fled, almost fainting.

Yueying hastened to support her, and secretly instructed her, saying, "Fear not; my master is a Daoist immortal. He comes only to save you, to spare you dreadful suffering and the cycle of rebirth. You must calmly learn his teaching, reform yourself, and I promise you future good fortune." The Hu woman, hearing this, trembled and said, "The young lady’s kindness I fully understand. I was blinded by greed and failed to recognise the good. For past wrongs to you, I beg you not to hold them in your heart…" Hearing this, Yueying felt uneasy, but smiled and said, "Hear now the immortal master's instruction. See what he holds."

The Hu woman, hearing this, involuntarily glanced at Tieguai, and as she looked, terrified more and more. At last she cried out and fell down dead, foaming at the mouth and senseless.

The mirror that Tieguai held was but small. Its surface was only as large as a bowl, yet to the Hu woman it seemed as vast as heaven. Gazing into the mirror, the sky and sunlight disappeared. The scene within was like another heaven and earth. First one saw a house, within which lay a sick man. There were also a man and a woman, quietly plotting to poison the sick man. The sick man swallowed their poison, leapt a few times, and blood gushed from his seven orifices. The scene was most pitiful and terrible. The house was clearly the Lan family residence. The sick man was Lan Wen himself. The poisoners were none other than the Hu woman and her brother Hu Qian. Lan Wen’s death was dreadful, but only the siblings beheld the scene; Hu Qian cleaned up all traces so none saw the flaw. Yet the mirror there faithfully preserved a picture of the murder, exact in every detail and truth. How could the Hu woman fail to be terrified unto death?

Seeing the Hu woman faint, Tieguai smiled faintly, blew upon her gently, and she revived, understanding in her heart and unwilling to look again upon the mirror. But what she saw was all contained therein; even her own body—whether inside or outside the mirror—was dim and vague, hard to distinguish. She saw how, after Lan Wen’s death, she seized power; how Hu Qian slandered; how they plotted against Caihe and his wife; how Lan Xiu discovered this and secretly communicated with Yueying at night; how Hu Qian slandered Yueying; how the family was thrown into uproar; how the young couple fled; how Hu Qian led troops in pursuit; how Caihe and Yueying met immortals and ascended to heaven; how Hu Qian was slain; and then the mirror became empty and void.

To the Hu woman, the mirror again appeared but bowl-sized. Bewildered and dazed, her spirit wandered; she knew not what to do, but stared at Tieguai. Tieguai then commanded Yueying, "Take her inside and ask her if she will repent and turn to good, behave well, and commit no further evil. If she can widely perform secret merits and many good deeds, heaven will not cut off her path to renewal. When her merit is full, there will be unexpected benefits."

Yueying obeyed, leading the Hu woman within, and according to her master's wishes, earnestly admonished her. The Hu woman’s heart was greatly enlightened. Suddenly she stood and ran outside, kneeling before Tieguai, bowing her head like a pounding mortar, weeping as she confessed, "I deeply repent my past errors, and resolve to do good. If I speak falsely, or change my course midway…" She bit off more than half of her little finger with a sharp sound, blood gushing like a torrent, struggling in pain, she continued, "…this body shall not die a good death, but be cut in two like this finger."

Having said this, she fainted with pain. Tieguai rejoiced at her determination, judging it sincere, nodding in approval: "If you can be thus, though the crime be heavy, it is yet not beyond remedy." Then he blew upon her again, and she arose, the bleeding and pain ceased. Tieguai comforted her personally. The Hu woman kept the bitten-off finger, saying, "I will look at this every day, lest matters pass and feelings change, and I repeat my old ways."

This lively scene was fully understood only by those immediately involved. The servants of the Lan mansion and the Hu family’s children and others saw nothing of the matter, nor any of the illusions in the mirror. When they saw the Hu woman’s severed finger and clear mind, the multitude felt both wonder and fear, surprise and apprehension.

According to Tieguai, the mirror’s power was the same as that of his gourd, both being receptacles of one’s own spirit. When the Way is profound, the soul may roam beyond heaven and earth; matters of thousands of years past or future may be fully revealed by a single glance, without the slightest error. This method was later transmitted by Yang Ren, but his Tao power was insufficient; he could only write talismans and recite spells as substitutes for soul travel, and the manifestations were slight and obscure. It was used to investigate cases and detect thieves with much effect, and has been handed down for thousands of years, now called Yuan Guang (Perfect Light). Some in the world use it to extort money, losing the original purpose and diminishing its power. The notion of Yuan Guang is being disparaged by the upper classes, but the real reason for its failure is the impostors who cheat the world; there is no fault in Yuan Guang itself. We must not attribute the disorder wrought by these to the method itself, lest we become like the fool who throws away food for fear of choking. In recent decades, Western philosophers have, inspired by Tieguai, created hypnosis, which requires no talisman or mirror, yet can determine past and future, near and far, true or false; but the procedure is complex. Some persons of special nature cannot be subjected to it; some with insufficient spirit cannot cultivate it deeply. It is a recent invention, and scoundrels misuse hypnosis to fool people. Many victims wrongly say hypnosis and Yuan Guang are alike, without reason. Yet true hypnotists find this art hard to master. Such philosophers are rare in the world. Others only copy the surface, and are unworthy of being called scholars. In sum, this art originated with Tieguai. Yang Ren transmitted it; Western philosophers studied its principles. Its essence is none other than the soul’s power, what Tieguai calls the spirit’s habitation. With his Tao power and divine ability, he can know events thousands of miles away; with a count of fingers he can know events centuries hence. He needs neither implements nor procedure. Only thus can one become a true immortal, possessing the genuine immortal’s power. This is truly beyond the reach of Western philosophers and Yang Ren.

Leaving such digression, we return to Tieguai’s completion of affairs at the Lan residence. He then took He Xiangu and Yueying, again mounting cloud-tops, and went straight to the region of Haining, proceeding directly to the temple of Xuan Zhuzi. Since taking office, Xuan Zhuzi had shown many manifestations of spirit, so the incense and offerings flourished beyond compare. Hearing of Tieguai’s arrival, he hastened forth to greet him. The two immortals met with great joy and laughter, and entered the temple hand in hand. Tieguai ordered the lady immortals to present their respects and express their admiration. Xuan Zhuzi asked about Tieguai’s wanderings; Tieguai inquired after the dragon’s guarding of the land, and told him what he had seen of the old flood-dragon coming south. Xuan Zhuzi sighed, "If this beast is not removed, the difficulties in Zhe shall not cease. Though I cooperate with the Dragon King and strive in many ways to cut off its access, alas, this demon’s magic is not inferior to ours. I fear one oversight may fall into its schemes. Then the responsibility for a million living creatures will rest on me alone. I am but shallow in skill; to bear such weight, whenever I think of it, I tremble in apprehension. Since you do not abandon me, and kindly come, surely you have something to teach me." Tieguai smiled, "Brother, you are too modest. Though the old flood-dragon is fierce, evil never conquers good. Moreover, with your careful watch at the sea mouth, and the help of Master Ping and his wife, I think the old dragon cannot prevail. Even if there be accidents, they are matters of fate and cannot be escaped. If you but keep steadfast and unswerving, never forget your usual vigilance for a passing whim, then though fate come, it will not concern you." Xuan Zhuzi assented repeatedly, but inwardly felt that Tieguai’s words were not very practical, seeming rather a polite excuse. He showed some doubt outwardly. Tieguai perceived his intent, but feigned ignorance. That night Xuan Zhuzi prepared fresh fruits of the south, famous products of Yuezhong, and feasted the three distant guests. Host and guests discoursed with joy and abandon.

Next day Tieguai led He Xiangu and Yueying away from Haining northward to Zhongzhou. Tieguai smiled and said to Yueying, "I will teach you a little trick." Yueying did not understand. He Xiangu smiled, "Brother surely has a purpose. You, virtuous sister, should study diligently and not ask much." Tieguai chanted an incantation, bade Yueying repeat it, and wrote two words on her palms, “hidden” and “manifest,” saying, "With this spell you may change the appearance of one whose heart you wish to alter. But it is not the true Way and cannot endure; it will have effect for but a day or two. The two words on your palms are talismans for hiding and manifesting the body. To hide, raise the left hand upward, and men will not see where you are. To appear, cover downward with the right hand, and the body will instantly show. This is a playful art; do not regard it as proper immortal magic. True transformation and invisibility require real skill and infinite change, with no talismans. But you are newly begun on the path, not yet ready for such skill; and this art is not orthodox Taoism. When the Great Way is accomplished, you will no longer need to toil, but naturally understand. To begin with the superficial arts is to forsake the root and pursue the branches; it divides the mind for the Way and harms the cultivation of the heart, and must not be done. What I teach you now is not true magic, but should be taken as a pastime, not to be dwelt upon, lest it summon outer demons. Do you understand why I teach you this?"

Yueying was puzzled: "This disciple is confused. You say one must not seek arts before the Way, lest the mind for the Way be divided; yet today you first teach me a talisman art lower than the arts, and repeatedly warn to take it only as play. I feel my root is not firm, my skill none; is this the time to learn a pastime? Should I not fear dividing my mind for the Way? I am ignorant and beg master’s clear instruction." Tieguai was pleased at her understanding and discipline, praised her, then said, "This is all for Caihe’s affairs, and also for your sake. I have strong confidence in you; but as to Caihe, I cannot yet be sure of his resolve. I intend to use this occasion to test him several times, not solely to try his sincerity. If he truly has destiny, my test will strengthen his resolve to cultivate the Way. If he can ascend to heaven sooner, you may be born sooner. So it is for him and you. Your and Caihe’s desires are like those of me and your sister He Xiangu. While she does not become immortal, I shall not ascend. She is diligent beyond measure, rising early and resting late; in the study of life she is already seven or eight parts accomplished, and soon will attain fruition. Though I have waited for her hundreds of years, she has not disappointed me. I hope Caihe will have such earnestness toward you—as you work hard, you may save yourself worry, and I shall have great comfort."

Yueying was still not fully clear. Tieguai smiled and sighed, "This girl is so clever, yet cannot understand this small matter; is she not for a moment confused?" He Xiangu said, "Virtuous sister, do not think foolishly; I understand Brother’s meaning and will tell you." Upon these words Yueying suddenly awoke to it and laughed, "Truly I am too foolish. Master’s meaning is that I should use transformation to test Caihe—is it not so?" The two immortals laughed heartily, "You only now understand?" Tieguai then instructed her carefully, "Do as I say, so as not to err, and get at Caihe’s true feelings." Yueying obeyed. Tieguai looked down and suddenly pointed to a village below, saying, "This is already the borders of Yuzhou, south of the Yellow River. I reckon Caihe will come here tonight to lodge; he is still on the way. Your sister He Xiangu and I will go ahead thus, to frighten him somewhat and test his courage. When he comes to the village, you follow my plan closely without error."

Thus they alighted at a local earth temple, frightening the earth spirit who hurried forth to entertain the immortal guests. Tieguai comforted him and explained their purpose, bidding him care for Yueying, who was young and inexperienced, lest there be mishaps. Yueying waited in the temple for Caihe. Tieguai and He Xiangu went out again, and by the method of quick earth travel, hastened to a hill some ten li away. Tieguai pointed to a grove opposite, saying, "There in the wood, walking to and fro, is Caihe. The wilderness is empty; he looks about anxiously, surely to find some one to ask the way. Virtuous sister, you should quickly go and entice him hither."

He Xiangu smiled, turned, and changed into an old white-haired woman, approaching Caihe.

Meanwhile Caihe, lost on the road as evening fell, wished to find someone to ask the way. Suddenly he saw the old woman approaching, and was greatly relieved, stepping forward to salute her, and said, "I am a poor Daoist, bound for Mount Wangwu. Pressing to hasten, I missed my meal. Pray, good lady, instruct me which is the great road, and where is lodging?"

He Xiangu replied, pointing back, "You go that way, round this hill, and travel five or six li more, when you will find a village where you may lodge." Caihe thanked her and set off. The sun was near setting, the twilight yellow and waning. The more anxious Caihe grew, the faster he walked. Yet the hill was in sight, but he could not reach it.

He laughed and chafed, saying to himself, "An impatient man is always so. The distance is fixed; how can it suddenly be near or far? It must be my anxiety that makes it seem to go slower." Though he said so, the road was indeed strange, clearly not far, yet it took him a full half-hour to walk. The fading light could not be less than a quarter or half an hour; so after his extra half-hour, it was quite dusk.

Arriving at the hill’s foot, he was somewhat weary, and anxiously said, "The old woman said that beyond the hill another six or seven li lies the village. Now darkness is complete; the road hard to discern; and I am very tired. How can I manage so far? Besides, though the hill is not very high, the peaks overlap, and I fear tigers, wolves, or robbers may lurk there. If I meet such things, unarmed, I cannot resist; and so tired, I could hardly escape. What am I to do?"

After some thought, he judged that lingering was no solution, and must summon courage to go on. Just as he turned to go around the hill, suddenly the trees rustled in the wind; a fierce gale shook him to the bones. Glancing up the hill, he saw between the trees two great red lanterns flashing light. Doubt filled his heart: "No one lives in the mountain; how can there be such great lanterns? Besides, I did not see them before; who hung them, and what use are they here?" Thinking thus, he looked again and again, and when he saw clearly, he cried out in terror and fell to the ground.

Why Caihe feared these red lanterns so, we will relate in the next chapter.
