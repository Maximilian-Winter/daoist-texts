# Chapter 63: At the Earth God’s Temple, Discoursing on Profound Principles — The Gentle Abode Entices the Daoist Boy

It is related that Cai He, amidst extreme hardship and peril, was succoured by an immortal, who caused a great python to convey him to the Earth God’s temple. At that time, the dawn was breaking; Cai He felt both weary and famished, utterly spent. He hastened to knock at the mountain gate of the Earth God’s temple. But who should open to welcome him but a maiden of peerless beauty, whose charm was natural and abundant. Cai He, taken by surprise, was momentarily dazed, but soon lifted his hands in salute, and inquired if the maiden was a permanent resident of the temple. He said, “I am but a poor Taoist, hastening on my journey, when by chance an unexpected mishap befell me; fortunately the immortal above protected me, and I escaped danger to arrive here. I desire to rest a while in this noble place, and am prepared to offer incense as tribute. Might the maiden grant me leave?” The maiden, seeing his dishevelled state, seemed to pity him, and smilingly said, “A recluse makes his home anywhere; much less a temple. How can it be that you are not allowed to lodge here? Although the abbot is not present, I am related to him by worldly ties; I may well decide in his stead. Taoist Brother need not be formal; pray enter within and I will offer tea.” Cai He was comforted, gave thanks, and followed the lady inside.

Within was a small guest hall, where the maiden bade him sit, and called to a Taoist nun to brew fine tea. She further said, “Taoist Brother has come from afar, doubtless you are very hungry. This place is secluded, and I have no delicacies to offer; only some noodles made by my own hands at home. Perhaps you might partake?” Cai He’s stomach thundered, and he was ashamed to speak; but upon hearing this, his heart blossomed, and he hastily rose to thank her. The maiden smiled and bade the nun swiftly bring two bowls of noodles. The nun obeyed, and soon appeared bearing two large bowls of steaming, fragrant vegetarian noodles. The worms within Cai He’s belly, smelling the fragrance, caused great uproar, no longer allowing him to be polite. He quickly took a bowl, said “Please,” and lifted his chopsticks to eat. The maiden, seeing how hungry he was, sighed and smiled, saying, “There are no outsiders here; Taoist Brother may eat heartily without restraint.” She seated herself at his lower side and ate with him, all the while asking about Cai He’s travels and affairs. Cai He answered each question in turn.

The maiden listened, somewhat amazed. When he had finished the noodles, she smiled and said, “Taoist Brother, pray excuse my bluntness. One of your birth and standing, in the spring of youth, why do you not think to read and advance, to become an official and commander, to enjoy the worldly splendours and prosperities, yet choose thus to withdraw from the world, encountering death and hardship? Are there indeed immortals in the world? Can one really cultivate to immortality at will?”

Before she finished, Cai He smiled and said, “Madam, though you dwell in the temple, you have little faith in the Way; thus you speak as one unskilled. It is said that immortals were once mortals; how can one strive for the Way and yet fail to become immortal? As to the existence or not of immortals, others may doubt, but I am certain beyond doubt. This is not mere argument; I have seen miraculous deeds of immortals more than once. Not to speak of others, my own master is a true immortal from the upper realms; and the one who last night rebuked the great python in the air and saved me was surely also an immortal. Without this, how could such power be wielded to compel so fierce and dull a beast to submit?”

At this he recounted to the maiden the many strange events that had befallen him. Finally he earnestly said, “I confess to you, in my youth I was deeply ensnared in worldly feeling, utterly without the Dao in my heart. I once dreamed of official station and wealth, to enjoy the splendour and fortune of this world for decades. But after several misfortunes, I came to see that however grand and glorious life may be, it is like passing smoke and clouds—gone in a moment, leaving nothing behind. At the same time, guided by my immortal master and counseled by fellow Daoists, I came to know that immortals truly exist, and that they are all mortals who have cultivated to immortality. Knowing this, I was enlightened; the fleeting splendour is no match for eternal blessing. To sacrifice everlasting happiness for brief honour and profit is folly. Therefore I resolved to abandon all, to obey my master’s command, to endure a lifetime of hardship in pursuit of the great Dao. Should I perish in strange lands or be devoured by beasts, it is but death. Death is death—whether rich or poor, noble or humble, it makes no difference. To put it otherwise, whether one dies in old age or as an infant, it is the same. From the viewpoint of immortals who live with Heaven for myriads of kalpas, living a hundred years or dying in the cradle is no different, no more distinction of length. Since seeing through this truth, I no longer regard worldly hopes of wealth and glory as anything but fleeting clouds; nor do I care for the length of life or the manner of death. Simply, I single-mindedly pursue the path of the great Dao. Whether I succeed or fail is predetermined by fate, beyond human control; why worry about it? Thus, when you ask if immortals exist and whether mortals can become immortals, I not only firmly affirm immortals do exist, but that they are mortals who have cultivated. More practically, even if immortals do not exist, and it is uncertain if mortals can cultivate to immortality, my heart is utterly indifferent—I do not even think on the matter. Nor am I alone in this: in my humble opinion, all who cultivate immortality must have such firm will and great perseverance to have the hope of success. If one becomes a recluse today and tomorrow fancies immortality, expecting to fly on clouds, live forever, and be free of mortal bounds immediately, that is no different from worldly men hoping for promotion and wealth. Such men, I say, are doomed to failure; why suffer hardship in vain?”

The maiden, hearing this, suddenly raised her head and looked at Cai He, her face showing a pleasant and comforting expression, yet still faintly smiling. She said, “It seems to me that life is brief, and precisely because it is so brief, one should make haste to seek present joys, lest impermanence arrive and it be too late for delight. As for cultivating immortality, it is indeed absurd, fit only to deceive the ignorant; the somewhat wise cannot believe it. Taoist Brother disbelieves; yet have not sages and heroes throughout the ages, men of supreme wisdom, all desired long life and freedom beyond the world? Why then do we not hear of them pursuing immortality, but instead serving kings and states, performing duties of rulers and ministers, bringing peace and prosperity? Are they all fools, ignorant that mortals might become immortals?”

Cai He answered solemnly, “Madam, your words are mistaken. There are three teachings in the world: Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism. Confucianism is flourishing in the central lands; Buddhism is beginning to spread in the West; but Daoism, originating before creation, though less widespread, is longer in history. When you say sages and heroes do not cultivate immortality, your reasoning seems sound but you have not truly understood the origins and doctrines of the three teachings. Though their ways differ, their aim is one: to benefit the people and bless the state. As for us now entering the monastic life, the term for reaching the Dao is far off. To cultivate the great Dao, one must both practise oneself and widely accumulate merit and good connections. One must make the foundation of the heart firm, so as to advance step by step to the wondrous Way. The more merit and connections, the greater the accomplishment. In these methods and stages, what difference is there from Confucian or Buddhist practice? Each has its own cultivation and character, but the principle is one; their results bring joy. Madam, do not think that sages’ lives are like common men’s. The body is like a vessel; sage and common alike are vessels, and the sage’s vessel is not necessarily more durable; their lifespan is not especially longer. But the souls of sages are like immortals, enduring for thousands of years, unscathed through myriad kalpas. Like us Daoists, though some ascend with their bodies, most leave behind their flesh and raise only the spirit. You are a wise woman; do you understand that the three teachings stand together, distinct roads with a united destination? Confucians have their path and need not follow ours, as we have our own cultivation and need not imitate them.”

The maiden laughed heartily and said, “Now you come to it! Since there is a way beyond cultivation to immortality, why must one become a recluse?” Cai He, startled and suddenly enlightened, laughed, “Since cultivation leads to immortality, why change to Confucian or Buddhist paths? Moreover, the three teachings prize steadfastness and constancy. If, as you say, those who have entered monastic life might return home to worldly affairs, how can the Dao forbid it, or other teachings permit it?”

Cai He by now felt some impatience with the woman’s persistence. Yet she would not relent, ever entangling him. Cai He, amused and vexed, looked out to the bright sun and morning breeze filling the room. Though he had eaten food and regained some spirit, he had not felt fatigue depart. For the sake of leaving the woman, he hastened to say, “Madam, you have graciously allowed me to lodge here temporarily. After a night of toil, I am indeed overcome and beg for some convenience to rest briefly, so as not to delay my journey.”

The maiden seemed incredulous of his fatigue, and mocked smilingly, “My noodles are unlike the common sort; some who eat them gain great nourishment of qi and blood, and if one ate a bowl daily, it would dispel illness and prolong life. How then, Taoist Brother, having eaten such a large bowl, can you still speak of weariness and hardship? Not lacking blessing to enjoy, you must have a body too weak, wasting such great nourishment within you. It seems your hope of immortality is utterly hopeless. As for your own words about being devoured by beasts, perhaps there is some truth to that after all.”

With that she smiled sweetly and glanced at Cai He, saying, “I have given you good advice, yet you heed none, and boast your cleverness with vain argument. Such a presumptuous man I have not seen before.” She kept looking at Cai He; her brows knit in sorrow and complaint, her expression enchanting and tender. Except for one of iron heart, who would not be moved to pity? But Cai He was one in a thousand, a stern man, neither moved by her kindness nor accepting her passion. Seeing her concern as strange and frightening, he quickly lowered his head, and dared not even glance that way.

At this moment, the serving Taoist nun stood nearby, smiling, and said, “This Taoist Brother does not look like a poor recluse, but plainly like a nobleman’s son. Our lady is but eighteen, of rare beauty and virtue; even heavenly immortals might not surpass her. Our master, while living, was a great official in the state of Chu, of very high rank. Last night, he appeared in a dream to our lady, saying, ‘Tomorrow a young Taoist will come to lodge. This man is fated to be your match; keep him and wed.’ So our lady rose early to await him. Unexpectedly, when she arose, Taoist Brother was already at the door. This is a match from Heaven, without error. That is why our lady so urges you not to become a recluse. Young sir, consider: with such a person of virtue and talent as our lady, where else will you find her equal? Many noblemen and princes have sought her hand, but none pleased her. Today she favours you. Such fortune is rare. I think you should cast off your Taoist robes, don Confucian dress, and wed her here. Then if you wish to cultivate immortality, enjoy twenty or thirty years of wedded bliss, working together with one heart and mind. When the mortal heart is pure, you may ascend at any time. Moreover, cultivation with a spouse is more lively and prosperous than solitary wandering, crossing mountains and rivers, facing danger and hardship. Pray reconsider.”

Cai He heard her words growing ever more unreasonable and laughed aloud, “Enough, enough! So you and your servants do not truly wish to lodge a guest, but to follow your master’s dream, lure this recluse into your lady’s fragrant chamber to become devoted spouses. Though your lady’s kindness and your master’s care are great, I am not worthy of such honour. As I have said, I have already put my body and life beyond reckoning; even if a heavenly immortal came to arrange my marriage, I could not accept. Pray have your lady look with wisdom and seek a match of equal birth and talent. Pardon my stubbornness; I am unworthy of your kindness.”

Before he finished, the maiden burst into tears, bowing her head on the table and weeping bitterly. Cai He, seeing this, felt pity for her, but there was no remedy. With a heavy heart, he apologized repeatedly, eager to depart, and asked the nun to lead him to a guest chamber to rest. The nun, seeing his obstinacy, seemed annoyed, and said sternly, “Sir, do you doubt my words? Our late master gave your name and family in detail in his dream. If you do not believe me, I will relate it all to you. Tell me, is your surname not Lan, your given name Cai He? Are you not from a certain village? Did you not suffer wrongs from your stepmother, and have disputes with your wife? Did you not both leave home and attempt to drown yourselves?”

The nun related Cai He’s past affairs in such detail, as though she had seen them with her own eyes. Cai He stared in amazement, speechless. When she spoke of the couple’s attempted drowning, a thought struck him: “A dead spirit could hardly know my family’s affairs. Could this lady be some demon in disguise, sent to entice me? If so, death is my only recourse. But since she shows no change of face, and I am powerless, I shall not seek her out.” So he pleaded with the nun, “I have sworn a solemn oath before my master that if I fail to attain the Dao in this life, I accept whatever fate befalls me. I dare not accept your lady’s affection, though I will never forget your late master’s kindness, and if I make progress I will repay it. But now your words I cannot heed, nor am I willing to listen further. Pray speak no more.”

The nun smiled faintly, saying, “Strange indeed. Nowadays many young men suddenly wish to become recluses. Recently, a gentleman sought the great Dao, but before attaining it, met bandits and was stabbed; his life ended in an instant. That was but recently. Now again comes such a fool, abandoning a fine opportunity to go the way of ruin. Truly strange.”

The maiden said nothing, only bowed her head silently, tears trailing, seeming deeply sorrowful. When the nun finished, the maiden softly rebuked her, “He does not wish to accept me; why argue further? Lead him to rest; waste no words.” Then she sat alone quietly. Her eyes filled with tears, she suddenly looked at Cai He and then lowered her head again, her fair neck bent to her bosom, unable to raise it. Cai He clearly heard her choked sobs and saw her sorrowful yet lovely expression. He too was filled with deep pity. At this juncture, finding no comfort, he thanked her once more, rose hastily, and followed the nun. They came to a side chamber with a bed exquisitely clean, fragrant, and adorned. The nun smiled quietly, “See, this is our lady’s embroidered couch. So fastidious is she, yet she offers her bedding for your rest. If you were not of iron heart, how could you not be moved?”

Cai He heard this and turned to leave, saying, “I dare not disrespect the young lady. Pray find another room; a simple straw mat will suffice for my lodging. As a novice on the Way, I cannot bear to waste others’ possessions and thereby accrue sin.” Saying this, he reached the door. The nun laughed and pulled him back, “Where are you going? This is a deserted temple with few rooms. Apart from this newly prepared guest chamber, where else can you find a straw mat?” Cai He replied, “If so, I will rest in the hall. How can I make free in a lady’s chamber?”

The nun’s face grew awkward; with a cold laugh she said, “You make things difficult. We have prepared a bed, yet you spout great principles. As guest, you should not suffer hardship. A straw mat is too rough even for us; how could you be comfortable? And to sleep in the hall is out of the question. If the abbot knew, he would not allow it. I advise you to make do for one day’s comfort. Perhaps Heaven will not send a judge to record your name and condemn you to hell. If you take it easy, sparing us some trouble, it will count as merit. One who attains immortality in a hundred years, but dies at ninety-nine and a half, is advantaged by half a year’s time.”

With that she sneered and pushed him onto the fragrant soft embroidered couch. Cai He felt the nun’s strength was prodigious, as if a thousand pounds bore on him; yet she herself seemed to move as lightly as stirring a dry reed, revealing unknown power. Fearful and amazed, Cai He judged that quarrelling with her was futile. He resolved to plead gently; just as he was about to settle and speak, the nun would not let him utter a word, but lifted him again, laid him on the bed, covered him with the quilt, and smiling said, “Forgive me; I must leave.” She shook her head, laughing, “Indeed I am not worthy to accompany you. One who will keep you is coming soon. You must not look so sternly at others.” With that she smiled and departed.

The door shut with a click; then she barred it from outside. No matter how he called, no one answered. Cai He recalled the nun’s parting words—could this lady truly, disregarding shame, have come of her own accord to offer herself? If so, how should he respond? And if the nun, with her great strength, were to assist the lady to break his resolve, then death would be the only way.

Lost in wild thoughts, he suddenly awoke to reason: “A cultivator goes with the flow, treading dangers as if on level ground. If trifles weigh on the heart, how are we different from worldly men cherishing gain and loss? Let it be.” His spirit calmed, body at peace, he soon fell asleep. Suddenly, he heard a door open and a woman’s soft voice saying, “Has this young gentleman fallen asleep?” Cai He awoke, heart stirred.

Who the visitor might be, we shall see in the next chapter.
