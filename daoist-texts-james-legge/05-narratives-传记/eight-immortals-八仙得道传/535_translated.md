# Chapter 67: Zhang Mu Borrows a Soul; Demons Deceive the Sovereign; Rescuing the Disciple and Assisting the Dao; The Immortals Descend

It is said that Li Shaojun, following the method taught by Wang Yizhi for commanding ghosts, set up a secret chamber within the palace. Within the chamber he hung black curtains, and in the midst suspended a bright horn-shaped lamp. When all was arranged, he placed the soul of Yingying beside him, and then invited the Martial Emperor to come and meet. The Martial Emperor, hearing that the soul of Lady Li had been summoned, was filled with both sorrow and consolation, and followed Li Shaojun to the secret chamber.

Shaojun bade the Martial Emperor to sit beside the curtain without, whilst he himself, sword in hand, formed magical seals and began the rite. The Martial Emperor fixed his eyes unblinkingly upon the black curtain; at first all was void and empty, but soon a gust of chill wind arose, causing the bright horn-lamp to sway several times in the air, its flame flickering between darkness and light. Though bold of heart, the Martial Emperor could not but feel a rising chill. Shaojun quickly pointed the sword’s tip thrice at the lamp’s light; then the wind subsided and the lamp shone steadily. Yet even in its steadiness there was a dimness, a certain gloomy aspect. The Martial Emperor then perceived at a corner of the far wall, upon the edge of the black curtain, what seemed a woman’s shadow, cast as upon the curtain. The expression somewhat resembled Lady Li, but not with full resemblance. The Martial Emperor thought: This is her soul altered after death; no marvel in that. Looking again more closely, the shadow seemed to detach itself from the curtain, floating slowly downwards as if to approach him. But upon careful observation it appeared still upon the curtain, unmoved as before. The Martial Emperor’s heart was both anxious and pained.

He wished to call out, but feared that his yang virtue might disperse her yin soul, so he patiently waited. After a while the ghostly soul seemed to have perceived the Martial Emperor; an expression of anger immediately appeared on her face. The Martial Emperor was startled. He reflected that while his wife lived their affection was deep; now, after death, meeting again, she should manifest both joy and sorrow—how then could anger be present? While he pondered thus, the ghost suddenly turned her back upon him, facing the curtain, no longer visible. The Martial Emperor was overwhelmed with sorrow, and could not restrain himself from chanting these lines:

“Is it evil or not evil, coming and going?  
Why doth she come so tardily?”

When he had finished, he burst into loud lamentations, tears falling like rain. Suddenly there came a tremendous noise, like thunder. Shaojun hurriedly came and dragged the Martial Emperor away. The Emperor, confused, followed unwillingly. Yet his eyes could not bear to part, and he looked once more toward the curtain. To his surprise, the ghost appeared dishevelled, hair loose, tongue hanging three feet, blood flowing from the seven orifices—a suicide by hanging. The Martial Emperor cried out in terror and fell to the ground. Shaojun hastened to support him and led him back within the palace, his complexion still pale yellow. Dismissing the attendants, the Emperor inquired of Shaojun, “How is it that the lady has become a spectre of one who died by hanging?”

Shaojun hastened to explain: “This is because Your Majesty recited the lines of poetry which forced Lady Li’s wandering soul to withdraw. At my side was a hanging ghost, a matter entrusted by the ghost-master Wang Yizhi for inquiry. For those who die by strangulation, their grievances remain unsettled; even in the presence of yang virtue, they may appear. Since the lady has departed, this ghost took the opportunity to appear, seeking Your Majesty to act on her behalf.” The Martial Emperor, hearing this, quickly asked, “What hanging ghost is this? For what grievance did she die? Tell me in detail, that I may surely avenge her.” Shaojun replied, “This matter must ultimately be decided by Your Majesty, but the time is not yet ripe; to speak further is useless. Besides, the matter contains heavenly secrets, and to reveal them is a crime. I dare not speak presumptuously.” The Emperor, his heart burdened with thoughts of Lady Li, made no further inquiry, and after some questions left it at that. Shaojun then took back the soul of Yingying and delivered it to Wang Yizhi.

After Shaojun’s departure, Wang Yizhi’s disciple Fei Changfang happened to come and inquire about the matter. Changfang was greatly displeased, saying: “Master has been used by Shaojun. Whether in the heavens or the underworld, from the White Jade Emperor to Yama, most esteemed are the manly integrity and the loyalty of women. A chaste woman such as Yingying ought to be revered by the gods of heaven and honoured by the three teachings alike. As a ghost-master, Master should comply with the will of Heaven and the feelings of men, holding special regard and respect for such a ghost. How could you abuse your Daoist power, lending it to a base fellow to impersonate a woman’s soul? This not only profanes the chaste maiden, but risks harming your own character, displeasing the gods. I, your humble disciple, am truly concerned for you.” Wang Yizhi, at that time heavily intoxicated and confused, took Changfang’s words as slander and rebuked him sharply. Changfang, perceiving his master’s drunken muddle, did not argue but sighed silently and took his leave. The next day, Wang Yizhi had entirely forgotten that night’s events.

Changfang did not mention it again until the afternoon when Shaojun returned the ghost to him, and Yizhi then recalled Changfang’s remonstrations which lodged in his heart. Reflecting, he found Changfang’s words true in every respect. Yingying was a woman of great chastity and ardour; alive she would not change her fidelity, and dead, profaned by Daoist arts at their hands, how could she rest content? Such a chaste and resolute soul could roam freely through the Three Realms, untrammelled beyond the Four Seas. Though temporarily entrusted to him beneath the heavens, she would soon be summoned by the emperor of heaven, specially honoured. When then she remembered the insult, how could she not speak? What hope then for his own life and future? Deeply troubled, he shuddered in apprehension. Looking to Shaojun and then to Changfang, he suddenly sighed deeply and wept copiously, puzzling them both.

Wang Yizhi then bitterly addressed Changfang: “Brother, I now remember your words of yesterday; I blame myself for lack of self-discipline, and for a fiery temper. Though I have followed masters long in the Dao, I have failed through attachment to petty matters of pride, lacking patience, almost bringing disaster upon myself. By the grace of my master I escaped hell, and was appointed to this post. Yet I have been so futile that after a hundred years I have made no progress, but rather drunk and deceived myself, harmed a chaste soul beyond remedy. I imagine Heaven will investigate, and when the case is heard, I shall surely descend to hell. I recall my master’s earnest warnings, which seemed to imply that I was unworthy not only to cultivate the Dao, but even to be a leader of evil spirits. The implication was a concern for my fate. Now looking back over these hundred years, I have done no great evil. Yet in old age I have been deceived by scoundrels into this madness. The outcome promises to be dreadful. Could it be that the master’s prophecy is to be fulfilled now?

I have lived uprightly, doing good and showing benevolence, esteeming chivalry and righteousness, never stooping to base and mean conduct. I do not claim to be a gentleman, but am far from being a villain. I had not imagined that failing in the Dao I would lose even the modest rank of ghost-immortal, and now in old age bring about such calamity. My life is not worth mentioning, but what face shall I show my master in the beyond, and how can I face you, my worthy younger brother? Were you to have heeded my words and awakened at once, perhaps there had been remedy.

But this cursed habit of drunkenness overtook me, leaving me senseless as a beast or stone. I missed the last chance and have committed an irreparable error. Alas, alas, the matter having come to this, what else can I do but sit and await punishment? I do not blame my fate, but only myself, for lack of spirit and worth. At this age, unable to distinguish right from wrong, unable to discern the truth of one matter from another. This is truly misfortune; what more need be said?”

As he spoke he sighed again and laid his head upon the desk, weeping bitterly. Changfang, as his disciple and friend, was struck dumb with sorrow; he could only offer a few words of comfort and then fell silent. Meanwhile, the one who had borrowed the soul and deceived the sovereign, Li Shaojun, was by nature a bad man. Though aided by Wang Yizhi, accustomed to wicked deeds, he regarded the abuse of a female ghost as a matter as small as a mustard seed. Yet the words spoken by Wang Yizhi, mingled with suspicion and reproach, were intolerable to him. Disregarding Wang Yizhi’s sorrow and grief, he suddenly laughed coldly to the heavens and declared loudly: “I have not before seen such a worthless rogue, who yet boasts himself a gentleman—truly shameful beyond measure. Suppose I be a bad companion, a villain who means to harm you. You are a gentleman, a man of principle; why then did you so readily accept my proposal without hesitation? You, who manage such matters, should know the rules and dangers. I only wanted a common female soul; yet you brought this chaste soul as well. Since you, as leader of ghosts, have brought this ghost, how can I not believe that you cannot control her? All this you have done yourself; before disaster comes, you have already alienated an old friend. What then is this affair? Think on it for yourself; I am too weary to waste words with your confusion.” Saying this, he strode out.

When he was gone Wang Yizhi drew a deep breath, sighed heavily, and turned to Changfang: “Brother, did you behold this man? Such a one may truly be said to have lost all conscience. I blame myself for mistaking a villain for a gentleman. This is my own doing; what more need be said? But I must say one thing to you: I know the calamity is great. The last affair was even more serious, but those executed were all wicked men, and it was somewhat excusable. Moreover, then my master was near to help avert death; but this time it is wholly my own fault, with no chance of redress, and no second master to save me. I expect the matter will be discovered soon, and within days my life will surely end. My death is no loss; with you as disciple you may carry on my teachings and I shall die without regret. From this day forth I will teach you fully the powers I have not yet imparted, so that you may be my successor. After my death, I expect my master to come for me. You must entreat him to intercede for me, to reduce my guilt. This is the most important matter; do not forget it.”

Changfang was deeply moved. At this point there was nothing to be said; he comforted him briefly and then fell silent. It is not known to the mortal realm, but in the heavens the laws of reward and punishment are strict. Already the gods of the Three Realms have reported to the Jade Emperor that Wang Yizhi and Li Shaojun have insulted the chaste soul and deceived the sovereign, and have commanded the star-year official Dongfang Shuo to investigate and enforce the law. Dongfang Shuo, close to court, since Li Shaojun’s summons into the palace, has been highly favoured by the Martial Emperor, ranking above Dongfang Shuo himself. This is because Dongfang Shuo is upright and loyal, standing in court only to guide the sovereign rightly, exposing his faults, sometimes using cunning remonstrance, sometimes blunt speech. His merits are not few. Yet for this reason the Martial Emperor dislikes and envies him. Li Shaojun especially resents Dongfang Shuo, and most malignantly accuses that the last time the Queen Mother and the host of immortals were invited, they were but a band of demons in disguise. In truth, the real Queen Mother still sits high in the Jade Pool, unaware of these matters. The Martial Emperor was greatly suspicious. Now, hearing Shaojun’s words, and since Shaojun is the most trusted, the Emperor gave ear and believed, though no proof was found. Dongfang Shuo, not satisfied, left the matter aside.

But the Martial Emperor’s hatred for Dongfang Shuo grew ever stronger, and so did his jealousy. Naturally Dongfang Shuo knew these secrets. Fortunately he cared little for rank or favour, and whether the Emperor trusted him or not was of no concern. Let them plot and slander as they will; he would pay no heed. Yet for his own safety he no longer gave such wholehearted loyalty as before; the Emperor no longer spoke much to him, and he himself withdrew from court affairs, cultivating his great Dao. Thus the sovereign and his ministers remained at peace. Now, having received the heavenly mandate, and hearing of Shaojun’s collusion with Wang Yizhi to seize a chaste soul and impersonate Lady Li to deceive the Emperor, Dongfang Shuo, though not a party to the matter, found it difficult to shirk responsibility.

One day, pondering how to take the lives of Wang Yizhi and Li Shaojun, Dongfang Shuo considered that although Wang Yizhi’s power was not great, Shaojun’s sorcery was formidable, no less than his own merit. To oppose him would lose heavenly dignity, delay matters, draw the Jade Emperor’s blame; and as Shaojun was close to the Emperor, if Dongfang Shuo summoned him, Shaojun might claim the Emperor’s protection and refuse to obey, even accusing Dongfang Shuo. To strike secretly with a flying sword would contravene celestial rules. He must ascertain their crimes and punish them openly, to deserve the office of law enforcer. Such is the way of Heaven’s bureaucracy, that matters be done openly and with justice. Yet this was difficult. After much hesitation, weariness overcame him and he fell asleep at his desk.

Just as slumber overtook him, he heard amid the air the cries of phoenixes and cranes, followed by birds alighting in his courtyard. Hastily rising, still half asleep, he saw two immortals standing by the courtyard, one clad in white, the other cloaked, accompanied by a splendid phoenix and white crane at rest. Dongfang Shuo did not recognize them, but arranged his attire and approached reverently, inquiring their names and origin. The two immortals smiled and said: “Have you so soon forgotten us since last we met?” The one in white was a lame immortal, who laughed, “I am Li Xuan, styled Iron Crutch.” He pointed to the other, “He is Xuan Zhuzi. Old friends of past lives; how say you you do not know us?”

Dongfang Shuo, versed in the Dao and communicant with spirits though among mortals, suddenly recalled the heavenly affairs and, smiling, confessed his fault and invited the two immortals to his study. They laughed, “No one comes to the Triple Treasure Hall without cause. We come because Star-Year Official has troubles, and we wish to offer some aid. Also to ask a small favour of you.” Seating them, Dongfang Shuo asked, “Is this about Wang Yizhi? He is a senior disciple of Daoist Brother Li. Alas, this matter is so ruinous it may be beyond repair.” Iron Crutch replied, “I do not come to save his life. As a ghost-master, he knows law but breaks it; if such be pardoned, then all the ten great crimes of the world may be forgiven. The penalty is death, and once dead the punishment is complete. My concern, for the sake of many years of master and disciple, is that once he enters the underworld he will suffer further torment. I have spoken with Star-Year Official to see if, after his death, I might take his body and have him undergo several hundred years of arduous cultivation, so that he might yet have some fortune. This is our bond as teacher and disciple. Might this be done?”

Dongfang Shuo answered, “This is easy. Heaven has fixed penalties; when they are fulfilled, no further punishment is given. Besides, Yizhi is but a drunken fool, no ill intent. His case is pitiful; with your care he may yet repay his life of chivalry and loyalty. This can surely be done.” He then asked Xuan Zhuzi, “You have come from afar; have you any counsel to give?” Xuan Zhuzi smiled, “Iron Crutch speaks for his disciple. I have no request of you, but now that you have the heavenly commission to punish Li Shaojun, know that Shaojun was formerly a follower of the Heavenly Master, who made trouble at Huaihai Village and for Lady Luo Yuan. This creature is a demon, a great tortoise cultivated five thousand years, carrying a magic treasure named ‘Covering Eye Ball,’ formed from its own turtle egg, cursed with the filthiest things of the human world. When this orb appears, all eyes are shrouded as if by a thick mist, and faces cannot be seen.”

Hearing this, Dongfang Shuo nodded and said, “No wonder I heard that last time he used a ghost to impersonate Lady Li before the Emperor. The Emperor could see the figure but not her face, confused as through a fog five li thick. At the time I did not know what power he used to create such a scene. Now, according to you, it was this orb’s work.”

Xuan Zhuzi smiled and said, “This is but a small matter. Whether Your Majesty sees Lady Li or not is of little consequence. You have not heard of what happened at Qiantang River. The tides there are great everywhere. Since I took office, I have bounded the great tides into one zone; elsewhere the tides are diminished and shallow, and the disgruntled flood dragon and tortoise demons cannot hide there. Where the tides are great, I control them; though cunning, they cannot prevail. But the old flood dragon contrived an evil plan, last year inviting the tortoise demon to attack in force. The tortoise demon suspended its orb and cast spells; our divine generals were blinded and almost caught in its snare. Fortunately, Master Wenmei sent his disciple Tonghui to make a crystal bottle at Wenbi Peak in Fujian, which emits light and absorbs the demon’s mist. He arrived in time to drive it into the sea where it dared not appear. Now it has assumed human form to confuse the Emperor. I came specially to aid you in removing this demon. Its treasure not only blinds but resists weapons. It knows it has done much evil and fears divine punishment; it often hangs the orb in its chamber, both to guard against secret attack and to blind others to its location. Though you have the commission to investigate, I fear you may not easily remove it.”

Dongfang Shuo, trembling, bowed low and said, “I thank you for journeying far to instruct me. If you would reveal the method to remove the demon, it would be not only my good fortune but that of all the people.”

How Xuan Zhuzi replied shall be told in the next chapter.
