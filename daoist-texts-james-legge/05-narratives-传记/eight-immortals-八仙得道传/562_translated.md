# Chapter 94: The Miraculous Manifestation of Guo Lao Riding Backwards on a Donkey, and Lüzu Redeems the Sentimental Debts of the World

It is related that after Emperor Ming of the Tang, having obtained the great immortal Zhang Guo as his national master, was at first devout and sincere in inquiring into the profound principles of the Daoist path. But afterwards, being enticed by wine and women, he grew negligent even of the affairs of state, much less did he retain the heart to cultivate the way of immortality. Zhang the immortal, however, was possessed of many wondrous and holy marvels; whenever the emperor was in high spirits, he would invite him to amuse himself with some feats and tricks. 

On one occasion, the emperor saw that the donkey which Zhang rode was singularly spirited and swift. Zhang, whenever he went abroad, always rode his donkey backwards, which was considered very strange. The emperor specially commanded that he should ride the donkey into the palace, and take a ride in the imperial garden. Zhang, being of a loyal and filial heart, ever cherished reverence towards the Son of Heaven; he naturally dared not disobey the imperial command. 

Accordingly, upon imperial order, he entered the garden and rode his donkey backwards, making a large circuit. The donkey was strange indeed, needing no guidance from its rider, moving according to the will of its mind, sometimes swift, sometimes slow, proceeding according to the course without error. After riding awhile, the emperor summoned him into the palace to a banquet, ordering that the donkey be tethered within the garden and fed. Zhang said: “My donkey is wont not to eat; a cup of water is all it requires.” The emperor consented, and ordered the eunuchs to lead it to drink water, while a banquet was prepared and Zhang sat to drink with the emperor.

After some conversation, the emperor asked leave to withdraw, commanding his ministers to remain for the feast. He quietly went to observe the donkey. The eunuchs reported that the donkey drank a cup of clear water but refused to drink more. The emperor then commanded that it be given wine. A large jar of aged wine was brought and presented to the donkey. The donkey took a sip, perceived a strange taste, and refused to drink further. The emperor was angered, saying: “If it will not drink wine, then behead it.” Hearing the decree, the donkey, before the eunuchs could force it to drink, raised its head, and with its two forefeet grasped the jar, and in a flowing draught drank the entire jar of fine wine. Immediately it knelt, and lifted its two front legs in a posture of obeisance to the emperor. The emperor was greatly delighted and about to reward it with words, when suddenly the donkey’s drunkenness took hold; its body swayed and softly collapsed on its side. The eunuchs called to it repeatedly, but it did not rise; they kicked it, but it did not stir. Yet the sound was like a blow upon paper.

The emperor was amazed, and stepped forward, kicking twice more, each time hearing a sound as if striking a paper-made object. He could not but be both amazed and amused. When he looked again, the donkey lay stretched upon the ground, its eyes wide and white, breath utterly gone; it was indeed dead. The emperor was somewhat startled and hastened to ask: “Look now, can it be saved? If not, bury it quickly; when the old Daoist comes to inspect, say it has run away. Do not tell him the truth, lest he see us as mere children at play.” Before he finished speaking, a eunuch pulled the donkey up by one hand, shouting: “This donkey is a sham; it is but a paper donkey.” The emperor was also astonished, and looking closely, saw that indeed it was a donkey made of papier-mâché. He laughed heartily, saying: “This old Daoist is too skilful at play; he deceived us with this paper donkey. Were it not for forcing it to drink that jar of good wine, we had nearly been taken in. Take this donkey with us; I will go and question the old Daoist.” 

So the emperor led the way, with the eunuchs following, dragging the paper donkey to Zhang the immortal himself. The emperor laughed, saying: “Old Daoist, you are cunning in your deceit; how is it that you brought a paper donkey to ride into my palace?” Zhang hastily bowed down and replied: “The donkey I ride is indeed paper-made; by my slight arts, I have passed it off as a real donkey. When Your Majesty forced it to drink wine and it became intoxicated, the truth was revealed. As the vulgar world calls it, a paper tiger, appearing real, may deceive men for a time, but cannot endure long. Therefore the affairs of the world value only the true. Falsehood is not worth speaking of.” 

The emperor laughed, saying: “You may well be said to be skilled in sarcasm. Pray, tell me, if a paper tiger were made, could it also be made to move?” Zhang replied: “It is all by means of a little magic. What difference is there between a tiger and a donkey?” The emperor commanded that a paper tiger be made, and bade Zhang try it. Zhang answered: “There is no need to make one; I can take a piece of white paper at will, and with incantations, instantly form a tiger.” The emperor was greatly pleased, and ordered a trial. Zhang took a sheet of paper in his hand, kneaded it with all his strength, murmuring spells, then cast it aside with a shout, and lo! a spotted fierce tiger, baring teeth and brandishing claws, leapt about beneath the hall. 

The emperor, fearing it would spring upon him, asked if the tiger could harm men. Zhang replied: “If the paper donkey can go walking, how can the paper tiger fail to do mischief?” The emperor’s heart was filled with fear, and he said: “Your magic is wondrous and vast; truly worthy of admiration and reverence! Now pray take back this paper tiger, lest its wild nature be roused and it injure men.” Zhang said: “With me here, what fear have I that a sham tiger should cause mischief?” Saying this, he waved his hand, and the paper tiger immediately fell prostrate. The emperor and all the ministers plainly saw that though the tiger seemed dead, it still preserved the form of a tiger. Zhang said it had already changed back into a lump of white paper. None but the master Ye was able to perceive it was but a small bundle of paper. Zhang smiled, took it back into his hand, and gently unfolded it, until it was restored to a sheet of white paper.

On another occasion, the emperor, hearing that Zhang had great capacity for wine, wished to get him drunk. He concealed drugs in the wine, and compelled him to drink ten jars full. Zhang knelt and said: “My capacity for wine is small; to drink too much would be unseemly. If Your Majesty would grant a single intoxication, I have a disciple who may drink in my stead. If Your Majesty is graciously pleased, I will summon him for an audience.” The emperor asked where the disciple was. Zhang waved his hand to the sky, and with a great rumble a fair and youthful Daoist flew down from the corner of the hall like a falling bird. The emperor was greatly pleased, asked him some questions; the youth answered with ease and propriety, his manners polished; the emperor was greatly fond of him, and commanded that wine be given him. The youth drank ten jars in one breath, showing no sign of intoxication. Another ten goblets were given, and likewise he drained them at a draught. The emperor laughed: “Go and bring the great jar of imperial wine from the harem; see if he can finish it.” Zhang knelt and said: “Do not give any more; if given, he will surely be drunk, and lose his manners. This is merely to amuse Your Majesty; if manners be lost, it will only disturb his nature, and so defeat my humble purpose of diverting Your Majesty’s cares.”

The emperor would not yield, and bade that the wine be brought. Suddenly the youth fell backwards upon the ground. Zhang hurriedly said: “This child is so untrained! Only Your Majesty can pardon him.” While speaking, he hastily covered him with a cloth. After a while, the eunuchs reported that the great jar of imperial wine was missing. The emperor was angry, saying: “The palace is a place of utmost security; how can things go missing? Immediately investigate severely.” Zhang knelt and said: “Pray Your Majesty be appeased; the jar is beneath my cloth.” The emperor was greatly amazed, and ordered the eunuchs to raise the cloth. There was no youth, but only the jar of wine standing upright. The wine was poured out and measured; the twenty jars which the youth had drunk were all there, not a drop less. The emperor could not help laughing aloud. 

On another occasion, the emperor said to Gao Lishi: “I have heard that those who drink cinnabar and are not bitter are only the immortals.” Gao Lishi jestingly said: “Let Zhang Guo try.” The emperor ordered cinnabar and wine to be brought to Zhang. Zhang drank it, and presently was somewhat intoxicated, saying: “What sort of wine is this? It seems to have a strange taste.” The emperor seeing him drunk, ordered a couch to be set in the palace and commanded the eunuchs to support him to sleep. The next day, Zhang’s teeth had turned black. Zhang smiled, raised a ruyi sceptre in his hand, and lightly wiped them; immediately they regained their whiteness.

Yet again, when following the emperor on a hunt, they took a great stag. The emperor ordered it to be cooked as an accompaniment to wine. Zhang said: “This is a celestial stag, whose life is a thousand years. In the fifth year of the Yuanshou era of the Han Emperor Wu, he hunted in Shanglin and caught it; unexpectedly it still lives among men to this day.” The emperor laughed: “What proof is there?” Zhang said: “Emperor Wu caught it and set it free, hanging a small copper plaque on the stag’s left horn.” The emperor ordered the plaque to be examined, and indeed there was one about two inches long, though the inscription was blurred and illegible. The emperor then commanded that another plaque be hung on the right horn, and again released it. Thereby the emperor specially praised his wide learning.

Zhang served at court for more than twenty years, and saw that the emperor treated him as a mere plaything to amuse himself, caring naught for the rights and wrongs of state, nor the sufferings of the people. Therefore he several times sought to depart. The emperor strove eagerly to detain him, refusing to let him go. Zhang was the most reserved of the Eight Immortals, and seeing the emperor’s treatment, dared not insist on leaving, yet could not bear to go without leave-taking. At this time Lüzu still dwelt with him, never parting day or night. Zhang therefore related his difficulties to Lüzu. Since the day they had roamed the pleasure quarters together, Zhang had again proposed returning to the mountains. Lüzu calculated that he had at most but a few days more of worldly ties; when these were fulfilled, he might obtain a worthy disciple to carry on his wishes. Hearing this, Zhang ceased to speculate on the future. 

Yet the emperor, having witnessed many of Zhang’s miraculous deeds, long desired to learn of his origin. He questioned him repeatedly, but Zhang would not answer truthfully. His intention was to conceal his true identity, lest it shock the people’s eyes and bring scandal—he was not ashamed of his origin, nor did he fear laughter. The emperor, not obtaining a true answer, confided the matter to Master Ye Fashan, who at first refused to speak. The emperor, wishing to provoke him, said: “You are a master of the rites, and Zhang Guo is one you introduced; how is it you know not his origin? It seems you masters are but names without substance, without any true skill.” 

Fashan blushed deeply at these words and angrily said: “How could I not know the national master Zhang? But I fear that if he knew I spoke, he would have me put to death. Would Your Majesty intercede for me and ask him not to punish me?” The emperor laughed: “If you say it, I hear it, but I will tell no one else; how shall the master know?” Fashan said: “Your Majesty underestimates Zhang Guo. He is a golden immortal of high rank. Every word and act of ours is known to him; why should he need to hear it from another?” 

The emperor said: “Speak boldly; if the master oppose you, I will defend you.” Fashan began to relate that he had lived in the chaotic times, how a mouse with great resolve cultivated itself, transformed into a bat, then a man, then attained the immortal way; he told all in great detail. The emperor listened with great interest, but suddenly Fashan cried out, spouted blood, fell to the ground, and cried: “Master, spare me! Master, forgive my crime!” The emperor was alarmed and dismayed, hurried to plead for him, and ordered the eunuchs to support Fashan, who kowtowed to the empty sky. Presently the hemorrhage ceased, and he staggered home. Though the bleeding stopped, his body still ached grievously. Yet his wife was capable and advised him to visit Zhang Guo, confess his faults, and beg to be accepted as his disciple and taught the way; thus he might gain mercy, not lose his life, and have hope of immortality.

Fashan, hearing this, was greatly enlightened. With difficulty he sought audience with Zhang, following his wife’s advice, and earnestly begged. Zhang knew his sincerity, and since Fashan had been scrupulous and upright since becoming national master, never acting unlawfully, and was clever, Zhang deemed him worth cultivation and consented to receive him as disciple. From the day Fashan revealed his origin, the emperor feared Zhang’s displeasure, and for several days dared not summon him. Lüzu laughed and said to Zhang: “My words have been verified. Now is a good opportunity for you to depart. Why do you not go?” Zhang laughed: “What day and hour do I not wish to go? Firstly, I await your completion of the matter of White Peony; secondly, I have not yet decided how to leave.” Lüzu laughed: “I inform you, the examiner has finished his business, and now awaits your honourable departure; we shall immediately leave the capital together.” Zhang laughed: “Why such haste? Tell me the examination questions first, then the written answers, so I may judge whether you the examiner are partial.” 

Lüzu laughed: “That is a very easy matter. From the day I spoke to you of White Peony’s origin, I went to her house, talked with her of trifling matters of love and flowers; she was not much interested, but seeing me so eager, she could not but reply a little. At night we slept in one bed. Suddenly she said she was advanced in years, her beauty waning, that the pleasure quarters were no place for long love, and if continued, the consequences would be unbearable. She wept bitterly. I then urged her, saying: ‘I will jump with you out of the fiery pit, and marry you to a young nobleman of understanding, wealth, and rank. Suppose you have a few years of happiness, and when the time comes, with eyes closed, you return to the dust with the grass and trees; what pleasure then is there?’ On hearing this, she seemed deeply moved.

In the middle of the night, I watched her; she turned and tossed, sighed deeply; I knew not what she thought. I feigned deep sleep and gave her no heed. Unexpectedly, she suddenly lifted me and shook me violently. I pretended to wake and asked why. Her words amazed and delighted me. She said that moved by my words, she had suddenly turned her mind to cultivating the way. Having heard that I knew many immortals, she wished me to tell her where they dwelt, that she might seek them out and be accepted as disciple, willing to cast away the world and enter the profound path. Seeing her sudden awakening, how could I but be amazed and glad? I answered her casually, gave her a small pillow, and bade her rest as usual.

When she awoke, before daybreak, she suddenly wept and rose, bowed before the bed, called me master, and earnestly begged to leave the world. She told in detail her dreams, having passed through the trials and tribulations of life, riches, and glory, finding the pleasures of life insufficient for attachment. Her heart for cultivation was ever stronger. Most strange was that because my pillow was somewhat magical, and recalling my past exhortations, she was sure I was a deity come to save her. Such wisdom is amazing! At this point I pitied her true sincerity and her perilous state, and consented to take her as disciple. I told her of her past life and her present origin.

On the second day, by magic I sent her out of the pleasure quarter; a gust of wind bore her from the capital to the Zhongnan mountains. Now she has likely reached Zhongnan, with no regrets. If she be truly sincere and diligent, undaunted by hardship, when she comes to Zhongnan I will have further arrangements to cultivate her. In about five hundred years there may be some fruit of fate.” Zhang laughed: “This is but fulfilling human kindness. In truth, since she has this awakening and such a good master as you, she will surely become immortal. Why then must she be tested thrice more, and again given a last great trial?” Lüzu laughed heartily, saying: “Your opinion is indeed correct. But an ordinary woman, lucky to meet us and have an awakening thought, and so become immortal, without first passing through some danger and hardship, would be too easy for her.” Zhang laughed: “Do you not regard the nights we shared a bed?” Lüzu laughed again.

After some talk, Zhang again discussed how to leave. Lüzu whispered: “Thus, without leaving a trace.” Zhang applauded his cleverness. The next day, the emperor, thinking that Zhang had not appeared at court for three days, and suspecting some plot, fearing displeasure or that he might return to the mountains, sent four eunuchs with imperial orders, bestowing many rare and excellent fruits. But Zhang was gravely ill. The eunuchs came to the door; the servants reported that the national master was seriously ill and could not receive the edict. The eunuchs returned with the gifts and reported to the emperor. The emperor was greatly alarmed, and asked the master of rites: “Do immortals also fall ill?” By this time Ye Fashan had become Zhang’s disciple, and knowing his master’s intent, replied: “Immortals and men are alike in this; of course they fall ill.” The emperor was about to dispatch imperial physicians, when a report came that the national master had already passed away. The emperor was greatly astonished, and with Ye Fashan and others went to the Jixian Academy to pay respects. When the ministers of the academy petitioned to return to the palace, saying: “After death the national master’s body has decomposed and stinks intolerably, which would harm the sacred person; we beg permission to cease the mourning.” The emperor grew more suspicious, saying: “Common men do not decompose at once; much less an immortal body. How can it so quickly decay?” He ordered the master of rites to offer sacrifices on his behalf, and to watch carefully whether the national master were truly dead, or feigning death to return secretly to the mountain. If the truth be found, report to me.

After this, the emperor returned to the palace. Ye Fashan was left to attend with colleagues and officials to the funeral. When the coffin was carried out, the bearers said the coffin was as heavy as that of a common man. The emperor, learning this, believed Zhang was truly dead. Long afterwards, during the An-Shi rebellion, when the emperor fled to Shu, he personally saw an immortal descend from the sky, bow three times to the emperor, and vanish in an instant. A man brought forth a jade box sealed with a letter, which when opened gave a detailed account of the cause and effect of the rebellion, and said the emperor would soon return to the capital, begging him to cherish his dragon body. Inside was the jade ruyi sceptre formerly given by the emperor, but without a signature. The emperor suspected the immortal must be Zhang Guo, and that Zhang was not dead, which was without doubt. Upon returning to the capital, the emperor ordered the coffin to be opened, and found only a bamboo staff buried within.

Whither Zhang Guo went after feigning death, and what marvels followed, remain to be told in the next chapter.
