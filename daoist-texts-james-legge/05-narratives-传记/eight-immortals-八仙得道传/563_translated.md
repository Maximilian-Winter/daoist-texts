# Chapter 95: Warding off Heterodoxy, Wen Gong Deposes Daoism; Descending Gentle Rain, Xiangzi Displays Divine Power

Now it so happened that Han Xiangzi was born into the Han household, and in a short while he had already passed his tenth year. When he was about five years old, his father, Han Hui, observing his exceptional cleverness, said to his brother Han Yu: "This child Xiangzi has a very fine natural talent, and it seems he may be expected to become a person of worth. We must engage a good teacher to instruct him in letters." Han Yu, hearing this, made diligent inquiry far and wide, and successively invited several renowned masters to teach Xiangzi alone.

But it was not foreseen that Xiangzi was born with a prior wisdom; whatever the classic texts might be, none could escape his eye. Once having cast his glance upon them, he not only could recite them fluently, but also needed no explanation from the teacher, being able himself to penetrate and comprehend the profound and subtle principles and purport contained therein. In some passages, where the teacher would often point out difficulties and obscurities, Xiangzi was able to cite the classics and authorities, drawing from various sources, to expound a true and unerring principle of the Great Way, causing the several masters to one and all confess themselves inferior. After instructing him for a year, in the second year they refused to continue. Thus, by the time Xiangzi was twelve years old, he had changed four or five renowned masters.

In that winter, because the masters had resigned their posts, and within several hundred li all heard that the young master of the Han household was indeed a prodigy, teachers and scholars who usually prided themselves on their learning feared to encounter this prodigy and be overthrown by him, thereby ruining their lifelong reputations; so none dared easily to come and attempt to teach. After much seeking, not a single famous teacher could be obtained. Han Hui could not help but smile to Han Yu, saying: "It appears that the so-called learned men of this age are no better than this. How is it that not one of them can match a mere child?"

Han Yu replied gravely: "Brother, do not speak thus. A child, by reason of some cleverness, may pick up a little superficial knowledge, and by chance can point out some of the ancient masters' flaws, but he does not understand their right and wrong. How then can you regard him as so exceptional? As for those masters formerly invited, so far as I know, such and such men truly possessed great learning and profound ability. Their natural intelligence may not have equalled Xiangzi's, but in respect of real talent and genuine learning, not to speak of other matters, merely their diligent study by lamplight for forty or fifty years cannot be compared in the least to a child's mere three or five years of half-understanding. The reasons they resigned were either that they themselves felt their spirit flagging, fearing to mislead the pupil; or that Xiangzi, confident in his cleverness, was somewhat arrogant and presumptuous. They, looking to you and me as brothers, were unwilling to speak the truth, fearing to offend and lose harmony, so they merely made polite excuses and parted. How then can you so firmly believe that Xiangzi's learning surpasses that of the ordinary masters? Such words, you must not allow the children to hear. Youth is naturally ignorant of the heights of heaven and the depths of earth; if they hear their father thus laud them, will they not become arrogant and self-conceited, their eyes raised above their station? At this stage, brother, I fear that this little cleverness of his, far from being a blessing, as Mencius said of the man who fills a basin and pours it over the rim, may be a misfortune to the house of Han rather than a good fortune!" Han Hui heard this and was silent.

The third winter was nearly over, and spring was at hand; Xiangzi was then at the critical moment of earnest study. Not a single teacher could be found for a long time, which was truly a difficult matter. The two brothers often talked of this and found it very perplexing. Unexpectedly, at the end of the twelfth lunar month of that year, a young man came, presenting a card requesting to see the two gentlemen. The elder brothers saw that the card bore the name Lü Gupeng. They looked at it and said that no such friend was known. Together they prepared themselves and went out to meet him; he was not yet thirty years of age, his face like a jade crown, his lips like vermilion, handsome and extraordinary, dignified and eminent. Both brothers were astonished, as if in all their years in the world they had never seen so elegant a person. This thought was reflected on their faces, which unconsciously showed great admiration.

Upon conversation, they learned that this man was a scholar who had failed in the imperial examinations, confident that his learning embraced Heaven and man; since he could not enter officialdom, he no longer aspired to the examinations, and had taken to teaching various schools of thought. Hearing that the young master of the household was exceptionally clever, and many renowned masters had declined, and now no suitable teacher could be found, he, though humble and ignorant, thought that a genius not of this world would one day appear above the worldly dust; to be his teacher would be to enable him to progress boundlessly and easily become a Daoist. Being not clever, yet not modest, he dared to emulate Mao Sheng in recommending himself. He requested to see the young master first, and if not trusted, he would immediately withdraw, avoiding the pitfalls of previous masters. The two brothers found his voice clear and his bearing remarkable, and knew he must be a man of great background. While engaging him in idle talk, they summoned Xiangzi to meet Gupeng. Han Hui, fearing that Xiangzi might be too arrogant, thought: if I, who defeated many learned men, now confront such a young man, and if Xiangzi were to be confronted openly, it might not be proper. But when Xiangzi saw Gupeng, he first sized him up, then stepped forward with a smile and respectfully bowed, not knowing himself he kowtowed several times, saying, "This one is truly my teacher."

The elder brothers were greatly surprised to see this, and smiling, said to Gupeng: "This child is indeed clever, but his nature is somewhat stubborn; we have not before seen him so sincerely pleased and compliant with any teacher." Gupeng replied with a smile: "An unrestrained talent requires a special method of teaching. Perhaps the previous masters, though long accustomed to their craft, had never taught so extraordinary a pupil. They treated the young master as an ordinary disciple, applying the same methods of instruction; no wonder there was a mismatch." Han Hui, having invited Gupeng to test Xiangzi's learning, also wished to see the teacher's ability. Gupeng, well understanding this, casually spoke with Xiangzi about the studies he had been pursuing. Xiangzi thought these all very shallow learning. Yet when Gupeng began to instruct, Xiangzi found that what he knew and understood was truly but the surface. The profound principles Gupeng spoke of had never before been mentioned by previous masters; his mind was suddenly opened, and with joyous laughter said, "Is this not what I said? This is my true master! What he says is all very common principles, and I myself can say nothing in reply. This shows the true skill of the teacher."

Han Yu, who had most feared Xiangzi's cleverness and superficial reading of the classics, now found in Gupeng a great benefit; for it made Xiangzi aware of the difficulties of study, and henceforth he dared not deceive himself with half-knowledge. His heart was much satisfied. By this agreement, Gupeng was invited to live in the house and teach for three years continuously. Xiangzi not only advanced greatly in his studies but also became more humble and well-behaved. By this time Han Hui had passed away. Han Yu was deeply impressed with this teacher, but then discovered a matter which greatly displeased him. Since Xiangzi had studied under Gupeng, he had devoted himself to the study of Daoist books, and sometimes discoursed on meditation, internal cultivation, the alchemical elixir, and the Great Way. This angered Han Yu beyond speech. Proud of his Confucian orthodoxy and transmission of the Way, seeing his sons and nephews drawn towards heterodox paths, how could he submit to another? But by the time he discovered this, three years had passed.

According to Xiangzi himself, he had planted a seed of spiritual aptitude completely within the Daoist gate, and was about to leave home to cultivate the Way. Han Yu was furious; he personally seized a large staff and questioned Xiangzi: "Whence did you learn this knowledge? Was it taught by that Gupeng?" Xiangzi fearlessly replied: "The three teachings are all sacred Ways. How can it be said that Confucianism and Buddhism are necessarily heretical? You disparage Buddhism and Daoism because you see that the monks and Taoists of the world only do evil and deceive for money, understanding nothing of learning; thus you hate them to this extreme. In truth, those are but rogue elements of the two teachings, not tolerated by Confucianism, and not recognized by Buddhism or Daoism themselves, who disown such impostors who beg under their names. If you could calmly and quietly study the true mysteries, subtle sayings, and esoteric scriptures of the two teachings, you would see there are principles beyond the reach of Confucianism."

Han Yu, hearing this, stamped his feet and cursed Xiangzi as having no ruler or father, a barbarian and beast. He said: "This is all the pernicious teaching of that Lü Gupeng. At first I had some suspicion; he volunteered himself without invitation, coming to our door. From ancient times, where has there been such a self-deprecating teacher? And you, this slave, many good teachers disliked your arrogance and were driven away by you; helpless, I allowed this man to stay and try. But I do not know his background, nor in whose house he served as a tutor. Sloppily, he has stayed three years. Because I have been busy with state affairs, I have not investigated your studies. I did not expect you to go so far astray, step by step into error. Though the teaching is the teacher's responsibility, your stubborn and unruly temper has offended many decent teachers. But you obey this heresy so eagerly and reverently. This shows that it is you yourself who have failed to learn well. From this moment forth, as a scion of the Han family, you must obey your uncle's instruction, discard entirely the heretical studies of these three years. Not only must you not speak of them, but you must not even think of them. Apply yourself properly, for you are still young; you may yet go out to take examinations. You have such natural talent, and with three more years of hard work, there is still time. Otherwise, the Han house indeed is unworthy to have such a descendant. Even the illustrious Huaxia has no place for such an evil man as you. Not only does our household not deserve to keep you, but neither can you find footing within the four seas or upon the land beneath the heavens." 

Xiangzi, hearing these harsh words, was displeased in his heart, but smiled faintly and said: "Uncle, do you regard Daoism as so utterly vile, and me as some unpardonable sinner? Honestly I tell you, though you despise me, I follow my teacher's law. I know you were punished and demoted by the Jade Emperor's official, General Juan Lian Chong Hezi. If I am to become a Daoist, I must first save you, uncle, before I ascend to receive office. Do you know who my master is? You, single-minded to inherit Confucianism, may not know the important Golden Immortals of Daoism. But I cannot but tell you. My present master is the most famous and respected in the Daoist gate, comparable to Yan, Zeng, Meng, Xun in Confucianism. His surname is Lü, his name Yan, styled Dongbin. The name Gupeng is a secret name of Dongbin. Uncle, this Lü master is truly a Great Luo Golden Immortal of Heaven!"

Xiangzi was about to relate Lü Zu’s origin, his beginning of cultivation, the period of attainment, and the master-disciple relations of the past three years to Han Yu. But Han Yu, hearing these words, covered his ears, crying out again and again, "He is mad! He is mad!" He struck the desk loudly and called for the senior master. Xiangzi, seeing him in such anger, could not help but smile, and hastened to stop him: "Uncle, do not be impatient. My master Lü has already calculated that we two shall part today. If you send for him now, it will be too late." Han Yu did not believe this and urged his attendants to hasten to the study; if the senior master was there, he must be summoned immediately. The servants responded and went, but just then the study’s page boy ran out and collided headlong with them. Han Yu questioned the page boy why he came. The page boy advanced a few steps and presented a letter, written by Lü Shiye as a farewell to Han Yu. Han Yu was surprised and hastily opened it. It roughly said: "Your nephew in a former life was a Golden Immortal of Heaven, but through mismanagement of official business was banished to the banks of the Xiang River. He was originally the immortal body of a white crane, and now still in that form. Upon the expiry of his term, he and his master Zhongli Yunfang shall jointly receive him into their discipleship. Therefore he is sent here to the world of Yang, to cultivate the Way anew, so as to be delivered and ascend to return to his true essence. It also tells of your former life, agreeing with what Xiangzi has said. It ends: 'Born with innate wisdom, cultivation is comparatively easy. Within three years he has comprehended profound principles. Now he ought to leave his home and hasten to famous mountains to nurture himself. After twenty years, he will reach a minor accomplishment. After thirty years, he is to personally deliver you, uncle, to the Way.' There follow some parting words." Han Yu, seeing this letter, was speechless with anger, and with both hands tore it to pieces. But, strangely, the letter tore but then rejoined and was as before. Han Yu, seeing this, was more terrified and enraged, cursing: "This demon teaches my nephew; how dare it mock me thus!" He ordered the servants to quickly burn the letter. The servants obeyed and set fire to it; the flames blazed fiercely and the paper turned to ash scattered to the winds. But in a moment, a letter remained neatly lying on the desk.

Han Yu could not help but look to heaven and sigh: "Demons at work! It is all because my virtue is weak and my ability insufficient, and that the fortune of the Han family is too adverse. Good children of the house have been led astray by demons. Now, slave, what do you intend to do? If you truly believe in demons and must enter heterodoxy, and in future poison the Central Plain and bring disaster to later generations, indeed it is better to send you away early. I dare not keep you at home as a sinner against orthodox teaching and a traitor to the ancestors; nor do I wish to have my uncle send you to the magistrate for punishment or banish you beyond the barbarians. It is fortunate that you have an immortal master to raise you and that you are prepared to become a recluse. I pray you take your own way. But if you still have any thought for me as your uncle and your parents and ancestors, you should heed my admonitions, set your mind aright and be clear-headed, desist from these heresies and wild acts, and read the classics of the sages well. Then you will be a good descendant of the Han family, a good subject of the illustrious Hua-xia. To pass the examinations and bring glory to your ancestors will be a small matter; I still hope you may assist me in this great work of upholding the sage and guarding the Way. Right and wrong, take and leave, examine for yourself and act accordingly." Having said this, he did not take up the letter again, but went away in anger.

That night Xiangzi wrote a long memorial, setting forth his intention to cultivate the Way, and hoping that his uncle might soon return to the right path and avoid great calamity. His words were most earnest. Having finished it, he left it in the study, and quietly departed from home, going to Mount Song to cultivate the Way. Meanwhile Han Yu, after his stern rebuke of Xiangzi, returned to the inner chambers, still filled with anger. His wife asked the cause, and Han Yu briefly related the matter. The lady could not help but complain: "Since the death of the eldest uncle, the main branch has but this one son. The eldest aunt loves him like a treasure. When the eldest uncle scolded him a few times, the eldest aunt would cry and make a commotion. Now you have scolded him so, and the child is somewhat dull. During these two years, he has been inseparable from that Lü master, most affectionate. Whenever he returns from lessons, he often talks of how his master is truly a Great Luo Immortal, saying he has such divine power and such great learning. Since he began reading under him, he will surely become an immortal. He also says that though you have merit in Confucian teaching, he was formerly an immortal holding office in the Lingxiao Palace, and will surely return to Daoism. When that time comes, he will guide you into the Way. We have heard such words long ago. We all took him as a child and paid no heed. But this year we have seen many strange deeds. He can rise into the air from the ground, travel through clouds and mist; he can dive into the earth and vanish instantly. It is said these are teachings from his master. But these are but small tricks of immortals; they have little to do with true learning of life and death, or the art of eternal youth and longevity, or the use of the golden elixir and the Great Way..."

The lady’s words made Han Yu more anxious; he stamped and struck the table, and rebuked her for hiding this all this time and fostering his bad nature. This rebuke silenced the lady’s attempt to reason. Han Yu thought: "The child is after all still young; having received this lesson and with his master now gone, I must exert myself to properly discipline him." After a moment’s thought, business called him out. Not long after, news came that Xiangzi had become a recluse, which frightened Han Yu greatly; he hurried home. The household was in tumult.

At this time Han Yu was almost the butt of all the family’s blame, and a great Confucian scholar of eight generations’ fame was reduced to sighs and complaints, utterly helpless. From then on the Han family was often plunged in sorrow and distress.

Three years later, Xiangzi entrusted a villager to send a letter home, which somewhat dispelled the heavy clouds of sorrow. More than ten years later, Xiangzi received from Master Yunfang the book Tian Gang Mei Hui; after pondering and refining it, he comprehended its great meaning in five years. At that time Lü Zu descended upon Mount Song, commanding him to descend and enlighten his uncle. Xiangzi, dressed in Daoist robes, rode on clouds to the capital, and went home to pay respects to his mother, Lady Xu. The lady, seeing Xiangzi, took him as if a living treasure fallen from heaven. Xiangzi knelt and gave her elixirs; both mother and aunt, now over fifty and weakened by illness, took the elixirs and were invigorated, better than in their youth. Xiangzi met his uncle Han Yu, who still bore a haughty manner, and asked what he had learned abroad. Xiangzi spoke a few words briefly. Han Yu was furious and ordered Xiangzi’s Daoist robes to be stripped off. Xiangzi made no resistance, letting them strip him. The robe seemed to grow on his skin and cling to him; after much effort, even the belt could not be undone. As the dispute grew loud, a sudden imperial edict arrived: because of a severe drought and suffering people, the emperor ordered Han Yu to go to the altar of the Soil and Grain to pray for rain. Han Yu dared not delay; he dressed and went. Xiangzi smiled to his mother and aunt, saying: "Uncle will pray for rain for three or five years and still get none." But the ladies believed in his Daoist power, saying: "Good nephew, since you say so, go and help your uncle, make some merit, so that your uncle can believe your Dao and no longer oppose you." Xiangzi shook his head and smiled: "Helping my uncle is my duty. But to make him believe in the Dao is too soon. In my view, it will take ten or more years." Having said this, he turned and vanished.

Han Yu, at the altar, with utmost sincerity, prayed to Heaven and Earth, hoping for early descent of gentle rain. But from morning to noon, not a drop fell, nor did a black cloud appear. The sun blazed fiercely, the heat weighed down the body. Feeling anxious, he suddenly saw a dirty Daoist come and stand beneath the altar, mocking Han Yu. Han Yu, in ill humour, ordered the Daoist seized. The soldiers answered and caught him, bringing him before Han Yu. Han Yu asked why he laughed. The Daoist said: "I laugh not at other things, but at your honourable self, who can only hold office, but has never learnt the art of praying for rain. Is this not laughable?" Han Yu angrily said: "Whence came you, wild Daoist? How dare you mock an old man to his face? Since you utter proud words, can you pray for rain?" The Daoist said boldly: "If I could not, how dare I laugh at another?" Han Yu ordered him to try his magic; if it failed, he would be beheaded. The Daoist laughed and, without offering petitions or writing talismans, merely pointed his precious sword and called out several times, "Where is the god of thunder and lightning?" Suddenly from the sky a voice asked: "The master of the law is summoned; what is the command?"

All on and beneath the altar looked up and saw Thunder Duke and Lightning Mother, leading many celestial gods and generals, standing on clouds and saluting the Daoist. All were frightened and at once knelt down, bowing their heads like pounding garlic. Some also bowed to the Daoist, calling him Great Immortal. Han Yu was put to shame, and furiously scolded the Daoist: "Bold wild Daoist, having been commanded to pray for rain, how dare you use magic to deceive and mislead the people?" The Daoist calmly said to the gods in the clouds: "Here there is a great drought, and Chong Hezi, acting under the emperor’s decree, prays for rain. But he, weighed down by worldly thoughts and unbelieving of the Great Way, has not received a single drop after half a day’s prayer. Now I, poor Daoist, cannot bear to see the people suffer and have gone to borrow a ladle of water from the Dragon King of the Eastern Sea, to distribute to the people. I ask the gods to hasten to spread clouds and rain. I will immediately send forth the water."

Han Yu, hearing only empty words, sought to argue with him. But suddenly a great thunderclap roared from the sky, followed by lightning; dark clouds gathered densely. In a moment the sky darkened, the sunlight vanished, and myriad flashes of golden serpents dazzled the eyes. The people shouted, "Truly the Immortal grants rain! The people are fortunate." Even Han Yu, obstinate on the altar, was dumbfounded and did not know what to do. At that moment another great thunderclap sounded, and all saw the Daoist rise into the air, flying halfway to heaven. All eyes beheld him holding a small bottle, sprinkling water in all four directions. In a moment, a heavy rain poured down with irresistible force. The people crowded beneath the altar, pressing close to its pillars almost to breaking. After the meal-time, the Daoist loudly asked: "Do you, the people, think the rain sufficient? Speak, that I may stop lest the rain become a flood, too much as well as too little." The people cried: "Enough, enough; no more is needed. Great Immortal, come down and allow us to bow in thanks." The Daoist heard and waved his sword; the rain immediately ceased.

They came out from the altar, seeing the Daoist sitting at the gate, smiling and saluting Han Yu: "I have not disgraced your command." The people, regardless of the mud staining their clothes, knelt and bowed loudly. Han Yu at first was dazed. After a moment, his face grew angry, and he said a most incredible thing: "I still do not believe you prayed this rain." The Daoist smiled: "This is a matter seen by all eyes; not a prayer of mine. Could it be your prayer, sir? I am a man outside the world, seeking no fame, desiring no wealth, not contending for merit with you. Why then should you insist on quibbling and show a narrow heart?" Han Yu said angrily: "Where is your proof?" The Daoist smiled: "Is not the testimony of all eyes proof enough? If you do not believe, return to the mansion and see the empty basin in the courtyard; it now contains three feet, one inch, and seven tenths of rain." Han Yu ordered the Daoist taken back and measured; indeed it was exactly so.

The Daoist suddenly knelt and said: "Uncle, do you now believe in the Dao? Pray follow your nephew to cultivate the Way." Han Yu was greatly astonished; looking down, the Daoist was none other than his nephew, Han Xiangzi.

Whether Han Yu would agree to Xiangzi's request and accompany him to cultivate the Way, shall be revealed in the next chapter.
