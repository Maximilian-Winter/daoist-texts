# Chapter Ninety-six: Brewing Wine and Borrowing Flowers; Two Trials of the Immortal Arts — Blue Pass and Qinling Ninefold, Duke Wen

It is said that Han Yu, hearing again and again the exhortations of Xiangzi to cultivate the Way, was greatly angered in his heart; and he commanded men to drag him in, delivering him to his mother, the venerable Madam Xu, to keep custody of him. At this time Madam Xu had already deeply believed that Xiangzi had truly attained the Way. He was a man of considerable talent and understanding, and yet she would not coerce Xiangzi to stay against his will. She said to him: "Your uncle desires that you become a man and establish your career; this is the duty of a senior relative. Since you are able to cultivate immortality and attain the Way, you may be said to follow your proper purpose. I need not necessarily heed your uncle's words and force you against your will. Yet there is one thing I will make clear to you: since you are a man endowed with spiritual power and magical arts, coming and going like clouds and mist, to the east or to the west, it is no matter. Henceforth you must often return to visit your old mother. When my appointed time shall come, and I close my eyes and depart, then I leave you at liberty; whether you come or not will be your own decision." Xiangzi replied: "Mother, please take heart; in the Way of Tao loyalty and filial piety are held most dear. If I had not a mother’s mind, how could I return to visit her? Would I not be no different from a beast? Moreover, how could my two immortal masters have consented to take me as disciple? Mother, rest assured; so long as your son applies himself diligently, after a few years the future will be boundless. When the day comes that your son ascends to Heaven, mother will yet be living on the earth. I shall bring you to transcend this world, to share the blessing of long life." Hearing this, Madam Xu was comforted. Xiangzi, seeing that awakening his uncle was of no use, still returned to Mount Song.

Several years passed from that time; every two or three years he would surely return home once, manifesting some extraordinary efficacy to his uncle. Yet Han Yu was a man of a stubborn nature; no matter how Xiangzi discoursed, vivid and eloquent as he was, he remained unmoved, pursuing his own affairs and paying no heed to Xiangzi. Yet Xiangzi remained resolute and would not desist, determined to bring his uncle to success. He enlightened him seven or eight times, and on the eighth occasion, it happened to be Han Yu’s eightieth birthday. Xiangzi took the opportunity to present felicitations and returned home. Han Yu, considering his advanced years, was touched that his nephew had come so far; his heart softened, and half the resentment he had towards Xiangzi melted away. At the banquet he commanded Xiangzi to take the seat of honour and converse with the nobles and guests. The guests, knowing Xiangzi truly was a man of the Way and an immortal, each desired to seek from him the method of longevity and the formula for resisting old age. Xiangzi then uttered without ceasing some simple, easy-to-follow methods beneficial to body and mind, imparting them casually. This only stirred Han Yu’s anger anew; he said that Xiangzi should not speak such heterodox doctrines before him. He summoned him and asked: "You speak with the volubility of a river; before many elders you speak recklessly. Tell me truly, what skill have you learned outside?" Upon hearing this, Xiangzi casually recited:

> Green mountains, cloudy mountains, a cave — here is my home.  
> At midnight I feast on pure nectar, at dawn I chew the crimson glow.  
> The zither plays jade-like tones, the furnace refines white cinnabar.  
> The precious cauldron holds a golden tiger, the elixir field nurtures white crows.  
> A gourd conceals creation, three feet cut down demons and evil.  
> I pour the wine of transformation, able to open flowers in an instant.  
> If any can learn from me, together we shall behold the immortal blossoms.

Han Yu shouted angrily: "This fellow’s words are but wild nonsense!" The guests all said: "Since he utters such great words, surely he has the power to match them. Let the nephew manifest his marvels; we have no chance to see such things. Today we are happily met; why not invite him to display some divine powers, to open our eyes and enlarge our knowledge?" Han Yu therefore said: "He claims to make wine bloom; then let him try it." Xiangzi laughed and said: "These are but minor arts, unrelated to the true Great Way. I will, according to the golden decree, brew wine to celebrate your uncle’s longevity, and make flowers bloom to entertain the guests. Yet what I hope for from my uncle is yonder, not here. To entice you with such trifles would be indeed disrespectful." Han Yu said: "You may talk without end, but it is useless; why not make it now?" Xiangzi made no answer, but commanded men to take an empty jar and place it in the courtyard, cover it with a screen, snap his fingers thrice, and mutter words of incantation. When the screen was lifted, there was indeed a jar full of fine wine. Xiangzi first offered it to Han Yu, and then to the guests one after another, smiling and saying: "My lords, this wine is not like that which you usually drink; it is the jade nectar of the immortal abodes! Whosoever drinks a cup shall live a year longer, and chronic ailments will be removed." The guests all rushed to drink.

Xiangzi singled out several honoured guests at the upper seats and said: "Lord So-and-so, Minister Such-and-such, your noble bodies have certain old ailments, but now are healed." The others heard and felt nothing, but one Lord Liu, who suffered breathlessness, after a cup, immediately cleared his phlegm and breathed freely, his chest and heart at ease. He then loudly addressed Han Yu: "Lord Han, your nephew truly is a man of the Way and an immortal. Not to speak of other things, the cup of immortal wine he gave has instantly cured half my lifelong ailments. Is this not the marvelous Way of the immortals?" It was that Han Yu’s health had visibly declined in recent years; he often suffered soreness in the loins and bones, and was also deaf and dim-eyed for many years. Having drunk this wine, his eyes brightened, his hearing was restored, and his loins and bones felt strong and comfortable, so that his heart was deeply moved. Hearing Lord Liu’s words, Han Yu could not help but nod and smile at Xiangzi: "You have indeed done a great thing. Now show us the method of flower-blooming, to accompany the wine."

Xiangzi obeyed the command and asked what flowers the guests wished to see. They deliberately named several flowers that were out of season. Xiangzi found this difficult: "Such flowers have withered or faded; where can we find seeds at this time?" Han Yu shouted: "Seeing this, half of what you say is nonsense!" Xiangzi laughed and said: "Uncle, do not be impatient. Today is your great birthday. I have come from afar for what purpose? If I did not bring you such trifle, it would be too disrespectful. Since these flowers do not exist in the world now, we must borrow them from the Queen Mother’s garden." Han Yu asked: "How far is the Queen Mother’s garden?" Xiangzi said: "As to distance, even if one rode on clouds, it would take three or five years. For ordinary men traveling on foot, it would take two or three thousand years. But in the immortal realm, nothing is what it seems; the spiritual mountain is right upon the spirit platform; the immortal realm is but a square inch. I see all the world within and without, not a place but is before my eyes. The Queen Mother’s garden is but a gate beyond a gate."

When he had said this, he went out into the courtyard and gestured to the empty sky; all heard a scattering of cries, and many white cranes flew in. Xiangzi laughed and said: "Do not laugh, gentlemen; these are all my companions of former lives. Now I bid them borrow flowers." The guests praised his care. Xiangzi gave a few words of command to the flock of white cranes, which then flew aloft, high into the clouds, and in an instant were gone from sight. Xiangzi returned to the seat and drank with the guests. After a while the cries of cranes were heard again, clear and loud. All went out to the courtyard and looked up, seeing countless white cranes bringing thousands of famous flowers. Xiangzi said: "This is the Queen Mother’s care for the poor Daoist; since the cranes I sent were insufficient to bear the load, she specially sent her immortal cranes to accompany them." Before he had finished speaking, the cranes all gathered in the courtyard and rolled on the ground; each changed into a fair and comely youth, helping to carry the flowers into the great hall. The guests looked on: there were flowers of many special regions, flowers of the four seasons, and many never seen in the human world, their colours brilliant and fragrances filling the chamber. Among them was a large basin of green blossoms, shaped like peonies, immense in size. Among the flowers sparkled a light, revealing two lines of poetry:

> Clouds stretch across Qinling — where is home?  
> Snow presses Blue Pass — the horse will not advance.

Han Yu asked: "What does this mean?" Xiangzi said: "It speaks of your future, uncle. Heaven’s secrets are hard to reveal; I dare not prophesy. In any case, keep it in your heart; it shall be fulfilled in time." Thereupon, seeing his uncle inclined to belief, Xiangzi earnestly admonished him some more after the banquet. But Han Yu’s worldly feelings were not yet dispelled; he still could not obey. Xiangzi took leave, saying: "Take care, till we meet again," and returned to Mount Song.

Another year passed. Han Yu, having incurred offence by remonstrating against the reception of the Buddha’s bone relic, was banished afar to the southern region of Chaozhou. The day was fixed for departure. Han Yu took two retainers with him and set out. Upon arriving at a place, they missed the inn, and heavy snow began to fall; the cold was piercing, and hunger gnawed at their bellies. For an old man in such plight, it was hard to endure. The two retainers huddled beneath a tree, clinging to one another, not caring for their master but grumbling bitterly. Han Yu sighed to heaven: "I, Han Yu, have been loyal and upright all my life, steadfast in the sacred Way; why must I meet such misfortune in my old age, and come to this state?" The two retainers cried out: "Master, do not utter such complaints. You served well at court, but why utter crazy words and anger the Emperor? This is your own doing and punishment. Today you must bear these hardships. We two have served under your roof, hoping to settle and prosper; but no good fortune have we gained, only this bitter suffering. The road ahead is long, and Chaozhou is a place known for miasma and smoke. We owe you much, yet we come to share such hardships — it is not worth it. Master, we must beg your pardon, and go our separate ways. Our aged and our young all depend on us; we cannot risk our own lives for your sake. We must each follow our own path."

Han Yu was greatly alarmed: "If you two go, leaving me this old man, will I not die of hunger and cold on the road?" They coldly laughed: "You speak well indeed. You only care for your own life as master, but do you think our lives as servants are less precious?" Hearing such insolence, Han Yu recalled his whole life, from youth to old age, never having slighted his servants, especially these two whose parents served in his household for two generations. From his father to himself, besides paying their wages, he had arranged their marriages and given rewards from the household. This time, selecting them to accompany him to Chaozhou was because of their close ties and the deep master-servant affection, so all might be reassured. Yet they could not endure the cold and hunger, and when misfortune came, they openly howled at him. Seeing this, Han Yu first tried to reason with them. When that failed, he grew angry and severely rebuked them. Yet the two were rebellious in heart; even their polite entreaties were disregarded, and when harsh words were added, they refused to endure them. They took up his luggage, bade him farewell, and fled in disorder.

Han Yu knew he could not catch them, and gave up pursuit of his belongings. In the midst of snow and ice, with no village before him nor inn behind, truly famine and cold pressed upon him, weary and worn. He looked about upon a vast expanse of white, snowflakes drifting thick. Far as eye could see, flat and boundless. Except for his one white horse, which the two thieves had spared, no other creature was visible; as for humans, none could be found. Han Yu was thus in a dilemma, his spirit and vitality nearly spent, certain he could not endure the cruel night. And after a night passed, whether he would find a village and how he might reach Chaozhou was altogether uncertain. Thinking on his great age, he resolved he would not beg alms in the world. Poverty is the lot of men, but he felt that if he could not reach Chaozhou, and must endure all suffering and die a stranger, it were better to seek death early, thus sparing further misfortune.

Though so thinking, the evening was late and white all around, endless to the eye; he wished to die, yet knew not how to die swiftly and cleanly. Hesitating long, he could find no way. In his desolation, he spurred his horse forward again. But the horse too could not bear the cold and fell to the ground, refusing to rise; its master was thrown into the snow, motionless. At this time Han Yu no longer felt much sorrow. He thought: to die a stranger, a violent death — better to die in snow than by sword, poison, strangling, or drowning; death in snow is pure and clean. Moreover, as a minister he must bear the law of the state, and not imitate common folk in self-destruction. Now that death comes naturally beneath the snow, is it not the proper way? So he clenched his teeth and closed his eyes, regardless of the great snowflakes beating upon him, the piercing north wind tearing his face, and the white horse’s piteous neighs; all heeding nothing, he waited quietly for the appointed end, to give up the remainder of his life.

Yet the affairs of Heaven have their appointed order. Those not fated to die, even in the tiger’s jaws or beneath myriad blades, yet preserve their lives. Han Yu, being a celestial official of the upper world, banished to the mortal realm, had endured extreme calamities. According to the principle of reversal, when one reaches the utmost misery, the turning point is at hand. Even if he sought death earnestly, how could he die? After long lying in the snow, the sky grew pitch-dark; yet still the great snow whitened all, as if immersed in a world of quicksilver. At last unable to bear it, he opened his eyes to look, and behold! Strange indeed; though he lay in snow, the dark sky and white clouds vanished in a moment. The place where he had been wandering was a vast plain with no village; now he was clearly in a pavilion. Not only he, but his white horse also lay curled on the ground, breathing. Han Yu was greatly amazed, suspecting he was dreaming. His spirit suddenly revived; he struggled to sit up and looked all around the pavilion. More strange still, the pavilion was not an ordinary thatched shelter for rest, but a very exquisite and clean chamber. The household objects within were almost all those used by men, differing greatly from what he first saw. Yet stranger still was that on the couch opposite sat a young Daoist. This Daoist sighed once, then slowly paced over, and suddenly bowed deeply to Han Yu, smiling and saying: "Uncle, do you remember your nephew Xiangzi?" Han Yu fixed his eyes and saw that it was his nephew Han Xiangzi, standing before him with a smile and talk. He knew that Xiangzi had used his magic power to come and save him. This joy was not small; it was the first time since Xiangzi that he had felt the greatest delight in his heart.

Han Yu’s heart was stirred, his blood boiled; he could not help but embrace Xiangzi, tears streaming down, choking with emotion: "My son, how could I have expected to meet you here? Are we meeting in a dream?" Xiangzi helped him to the couch and blew three breaths upon him. Han Yu instantly felt his vitality restored, his whole body warm, and his spirit greatly refreshed. He forgot the suffering of snow and cold, and the torment of dusty days. He rose and walked a few steps, but seeing the white horse still wheezing, near death, he asked Xiangzi to heal it. Xiangzi blew on the horse, which stood up suddenly, nodding to its master as if feeling the parting of death and life. Xiangzi sighed: "Even beasts are thus; how can men endure? Men strive for fame and gain, busy and anxious; in the end they hope only for a natural death — is this not pitiful? Is it not to be lamented?" Han Yu was now fully convinced of the grandeur of the immortal Way; his heart turned wholly to the divine path. Thinking back on how many times he had driven away Xiangzi, he was filled with remorse. Xiangzi, knowing his mind, comforted him. Han Yu asked: "Where is this place?" Xiangzi smiled: "Uncle, do you not remember the poem among the flowers? This place is called Blue Pass."

Before the words were finished, Han Yu suddenly understood and cried aloud: "The number is predetermined, and so it is! I remember your verse. Now meeting here, it must be commemorated." He then chanted the original lines:

> A memorial petition to the Ninefold Heavens at dawn,  
> At dusk condemned to the road eight thousand to Chaoyang.  
> Born to remove the corrupt for a sagely reign,  
> Yet dare I grudge the decaying years of old age.  
> Clouds stretch across Qinling — where is home?  
> Snow presses Blue Pass — the horse will not advance.  
> I know you came from afar with intent,  
> To keep my bones safe beside the river’s bank.

From that time Han Yu devoted himself wholeheartedly to the Way. Xiangzi further led him to meet Masters Zhong and Lü, who revealed to him the affairs of his former life. Han Yu, being supremely wise and endowed with immortal fate, easily attained enlightenment. After but ten years of cultivation he had clarified his mind and nature. Later, on Mount Shaoshi in Henan, he attained the Way, guided by the stars of Venus to ascend to Heaven and pay homage to the Jade Emperor, before returning to his post. This story is that which is known in the world as Han Xiangzi’s ninefold encounters with Duke Wen. Enough said.

As for Xiangzi, after liberating Han Yu, he returned to redeem his mother Madam Xu as a terrestrial immortal, thus completing the affairs of his own life. He then returned to Mount Song, to study the profound scriptures and deepen his research. Until the Northern Song, when Wang Yi was saved by Master Iron Crutch and reborn into the human world as the brother of Empress Cao, named Da, known as the Cao State Uncle, devoted to cultivation and unattached to the dusty world. Master Iron Crutch asked Lü Zu and Xiangzi to test him once; seeing his steadfastness in the Way, Xiangzi stayed in the Cao State Uncle’s mansion, personally directing his divinations of the Great Way. Hence there arose a curious incident.

What the curious incident was, please see the next chapter unfold.
