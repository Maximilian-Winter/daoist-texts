# Chapter Eight: King Evil Watches the Perfect One's Faults; The Perfect One Returns the Merchant's Bright Pearl

Now it happened that the Perfect One Sa departed from the lofty mansion, and wandered everywhere, desiring to save men and benefit things. But King Evil, the Spirit, resolved to repay a former grudge; eastward he went, eastward he pursued; westward he went, westward he pursued; wheresoever there was some fault or offence, he would fall upon him and smite him to death. One day, the Perfect One came to the region of Chenzhou. It was the ninth month of the year, and he saw a woman in the field gathering the green creeping vegetable. What is that creeping green? It is the vegetable called wuqing. The vegetable was thus:

Its root is white, its leaf is green. It is sown in the field, saturated with the rain and dew of heaven, issuing forth from the earth to nourish living men below. It is called wuqing, and also named creeping green. Eaten when hungry, it may fill the belly; chewed when thirsty, it may produce the juices of life. This is originally the vegetable of Zhuge, and not the wildman's celery.

Why is this vegetable also called “Zhuge's vegetable”? In old times when Zhuge set out on his campaigns, wherever his army's carts halted, he caused this vegetable to be sown; hence it is also called the vegetable of Zhuge. Now the Perfect One Sa passed that place, and the woman gathering vegetables was virtuous and modest. Seeing him a wandering Daoist, she asked, “Sir, will you use some wuqing to quench your thirst?” While speaking she took two heads of wuqing in her hand, and respectfully offered them to him. King Evil watched from behind, and said, “Men and women should not hand things to each other; today he deserves a lash of the whip.” The Spirit attendant said, “Hold! Let us see how he conducts himself.”

The Perfect One Sa, seeing the woman offer him the wuqing, quickly said, “Young woman, since you are so kind, lay it on the ground; I will take it myself.” The woman replied, “You, sir, are especially strict in ceremony; others have taken from my hand many thousands of times, yet without a word spoken.” The Perfect One said, “In times of suspicion, one must needs be cautious.” The woman therefore laid the wuqing on the ground; the Perfect One then took some small coins and also laid them down, saying, “Young woman, please accept these copper coins from your humble servant as payment.” The woman said, “Sir, two heads of wuqing do not buy me; today in these fields I have done kindness to many.” The Perfect One said, “Since you will not accept copper coins, your humble servant dares not accept the wuqing.” The woman, seeing his strictness, was compelled to receive the coins. The Perfect One then took one head of wuqing, and said, “Many thanks.” The woman said, “Sir, take both.” The Perfect One said, “One is enough; to take more would injure my modesty.” He took that one, washed it clean in the clear stream, and then ate it. The Spirit attendant, watching, said to King Evil, “A gentleman well versed in propriety, rare indeed! rare indeed!” King Evil said, “This time he escapes the lash; come, follow him and see; surely this time I will strike him to death.”

Now one day the Perfect One came to the borders of Guizhou, a place named Longjin, where there was a great river and a mighty stream. It was thus seen:

Vast and vast the mighty flood, waves upon waves in layers;  
Like Sichuan’s torrent rushing down the gorge,  
Like the Milky Way pouring from the Nine Heavens.  
Deep, fathomless without bottom or end,  
Wide, with eddies swirling and whirling around.  
No sign of midstream to grasp, only the fisherman's song heard from the opposite bank.

Calling out to the boatman, none appeared ahead or behind; looking upon the broad river’s might, to the left there was no way, and to the right no way. Truly it was:

Before the shallows swift waters murmur down,  
Waves lash the fisher’s reef with flying white foam.  
At dusk beside the river no inn to lodge,  
Calling the boatman standing at the sandy ford.

The sky was already darkening, and on this side there was no inn; he wished to cross to the other side, yet no ferry-boat was seen. The Perfect One searched left and right, and saw a ferry-boat moored among the willows. The ferryman feared that men would use the boat improperly or cross confusedly, so he kept it tied fast in the drooping willows afar off. The Perfect One, being without resource, had no choice but to get upon the boat, untied the willows, took up a bamboo pole, and pushed the boat out from among the shade of the willows.

King Evil saw this and raised his steel whip, saying, “Taking things without asking the owner, crossing without paying the fare.” He was about to strike him on the head, but the Spirit attendant hastened to stop him, saying, “Do not act rashly. Such a small matter—why strike without cause? Let us see how he fares when he crosses over.” The Perfect One having pushed the boat out, as the water deepened and the waves grew larger, laid down the bamboo pole and took up the oars, exerting strength in rowing several strokes, and so reached the other shore.

This bank still held some willow trees; the Perfect One leapt down from the boat, caught hold of a willow branch, and secured the boat firmly. Then he took some copper coins and placed them in the boat’s hold, bowed in salutation, and departed. The Spirit attendant seeing the Perfect One’s conduct, repeatedly expressed admiration, saying, “He does not disdain the small good; rare indeed! rare indeed!” King Evil said, “Lord Protector, do not praise him so; though he escaped my lash this time, I vow he shall not escape the next.” But of that we shall not here speak.

Now another day the Perfect One was wandering to Yuxi, at the ninth month, when suddenly a violent wind arose. That wind indeed was thus:

It blew straight in my face,  
I could not see it for my eyes;  
Over the river rose waves a thousand zhang high,  
Bamboos bent and broke, ten thousand stalks askew.

Where the wind rose, there fell a great rain. The rain was thus:

With the wind the drops pattered,  
Pouring down as if to fill a basin, without ceasing;  
Streams swelled and flooded the ditches,  
Breaking the leaves of plantain.

The Perfect One was on the road; before him no village, behind no inn, nor a pavilion to rest in; yet there were many places not disagreeable, so he had no choice but to open his rain-veil, to shield from wind and rain. Unexpectedly a gust of wind tore away the rain-veil into the air. Pity the Perfect One, drenched by the rain, water running down his face, his patched garment not a thread dry. King Evil followed, saying, “This time the guardian fortress is blown and rained upon; if he has a heart to curse wind or rain, surely he deserves a lash.” The Spirit attendant said, “Hold! Let us see what he does.” A worthy Perfect One, going through the rain, braving the wind, the heavy rain soaking his head, mud half way up his legs. Truly it was:

At home a thousand days all is well,  
But on the road half a morning is hard.

He did not utter one word of complaint or lamentation; only a company of travelers, some twelve or thirteen, hurried up to him, saying, “Sir, why have you no umbrella?” The Perfect One said, “I had one, but just now the fierce wind tore it away.” One merchant said, “Today's wind is not wind; today's rain is not rain.” Another said, “At this season, such great winds should not be; it should be the clear wind, the fish fry wind, the peach blossom wind.” Another said, “At this season there should not be such heavy rain; it should be the bean sprout rain, the pear blossom rain, the yellow plum rain.” Another said, “If I were a deity, I would suspend Wind Elder who moves the wind, and Rain Master who moves the rain, in midair, and strike each of them a thousand blows.”

See, on the road, there are many tongues, speaking words neither true nor false, nowhere to find one sentence of earnestness. The Perfect One said, “Gentlemen, this is the will of Heaven; do not thus complain and grumble.” One merchant said, “Sir, though you are drenched all over, you are so broad-hearted; you do not think at all of getting the yellow boils.” The Perfect One said, “There is a saying: ‘The yellow boils do not strike the traveler; the phlegm-fire does not harm the laboring man.’ This is of no consequence.” Another said, “If the rain does not cease, I fear you have no change of clothes.” The Perfect One said, “I trust the rain will not last long; today the patched hood is wet through by the rain; tomorrow the sun will dry it; will Heaven ever fail us?” One merchant laughed, “Such a man is an ancient gentleman.”

Though the Perfect One spoke thus, the rain grew heavier. The merchants said, “Sir, the rain grows harder; you proceed slowly, we will go on ahead.” The Perfect One said, “There is no haste; the road ahead also has inns.” So he spoke, and it was as he said. The fierce wind does not last the whole morning; the sudden rain does not last the whole day. By noon the clouds gathered dispersed, and the sun shone brightly overhead. The Perfect One came to a pavilion, took off his patched hood, left on only his short garment, wrung the sleeves to cast off the water, and dried himself in the sun, sitting thereupon and composing a verse:

Sudden rain and fierce wind darken earth and sky,  
A weary traveler on the long road nearly dies.  
Now joy to greet the sun’s warmth shining out,  
Many thanks to Heaven for its protecting grace.

The Spirit attendant, seeing the Perfect One drenched and solitary in the rain, like a drenched cold chicken, his patched hood and whole body wet through, showing not a trace of complaint, and then praising Heaven at the clearing of the mist, sighed and said, “A good man indeed! A good man indeed!” King Evil said, “Lord Protector, Lord Protector, do not praise him so; there will be a fitting time to act; watch and wait, I will surely deal with him.”

One day the Perfect One came again to Yongning Prefecture, to a place called Zhuozhuo Village, where for twenty li there was not a single tree. The mountains had no trees; this is what Mencius meant when he said, “Therefore it is as if they were bare.” Hence the place was named Zhuozhuo Village. The Perfect One came to this place, and suddenly felt a pressing need to relieve himself. This was an urgent matter; how could he endure it? King Evil rejoiced, saying, “The sun shines high; if he still soils the three lights, it will surely cause him to become a ghost under my lash.” The Spirit attendant said, “Let us see how he behaves.”

The Perfect One searched left and right; no privy was to be found, not even a tree; he feared to pollute the three lights in the open. What an upright Perfect One! Having lost his rain-veil to the fierce wind before, now he had a new one. He took it from the midst of the field, opened the rain-veil to shield the sun, and then relieved himself. Afterward, he covered the place thickly with earth, withdrew the rain-veil, then washed himself clean in the stream. He recited several divine spells of “Nine Phoenixes Breaking Defilement,” then a few lines of “Ganluo Dana” and “Ever Pure Ever Clean Heavenly Lord” to dispel the disgust. The Spirit attendant, seeing this, said to King Evil, “This man is careful and cautious in every action; there is no fault to find. Will you still strike him?” King Evil said, “Lord Protector, Lord Protector, not this year, but next year; just wait and see.”

Now the Perfect One again traveled to Ganxing Post, Qujing Prefecture, and suddenly saw beside a crossroad a bright pearl. That pearl was thus:

Bright and clear, round and full,  
Like the brilliant stars Shen and Shang,  
Like the cold shining constellations Kui and Bi.  
Lost from the Red River, symbol of the fish-net;  
Departed from Hepu, returning due to Meng Chang.  
This pearl once hung beneath the chin of the black dragon,  
Once nestled in the belly of the old clam.  
Wei Hui once hung it to light his carriage,  
Wu Zixu carried it through the pass.  
Surely it is round as cinnabar washed in the medicine well,  
Its light like dew gliding across a lotus leaf.  
The serpent reporting to Lord Sui is truly strange,  
The ant boring through Confucius’ hole is indeed grievous.

The Perfect One, seeing this bright and lovely pearl, said, “The bright moon’s pearl, cast aside beside the road; the traveler passing by, is it not meet to look upon it with sword in hand?” He bowed his head, picked it up, wiped off its dust, wrapped it carefully in paper, and hid it in his sleeve. King Evil saw this, raised his steel whip and said to the Spirit attendant, “The Way does not pick up lost things; the old simple customs. The guardian fortress picks up a man’s bright pearl on the road; if he does not smite him to death, when else?” The Spirit attendant hastened to stop him, saying, “How do you know when he picks up this pearl he will not return it to its owner?” King Evil said, “That pearl he has wrapped in paper and put in his sleeve; if he returns it, I only intend to give him a lash.” The Spirit attendant said, “The City God bids me act as Lord Protector; if you recklessly strike and kill a man, I will be your antagonist.” King Evil was helpless and restrained his anger.

The Perfect One had taken this bright pearl, but did not depart; he sat upon a grassy slope waiting for the lost pearl’s owner to come, to restore the pearl to him. Looking left and right, none came; the day was late; he wished to seek lodgings at an inn, yet feared the lost pearl’s owner might arrive. This was a crossroads, and he knew not whence the owner came or whither he went. In some embarrassment, he had no choice but to sit on the grassy slope and spend the night.

Now the owner of the lost pearl was a merchant from Jiangxi, who, having journeyed to Guangdong, had gathered five or six hundred taels of silver. Seeing this pearl, he had paid five hundred taels of silver for it, and took a hundred taels as expenses, intending straightway to go sell it in Yunnan Province. But the journey was long and the days many; the pearl pouch was hung at his breast and never taken down day or night; unwittingly, the cords frayed. The pouch having frayed, and the pearl being smooth and slippery, it slipped out and fell on the road.

The merchant traveled half a day, unaware; at dusk he lodged at an inn, set down his bag, and bought two jars of wine to ease his weary feet. After drinking he untied the pouch at his breast, and looked for the pearl; yet the bright pearl had vanished as if into thin air! The merchant burst into loud weeping. The innkeepers were alarmed and said, “Guest, since you have a drinking fit, you should have limited yourself to one jar; why did you drink two?” The merchant said, “Host, it is no drinking fit; my clothing is on that pearl, my food is on that pearl, the wife I took is on that pearl, the fields I bought are on that pearl, the houses I built are on that pearl. Now that pearl is lost.”

The innkeeper said, “Guest, how can your pig marry a wife? How buy fields? How build houses? Such things done? Just the other day I slaughtered a big pig worth only one or two or three taels of silver; not enough to make a garment; so I sold a little pig to make up the difference.” The merchant said, “My pearl walks away.” The innkeeper said, “I understand; is there a pig that does not walk? Just the other day, when I let my pig out of the pen, it ran three or four li; I had to hire strong men to catch it.” The merchant said, “I do not raise pigs; I have lost a bright pearl.” The innkeeper said, “That is a treasure; you are not careful.” The merchant said, “Host, I entrust my bag to you; I will set out at once to seek it on the old road.” The innkeeper said, “Guest, you know not the matter. This place is deep mountains thick forest; snakes and worms many; tigers many; mountain spirits, goblins, and ghosts many. If you go alone by night, you will be bitten by snakes or mauled by tigers; or else tormented by ghosts; I fear you lack ten lives. If you die tomorrow, then you will trouble my inn; do not promise, do not promise.”

The merchant was without recourse, and waited for dawn to travel. That night, sitting wide awake, with myriad sorrows, he murmured the name of the pearl, and thought on the pearl. Truly it was:

Joy grieves that night is short,  
Loneliness laments that it is long.

Suddenly he heard from the woodcutter’s lodge, the beating of the dawn drum, the crowing of cock and fluttering of wings, the chirping and cawing. The merchant took leave of the innkeeper, saying, “Host, guard my luggage; I go forth to seek my pearl.” The innkeeper said, “The time is not yet late.” The merchant said, “The day is about to break.” He then left the inn.

The waning moon had not yet set, the morning stars shone bright. The merchant sought the old road, passing a long pavilion and then a short pavilion; along the way he wailed and wept, asking all he met, “Yesterday on this road I lost a bright pearl; if any man find it and sell it, I am willing to share the price with him.” They replied, “Lost yesterday, sought today; where is such a good bodhisattva to restore it to you?”

Hearing this, the merchant was more troubled. Toward midday he came near Ganxing Post. The Perfect One sat upon the grassy slope, and saw a man hurrying, his breath labored and erratic, tears streaming down his cheeks; truly a pitiable sight. The Perfect One hurried to ask, “Sir, are you not the one who lost a pearl yesterday?” The merchant answered, “It is I. Yesterday I lost a bright pearl; I know not who found it. If any one, out of kindness, restores it, I am willing to share the price.” The Perfect One said, “You, a merchant, are careful indeed. Yesterday at noon I found this pearl, waited half a day for you, saw you not come; at night I sat here another night, waiting for you till today.” He took from his sleeve the original pearl, and said, “Is this the pearl?”

The merchant, from sorrow turning to joy, from worry to gladness, said, “This is the pearl indeed.” The Perfect One generously restored it. The merchant said, “Rare indeed, sir, your good heart. Come with me to sell this pearl, and we shall share the price.” The Perfect One said, “Well said; as a man of the Way I take no coin.” The merchant said, “Rare indeed your kindness; you waited a day and a night, and do not claim my pearl’s price; please accept my bow.” The Perfect One said, “No need. If you bow low to me, I will kneel down to you; a mutual bow will suffice.” The merchant and the Perfect One took leave with mutual gratitude. The merchant journeyed southward; the Perfect One looked westward and went on. Here the story pauses.

The Spirit attendant, watching from on high, repeatedly expressed admiration, saying, “This Master Sa must be Confucius reborn, Shakyamuni Buddha reincarnate; else whence comes such good heart? Deities are few as he. A good man! A good man!” King Evil, seeing the Spirit attendant so admiring, said, “Lord Protector, Lord Protector, I and you have but nine years with him, three years left. These three years watch him well, and see if he deserves death or not!”

But what thereafter King Evil did to him, we shall hear in due course.
