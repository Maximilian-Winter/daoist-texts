# Chapter Twelve: The Yin Court Establishes the Platform of Rewarding Good Deeds; The Perfected Ones Tour the Offices of Goodness

Now it happened that the Perfected One passed over the ridge of desolation and looked ahead; there he saw a grand gate, above the gate-house an inscription bore the four characters, "Platform of Rewarding Good Deeds." The platform itself was a palace of jade and crystal, with turquoise tiles in varied array. On either side of the two stairways were ranged eight palaces; at the portal of each palace was a vermilion tablet with words in gold. On the first tablet was written the four characters, "Mansion of Devoted Filial Piety."

The Judge led the Perfected One within. There were banners of many colours, scarlet poles, immortal music sounding clear and resonant, auspicious vapours flitting in profusion, fragrant odours rich and rare; one might have said it was a celestial abode of the immortals. The Judge, with the Perfected One, went to the hall of the mansion and summoned forth several persons to meet them. They came forth, each wearing the coronet of Heaven-reaching rank, garments of cloud brocade, and shoes of pearls. After the greetings were performed, the guests and host took their places, and conversation passed with the offering of tea. The Judge said, "This is Master Sa; he is a man of the yang world, who has registered his name as a Perfected One, and by reason of roaming the netherworld has come today specially to pay his respects." They said, "We are much honoured by your gracious presence." The Judge asked, "Master Sa, can you recognise these gentlemen?" The Perfected One replied, "I have not had the honour of acquaintance with them."

The Judge said, "Each of these is a gentleman of devoted filial piety. This one is surnamed Meng, his proper name is Zong. His mother was ill; in the winter month she longed for bamboo shoots in soup; he embraced a bamboo and wept; the shoots then grew; afterwards the court honoured him as Grand Master of Splendid Happiness. This one is surnamed Jiang, proper name Shi; devoted to his mother with utmost filial piety. His mother loved to drink river water and to eat fish sashimi; near their dwelling there suddenly gushed a spring, tasting like river water; every day two carp leapt forth, which he took to supply his mother; afterwards he was honoured at court as Vice Director of the Central Secretariat. Another is surnamed Huang, proper name Xiang; at nine years old he fanned his mother’s pillow in summer and warmed her quilt in winter; afterwards honoured by the court as Grand Master of the Imperial Censorate. The others likewise are all filial sons, and are all within this Mansion of Devoted Filial Piety."

The Perfected One courteously bowed several times, then asked, "Since all these are filial sons, why do they not return to life and be born again?" The Judge said, "Those within the Platform of Rewarding Good Deeds all possess the correct vital energy of Heaven and Earth, without end or cessation. Whenever a sage ruler brings order to the world, they are born as kings, marquises, generals, or ministers, and their fame endures through a hundred generations. If no sage ruler appears to govern, they enjoy peace in the Yin Court, silently receiving Heaven’s blessings." The Perfected One said, "Such are the honoured filial sons." Then he took his leave and went on.

He came to the second palace; upon the vermilion tablet were the four characters, "Mansion of Brotherly Duty." Judge Cui led the Perfected One within, following the same ceremonial procession, the same immortal music, the same celestial flowers; and there were several in the same coronets of Heaven-reaching rank, cloud brocade garments, and pearl shoes. After the greetings, the Judge asked the Perfected One, "Can you recognise these Perfected Ones?" The Perfected One replied, "My eyes are dim and I fail to recognise them." The Judge said, "These are all gentlemen who have performed kindly to their elder brothers. Listen while I briefly relate their stories. This one is surnamed Jiang, proper name Gun. His younger brother was named Ji Jiang; once in the wilderness they met thieves, and the brothers strove to die for each other; the robbers let them go. They had often shared the same quilt. Another is surnamed Yu, proper name Gun. A great plague came upon his family; the eldest brother died of illness; the next brother was also at the point of death; the family fled to avoid the pestilence, but Gun alone stayed to care for his brother, not leaving him. Afterwards the second brother was stricken with the plague, but Gun himself was unharmed. The elders all said, ‘Only when the year grows cold do we know that pine and cypress are the last to wither.’ Another is surnamed Tian, proper name Zhen; this was the youngest brother, named Shi Guang. Another was the youngest brother, proper name Qing. Their family debated dividing their property; there was a purple-rimmed tree in the courtyard, which they wished to cut down and divide into three trees. One night it suddenly withered and died. The virtuous brothers embraced the tree and wept, saying, ‘Plants and trees have no feelings, yet they do not wish to be torn apart; how much less should men?’ The virtuous brothers then ceased dividing, and the purple-rimmed tree flourished again. The others are for the most part all men who have fulfilled the Way of Brotherly Duty." The Perfected One bowed and retired.

Then they entered the third palace; the vermilion tablet bore the four characters, "Mansion of Loyalty and Integrity." Judge Cui and the Perfected One entered within, with the same ceremonial procession; there were several wearing coronets of Heaven-reaching rank, cloud brocade garments, and pearl shoes, who saluted together with Judge Cui. The Judge said, "These are all loyal ministers and brave men who have forgotten their families for the state; Perfected One, can you recognise them?" The Perfected One said, "I know a few of them. Are those two the venerable Lords Zhou Han Ya Fu and Ma Fu Bo?" The Judge said, "Yes." The Perfected One added, "Are those two Lords Zhang Sui Yang and Yan Ping Yuan of the Tang?" The Judge said, "Yes." The Judge then asked how the Perfected One knew these four. The Perfected One said, "In the yang world, when I wandered to various shrines of meritorious officials, I saw statues resembling these four venerable Lords." The Judge said, "The others are all men of loyalty and righteousness, and all are in this Mansion of Loyalty and Integrity." The Perfected One said, "So these venerable Lords still enjoy peace in the Yin Court. 'Snow and frost for a myriad li, the solitary old minister; the noble spirit remains for a thousand years in its perfect completeness.' Truly! Truly so!" Then they took their leave.

Next they came to the fourth palace; the vermilion tablet bore the four characters, "Mansion of Faithfulness and Sincerity." Judge Cui led the Perfected One inside; with the same ceremonial procession, they saw several gentlemen in their usual coronets and robes; after salutations, the Judge said, "These are all gentlemen who take truth as truth, who keep faith; Perfected One, do you recognise them?" The Perfected One said, "I do not know them." The Judge said, "Let me tell you briefly of a few. This one is surnamed Zhu, proper name Hui; he was faithful to his friends and to the urgent needs of the friends of his friends; he rose to the office of Left Deputy Minister of the Department of State Affairs. Another is surnamed Fan, styled Ju Qing; he never failed a promise of chicken and millet, even over a thousand li. Another is surnamed Deng, proper name Shu Tong; he was betrothed to a daughter of the Xia family, who was dumb by illness. Some advised him to seek another marriage, but he said, 'The betrothal has been made; to abandon it, what faith is that?' and took no other wife. The others are all men who speak with faith and are earnest, all within this Mansion of Faithfulness and Sincerity." The Perfected One took his leave.

They came to the fifth palace; the vermilion tablet bore the four characters, "Mansion of Careful Propriety." Judge Cui led the Perfected One within; the same ceremonial procession, the same sight of gentlemen in their coronets and robes; after salutations, the Judge asked, "Perfected One, do you know these venerable Lords?" The Perfected One said, "I have not had the honour of acquaintance." The Judge said, "These are all gentlemen modest, humble, obedient, and observing propriety. Let me briefly relate some stories. This one is a gentleman of Lu, named Chi; at seventy years of age he dared not fail in courtesy. He once said, 'A gentleman loves courtesy to perfect his name; a mean man learns courtesy only to avoid punishment.' The Duke of Lu annually bestowed ten thousand strings of cash upon him. Another is surnamed Wang, proper name Zhen; he died at sixty-four; the Lord of the Netherworld, pleased with his humility and virtue, added ten years to his life, so that he lived to seventy-six. Another is surnamed Di, proper name Qing Chen; as a guest he drank to excess and cursed loudly; once he took a cup and threw it at his face; he humbly begged pardon, observed propriety, and became even more courteous; he rose to the office of Privy Councillor. The others are all respectful and courteous, all in this Mansion of Careful Propriety." The Perfected One said, "'Modesty brings benefit; fullness invites loss.' So it is fitting. These worthy gentlemen enjoy peace in the Yin Court."

They came to the sixth palace; the vermilion tablet bore the characters, "Mansion of Esteeming Righteousness." The same ceremonial procession; several gentlemen in their usual coronets and robes were seen; after salutations, the Judge asked, "Perfected One, can you recognise these?" The Perfected One said, "I fail to recognise them." The Judge said, "These are all gentlemen who value righteousness as a mountain. Let me briefly relate some. This one is surnamed Wu, proper name Da Zhi. When his sister-in-law died, she sold herself to provide a burial; the brother and his wife sold themselves to others, selling ten acres of land to redeem her. The Gao Emperor of Qi, hearing of his uprightness, bestowed upon him two hundred acres of land. This one is surnamed Zhang, proper name Gong Yi; he once wrote the character for 'endure' a hundred times; nine generations dwelt together. Another was Chen Yi Men of Jiangzhou, also nine generations dwelling together; their hundred dogs ate in the same kennel; if one dog was absent, the hundred would not eat. The Southern Tang called them the Righteous Gate. The others are all gentlemen who prize righteousness, all in this Mansion of Upholding Righteousness." The Perfected One said, "'The world is full of greedy men; how many prize righteousness over riches?' These venerable Lords belong in this Mansion of Upholding Righteousness."

The seventh palace bore upon its vermilion tablet the four characters, "Mansion of Purity and Integrity." Judge Cui led the Perfected One within; the same ceremonial procession; several gentlemen in their coronets and robes; after salutations, the Judge asked, "Perfected One, can you recognise these venerable Lords?" The Perfected One said, "I dare not deceive; this time I somewhat recognise a few." The Judge asked, "Which ones do you recognise?" The Perfected One said, "There is the scholar Li, proper name Ben. He kept himself pure and bright; sent as envoy to the Turks, he died on the way, with naught but a woollen cloak. There is a poem: 'Covering oneself, only the Qianlou cloak; the purse is sure to have no Lu Jia's gold.' Another is Deputy Envoy Sun, proper name Heng; all his life cared not for possessions, only a single copy of the Jingbian at his desk. At his death, he left no money or cloth to his descendants. Another is Lord Zhao Gui, Prefect of Qi Prefecture; when entering court, the elders sent him off saying, 'You are as pure as water; please accept a cup of water as a send-off.' Do I truly know these venerable Lords?" The Judge said, "Yes. But there is also the former Han Lord Yang Zhen, Governor of Zhuo Commandery, who at night declined a gift of gold. Another is the later Han Lord Liu Chong, Governor of Kuaiji, who was recalled and accepted only one cash. Yet another is Jin Lord Deng Shuo, Governor of Wu Shao, who drank only water from the Wu River. You do not yet know all of them." The Perfected One said, "Former dynasty men, I truly have not yet known." The Judge said, "Come, let us go see the eighth palace."

There on the vermilion tablet were the four characters, "Mansion of Pure Shame." The Perfected One followed the Judge within; the same ceremonial procession; several gentlemen in their usual coronets and robes; after salutations, the Judge asked, "Perfected One, can you recognise these venerable Lords?" The Perfected One said, "Here I somewhat recognise one or two. There is Lord Wu Bo Cheng, an Imperial Censor who tried cases; his virtue extended to others; a man once thanked him with a bar of gold; Lord Wu said, 'Take it quickly; do not shame my eyes.' Another was Lord Wang, Privy Councillor, proper name Pu; once holding a baton to inspect customs, a county official offered him gold; Lord Wang said, 'Do you love me, or do you shame me?' and firmly refused to accept it." The Perfected One recognised these two, and asked Judge Cui, "Sir, may I believe these venerable Lords are genuine?" The Judge said, "They are. But the one before is Scholar Guan, who was ashamed of the stain of fine garments upon his person and wore plain clothes all his life; the one on the left is Inspector Feng, who was ashamed of the dirt on his carriage’s feet and walked on foot; on the right is Privy Councillor Fan, ashamed of the stain of a grand hall, he dwelt in a rustic dwelling. You have yet to recognise them." The Perfected One said, "That was a different time, this is a different time. These all belong to the Han and Tang dynasties; I truly have not known them." Then they took their leave.

The Judge said, "Having seen all these immortal mansions, let us and the Perfected One return to the Platform of Punishing Evil Deeds to have a look." The Perfected One said, "What is the Platform of Punishing Evil Deeds like?" The Judge said, "It also has eight offices, according to the eight types of evil: unfilialness, lack of brotherly duty, disloyalty, unfaithfulness, rudeness, unrighteousness, lack of integrity, and shamelessness; all are first-class evildoers, and there they endure confinement." The Perfected One said, "Since they are evildoers, best not to look upon them; as the ancients said, ‘Seeing good is as though falling short; seeing evil is like handling boiling water.’ Why look at them?" The Judge said, "Come with me to the gates of hell and see for yourself, what say you?" The Perfected One asked, "How many layers has hell?" The Judge replied, "Eighteen divisions in number, but in total but nine layers."

Thus the Perfected One beheld the underworld; the rest will be unfolded in the next chapter.
