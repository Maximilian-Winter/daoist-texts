# Chapter Thirteen: The Immortal Sa Tours the Hells; Marshal Guan Guides the Immortal Back

It is said that Officer Cui conducted the Immortal to the Hell of Yin Mountain, with King Shanhou following. When they arrived at Yin Mountain, the scene was unlike any other. The sunlight was dim and cold winds blew fiercely. All around were walls of iron and cities of bronze, before which stood a gate. The gate was forged of molten iron, and upon it hung a black tablet, on which were inscribed four large white characters: "Gate of Universal Plunder." The officer approached the gate and called out, "Open the gate."

Before his words were finished, two little devils appeared from either side, both with ox heads and nightmarish forms, crying aloud, "Tut-tut." They opened the gate and, startled, said, "By the workings of fate today, only this Daoist ghost has arrived; where is there much money for me?" The yaksha answered, "That Daoist is not the chief matter; rather, the great ghosts on this side are fiercer than I." The officer shouted, "Nonsense! He is a living man, and that Divine Daoist is his subordinate. Now that we are in the netherworld, Lord Yan has commanded me to lead him on a tour; who dares speak otherwise?" Hearing this, none of the yakshas dared utter a word.

The officer led the Immortal inside to the first circle of Hell, above whose gate hung a tablet inscribed with four great characters: "Prison of Wind and Thunder." The Immortal approached a small gate and looked within, seeing there a bronze pillar standing upright, to which a guilty man was bound. Around the pillar was set a great bronze ring, on which were fixed short, sharp blades. A little demon lashed the ring with a whip, and the winds roared in response, the ring turning swiftly. The ring pressed close to the man’s body; with knives fixed thereon, it turned and cut deep and swiftly. In a moment, with a thunderclap beneath, the man was beaten to pieces! After the man’s death, the demon lashed the ring again, this time with a whip that made the thunder cease and the winds calm. Slowly a whirlpool of wind on the ground rotated left and right, gathering the remaining bones and fragments, restoring the man to his original form. The Immortal asked, "Sir Cui, what is this thunder? And what is this wind?" The officer replied, "The thunder is called the Black Heaven Thunder; the wind is called the Wind of Resentful Karma." The Immortal inquired, "Who are these men?" The officer said, "All are those in the living world who committed the ten unpardonable sins; they must pass through this prison of wind and thunder."

Soon they came to the second circle of Hell, where the tablet upon the gate read "Prison of Vajra." The Immortal entered and looked around. On the ground was a coarse stone mill, about eight feet in diameter, square in form. Around it sat eight great demons, one holding an iron hammer with both hands, and four others standing at the four sides. Each of these four seized a man, kicking him onto the millstone, where the eight demons struck him simultaneously with eight hammers, smashing the man to a pulp, like a flattened persimmon cake. One was kicked, then beaten; beaten, then kicked. When the punishment was nearly done, a little demon said, "Though he is now made into a cake, he must still be ground to suffer again." The four great demons took each cake and placed it upon the embers, scorching it. Yet the man was restored again, once more a man. The Immortal’s heart was chilled, and he said, "Sir Cui, that gate is truly terrifying." The officer said, "Have you not heard, 'The human heart is like iron, yet not iron; the law of officials is like a furnace, yet not a furnace'?"

Next they came to the third circle, where the tablet read "Prison of the Fire Chariot." The Immortal entered and looked in. There he saw a wheel laden with several men. The little demons gave a whistle, and the wheel sped forth. The demons breathed on it, and flames burst forth beneath. The wheel moved swiftly, the fire burned fiercely, and in a moment a man was charred to a coal. Yet he was taken back, sprinkled with a few drops of cool water, and was again restored to a man. The Immortal asked, "That fiery wheel is so cruel; how is it that those consumed by fire are restored again?" The officer answered, "Such is the entanglement of resentful karma through hundreds of thousands of kalpas."

They progressed to the fourth circle, whose tablet read "Prison of the Dark Pool." The Immortal looked in and saw a clear round pool, with little demons standing on either side crying, "Wa!" Each seized a man and cast him into the pool, where a great catfish opened its broad mouth and swallowed him whole. Another demon cried, "Wa!" and another man was thrown in and swallowed likewise. Ten cast in filled the pool once; when the round was complete, the pool was full of catfish swimming about, appearing as if drunk and sated. The little demons cried, "Wa! Return our original men." With that call, the fish vanished. Then appeared a group of golden-threaded carp, each carrying a man in its mouth; upon a splash they were restored to men once more, soaked and chilled by the water. The Immortal asked, "Are these fish trained?" The officer said, "No; the fish forget death as they swallow their bait; all who do evil are foolish thus."

They next came to the fifth circle, whose tablet read "Prison of the Oily Dragon." The Immortal approached and saw several generals within, and at the tops of pillars hung a dragon upside down. Beneath the pillars were bound guilty men, naked without a shred of cloth. The little demons struck the dragon’s head, and from its mouth oozed boiling oil, pouring upon the men’s heads. Their skin split, their flesh fell away, until only bare bones remained. When it came to the bones, the demons poured a pail of cold water over them, and the men were restored again. The Immortal said, "A most cruel prison of the oily dragon!" The officer replied, "Evil done is recompensed by Heaven’s clear justice; when the time comes, there is no freedom."

Then to the sixth circle, where the tablet read "Prison of the Venomous Pit." The Immortal looked at the small gate and saw within a deep earthen pit, filled with poisonous snakes, venomous scorpions, and black centipedes. The little demons seized guilty men and cast them into the pit, where the venomous creatures hissed and gathered about—those that eat flesh ate flesh, those that gnaw skin gnawed skin, those that suck blood sucked blood—until no human shape remained. Another man was seized and cast in, and again the venomous creatures tore and devoured. Many were seized and cast in, until at last a little demon cried, "Come up." Holding a small flute, he blew a note, and lo, the men emerged—skin torn, flesh mangled, bodies mangled—who could but cry out in pain? The Immortal asked, "Whence come these evil creatures in the pit?" The officer said, "They are born of Heaven and Earth alike." The Immortal said, "A cruel torment indeed." The officer replied, "As the saying goes, 'Evil men have evil to grind them; when they meet their match, what can they do?'"

The seventh circle’s tablet read "Prison of Pestle and Mortar." The Immortal approached and looked in. There stood a great mortar about ten feet wide, with four little demons surrounding it. One held a great pestle, and as a guilty man was cast into the mortar, all struck in unison. In a moment, the man was beaten to a pulp like crushed garlic, formed into a large lump and placed upon the rack of returning souls. Several were thus pulverized and formed into lumps, all placed upon the rack. At the last, the rack gave a sound, and the man was restored once more—yet no longer flesh and skin, but a pitiful sight.

The eighth circle’s tablet read "Prison of Knives and Saws." The Immortal approached and looked in. Within the small gate was a pair of wooden boards clasping a guilty man, male or female. A group of little demons held a saw, cutting from head to foot, tearing skin and flesh. Some were cut in halves, some in thirds, some in quarters. When the punishment was done, a little demon dusted each one with a broom; each was restored—man remained man, woman remained woman. The Immortal said, "Cruel indeed, pitiful indeed; let us away." The officer said, "There is yet another prison; better see it through."

They came to the ninth circle, where the tablet read "Prison of Boiling Cauldron." The Immortal approached and looked in. There stood a huge copper cauldron, blazing with fierce flames. A group of little demons seized a man, cut a piece of flesh from his left side, and cast it into the pot to fry; another piece from the right side was boiled. The flesh was peeled back to muscle, muscle to sinew, sinew to bone, all boiled and fried into a pot of fat. The man’s bones, heart, and entrails were cast in, boiling into a thick stew. Several demons ladled the broth, and with a bowl of water the man was restored once more. The Immortal’s heart trembled with fear and dread, and Officer Cui hastened to lead him away.

They next came to the City of Wrongful Death. The officer went before, the Immortal followed, and King Shan accompanied them. They had not gone half a mile when they arrived at the city. Two or three resentful ghosts seized the Immortal, saying, "Sa Shoujian, you once wielded your pen and sword to entrap and kill us; we have awaited your coming." Before they finished speaking, three or four other ghosts of wrongful death came cackling, saying, "Good, good, Sa Shoujian is here." The ghosts gathered in groups and struck the Immortal, but Officer Cui quickly shouted, "I am here; no rudeness is allowed." King Shan raised his whip and shouted, "Who dares strike my Immortal?" The ghosts dared not move.

There was among them a master of wrongful death, aged perhaps eighty or ninety, who, hearing the commotion, came forth and commanded, "You ghosts, cease your quarrelling." The ghosts said, "Master, you do not know: this man is from Xihe of Shu, our fellow townsman. Formerly he was an official who wielded pen and sword to instigate litigation and entrap us to death. Today, seeing him, we hate him as one would hate a gentleman." Others said, "Later he practiced medicine carelessly, poisoning us to death. Today, seeing him, we say no poison is mightier than this man." The master asked hurriedly, "What is his name?" The ghosts replied, "His name is Sa Shoujian."

The master immediately bowed low, tears flowing, saying, "This is my benefactor." The Immortal knew not the reason. The master said, "I am but an old man, Zheng Deweng, once dead in Xipu. By his grace I was buried and interred; my grandson was rescued; my daughter-in-law was saved. I did not expect to see this day." The ghosts, seeing their master thus bowed, were all amazed, but said, "Today we cannot grant this kindness; we only want our lives restored." The Immortal said, "I have come to seek the release of the souls of wrongful death, to petition Lord Yan for your salvation. Fortunate is it that Officer Cui is here to bear witness." The officer said, "I hold the register of life and death; it is by my hand that rebirth is recorded. I will now record your reincarnation." The ghosts said, "Though the officer is willing to register our rebirth, the other underlings demand much money and favours; even the auditing officers demand bribes."

The master said, "If so, I recently performed merit-making at home and was appointed by Lord Yan as the lord of the City of Wrongful Death. I have some money here in two tallies; you ghosts may carry these and divide them. I thus offer a small token of thanks to the Immortal." The Immortal said, "Since there is no money with me, I would rather restore the lives of the resentful ghosts than accept such a gift." The officer said, "That is no matter; you can remit the money to the master back in the living world." The Immortal said, "If so, I only borrow it for now; it is acceptable." The master then called the wrongful death ghosts to carry two bundles of yellow money. They brought them swiftly. The Immortal again and again entreated Officer Cui to carefully register the release of these souls; this was beyond question.

Meanwhile, a group of boy and girl ghosts, some fifty or sixty, seeing King Shan, ran forward, saying: "This is the God of Guangfu. In former years he demanded our sacrifice, causing us to die young; today we will not let him go." They seized him, beating and cursing, demanding his life. At this time the officer tried to dissuade them, the master too, and the Immortal repeatedly entreated, saying, "Children, do not pull and tear. This is the officer; I have asked him to register your release." The little spirits were without respect and would not heed. They pulled and dragged, determined to take him to Lord Yan.

The officer and Master Zheng were at a loss as to the cause. The Immortal said, "This man is named Wang Shan, who was formerly the god of the Guangfu Temple, demanding boy and girl sacrifices yearly. I destroyed his sacrifices and his temple. Now he has reformed and follows me. Today he meets his foes. This is the saying, 'Resentment has its source, debt has its master.' What is to be done?" The officer said, "If so, the god Wang Shan is also a great grudge. The boys and girls pulling him to see Lord Yan will bring many difficulties." The Immortal was helpless and took leave of Master Zheng, following King Shan to seek an accommodation with Lord Yan.

Unbeknownst to them, a fortuitous event occurred on the way. They saw a heavenly deity descend, who cried:

His brows arched like the silkworm’s coil,
His tiger waist measured a zhang in length.
A red steed with a crimson mane bore him on,
And gleaming was his green dragon crescent blade.
Around his waist a belt of jade was bound,
And on his person a robe of scarlet shone.

The Immortal looked and saw it was Marshal Guan. How came Marshal Guan at Fengdu? Because long ago, with Master Zhang Daoling, he was commissioned by a certain official document to be confined permanently in Fengdu. Meeting Master Puan, the document was opened and read, and it was found that Guan Yunchang had himself arranged for his own confinement. Master Puan altered the text to "Eternally guard Fengdu," so that Marshal Guan remained stationed in the kingdom of Fengdu.

Marshal Guan dismounted and saluted the Immortal. The little children, no longer disrespectful, released King Shan to come and see Marshal Guan and then went to admire the red steed with the crimson mane. The officer said, "Immortal, it is better to entrust Marshal Guan to escort you out of this netherworld and away from the clinging children." The marshal nodded once, did not mount his horse, but walked forward. The Immortal bade farewell to the officer and, following King Shan, went out with Marshal Guan. After a few steps, the Immortal turned to the officer and said, "Sir Cui, I beg you to pay many respects to Lord Yan for me, and especially to secure the release of these children." The officer replied, "Nothing could be more dutiful."

The children looked back and saw King Shan depart. They sought to pursue but could not catch up, and so wept in groups of twos and threes. The officer said, "Children, do not weep. I will take you to King Yama to arrange your rebirth." So the boys and girls followed the officer. Marshal Guan guided the Immortal and King Shan along the direct road through Yin Mountain. They saw thousands of resentful ghosts all saying, "Immortal, Immortal, now that you have toured the netherworld, when you return to the living world, please hold a great offering to universally save us wandering souls." The Immortal promised and went on.

After some miles they passed beyond Yin Mountain. Here the cold wind blew fiercely and the darkness was profound. Marshal Guan illuminated the nether path with the shining tip of his blade and went on for several miles more. Suddenly the darkness cleared, and the marshal said to the Immortal, "This is the boundary between Yin and Yang; I cannot accompany you further." They took leave of each other.

The Immortal then returned to the living world with King Shan and directly established a Daoist altar of salvation and deliverance in Xihe. We shall see what follows in the next chapter.
