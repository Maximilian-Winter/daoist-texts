# Chapter the Third: Receiving the Heavenly Mandate, Crossing East to Save the World, Entering the Earthly Path, Concealing Himself in Zhongnan

The ways of the world are scorching and chill beyond compare;  
Men contend for fame and seize for gain, filling the dusty world.  

Living beings delight in saving others, but are themselves hard to save;  
Wishing to save all living beings, yet none are saved.  

It is told that Wang Xiaolian was originally a man without illness; only he feigned sickness, desiring to cut off disturbance, and to awaken to the profound art. Master Zhang Haiqing, how did he know his deep intent? He examined left and right, but could not discern any disease; he could only follow the common voice and say, “Truly it is a stroke that renders him speechless.” Then he took paper and brush, and wrote a prescription — nothing more than three qian of chuanxiong and half a liang of fangfeng. After finishing, he conversed with the people a little, drank a cup of fragrant tea, then received the gifts of thanks, and each went their way. When the Master departed, the friends also said to Wang Wuju, “Xiaolian Gong, take care; we are going back, and will come again another day to see you.” Wang Wuju nodded his head slightly, and the friends dispersed.  

After the guests had gone, Madam Zhou called her son Qiulang and Yuwa to the western village pharmacy to fetch the medicine; they boiled it in a jar and poured it into a bowl, which Qiulang carried with both hands into the study. Just as he called out, “Father, here is your medicine,” the father opened both eyes widely, and struck hard with his foot; frightened, Qiulang quickly set down the bowl and ran outside, unwilling to come again even when called twice. After Qiulang had gone, Wang Xiaolian secretly poured the medicine in a quiet place. From then on, only Yuwa entered and exited, offering tea and water; as for the serving maids, none dared approach his door, for if he saw them he would beat his chest and stamp his feet, and so they feared to come. Even Madam Zhou, out of conjugal affection, came in to see him, but he was unwilling. Since his feigned stroke, all affairs within and without were managed by her alone; she often came to ask after him in his solitude. Twice kinsfolk and friends came to visit and seeing his condition, did not come again. Thus all said, “A fine Wang Wuju, alas stricken with a grievous malady.” With these words, he was left in cold neglect, quiet and alone, meditating on the Way and cultivating truth in his study, practising sitting meditation thus for twelve years, the Great Elixir perfected.  

His wife was his utensil, his son his companion;  
Thirst he slaked with tea and broth; hunger he met with food;  
To all appearance like others; who knew he was managing the Way?  

Twelve years’ work completed, the Yang Spirit appeared upon his crown;  
How many cultivators in the world could endure such a course?  

Now Wang Wuju, having perfected the Great Way at home, could send forth his Yang Spirit and multiply his form; he chose for himself a Taoist name, “Chongyang.” That night in the study, sitting in meditation, with not a thought rising, all was silent, when suddenly from the void there came a call: “Wang Chongyang, ascend swiftly to the clouds to receive the edict.” The voice was clear to the ear; Chongyang hurried up into the void, and saw the planet Venus standing upon the cloud-top, proclaiming the Jade Edict. Wang Chongyang knelt to hear the announcement, which ran thus:  

“Remember, Chongyang, your earnest perseverance in cultivation, these twelve years without fault; by decree your Taoist fruit is complete. We specially confer upon you the rank of Enlightened Perfected One; hasten to Shandong to save the world. Promptly cause the Seven Perfections to ascend; when your work is accomplished, further honours will be bestowed upon you, as you desire.”  

When Venus had read the edict, Chongyang bowed thrice in thanks; then greeted the Star Lord. The Star Lord said, “Perfected One, hasten to Shandong to save the world; fear not toil and hardship, lest you fail the Emperor’s heart. One day at the Peach Festival we shall meet again and converse.” Having thus spoken, the Star Lord returned to Heaven’s Palace; Chongyang returned to the study to resume meditation.  

That morning, Yuwa brought water for washing, but found the door unopened; hastily she informed the Queen Mother. Madam Zhou came with two serving maids to the study door, calling loudly, but the door would not open. Thinking Xiaolian must be dead, they forced the door open and entered the study; no one was to be seen. Madam Zhou, both frightened and alarmed, ordered a search in all directions, but found no trace. Madam Zhou wept bitterly, rousing the village people to come inquire; Yuwa told them the whole story, and all said, “This is strange indeed; the door was still latched, yet no one to be found; could he have ascended on clouds or passed through walls?” They went in to look — not a brick or tile was disturbed. The search divided into several parties, but no trace was found. A man versed in the occult remarked, “You need not seek him; I think Wang Xiaolian has surely become an immortal.” The villagers asked in unison, “What makes you think he has become an immortal?” He said, “He sat in this study for twelve years without moving a step, feigning stroke but really transcending dust. I have seen his face radiant with a red glow, his eyes flashing divine light. If not an immortal, how could it be so?” The villagers, half believing, cried aloud, “This means he has surely become an immortal, riding clouds to Heaven.” Hearing this, Madam Zhou’s grief was somewhat lessened, and the people dispersed.  

Further telling of Wang Chongyang on that day, who, borrowing the art of earth escape, vanished from Dawei Village, looking towards Shandong, travelling thousands of li; and there were no Seven Perfections, only two persons; who were those two? One was the person of “Name,” the other the person of “Profit.” Except for these two sorts, there was no other kind. Wang Chongyang, finding none to save, returned to Shaanxi. Arriving beneath Zhongnan, he saw a stretch of earthen hills a hundred li long, serene and lovely; thought to use the art of earth mastery, and to escape into the depths of the earth, to conceal himself and wait till there appeared cultivators in the world, then come forth to save them, not too late. So he formed the hand seal, recited the incantation, and entered the earth. After about half an hour, he arrived at a very deep place; a cave spacious enough to accommodate him. He entered the cave, used mats to lie upon, regulated breath and spirit to preserve his life.  

The great heaven and earth hold but two persons; one named Name, one named Profit, turning the wheel of flux.  

The Seven Perfections unknown where to save; in the earth concealed, awaiting their time.  

Now Wang Chongyang lay hidden in the earth, knowing not the light of day; it seemed nearly half a year, when suddenly he heard a crashing, as if Heaven and Earth were breaking apart. An earth fissure was shaken open, a slit letting in light, above which shone golden radiance — the Master had arrived. Wang Chongyang was greatly startled, hastened through the earth crack, and saw the two Immortals Zhong and Lü, together forming an earth platform. Wang Chongyang prostrated himself, not daring to look up. Master Lü smiled, “Others cultivate the Way to ascend to Heaven; you cultivate the Way to enter the nether world. It seems your course is unlike others, going against Heaven’s heart, contravening the Master’s intent. Is this how one becomes an Immortal?” Chongyang bowed and thanked with humility, saying, “I dare not disobey Heaven’s will or contravene the Master’s teachings. Indeed, there is none in Shandong to save; thus I temporarily conceal myself, waiting until cultivators appear in the world, then to save them is not late.” Master Lü said, “Where are there no cultivators? Only that you have not diligently sought them, hence you cannot find them. For example, when you first sought the Way, you did not have true intent; had not the Patriarch repeatedly appeared to enlighten you, you would have remained merely a filial official, how could you have become a Great Golden Immortal? If you now seek ease and refuse to advance, and say there is none to save in the world, is this not erroneous? If you can use the method I give you to save others, there will be none who cannot be saved. Formerly I, drunken thrice, met a man of Yueyang unknown to me, lightly flying over the Dongting Lake, thinking no one was to be saved in the world. On returning north to Liaoyang, I saw the Jin prime minister, who had the manner of one to be saved; so I personally instructed him. The prime minister laid down office and returned to the mountain to cultivate the Great Way, calling himself ‘Hai Chan.’ Liu Hai Chan followed me south; he saved Zhang Ziyang; Zhang Ziyang saved Shi Xinglin; Shi Xinglin saved Xue Daoguang; Xue Daoguang saved Chen Zhixu; Chen Zhixu saved Bai Ziqing; Bai Ziqing saved Liu Yongnian and Peng Helin. These seven all attained the fruit, and are known as the Southern Seven Perfections. At that time I thought no one was to be saved, who then knew he had saved many! The world is vast, the four seas broad, the subtle principles unbounded, and there are many Perfected Ones; how could there be none to save! Now there are the Northern Seven Perfections — Qiu, Liu, Tan, Ma, Hao, Wang, Sun — who repeatedly entreat you to go and save. It is not that your power is less than that of Hai Chan, but because your heart fears hardship, you are unable to match him.”  

When Master Lü had finished speaking, Chongyang’s mind was enlightened as if a fog were lifted; trembling, he bowed in thanks, sweat running down his spine. Ancestor Zhongli bade him stand by his side and said, “If not for the repeated entreaties of your Master, it would only be because the Peach Festival approaches, when all cultivators and true Immortals of the Way throughout the world assemble. The peach on Kunlun blooms once in a thousand years, bears fruit once in a thousand years, ripens once in a thousand years; in all, three thousand years to complete. The peach is as large as a bushel, red as blazing fire; eating one grants a thousand years of life. The Queen Mother of the West, unwilling to keep it all for herself, desires to share with all Immortals, Buddhas, and divine sages; therefore she holds a gathering called the ‘Assembly of the Multitude of Immortals.’ Each assembly brings new Immortals recently perfected, to lend splendour to the meeting; if only the old Immortals came, and there were none newly cultivating the Way in the world, the Queen Mother would be displeased. In ancient times each assembly had more than a thousand new perfected Immortals; in later times several hundred; today, in this lower world, there are but few. Therefore you are charged to hasten to save the Seven Perfections and attend the Peach Festival, to add your might and brightness. Now the peaches are about to ripen; if you delay and miss this opportunity, you must wait another three thousand years to attend — is this not a pity!”  

These words were clearly and thoroughly spoken. Wang Chongyang again knelt and said, “Hearing the words of the Ancestor, I feel as if awakening from a dream; now I wish to return to Shandong to save and transform; I pray the Ancestor to guide my course.” Ancestor Zhongli said, “The earth is dense and the people numerous; you must be among the thickly populated, mingle with the dust, manifest yourself and expound the Way; then there will be those who seek you, and you may open their minds and achieve great work. On this journey meet Hai and stay, meet Ma and prosper, meet Qiu and stop.” Ancestor Zhongli finished speaking and, together with Master Lü, mounted clouds and departed. Wang Chongyang again turned towards Shandong. One day he came to a county called Ninghai, under the jurisdiction of Dengzhou Prefecture, Shandong. Recalling the words of the Ancestor, “Meet Hai and stay,” might this be the place? Here he stayed, carrying an iron pot, feigning beggary, as Master Lü once taught him to save others. Whether he succeeded in saving others or not, shall be told in the next chapter.  

Mingling with the dust, awaiting the time to come;  
When the time arrives, the fruit of the Way will naturally be complete.
