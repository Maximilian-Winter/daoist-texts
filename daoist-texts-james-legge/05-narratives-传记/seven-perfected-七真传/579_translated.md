# Chapter Eleven: The Heavenly Lord Protects the Dharma in the Hailstorm — The Perfectly Calculating Master Points the Way

For years immersed in mire and ruin,  
The River of Love surges with waves that rise to the sky.  
By cultivation one may ascend to the high shore;  
Why, in midstream, seek another boat?

It is related that Sun Bu’er, having left Ma’s Village, travelled feigning madness for several months until she came to the outskirts of Luoyang city, where there was a broken tile kiln. There she took lodging within the kiln and habitually begged in the county town, appearing as a mad woman completely possessed. This drew children to follow her everywhere, calling her “Mad Old Woman” this and “Mad Old Woman” that, whereby she gained a name. All within the town and countryside knew her to be a madwoman, and so no one came to molest her; thus she was able to carry on her cultivation in peace and to comprehend the Way. This accords with the saying that Master Chongyang hides the Great Way within the words of madness.

Again, in Luoyang County there were two notorious ruffians. One called Zhang San, the other Li Si, who were wont to deceive, rob, and violate without limit. They often saw Sun Bu’er begging on the street; though her face was ugly, her eyes were bright and teeth white; were it not for many scars upon her face, she might have been of no mean ability. These two ruffians took note of her and remembered well.

One night, the moon bright and wind clear, stars studding the sky, the two were returning from the countryside, drunk and fumbling. Near the broken tile kiln, Zhang San said to Li Si, “Let us go and have some sport with that madwoman.” Li Si replied, “No! No! I have heard that if one does aught with a madwoman, a lifetime of ill fortune follows, and one never gains good luck.” Zhang San said, “We are those rejected by heaven and earth; what care have we for good luck or ill luck?” So he heeded not Li Si’s warning and approached the broken tile kiln; Li Si had no choice but to follow.

But after a few steps, suddenly above their heads appeared a black cloud, spreading and loose, darkening heaven and earth, so that one could not see one’s hand before one’s face. A wild wind arose, chilling them to the bone, and a violent rain fell, drumming upon their heads like beating drums, causing their heads to ache. Li Si raised his hand to shield his head, but the rain struck the back of his hand as if iron pellets. He then knew it was no rain, but hail, called “snow pellets” by the people, commonly known as “cold pellets.” These cold pellets beat so fiercely that the two had no way to escape or hide.

Li Si kept saying, “This is just retribution! I told you not to come, but you forced your way here; see now what comes of it!” Zhang San, hearing Li Si’s complaints, grew angry. Suddenly he stepped on a cold pellet; as it was smooth, he could not keep his footing and slipped, tumbling down as if pushed by a hand, stumbling again and again, his head and eyes bruised, flesh torn and blood flowing, crying to heaven. After a while, the clouds parted and the moon appeared, the sky again full of stars. Li Si, though struck by hail, had not stumbled and suffered no great injury; but Zhang San was dazed and dizzy from his falls, only able to stick out his tongue and shake his head, saying, “Amazing! Amazing! This madwoman must not be offended!” Li Si said, “Now you see that she must not be offended; let us see if you dare come here again!” They spoke as they walked, and each returned home.

Li Si recounted these events to the other ruffians, and word spread: one told ten, ten told a hundred; thus those who lived poorly and the beggars dared no longer come to the broken tile kiln. Sun Bu’er remained in Luoyang for twelve years, cultivating and comprehending the Way, never molested by evil men—all thanks to Li Si’s deed!

For those who read thus far, there is a verse of lament:

The Perfected One here attains profound skill,  
How should he let mad ruffians boast their strength?  
When hail descends and strikes with cruel blows,  
Then one knows the Heavenly Lord protects the Dharma.

Master Wang Chongyang dwelt at Ma Yuanwai’s house for more than a year unawares. Outside, several village elders were chatting idly, saying that Ma Yuanwai knew not how to enjoy his blessings, having given away his family wealth to others, causing his wife to go mad and vanish without trace. Among them was a man over fifty named Duan Anren, who said, “Yesterday I went to his village to visit Ma Yuanwai. The gate was unattended, and on entering I saw no women, only men. I asked where Yuanwai was, and they told me he was in the rear thatched hut listening to Master Chongyang expound the Way. I went back and saw many huts built there, and Ma Yuanwai with Master Wang Chongyang sitting in meditation in one of them. Yuanwai seeing me came out and accompanied me to the front hall to talk. I asked after his wife’s whereabouts; Yuanwai said she had her own Way, and he had his wondrous methods. I asked why there were no maidservants or handmaidens; Yuanwai said the men serve to marry, the women serve to wed, each establishing their own households without attachment. I asked why he built these thatched huts; Yuanwai said to gather practitioners to cultivate the Way and nurture the true nature. I asked why Master Chongyang did not come out; Yuanwai said that he loves quietness most and does not mingle with the vulgar.” Having finished questioning Yuanwai, I asked Ma Xing, “Your village was once noisy and bustling; why now is it so quiet, like a monastery?” Ma Xing said, “You do not know, this Master Chongyang is a living immortal who dislikes noise and loves stillness. Since Lady Sun left, he sent away all the maids and servants, leaving only a few of us old folk to guard the place, hence its quietness.” I asked how Ma Xing knew Chongyang to be a living immortal; he said, “All affairs of the house, past and present, no one has to tell him; he knows them all. What is stranger, he also knows future events, when it will be clear or rainy; is he not a living immortal?”

Duan Anren finished telling of Ma’s Village, when among the village elders was an old man named Pan, who said, “If what you say is true, and he knows past and future, we have suffered drought for long without rain; why not ask him when rain will come?” The elders all agreed and went with old Pan to Ma’s Village. First they saw Ma Yuanwai and explained their purpose. Ma Danyang led them to the thatched hut to ask Master Chongyang when rain would fall. The Master said, “At the Earth God’s temple east of your village, the wall is inscribed with the rain schedule; you should go and see, then you will know.” Hearing this, the elders departed and returned to their village. Going east to the Earth God’s temple, before the wall they saw several lines of writing. Old Pan read aloud to the assembly: “Before the Human King a pair of melons, a pearl shines bright upon the King’s house; on the twenty-third day great rain shall fall; the monk’s mouth spits mud.” Below were several small characters that read “broken.” Old Pan laughed, saying, “These are children’s character riddles; what rain schedule is there?” The elders said, “What kind of riddle is this? Can you guess it?” Pan said, “I am used to character riddles; how could I not guess?” The elders said, “If you can guess, pray tell us.” Pan said, “The Human King with added raindrops is the character for gold; adding a dot to the King gives the character for jade palace; ‘twenty-three days great rain’ when gathered together forms the character for fullness; the monk discarded the ‘harmony’ character but kept the ‘still’ character, mud being earth. Adding ‘still’ to earth gives the character for hall; plainly it reads ‘gold and jade fill the hall’—how is this a rain schedule?” Duan Anren stepped forward and pointed to the line “twenty-two one day great rain,” saying, “This plainly is the rain schedule, yet you say there is none; though it be a few mute riddles, there is meaning within. Today is the nineteenth; counting to twenty-two and one is four days; we shall see if it rains on the twenty-third, and so know if he is divine or not.” The elders agreed, and returned to their homes.

On the twenty-third day, black clouds filled the sky, and heavy rain poured from dawn until noon. The villagers then believed in Master Chongyang’s power. Again, a man from the northern village lost a cow and searched everywhere in vain, so he asked the Master. Chongyang said, “The cow is in the crow’s nest upon the tall tree in the southern village.” The man laughed, saying, “The cow is so big, how can it fit in a little crow’s nest?” Chongyang said, “Go and you shall have the cow; no more need be said.” The man left the thatched hut and went to the southern village, where he saw a tall tree with a bird’s nest. Knowing how to climb, the villagers ascended and took the nest, which was empty. Pulling a dead branch caused it to fall and strike his face. Lowering his head, he saw behind a ruined house a cow tethered inside. Upon closer inspection, it was the lost cow. The cow lay in the ruined house, with firewood and grass piled outside to conceal it; but from above one could see it. The man understood that a thief was accustomed to such deeds; but but for the Master’s instruction, he might have been led to sell the cow far away and never find it again. The man took the cow away.

Leaving this matter aside, on that day in the western village several people came to inquire of the Master. Among them was a boy thirteen or fourteen years old, who said his elder brother had been away for months and he did not know when he would return, so he came to ask. Master Chongyang said, “Go ask your mother’s hand.” The boy laughed and could not stop. Soon after returning home, he saw his mother holding a letter, saying, “Your brother is doing business in Laizhou and brought this letter back; the messenger has just left; you may open it and read it to me.” The boy opened the letter and read: “Unworthy son writes to dutiful mother: since father’s death, I have been brought up by mother’s teaching; now fulfilling father’s will, I have gone abroad to trade, and all has gone well. At present the accounts are not fully settled, and I cannot return quickly to comfort mother’s heart; I will come home in the cool of autumn, about the middle of September, to offer service and delicacies.” The boy had not yet finished reading when he clapped his hands and laughed, saying, “So true! So true!” As his mother was about to ask him, five or six people came to the door; what this was about, we shall see in the sequel.

Without the fisherman's guidance, how could one behold the waves?
