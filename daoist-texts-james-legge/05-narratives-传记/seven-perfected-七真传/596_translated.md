# Chapter Twenty-Eight: The Empress Offered the Poisoned Wine to Test the Way; The Real Man Wearing the Golden Crown Sings a Poem

The elixir perfected through nine transformations is pure Yang,  
Entering the sage’s realm, surpassing the mundane, lengthening life’s span.  
If there were not a series of twists and turns,  
How could one’s name be held in eternal acclaim?

It is told that the Empress, having heard the words of the Chan Master Baiyun, commanded her eunuchs to summon the Real Man Qiu from Baiyun Temple, and secretly prepared poisoned wine to await him. The eunuch, having received her command, came to summon the Real Man into the palace. The Real Man, having already divined her intent, before departing, instructed Zhao, Li, and the others to prepare twenty-four vats of cold clear water, arranged in a single file, to await his return, saying: ‘There is a wondrous use for them; do not err and spoil my plan.’ Having thus charged them, he entered the palace with the eunuchs and paid homage to the imperial presence. The Empress said, ‘Previously the Real Man foretold that this Empress would surely bear a Crown Prince, and the event has indeed come to pass. I have no means of rewarding you, so I command three cups of imperial wine to be given in slight token of respect.’ Having spoken, she ordered the eunuchs to bring the wine before the Real Man. Qiu did not refuse, but drank all three cups in succession. After taking leave of the Empress, he returned to Baiyun Temple and saw the twenty-four vats of clear water arranged in a row beneath the gallery. The Real Man then leaped into the first vat, immersing himself in the cold water. Instantly the water heated; rising, he leapt into the second vat, and again the water grew warm. He continued thus, leaping through the vats in succession, until he had entered twenty-three vats. Upon reaching the twenty-fourth vat, which was not yet filled, the water did not rise above his chest, and the poison had not yet been exhausted. The poisonous fire ascended, and the blue hair upon his forehead was burned away to a width of three fingers. From a distance, it appeared as if he had but half a head of hair, like a Taoist in his habit.

Meanwhile, the Chan Master Baiyun, having learned that the Real Man Qiu was not dead, came again to the palace to report to the Empress. The Empress said, ‘He drank the poisoned wine and did not die; surely he is a true immortal.’ Baiyun Chan Master replied, ‘Perhaps the poison in the wine was not strong enough to cause death; this is possible. I have heard that immortals can overcome the five metals and eight stones; all gold, silver, copper, and iron are to them as ordinary earth. They require the appropriate method, the proper circle to be completed. The Taoist order has both caps and crowns: the cap is to cover the hair, the crown to bind it. Now the impostor feigns ignorance, but in sum it is all the same—a cap or crown. Empress, please confer on him a golden crown, bestowing a single ingot of pure gold to be worn upon his head. If he can wear it steadily, then he is indeed an immortal; if he cannot, all will mock him, and he will be ashamed to face men, and will surely retire to the mountains and forests.’ The Empress heard this and was greatly pleased. She again sent eunuchs to Baiyun Temple to summon the Real Man into the palace. The Real Man accompanied the attendants to the imperial court, where the Empress, seeing his bare forehead, asked, ‘Why is there no hair upon your head?’ Qiu the Real Man, calm and unhurried, recited four lines:

Yesterday I received the elixir’s decree and ascended the jade steps,  
The Queen Mother and I feasted in banquet together.  
Drinking thrice the long-life wine,  
I opened the heavenly gate upon my crown.

When Qiu finished speaking, the Empress felt ashamed in her heart. She had not intended to test the Way further, but since she had already promised the Chan Master Baiyun, she smiled and said, ‘You are indeed an immortal, your spiritual power not slight, inspiring reverence. I have a golden crown made by imperial order, which you may wear upon your head to show your gratitude.’ She then commanded the eunuchs to bring a tray of agate holding a single ingot of gold, saying, ‘The Empress bestows this golden crown; please place it upon your head, as a token of thanks.’ The Real Man was already aware. Concealed in his sleeve was a steel needle. Taking the gold with both hands, he employed the True Fire of Samadhi, blowing upon the gold until it became soft as clay. Using the needle, he pierced the gold ingot through, and fastened the ingot upon his hair, lifting a few strands with the needle and inserting it into the golden aperture. The point of the needle grasped several strands before and behind, binding them securely. Thus the ingot of gold was firmly and surely worn upon his head. The Empress, having heard the Chan Master’s words, only wished to mock the Real Man. Who could have known that this would leave a precedent for the Taoist order? The yellow crown worn by Taoist brethren today originated here. Without further mention of this, it is told that having placed the golden crown upon his head and thanked the Empress, the Real Man chanted a couplet:

Often receiving the elixir’s edict and bestowal of favour profound,  
I dare present this poem in homage to my lord.  
The gentleman’s heart knows no cold illness,  
The man’s head is adorned with gold.

When the Real Man finished chanting, the Empress felt uneasy. Rising, she said, ‘I acknowledge my fault! I trust the Real Man does not mind!’ The Real Man replied, ‘It is not your fault, Empress; it is I who have long clung to the noise of the world, thereby invoking demonic obstructions upon myself.’ Before he had finished speaking, the Chan Master Baiyun leapt forth from behind a screen and grasped the Real Man, saying, ‘Qiu Changchun, it is not you who have brought on these demonic hindrances, but this old monk who has caused them upon you.’ The Real Man said, ‘The Chan Master is one who holds the Four Elements all void; how could there be demonic hindrances upon me? It seems truly I have brought this upon myself.’

Entangled in worldly cares and enamoured of the dust,  
Long indulgence in the dust invites demons in.  
Troubles and vexations arise from myself,  
How could another cause my wavering?

At once the Real Man spoke these four lines, attributing blame to himself. Originally the Chan Master Baiyun did not seek trouble; it was the Real Man who secretly swapped dragon for phoenix, winning Baiyun Temple for himself. Hence the obstruction arose, and the Chan Master counselled the Empress to offer wine and bestow a crown to seek revenge. If the Real Man had not taken Baiyun Temple from him, whence would have come this quarrel? Thus the Real Man’s self-blame was a clear conscience. Let later generations not use this victory or defeat as a pretext. The Chan Master heard the Real Man’s self-attribution of blame and likewise regretted his mistaken design. He then casually uttered four lines:

Though having read the Buddha’s sutras, all is empty,  
Why does my mind suddenly grow dim?  
To speak of dragon and phoenix is all in vain,  
In vain the toil of heart and skill misapplied.

The Empress, seeing the Chan Master and the Real Man each take upon themselves the blame and turn back their light, rejoiced greatly in her heart. Just as she was about to offer praise, she heard the report that the Sacred Presence was arriving. She hastened to welcome the august presence into the palace. The Real Man and the Chan Master together came to pay respects. The Sovereign was greatly pleased, saying, ‘I have seen that the two masters were not in accord, and this troubled me. Just now I went to the Western Palace to dispel my vexation, when the attendants reported that the two masters were reconciled. My imperial heart is greatly glad, so I left the Western Palace to join you for a chat.’ The Empress then related to the Sovereign the words of each master taking blame upon himself. The Sovereign was much delighted, saying that the three teachings have no two truths, and that monks and Taoists belong to one family. He then spoke some words of congratulation to the two masters:

One monk and one Taoist dwell in the capital,  
Monk and Taoist were originally one family.  
Henceforth need there be no division of this or that,  
Together accomplish the perfect fruit as Bodhisattvas.

The Real Man and the Chan Master heard these words and together expressed thanks. The Sovereign said to the Chan Master Baiyun, ‘I have already issued imperial funds to the national master for building a new temple. When the works are completed, the Buddha statues of Baiyun Temple may be moved into the newly built temple, which shall receive a new name. Baiyun Temple will be renamed Baiyun Guan, and the image of the Taoist ancestor will be newly fashioned, thus distinguishing monk and Taoist, each having their own sect, for incense offerings through a thousand autumns, and for the gaze of ten thousand generations. This will not fail the service you both have rendered to protect the orphaned dynasty.’ The Real Man and the Chan Master again thanked the Sovereign. The Sovereign commanded officials to arrange a simple feast, and lord and minister rejoiced together. During the feast there were also presentations on the profound Tao and Buddhist Dharma — the Buddha teaches by emptiness, the Tao follows the principle of void. Emptiness is non-being, and void is also non-being. It seems that they are one and the same principle. Soon after the feast ended, the two masters took leave of the Sovereign and each returned to his former place.

It is told also that the monks who came forth from Baiyun Temple took up residence in various monasteries. One day they met by chance and conferred: ‘We have a fine temple, but Qiu Changchun has taken it for himself. Shall we not put an end to this?’ Among them was a meddlesome monk who claimed to understand fengshui, and said, ‘If you heed my advice, we will build a Western Wind Temple before Baiyun Temple, and Baiyun Temple will surely be defeated.’ The monks asked the reason for the defeat. The troublesome monk said: ‘Have you not heard that fengshui fears disruption? With my Western Wind blowing upon Baiyun Temple, what fear is there that it will not fail, that it will not disperse?’ Hearing this, the monks clapped their hands and laughed, calling it a fine idea. They proceeded to make several contracts of alliance. Another monk, skilled in letters, took up the brush and wrote a preface, and together they went to see the Chan Master Baiyun, requesting land and official titles, and relating the intention to blow the Western Wind to disperse Baiyun. The Chan Master laughed and said, ‘Who put you up to this idea?’ The monks pointed to the meddlesome monk and said, ‘It is this exalted Bodhisattva.’ The Chan Master asked him, ‘What is your meaning in starting a Western Wind to disperse Baiyun?’ The monk said, ‘I wish to take revenge upon you, reverend sir.’ The Chan Master said, ‘Since the Buddha opened his teaching, it has only been to cultivate affinities with others, never to form enmities. The monk’s four elements are all void, unstained by a single speck. What enmity is there to repay? Formerly, the Buddha was cut by King Koli, limb by limb, yet our Buddha bore no resentment. Therefore he attained the great hero’s position, neither born nor dying. Only by enduring insult with gentleness can one attain such spiritual powers. Hence our sect’s supreme teaching is emptiness of all things, no self, no other, no voice, no smell. Since there is no self or other, what enmity is there to repay? What wind is there to blow? Moreover, Qiu the Real Man and I have no enmity. Baiyun Temple was lost by me to him, not taken by force. Yesterday the Sovereign bestowed funds for temple construction, for men to build a temple. You now fabricate these words and stir up trouble. If the Sovereign learns of this, punishment will fall, which I cannot bear. If you wish to build, build as you will.’ Having so spoken, all fell silent. The monks, hearing the Chan Master’s words, suddenly awakened, and the thought of blowing the Western Wind to disperse Baiyun was at once dispelled. They burned the contracts in fire and returned to their various temples. Only the meddlesome monk who knew fengshui was dissatisfied in his heart. He went about meeting Zhang and disputing with Li, saying, ‘I have several thousand silver taels; I will build a Western Wind Temple before Baiyun Temple. When my Western Wind arises, it will certainly disperse Baiyun, and those priests will not be able to remain.’ He thought to frighten the Taoist brethren of Baiyun Guan by boasting, not knowing that nine out of ten of his comrades would also boast. Hearing these words, rumours spread that he would build the temple. ‘Let him build; when he does, we will erect a high wall before it like a fan. When the wind comes, we will fan it back, causing the wind to scatter itself.’ Suddenly a voice shouted, ‘If you can return the wind, I will go and set it on fire.’ Who this was remains to be seen in the next chapter.

Enduring insult can indeed bring about harmony,  
Fame and shame, truth and falsehood, let them drift eastward.
