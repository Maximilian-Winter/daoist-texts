# Chapter the First: The Manifestation of the Many Immortals of the Mysterious Origin Leaving Sacred Traces; The Investigation of Creation and Transformation as the Two Sons Descend into Mortal Form

A Poem says:

Calmly viewing all things as one Hua Xu,  
The world's states of heat and cold are altogether empty.  
At Yuji lies praying for three feet of rain,  
Zhuangzi sits reading five cartloads of books.  
Wang Goose sternly fishes among forest and plum,  
Tao’s chrysanthemums and Zhou’s lotuses in the bamboo garden with fishes.  
The various masters’ feelings are naturally different,  
The arising mind cleansed utterly, reaching true thusness.

Another Poem says:

The Way and Virtue, non-action in essence is natural,  
The teaching and transmission have a true exposition.  
When the Elixir is perfected, the Purple Palace lists the records,  
Indeed reaching the Jade Capital, annotating eternity.  
The Supreme One’s myriad branches store the jade registers,  
The heavenly immortals’ single lineage originates the golden lotus.  
The mysterious thread flows forth from ancient to now,  
From generation to generation continuing to enlighten later worthies.

It is said that under the whole heaven there were originally Four Great Continents: the Eastern Continent of Divine Victory, also called Fu Yu Dai; the Southern Continent of Jambu, also called Yan Fu Ti; the Western Continent of Ox-Head, also called Qu Ye Ni; the Northern Continent of Ju Lu, also called Yu Dan Yue. These four continents, when one is dark the other is bright; when one is dark it is covered by the brightness. What is dark is called Chaos. Now at present, in the Southern Yan Fu Ti, since the beginning of its opening and development, there have been over three hundred established states, large and small. Among all the produced peoples, only the Chinese land is the fairest; therefore, in the upper heavens, the true immortals and holy sages are most numerous in China. Of all those who have attained the Way in China from ancient times to now, the most flourishing period was during the Tang and Song dynasties.

Our heavenly immortal progenitor, the Eastern Emperor Lord Wang Xuanfu, was a man of the early Han. He obtained directly the Way of the Perfected Yin Xi, and dwelt in the Yanya Cave of Mount Kunlun, cultivating the Elixir to completion. By the time of Emperor Huan of Han, he transmitted the Way to the Lord of Correct Yang, Zhongli Quan, a native of Xianyang in Shaanxi, wise and courageous, serving Han as a remonstrating official. When the northern Qiang tribes invaded, his elder brother Zhongli Jian was a commanding general. Jian recommended his brother and he was appointed a great general to lead the northern expedition. Liang Ji envied him. The Qiang captured the camp and the army was defeated. Quan fled alone on horse and spear to the mountains. At night he saw a distant lamp shining, and spurred his horse towards it, finding a thatched hut with a monk, white-haired but with a youthful face. Quan marvelled and asked his name; it was Huanglong Hui Ji, that is, the Summer Huang Duke Cui Kuo of the Four Elders of Shang Mountain. The Duke said, "You are a Han general; within you is a treacherous hero, without you have rebellious parties; with the army defeated, there is nowhere to take refuge. You should go to seek the Master Shaoyang Jun, who will become the leader of true immortals. Why linger long in the mortal world, buried in the rounds of rebirth?" Quan, hearing these words, his heart awakened. The Duke led him away; he paid homage to Shaoyang Jun as master, and attained knowledge of the highest Way. Later, together with his brother Jian, he entered Mount Hua to cultivate, calling himself Correct Yang Zi, styled Yunfang. When the Way was accomplished, the Jade Emperor issued an edict, conferring upon Quan the title of True Man of the Left Palace of the Supreme Ultimate. Afterwards he concealed his name, calling himself Jin Chongjian, serving Wei as a general, guarding Dai Commandery. Seeing the arrogance and luxury of the Jin Emperor, he retired.

In the Tang dynasty appeared the transmitter Fu You Emperor Lord, surname Lü, named Shaoxian, whose ancestor was of Yongle County in Henan. His uncles were Wen, Liang, Gong, and Jian; his father named Rang, once passed the Jinshi examination, and served as governor of Haizhou; his mother Lady Wang. In the 20th year of Zhenguan, on the 14th day of the 4th month at the hour of si (9-11 a.m.), he was born. From youth he was wise; when an infant, Master Ma saw him and said, "This child's bones and features are extraordinary; in future he will manifest in the world. At certain times he will dwell in huts, at others he will knock at bells." When grown, he knew filial piety and propriety, kept a daily record of ten thousand words, and spoke fluently. He married Lady Liu. Three times he failed the Jinshi; at forty-six years, his mother commanded him to try again, so he took his household servant Tong Jier to the capital.

At a tavern in Chang'an, he met Correct Yang who gifted him a pillow. Shaoxian leaned on the pillow and fell deeply asleep; in his dream he appeared in the examination hall, his writings outstanding, winning first place as top scholar. He attended the Qionglin banquet, toured the capital streets for three days. Receiving imperial orders, he returned home to tend ancestral graves. The following year he took the examination again, was released as chief examiner. Upon completing affairs, he was promoted to Censor-in-Chief, governing with integrity, then promoted to Vice Minister of Rites, finally Minister of Personnel. He was accused by treacherous ministers of rebellion, stripped of office and imprisoned. After some days, taken to execution, facing the sword’s edge, the pain unbearable over ten li. Upon awakening, he was drenched with sweat. Correct Yang asked, "What of this dream?" Shaoxian startled asked, "I dreamed that Tong Jier held yellow millet not yet cooked; do you know the meaning of my dream?" Correct Yang said, "You desire wealth and glory; all your fortune and loss lie here. If you do not quickly turn back, when you face the sword's edge, it will be too late to regret!" Shaoxian felt numb and understood that wealth and glory were but a yellow millet dream. From then on, Correct Yang departed; Shaoxian sought the Way, realizing the vanity of the world.

In the second year of the Zhou Heavenly Grant, the year Xinmao, he took the examination and succeeded as Jinshi. Appointed magistrate of Dehua County in Jiangzhou. Roaming Mount Kuanglu, he met Fire Dragon True Man Zheng Siyuan who transmitted the Heavenly Concealment Sword method and internal alchemical instructions. Thereafter he abandoned office to wander, sending Tong Jier home to report. Jier obeyed and on the road lodged alone, thinking, "My master has abandoned office to seek the Way and sent me home to report to the mistress. How shall I face her? Better to die here, awaiting my master’s attainment to save me." So he hanged himself beneath a willow. Later Shaoxian met Correct Yang again who transmitted Golden Elixir formulas; he cultivated and attained true realization, returned home to see the tomb, saving Liu Dengzhen, whom he called the Willow Immortal, in truth Tong Jier, born Guo Shangzao. Later, in the Yuan era, an edict conferred the title Great Teaching Liu Zhenjun. This is another story, not told here.

Now Shaoxian, having attained the Way, styled himself Pure Yang Zi, named Yan, styled Dongbin, journeyed everywhere to preach and save. At Guangzhou, he saved Lady He and achieved the Way; at Changli, he saved Master Han to ascend true; roaming Handan, he caused Lu Ying to awaken from a dream; at Yanjing, he sent Liu Cao to seek the profound by a single phrase. Accompanied by Lan Yangsu, he journeyed to the Azure Halls, saved Cao Jingxiu to ascend Pengying, and also Zhang Zhennu and Lady Hou Xian. Among these immortals there are some recorded in genealogies. These were all Lü Zu’s unfinished wishes. How do we know his wishes were unfinished? When Correct Yang Emperor Lord ascended to heaven by imperial command, in the empty air appeared rainbow banners and flags, troops and banners, phoenix carriages and phoenix chariots, heavenly envoys descending to welcome him; he was appointed immortal envoy of the Nine Heavens Golden Palace, saying to Dongbin: "Thou shalt remain in the world to accumulate merit, and in time likewise become as I." Dongbin replied, "My ambition differs from yours; I must save all beings before ascending." Correct Yang said, "Thy purpose is lofty and deep; thou shalt become a great instrument. Though I now return to the heavenly palace, in the future I will help thee, fulfilling thy wishes." And so he ascended. Therefore later the two immortals Zhong and Lü ever continued to save and receive, never separated. Later men composed a poem praising them:

May thy power be vast, thy virtue high,  
Through ancient and modern immortal registers hailed as heroes.  
Everywhere receiving those with no aims,  
Everywhere supporting those with resolve and will.  
Painting cranes and inscribing poems to startle the world,  
Flying phoenixes opening teachings to break dust and toil.  
If all men used the ways of Zhong and Lü,  
They would only boast and pluck a single hair.

Now to relate True Man Wang Sheng of Yuntai Tongcheng. He attained the Way in the early Han, later appointed by Lord Lao to share control of Yuntai with Zhang Shen and Li Zhong. By the time of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang, all immortals assembled at Fangzhu to host the Pan Tao Grand Assembly. Wang Sheng followed Lord Lao to tour the Immortal Isles, seeing the immortals descend to the world, all accumulating merit and exploits, he conceived thoughts of dust and desire to descend randomly and accumulate merit in the world.

In the Song dynasty under Emperor Huizong’s Zhenghe years, in Xianyang County of Western Qin, Dawei village, lived a gentleman named Wang Renzheng, who had passed the filial and incorrupt examination, and came from a family of officials for generations. He served as magistrate of Wuzhou in Shanxi. After years of service, noted for honest governance, at over fifty years, lacking an heir, he resigned and returned home with his wife Lady Xie, bringing household and servants crossing the Yellow River in hired carts. They passed before the Western Mountain Temple; the sun was setting, so they hurried to lodge and stable their horses and carts. After supper, the couple discussed: "This Hua Mountain Temple is the palace of the Western Peak Golden Heavenly Shun Holy Emperor, whose divine power is manifest; all who pray are answered. Because we have no heir, having resigned office, and our ancestors were known for accumulated goodness, and we ourselves love goodness and joy in giving, I have heard in the Yi that 'the house accumulating goodness shall surely have abundant happiness.' Is this not true? I think the net of Heaven is wide but without escape; if our Wang family now invites the calamity of extinction of heirs, it may not be so." That night they wrote a petition praying for offspring, waiting till dawn, buying incense, candles, and paper money, the husband and wife went to the temple, offered incense and prayed. After presenting the petition, they returned home. (No more to record here.)

It is said the Western Peak Great Emperor governs the ranks of immortals, ghosts and spirits, rewards and punishments of people; all major matters are reported to the Jade Emperor, decreed from heaven; minor matters are by his own authority. Seeing Wang Renzheng’s petition, he dispatched officials, city gods, and local spirits to investigate the Wang family. The gods replied, "The Wang family for generations have accumulated much merit; furthermore Renzheng and his wife accumulate merit tenfold." The Western Peak Emperor, seeing the deep root and foundation, dared not decide on his own, so he took the petition to the Bright Hall to report to the Jade Emperor, with the celestial master Xu Jingyang presenting it. The Jade Emperor read the petition which said:

Humbly report: I am stationed in the West, governing the Geng and Xin and nurturing transformation; my office supervises Hua Mountain, receiving Qian and Dui to give birth. For ten thousand ages my spirit is manifest; no request is unanswered; through a thousand autumns, all petitions are felt and communicated. Herewith a humble petition. In the great Song country, Western Qin, Xianyang County, Dawei village, there dwells the believer Wang Renzheng and his wife Lady Xie, who together bathe and hold incense, sincerely praying in the court of the Western Peak Temple: Humbly considering that the Wang family for generations have practiced benevolence, yet face the calamity of no heir; Renzheng has accumulated merit half his life and prays to continue the blessings of ancestors. Humbly exposing our true hearts, daring to offend the holy wisdom, whatever is prayed for, please graciously bestow protection. Humbly wishing that in the White Jade Capital may be issued the Purple Banner, granting a son of eternal life; within the Golden Palace may be decreed the Elixir document, continuing the ancestral line; to inherit the past and open the future, glorifying ancestors and shining on the clan. Also praying for auspiciousness at home, all matters prosper. We have no words to express the fervent sincerity of this petition, humbly offering a hundred bows to report.

The Jade Emperor, after reading, said, "Is it unknown whether the Wang family truly has merit?" The Western Peak Emperor reported, "I sent envoys to investigate; the Wang family for generations have considerable hidden merit, and Renzheng and his wife are thoroughly good. I dare not reward secretly, therefore present this petition to Your Majesty, beseeching that the Four Fruit Immortals descend and beget offspring with them, so that in future the profound wind may flow freely."

The Jade Emperor heard the report and before replying, saw True Man Wang Sheng step forth from the ranks, holding a tablet, kneeling long, and reported, "I humbly present to the Jade Emperor: formerly I accompanied Lord Lao to tour the lower realms, seeing the profound wind weakening and intending to descend to the mortal world to reorganize the mysterious thread, making a model for later men; broadly expounding the great teaching, to be the compassionate ferry across the sea of suffering. I dare offend the holy wisdom, and earnestly report my sincerity, receiving utmost joy." The Jade Emperor, seeing the report, his countenance brightening, said, "Thou dost desire to descend to the world and widely expound the Taoist teaching; happily thou sharest the surname and root unchanged." Then he commanded the Jade Maiden Jingwei to bring a cup of jade nectar: "Drink this nectar, though thou shalt be reborn, the former cause shall not be lost. When the time comes to cast off dust, true immortals shall mark thee, confirming thy rank and immortal order, and bestowing further promotion." True Man Wang Sheng bowed and drank; Jade Maiden Jingwei at his side, seeing him commanded to descend, conceived a mortal thought, slightly moved her autumn gaze to glance at Wang Sheng. The Jade Emperor, knowing her intent, commanded Jingwei also to descend, to be married to Wang Sheng, until their work be completed and their fruit full, when they may ascend together to the Jade Palace. The two immortals thanked and took leave. The Four Great Heavenly Masters and other immortals accompanied them out of Lingxiao Palace; the two true men bade farewell to the assembly. The Western Peak Emperor returned to Mount Hua. (No more to record.)

It is said that Jade Maiden Jingwei was originally the daughter of the Divine Farmer Yan Emperor, named Nühua; she once studied under Chi Songzi. This maiden, desiring to cross the sea in search of the Way, longing for longevity, bade farewell to her parents, bringing palace maids and maidens, journeyed to the sea shore, made a raft to cross the sea, but drowned. Her spirit and true nature were not lost, transforming into a bird named Jingwei. Her wrath was unaltered; she tried to carry wood and stones from the Western Mountains to fill the Eastern Sea. Later she met master Chi Songzi, who took her to see the Queen Mother; the Queen Mother ordered her to watch over the peach garden of the Langyuan. Only when her wrath was cleansed and she was reborn in human form could she shed her feathers and ascend. Since attending the Pan Tao Grand Assembly, the Queen Mother appointed Jingwei to serve the Jade Emperor, adapting to circumstances, reincarnating as a human. Thus Jingwei now took the opportunity to descend and be born in Chang’an city as the daughter of the He family. Her mother dreamed of a blue bird flying into her bosom, awakening with pregnancy; later she gave birth to Lady He. (No more to record.)

Now Wang Renzheng returned home, busy for several days arranging household matters, then at last felt at ease. Suddenly winter passed and spring came; in the second month, the weather was clear and mild, the couple went together to the garden. They saw the peach blossoms just opening, brilliant to the eye, yet thinking of their lack of an heir, their brows remained unraised. Then they called the household’s Wang Xing to move wine and seats before the flowers, to admire and nibble, reciting a poem:

I remember when first planted,  
In joy I once recited a poem on the seed’s mechanism.  
Today I bring wine to admire again,  
The tree is old, the flowers late to fruit.

His wife heard the poem and laughed, saying, "When the tree is old and late to bear fruit, one knows the taste of ripeness." These words moved Renzheng’s heart; the couple drank and talked joyfully.

That evening, the couple lay together on the bed, suddenly a feathered man in yellow cap and crane cloak descended from the air, standing before the bed, loudly saying, "I am a true immortal of the Han dynasty, wishing to lodge here, and in future become the leader of the mysterious gate." The couple awoke startled, perceiving it as a southern branch dream. They doubted and distrusted: if it were a dream, why had they both experienced it? Surely there must be a cause. The wife then felt pregnancy.

Time passed swiftly; before they knew it ten months had completed. At the twelfth month, twenty-second day of the Renchen year of Zhenghe, Lady Xie suddenly felt labour pains, knowing the time had come, hastily called the maid to inform her husband. Wang Renzheng hastily arranged the incense altar, first worshipping heaven and earth and the deities, then announcing to ancestors. A red glow lit the sky, a strange fragrance filled the air. He thought, "In this midwinter time, how is there such rosy clouds and auspicious air? Surely this is a sign of the child." The household and servants rejoiced, bringing forth a living treasure. Renzheng took him in his hands and saw the child had clear brows and bright eyes, a high forehead and prominent nose, one not of ordinary kind. "Firstly the Wang family for generations accumulated goodness; secondly last year’s prayer at Hua Mountain showed divine response. Thus this child may continue the Wang clan line, and satisfy the lifelong hopes of my wife and me, not failing our life of goodness." He then ordered Wang Xing to prepare a banquet for three days’ welcoming, inviting all neighbours, relatives, and good friends, all coming to congratulate. The household was busy for many days; before they knew it, the year was near spring, adding much festivity.

Suddenly the full moon approached; at this time the gentry of Xianyang County, and countless officials of Chang’an, came to congratulate. Carriages and horses came and went uncounted, making a great bustle for many days. Truly:

Carriages and horses fill the gates as if to a feast,  
Good friends fill the seats as at Fangzhu.  
If not for accumulated goodness and hidden merit wide,  
How could true immortals descend in jade chariots?

If you wish to know what follows, wait to hear the next chapter unfold.
