# Chapter the Second: Lin Lingsu Initiates Profound Discourse on the Way and Virtue; Lü Dongbin Protects the Realm and Exterminates Demonic Fiends

The Poem says:

How much of fame and profit is right or wrong?  
Better to retire a step and hide in the mountains.  
Abandon the scholar’s and warrior’s hearts full of resentment,  
Seek the Way, pursue the profound, and discern your opportunity.  
When the nature of things is not yet clear, it is hard to grasp,  
When heartfelt sincerity is released, do not be at variance.  
From now on break the jar of sour paste,  
Leap beyond the cage and mount the crane in flight.

Now it is told that the two Immortals Zhong and Lü were wandering in Zhongnan, and observed the Wang family’s mansion full of lively tumult. Immortal Zhong said: ‘This is the place where the Perfected Man Wang Sheng descends and ascends. The time of the full moon approaches; lest the prior causes be obscured, I will go with you to enlighten it once more. What harm is there?’ The two Immortals then assumed new forms, disguising themselves as a pair of visiting Daoist companions. How were they attired? Behold:

One wore a bamboo hat, and a hundred-sleeved robe, splashed with mud;  
The other wore straw sandals, with a robe patched by a thousand needles, tattered and worn.  
One had three strands of long straight beard, chanting the Daoist airs with a clear voice;  
The other’s beard was bushy and mingled with sideburns, holding a fish-drum ringing loudly.  
Truly a pair of carefree transcendents, companions of the Perfected;  
They were men who comprehended the mysteries and moved with the airy spirits.

The two Immortals arrived before the Wang mansion’s gate, and struck the fish-drums, singing Daoist songs:

In former days, many Immortals entered the Imperial Capital,  
Officials earnestly prayed to the Jade Qilin.  
The Perfected Man, by imperial command, ascended the firmament,  
Resolving daily to renew the profound principles.  
Planting golden lotuses, redeeming the world’s people,  
Expounding the teachings squarely and thus communicating with the spirits.  
The Dao’s breeze opened the Song dynasty;  
The mysterious workings began with the primal stars.  
The bright moon and pure breeze are everywhere;  
At Yutai, steady seated, they arrange the silk lines.

Just then the lord of the house came out to see the guests, and beheld the two Perfected Daoist companions singing and drumming. Hastening forward, he bowed and said: ‘I know not which honoured Daoist masters have come to this humble place, bringing auspiciousness and illuminating the earth. I only hope you will not disdain the dust and disorder, and will please enter the inner hall to sit and converse.’ The two Immortals saw his earnest reception, and indeed it was sincere and benevolent. They returned his bow, saying: ‘Since you do not disdain our tattered garments, how dare we refuse to comply and pay our respects?’

The three courteously entreated each other, and entered the hall, again exchanging bows, taking seats according to rank. The lord at once commanded Wang Xingqian to prepare a simple vegetarian meal. The two Immortals said: ‘Though we wander in the world of dust, we have long abstained from smoke and fire. Since you have taken us in, we perceive your heart’s good will towards the Dao.’ The lord, seeing that they did not partake of smoke and fire, showed yet greater reverence, hastening to bring forth pears and fruits with all respect. The two Immortals smiled and said: ‘We come not as mendicants. We have long heard of your son’s birth, and humbly beg to see him and learn your honoured intentions.’ The benevolent lord smiled and said: ‘The little one has just been born, and today is his full moon. Since the two masters wish to see him, how dare I refuse?’ He then bade Wang Xing inform his wife, and hastily brought the young master out to the outer hall.

The two Immortals took the child in hand and looked upon him, seeing a faint smile. Immortal Zhong said: ‘This child is born with clear brows, bright eyes, a high forehead, square chin, prominent nose and large ears. He is no common mortal, but sure to be a scholar at the Jade Capital assembly.’ Immortal Lü said: ‘This child’s appearance is extraordinary, and he will surely become a great man, but his minor fortune is somewhat blocked. First he will lose his father, then his mother; he will first study literature and then turn to martial arts. In the future, his wife and he will share the realm of Penglai; all the nine ancestors and seven clans will be blessed by him. It is necessary to give him a loud and beautiful name, so that his roots may be firm, and he be easily nurtured to manhood.’ The benevolent lord seized the child, bidding the maid to carry him back to the inner chamber, then advanced with a deep bow, saying: ‘I pray the two Immortal Masters to give this little one a name, that he may partake of immortal blessings, and I dare pray for his long life; this will express my whole heart’s sincerity for goodness. May the two Immortal Masters consent?’ The two Immortals rejoiced and said: ‘We see this child will be both literary and martial, and become a noble official; he will have much blessing, long life, and many sons. In accord with the triple auspiciousness, he may be named Jia, with the courtesy name Yunqing.’

The benevolent lord heard with great joy, again bowed, and said: ‘May it be as you say; the Wang family line is hopeful, and I am content. Masters, please do not journey far; our humble place has a quiet back garden, where you may rest in peace. Though you do not eat smoke and fire, I shall prepare some fruits to offer you.’ The two Immortals smiled and said: ‘Our paths have no fixed abode, and our hearts are diverse; from this time we must take our leave.’ The benevolent lord asked: ‘May I know the two Masters’ names, that hereafter we may expect to meet again?’ Immortal Zhong said: ‘I am surnamed Jin, name Chongjian.’ Immortal Lü said: ‘I am surnamed Chang, name Wuxin. This is our sole farewell; we shall meet again in your son’s time.’ The benevolent lord saw them to the gate, when they vanished like a whirlwind. He knew they were Immortals descended, and bowed to the empty sky, praying silently for their protection. Returning home, he painted a scroll of the two Immortals and offered incense and worship regularly. No more need be told.

At that time Emperor Huizong delighted in the Dao, and bestowed upon the magicians Xu Zhichang the title of Master Chongxu, Xu Shouxin Master Jingxu, and Liu Hunkang Master Xuanmiao Chonghe. In the spring of the year Jiawu, Wang Wenqing of Fuzhou’s soul was released; he was decreed to be enfeoffed as attendant spirit of the Ning Shen Hall, and the Perfected Man Chongxu Miaohuan. Li Siguang of Jishui County in Ji’an Prefecture attained immortality; the emperor commanded a temple be built in his honour. The Daoist Lin Lingsu of Wenzhou, styled Suichang, in youth shaved his head to become a monk, but suffered harsh beating and scolding from his master, so he abandoned the monkhood to follow the Dao instead. He travelled into Shu to inquire, and met the Right Profound Perfected Man Zhao Sheng, from whom he sought the Way and patiently studied for years, receiving the transmission of the Daoist art. Later he wandered between Huai and Si seeking alms, but was insulted by monks. At the capital he lodged in the Taiyi Palace, recommended by Xu Zhichang. The emperor summoned him, and Lingsu boldly declared: ‘Heaven has nine firmaments, and the Divine Firmament is the highest, called the High and Upper Divine Firmament Prefecture. Its lord is the Supreme Jade Pure King, the eldest son of the Sovereign God, lord of the South, styled the Everlasting Great Emperor—that is Your Majesty. Next is the Eastern Flower Emperor. Cai Jing is the Left Prime Immortal Elder; Wang Fu is the Brilliant Civil Officer Shengzhang; and Consort Liu is the Nine-Flower Peaceful Consort.’ The emperor was greatly pleased, believing more firmly. It was known that the emperor had once dreamt of roaming the Divine Firmament, which secretly accorded with these words.

The emperor was always troubled by frontier affairs. Lingsu said: ‘Liao is self-occupied and unable to provide, how could it have leisure to make raids?’ In that winter, the Jurchen Wanyan Aguda rebelled against Liao, capturing Jiangning and other counties. In the spring of the year Yichou, Aguda proclaimed himself emperor, renaming the dynasty Jin Taizu, the country Great Jin, and the era Shouguo. That autumn he attacked Huanglong Prefecture, reaching the Hun Tong River, but lacking boats. A deity bore him across, water reaching the horse’s belly, and he took Huanglong. The frontier officials sent full report to Bianjing; the emperor summoned Lingsu and said: ‘Your words are verified.’ In the spring of the year Bingshen, Lingsu was granted the title Master of Thorough Truth and Spiritual Attainment. In April, he was ordered to preside over a great assembly of Daoist priests at the Shangqing Palace.

At first, the emperor was troubled by lack of an heir; the Daoist Liu Hunkang said the northwest capital’s land was low and slightly raised, promising the omen of many sons. The emperor commanded the hills to be raised higher; thereafter the imperial harem bore more children, and he trusted more in Daoism. In autumn, the ninth month, the emperor took the sacred title of Jade Emperor, decreeing throughout the realm that Grottoes and Blessed Lands should build palaces and temples, and sculpt sacred images.

Suddenly there were fiendish disturbances in the palace; by day apparitions appeared, stealing gold and treasures, violating consorts, allowing no rest. All were terrified. The emperor summoned Lingsu to quell it, but though it ceased, it soon returned. The emperor prayed with profound sincerity, offering petitions and fasts. One day while taking his noonday rest, he saw a Daoist, wearing a green lotus crown, a purple crane cloak, holding a crystal ruyi scepter, who bowed to the emperor, saying: ‘I come by the order of the Sovereign God to expel these fiends.’ After a while, a golden-armoured god flashed forth, seized the fiend, tore it apart and devoured it. The emperor asked: ‘Who is the god wearing golden armour?’ The Daoist said: ‘He is the enfeoffed Chongning True Lord Guan Yu.’ The emperor asked: ‘Where is Zhang Fei?’ Guan Yu said: ‘Fei and I are brothers through many kalpas; in every life male bodies. In the Tang he was Zhang Xun; now he is Your Majesty’s guardian of the realm, born in Xiangzhou from the Yue family. One day he will serve Your Majesty, assisting in revival; Fei will then have merit.’ The emperor asked the Daoist’s name; he answered: ‘Surname Yang, born on the fourteenth day of the fourth month.’ The emperor awoke and asked Lingsu, who said: ‘This is Master Lü.’ He decreed that all throughout the realm should advance the Pure Yang Wonderful Dao Perfected Man title, and honor the rites of worship.

In the year Dingyou, Jin changed its era to Tianfu. In autumn the emperor journeyed to the Shangqing Palace and ordered Lingsu to lecture on the Daoist scriptures. Each time a great ritual was held, costing several million, called the Thousand Daoist Assembly, all Daoists of the realm gathered. One day a mad Daoist, after the meal, wished to thank the emperor in person, and said: ‘Your Majesty’s love for the Dao is truly admirable, but you cannot escape the misfortune from the North.’ The emperor was surprised and asked: ‘Are you not Immortal Lü?’ He answered: ‘My surname is Li, not Lü. I will return to Min, and at Wu, Wei, Bing, Ding days, again pay respects at the northern chariot.’ After speaking, he suddenly disappeared. The emperor asked Lingsu, who said: ‘I have heard of Li Ti in Min, whose appearance is such.’ He decreed a statue be established beside the ancestor Lü.

In the year Wuxu, in April, the Daoist Seal Institute submitted a memorial officially naming the emperor as Leader of the Teaching, the Daoist Sovereign Emperor; all memorials and reports would follow the Daoist rites. He ordered throughout the realm the building of palaces and temples, and the creation of imperial images and heavenly writings in seal script. Lin Lingsu was granted the title Master of Thorough Truth and Spiritual Attainment of Primordial Mystery, and Zhang Xubai the title Master of Complete Mystery and Profound Wonder. As for various princes competing to enter Daoism, the people called the two courts of the Dao. Zhang Xubai was from Dengzhou, versed in Taiyi and Liu Ren divinations, having met a strange man who transmitted the Way. The emperor heard his name and summoned him as master of the Taiyi Palace; he came and went within the palace, speaking only of the way and virtue, not of affairs. Later, seeing the court affairs grow disorderly, he resigned and went to wander Wuling, drinking with Cui Po, and passed away in spiritual release. Later country folk met him again in Yangzhou, and he sent a poem to Cui Po:

By the Wuling creek, Cui Po’s wine,  
In heaven there is none, but on earth it is.  
From the southern land of the Dao, drink a measure,  
Drunken, lie down at the white clouds’ deep cave mouth.

In the year Wuxu the era name was changed to Chonghe. In the year Jihai it was changed to Xuanhe. The Buddhist titles were changed to Great Enlightened Golden Immortal; monks were called virtuous scholars, their robes changed, and original surnames restored. Temples were changed into palaces and temples of the Dao; nuns became female virtues.

In the summer of the year Gengzi, the era changed to Yuande. Lingsu committed an offence and was banished to the countryside. He said to his disciples: ‘I am about to depart. You may carry my coffin to the foot of the southern mountain; where the earth breaks, there you may bury me.’ Having spoken, he passed away. The disciples followed his words, and at the foot of the southern mountain found indeed a broken place. They dug down and found it unfathomably deep; they lowered the coffin and buried him. The next day they looked and found the place level, without sign of burial. This was reported to the emperor, who sighed deeply.

That winter, Fang La rebelled in Muzhou, capturing Wuxi, She, and Quzhou, then taking Hangzhou, holding it for several years. In Huainan, Song Jiang and thirty-six others, matching the number of the Heavenly Gang, formed their stronghold at Liangshan; receiving a dream from the Mysterious Lady granting them celestial writings and yellow and white arts, they ravaged the Hebei region, plundering the eastern commanderies, and government troops dared not resist their might. Zhang Shuye knew the Haizhou situation and earnestly remonstrated the court; Song Jiang and others surrendered. The emperor then ordered a campaign against Fang La in Hangzhou, with eunuch Tong Guan joining the army. Most of Song Jiang’s forces were lost at Shuipo. Fang La was defeated and fled to Bangyuan Cave. Han Shizhong was general under Wang Yuanzhong, secretly traversing valleys, inquiring of wild women for paths, killing dozens, and capturing Fang La. The Muzhou rebels were pacified.

Suddenly in the palace fiends caused havoc at night, restless, sometimes appearing as a great tortoise, sometimes as human form, and no blade or weapon could approach. The emperor was greatly troubled. Officials reported: ‘There is a Daoist of Songshan named Chang Xuzhong, skilled in Daoist arts and able to quell demons.’ The emperor commanded his summons. The search found a Daoist who presented a poem:

Pointing to the high peak, he laughed aloud,  
Red clouds and purple mists rose before him.  
Often wandering the dusty market, none knew him,  
Long he dwelt in the mountains where cranes welcomed him.  
Sometimes he played the jade moon to drive away demons,  
Daily heating the golden cauldron to brew pure nectar.  
In future years, if I attend the Penglai assembly,  
Know that my alchemical book bears my name.

The emperor pondered the poem’s meaning, thinking ‘Chang’ and ‘Xuzhong’ meant ‘Lü.’ From then the palace fiends ceased, and worship was increased. No more need be told.

Meanwhile in Chengdu lived Xie Shi, styled Runfu, learned and versed in change, who obtained the way of the ancestor Lü, explaining human blessing and calamity by dissecting characters with unfailing accuracy, renowned to the ninth heaven. Summoned to the rear garden, he divined for consorts and the crown prince, with no failure. The emperor rewarded him richly, appointing him to the office of Chengxin Lang. Shi knew the north was beset with calamity, and soon returned to Shu.

In the spring of the year Renyin, Jin attacked Liao, and the Liao ruler fled to Yuncheng. Jin then captured the western capital; Liao enthroned Jin Wang Chun as emperor, with the capital at Yanjing. That winter Song allied with Jin against Liao, seized Yanjing, and Liao ruler Chun fled to Tiande.

In the autumn of the year Guimao, the Jin ruler Wen died; his brother Sheng ascended, becoming Jin Taizong, changing era to Tianhui. At that time Wang Jinian was twelve years old, versed in the classics and histories, and familiar with the myriad schools. Suddenly his father died without illness, and household affairs were managed by his mother and Wang Xing for the funeral. As he had not yet established himself, he only wept bitterly. Lady Xie worried for her young son, wept deeply, fearing for his health, but comforted him with kind words: ‘The old live a hundred years; death’s time is fixed. Your father was over sixty, not a short life. If you but apply yourself to study and seek advancement, your father though in the underworld will be at peace.’ Yunqing heeded his mother’s words and resolved to study, answering: ‘I think at this time the world is in disorder; Song has allied with Jin to destroy Liao; Jin is strong and will surely cross south to destroy Song. In these years, the military leaders advance their merit. By my view, better to abandon literature and enter martial arts; this will both preserve life and establish a career, and help the state and bring peace. This is my wish; I pray my mother to judge.’ Lady Xie thought: ‘Though my son is young and immature, his words are extraordinary; now he speaks of state affairs, measuring that he is no pond fish, but awaits the chance of wind and cloud.’ She said to Jia: ‘Your mother is but a woman of insight, hoping only that you will grow and establish yourself. As to literature and martial arts, I leave that to your choice.’

Henceforth Yunqing changed his name to Zhongfu, practicing archery and swordplay at home, carrying stones and wielding blades. At eighteen he changed his name to Shixiong, took the imperial exams and entered the office of assistant magistrate, marrying the daughter of a captain in Chang’an city. The next year his mother fell ill and died. He observed mourning for three years, and at twenty-four took the advanced exams, coming thirty-sixth, and returned home to tend graves and offer ancestral rites. No more need be told.

Now it is told that Song appointed Zhang Shangying as prime minister. The drought had long continued, but on the night he received office there was great rain. The emperor rejoiced, writing large characters for ‘Shanglin’ (minister of rain) and granted them to him. There was a crippled Daoist and a gate attendant who sought alms; Zhang asked jestingly: ‘As a Daoist, have you any art?’ He answered: ‘I can mould earth to make incense.’ Zhang took earth from beside the steps, moulded and burned it, a strange fragrance filled the air. When the smoke cleared, the Daoist was gone, but he left a poem upon the table:

Moulding earth to incense has its cause,  
The world proclaims falsehood and should not be true.  
The prime minister of the imperial court, Zhang Tianjue,  
Is the wandering immortal Lü Dongbin of the world.

Zhang Shangying, feeling regret for not knowing, thenceforth renounced worldly mind and sought the Dao. Later he was slandered by He Zhizhong and sent as magistrate to Henan Prefecture, then demoted to military governor of Chengxin forces. Later seeing affairs grow worse, he abandoned office and went to Zhongnan to seek the Dao, where he met the two Immortals who said: ‘The sleepy man now awakes?’ Shangying was amazed, bowed and gave his name. They said: ‘If you speak of the near, then Fan Li and Zhang Liang; if the far, then Qibo and Fenghou. You must follow the journey of Master Lü, so as to attain the Way, which is not difficult.’ Shangying beseeched salvation of the world; the two Perfected then imparted secret formulas, urging his diligent cultivation, and then departed. Shangying chose a place to practice cultivation. No more need be told.

In the spring of the year Yiyi, Jin captured Liao ruler Yanxi, and Eastern Liao perished. Yelü Dashí proclaimed himself emperor at Qierman, becoming Western Liao Dezong, with era Yanqing. At that time Song bestowed the title Prince of Guangyang on Tong Guan. Zhang Shangying sighed: ‘Enemies rise without, the country suffers many calamities; the eunuch is made prince, never before seen. This country is doomed; we may as well fold our feet and wait.’ He then withdrew to southern Yunnan to cultivate. Soon he attained the elixir and saved the world. Truly:

Though the road is far, one may seek it,  
Loyal hearts protect the realm and find rest.  
Now I care not for worldly matters,  
Mount the crane and phoenix and return to the ten continents.

If you wish to know what befell thereafter, listen to the next chapter unfold.
