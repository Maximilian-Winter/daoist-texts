# Chapter Eleven: The Six Immortal Friends of Great Wei Village Are Separated — The Two Brothers Meet at the Little Hua Temple

The Ode:

The dusty world is short, the road is long,  
If not for true resolve, merit is hard to complete.  
Do not turn back, pursue the flowing water;  
Life and death revolve like a boat adrift.  
Rest, rest!  
Awaken swiftly and sharply, idle wandering is vain.  
Life is but a moment’s stay; seek the true Lead with earnest care.  
Be cautious in practice, set up the furnace and cauldron,  
Forget the passing of spring and autumn.  
Leisurely, leisurely.  
— (Right tune: “Cherish the Dividing Hairpin”)

It is told that the six brothers of Ma Danyang, having left Liu Jiang Village, journeyed together and said: “Since we have arrived here, we must go to Great Wei Village. First, to meet with our elder brothers; secondly, to report to our master the matter of his ascension to Heaven, so that his household may know.” With one heart they proceeded towards Great Wei Village.

Now, Wang Jinyu and his brother Jinbao, since their parents had gone forth to cultivate the Dao, were regarded by their clan and neighbours as having been elevated to immortality, Wang Chongyang and Heyu Shan having ascended. Thus they built temples, fashioned images of immortals, burned incense morning and evening, prayed and offered sacrifices; all requests were answered, their power and spirit made manifest. Jinyu had begotten one son and two daughters; Jinbao had begotten two sons. Jinyu had long since passed away. At this time Jinbao was over fifty years of age, and was given to charity and joy, revering monks and loving the Dao; his family fortune remained abundant.

At this moment he was in front of the hall viewing flowers, when he saw six Taoist friends enter. He hastened forward to welcome them, and invited them to sit in the hall. At once he ordered the household to prepare tea and food.

Then Ma Danyang and the others advanced with bowed hands, and said: “Is this, by any chance, Brother Wang?” Jinbao returned their salutes, and asked: “I am but a humble man surnamed Wang. May I ask from whence you masters come? And what brings you hither?” Danyang replied: “We are all men from Shandong, disciples of Master Chongyang. We have heard that the master’s family is from Great Wei Village in Xianyang, surname Wang, given name Jia, style Zhiming. There are two elder brothers in the family: the elder is Jinyu, the younger Jinbao. Might this be your household?”

Jinbao, hearing this, renewed his salutations, and said: “Since brothers such as yourselves have come, I truly was unaware and have not received you properly. I beg your forgiveness for any disrespect.” All answered together: “We entered your household in haste to pay our respects; we dare not ask for pardon.”

Jinbao asked: “Since brothers have come from afar, surely you know the whereabouts of my father? I beg you to instruct me.” Danyang then recounted how the master had taught and guided men in Shandong, and how on the fifteenth day of the third month this year he had returned to the True, with words of admonition; and how throughout the journey he had manifested wondrous transformations. He related all in detail. Jinbao, hearing these words, rejoiced greatly, and said: “Now, hearing from you brothers, I know my father has ascended to immortality. But I know not how my mother fares.” Danyang said: “I have heard the master say that your mother has already attained the Way, and now remains in the mortal realm gathering merit, awaiting summons. I judge that her ascension will not be long delayed. How fare the household at your place, brother?” Jinbao related the affairs of his family. Then he invited them to stay for a meal and to lodge.

The next day, accompanying them to the temple, after offering incense and worship, they sat down. Danyang said: “Brethren, we two this morning are here in this temple, as if before our master himself. When master was about to transform, he gave instructions which all must know. The elder brothers who have already heard the great Way may now begin to work, accumulating merit and achievements; Tai Gu, Chang Sheng, Yu Yang, and others have all gained something. They must advance with vigour and refinement, temper the nature and mind, accumulating vast merit; the day of their ascension is at hand. But Brother Qiu alone has neither merit outwardly nor Dao techniques inwardly; what shall be done for him?” Fuyang, hearing Danyang’s words, hastened forward and knelt, beseeching: “All elder brothers have attained the Way; only I have heard nothing. I entreat Brother Ma to take pity and guide me. Even if I perish, I shall not forget the grace of my brothers.” Danyang hastened to help him up, and said: “When master transformed, he once entrusted me with these words: so long as you diligently cultivate without slackening, I will transmit to you the supreme Way; diligently practice, and naturally the day of true attainment will come.” Fuyang bowed again and rose. That day all returned to Jinbao’s home.

After three days, having taken breakfast, they deliberated. Chang Zhen wished to go west to Shu, to accumulate merit and nourish the Way. Wang Yuyang wished to return to Shandong to visit his mother. Danyang said: “I and Brother Qiu will remain here in Qin Chuan to cultivate and nourish life, passing the years. Brother Wang, since you return to Shandong, please mind affairs at Quanzhen Temple.” Yuyang said: “Since Brother Ma does not return to Shandong, I will surely pass Quanzhen Temple on my way; though I will not manage affairs, I must inform the assembly of the departure of our elder brother, and appoint a steward, so that all may be well.” At this time the company bade farewell to Jinbao, who earnestly entreated them to stay, but could not detain them, and saw them out the great gate. Each took his own road, and thus parted. Hao Taigu again retired to divination in the thickets, wandering the great land, pointing out the lost and cultivating the Way. Liu Changsheng dwelt within the forest of physiognomy, hiding his brilliance and refining his person. Tan Changzhen journeyed southward.

Only Ma Danyang and Qiu Fuyang remained in Qin Chuan at Riqi Village; by night they lodged in an ancient temple, sharing a rush mat for meditation, instructing cultivation methods one by one; Fuyang received all with heartfelt reverence. Danyang said: “Those who cultivate the Way must first eliminate the Seven Passions. Without removing the Seven Passions, the Eight Consciousnesses cannot return to the Source. The Original Spirit is unsteady, the true nature dark and obscure; the Way’s work is not accomplished. When the Seven Passions are removed, the Six Thieves self-destruct; if the Six Thieves are not exterminated, the Five Phases cannot cluster. The primal energy will not arise, and the foundation of the cinnabar cannot be established. One must cultivate oneself to pure perfection, inwardly without appearance, outwardly without intrusion. Outwardly be unbound by fame and profit; inwardly not dragged by desire. When all thoughts and wild imaginings are purified, the natural nature of Heaven’s mandate appears. Empty and awaiting, there will come a return of Yang. Gather and refine it, forming the knife and jade tablet; this is called the Golden Elixir. If you fail to remove wandering thoughts, I cannot be your friend.” Chu Ji humbly obeyed, practicing diligently day and night. This is not recorded further.

Now, after the Realized Master Wang Chongyang’s distant ascension, beneath the Junyi Bridge he discoursed on the abstruse, enticing the heart of Old Zang; at the head of Liu Jiang Creek he bestowed medicine, curing the illness of Zhang Gong. Sometimes he danced on the right of Kunming Pool, sometimes he chanted in the region of Zhongnan. His divine transformations were without rule, his spiritual communications unfathomable, impossible to record fully. East Sea and West Qin, he exhorted both Daoists and laymen everywhere, redeeming men and accumulating merit.

Now, Wang Yuyang having taken leave of elder brothers, journeyed twenty days or more, reaching the borders of Luoyang. Suddenly he recalled elder brother Sun Buer, who once, by master’s command, feigned madness to refine his nature in Luoyang. “Though I have followed the master for twenty years and heard the Way, I have not yet understood it fully. I have long heard that Sun Buer has deeply grasped the master’s subtle instructions; I must seek him out. One, to report the master’s distant departure; two, to beseech him to impart the essentials of the Way.” So he traveled onward, and at the eastern gate of the city heard people speaking of a madwoman. Yuyang knew this must be Buer, and approached, asking: “Just now I heard brethren mention this madwoman; where does she dwell? I beseech you to point the way, for I would like to see her.” An old man answered: “This madwoman has been here for years, daily wandering near this district, and at night she lodges in a broken kiln behind Yunxi Temple.” Yuyang asked: “Where is Yunxi Temple?” The old man said: “Just outside the northeast corner of the city, not more than two li away; it is a great temple.” Thereupon Yuyang took leave of the people and set out for Yunxi. Seeing that evening was approaching and his belly was hungry, he went to a nearby village to buy some bread to eat. From afar he saw a great temple and knew it to be Yunxi. Approaching the temple, he saw the ruined kiln behind it, and walked towards it.

Sun Buer was then in the midst of adjusting spirit and issuing the embryo; having known of Yuyang’s coming, she hastened out to welcome him. Yuyang, seeing Buer, hurried forward and bowed, saying: “Since we parted years ago, I have daily borne you in my heart. To see you again today is like a parched fish meeting water, and I cannot contain my joy.” Buer returned the salutation: “Your kindness, brother, is deep and sincere. To come here to see me is indeed rare. Pray tell me, how is the master and all the elder brothers at present?” Yuyang related in detail all about the master’s immortal journey, the funeral, and manifestations, and how at Chang’an they parted; how Danyang and Fuyang were together in Qin Chuan cultivating; how Changzhen, Taigu, and Changsheng journeyed about. “I now desire to return to Shandong to visit my mother; passing here, I thought suddenly of Brother Sun. One, to pay respects and congratulate your attainment; two, to entreat you with compassion to transmit the secret of the Golden Elixir, so I may never forget your grace.” When he had finished, he prostrated himself. Buer hastened to detain him, saying: “Brother, do not be so humble. Since the master has ascended, and all elder brothers have cultivated profound skill, hearing your words that the Golden Elixir Way is not yet clear to you, how could your own brothers not transmit it? Yet I am now in the stage of nourishing the embryo and issuing the spirit, and wish to trouble you, brother, to protect my stillness for a year. What say you?” Wang Yuyang said: “Thanks to your help, brother, I shall protect your stillness, serving you.” So the two rested in the kiln.

At this time Buer’s embryonic origin was firm, and she no longer craved food. Wang Yuyang went out to seek alms, and in leisure protected stillness. Furthermore, Buer’s way of alchemy returned to completeness; in empty space spirits naturally guarded her, and inward and outward were clear. Buer used spirit urging to issue the embryo, gradually communicating with the numinous transformations. After a year’s time, the Yang Spirit appeared, moving without hindrance, comprehending the six penetrations, discerning the future.

One day she said to Yuyang: “My spirit is now communicated and clear; my profound skill is complete. For more than a year I have relied entirely on your protection, and have no grace to repay. Now I will transmit to you the Golden Liquid and Great Way of the Elixir, to repay your help.” Yuyang hastened forward and knelt. Buer helped him up and sat beside him, whispering the secret instructions one by one, and said: “I impart to you the true secrets of refining the elixir, nourishing the embryo, adjusting spirit and issuing the embryo, and all the various fires and methods. You must diligently cultivate, adding work and accumulating deeds; the day of true attainment will come. But this Way must not be lightly given to the unworthy; be cautious and careful! Brother, you may now go to Shandong, to Yushan, choose the place and cultivate diligently. Now you may depart.” Yuyang bowed and said: “Having received the Way from you, brother, I know not when I may repay you.” Buer said: “Brother, go diligently and toil in cultivation; when your merit is full, we shall meet again.” They parted at the kiln’s mouth.

Wang Yuyang took leave of Buer and journeyed toward Shandong. In less than a month he arrived at Ninghai Quanzhen Temple. The assembly seeing Yuyang return all came out to greet him. At that time a native of the prefecture named Cao Jiande managed affairs at the temple. All asked after his affairs; Yuyang greeted the assembly and related the matters above in detail. Hearing of the master’s divine transformations, all praised and rejoiced exceedingly. Yuyang further related how elder brother Sun Buer had guarded stillness and issued the embryo; all acclaimed: “Surely she is a great man among women!”

Yuyang stayed at the temple for three days. Seeing that all affairs were in order, he said to the assembly: “I see Brother Cao managing matters here better than Danyang; I have no worry. I desire to go to Wendeng to visit my mother once.” Jiande said: “Brother’s returning home to visit mother is filial and natural; I dare not detain you. But you must go early and return early, so as not to cause us anxiety.” Yuyang said: “Here there is a brother to protect the place, and many to guard it; the community’s needs will not be lacking. Besides, I wish to seek a place of peace to live and hide for a few years. I now take leave; we shall meet again.” All saw him off nearly a li from the mountain gate, then returned.

Wang Yuyang left the assembly and came to Wendeng County. After a few days he reached his home door. He saw white couplets pasted on the gate, and hastened indoors. He saw a filial memorial hall set up in the ancestral hall, and going forward to look, knew that his mother had passed away. He prostrated himself and burst into loud lamentation. His household servants saw this and hastened to inform the master: “Outside there is a wandering Daoist weeping before the late lady’s spirit tablet; we know not who he is.” Filial Brother hurried out and seeing his brother, hastened forward; they embraced and wept bitterly. Filial Brother said: “Since you left, mother daily awaited you; later she fell ill, and for over ten years never ceased to long for your return. On the thirteenth day of the second month this year, her life ended. Why have you been away these ten-plus years without a word of news?” Wang Yuyang said: “I went forth following mother’s command to seek masters and the Way. In earlier years, wherever I sought, all were heterodox paths without true transmission. Upon returning to Dengzhou, I met Master Chongyang and became his disciple, earnestly seeking the Way and serving the master without a moment’s delay. After the master’s ascension and funeral in Shaanxi, I turned to visit mother; on the road I met Brother Sun, and guarded stillness with him for over a year, finally obtaining true transmission. Now I desire to return home and cultivate the wondrous Way together with mother. How could I have imagined she would have already departed the mortal realm?” When he finished, he wept bitterly again, mourning half a day until exhausted. Filial Brother, feeling pity, came forward to comfort him: “Mother is dead and cannot be brought back. It is vain for you to weep yourself to death. Only we may hope that when you attain the true fruit, mother, though in the underworld, may also be delivered.” Hearing this, Yuyang ceased weeping. All family and nephews came to pay respects. Thereupon Yuyang remained at home observing mourning, also cultivating the Way and refining himself. Filial Brother was greatly pleased. This matter is not further told.

Meanwhile, Danyang and Fuyang continued their cultivation and refinement in Qin Chuan. Danyang was a long-cultivated man of attainment; now that the Golden Elixir was complete, he feared neither wind, cold, summer nor damp; nor water, fire, hunger, nor famine. Now with Fuyang as companion, they strictly observed the master’s commands, intending to guide Fuyang across the Way. At this time they lodged in a temple named Little Hua Temple in the region of Huayin. Suddenly heavy snow fell from Heaven, covering the plain some three feet deep; not a step could be taken. The two were trapped in the temple, enduring great hardship. Fuyang’s belly was hungry, and he was chilled; though he endured for three days, on the third night he could bear no more, and a thought arose: “These days the great snow blocks all paths; I cannot go out to seek alms, and the cold and hunger are unbearable. If tomorrow someone would bring me some noodle soup to eat, that would ease my hunger and cold.” At the moment this thought arose, he was truly a man intent upon cultivating the Way; straightway he struck the Earth God and the Dragon Spirit. The local Earth God then appeared in a dream to a man in the northern village of Huazhou, surnamed Zhang, styled Erlao; he was sixty years old, childless, and lifelong reverent of monks and Daoists. The Earth God said to him in the dream: “In the Little Hua Temple there are two true men, trapped by the snow and hungry beyond endurance. Tomorrow morning you may bring them some noodle soup, and you shall gain boundless blessing. Wake and remember; my spirit departs!” Zhang Erlao awoke and told his mother: “I had a strange dream! An old man said: ‘In the temple here are two true men, trapped by snow and hungry beyond endurance. Tomorrow morning you should bring them some noodle soup to eat, and you shall gain boundless blessing.’” His mother said: “My dream was the same.” They agreed: “At dawn I will go to the temple and see if this is true; you can prepare noodle soup. If there are really people, I will bring it; if not, I will eat it myself.” His mother said: “That is wise.”

At dawn Zhang Erlao set out, walking through the snow, and arriving at the temple saw indeed two Taoist masters: one sitting with closed eyes in meditation, the other sleeping beside him. He hastened home and told his mother, and the two rejoiced greatly. It is as the saying goes:

“Virtue and Dao have no origin,  
Cultivation depends on the man.  
If not for firm resolve and perseverance,  
How could one become a true immortal?”

To know the later affairs of the two true men Ma and Qiu, await the next chapter.
