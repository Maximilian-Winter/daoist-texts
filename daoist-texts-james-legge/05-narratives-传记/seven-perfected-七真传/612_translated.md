# Chapter Thirteen: Wang Chuyi Performs Daoist Arts in the Palace; Qiu Changchun Converts a Maiden on the Ridge

Verses say:

The cinnabar scripture is remote, the hidden mystery obscure,  
How many true souls find the Way hard to complete!  
Time passes swiftly, like a candle before the wind,  
Throat and breath cut off, gold is hard to renew.  
Poison, poison, poison!  
Urgent is the refining, no time for weariness;  
When the work is done, early to attend the Peach Banquet.  
Enter the grotto heavens, meet the assembly of immortals,  
Untroubled joy, leaping beyond the three thousand.  
Sweet, sweet, sweet.  
(Tune: "Phoenix Hairpin")

It is told that the three immortals Sun, Ma, and Geng each mounted white cranes and departed from Zhongnan, each taking different paths to accumulate merit and advance their practice. We do not relate their further deeds.

In the autumn of the Year of the Gui-chou, the Song emperor issued an edict appointing Zhu Xi to govern Tanzhou. The Shou Emperor was ill; the Chancellor Liuzheng led the ministers to petition the emperor for inquiry into the illness. The emperor would not comply; all the ministers wept bitterly and withdrew.

In the summer of the Jia-yin year, the Shou Emperor passed away. The emperor declined to appear due to illness; Liuzheng feigned sickness to escape. The emperor took the throne, suddenly collapsed, and then died. The Privy Councilor Zhao Ruyu and others petitioned the Empress Dowager to issue an edict appointing Prince Jia, the third son of Emperor Guangzong, who then donned mourning and ascended the throne as Emperor Ningzong. Ruyu requested an edict to recall Liuzheng; Liuzheng established Empress Han as consort and was appointed Right Chancellor.

In the Yi-mao year, the era name changed to Qingyuan. The Empress Dowager's relative Tuo Zhou used power to exclude upright scholars and introduced wicked men, placing them in the office of the Dali (Supreme Court) Assistant. Lü Zujian was in Shaozhou; his cousin Zu Gong, a commoner, impeached Tuo Zhou. The brothers were equally renowned for loyalty and righteousness. In the tenth month, Ruyu was banished to Yongzhou; upon arrival in Hengzhou, he suddenly died.

In the Bingchen year, the Jin dynasty changed the era name to Cheng’an. Song appointed Jing Tang as Right Chancellor. Ye Zhu and Ni Si, both knowledgeable about the tribute examinations, dismissed those who had some understanding of righteousness. Zhu Xi was demoted; Cai Yuanding was banished to Daozhou. Cai was a friend of Zhu Xi and traveled with his son Shen there for over a year. Suddenly he said to Shen, "I shall now bid farewell to guests; I desire peace and quiet to return to the Way." Three days later, he died. He was afterward called the Master of the Western Mountain.

In the Ding-si year, false teachings were registered; Liuzheng, Zhu Xi, and fifty-seven others were all recorded as authors of books.

Now Wang Yuyang, after fulfilling three years of filial mourning at home, took leave of his brother and sister-in-law and left the mountain to apply himself to practice. His brother Xiaoqian earnestly remonstrated: "Since you have resolved to pursue the Way, why leave the mountain? Stay quietly at home a few more years. Your sister-in-law and you may guard the quiet together; would that not be good?" Wang Yang replied: "I am an unfilial and unrighteous person; if I do not respect and obey my brother and sister-in-law at home, but seek quiet outside by leaving, I cannot aid my brother. Human relations would be impaired; moreover, to idle away time at home would burden my sister-in-law. It is truly hard to bear." Xiaoqian urged him repeatedly; Wang Yang was resolute in refusal. Xiaoqian, helpless, went to his room, took out two hundred taels of silver, and gave them to Yuyang saying, "My brother will not stay at home; I have no choice. Take these two hundred silver taels for your Way foundation." Yuyang declined greatly but accepted one hundred taels, bade farewell to his brother and sister-in-law, and wept bitterly. Xiaoqian accompanied him three li from the village, grieving without end. Wang Yang parted with tears, reluctant and sorrowful, departing mournfully. Xiaoqian stood by the roadside, watching until his brother was out of sight, then returned home.

Having parted from his brother, Wang Yuyang came to the border of Ninghai and saw Mount Yu, fair in appearance. Remembering Sun Buer’s words that his fate was linked with Mount Yu, he ascended the mountain to seek it out. There he found a stone chamber, quiet and elegant, inscribed with the words "Cloud Light Grotto Heaven." Wang Yang took residence there to cultivate. Several months passed. By destiny and the protection of the natural guardian spirits, several good men came seeking the Way there. Wang Yang received them as disciples and as guardian spirits attended him. He then began work, cultivating for three years until his elixir was complete and his yang spirit appeared. Next he applied the work of refining emptiness and uniting with the Way for three years, attaining divine powers and transformations, manifesting and concealing at will, wondrous and unfathomable. He wrote a collection entitled "Cloud Light Anthology" and established a sect of forty characters called the Yu Mountain Sect, which passed down to later generations:

The Way of purity and non-action,  
Sincerity with nature and name.  
Gold and jade skillfully understood,  
Thus ascend to the earth-immortals.  
Profound doctrine of the Void and Chaos,  
Flourishing and broad the teaching’s origin.  
True law of harmony eternal,  
Wisdom preserves the spirit intact.

At that time, the Jin ruler heard that Wang Chuyi of Dongmu had attained the Way and sent envoys to invite him. Chuyi complied and came to Yan. The ruler tested his art by placing a gecko beneath a basin and inquired what was inside. Yuyang said:

Like a tiger yet not a tiger,  
Like a snake yet not a snake.  
Four feet, long tail,  
Taking the wall as its home.

The emperor then covered it with a piece of gold and asked again. Chuyi said:

Outside round, inside square,  
Seen it shines with light.  
Men call it a precious treasure,  
Deeply hidden, not to be revealed.

The emperor believed deeply. Envious men gave him poisoned wine; he did not die. He took leave and traveled widely, performing works, liberating people, expelling ghosts, issuing talismans and rescuing from disaster.

Coming beneath Mount Tai of the Eastern Peak, he saw a great stone blocking the road. He raised an iron whip, exerted high wisdom-power, struck and shattered the stone to clear the way. Passersby recognized him as a true immortal and bowed in reverence. The perfected man waved his sleeve and went on.

At the northern city of Hanjun, he saw severe drought; the common people were in disorder. The perfected man knew that beneath Mount Sumen was a great spring. He ordered the people to dig, and found a large spring which irrigated hundreds of li, blessing the multitude. He healed hidden illnesses and rescued those in peril. Later he concealed himself in Zhongtiao Mountain, standing alone on a perilous cliff for nine years, awaiting the imperial summons to ascend; we make no further record.

Now it is told that Qiu Chuji was at Panxi, cultivating by day and meditating by night. Over six years he refined body and mind, dying seven times and reviving. He died small deaths battling demons, countless in number. With firm resolve and bitter practice, he drove away the sleep demons. Though suffering some demonic afflictions, his heart was clear in the Way, and he styled himself the Master of Eternal Spring. In leisure he wrote a collection entitled "Panxi Mingdao Anthology," which circulated.

Three officials under the Three Origins, Tang, Ge, and Zhou, rode clouds and passed by Panxi. They saw a white light ascending from Qiu Chuji’s head, knowing his diligent merit was complete and that his fate was at Dragon Gate. The Three Officials transformed into three messengers, bearing three human heads on their backs, and waded across the water at Panxi. Changchun saw them and stopped them: "You three need not take off your feet; I will carry you across." The Three Officials said: "We bear three human heads here; how can you carry us?" Changchun said: "Let me first send these three heads across; then I can carry you." They replied: "These three heads are precious things; if one is lost, our lives are at risk. We must be careful!" Changchun said: "Be at ease; I have carried burdens here for six years without losing a thing." He then sent the three heads across, hung them on branches by the stream, and returned to carry them.

Crossing the stream, a great eagle flew and snatched away one of the heads. Changchun was terrified. The Three Officials feigned alarm: "We told you the heads were precious, not to be lost. Now the eagle has taken one; it endangers our lives. That head was that of a notorious robber turned informer. Losing one, our three lives are in danger." Changchun heard their words and could not bear it. "Can another’s head serve instead?" he asked. The Three Officials said: "When one dies and changes form, another’s head may serve; but now there is none to substitute." Changchun said: "Since another’s head may suffice, and you each carry knives, you might as well cut off my head to replace it." They said: "Since you are willing to sacrifice yourself, there is no need to kill another’s head. We will go with you to the authorities and frankly explain that a cultivator lost a head while carrying people across the water. If the authorities show mercy, you may be spared death." Changchun said: "If so, come with me to this temple; I will cook and we shall eat our fill before journeying together to Chang’an." The Three Officials agreed.

The four entered the temple. The three sat down; Changchun hastened to brew tea and prepare food. Seeing them change into celestial forms, he bowed low and begged for salvation. The Three Officials said: "We are none other than Tang, Ge, and Zhou of the Three Origins. We see you have practiced here six years; your merit is sufficient. You are pure in heart and willing to sacrifice yourself. Your fate is at Dragon Gate Grotto in Longzhou. Quietly refine your inner elixir; when completed, perform transformations and liberations. When your work is fulfilled and merit complete, you may meet at the Golden Palace." Having said this, they vanished like the wind.

Changchun bowed to the empty sky in thanks, then set off for Longzhou. Along the way, he gave alms. Reaching the place called Mingjia Po at Zijia Station in Longzhou, he stayed overnight in an old temple. Continuous rain prevented travel.

In this station lived a rich man named Wang Cunfu, with family assets numbering millions and dozens of mouths to feed. Wang Cunfu was fiery-tempered and fierce, cruel beyond measure. Whenever he saw the poor and destitute, he would not give money or rice; rather he would scold and insult them. Whenever monks or Daoists came to seek alms, he would surely beat and drive them away. The local people gave him a mocking nickname: "Heaven Does Not Forgive." His house was under construction with over a hundred workmen. Before his gate was a sounding stone, struck each meal as a signal.

Changchun, meditating in the temple and hungry, heard the stone struck and took a melon ladle to the gate to offer alms. The workmen, seeing the master begging, gave him some cakes. But Wang Cunfu saw this, rushed out, scolded and beat Changchun, took the cakes, and threw them to the dogs. Changchun bowed and apologized without anger, returning to the temple to preserve stillness.

Wang’s household had a maid named Li Chunhua, twenty years old, who had a spiritual root. That day she saw the official beat and insult the Daoist and take the cakes to feed the dogs. The Daoist smiled and apologized. Knowing he was a man of the Way, and seeing rain block his path so he hid in the temple, she secretly sent cakes to him to ease his hunger. We do not relate further.

Meanwhile, the duty officer early reported Wang Cunfu’s many evils and his mistreatment of the virtuous Daoist, taking the cakes to feed dogs, to the Heavenly Court. The Jade Emperor ordered the Wind Earl, Rain Master, Thunder Division, and Dragon King to command the Celestial Master to proclaim the imperial decree: “Wang Cunfu of Longzhou is wholly evil, with vast wealth but not a shred of good merit in generations. Now he has insulted a man of the Way and taken food to feed dogs. His guilt is great; he shall suffer water disaster. Only the maid Li Chunhua has a good affinity, is not within the doom, and must not be harmed.” The Thunder Gods and Rain Division received the decree and sent the Wild Dream Spirit to Wang’s household to send a dream to Li Chunhua: “Your master is wholly evil; at the hour of the dragon tomorrow he shall suffer water disaster. Because of your good affinity, you are spared the doom. At the hour of the tiger, go to the temple and seek the Daoist; he will save you. Remember well upon waking; I depart.”

Chunhua awoke, knowing it was but a southern branch dream. Reflecting on the words, she found it both credible and doubtful. She hurriedly rose and waited for dawn, then went to the temple. Seeing the master sitting on his mat, she knelt and said: “I am Li Chunhua, maid in Wang’s household. I beg master to save my life; I shall never forget this great kindness.” Changchun opened his eyes, saw her kneeling, and hastened to help her up, asking her cause. Chunhua recounted the dream fully. Changchun went out to observe; indeed dark clouds gathered. He could not bear that the workmen should suffer disaster, so he took Chunhua to the construction site and warned the workers to flee. They believed and quickly escaped. Changchun took Chunhua to the southern mountain five li away, where they hid in a rocky cave. Soon thunder and lightning roared, heavy rain poured, fierce wind blew, and black mist spread. For about an hour the storm lasted; then the wind ceased, the rain stopped, the mist cleared and clouds dispersed. All Wang’s house and people became a wasteland; all had gone to Fusang.

Changchun said to Chunhua: “Your master committed great crimes and so suffered this doom. Because of your good affinity you live. Thus the heavens, though infinitely impartial, use their power for the utmost justice. But his dozens of family were instantly dispatched to the Yellow Springs. How grievous and sorrowful!” They both lamented deeply.

Chunhua knelt and wailed: “Now I have been saved by master and escaped death. You are my parents reborn; how shall I repay this great kindness?” Changchun said: “Do you now see through worldly affairs?” Chunhua answered: “I lost my father when young and mother at seven. Because my family was poor and helpless, my uncle sold me for ten taels of silver to bury my mother. Thus I became a maid in Wang’s house for thirteen years. Morning and evening I longed for the Way but could not escape. What else could I do? It seems my life was not yet ended; the dream spirit pointed me to knock on master’s door and master saved my life. Now I see Wang’s house gone in an instant, people and buildings vanished; all riches and honours gone. I see the red dust as illusion, love and hate as a dream; why should I linger? I beg master to liberate me, adding grace to grace; I shall never forget.” Hearing this, Changchun knew her to have a good root and resolved to guide and transform her. He said: “Since you have sincerely resolved to cultivate the Way, yet have not been tempered, and being a woman, you may suffer demonic harm. Better that you accompany me for a journey to Dragon Gate.” Chunhua kowtowed and answered: “I obey master’s commands and dare not disobey.”

Thus Changchun took Chunhua to Dragon Gate Grotto, giving alms on the way. In a few days they arrived, seeing the mountain and water quiet and secluded, a place of rare beauty. They admired the view:

Horses neigh and monkeys call, mountains echo to the skies;  
Peach blossoms red and willows green, pheasant chicks quarrel in the ravines.  
The herdboy’s wild flute sounds, piercing the layered heavens;  
The woodcutter sings wild songs, his voice heard in the clouded valley.  
Green trees cast deep shade, magpies and hawks contend in graceful dance;  
Springtime splendid, foxes of Zhang compete in dainty steps.  
Exotic grasses and strange flowers perfume the air, a blessed land of Longxi;  
Purple mist and colorful vapors fill the air, famed Zhongnan’s grotto heaven.  
Truly:  
The brushwood gate shuts out the dust of the world,  
The winding path is deep and lonely, where few footfalls tread.

The two traveled and looked, asking of the way. Reaching Dragon Gate Grotto, Changchun looked up and saw the cave was indeed quiet and elegant, distant seven or eight li from human dwellings, with few footprints, a perfect place to cultivate the Way. He dwelt there with Chunhua; by day they begged in the village, by night rested in the cave.

One day he said to Chunhua: “To leave the world is easy; to cultivate the person is hardest. You are a woman’s five-leak body, not like a man. Luckily you have not lost chastity; the elixir is even easier. But monastic life prizes refining the person; those who would refine the person must refine nature. If nature is not pure, the foundation of life cannot stand. To refine nature, one first removes the seven emotions, then cuts off the six thieves. The seven emotions are joy, anger, sorrow, pleasure, greed, desire, and hate; the six thieves are eye, ear, nose, tongue, heart, and mind. The eyes do not observe the five colors, so the eyes are blind and turn inward, and the spirit remains. The ears do not hear the five tones, but listen to the void; the true water congeals. The nose does not smell the five fragrances, the primal breath is calm; the true breath is harmonized. The tongue does not taste the five flavors, licking the upper palate, the primal breath rises. The heart does not cling to myriad attachments, so primal spirit is serene, and wisdom is born. The mind does not dwell on falsehoods; body and mind are at ease. Not coveting fame or profit, the six thieves perish; six desires do not arise; the three poisons are extinguished. When the seven emotions are removed, nature and wisdom are complete; when nature and wisdom are complete, the light of wisdom shines. The art of cultivating life is attained, and the Way of long life and eternal fate is fulfilled. Having obtained the Way of long life, the golden liquid and elixir are not far off.”

Thus it is:

The Way’s essence is non-action, nature’s law;  
Dusty heart cleansed, return to primordial heaven.  
Refine to original nature shining like the moon;  
And become an immortal in Penglai, Yingzhou, or Langyuan.

If you would know the later fate of Qiu and Li, wait for the next chapter’s unfolding.
