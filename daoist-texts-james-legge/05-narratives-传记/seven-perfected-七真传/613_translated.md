# Chapter Fourteen: Qiu Chuji Attains the Way and Converts the Hu; Tan Changzhen Manifests Spirit and Expels Demons

A Poem:

The elixir of nine refinements returns to the Great Void,  
Perfect brightness and original nature are true thusness.  
The Yang Spirit enters and departs without obstruction,  
At will roaming at ease, delight abundant.  
Westward to convert the Hu, called Zhenduan,  
Eastward to ten thousand lands, learning Huaxu.  
Guiding all the cultivators squarely and rightly,  
Together they proceed to dwell in Pengying and the Orchid Courtyard.

It is related how Qiu Changchun imparted to Li Chunhua the art of firmly establishing the foundation and prolonging life. They dwelt together for several months; by day sometimes observing fasts, sometimes gathering herbs; by evening they would discourse on the Way or nurture the spirit. Because they dwelt together as man and woman, fearing to cause confusion among the people, he bade Chunhua feign madness and go forth into the villages to receive alms, thereby tempering body and mind. Chunhua took leave of his master and descended the mountain.

Each day, Changchun rose early and rested late, settled himself in seven families, living according to circumstances, without regard to amount, taking things as they came. After several more months, he sighed and said, “Time passes swiftly, and the cultivation of the Way is hard to accomplish. To cultivate the Golden Liquid and Reverted Elixir requires reliance on method, wealth, companions, and place. Now the method and place are acquired, but wealth and companions are wanting; difficult to begin the work.”

While thus pondering, a man appeared, no more than thirty years of age, with a high forehead and broad eyebrows, his bearing commanding, his spirit lofty. Changchun thought to himself, “If this man will join my mysterious gate, he will surely become a mainstay in the future.” The man entered the cave, making the disciple’s salute to Changchun, prostrating himself deeply. Changchun hastened to return the salute and said, “Sir, you are mistaken! I am but a poor Daoist; you seem a disciple of the Confucian school. Why then do you offer such great salutation? Is it not excessive?” The man replied, “Master need not modestly deny. I have come in search of the Way. From afar I saw the coloured clouds surrounding this cave, white vapour rising to heaven. Now seeing your eyes filled with spirit, I know you are no ordinary person, and so I come specially to follow you as master. I beg your compassion to take me in, to guide one who is lost, that I may ever remember your grace.” Changchun asked, “From what place do you hail? What is your noble surname and given name? And why have you come here?” The man answered, “I am Zhao Yuantong, from Xinye County, Nanyang Prefecture in Henan. In youth I studied poetry and books, fully understanding Confucian rites. The villagers all call me an ancient man. Because I love the Way and do not seek Confucian fame, my father and brothers say I am a pedantic scholar. I have seen that fame and gain are vain and fleeting; the dust of the world is cold and indifferent; glory and wealth are but a dream at the southern branch of the mulberry tree. Time passes swiftly and is unstable. Therefore I abandoned home to seek the Way, striving earnestly for the profound. If the kind master will take pity and save this disciple, it would be a blessing for many lifetimes.”  

Changchun said, “From what you say, your heart is truly set on abandoning the world to learn the Way. I have one word to say; will you hear it?” Yuantong replied, “If the master has words, I will surely receive instruction.” Changchun said, “This very morning I was thinking thus: ‘To cultivate the supreme mysterious功 (Gong), one must rely on method, wealth, companions, and place.’ Now I have method and place, but wealth and companions remain incomplete. Fortunate am I to meet you; can you help me complete the elixir?” Yuantong answered, “Now I am accepted by the master’s kindness, and to protect the master is my duty.” Changchun said, “So it is: then burn incense and pay respects to the ancestral masters. I will change your name to Daojian, with the title Xujing.” Yuantong accordingly burned incense, held a candle, and worshipped the ancestral masters, then came before his master and bowed eight times. He took from his person two hundred taels of silver and presented them to his master, saying, “This silver may be used by master as capital for the Way.” Changchun said, “Those who leave the world should not covet wealth nor love beauty. Now you have true heart to protect me—it is the same indeed.” So he accepted the silver. From then on, with wealth and companions to support, inner功 (Gong) advanced daily.

Zhao Xujing saw his master single-minded in cultivation and took up the true resolve to protect the Way, never leaving his side by day or night. The good Way men of Longzhou, hearing of Changchun’s attainment, all came to submit and uphold him, bringing grain, vegetables, chopping wood, fetching water. Changchun cultivated the inner elixir for several months; the great medicine was near completion.

One day, the governor of Longzhou came to the cave to host a feast in honour of the master, inviting him to discourse on the Way and virtue. Changchun reluctantly lingered half a day with him. That night the mercury ran and lead flew; the elixir was lost, and all previous功 (Gong) was undone. The next day he told his disciples, “When you come to work here, you must be cautious and careful. My great medicine was near completion, but yesterday I lingered half a day with the governor, causing the inner功 to be mislaid. Last night the elixir was lost and all prior功 abandoned. Is this not grievous? You who come hereafter, must be wary. The Way cannot be for a moment forsaken; if it may be forsaken, it is not the Way.”

Changchun once more began anew, ever watchful. After three months of refining, the great medicine was accomplished. Then employing the great cycle of the grand Zhou, he forged the Golden Liquid and Reverted Elixir. For ten months he nurtured the embryo, and for three years nourished it by suckling. While in tranquil stillness within the cave, he suddenly saw mountains collapse and rocks fall; yet his mind did not waver. He saw himself giving alms and food, accepting not a grain or a fraction. He saw beautiful women and fine objects, yet the heart was not attached. Endless transformations, a thousand illusions, he was untouched and ungrasping. He saw tigers, wolves, snakes, and insects, yet was neither startled nor afraid. Only then did the Yang Spirit appear.

The master said to all disciples, “All who cultivate the Way, when功 (Gong) reaches this stage, face manifold demonic hindrances which must be vigilantly guarded against. Sometimes Heaven sends tests to try the Way-farer; sometimes there are demon foxes, ghost chiefs, mountain spirits, and stone monsters that exhaust one's spirit and energy; sometimes there are grudges from past lives, or karmic obstacles of this present; sometimes yin demons cause dreams and stupor; sometimes yang demons affect kinsfolk and relatives. Let there be a thousand kinds of demonic illusions, ten thousand forms of temptation; one must not be attached to any. If one is caught by a single demon, then the great Way is not accomplished. It is said, ‘The Way rises one measure, the demon rises ten.’ Every time a demon passes by, my heart becomes clearer; ten times the demon comes, my heart is tenfold clearer. I warn the later students: when the demon realm comes, be ever watchful!”

Qiu Changchun cultivated in the Dragon Gate Cave for seven years, diligently without slackening, seeking the profound in stillness. From nothing he refined something, unburdened by worldly dust and passion, unafraid of cold or heat. Free and unmindful of years, he attained the Way, unaware of spring or autumn. Fearing the Yang Spirit would not age, he employed three more years of great stillness to silently nurture the original spirit, thereby perfecting both form and spirit, harmonizing with the true Way.

At that time, Li Chunhua also came seeking the Way. The master taught him the Way, saying, “I will now change your name to Zhen Duo. I give you the Way of the Golden Liquid and Reverted Elixir. Be cautious and diligent in cultivation, and the elixir Way can be perfected. When功 (Gong) is full and fruit complete, external功 must also be cultivated. When the fruit of the Way is full, we shall meet again. But this Way must not be transmitted to the unworthy, lest it bring guilt and calamity. Be cautious, be careful!” Li Zhen Duo bowed in thanks and departed, later attaining fruition. This will not be further recorded. Changchun again imparted the art of prolonging life and eternal longevity to Zhao Xujing. At that time there was a man from Longxi named Song Da’an, who also received the commands of Master Changchun.

The master wished to journey westward to roam many lands, to convert the lost multitudes, to accumulate功 for summons, and so he composed a regulated verse:

Cultivate self, choosing not for wisdom or folly,  
Only the heart sincere and the will firm.  
Cut desire, remove passion, walk the Way of virtue,  
Benefit others, lose self, study the immortals.  
Six years in the coiled valley, a thousand demons purged,  
Seven years at Dragon Gate, ten thousand deeds complete.  
Awaiting the decree to proclaim the elixir book,  
I shall ride the crane to ascend the Jade Heaven.

Having chanted the poem, he then instructed the disciples, “I now journey westward through many lands, to convert all beings. You must diligently cultivate without slackening, and not disobey my instructions.” The disciples each knelt to see him off, begging to know the time of his return. The master said, “For this journey westward through many lands, the time of return is uncertain. When you perceive the incense winds coming from the west, that is my return.” Having spoken, he took a small spade in hand, a mat on his back, descended the mountain, and went westward. The disciples accompanied him for ten li, then returned.

Zhao Xujing, seeing his master depart westward, cultivated virtue and conduct with care, kept the pure rules, gathered alms, and built houses; within a few years he transformed Dragon Gate Cave into a celestial mansion and jade palace. This matter is not recorded further.

It is told that Tan Changzhen, after parting with his elder brothers in Xianyang, journeyed westward to Shu. He begged alms on the road for more than two months before entering Chengdu. One day, walking in the street, he saw a mad woman approaching. Changzhen recognized her as a possessed one with the Way and hastened to salute her. The mad woman raised her hand and struck him with a fist, knocking him to the ground, two front teeth broken, blood pouring from his mouth. Changzhen rose, uttering words of apology with no anger. The mad woman laughed, saying, “One punch drives away many past misdeeds. We shall meet again; soon you will attain the true Way.” She clasped her hands and departed.

The reader would wonder who this mad woman truly was, and it must be revealed. She was He Yuchan, having attained the Way with Zhongyang, who after parting with Chongyang, wandered to accumulate功 and guide the lost. Passing through Emei and Qingcheng regions and then Chengdu, she saw Tan Changzhen, knowing him a disciple of Zhongyang, and so struck him with a test punch to gauge his功. Seeing that Changzhen lost two teeth but bore no anger in heart, she knew this youth would surely attain the great Way, and left this poem. When Changzhen attains the Way, the poem may be continued. Those on the street saw Changzhen struck and bleeding, and hurried to him, bowing and apologizing. Not knowing the mad woman was an immortal, they thought Changzhen a Buddha and praised him greatly.

In Chengdu city, Changzhen came to the northeast corner and saw an ancient temple, quiet and serene, and took to sitting in meditation there. Many believers in goodness saw him at this temple; sometimes he went out for a meal, sometimes after days’ absence he would return. Seeing he had the Way, many gave money and rice to protect him. Changzhen desired to refine the great elixir; outwardly he had protectors and wealth, but inwardly lacked sincere companions to protect him, making it difficult to begin work.

One day suddenly a young scholar appeared, coming forward to pay respects and seek the Way, wishing to be a disciple. He was Li Henian from Mianzhu in northern Sichuan, of a family of school teachers. Henian was quiet from youth, disliking frivolity, observing filial piety and brotherly respect, fond of reading alchemical scriptures. At twenty-four years, unmarried and unindulgent, he was single-minded in learning the Way. He traveled to Qingcheng in search of the Way but found no man of the Way. Turning to Chengdu city to inquire, he heard that an ancient Guan Di temple in the east city had a Daoist who might be said to have the Way, so he sought the temple and met Changzhen, sensing his aura of the Way and desiring to become a disciple. Changzhen saw his sincerity and accepted him.

Later another came to join the master, a man from Chengzhou named Zhang Shoudao, aged thirty-two. He traded salt at Liugongjing in eastern Sichuan and had long renounced the dust of the world. Traveling in Chengdu, seeing the master’s Way, he took Changzhen as master. Changzhen changed his name to Daoqing and Li Henian’s to Daojing.

With these two sons to guard and aid him, Changzhen began work. After three years, the embryo was complete, the spirit emerged, harmonizing spirit and transformation, wondrous and unfathomable, having a body outside the body. One day going out to discourse with guests on the Way and virtue, the disciples were amazed and said, “Our master Daojing has been in quiet cultivation for more than three years without going out; why does he now come forth to speak with guests?” Returning to the room, they saw the master sitting on the elixir bed. Rushing outside, they saw another master outside. Zhang Daoqing invited all to look, and saw the same. They dared not inquire further. After the guests departed, seeing their master send them out the door, he suddenly vanished. Returning to the room and inquiring of the master, Changzhen answered, “The great Way returns complete; spirit and transformation appear and vanish according to place. The one outside is my spirit. When the Way is high, one body transforms into many bodies, appearing and vanishing throughout the ten directions, not confined to a single person.” Thus the disciples came to understand that their master’s Yang Spirit went forth, a body outside the body, and all praised and discussed him. This will not be further recorded.

Meanwhile, the prefect of Chengdu, Yan Bangfu, had a son named Yan Yan who was beguiled by a fox spirit and became ill, with no remedy. Hearing that the ancient Guan Di temple had a Daoist named Tan, the prefect personally came to the temple to offer incense and beseech Tan Xian to expel the demon. Changzhen asked Zhang Daoqing to accompany him to linger with the prefect, then retired to meditate awhile and wrote two talismans, giving them to Yan Bangfu, saying, “Sir, take these two talismans; put one on the door of the room, and have your son wear the other on his head. After forty-nine days, this demon will never return. Burn the talismans and have your son consume the ashes; it will not only expel evil and drive away spirits but also cure disease and prolong life.” Bangfu said, “If my son’s demon is expelled and he recovers, I will have him join the immortal master’s sect. This prefecture will protect you and rebuild this ancient temple.” So taking the two talismans, he returned to the office, and Changzhen saw him out of the mountain gate. This will not be further recorded.

Back at the office, the family reported, “Soon after you left today, a Daoist came claiming to catch demons for the young master. When asked his name and residence, he said he was sent by you and you knew him. He entered the young master’s room, struck a thunderclap, and a fox appeared in the room. The Daoist drove it out, and the fox vanished without a trace. This is indeed strange!” The prefect suspected, “Could it be that Tan Xian manifested his power? Truly a great marvel!” He affixed the two talismans as directed, and sure enough the demon was expelled and the illness cured. This will not be further recorded.

It is told that on the day Bangfu went to the temple to entreat Tan Xian, the master manifested his Yang Spirit and early arrived at the prefecture, striking a thunderclap with the palm; the demon fox was frightened away. Afterwards the fox spirit returned to the door, saw the talisman guarding it, and transformed into a sparrow to fly through the window. Near the bed it saw Yan Yan wearing the talisman and guarded by divine generals, and dared not approach. Repeatedly it tried and dared not be rash, and sorrowfully departed. After consuming the ashes of the talisman, true qi returned to his body, and the fox never dared come again.

The prefect, seeing his son recovered and the demon gone, took Yan Yan to the temple and ordered him to worship Tan Xian as master, while arranging work to rebuild the temple. Thereafter, the fame spread far and wide, and disciples were countless. Tan Zhenren painted a “Turtle and Snake Picture” and gave it to the prefect, saying, “There is fire hazard nearby. Hang this picture, and it will quench the fire. It should be treasured.” Yan Bangfu opened it and saw a turtle and a snake; from the snake’s mouth came fire, from the turtle’s mouth came water to quench the fire. Not many days later, a great fire swept the city; the prefect hastened to bring the picture to quell the fire, spreading it in hanging; the fire ceased. The prefect rejoiced, believing it a precious treasure, knowing Tan Xian’s Daoist power was great.

Tan Zhenren, seeing the sect flourishing and daily bustling, took leave of the multitude, saying he would roam and convert to accumulate功, and departed. The disciples would not detain him. He transmitted the Great Elixir Way to Zhang Daoqing. The disciples saw him off for ten li, begging for a future meeting. Tan Zhenren said, “You all cultivate diligently without slackening; when功 is full and fruit complete, we shall meet again.” He swept his sleeves and departed. He left a sect poem of homage:

The Way is founded on venerating truth,  
Profound and subtle as the immortal.  
The method ascends beyond the clouds,  
功 achieved brings certain fame.  
The great teaching bright and pure,  
Broadly unfolds virtue, only good.  
Realizing the primordial luminous nature,  
One mind returns to perfect harmony.

Among Tan Zhenren’s disciples were several dozen, yet only Zhang and Li attained the Way and completed fruition. This will not be further recorded.

Tan Zhenren roamed widely, accumulating功 to await summons. At Jiazhou’s Mount Da’e, he manifested spirit and played in the realm, leisurely content. Suddenly he thought on his first arrival at Chengdu, meeting the mad immortal woman and her words, and so composed a final poem on the summit of Mount Emei:

In former days abandoning dust to seek the Way,  
The immortal woman saw through the rules in the tube.  
One punch drove off many past misdeeds,  
Emerging from the Yang Spirit she dwells alone.
