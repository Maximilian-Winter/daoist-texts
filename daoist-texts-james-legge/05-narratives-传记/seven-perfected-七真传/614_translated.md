# Chapter Fifteen: Liu Chuxuan the Prince Consort Imprisoned, Prays for Rain; Hao Taigu Instructs at Zhaozhou Bridge

Verses:

The Immortals are easily sought,  
Yet some do not cultivate, while others do.  
Once the work is accomplished, mounting the crane they roam,  
Their yang spirits released, they are free and untrammeled in the breeze.  
Beneath the bridge, leisurely they dwell,  
Nurturing the spirit through days uncounted,  
Saving lives, men and ghosts, without enmity.  
They escort young maidens together to the Isles of the Blest,  
Their merit and conduct enduring through antiquity without end.  
(Tune: The New Moon Sinks the Hook)

Now it is related that the Perfected Man Tan Changzhen, having finished chanting poetry in the delightful scenes of Emei, descended the mountain and wished to journey to Yuzhou for pleasure. Upon reaching the borders of Huzhou, at night he saw the Water Star emitting radiance, but the Fire Star was dim, and the Earth Star lacked light, all amidst the spirits of the wells. Reflecting thus, he knew that great floods were imminent in that region, and, pitying the people dwelling in the lowlands who would be engulfed, he went about warning all to flee swiftly and without delay. In less than three days, indeed, the great flood came. Many hundreds of families were grateful for his blessings. From then on, he accumulated merit and honour. We do not further relate this matter.

Meanwhile, Liu Changsheng Zizai, departing Shaanxi after bidding farewell to his elder brothers in the Way, divined destinies and wandered through Zhongnan. He met Master Lü, who again imparted essential teachings of the Dao. Afterwards, he came to Wudang Mountain, where in quiet he refined the elixir to completion. Then he journeyed to Xiangzhou, where he obtained the guardian spirit Tianran and in tranquil nurturing remained four years, at last attaining transformation of body and spirit. Having fulfilled the Way, he wished to cross the Xiang River but found no boat. Liu Zhenren therefore cast his umbrella aloft, soaring through the air and passing over the river. The crowd seeing this knew him for an immortal and burned incense in worship. No more shall we relate.

Liu Zhenren, having passed the Xiang River, sought to visit the land of swimming banners. There he saw an old woman holding a dead child, crying until he seemed revived. Standing beside her was a middle-aged woman also wailing without ceasing. The Perfected Man inquired the cause. An old man said: "These two, mother-in-law and daughter-in-law, are both widows. Their family has five branches but no heirs, only this child, who died of smallpox. Their ancestors for generations were known for accumulated goodness; why then do they suffer this reproach of extinction? Is it not cause for sorrowful lamentation?" Hearing this, Liu Changsheng's heart was moved with pity for the five branches without posterity and the lonely mother-in-law and daughter-in-law, also counting the ancestral merits which might yet rescue the child from death. Drawing near, he called out: "Mother, do not weep so; bring this little child to me that I may see if he can yet be saved." The two women, hearing the words of this Taoist, declared: "If he can be saved," and hastened to bring the dead child forward. Liu Zhenren examined him and said, "He can be saved, he can be saved. Go and fetch the rootless water." The mother and daughter-in-law did not know what rootless water was. An elder explained: "Rootless water is that which falls from heaven, not yet having touched earth; hence it is called rootless." Hastily the old woman sought the water.

This word stirred all the old and young in the place to come and watch. Before long the old woman brought the rootless water. Liu Zhenren placed the elixir he had refined into the child's mouth, pried open the jaws with a hard object, and poured the rootless water down his throat. The Perfected Man then took the true qi of the five directions and blew it into the child's abdomen. In a brief space, the limbs grew warm and breath gently stirred from the nose and mouth. The child gradually revived. The two women prostrated themselves and said: "If not for the immortal descending to earth, how could this child live? He is the reincarnation of our grandson. Had not the immortal saved him, even we mother and daughter-in-law would have followed to the Nine Springs!" Hastening, Liu Zhenren raised them and said: "Since taking my elixir today, not only shall you revive from death, but your whole life shall be free from sickness, and you may attain longevity. This day’s rescue is the fruit of your ancestors’ accumulated goodness." Thus saying, he floated away. The two women wished to detain him but could not, and so painted his image for daily worship. All who saw were amazed and declared him truly an immortal. Afterwards a temple was built there in honour of Liu Xian, and prayers there were answered with spiritual efficacy. But that is a later tale, and we do not relate it here.

Meanwhile, Liu Zhenren journeyed north to Haizhou, where the weather was fiercely dry and the people were unruly. The prefect set up an altar and commanded monks and Taoists to pray for rain, but no response came. Angered, the prefect issued orders to arrest all monks and Taoists, and those seen were seized and imprisoned in the Prince Consort’s Prison, numbering over three hundred. At that time Liu Zhenren was also confined therein. The prefect commanded: "These monks and Taoists are held in the Prince Consort Prison, and shall not be given food. Only when rain falls shall they be released. If the heavens do not send rain, they shall all starve to death, so as to prevent their pernicious words from misleading the people. Their continuance is of no benefit to the world." The monks and Taoists, confined without food for three days, wailed sorrowfully, crying aloud: "If for seven days no rain falls, we shall all become starving ghosts!" Each lamented and wept bitterly.

Then Liu Zhenren’s heart was moved with compassion. He thought: "Though these monks and Taoists do not observe their precepts and have corrupted the teaching, and thus deserve this calamity, yet to confound the good and the bad so is to regard the Way lightly. I will accumulate merit, both for the people and for these monks and Taoists." That night he sent forth his yang spirit, went to the temple, took a large wooden fish, carried it to the rear office of the prefect, and began to beat it. The sound made fire flash in the prefect’s eyes and smoke issue from his mouth. Hastily he went to the hall and dispatched officers to seize the source.

The officers searched the four quarters but could hear only the wooden fish striking in the rear office, seeing no person anywhere, and returned with their report. The prefect himself investigated and found the same. Helpless, he called out loudly: "What monk or Taoist art thou that employest the art of invisibility to strike a fish here? What form dost thou assume? Come forth and speak!" Liu Changsheng answered from the air: "I now do not transform into other forms, but only assist these monks and Taoists imprisoned in the Prince Consort Prison." The prefect said: "Since thou hast the art of invisibility, thou must also have the method of praying for rain. Why then dost thou not pray for rain to relieve the people’s suffering and accumulate great merit?" Liu Zhenren said: "It is no difficulty for me to pray for rain. If you will but fulfil three things, I will surely cause heavy rain to fall and the people to rejoice in their labours." The prefect asked: "Pray, what are those three things?" Liu Zhenren said: "First, tomorrow at dawn, release all these monks and Taoists from the Prince Consort Prison and treat them generously with offerings; second, erect a pure and lofty altar three zhang and six chi high in a wild place, with incense and candles complete; third, you, the prefect, and your lady shall personally lead the county gentry and these monks and Taoists to assemble at the altar, bowing on all sides, and until the rain falls do not depart or cover yourselves. Wait until the rain ceases before turning back. If any leave early, they shall be struck by thunder; moreover, if the crowd disperses the rain will cease and fail to suffuse the land, rendering the prayers vain. Be mindful and careful!" The prefect replied: "If the Master can pray for sweet rain to fall and the people receive blessings, your three requests shall be obeyed." Liu Zhenren returned to prison. We do not relate further.

Now this prefect's family name was Liu, given name Bangzheng. He hailed from Bianjing in Henan, having passed the imperial examinations with distinction. In official station at Haizhou, he was somewhat benevolent. Hearing the words of the Perfected Man that at the time of rain no one should avoid or cover themselves, he thought: "At such a time of drought and midsummer, though the rain be cold and soak the body, it will not harm." He sent forth orders to the gentry and elders, and commanded the building of the altar and preparation of offerings. By the next day at dawn all was ready, and the city gentry and elders had gathered. The prefect commanded that all monks and Taoists imprisoned in the Prince Consort Prison be released to partake of offerings.

These monks and Taoists, starving black-eyed and weak-kneed, suddenly called out from prison to eat. Each thought: "This prefect surely intends to starve us to death, yet now he releases us and provides offerings. Could it be that some Bodhisattva has enlightened him?" The officers said: "You have been favoured! Last night an immortal without form came to the rear office and struck the wooden fish, gathering funds to relieve your suffering. The prefect commanded him to pray for rain to save the people, hence your lives are spared." The monks and Taoists then knew of this and debated: "Who is this master who descended and saved our lives?" Rejoicing, they attended the offerings and together went to the great hall to prostrate and give thanks.

Prefect Liu commanded: "You gentlemen of the gentry, elders, monks, Taoists, soldiers, and people, all learned and ignorant alike, assemble on both sides of the altar. Await the Master’s ascent to pray for rain. Each with sincere heart shall worship without stirring other thoughts. When the rain falls, none shall avoid or cover themselves, nor depart early to avoid thunder’s wrath. If any transgress, they shall be punished!" All obeyed, assembling at the altar to await. Prefect Liu and his lady also arrived in sedan chairs beneath the altar. Seeing all assembled but no Master on the platform, the prefect called loudly: "All three things are prepared; please invite the Master to ascend." No sooner had he spoken than a Taoist appeared on the platform, his attire as follows:

On his head a lotus-leaf kerchief, a bright full moon;  
His body clad in crane-feather cloak and jacket, his sleeves the pure breeze.  
In his hand a pure dust whisk, solemn as a goddess of Peng and Ying descending to earth;  
His feet shod with many-eared shoes, surpassing the Perfected of the Jade Garden.  
His lips as if painted vermilion, his eyes emit golden rays in all directions;  
His face as powder-flourished, his whole frame of jade-like moist texture.  
With the command tablet sounding, the thunder-god is startled and thunder rolls;  
Reciting incantations, he summons the rain host to descend sweet dew.  
Truly it is: were it not for Liu Xian’s power of the Way, how could all things be revived?

Prefect Liu seeing this Master ascend, bearing the celestial aura and Daoist bones, with extraordinary appearance, together with his lady bowed down. The gentry, monks, and Taoists beside also bowed their hearts and heads.

Liu Zhenren ascended the altar, burned a talisman, chanting sacred words, striking the command tablet once, when the Dragon King promptly stirred clouds and spread mists. Next he burned two talismans, struck the tablet twice, and thunder roared explosively. Again he chanted incantations, burned three talismans, struck the tablet thrice, and thunder and lightning flashed, rain pouring in torrents. The officials, gentry, monks, Taoists, soldiers, and people dared not avoid it, enduring the rain for a long while until it ceased and the clouds dispersed, the floodwaters rising a cubit or more over the plain. When Liu Zhenren descended, his person was dry, and all bowed their hearts in worship.

The Perfected Man addressed the crowd: "You prayed today for rain; I have washed away your faults and offenses. Being monks and Taoists, you entered the cloister and took vows but refused to strive in cultivation, thus committing sinful obstacles and deserving this calamity. Fortunate that I came to save your lives. Henceforth you must all set forth good thoughts and turn from past to future cultivation. Today’s rain can cleanse your hearts and bodies; do not repeat former errors, so you may escape the bitterness of rebirth." Turning to the prefect, he said: "You, a disciple of Confucianism, study poetry and books, understand rites and righteousness. Now, as ruler of this prefecture, you work for the state above and share the burden with the people below. How can you not comprehend the principles of the three teachings? Your setting up of the altar to pray for rain without success is your fault. You should have offered fasting, charity, and good deeds, guiding the people to turn from evil and cultivate good, thus moving the human heart to move Heaven’s heart. When Heaven’s heart is aligned, rain will fall freely, and things will flourish and people be at peace. This is your duty as official. You failed to do good, imprisoned monks and Taoists to starve in the Prince Consort Prison. Had I not come here, the more than three hundred would have died unjustly, their grievances unavenged, passing retaliation on and on without end. You have committed this great sin; how will you settle it in the future? Quickly repent and awaken. Today I cleanse you so you may not defile yourself again, nor sink into the sea of misery." So saying, he swept his sleeve and departed. The people bowed and worshipped, yet could not detain him, each kissing hands and escorting him forth.

This region, having received this rain, found its people peaceful and its wealth increased. The prefect then wrote memorials to build a temple to Liu Xian, where incense has burned without ceasing through the generations. But that is a later tale, and we do not relate it here.

Now it happened that Hao Taigu, having parted from his brothers in Xianyang, travelled widely throughout the land. He came to Jiangzhou and visited Mount Kuanglu, where he met an extraordinary man who discoursed on the Way and instructed him in the principles of the Yi, sharpening his skill in divination. Later he came to Yangzhou, guiding the ignorant, staying there over a year, and his fame spread far and wide. Reflecting on the swift passage of time and the peril of not hastening cultivation, he resolved to select a place and employ workers. But unable to find a suitable locality, he journeyed north. At Zhaozhou’s borders, he saw a great bridge, lofty and broad beyond measure. In times of drought, the river dried to its bed; in floods it rose but half the river’s depth. On the south side was a small cave fit for three persons to sit, neither wet nor sullied, a place of quietude. This bridge was named Zhao Bridge, built by the ancient master Lu Ban. When the bridge was completed, the immortal Zhang Guolao once brought Han Nu riding a mule across it; stepping outward, he toppled two layers of bridge stones. The bridge bore mule tracks several deep inches, marks of the immortal’s passage. On both sides of this bridge lay densely populated villages. Hao Taigu took his seat beneath the bridge to rest in peace, and when hungry went out for alms.

In the southern village lived a girl surnamed Teng, named Yungu, aged fourteen. Her family had parents and brothers and were given to kindness. Yet Yungu had from youth a predestined root, eating no meat and chanting scriptures, disliking the noisy world. Seeing Taigu living beneath the bridge for over a month, silent and speaking to none, sitting quietly in the hollow, she knew he was extraordinary. Yungu and her mother agreed to send food daily and often accompany him. Taigu knew her had a root in her being, and sometimes spoke words of self-cultivation. Yungu awakened and took Taigu as her Master. Taigu said: "Your heart’s source is clear and deep, you have long been destined; in the future you shall have a share in ascending to immortality. Now, fortunate that your heavenly destiny is not yet spent, your passions not yet stirred, cultivation is easier. I now teach you the Way of the Three Ones; by practising it you may avoid leakage of the body. But now I wish to nurture the embryo and regulate the spirit; this requires a companion. I appoint you guardian for three years. When my work is accomplished, then I shall bring you across." Yungu said: "When Master’s Way is fulfilled, your disciple will guard as commanded."

Taigu rejoiced and began his work. Yungu attended diligently morning and evening for three years. Taigu’s Golden Elixir attained completion; hunger and thirst ceased; he transcended birth and death, his spirit foreknowing the future.

One night, beneath the bridge, two ghosts spoke: "At noon tomorrow there will come one wearing an iron hat to relieve my suffering." One ghost congratulated and departed. At noon the next day, it rained throughout the world, and a man was seen with an iron pot on his head, descending the bridge to wash his feet. Taigu stopped him, but the man left. In the evening several ghosts gathered. One asked: "You said that at noon today someone would relieve your suffering; why did you not go?" Another answered: "When he came, that gentleman stopped him and he left, so he failed to take our place." The ghosts were angry: "This man is unreasonable in loving life! He has sat beneath this bridge for years and we never harmed him, yet he comes to harm us? Now we shall seize him to take our place." The ghosts pressed on but found no trace, saying: "Just now he sat here meditating; how is he gone so suddenly?" The ghosts sighed and departed.

Taigu said to Yungu: "Ghosts are pure yin in nature; immortals are pure yang in body. One who attains the Way has myriad deities to protect him. Immortals desire to destroy ghosts, which is easy; ghosts desire to harm immortals, which is difficult." The ghosts sought but could not find him; Hao Zhenren’s spirit returned to emptiness, his body shrouded in golden light—how could ghosts perceive him?

At that time the people of Zhaozhou all believed Taigu to be a man of the Way and came to guard and protect him, their numbers increasing daily, wishing with their master to build a temple. Taigu, weary of such vexation, departed with Yungu to Mount Hua. There Yungu bade farewell to parents and brothers, following her master to the Western Peak, living by alms and refining her mind and character. Truly it is as the verse says:

With single heart they yearn for the Way and learn immortality,  
Forgetting the myriad hardships of mortal life.  
It is laughable that nowadays some feign this;  
Yet think themselves worthy to sit and ascend to Heaven.

If one wishes to know the later affairs of Hao and Teng, listen to the next chapter unfold.
