# Chapter Sixteen: Bai Yuchan Renounces the Mortal Heart in Quest of the Dao and Virtue; Master Qiu Changchun Crosses the World to the West

Verse:

The work is deep, the retribution natural;  
When conduct is complete, ascension is certain.  
Firm heart and bitter will must never rest;  
The secret lies in seeking with a humble breast.  
The journey Westward is dark and profound,  
The fiery nature of Investiture not yet drowned.  
If one views these as common tales,  
The portals of immortals remain veiled and veiled.  
(From the tune "Drunken High Song")

Now it is told how Hao Taigu, leading Yun Gu, followed fate along the way, passing Shanxi, crossing the Yellow River, and ascending the Western Mountain, Mount Hua, to cultivate. Employing divine craft, he hollowed out a cave in the precipitous back wall of the summit of Mount Hua, and took residence therein. Outside, iron stakes were driven into the rocks, joined by nine connected wooden rafters, so that persons might come and go with ease. He then taught the Way to Yun Gu. The two did not take fire-cooked food, but gathered herbs such as polygonatum, yam, and lily on the mountain to serve as sustenance. Hao Zhenren ordered Yun Gu to dwell opposite the cave, cultivating the Way until perfected. Her body became covered in hair, her steps as swift as flight; those who beheld her would start back and cling to the rock wall. This cave was henceforth called by posterity the "Hairy Woman's Cave."

Hao Zhenren further opened seventy-two more caves to facilitate future generations in nourishing the Way. At that time, seekers of the Way climbed the mountain to look for instruction, their numbers growing day by day. Hao Zhenren then descended the mountain to wander, accumulating merit, awaiting the imperial summons to ascend; he left behind this verse to mark the Hua Mountain school:

To the One the Supreme Way,  
Revering the teaching, unfolding Complete Truth.  
The source is virtue, harmony, and rectitude,  
Benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and faith.  
Auspicious signs govern the universe,  
All principles return to origin and flow.  
Pure quietness opens to subtle transformations,  
Realize your nature, perceive sincerity and clarity.

Now in Qiongzhou there was Bai Yuchan, whose original surname was Ge, a native of Minqing County in Fuzhou, serving the Dong religion in Qiongzhou. His father was named Zhenye. On the fifteenth day of the third month in the Jia-yin year of the Shaoxing era of Song Gaozong, his mother dreamed of a Daoist who bestowed a jade toad upon her; she then gave birth to a son, named Yuchan. As he grew older, he was also called Chang Geng. His grandfather and father passed away in succession, and his mother remarried, whereupon he changed his surname to Bai and styled himself Qiong Guan. From his youth he was quick-witted and intelligent. At ten years old he sailed westward to Guangzhou to take the boy’s examination; the examiner was the Master of Fate, who assigned him to compose a poem on the loom. He responded with:

The great earth, mountains, and rivers form the loom,  
Hundred flowers are brocade, willows are silk.  
In the emptiness a bolt is made,  
Sun and moon twin shuttles fly beyond heaven.

But the Master of Fate deemed his words wild and did not accept them; Yuchan then turned away with a wave of his sleeve.

At sixteen, he devoted himself wholly to learning immortality, resolute to pursue the Way, though he had but three hundred cash in his purse. At first, leaving his home mountain, he knew not where to lodge by night; as the sun set and crows cried, he hastily sought shelter. After several days’ travel he reached the city of Zhangzhou, having sold all his clothes, and found no kin; he lodged at a lonely inn by the river village. The next day he set out with only an umbrella in hand. Struggling, he reached the borders of Xinghua, where wind and rain fell; it was the time of spring’s departure, and there he wished to return but could not, so he begged alms to sate his hunger. After another ten days’ journey he came to Luoyuan and Fusi, where he offered himself as servant; within half a month he parted with the abbot. On a blazing summer day, barefoot he ran, flesh bleeding with sweat, pain unspeakable. At Jiangpu, autumn rains fell drearily; with no hat or umbrella to cover his head, he looked about but found no path. Hearing that the people of Jianning prefecture were all kindly, he journeyed there to seek life. Stretching out his hands in the thoroughfares, who pitied the beggar boy? He entered the Monastery of Compassion to mingle and rest briefly. Later he ascended Mount Wuyi, where a Daoist scolded him for his poverty and disgrace to the sect’s customs; he wept and descended the mountain. He sought the Supreme Palace of Longhu Mountain, where he visited the successor master, but the guest attendant despised his ragged clothes. He went straight northeast, passing Raozhou and crossing Poyang Lake, reaching Jiankang, where war was raging; the Hua and Si armies burned, corpses heaped on the roads, and the fields were bare of grass. Passing into Jiangdong during the dog days’ heat, his family hid in mountain caves. Travellers in Zhejiang felt the chill of approaching autumn. He lodged overnight at an ancient temple in Wulin, where heavy snow fell for seven days; by good fortune his youthful spirit was not lost, and he revived from near death. Reflecting on his desolation, he wished to seek death, but comforted himself thus: "The great task of cultivating the Way forbids complaint and sorrow. If my life indeed has the destiny of an immortal, my future path will be guided by a master. Fortunate am I that Heaven grants a remnant life to endure this hunger, cold, and toil—what is there to grieve?"

Thus Yuchan laboured without complaint, undaunted by cold or heat, searching everywhere for the Way and the mysterious. Fortunate were his innate wisdom and broad experience, able to discern truth from falsehood, and not ensnared by sects of men or heresies. All those monks and Daoists he saw sought only fame and gain, none touching the life’s essence. For over twenty years he never met a true master.

At forty-two years old, in the third year of the Chunxi reign of Emperor Xiaozong, he travelled to the eastern shore of Yong, where he met Chen Niwan Zhenren, who took pity on him. Knowing his Daoist faculty, he brought him home to Luofu and taught him the secret of the returning elixir. After a year, Niwan saw him grow lax and ordered him down the mountain, saying: "You may toil again outside with bitter resolve for some years; I shall await your return here." Yuchan, helpless, wept and took leave to descend.

First, at Limu Mountain, he met a divine person who bestowed upon him the Supreme Clarity manual and the Thunder Secret of the Cavern. He wandered Wudang Mountain, where the Left Supervisor of the North Pole Exorcism Courtyard—none other than Lu Su of the Three Kingdoms—taught him the arts of talismanic practice and charity to benefit others. He travelled in Western Shu to Qingcheng, visited the Golden Hall, and met an old Daoist who gave him the Scripture for Delivering Others. When he reached Baling, the people were stricken with plague; he used talismanic water to aid the sick, expelling demons and curing all without fail; using the scripture to redeem ghosts, all were raised and ascended. From then forth he called upon thunder and rain, capturing demon spirits, working everywhere to accumulate merit. After seven years he returned to Luofu to report.

Niwan was pleased, saying: "To learn the Way requires such diligent toil; then truly one is a vessel of the Way." He then imparted the Way of the Taiyi Knife and Jade Tablet, saying to Yuchan: "I now wish to regulate the spirit to emerge from the fetus, and must rely on a companion’s merit. You shall remain here guarding the Dharma for several years; what say you?" Yuchan humbly replied: "Master applies effort, disciple ought to guard the Dharma. This is a matter incumbent upon me; I am willing to serve and attend the gracious master." Thus Niwan, assured of Yuchan’s sincerity, began his work, regulating the spirit to emerge from the fetus; three years of nursing, then another six of great stability, spirit and transformation beyond measure, hidden and manifest, unfathomable.

Bai Yuchan served his master in the mountain for nine years; one morning before the master he bowed thrice and asked, "May this disciple attain immortality in this life?" Chen Niwan replied: "Every person may become immortal, all may attain the Way; how much more so you?" Yuchan earnestly requested the Way: "I do not shrink from the dignity of the task, yet venture to ask the question of presumption—may I have but one word of illumination to aid my cultivation?" Niwan, moved by his sincerity, explained in detail the sequence and timing of the fire phases, the subtle meaning of the golden elixir, and the work of spirit emerging from the fetus; pointing step by step, he said: "Since you have received the profound secret, you must begin your practice without delay. Time passes swiftly, in a moment it is uncertain, so be careful in cultivation; this is Heaven’s secret mystery, not to be lightly transmitted to unworthy persons. In former days Zhang Zu Ziyang Zhenren passed his teaching to base men thrice and was thrice punished by Heaven. Be cautious! My inner elixir is complete; you may now follow me northward for a while." Yuchan thanked him and prepared to journey alone from that day. The master and disciple parted from the multitude descending the mountain; the disciples escorted him on his way. The matter is not further related.

Now Niwan Zhenren reached the Xiang River and said to Yuchan: "As I travel northward, I shall be delayed; I fear this may hinder your cultivation. Better that you attend to your affairs. You have no protector here, so you may use wealth as support. Go and buy some mercury, the more the better." Yuchan asked: "Master, what use is mercury?" Niwan said: "Go buy it, you will see its use." So Yuchan obeyed and bought two pounds of mercury, giving it to the master. Niwan rejoiced: "These two pounds of mercury will suffice to supply several years." He put the mercury in his mouth, and after a moment spat it out, transformed into gold. Seeing this, Yuchan was amazed and exclaimed: "My master has such divine power! I have heard in the Scripture of the Elixir: after the Way is attained, the body transforms to pure Yang, able to enter water without drowning, fire without burning, and metal and stone without impediment; walking with sun and moon without shadow. Never before heard mercury transformed by mouth into gold. This Way is indeed wondrous." Niwan said: "This great elixir Way, when gathered, forms shape; when scattered, has no substance. It can cause dry bones to stand erect, rotten wood to spring forth in an instant. This mercury turned to gold is no wonder."

Yuchan asked: "This golden transformation, will it change back?" Niwan said: "Immortals, using the golden elixir, may cause it not to change for five hundred years. If it is mere illusionary transformation, it may last but a year or two; few last three or five years without change. Now I give you this gold to take with you as your foundation for the Way, so you may begin your practice." Yuchan said: "Now I hear your words; this gold changes back to mercury after five hundred years—does it not harm people? I dare not use it." Niwan said: "Now hearing you consider what happens after five hundred years, I see your heart for the Way; you will surely attain the fruit of celestial immortality. But even if this gold changes after five hundred years, it will not harm. Those who store gold are officials and wealthy households; these two pounds divided into eight pieces, not necessarily all kept by one family. What harm is there? You may hide yourself in the busy city and diligently toil. I shall cross the river to travel north. When you have fulfilled your merit and accomplishment, we shall meet again." Yuchan bowed with tears and sent him off.

At the bank of the Xiang River, he saw Niwan Zhenren place his bamboo hat upon the water, stepping on it and crossing the river. On the Xiang River shore all eyes witnessed this; everyone said he was truly a living immortal, and all were astonished and bowed.

Yuchan saw his master cast his hat across the river, knowing his Way was complete; he then diligently cultivated in a temple in the bustling town of Xiangxiang. After three years he attained the union of lead and mercury; cultivating two more years, the great elixir was about to be completed. One day he was enticed by external conditions and, lacking careful intent, suddenly the mercury escaped and the lead flew; all previous effort was lost. He lamented that his foundation was shallow and wept bitterly. Those around advised him to cease striving; thus he journeyed eastward, using talismanic water to aid the sick and suffering, accumulating merit and virtue.

He visited Tiantai, where he met Patriarch Zhang Ziyang Zhenren, who gave him the four-hundred-character golden elixir scripture, instructing him to guard carefully and beware of demonic invasion. Yuchan bade farewell to the patriarch, went to Mount Wuyi, built a hut and cultivated the elixir to completion. At this time he was sixty-four years old. Through conditions and the protection of Dharma, he once more employed great stability and concentration, sitting in forgetfulness for nine years, transforming the fetus and spirit, thus attaining subtlety of form and spirit, blending with the Dao and realizing perfect truth. Thereafter he descended the mountain, performing merit and virtue, awaiting the imperial summons to ascend. He styled himself Yunwaizi, skilled in cursive calligraphy and painting. He thus praised himself:

For a thousand ages, unkempt and barefoot,  
A lifetime of breath sustains me on rosy clouds.  
Laughing, I point below Mount Wuyi,  
Deep in white clouds lies my home.

From then he roamed freely everywhere, helping people and benefiting things. He also styled himself Ziqing. Later he composed a collection of writings entitled "Collection of Enlightenment on the Way," which was disseminated in the world. He journeyed throughout the land, practising merit and methods, painting plum and bamboo for pleasure. He received many seekers, drinking and chanting without weariness, guiding countless living beings. Barefoot and dishevelled, graceful and at ease—this is not further related.

As for Master Changchun, he bade farewell to his disciples at Longmen Cave, crossed the snowy Congling mountains, passed the flowing sands river westward, and travelled among various states to convert living beings. He arrived at the land of Tianzhu, also called Zhujian, now known as India. The king there saw that Master Qiu often had clouds and mist coiling above his head like a precious canopy, and called him the Precious Canopy Buddha, and also the Living Buddha of the East; to this day every household in the West offers him worship. This is not further related.

Master Qiu journeyed among the lands of Yuezhi and Huihui, guiding the lost and converting all, wandering everywhere. Returning to the snow mountains, he stayed at Lingjiu Temple, where he met an old monk whose Dharma name was Baiyun, holding a copy of the Investiture of the Gods. They read together. Master Qiu took the volume and perused it carefully; though the text was subtle and fine, the fiery nature had not been extinguished, and it was insufficient for the Way. Master Qiu lingered in that temple for over a year, composing a volume entitled Journey to the West. It contained one hundred chapters, with ninety-nine magical tribulations, with wondrous transformations without end; it was the secret of cultivation, demon subjugation, and dispelling calamities. When the book was completed he entrusted it to Monk Baiyun, who quietly studied it for a month.

One day he invited Master Qiu to the abbot’s quarters, setting a grand feast, seating the Master at the principal seat, performing the disciple’s rites, bowing low and saying: "Your servant is ignorant and shallow, with little virtue and deep sin, and has not succeeded in the Way. Meeting the Master here in this humble temple is the fortune of three lives. I humbly beseech the Master to point out one thread of the Way, so this humble student may have a path to advance cultivation. If in the future I attain the Way, I shall not forget the Master’s kindness in guiding me."

Changchun hastened to return the bow, saying: "The Zen Master’s virtue is like a hill, his nature like the autumn moon; why should he fear not attaining Buddhahood? Why be so modest?" They joined hands and sat down. The Zen Master said: "Were it not for the Master’s arrival here, I would be like the River God, surrounded by water. Now seeing the Master’s Way, I know my own ugliness, like ascending a hill and beholding a Han dynasty stele— the higher you look, the taller; the deeper you probe, the firmer; like a small stone or twig in a great mountain, like a speck on a horse’s body." Changchun asked: "Why are you so humble?" The monk answered: "Not from humility. Observing the Master’s Journey to the West, every word is a mystery, every sound a wondrous truth, containing secret profundities, infinitely subtle and mysterious, truly possessing the power to direct Heaven and Earth, to ride the light and govern the wind. If the Master would deign to liberate fools and the lost, I would gladly become a disciple. What say you, Master?" Changchun said: "You are a disciple of the Buddha’s school. In the future you will be a patriarch of the Western Chan, not a vessel of my Mysterious Sect. I have seen in your Investiture of the Gods some wondrous methods, yet the fiery nature is not extinguished. This must be utterly consumed before Bodhi can be realized, then and only then may the Way be discussed. Desire must be fully removed to leave the realm of desire; worldly passions must be ended to depart the realm of form. The mind not clinging to emptiness transcends even the formless. You may carefully ponder my Journey to the West, and eighty kinds of magical hindrances will be destroyed; then naturally you will obtain the true scripture and return home. Scripture means gold; the golden elixir is in the belly of man, and the great Way will naturally be attained." The Zen Master Baiyun bowed and said: "Greatly favored by your words of enlightenment, when shall I repay the teacher’s grace?"

After the meal, Changchun took leave, saying: "I set out tomorrow to return to my homeland, now I take my leave. So long as you diligently cultivate the great Way, when your merit and accomplishment are complete, we shall meet again at the Supreme Festival of the Dragon Flower." The Zen Master Baiyun earnestly entreated him to stay: "I beg the Master’s pardon for my blindness and folly. I have been in the temple for more than a year, only arriving this morning, and now know the Master’s Dao and virtue. Forgive your disciple’s ignorance. Pray stay a few days more and point out one or two of the hidden words and secret phrases within the Journey to the West; I would be deeply grateful." Changchun, seeing his sincerity, stayed for half a month and imparted something, then took leave, saying: "I should have long dwelt here, but many great matters in China remain unfinished; I must not tarry."

The Zen Master Baiyun could not detain him, helpless; he said to Master Qiu: "Since the Master has great matters unfinished in China, I dare not detain you." He then took out a hundred taels of gold and fifty of silver, presenting them before the Master, bowing and saying: "This is a small and humble gift; pray accept it for your journey, as travel expense." Changchun said: "I have dwelt in the permanent abode for over a year, greatly favored. Your generous gift I dare not accept." The monk said: "Now that I have been rescued by the Master, the distinction of master and disciple need not be overly modest. Besides, your Journey to the West says: ‘To seek treasures of Heaven, one must use the wealth of the world.’ Tang Sanzang did not part with his golden bowl, yet the true scripture was not obtained. Though these are hidden words of the Way, worldly etiquette is also appropriate." Changchun said: "To covet wealth is not the way of those who leave the world; to leave the world yet covet wealth is not the Way. Those who love treasure and greed are not cultivators of character and the Way. But as I depart, I desire to build temples and forests; without wealth this cannot be." It is thus said:

The benevolent give wealth and gain blessing;  
The unbenevolent amass goods and perish.  
If one loves treasure and greedily hoards,  
How can one cultivate self and learn the Way?
