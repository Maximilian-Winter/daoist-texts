# Chapter Twenty-One: Zhang Daoqing of Jiugong Mountain Sits in Transcendence — Changchunzi of Baiyun Temple

The Poem says:

To sit in transformation and wander as an immortal each has his cause;  
Let none be blind so as to lose the Original Truth.  
By voidness and non-being comprehend the profound principle of the Origin;  
In emptiness and stillness fully illumine the free and natural body.  
Myriads of heavenly spirits ever attend and uphold;  
In the vast world one roams at will and surveys all.  
The dusty world is drawn to many a scholar;  
They may be said to transcend the mundane and enter the holy.

Turning to Bai Ziqing, who departed from Luofu, inviting one to roam to Lin’an. The Song Emperor hearing thereof summoned him, ordering him to lodge at the Taiyi Palace. Before half a year was spent, drunk, he fell into the waters of West Lake and departed. Later he appeared again at Haifeng County. Afterwards, at Gusu Terrace, while chanting of the plum blossom unfinished, he met with Niwan and was invited again to Wuyi Mountain, in accordance with the five-year promise made to the hermit Zhi’an Zhan Yan.

At that time the Daoist of the Wan-nian Palace, Shi Zongshi, true in sincerity and diligent in cultivation, took refuge under the White Perfected One as disciple. The Perfected One instructed him in the Nine-Spirit Flying-Step Chapter of Summons, and the Supreme Purple Pivot Jade Morning Cave-Yang Flying Talisman, as well as the Sanskrit incantations of refinement, and the Secret Methods of the Five Thunders. He personally performed confession of faults and offered memorials to the Celestial Court.  
==The Perfected One decreed to the disciples: “From sixteen years I abandoned home to seek the Way, diligently entering its mystery; I endured a thousand hardships. I died three times and revived. One purpose unmoved, enduring all pain. At forty-two I met my true teacher, then reached the secret of self-cultivation. After bitter toil till sixty-four, the elixir was attained. Now at ninety-six, I have completed the Way. Henceforth we part. You who have aspiration, imitate my will; why fear virtue not established, or the Way not accomplished?”==  
Thus he spoke, and sat down to shed his mortal form. The disciples saw the Perfected One mount a crane in the air and ascend; they bowed and bade him farewell, unable to record more.

The Song Emperor Ningzong hearing this, issued an edict bestowing the title Haizhou Purple Clear Bright Daoist Perfected One, and commanded the building of Wuyi Palace to manifest his virtue and Dao. The Perfected One’s disciple Peng Helin compiled his books in forty scrolls and wrote his deeds, truly to reveal the essentials of the Daoist arts.

Now Zhang Daoqing the Perfected One, having answered the summons, returned to Jiugong Mountain, using talismans and water to aid men’s illnesses, his marvels beyond measure. Clouds of Daoists gathered, grandly practicing the profound teachings. One day, he mounted the hall and showed the assembly: “Once my master Tan Changzhen Perfected One in Shu taught me thus: ‘All men revolve in the wheel of birth and death, unceasingly, because of the mind’s attachment. When the mind arises, various demons arise; when the mind ceases, all demons cease. If one can let not a single thought arise, one is freed from birth and death. What is meant by having mind? It is because all beings have the three poisons of greed, anger, and ignorance. Those who seek the Way must purify these three poisons, and leap beyond the Three Mountains. What are the Three Mountains? They are the Mountains of Ignorance, of Flames, and of the Abyss. One must sever attachments and abandon love, crush strength and blunt sharpness, and remove all unwholesome thoughts. When the mind of private desire is entirely purified, one sees the true nature before parents’ birth, the Original True Face. What are unwholesome thoughts? They are the hearts of nameless envy, greed, jealousy, desire for wealth and beauty, the various scheming thoughts arising and ceasing without rest, bound by the old obstructions of karmic hindrances, the obscure true origin, from which there is no liberation. One must utterly extinguish the various thoughts and then behold one’s own nature. What is one’s own nature? It is the Heaven-bestowed original nature, not the nature of temperament. Throughout the twelve hours, each thought must be pure and still, not disturbed by any old defiled realm or obscure true source; the heart abiding in emptiness, roaming free and at ease. Naturally spirit and energy intermix, the one mind harmonizes; thus one is as is, freely at ease, the one nature perfectly bright. Like the bright moon in the sky, illuminating the great earth, lighting everywhere. Let not one thought waver, lest clouds and mist veil its nature’s light. Then there is no fear of birth and death; how can there be karmic hindrances to bind? If a single thought arises, the heart is not pure and still; there is attachment and hindrance, and one cannot enter the Way, how then see the Original?’  
‘So long as you all have a will as firm as a mountain, unmoved and unshaken, meeting demons with no fear, your will not turning back, the demons will vanish of themselves. But if you see demons retreat and fear, you will enter the dusty net; how can you leap out of the sea of suffering? The heart pure and intent, there is a path to Heaven; the will confused and nature disturbed, you enter the gates of hell. Consider this well. Therefore those who communicate with spirits are divine; those who live long are of energy. I myself received the master’s transmission, abiding always in the Way, never forgetting, preserving the one spirit, nourishing the one energy, thus able to communicate with spirits. By talisman-water I aid men; none fail to respond. What difference am I? Only preserving spirit and energy, guarding the upright heart. Now I have long wearied of the dusty world, and wish to go to Zhongnan to meet masters and friends, responding to the heavenly edict.’  
He retired to his elixir chamber. After three days, he called the disciples and composed a verse, passing away peacefully. The verse says:

For many years I have roamed the great earth,  
Letting go at the cliff, my nature and heaven.  
Laughing, I point to the three islands of Peng and Ying,  
Turning back, they are but before me.

At his burial, his corpse was like a cicada’s cast skin. The disciples knew their master had shed the mortal body and departed, and so buried him.

Now the Mongol ruler, after returning from the Western Regions, the provincial governor of Yanjing, Shi Mo Gong, and envoy Liu Zhonglu with various officials, each carried memorials sincerely petitioning the imperial decree. They summoned Qiu Chuji at Shandong and appointed him Grand Envoy Pucha, put in charge of the Taiji Palace temple at Yanjing, supervising the affairs of the Daoists. Master Qiu consented, responded to the summons, and dwelt at Taiji Palace. He petitioned to rename Taiji Palace as Baiyun Temple. Daoist companions gathered, teaching flourished day by day. Master Qiu then established the Eight Assemblies: called Equality, Changchun (Long Spring), Lingbao (Numinous Treasure), Longevity, Enlightened Truth, Peace, Disaster Dispelling, and Golden Lotus. Those seeking Dharma names increased daily; far and near they gathered, hearing the wind and spreading the Dao transformation. At this time the great Daoist sect flourished; dukes, marquises, earls, and sons came to take refuge; disciples were beyond counting.

Nearby these worldly monks, seeing the grand Daoist spirit flourishing and their hearts unyielding, built a Western Wind Temple more than two li west of Baiyun Temple, to remember the phrase ‘When the west wind rises, white clouds scatter.’ Master Qiu subdued it with a great bell, so that the west wind could not stir; wind belongs to Wood, subdued by Metal. Thus the temples’ bells and drums of the realm are all east Metal west Wood, reversing the Five Elements, but only the bells and drums of Baiyun Temple are east Wood west Metal, thus still and not striking.

In the ninth month, the pacification commissioner Wang Ji said: ‘Mars invades the Tail Constellation, portending disaster for Yanjing. It is fitting to perform the Qingzhan ritual for propitiation.’ He asked Master Qiu the cost. Master Qiu said: ‘The loss of one thing is still to be borne with compassion, much more so when the whole realm is involved. These past years, the people suffer; public and private coffers are empty; I will supply from the common dwelling’s stores.’ So he arranged a great offering ritual lasting seven days. When the southern rites were completed, the pacification commissioner advanced with reverence and congratulated: ‘Master’s Daoist heart moves the heart of Heaven; Mars has withdrawn several divisions; now there is no fear.’ Master Qiu said: ‘Heaven’s response is like sound echoing in the valley, swift as this; how can men of the world oppose it? Good and evil are manifest; reward and retribution are clear; how can it be vain? Yet alas, men do not believe; how can one not grieve and revere!’  

At that time, Master Qiu at Baiyun Temple set up the altar to transmit precepts, using the Vinaya to guide men. Initially, the True Faith Precepts were preached, to be observed for one year, fulfilling the Ten Precepts. Wearing the True Faith robe, he expounded the “Record of Merits and Demerits” and the “Treatise on Response and Retribution” to explain the causes and effects of sin and blessing, practicing rules and etiquette. The following year, only then could one receive the Middle Purity Precepts, three hundred rules to be observed for a year. He expounded the “Four Grades Sutra,” “Illumination Heart Sutra,” “Daily Use” and other scriptures, teaching the principles of self-cultivation, fulfilling precepts and conduct. The next year, only then could one receive the Great Celestial Immortal Precepts, expounding “Awakening to Truth,” “Harmony of the Three,” “Nanhua,” “Dao De” and various elixir scriptures, receiving and upholding the Great Celestial Immortal Precepts. Afterwards, there was no precept not observed; without precept one disciplined oneself, thus it was the True Precept. At this stage, in motion or stillness, one accords with the Way; in walking, standing, sitting, lying, speech, and action, all is perfectly harmonious; all matters are in accord with the Way; how can there be anything not accordant?

==One day Master Qiu ascended Baoguang Hall to preach, universally revealing: ‘Since you all have left the world to seek the Way, seeing through the causes and conditions, you have come to take refuge in the Three Treasures. Entering this Daoist gate, yet you are unwilling to practice the Way earnestly, unwilling to labour the body and accumulate merit, your hearts and bodies lack pure stillness, so cannot cultivate the fruit of the Way; outwardly unwilling to endure hardship for others, to cultivate the root foundation. You only seek ease and enjoyment, sitting idle consuming faith and charity, committing sins and crimes, adding faults and errors. When blessings are exhausted and sins full, you die and fall to hell, suffering fully, or are reborn as beasts of burden to repay your debts by labour; or repay with flesh, feeding your mouth and belly. At such time, what use is repentance? Seeing this, why not hasten to set firm foot, hold fast your purpose, resolve your will, cultivate the body and practice the Way? Reflect on the world’s affairs; all matters are not true; the nature of emptiness, in all things is the Way. As for me, when I was sixteen I abandoned home to seek the Way, at nineteen I met my true master, followed him for over twenty years. I never heard half a word of the Way without also undergoing many trials of demons. My heart bore no regret or complaint; only when my master completed the Way did he entrust me with the elixir yang, and then gave me the Way’s command. If I had harboured anger, resentment, or laziness, I would have long ago entered the ghost realm and transformed into a strange being; how could I have attained the Way today?’==

At Qingfeng he respectfully inquired: ‘If a man has no mind and no attachment, focusing single-mindedly on the heart, guarding it until death but never accomplishing, and never meets a master’s enlightenment, why?’ The master said: ‘No mind and no attachment fall into illusion and emptiness. Single-minded fixation on the heart is clinging. Unless one reaches the true emptiness and reality, how can one move the true sage? Therefore one dies old without accomplishment. True emptiness is hard to speak of. When you remove a single portion of thought and desire, there is some merit; removing ten parts, ten merits; removing nine thousand nine hundred ninety-nine parts, leaving only one unrid part, is not called true emptiness. One must remove all; then the true immortal will come to audit your heart; naturally a true master will come to rescue you. How can one be without affairs in the dusty world? If there are some small matters, these are outside the Way and must be dealt with. But when matters pass, do not seek them; when they come, do not avoid them. Thus Master Lü said: the true constant must respond to things, and in responding must not be bewildered. When things come, respond; when things go, stop. Practicing thus, daily responding to myriad things without disturbing the heart; at leisure, calmly settled; what attachment can there be?’  

The disciple asked: ‘For one who cultivates the Way, is it better to be in stillness or in bustle?’ The master said: ‘If the beginner has unsettled mind and unextinguished desires, better avoid still places, and gradually discard passion and sever desire. If one has true resolve, the dusty heart is pure; bustle is better. As for me, once at Panxi, six years of bitter resolve equalled the effort of six lifetimes of others.’

Asked further: ‘If a disciple is single-minded toward the Way, yet the body is still subject to flaws, how treat them?’ The master said: ‘Your hearts are not truly still and pure, thus there are flaws. When you reach the source of mind, clear and still, the original spirit settled, spirit and energy mingled, the six thieves cannot invade, essence refined into energy, spirit and energy interwoven, forged into the supreme treasure, the essence route naturally sealed forever; how can flaw remain?’

==Asked: ‘I have heard those who cultivate the body rely entirely on will and vow. What are will and vow?’ The master said: ‘Will is holding the mind refining the self, a thought unmoved, removing passion and extinguishing desire, not raising greed or anger. Not disturbed by wealth, honour, or glory, nor moved by hardship or calamity, not attached to a speck of dust, not raising a single thought—this is true will. Vow is the arising of heart to benefit others and things, all acts of merit and virtue, saving men and aiding the world—these are vows.’==

Someone asked: ‘How to regulate breath?’ The master said: ‘Tortoise breath, soft and continuous, is the living work of the Daoist, but one must not cling to it. The Chan school does not speak of breath regulation or self-refinement, only of the four words “pure, still, and extinct,” which are but twofold dung. Thus it is said: The coloured body’s origin is limited; passion and desire are boundless. Ignorance is like bees greedily seeking honey; madness like butterflies loving flowers.

‘Generally the Way of self-cultivation has many gates; without meeting a clear master’s guidance, it is difficult to penetrate. Worldly arts include: focusing spirit and imagining, shaking sinews and swinging marrow, breathing in and out, swallowing mist and ingesting energy; or using divination lines to add and subtract; or using furnace fire to burn grass and refine mercury; or obtaining side techniques to cheat fools; or employing battle arts to exhaust essence and ruin virtue; or false words and teachings to deceive the common folk, slandering the true doctrine. Such persons, born as sinners within the teaching, die and fall to hell or beasts; too many to enumerate. The scripture says: “Long life requires carefulness in the bedchamber; why then die to make the spirits weep?” Most men indulge their passions and desires; though the body lives, the spirit is long lost. The Dao is to cultivate the formless form, to be as if no one is, to have the form containing the formless, preserving the one point of void and spirit, the bright true nature. Thus the vastness of the six directions, the brightness of the three lights, are also the forms of Heaven and Earth. Therefore I nurture the unmanifest; form surely always remains; containing the no-mind, the nature is bright and unclouded. Thus refined into immortals, spirit united with void, body abiding in the Dao, form and spirit both wondrous, united with the Way’s truth. Therefore my body can ascend to Jade Capital, can roam and invite to the Golden Tower, can have and not have, neither end nor perish. Therefore no descent or banishment, nor fear of calamities. If one regards only seeing nature as wonderful, not knowing refining form is essential, then dying as a clear spirit, how can one ascend to voidness? How can one compare with high immortals and supreme sages? If the body is not destroyed but spirit departs, then the body remains in the world, flesh not destroyed; if the nature is not destroyed, even hungry ghosts and beasts have this nature, only differing in spirit and brightness. The mind can create form, the mind can preserve form. The law includes love for the world; moving through countless kalpas, the mind is the cause. If the mind’s root is damaged, in an instant one goes to the dark path. When form perishes but mind remains, one is saintly; when form remains but mind changes, one is beastly. Now of the people of the world wishing for longevity, they do not seek in their own original life, but beg from immortals, Buddhas, and spirits—foolish indeed! Abandoning the root to seek the branch, what profit is there? Our sect does not speak of longevity, not because it does not exist, but because it transcends longevity. This is the supreme great Dao, not petty arts of prolonging life. Cultivators must comprehend literature and reason, only then can they penetrate mysteries, understand subtleties, to begin work. Slight misunderstanding, a hair’s breadth astray, misses by a thousand li. Thus it is said: ‘A hair’s difference and the elixir is incomplete.’ Nowadays men want to cultivate the body, readily seeking masters and the Way, and in a year or two expect to become immortal or Buddha; if three to five years see no success, they lose resolve. The ways of men are not yet clear; how can they understand the Way? If one can understand one principle, one can shed one shell; if all principles are understood, shedding myriad shells, the heart is unobstructed, the great Way is clear. If one matter or principle is not understood, obstruction arises, and the shell cannot be shed. Are there not sages in Confucius’s school who do not understand principles? Among the Taishang sect none fail to reach the true Way. If you wish to understand the Way, you must first understand human affairs and worldly conditions, find their one source; then all things are known, all matters understood. When human reason is clear, the Way is not far. One root may scatter into myriad differences; myriad differences may also return to one root.’

A disciple asked: ‘The Northern Sect’s Daoist methods, to our master are widely practiced. Can the master perform divine transformations?’ Master Qiu said: ‘The great Way is very ordinary, not seeking strange wonders. If only the heart be true, what is there not to accomplish? I suffered bitterly, enduring many trials from demons for decades, my resolve unmoved, moment by moment not slack, guarding the one heart only. Since I left the mountain, emperors and ministers have respected me; the emperor decreed me Grand Patriarch, yet my heart never moved. Yellow boys, white li, beggars, the lowly, I never slight them. All are equal; none high or low. The Western Regions call me the Living Buddha of Zhendan; since the full perfection of Quanzhen, none have equalled me; what could I have achieved? Only a bubble floating on the sea of nature. In the palace there was a demon; all hundred methods failed; Zhang the Celestial Master gave up. The emperor summoned me; I was in the mountain, in stillness, with a slight motion of one thought, the demon left by itself. I use no talismans or charts or generals; the evil flees from fear of righteousness. Why? Because evil cannot overcome right. This is the principle I preserve; Heaven and men naturally respond.’  
Truly:

The one nature round and bright is the root sect;  
In the mind’s orifice nurture the hidden dragon.  
Refining the yang essence, the golden light shines through;  
What need is there for favour, honour, or sealed edicts?
