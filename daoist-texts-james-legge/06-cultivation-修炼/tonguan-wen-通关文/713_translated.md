# The Pass of Affection and Love

The *Wuzhen* says: Though a man’s life may last a hundred years, premature death and poverty or prosperity are beyond foreknowledge. Only yesternight one was still riding on the street; this morning already slumbering in the coffin as a lifeless corpse. Wife and wealth abandoned are not truly yours; sins and misdeeds shall proceed and it is hard to deceive oneself. The great medicine seeks not to meet or avoid; to meet it without refining is folly and ignorance. Again it says: To follow the Way one must be fierce and vehement, the heart without affection, as hard as iron. Though one has men and women, wives and concubines, what difference is there with others? All this teaches men to view worldly affairs of affection and love with indifference, and to hasten to cultivate their nature and life. Life in the world is such that all things are but falsehood; only nature and life are true. The whole world’s people take the false for the true, and place the two words nature and life aside; affection and love bind them, as clothing and food. A hundred cares vex the heart, myriad affairs weary the body. Day and night they rush and labour, devising a thousand schemes and a hundred plots, harming others to benefit themselves, insatiably greedy. They flee places of fire and water, sword and spear; they flee tiger and wolf, smoke and pestilence; heedless of life and death, careless of existence and ruin, they live a busy life without rest, making long-term plans for their children, until their spirit is exhausted, their vital energies decline, and great illnesses befall them, so that they lie bedridden. Though there be filial sons and virtuous grandsons, they cannot take the place of suffering; fair wives and beloved concubines cannot relieve the bitterness endured. The love and affection of a lifetime come to nought and afford no support. When the three inches of breath cease, the spirit returns no more. Who then is he and who am I? Reflecting thus, what real help is there in the love and affection of a lifetime? Since there is no real help, it is known that love and affection are the great sorrow of human life, and must be early and clearly seen through. To see through them, one must first secretly assay the advantages and harms of this love and affection. Assaying and assaying, one finds sweetness mingled with bitterness, love containing harm; it is true and plain that love and affection are false things, and that to understand them is to know that they are troublesome affairs. Thus one naturally does not set foot upon the quagmire, nor establish oneself in the fiery pit. There is a different thought within, and one is not entangled by love and affection. If one can truly assay the bitterness of love and affection, desiring to depart from the world, then there is great release and great liberation, so that one may cultivate nature and life without restraint or fetters. Even while dwelling in the world, one will be clear and bright; when things come, one responds without injury or harm. For to realize that love and affection are bitterness is to be able to treat them as a mere play in a theatre, free and masterful, unhurt by the harm of affection. Yet the father and son, brother and sister, husband and wife, having met in one theatre, the father must act the part of father, the son the part of son, the elder brother the part of elder brother, the younger brother the part of younger brother, the husband the part of husband, the wife the part of wife. One must know to fulfil each duty, and in one’s own place to be so, but only with the mind clear that this is but a play; all together join to perform this one play in order, and thus bring it to an end and settle matters between them. Acting thus, one neither injures the ties of kinship nor obscures one’s original nature; this is to be a layman who is as if a monk, to be in the dust yet free from dust, with how much convenience and joy! Formerly the layman Pang, the transmitter of the great Way, the immortal sage Ge, the true lord Xu, the heavenly master Zhang, the three Mao lords—all these were laymen who became great in the Way. This is how one who dwells at home ought to be. But for one who is a monk, except in matters of serving parents, preserving life, and sending off death, all other love and affection must be cut off as with a knife, the cords must be loosed, and no particle of attachment or care allowed to remain. If there be the slightest particle of attachment or care, the great matter is spoiled. Not only can the Way not be cultivated, but the Way cannot be understood. For the heart is disturbed by the words love and affection. When disturbed by love and affection, one cannot see through them. If one cannot see through them, one is blocked at the pass of affection and love; how can one rush forward in the path before him? I exhort those who sincerely seek the Way to swiftly open the pass of love and affection, to be without tether or entanglement, free and easy, and single-heartedly study the Way, and there will be progress. Otherwise, if love and affection cannot be relinquished, and still hang in the heart and breast, to imagine one can comprehend the Way is difficult indeed.
