# The Gate of Jealousy

The Book of Changes says: "The superior man uses friendship to discuss and learn." The Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra says: "Before one has attained liberation oneself, one liberates others." The Diamond Sūtra says: "If a good man or good woman receives and holds this sūtra, even to the extent of the four-line gāthā, and explains it to others, the merit thus obtained surpasses that other merit." Mencius said: "To do good with others, to set aside oneself and follow others, to delight in receiving from others in order to do good." All these speak of doing good with others; hence there must be no jealousy or private mind. 

For those who cultivate the true (Way), they cultivate their nature and life. The two words, nature and life, are possessed by all men; each one is complete and perfect; in the presence of the sage it is not increased, in the presence of the ordinary it is not diminished. Whether rich or poor, noble or base, wise or foolish, high or low, who is without his nature and life? Since all men have nature and life, it follows that the great Way is a public thing; all men may illuminate the great Way, all men may become immortals and Buddhas. This is to rely on the faithful mind and the aspiring scholar to cultivate and verify by themselves. 

Yet the method of cultivation and verification requires the seeking of an enlightened teacher to guide, and the borrowing of good friends to assist. The enlightened teacher is for the purpose of setting right the outline and leading; the good friend is to broaden and enrich knowledge and insight. The enlightened teacher must be sincerely sought; the good friend must also be reverenced. For the benefit of a good friend is half the功 of a teacher. Borrowing his knowledge to supply my ignorance; borrowing his ability to aid my inability. The benefit is great indeed; how can it be lightly neglected? Therefore the ancients taught men to seek teachers and find friends. 

For example, sharing the same teacher and studying the Way together, having one heart and one purpose, meeting day and night, one must mutually respect and love each other. Where there is good, encourage each other; where there is fault, mutually admonish. In adversity support each other; in sickness care for each other. Like partners seeking wealth, pulling and hauling the boat together. What one does not know, borrow my explanation; what I do not know, seek his enlightenment. They mutually assist, and their功 is doubled. Much more so when studying the Way in the same hall; these are friends of nature and life, comrades of the Way and righteousness, and it is right to be affectionate and harmonious. What one obtains, it is as if I have obtained; what one loses, it is as if I have lost. Such are those who study the Way together. 

The Book of Poetry says: "When a man has skill, it is as if I had it myself; when a man is wise and sagacious, my heart delights in it, as if it were my own speech." The confused scholars of the world, without ambition or spirit, when friends urge and encourage, they grow only more repellent. When they themselves have faults, and friends admonish and warn, then ignorance arises. Not only do they not listen, but they harbour hatred and resentment. They will not probe the Way for themselves, and long remain ignorant; when they see others diligent and earnest, able to understand and comprehend, the teacher and master rejoice and they secretly feel jealousy. Therefore they purposely foment strife, and ruin the good deeds of others. They do not repent of their own incapacity, but envy the ability of others. They never think of what it is to learn the Way. One who does not learn the Way loses the chance to reform and correct faults; by learning because of faults, one desires to change towards good; by learning because of errors, one desires to correct and be without errors. Now when one sees others good and does not know how to advance towards goodness oneself, starting with no fault and yet envying others, one thereby brings about one’s own fault. The crooked mind is a crutch; day by day one learns and declines, studying in the dark region where the dull and foolish are immovable. 

There is an even lower kind of villain who knows not high or low; when he hears men speak of the Way, he laughs to their face; when he sees men cultivate practice, he slanders them secretly. Not having understood the Way, why enter the gate of the Way? Even if he enter the gate of the Way, he does not rejoice in the Way. Wearing the crown of the ancients, putting on the garments of the ancients, yet contradicting the words of the ancients and turning his back on their conduct. Unaware of guilt and sin, heedless of cause and effect, what is he but a pretender to the Way? 

In times of old, Kṣitigarbha Bodhisattva wished that all men become Buddhas, and only afterwards would he himself become Buddha. Lüzu wished to save all men of the world before he ascended on high. The Seven Perfected Masters studied under the Heavenly Emperor of the Double Ninth; after the Emperor ascended to Truth, Qiu, Liu, Tan, Wang, Hao, and Sun, all six studied under Mazu, and all obtained Mazu’s guidance and completed great affairs. Generally, for the learner, one must first preserve great impartiality and selflessness, and have a benevolent heart to do good to others; to benefit others is to benefit oneself. Only then can there be progress. 

I exhort the sincere learner of the Way to speedily open the gate of jealousy; in the great unity where no self exists, only diligently attack and temper oneself; respect the strengths of others, reveal one’s own shortcomings; lower the head in doing things; advance with sincerity. To walk one step is one step; every功 accomplished is功 accomplished. Preserve the heart of the sages, act the conduct of the sages, and finally complete the work of the sages. Otherwise, with jealousy filling the breast, the more one studies, the worse one becomes; not even a good man can be made, much less dare to hope for the sages, or falsely imagine the bright Way—it will be difficult indeed.
