# The Barrier of Delusive Thought

The Awakening to Truth says: Amidst the vague and indistinct, one seeks form; within the dim and obscure, one seeks the true essence. Being and non-being enter each other from this point; not yet having seen, how can one imagine it accomplished? It is further said: The Song of the Treatise on Accord teaches the utmost truth, but does not apply the fire and furnace to the text. To know the place where the secret words pass through, one must together with the spirit carefully discourse. The Perfect Man of the Great Void says: What others speak of is not the practice; only what I practice is not spoken of. These all affirm that the Way must be truly known and practiced; it is not to be gained by vain and empty delusive thought. For the Way is the most supreme and most precious, exceedingly high and great, most deep and most secret. One must employ careful effort in discrimination, proceeding from the shallow to the deep, from the near to the distant; profound cultivation comes of itself. How can it be made clear by vain thought, by fragments of words and phrases, by one or two steps and then at once completion? Only through the highest and greatest of enterprises, does one require the highest and greatest of men before it can be done.

The Way lies between Heaven and Earth; all men have a portion, but all men cannot attain it. That all men have a portion is because all men hold the qi of yin and yang and the five phases and so are born in the body. Within the body is the principle of yin and yang and the five phases, which is the head of all things; principle and qi both completeâ€”who has not his own Way? Who has not his own nature and destiny? Having this Way, having this nature and destiny, one may then understand this Way, perfect this nature and destiny, and become sage or worthy, become immortal or Buddha. Therefore it is said all men have a portion. But all men cannot attain it because men are deluded by worldly conditions, perplexed by fame and profit, bound by affection and love, recognizing the false and abandoning the true, unable to establish resolution, unable to rouse spirit, incapable of employing effort and power. They follow their desires and at will let their consciousness bring disaster. When they would advance, they retreat; when they desire to do good, they think to do evil. Therefore it is said all men cannot attain it.

If one is indeed a man of worth, one values nature and destiny, seriously discriminates matters, courageously presses forward, is constant from beginning to end, with firm resolution and mind, exhausts the principles, seeks teachers and visits friends, truly walks the path and practices it; every step taken is a step made, every matter done is a matter completed; day and night without slackening, at all times applying the mind, only fulfilling one's own affairs, not anticipating the affairs of others; accumulating merit and deeds, humbling oneself and esteeming others. As for illuminating the Way and accomplishing the Way, one listens to its natural course, follows its heavenly conditions, and absolutely does not indulge delusive thought. Even if in this life there be no merit of practice, no blessing or fate, and the great Way be hard to know, one does not blame Heaven nor censure men until death comes. Thus to preserve the heart and establish resolve, the ancestral masters have secretly made arrangements.

The ignorant scholars of the world, not having yet completed the affairs at their own side, muddle through the days, only seeking to eat well and wear fine clothes. By day they roam idly and at night sleep soundly and securely. They do not apply expedient means, do not accomplish merit and virtue, nor are they willing to discriminate principles, nor willing to seek clear teachers. They learn some empty words and phrases, tamper with skill, and put on airs from head to foot. They falsely pretend to cultivate, vainly imagine becoming immortals. Little do they know that the study of nature and destiny has the power to usurp creation, the method to overturn Heaven and Earth; it must have secret transmission of mind, not to be guessed by oneself, nor to be rashly practised. Those who attain the truth hold and cultivate it; they may be fellow-workers with Heaven, matched with Earth. Is this something lightly known or easily understood? From antiquity the true founding masters have endured untold hardships before meeting a true teacher; have undergone countless trials before hearing the Way; have passed through many dangers before accomplishing the Way. Is it by not doing real work, by empty and vain thought, that they can know and accomplish? Empty and vain thought, even this single thought, is the root of sin that cannot illuminate the Way. If the Way itself cannot be illuminated, how much less can one hope to accomplish it?

I exhort those who are true in heart and on the Way to quickly break through the barrier of delusive thought. Steady your footing, and whether studying the Way or practising the Way, exert strength at every step, apply effort at all times; naturally, bitterness will end and sweetness come. Those who have not yet heard the Way will then be able to hear it; those who have heard the Way will then be able to accomplish it. Otherwise, if real work is not done, words do not regard deeds, deeds do not regard words, delusive thought makes knowing the Way difficult.
