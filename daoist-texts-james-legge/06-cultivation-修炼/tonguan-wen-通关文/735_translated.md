# The Barrier of Fear for Difficulty

The Yi says: The superior man by conforming to virtue, accumulates the small so as to reach greatness. The Perfect Sage said: The superior man observes the Way and acts; if he should give up halfway, I cannot approve. Master Qiu said: In the world there is no difficulty, only to be feared are men of resolution. These all declare that in cultivating the Way it is necessary that one’s will and spirit be firm, and that one must not harbour a heart fearful of difficulty. 

Now the greatest difficulty under Heaven must be the greatest matter. The greatest matter must be accomplished by the greatest of efforts before it can be perfected. If it were of the easiest and simplest kind, all accomplished at once, then the matter must be small and not great. The study of nature and life is a great matter; its scope embraces all things, transcends men and Heaven, escapes the five elements, and goes beyond the three realms. Before Heaven and Earth it establishes its form; after Heaven and Earth it develops its function. To be a sage, to be an immortal, to be a Buddha—are not these great matters? The matter is great, and one desires to cultivate this great matter, to establish an everlasting and imperishable work—is it not difficult?

Yet, to know its difficulty and not to fear it, to regard life and death as one great matter, to set one’s will firm and unshaken, and to have one thought never to turn back until death—thus one may illuminate the Way and proceed in it, and the difficult will not be difficult. But if one knows its difficulty and fears it, does not regard nature and life as the great matter, begins with diligence and ends with slackness, has a wavering and divided mind, halts and does not advance—then not only is one unable to proceed in the Way, but also unable to illuminate the Way, and the difficult will remain difficult.

Formerly, Divine Light cut off his arm to seek the Way, and at once received the heart-transmission of Bodhidharma. Wang Zhong stood with snow three feet deep, and at last obtained instruction from Yi Chuan. Master Qiu purified his body and broke his ribs, and was moved to receive a divine message in return. Indeed, with a concentrated mind upon the study of the Way, sincerity one and not two, one can move Heaven and Earth and communicate with spirits and demons—how much more so with men?

In the world there are confused scholars who do not know that nature and life are the first great matter in man’s life. They hope to obtain some skill and at once desire to become immortals; they vainly imagine to learn some small vehicle, and at once desire not to die; they hear that the sacred Way is profound and abstruse, and must be deeply studied, and at once find it difficult; they hear that the road of cultivation is long, that one must forsake body and conceal life, and endure hunger and cold without avoidance, and at once retreat; they hear that the Way has a beginning and an end, that merit has degrees, that the fire has its season, and that the minutest matters are subtle, and at once lose heart. Thus in learning the Way, advancing and retreating are not decisive, the four elements are weak, the will and spirit are faint—how can they taste the flavour of the Way? Is it not a hindrance to the great matter?

I urge those sincerely learning the Way to speedily break through the barrier of fear for difficulty. To change to a heart of iron and stone. To avoid no hardship or peril, to advance with fierce strength, to forego sleep and forget food. Without regard to whether strength is gained or not, whether effect is seen or not, the longer the more effort, the farther the more diligence, with one mind advancing, at last there will be attainment, and what is difficult will not be difficult. Otherwise, fearing difficulty and not decisive, as if alive and as if dead, speaking with the mouth but not acting with the body, desiring to advance and yet retreating at once, vainly imagining to illuminate the Way—this is difficult indeed.
