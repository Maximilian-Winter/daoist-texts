# Gate of Lightness and Disdain

The Doctrine of the Mean says: Great indeed is the Way of the sages, broad and deep, by which all things are engendered and nurtured; it reaches the utmost height in Heaven, lofty and august indeed. There are three hundred rites and three thousand demeanours, which are reserved for the proper occasion and the proper person to act upon. The Old Ancestor said: Above Heaven and beneath Earth, only the Way is supreme. The chapter on Renewed Mandate says: There is a thing that existed before Heaven and Earth, nameless and originally silent and void. It is able to govern all phenomena, and does not follow the withering of the four seasons. All this speaks of the Way’s utmost greatness and supreme dignity, which none but men will not practice.

Now the Way as Way is vast and boundless, high and deep and unfathomable; it is the utmost void yet contains the utmost existence; it is the utmost emptiness yet contains the utmost reality; formless, yet able to give birth to forms; without image, yet able to produce myriad forms. It embraces Heaven and Earth, moves the sun and moon, revolves the four seasons, and nourishes all living things. There is nowhere it is not; there is nothing that does not exist within it.

In ancient times Confucius obtained it, and became the sage of the scholars; Śākyamuni obtained it, and became the ancestor of all Buddhas; the Old Lord obtained it, and became the patriarch of the myriad immortals; the Yellow Emperor obtained it, and mounted a dragon to ascend to Heaven; Nüwa obtained it, and refined stones to mend the Heaven; Jingyang obtained it, and uprooted his dwelling to fly and ascend; the Celestial Master obtained it, and distinguished men from ghosts; the Five Patriarchs obtained it, and attained the rank of celestial immortals; the Seven Perfected obtained it, and neither were born nor perished. From ancient to modern times those who have attained the Way, sages and worthies, are countless and cannot be reckoned by number.

So great and noble is the Way; how can it be lightly and contemptuously regarded? If one views it as a common and trivial matter, and treats it with lightness and disdain, then he is not material fit to carry the Way, but is one who turns his back upon it. How then can such a one discourse on the Way? To look lightly upon the Way is to suppose that the study of the Way is easy to understand, and so one cannot penetrate to its depths; to regard the Way with disdain is to think that to practise the Way is of no account, and so one cannot toil forward with effort. If one cannot enter in, and cannot advance, on what basis can he cultivate and accomplish this rare matter in the world?

Therefore, he who studies the Way must first know that the Way is a thing of utmost honour and supreme worth. It is not a thing that is easy to know, nor something casually acquired. Only thus can one rouse a resolute heart, employ bitter exertion, persevere without weariness, and surely attain the Way before resting.

The world’s confused learners do not know that it is secreted by Heaven and Earth, treasured by ghosts and spirits, and lightly disdain it with no sincere heart. Some rely on their petty cleverness, thinking that they can comprehend it by sudden insight; some remember a few phrases of wild fox Zen, imagining the Way to be therein; some catch at the wind and seize at shadows, fancying that they have real knowledge; some call a deer a horse, thinking that they have real vision; some meet enlightened men and shamelessly boast without any sincerity; some encounter fellow seekers and boldly maintain their own right without fear or reverence.

There are also a class of slanderous fiends, who upon hearing men speak of the Way immediately revile them; upon seeing men read the books, they immediately hate and scorn. They treat the sacred and wise classics and their commentaries as mere shell and outward form; they regard the diligent accumulation of merit by earnest men as lowly trivial matters. If they chance upon a great man, they will not bow their heads, but instead arrogate themselves to be superior to the great man. Even if they can bow their heads for a moment, they cannot endure the passage of months and years, nor bear the grinding of hardships.

They do not know that to learn the Way is to seek men, and that seeking men is to seek men to save this life of mine. To seek men to save life, one must be like a man who cherishes his life; only then can one clearly be moved and guided by a true master in the light, and in the dark be moved and upheld by ghosts and spirits. If one is not like a man who cherishes life, then he does not regard the Great Way as noble and worthy. If one does not hold the Great Way in honour, how can he hope to hear of the Great Way? Is this not the height of folly?

I exhort those who sincerely study the Way to swiftly open the gate of lightness and disdain. When the Way is open and firm, be earnest and solemn with your life. Serve your master with sincerity and reverence, be careful and cautious, diligent and earnest, with your feet planted on the ground, and dare not harbour a heart of lightness or disrespect. As when climbing a high mountain, every step is taken with effort; as when crossing a great river, every moment is guarded against danger—what fear is there that you cannot reach the shore of the Way?

Otherwise, not knowing the high or low, noble or base, treating them as though they were nothing, negligent in your efforts, shepherding sheep and gathering firewood in vain, foolishly imagining to illuminate the Way—how difficult it will be!
