# The Account of Encumbered Debts

The Most Holy One said: A scholar who sets his mind upon the Way, and is ashamed to wear mean clothes and eat coarse food, is not yet fit to be discoursed with. Qiu Zu said: Every grain of rice, every coin, is the blood and essence of the husbandmen; can it be taken without merit? These words teach that the learner must regard the Way as the chief concern, and cannot lightly seek after clothing and food. The cultivation of the Way is for the sake of nature and life. Though this body has not yet departed from the dusty world, and clothing and food cannot be dispensed with, yet one must not let them cause error in the great matters of nature and life. From ancient times the patriarchs have taught men to take a plain station and act accordingly: plain in high or low station; plain in wealth or in poverty; if in wealth, to act as if in wealth; if in poverty, to act as if in poverty. It is not necessary to beg for clothing and food from all quarters. Because the wise are few and the middling and inferior many, there is a division in practice between repose and effort, between difficulty and ease, teaching men to measure their strength and act accordingly. The highest wise are of great station and strength; they do not hinder themselves by dwelling in the market or court, or by abiding in places of wealth and honour, but can bring forth deeds that are unstained by wealth and honour. They do not need to borrow the strength of others, but directly ascend to the shore of the Way. But those of middling and lower grade, with low station and little strength, cannot comprehend the whole at once; if they dwell in wealth and honour, they are burdened by them and hindered in great matters. Hence the teaching is to abandon wealth and honour, to endure insult and beg for conversion, to follow the course of circumstances in daily life, to be troubled in heart and weighed in thought, to temper nature and breath, and to do their work on the solid ground, exerting effort in hardship. There are also those of great wisdom who do not love wealth and honour, who free themselves from affection and willingly endure poverty and plainness. With one robe and one gourd, they wander and find sustenance, secretly cultivating and refining themselves, so that men do not recognise them, and their labour is easy to perform. In all these cases there is no heed given to clothing and food, but only the borrowing of strength from all quarters, temporarily to nourish this skin and flesh. The ignorant scholars of the world do not know that the sweat and blood of all quarters cannot be lightly taken and received, that abandoning the great matters of nature and life, they make clothing and food their chief concern. They gather contributions from east and west, eat their fill and clothe themselves warmly, neglecting their true business, idly wandering in dissipation, never thinking what it is to leave the world. They are unable to repay the kindness of their parents who reared them, or the favour of the sovereign and the soil; they accumulate debts in all quarters - how shall they digest them? There are still others of the criminal sort, who with Daoist caps on their heads hide the hearts of thieves, seeking clothing and food by any means, devising ways to deceive. Some borrow and steal the property of men; some feign wisdom to receive support; some use the building of temples to make mischief; to-day they enter the homes of good men and convert money; to-morrow they seek out those who love learning and beg rice; east and west they trick and cheat, play at gambling for money, eat and drink, swallowing debts of all quarters - how shall they withstand them? Qiu Zu said, 'The two horns of flesh, sometimes there, sometimes not; one tail, a thousand fixed or ten thousand fixed' - such is the case. I exhort those who truly seek the Way with sincerity, quickly to clear the barrier of encumbered debts at the gate. Follow circumstances and guard the mouth; be indifferent and nourish the body. Every strand and thread, think how hard it was to come by; every draught and morsel, know the difficulty of accomplishment. Constantly exert yourself, adding effort at every step, hoping surely to reach the Way and complete virtue before ceasing. If indeed you come to the time of complete attainment of the Way and virtue, not only will you digest the debts of all quarters, but also the long-standing sins from the beginningless kalpas will all be cancelled at a stroke; then indeed you shall wear the garments of Heaven and eat the food of Heaven. How much more so the things of the dusty world! If otherwise, only knowing how to accumulate debts and not how to digest them; only knowing how to shift accounts and not how to repay them; having no merit and no practice, with sins heaped like mountains, and vainly imagining to know the Way - this is difficult indeed.
