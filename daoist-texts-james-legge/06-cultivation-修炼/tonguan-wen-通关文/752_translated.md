# The Pass of Retiring Aspirations

The Book of Changes says: 'A great fruit is not eaten; the gentleman obtains the carriage; the petty man strips the hut.' The ancient immortals say: 'At seventy or eighty years, if in one breath life yet remains, the elixir may still be returned.' The Perfected Man Sanfeng said: 'The plum is grafted upon the willow, the mulberry upon the pear; thus is the method of transmission to those who cultivate the true—since ancient times the divine immortals have practised the art of grafting. When men grow old, there is originally a medicine that cures.' All this speaks to the fact that the aged ought not to despair and retire their aspirations, nor abandon their course midway; they must in their old age love learning, the older the more diligent, and rest not until death. The Way of the Golden Elixir is to return to the root and restore life, to return old and become young, to repeatedly graft and restore life. To return old and become young is not to change shape or appearance, or to have the visage of a child; it is to return to the root and restore life, to return to the spirit complete, energy full, without loss or deficiency, the original countenance that was given at birth. The original countenance is not hard to return to; the special affliction is that men have no aspiration or constancy. Though old in years and weak in strength, the innate spiritual root has not altogether perished, but has been worn and injured by the acquired energy of later times. If one meet a wise master and sincerely seek the method of grafting and transmission, and apply effort in cultivation, increasing its yang energy and diminishing its yin energy, increasing and increasing, diminishing and diminishing, until there is no more to increase or diminish, that which was deficient becomes full, that which was absent returns, thus remaining as in former years, entire and complete as the original essence. This is returning to the root and restoring life; this is returning old and becoming young; this is the method of grafting life. When life is thus secured and established, my life is mine, not Heaven's. To again undertake the upward enterprise and reach the sacred domain, what illness can old age bring?
Formerly the Immortal Ge at sixty years heard the Way, and abode to prove himself a Sage and Minister of the Spirit Heaven. Lü Zu at fifty-four years heard the Way, and perfected himself as a Great Luo Heaven Immortal. Zi Qing at sixty-four years heard the Way, and perfected the indestructible true body. Sanfeng at more than seventy years heard the Way, and perfected himself as a Ten Extremes Great Luo Perfected Man. These illustrious ancestors all attained the Way in old age; what need is there to bind cultivation to youth or age? Therefore, he who has aspiration, though old, will attain the Way; he who has no aspiration, though young, will not attain the Way. How great indeed is the power of aspiration!
In this confused world, the scholars, when young, are not willing to humble themselves, and waste their years in idleness; when old, their hearts are cast down and their spirits exhausted, and they think to retire and follow other pursuits. Some may early meet a wise master and hear the fragrant wind, but themselves lacking the courage for arduous effort, their life is but faint and uncertain. Delaying until old age, they resign themselves to weakness and confusion and cease to advance. All these begin with diligence and end in slackness, thus deceiving their future; who then shall be to blame? Little do they know that one must first exhaust human effort and afterwards await the decree of Heaven. To step forward one pace lessens the steps remaining; to do one thing lessens the things remaining; fix the mind to persevere until death; even if one cannot at once ascend to the summit of a thousand peaks, to reach the half-mountain compared with those at the foot is as the difference between cloud and mud. If through old age one resign and let the four elements lie flat, unwilling to advance, thus framing one's own limit, it is said that the King of Hades need not call—the man sends himself to death.
I exhort those who sincerely study the Way to quickly break through the pass of retiring aspiration. It is necessary that in old age the will be strong, and the heart sincere in doing the work. Sometimes great matters may fail; the rooted cause is already planted; in future lives one will rise above others, and surely attain the Way. If there be great virtue and great power, fearing not life or death, one may in this world accomplish the matter. Otherwise, resigning to old age and unwilling to strive, retreating in aspiration, when the moment comes to turn back, one will be in confusion and without refuge; difficult indeed.
