# The Gate of Shame and Dishonour

The Tao Te Ching says: "The rivers and seas are able to be kings of a hundred valleys because they excel in lowering themselves." The Diamond Sutra says: "Patience in enduring insult is the perfection of wisdom." The great masters have transmitted this truth: "Having passed through five hundred kalpas, the length of time is beyond measure. By bearing insult with the power of the immortal’s endurance, one now attains the true and eternal." All these speak of those who cultivate the Way, esteeming above all their ability to bear shame and dishonour.

He who bears the Way has a heart like a mountain, and a capacity like the sea. The mountain, as a thing, receives clouds and dispels mists as they come and go; its forest covers and snow-lies change with the seasons; the wind blows, the heat burns, yet the mountain’s substance remains unmoved and unshaken, thus for myriads of ages. The disciple of the Way is resolute and steadfast in purpose; poverty does not disquiet him, calamity does not confound him; such is the constancy of his heart.

The sea, as a thing, receives the mingled sweet and bitter waters; the waters of nine rivers and eight streams flow into it and it receives them all; the soft-shelled turtles, the alligator turtles, the dragons and giant clams hide beneath its surface, and it receives them all; yet the sea’s true capacity is neither increased nor diminished, and it remains so for evermore. The disciple of the Way can endure insult and suffer disgrace; when confronted with adversity he contends not; when placed in lowly rank he feels no shame; such is the measure of his capacity.

It is only he who makes his life his nature, who is able to bear what others cannot bear, who can carry what others cannot carry. Therefore, Master Zhong wore a tattered hemp robe, and stood unashamed among those who wore fox and raccoon pelts. Yan Hui with a single bowl of food and a single gourd of drink, dwelling in a mean alley, men could not bear his distress, but Yan Hui changed not his joy. Zengzi wore a hemp robe without adornment, his complexion was swollen and eaten by sores; for three days he did not light a fire; for ten years he made no new garments; he set his cap straight but his tassel was broken; he grasped his collar and exposed his elbow; he thrust in his shoes but his heels were torn; he dragged his torn garment and sang the Shang ode, his voice ringing like metal and stone. Changchun received the blows of wicked men’s fists, and endured submissively without contention; Ziqing was subjected to rude abuse and curses, and took them with joy and without retort. These sages and worthies had great designs in their hearts, and all the disagreeable circumstances of the outer world, all the indignities that were heaped upon them, they did not count at all.

Among the foolish learners of this world, who let their passions loose and act according to their hearts, when they are poor and ignorant and see wealth and honour, they are ashamed and troubled; they do not restrain themselves; when confronted with insult they are quick to anger. They stumble and clash, and out of this spring ignorance; their words offend and they hasten to dispute. There are others yet more foolish who vainly imagine learning the Way, yet show no respect for it; some lean on their wealth in asking, some on their wisdom, some on their seniority, some on their achievements and merits, some on their connections; yet they refuse to approach with humility and sincerity. Some, in the sight of all men, inflate their importance and behave arrogantly, unable to bow their heads for fear of being laughed at. They do not know that the proud shall never be great, nor the self-respecting attain respect.

Such conduct, even if the patriarchs stood face to face, or immortals dwelt in the same chamber, would be of no avail. I urge those with true hearts who seek the Way to quickly open the gate of shame and dishonour. Put all worldly matters of false shame and false dishonour outside your reckoning, and take up another kind of shame and dishonour, true shame and true dishonour, which are those of not understanding the Way and not accomplishing the Way. Fix your purpose firmly, labour with all your might in advancing, and endless good fortune shall come to you. Otherwise, those who feel no shame to be ashamed, and take no dishonour to be dishonour, who are eager to be strong and to win the contest, who only desire that men submit to them while they will not submit to men, who know only how to be above others, and not how to be below others—such as these vainly desire to hear the Way; it is difficult indeed.
