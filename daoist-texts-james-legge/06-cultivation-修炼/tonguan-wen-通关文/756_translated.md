# The Gate of Cause and Effect

The Yi says: "In a family that accumulates goodness, there will surely be abundant blessings; in a family that accumulates evil, there will surely be lingering calamities." The Book says: "Do good, and a hundred auspicious things will descend; do evil, and a hundred calamities will descend." It also says: "Heaven’s punishments may be averted; but punishments of one’s own making cannot be escaped." The Can Tong says: "If the beginning is right, the end will be perfected; if the stem is upright, it can be sustained." The Master Zhengyang says: "If you sow hemp, you shall have hemp; if you sow millet, you shall have millet." All these words declare that where there is cause, there must be effect; in all matters, carefulness at the beginning will naturally secure completeness at the end.

Indeed, throughout Heaven and Earth, all things great and small have cause and effect. Good has its cause and effect; evil has its cause and effect. He who does good has the cause of good; the reward of good is the effect. He who does evil has the cause of evil; the reward of evil is the effect. The retribution of good and evil follows as shadow follows form, not a hair’s breadth failing. Therefore the noble man is cautious in what he does not see, and fearful of what he does not hear. In every thought he returns to goodness, so that not one evil thought arises in his heart. He does not set foot where there is no propriety, nor walk in what is unrighteous; every act is good, and he permits not one evil deed to show itself among his daily usages. Ever thinking good, ever acting good, following goodness, and the effect is never otherwise than good.

Consider the world: he who slays another must repay with his life; he who saves another receives gratitude. Good begets good, evil begets evil; this is cause and effect, naturally following one another. It is said that a single good thought is Heaven, a single evil thought is Hell; Heaven and Hell are made by men themselves. Mencius said: "Blessings and calamities are nothing but what we seek ourselves." Laozi said: "Blessings and calamities have no door; men themselves invite them." Observe this, is not the principle of cause and effect clear and apparent?

Yet among men of the world there are many confused learners who do not believe in cause and effect. They harm others to profit themselves, injure Heaven and violate reason, and stop at nothing. Some deceive the ten directions, thinking they have gained advantage; some feign the Way to cheat the foolish and bewildered; some employ counterfeit arts to ruin families; some use illicit elixirs to lead men into evil; some speak false words and slander the wise; some plot secret schemes and destroy good deeds. All such are unbelievers in cause and effect.

Little do they know that doing good or doing evil is the path to the fruit to be borne. Cultivate the path of good, and in another day the Maker will send you on the road of blessing to enjoy happiness; cultivate the path of evil, and in another day the Maker will send you on the road of punishment to suffer misery. There is a proverb: "If you would know the affairs of your past life, look at the sufferings of your present life; if you would know the affairs of your future life, look at the deeds of your present life." These words are true and not false.

If you do not believe in the life to come, then look at this present life: those who in youth do good receive blessings in age; those who in youth do evil suffer punishment in age. This is known and seen by all men. I exhort those who sincerely seek the Way to speedily open the gate of cause and effect. Every thought, every deed, must be careful; every movement, every stillness, must not be neglected. First learn to be a good man who neither commits evil nor creates sin, then attend to great affairs and plan for advancement—thus may there be some accomplishment. If cause and effect are disregarded, if one would learn the Way yet still commit sin, knowing and yet ignoring, sin upon sin, vainly hoping to hear the Way—how difficult will it be!
