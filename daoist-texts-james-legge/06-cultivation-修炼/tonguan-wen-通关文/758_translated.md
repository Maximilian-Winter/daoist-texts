# On Fixing the Barrier of Emptiness

The Buddha said: Those who set their hearts upon Anuttara Samyak Sambodhi do not speak of the law as having the character of cessation or annihilation. The wise Chan master said: Each law gives birth to a wondrous law; emptiness is emptiness in essence, not empty; cessation and annihilation are not cessation and annihilation; wisdom perceives and awakens to the profound truth. The Heart Sutra says: Sariputra, form is not other than emptiness; emptiness is not other than form. Form is precisely emptiness; emptiness is precisely form. Wu Zhen said: Even if you have fully comprehended the true nature of thusness, you will not avoid abandoning the body only to enter the body. How does this compare with also cultivating the Great Elixir, and suddenly transcending the non-leakage to become a true man? Yuan Duzi said: Nowadays those who study the Way fail to receive the orthodox transmission, do not comprehend Ping Shu’s admonition not to enter the mountains before refining the Golden Elixir; they only desire to avoid clamour and seek quietude, to flee the world and be far from men, to cast off wives and children, to depart from dust and sever common customs, to dwell alone in barren valleys and deep mountains, considering themselves lofty; thus they abandon the laws of the mundane world. San Fengzi said: Cease boasting of your pure quietude and non-action, and then you may obtain the Golden Elixir. This all speaks of the Great Way as true emptiness yet not empty, and is not the study of dull emptiness and silence or annihilation. The Way is that which is utterly without and yet contains the utmost existence; utterly void and yet opens to the utmost reality; empty but not empty; not empty yet empty; thus law is twofold in use, unity of being and non-being, non-action and yet nothing is left undone. Consider how Heaven and Earth do not act, yet all things are born; the sun and moon do not act, yet the four seasons move; the sage does not act, yet the world is governed — this is activity within non-action, not the doctrine of empty emptiness and non-action. If you take empty emptiness and non-action as the Way, then the Way becomes a dead thing, not the Way of Heaven and Earth, the sun and moon, the sages; but a carved wood or modelled clay, a useless Way — how can this suffice to be called the Way? The so-called Way is the path. Men commonly travel the path; if no one travels it, it is no path. It is known that in the study of life and nature, one must first seek knowledge, then strive in practice; knowing is for the sake of practice, practice for the sake of completing knowledge. How much more so the cultivation of truth, which is cultivation and practice. The study of emptiness and silence — how can one say it is cultivation? To guard emptiness is acceptable; to call it cultivation is not. Therefore the dull emptiness of things was ridiculed by the ancients as grinding a brick to make a mirror, or piling snow for food — because it is void and not real. The confused learners of the world do not investigate the origin and flow of the Way, nor distinguish right from wrong in principle. Some give up in despair and stop thinking, forgetting things and forms; some guard the empty valley and keep quiet, not staining a single dust particle; some hold firm one orifice, nurture qi and preserve the spirit; some gaze fixedly on the crown, one thought uninterrupted; some look steadily into a mirror, hoping to transcend; some keep in mind the Bright Hall, imagining a red pearl. Such-like are all matters of dull emptiness and annihilation, not true cultivation of the Way, but indeed obscuring the Way. How can they return to the root and origin, comprehend nature and life, perfectly harmonize body and spirit, and unite with the Way in truth, transcending yin and yang and creation? Moreover, since birth man receives the partial qi of postnatal yin and yang and the five phases, and carries the mixed qi of the karmic dust of countless kalpas of reincarnation; if there be no great method to enlighten the gathering yin, no ability to reverse creation, and one merely ends the matter by empty emptiness and non-action, how can one return yin to yang, and uproot the seeds of karmic suffering through the kalpas? I exhort those with true hearts who study the Way to quickly open the barrier of emptiness at the mouth. Urgently seek a bright master, and seek another who can cause birth and rebirth in practical matters; begin early your efforts, and do not chase wind or grasp shadow, quench thirst by looking at plums, thus delaying your future and wasting your years. Otherwise, empty emptiness and non-action, neither grasping nor holding — what real help is there? To imagine oneself to become the Way is difficult indeed.
