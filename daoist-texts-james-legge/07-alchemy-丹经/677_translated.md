# The Nine Perfect Mysterious Precepts

The Nine Perfect Precepts are the precepts of the Daoist teaching, also called the “Nine Perfect Mysterious Precepts,” which may be held both by the living and the departed. They were personally declared by the Primordial Heavenly Honoured, and those who wear them ascend to the Nine Heavens; those who slight them fall into the Nine Earths. In the Tang, Song, Yuan, and Ming periods, the Nine Perfect Mysterious Precepts were commonly used precepts conferred in the bestowal of talismans. After taking refuge in the Three Treasures (the Treasure of the Dao, the Treasure of the Scriptures, and the Treasure of the Masters), the Nine Perfect Precepts were transmitted.

In volume thirty-four of the Scripture of Supreme Clarity and Spiritual Treasure for Deliverance and Complete Attainment of the Golden Book, entitled “The Gate of Literary Examination and Establishment,” there is a document of the Nine Perfect Precepts, in which the precepts are written, and it is said that the Nine Perfect Precepts “are the gates and windows of ascent to truth, the ferry and bridge for salvation in death.”

The Treatise on the Primordial Talisman for Deliverance from Suffering states: “These Nine Perfect Mysterious Precepts are the merit of deliverance, by which one is born above in Heaven; the same as the command given here.”

The Daoist Canon of Collected Methods, volume twenty, says: “The Nine Perfect Precepts are proclaimed to the spirits of the dead; to observe them with single-heartedness is to attain the wondrous Dao.”

The Purple Sovereign’s Secret Refining and Deliverance Scripture says: “The scriptures of the Three Caverns and the secret texts of the Four Divisions expound precepts differently; only the supreme Spiritual Treasure’s Nine Perfect Mysterious Precepts are revered alike by Heaven and man, honoured alike in the hidden and the manifest. Supreme above all supreme, profound beyond all profundity, the spirit of myriad gods, the treasure of the One Qi, wonderfully pervading the Three Powers, restraining the six passions, numbered and fixed in the Yang, divided into nine parts; cultivated without deceit, therefore named Perfect. All the world reveres them as their city walls; the hidden and manifest make use of them as their ladders and vessels; the spirits and souls receive them as their medicine and law.”

The Supreme Mysterious Origin’s Three Heavens Jade Hall Great Method states: “If men of the world can receive the Nine Perfect Mysterious Precepts, and wear the precious talisman for deliverance from suffering and for long life, on the day of their birth they receive great blessings; their lifespan is prolonged, their fate fulfilled, and they do not enter the cycle of rebirth, but proceed straight to the cinnabar heaven.”

The Scripture of the Supreme Primordial Heavenly Honoured, “The Mysterious Scripture of the North Emperor’s Incantation to Subdue Demons,” volume six, entitled “The Supreme Nine Perfect Mysterious Precepts Golden Talisman for Deliverance and Removal of Sin from the Nine Hells,” records:

One: Be diligent and loyal to the state;  
Two: Be respectful and yielding, to honour father and mother;  
Three: Do not kill; have compassion and save all beings;  
Four: Do not be licentious; keep the body pure;  
Five: Do not steal; follow justice and harm not oneself;  
Six: Do not be wrathful; anger is fierce and oppresses others;  
Seven: Do not deceive; falsehood and theft harm the good;  
Eight: Do not be arrogant; pride is neglect of truth;  
Nine: Be not divided; observe the precepts with single-hearted devotion.

The Supreme Nine Perfect Mysterious Precepts Golden Talisman Scripture for Deliverance and Removal of Sins

At that time, the Primordial Heavenly Honoured was in the Palace of the Three Primal Ones in the Nine Pure and Mysterious Realms, seated upon the cloud jade throne of the Three Breathings’ Floral Treasure, beneath the forest of flying trees, surrounded by the great saints, the Supreme Dao Lords, the Supreme Old Lord, the Nine Emperor Perfect Ones, the flying heavenly saints, the Mysterious Conduct Perfected Ones, the Four Administrators and the Five Emperors, the celestial dragons, gods and ghosts without number, all assembled at the precious terrace of the kalpa. The multitudes from the Ten Directions all rode five-coloured precious wheels, eight splendours chariots, mysterious and spiritual emerald banners, flying clouds and white canopies, qilin carriages and feathered pavilions, dragon banners and phoenix standards, lions and white cranes, singing and shouting harmoniously, burning incense and scattering flowers, wandering through the empty air and flying with steps, chanting the cave scriptures, paying homage to the Heavenly Honoured, inspecting and verifying the talismans, delivering from all suffering. At that time the light of the palace of the Three Primal Ones shone brightly, illuminating the vast emptiness, the spiritual capital of the Purple Tenuity, reflecting upon the Ten Directions, reaching down to the limit of the Infinite Realm. In the long night of the Nine Hells, the seeds of good and evil fate shone resplendently, and all the mysterious officials were illuminated, each heavenly palace was visible. The Primordial Heavenly Honoured and the great assembly proclaimed the utmost wondrous truths, enlightening men and Heaven, marking the merits of good works, inscribing yellow talismans, golden tablets and jade slips, displaying the Three Pure Ones, all visible even in each hell. The Heavenly Honoured who delivers from suffering from the Ten Directions entered the Nine Hells and saved those who suffer, commanding the North Emperor, the Three Officials and Nine Bureaus, the one hundred and twenty offices, the Five Emperors’ assessors, the child inspectors of fate, the registers of fate, the officers of merit and execution, the Earth Sovereign’s nine camps, the four bright lords and their followers, the five sacred mountains’ clerks, the punishers and divine soldiers, the mighty heavenly warriors, the celestial cavalry, the ox-headed jailers, the mighty sword-bearing kings, the great demons of the Three Realms, and the nine hundred million ghost kings—all gathered in the Nine Hells, jointly receiving the teaching and precepts.

At that time, the Beiyu North Emperor and the ghost officials were all trembling with fear, each thinking thus: “We have accumulated sins, we are the ghost officials, commanding the underworld, always dwelling in darkness, moving through countless kalpas without seeing the light; why today do we suddenly feel the august saint’s bright and resplendent light universally shining upon the heavy darkness, as if about to inquire of us? We doubt and dare not believe.” At that moment, sweeping through the prison there were many sinners whose names were entered in the black register. The ox-headed jailers drove them up the Knife Mountain; their heads and bodies were rotten and broken, their limbs scattered; among them alone was one who walked up and down the mountain, pursued the trees high and low, trod upon edges and blades, yet without a single injury; all the knives and spears were transformed into lotus flowers. The North Emperor was greatly startled, and prostrated himself to offer thanks, reporting to the Heavenly Honoured: “Your disciple, by unfortunate destiny, serves as an official of the underworld, dwelling in Beiyu, for countless ages, often seeing sinners endure all manner of suffering and torment. Also, in the eastern prison of wind and thunder there are black winds and shaking thunder and lightning, flying halberds and drifting spears, striking sinners, dispersing their limbs, piercing through their five viscera, suffering for countless kalpas without respite day or night. In the southern fire prison there are sinners who swallow fire and eat charcoal, burnt by the fire; their heads and faces are scorched, wearing a fire mountain upon their heads; their skin and flesh burst into flame, suffering for countless kalpas without respite day or night. In the western diamond prison there are sinners tormented by iron hammers and rods without number; their limbs are rotten, their sinews and bones scattered; iron forks pierce their bellies, golden hammers press upon their hearts, suffering for countless kalpas without respite day or night. In the northern chilling prison sinners are sunk into the cold pool of death; ice spears and frost blades break sinews and bones; the juice of a hundred poisons is poured upon them; their limbs are scattered, their hearts and bellies destroyed, suffering for countless kalpas without respite day or night. In the central prison of universal sweeping sinners are scourged and beaten, pain so fierce it is unbearable; tendons are severed, blood flows; they swoon and fall to the ground. Then the jailers use iron forks to stab them, forcing each sinner to climb the Knife Mountain and Sword Trees, the eight winds blowing in all directions, bending the trees high and low; their feet tread the Knife Mountain, their bodies hung with sword blades, suffering for countless kalpas without respite day or night. In the southeast copper pillar prison sinners have copper pillars upon their bodies, fierce fire and blazing flames, forcing sinners to hold on and climb; inside and out they are scorched and rotten, their bellies and backs filled with sores, suffering for countless kalpas without respite day or night. In the southwest prison of butchering sinners are hung upside down, their bodies cut by knives and swords; their limbs, sinews, skin, and five viscera are all cut by blades; sinners’ blood flows over the ground, unbearable to endure, suffering for countless kalpas without respite day or night. In the northwest prison of the fiery chariot sinners are torn apart by five chariots, their limbs scattered; their bodies are placed in the fiery chariots, the four wheels turning east, west, south, and north, each with blades that cut sinners as they turn; fierce fire is added, burning and scorching them, suffering for countless kalpas without respite day or night. In the northeast boiling cauldron prison sinners are pierced with iron forks, dipped in boiling cauldrons; their bodies boil and rot, their limbs decay, pus, blood, and foul stench unbearable to endure, suffering for countless kalpas without respite day or night. It is unknown by what cause these sinners now walk the Knife Mountain and Sword Trees without any injury, their knives and blades transformed into lotus flowers, their appearances perfect and dignified, walking alone without fear; all the torments imposed cannot harm them. Suddenly the august saint turned back his carriage, the celestial beings descended and gathered; all trembled in fear, unable to know. They only wished that the Heavenly Honoured, in great mercy and compassion, would universally save and deliver all those who suffer in the Nine Hells, removing all sins, enabling them to recognise their past fate, abandon evil and follow good, so as to escape the Nine Hells, be encompassed in light, return merits and blessings, long obtain liberation, and forever leave the three sufferings.

At that time, the beings in the Nine Hells heard the North Emperor’s wide plea, their hearts were moved to repentance, they wished to seek removal of sins, raising their voices to lament, making a sound that shook Brahmā Heaven. Thereupon the Heavenly Honoured of Deliverance from Suffering in the Ten Directions, with great compassion and observant mind, spread himself universally to all, his majestic light endowed their bodies; granting the six penetrations and wisdom, he caused all sinners to close their eyes and meditate quietly. In a moment they recognised their past fate and each clearly understood the evil deeds done in their lives. Some had killed sovereigns and fathers, been unfilial to parents; some had slandered the Great Way, turning from truth to falsehood; some had injured brothers and plotted rebellion against teachers; some had consorted with kin in licentiousness; some had been robbers and murderers; some had butchered living beings for their own benefit; some had oppressed the weak by force, the noble tyrannising the humble; some had spoken falsely of the Three Treasures, held their minds not single; some had disrespected the masters, defiled and despised the spiritual writings; some harboured secret thieves in their hearts, enduring jealousy and spite; some had evil mouths and double tongues, causing strife among good men; some had killed living beings, committed the four sins of lust, exposed the three lights; some had in heart, in speech, or by personal action or teaching, accumulated sins through countless kalpas. All these sins they now suddenly recalled, each understanding clearly, their anguish greatly increased, wishing for liberation.

The Heavenly Honoured universally declared to the four groups: “Hear attentively, these sinners have for countless kalpas not believed in the scriptures and teachings, only accumulating sin, evil bound to evil, their sins full and fixed, so that their names are entered in the evil book; their bodies descend into the Nine Hells, sinking into the three sufferings, unable to escape. But amongst them is this one person, who during life established the Great Nine Hells Fast, received and observed the golden talisman and white slips of the Nine Perfect Mysterious Precepts, marked in gold and inscribed in jade purity, with virtue weighty and merit high, sensing and connecting to the upper realms. By my divine power I have followed with thought to protect and save him. Now I shall widely proclaim the prohibition of precepts, cutting off all evil roots, that you may all be liberated at once.” When the North Emperor heard this, his heart was greatly joyful beyond measure; he gazed upon the august countenance and made a hymn:

“Good indeed, Primordial Honoured, Father and Mother of all beings.  
Your light pours forth from the Purple Tenuity Palace, bending to illuminate the gates of the Nine Hells.  
The towering cold hill court reflects the vast ice shore.  
The flaming fierce fire blazes, showering the law as rain.  
Perfectly penetrating great compassion and wisdom, always kindly saving all suffering.  
Delivering souls through the long night, now we bow and pay homage.”

When the North Emperor finished this hymn, the multitude of heavens all voiced their assent; the music of the sovereign heaven played in harmony, myriad kinds intermingled, banners, canopies, incense, and flowers shaded all below. Then the Primordial Heavenly Honoured again addressed the four groups: “Hear attentively and quietly think within your hearts. I shall now manifest and declare to you the Nine Perfect Mysterious Precepts, golden talisman and white slips; the merits of receiving and observing them deliver from difficulty and suffering, with divine power beyond thought; all spirits bow and humbly receive the teaching and command.” The Heavenly Honoured declared:

== One: Be diligent, loyal to your sovereign;  
Two: Be respectful and yielding, to honour father and mother;  
Three: Do not kill, be compassionate and save all beings;  
Four: Do not be licentious, keep the body pure;  
Five: Do not steal, follow righteousness and harm not oneself;  
Six: Do not be wrathful, fierce anger oppresses others;  
Seven: Do not deceive, falsehood and theft harm the good;  
Eight: Do not be arrogant, pride neglects truth;  
Nine: Be not divided, observe the precepts with single-hearted devotion. ==

The Primordial Talisman Command Golden Talisman and White Slips for Deliverance from Suffering, the True Talisman for Rescue, issues commands to the ten directions’ Infinite Worlds, the Three Officials and Nine Bureaus, the one hundred and twenty offices, the Five Emperors’ assessors, the Nine Hells, mighty heavenly warriors, commanding divine soldiers, registers and recorders of fate, officers of merit and execution, ox-headed jailers, great demons of the Three Realms, to deliver the departed soul from hell, to forever leave the long night, to behold the light, to have all sins washed away, grievances reconciled and released. By this Nine Perfect Mysterious Precepts deliverance merit, one is born above in Heaven, the same as the command given here, transmitted by wind and fire as courier.

In the year of the Grand Duke, on a certain month, a certain day of the new moon, the fasting altar issued this command.

The Primordial Talisman Command Golden Talisman and White Slips of Long Life Spirit Talisman issues commands to the Southern Cinnabar Heaven world, the Vermilion Mound Fire Mansion, the Southern Prosperity Upper Palace, the Long Life Great Lord, Commander Han, registers of fate, the Lord of Prolonging Life and Enhancing Calculations for Deliverance from Calamity, the Great God of Resurrection and Birth, to supernaturally deliver the departed soul to ascend to the Vermilion Palace’s Flowing Fire Court, their jade eyes refining their essence, their yellow blossoms washing away form, inscribing their name in a purple register, receiving transformation and rebirth. By this golden talisman’s merit for deliverance, at each moment they ascend and progress, the same as the command given here, transmitted by wind and fire as courier.

In the year of the Grand Duke, on a certain month, a certain day of the new moon, the fasting altar issued this command.

If you can receive and observe the golden talisman and white slips of the Nine Perfect Mysterious Precepts, the Long Life Spirit Talisman and True Talisman for Deliverance from Suffering, the great sins of the Nine Hells will be dispelled, your name inscribed in the Nine Palaces, with the child inspectors of fate, the protective precept gods, the Five Emperors’ talisman, and the six palaces’ clerks guarding you; you shall follow the instructions and be covered and protected as a disciple of the precepts. The Heavenly Honoured further said: If there is unrest in the country with soldiers and disasters unceasing, epidemics and poisons prevailing, then the ruler, consorts, princes, dukes and the multitudes should also set up the Great Nine Hells Fast, each receiving and observing the golden talisman and precious talisman of the Nine Perfect Precepts; then the warfare and disasters will cease, demons and evil will be kept away, Heaven and men will be pleased, and the country rejoice in peace. If you are in the mountains or wilderness, pursued by tigers, wolves, or fierce beasts, you should keep in mind and think of the golden slips, spirit talisman, child inspectors of fate, precept masters, and protective divine kings; then the fierce beasts will withdraw and not harm you. If you enter the great sea and encounter evil winds, you should also keep these in mind; the wind and waves will calm and you will reach the shore. If you are in the midst of an army or white blades, you should keep these in mind; the weapons will lie hidden and not cause harm. If you are imprisoned with shackles and chains, you should keep these in mind; your grievances will be redressed and you will surely be freed. If you are beset by evil spirits, demons, and thieves, you should keep these in mind; the ghosts and goblins will be destroyed and you will naturally be healed. If a person’s fate is to enter the Nine Hells, their name entered in the black register, their spouses, sons, daughters, disciples, and classmates should establish the Great Nine Hells Fast, inscribe the white slips, receive the Nine Perfect Mysterious Precepts, and burn the black register; then those sinners will be released in due time, their souls ascending to the Nine Heavens, their karmic cycles turning, becoming the Perfected Ones of the Nine Palaces. The Heavenly Honoured further said: The golden talisman, mysterious precepts, and long life spirit talisman are awe-inspiring and of utmost power; if one can cultivate them according to the method, their blessings are immeasurable. But if anyone arise in mind to slander or hold disrespectful thoughts, know that such a person has accumulated evil for ten thousand kalpas, their sins and obstacles are deep and heavy, their name entered in the evil register, their body lost to the ghost officials; after death, they will surely sink into the Nine Hells, enduring all manner of torment, in an endless long night, without escape. Suppose someone at first accepts faith but afterwards grows arrogant; the child inspectors of fate report to the Three Officials, who cancel the golden slips, inscribe the death register; or the person may fall ill in the world with evil diseases, scabies, ulcers and sores, rejected and abandoned by men, unable to live or to die, tormented and anxious, without means of liberation; or suffer long under violent injury, or offend royal law, or offend weapons and soldiers, or offend tigers and wolves, or offend water and fire, or offend evil tongues and curses; their household is discordant, their clans quarrel, their enemies draw them into conflict; once they lose the true path, they fall long into the bad destinies. Therefore, you all must follow the regulations and observe them without strange thoughts, proclaiming the precepts to men and women, so that all will hear and know. At that time the North Emperor and the four groups of sinners in the Nine Hells, hearing these words, their hearts enlightened and freed, each generated good thoughts, all their sufferings removed and released, body and mind calm and at ease, all aroused the resolve for the Dao, their nature no longer retreating. At that time the black registers of the Nine Hells were all burnt to ashes; the fire mountain’s flames ceased, the ice pool’s waves stilled; swallowing fire and eating charcoal transformed into sweet dew; golden hammers and iron rods changed into lotus flowers. They flew in the empty air and composed this hymn:

“I bow to the Supreme Dao, returning my heart to the Primordial Honoured.  
The Perfect and Wondrous Responsive Lord, opens and enlightens the mysterious gates.  
The wondrous precepts delight the five spirits, the golden writings warn the myriad gods.  
Inspecting fate and fixing the registers, the spiritual talisman delivers the suffering soul.  
Riding clouds to the Jade Emperor, all conforming to the mysterious celestial beings.”

Thus ends the Supreme Nine Perfect Mysterious Precepts Golden Talisman Scripture for Deliverance and Removal of Sins.
