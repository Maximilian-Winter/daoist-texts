# Direct Pointing to the Same and Different: Preface

The seven returns and nine reversions, the Golden Liquid, the great return—this is the Way of the Elixir, secret to Heaven and Earth, and dreaded by ghosts and spirits. Through successive sages it has been handed down by word of mouth, without record in writing. Therefore, those who study the Way are as numerous as the hairs of oxen, while those who understand the Way are as rare as the horn of the qilin; besides these, there are three thousand and six hundred side doors, seventy-two winding paths and schools, which confound the true with the false, and confuse the genuine with the counterfeit. Though there may be one or two men of purpose, yet they cannot distinguish jade from stone; like water bearing the form of the horizon, the clear and enlightened see, but how many are there who are not led astray by the wicked Way?

In the Eastern Han, the Perfected Wei Boyang obtained the transmission from the Perfected Yin of Longevity; he attained perfect comprehension and completed the great work. Out of compassion for later generations who love the Way, he based his work upon the Dao of the Book of Changes and composed the "Direct Pointing to the Same and Different," divided into three parts—upper, middle, and lower. The beginning expounds the Way of Imperial Governance; the middle discusses the principle of nurturing nature; the end relates the methods of concealed ingestion. The arranged sections run through one principle, opening distinct gateways, employing many allegories, and leading the way forward; by means of the manifest to illustrate the unmanifest, by the form to indicate the formless.

In it, the medicines and the timing of the fire—there is not one thing omitted. After the book was completed, the worthy Xu Gong of Jingxiu in various prefectures was invited, and he annotated the three parts to elucidate the subtleties contained within the "Pointing." The Perfected Wei further transmitted it to Chunyu Shutong of the same commandery; the Chunyu family then composed the two parts of the "Three Kinds in Categories," supplementing and completing what was left unsaid in the "Direct Pointing to the Same and Different." Thus the principles of the Golden Elixir were fully revealed without remainder.

The Three Elders all compiled and collated the "Heart Seal" in their writings; it is incomparable to all other imitations and conjectures. This is the very "Same and Different" of the "Direct Pointing." The myriad volumes of later elixir scriptures all base themselves upon this. Hence all call it the Master of Elixir Scriptures of Ten Thousand Ages. Master Zhu composed a critical and variant annotation of the "Same and Different;" Master Cheng Xiangshan likewise praised it; thus it is known that this book is esteemed by both Confucianism and Daoism.

Having exhausted this book, which has circulated long in the world, its order is in confusion; annotators and commentators each put forth their own views; some place that which is earlier after what is later, others the later before the former; some confound the scripture with the commentary, some intermingle the preface with the main text. Not only is the meaning incoherent, and the order greatly mistaken, but there is no distinction as to what is scripture and what is annotation, nor who belongs to Wei, who to Xu, who to Chunyu, so that it all seems to be the work of the Perfected Wei alone. Worse still, there are ignorant persons who circulate it as a manual of smelting and forging, or mistakenly treat it as treatises on burning and refining, slandering the sacred Way, burying the true tradition, and grievously failing the compassionate heart of the Three Elders who sought to save the world. Can their guilt be lightly spoken of?

In the year Renyin of the Qianlong reign, by chance I obtained the commentaries of the Nameless Perfected Weng and the Upper-Yang Perfected Chen. Their scripture and annotations are each divided into distinct categories; the sections and order interconnect; scripture stands apart from annotation, supplements apart from supplements, text apart from text, preface apart from preface; the division between red and blue, black and white is clear and manifest; the long-standing grievances against the true scripture are thereby undone.

Between the two annotations, Chen’s is more orderly; therefore I take Chen’s text as the basis; where the main text’s order seems disconnected, I have slightly rearranged it, dividing it into sections with annotations. All the similes and metaphorical expressions are thoroughly broken down to pieces. With careful examination of the Direct Pointing, what is furnace and cauldron, what is medicine, what is yin and yang, what is the five phases, what is the prior heaven, what is the later heaven, what is the timing of fire, what is cooking and refining, what is internal and external, what is beginning and end—all is plainly revealed, the essence laid bare.

After the book’s completion, it was named "Direct Pointing to the Same and Different." Should any fellow traveller see and read it, he will know that the Way of the "Same and Different" is indeed the secret handed down orally through the saints of old. The annotations of Wuyuan are nothing but the words of wild foxes and twisting vines. Where the main text’s order may be disjointed, it will especially rely on the correction of later enlightened ones.

In the spring of the first month of the first day of the year Yimao of the fourth year of the Jiaqing reign of the Great Qing, on Mount Qiyun,

The simple and plain hermit Wuyuanzi Liu Yiming composed this preface in the Free and Easy Nest.
