# The Scripture of the Triple Unity: Direct Exposition (Part One on the Regulation of Government)

Heaven and Earth are firm and yielding, conjoined and mutually enveloped. The yang holds and the yin receives; the female and the male mutually require each other. They must depend on creation and transformation, then the vital essence and breath are freely unfolded. Kan and Li are the crown and head, their light shining and spreading. The mysterious and dark are hard to fathom, impossible to delineate in diagram. The sage measures and weighs, and participates in the sequence of primal principles. The four are in confusion and chaos, directly entering the void and nothingness. The sixty hexagrams revolve, spread and arrange themselves as a chariot. The dragon-horse takes its place, the wise ruler governs the time. If there be harmony, then following and compliance ensue, the road is even and not crooked; if the way be crooked and dangerous, it will overturn and ruin the state.

The Great Way is without sound and scent, neither colour nor emptiness, what then is there to say? Yet within the soundlessness and scentlessness are hidden yin and yang; within the non-colour and non-emptiness is contained creation and transformation. If indeed there were no speech, how then might the coming and going of yin and yang be known? How could the secret mechanism of creation and transformation be enlightened? Therefore the ancients said: “The Way originally has no words; words serve to manifest the Way.” Heaven does not conceal the Way; the dragon-horse bears the diagram from the river, revealing the secret of Heaven. Fu Xi follows this and draws the Earlier Heaven Eight Trigrams, then doubles them to form the sixty-four hexagrams. King Wen descended and again changed them into the Later Heaven Eight Trigrams, extended into the sixty-four hexagrams of the Later Heaven, subdivided into three hundred and eighty-four lines. And again these are connected with words, elucidating the principles of good and evil fortune, proclaiming the sacred Ten Wings, expounding the meaning of the text. Thus the principles of the Earlier and Later Heaven are clear and complete; the Way of Heaven and Earth in creation and transformation is manifest. Hence the book of the Changes (Yi) is the storehouse of reason for those seeking sages and worthies in China, the root of cultivation of the Way and establishment of virtue. What the Confucian school follows is this book; what the Daoist school adheres to is this book. The Yellow Emperor’s Yin Fu, Laozi’s Dao De, their principles and meanings all secretly accord with the principles of the Yi. Yet the profound words and subtle meanings of the sages, later generations seldom can fathom their traces, it is hard to peep at their further shore. Even if one or two good materials and men of purpose grasp one or two words or half a phrase, still there is no place at which to begin. The Immortal Elder Boyang, with many cares in his heart, adopts the sages’ mind of saving the world, bases himself on the Way of the Yi, and unfolds the secrets of the Ming Fu and Dao De, a thousand and a hundred metaphors, winding out the full discourse, intending that everyone should attain the Way and each should realize the truth. Later, all the alchemical scriptures and treatises are based on the Triple Unity. Hence the Triple Unity is the king of alchemical scriptures for all ages. The name of the alchemical scripture in truth originates here; the name of the Golden Elixir also begins here. Man is born holding within him the qi of Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang and the Five Phases; within the body is this very qi of yin and yang and of the Five Phases, the virtue of yin and yang and the Five Phases. Qi belongs to life; virtue attributes. Thus nature and life are formed of the qi of Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang and Five Phases. The study of cultivation of nature and life cannot be apart from the Way of Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang and Five Phases, there is no other art. The Yi is indeed the Way of Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang and Five Phases; if one can understand the Way of the Yi, then the sacred Way may be known. Therefore the Way of the Yi begins with Qian and Kun and proceeds to recount the hexagrams. The Triple Unity also begins with Qian and Kun and proceeds to expound the Way; the principle of the Triple Unity is based on the principle of the Yi. The Yi begins with Qian and Kun: Qian is strength, and takes the symbol of Heaven. Heaven is yang and utterly firm; firmness governs strength, hence it is said that Qian is firm. Kun is compliance, and takes the symbol of Earth. Earth is yin and utterly soft; softness governs compliance, hence Kun is soft. Qian and Kun establish position; firmness and softness mutually envelop; Qian holds the yang qi, Kun receives the yin qi; one female and one male mutually complement and act in creation and transformation; then the essence of yang and the qi of yin may be freely unfolded and generate all things. The Yi takes Kan and Li as centre: Kan is yin outside and yang within, symbolizing the moon; Li is yang outside and yin within, symbolizing the sun. Sun and moon are the essence and soul of Heaven and Earth, acting in place of Heaven and Earth to effect creation and transformation, the crown and head of qi movement. The sun shines and the moon attends, light shining and spreading; the four seasons proceed and all things grow, collect, and store; all is natural and spontaneous. Heaven and Earth’s firmness and softness enable the unfolding of essence and qi; the coming and going of sun and moon enable the shining and illumination; yet within there is an invisible and formless thing moving. Its principle is most divine and subtle, hard to measure and know, impossible to draw in diagram. Therefore the sage weighs the coming and going of yin and yang, participates in the sequence of its primal root and foundation, to show its mystery. The four are confused and chaotic and enter the void and nothingness; the Yi takes Qian and Kun as body and Kan and Li as function. The four in confusion return to the single qi of void and nothingness; the single qi flows, yin then yang, yang then yin, yin and yang intersecting, beginning at Tun and Meng, ending at Ji Wei. The remaining sixty hexagrams alternate yin and yang in movement, spread and arrange as a chariot. Dragon-horse takes its place, the wheel revolves on its axis, to carry out creation and transformation; this is the great outline of the Yi. It is the first to issue the sages of all things, riding the six dragons to govern Heaven. Movement and rest follow the time, consistent with the Yi, not daring to err even slightly. The Yi bases itself on the harmony of yin and yang. He who regulates government observes the Way of Heaven, holds fast to Heaven’s movement; this is called being able to harmonize. If harmonized, all the people follow; the kingly Way is clear and open; the road is level and not crooked. He who regulates government transgresses the Way of Heaven, loses Heaven’s movement; this is called disharmony. If disharmonious, there is no accord between high and low; crooked and dangerous ways arise, the state is overturned and endangered. Compare this with the cultivator of the Way: firmness and strength and soft compliance are body; firmness and softness in justness are function. Firmness and softness united, like the matching of Qian and Kun; firmness and softness in justness, like the light of Kan and Li hanging down. Firmness and softness appropriate, strength and compliance mingled and formed, essence and qi abundant, the sovereign of the heart empty and spiritual, manifesting the heavenly principle, with heart correct the heart and body may be cultivated. Governing the body and governing the state is one principle; if the heart be correct the ruler is correct; this is one Way. There has never been a ruler not correct who could govern the time; never has the heart been not correct who could complete the Way. The Immortal Elder first uses the principle of the Yi to regulate government, presenting it as a guiding principle. Especially with the Way of nature and life, one Way of the Yi. The matter of cultivating the person is like governing government. One who does not understand the Way of the Yi cannot cultivate nature and life; one who does not understand government cannot cultivate heart and person. The Way of the Yi and regulation of government are both based on the harmony of yin and yang. To cultivate and maintain nature and life is to contain the Way of harmony of yin and yang; externally there is no other method. This section emphasizes the single word ‘harmony’: if harmonized the road is level and not crooked; if not harmonized the way is dangerous and perilous; can the learner not first know this harmony?

The gentleman dwells in his chamber, speaks words of goodness, and is responded to a thousand li away. The lord of ten thousand chariots, occupying the ninefold seat, issuing commands and orders, conforms to yin and yang’s seasons. Concealing his abilities and awaiting the time, he does not violate the hexagram months. Tun is with Zi and Shen, Meng uses Yin and Xu. The remaining sixty hexagrams each have their day. Briefly stating two images, not yet fully exhausted. Establishing righteousness and setting laws, acting with benevolence and applying virtue, those who oppose it are unfortunate, those who follow it are fortunate. According to the times and laws (doubtful reading “issue”), with utmost sincerity and secrecy, carefully await the day and hour, examine the coming and going. A tiny flaw is not right, regret and grief become thieves. The two solstices alter the measure, deviating and twisting. Midwinter and great heat, midsummer frost and snow. The two parts spreading wide and long, not missing a moment. Water and drought contend, wind and rain are irregular, locusts swarm and overflow, strange creatures emerge aside. Heaven sees their marvels; mountains crumble and earth cracks. The filial son applies his heart, moving the imperial pole. Near at hand it issues from the mouth; far it flows to distant lands. Sometimes it summons calamity, sometimes it brings blessing; sometimes it causes great peace, sometimes it creates war and upheaval. The coming of the four is from the chest and breast. Movement and rest have their constant; following their rule and measure. The four seasons in due order, in accord with the qi. Firmness and softness are distinct, do not interfere. The Five Phases guard their boundaries, do not rashly expand or contract.

The preceding section says that yin and yang harmonize, then action may be taken. But where there is yin and yang, there must be birth and death; birth and death are distinct, yin and yang mutually require each other. To govern a state by it, the state may be governed; to cultivate the person by it, the person may be cultivated. The Way of cultivation of truth is to model Heaven and imitate Earth; each word and act must be careful and close, secretly accord with Heaven and Earth’s creation and transformation, only then can one unite virtue with Heaven and seize the qi and numbers of Heaven and Earth for oneself. The Commentary on the Appended Statements says: "The gentleman dwells in his chamber, speaks words of goodness, and is responded to a thousand li away." Cultivating words and establishing sincerity is thus to advance virtue. Because virtue is advanced, words must be sincere. The chamber is the place unknown to others but known to oneself. Dwelling in one’s chamber and being able to be cautious when alone, quietly observing and closely examining, not speaking at random; when words do issue, they must be entirely good. Good words have trust; trust means conduct is without fault; thus one may move Heaven and Earth, affect things and be responded to beyond a thousand li. The ruler of government observes the Way of Heaven, holds fast to Heaven’s movement, issues commands and orders, must regard the seasons of yin and yang and not dare to disobey Heaven’s movement; this is the pivot and mechanism of the words and conduct of the gentleman. The issuing of commands is the lord of honour and disgrace. The cultivator of the Way uses firmness and softness, models himself on one who regulates government, issues commands and orders, follows yin and yang’s seasons. There is none whose heart is not correct and whose person is not cultivated, whose nature is not complete and whose destiny is not established. What is issuing commands and orders conforming to yin and yang’s seasons? The yang season is to promote and generate all things; the yin season is to gather and restrain all things. In cultivation there is the method of advance and retreat: when yang is present, apply yang; when yin is present, apply yin. To use yang is to advance; to use yin is to retreat. Each advance and retreat has its season; this is called Heaven and man issuing together, following yin and yang in command and order. Concealing the instrument and awaiting the time, do not violate the hexagram months. There are twelve months in the year; the upper six months belong to yang; the lower six months belong to yin. From Zi to Si, Fu, Lin, Tai, Da Zhuang, Guai, Qian, six yang hexagrams govern; from Wu to Hai, Gou, Dun, Pi, Guan, Bo, Kun, six yin hexagrams govern. Yin and yang hexagrams and qi each act in its time. The twelve months traverse the sixty hexagrams, three hundred and sixty days in all; each day acts one line, three hundred and sixty lines in all; one month of thirty days acts five hexagrams, thirty lines in all. Beginning after the winter solstice, beginning at Tun and Meng, and ending at Ji Wei. For example Tun and Meng: Tun is a hexagram combining Kan and Zhen; Kan is water, Zhen is thunder; thunder within water, yang moves within yin. Tun is with Zi and Shen; Kan is at Zi, water. Water is born in Shen, vigourous at Zi; yang qi reaches Zi and ascends; yang acts. Meng is a hexagram combining Gen and Kan; Gen is mountain, Kan is water; water is under the mountain; yang qi stops within yin. Meng uses Yin and Xu; Gen is at Yin storing fire; fire is born in Yin, stored in Xu; yang qi reaches Xu and is concealed; yin acts. Tun governs the birth of yang; Meng governs the nurturing of yang. The Way of alchemy is to hide the instrument within the body, to wait for the time and then use it. When advancing yang, the yin within returns to yang to advance fire, as Tun’s yang moves within yin; when yang is sufficient and yang within moves yin to retreat fire, as Meng’s yang stops within yin. The remaining sixty hexagrams each have their day; the month has five hexagrams, three hundred and sixty days traverse sixty hexagrams. This is the previous section’s sixty hexagrams revolving and spreading as a chariot. Briefly stating two images, not yet fully exhausted, giving Tun and Meng as examples of inversion and rectification. The remaining fifty-eight hexagrams each invert and rectify, each acting their hexagram qi; one may infer by analogy and know, no need to exhaust them all. Of the sixty-four hexagrams, only sixty are spoken of here; for the Way of creation and transformation takes Qian and Kun as body, Kan and Li as function; the sixty hexagrams all issue from the four trigrams Qian, Kun, Kan, Li, generated by one yin and one yang in change. The cultivator of the Way, if he know this coming and going, then he understands increase and decrease, knows darkness and dawn. Taking Qian and Kun as body, Kan and Li as function, one moving and one still, the sixty hexagrams arise naturally; not holding to hexagram images, they accord with hexagram images themselves. To establish righteousness and set laws, act with benevolence and apply virtue: righteousness is firmness and governs punishment; benevolence is softness and governs virtue. When firm, apply firmness with righteousness to punish; when soft, apply softness with benevolence to bestow virtue. To set punishments is to remove alien qi; to bestow virtue is to nurture the qi of the ruler. Righteousness perfects benevolence; benevolence serves righteousness; benevolence and righteousness proceed together; punishment and virtue both applied, then the Great Elixir is first completed. To contravene this, yin and yang become discordant and unfortunate; to conform to this, yin and yang harmonize and are fortunate. Therefore one must according to the season await, issue orders and act; the Spirit and Brightness move silently; the intention is sincere and secret; to guard against danger and peril; carefully await the days of yang and yin arising. Examine the coming and going and apply them, not daring to be at all negligent. The one word sincerity is the beginning and end of the cultivator of the Way. A tiny flaw not correct becomes untruth. Untruth becomes regret and grief as thief; yin and yang are untimely; the two solstices alter their measure; yin and yang are disharmonious; the two parts spread wide and long; many such evil omens appear. Though the great Way is in sight, it will not allow me to complete. If firmness and softness be just and centered, one sincerity touch Heaven, evil may be changed to good, danger may become easy. Just as the filial son with sincere heart can move the imperial pole. Formerly the great Shun encountered the hardship of his parents, cried and wailed to Heaven with little complaint, completed his granary and dug his wells, no one dared oppose him. The blind and deaf who burned the granary and covered the well, all did not die; the Son of Heaven repaid the filial son thus. The cultivator of the Way, if he can unite human heart with Heaven’s heart, reverse light and darkness, but for a moment only. Does Heaven oppose? Heaven does not oppose me; how much less then man? How much less then ghosts and spirits? The near from one’s own mouth, the far flowing to distant lands, is just as the gentleman dwelling in his chamber, speaking words of goodness, is responded to a thousand li away; if dwelling in his chamber he utters words not good, then a thousand li away he is rejected. Therefore sometimes calamity is summoned, sometimes blessing is brought; sometimes great peace arises and all bodies are in order; sometimes war and upheaval arise and six cities are in turmoil. Good and evil, calamity and blessing are all within a single thought in the breast. The square is the voice of the heart, appearing within and forming without. If the heart be correct, then words are good and bring blessing and great peace; if the heart be not correct, words are not good and summon calamity and war. Therefore movement and rest have their constant; following their rule and measure, not biased or inclined; conforming to time and circumstance, following or resisting, in accord with the qi of four seasons yin and yang; then use firmness and use softness, each attains its due; here is decision and measure. The Commentary on the Appended Statements says: “Movement and rest have their constant; firmness and softness are distinct” — this is what it means. Firmness and softness have decision; one will not apply firmness where softness is proper, nor softness where firmness is proper. Metal, wood, water, fire, earth, the Five Phases each guard their boundaries; the five origins and five virtues each hold their places; also do not rashly expand or contract; all is one qi, the principle of Heaven flows and does not cease. This section emphasizes the phrase “movement and rest have their constant.” To have movement and rest constant is to issue commands and orders; to follow yin and yang’s seasons is for the Five Phases to guard their boundaries; not rashly expanding or contracting is the gentleman dwelling in his chamber, speaking words of goodness; all have constant and intention sincere and secret; no movement not following, no word not good; conforming or resisting, advancing or retreating, there is nothing that can or cannot be done.

The Yi moves and flows around, bending and stretching, returning and turning over. Hidden and concealed, changing within, embracing and containing all things, is the Way’s order and rule. To use the void to govern the existence; the instrument is emptiness.

The preceding section spoke of issuing commands and orders, it must be according to yin and yang’s seasons to obtain good fortune. Some may think there is intention in acting, but in truth there is no intention. Consider the movement of the Yi hexagrams, a single qi up and down, circulating through six voids, its bending, stretching, returning, and turning over, hidden and concealed, though unseen and unheard, yet from the utmost void contains the utmost existence, from the utmost emptiness contains the utmost reality, within which changes are infinite, embracing and containing all things, is the Way’s order and rule. The bending, stretching, returning and turning over is the one yin and one yang called the Way; changing within is the unfathomable yin and yang called the Spirit. Using the Spirit to operate the Way, with the Way manifesting the Spirit; thus from nothing is made something, using the instrument and returning to emptiness. The Yi has no thought, no action, silent and unmoving; it responds and thus communicates; the affairs of the world, what mind has the Yi? The Way of nature and life is one Yi Way. Yi has no mind; cultivation of the Way also has no mind; the use of no mind is to follow the time and apply. Following the time is to regard its principle; following principle and acting, movement issues from Heaven, not from man; what mind is there?

Therefore weighing the coming and going, Kan and Li sink and vanish. Words are not carelessly made; theories are not falsely born; bringing proof and seeing effect; measuring and weighing the use of yin and yang Spirit; comparing kinds and forming characters; tracing the principle and taking it as proof; making it easy to know and understand. Kan receives Wu as the month essence; Li receives Ji as the daylight. Sun and moon are Yi; firmness and softness correspond. Earth governs the four seasons, encompassing beginning and end. Green, red, white, black each occupy one place, all holding the central palace, the work of Wu and Ji.

The preceding section said there is use in non-use, but the use of non-existence is difficult for men to measure and weigh. Therefore the sage clarifies the coming and going of yang, the meeting of Kan and Li, sinking and vanishing; compares the form to the formless, compares the shape to the shapeless; words are not carelessly made, theories are not falsely born; brings what is proven and sees effect; measures the use of yin and yang Spirit; compares kinds and forms characters; traces the principle and takes it as proof, so that men easily know and understand. As Kan receives Wu as month essence, Li receives Ji as daylight. Yin contains yang, yang contains yin; with sun above and moon below, combined as Yi, taking firmness and softness as matching; this is to compare similar kinds following each other and forming characters. As the earth governs the four seasons, connecting metal, wood, water, fire into one qi, beginning and end, end and beginning, ever-flowing without ceasing. Green wood, red fire, white metal, black water each reside in their place, all holding the central palace’s earth to harmonize and unite. This power of union relies on Wu and Ji. Metal, wood, water, fire, earth mixed into one is called the clustered Five Phases; this principle is proof. Comparing kinds and tracing principle; emptiness may be known by the instrument.

The first day of the new moon is a return; yang qi begins to pass. Entry and exit without harm, establishing the slight firmness. The Yellow Bell is set at Zi, portent growing and manifesting. Broadcasting softness and warmth, many beings attain constancy. Watching the furnace, applying branches, opening the road and leveling light. Light shines and gradually advances, the sun lengthens day by day. The great companion of Chou, establishing rectitude in low and high. Raising up to form peace, firmness and softness both flourish. Yin and yang join, small goes and great comes. Converging at Yin, moving and following time. Gradually passing Da Zhuang, gallantly arrayed at Mao’s gate. Elm pods fall and drop, returning to the root. Punishment and virtue oppose, day and night begin to separate. Guai with yin retreats, yang rises and moves forward. Washing feathers and wings, shaking off old dust. Qian strong and bright, widely covering the four neighbours. Yang ends at Si, in the middle and mutually engaged. Gou begins sequence, treading frost first. Cold spring at bottom of well, Wu is visitor. The visitor lies in yin, yin is master. To escape the world and leave position, gather and restrain essence. Cherish virtue and await time, dwell in darkness and obscurity. Pi blocks and does not connect, sprouts do not grow. Yin at Shen, yang bends, yang name vanishes. Observe its weight and measure, examine mid-autumn’s mood. Letting be, nurturing the small and weak, old and withered returning to flourishing. Shepherd’s purse, wheat, and thorns grow, sprouting in defiance. Peeling and rotting limbs, diminishing the form. Qi of transformation exhausted, spirit lost. When the Way is exhausted it returns and reverts to Kun Yuan.

The preceding section spoke of weighing yin and yang’s coming and going, Kan and Li sinking and vanishing to establish words. This section combines with the following one, all clarifying the meaning of yin and yang’s coming and going and seeing proof and effect. How to see yin and yang’s coming and going? As at the winter solstice new moon, the sun returns from south to north; beneath the earth a yang is born, in the hexagram is Fu. Yang qi is just born; yang is master and yin is guest. The fu judgment says: “Entry and exit without harm.” Especially of yin and yang’s entry and exit, both without harm or injury. That which goes out is yang advancing; that which comes in is yin retreating. Establishing the standard slight firmness, the standard by which to test the length of the shadow. Slight firmness is yang qi just born. By establishing the standard to measure the lengthening shadow, one knows that beneath the earth yang qi is just born. Slight yang just born, the pitch pipe corresponds to Yellow Bell. The month is set at Zi, the eleventh month. The sign of yang advancing here is growing and gradually manifesting. Heaven’s yang qi broadcasts and applies and begins things; earth’s yin qi is soft and warm and brings forth things. Many beings attain constancy from the mingling of Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang qi, drawing beginning and birth, and obtaining their constancy. Compare this with the cultivator of the Way: firm qi just awakened, its qi still slight; one must nurture this little seed of life as the root of return and reversion, and not let it depart for a moment. From the winter solstice the sun gradually returns to Minor Cold, two yang born, in the hexagram is Lin. Greatly building the furnace, yang qi applies branches, opens and smooths the road, light begins to shine and the shadow lengthens. The month is set at Chou; the pitch pipe corresponds to Da Lu, the twelfth month. Compare this with the cultivator of the Way: firm qi lengthens, working under the furnace, arranging body and mind, restraining yin to open the road, supporting yang to straighten light, gradually advancing, no effort lacking. Also as the sun lengthens. From Minor Cold the sun returns to Beginning of Spring, three yang born. Upright qi fills the earth, from low to high; the qi of heaven rises from here, the qi of earth descends from here; inside yang outside yin, in the hexagram is Tai. Tai is firmness and softness both flourishing. Yin and yang join and exchange, small pauses and great comes. Yin follows yang’s vigor; its qi is warm and gentle, like spokes forming a wheel; yang and yang follow the same path, one qi in harmony. The month is set at Yin, the first month. Compare with the cultivator of the Way: firm qi advances into the centre, guest qi bows head, yin and yang harmonize and quiet; nature and disposition are peaceful; firm but not impetuous, soft but not weak. From Beginning of Spring the sun returns to Spring Equinox, moves and follows the time, from warmth to heat; four yang born, in the hexagram is Da Zhuang. The month is set at Mao, the second month. Mao is the place of wood’s vigour, the gate of life’s virtue. But Da Zhuang conceals strength, thus the elm pods fall and return to root. Virtue contains punishment; punishment and virtue oppose; yin and yang separate; day and night from here separate; days lengthen and nights shorten. Compare with the cultivator of the Way: yang firm qi is strong; one must bathe and warmly nurture it, return to root, guard against misfortune; await yin qi’s retreat and yang qi’s growth; must not force it to attract guest qi, this is called “not forgetting and not helping.” From Spring Equinox the sun gradually returns to Pure Brightness; from here yang qi lengthens and yin qi lessens; yin qi is about to end, yang qi about to be pure; five yang born, in the hexagram is Guai. The month is set at Chen, the third month. Guai is decision; yin withdraws, yang qi rises and advances. Compare with the cultivator of the Way: firm qi is vigorous, yin qi slight; from here one may wash off accumulated old stains, shake off the dust of human life, spread wings and go forward. “Spread” means to rouse the firm qi of the Way heart; “shake” means to seek the defilements of the human heart. By the Way heart one controls the human heart, no stain enters, no alien evil qi remains in the heart’s space. From Pure Brightness the sun returns to Beginning of Summer; six yang born, in the hexagram is Qian. The month is set at Si, the fourth month. Qian is strong, flourishing and bright, shining and covering the four neighbours; between the two is pure yang qi; all things are thus honoured and flourish. Compare with the cultivator of the Way: yang firm advances to purity and essence, again seeing Qian Yuan’s true appearance. Good knowledge and good ability, all of one heavenly principle, without any human desire or selfishness. Like a red sun shining in the heavens, all kinds of yin and evil vanish. This is the advancing yang fire, using the Way of Nine. Yang qi reaches Si and is extreme. When yang is extreme, yin must appear; then yin qi corresponds. From Beginning of Summer passing into Summer Solstice, returning from north to south, beneath the earth a yin is born, in the hexagram is Gou. From here yin qi follows yang qi, and sequence has the sign of treading frost. One yin born, though not the time of frost. Yet the treading of frost begins here, the first of yin qi. At this time, cold spring water at bottom of well responds to earth qi. The month is set at Wu, the fifth month, pitch pipe corresponds to Rui Bin; yin qi lies concealed beneath earth; yang qi must retreat, yin qi must advance; yin is master. Compare with the cultivator of the Way: yang firm increases to utmost; one must preserve this yang firm and refine it into something lasting and indestructible; this is supreme achievement. Preservation is the work of applying the Yin Talisman. The Yin Talisman is that when yang is extreme, yin must nourish it. To nourish yang by yin, yang qi is not arrogant; this is yin and yang conforming. The yin of the Yin Talisman is not alien guest qi yin, but the true yin of yang qi’s gathering and retreat. Here true yang retreats, there true yin is born; true yin is born and false yin disappears and transforms. If yang qi does not retreat, true yin does not appear; yang extreme must be yin. One yin secretly born; guest qi again comes; gain and lose; the great matter is lost. Therefore yang firm advances to purity, the Yin Talisman is necessarily used. Also as in the fifth month’s Gou, yin is master. But in using yin one must discern truth and falsity; true yin follows its truth; false yin follows its falsehood. Following truth nourishes yang; following falsehood harms yang. Therefore the image’s judgment of Gou says: “Do not take a woman; do not excite growth.” Also says: “Heaven and earth meet, all things are clear; one true and one false, heaven and earth separated.” Therefore Kun’s first line has the warning: “Beware of frost and hard ice.” This is the caution in use of yin. From Summer Solstice the sun returns to Minor Heat; two yang retreat and two yin born, in the hexagram is Dun. The month is set at Wei, the sixth month; yang qi from here gathers and restrains. Compare with the cultivator of the Way: to retreat from the world and leave position, gather and restrain spirit, cherish virtue and await time, dwell in obscurity and darkness, conceal brightness and nurture obscurity, great wisdom seeming like folly, great skill seeming like clumsiness, so as not to let any guest qi ride the gaps and injure. From Minor Heat gradually returning to Beginning of Autumn, three yang retreat and three yin born, in the hexagram is Pi. The month is set at Shen, the seventh month. At this time the weather falls, the earth qi rises; all things are closed and blocked; though there are sprouts, they do not grow. Compare with the cultivator of the Way: firm Way retreats into the centre; soft Way advances into the centre; firmness and softness correspond; softness nourishes firmness; its yin is acting, like yang name sinking. From Beginning of Autumn returning to Autumn Equinox, four yang retreat and four yin born, in the hexagram is Guan. The month is set at You, the eighth month, the middle autumn. Punishment contains virtue, letting accumulate the slight and weak, old and withered returning to flourish. Like all things being gathered, yet shepherd’s purse and wheat sprout forth and grow, growing in defiance. Compare with the cultivator of the Way: firmness nourishes softness; the seed of life is within; though outwardly dark, within is bright. Also as in the middle autumn punishment contains virtue. From Autumn Equinox returning to Cold Dew, five yang retreat and five yin born, in the hexagram is Bo. The month is set at Xu, the ninth month. Yang qi from here destroys its form; all things perish. Compare with the cultivator of the Way: to peel and rot the after-heaven transformations of limbs, to destroy the formed firm and dry qi nature. Qi of transformation exhausted; no awareness or knowledge; spirit lost; not spirit yet spirit. From White Dew returning to Beginning of Winter, six yang retreat and six yin pure; when the Way is exhausted it returns, in the hexagram is Kun. The month is set at Hai, the tenth month. Pure yin with no yang. Compare with the cultivator of the Way: firm qi retreats and is concealed, nurtured to emptiness and emptiness of what is empty, returning to the place of silence, scentlessness, and utmost stillness. Beyond this point, when stillness is extreme, movement returns; there is another subtle use. Attached below is a diagram of six yin and six yang for reference.

Between the dark and new moon, the talisman is in operation. Chaos and great primordial mist; female and male follow each other. Moisture and liquid nourish and moisten; transformation and flow circulate. Heaven and Earth’s spirit and brightness cannot be measured. Useful to secure the body, hiding form and concealing. Beginning in the northeast, the place of the Dipper and Winnowing Basket. Turning to the right, vomiting wheel spews sprouts. The hidden pool shows images, dispersing essence and light. Above Ang and Bi, Zhen issues as portent. Yang qi begins, initial nine is the hidden dragon. Yang with three established, yin with eight pass. Three days of trembling, eight days of joy moving. Nine two sees the dragon, peaceful and bright. Three and five virtue completes, the Qian body is formed. Nine three evening cautious, diminishing divine talisman. Prosperity and decline gradually change, finally returning to the beginning. Xun inherits the sequence, firmly and resolutely maintaining. Nine four sometimes leaps, advance and retreat the Way is perilous. Gen governs advance and stop; must not exceed the time. Twenty-three days, the customary period for the bow string. Nine five flying dragon, heavenly position adds joy. Six five Kun receives, binding beginning and end. Nourishing many children, the world’s mother type. Upper nine proud dragon, fighting virtue in the field; using nine flapping, as Way’s rules and compass. Yang numbers finished, when finished returns and rises. Weighing emotions and conforming to nature, turning and associating. Circulating the revolving pivot, rising and falling up and down. Circulating through six lines, hard to observe. Therefore having no fixed position is the ancestor of Yi.

The preceding section compared the twelve months of a year to the mutual use of yin and yang. This section again compares the thirty days of a month to the advancing and retreating of bright yang. Altogether it shows the clear and complete use of following yin and yang’s seasons. The moon and sun, twelve meetings in a year, each month one meeting. At dark and new moon the sun and moon unite, like the talisman operating on the middle Way. The middle Way is the Yellow Path, the path of the sun. The sun path and moon path intersect and move, exactly at the end of the dark and beginning of the new moon. At this time, yin and yang’s upper qi meet, confusion and great primordial mist; female and male follow each other; yang embraces yin and yin embraces yang; harmonious qi swirls and gathers; moisture nourishes and moistens; yang applies and yin transforms; one qi circulates. Yet this female and male following each other, the mechanism of transformation and circulation, is invisible and without trace, cannot be seen or known; even Heaven and Earth’s spirit and brightness cannot measure it, much less man? Compare with the cultivator of the Way: emptiness is extreme and stillness deep; useful to secure the body; hiding form and concealing; all things difficult to injure; creation and transformation hard to alter. Heaven and Earth can control the formed, but not the formless; can control qi, but not non-qi; can control mind, but not no mind. Beginning in the northeast the place of the Dipper and Winnowing Basket, moonlight arrives at northeast, fully extinguishing the pure yin image, the Yi says “northeast loses friends”; then turning right, vomiting wheel spews sprouts; yin below generates yang; hidden pool shows images; dispersing essence and light. At Bi and Mao at southwest Kun earth, Kun contains Zhen, showing the moth’s brow light; this is called “Zhen issues as slight”; yang qi creates auspicious beginning, Yi says “southwest gains friends.” At this time slight yang is born; in Qian hexagram it is the initial nine, the hidden dragon. Compare with the cultivator of the Way: when stillness is extreme it moves; emptiness room produces whiteness; a single true spirit’s light issues from darkness. This single true spirit is easily lost and hard to find; fortunately seeing it, one must quickly gather it into the pot, as the base for return and reversion. To preserve and cherish it, not to depart for a moment. The moon’s yang light establishes the base in three days; yang qi begins to pass in eight days. Passing means yin qi begins, and connects with yang qi in peace. Three established means three days of trembling; eight passes means eight days of joy. Joy has the image of Dui; yin contains half yang; its level is like a string, resembling a bowstring; this is called the upper string. In Qian hexagram it is nine two seeing the dragon. Compare with cultivator of the Way: firm yang advances to the centre, then peaceful and bright; yin qi follows; not hidden nor concealed; can avoid harm by external things. By the fifteenth of the month, three and five virtues complete; light and qi are full; three yang pure and complete; the Qian body is formed; in Qian hexagram it is nine three evening cautious. Compare with cultivator of the Way: spirit is sufficient; firm qi is strong; three and five united as one; golden elixir has form. Yet yang extreme above must diminish below; prosperity and decline change; finally returning to beginning. Evening cautious is to guard against danger and peril, to beware misfortune. By the eighteenth of the month, one yin secretly born; light and qi begin to diminish; Xun inherits the sequence; yang light gradually declines. Compare with cultivator of the Way: firm qi advances and reaches utmost; must connect with softness; firmly help and maintain; preserve the firmness. In Qian hexagram it is nine four sometimes leap. Sometimes means doubt. Doubt of whether advance or retreat in the Way is dangerous; extreme caution. By the twenty-third day, yang half yin in the middle; has the image of Gen; its level like a string, resembling a bowstring; this is called the lower string; Gen governs advance and must stop. Compare with cultivator of the Way: firm yang retreats to the centre; firmness and softness united; not biased nor inclined; this is called the centre. At this time one must bathe and not exceed the time; to retreat too much is excessive. In Qian hexagram it is nine five flying dragon. Flying dragon is firm and strong in the centre, pure essence, firm but not rash, soft but not weak; able to adapt and change; only essence and only one; true to its centre. Like the moon on the twenty-eighth day, metal and water balance; light advances but does not reach extreme; light retreats but does not go dark. At this place and position, good knowledge and good ability, the Way heart always present, human heart peaceful; all is heavenly principle; stops at utmost good. Again seeing original firmness and softness as one; “my destiny is mine, not Heaven’s; Heaven is me, I am Heaven, being a fellow worker with Heaven.” Is this not joy? By the thirtieth of the month, six five Kun receives; yang light all concealed; pure Kun image. Yang qi completes one cycle; from Kun it begins; from Kun it ends. Kun is the binder of yang qi’s beginning and end. Because it binds yang qi’s beginning and end, it nourishes many children; again yin extreme gives birth to yang; the world is the mother type; birth proceeds without end. In Qian hexagram it is upper nine proud dragon. Proud is yang’s extreme. Yang light declines to pure Kun, being warmed and nourished by Kun; its qi fills within; stillness extreme and movement; yin and yang swirl and gather; therefore there is the image of fighting virtue in the field. This proud dragon fighting in the field is somewhat different from the Zhou Yi’s nine above and six above judgments. The Zhou Yi’s proud dragon speaks of yang’s excess; fighting in the field speaks of yin’s disorder; the Triple Unity’s proud dragon speaks of yang’s reaching the pure place; fighting in the field speaks of yin and yang’s union and gathering; one must look to the words “fighting virtue.” Fighting virtue in the field shows there is yang virtue; one cannot be without yin virtue. Borrowing yin to nourish yang, yang qi extreme and returning to root; then again from yin it reissues; therefore the following text closely connects: “Using nine fluttering, for the Way’s rules and compass.” Fluttering means flying and soaring up and down. Qian hexagram says: “Using nine sees the group of dragons without heads, good fortune.” The cultivator of the Way, able to follow the moonlight’s waxing and waning rule, when advancing firmness then truly advancing firmness, when using softness then truly using softness; changes follow the time, firmness and softness according to measure; fluttering uncertain, sometimes up and sometimes down; meeting it one does not see its head, following it one does not see its tail; the traces of firmness all vanish; not firm yet firm, firm yet not firm, only seen in the void. Firm and nurtured to the void place, yang’s number is finished, returns to Kun Yuan. Yin extreme gives birth to yang; when finished it returns and rises; weighing emotions and conforming to nature, turning and associating; great medicine arises, from slight to manifest; like the revolving pivot circulating, rising and falling up and down; circulating through six yin and six yang lines. This is the most divine and subtle heavenly secret; earlier than Heaven and Heaven does not oppose; later than Heaven and following Heaven’s time. This is not something ordinary men can observe. Therefore the Yi’s yin and yang have no fixed constant position; the Qian and Kun and six yin and six yang are the Yi’s ancestor and master. The remaining sixty-two hexagrams all issue from Qian, Kun, yin and yang changing in time. To know the Way of Qian, Kun, yin and yang’s change is to have attained the Yi’s ancestor and master. Using nine and using six, not missing their time; advancing and retreating, sixty-two hexagrams are all within their use, naturally uniting a year’s days. Moving the south and north seasons and times; following one month; the moonlight’s waxing and waning qi mechanism; no need to be bound by text, nor grasp images; one may obtain image and forget words, obtain meaning and forget image. Attached below is a diagram of the moonlight’s waxing and waning for reference.

Constantly following the geography, receiving Heaven’s proclamation. Mysterious and remote, separated yet connected. Responding to measure and nurturing species, the origin of yin and yang. Vast and vague, no one knows its beginning. At first lost and astray, later becoming lord and master. No level without slope; the Way is natural. Change and transformation grow, coming and going depend on each other. Ending in Kun and returning to beginning, like following linked rings. Emperors and kings govern, lasting a thousand years.

These two sections, by one year and one month, indicate the mutually utilising principle of yin and yang, clear and complete indeed. The Way of cultivation of truth is the Way of one yin and one yang; yang governs firmness and strength; yin governs softness and compliance. To advance yang is to advance firmness and strength; to move yin is to move softness and compliance. To advance firmness and strength must reach the centre; then is it firm; to move softness and compliance must move the centre; then is it compliant. Firmness reaching the centre is firm but not rash; softness reaching the centre is soft but not weak. Firm contains softness; softness contains firm; then the original nature is full and bright, not biased nor inclined, this is called the centre; the golden elixir is formed. But the Way of the golden elixir takes Heaven and Earth as furnace and cauldron; firmness must be as Heaven, no thing can harm it, firmness is attained; softness must be as Earth, no thing can cut it, compliance is attained. Constantly following the geography is to model Earth’s softness and compliance; no thing is not cut, no thing is not born. Receiving Heaven’s proclamation is to imitate Heaven’s firmness and strength; no thing is not begun, no thing can bend. Able to model Earth, then softness and compliance match Earth; able to imitate Heaven, then firmness and strength match Heaven. If indeed able to be firm and strong as Heaven, soft and compliant as Earth, then it is easy to know and simple to do. This is good knowledge and good ability, all of heavenly principle, utmost good and no evil. Observe Heaven above and Earth below; their qi is most mysterious and subtle; their form most distant and remote; seeming to be separated and blocked, yet their qi secretly communicates and connects. Connecting is to respond to their measure, nurture their kinds; all things all follow the time and issue. The place of issuing is the origin of yin and yang. This origin, though mysterious, remote and subtle, vast and hard to approach, vague and hard to fathom, no one knows its trace. Yet observing the living things and growing things of the earth, knowing no trace, one may somewhat know its trace. The Yi’s Kun hexagram judgment says: “At first lost, later obtains master.” The Commentary says: “At first lost and astray, later following obtains constancy.” Earth being most yin and without yang, receives Heaven’s yang as yang. When Heaven’s yang qi comes, earth is yang; when Heaven’s yang qi goes, earth is yin. When Heaven’s qi falls, earth qi rises; yin qi acts; yang qi retreats; all things close and block and do not pass; earth has no yang; as if lost and astray, no ruler. When Heaven’s qi rises, earth qi falls; yang qi acts; yin qi follows destiny; all things break their shells and pass smoothly; earth has yang; as if following and obtaining constancy; there is a ruler. At first lost and astray, yang extreme and yin; yin acts; later there is a ruler. Yin extreme and yang; yang acts. Yang acts, all things pass smoothly, like earth being level; yin acts, all things blocked, like earth being a slope. The Way of Heaven and Earth is great going and small coming; small going and great coming; there is no yang without yin; level and not slope. Their yin and yang’s level and slope are all the Way’s nature. Although Heaven and Earth also have no mind, therefore the Way of change and transformation, yin and yang waxing and waning, yang extreme then yin, yin extreme then yang, coming and going depend on each other, ending in Kun and returning to beginning, like following linked rings. All this is to show the principle of Heaven and Earth’s yang strength and yin compliance, yin and yang one qi circulating. If emperors and kings receive Heaven and govern, model Heaven and imitate Earth, use firmness and softness together, unite with Heaven and Earth’s virtue, unite with sun and moon’s brightness, unite with four seasons’ sequence, unite with ghosts and spirits’ good and evil fortune, earlier than Heaven and without Heaven’s opposition; later than Heaven and following Heaven’s time; by it governing the world the world is governed; by it cultivating the Way the Way is completed. Within one may complete oneself; without one may complete others. Though a thousand years lasting always, enjoying boundless life, compared with ordinary men, all the more easy. Formerly Fu Xi and Shennong cultivated this Way and enjoyed life for over ten thousand years; Huang Bu cultivated this Way and rode a dragon to ascend Heaven; this is proof and verification.

The chief of regulation of government is to renew and reform the old. To manage and encompass the subtle and close, to open, extend and spread out treasures. The essential Way’s chief and handle, uniting creation’s order and bond. Lines and images move within; good and evil fortune arise outside; the five latitudes cross and follow, responding to time and moving. Four and seven discordant and contrary, the sun and moon bow and raise. Wen Chang governs collection and recording, reproving and assisting the ruler. Officials of the hundred offices each manage their departments. Seeking the beginning and essential end, the thread of life and death; sometimes the ruler is proud and lax, arrogant and full, violating the Way; sometimes ministers are wicked and flattery, acting not in accord with the track; the bow string expands and contracts, discordant changes bring misfortune. To enforce the law and sting with reproach, to question faults and warn the ruler; the star at the extreme hour receives correctness; idle and at leisure and trusting subordinates. The bright hall spreads governance; the state harms not the Way.

Bright Hall: A Model Bright Ruler

The above borrows the principle of the Yi, sometimes speaking of the Way of Heaven, sometimes of the Kingly Way, sometimes of the Sacred Way, divided and discussed. This section concludes with government, to elucidate the work of return and reversion. Return and reversion is the return from the later heaven to the earlier heaven, the function of doing, hence it is called the chief of regulation of government. To renew and reform the old is the way of return and reversion; wanting to take the new, none comes before reforming the old. The old is the stain of former defilements. Reforming and removing the old stain, the human heart is quiet. The tripod is the vessel for refining medicinal elixir; thus to take the new of things, the vessel’s contents are refined anew, then the Way heart arises. To manage and encompass the subtle and close is to be cautious of the unseen, fearful of the unheard, applying effort at the most hidden and subtle place, causing the human heart to be soft and compliant. To open, extend and spread out treasures is to transform and adjust in change, to push forward and preserve in penetration; in each movement one employs the divine mechanism, thus issuing the Way heart’s firmness. If the human heart be soft and compliant, the Way heart firm and strong, then reforming the old and renewing anew, renewing anew and reforming the old, naturally having Heaven’s heart, utmost good and no evil. Yet the essential Way of renewing and reforming the old rests in the Way heart alone. The chief and handle is the seventh star of the Northern Dipper, also called the guide star, the breaking army star, or the heavenly anchor star. The heavenly anchor governs the power of creation, acting as the North Pole’s law-enforcing official. Thus moving the revolving stars of the heavens; as the chief of the many stars, the order and discipline of creation’s essential Way. If the heavenly anchor moves rightly, then the five latitudes and multitude of stars each guard their place; the twenty-eight lodges all move timely, not missing the season, and are auspicious; if moved somewhat incorrectly, then the five latitudes and multitude of stars do not follow their normal; the twenty-eight lodges are all discordant, contrary, bowing and raising, losing their sequence; and are inauspicious. All this arises from human affairs’ plotting, good or bad, affecting it. The Wen Chang star group has six stars: first is the general; second is the next general; third is the noble minister; fourth is the director of wealth; fifth is the director of life; sixth is the director of punishment; these are Heaven’s six departments. They govern the records of Heaven’s Way, compile good and misfortune, reproving human officials and ministers, each governing their department’s good and evil. Good receives an auspicious sign; evil receives an ominous sign. Tracing the beginning of these signs of good and evil fortune, seeking the beginning and end of human calamity and blessing, one may know the thread of life and death. Therefore sometimes the ruler is proud and lax, arrogant and full, violating the Way of governance; sometimes ministers are wicked and flattering, acting not in accord with the track, losing governance affairs, must bring about the celestial signs of new and full moon, expanding and contracting, discordant changes and abnormality, displaying misfortune. This responsibility lies with the law-enforcing ministers, if not strict, provoking reproach, thus bringing fault to the ruler, harm is greatest. Heavenly anchor moves with time; then the extreme hour guards correctness, occupying its place, moving at leisure and trusting subordinates; crossing palaces and exceeding bounds, moving the four seasons; all things come to be. If the law enforcers are cautious and obey the track, then the ruler humbles himself and faces south, sitting in the bright hall and spreading governance, the imperial Way is far-reaching and flourishing. The cultivator of the Way, the true feeling of Way heart has firmness, like the heavenly anchor above, like the state’s law enforcer. The true knowledge of the Way heart governs awareness and illumination, like Wen Chang above governing records. The ruling mastery of the Way heart is like the extreme hour above, like the earthly ruler governing in the bright hall. True feeling without obscurity, the five origins and five virtues mutually generate, all of one qi; like the heavenly anchor pointing without error, the five latitudes crossing and following, responding to time and moving. If passion arises, the five elements and five thieves mutually overcome, each with its nature; like the heavenly anchor pointing with error, the twenty-eight lodges are discordant, contrary, bowing and raising. True knowledge and illumination sign and examine the six roots’ gateways, the seven emotions and six desires, the five elements and five thieves’ wild movement; like Wen Chang governing records of each department’s good and evil. The heart sovereign governs and rules with centre and correctness, like the extreme hour guarding correctness, the earthly ruler in the bright hall governing. The cultivator of the Way, if able to rouse the Way heart and control the human heart, then true feeling is without obscurity, true knowledge always present, yin qi gradually transformed, yang qi gradually pure, renewing and reforming the old; nature settled and destiny condensed; action within non-action; all bodies orderly; all worries ceased; what more is there to be proud and arrogant, to violate the Way, wicked and disordered; the harm of misfortune? Alas! The Way of cultivation of truth is also a Way of regulation of government. If one understands the auspices and inauspiciousness of regulation of government, then the auspices and inauspiciousness of cultivation of truth may be known. The Immortal Elder’s first part begins by comparing regulation of government to cultivation of truth; how wonderful! How subtle!
