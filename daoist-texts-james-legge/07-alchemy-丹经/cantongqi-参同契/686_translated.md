# The Scripture of the Kinship of the Three (The Texts Directly Pointing: Lower Section Accompanied by the Fasting Method)

In former times the sages and worthies, embracing the mysterious and cherishing the true, subdued and refined the Nine Cauldrons, transformed their traces and concealed themselves in obscurity, containing the essence and nourishing the spirit, communicating virtue with the Three Luminaries, the fluids and pores, sinews and bones made firm, all evil expelled, the right qi ever enduring, accumulating long and lasting, changing form and becoming immortals. They felt compassion for later generations, fond of the order of the way, following the fashions of the time, pointing out and drawing the ancient writings, setting down as charts and books, opening the eyes of succeeding descendants, revealing the branches and twigs, hiding the root and source, entrusting names of various kinds, covering the multitude of erroneous texts. The learners who obtain these treasure them in their boxes for a lifetime. Sons succeed their fathers in their work, grandsons follow their ancestors, transmitting through the world confusion and error, but never attaining sight or hearing; so that eunuchs cease to serve, farmers lose their hoeing, merchants abandon their goods, and men of aspiration become poor. I am deeply grieved at this, and have fixed and recorded this writing, words brief and easy to think on, matters concise and not complicated; laying out their items, verifying and observing, divided into two and numbered, following one another in order. Therefore it is called a disorderly speech; but it opens the portal of understanding, that the wise may carefully consider and use their mind to examine it.

Use the Mind to Examine: A fundamental method of observing with the mind.

The way of nature and life, he that obtains its truth, diligently practises it, and the effect is immediate. From ancient times those who have accomplished the Way have not been wanting from generation to generation. The immortals transmit, saying: “Those who remove their dwelling number eight hundred, those who ascend number three thousand; sitting they shed their body, standing they vanish; those somewhat accomplished are beyond reckoning.” Those who remove their dwelling are like the Yellow Emperor, like the Xu clan’s Yang, like Master Zhang the Celestial. Those who ascend are like the Old Man of True Yang, like Immortal Ge, like Duke He of the River, like Old Man Pure Yang. The above sages all refined the Seven Returns and Nine Revolutions, the Golden Fluids and the Great Elixir, and thereby became so. If one abandons this Way and hopes to become true, there is no reason in it. The Way of the Golden Elixir is the Way of embracing the mysterious and cherishing the true, the Way of subduing and refining the Nine Cauldrons. The mysterious is the spirit wondrous and unfathomable, transformations without end, called qi. The true is the utmost goodness without evil, perfectly original and benevolent, called principle. Qi belongs to life, principle belongs to nature. To embrace the mysterious is to establish life. To cherish the true is to exhaust nature. To subdue is to subdue the qi, that is, to nourish the vast and upright qi; life is self-created. To refine is to refine the true, to complete the innate natural true, nature not to be obscured. Nine is the number of pure yang without yin. From ancient times sages all embraced the mysterious and cherished the true, subdued and refined it, returning to pure yang without yin, becoming the adamantine and indestructible substance, called subduing and refining the Nine Cauldrons. It is not the later notion of Nine Cauldrons of furnace fire and alchemical food, nor the evil doctrine of Nine Cauldrons of the Lady’s Chamber pill. If it were the furnace fire of the Lady’s Chamber, why speak of embracing the mysterious and cherishing the true? Formerly the Yellow Emperor refined the Nine Cauldrons at Tai Lake, riding dragons ascending to the heavenly court. Tai Lake is the Kan dragon, the Gan yang; it takes the yang of Kan to fill the yin of Li, returning to the Gan body, returning to pure yang — how then could it be the Nine Cauldrons of the visible Nine Cauldrons? It is only this Way of subduing and refining the Nine Cauldrons, great wisdom seeming stupid, great skill seeming clumsy, concealed in remoteness, veiling brilliance and nourishing obscurity, containing and hiding the spirit. Silently exercising divine power, it steals the authority of creation, it steals the qi of yin and yang. The Book of Changes says: “In virtue uniting with Heaven and Earth; in brightness uniting with Moon and Sun; in order uniting with the four seasons; in fortune and misfortune uniting with ghosts and spirits.” Only he who can unite thus, can communicate with the virtue of the Three Luminaries, the gate of Heaven in his hand, the axis of Earth in his mind; by this he preserves the essence so that the essence is pure, and the fluids and pores; by this he nourishes the qi so that the qi is full and sinews and bones become firm. To expel all evil is to retreat yin. To keep right qi ever existing is to advance yang. Advancing yang and retreating yin, adding effort to subdue and refine, long continued yin exhausted and yang pure, essence transformed into qi, qi transformed into spirit, spirit transformed into emptiness, outside the body there is a body, winged and transformed, ascending to immortality. After perfecting oneself one yet perfects things, taking pity upon later generations, loving the order of the Way, hastening into side paths, not knowing the true Way; thereupon pointing out and drawing the ancient texts, creating charts and books, opening the deaf and blind of ten thousand ages, making the steps of a hundred generations; yet the meaning is deep and profound, carefully revealing the branches and twigs, but as for the root and source, fearing to disclose the secrets of Heaven, dared not openly utter, hence it is hidden. To hide is not to say nothing, but to hide beyond words, to lodge it in the meaning. Later men do not know the wondrous purport of the ancients, entrusting to true names, composing reckless annotations, erring on the ancient texts and misleading later learners. Such as the “Heavenly True Emperor of the Seal of Yin,” the “Records of the Jade Pure Golden Chest by the Controller of Bandits,” all are later men invoking the names of the ancients, recklessly continuing and composing. Later scholars, not discerning truth and falsehood, when encountering such erroneous texts, treasure them in boxes for a lifetime as if they had found the supreme treasure. Fathers transmit to sons, sons to grandsons, passing on confusion by confusion, leading the blind by the blind, so that eunuchs cease to serve, farmers lose their hoeing, merchants and men of aspiration all abandon their work, not one succeeding. The Immortal Elder, compassionate, composed the Kinship of the Three, words brief and easy to enter upon thought, matters concise and not tedious, laying out their items and verifying their truth. Among them the timing and numbers, the quantities of drugs, are all detailed and complete; it may be said to pierce the root of Heaven and bore into the cave of principle, truly serving as the eyes and orifices of nature and life for ten thousand men in the world. Those with aspiration who see it ought to carefully consider and closely examine it; after long time they will see the beginnings and clues. But alas, later generations sometimes call it a book of the Na Jia system, sometimes guess it to be about furnace fire, sometimes take it as proof of the Lady’s Chamber. This made Confucius weep for the unicorn, made Bian He weep for the jade; even the Immortal Elder could do nothing.

The Maiden of the River, spiritual and most wondrous, when obtaining fire she flies, unseen by dust, with ghosts hidden and dragons concealed, none know where she abides. To restrain her, the Yellow Sprout is the root. Things have no yin and yang, contrary to Heaven and against the origin; a hen hatching herself, her brood incomplete. Why is this? Because the union is not complete, the three and five do not mingle, firmness and softness separate. The essence of transformation is Heaven and Earth’s natural course; fire moves and blazes upward, water flows and moistens downward; not by any teacher’s guidance is this so; it is by the original source that it is so. The means to make the order correct cannot be altered. Observe male and female, at the time of copulation, firmness and softness are joined and cannot be undone; obtaining the token of the season, without skill or craft to control it. The male is born and lies down, the female reclines her body, holding the embryo, receiving the original qi; not merely born and seen at the time, but also at death it is so; this is not by father or mother, but by teaching and command. It is originally determined at copulation, placed and fixed beforehand.

Firmness and softness joined: One text says “mutually entangled.”

The previous section spoke of how the ancients all embraced the mysterious and cherished the true and thereby attained the Way. Embracing the mysterious and cherishing the true is the harmony of firmness and softness, the way of mingling yin and yang. The Maiden is the yin of Li, in man the spirit of the human heart’s knowing. The human heart has the discerning spirit; the discerning spirit flows and its nature is unstable, borrowing spirit to produce delusion, like the lewd maiden of the River, hence the image of the Maiden of the River. Because this Maiden’s nature is wandering, seeing scenes and producing feelings, she is spiritual. Only because she is spiritual and chases the wind and raises the waves, she is called the knowing spirit. This spirit delights in movement and not in stillness; when the heart fire slightly rises, it soars and flies, like ghosts hidden and dragons concealed, without shadow or trace, none know where it abides. To restrain her, the Yellow Sprout is the root. The Yellow Sprout is the yang in Kan; in man it is the true knowing of the Way-heart. True knowing has true feeling, true feeling contains true intention within; it is a single point of life, another name being Yellow Sprout. True intention belongs to earth; when the true earth appears, yang qi and life return, like the Yellow Sprout in the earth, growing gradually from the root. The flow nature of the spiritual knowing belongs to yin; the true intention of the true knowing belongs to yang; by true intention controlling the flow nature, steadying with a staff, the discerning spirit cannot arise, the human heart cannot issue forth, and the spiritual knowing returns to true knowing. Not only does the spiritual knowing not fly, but it nurtures true knowing. True knowing and spiritual knowing, these two united as one, yin and yang responding, life never ceasing. The Book of Changes says: “One yin and one yang is called the Way.” Were things without yin and yang, contrary to Heaven and against origin, a hen hatching herself, her brood incomplete. Especially because the union is not connected, the five elements do not mingle, firmness and softness separate, not the one yin and one yang of Heaven and Earth, the natural way of transformation; all cannot reproduce. Yang acts and yin transforms, their essence flows, this is the natural way, only thus can all things be born. Just as fire’s nature blazes upward, water flows downwards, not by any master’s guidance, but by the original source; male and female copulation, firmness and softness joined, not by skill or craft but by the same kind. Also like the male born and lying down, the female reclining her body, not only manifest at birth but also at death likewise. Not by father or mother’s command, but originally fixed at copulation and placement beforehand. All these are the mutual response of yin and yang qi, arising without cause, arriving without being sent. If the cultivator abandons the Way of yin and yang, then lone yin will not be born, single yang will not grow, contrary to Heaven and against origin, life and breath will have ceased, how can life be preserved? How can the corners be complete? Therefore true knowing and spiritual knowing, yin and yang united, then affairs can be accomplished.

The Sun flows pearls, ever desiring to leave men. Finally obtaining golden splendour, turning and mutually causing, transforming into white fluid, condensing and becoming solid. Golden splendour sings first, in a moment of tilt, dissolving into water; horsetail and coral, yang then harmonises, nature of feelings and character. Pressing and urgent is yin, constraining and confining the gate; the kind mother nourishes, the filial son repays kindness, the stern father enforces orders, instructing sons and grandsons. The five elements mutually err and dominate, mutually depending to give life; fire nature dissolves metal, metal overcomes wood’s flourishing. Three and five and one, Heaven and Earth’s utmost essence, may be expressed in a formula, but is difficult to transmit by writing. You should turn right at Zi, then Wu turns east; Mao and You form the boundary, with master and guest two names. The dragon calls to the tiger, the tiger sucks the dragon’s essence; mutually eating and drinking, both greedy and desirous, biting and swallowing, chewing and devouring. Mars guards the west, Venus crosses the sky; where killing energy approaches, what is not overturned? Civet dogs guard the rats, birds fear hawks, each has its function, how dare they make a sound? Not obtaining its principle, hard to speak rashly. Exhausting family wealth, wife and children hungry and poor; from ancient times to the present, those who love (this art) number a hundred million, records end not in harmony, few can succeed. Widely seeking famous drugs, contrary to the Way.

Err and dominate: One text says “err and rise.”

The previous section said the Maiden obtains the Yellow Sprout and can thus subdue. This section explains the timing of subduing fire. The spiritual knowing’s flowing nature in man enters and departs without fixed time, none know its home, confusing the mind’s thoughts, consuming the spirit, harming life and destiny. Like the Sun flowing pearls, never ceasing. Yet though never ceasing, if it obtains the golden splendour of the Way-heart’s true knowing to match it, then spiritual knowing is controlled by true knowing, turning and mutually causing, spirit returning to true, seeking feelings by nature, feelings returning to nature, transforming into white fluid, a qi mixed, condensing and becoming solid. True knowing and spiritual knowing thus condensed, yin and yang united, harmonious qi steaming, the golden splendour of true knowing, in a moment, firmness changes to softness, dissolves to the true one water. Something vague and dim, obscure and refined, like horsetail and coral. Horsetail is firm and white, coral is soft and gentle. The golden splendour transforming to water is the above-mentioned white fluid; horsetail and coral is the above-mentioned condensed firmness. The golden splendour of true knowing having changed to the true one water, white and tender and firm. The spiritual knowing’s sun-flowing pearls become the void-spirit fire, harmonising. The golden splendour sings first, true feeling not obscure; yang then harmonises, true nature not bewildered. Feeling not obscure, nature not bewildered, fire does not blaze upward, water does not flow downward, water and fire mutually assisting, nature and feeling peaceful, returning to unknowing and unknowing, obeying the rules of the Emperor and the domain of nature. Nature and feeling natural, thus condensed and firm, yet still there is the afterborn yin qi of the body untransformed, sufficient to be a burden to the Way. This afterborn yin qi must be fully transformed before the great Way is accomplished. Urgent and pressing is the time of yin, restraining evil qi, time and again cautious. Restraining and confining the gate protects right qi, never departing for a moment. The gate of restriction is the gate of the original yin, the gate of birth and death, the abode of life and death, the orifice of yin and yang; here I am born, here I die; here I conceive the fetus, here I cast off the fetus. To guard and examine and preserve it, if lost death follows; it is the most urgent and essential gateway, hence is called the gate of restriction. This gate all men enter and depart, all come and go, but the common people use it daily and do not know it. Should one ask the image of this gate, I then say: under Heaven, above Earth, west of the Sun, east of the Moon; at the crossroads, in the four meeting places, a bright and shining orifice opens; from afar it looks as fine as a hair, near it seems as great as the world. Within it myriad phenomena appear, a hundred treasures are complete, Heaven made, Earth arranged, the household goods, I know not if any man recognises it? If a man recognises it, then pressing and urgent evil yin returns to its root at death, restraining and confining right yang returns to its origin at birth; he may use it at will, left and right, all is suitable. But the way of returning origin and returning root is all adjusting nature and feeling, mixing yin and yang principles. If you would adjust nature and feeling, you must first discern the way of the five elements’ generation and overcoming. Metal generates water, metal is water’s mother, water is metal’s son; wood generates fire, wood is fire’s father, fire is wood’s son. Metal originally generates water, and in water again generates metal, this is called kind mother nourishing, filial son repaying kindness. Wood originally generates fire, fire generates and completes wood, this is called stern father issuing orders, instructing sons and grandsons. Metal generates water, wood generates fire, this is following generation; water generates metal, fire generates wood, this is contrary generation. There are also the five elements erring and dominating, mutually depending on the way of generation, as fire’s nature can dissolve metal, metal being overcome by fire becomes its colour, able to live and flourish; metal’s nature can cut wood, wood being overcome by metal becomes a tool, able to live and prosper, and so forth. Three and five are metal generating water at one five; wood generating fire at one five; earth dwelling in the centre is one five itself. One is one qi. The five elements mutually generate and overcome, overcoming to complete generation, generation to complete overcoming; generation and overcoming follow the times, qi flows, beginning and end, end and beginning, spirit transforms unfathomably. In Heaven and Earth it is utmost essence; in the Way of the Elixir it is utmost treasure. The secret of following and contrary generation and overcoming can be expressed in formula, but is hard to transmit by writing. The difficulty in transmission by writing is because the secret of following and contrary generation and overcoming has timing, work, sequence, quickness and slowness; a hair’s difference and a thousand li are lost. Has writing not transmitted timing? Has it not transmitted work? Only that to speak is inadequate, to discuss is not exhaustive. The Immortal Elder’s kindly heart, since saying it is hard to transmit by writing, yet could not but transmit by writing, specially desires to transmit by writing, so that later learners may exhaust the text and reach the principle, seek teachers to verify it. What does transmitting by writing mean? It means transmitting timing and work. Zi is the leader of the six yang; it is the time of one yang returning; meeting Zi turning from left to right, until Si, six yang complete. This is the advancing yang fire, following the way of firmness. Wu is the leader of six yin; it is the time of one yin coming to meet; meeting Wu turning from west to east, until Hai, six yin pure. This is the operation of the yin talisman, following the way of softness. Mao and You are the gates of yin and yang going in and out. Mao is wood, in the east, the master, controlling life qi; You is metal, in the west, the guest, controlling killing qi. Wood is soft in nature, symbolised by the dragon. Metal is firm in nature, symbolised by the tiger. There is killing and life, master and guest; life and killing both used; master and guest equal; nature and feeling one qi; like the dragon calling to the tiger, the tiger sucking the dragon’s essence; mutually eating and drinking, both greedy and desirous; biting, swallowing, chewing, devouring; naturally forming the elixir. Like Mars as the fire star, fitting in the south; if it guards the west, it is fire leaving to overcome metal. Venus as the metal star, fitting to travel at night, if crossing the sky in the day, yin invades its yang. Both these reverse their normal place, where killing qi approaches, surely there is disaster of overturn and ruin. Also like civet dogs guarding mice, must catch mice; hawks seizing birds and sparrows, must obtain success. These matters considered show that if yin and yang are out of time, ruin ensues; if yin and yang are proper, success is sure. The above are all what the writing transmits. The cultivator only pursues the image he takes, does not obtain the principle hidden, recklessly guesses and privately opines, mistakenly thinks of five metals and eight stones, flowing into furnace fire, melting lead and refining mercury, exhausting family wealth, wife and children hungry and cold. From ancient times to now, countless scholars, proud of their cleverness, seek not a clear teacher or formula, widely seek famous drugs, take the false as true, the more they seek the farther away, contrary to the Way, never succeeding in one. Can one not lament!

Cinnabar and wood essence, after obtaining metal then together, where metal and water unite, wood and fire are companions. These four are chaos, arranged as dragon and tiger; dragon yang number odd, tiger yin number even. Liver green is father, lungs white is mother, kidneys black are son, heart red is daughter, spleen yellow is ancestor; Zi and Wu begin their course. The three parts as one family, all return to Wu and Ji.

The preceding two sections spoke of the Maiden and Yellow Sprout, the flowing pearls and golden splendour; all are the bright regulation and harmonising of yin and yang power. The work of harmonising yin and yang is precisely the work of gathering the five elements. Therefore this section speaks of gathering the five elements, explaining the wondrous use of harmonising yin and yang. Cinnabar symbolizes fire, in man the spirit of spiritual knowing, which is another name for the Maiden flowing pearls. Wood nature is soft, in man the softness of spiritual knowing; metal nature is firm, in man the firmness of true knowing, which is the one thing of the prior Yellow Sprout and Golden Splendour. The nature of spiritual knowing, arising from soft spirit, is therefore wood essence. Because its nature is soft and lacking decisiveness, the mind’s discerning spirit borrows spirit to produce delusion, not without falsehood amid truth. Yet gaining the true knowing and adamantine control, the discerning spirit cannot act, the human heart is tranquil, spirit returns to its nature, and wood grows again in the fire. The native love of metal’s following righteousness, metal’s feeling loves wood’s benevolence, and metal and wood unite. Spiritual knowing is the innate spirit qi; true knowing is the innate right qi. This spirit and this truth were originally united, spirit and true, true and most spirit, the wondrous operation of the void, called the one point of true spirit. Due to the encounter with afterborn, the discerning spirit acts, spirit is confused, true spirit enters false, and they separate; then qi and nature arise and deluded feelings arise, the whole body is pure yin. The discerning spirit is the seed of transmigration through kalpas, the root of birth and death. If this one thing is not extinguished, nature and life are not truly mine. The method of extinction is none other than true feeling of true knowing. True knowing’s feeling possesses the innate true one qi. This qi is utmost great and adamantine, able to repel demons and cut the three corpses. When true feeling appears, the discerning spirit gradually fades; when discerning spirit fades, the human heart does not arise; when the human heart does not arise, spiritual knowing does not fly; when spiritual knowing does not fly, true nature manifests. When true nature manifests and meets true feeling, united as one, this is called metal and wood uniting. When metal and wood unite, metal contains true water, in man true essence. True essence and true feeling united as one family, this is called metal and water uniting. Wood contains fire, in man original spirit. Original spirit and true nature united as one family, this is called wood and fire companions. Outside metal and wood unite, inside water and fire mutually assist, these four mixed and united as one qi, still the principle of one yin and one yang united; therefore called arranged as dragon and tiger. Dragon is wood, belonging to yang, generating the number three, which is odd; tiger is metal, belonging to yin, generating the number four, which is even. Dragon and tiger are the law images of nature and feeling. Though nature and feeling and spirit are divided into four images, in reality one feeling and one nature unites them. Though one feeling and one nature unite, when nature and feeling combine it is always innate one qi that unites them. One qi is complete, including the four images; four images mixed remain one qi. The Way of the Golden Elixir is returning from afterborn to innate, gathering the five elements, harmonising the four images; all is the harmonising of yin and yang. Yin and yang harmonised is dragon and tiger meeting; hence when the elixir is completed it is called the great elixir of dragon and tiger. Like the illusory body, it also borrows yin and yang and five elements to complete. Liver green is wood, is father; lungs white is metal, is mother; kidneys black are water, are son; heart red is fire, is daughter; spleen yellow is earth, is ancestor. The illusory body of afterborn cannot be formed without the five elements; the true body of innate cannot be congealed without the five elements. The difference lies in reversal of order. Following it is the birth of humans and creatures; reversing it is becoming sage and immortal. What is following? Liver wood stores the soul, floating in nature and ruling joy; heart fire stores the spirit, fiery in nature and ruling delight; kidney water stores the essence, flowing in nature and ruling sorrow; lung metal stores the po, sinking in nature and ruling anger; spleen earth stores the intention, lingering in nature and ruling desire; these belong to afterborn. What is reversing? Wood’s floating nature is made to sink, wood returns to root, joy transforms to benevolence; metal’s sinking nature is made to float, metal returns to origin, anger transforms to righteousness; water’s downward nature is made upward, water returns to source, sorrow transforms to wisdom; fire’s upward nature is made downward, fire returns to true, delight transforms to ritual; earth’s lingering nature is made harmonious, earth returns to yang, desire transforms to faith; these belong to innate. The perfect man cultivates his innate, transforms his afterborn, reverses the operation of its mechanism, seizes the authority of creation, turns the handle of life and death. The wondrousness lies in restraining yin and supporting yang, using six without being used by six, using nine without being used by nine. Nine is number of yang; six is number of yin. One yang is born as Zi; one yin is born as Wu. Zi and Wu are the beginning of yin and yang. One yang is born and advancing yang fire, water and wood dwell therein; one yin is born and operating yin talisman, fire and metal dwell therein. Advancing yang and operating yin, each follows its time, within there is faith. Earth dwells in the centre, mixing all spirits; work belongs to Wu and Ji. Wu harmonises yang, governing external operation; Ji harmonises yin, governing internal nourishment. Wu and Ji united, inside and outside are as one. Two earths joined as a knife and wedge, this is called the one family of three substances. The Four Hundred Words on the Golden Elixir say: “Lead and mercury return to true earth, body and mind are silent and unmoving,” this is based on this. Metal and water belong to body; wood and fire belong to mind; Wu and Ji belong to intention; uniting essence, qi, and spirit, refining essence to transform qi, refining qi to transform spirit, refining spirit to return to void, at this stage body and mind are as one, water has no danger of leakage. But what is called body and mind is not the illusory body and fleshly mind, but the invisible body and mind. The invisible body is originally the one point of vast adamantine upright qi; the invisible mind is originally the one point of void and spirit, unclouded nature. The intention is not the thought of intention, but the originally unmoving and unshaking Heaven, then called true intention, called true faith by men. Later men do not know the deep meaning established by the ancients, they identify the body as the illusory body, the mind as a mass of fleshly mind, the intention as thought of intention. Those who hold to the mind enter into the study of extinction; those who recognise the illusory body consider it the work of transport. Ah! To regard this as the Way is the way of error, not the right Way. How can they know the Way, which is the study of the innate, not falling into form or formlessness, having a special secret of mind transmission and oral instruction, directly surpassing the other shore, establishing and climbing the sacred rank?

Firmness and softness alternate excitement, again passing and distributing. Dragon west, tiger east, establishing longitude at Mao and You, punishment and virtue together meet, seeing each other with joy; punishment governs restraint and killing, virtue governs life and rising. In the second month the elm falls, the chief star arrives at Mao; in the eighth month the wheat grows, the heavenly stem rules You. Zi south, Wu north, mutually as rules and order. The numbers one and nine, ending and returning to beginning. Containing origin and void and danger, sowing essence at Zi.

The previous section spoke of gathering the five elements, the power of yin and yang united as one. This section speaks of the wondrous use of yin and yang united as one. The Way of the Golden Elixir is the Way of firmness and softness united. In firmness is softness, in softness is firmness; firmness and softness mutually alternate excitement, again passing and distributing, adapting to times and transformations. What is firmness and softness alternating excitement, again passing and distributing? The dragon’s nature belongs to wood, is virtue, originally dwelling in the east Mao yang position, but now contrary establishing longitude in the west You yin position; this is firmness traversing and distributing in softness’s place, this is nature seeking feeling. The tiger’s feeling belongs to metal, is punishment, originally dwelling in the west You yin position, but now contrary establishing longitude in the east Mao yang position; this is softness traversing and distributing in firmness’s place, this is feeling returning to nature. Seeking feeling by nature, punishment contains virtue; feeling returning to nature, virtue contains punishment. Punishment contains virtue, virtue contains punishment, punishment and virtue meet together, nature and feeling see each other, firmness and softness harmonised, like husband and wife agreeing and rejoicing. Try to consider the Way of Heaven and Earth’s creation: creating is virtue, transforming is punishment. Punishment governs killing, so as to restrain and conceal all things; virtue governs life, so as to originate in all things. Birth is flourishing, killing is restraint. There is punishment and virtue, life and killing, life and killing alternate, punishment and virtue alternate, and creation flows and continues without ceasing. Yet there is life with killing inside, killing with life inside, as in the second month all things grow, the elm seedpods fall, the chief star is at Mao, the stem star points to You, this is life containing killing. In the eighth month all things are harvested, shepherd’s purse and wheat grow, the stem star at You, the chief star at Mao, this is killing containing life. The stem star’s pointing is fortunate, has life qi; the chief star’s presence is ominous, has killing qi. Elm falling in the second month, wheat growing in the eighth, these are the images of punishment and virtue meeting. The cultivator who knows to obtain this mechanism of punishment and virtue may then begin. Zi south, Wu north, mutually as rules and order; Zi belongs to water, in man original essence; Wu belongs to fire, in man original spirit. Zi in the south, water dwelling in fire’s place; Wu in the north, fire dwelling in water’s place. This is the essence one water overcoming the original spirit’s fire, punishment, killing. Yet water above and fire below, water and fire mutually assist; thus essence nourishes spirit, spirit preserves essence; punishment contains virtue, virtue contains punishment. Punishment contains virtue, virtue contains punishment; punishment and virtue yin and yang mutually as rules and order, giving birth to innate true yang. Yang is born at one, and completed at nine; yang peaks and yin joins, yang peaks and yang arises, ends and returns to beginning; yin and yang both used, punishment and virtue both completed; neither harming the other, benefiting oneself. When they meet, nature and feeling unite, nature and feeling united then the Golden Elixir forms. Yet the most crucial point is at the time of one yang returning. At this time one unites with Heaven and Earth in its virtue, with Moon and Sun in its brightness, with the four seasons in their order, with ghosts and spirits in their fortune and misfortune. For at this time there is the innate original essence and original qi therein. The void and danger two stars, occupying Zi’s place, are the meeting of yin and yang qi; this is the place where the cultivator settles and establishes life and destiny, easy to err and hard to meet. At this time one should use both punishment and virtue, punishment to prevent yin, virtue to nourish yang. If there is virtue without punishment, guest qi will take advantage and enter, the innate will be injured, great matters lost. The Immortal Elder by the phrase “sowing essence at Zi” shows men to use punishment and virtue together, the secret of beginning is greatly revealed.

If one carefully meets it, observes its beginnings and clues, compares by category and considers beginnings and ends. The five elements mutually overcome, also become father and mother. The mother contains nourishing fluids, the father governs holding and giving, condensing essence and flowing form, metal and stone do not decay. Careful, exclusive and not leaking, becoming the Way. Immediate effect, echoing voice. Is it not wondrous! The utmost image of Heaven and Earth. If one takes one inch of wild kudzu and one liang of croton, entering the throat immediately stiffens, unable to bend or raise the head. At such a time, though Zhou Wen casts stalks, Confucius divines by image, Bian Que manipulates needles, Wu Xian beats drums, how can one be saved and restored to life?

The above is the Way of refining the Golden Elixir, the internal and external drugs, the yin and yang talisman fire, all detailed and complete. But fearing the learners, without great fortune, cannot meet a true teacher. If by chance they meet, they should rejoice at meeting a true teacher, thoroughly investigate the beginnings of the great Way, carefully examine the medicines of the same kind, consider the beginning of effort and the completion of perfection, and only then can they cultivate. For a single point not known is a single point of confusion; knowledge not exact is practice not attained. The saying “a hair’s difference causes a thousand li lost.” The five elements mutually overcome: metal overcomes wood, wood overcomes earth, earth overcomes water, water overcomes fire, fire overcomes metal. Becoming father and mother: metal generates water, water generates wood, wood generates fire, fire generates earth, earth generates metal; the five elements mutually generate, each mutually father and mother. Among the five elements, water and wood belong to yang, are father; fire and metal belong to yin, are mother. Father governs firmness, mother governs softness. Mother contains nourishing fluids, softness forming things; father governs holding and giving, firmness producing things. One gives birth and one completes, metal water wood fire, essence of two five, wondrously united and condensed, varieties of things flow. The cultivator, able to understand the principle of five elements’ generation and overcoming, the principle of yin and yang and five movements, should be firm where firm is due, soft where soft is due, firmness and softness returning to neutrality, the sacred embryo condensed, the formless producing form, ten months of qi complete, revealing the Dharma body, neither born nor perishing, like metal and stone uncorrupted. If there is understanding and careful exclusive not leaking, diligent practice not lazy, surely he will attain the Way. Like immediate effect, echoing voice, its efficacy most swift. In short, Heaven and Earth cannot produce things without yin and yang; nature and life cannot congeal elixir without yin and yang; the Way of creation of Heaven and Earth is the utmost image of the Golden Elixir. Later generations deluded, do not investigate the true principle of yin and yang, enter side paths, grow old without success, rashly speak of cultivating the Way as illusion, the writings of sages as empty words; they just have not thought deeply. Consider the poison of afterborn wild kudzu and croton, entering mouth immediately causes corpse rigidity, though sages, immortals and Buddhas also hard to save and revive. How much more is the Golden Elixir the innate utmost treasure? Is there one who obtains it and cannot live long and endure? The power of the Golden Elixir to prolong life is like the power of croton to cause death; men do not think, their folly is great. Zi Yang wished to leave secrets to men, but never met a single one who was a true friend; this is precisely the reason.
