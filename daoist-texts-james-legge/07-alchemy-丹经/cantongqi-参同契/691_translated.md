# The True Exposition of the Three Aspects in the Cantong Qi

The Cantong Qi [“Kinship of the Three”] lays open its main outlines, but is not pure and simple; it is diffuse in its discourse, its subtle points are incomplete, and its defects and omissions are vague and indistinct. Now, again collected and compiled, to supply what was lost and omitted; polished and deepened, with references drawn together, the intention and meaning are made equal and consistent, and the direction pursued is not contradictory. Therefore this has been composed anew, called the Three Aspects Classified. 

In the Great Book of Changes, nature and character each conform to their measure. The methods of the Huang-Lao [school] when fully employed, are compared and found fit to be followed. The matter of the furnace-fire truly has its foundation. The three paths proceed from one, all issuing forth by their own ways. Branches, stems, flowers, and leaves, fruits and seeds hanging and spreading, are all in the root and stock, and do not lose their essence. What is spoken by the sincere mind is examined and not mistaken. 

The Three Aspects are: one aspect is the great nature and character of the Changes; one aspect is the art of the Huang-Lao; one aspect is the matter of the furnace-fire. As the three paths proceed from one, they are therefore named the Three Aspects Classified. The term “classified” also signifies the meaning of accord and agreement.
