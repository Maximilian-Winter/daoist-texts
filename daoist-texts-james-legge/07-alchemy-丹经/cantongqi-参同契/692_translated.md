# The Direct Indications of the Three Phases in the Treatise of the Harmony of the Three (Part One)

The greatest of all law-forms is that of Heaven and Earth, whose mysterious channel stretches ten thousand li. The River Drum faces the Star Marker; the people are all struck with awe. The sun's shadow erringly moves forward and backward; for nine years disaster has prevailed. The Sovereign on high has looked upon it; the kings have receded and reformed themselves. There is a crucial hinge of ebb and flow; the hurtful qi thus hastens and flees. When the rivers and streams dry up, their waters flow into the sea.

The Way of the Golden Elixir is most secret and profound, most divine and subtle; it accords silently with Heaven and Earth, and by tacit communication with Nature's creation, it is able to enter the formless from the formed, and produce form from the formless. Therefore, since ancient times the immortals and perfected ones have gazed aloft to Heaven's symbols, and looked below to Earth’s principles; they have secretly taken Yin and Yang, wrested Nature’s creation, preserved life and perfected the corners, thus fulfilling the Great Way. The immortal elders first exhibited the law-forms by means of Heaven and Earth, because the Great Way is without form, yet Heaven and Earth have form; that is, form is shown by formlessness, and emptiness is manifested by reality. The Way of Emptiness and Nothingness is clear and manifest in the form. The form is a similitude, signifying that this thing resembles that thing. The law is the rule or model. The law-form is to imitate this form. The form of Heaven and Earth is the greatest and most manifest, easy to see and easy to know. Try to observe the separation of Heaven and Earth; it spans unknown tens of thousands of li. Beneath the earth, good and evil have not arisen, yet above in Heaven the changes and appearances already hang low. When the motions of the upper Heaven’s qi are a little awry, then below on earth remorse and hesitation immediately come. How is this? Because this responds to that; forms are separated, yet qi communicates.

The mysterious channel is the empty space above the earth throughout the world. Because it is vast and boundless, mysterious and difficult to fathom, it is called the Mysterious Channel. The River Drum and Star Marker are names of stars. The River Drum’s position at the Star Marker is not according to the order of degrees; the sun’s shadow erringly moves forward and backward, losing its right path. Both are contrary to their usual course. When the usual becomes contrary, droughts and floods arise, with calamities of war, pestilence, and misfortune - none fail to come. Thus the sovereigns see the signs and retire in remorse and reformation, to turn Heaven’s heart. This is like the beginning of a man’s life, when nature and temperament are pure and united, yin and yang harmonize; by the age of sixteen (two eights) the pure yang body is nurtured, called the person of highest virtue. At this time, if one is not a Heaven-bestowed sage, how many can preserve this single point of true yang qi? All the people of the world follow Nature’s course; yang reaches its extreme and produces yin; yin once born causes the former Heaven to change into the latter Heaven. Yang gradually diminishes, yin gradually grows; indulging in desires and abandoning truth to follow falsehoods - this is called the smooth course of the five phases, the abyss of the dharma realm. It is like the stars shifting from their places, the sun and shadow erringly moving; disaster and misfortune immediately follow. If one is a Perfect Man, taking from things afar and near the self, practising the Way of the Golden Elixir with effort, returning to the root and restoring the origin — this is called the inversion of the five phases, the seven treasures of the great earth; like the king occupying the signs and governing, renewing and reforming, turning misfortune into fortune, uprooting disorder and restoring order.

A gate is iron without, a bolt is wood within. Having the gate and the bolt, thieves and harmful qi flee far away. The Way has its gate and bolt, and demons and evil spirits perish of themselves. Why? Because the gate guards against the outside, the bolt guards against the inside. Guarding outside is to keep away the foreign guest qi; guarding inside is to prevent the arising of selfish desires. When inside and outside are strictly guarded, the inner thoughts do not go out, the external evils do not come in. Yin gradually recedes, yang gradually grows; the four images harmonize, the five phases cluster. Like the multitude of waters in the rivers and streams, all converging to the sea without scattering or flowing astray. The Sage said: ‘One day you overcome yourself and return to propriety, and all under Heaven will return to benevolence.’ This is the subtle art of the correct hinge, the effect of retreat and reform.

Heaven and Earth are male and female, hovering about the Zi and Wu. Yin and Yang’s ancestors are Yinshen and Yinwu, entering and exiting, renewing and beginning anew. Circling the Dipper and shaking the light, holding the balance and fixing the original measure.

(Shaking Light — one text calls it Shaking Summons; it is not a star of the Dipper, and cannot fix the original measure; it should be Shaking Light, here interpreted as such.)

Above it is said that the law-form is taken from Heaven and Earth; this is the Way of the Golden Elixir, the Way of Heaven and Earth. The Way of Heaven and Earth is the Way of one Yin and one Yang. Heaven is the male, the Yang; Earth is the female, the Yin. Yang is born at Zi, reaches its extreme at Si; Yin is born at Wu, reaches its extreme at Hai. One day and one night, the rotation of Zi and Wu, is called the hovering of Heaven and Earth’s male and female about Zi and Wu. On the summer solstice the sun rises at Yin and sets at Xu; on the winter solstice it rises at Chen and sets at Shen. After the summer solstice the sun gradually moves south; after the winter solstice it gradually moves north; ending and beginning anew — this is called Yinshen and Yinwu, ancestors of Yin and Yang, entering and exiting and renewing again. Shaking Light is a star of the Northern Dipper, also called the Heavenly Gang Star, also called the Breaking Army Star. The place where the Heavenly Gang sits is evil; where it points is auspicious. When the month is built at Zi, it sits at Wu and points to Zi; water is vigorous and fire declines. When the month is built at Wu, it sits at Zi and points to Wu; fire is vigorous and water declines. All twelve months are thus set and pointed, one year making one full circuit. The sixth star of the Northern Dipper is the Balance Star; the Gang Star is before it, the Balance Star behind it; they govern the four seasons and carry out creation. Therefore the sun follows the Dipper and Shaking Light, holding the balance and fixing the original measure.

If the learner can know the time of the birth of Yin and Yang within his own body, the degrees of entering and going forth, how to turn the Gang Star, and revolve the handle of the Dipper, then the gates of Heaven are in the hand, the axis of Earth is by the heart; taking the herbs according to time, diligently working the alchemy, restoring the original source of former Heaven is not difficult. But this Gang Star, people do not easily know it, nor easily see it; if not for a true master pointing it out, who dares speak idly? As it is said: ‘The sun and moon always add Xu; at all times one sees Breaking Army. The star before Breaking Army, vows are made not to pass on (this knowledge).’ The Gang Star is also called Breaking Army; the star before Breaking Army is the direction it points to. The direction pointed to has the true and original one qi, which is the ancestral qi of all living things. Since ancient times the immortals and perfected ones have all taken this one qi and perfected life and nature. What is called ‘obtaining the one and all things are accomplished’ is this one qi. The alchemical scriptures and writings dare not plainly indicate what the Gang Star is, or where the one qi dwells, for fear that it fall into the hands of unrighteous persons and bring Heaven’s punishment. The Awakened Origin Master dares now as patriarch to truly transmit and inscribe the spirit, slightly revealing Heaven’s secret. If there be aspirants who see this and understand it in silence, this is what ghosts and gods show, and not the fault of Awakened Origin.

Our true Gang Star is no other thing; it is the true knowledge of the heart of the Way. True knowledge possesses the original Heaven’s utmost Yang qi. This qi governs Yin and Yang, contains the five phases, is the root of nature and life, the source of Tao and virtue; hidden it is true nature, manifested it is true feeling; nature and feeling are both of the utmost truth. Its division into nature and feeling is only to be discussed as movement and stillness. This qi originally is the property of our household; because of falling into later Heaven, it has falsely concealed its truth. True knowledge is clouded, with cleverness used outwardly and false thoughts born inwardly; with fox-friends and dog-companions the true knowledge becomes false knowledge, vital qi changes into murderous qi. The qi of former Heaven does not belong to me. As the property of our household, it has strayed to another’s house; the Gang Star sits at me, but points to another. Now to return the former Heaven, one must steal it from the other house. The method of stealing seeks life within the murderous chance, true feeling within false feeling. When true feeling is expelled, true knowledge appears; when true knowledge appears, the light is returned and reflected. The Gang Star points inward and not outward; vital qi is gathered inward and not scattered outward; it can harmonize the four images, cluster the five phases, perfect nature and life, and complete the Great Way. But fear is that people lack aspiration, cannot exert their mind to exhaust principle, nor acquire the skill to seek truth, and so cannot personally see the Gang Star. Alas! It can be spoken of to the knowing, but is hard to tell to the unknowing.

Ascending and boiling upon the Cauldron Mountain, fierce fire is set below. The White Tiger leads the chant before, the blue liquid harmonizes behind. The Vermilion Bird soars and sports, flying and displaying five colours. Encountering the net and the trap, pressed down it cannot rise. The cry is most sorrowful, like a babe longing for its mother. Upside down it enters the boiling cauldron, breaking and injuring feathers and fur.

Having known how Nature’s creation balances, one must combine the four images and five phases. The cauldron is the vessel for storing water. The Cauldron Mountain is the tripod. The fierce fire set below is the furnace. To ascend and boil upon the Cauldron Mountain is water above; the fierce fire set below is fire beneath. Water above, fire beneath; with the essence of the true one, nourishing the void and spirit; water and fire mutually assist. The White Tiger in the West is metal, representing true feeling; the Azure Dragon in the East is wood, representing true nature. The blue liquid is the essence of wood nature; metal feeling is firm, wood nature is soft; metal naturally overcomes wood, wood naturally fears metal. The White Tiger leading the chant before is metal feeling cherishing wood’s mercy and kindness, pushing feeling to unite with nature. The blue liquid harmonizing behind is wood nature loving metal’s obedience and righteousness, seeking feeling by nature. Driving the Tiger to the Dragon, and the Dragon to the Tiger, nature and feeling meet, metal and wood combine. The Vermilion Bird is the image of fire. Among the four images, fire is the most spiritual; its nature delights in flying, and if lightly offended it soars aloft, dazzling in five colours; water, fire, metal, and wood all suffer injury from it. The practitioner of elixir must first subdue and tame this one thing, then can accomplish the work. Encountering the net and the trap, pressing down when it cannot rise, is to fully refine one’s own work, chastising anger and controlling desire, preventing fire’s rash movements. The cries most sorrowful, like a babe longing for its mother, is fire not moving rashly, the drying nature digesting, fire returning to its source, spirit depending on nature. Upside down entering the boiling cauldron, breaking and injuring feathers and fur, is when one has refined the self to no-self, evil fire descending, true water rising, water and fire steaming and vaporizing, qi and substance both transformed, four images harmonized; from this one can refine the great medicine.

Before the hourglass half runs out, fish scales and manes rise. Five colours display a dazzling radiance, changes without constancy. The bubbling and boiling of the cauldron rushes violently without ceasing. Layers upon layers overlapping, like dog’s teeth interlocking. Forms resemble midwinter ice, with stalactites and stalagmites. Lofty and mingled, piled and supporting pillars. Yin and Yang obtain their matches, pale and tranquil mutually guarding. The Azure Dragon dwells at Fang Six, spring blossoms at Zhen and Mao of the East. The White Tiger at Mao Seven, autumn’s brightness at Dui and You of the West. The Vermilion Bird at Zhang Two, mid-summer at Li and Wu of the South. The three all come to court, kin and companions.

The foregoing section spoke of the powers of clustered medicines; this section clarifies the use of the elixir’s fire intervals. When the four images harmonize and the five phases cluster, the medicine enters the vessel of Gan and urgently needs the furnace of Kun to kindle a single point of true fire and refine it. In a brief moment, the five phases mix and change; the original Heaven’s qi is born from emptiness. Hence it is said: ‘Before the hourglass half runs out, fish scales and manes rise.’ The fish is a Yang creature in water, symbolizing the manifestation of original Heaven’s Yang qi. The scales and manes rising indicate original Heaven’s Yang qi being steamed by true fire, leaping and transforming. The five colours dazzling are the one qi of five phases. The changes without constancy signify hidden leaps and instability. The bubbling and boiling of the cauldron rushing violently without ceasing signify the medicine’s qi just transforming and tender. Layers upon layers overlapping, dog’s teeth interlocking, signify the medicine’s qi progressing from tender to congealed. Forms resembling midwinter ice, stalactites and stalagmites, signify the dispersion gathering and solidifying firmly. Lofty and mingled, piled and supporting pillars, signify from confusion to purity, medicine’s qi returning to Yang. Yin and Yang obtaining their matches, pale and tranquil mutually guarding, signifies Yin and Yang balanced, blended into one qi. The medicine is fire, fire is medicine; there is a natural true fire. In the furnace it burns brightly and long with a red glow, without power to regulate or blend; it must be pale and tranquil in mutual guarding, guarding against danger and worry, bathing and nourishing, to carry out the work of non-action. The Azure Dragon dwells at Fang Six, spring flowers at Zhen and Mao of the East; the Azure Dragon is the image of wood; Fang is the star of water; six is the number of water. Wood dwells in water’s place, wood obtains water’s nourishment, spring flourishes and Yang qi proceeds. The White Tiger at Mao Seven, autumn’s brightness at Dui and You of the West; White Tiger is the image of metal; Mao is the star of fire; seven is the number of fire. Metal dwells in fire’s place, metal obtains fire and becomes bright; autumn flourishes and Yin qi proceeds. The Vermilion Bird at Zhang Two, mid-summer at Li and Wu of the South; Vermilion Bird is the image of fire; Zhang is the star of fire; two is the creative number of fire. Fire dwells in the true south Wu, between metal and wood, the place where Yang reaches its extreme and Yin is born. This signifies the summer solstice, the junction of Yin and Yang, the refining and tempering of punishment and virtue. Metal, wood, and fire three come to court; the elixir vessel is formed as companions. Water produces wood, wood produces fire, fire produces metal, metal produces water; though three, they possess the qi of the four images. The four images all present in the vessel, self-cooking and self-frying, the sacred embryo without substance produces substance, without form produces form, naturally changing. This inner medicine’s natural true fire law-form differs from the former White Tiger, Blue Liquid, and Vermilion Bird. The former spoke of the outer; this speaks of the inner. The outer is the return from latter Heaven to former Heaven by human effort; the inner is the return to former Heaven by nature itself. This is the difference of inner and outer fire intervals, on which the learner must fix their gaze.

Originally there are but two things; at the end they become three and five. The three and five combined with one, all gather and return to one place. To cultivate it as above, the number of days is also taken as just begun. First white, then yellow; red and black reach exterior and interior. Called the First Cauldron, its food is like great millet grains. What Nature produces is not by deception or false doctrine. The miasma of mountains and marshes steams, rising clouds and rain; mud dries and becomes dust, fire extinguishes and changes into earth; like the sprout dyed yellow, like indigo becoming green threads; skin and leather boiled into glue, malted grain changed into wine. Like things are easily worked, unlike things are difficult to do artfully. Only this subtle art is carefully examined and not deceitful. Transmitted to countless future generations, clear and manifest can be examined. Bright as the Star Classic of Han, shining like the Water Sect of the Sea. Thought must be made thorough, repeatedly viewed above and below. A thousand cycles dazzling and brilliant, ten thousand times may be seen. Spirits and intelligences may reveal to man; the heart’s spirit suddenly comes to me. To seek the root and trace the thread, one must find its gateway. The Way of Heaven has no partiality nor preference, always transmitted to the worthy.

Combined with one (one text reads ‘combined with one’; another reads ‘or reveals to man’).

This section summarizes the whole meaning. The Way of the Golden Elixir is the Way of Yin and Yang and the Five Phases. At first, harmonizing Yin and Yang to complete the returning elixir; at last, three and five return to one to complete the sacred embryo. Hence it is said: originally but two things, at the end three and five. When three and five harmonize as one qi, the Great Way is accomplished. Yet the Way of cultivating elixir requires timely gathering of herbs, lawful cooking and refining, proper fire intervals and numbers; without skill it cannot be completed. Therefore first from black is taken white to be the mother of the elixir; next white is made into yellow, to form the sacred embryo. Red is fire, black is water. Exterior and interior are the two medicines. The Way of the Golden Elixir, although medicines differ as interior and exterior, the work of water and fire refining must not cease before the tenth month when the embryo is complete; first refining the self, then refining the medicine, finally gently nourishing; from beginning to end, interior and exterior, all depends on water and fire to complete the work. Hence the red and black reach exterior and interior, meaning that without skill there is no roundness and completeness. Called the First Cauldron, this single method alone is true; the other two are not genuine. Food like great millet grains signifies the elixir has turned nine times, called the pearl of millet grains; man who obtains and eats it lives as long as Heaven, aging not. This pearl condenses from emptiness, apart from various methods; it is the qi of natural Yin and Yang in mutual response, not the evil false arts of furnace fire and forced manipulation, which are forced and strained and bring no benefit but harm. Also as mountains and marshes communicate qi to form rain, mud and water drying to become dust, fire extinguished to become earth, sprouts dyed yellow, indigo becoming green threads, skin boiled into glue, malted grain becoming wine — all these happen by themselves. Why? Because their kinds are the same, easy to apply effort. If two have no relation, wanting to plough stone and sow rice, or fish in trees, however clever, what use is it? Man’s origin is not from common father and mother’s essence and blood, and the illusory body cannot be formed; not from spiritual father and holy mother’s Yin and Yang, and the Dharma body is hard to accomplish. The Dharma body and illusory body both rely on Yin and Yang to be perfected; it is only a matter of their opposition or concord, and distinction of sage and common man. Ordinary people only know to follow the course of Yin and Yang; very few in ten thousand know the way of reversal. The Way of Harmony is divine and subtle! Its divinity and subtlety lie in using the art of Yin and Yang to establish words. Its principle is exact, its Way great; it is the skill of stepping on solid ground, not the empty and unreal heresy. Truly it is the ladder of cultivation for all ages, the ferry of nature and life. Its teaching is clear and bright, shining like the Star Classic of Han; its principle concentrated and brilliant, like the Water Sect’s confluence. If the learner can thoroughly think and examine, seek the root and trace the thread, after long time spirits and intelligences silently reveal, the heart’s spirit suddenly awakens, surely the gateway will be found and the cave of principle entered. Heaven’s Way is impartial, always transmitted to the worthy; for the Way is highly valued by Heaven and Earth, and is not transmitted except to those of great loyalty and filial piety, nor bestowed except to those of great virtue and great practice. If indeed one is worthy, what would be withheld or refused? Alas! The gentleman who obtains it may be poor and destitute; the petty man who obtains it will lightly lose his life.
