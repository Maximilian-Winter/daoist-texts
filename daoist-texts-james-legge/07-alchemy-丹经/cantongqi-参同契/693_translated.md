# The Treatise on the Three Phases in the Secret Integration, Part Two

Circle three and five, inch one fen, mouth four and eight, two inches the lips.

This is the Song of the Tripod Vessel. Though named the Tripod Vessel, yet in the medicines and the regulation of fire, nothing is excluded from within. The circle is without deviation or bias, lively and active; this is called holding the centre with sincerity. Three is the number of the birth of wood; five is the number of the birth of earth; one is the number of the birth of water. One, three, and five are all Yang numbers, hence called circle. The mouth resembles the square; the square is transformation and regulation, the use of things as occasion demands. Four is the number of the birth of metal; eight is the number of the completion of wood; two is the number of the birth of fire. Two, four, and eight are all Yin numbers, hence called mouth. The mouth is the path of respiration inward and outward: one exhalation is Yang and extension, ruling life, symbolising the eight of wood. One inhalation is Yin and contraction, ruling receiving, symbolising the four of metal. The lips, two pieces above and below, are active. When the lips move and breath is expelled, it resembles the two that give birth to fire. One, three, and five, Yang numbers, belong to Heaven. Heaven is symbolised by the circle, the trigram Qian, the tripod. Two, four, and eight, Yin numbers, belong to Earth. Earth is shaped as the square, the trigram Kun, the furnace. The circle rules closing, the square rules opening; the circle is the body, the square the use; the standard of the five elements metal, wood, water, fire, and earth joined in one breath is the principle by which this tripod vessel is perfected.

Length one chi and two cun, thickness uniform.

One chi and two cun means twelve inches. In one year there are twelve months; in one month twelve periods; in one day twelve hours. Thickness means abundance; thinness, scarcity; uniformity, balance. By the six Yin and six Yang of year, month, day, and hour advancing and retreating, is regulated the measure of the Yang fire and Yin talisman.

The belly is level at three, sitting pendant and warm.

The belly is the belly of the tripod, the container that holds the medicines. Three are the three great medicines of essence, breath, and spirit. The belly level at three means that within the tripod the three medicines essence, breath, and spirit are all complete; this is the “tripod full” of the Book of Changes. Sitting means unmoving and unshaken; pendant means sinking and filling; warm means harmonising. Sitting, pendant, and warm means essence, breath, and spirit gathered in one place, constantly sinking and harmonising, unscattered in purpose; this is the “vacant yet active” of the Tao Te Ching.

Yin above, Yang below rushing forth.

Yin is water, symbolising the water within the vessel of Kun. Yang is fire, symbolising the fire within the vessel of Qian. Water above, fire below, water and fire cook and stew; the fire is not dry, the water not cold; water and fire assist one another. Essence nourishes spirit, and spirit strengthens essence.

Head and tail martial, middle literary. Beginning seventy, ending thirty. Two hundred and sixty, well regulated and even.

In the work of cultivating the elixir, first employ the martial fire to refine the self; last employ the martial fire to nourish and warm. For if the refining is not complete, the elixir will not form; if the nourishing is insufficient, the sacred embryo will not be established. As for the middle stage of congealing the sacred embryo, only a brief literary fire is employed; then the creative power is at hand. Hence it is said, “head and tail martial, middle literary.” Yet the martial fire of head and tail is also distinguished. The Way of the Elixir begins with refining the self and ends with nourishing. The human mind long abandoned and habits deeply rooted are great hindrances to cultivation, and most difficult to subdue. Until one refines the self to the point where all things are void, the return elixir is not permitted. Much labour is spent in this martial fire. After the elixir is formed, to guard against danger and risk, to bathe and nourish, with but little relaxation, lest the sacred embryo be formed and then lost, the martial fire is again employed. Though martial fire is used, when the ten-month embryo is complete, then rest is taken, less than the labour of refining the self. For example, in one hundred days, seventy days of martial fire are spent refining the self, thirty days martial fire nourishing; the remaining two hundred and sixty days are similarly regulated in fire and timing, not allowing the slightest error. The Immortal Elder compares the cycle of three hundred and sixty days to the whole course of the fire’s usage in the Way of the Elixir. It is not simply that three hundred and sixty days fix the number of days of fire; the learner should carefully distinguish.

Yin fire white, yellow sprout lead. Two and seven combined, assisting the perfected one.

Yin fire is the fire of mercury nature; Yang fire is the fire of lead nature. Both are numbers of fire, belonging to Yin; seven is the number of completion of fire, belonging to Yang. When the external medicines are merged with the elixir head, use a point of the void-spirit fire from their own nature to temper the lead nature; black gives birth to white, void and substance produce light; hence it is said Yin fire white. When the internal medicines are merged with the elixir head, use a point of natural true fire from true nature to stew the innate true One Qi; without substance produces substance, gradually changing white to yellow; hence it is called yellow sprout lead. White still has Yin substance; yellow is Yin exhausted and Yang pure. The Scripture of the Dragon and Tiger says, “Pure white reveals treasure, able to produce the yellow chariot,” meaning the white and yellow just mentioned. The two fires, internal and external, one giving birth and one perfecting, beginning with the Yin fire to give birth to the medicine, then the Yang fire to complete it. The two fires of Yin and Yang gather, from birth to ripening; the perfected man’s breath is full and spirit complete, awaiting the time to ascend; hence called assisting and supporting the perfected one. To assist and support is to uphold and carry on; the perfected one is the sacred embryo perfected, saying that by use of the two fires of Yin and Yang, the sacred embryo is perfected.

Nourish the brain, fix and ascend to the mysterious. The embryo dwells in the centre, finds peace and abiding. Coming and going wandering, does not leave the door. Gradually becomes great, nature and feeling pure. Returning to the One, restoring the root and origin. Good love and respect, like sovereign and minister. To the completion of one cycle, very diligent. Close watch and protection, do not be confused or faint. The road is far, and again deep and mysterious. If this is attained, one will comprehend Heaven and Earth. The knife and tablet moistened, purifying soul and spirit. Obtaining longevity, dwelling in the village of immortals.

The Way of cultivating truth is to exhaust principle and exhaust nature, to arrive at the Way of destiny. If destiny is not cultivated, how can nature be nourished? Destiny concerns the affairs of the coloured body; nature concerns the affairs of the Dharma body. Destiny incomplete, the coloured body is hard to part with; nature incomplete, the Dharma body is hard to shed. The Immortal Scriptures say: “If only destiny is cultivated and not nature, this is the first fault of cultivation. If only ancestral nature is cultivated and the elixir is not, the ten thousand kalpas of Yin spirits cannot enter the sacred. Only by cultivating both nature and destiny is what should be done.” Above it says two and seven combine, assisting the perfected one. This is that the sacred embryo is congealed, destiny foundation firm; from this point one may cultivate nature to detach the Dharma body. This section speaks of cultivating nature. To cultivate nature is the work of facing the wall and issuing spirit. The phrase “facing the wall” does not mean quiet sitting, facing a stone or earthen wall, but facing scenery and forgetting feeling, with neither being nor non-being, all things empty. Like facing a wall and seeing nothing. The sectarian method calls quiet sitting and facing the wall “facing the wall”; do they understand the principle? Try to explain the principle of cultivating nature by facing the wall. Nourishing the brain means nourishing nature. The brain is at the highest part of the body, behind the head, beyond the reach of ear and eye; this means nourishing nature. One must reach the point where voice and colour are transformed, void and non-void, to the state of utmost stillness, which is supreme achievement. For if cultivation does not reach the state of utmost stillness, not only cannot the Yang spirit come forth, the Yin spirit cannot come forth either. If indeed nature is nourished to utmost stillness, then nature and destiny are both complete, body and spirit both subtle; when the time comes, there will be liberation and ascent to the mysterious capital. This is what Buddha and the Ancestors said: “I entrust this matter to you,” meaning certain accomplishment. Yet before the time of liberation, do not be hasty; one must nourish gently. Hence it is said the embryo dwells in the centre, finds peace and abiding. The embryo is the Dharma body of the sacred embryo. When two and seven combine, assisting the perfected one, the sacred embryo is complete; like a child in the womb, stable and secure, awaiting the time. When the time comes, allow it to come and go naturally. Yet though the Dharma body can come and go and enter and exit, it must not let the bodily shell wander afar. Gradually mature and aged, nature and feeling pure and one, the original foundation firm, and then one may travel afar. Not confused nor faint, in a moment a thousand li; gathered it forms shape, dispersed it forms breath. Love and respect like sovereign and minister, carefully sustaining. Diligent unto one cycle, fearing confusion and faintness. The Way has a body outside the body, has reached the place of non-birth and non-death. Yet the Way’s road is distant, deep and more deep, without limit. If again the furnace is firmly established, the tripod set anew, the child gives birth to grandson, grandson to branch, a thousand hundred myriad transformations, beyond measure. If the learner can attain this, by the above precedents, Heaven and Earth will be no difficulty to comprehend; the knife and tablet can be obeyed; soul and spirit then purified; longevity obtained and dwelling in the village of immortals, indeed this is certainly attainable.

Those who delight in the Way seek its root. They examine the five elements, fix the ounces and fen. They consider earnestly, not needing to discuss. They hide deeply and guard, not transmitting the text. They ride the white crane, drive the dragon and qilin, roam the Great Void, visit the Immortal Lord, record the Heavenly Chart, and style themselves perfected ones.

In the world there are many blind cultivators and blind refiners, some silent and guarding emptiness, some practising the elixir in error, some with furnace fire taking food, some moving essence and breath; all do not know the root of nature and destiny. Hence cultivators are like cow’s hair, those who attain the Way like the horn of a qilin. The Immortal Elder with compassion presents the words “seek the root,” greatly awakening men. The root is the One Qi of innate emptiness; One gives birth to Heaven, Earth, and all things, and is the root of the Way. The learner who can know this One, all things are finished; the cultivator who can obtain this One, the Golden Elixir is formed. To seek the root, one must urgently seek a master’s secret, and carefully examine the birth and overcoming of the five elements, the wondrous use of their gathering, the ounces and fen of the medicines, the divisions of the fire’s timing. Having obtained the secret, consider its marvel, attain the meaning and forget the words; great wisdom seems foolish, great skill seems clumsy. Diligently practise it, three thousand tasks complete, eight hundred practices finished, mounting the crane and riding the qilin, flying up in broad daylight, styled a perfected one, what joy is like this?

The Immortal Elder supplements the omissions and escapes; the Treatise on the Three Phases, upper and lower parts. The upper part speaks of the great return elixir, the great elixir, internal and external medicines and their harmonisation of levels; the lower part discusses the tripod vessel and the use of fire, from beginning to end in order. The two parts are most concise in their words, clearest in their principles. Their methods most detailed, their affairs most orderly. Summarising the great meaning of the Secret Integration, separately establishing its words, forming a book by itself, all are what the Secret Integration did not mention; hence called supplementing omissions and escapes. It means to fill what the Secret Integration left out, to stop what the Secret Integration let slip. With the Treatise on the Three Phases, the Secret Integration can be without omission or neglect. Though the Immortal Elder did not comment on the Lao-Tong, he truly completed the Secret Integration. Such is the merit of inheriting the past and opening the future; how slight and mean is it!
