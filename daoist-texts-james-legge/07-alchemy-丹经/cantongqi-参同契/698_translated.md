# Discourse on Medicaments

The writings of the Dan Scripture and the Son of the Scripture speak of gathering medicaments and refining the Golden Elixir. All these are truly the formless and incorporeal reality of the prior Heaven; they are not the medicaments of the world with form and substance, nor are they things of the human body with form and substance. For since man has been born, he has mistaken the false for the true, and by digesting to exhaustion the treasure originally perfect and complete, his whole body becomes pure yin, his breast full of pernicious qi, as if a great disease were upon him, awaiting the moment of death. Without the possession of the real and genuine spiritual medicament to heal and treat him, how can he return yin to yang and preserve his life?

What indeed is the real spiritual medicament? It is the prior Heaven's true and one qi, the three treasures of prior Heaven â€” essence, qi, and spirit. The prior Heaven's true and one qi is also called the true seed. This qi does not alight upon forms or images; it is the utmost non-existence and yet contains the utmost existence, the utmost emptiness and yet contains the utmost reality; the true void and the wondrous existence. It comprehends and governs the three treasures of essence, qi, and spirit; these three treasures are also not things with form, but the formless truth. The Jade Toad Elder says: its essence is not the essence of interaction; it is the saliva from the mouth of the Jade Emperor; its qi is not the breath of respiration; it is indeed the smoke of the Great Primitive; its spirit is not the spirit of thought; it can be compared with the Primordial Beginning. Though divided into three families, they all return to the prior Heaven's one qi; the three united form one qi, one qi divided becomes the three families. The gatherer of medicaments gathers this one qi and three treasures, employs the true fire to calcine and refine it into an elixir, which enkindles and transforms the myriad yin qi of the body, returning it to the primordial substance of pure yang, clear, tranquil, undefiled, and without dust. As a man who is sick uses medicaments to heal and becomes a healthy man, so is this. The so-called medicament is but an image and likeness. Later generations of scholars, seeing the Dan Scripture's discourse on medicaments, err in supposing them to be things of form and substance; hence they gather herbs of the mountains and forests, compound and consume them, foolishly hoping for longevity; or they gather the five metals and eight stones, calcine and refine elixirs to take, vainly imagining ascension. They do not understand that medicaments of form can only cure diseases of form, and cannot cure diseases without form. If one desires to cure diseases without form, one must gather the prior Heaven's true and one qi; there is no other method. The Commentary on Similarities says: 'Of the same kind it is easy to apply skill; of a different kind it is hard to be clever.' The Enlightenment of Truth says: 'When bamboo is broken, one must use bamboo to mend it; to embrace a chicken one must use eggs; among myriad kinds, those not of the same kind are but vain exertion; how can they compare with the true lead which unites with the sacred mechanism?' The true lead is indeed the prior Heaven's true and one qi. Viewing all this, to recognize the common medicaments as immortal medicaments one may come to understand.
