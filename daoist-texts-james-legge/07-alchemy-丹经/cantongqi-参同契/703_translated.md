# Essential Instructions for Cultivating the Perfected

The Great Way is non-action, its foundation is in accord with Nature;  
Unless the work be accomplished, there can be no square or circle.  
At the forked crossroad seek the seed of truth;  
In the eight-trigram furnace refine the nature of Heaven.  
A boat without bottom may cross the sea;  
Medicinal materials carried with you may prolong life.  
Within punishment is hidden virtue, men are hard to fathom;  
From harm arises kindness, the heart must be devoted.  
The Four Symbols harmonize and return to the original face;  
The Five Elements cluster and form the long golden lotus.  
There is increase and decrease, this is the wondrous;  
To know good and evil is to begin to enter the mysterious.  
To cast off all entanglements, dust and things,  
Is to become complete before father and mother were born.  
To cultivate immortality and to be Buddha both arise from this;  
The remaining two — emptiness and mystery — both lead astray.
