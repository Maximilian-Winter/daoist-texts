# Awakening to the Truth, Direct Pointing, Volume Three

### A Poem of Five Characters and Four Rhymes, Symbolizing the Great Yi Containing the True Qi

A maiden clad in blue, her lord in white silk dressed.  
To see her is to find her useless, to use her is to find her unseen.  
In the vague and dim they meet, in the obscure and dark some change.  
In an instant flames fly, the perfect man appears of his own accord.

Spirit-knowledge is the Yin within Yang, possessing softness. Its nature governs life, belongs to Wood, whose colour is blue; hence the maiden is clad in blue. True-knowledge is the Yang within Yin, possessing hardness. Its passion governs killing, belongs to Metal, whose colour is white; hence the lord is robed in white silk. Yet nature and passion have their division into prior Heaven and later Heaven. The later Heaven is when Qi overcomes fanciful passion; it is the nature of temperament, having form and image, things visible but not usable. The prior Heaven is original nature and true passion; it is the nature of true emptiness, without form or image, things usable but not visible. Because it is invisible, it dwells in the vague and dim. To say vague, to say dim, is that there is Qi but no substance; to look upon it is not to see, to listen to it is not to hear, to grasp at it is impossible. How then shall it cohere and form the elixir? Yet though invisible, unheard, and ungraspable, the nature of spirit-knowledge and the passion of true-knowledge sometimes meet in the vague, and change in the dim. At the moment of this meeting and change, the spirit and brightness are silent and remote, gathered into the furnace of creation, the fire added to calcine and refine. In an instant, the Qi of prior Heaven comes from the void and condenses into form, and the perfect man appears in the dark chamber. This is the image of the returning elixir method, so called the elixir perfected within one hour. The appearance of this perfect man is the union of true Yin and true Yang within it, a single point of vital energy arising; this is the so-called sacred embryo, not the appearance of a body outside the ten months of gestation. If it were a body outside the body, could it in an instant shed the old and take the new, and appear a body outside the body? This poem of the immortal master symbolises the Great Yi containing the true Qi. If anyone ask what is meant by the appearance of the perfect man, I say it is the Great Yi containing the true Qi.

### Twelve Poems of the West River Moon, Symbolizing the Twelve Months

The Immortal Master said, "West is the direction of Metal, River is the body of Water, Moon is the use of the elixir."

#### The First

The inner medicine is the same as the outer, the inner passes through and the outer must also pass.  
The elixir's head unites in likeness, nurturing both with twofold effect.  
Within is the natural true fire, in the furnace flaming long and red.  
The outer furnace must be increased or decreased with diligence, the marvel is utmost, the true seed unerring.

The inner medicine is the spirit of spirit-knowledge; the outer medicine is the truth of true-knowledge. Because spirit-knowledge is hidden in the human heart, entering the heart and acting there, borrowing spirit to produce fancifulness, it is called the inner medicine. Because true-knowledge is complete in the Dao-heart, when the Dao-heart recedes, true-knowledge is not manifest, it is called the outer medicine. True-knowledge and spirit-knowledge are originally one family under different names; thus it is said inner medicine is also outer medicine. The inner medicine is for cultivating nature, and must be understood; the outer medicine is for cultivating destiny, and must also be understood. The ancient scriptures say, "To cultivate destiny without cultivating nature is the first sickness in practice; to cultivate nature without cultivating destiny, the dark spirits of ten thousand kalpas cannot enter the saint." Therefore it is said, the inner must connect with the outer, and the outer must connect with the inner. Nature is Yin, destiny is Yang. The great elixir of the golden liquid takes the two cords of true Yin and true Yang of the same kind, harmonizes and combines them. To cultivate destiny without cultivating nature, or nature without destiny, is solitary Yin and solitary Yang; the great elixir will not bind, hence the necessity to cultivate both nature and destiny. Yet nature and destiny have their respective effects; nature is the affair of the Dharma body above, destiny is the affair of the illusory body above. The twofold effect of warming and nourishing is greatly diverse; cultivation must have its two stages. The way of cultivating nature is the way of non-action, non-action means stillness, without artificial effort, guarding the centre and embracing the One; the inner furnace has its own true fire, flaming long and red. This is the use of gentle fire for warming and nurturing. As for the way of cultivating destiny, it is the way of action; with action and initiative, the outer furnace must be increased or decreased, diligent in work and calcination. This is the use of strong fire for roasting and boiling. Increase means increasing the deficiency of true-knowledge, choosing good and firmly holding it; decrease means diminishing the excess of spirit-knowledge, rejecting cleverness and destroying wisdom. When increase reaches what cannot be increased, and decrease reaches what cannot be decreased, nature is fixed and destiny is condensed, the true seed attained; then it is wondrous and perfect. The twofold effects of nature and destiny, and the accomplishment of the outer elixir, gathered in the cauldron, is the inner elixir. What was not yet is outer, what has come is inner; this is called the golden returning to nature, and thus it is called the returning elixir.

#### The Second

This medicine is most divine and most sacred, yet the ruler's portion is thin and hard to consume.  
To harmonize lead and mercury not till the end of morning, soon one sees the shape and sign of the mysterious pearl.  
If the aspiring man can cultivate and refine, what harm to dwell in the market or court?  
Work is easy, medicine not far; to say it plainly, men must but smile.

The previous poem explained the inner and outer medicines; this speaks of the practice of the outer elixir. The way of the golden elixir is most divine and sacred; the practitioner sees immediate effect and rises straight to the saintly rank, but fears only that the man's fortune is shallow and thin, hard to endure it. The difficulty in the golden elixir is the true lead of true-knowledge and the true mercury of spirit-knowledge. If one knows true-knowledge and spirit-knowledge and harmonizes them, then hardness and softness correspond, nature and passion as one. No need to wait till the end of morning, the good conscience and good ability show their shape and sign early, like the original pearl arising in darkness. The spiritual root of good conscience and good ability has long been buried and cannot emerge by itself. Now true-knowledge and spirit-knowledge are united as one; though the good root of conscience and ability is not yet pure and perfect, one point of vital energy already has form in the vague and dim. Since there is one point of vital energy, from the subtle it is manifest, gradually recovering purity and perfection. The shape and sign are the precursors of purity and perfection. If a man of aspiration diligently cultivates it, he need not avoid the world or leave the dust; what harm to dwell in market or court? Especially since the way of the golden elixir, the medicine is ready-made, work is simple, no need to seek outside, it is present with people. To say it plainly would but cause men to laugh. Those who laugh are common and sage alike; heaven and man have but one principle, only differing in compliance or resistance.

#### The Third

The white tiger leads to the supreme treasure, the pool of glory, divine water, true gold.  
Thus well know the highest good is of profound source, unlike ordinary medicines.  
If one would attain the ninefold refinement, first must one refine self and hold the mind.  
At proper times gather and discard to fix the rise and fall; advancing fire must beware of grave danger.

The previous poem spoke of harmonizing lead and mercury to form the elixir. Yet to harmonize lead and mercury one must first recognize the great medicine of the one true lead of true-knowledge before taking action. True-knowledge is true passion; in its Dharma image it is the white tiger leading the scripture, also the divine water of the pool of glory; true passion is hidden amid fanciful passion. Passion belongs to Metal, hence called the white tiger. Though true passion is hidden among fanciful passion, it sometimes appears, the heart of heaven and earth reappears, the seed sprouts; hence called the leading scripture. "Leading" means first, "scripture" means the constant way. At the beginning of the Way of scripture, from nothing arises being; Yin contains Yang, mother of all things, that is vital energy. This one point of vital energy is the root of the holy and wise, the basis of becoming Buddha or immortal; hence called the supreme treasure. This vital energy is also called the pool of glory divine water. The pool of glory is the original gate of the one cavity, the door of all subtleties. Because it contains vital energy, it is called the pool of glory; because vital energy washes the hundred bones and purges the five viscera, it is called divine water; because vital energy is condensed and enduring through fire refining, it is called true gold. The leading scripture, the divine water, the true gold are all one vital energy, also called the highest good nature. The highest good is the utmost good, without evil, containing all principles and responding to all things, like water with its source, flowing far and long, benefiting all things without exhaustion. This preserves life and completes the corner, the most true medicine, unlike ordinary herbs, metals, or stones. Yet this medicine is hidden in later Heaven, sometimes appearing, soon lost, unable to remain. If one would refine the ninefold, forever indestructible, one must first refine self and hold the mind, removing alien Qi and dusty passion, gathering in time to fix the rise and fall. Spirit-knowledge is hidden in the human heart; the human heart moves and spirit-knowledge flies, easily floating; true-knowledge is complete in the Dao-heart; the Dao-heart fades and true-knowledge hides, easily sinking. Refining self and holding mind means refining away the spirit-knowledge of the human heart, making the floating sink. Gathering in time means gathering the Dao-heart, making the sinking float. Floating and sinking reversed, by Dao-heart controlling human heart, by human heart following Dao-heart, by true-knowledge commanding spirit-knowledge, by spirit-knowledge nourishing true-knowledge. Human heart quiet, Dao-heart present, true-knowledge and spirit-knowledge are of one Qi and connected branches; golden elixir is hopeful. Yet medicine is easy to know; fire timing is most difficult. The work of advancing fire requires knowledge of the medicine’s age, urgency, and fortune and misfortune. Rashly entering fire is not only useless but harmful; therefore it is said to beware gravely when advancing fire.

#### The Fourth

If one would keep true lead and hold mercury, the lord will not leave the minister.  
Between wood and metal separated, their meeting comes by the matchmaker’s enticement.  
Wood loves metal with obedience and righteousness, metal’s passion clings to wood with benevolence and charity.  
Devouring and devoured yet fond, thus the man is conceived.

The previous poem said gathering medicine depends on refining self. To refine self is to bring the three families together. The way of the golden elixir is simply the two words "hard and soft." The hard is true-knowledge, symbolized by true lead; the soft is spirit-knowledge, symbolized by true mercury. Taking these two substances and uniting them forms the elixir. But if true-knowledge is not manifest, spirit-knowledge easily flies away. True-knowledge restrains spirit-knowledge, yet spirit-knowledge nourishes true-knowledge; spirit-knowledge is like the minister to true-knowledge the lord. If spirit-knowledge is not first fixed, true-knowledge will not appear; thus it is said, if one would keep true lead and hold mercury, the lord must not leave the minister. The lord is true-knowledge; the minister is spirit-knowledge. If the minister is not obedient, the lord finds it difficult to act. True-knowledge and spirit-knowledge contend only by a hair’s breadth. When spirit-knowledge is sufficient, true-knowledge appears; when true-knowledge remains, spirit-knowledge is obedient. True-knowledge remaining is strength; spirit-knowledge quiet is softness and顺 (harmony). Hard and soft thus agree; nature and passion unite. The Way of the elixir takes true lead and true mercury, two medicines alone. True-knowledge’s lead belongs to metal; spirit-knowledge’s mercury belongs to wood. Later Heaven acts; passion is West, nature East. Metal and wood are separated, each a family, and cannot meet. If not for true nature connecting, true passion and true nature do not manifest; true-knowledge and spirit-knowledge do not unite. True faith is true intention, also called true soil. When true soil appears, metal and wood come together; when true faith is united, nature and passion unite. True faith is the matchmaker of true passion and true nature. True nature is wood, governing obedience and benevolence; true passion is metal, governing hardness and principle. When nature and passion find faith to harmonize in the middle, wood loves metal’s passion and obeys righteousness, metal’s passion clings to wood’s benevolence and charity. Nature and passion unite, hard and soft correspond, benevolence and righteousness both complete, true-knowledge and spirit-knowledge share the same Qi. Devouring and devoured, nature fixed passion forgotten, prior Heaven’s Qi comes from the void, condenses into a millet grain, the sacred embryo takes form, the man conceived is regulated.

#### The Fifth

Who is the rosy maiden of two and eight? Where is the lord of nine and three?  
Claiming wood’s liquid and metal’s essence, meeting earth, three surnames arise.  
Further with Master Ding’s refining, the couple at last find joyful feeling.  
The river cart dares not pause or stay, bearing upward to Kunlun’s peak.

The previous poem said the three families meeting is to form the sacred embryo. Yet the three families meeting without true fire refining will not bring the sacred embryo. Two is the number of Yin fire, eight the number of Yin wood, thus the rosy maiden is named. Nine is the number of Yang metal, three the number of Yang wood, thus the lord is named. The liquid of wood is fire; wood produces fire, one surname; the essence of metal is water; metal produces water, one surname; earth dwells in the centre, its own surname; these five elements divided into three surnames. The three surnames united form one surname, called the five elements complete. Compared to the cultivator, original nature and original spirit are the family of wood and fire; original passion and original essence the family of metal and water; original Qi the family of earth; these three surnames are inner three surnames. Benevolence and propriety belong to wood and fire as one surname; righteousness and wisdom belong to metal and water as one surname; faith belongs to earth as one surname; these three families are called outer three surnames.

The cultivator uses the inner three surnames to govern the outer three, and the outer three to complete the inner three; altogether to make one surname as the conclusion. But these three surnames require vigorous cultivation, concentrated will, and the application of deathly effort before they can return to one surname. Master Ding’s refining is the work of vigorous cultivation. Vigorous cultivation, lacking benevolence, will surely attain benevolence; lacking righteousness, will surely attain righteousness; lacking propriety, will surely attain propriety; lacking wisdom, will surely attain wisdom; lacking faith, will surely attain faith. Benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom all return to one faith; nature, passion, and spirit are also transformed into one Qi. The three surnames harmonize, hard and soft correspond, nature and passion unite, and the couple find joyful feeling. Once the couple unite joyfully, the longer the stronger, fire work unceasing, one Qi accomplished, surely to attain pure Yang, silent and odourless, then to cease. Hence the river cart dares not pause or stay, carrying upward to Kunlun’s peak. The river cart is the upright Qi of the North, not the practice of moving kidney Qi from the base to the vertex. It is one Qi accomplished, using water to aid fire, water and fire roasting and boiling without interruption. Like the waterwheel in the river, carrying water up and down, turning day and night without pause. Kunlun is the ancestor of ten thousand mountains; to carry up to Kunlun’s peak is the gathering of the three flowers at the crown, the five Qi greeting the origin, entering true emptiness and wondrous existence, unknowable and unknowing, following the Emperor’s rule and place.

#### The Sixth

Seven returns cinnabar to root, nine returns golden liquid to true.  
Do not bring in Tiger and Rat numbers, but only require the five elements be precise.  
Originally mercury one substance, wandering and traversing the stars.  
Yin and Yang numbers suffice to communicate spirit, entering and exiting not apart from the mysterious feminine.

The previous poem spoke of gathering the five elements and refining fire, thus success is possible. Yet refining requires knowledge of the true principle of seven returns and nine returns. Seven is the Yang number of fire; nine is the Yang number of metal. Spirit-knowledge’s nature is soft, hiding evil fire within; evil fire is consumed and true fire arises, like spirit mercury forming cinnabar, forever fixed and not flying away, fire returns to root. True-knowledge’s passion is hard, containing dry metal; dry metal transforms into pure true gold, like turbid metal changing to liquid, forever most pure and bright gold; gold returns to its truth. This elixir scripture of seven returns and nine returns is by the worldly heterodox sects taken to mean the numbers from Rat to Monkey as nine returns, from Tiger to Earth as seven returns; do they understand the meaning of seven returns and nine returns? Not understanding seven returns and nine returns, how can one know the five elements are correct? The five elements correct means fire returns to root, fire contains wood within, and spirit arises. Spirit means spirit-knowledge is not darkened; gold returns to true, metal arises in water and essence is one. Essence one means true-knowledge is ever present. Spirit-knowledge not darkened, true-knowledge ever present. True-knowledge is spirit-knowledge, spirit-knowledge is true-knowledge. Metal, wood, water, fire, the four images harmonize and unite, returning to the centre; five elements one Qi, neither偏 (偏) nor倚 (倚), perfectly natural principle. The five elements correct. Yet the work of five elements correct is always the great medicine of metal in water. The mercury used is silver in water, that is metal in water, still one point of true-knowledge and true passion. True-knowledge contains the prior Heaven true one Qi, root of five elements, basis of the four images. Moving it produces Yang, resting it produces Yin, circulating through the positions of the four images and five elements and the stars.

The way of return and return is to act at Yang times to advance Yang fire to gather true-knowledge; at Yin times to operate Yin talisman to nourish this knowledge. When the Yang fire and Yin talisman numbers suffice, the five elements mix and change, good knowledge and good ability silently unmoving, sensing and thus communicating, naturally communicating spirit. Spirit is the unpredictable Yin and Yang. Yin and Yang unpredictable, the sacred embryo condensed, called the Valley Spirit; the Valley Spirit undying, called the No Feminine; the original feminine gate, called the root of heaven and earth. Yin and Yang numbers sufficient, the original feminine is established; the original feminine established, the Valley Spirit enters and exits the gate of the original feminine, long living and undying; the way of return is complete. The saying, "To gain the Valley Spirit long undying, one must rely on the original feminine to establish the root," is thus.

#### The Seventh

The male contains the female substance within, bearing Yin yet embracing Yang essence.  
The two medicines harmonize, the formula complete; they refine the soul, subtle spirit, and saint.  
The one grain of the elixir opens the way; the snake swallows and changes to dragon, the chicken eats and transforms to phoenix, flying into the pure realm of true Yang.

(The one embraces the other; the subtle spirit and soul prevail; indeed one can be one.)

The previous poem on seven returns and nine returns requires sufficient Yin and Yang numbers. Yet to operate Yin and Yang requires knowing true Yin and true Yang. The male containing female substance is, in the trigram, Li in vacancy; in man, the spirit-knowledge hidden in the human heart. Bearing Yin yet embracing Yang essence is, in trigram, Kan in fullness; in man, the true-knowledge supplied by the Dao-heart. True-knowledge and spirit-knowledge, the two medicines, harmonize only together to form the elixir. Soul is Yang containing Yin, that is the spirit of true-knowledge; spirit is Yin containing Yang, that is the spirit of spirit-knowledge. The soul slight is Yang deficient, the spirit abundant is Yin excess; Yang lacking and Yin excess, unbalanced and incomplete, the golden elixir cannot form. Only when true-knowledge and spirit-knowledge meet, the soul and spirit return to the middle and straight, transform into true nature and true passion, Yin and Yang mixed as one, heavenly principle clear, human desire extinguished. Good conscience and good ability are round and full, bright and shining, pure and bare, crimson and bare, one grain of golden elixir suspended in the vast void, illuminating the three thousand great thousand worlds, in all directions, right and reverse, rewarding and obstructing.

This elixir, if man swallows one grain, immediately becomes immortal; if snake swallows one grain, it also changes to dragon; if chicken eats one grain, it also transforms to phoenix, flying directly into the pure realm of true Yang. But snake swallowing chicken also symbolizes the elixir method. Snake belongs to fire, in the South Li; dragon belongs to wood, in the East Zhen; chicken in the West, belongs to metal, Dui; the phoenix near water, in the North Kan. The snake swallowing and becoming dragon means wood arising in fire; chicken eating becoming phoenix means metal arising in water. Wood arises in fire, metal born in water; metal and wood join, water and fire aid; one Qi mingled, existence and non-existence established, things and self returning to emptiness, form and spirit both subtle entering the saint, this is called spirit. To escape the mundane world and dwell in the realm of pure Yang, is it empty talk?

#### The Eighth

Heaven and earth just meet or separate, morning and evening well known as confusion and ignorance.  
Spokes gather to form the wheel, water flows eastward; the marvel is in subtracting and adding for use.  
To gain the myriad things is all complete, no need to divide South, North, West, East.  
Decreasing again decreasing, be cautious of previous work; life treasure should not be lightly handled.

The way of the golden elixir is the way of creation. The way of creation is the way of Yin and Yang. Within a year, at the month of Yin, heaven Qi rises and earth Qi descends, becoming Prosperity (Tai); at the month of Shen, earth Qi rises and heaven Qi descends, becoming Decline (Pi). Within a day, at the hour of Zi (midnight), the beginning of morning, Yang Qi moves inward, Yin Qi moves outward, called Difficulty (Tun); at the hour of Wu (noon), the beginning of evening, Yang Qi moves outward, Yin Qi moves inward, called Ignorance (Meng). Prosperity and Decline are the yearly spring and autumn rises and falls of Yin and Yang; Difficulty and Ignorance are the daily morning and evening come and go of Yin and Yang. Observing the meeting and parting of heaven and earth, one understands the daily coming and going of difficulty and ignorance. One day’s Yin and Yang messages are like the yearly Yin and Yang messages. Yet the year’s Yin and Yang and the day’s Yin and Yang are always one Qi, coming and going and using. The cultivator follows the seasons of heaven and earth’s Prosperity and Decline, observes the moments of morning, evening, difficulty, and ignorance; at the Yang time advances Yang fire, at Yin time applies Yin talisman. Yang firmness and Yin softness do not lose their time, gather righteousness to arise, cluster the five elements, harmonize the four images, like thirty spokes meeting at one hub to form a wheel, like a thousand streams flowing to the same sea, all one Qi, the golden elixir condensed. Though the golden elixir is condensed, its marvel lies in subtracting and adding for use. Subtracting means taking away false Yin and false Yang; adding means adding true Yin and true Yang. False Yin gone and true Yang appears; false Yang gone and true Yin arises. True Yin and true Yang returning to the middle, both unite as one; true-knowledge and spirit-knowledge, nature and passion unite, good conscience and good ability reappear in original face. The marvel of subtracting and adding.

Generally, to cultivate the elixir, one must know true Yin and true Yang and also the prior Heaven true one Qi. This Qi existed before chaos was divided, before Yin and Yang parted. Contain it and it is true emptiness; release it and it is wondrous existence. Its image is metal in water; its substance is the held eternal heavenly goodness; its use is the essence one Dao-heart. The elixir method takes only the Dao-heart, one great medicine. Though the Dao-heart is one medicine, it governs the five elements Qi and possesses the virtue of the five elements. The Dao-heart is the one water transformed; the one is the beginning of numbers; one contains five, five returns to one. When it returns to one, it cannot be called Dao-heart, only the perfectly natural principle. Thus the Confucians call the perfectly natural principle the Supreme Ultimate; Daoists call it the Golden Elixir; Buddhists call it Perfect Enlightenment. The ancient scriptures say, "To get the one, all things are complete." If one gets the one, the life treasure is in hand, no need to differentiate South, North, West, East or gather by cluster method. But by the Dao-heart one guards the human heart, decreasing again and again. One must completely transform all alien Qi of the human heart, entirely soft and obedient spirit-knowledge, then the human heart also becomes Dao-heart.

The human heart has the spirit of cognition residing, the spirit of cognition carries the root seed of kalpa dust and the Qi of worldly habit, and the evil of the whole body temperament. If these roots of calamity are not diminished one by one, a single thread left will suddenly arise, the life treasure leaks, all previous work is wasted; hence it is said to be cautious of previous work, and life treasure should not be lightly handled. The ancient immortals said, "If a single hair of Yang Qi is not exhausted one does not die; if a single hair of Yin Qi is not exhausted one does not become immortal." Therefore after attaining the elixir, one must root out the seeds of beginningless kalpas, birth and death cycles, and only then will the life treasure truly be mine, forever unspoiled.

#### The Ninth

At winter solstice one Yang returns, every thirty days adds one Yang line.  
Within the month the Fu trigram renews at new moon, after full moon Gan ends with the Gou sign.  
The sun also divides into cold and heat, Yang born returning at midnight.  
At noon Gou shows one Yin morning, refining medicine must know dusk and dawn.

The previous poem spoke of the work of subtracting and adding, teaching men to imitate the creation of heaven and earth from dusk to dawn. The year’s dusk and dawn: at the eleventh month, winter solstice, one Yang is born; every thirty days one Yang line is added. At the eleventh month, Zi one Yang born, is Fu (復); twelfth month Chou two Yang born, is Lin (臨); first month Yin three Yang born, is Tai (泰); second month Mao four Yang born, is Da Zhuang (大壯); third month Chen five Yang born, is Guai (夬); fourth month Si six Yang born, is Gan (乾); these are the six Yang trigrams. At the fifth month Wu one Yin born, is Gou (姤); every month thirty days adds one Yin line; sixth month Wei two Yin born, is Dun (遁); seventh month Shen three Yin born, is Pi (否); eighth month You four Yin born, is Guan (觀); ninth month Xu five Yin born, is Bo (剝); tenth month Hai six Yin born, is Kun (坤); these are the six Yin trigrams. Six Yang months are dawn, six Yin months are dusk; this is the year’s dusk and dawn.

Within a month, between new and full moon, sun and moon meet; the moon receives the sun’s light. After three days the sunlight first overflows the sea, and the tide responds with Fu; every two and a half days one Yang line is added. By the fifteenth day the moon is full, brilliance complete at Gan. From the first to the fifteenth is the six Yang trigram. After full moon at sixteen to eighteen days one Yin is born, sunlight wanes, Gou is the beginning of the sign; every two and a half days one Yin line is added. By the thirtieth day new moon the light disappears, leaving only the black body Kun. From the sixteenth to thirtieth is the six Yin trigram. Two and a half days one phase, twelve phases pass through six Yang and six Yin trigrams; this is the month’s dusk and dawn.

Within a day, also divided into cold and heat. Each day at midnight Zi hour, one Yang is born, Fu; every hour adds one Yang line. By Si hour six Yang born, Gan. At Wu one Yin born, Gou; every hour adds one Yin line. By Hai hour six Yin born, Kun. Twelve hours pass through six Yin and six Yang twelve trigrams; this is the day’s dusk and dawn.

The sage moves the year’s Yin and Yang dusk and dawn into one month; moves the month’s Yin and Yang dusk and dawn into one day; further moves the day’s Yin and Yang dusk and dawn into one hour. One hour has eight quarters; one quarter fifteen minutes; eight quarters total one hundred and twenty minutes. The upper four quarters six tens of minutes are six Yang; the lower four quarters six tens of minutes are six Yin. Further the hour’s Yin and Yang dusk and dawn move into one quarter, divided into fifteen minutes; above seven and a half minutes is Yang, below seven and a half minutes is Yin. Within a moment one takes the great medicine, returns to the cauldron of creation, moves Yang fire and Yin talisman to calcine and refine the elixir; called the moment’s midpoint dividing Zi and Wu, no trigram separates Qian and Kun within. But one must know the birth of Yin and Yang dusk and dawn. Knowing dusk and dawn, the creation of one day, one month, one year is within one hour and one quarter. Those blind men of the world, some practice sitting meditation at Zi, Zi, and Wu hours; some use the month’s new and full moon to circulate Qi; some cultivate at winter solstice and summer solstice; how know they the principle of dusk and dawn?

#### The Tenth

Not discerning the five elements and four images, how divide cinnabar, mercury, lead, silver?  
Refining elixir and fire timing never heard, early call to dwell in seclusion.  
Unwilling to think on own error, further teaching erring path to others,  
Misleading them eternally in the mire, how can one deceive heart and bear it?

The previous poem spoke of refining medicine requiring knowledge of Yin and Yang dusk and dawn; this poem follows closely for those ignorant of Yin and Yang dusk and dawn. The Way of immortals originally desires to perfect self then perfect things, cultivate Dao then cultivate virtue. The confused path of the world is not discerning the true principle of five elements and four images, not understanding the allegories of cinnabar, mercury, lead, silver; medicines unknown, fire timing not asked, learning some heterodox minor doctrines, self-conceited as having Dao, calling themselves recluses. They will not think on their own error, but teach others the wrong path, leading one blind man after another, misleading men into confusion, never able to transcend. Such deceiving and bearing heart, should enter the hell of no question, never to see day of release; still hoping to attain Dao?

#### The Eleventh

Virtue cultivated beyond eight hundred, Yin merit accumulated to three thousand.  
Equalizing things and self and kin and foe, then accords with original wish of immortals.  
Tiger and rhinoceros, knives and arms cannot harm, the impermanent fiery house cannot drag.  
After the treasure talisman descends and leaves for heaven’s court, firmly driving phoenix chariot and phoenix carriage.

The previous poem spoke of heterodox paths that do not understand Dao but only injure virtue, unable to cultivate virtue. This poem speaks that after cultivating Dao, one must cultivate virtue.

The cultivator cultivates for self; the virtue cultivator cultivates for others. Cultivating Dao has end; cultivating virtue has no end. Therefore after the Way of immortals is accomplished, three thousand merits completed, eight hundred practices fulfilled, self and others and kin and foe forgotten equally; measure equal to heaven and earth, embracing all things, Dao and virtue both complete; then original wish accords. At this stage, inner and outer are empty; existence and non-existence upheld; form and spirit both subtle; tiger and rhinoceros cannot harm; knives and arms cannot add; the impermanent fiery house cannot drag. Treasure talisman descends and summons, firmly driving phoenix chariot and phoenix carriage, ascending by day, great man’s achievement and fame, is it not joyful?

#### The Twelfth

The cow and girl’s affection and Dao unite, the tortoise and snake’s kind inherit nature.  
The toad and crow meet the new moon and unite as the beautiful; the two Qi mutually aid and circulate.  
Originally the wondrous use of Heaven and Earth, who can reach this true explanation?  
If Yin and Yang are separated, then arises fault; how can heaven and earth be long-lasting?

True explanation (one text, deep abyss).

The above eleven poems all speak of cultivating the great Way of the golden elixir; true Yin and true Yang medicines of the same kind must combine to form the elixir. Yet some suspect this is forced, but it is not forced, all is natural operation. This poem summarizes the preceding meaning, urging the learner to exhaust the true principle. For example, the cow and girl meet on the seventh evening of the seventh month; the tortoise and snake associate by kind; the toad and crow meet new and full moon; all are Yin and Yang two Qi, a mutual feeling and response, a natural union, even the wondrous use of creation of Heaven and Earth. The way of creation of Heaven and Earth is the way of one Yin and one Yang. Yin and Yang mutually assist, one Qi flows, Yin then Yang, Yang then Yin, Yin and Yang going back and forth, the four seasons proceeding, all things born, vital energy unceasing, therefore ancient and modern ever remain. The cultivator, if not reaching this true explanation, abandoning the principle of Yin and Yang creation, attaching to emptiness and form, forcing and striving, reverses Yin and Yang separation, not only does no good to nature and life, but also injures nature and life. Fault and error cannot be avoided, still wishes heaven and earth to be eternal, to be immortals without death? Is it so or not?

The way of heaven’s eternity and earth’s longevity is the way of true Yin and true Yang combining. True Yin and true Yang combining, within vital energy flourishes, condenses the sacred embryo. From nothing to being, from being to nothing, shedding the illusory body to produce the true body, then can one be long with Heaven and Earth. The cultivator, if wishing for the eternal, abandoning true Yin and true Yang, has no other method.

### Additional Poem of the West River Moon, Symbolizing the Moistening Moon

The elixir is the treasure of the coloured body, refined to endless transformations.  
Further in nature investigate true ancestry, decisively concluding the wondrous use of no birth.  
No need for other body or later world, immediately obtain Buddha’s spiritual power.  
Since the Dragon Maiden practiced this skill, who after can continue her footsteps?

This poem and the following five quatrains, according to the Immortal Master’s preface, are not counted in the main collection of Awakening to the Truth, but are an external collection. Their meaning is to first cultivate destiny, then cultivate nature. The annotations of Xue, Lu, Chen, due to their teaching of cultivating destiny, included them in the main collection; now we follow this.

Yuan Duzi said, "One point of Yang essence, secret in the shaped mountain, not in heart or kidney, but in the one cavity of the original gate." One point of Yang essence is the elixir. Secret in the shaped mountain is the treasure of the coloured body. The elixir is not a separate thing, but the prior Heaven one point of utmost Yang essence, also called prior Heaven true one Qi, also called majestic upright Qi; concealed it is true emptiness, released it is wondrous existence; its substance is heavenly goodness; its use is Dao-heart; it is the treasure of the human coloured body, not a thing of heart or kidney, but concealed in the original gate. The original gate one cavity has no place or location, no form or image. This elixir also has no place or location, no form or image, moves freely, colour and emptiness unbound, lively and active, like fire refining into solid; always responding and always still, always still and always responding, transformations endless, mystery unfathomable. Though heaven and earth and spirits cannot grasp it, it is measured in the coloured body, and can transform the coloured body; this is called the Dharma body. Hence ancient immortals said, "Life’s creation is tied to the body."

Tied to the body means tied to the Dharma body. The Dharma body accomplished, sacred embryo complete, life foundation firm, the matters of action done, the matters of non-action manifest, one can cultivate nature. The true ancestry of nature is the wondrous use of no birth. Cultivating destiny is to prolong life; cultivating nature is to have no birth; no birth means no death. No birth and no death, one with the great void, form and spirit both subtle, forever freed from the cycle of birth and death, transcending Heaven and Earth, no need for other body or later world, immediately obtaining Buddha spiritual power. The way of no birth is sudden enlightenment and perfect penetration; all things are empty, directly crossing the farther shore. Formerly at Mount Ling, the World Honoured One preached the Dharma; a seven-year-old Dragon Maiden arose from the earth, offering a precious pearl, instantly becoming Buddha. The Immortal Master cites the case of the Dragon Maiden offering the pearl to prove cultivating the nature of true emptiness. Cultivating the nature of true emptiness is the Dragon Maiden offering the pearl. Realizing true emptiness, neither birth nor death, is to obtain Buddha spiritual power. But if destiny is not cultivated, nature is hard to understand. Hard to understand means able to suddenly enlighten and penetrate, nurturing nature, yet not escaping later Heaven, not having passed great fire refining, with slight leakage, hard to avoid the peril of body casting into body. After cultivating destiny, then cultivating nature. Emerging from the great fire furnace, all dross transformed, thereafter practising the way of non-action to cultivate nature, from gradual to sudden, directly ascending to the highest vehicle of wondrous enlightenment; how can one cast body into body? Therefore it is said no need for other body or later world, immediately obtaining Buddha spiritual power. Thus it is known that the great Way of the golden elixir first cultivates destiny, then cultivates nature.

### Five Quatrains of Seven Characters, Symbolizing the Five Elements Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth

#### The First

Though thou hast realized the nature suchness,  
Yet cannot avoid casting body to enter body.  
Why further cultivate the great medicine,  
Suddenly transcend no-leak to become perfect man?

The nature of suchness is natural and free, totally without striving, neither form nor emptiness in nature; called unknowing and unknowable, following the Emperor’s rule. To cultivate this nature, one must realize it; once it is realized, one must refine it into an adamantine indestructible thing to achieve success. If realized but not refined, life is not by me but by Heaven; when the great limit comes, no support remains, casting body to enter body, how can one avoid it? After sudden enlightenment, do not abandon gradual cultivation; use Yang fire and Yin talisman to cook the great medicine, refining many Yin, shedding attachments, manifesting true body. Then entering water not drowning, entering fire not burning, tiger and rhinoceros cannot harm, knives and arms cannot add, becoming perfect man without leak.

Formerly the Sixth Patriarch, having received transmission from the Fifth Patriarch, concealed among hunters in Sihui, mingled with the vulgar and harmonized the light, and achieved the true fruit. Zi Xian suddenly enlightened and fully penetrated, knowing it was not a matter of upward striving, must receive transmission from Xinglin before great achievement; all only a plan to cultivate great medicine. If truly enlightened to suchness, is to become Dao. The Sixth Patriarch having realized original nothingness, what was the midnight transmission of the Fifth Patriarch? Zi Xian suddenly enlightened and sought Xinglin, for what reason? It is known sudden enlightenment and gradual cultivation are both indispensable; either sudden enlightenment then gradual cultivation, or gradual cultivation then sudden enlightenment. Nature and destiny both must be cultivated; work must have two stages. This poem proceeds from nature and destiny, sudden enlightenment to gradual practice.

#### The Second

Reborn, stealing dwelling, moving residence,  
Old abode named the four fruit followers.  
If one can subdue dragon and tame tiger,  
True gold building, when will it wither?

Reborn means foreseeing the wealthy family’s pregnant woman, and at birth time, the reborn enters. Stealing dwelling means at birth time, an Yin spirit waits to enter the orifice; without waiting for it, the reborn enters first and seizes the dwelling. Moving residence means the weakening body selects a strong newborn and secretly transfers. Old abode means a strong person died suddenly, borrowing his hot corpse to enter orifice and dwell old house. Reborn and stealing dwelling are much the same; moving residence and old abode much the same. The four all refine Yin spirit going in and out at will; Buddhist sect calls these four fruit followers, also called outer way; these come from the two vehicles; not the supreme vehicle of realizing true suchness of Buddhism. Different from ordinary men only in clear coming and going. But the way of the golden elixir descends the Eastern family; true nature’s dragon subdues the Western family; true passion’s tiger returns passion to nature, nourishes passion by nature, nature and passion unite, dragon and tiger meet, giving birth to the great law body, like true gold building, long with Heaven and Earth, forever unwithering. How can there be moving this or that?

#### The Third

Examining shape, closing breath, thinking spirit method,  
Beginning hard, afterwards smooth road.  
Suddenly able to roam ten thousand lands,  
Alas old house yet moving residence.

Examining shape is suspending a mirror on the wall, preserving spirit within, after long time Yin spirit goes out. Closing breath at first one breath, two breaths not out, then ten breaths, hundred breaths not out, gradually never out, Qi moves internally. Thinking spirit is sometimes silently facing Emperor above, sometimes ladder ascending to manifest saint, sometimes thinking spirit issues from fontanelle, sometimes from bright hall, many such kinds. Beginning hard, afterwards smooth road, years distant, also able to send Yin spirit abroad, but only solitary Yin. Qi and blood weakening, casting away this body to enter that body, what use for nature and life?

#### The Fourth

Buddhists teach to cultivate the Ultimate Bliss,  
Because Ultimate Bliss is the Metal direction.  
Mostly colour and form truly this only,  
The other two are not true, mere delusive measure.

Ultimate Bliss is in the West; West is Metal’s direction; in man it is the hard true-knowledge passion. This passion is firm and pure, hard for all things to move, like metal’s utmost hardness, enduring and indestructible. Cultivating Ultimate Bliss is cultivating this true-knowledge true gold. True gold refined, hard and soft, all dross transformed, substance possessing brightness, becomes utmost treasure. Formerly Burning Lamp cultivated it and became the exquisite treasure tower; Shakyamuni cultivated it and became the great law body; mostly in colour and form. Only refining this hard true-knowledge passion is true treasure. Other than this, the other two are not true, merely delusive measures.

#### The Fifth

Common speech says to unite with the ultimate way,  
One should search carefully within it.  
If turning daily use upside down to seek,  
All dust and sand of earth become treasure.

The Way is not far from men; men who seek the Way are far from men. The way of nature and life is the constant way. The constant way is the way of daily use, only the common folk use it unknowingly. To cultivate nature and life one must exhaust the principle of the constant way. If one can search carefully the principle, no need to read thousands of scriptures, in common speech and sayings are great revelations of heaven’s secret. For example, praising good men: "Honest men, upright men, with conscience, with heavenly principle, with dignity, knowing contentment, knowing advance and retreat, minding before and after, thorough and far-reaching, feet firm on the ground." Criticizing bad men: "Not human, no conscience, no heavenly principle, harming others and benefiting self, deceiving heart and darkening self, injuring heaven and harming principle, taking suffering as joy, taking falsehood as truth, careless and forgetful, taking east and forgetting west, not knowing life or death, not knowing good or bad, knowing only one side and not the other, knowing only self and not others." Such words, spoken without intention, played with for taste, why not pick one or two from these common sayings and study, to open a hole or a gap? It is in daily use and conduct; seeking contrary to it, the whole earth and dust are treasures, each point the Way, left or right, none not fit. The learners of the world all say the Way cannot be spoken, unwilling to put in real work to exhaust the principle of nature and life; also cannot humble themselves to seek teacher or friend’s help; even if seeking help, cannot be honest and serious; having nothing, seeking treasure with empty hands. Such conduct, though a whole life in monastic life, traveling the ends of the earth, what help is it?
