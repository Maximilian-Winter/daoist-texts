# The Twenty-seven Precepts of Laozi

The Twenty-seven Precepts of Laozi are derived from the Daoist canon Yunji Qiqian, composed of the "Nine Practices" and the "Twenty-seven Precepts." These precepts are divided into the Nine Practices, the Superior Nine Precepts, the Middle Nine Precepts, and the Inferior Nine Precepts. According to the degree of observance, there are different effects in holding to the precepts.

## The Nine Practices  
Practice non-action; practice softness and weakness; practice preserving the female principle, do not move first—these are the highest three practices.

Practice namelessness; practice purity and stillness; practice promoting goodness—these are the middle three practices.

Practice loyalty and filial piety; practice contentment; practice yielding and concession—these are the lowest three practices.

The above Nine Practices, collected from two sections and eighty-one chapters, constitute the Dao Abode, where rank and station are equal in kind. Those who have completed the Nine Practices are immortals; those who have completed six practices attain longevity; those who have completed three gain added years.

## The Superior Nine Precepts  
Refrain from wasting the spirit; refrain from eating things that contain blood or delighting in fair appearances; refrain from injuring the royal qi. Refrain from coveting treasures and riches; refrain from forgetting the Dao; refrain from acting falsely and hastily. Refrain from attaching to forms and names of the Dao; refrain from killing living things; refrain from coveting fame and rank. These are the Superior Nine Precepts.

## The Middle Nine Precepts  
Refrain from being amused by the ears, eyes, nose, and mouth; always practice humility and yielding; in all matters, be thorough and attentive, not distracted and alarmed. Refrain from learning the evil arts; refrain from nourishing the body with fine clothes and delicacies; refrain from seeking fame and reputation. Refrain from coveting high honour and striving forcibly; refrain from rashness; refrain from excess and overflowing. These are the Middle Nine Precepts.

## The Inferior Nine Precepts  
Refrain from contending with others over right and wrong, gain and loss; avoid them; refrain from all evils; refrain from despising poverty and lowliness, and from forcibly seeking wealth and honour. Refrain from many taboos; refrain from claiming the great names of sages; refrain from violence and force. Refrain from praying or sacrificing to ghosts and spirits; refrain from self-righteousness; refrain from delighting in arms. These are the Inferior Nine Precepts.

The above Twenty-seven Precepts, in these two sections, together form the Dao Abyss, where rank and station proceed alike. Those who complete the Superior Nine Precepts become immortals. Those who hold the eighteen precepts attain longevity. Those who hold the nine precepts increase their years, and will not die untimely.
