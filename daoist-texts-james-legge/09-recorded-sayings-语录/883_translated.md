# Preface to the Record of the Utmost Truth of the Perfected Man of Long Life in Non-action and Pure Tranquillity

I have heard that the Way dwells within the realm; it should be gently cultivated and brought to perfection. The Immortals abide beyond the image; it cannot be sought carelessly. Hence the poem of Le Tian runs thus: 'If there be not the form of golden bones, one cannot be enrolled among the names of the elixir platform. If one have not the good roots sown through a hundred thousand kalpas, and obtained the spirit of the Three, Five, and One True, how can one attain this condition?' Now Master Liu, the Son of Long Life, assumes this form and adopts this name. In former times he met the Perfected Man Wang of Chongyang, who saved and enlightened him; he passed beyond the world and entered the Way, clearly discerning the nature of wisdom, comprehending and opening it without obstruction.

Yesterday he was summoned by imperial decree to an audience, and there was a poem: 'In former years the late emperor of Shan You issued an edict; today the Holy Emperor of Dong Lai proclaims it. After two years he reports his return; the officials demand words, saying: "Floating and drifting like clouds and water, yet returning to Dong Lai; the Immortal companions of the Great Microcosm crowned with stars. Truly like Chen Xi-yi, who in ancient times received the favour of Song, and declined to remain at Hua Mountain." The edict replies: "The jade hall and golden palace, for a while we rejoice in attendance; the mountain-hut and cloud-carriage, swiftly sought for retirement."' Thus the two great sages, unrestrained, each excel in the splendour of the morning; they pursue the Way in like fashion, differing only in place.

Since the Master himself returned to his native place, observing the Great Microcosm, annotating the various scriptures, and tracing the ancients of the three sages, he has, by means of his writing, been free and unconfined, enjoying his brush and ink; he has composed methods for the exposition of teaching, following the heavy and light precepts of the Buddhist school, creating the manifold gates of the Profound Emperor; he wears the conduct of the Minister Xuan's five constants; he manages his fields and houses, gathers pears and jujubes, and is methodical in all things. Whatever he produces is carved and engraved to be handed down; it renews the hearing and sight of the people; it is recited and sung by the populace; it influences the popular customs; those who understand take refuge therein, the ignorant and rude are suddenly transformed.

One day, two disciples of the Master, Teachers Xu and Li, came from afar to pay their respects. Passing the Creek Pavilion, they entered the Simple Lodge, laid aside their staffs and shoes to rest, and offered the flavours of water and land. After a while, they produced and showed the Master's Record of the Utmost Truth, earnestly requesting a preface and introduction. The duty allowed no refusal, and I washed my heart and perused it throughout. It makes a man vigilant, sincere, awakened and enlightened, at once desiring to cut the ties of the world and cast off the hindrances of karma and delusion.

From beginning to end it sets forth eighty sections of questions, answering them with a luminous ten thousand words. It comprehends and arranges, adduces proofs and gives discussion and judgment; it touches upon the transformations of heaven and earth, the operations of yin and yang; it reveals the sayings concerning life and death, explains the rewards of calamity and happiness, expounds the features of true emptiness, and admonishes against desire for greed and anger. It reaches to the source of suffering and pleasure, of sincerity and falsehood, of purity and impurity, of high and low; such topics are many and none are omitted. All are decided by the profound doctrines of Huang-Lao, and so the affairs of the world are completed. It enables living beings to distinguish doubts and return to correctness, to be suddenly cleared as ice melting, to break open the pond of great darkness, to open the door of spiritual illumination, and to be set free and liberated.

Thus one attains to transcend the sea of suffering, climbs the shore of awakening, removes the filth of the three existences and the five impurities, attains the cause of the samƒÅdhi of one emptiness, casts away the stains of the twelve categories of old defilements, and receives the joy of rebirth in the three thousand worlds. Truly this proceeds from the Record of True Words; it enlightens and guides; it is the result of the conditions of the Dharma. Is this not great?

In the year Renxu of the Qing Tai and He era, on the first day of the first full moon, at Huoze, Duancheng, at the Bian Creek, the Pure White Daoist Han Shiqian Yan Guang respectfully composed this preface.
