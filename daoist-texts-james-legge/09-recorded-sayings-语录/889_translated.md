## Postscript to the Record of the Eighty-five Transformations of Master Xu of Western Mountain

In the year Jiashen of the Jiading reign, the Patriarch Master Xu descended at Jinling, manifesting the teaching of loyalty and filial piety, widely transforming all beings, all returning to the correct Way. There was a layman named Wang, moved by the sacred teaching, who exhausted his family wealth to establish the Chongzhen Daoist Temple west of the Tianqing View. There he enshrined incense and offerings; to this day the temple's appearance remains. Then Shi Cen, following the Master's orders, jointly expounded the profound teaching. Suddenly, disciples Xing Daojian and Liang Daoning also built the Yongwu Daoist Temple north of the Jiahui Tavern, as a place to receive celestial guests. The gathering of clouds and mists numbered more than a thousand. Yet, those truly embracing the determination of gold and stone, with the hunger and thirst of heart, were only Wang Daochong, Song Daosheng, Zhao Daotai, Zhao Daojie, Lin Shouyi, Jia Shoucheng, Liu Daoyi, and Kong Shoushan. These few had read the "Biography of Western Mountain," extolling the Master's merits daily. Recently Song Daosheng brought the recorded "Biography of the Twelve Perfected Lords," requesting corrections and additions. Upon examination, it was seen that the words and reasonings were repetitive, chapters confused and mingled, causing weariness for readers, deeply regretted. Cen therefore corrected the deeds, distinguished chapters and phrases, praying to make eighty-five transformations, each transformation adorned with a poem. Also, Xing Daojian carefully held the scrolls, maintaining consistent orders from beginning to end, worthy of praise, which delighted Cen even more. After the poems were completed, Zhu Shouzhong came to serve as consultant, so that no falsehood or error would remain. Thus the Master's biography was transmitted to the layman without doubt or dispute. Therefore, the Master's sacred功 and道行 have become as clear as the blue sky and white sun. Having adorned the Daoist temple and compiled the poetry and biography, and further receiving Xing Daojian's fundraising for engraving and printing to extend the biography through a thousand generations without limit, how could this transmission not endure forever, making the good names of Xing and Liang never perish? Postscript by Shi Cen, the Brave Enlightened Perfected Man of Western Mountain.

## Preface to the Record of the Eighty-five Transformations of Master Xu of Western Mountain

Immortality can be learned; deathlessness can be striven for by effort—truly, these words are to be believed. The path of immortals lies in the inward accumulation of功 and diligence, the outward practice of virtue and conduct. When功 and conduct become manifest, they move Heaven and Earth, affect ghosts and spirits; this is the natural order.功 and conduct are not matters of wisdom or strength; how could they be attained thereby? In former times, the Patriarch Master Xu purged his heart and made sincere his intention, remaining true, clear, constant, and tranquil; preserving spirit and solidifying vital energy, embracing the primordial and guarding the One — is this not sacred功? Cultivating仁 and 佛德, aiding the poor and rescuing the suffering, when seeing others in peril, always performing salvation; moreover transforming and guiding the good people to enter the Way and cultivate practice, putting others before oneself, without selfishness towards things—is this not the path of道行? From this view, when功 and conduct are just complete, the sacred道 is attained, the Master ascended flying above the Nine Purities, surpassing all ancient and present men unheard of. Then this writing is truly a mirror reflecting the Patriarch’s功 and virtue. The composing of poems is not mere display of ornate words by disciples. The poetry and biography record deeds, praising the great exploits of the Patriarch. One hopes that later scholars may know that the Patriarch thus practiced功 and thus established conduct; if they can follow and imitate, then they will be filled with道 and virtue, and verified as immortals, will they not then run and ride together with the many perfected of Western Mountain? The setting of eighty-five transformations is not merely to record past events, but the Patriarch’s bequeathed teaching and intent to set transformations as protection, which has deep hope for later scholars. Pray they strive hard. At the time, Song Bingwu of great trust, on the day of the Wedge, the Brave Enlightened Perfected Man Shi Cen respectfully composed verses of praise for the sacred virtue, bowing a hundred times in preface.

### Original Transformation

The Patriarch’s surname was Xu, given name Xun, courtesy name Jingzhi. Great-grandfather Ying, grandfather Wu, father Su, generations of Xu family from Xuchang, high-minded and did not serve in office, descendants of Yingyang. Father fled the chaos at the end of Han and settled at Nanchang of Yuzhang, thus the family abode there. In the second year of Haochi Wuwu, his mother dreamed of a golden phoenix holding a pearl falling into her palm; she played with it and swallowed it, then perceived movements in her belly and conceived, giving birth to the Patriarch.

Poem:

The golden phoenix clasped the pearl descending from the Ninth Heaven,  
Saint Mother of Gaoyang gave birth to a worthy sage.  
Red light responds auspiciously rising in the orchid chamber,  
In the Purple Mansion inscribed names carved in jade chapters.  
If father and grandfather had not cultivated virtue and conduct,  
How could sons and grandsons become immortals?  
Profound功 and wondrous道 surpassing ancient and modern,  
Blessing the sovereign and people for hundreds of years.

### Transformation of the Immortal Brothers

Guqu Mountain wanderers, Jun Mai and military protector Mu, were all the Patriarch’s elder brothers.

Poem:

Two Xus cultivate the Way with high skill,  
Secluding themselves in Guqu to avoid worldly toil.  
Unconcerned to compete for gain or serve military ranks,  
Never seeking fame or clinging to vulgar office.  
The lineage of immortals comes from afar,  
Spiritual roots and branches intertwine naturally.  
The Patriarch again obtains brothership,  
Far different from the affairs of ordinary men.

### Transformation of Awakening the Truth

The Patriarch was born wise and perceptive, with noble and handsome appearance, in youth knowing the essence of things, unaffected by worldly nature. Once while hunting, he shot a deer in the Tang; its fawn fell, but the mother deer still turned to lick it and died before completing. Moved to awakening, he broke and threw away bow and arrows.

Poem:

Celestial form and道 appearance clear without dust,  
Eyebrows and eyes pure and serene beyond worldly men.  
Heart vast and tolerant as rivers and seas,  
Sincere mind subduing ghosts and spirits.  
Not by shooting deer was innate nature made clear,  
How could one bind phoenixes and prove the utmost truth?  
Benefiting beings and accumulating陰德,  
Until now功績 remain ever fresh.

### Transformation of Diligent Learning

The Patriarch applied himself to study, extensively mastering classics and histories, understanding astronomy, geography, music, the five phases, prophecies and mysteries, especially delighting in immortality cultivation techniques, achieving great wonders. Hearing that Hao Meng of Xi’an had attained the Perfected Man Ding Yi’s secret methods, he went to study under him and fully received the marvelous transmission.

Poem:

Innately intelligent, surpassing common folly,  
Resolutely penetrating the books of the hundred schools.  
Conducting oneself thus, one must exhaust worldly affairs,  
Seeking immortality requires understanding its pivot.  
How could the wondrous Way be wholly mine?  
I hope to obtain the divine methods to save all beings.  
Fortunately, Lord Hao opened the precious Peaks of Treasure,  
Beautiful indeed,功 and conduct corresponded.

### Transformation of Choosing the Site

Then with Guo Pu, he sought famous mountains and good lands to dwell and cultivate truth, obtaining the sunny side of Western Mountain, the Xiao Yao Mountain at the Jin family residence, and moved there. It is today the blessed place of Xiao Yao, the Palace of Jade Prosperity and Longevity. The Jin family were seen as gods, with later traditions. Day by day he cultivated diligently, and the alchemical well and mortar remain to this day. He sought not fame or position. In the village he transformed the local filial and friendly, and his friends followed his virtue and righteousness.

Poem:

Western Mountain’s blessed land is the immortal capital,  
Green peaks and clear streams worthy of painting.  
Together with Lord Guo, divining the omen,  
Thus granted the Jin family’s joyous relocation.  
Natural geomancy suits cultivation,  
Daily with friends they reap and hoe.  
The village rejoices and follows virtue’s transformation,  
Henceforth the Way’s reputation spreads across rivers and lakes.

### Transformation of Paper Currency

When crossing the Xiao Shu River in search of the flying grass (Fei Mao), the Patriarch paid the boatman two hundred coins. The boatman repeatedly requested more, up to a thousand; the Patriarch agreed. Upon disembarking, the boatman returned with only two rings of money; the rest were paper currency, which amazed the Patriarch, knowing he was a divine man. To this day, the immortal carriage passing by with the boatman only demands two coins, not daring to ask for more.

Poem:

Searching everywhere for the flying grass,  
At Shu River calling for ferry ‘neath green poplars.  
Calm waves and broad banks, crowds hurry swiftly,  
Waves quiet, wind gentle, all guests admire.  
Having paid the Patriarch two coins,  
How could he ask for a thousand?  
Not by paper currency to display divine transformation,  
How could boatmen cheat until now?

### Transformation of Medicine Lake

In Xinjian County, at the drought-stricken lake, many leeches were present. The Patriarch cast a pellet of medicine into the water, and the leeches perished permanently, hence the name Medicine Lake.

Poem:

The lake’s bright ripples meet the clear sky,  
Buzzing locusts and leeches abound in the grass.  
One medicinal pellet cast in the pot,  
Eradicates leeches and kills all insects.  
Waves greet the bright moon, reed beds gleam white,  
Waves face the slanting sun, banks glow red.  
Looking afar, no toxic haze clouds the scene,  
Immortals come and go freely east and west.

### Transformation of Divine Might

Lord Hao, named Meng, style Shiyun, was a native of Puyang, served as magistrate of Xi’an and settled there. He was deeply filial; in summer months he would not swat mosquitoes, fearing they would leave him to bite his parents. At forty he obtained the secret method of the Perfected Man Ding Yi, succeeding the magistrate of Nanhai, Bao Yue, and further received secret arts. During the Huanglong era under Hao, a white cloud talisman descended from Heaven and was bestowed upon him, so that his Taoist arts flourished between Hao and Jin. During the Jin Wu Emperor’s reign, the Patriarch passed down teachings to Shiyun, who imparted all secrets to him. At the end of Yongjia, when Du Qiang invaded Shu and captured prefectures, the Patriarch had already slain the great serpent; Shiyun said: “The serpent is the spirit of Shu; when it dies, Du Qiang will perish.” Indeed so it was. Once he saw a violent storm arise, wrote talismans and cast them on a roof; a blue crow seized them away, and the storm ceased. Asked why, he answered: “On the Southern Lake a boat was caught in the storm; two Taoists called on Heaven to save them; thus the storm stopped.” Verified true. When the magistrate Gan Qing of Xi’an died three days, Shiyun said: “His term is not yet ended; he will litigate in Heaven.” He then went outside beside the corpse; after several days both rose. Qing’s younger brother Bao, a scribe, was moved by this and composed the *Records of Spirit Searching*. Shiyun once crossed the Yuzhang River during a storm, lacking a boat; he used a white feather fan to row across, astonishing onlookers. In the second year of Ningkang, when the Patriarch ascended, Shiyun returned to Xi’an. In the tenth month fifteenth day, the Jade Emperor ordered the Perfected Man Zhou Guang to present the edict summoning Shiyun, who ascended by white deer carriage with four disciples, soaring at midday to the Purple Cloud Mansion. Today the Haoxian Village and Haoxian Temple west of Fenning County are his old residence. In the second year of Zhenghe, approved and titled Divine Might Perfected Man.

Poem:

The magistrate of Xi’an was bold and heroic,  
Filial and perfect in law and magic.  
Blue crow seized talisman, turned back fierce storm,  
White river trod fan crossed raging waves.  
Chasing souls, restoring bodies, reviving Gan Qing,  
Following tracks, slaying serpent, quelling Du Qiang.  
Establishing profound功, edict arrived,  
Riding deer carriage steadily to Heaven’s abode.

### Transformation of Upright Special

Chen Xun from Shu, styled Xiaoju, was a noble scholar, learned and well-informed. When Wei sent Zhong Hui and Deng Ai to attack Shu, and Liu Shan surrendered, Xiaoju was still young, but with aspirations beyond the mundane. He entered Qingcheng Mountain to seek Master Guo Yuanzi, seeking the method to save the world. Later hearing of the Patriarch’s benevolent governance in Jingyang, he hastened to the court, desiring to serve as clerk. The Patriarch accepted him, gave him the post. He set examples, transformed customs, pacified people, and administered the art of persuasion, greatly benefiting all, thus became a disciple and trusted aide, custodian of scriptures and guardian of the medicine furnace. The Patriarch instructed him in strategies and guidance. Formerly the Jade Prosperity official in Xima, known as Chengxian Mansion, who planted a giant parasol tree facing the mansion. In the second year of Zhenghe, approved and titled Upright Special Perfected Man.

Poem:

In troubled times, who venerates scholars?  
He alone entered Qingcheng to seek the pivot of the Way.  
Serving the Patriarch’s benevolent governance,  
Begging to be disciple, gladly hurrying.  
Trusted with scriptures and care of the furnace,  
Will and strength undiminished, overseeing all.  
Until the day the Patriarch ascended,  
Together riding phoenix carriage to immortal lands.

### Transformation of Primary Communication

Zhou Guang of Luling, styled Huichang, descendant of a great general Yu. Fond of astronomy and music in youth, versed in the teachings of non-action and stillness. Once traveling with comrades in Yuntai Mountain of Shu, he obtained the Han dynasty Celestial Master’s methods to chase away spirits and heal the suffering. Hearing of the Patriarch in Jingyang, he came straight to the court, requesting a post. The Patriarch accepted and appointed him to attend, carrying staff and sandalwood shoes, diligent day and night. Following the Way, never deviating, he built a chamber over a hundred steps west of the residence. When the Patriarch ascended, Huichang and Zeng Xingguo rode the dragon carriage together, the residence named Xuanshao Mansion. In Tang dynasty, the governor Zhou Linggong Shaozhen was ancestor, refurbishing the residence and renaming it Xuanshao Mansion. A stone inscription remains. Today’s Tai Xu Temple is the same. In the second year of Zhenghe, approved and titled Primary Communication Perfected Man.

Poem:

Born of noble lineage, talented and fine,  
Learned widely, rejoicing in Lao and Zhuang.  
Following rites, Zhang Gong assisted in unity,  
Seeking the Xu Prefect, calling at Jingyang.  
Attending with staff and shoes, heart never lax,  
Listening to music, resolve ever strong.  
Until the Patriarch’s ascent day,  
Together riding phoenix carriage to immortal lands.

### Transformation of Divine Benevolence

Zeng Heng of Sishui, styled Xingguo, descendant of Chan family. In youth a Taoist, naturally bright and learned, practiced the teaching of Three Heavens Masters. Knowing the arrival of things, traversing famous mountains and peaks, all roads accessible, wondrous talismans curing all illnesses. The divine man Sun Deng saw him and said: “Your bones are fine and spirit pure, diligent and unremitting, you shall become one beyond the Firmament. Strive!” Later retiring in Fengcheng of Yuzhang, hearing of the Patriarch’s reputation, he wished to serve as disciple, which the Patriarch accepted, imparting secret divine formulas and teachings. Later riding dragon carriage ascending to Heaven. Today Fengcheng Zhenyang Temple is his former residence. In the second year of Zhenghe, approved and titled Divine Benevolence Perfected Man.

Poem:

Fine bones and pure spirit, one beyond the sky,  
Diligent, unremitting, verified true.  
Famous mountains and peaks all accessible,  
Wondrous formulas and talismans healing all.  
The master received personal teaching from the immortal Lord,  
The Way ascends to holy realms of truth.  
Flourishing功 and virtue attained,  
Riding cranes and binding dragons, departing the dust.
