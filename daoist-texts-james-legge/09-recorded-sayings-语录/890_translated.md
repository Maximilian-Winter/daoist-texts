# Conversations of the Perfected of Jin

The Master said: Since the opening of Heaven and Earth until this day, men have sunk into degradation without cease or respite. At this very time the immortals appear in the world, the Great Way is about to flourish. Though the people of Heaven form but one host, yet how can it be helped that the wise and the foolish are unequal? The wise turn towards the Way, the foolish turn away from it. Those who turn towards the Way live; those who turn away from it die. A pure heart and calm intention lead to the path of Heaven; a desolate heart and chaotic mind open the gates of Hell. I ask you, gentlemen, which is better—to ascend to Heaven or to enter Hell? Though the Way is revered, and virtue esteemed, is it for the sake of the deluded and foolish that I speak thus? Were it not for the rise of Taoism in the present age, how could the secrets of Heaven’s purity leak into the world, and the wise and enlightened be drawn forth?

The Master said: For men to cultivate themselves, first they must apprehend their nature and destiny, their ancestral root; then cultivate the true to preserve life. The beginning of cultivation requires preserving the Three, embracing the Origin, and guarding the One. To preserve the Three is the essence, qi, and spirit—the true Three Treasures. To embrace the Origin is to hold and guard the original yang true qi. To guard the One is to guard the one spiritual spirit. Spirit has its origin in the heart, which belongs to the south, the fire of Bing and Ding. Within the heart is nature, which belongs to yang. The kidneys produce the original yang true qi; qi belongs to the north, the water of Ren and Gui. Water is life; life belongs to yin. The foregoing explains nature and destiny, revealing their descent. From antiquity to the present, many men know not nature and destiny; today it is made manifest to the world.

The Master said: The study of the Way originally comprises three things. First, one heart intent upon thought, residing only within the immortal cave of the lower elixir field; do not let the mind scatter and be confused. Embrace the original yang true qi, and that is longevity and the root of the true Way. This is the path of death’s departure and life’s entrance, the yin-yang transformation immortal furnace. Within this elixir field, with a clear heart and settled intention, dim and silent, continuous and unbroken, carefully guard it for three or five years; naturally within the furnace of the elixir cauldron, the two qi mingle and become warm in blackness, transformation made void, the spiritual embryo of the immortal forms the vessel; the spirit within the heart becomes sacred and lively, dancing and rejoicing, singing and moving itself. Generally, when spirit obtains the vitality of qi, and qi obtains the purity of spirit, the Yin Conjuration Scripture says: “From the saintly workmanship it is born; from spirit and brightness it issues forth.” Qi is the mother of spirit; spirit is the child of qi. Constantly keep mother and child united and inseparable, and naturally after time the spirit is fixed and the immortal Way achieved. When these two obtain spirit fixed and qi harmonized, then let go the Four Greats, do not seize or grasp, calmly cultivate, and the Way’s qi will be natural, pure and clear; spirit ascends to the upper palace, forever before the eyes, never to look back. When spirit is fixed and black qi harmonized, one should surpass the heavenly years. Let go the heart, be open and broad, free and untroubled, without matters and idle, and this is the accomplishment of the limitless Great Way. Purity and contention come to an end; on a future day when功 is perfected and conduct fulfilled, the Jade Emperor will issue an edict to convene, making one a man without hindrance, long-lived and joyful.

The Master said: In the study of the Way and cultivation, when spirit is unstable and uncertain, the root is that功 is incomplete; regardless of years, one must still embrace and guard it. Master Lü said: Do not say the Great Way is hard to attain; it is simply because功 is not complete.

The Master said: Those who cultivate but are not careful,功 not diligent and spirit not clear; persevere with true practice without failing; mind not troubled nor will reckless; essence not depleted and spirit not flighty.

The Master said: Alas, I see men of the world seeking teachers and the Way, unwilling to be humble and obedient, all saying they can surpass others. Yet when it comes to cultivation, they will not be diligent, careful, or patient; relying only on words, utterly without true功; nor truly diligently cultivating, seeing the poor yet lacking a heart to save them. In all these ways功 is lost and conduct failed; even阴德 diminished, contrary to the Way. Such persons, wishing to become immortals and prove the Way, are very far from it indeed. Now I briefly say the cause of the fruit of the Way: Heaven only aids true功 and true conduct, as with great virtue; such a man naturally moves Heaven and Earth. The Scripture says: “The Supreme Heaven has no favourites, only virtue is its support.” If one wants true功, one must have a clear heart and settled intention, keep spirit compacted, with no movement or action, truly clear and pure, embracing the Origin and guarding the One, preserving spirit and consolidating qi—this is true功. If one wants true conduct, one must cultivate and accumulate virtue, help the poor and relieve suffering, when seeing men in distress always have a heart to save, sometimes transform and induce good men to enter the Way and cultivate; what is done is putting others before oneself, with no selfishness towards all things—this is true conduct.

The Master said: If a man cultivates and nourishes life, first he must accumulate conduct and功. Without conduct, though功 exist, the fruit of the Way is hard to achieve;功 and conduct perfected together—this is called the Perfected Man.

The Master said: We speak to those within the teaching that great enlightenment of nature and principle is necessary, deeply fathoming the mysterious Way, resolved to cultivate and learn immortality. The Scripture of Western Ascension says: “Remove defilements, cease thoughts, purify the heart and guard the One. When all defilements are removed, all matters are finished; this is the essence of our Way.” This is beyond comparison in subtlety. Whenever there is talk of the Way, one should consider and nourish the treasure within oneself, exhort men towards the Way of Heaven, conform to the principle of Heaven, and not speak against Heaven or defame Earth. If one be like Zhang Yuanzi, speaking wild words and returning to speak of matters among spirits, this is a man who has attained the Way. Yet one should be tolerant and not find fault.

The Master said: Those who study the Way must keep their bodies pure and clean; must not kill life, drink wine, eat meat, break precepts, or violate chastity. Always bear all things with forbearance, be hard on oneself and generous to others; abandon, be cautious of, and restrain anger, strangeness, and greed; always practice patience, humility, and frugality. When seeing others suffer, act with a heart to relieve hardship; when seeing men poor and lacking, one must be prompt to help. Prefer others before oneself, treat men with humility, honor superiors and condescend to inferiors, repay kindness with kindness and enmity with kindness. Do not see faults in others, nor speak of their errors; secretly accumulate阴德, seek not to be known by men, but only hope for Heaven’s inspection—this is the Way of the Wayfarer.

The Master said: The Great Way has no fixed form; it is subtle and unfathomable. The saintly man makes it daily use; the common people use it daily and know it not. Turning away from the Way loses the true; movement and feeling bring death; men in the Way are like fish in water; fish lose water and die, men lose the Way and perish.

The Master said: Moreover, the classics say the meaning is hidden and profound, hard to understand at the end. Now only with the language of the common world do I open the mystery and point out the enlightenment. If there be those who do not yet understand, let them seek instruction from later generations of disciples. If they can comprehend the meaning and cultivate, even allowing transmission to disciples again, preserving life and cultivating the true, accumulating blessings to the ends of the earth, helping men with diseases and afflictions—this is great conduct. If one receives these words, the nine ancestors will be freed from guilt, and parents will receive blessings. My wish is to universally save those suffering affliction and the difficulties of life and death. If these words deceive men, they shall forever enter the dark mountains and suffer ten thousand calamities.

A hymn says:
To study the Way one must rely on a man of iron strength,
Resolutely cut off body and mind.
With a single bite sever ignorance,
No more thoughts of before or after.

# Secret of the Ancestor of Double Ninth in Cultivating Immortality and Perfecting Nature

The Perfected is the pure and empty Great Way, the gate of effortless freedom, the truly upright family custom; this is the living work of Double Ninth. Those who cultivate immortality and study the Way, be cautious not to wildly roam or participate in Chan meditation, and do not vainly ask about the Way. In company be watchful of the mouth, accumulate true功, sitting alone guard the heart, accumulate conduct and practice. Do not neglect minor faults without removing them, nor speak of slight conduct without accumulation. The heart-monkey tightly bound, the will-horse firmly captured. The three rebellions dispersed and spirit peaceful, the six robbers subdued and intention settled. Slowly withdraw and add water and fire, subtly regulate breath and true功. Pure, quiet, and tranquil, humble and gentle to refine the heart, respectful to men and beneficial. Carefully examine each walking corpse, remove all things that hinder and stop the running bones. Alas, every man’s tongue contends and is thought able; each is strong and strives to be victorious. Ignorant fire great and so revered, man and I high as mountains and only self is so. In crowds take not the low place; in noise take not the quiet. Desire to dwell and spirit is desolate, move about and intention is confused. There is yet another sort, who live by begging, saying this is true cultivation. Such are lazy devils, fools and stubborn men unawakened. Foolish and aimless stupidity, better to hear early the refining of a stubborn heart, leave false cultivation and perfect the true nature. If holding to clever nature one becomes dim, if fixating on the heart-lamp one suddenly darkens. Stingy and hard to complete the Great Way, cruel and how to realize the Mysterious Truth. Jealous of the worthy and envious of the able, thereby inviting faults; greedy for life and afraid of death, thereby creating crimes. Writing talismans and trading arts to deceive men, indulging in pleasures and curing diseases to seek bribes. Wildly opposing the thieves within the Way, clamouring harm to the multitudes. Not understanding the subtle secret and roaming blindly, heart and mind confused and wildly running. Receiving offerings from all directions of good believers, yet hard to consume. If one carefully cultivates and perfects the true heart, slight negligence and falling leads to sinking in Hell; should one meet a true master and forcibly seek the secret, not allowing fools to know, only requiring all men to awaken themselves. No need for exercises of shaking sinews or twisting marrow, nor deluding men in martial arts’ defence; only understanding the beginning of non-action, self-awareness of spirit and qi harmonized, naturally the elixir furnace and joyful attainment. Manifesting spiritual sand and shining clearly as one, illuminating the divine light splendidly, recognizing the ancestors of the Way and Virtue, recognizing this as the source of leisure, the wondrous gate of nature and life, the mold for transcending spirits and immortals. If all men penetrate this great mystery, they shall obtain longevity and prolonged sight. This is not deceptive speech to mislead men, nor evil arts to entice you. Keenly admonish the great scholars of Quanzhen, earnestly urge the deluded disciples in the world. Each and all awaken to avoid harmful words, everyone together ascend to orthodox teaching. Now I speak of the beginnings of cultivation, able to cut off drought and doubts. I earnestly hope all men leave the mundane and ascend to the true, each severing dust and attaining the Way. May all living beings ascend the immortal palaces.

# The Fourteen Questions Answered to Master Ma

First Question: How is it that the thinking spirit meets the unfathomable place, where dragon and tiger meet? Answer: All that is emptiness and silence.

Second Question: How is the mysterious female gate said to be the root of Heaven and Earth? Answer: “Mysterious” is the father’s essence; “female” is the mother’s blood. At the origin each is eight taels; combined they make one catty. One drop of original yang true qi is the original root.

Third Question: How is the return of life to the root a quiet day? Answer: So long as the heart does not follow after things, is unstained and unattached, heart settled and intention not scattered, spirit not obscured, that is returning to the root. Without this, one cannot return to the root.

Fourth Question: How to see one’s nature? Answer: So long as there is no heart and no thought, not attached to all things, clear and deep, within and without without matter, that is seeing nature.

Fifth Question: How is it to respond to things without obscuration? Answer: Though ears hear, eyes see, mouth speak, so long as the heart does not adhere, that suffices.

Sixth Question: How are the Heavenly Pass and the Earthly Axis, and how to attain mutual guarding? Answer: The Heavenly Pass and Earthly Axis are also the two words spirit and qi; so long as not attached nor stained, when the heart is fixed it is black and fixed; when the heart moves, the qi scatters; if the heart does not move, then mother and child mutually guard.

Seventh Question: How is it to go out from existence and enter non-existence with the three-foot sword, the elixir pill of longevity and immortality? Answer: Going out from existence and entering non-existence is but one blackness. The three-foot sword is wisdom. Longevity and immortality is the one spiritual true nature. The one elixir pill is life. Only use clear and upright no-heart, seek the upright place to sit, nothing more.

Eighth Question: How to regulate breath? Answer: It is not an action. If the heart attains no matter, qi breath naturally regulates; knowing to regulate breath is attachment. To regulate breath one can only not see or know, not attach to nose or mouth. Today I say this to elder brothers, nothing more. Only so long as the heart has no matter, seek a quiet place and sit. The disciple only because the heart has no matter, attains entrance to the Great Way, and follows it.

Ninth Question: How is it that Master Bodhidharma said, “Lift the void and return the face to see”? Answer: Void is one nature; turning the head to see is non-obscuration.

Tenth Question: How is it that the disciple in old age leaves home, sinews and blood withering? I wish the Master to instruct. Answer: Repair it. Asked again: How to repair? Answer: So long as at each point there is no matter, all attachments laid down, six gates not crossed or traversed, only one master; often speak little, not attached to things, through the twelve hours always not obscured, care for sleep; at one time laying down, that is repair.

Eleventh Question: How is lead and mercury? Answer: Lead is father essence, mercury is mother blood; also the two words nature and destiny, dragon and tiger.

Twelfth Question: In quietude there arise all manner of thoughts, or else deep sleep and much. How to have no arising of thoughts and less sleep? Answer: Only by wrapping the head with no substance; spirit is black, subtle and fine. If the head is wrapped with real substance, naturally no thought and no sleep.

Thirteenth Question: How is it the place where Heaven and Earth are unfathomable, where ghosts and spirits do not know? Answer: What else is there?

Fourteenth Question: How is it that in the twelve hours it seems as one hour? Answer: Not only in the twelve hours seeming as one hour, but even for ten thousand days; if there be the slightest difference from one hour, it is early to cut off and perish.

The ● Bun is originally Zhongli’s seal, atop Kunlun’s peak the sun is set. No one dares wash it at Changshan; on the mainland the white ox is freely let loose.

# The Crown

A pair of starry eyes watch front and rear, gathering all laws and inwardly hiding. Inside and outside crystal clear with no trace, shining alone revealing the path majestic.

# The Pouch

Three feet of cloth woven, who knows the work of creation? Within this surpassing the Dharma realm, enveloping great void and emptiness.

Step by step following me forgetting years, coming and going treading old mountains and rivers. From now on no more treading mud and water, let the pair fly across the blue sky.

# Coming and Going

Once departing dust is leaving home, non-action and non-doing my way of life. If men ask me the secret of cultivation, I say the clouds disperse, the blue sky and moon shine by themselves.

# Daily Use

Nourishing nature and forgetting passion is daily use; going door to door begging for transformation is life. Coming and going freely without hindrance, clear wind and bright moon my neighbours.

Spirits and immortals are what men seek; who would cease all their affairs? If one awakens to one’s true nature and destiny, clear wind and bright moon journey together.

# Two Water Dragon Songs

Originally leaving home and departing dust, no more greed for men’s fame and profit. Hair dishevelled and face unwashed, all day sitting alone, cultivating the living work. Wrapped in old temple niches, letting it be, red flowing westward falling. Recognize nothing in the void as existing, know white and guard black, continuous and silent regulating breath. The heart has no other engagements. With armpit pouch and staff accompanying. Straw sandals broken and torn, essence thin legs bare, goat’s skin covering the body. After hunger wander the gates, begging to be filled upon return, singing lililila. Let others laugh, foolish and lazy man, who among men can know?

# Again

The heart of studying the Way is as firm as iron, entirely fierce within oneself. Suddenly unlocking the profit-lock, cutting the reins of fame, giving up all affection. Ten thousand affairs without attachment, no provocation can hold, hut and straw cottage. Dwelling amid market battles, upright guarding the Way, relying on this to pass the months. Become a poor Wayfarer, content with coarse food and without concern for cold or heat. Hair dishevelled and face unwashed, all day sitting alone, cultivating living karma. Upon meeting a bright master’s secret, the world’s Way and turbulent wind come. Some deep and remote, subtle and mysterious times, teaching seven songs, how to speak.

# Hymn

Alone ascending the high mountain to view the eight capitals, black clouds all dispersed, the moon wheel lonely. Vast universe, countless men, which one is the true man?

# Red Explanation

In the deep cave of Heaven and Earth, the Way is not far, yet men find it hard to comprehend. The floating and sinking inner scene requires skillful handiwork. Awaiting the dawn, one point of yang arises, opening the mysterious path. All hidden in the blue waves, deep within, letting matters be master. Earth thunder sounds, shaking mountain heads with rain. Gradually watering yellow shoots just leaving the earth. An infant gathers them into a basket. Toward the true rosy six yang, cooking within the cauldron. Moving and turning, east, west, south, and north. Laying out the Eight Trigrams, Nine Palaces to know the ancestry. Within the ten heavenly stems, dividing left and right, to reveal dragon and tiger. After the Dark Warrior follows the Vermilion Bird, first the auspicious clouds spread. On the curved river, all spirits gather themselves and him. Returning the Gui mother, crossing the red dragon, returning to the cave dwelling. Seek the inquiry of Master Ding, yin and yang gathered in three thousand numbers. Pointing to Heaven, Earth, sea, and mountains, all long-lasting and firm.

# Poem

The Yellow River waters turn at Lü’s home, a pot of Heaven and Earth old mist and clouds. The unfeeling white deer tunes the vermilion phoenix, there is a turtle entwined with the red snake. White snow flies on June mountain peaks, yellow shoots grow long beneath winter waters. Such are the principles men still know, the land immortals chaotic as hemp.

# Green-headed Duck

Words common. Awaken the southern branch one dream of yellow roots. Break splendour, cloud niches spread pure, recognize sects, reflect light back. Rely on the wisdom sword, cleave love’s net; horizontal splendour staff, shatter the dusty world. Where to meet? Mount Emei, swift and busy rushing to Mount Hua. Hidden in forest springs, southern stars with the Northern Dipper, sun and moon kept in the sleeve. Red face long-lasting, Heaven collapsing and Earth crumbling, true nature as always. Dance the robe sleeves, Heaven and Earth narrow in hatred, only spread hands and Heaven and Earth balance. Drunkenly and joyfully holding the four seas, laughing happily belly drinks three cups. Several times at the Jade Pool, at the Dragon and Flower assembly, all immortal special seats, drunkenly fallen with rosy cups. The Jade Emperor’s royal feast, without me no class or rank. The Double Ninth assembly, seven golden lotuses, all blooming with divine light.

# Hymn

Pure bright and clear, round bright white moon, brilliantly shining, water polished lonely disk. Deep green pool reveals reflections, melody remote beyond things, Heaven’s immortals. Dripping and twirling plucked from nowhere, lively and flowing, perfectly complete. Turning and scattering in a crystal bowl, red scattered, a fragment of blue sky.

# Hymn

On Jade Capital Mountain a pool of water, surrounding from all directions bottomless. If yet recognizing the boatman, naturally he will ferry you into the Heavenly Palace.
