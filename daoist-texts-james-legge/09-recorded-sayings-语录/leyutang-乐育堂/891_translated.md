# Record of Lectures in the Hall of Joyous Nurture

## Preface to the Sayings of Master Huang Yuanji

The book entitled "Sayings" is a work which Master Huang Yuanji taught in the Hall of Joyous Nurture, expounding the method of the heart-mind. He originally did not dare lightly to divulge it. Why then is it now publicly made known to the world? It is because, in the course of the late cycle of the Lower Epoch, the human heart is extremely deceitful and treacherous; the condition of the world is sinking ever deeper into ruin; there is no one who arises to expound the learning of the origin and source in rectitude and purity; the Great Way is obscure, and men know not whither to turn. The Master came in response to the times from Fengcheng, pitched his tent here for more than ten years, and whenever he expounded on the Awakening Heart Scripture, the Seeking Heart Scripture, or the Tao Te Ching, he would always also instruct his disciples in the principles of cultivating both nature and life, of the unity of Heaven and Man, leaving nothing unexplained or undeveloped. His intention was to form men of ability, to transmit the orthodox tradition of the ancients above, and to initiate the hearts of the later learners below; how could he fear that the supreme Way should not be made clear?

Although the books of Confucius and Mencius also contain the study of nature and life, they do so in a concealed manner, not openly expressed; readers have no means of understanding them. But this "Sayings" is extremely profound in principle, yet manifest in its words, leading step by step into fascination. The cultivators of the True Way, if they obtain this as a ladder and guidance, will not find it difficult to attain the highest stage, thus fulfilling our Master's intention to universally save all beings. Each chapter repeatedly admonishes and urges with heartfelt earnestness. When it records faults of friends, it is not to conceal them, but because all men share the same faults; in comparing, they should reflect and amend themselves. When it records the virtues of friends, it is not for self-glorification, but because all men can become so; by looking back, they may cherish and advance themselves. Moreover, this "Sayings" speaks of all things and comprehends all. For those who treat life, it reveals its vital points; for those who examine nature, it shows what to hold and preserve; for those who discuss cause and effect and retribution, it teaches to value the inner rather than the outer, to cultivate virtue and practise benevolence. Its benefit in human hearts and customs is not slight. Yet, as many disciples come at various times, and their questions are often the same, the answers sometimes contain repeated expressions. Readers should apprehend the meaning, not be confined to its words, so as to gain benefit for body and mind; if one dwell on the calligraphy and phrases, one will miss the mark far.

Some say: "This book lays bare the secrets of Heaven; it should not be lightly transmitted." Do they not know that what is peeled to the utmost recovers; what is exhausted to the end returns? This is the common course of the vital force; there is nothing strange in it. Moreover, if the teachings be not made clear now, when the cycle turns to the Upper Epoch, who will be the sages to uphold the line of the Way? We, who compiled the "Sayings," do so not for gain, but because we must. We earnestly hope that those who succeed will jointly elucidate the Great Way of the three teachings, so as not to disappoint our Master's intention of complete deliverance by the Golden Needle. Now that the book is completed and made public to all future generations, all should prize it, and not neglect it because it is easily obtained. Thus is the preface.

### Preface One

I once had in my box a "Digest of the Record of Lectures in the Hall of Joyous Nurture," which I regarded as an ordinary work for exhorting the world, and did not give it much attention at first. When there was a request to print and circulate it, I consented to wait for a future time to collate and examine it, and so I left it aside indifferently. In the summer of the year Ren-shen, Master Liu Yunting returned from Shu, bringing the original two volumes and again asked me to examine and verify them; I was not diligent in this matter. Later, when I arrived at the Hall of Virtue, I saw Master Qu Yuechuan had a copy on his desk and told me "It is very excellent." I casually turned over it, and its first volume on the Way of Yang Life pleased me greatly. It says: "The Way of Yang Life is nothing other than coming without thought or care. It is like a chaste maiden or a loyal widow, who resolutely remain unmoved, and if once they encounter evil, they would rather give up life than forsake righteousness. It is like a loyal minister or a brave man, who follow righteousness only, and if disaster befalls them without warning, they are willing to sacrifice their lives for the cause. This is true Yang Life. Otherwise, how can one be so unyielding after countless trials? From this we perceive that in daily use and conduct, all good deeds and righteous acts, performed justly and appropriately, are not without feelings of joy and encouragement; these are all signs of Yang Life. Or when reading books and reciting poems, one suddenly casts away all selfish desires, and only the spirit remains; this is also a manifestation of Yang Life. Or when friends gather and converse with mutual understanding and joy, suddenly Yang Qi rises and the true mechanism bursts forth; this too is a mode of Yang Life. Furthermore, in music, chess, calligraphy, painting, fishing, woodcutting, farming, and reading, if one can truly follow their nature, act according to Heaven’s nature, having no desire or craving, one will always be at ease and content, forgetting cares; these are all images of Yang Life. The essential point is to be immediately aware in action, and immediately collect oneself in awareness, so that the spirit has no external longing and the Qi remains abundant and graceful; then the elixir is not difficult to grow, and the embryo-baby need not fear failing to thrive! Especially one must know that where there is Yang there is life, and where there is no Yang there is death." From this insight, one understands that Yang is the Way, and the Way is the void and natural. Zi Si said, "The Way is not to be separated from for an instant." This is the very meaning of collecting and restraining Yang light so that no particle is permitted to leak. The sages have profound insight, and so I have shown it as pervasive in heaven and earth, eternal and present, the true primordial Yang existing everywhere at all times. If this were shown to beginners, it would cause them to have no way to enter the gate," and so forth. What is said is truly penetrating the source of the Way, unlike the petty family disputes, the reliance on grammatical punctuation, or mere hearsay; it is especially not something dreamed up by those who have not received the Master's transmission. I then read the rest and found each point to be the Way; I lament that I met it so late. Moreover, I heard Sun Haibo say: "My Master the Ancient Elder said this book speaks too plainly of skill, and should not be widely transmitted." Its value is thus roughly known. Therefore, having completed the collation and examination of the last chapter, I met with Master Liu and discussed its contents. Master Liu then contributed a sum of money to engage the hand-copyists, and asked me to write this preface, specially recording the cause and condition thus.

I have heard that in former times great virtuous men, in seeking the Way and their Masters, often gave up family wealth, abandoned wives and children, bore their books for thousands of li, travelled for decades without meeting; and if meeting, had to endure severe hardship and torment. And what was transmitted was but a word or two, which when deeply remembered, seemed to reveal all. Those who attain the ten thousand parts are so; and the hundred and ten thousand also; thus is the difficulty in seeking the Way, hearing the Way, and practising the Way. But it may be otherwise: there is no need for reverence, no need for distant seeking, no need for hardship, no need for long waiting, no need to kneel and call oneself disciple. Yet the Masters who attain the Way will lay bare their lifelong efforts and supreme secrets, write them down in books, and place them in the hands of men; and these men may then place them on high shelves, or measure their value by the smallest hair, refusing to purchase, thus losing them; or, valuing them cheaply, look through them hastily and miss them face to face, many times. Therefore what is easy to get is easily lost; what is long established is long secure. The ancients said: "This matter is most profound and wonderful; I fear your blessings are slight and hard to consume," and again, "Without cause there is no effect; it must needs be so." With the world’s tendency to believe the false and not the true, to see the small and forget the great, I cannot help but speak. Furthermore, I have heard: a chicken, when eating, will peck three or five grains to satisfy its hunger and be content, but if given more, will scatter food all over the ground; a monkey seizes millet, empties the fields of men, yet its armpit only holds one or two grains. The failure of students of the Way to avoid greed is like this. How much wisdom and energy do men have today? How great their worldly business? A hundred years pass like a blink, old age follows, and intellect is succeeded by senility. Each formula and method can bring success. The haste should be toward that which is urgent; choose one good thing and keep to it simply, practising with care. The fire begins to burn and the spring to flow; when expanded and filled, the use is unmeasurable. Let there be no imitation of chickens and monkeys in taking much without measure. This is my slight intention in introducing this book to its readers. Thus is the preface.

### Preface Two

I have always delighted in printing good books. As far as my strength allowed, whether alone or assisting others, I was resolved to complete it before feeling satisfaction. For ten years, I have strayed into the Buddhist gate, with the times in disorder, and have always felt ashamed of my mediocrity and lack of achievement. Moreover, the Master's grace is vast, his support abundant; my heart is eager to repay it, and cannot restrain itself. Seeing my fellow workers labour for many years with little success, and true good teachers being hard to find; when questions and doubts arise, I am unable to answer and treat the sickness to the heart, though I try to satisfy reason. Hence I sigh with regret, and many falter midway. It is like those who care for farming, who know how to sow seed, but not hoe weeds; how can one expect shoots to flourish and produce grain? In the year Ren-shen, by chance I obtained a book called "Record of Lectures in the Hall of Joyous Nurture," and briefly looked into its words on the Way, not fully discerning its purity and faults. I questioned Guo Yuan, a layman, who examined and declared it orthodox. I thus entrusted it to my fellows to distribute. As to the contents of the book, readers may know for themselves; and as Guo Yuan’s preface has slightly revealed, I now add this.

Summer of year Gui-you, Liu Changnian Yunting’s Preface

Postscript to the Reprint of the "Record of Lectures in the Hall of Joyous Nurture"

The "Record of Lectures in the Hall of Joyous Nurture" consists of four volumes, recorded by the disciples of Master Huang Yuanji. The Master was born in the Yuan dynasty; the "Collected Works of Zhang Sanfeng" recount his lineage, and his name is included therein. This book was completed in the Dao Xian years, counting nearly a thousand years, yet he still gathered disciples to teach, being what may be called one who leaves a form and remains in the world. The world declines, the Way grows faint, the human heart sinks and is immersed; without clarifying the study of nature and life, there is no way to awaken the masses. In ancient times, books on the Way, such as the "Can Tong" and the "Wu Zhen," are written in an abstruse style, difficult for men to comprehend. Other books borrow terms like lead and mercury, water and fire, and other metaphors; readers enter a five-li mist and know not its meaning. To find writings that are clear and simple, profound and manifest, with a sequence for practice that can be followed, is nowhere to be seen. This book speaks plainly and reasoningly, freely manifesting the mysterious spirit; it is truly a ladder and a vessel of the study of nature, a ferry to the sect of life. Teng Jian formerly obtained an old copy, incomplete and defective. In the year Wu-wu he came to visit and borrowed one to view at Kang Qianli’s place. Fearing that this treasure of the world might be lost through age, he conferred with fellow students and carefully collated it, dividing into editions and widely printing it, to make it public to the world. Future readers who earnestly seek will surely not find mere idle words.
