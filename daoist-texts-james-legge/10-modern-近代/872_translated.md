# Notes of Qingyang: Do Not Seek Human Enfeoffment, Accumulate Virtue and Speak Many Good Words

In this world,  
there are many mysteries,  
and these mysteries,  
in the experience and transmission of the ancients,  
are called the taboos of speech.  
Man as a being  
is not merely a kind of animal;  
any animal that desires to become a man  
must cultivate for at least five hundred years.

But man, from birth,  
already possesses five hundred years’ worth of the Tao beyond animals;  
therefore, why is it that among the weasels, snakes, and foxes of the world,  
after they have cultivated and attained the Way,  
they all desire to receive the “enfeoffment” from men,  
to have men say they are “like men” or “like immortals”?  
This is because they have cultivated for five hundred years,  
so as to be equal in the Tao to a newly born infant.

Yet the Tao of man is also subject to consumption;  
men are born with many supernatural powers,  
but because of vain thoughts and desires,  
these original powers are obstructed.  
Moreover, as men pursue desire and fame and profit,  
their Tao is dissipated along with these;  
when a man dies, his Tao is exhausted,  
he cannot remain as man, and becomes a ghost.  
(Those who cultivate will foresee the time in advance,  
and ascend to a higher realm.)  
As for the weasel, fox, and snake,  
these animals do not seek enfeoffment from men at random,  
but specially choose those of great virtue,  
of good character, of high moral repute, to seek their enfeoffment.  
For example, the snake hopes men will enfeoff it to become a dragon ascending to heaven;  
the fox, the weasel, the hedgehog,  
hope men will enfeoff them as immortals, attaining the Way and becoming human.

As for those street ruffians and petty scoundrels,  
they also know well,  
that if they seek enfeoffment from those of low quality and no cultivation,  
they are likely to be struck dead with a single blow,  
and be roasted with sauce for eating.

In a previous article,  
I have mentioned,  
that in the Daoist worldview,  
all animals of this world  
are divided into five classes of insects,  
namely: scales, hair, feathers, naked skin, and shells.

The king of the scaled insects is the dragon,  
all animals clad with scales are scaled insects.  
The king of the feathered insects is the phoenix,  
all animals with feathers are feathered insects.  
The king of the hairy insects is the qilin,  
all animals with long hair are hairy insects.  
The king of the shelled insects is Xuanwu,  
all animals with shells are shelled insects.  
The king of the naked insects is man,  
all animals with naked skin are naked insects.

Among these five classes,  
the most formidable is man,  
especially the king of men on the Chinese land.  
The ancient Daoists  
always believed that every seven hundred years on the Chinese land,  
a Polaris Ziwei star  
would manifest in the world as the king of men,  
and this king of men possessed the power to enfeoff gods.

Therefore, in ancient times, one may observe,  
that in times of flourishing,  
many Daoists appeared (all to assist and protect the sage),  
and emperors would decree the enfeoffment of many immortals.

Most notable is the Tang dynasty,  
when Li Shimin enfeoffed the twenty-four meritorious officials of Lingyan Pavilion,  
the underworld judge Zhong Kui,  
the door gods Qin Qiong and Yuchi Jingde,  
the martial guardian of the capital city, the city gods, and others.  
After these immortals were enfeoffed by emperors of extraordinary origin,  
the common people burned incense and prayed to them,  
and thus received real protection.

(Even Li Shimin himself)

In former times, even the Celestial Masters of Taoism  
required enfeoffment from the king of men;  
and the Taoist adepts of the folk who had attained cultivation and the Way,  
even if praised by the common folk,  
still needed to be enfeoffed as perfected beings by the king of men,  
or recommended as Immortal Ministers by the Celestial Master’s office.

Only thus could they obtain exalted immortal rank in the Dharma realm,  
completing the final step of merit and virtue as earth immortals, human immortals, and ghost immortals,  
apart from the celestial immortals and the great golden immortals,  
who do not require imperial enfeoffment.

The above illustrates that man is born endowed with Dharma power,  
and thus the curses of men generate energy.  
As it was said in the past, “pointed at by a thousand men, yet die without illness,”  
then why do many old couples curse each other a lifetime without harm,  
while some couples curse a few times and suffer ill consequences?  
The core reason is a great disparity in bearing;  
the one with high bearing, when cursing one of low bearing, the curse takes effect;  
but the one of low bearing, cursing one of high bearing,  
either the curse is ineffective, or himself is backfired upon.  
Many sorcerers and witchcraft curses are strong,  
but when facing invaders,  
or distinguished figures like Genghis Khan,  
such curses have no effect.

Everyone has their own fortune;  
if a man’s fortune is good and his luck prosperous,  
no curse can affect him;  
as the saying goes, “For three years a man flourishes; gods and ghosts dare not meddle.”  
But once his fortune declines, and luck departs,  
those with bearing and energy superior to his, cursing him,  
the curse will come true.

Hence, why many families curse each other in vain,  
why many curse their children to no effect:  
it is only because the bearing and energy fields are balanced,  
and the child’s energy and bearing exceeds the parents’,  
thus the curse is ineffective.

Conversely,  
if a man’s luck is originally poor,  
and his family not only does not encourage him but curses him,  
and there is frequent crying and lamentation at home, inviting the crying spirits,  
and the kitchen god and door gods dislike households of lamentation,  
then when an external ghost enters the dwelling, with the added curse,  
the curse will soon be fulfilled, causing disaster.  
In life, choosing a partner is very important;  
good heart, good speech, good deeds, abundant virtue.  
Narrow heart, constant weeping, extreme conduct, bring endless family calamities.  
Whether between husband and wife, or parents and children,  
one’s words must be especially cautious, avoiding speech of curses,  
lest the forbidden ghosts and gods of heaven and earth be stirred,  
and calamity befall, grievous and heavy.  
The ancestors have also told the world,  
to think before speaking and acting,  
when encountering another speaking of a matter,  
one must analyse how best to respond.  
Think clearly before speaking.

Master Zhou once told me a story:  
When tallying work points and eating communal meals, he had a neighbour who thrice a day encountered two snakes entwined,  
which among the folk was a most inauspicious omen, portending death.

But he was lucky, for the first person he met was a famed Daoist,  
to whom he related this matter, and the Daoist replied:

“To meet three snakes in one day is rare and precious; a common man in several lifetimes cannot meet this. Surely soon you shall prosper and have increase in offspring.”

Indeed, after one year, the man had a grandson, and some unexpected wealth.

I then asked Master Zhou, “Sir, such a thing is a great evil omen; how comes the Daoist said it would be good?”

Master replied, “This is called enfeoffment; the Daoist knew he was to have an event, but we Daoists are judges and officials of the celestial bureau,  
our words command fate; to say good is good, to say bad is bad.  
Thus this Daoist enfeoffed him safe, and so he was safe, even gaining good fortune.”

I asked, “Is this like in the Investiture of the Gods, when Bi Gan’s heart was removed, he asked the seller of empty-heart vegetables if a vegetable without heart could live, and whether a man without heart could live likewise?”

Master Zhou answered, “Yes, for Bi Gan was himself guided by immortals to seek an enfeoffment,  
and if the person he met said that a man without heart could live, then by gaining this word of enfeoffment, he could live.”

I found this matter wondrous; while contemplating, Master Zhou continued:

“I have a nephew, a pig butcher; once I joked with him,  
because his father was my adopted godson, I told him to come and kowtow to me, else he could not kill pigs.  
I thought it a jest. Two years later I met him again and asked how his pig-killing business fared; he said:

‘After you said I could not kill pigs, my business went ill. When the knife entered, no blood flowed, and the pigs ran wild. Several customers had this happen, and now no one invites me to kill pigs.’

I then enfeoffed him, saying, ‘Now, when you kill a pig, the knife touches and it dies,’ and thereafter his pig-killing went smoothly.  
This is enfeoffment; especially the enfeoffment by a Daoist master or an elder of great virtue, the power is extraordinary.”

Master Zhou further said, “In folk custom, moving house is in three steps: first installing the stove, second the bed, third the opening of the wealth gate,  
and the day of feasting is the day of opening the wealth gate.

At the opening of the wealth gate, one invites a person skilled in the rites to converse. The door is closed; those inside and outside ask and answer, with auspicious words,  
for example, the interior asks: ‘Who are you?’  
The exterior replies: ‘I am the Three Stars of Fortune, Prosperity, and Longevity.’  
The interior asks: ‘What have you brought?’  
The exterior answers: ‘Much, gold and silver, treasures, abundant offspring, wealth and honour, success and many descendants all come together…’

After the exchange, the interior bids, ‘Enter quickly!’

Master Zhou continued, “But if at opening the wealth gate, someone inside asks ‘Who are you?’  
and the outsider jokingly replies, ‘I am the god of poverty, the star of disaster,’  
then after moving in, the household will suffer misfortune, perhaps even calamity; this also is the power of enfeoffment.”

I asked thoughtfully, “Then the wedding disturbances nowadays, making the groom wear a watermelon helmet, rags, tying him up and beating him, is this not also a kind of bad enfeoffment?”

Master Zhou answered, “Yes, therefore when my grandson marries, I hold a bamboo stick beside me; if anyone dares to disturb, I strike him.  
I do not allow these disorderly acts on joyous occasions.”

Master Zhou said again, “In former times at the raising of the main beam, all would shout, signifying the family rising.  
If someone of dull wit said the house would surely fall, the family would suffer misfortune on moving in;  
such a person must be driven away, and a new day chosen for raising the beam.  
Such a person is called the most detested ‘mischief-maker’ in the village, a ‘biting-egg man’.”

Master Zhou further said, “In former times, weddings were held in the courtyard; guests brought gifts and money, and loudly uttered auspicious words and blessings.  
The bride and groom would reply, ‘Thank you for your golden words!’  
This was to gain auspicious words and blessing upon the couple’s life. Such customs are now abolished.”

Master Zhou said, “For us who learn the Dharma, the words of our masters are especially precious.  
Once a man learning the Dharma asked his master, who was aged and near death, repeatedly:  
‘What if my methods fail?’  
The master repeatedly assured him, ‘They will surely work.’  
Yet the man’s mind was weak, and he persisted in asking, ‘What if they do not work?’  
The master said, ‘So long as you come to my grave and burn incense, they will surely work.’  
After this the master passed away.  
From then on, the man had to burn incense at his master’s grave when performing any ritual, else it would not work.  
This was because of his weak mind, and was an enfeoffment by his master.”

Master Zhou further said, “Often we meet those of weak mind who do not understand this principle, nor how to respond, thus bringing themselves many troubles.  
For example, when we perform rituals, we tell others, ‘After this ritual, all evil will disperse, demons will not invade, calamities will be averted, life prolonged, blessings eternal.’  
If the other is wise, he will respond, ‘Thank you, sir, your golden words will surely come to pass!’  
After such a response, his fortune will slowly change.  
But the ignorant, if he replies, ‘What if I still have bad luck afterwards?’  
Once he utters these words, the ancestors and masters will not protect him, and he will indeed have bad luck, even worse.  
Some reply, ‘Is this ritual really effective? Can I truly change my fortune? Or will I become worse?’  
If such doubt exists, he will surely have misfortune, because he cannot respond correctly.”

I reflected and found that some businessmen I know, especially Fujianese and Chaoshan people, are very adept at responding,  
and such people in business and affairs are polite and understand rules well.  
But many believers in the North, where Daoist culture and folk traditions have long faded,  
do not understand this principle, and often speak in startling ways that make people laugh or cry.

Once a Daoist friend sought Master Tian for exorcism, and Master Tian said to her, “After the exorcism, you will surely be well; just go home and say no more.”  
Yet when she left, she said, “Thank you, I will come back to see you soon.”  
Master Tian clapped his head, knowing trouble; indeed, not long after, she relapsed and returned for another exorcism.

Master Tian told me:  
“When we go out to work for others, the greatest taboo is when the host says ‘Come back to visit when you have time,’  
if he says this, soon another death will occur in that family.  
The same applies to exorcisms; if the client says this as we leave, their misfortune will relapse, and the spirits sent away will return.  
No effort will avail.”

I asked, “What should they say, then?”

Master Tian said, “Simply say, ‘Sir, walk slowly.’ No other pleasantries are needed.”

I learnt from masters and lords about these taboos, and realised the power of words far exceeds our scientific understanding of the world.

Therefore I write this to inform all, to pay heed to the words spoken daily.  
Speak many auspicious words, speak few curses,  
seek pleasing speech, speak many lucky words.  
Do not offend those of high virtue and great respect,  
those who truly cultivate the Way and command the arts,  
lest you incur enfeoffment, and harm your own fortune.

When I was young, my father told me, “Respect the elders, especially those unassuming old men by the roadside;  
do not think them easy to offend, lest you incur enfeoffment, which is most serious.”  
At that time I did not understand, and asked, “What is enfeoffment?”  
My father said, “Some old men seem plain and ordinary, but some are craftsmen, some are Daoists, some are upright men who do good and accumulate virtue.  
If you inadvertently offend them, and meet one of ill temper, he may enfeoff you with a few words, and you may not bear it.”

I did not believe this then, feeling that in my atheistic thinking, such superstition was too strange.  
Only later, when I began to study Daoist methods and spent time with various old masters, hearing many stories of enfeoffment,  
did I realise this is true and extremely efficacious.

Daoist Zhang Zhishun once related his own experience:  
One day while meditating, a bird outside chirped noisily and disturbed him; he felt annoyance,  
and the bird fell dead.  
Hence Zhang Zhishun warned his disciples, “Those who cultivate the Way must not lightly harbor evil thoughts.”

In the lineage of the Northern Emperor’s laws, within the Tai Xuan Hei Lu scripture, there is this passage:  

> All judges receiving order from the Northern Emperor, appointed to the Tai Xuan, attend the Emperor with the True Warrior Saint Lord; their authority is heavy.  
> Demonic kings often fear and respect them; ghost officials accompany.  
> Whenever going in or out, city gods and community officers escort and send; no words of human or ghost joy or anger may be uttered rashly;  
> yin-yang divine officials must observe judges’ joy or anger without command.  
> Should this be violated, demonic kings will not fear, ghost officials disregard, and in affairs lose sanctity, surely being insulted by evil ghosts.  
>  
> Note: Once Zhu True Lord gathered friends, his heart angered at one who did not speak;  
> he thought: “Such a man who does not believe in Daoist laws may be killed.”  
> That man could not sit still, and on returning vomited blood and died.  
> Thus it is known that judges granted Fengdu laws have demon kings as protectors; in thought and intention, demons act without orders.

This tells of a True Lord surnamed Zhu, who received the Northern Emperor’s law lineage.  
When he gathered friends, he harbored hatred in his heart but said nothing;  
he thought, “The world has such unbelievers of the Way, they may be killed.”  
That person immediately fainted and later died bleeding.  
Hence the scripture notes that judges invested with Fengdu laws have demon kings guarding;  
at the moment of thought, demons act without orders.

Thus judges must not lightly speak of human or ghost emotions, nor casually judge good or evil.

Such passages, to many now, seem mere records, but this custom and tradition still widely prevail in Guizhou’s Taoism.  
When Master Zhou taught me the Eight Characters and Feng Shui, he said:  

“No matter how bad one’s Eight Characters, if you are a judge, you may not lightly say he will have great misfortune or death;  
you may only gently explain and say it can be resolved, all will be well, no need to worry.  
For you are a judge; if you say he will have misfortune, then he surely will.”

Master Zhou also said, “In Feng Shui, whether for the dwelling or the grave, one must not lightly say the place harms or injures, only say it is good.  
Only after leaving may one privately discuss the true merits or faults.  
For you are a judge; when you speak, the earth veins, dragon gods, and earth officials are all listening;  
if you say it will harm, though it has not yet, soon it will; this damages one’s yin virtue, good intentions bring harm.  
Hence Daoists must be cautious in speech, and not utter nonsense that injures one’s virtue.”

Later I heard my godfather say that when Master He of the Xuanhuang Shamanism was young and impatient,  
once local people forgot to invite him to a meal, and then a dozen people had stomachaches and clamoured,  
asking if he had been offended by some evil direction.  
Master He jokingly asked, “Did you forget there was one more person to eat?”  
When they recalled and apologized, Master He smiled and said into the void, “All right, come back,” and all recovered.

I asked my godfather, “What kind of method is this?”  
He said, “It is no method, it is the power of the shaman’s troops; once you have the transmission of this military power, your thought alone dispatches them.”

Once your grandfather went to buy oranges, thought them expensive, and casually said, “These oranges are so dear, I doubt they will sell.”  
Then no one bought all day, though many looked; this is the power of thought and enfeoffment; ordinary people cannot endure it.  
So your grandfather told me Daoists must not speak recklessly, but always say good and bless others.”

Thus I recall my father’s words in childhood as most profound and incredible.

This article also warns all to cherish respect for the old and love for the young, for you can never understand by scientific eyes:  

“Three days after you kick an old man, three days later you are run over and break a leg.”

Such seemingly lawless occurrences…  
And some young people, with too much anger, offend those elderly of high cultivation,  
or provoke their patience to the limit, and receive enfeoffment words:  
“You child, you have gone too far; I fear you will not live long.”  
Perhaps with these few careless words, the young man’s future is cut off.
