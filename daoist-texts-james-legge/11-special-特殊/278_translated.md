# Scripture of the Northern Dipper: Method of Cultivation in Accordance with the Law

The Scripture of the Northern Dipper, whose full title is the Supreme Mysterious Spirit Northern Dipper Scripture of Life-Extension, is one of the Four Grades of Scriptures, together with the Daily Morning Recitation, the Daily Evening Recitation, and the Scripture of the Three Officials. The Supreme One once descended to the Capital of Shu; the Earthly Deity ascended to the Jade Bureau Seat; Patriarch Celestial Master received the Scripture of the Northern Dipper, thereby obtaining the Key to Liberation from Suffering. The nature, life, and five parts of the human body are all under the governance of the Star Lords of one's Original Fate. The Original Fate Deity-General and the Star Lords of the Original Mansion constantly bestow their shade and protection, preside over human life, and secure the years granted by Heaven.

The Northern Dipper dwells in the midst of Heaven as the pivot of the cosmos, regulating the four seasons, governing Heaven and Earth, the sun and moon, the five planets and constellations, the Heavenly Stem and Earthly Branch, the twenty-eight lunar mansions, and all the assembly of true immortals. All living beings under Heaven— their lifespans, fortunes, poverty and wealth, birth and death, misfortune and blessing, affairs of the netherworld—are all under the supreme command of the Northern Dipper. If man with sincerity opens his prayers and knocks thereon, he will assuredly receive a response.

The Scripture of the Northern Dipper is the path to enter the Tao and cultivate the True, the crucial rite for offering homage to the Dipper for life-extension, the technique to resolve calamities and dispel disasters, the critical key to revive life and raise the dead. After enumerating various calamities, the Supreme One desires that men cultivate according to the Law; then, without hindrance from any calamity, they shall naturally ascend to the True and attain the Way.

For the first cultivators of the True Way, and good men and faithful women, if they sincerely set their hearts on the day of the descent of the Seven Primordial Lords, and according to the prescribed method perform the incantation, recite the Scripture, burn the talisman, and present the memorial, then the power and miraculous transformations of the Seven Primordial Lords, the great saints, and the myriad spirits of wondrous enlightenment will be displayed. The Scripture of the Nine Emperors declares:

If there be a benevolent person who prays for blessings and desires to behold the manifestation of the Seven Primordial Golden Immortal Great Saints, he must first sweep away dusty thoughts, purify the source of his heart, reverently bow the body and lower the head, close the eyes in quiet contemplation. At the moment when the heavenly music floats in the air, the golden visage will appear, the golden body will be revealed, resembling the image of the goddess Ma Gu, or the Lady of the First Heaven. The breath of the female heroes is compassionate and universal in saving all beings. Once the Seven Primordial Lords ascend and descend in the central courtyard, all malevolent spirits will retreat, and a hundred blessings will come as if they were concurrent.

If one wishes to dispel calamities and atone for sins, to release difficulties and resolve troubles, to make humble offerings to the Dipper, all desires will be fulfilled, thereby rescuing sentient beings from their bitter states of suffering. According to the Scripture of the Northern Dipper, the great saintly Seven Primordial Lords of the Northern Dipper can resolve the three calamities, the four disasters, the five elements calamity, the six harms calamity, the seven injuries calamity, the eight difficulties calamity, the nine stars calamity, the calamities of husband and wife, of men and women, the calamity of birth, the recurring calamities, epidemics, diseases, spirits of evil, calamities of tigers and wolves, insects and snakes, robbers and thieves, shackles and rods, violent death, curses and oaths, the heavenly net, the earthly snare, sword and arms, water and fire, and all such misfortunes.

The Scripture of the Twenty-Eight Chapters of the Northern Dipper says:
If one sets the heart to pay homage to the Primordial, reveres the rites of our Dipper, that person will enjoy endless provisions and longevity, will not behold sword and arm or evil deeds, nor all suffering and afflictions; will be granted eleven thousand eight hundred merits, always guarded by the Good Stars; his dwelling will be guarded by all the Dragon Spirits, also granted thirty-two thousand merits, eighty-eight thousand ranks of fortune, surpassing the realm of ghosts, and will be born into the upper heavenly city and palace, enjoying the delight of humans and heavens, and will be transferred to the rank of the True Lords of the Star Officials.

Speaking of the Scripture of the Northern Dipper, all praise its elegant diction, resembling the style of the Han and Tang dynasties in its regulated rhythm. Speaking of the extant Five Classics, Six Books, the various schools of the hundred philosophers, and Buddhist scriptures and canon, if they were not composed, whence would they arise? Moreover, Confucian writings from ancient times to the present have been endlessly annotated and compiled, yet never completed; how much more so the Taoist classics!

The Scripture of the Northern Dipper, as one of the Four Grades of Scriptures recited daily in Taoism, fulfills all prayers for blessing and removal of disasters without fail. The preface to the Scripture of the Northern Dipper states: Its revilings are clearly spoken of; those destined to fall into the six paths, who lose human form, are deeply sorrowful, bringing upon themselves such suffering.

Though the Scripture of the Northern Dipper is the scripture of life-extension imparted by the Supreme Old Lord to Patriarch Celestial Master Zhang Dao Ling, the “Supreme” in the title does not refer to the Supreme Old Lord himself, but indicates the dignity and rarity of the Scripture. Of course, to understand it as the Old Lord is not incorrect; yet the sacred words proclaimed by the Old Lord cannot be comprehended without insight into the meaning of the Scripture, and so the Supreme Sacred Instruction cannot be truly apprehended.

The Mysterious Spirit (Xuan Ling) is the Taoist Mysterious Spirit method. According to the Scripture of Dou Mu’s Life-Extension, the Primordial Lady of the Dipper, by cultivating the marvelous Dao of Mysterious Spirit, diligently serving the Primordial Lord of Heaven and constantly making the utmost vows, nourishing the true spirit, refining the essence and soul, the vital breath is intensely gathered, the breath enters the profound mystery, and moves in harmony with the spiritual wind; the result is the attainment of the marvelous Dao of Mysterious Spirit. The Mysterious Spirit confounds the ears, eyes, nose, mouth, body, and mind. In reality, the Mysterious Spirit is the Three Corpses God. The specific practice may be referred to in the prior explanation of the Scripture of Gaining Heaven and the Way.

By serving the Northern Dipper and practicing the Mysterious Spirit Scripture and formula, one may ascend to the Nine Heavens of the Dipper. The Nine Heavens of the Dipper are as follows: Tan Lang dwells in the Spirit Flower Heaven; Ju Men dwells in the Spirit Brightness Palace; Lu Cun dwells in the Profound Yellow Heaven; Wen Qu dwells in the Splendid Yellow Heaven; Lian Zhen dwells in the Primordial Sovereign Heaven; Wu Qu dwells in the Central Yellow Heaven; Po Jun dwells in the True Sovereign Heaven; Fu Xing dwells in the Great Constant Heaven; Bi Xing dwells in the Transforming Spirit Heaven.

This is also the reason that recitation of the Scripture of the Northern Dipper is selected on days such as Jiazi and Gengshen, when the Three Corpses Gods are most potent. Taoism generally holds rites of exorcism and reporting to the Dipper on the third and twenty-seventh days of each lunar month, as well as on the days of Jiazi and Gengshen.

The Northern Dipper, that is, the Seven Primordial Lords and Nine Emperors of the Northern Dipper. The Original Fate refers to the Original Fate Star Lords or Star Officials. The Northern Dipper is the spirit of the Nine Heavens, the soul of the Nine Earths, the wondrous image of the Nine Stars, the mighty deity of the Nine Provinces. The Original Fate descends to the human realm six times each year to survey the sins and blessings of men. This was briefly analysed in the introduction to the Original Fate Primordial Spirit; for more understanding see the later annotations.

Life-extension means the removal from the record of death. Taoism holds that the Southern Dipper registers birth and the Northern Dipper records death. Briefly, the Southern Dipper governs the registry of life of all beings, hence its name appears in Taoist registers for ascending to Heaven. The Northern Dipper governs the records of death. Thus, in Taoist ceremonies for blessings, the name of the Northern Dipper often appears. In other words, if one recites the Scripture of the Northern Dipper, one naturally gains life-extension and relief from calamities.

True Scripture is the path to cultivate the True. Similarly, the Three Vital Breaths of the Mysterious and Primordial: the Mysterious is born of Earth, the Primordial born of Man, the Beginning born of Heaven. Man follows Earth, Earth follows Heaven, Heaven follows the Tao, Tao follows what is natural. Man follows Earth, therefore called Mysterious. Man is the spirit among myriad things, therefore called Spirit. The Tao produces One; One produces Two; Two produces Three; Three produces Nine.

The Three Vital Breaths are the highest in Heaven and Earth; the Nine Vital Breaths are the roots of all things. The Northern Dipper dwells in the central Heaven, governing the Nine Vital Breaths, the unity of Nine and One is the Taoist succession in Mysterious One. The Mysterious is born of Earth and follows Man, hence called the Original Fate of the Northern Dipper. Man obtains his life, dividing into one breath; from breath is born; issuing from Mysterious One; having sprung from his breath, he must know its root, again guard Mysterious One, to extend his life.

The Scripture of the Northern Dipper is the scripture of life-extension taught by the Old Lord to the Celestial Master, to awaken the lower disciples to return to their true Way, to return to the root and know their fate. Should one be sick or in hardship, in childbirth or disaster, seeking progeny or continuation, or to preserve and extend life, it is urgent to be sincere and settled in thought, to recognize the Original Fate Star Lord, to hold this formula, to recite this Scripture, to burn this talisman; then the household will be pure and tranquil, and calamities will be overcome within the appointed time and peace attained. Its root and foundation all arise from the Tao.

The Scripture of the Northern Dipper states: To know the body, nature, and life is all dependent upon Tao for birth. Realizing this cause, one prolongs the human path of life. The seed does not perish; from generation to generation men are born; they do not enter the land without Tao; the root of man is not broken; one may repair the heart and correct the Way, gradually entering the immortal sect, forever leaving the cycle of rebirth, transcending and attaining the Way.

The Old Lord reveals to the Celestial Master the miraculous method, to save the people of Heaven, to return to the True and know their fate. On the day of the Original Fate, one may fast and hold offerings, open prayers to the Northern Dipper, the Three Officials, the Five Emperors, the Nine Palaces and Four Departments, to recommend blessings and dispel disasters, to present memorials earnestly, to offer sincere rites, various kinds of incense and flowers, the five fresh fruits of the season, all in accordance with the customs of the world, in pure and tranquil altars, to harmonize Heaven and simulate Earth, whether in temples or in the household, building merits according to ability and requesting the performance of rites, the merits of which are profound and weighty.

The Original Fate Day: Many think it is the day pillar of birth, but usually the year pillar of birth is taken as the Original Fate Day. For example, if one is born in the year Jiazi, month Bingzi, day Wuzi, then his Original Fate Day is Jiazi day; Wuzi day is considered the birth day.

The Northern Dipper is the Seven Primordial Lords and Nine Emperors of the Northern Dipper. The Three Officials are the Great Emperors of Heaven, Earth, and Water. The Five Emperors are the Five Old Emperors of the Five Directions—Azure, Yellow, Red, White, and Black. The Nine Palaces are the examinations of the Three Officials' Nine Palaces. The Four Departments are the Department of Life, Department of Fortune, Department of Danger, and Department of Fault. The Seven Primordial Lords, Nine Emperors, Three Officials, Nine Palaces, and Five Old Emperors are generally well understood.

The Three Officials and Five Emperors record their merits. The Nine Palaces and Four Departments inspect diligence. If one is not yet ready in the Way, the forms of prostration and obeisance are difficult to perfect; actions before and after are not in accord with the ritual; one is censured by the Four Departments and held to account by the Five Emperors. The Three Officials rectify errors; the Four Departments supervise faults.

The Scripture of the True Primordial Path to Immortality states: Heaven has stars of the Four Departments between the Void and Danger, beside the human stars, to govern man. The Department of Life has two stars, which determine a person's merits and demerits, lifespan, reward and punishment. The Department of Fortune has two stars, which govern one's rank and provisions. The Department of Danger has two stars, which govern one's exile or irregularities. The Department of Fault has two stars, which govern one's errors, confusion, and selfishness.

To pay homage to the Northern Dipper chiefly requires establishing the Dipper Altar, opening prayers to the Northern Dipper, the Three Officials, the Five Emperors, the Nine Palaces and Four Departments, to recommend blessings and dispel disasters. The Scripture of the Northern Dipper directs: various incense and flowers, the five fresh fruits of the season, in accordance with worldly customs, pure and clean altars, to imitate Heaven and resemble Earth, whether in temples or households, building merits according to ability.

### Ten Taboos in Establishing the Dipper Altar

To establish the Dipper Altar requires enshrining the sacred seats of the Three Terraces, Seven Primordial Lords, Nine Emperors, and so on; offering incense, flowers, water, fruit, and lamps; making rice talismans for fasting and offering rites; presenting memorials and earnest prayers; sincerely offering rites and requesting the conduct of rituals. When establishing the altar, generally ten taboos are observed, which practitioners should heed.

1. First Taboo: Sandalwood  
The female Azure Heaven Law forbids burning sandalwood; violators incur the ancestral punishment of Fengdu.  
This matter is not light; take heed; to burn it is to invite the calamity of illness and disaster in succession.

2. Second Taboo: Flowers  
All flowers may be offered to the gods in Heaven; but among rose branches is a prohibition.  
This is because untimely and gaudy displays are forbidden, as noted in the Records of Responses from the Mystical Book.

3. Third Taboo: Wu Day  
On a Wu day, the celestial law forbids harsh words; the swallow does not carry mud; the snake does not crawl.  
To violate this brings disaster through the four seasons; the Queen Mother once showed this to the Han ruler.

4. Fourth Taboo: Water  
Water offered should be drawn from wells or springs; waters from river banks may be polluted or overflow.  
Please see the phrases in the Scripture of the Blood Lake to believe the heavenly gods have revealed this.

5. Fifth Taboo: Fruit  
All kinds of fruit, whether dry or fresh, have prohibitions; the pomegranate is forbidden to be offered to the Profound Heaven.  
Plums should not be offered to the Supreme One; black dates are absolutely forbidden before the True Spirits.

6. Sixth Taboo: Food  
Heaven detests three kinds of wildfowl—wild goose, pigeon, and dove—and black carp, loach, turtle, dog, pig, and sheep.  
Forbidden are two kinds of garlic and herbs—onion, coriander, and chives; thunder sternly warns and widely spreads this.

7. Seventh Taboo: Persons  
Pregnant women and monks should not approach to observe; mourning clothes, chickens, and dogs are forbidden near the altar.  
Impure clothing, alcohol, and flesh offerings are forbidden; the supervising Dipper generals will not tolerate disrespect.

8. Eighth Taboo: Place  
Do not approach graves or impure houses; do not go near delivery rooms or abandoned shrines.  
The evil qi hides corpses and coffins; such places are not auspicious.

9. Ninth Taboo: Lamps  
A frame of sacred lamps is placed to set the stars; shining brilliantly to assist heavenly brightness.  
The original fate flame must not be extinguished; auspicious or ominous, blessing or calamity, reports to the lord.

10. Tenth Taboo: Vegetables  
Vegetables such as melon, eggplant, vegetables made of gluten are taboo; filth and feces pollute their origin.  
Impure firewood as food is forbidden by heavenly law; how can such be offered to the Star Gods?

To establish a Dipper Altar in accordance with the law and ritual, after paying homage to the Dipper one may assess the degree of fulfillment of the rite. If one wishes to establish an altar, it is recommended to consult a nearby Taoist temple. Generally, Taoist temples hold rites of homage to the True and reports to the Dipper, and proximity to the altar may afford study and reference.

### Establishing the Dipper Altar

When reciting the Scripture of the Northern Dipper, one may choose days of the Dipper (the third and twenty-seventh of each lunar month, Jiazi and Gengshen days), Original Fate Day, birth day, days of the Northern Dipper’s descent, etc. As aforementioned, establishing the altar requires enshrining sacred seats, various incense and flowers, five fresh fruits, and so forth.

When establishing the altar, sandalwood incense must not be burned; roses must not be offered; melon and eggplant are forbidden; monks, nuns, and pregnant women must not approach; on Wu days homage to the Dipper is forbidden; forbidden are the Three Detested and Five Flesh foods; the Original Fate lamp must be lit; impure places must be avoided.

As the Scripture of the Northern Dipper states: in accordance with the customs of the world, pure and clean altars, imitating Heaven and Earth, whether in temples or households. If the ritual is not observed, one is censured by the Four Departments, held to account by the Five Emperors, and examined by the Three Officials.

The above altar arrangement diagram is taken from the Great Yellow Register of Fasting. From the diagram, it is not difficult to see that usually the altar enshrines the sacred images or tablets of the Primordial Lady of the Dipper and the Northern and Southern Dipper Star Lords. Sometimes only the Primordial Lady and the Seven Primordial Lords and Nine Emperors are enshrined. Sometimes the Seven Primordial Lords, Nine Emperors, and Three Terraces are enshrined. Different lineages vary slightly.

Regarding altar offerings, generally there are three cups each of tea, wine, and jujube broth; seven varieties each of vegetables (excluding eggplant), steamed dishes, and fruit (excluding melon). In addition, a pair of flower vases (excluding roses), a pair of candles (red candles recommended), a censer, incense holders, powder boxes, and chopstick bottles are all required.

When establishing the altar, the method of imitating Heaven and resembling Earth is often adopted in making rice diagrams, also called rice talismans. Usually these include the Purple Star Secret, two Dippers and three Terraces lamps, dragon and phoenix auspicious images, rank and horse support, Original Fate Primordial Spirit, fortune and destiny accord, and other parts or entire patterns; then lamps are lit and the scripture recited. Generally, different dates for altar establishment may have variations. For example, the yin-yang days differ slightly in altar arrangements.

Within the altar, besides the ritual implements held by the priests and the instruments of musicians, there are generally the Dipper instruments. Nowadays, the Dipper typically includes five ritual implements—sword, ruler, mirror, scales, and scissors—and flags of the five directions. After homage to the Dipper, often the Dipper is turned, symbolizing the turning of stars and changes of fortune.

The offering of memorials and petitions is one of the main modes by which Taoist practitioners communicate with the divine. By storing thoughts of heavenly grace and favour, writing with brush and ink on paper, and burning in the Divine Register, the memorials ascend to the celestial court. Various kinds exist, such as memorials, petitions, notices, petitions for pardon, notes, documents, and passes.

They are letters of ordinary devotees to the immortals, like correspondence with immortals. If a cultivator is proficient, he may, through contemplation and meditation, directly ascend to Heaven, akin to voice messages in modern communication. Some cultivators may raise Heaven and Earth, follow the laws of Yin and Yang, to directly fulfill the wishes of devotees.

Memorials and petitions are letters of communication between devotees and the immortal ancestors, often kept in tubes. They generally include the petitioner’s name, birth date and time, current residence, the matter requested, the immortal palace and title, etc. In Taoist fasting and offering ceremonies, petitions are submitted for blessings in this form.

The memorials of the Seven Primordial Lords and Nine Emperors of the Northern Dipper usually petition the altar’s True Tranquil Earth God, the Officer of the Direct Talisman of Merit, the two Messengers of Zhang and Xie for resolving calamities at the Dipper, the two Messengers Qing Yang and Tuo Luo for resolving calamities at the Dipper, etc. Different sects and lineages summon different official generals. Some sects or lineages also summon officials, generals, officers, and soldiers to deliver memorials.

Regarding the use of Northern Dipper memorials, different sects and lineages have varying customs. The most common are petitions. Petitions, compared to memorials, are more casual and without strict requirements. Hence many temples use petitions when paying homage to the Dipper. Here, by way of example, a petition for longevity is briefly introduced:

![](/media/202305/2023-05-09_162906_1757030.31092712459763905.png)

It is worth mentioning that many lineages precede the submission of the Nine Emperors’ petition by first submitting petitions (or notes, petitions) to the Department of Life, morning homage to the Three Officials, noon homage to the Blue Luo, evening homage to the Dipper. Petitions are comparatively casual and will not be detailed here.

The Scripture of the Northern Dipper mentions memorials and petitions. Taoism extensively uses various memorials and petitions, such as the Life-Extension Feather Petition and the Golden Mysterious Feather Petition. The Life-Extension Feather Petition is easier to use; the Golden Mysterious Feather Petition is more complex. Different Star Lords use different talismans.

Different lineages and temples may differ. The author, when paying homage to the Dipper, usually pays homage to the Palace, that is, the Forty-Nine Homages to the Original Fate Palace. Hence, devotees attending the homage often have relatively high efficacy. Here is shared the header of a Life-Extension Feather Petition:

### The Thirty-Six Resolutions of Deliverance and Life-Extension of the Northern Dipper

Speaking of the Thirty-Six Resolutions, many know of the Thirty-Six Resolutions of Thunder and the Thirty-Six Gates of Exorcism. In truth, the Northern Dipper also has Thirty-Six Resolutions. The Thirty Mysterious Resolutions of the Northern Dipper are often written into petitions, distributed under the command of the Plague Marshal for implementation. Regarding memorials and petitions, this brief introduction is for reference only; it is advised to follow individual lineage.

We have briefly analysed the altar establishment, talisman drawing, and memorial submission in the recitation of the Scripture of the Northern Dipper. But where are these written memorials and petitions sent by the altar’s True Tranquil Earth God, the Officer of the Direct Talisman of Merit, the Calamity-Resolving Messengers of the Dipper, and the Thunder Officials?

In fact, different sects often send memorials and petitions to different palaces in Heaven, to pray for the resolution of related calamities. Even the same deities may have memorials sent to different palaces. Here are some common palaces (for reference only; specific practice should follow lineage; novices should not rashly select):

### Sacred Titles of the Nine Emperors  
The Supreme Great Saint Northern Dipper Nine Emperors, generally use palaces such as the Northern Dipper Xuanji Palace, Ziwei Xuanji Yingling Palace, Xuanji Yingling Palace, Xuanji Huangyao Heavenly Palace, Northern Dipper Nine Emperors Palace, etc.

### Sacred Titles of the Seven Primordial Lords  
The Supreme Great Saint Northern Dipper Seven Primordial Life-Extension Star Lords generally also use the Northern Dipper Xuanji Palace.

### Names of the Reporting Dipper Officials  
The Purple Extreme Zhaochong Merit Commander Heavenly Hero Great Star Lord, also called Northern Dipper First Yangming Tan Lang Great Star Lord, generally uses palaces such as Northern Dipper Yanqiong Palace, Tianyuan Palace, Supreme Palace, etc.  
The Purple Extreme Bright and Wise Collection Splendid Heavenly Ren Yuan Star Lord, also called Northern Dipper Second Yin Jing Ju Men Yuan Star Lord, generally uses palaces such as Northern Dipper Yiqiong Palace, Diyuan Palace, Zhongyuan Palace, etc.  
The Purple Extreme Penetrating Profound Shifting Heavenly Pillar True Star Lord, also called Northern Dipper Third True Man Lu Cun Zhen Star Lord, generally uses palaces such as Northern Dipper Yaoqiong Palace, Riyuan Palace, Zhenyuan Palace, etc.  
The Purple Extreme Total Receiving Talisman Allowing Heavenly Heart Knot Star Lord, also called Northern Dipper Fourth Profound Dark Wen Qu Knot Star Lord, generally uses palaces such as Northern Dipper Mengqiong Palace, Yueyuan Palace, Knot You Palace, etc.  
The Purple Extreme Executive Celebration Strong Yu Heavenly Bird Gang Star Lord, also called Northern Dipper Fifth Dan Yuan Lian Zhen Gang Star Lord, generally uses palaces such as Northern Dipper Liqiong Palace, Jiangyuan Palace, Gangshen Palace, etc.  
The Purple Extreme Ancestral Beneficial Central Capital Heavenly Auxiliary Ji Star Lord, also called Northern Dipper Sixth North Pole Wu Qu Ji Star Lord, generally uses palaces such as Northern Dipper Yingqiong Palace, Heyuan Palace, Jingyang Palace, etc.  
The Purple Extreme Condensed Splendid Good Transformation Heavenly Chong Guan Star Lord, also called Northern Dipper Seventh Heavenly Guan Po Jun Guan Star Lord, generally uses palaces such as Northern Dipper Fangqiong Palace, Haiyuan Palace, Guan Hui Palace, etc.  
The Purple Extreme Yang Comprehensive Fu Celebration Heavenly Rui Auxiliary Star Lord, also called Northern Dipper Ninth Hidden Light Nei Bi Star Lord, generally uses palaces such as Northern Dipper Xuanqiong Palace, Di Zuo Palace, Di Du Palace, etc.  
The Purple Extreme Yin Attack Great Yan Heavenly Peng Bi Star Lord, also called Northern Dipper Eighth Penetrating Bright Outer Auxiliary Star Lord, generally uses palaces such as Northern Dipper Wei Qiong Palace, Shang Zun Palace, etc.

### Other Dipper Deities  
Dipper Pivot Upper Minister True Lord generally uses palaces such as Mysterious Spirit Dipper Mansion, Mysterious Spirit Inner Mansion.  
Dipper Center Upper Minister True Lord generally uses palaces such as Xuanji Jade Mansion, Xuanji Outer Mansion.  
Heavenly Pivot Upper Minister True Lord generally uses palaces such as North Pole Dipper Pivot Mysterious Spirit Mansion.

The above are only some of the palaces for homage and report to the True Dipper. Taoism often uses the twelve characters “Tao far, when shall it reach; road distant, when shall one return home” as the sacred title and uses Yellow and Black Tao in wording the petitions. Some lineages differ slightly.

Memorial tubes (or called petition tubes) also differ greatly. Some use the above palaces; some do not need them; some write other palaces and other contents, such as the specific ranks and offices, the names and titles of officials receiving the petitions, etc. For reference only.

### Are the Nine Emperors and Seven Primordial Lords Male or Female in Appearance?

Many images of the Northern Dipper’s Nine Emperors and Seven Primordial Lords depict some as male, some as female. The Scripture of the Nine Emperors states the Nine Emperors are the sacred sons born of Dou Mu; the Scripture of the Northern Dipper also calls them Lords.

The Nine Emperors and Seven Primordial Lords are originally formed of the Prenatal, the Dipper Truth being the Prenatal Dao Body, having no form of Yin or Yang, male or female. The Great Way originally has no form; the utmost truth has no shape. In truth, Taoist contemplations and visualizations are generally of female form. The Northern Dipper belongs to Water and Yin; hence it is generally believed that devotees of the Northern Dipper Seven Primordial Lords envision female forms.

Taoist scriptures and methods about the Northern Dipper are many, involving sleep techniques, boxing methods, refining and nourishing, contemplation, and so forth. Due to limited space here, one method of reclining Dipper contemplation is introduced for reference. For example, contemplating the chief covering head, pointing with the Gang finger forward. Or contemplating the Northern Dipper Nine Emperors governing the Primordial Sovereign True Breath to harmonize with the body.

The Precious Edict, also called Edict Chapters or True Edicts, originally meant the sacred commands delivered by immortals; later mostly referring to ornate eulogistic texts praising deities, a special literary style unique to Taoism. Precious Edicts all begin with “With utmost sincerity, I turn to the Way and pay homage” and end with the deities’ sacred titles, recording numerous doctrines and methods of cultivation.

In Taoist rites of fasting or scripture recitation, priests connect the mortal and the sacred, keeping the gods in mind and visualization, using Precious Edicts and Sacred Truth to communicate and convey messages. The content of Precious Edicts is very broad, mainly praising the celestial deities’ sacred chronicles and narrating the cultivation and attainment of the ancestors.

When reciting the Scripture of the Northern Dipper, burning talismans, holding incantations, and submitting petitions, we commonly recite some Precious Edicts and Divine Incantations related to the stars and Dipper. For example, the Nine Emperors Precious Edict, Northern Dipper Divine Incantation, Dou Mu Heart Incantation, etc. Here, we do not detail them, but share several common star Dipper True Edicts for beginners’ reference.
