# General Proclamation of the Arrayed Stars

With a devoted heart, I bow and take refuge in reverent homage.  
Lo, the lofty, perfect canopy—vast and boundless, the Great Net unfolds.  
Above the North Pole shines the Purple Tenuity,  
Within its inner seat dwells Gouchen in solemn stillness.  

The Sun Emperor and Moon Sovereign,  
Set the measure of dawn and dusk with unerring precision.  
The Southern Star and Northern Dipper,  
Govern life and death with impartial hands.  

The Five Planets stand arrayed in radiant procession,  
The Four Luminaries shine with clear distinction.  
Two Emperors concealed upon Heaven’s steps,  
Three Enclosures bow before the imperial throne.  

The cycle divides into the Twenty-Eight Mansions,  
Altogether forming the Thirty-Two Heavens.  
The Three Terraces accompany the Dipper’s pivot,  
While the Celestial Gang commands the Thunder Gate.  

The Twelve Palaces of the celestial bodies,  
Turn upon the wheel of Heaven’s endless course.  
The sixty Jiazi cycles,  
Mark the stars’ ceaseless revolutions.  

Fate’s master is assigned to its domain,  
Born from the womb, inseparable from the primordial star.  
Bright stars and dim lights,  
Illuminate the paths beside and beyond.  

The Jade Palace strings pearls in symbolic array,  
The Purple Mist joins jade disks without pause.  
The Purple Tenuity stands in solemn dignity,  
Tracing the path along the Yellow Way.  

Countless forms of the myriad phenomena,  
The constellations and clustered stars in grand assembly.  
Masters of the Golden Well and Jade Balance,  
True stewards of the Milky Way and Azure River.  

The primal life star and original destiny,  
Govern fortune, limit, and swift horse of fate.  
Throughout the celestial circuit’s passage,  
The arrayed stars and star lords keep their watch.
