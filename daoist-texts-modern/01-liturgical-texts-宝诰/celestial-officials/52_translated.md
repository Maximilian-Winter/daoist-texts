# Precious Edict of the Mysterious Patriarch of the Purple Mansion

With devoted heart, I turn and bow in reverent homage.  
In the Southern Palace, the Purple Mansion stands—  
the unsurpassed dao beyond all bounds.  
It unfolds the mysterious ultimate,  
the utmost truth that never decays.  

From true emptiness and primordial origin,  
the numinous source of ancestral kalpas,  
arises the wondrous dao of void and non-being,  
whose subtle workings are endlessly profound.  

The very root of all immortals and sages,  
whose divine mechanisms no mind can fathom—  
he who holds the dao, the law, the sacred teaching,  
most numinous and responsive,  
most holy and compassionate,  
whose virtue spreads without measure.  

Through boundless kalpas, he saves the world,  
sets order amid chaos, and unfolds the dharma.  
He is the Benevolent Holy Matron,  
the Great Heavenly Venerable,  
Mysterious Patriarch of the Purple Mansion in the Nine Heavens.
