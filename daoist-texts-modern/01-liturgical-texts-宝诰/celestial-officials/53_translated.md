# Precious Edict of Fuxi

With devoted heart, I bow and take refuge in reverence.  
Lo, the Vast Heaven’s cavernous realm, the Ancient Sovereign Husband.  
Perfectly harmonized is the fruit of the dao, the mysterious pivot of creation.  
He who establishes order and upholds rites, striking the changes to become a shaman.  

The law endures through a thousand autumns, pure and clear in hue,  
New transmissions refresh ten thousand generations, moistening the tender sprouts.  
The Five Phases, Four Symbols, and Two Modes bear witness,  
The Eight Trigrams, Nine Palaces, and Supreme Ultimate chart the cosmic design.  

Yin and yang govern fortune and misfortune; sun, moon, and stars inspire awe.  
No man, no breath—must there be earth, must there be I.  
Opening mountains and unveiling teachings, establishing sages and proclaiming the scholars.  

Dispelling the sea of suffering, calamities, and tribulations,  
Turning the wheel of mortal dust, bestowing blessings and auspicious arts.  
Broadly reaching divine powers, illuminating kindness and grace,  
For all the multitudes now spreading the rosy talisman.  

Great compassion, great vow; great sage, great mercy.  
Heaven-opening Most Holy, Ancient Sovereign Emperor,  
Infinite Holy Kings, Emperor Fuxi,  
Perfect Fuxi who governs the world, Heavenly Venerable.
