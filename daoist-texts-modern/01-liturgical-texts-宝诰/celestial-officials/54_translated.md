# Precious Edict of the Empress Nüwa

With a heart of utmost devotion, I bow and take refuge in reverence. She gathered earth’s clay and shaped humanity, bringing forth myriad creatures into being;  
She ordained the rites of marriage, ensuring the flourishing of humankind;  
She fashioned the reed pipes and flutes, delighting all living beings with music.  

By refining the five-colored stones with the supreme dao-methods, she mended the heavens;  
Breaking off the divine tortoise’s legs, she propped up the four corners of the world;  
She calmed the raging floods and slew the fierce beasts;  
She generously bestowed grace and favor upon all living creatures.  

Great Sage of great compassion, boundless mercy and vast vows,  
Ancestor of mankind’s root and source, entrusted by the Heavenly Old Mother—  
The Empress Nüwa, the Sacred Mother, Heavenly Venerable.
