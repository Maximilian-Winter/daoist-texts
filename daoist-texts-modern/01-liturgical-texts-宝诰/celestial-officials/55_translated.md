# The Precious Edict of Xuanyuan

With utmost sincerity, I bow and take refuge in reverence.  
The Sovereign of the Era, Emperor of Origins,  
Whose seat is established in the Mysterious Capital,  
Radiates a perfect and wondrous fruit,  
From which myriad offspring are transformed and nurtured.  

He governs the three teachings—Confucianism, Daoism, and Buddhism—in their rightful measure,  
Holding sway over Heaven and Earth, Humanity, myriad phenomena, and the stars’ talismans.  
He commands and inspects the offices of gods, immortals, and Buddhas,  
Scrutinizing the registers of truth and falsehood alike.  

Mountains and rivers answer his governance,  
Wild lands are divided and apportioned;  
Provinces, counties, prefectures, and cities  
Are administered with timely order and governance.  

Through ten thousand ages, his legacy flows like sun and moon,  
For a thousand autumns, he continues the lineage, upholding the Tang and Yu.  
Yellow pathways of meridians and channels,  
The Classic of Plain Questions and the Spiritual Pivot,  
Are illuminated by his lofty brilliance,  
The origin of vigor, like the crafting of the hanging gourd.  

Scholars gather at court to create anew,  
Guiding with compass and script, with carriage and boat.  
His功 (merit) parallels the rain and dew,  
His德 (virtue) nourishes and moistens all alike.  

He makes manifest good and evil,  
Registers ranks for reward and punishment.  
He repairs yin and yang, stabilizes the altars and lands,  
Dispels calamities and tribulations, ferrying mortal beings across.  

Great compassion, great vow,  
Great sage, great mercy.  
In the high vault of the Jade Palace,  
Within the academy of culture and transformation,  
Xuanyuan, the Yellow Emperor,  
The Heavenly Venerable who opens the era and governs the world.
