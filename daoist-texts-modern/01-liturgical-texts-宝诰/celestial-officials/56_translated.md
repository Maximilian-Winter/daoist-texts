# The Precious Edict of Shennong

With heartfelt reverence, I bow and surrender my life in homage.  
He who governs the Nine Grains,  
Who opens the myriad valleys’ bounty.  
With strength he upholds the root and source,  
His charge entrusted to the fields and furrows.  

In times of peace, the waters and soils abide,  
Diligent in effort, he assists Heaven’s will.  
Overseeing the seedlings and the growing crops,  
His merit joins the primordial Creator’s work.  

Bestowing grace upon all living beings,  
His virtue praises the numinous Heaven.  
The Lord of Agriculture extends his favor,  
Delivering aid to the ten thousand peoples.  

The world’s foundation, the source of all wealth,  
Thrives in the sacred fields and fertile lands.  
We gaze upward at the sprouting grains, so pure and fair,  
The sowing and reaping seek wise counsel for good fruition.  

All depends upon the farmer’s toil and the blessings bestowed,  
The great work of creation climbs toward abundance.  
Through the joy granted by the harvest, free from suffering,  
The ripened fields rescue the multitudes below.  

With boundless compassion and vast vows,  
Great Sage, Great Compassionate One—  
The ancestral Lord of the Hundred Grains, Shennong the Great Emperor,  
Who opened the sacred mountains and unfolded profound mysteries, the Heavenly Venerable.
