# The Precious Edict of the Primordial Sovereign of Heaven

With a devoted heart, I turn to bow and submit my life in reverent homage.  
Amidst the pure and subtle heights of Heaven, within the gathering beneath the jeweled canopy,  
There arose at the dawn of the vast kalpa of life,  
A steadfast aid to the transformations of the Jade Clarity.  

By receiving the primordial qi as essence,  
And mastering the divine incantations in the numinous capital,  
The celestial script, a single zhang in measure,  
Has endured countless kalpas of cosmic cycles without decay;  

The cloud-like seals of the five directions,  
Placed amid the turbid to bring ever greater clarity.  
Secrets revealed and concealed,  
The source flows with talismanic signs and seals.  

Great compassion and great vow,  
Great sage and great mercyâ€”  
The natural transcendent,  
The Primordial Sovereign of Heaven.
