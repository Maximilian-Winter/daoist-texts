# General Edict of the Five Sacred Peaks

With devoted heart and bowed head, I pay homage and surrender my life.  
Lords of myriad mountains, sovereigns of the ancestral realms,  
The blue, yellow, red, white, and black each govern their heavens;  
East, west, south, north, and center, all officials attend their lands.  

Great Birth, Vast Birth, and Containing Birth—  
All beings depend upon their shelter and protection.  
Divine responses and resonant echoes answer in kind,  
None dare to overstep the bounds of their expansion and contraction.  

Seven, nine, five, and three breaths of qi converge,  
Unified within the One Primordial Origin.  
Countless officials, by the hundreds of millions,  
All fall under the stewardship of the Five Sacred Peaks.  

The rites of Feng and Shan endure through countless generations,  
Their jurisdiction recorded within the Jade Clarity.  
Great Compassion, Great Vow,  
Great Sage, Great Mercy—  

The Five Sacred Peaks, famed mountains and great emperors,  
Their potent numinosity shines resplendent, honored as Heavenly Venerables.
