# Precious Edict of the Eastern Peak

With utmost reverence, I bow and surrender my heart and life.  
Lo, the august Patriarch of Profound Radiance,  
The venerable Ancestor of the Golden Wheel that perpetuates the sea’s vastness.  

She, the Immortal Mother, dreamt and from her dream was born the light of the sun;  
The Sacred Sage of the Purple Mansion, younger brother of the Eastern Blossom.  

In ancient times, he forged his merit upon Changbai’s heights,  
And first received his investiture from the Sovereign Fuxi.  

At first called the Perfected of Grand Splendor,  
Marshal of the Primordial Mountain of Mount Tai in the Han,  
In the Tang, revered as the Holy Emperor who gathers profound grace,  
In the sacred court, decreed as the Supreme Lord by imperial edict.  

His station guards the Earthly Pillar,  
His功 (merit) matches the Heaven’s creation.  

With benevolence, he wields virtue’s kindness,  
Turning yang energy like a palm within his hand;  

With a holy heart, he augments holiness,  
Adorning the sun and moon amidst the heavens.  

The Five Great Mountains acclaim him in the East,  
The Three Realms exalt him alone in the central sphere.  

He gazes upward, abiding in the Great Dao,  
He looks downward, scrutinizing the Yin Courts.  

He holds the power over human good and evil,  
Grasps the scepter of life and death across the world.  

He chastises the wicked, dividing the courts into thirty-six offices,  
Oversees fortune and misfortune, adjudicating in seventy-two tribunals.  

Those who do good are inscribed for birth in the heavenly realms,  
Those who sink into delusion hear his call for salvation.  

He reveals the visage of the Compassionate Lord,  
Opening the gate of transformation for all beings.  

His blessings equal Heaven’s vastness,  
His功 (merit) is boundless and immeasurable.  

Great compassion, great vow,  
Great sage, great mercy.  

Supreme in the central sphere,  
Holy Emperor of the Eastern Peak,  
His merciful light rescues from suffering,  
His awe-inspiring power reigns as the Sovereign Venerable of Heaven.
