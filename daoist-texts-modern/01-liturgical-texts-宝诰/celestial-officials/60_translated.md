# Precious Edict of the Western Peak

With a devoted heart, I bow and take refuge in reverence.  
The wondrous realm of the Western Splendor, the supreme heavenly palace.  
Receiving the true transmission from the Jade Pool, unfolding the treasured register of the Jade Emperor.  
Soaring forth to attain the dao, thus sensing the completion of the Golden Elixir.  
Confirming the fruit of the golden stem, one then ascends Mount Hua.  
Rescuing calamities and aiding the afflicted, responding to things and to persons.  
Wherever there is aspiration, life is extended and blessings increased.  
Great compassion, great vow; great sage, great mercy.  
Overseeing the calculation of lifespan, the Western Peakâ€™s Golden Heaven.  
Great benefit and obedience to the holy emperor, utterly without void or limit.  
Commander of the Brahman true lords, the Heavenly Venerable who records the reckonings of the Floral Forest.
