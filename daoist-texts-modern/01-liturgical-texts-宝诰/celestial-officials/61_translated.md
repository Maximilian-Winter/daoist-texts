# Precious Edict of the Southern Peak

With devoted heart, I turn my life over in reverent homage.  
The Sacred Ancestor of the Southern Heng,  
Illumining the lofty expanse of the high Heavens.  

He rises, girded by a ring of emerald mountains,  
Stirring the sun’s radiance in the dark of night.  
He measures the suffering of mortals,  
Layer upon layer, he lays down the bridge of ascending steps;  
He reaches out to the lost and bewildered,  
Like the long hair of distant stars in the constellation of the Dipper.  

In the shadowed depths, the luminous awaken,  
Near and far, all hearts return home.  
He carves away the thin veil of death, rewriting the scroll of life,  
Erasing the roots of sin to enter the register of blessings.  

Looking upward to this presence,  
With awe and longing, one follows at once.  
Great compassion, great vow—  
Great Sage, great mercy.  

He holds the records of fortune, rank, and longevity,  
The Southern Peak’s Sovereign of Heaven’s transformations, the Illustrious Sacred Emperor.  
Piercing the vast emptiness,  
He presides as the True Lord of the celestial bureau,  
Receiving the alchemical forge to be reborn as Heavenly Venerable.
