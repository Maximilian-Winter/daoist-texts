# Treasure Proclamation of the Northern Peak

With devoted heart, I bow and take refuge in reverence. The Northern direction’s Great Ultimate, the primordial One and Original Numinous Spirit. It guards the steadfast summit of Gen Earth, bestowed with the Jade Emperor’s exalted favor. The solitary cavern of the north holds but a single root of ethereal breath. Encircled by the mountains of the Nine Nether Regions, it pairs in perfect harmony with the Southern Peak. Beneath the sun’s descent, as the cycle of Gui and Zi begins anew. Great Spirit, Great Response, rescuer in calamity and deliverer in disaster. Keeper of the Elixir Terrace, the Northern Peak secures Heaven’s order. The Great Sage Emperor of True Origin, the Vast and Boundless Supreme Heaven, the Registrar True Lord, the Most High and Utterly Victorious Heavenly Venerable.
