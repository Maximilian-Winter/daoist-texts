# Precious Edict of the Great Emperor of the Central Peak

With heartfelt devotion, I turn my mind and bow in reverent homage.  
The Venerable Sovereign of the Central Heaven, before whom the Four Great Mountains pay celestial homage.  
He establishes the vital channels of the Five Directions,  
breathing life into the countless beings of eternal antiquity.  

His root pierces the summit of Earth’s embrace,  
his essence pure and numinous as the white stem of the sacred stalk.  
He quells the calamity stars that threaten the eight corners,  
bestowing blessings and fortune upon the four pillars of the world.  

Great in compassion, vast in holiness,  
boundless in vow and immeasurable in mercy,  
he governs the five soils, the Central Peak, the Central Heaven—  
the Great Tranquility, the Exalted Holy Emperor.  

In the boundless expanse of the Grand Void,  
he commands the True Lord of Reckoning,  
the Sovereign of the Yellow Heaven at the cosmic center.
