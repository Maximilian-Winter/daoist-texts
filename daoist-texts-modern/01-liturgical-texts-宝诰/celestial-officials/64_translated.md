# Precious Edict of the Azure Haze

With a heart steadfast and reverent, I bow and submit my vow.  
Upon the summit of Mount Tai, within the inner palace of the Eastern Peak,  
In ages past, she appeared as the Jade Maiden,  
Her root essence none other than the true substance of the Emperor.  

She bears the Nine Breath Energies and extends compassion to reveal her form,  
Wearing the crown of myriad spirits, her wisdom is perfectly harmonious.  
Her journey spans the Ten Directions, her功 (merit) encompassing countless kalpas.  

Her station is enshrined under the title of Heavenly Immortal,  
Her rank proclaimed as the Azure Haze Sovereign.  
She commands the divine troops of the mountain prefecture,  
Holding sway over the good and evil among humankind.  

She patrols the sounds of supplication and swiftly responds to their call,  
Protecting the nation and securing the peace of the people.  
Great Sage and Great Compassion, utmost filial piety and benevolence—  
Heavenly Immortal Jade Maiden, vast in numinous grace and kindness.  

Humbly obedient and universally aiding,  
Preserver of life, the Perfected One.  
Guardian of the realm, shelter of the people,  
The Virtuous Azure Haze Primordial Sovereign.
