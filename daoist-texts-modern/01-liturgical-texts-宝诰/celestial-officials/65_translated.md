# Precious Edict of the Venerable Old Mother of Lishan

With utmost sincerity, I bow and take refuge in reverence.  
Sovereign of myriad spirits and master of teachings,  
Who unfolds the dao in all directions, radiant and profound.  

Within the cavernous mysteries of Lishan’s grotto,  
Lies the secret scripture of immortal realization—  
A path whispered by mouth, the law-gang’s universal illumination,  
A wondrous ladder of numinous grace.  

The dao stands lofty, the immortal registry deep and vast;  
She is counted among the ancient immortals of the upper eight caverns.  
Each word opens the orifices of insight,  
The Supreme Emperor’s Yin Talisman Scripture revealed.  

The Jade Palace’s gates swing wide,  
Convenient portals for the wise to enter.  
Philosophers unravel the Three Pure Ones’ six sacred texts,  
And the Primordial Law of the cosmic talisman arts.  

The profound mysteries of the Nine Cauldrons and the elixir scriptures,  
Passed down mouth to mouth, secret and sublime.  
Wise discourse on the Nine Immortals,  
Cultivating the numinous dao of genuine truth.  

Seventy-two transformations,  
The wondrous numinous dharma body.  
Assisting the heavenly path,  
Driving away demons and binding malevolent spirits.  

Rescuing all sentient beings,  
Protecting the court and guarding the realm.  
Bringing peace to the land, joy to labor, and harmony to all,  
Her supreme virtue shines universally.  

I take refuge in the Sovereign of myriad spirits and master of teachings,  
The great teacher of vast virtue and boundless grace.  
Of great compassion and great vow,  
The great sage and great mercy.  

The Numinous Treasure Heavenly Master,  
Where golden light blazes forth.  
Greatly bestowing the law’s decrees,  
Like the radiance of sun and moon.  

The Jade Seal Guardian of the Realm,  
The Honored Primordial Sovereign of Virtue,  
The Great Compassionate Venerable Old Mother of Lishan.
