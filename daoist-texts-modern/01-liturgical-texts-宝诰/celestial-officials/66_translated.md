# Precious Proclamation of the Compassionate Navigator, the Perfected One

With heartfelt devotion, I take refuge and bow in reverence.  
Before the sacred Mount Putuo, upon the southern shore of the vast Southern Sea,  
Where myriad transformations unfold in endless succession,  
And the boundless merit of answering cries for salvation is widely sought—  
Mastering the samadhi and the six penetrations,  
One attains the fruit of pure and natural clarity.  

Amidst the azure lotus bathed in dewy radiance,  
By the verdant willows thick with auspicious grace,  
The leaves celebrate the ancestral legacy,  
While the qilin’s footprints stir the embrace of the White-Robed Ones who escort souls.  

Bringing aid to beings and benefit to all things,  
The great favor shines forth like the brilliance of purple lightning,  
Transcending the five sufferings and liberating from rebirth’s cycle,  
Awakening through countless lives with profound compassion and vast vows.  

The Great Sage of boundless mercy, the Great Compassionate One—  
Avalokiteshvara, the Bodhisattva of Compassion,  
Lord of the Five Thunders’ sacred methods,  
The Yellow-Cloaked Heavenly Emperor of Zhuluo,  
And the Sovereign of Perfect Freedom and Universal Penetration.
