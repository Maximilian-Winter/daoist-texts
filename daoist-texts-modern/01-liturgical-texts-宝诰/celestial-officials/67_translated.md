# Precious Edict of Fengdu

With a heart devoted and reverent, I bow and take refuge.  
His station dwells within the Northern Mansion, his charge bound to the Nether Capital.  
He holds the seals of life and death, rewarding the good and punishing the wicked without fail.  
By authority he weighs deeds and faults, chastising the treacherous and praising the virtuous with perfect impartiality.  

He guards the shadowed mountains and rivers of the Northern Yin,  
And surveys the luminous realms within the central caverns.  
Majestic is his virtue and merit; both ghosts and spirits delight to turn to him in faith.  
Mighty is his numinous power; all people alike share in his beneficent grace.  

He governs fate and fortune, decrees birth and demise.  
The Ten Palaces universally bow their hearts to him,  
And the Six Caverns together raise their hands in homage.  

Great is his compassion and vast his vow,  
Most holy and infinitely kind.  

In the Earthly Court of the Northern Yin,  
The Mysterious Minister, Great Emperor of Fengdu,  
The Heavenly Venerable who lifts sins from the Nine Netherworlds.
