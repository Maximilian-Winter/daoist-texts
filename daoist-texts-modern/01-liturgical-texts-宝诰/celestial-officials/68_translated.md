# Declaration of the Sovereign of the Netherworld

With devoted heart, I bow and take refuge in reverence.  
East Peak’s Ardent Ruler, Northern Capital’s Feng Respondent,  
He who governs good and evil, who holds the reins of life and death.  
Righteousness stands majestic and unyielding, closely aligning with the cosmic law.  
His sacred heart burns bright and clear, forgetting both favor and grievance alike.  

Above hangs the mirror of sins, shining with unblinking light;  
Around swirl the shadowy forms of darkness, encircling without end.  
No tyrant’s might can break free from judgment’s grasp,  
Nor can cunning knaves evade the workings of justice.  
Blessings of virtue lead to the realms of Heaven,  
While distant fortunes sink deep into the abyss of Hell.  

Retribution is unmistakable, cause and effect plainly revealed.  
The Six Paths look upward with gratitude,  
The Four Lives lament their fateful plight.  
Great compassion, great vow,  
Great sage, great mercy.  

The Ten Kings of the Netherworld,  
The Compassionate and Benevolent True Sovereign,  
The Heavenly Venerable with heart of ice and face of iron.
