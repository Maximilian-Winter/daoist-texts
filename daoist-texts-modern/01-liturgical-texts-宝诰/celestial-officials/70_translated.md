## Commentary on the Precious Edict of the Ancestral Celestial Master

The Ancestral Celestial Master is the Celestial Master Zhang, also named Zhang Ling, styled Fuhan. A native of Fengyi in Pei State of the Eastern Han, eighth-generation descendant of Zhang Zifang, the Han Marquis of Liu. Born in the tenth year of Emperor Guangwu’s Jianwu era (thirty-four CE), before his birth his mother dreamt of the Chief Star descending, inspiring conception. Gifted from youth, at seven he mastered the *Dao De Jing* and the books of the River and Luo. Later he resigned office to cultivate the dao. At that time, the region of Bashu was rife with primitive shamanic worship, large-scale licentious rites harming the people. Sorcerers who served ghosts and demons gathered wealth through wickedness and crime. Celestial Master Zhang, with disciples Wang Chang and Zhao Sheng, pacified the demons and witches, slaying the sorcerers, and then founded the Orthodox Unity Oath dao, becoming the founding patriarch of Daoism’s earthly establishment. This precious edict belongs to the Orthodox Unity lineage of the Ancestral Celestial Master, distinct from the Quanzhen school.

### Supreme Mysterious Prime Minister, supporting the teaching of the Three Heavens.

“Supreme Mysterious” refers to the profound and arcane dao principles. “Prime Minister” is an honorific for the highest minister. “Supporting the teaching” means assisting Daoism. The “Three Heavens” are the Three Pure Ones’ heavens: the Heaven of Pure Subtlety, the Heaven of Yu’s Remnant, and the Great Red Heaven.

### On Crane-Cry Mountain, the true transmission was received; on the Mysterious Altar of the Dragon and Tiger, the wondrous secret was left behind.

The Most High Lord Lao descended on Crane-Cry Mountain, bestowing the Celestial Master title upon Zhang Ling. In the first year of Emperor Shun’s Yongshou era, the Ancestral Celestial Master established the Orthodox Unity Oath dao on Crane-Cry Mountain. The Master once built an altar and refined the elixir on Cloud Brocade Mountain; after three years the elixir was perfected and the Dragon and Tiger appeared, hence Cloud Brocade Mountain is also called Dragon and Tiger Mountain. The Mysterious Altar signifies the protective altar.

### The Three Caves’ talismanic registers, all varieties of numinous writings.

The Three Caves are *Cave of Truth*, *Cave of Mystery*, and *Cave of Spirit*. The talismanic registers are summons and spell documents for commanding spirits.

### One thousand two hundred officer spirits, upholding and supporting the orthodox teaching.

After receiving the scriptures from the Most High Lord Lao, the Ancestral Celestial Master daily deciphers secret texts, able to summon thirty-six thousand spirits and one thousand two hundred officer lords for command.

### Twenty-four grades of secret talismans, universally delivering future generations.

These are the *Twenty-Four Grades of the Orthodox Unity Oath Talismanic Registers* bestowed by the Most High Lord Lao.

### The capital功 jade seal, official robes and collective footwear.

These are the Three-Five capital功 jade seals and other ritual implements granted by the Most High Lord Lao. The official robes and footwear include the flat-topped crown, Eight Trigrams robe, square skirt, and vermilion shoes. These lines reveal the great responsibility of the Ancestral Celestial Master.

### Residing in the capital province, ever attending the Jade Emperor; governing the Three Realms and ferrying the common folk.

The capital province is a heavenly official rank. The Three Realms are Heaven, Earth, and the Human world. This phrase metaphorically describes the functions of the Ancestral Celestial Master.

### The twin swords, male and female, slay and sever demons and spirits.

Bringing rain or clearing skies, thunder roars and lightning flashes: the twin swords, male and female, were bestowed by the Most High Lord Lao. These words depict the high magical power of the Ancestral Celestial Master.

### Thus the altar is established and the transformation spread, aiding the nation to prosper and pacify the people.

This line metaphorically praises the great virtue of the Ancestral Celestial Master in establishing Daoist teaching and transforming the world.

###功 fulfilled and practice complete, ascending in broad daylight. The Patriarch supports the teaching of the Three Heavens.

In the first year of Emperor An’s reign (one hundred fifty-six CE), together with disciples Wang Chang and Zhao Sheng, and his wife Lady Yong, he ascended in broad daylight on Cloud Terrace Mountain. In the fourth year of Emperor Xizong’s Zhonghe era (eight hundred eighty-four CE), the Ancestral Celestial Master was conferred the title “Great Law Master Supporting the Teaching of the Three Heavens.”

### Assisting the profound embodiment of the dao, the Great Celestial Master. The Ancestral One of the Mysterious Cave, the manifest aid true lord.

“Supporting the teaching” means assisting Daoism. “Mysterious” signifies the dao. “Embodiment of the dao” refers to the process of cultivating the dao. In the Southern Song Emperor Lizong’s reign, he was further honored as “Great Law Master Assisting the Origin and Supporting the True Lord of the Orthodox One Mysterious Response.”

### Boundless are the Six Directions, the Illustrious Supreme Emperor, the Great Sage descending to vanquish demons and protect the dao, the Heavenly Venerable.

The Ming Emperor Chongzhen posthumously bestowed upon the Ancestral Celestial Master the title “Illustrious Supreme Emperor of Boundless Six Directions.” The Daoist world reveres him as the “Great Sage Descending to Vanquish Demons and Protect the Dao, the Heavenly Venerable.” The Six Directions refer to above and below, east, west, south, and north, encompassing the entire cosmos. “Vanquishing demons” means subduing malevolent spirits. “Protecting the dao” is guarding Daoism. “Heavenly Venerable” is an honorific for a perfected immortal.
