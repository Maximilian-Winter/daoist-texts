# Supreme Master’s Precious Edict

With utmost sincerity, I bow and take refuge, offering reverent homage.  
Upon the ancestral altar stands the utmost pinnacle,  
The dao lineage heart-to-heart conveyed.  
Pure and subtle, the Numinous Treasure and the Primordial Heaven,  
The Dao and Virtue, the undivided Origin, united with the Perfect Yi.  

The true wind stirs and surges,  
The flying body lashes and reins amid thunder and lightning.  
The wise eye shines ever bright,  
Gazing and guiding beneath sun and moon’s light.  

Mouth to mouth, the unsurpassed dao is handed down,  
Majestic and lofty, it uplifts the grand ancestral spirit.  
Proclaiming the dharma to guide the people,  
Serving as the teacher of the Ten Directions’ teachings.  

On Heaven’s behalf, it proclaims and transforms,  
Vastly opening the sects across the Four Seas.  
Universally aiding all beings,  
All rely upon the true and proper dao.  

Great compassion, great vow,  
Great sage, great mercy.  
In the Mysterious Hall, the teaching is revealed,  
The dao transmitted by the great ancestral masters,  
Flowing forth the myriad dharmas of the Heavenly Venerable.
