# Precious Edict of Immortal Master Ge

With wholehearted reverence, I bow and submit my vow.  
On Mount Tiantai, the Dao was attained,  
Uniting darkness and light to perfect the True.  
Long ago, receiving the grace of Eastern Splendor,  
Then passing it on to Western Shu once more.  

The Jade Capital and Golden Palace issue the imperial decree:  
His rank ascends among the Immortal Assemblies of the Supreme Ultimate.  
Compassionately he rescues those sunk in the abyss,  
His grace and care universally bestowed upon the suffering and the relieved alike.  

The ancient airs of the Celestial Clan Ge shine clearly through the cosmic mechanisms;  
Now the cinnabar elixir remains intact,  
Roaming freely beneath the vast vault of the azure heavens.  

At Mount Luofu he halts within the serene wilderness,  
In the Jade Chest he cultivates and arranges the golden scriptures.  

Great Compassion, Great Vow,  
Great Sage, Great Mercy,  
The Most High Jade Capital’s Eastern Radiance,  
Immortal Master of the Left Palace of the Supreme Ultimate,  
Thunder and Lightning’s Mysterious Inspector,  
Heavenly Secret Minister of the Inner Mysteries,  
Jade Void’s Purple Spirit, Universal Transformer of the Mysterious Stillness,  
Everlasting Dao, Harmonizing Response, Faithful Protection, True Lord,  
Silkworm’s Grace, Broad Rescuer, Compassionate Great Emperor,  
Heavenly Venerable of Boundless Salvation,  
Who delivers countless beings across the realms.
