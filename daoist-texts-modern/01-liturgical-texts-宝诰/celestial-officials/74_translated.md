# The Precious Edict of Lord Xu, the True Sovereign

With utmost sincerity, I bow and submit my life in reverent homage.  
From the Primordial Ancestor of the Mixed Unity, the One Breath gave birth to the True.  
Long before countless kalpas, through patient accumulation, the supreme dao was attained.  
Diligence and hardship were fully embraced; the weaving of the cosmos grew ever profound.  
Among myriad dharmas and a thousand gates, none escaped this passage.  

He rescues from calamity and lifts from hardship,  
Eradicates harm and dispels demons.  
His功 benefits all living beings, his name exalted in the imperial registers.  
All the true ones revere and look up to him; fittingly, he is granted the honored throne.  

Great compassion and vast vow, great filial piety and boundless benevolence—  
Across the nine provinces, the immortal Grand Historian,  
The luminous Great Envoy of Thunder and Peace, Heavenly Pivot, Demon-Subduing Prime Minister,  
Master of the Supreme Dao’s numinous responses and wondrous功,  
Controller of the Nine Heavens, overseeing the celestial bureaucracy of Great Unity,  
Registrar of Life’s True Sovereign,  
Inspector of the Three Heavens,  
Deputy Commander of Universal Proclamations and Advisory Councils,  
Heavenly Physician Great Emperor,  
Ancestor Master who ferries souls across,  
Pure and Radiant Universal Transforming Heavenly Venerable.
