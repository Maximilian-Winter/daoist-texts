# Precious Edict of the True Lord of the Three Maos

With a devoted heart, I bow and take refuge in reverence.  
Heaven and humanity, dao and virtue—  
the immortal sages and true teachers.  
Filial piety and fraternal duty illuminate the numinous,  
their grace and favor extend over family and realm.  

He withdrew to the Hidden Mount Heng, awakening to the Dao;  
dwelling in the crooked ravines, he ascended to Heaven.  
He presides over the sacred peaks of Mount Tai,  
his charge the caverns of Chicheng and Huayang.  
Through kalpas he governs yin and yang,  
commanding thunder, lightning, waters, and marshes in harmonious office.  

Receiving the noble bearing of two younger brothers,  
he imparts the secret methods to ascend the True.  
All hold the registry of spirits and immortals,  
together bearing the honor of the Jade Tablets.  
His virtue pervades the hidden and manifest,  
his benevolence moistens all beneath the general’s banner.  

Responding swiftly to circumstance and stirring,  
his vows are vast and profound.  

The Most Primordial Sublime Dao, void and ineffable,  
holy protection and true response—True Lord.  
Earth Immortal, Supreme True,  
Right Registrar of the Fixed Record, Guardian of the Supreme Dao,  
Void Stillness, Virtue’s Protection, Marvelous Response—True Lord.  
Earth Immortal, Utmost True,  
Protector of Life, Subtle and Mysterious,  
Compassionate and Benevolent, Protector of Divine Response—True Lord.  

High Minister of the Nine Heavens, Controller of Fate,  
Manifestation of the Three Maos,  
Heavenly Venerable Who Guards Life.
