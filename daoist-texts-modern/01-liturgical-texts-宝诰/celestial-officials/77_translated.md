# Precious Edict of the Venerable Wei

With wholehearted devotion, I turn my heart and bow in reverent homage.  
The Primordial Sovereign unfolds transformation, manifesting the wondrous true body.  
Radiance like the full moon reveals a compassionate countenance,  
While the pure and tranquil mysterious wind opens the path of orthodox teaching.  

The honored Dao, the sacred Patriarch,  
Whose virtue is weighty as the Sovereign of Medicine,  
Master of thunder and lightning across the Three Realms,  
Registrar of the fates and fortunes of all living beings.  

The Patriarch, great in mercy and kindness,  
The Celestial King illuminating the imperial court,  
Chief Immortal Lord of the Southern Peak,  
Supreme Commander of Destiny in the Nine Heavens,  
Guardian of the Golden Pavilion, exalted and pureâ€”  
The Primordial True Lord of the Purple Void.
