# Precious Edict of the Primordial Sovereign Ancestor

With devoted heart, I bow and take refuge in reverence.  
The Primordial begins by transforming qi, pure and subtle, the true orthodox root.  
Vast and lofty in brilliance, awakening the heart wholly within the very essence of the Dao.  
Firm and vigorous, immaculate and unblemished, its innate nature endowed by the numinous spirits.  

It wields thunderbolts within the realm of non-action,  
Embracing Heaven and Earth beyond all forms and images.  
At the supreme summit beyond the supreme, it gathers the true source of the four great lineages.  
Profound beyond profundity, it partakes in the wondrous meaning of the three vehicles.  

It unfolds and proclaims the great teaching,  
Bringing benefit and salvation to all living beings.  
Illuminating the palace within, the pure subtle ancestral master—  
The peerless attendant of the celestial throne, radiant in the Golden Palace’s stillness.  

The wondrous dao preserves the immortals,  
Its transformative power unites as one—the Primordial Sovereign Ancestor in shining glory.
