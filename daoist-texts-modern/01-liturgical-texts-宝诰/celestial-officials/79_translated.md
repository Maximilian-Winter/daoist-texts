# Precious Edict of Grandmaster Jiang Taigong

With devoted heart, I bow and take refuge in reverence.  
When Shang Geng descended from the heavens, Zhou Kang soared aloft.  
The wondrous stratagems of the Six Secret Teachings revealed martial brilliance;  
The seven lords of the Book of Changes brought forth worthy ministers.  

From generals to prime ministers, Guangcheng forged eternal deeds;  
Punishing the guilty and mourning the people, their fame flows through ten thousand ages.  
The Grand Tutor of boundless benevolence, founder of the Great Zhou, established the revered Office of the Chancellor;  
Ancestor of a hundred schools, Marquis Qi, the illustrious and valiant King Wu of Zhou.  

Mastermind of the war tent, outwitting the Wind Queen;  
Harmonizing yin and yang, surpassing even Pengzu’s longevity.  
Through a thousand ages, there has been but one imperial teacher;  
Across a hundred generations, no second true royal aide.  

Great vow, great sage, great merit, great virtue—  
He who presides over the Heavenly Pivot, the Secretariat of the Prime Minister,  
Grand Tutor and Chancellor of State, master of stratagems and teachings,  
Beloved Sovereign of the Primordial Firmament, the Difficult-to-Heavenly Venerable.
