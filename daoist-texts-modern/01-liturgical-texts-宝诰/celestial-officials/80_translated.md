# Precious Proclamation of the Primordial Writ

With devoted heart and reverent bow, I submit my vow.  
In the age of Zhou, there lived a Perfected One, the Guardian of Hangu Pass.  
From tender years he delved into the ancient tombs and sought their secrets;  
In youth he practiced the Pristine Changes, the Simple Book of Transformation.  

He mastered the profound mysteries of Heaven’s patterns and hidden scriptures,  
Skilled in discerning the shifting dance of yin and yang’s endless transformations.  
In the realm of Yong Prefecture, beneath the southern peaks of Zhongnan,  
He built a humble thatched tower, a sanctuary of insight.  

There, he gazed through the veil of stars,  
Grasping the eternal dao that underlies all things.  
He welcomed the sacred presence of the Eastern Purple Radiance, the Saintly One,  
And encountered the Most High, who imparted the scriptures and sacred methods.  

From tower to hermitage, his teachings spread, numbering five thousand voices,  
The true origin of myriad laws, profound beyond all fathoming.  
He opened the lineage, inheriting the honored name: Primordial Origin.  
Recorded in the annals of Zhou, known as the Guardian Yin Yi.  

Great compassion, great vow;  
Great sage, great mercy.  
Minister of Jade Clarity on High,  
Primordial True Lord of the Primordial Origin.  
Ancient and vast as the golden sun, he aids the world’s awakening—  
The Celestial Venerable who unfolds Heaven’s grace.
