# Precious Edict of the Perfected One of Nanhua

With a devoted heart, I turn and bow in reverent homage.  
From the Most Pure and Mysterious Lineage, the hidden official of the Lacquer Grove emerges.  
The scripture was inscribed at Nanhua, its practice in harmony with the heart of Heaven.  
He aids the profound, endorses the teaching, nameless and selfless.  
Mingling form and spirit, he passes through the Great Void.  

Disciple of the venerable Master Sang, the Perfected One of Nanhua cultivates the dao,  
Ingesting the fiery elixir of the Northern Pulse within the embrace of the Calf—  
Ascending in flight beyond the mundane world.  
Riding the axis of Heaven and Earth, he commands the subtle distinctions of the six energies.  

He soars alongside myriad beings,  
Together with the mighty Kun and Peng, he roams the boundless expanse.  
His virtue moistens the world; his dao saves ten thousand generations.  
Carefree and unbound, he transcends birth and death alike.  

Great Sage, Great Benevolence,  
Great Filial Piety, Great Compassion.  

From the chamber of the Supreme Ultimate,  
The subtle and wondrous, the primordial and all-pervading—  
The True Lord of Nanhua, who freely unfolds the profound and aids the world,  
The Grand Celestial Venerable.
