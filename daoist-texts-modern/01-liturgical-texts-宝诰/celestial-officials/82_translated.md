# Precious Edict of the Venerable Yellow Immortal

With a devoted heart, I bow and take refuge in your sacred presence.  
Bathed in golden radiance, you attained the Dao;  
As a youthful adept, you practiced the true method.  
Guided by the immortal Ge, you crossed the mortal shore,  
Enduring austere cultivation for forty years.  

Sustained by the nourishing spirit of poria mushroom,  
You refined the dao and became truly perfected.  
With your magic you manifest in the dusty world,  
Universally ferrying all beings to liberation.  

Your dharma shines forth with luminous numinosity,  
A splendid flower of talent and heroic grace.  
You wield the wondrous power to command stones to transform into sheep,  
Eradicating stubborn ailments, restoring swift health.  

You traverse the Three Realms, dissolving kalpas and dispelling calamities.  
Proclaiming the Five Pathsâ€”filial piety, brotherly love, loyalty, faith, benevolence, righteousness, propriety, kindness, honesty, and integrity.  

With great compassion and vast vows,  
A mighty sage of profound mercy.  

By imperial decree, you are sealed as the Mysterious and Universal Transformer,  
The Nurturer of Purity and Uprightness,  
The Sovereign Emperor, the Red Pine Immortal Elder.
