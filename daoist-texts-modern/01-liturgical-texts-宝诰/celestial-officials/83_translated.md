# Precious Edict of Primordial Lord Magu

With utmost sincerity, I bow and take refuge in reverence.  
Perfectly penetrating, deep and serene, steadfastly responding with compassion and benevolence.  

On Mount Kunlun, manifesting a wondrous body,  
In the grottoes of Qingcheng, revealing sacred traces of light.  
Passing through Wu and crossing Cai, skillfully responding with sincerity and spiritual communion;  
Casting grains of rice that transform into the Golden Elixir, ever at play with transformations and marvels.  

She commands the assembly of immortals above,  
Enfolding the myriad convergences within her embrace.  
Refining the body through the Nine Harmonies,  
Surpassing merit to the Ten Extremes.  

Great Compassion, Great Vow,  
Great Sage, Great Mercyâ€”  
Magu, True Stillness, Responsive Void, Benevolent Protector, Marvelous Salvation, Primordial Lord.
