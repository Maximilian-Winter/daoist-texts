# Precious Edict of the Immortal Elder of Hongya

With a devoted heart, I take refuge and offer reverent obeisance. One Breath divides the True; the Five Phases nurture the primal essence. In the dawn of antiquity, he stood as the exemplar of Shennong’s sacred lineage; receiving the Two Forms, he embodies the numinous secret of the Spiritual Treasure.

Ever manifesting through the Jin and Tang dynasties, his radiance extends through both past and present ages. He strides upon the snowy essence of the Western Peaks, his long, resounding call cleaving the open expanse of Kaiyuan. His voice stirs the imperial canopy; pure and transcendent, it echoes within the Hall of Crystal Dew. His law is passed down through humble robes of feather and hemp, weaving the vast brilliance of the Great Flood Dao’s daily light.

His grace spreads across the boundless realm, his favor encompassing all beneath Heaven. With great compassion and vast vows, profound filial piety and immense benevolence, the Immortal Elder of Hongya of Qingcheng—the Pure and Bright Master of the Scripture—responds and transforms as the True Sovereign.
