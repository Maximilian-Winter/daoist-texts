# The Precious Edict of Master Lü

With utmost sincerity, I bow and submit my heart in reverent homage.  
Within the Jade Clarity, the Inner Minister dwells;  
At the Golden Gate, the chosen immortals assemble.  
Manifesting as the teacher of the Three Teachings,  
He holds the laws and commands the edicts of the Five Thunders.  

Awakened from the yellow millet dream,  
He forgets the worldly honors and fame;  
His treasured sword shines with radiant light,  
Sweeping away the demons and monsters of the human realm.  

Through the Four Lives and the Six Paths,  
Wherever there is feeling, there is sure faith;  
Across the Three Realms and the Ten Directions,  
No request goes unanswered.  

On the tower of the Yellow Crane remain sacred traces,  
Within the Jade Clarity Hall, the elixir of cinnabar is refined.  
Preserving the image of the Dao in the cliffside shrine,  
Revealing the immortal’s trail within the clouded grotto.  

He unfolds the incense and flame of the dharma gate,  
Guides the mysterious lineage as ladder and ship.  
Great compassion, great vow—  
Great sage, great mercy.  

He opens mountains and initiates teachings—  
The responsive and numinous ancestral master.  
Heavenly Thunder’s Upper Minister,  
The Numinous Treasure True Man.  

The Pure Yang manifests the correct warning and transformation,  
Protecting and blessing the Sovereign Lord,  
The Venerable of the Wonderful Dao set in motion.
