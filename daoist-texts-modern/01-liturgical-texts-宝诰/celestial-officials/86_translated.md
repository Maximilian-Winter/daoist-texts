# Precious Declaration of the Lord of the Blood Lake Sect

With devoted heart, I take refuge and bow in reverence.  
In the Great Luo Heaven above, the celestial palace is solemnly honored.  

Once dwelling on the eastern heights of Crane’s Cry Mountain,  
Born first among wealthy elders of noble rank.  
With a compassionate countenance, pitying and kind,  
His virtue vast and boundless in generous bestowal;  

He pondered deeply the profound grace of his parents,  
A debt so heavy it defies repayment—Heaven and Earth gave him life.  
Cherishing the tender nursing, the embrace and gentle lifting,  
At dawn, raising his fists in solemn vow, his filial heart never slackened.  

He attained the Jade Capital’s Golden Gate,  
Imperially bestowed with talismanic banners;  
He traversed the rocky ravines of the Blood Lake,  
Seeking the sound to rescue his mother.  

He uprooted guilt and suffering,  
Ascending to the upper realms of Heaven.  

Great filial piety, great benevolence,  
Great compassion, great grace.  

The Lord of the Blood Lake Sect,  
The True Person of Precious Form,  
The True Lord who extends merit and repays virtue.
