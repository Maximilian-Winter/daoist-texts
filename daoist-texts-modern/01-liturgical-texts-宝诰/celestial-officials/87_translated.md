# The Precious Injunction of Guigu

With utmost sincerity, I bow and take refuge in reverence.  
The Great Luo Dao Master, the Immortal Elder of the Upper Realm,  
whose profound workings penetrate all mysteries,  
mending the pivotal mechanism of Creation’s yin and yang.  

His daoist learning soars beyond the heavens,  
unveiling the secret depths of Heaven, humanity, and life itself.  
Upon the summit of Yunmeng Mountain, he refines the elixir and gathers herbs;  
within the Waterfall Grotto, he cleanses marrow and shaves away coarse hair.  

He attains the adamantine, indestructible body,  
cultivates the jade mirror of ever-bright nature.  
With divine stratagems and wondrous calculations,  
he judges the fortunes and misfortunes of the mortal world;  
with subtle immortal arts, he dispels calamities and cosmic tribulations.  

Compassionate and merciful, pitying the world’s suffering,  
his merit and virtue equal the vast heavens.  
His name resounds through past and present ages,  
his dao pervades the three thousand worlds.  

Among the dust of the mundane, like swift wind and sudden rain,  
he opens the path to awakening for all beings.  
He bestows rain and dew, absolves guilt and erases faults,  
transforms things and breathes life into all creation.  

Great compassion, great vow, great virtue, great benevolence—  
in the Great Luo Heavenly Realm, the jeweled firmament and profound mystery,  
he ferries souls to salvation and delivers the world.  

The venerable King of Meditation and Zen,  
the Immortal Master of Guigu,  
spreads and proclaims the wondrous Dao—  
the Heavenly Venerable of Sublime Truth.
