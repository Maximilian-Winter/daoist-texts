# Proclamation of the Venerable Sovereign, Lord Zhao

With utmost sincerity, I bow and take refuge in reverence.  
Concealing the spirit, cultivating and refining,  
The honored ones of primordial Heaven,  
The True Lords of the Great Dao,  
Boundless within the Dharma Realm,  
Embodiments of the Dao, effortless and spontaneous.  

They transmit the wondrous secrets of the Venerable Lao,  
Inscribing the numinous talismans of the Dao’s Patriarch.  
In hand, the Seven-Star Dragon-Slaying Sword,  
Beneath their feet, the Southern Serpent rides upon five-colored clouds.  

They sever demons and fiends throughout the Three Realms, inside and out,  
Proclaiming and transforming all under the Four Seas, ancient and present.  
Opening the altar of the Orthodox Teaching,  
The profound lineage endures eternally.  

Summoning spirits, dispatching generals,  
Vowing boundlessly without limit,  
Their numinous power penetrates the Dipper’s course.  
Ever opening blessings and auspiciousness,  
Great Compassion, Great Vow,  
Great Sage, Great Mercy,  
The Primordial Sovereign initiates the teaching,  
Master of myriad dharmas,  
Thunder and lightning respond and transform,  
The Perfected True One of Supreme Clarity,  
Guiding the profound, unfolding the correct Heaven’s Venerable.
