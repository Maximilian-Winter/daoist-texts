# The Precious Edict of the Medicine King

With utmost reverence I bow and take refuge. Within the Palace of the Supreme Ultimate, in the celestial realm of Quanzhen, there dwells one who masters the wondrous art of revival, who unveils the quintessence of the great dao. From childhood known as the Divine Child, his years unfold with countless marvels; he is famed throughout the broad halls of the Gate of Completion, his wisdom and favor no mere illusion. Through the courts of Qi, Liang, Sui, and Tang dynasties, his years defy measure; on lofty peaks he offers humble writings whose ink leaves no trace, the heavenly secrets behind the elbow reveal mysteries that open hidden treatises. He encompasses the three teachings in his writings, a true sovereign of medicine—the Mirror of Precious Gold—leader of the profound lineage. Great compassion and mercy, great saintliness and vow; supremely wondrous and numinous, he subdues dragons and tames tigers. Protector of the realm, savior of the people, the efficacious Grand Perfected Sun.

## The Precious Edict of the Medicine King, Grand Perfected Sun  
With sincere heart I bow and take refuge.

I respectfully invite the peerless Medicine King, the Venerable One,  
Whose compassionate heart aids the world, Grand Perfected Sun,  
Within the Nine Elders’ Cavern he transmits the true and profound,  
Beneath the Three Heavenly Gates he refines elixirs divine.  

He rides a black tiger roaming the world,  
His feet tread the fiery chariot journeying Kunlun,  
Clad in a red robe with a white jade belt,  
Ever bearing wondrous medicines close at hand.  

A celestial guest of the Isles of Penglai,  
The Medicine King revered in the mortal realm of Yanfu,  
His jade image stands majestic before the Golden Palace,  
In proper robes and crowns he pays homage to the High Perfected.  

At the Orange Well the elixir work is fulfilled,  
Turning stone to gold to aid the good people,  
When illness strikes the world they come seeking him,  
Humbly beseeching the Venerable One to save the people.  

He blocks all hindrances before and behind, removing them with a nod,  
Exchanging money for talismanic paper that halts ill fate’s progress,  
Transforming homes into golden palaces,  
Turning mortals into celestial immortals.  

Eighteen generations of illustrious medical ancestors,  
Twenty-eight revered Medicine Kings,  
Igniting dragon eyes and phoenix eyes,  
Dispelling evil, capturing demons, severing malevolent spirits.  

Healing dragons and tigers, manifesting virtue and dao,  
Quickening birth and safeguarding delivery, vows unending,  
Disciples humbly petition, longing for your arrival,  
Grant great blessings and auspiciousness, ever to protect and uphold.
