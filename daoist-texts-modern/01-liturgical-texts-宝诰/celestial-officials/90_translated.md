# Precious Edict of the Celestial Master Xu Jing

**Precious Edict of the Celestial Master Xu Jing**

With a devoted heart, I bow and submit my vow.  
White snow ascends to the cinnabar sky,  
Yellow sprouts curl and accumulate.  
The writings of the stars and the Northern Dipper, bestowed by the Venerable Lord Lao,  
The secret mysteries of the Three and Five Flying Steps,  
The jade bureau’s registers and talismans, handed down from the Han progenitor,  
The sacred One’s secret intent to sever evil—  
By name alone, one ascends to the Purple Mansion,  
Constantly grasping the thunderbolts in hand.  
Dispelling pestilence and affliction upon Qingcheng,  
Eradicating demonic mists from the lower realms.  
Majestic and vast,  
Boundless and profound,  
From the Great Ultimate arises the two modes of being,  
Gathering the Three Blossoms to face the Five Qi.  
Responding to circumstances, mastering things,  
Rejecting evil idly, yet faithfully following the Way.  
Great compassion, great vow,  
Great sage, great mercy.  
The Patriarch, Lord of Earth and Spirits, Teacher of the Teachings,  
The Celestial Master of the thirtieth generation,  
Xu Jing, who broadly comprehended the wondrous dao, Lord Zhang the True Sovereign,  
Minister within the Heavenly Palace,  
The Perfected of Infinite Literary Splendor,  
The Venerable of the Azure Sky who unfolds the teachings.

## Commentary on the Precious Edict of the Celestial Master Xu Jing

The Patriarch Zhang’s Precious Edict, that is, the Precious Edict of the Celestial Master Xu Jing Zhang Jixian.  
Celestial Master Xu Jing was the thirtieth generation Celestial Master of the Celestial Master Dao. He once entered Sichuan to restore eleven regions. A renowned Daoist of the Northern Song, styled Jiawen, also styled Daozheng, with the sobriquet Xiaoranzi. Summoned four times to the Eastern Capital to conduct grand rituals within the imperial court, he was granted the title Master Xu Jing, ranked as Zhong San Daifu, and bestowed with the imperial jade seal carved with the inscription Yangping Zhi Du Gong. He was the great patriarch of the Qingwei branch of the Orthodox Celestial Master tradition.

### White Snow, Cinnabar Sky, Yellow Sprouts, Curled Accumulations

Born on the twentieth day of the tenth month in the ren-shen year of the seventh year of the Yuanyou reign of the Northern Song, Celestial Master Xu Jing came into the world at Menggu Hermitage on Mount Longhu. At five years old, he had yet to speak; one day, hearing the rooster’s crow, he suddenly laughed and composed a poem:  
“The spiritual parrot has five virtues,  
Its crown and beak never part from the body.  
At the fifth watch it opens wide its mouth,  
Calling awake those dreaming in slumber.”  
The next day, he sat serenely atop a jade lotus flower; all who saw him marveled, calling him a true immortal.

In the third year of the Yuanyou reign, at nine years old, Xu Jing inherited the teachings. He was summoned four times to the Eastern Capital to perform grand rituals within the imperial court. Celestial Master Xu Jing remained unmarried and childless all his life, his will set on simplicity, delighting in the vast solitude of the mountains, cultivating the Way in purity and stillness. He built a hermitage behind the Palace of Supreme Clarity, a place for heart fasting and sitting in forgetfulness. Emperor Huizong of Song personally inscribed the name “Tranquil Passage Hermitage” for it and bestowed a pavilion named “Xiaoran.” He also established the Lingbao, Yunjin, and Zhenyi temples, transforming the ancestral hall into the Teaching Hall.

Celestial Master Xu Jing foresaw the calamity of the “Jingkang Shame” and the national disaster through the ominous signs of red sheep and red horses. He entrusted his disciple Wang Daojian to convey to Emperor Huizong the imperative to “cultivate virtue and quell disaster.” In the *Recorded Sayings of the True Lord Xu Jing* are forty-eight poems on the Golden Elixir, speaking of the interplay of Kan and Li, white snow and yellow sprouts, tiger and dragon, lead and mercury—metaphors for inner alchemical work—and applying the internal elixir to thunder magic.

The “white snow,” “cinnabar sky,” “yellow sprouts,” and “old accumulations” mentioned in the *Precious Edict of Patriarch Zhang* are the arts of yellow and white, metaphors from the alchemical scriptures. The *Recorded Sayings of the True Lord Xu Jing* states:  
“Li and Kan interweave, the body finds peace;  
Only then do you see the couple united.  
White snow refined long enough equals sun and moon,  
Yellow sprouts ingested long enough produce Heaven and Earth.  
Tiger and dragon are the steeds ascending to Heaven,  
Lead and mercury are the primordial vessels for transcendence.”

Celestial Master Xu Jing advanced the spirit of the Celestial Master lineage, deeply studying the learning of life and nature to master thunder’s essence, founding the Orthodox Celestial Master thunder methods of Mount Longhu, setting a model for future thunder method Daoist sects.

The Three and Five Flying Steps are the orthodox chapter methods; the Nine Spirits Flying Steps belong to the Dongxuan division’s practices. The Three and Five Flying Steps are essential arts for commanding spirits and ghosts. If one cultivates the heart well, naturally the official mansions become clear and smooth, the spirit harmonizes and the qi flows freely—all arising from the sacred One’s affairs. The methods of orthodox One’s severing of evil, the Three and Five Flying Steps, copper talismans and iron seals, the Golden Elixir scriptures, secret efficacious chapters, and the twenty-four ranks of registers were all transmitted from Lord Lao to the Patriarch Celestial Master, and from the Patriarch to Celestial Master Xu Jing.

### The Writings of the Stars and the Northern Dipper, Bestowed by Lord Lao; The Secret Mysteries of the Three and Five Flying Steps; The Jade Bureau’s Registers and Talismans, Handed Down from the Han Progenitor; The Sacred One’s Secret Intent to Sever Evil

According to the *Recorded Sayings of the True Lord Xu Jing*, Celestial Master Xu Jing held that:  
“Our family’s method and registers can move Heaven and Earth above, shake mountains and rivers below, command dragons and tigers in the clear light, capture ghosts and spirits in the hidden realm. Its merit can revive decayed bones, its cultivation can transcend birth and death. It can stabilize the nation on a grand scale, dispel calamities on a small scale. Yet to obtain it depends on cultivation; to lose it depends on falling away.”

Master Xu once received from his teacher the copper talismans, iron seals, Golden Elixir scriptures, the orthodox One’s severing evil method, and the Three and Five Flying Steps technique. The ranks and secrets control myriad spirits. From the well in Tanzhou, he wielded his sword to chase the dragon, emerging from that very well.

The *Complete Book of Purity, Clarity, Loyalty, and Filiality* states:  
“The boundless pure void is called Purity and Clarity; the Way within it is called Central Yellow. The method spreads to the eight directions as the Eight Extremes, uniting the Four Symbols, facing the Three Heavens—this is the Three and Five Flying Steps. Regulate the inner, govern the outer—this is the orthodox One’s severing evil. To govern the outer, first rectify the inner; to rectify the inner, first remove desire. Without desire, the heart is naturally One; with a correct heart, the Way and method are complete.”

### By the One Alone, One Ascends to the Purple Mansion; By the One Alone, One Grasps the Thunderbolts in Hand

Celestial Master Xu Jing’s transmitted methods include the *Method of Summoning and Commanding the Temple’s Apparitions and Deities*, the *Chapter to Break Delusions* (also called the *Song of the Great Way*), the *Great Unity’s Secret Forbidden Method of the Heavenly Star Striking*, the *Great Unity Fire Rhinoceros Thunder Mansion’s General Zhu’s Examination and Attachment Method*, the *Earthly Deities’ Warm Marshal Method*, the *East Peace Marshal Zhang’s Exclusive Summoning Method*, the *Earthly Deities’ Demon Severing Marshal’s Secret Method*, and the *Fengdu Bright Spirit Marshal’s Secret Method*—all honoring Celestial Master Xu Jing as the principal patriarch of the method.

His dharma heirs, Patriarchs Sa Shoujian, Zhu Meijing, Lu Yanghao, Chen Xiwei, and others of the Shenxiao lineage, flourished around the Southern Song. In the Yuan dynasty, the thirty-sixth generation Celestial Master Zhang Zongyan inherited his legacy, obtaining the *Imperial Command Precious Pearl Five Thunder Prayer Method*, issuing commands across the heavens, commanding the thunder of the Three Realms, wielding the primordial One Qi in operation, forming talismans by the later Heaven’s Eight Trigrams, named Precious Pearl.

Summoned by Emperor Shizu of Yuan, he was granted the title “Master of Dao’s Spirit Response and Harmonious Penetration,” given a second-rank silver seal, and appointed head of Jiangnan Daoist affairs. His imperial decree reads:  
“The thirty-sixth generation Celestial Master Zhang Zongyan, you faithfully transmit the dharma lineage, embody the pure true spirit, broadly uphold the great science of the Yellow Court’s great cavern, hold the orthodox One’s alliance and awe-inspiring registers, both pure and tranquil, with faith and sincerity. A three-foot green serpent commands ghosts and spirits in the dark desert; a cup of clear water purifies demons near and far. Having greatly expanded the merit of salvation, you deserve the title of honor.”

Since the Tang dynasty, the pacification of Sichuan had long fallen into neglect. In the Song, the thirtieth generation Celestial Master entered Sichuan to restore eleven regions. Especially on Mount Qingcheng, where weapons fell silent and pestilence ceased, the Orthodox Celestial Master dao was revived. Today, at the Celestial Master Cave on Mount Qingcheng, a statue of Celestial Master Xu Jing is enshrined, drawing countless pilgrims each year.

In the second year of the Chongning reign of the Northern Song, the salt pond waters of Xiezhou overflowed. Emperor Huizong consulted the Daoist Xu Shenweng. Xu Shenweng recommended Celestial Master Xu Jing. In the third year of Chongning, Xu Jing was summoned to the capital; an iron talisman was immediately issued, ordering his disciple Zhu Yongyou and a palace eunuch to cast it into the collapsed pond bank. Suddenly, thunder and lightning darkened the day; a dragon demon was torn apart at the water’s edge.

Emperor Huizong asked Celestial Master Xu Jing: “By what means will you subdue the dragon? Can it be seen?” Xu Jing replied that he would command Guan Yu to be summoned. Grasping his sword, he called to the left of the hall; Guan Yu appeared accordingly. Emperor Huizong then conferred upon him the title “True Lord of Chongning.” Guan Yu is venerated and titled in Daoism as the True Lord of Chongning, owing to Celestial Master Xu Jing’s summoning of him to slay the dragon in the salt pond. From then on, he received successive imperial titles.

### Crossing the Great Ultimate to Ascend the Purple Tenuity; Gathering the Three Blossoms to Face the Five Qi

In the second year of the Jingkang reign of the Northern Song, Celestial Master Xu Jing feathered his transformation at the age of thirty-six, buried at Tianqing Temple in Anhui. In the eleventh year of Shaoxing of the Southern Song, Patriarch Sa Shoujian of Xihe traveled to Mount Qingcheng and encountered Celestial Master Xu Jing at a mountain gorge, who bestowed talismanic methods, a water chant, a written letter, and a pair of shoes to pass the succession to the next Celestial Master. Upon reaching Mount Longhu, the successor was astonished by the letter and, opening the coffin, found only the vermilion shoes remaining. Thus it was known that Celestial Master Xu Jing’s body had dissolved and he had ascended.

After feathering his transformation, Daoist companions often saw him at Luofu and Western Shu, appearing and disappearing unpredictably. It is said that on his journey when summoned, he deeply understood the grave state of affairs, that no one could reverse the tide. Thus, he feigned death through embryonic breathing to preserve himself. Afterwards, he withdrew deeply into the mountains and forests, cultivating the Way between Western Shu and the Min and Yue regions, transmitting the teachings and instructing disciples, writing and establishing doctrines.  
The Southern Song’s exalted Daoist Bai Yuchan was known for his talismanic omens; wherever he went, strange responses occurred. Those who wished to learn from him could not converse with him; he came and went alone, traveling two or three hundred li a day. People who saw his swift leaps often suspected he was Celestial Master Xu Jing.  
“Gathering the Three Blossoms to Face the Five Qi” means “Three Blossoms gather atop the head, Five Qi face the Origin,” indicating Celestial Master Xu Jing’s attainment of the primordial Way.

### Responding to Circumstances, Mastering Things; Rejecting Evil Idly, Yet Faithfully Following the Way; Great Compassion, Great Vow; Great Sage, Great Mercy

Celestial Master Xu Jing once saved a mother fox spirit and her child struck by thunder calamity, aiding their cultivation and delivering them from tribulation. Later, the story of the fox spirit mother and child’s threefold repayment of kindness was passed down. In the ancient classic *Water Margin*, at the opening, the Celestial Master who prays to dispel plague and the bandit Hong Jiao who mistakenly lets demons loose is indeed Celestial Master Xu Jing.

### Patriarch, Lord of Earth and Spirits, Teacher of the Teachings; The Celestial Master of the Thirtieth Generation

During the Xuanhe reign, Celestial Master Xu Jing traveled to the Eastern Peak, where the Spirit of Radiance Gong welcomed him in the suburbs. Xu Jing said to Marshal Wen:  
“The people of Wenzhou have petitioned the Heavenly Court, saying you have the merit to relieve drought. You do not take pride in temple offerings or national enfeoffment, but have the will to return to the orthodox Way and support the Patriarch. Before the Mountain Sovereign, I make you a local earth deity, a commissioner of the earth spirits, with correct law, talismans, and incantations.”

“You transform on the fifteenth day of the third month, at the hour of Yin—this is the season of the old wood and the beginning of fire. Wood generates fire, fire flourishes in Bing and Ding. Ghosts are the spirits of all things, so this seal is your true form, enough to suffice.”  
Celestial Master Xu Jing made his talisman with the characters “Bing Ding Sheng Gui” (Bing Ding born ghost), matching the time to form the true seal. He also wrote and painted various talismans in cloud script. The earth spirits’ method began here.

Celestial Master Xu Jing pointed out: Earth spirits serve the mandate of Jade Clarity, called the officers who guard and escort the Lingbao. Thus, the *Scripture of Deliverance* speaks of the kalpa controlling earth spirits and attendants escorting and sending. He also told disciples: “The method division is most efficacious, none surpasses Wenqiong.” In other words, the earth spirits’ methods originated with Celestial Master Xu Jing’s teaching. Hence, he is honored as the Patriarch and Lord of Earth and Spirits.

The *Compendium of Daoist Methods* states that earth spirit talismans, such as the “Bing Ding Born Ghost Talisman,” urgent capture talismans, and healing talismans, were all transmitted by Celestial Master Xu Jing.

### Xu Jing, Broadly Comprehending the Wondrous Dao, Lord Zhang the True Sovereign; The Profound Wind Who Unfolds Transformation, the Venerable of Heaven

The *Essentials of the Daoist Canon, Zhang Collection, Daoist Practices* records: Patriarch, Lord of Earth and Spirits, Celestial Master of the thirtieth generation,  
Xu Jing, broadly comprehending the wondrous dao, Lord Zhang the True Sovereign,  
Minister within the Heavenly Palace,  
The Perfected of Infinite Literary Splendor,  
The Venerable of the Azure Sky who unfolds the teachings.

In the fourth year of Chongning, Emperor Huizong of Song bestowed the title Master Xu Jing. In the first year of Zhida, Emperor Wuzong of Yuan officially conferred the title Xu Jing, Profoundly Penetrating and Broadly Comprehending True Sovereign. In the thirteenth year of Zhizheng, Emperor Shundi of Yuan posthumously granted the title Xu Jing, Profoundly Penetrating and Broadly Comprehending True Sovereign.
