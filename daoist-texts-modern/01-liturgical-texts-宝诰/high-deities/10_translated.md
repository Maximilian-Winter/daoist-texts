# Precious Decree of the Divine Azure Heaven

With utmost sincerity, I bow and take refuge in reverence.  
The exalted and supreme Divine Azure Heaven’s Mansion,  
Where spirits gather, radiant and resplendent shines the Palace.  
Here the Primordial Ancestor’s qi divides into the True;  
Responding to the wondrous Dao of Void and Nothingness, it unfolds transformation.  

Positioned above the Nine Heavens, it governs the myriad skies;  
Encompassing the Ten Extremes, it presides over all myriad transformations.  
It proclaims the Golden Talisman, casting down light to relieve suffering,  
Bestowing grace and favor, nurturing and sheltering all living beings.  

Its benevolence pervades the Primal Origin,  
Its kindness spreads across the vast kalpas.  
Great Compassion, Great Vow,  
Great Sage, Great Mercy,  
The True King of Jade Purity,  
The Great Emperor of the Southern Pole’s Longevity,  
The Sovereign of the Primordial Heaven, the Holy Heavenly Venerable.
