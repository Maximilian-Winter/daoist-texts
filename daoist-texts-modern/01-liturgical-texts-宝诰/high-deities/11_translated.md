# The Precious Edict of Salvation from Suffering

With utmost sincerity, I bow and take refuge in reverence.  
In the realm of Azure Splendor and Eternal Joy,  
Within the Palace of Wondrous Majesty at the Eastern Extreme,  
There lies the Forest of Seven Treasures, fragrant and soaring,  
Upon the lotus throne of nine resplendent colors.  

Encircled by myriad perfected beings,  
Amidst a hundred billion auspicious lights,  
The Venerable Spirit of Supreme Clarity and Numinous Treasure appears,  
Manifesting the Mysterious Primordial Origin.  

Through vast kalpas, extending boundless compassion to aid,  
He opens the Gate of Sweet Dew in the Great Thousandfold World.  
The marvelous Dao is his true body,  
Adorned with the purple-golden sign of auspiciousness.  

Responding promptly to the call of those in need,  
His vows and mercies know no limit.  
Great Sage of great compassion,  
Great Mercy and great Vow,  
With names that transform through the Ten Directions,  
Universally delivering all beings.  

Across countless kalpas,  
He saves immeasurable multitudes,  
Hearing their cries and swiftly respondingâ€”  
The Heavenly Venerable of Great Unity, Savior from Suffering,  
The Azure-Black Sovereign on High.
