# The Precious Edict of Kehan

With utmost devotion, I bow and surrender my heart in reverent homage.  
On the exalted elixir firmament, beneath the primordial supreme palace,  
Within the vermilion halls and crimson courts, the radiant spirit is nurtured through the vast kalpa’s abode;  
Amidst the soaring sacred woodlands, auspicious signs manifest within the realm of Great Clarity.  

The great transformation moves with compassionate design,  
Descending the true essence, the key to the vital breath’s mechanism.  
Cutting away death to ascend life, expanding the virtue of the One from Heaven and Earth;  
Molding soul and forging spirit, returning the hidden numinous to all myriad beings.  

Illuminating the bright yang mind, universally spreading through the yin domain.  
Great compassion, great vow; great sage, great mercy—  
From the Nine Heavens’ Azure City comes  
Kehan the Venerable,  
The Heavenly Venerable of Life’s Passage at Vermilion Mound.
