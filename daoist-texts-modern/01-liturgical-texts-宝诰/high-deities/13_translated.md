# Precious Edict of the Five Elders

With devoted heart, I bow and take refuge.  
The Primordial Ancestors of yin and yang, the root and source of Heaven and Earth.  
Receiving the sacred decree from the Jade Emperor,  
Holding the incantations and seals bestowed by the Numinous Treasure.  

Gathering the embroidered scripts and mystic seals,  
Exhaling the quintessence of the Five Phases’ vital breaths;  
Clad in crimson sash and vermilion pouch,  
Radiating the dazzling brilliance of the Three Luminaries.  

Within the Hall of Cold Spirits, melodies of the flute and song arise,  
Swiftly traversing the Purple Tenuity Palace with flying steps.  
Refining and transcending the body’s form,  
Calming and driving away demons and malevolent spirits.  

Great compassion and vast vows,  
Great sage and boundless mercy—  
The Five Numinous Elders, Supreme Emperors,  
Heavenly Venerables who ferry souls and protect life.
