# The Precious Edict of the King Father of the East

With devoted heart, I turn and bow in reverent homage.  
The Pure and Subtle Great Dao, the Boundless Divine Lord,  
The Primordial’s transforming qi that divides the true,  
The Hidden Dragon of the Purple Mansion—do not stir nor use.  

He proclaims himself Emperor upon the mountains of the Four Directions,  
Charged with the heavenly registers of the immortals’ scrolls.  
He sets his palace gate above the Azure Sea,  
The Dao named for nurturing and bringing forth all beings.  

Within the Three Palaces are the offices of governance,  
The Eight Emperors sit as the throne of non-action.  
At the appointed time he ascends the platform,  
Turning southward with a gentle gaze,  

Purple qi flows from the east,  
Deep and serene, truly tranquil.  
He reveals the profound workings,  
The Sovereign Most High, the ancestor of all the perfected.  

Great compassion, great vow,  
Great sage, great mercy.  
The Great Director of Life of the Eastern Blossoms,  
The Lord of Lesser Yang, the Emperor of Fusang,  

The King Father of the East, the Heavenly Venerable of Wood.
