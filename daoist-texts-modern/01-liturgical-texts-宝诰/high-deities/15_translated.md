# The Precious Decree of the Queen Mother of the West

With devoted heart, I turn and bow in reverent homage.  
Heaven’s Pool unfolds in grand auspiciousness,  
The Limitless Holy Mother,  
At the Dragon Blossom’s splendid gathering, feasting in the Jade Pool—  
Where myriad spirits are ruled and the sacred teachings conveyed.  

All immortals present their blessings of longevity,  
Arrayed saints raise their goblets in solemn praise.  
Heaven’s awe stands but a breath away,  
Merits vast, virtues profound,  
In generations, harmonizing all balances,  
The Immortal Sovereign, Patriarch of the Dao.  

Three thousand attendant maidens,  
Perform celestial music on flutes and reeds.  
Centuries-old coiled peaches bloom,  
Opening the luminous, golden-green spirit garden.  

To rescue all beings from suffering and hardship,  
They sprinkle sweet dew upon the dusty world.  
Great compassion, great vow,  
Great saint, great mercy—  
The Limitless Jade Pool’s Great Saint,  
The Queen Mother of the West, the Golden Mother Heavenly Venerable.  

With devoted heart, I turn and bow in reverent homage.  
White jade reveals her traces,  
The Tortoise Terrace refines the true.  
Beautiful primordial pure waters,  
For countless ages, she is the Divine.  

The universe’s numinous Mother,  
The Supreme Primordial Sovereign,  
Who nurtures Heaven and Earth,  
From whom all things transform and arise.  

The Lord of Primal Origin and Master of Fate,  
The Jade Pool is her palace,  
Deeply cultivating virtue and grace,  
Perfecting ultimate peace.  

Her merciful ferry universally saves,  
Guiding and drawing lost souls across the ford.  
At the Dragon Blossom’s splendid gathering,  
The coiled peaches are bestowed upon the multitudes.  

Of great virtue and utmost benevolence,  
She redeems the returning primal spirits,  
Unifying the ledger of the myriad realms.  
The Dao continues through the Heavenly Venerable,  
The Limitless Jade Pool’s  
Great Saint, the Queen Mother of the West, the Golden Mother Heavenly Venerable.
