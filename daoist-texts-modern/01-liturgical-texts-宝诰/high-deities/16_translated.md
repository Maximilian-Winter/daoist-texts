# The Precious Edict of the Three Officials

With utmost sincerity, I bow and submit my vow.  
Only the Three Sacred Ones are truly one Great Ultimate.  
They ascend to receive the mandate of the vast kalpa,  
Bearing the cauldron that embraces countless grades of merit.  

The Purple Tenuity, pure and serene,  
Dwells within the cavern of Yin, overseeing all.  
They bestow rewards and punishments, grant blessings,  
Pardon sins and dissolve calamities,  
Extending boundless aid to life and death alike.  

Their dao crowns all the heavens,  
Their grace pervades the Three Realms.  
Great Compassion and Great Vow,  
Great Sage and Great Mercyâ€”  
The Three Primordials, Three Grades, Three Officials, Great Emperors,  
The Three Palaces and Nine Courts, the Responsive and Perceiving Heavenly Venerables.
