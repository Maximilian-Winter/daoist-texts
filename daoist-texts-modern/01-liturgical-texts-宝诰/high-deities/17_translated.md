# Precious Edict of the Heavenly Official of the Primordial Origin

With devoted heart and bowed spirit, I pay homage and take refuge.  
In the Mysterious Capital of Primordial Yang, within the Palace of the Purple Tenuity,  
He commands thirty-six divisions, accompanied by nine hundred million myriad hosts.  

He surveys the boundless Great Thousand Worlds,  
Registers all within the lands of the Ten Directions.  
His blessings extend to myriad spirits,  
Presiding over the records of good and evil among all beings.  

His grace pervades the Three Realms,  
Directing the ascent and descent of the immortals.  
He removes calamities born of falsehood,  
Unties the knots of ancient misfortunes.  
He liberates from the cycle of birth and death,  
Rescuing those trapped in shadowed suffering.  

All living creatures rely upon him,  
Their stirrings and movements all find peace and health.  
Great is his compassion, vast his vow;  
Sublime his sanctity, boundless his mercy.  

The Heavenly Official of the Primordial Origin bestows blessings through the Nine Qi of the Upper Yuan,  
Radiant is the Numinous Primordial Yang, the Great Emperor of the Purple Tenuity.
