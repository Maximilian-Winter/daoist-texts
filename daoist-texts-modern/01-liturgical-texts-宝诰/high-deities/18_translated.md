# Precious Edict of the Earthly Official, Great Emperor of the Middle Origin

With devoted heart, I turn to pay homage and surrender my life.  
In the azure spirit cavern of yang, within the Northern Capital’s palace,  
He commands forty-two divisions, accompanied by nine million myriad hosts.  

He governs the Three Realms, the Ten Directions, and the Nine Earths;  
He holds sway over the Five Sacred Mountains, the Eight Extremes, and the Four Pillars.  
Breathing out and drawing in yin and yang, he inspects the registers of good and evil, male and female, blue and black;  
With boundless compassion, he nurtures Heaven and Earth, examining the records of all living beings’ fortunes and calamities.  

His law springs forth vast and mighty, yet it can transcend the Nine Netherworlds;  
His great kalpa extends its radiance, capable of erasing myriad sins.  
He is the parent of all creatures, granting grace in life and death alike.  

Great is his compassion and grand his vow;  
Most holy and supremely benevolent,  
The Earthly Official who pardons sins through the seven energies of the Middle Origin,  
The cavernous numinous Azure Void Great Emperor,  
The Azure Spirit Sovereign Lord.
