# Precious Edict of the Water Official, Great Emperor of the Lower Origin

With devoted heart and reverent mind, I bow and take refuge in homage.  
In the radiant valley of the Cavern of Origin, within the Palace of Azure Spirit,  
He commands forty-two divisions, accompanied by nine hundred million multitudes,  
Overseeing the myriad spirits of rivers and waters under the Water Emperor’s sway.  

When the great assembly of floods convenes, and the kalpa of calamity draws near,  
The Sovereign of the Orthodox One’s Law holds the registry of souls, ghosts, and spirits of the long night of death;  
The Master of the Unacting Way records the causes of merit, fault, sin, and blessing among all beings.  

Above, he resolves heavenly disasters, ferrying spirits whose karmic debts are fulfilled;  
Below, he aids the hidden gates, dividing the paths of humans and ghosts.  
Preserving life and death in harmonious peace, his power aids without end.  

Great is his compassion, vast his vow; mighty saint, boundless his mercy.  
The Water Official of the Lower Origin, who unbinds calamity with the Five Qi,  
The Golden Spirit Cavern Yin Great Emperor, the Radiant Valley Sovereign Lord.
