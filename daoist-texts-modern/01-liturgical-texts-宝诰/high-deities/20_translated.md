# Precious Edict of the Fire Official

With a sincere heart, I bow and take refuge in reverence.  
The Four Primordials and Four Ranks, carefully examined, reveal the Fire Official.  
He moves to uphold the vigorous Qian, his virtue harmonizing with the brilliance of Li.  
Dwelling within the Solar Yang Elixir Heaven, he governs the Left Palace, recording the registers of life.  

Great virtue dwells in fire; the Flame Emperor holds the balance.  
His功 merits partake alongside the Three Primordials, his qi circulating through the four months.  
He rides the red dragon, journeying the southern lands, illuminating the palace of Mars;  
He lights the Vermilion Mound, revealing the Elixir Terrace, radiant with the mansion of Wenchang.  

Glorious and resplendent, shining brightly and illuminating all beneath.  
Great compassion and great vow, great sage and great mercy—  
The Red Sovereign, Highest Grade, Three Qi Fire Official, Flame Emperor True Lord,  
Cavern Yang Great Emperor, Southern Elixir Chronicle Longevity Heavenly Venerable.
