# Precious Edict of the Primordial Marshal of Heavenly Strategy

With a devoted heart, I turn and submit in reverent obeisance.  
In the wondrous center of Heaven, to the right of the Luminous Palace,  
Dwells the Marshal who commands the ranks of the Heavenly Spirits,  
Arrayed beneath him are the myriad lords of the Earthly realms.  

Moved by pity for the common folk, lost and wandering in error, forsaking the True,  
He looks up to the Great Light of the Sacred Minister and composes this preface;  
He praises and unfolds the hidden harmonies of the myriad Heavens,  
Recounts and spreads the immortal verses of the Great Brahmaâ€™s celestial script.  

Bowing in compassion to the sincerity of their profound devotion,  
He bestows the mighty power of protection and steadfast support.  
Clouds follow his every step, waves chase the flow of his body;  
Great is his compassion, vast his vow; sublime is his saintly mercy.  

He connects with Heaven in prayer and blessing, extending auspiciousness and cleansing calamity,  
Nurturing and sustaining the life of body and spirit.  
He is the Primordial Marshal of Heavenly Strategy at the Northern Pole,  
The Universal Transforming Heavenly Emperor,  
The Perfected Fruition, Harmonious Response, and Benevolent Heavenly Venerable.
