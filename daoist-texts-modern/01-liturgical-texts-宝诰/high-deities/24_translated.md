# Precious Edict of the Marshal, the Sacred Aide

With utmost sincerity, I bow and take refuge in your name.  
At the imperial gate, your功 is complete, your place among the celestial court established.  
You command the summons of the Three Caverns and the Five Thunders,  
Wielding the balance of the Eight Heavens and the Nine Earths.  

You are the pivot of creation’s mysterious machinery,  
Commander of the true immortals and their officers.  
No evil escapes your sword; what demon dares to oppose?  
You seize the monstrous spirits with mighty force,  
Chase away the spectral fiends like shooting stars.  

Your radiance rivals sun and moon, your might shakes Heaven and Earth.  
Great compassion, great vow, great sage, great mercy—  
You penetrate Heaven’s depths and unravel its blessings,  
Extend auspiciousness and cleanse calamity,  
Protecting body and life with steadfast care.  

You are the Black Executioner, the Sacred Aide of the Northern Pole,  
The Great Marshal of Death,  
The True Lord who preserves celebration and virtue,  
Having attained fruition, you roam the Three Realms as a Heavenly Venerable.
