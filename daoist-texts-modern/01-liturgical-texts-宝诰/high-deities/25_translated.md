# Universal Transformation Precious Decree

With a devoted heart, I bow and take refuge in reverence.  
From the Nine Heavens responds the Primordial Mansion,  
The Supreme Jade Pure King,  
Who shapes transformation to fill the Ten Directions,  
And speaks the dao while seated upon the Nine Phoenixes.  

Above the Thirty-Six Heavens,  
He peruses the treasured registers,  
Examines the jade-like scriptures;  
From fifteen hundred kalpas ago,  
His rank is True and Upright,  
His authority vast in transformation.  

In his hand he raises a golden light of fulfillment,  
Proclaiming the Precious Scripture of the Jade Pivot.  
Those who resist transformation become but subtle dust,  
Issuing commands swift as wind and fire.  

With a pure and tranquil heart, he expands great vows;  
With the power of wisdom, he subdues all demons.  
He commands the Five Thunders in totality,  
Guiding the hearts of the Three Realms.  

Father of all living beings, Master of myriad spirits,  
Great Sage of great compassion,  
Most august, most Dao—  
The Thunderous Universal Transformer, Heavenly Venerable of the Nine Heavens’ Primordial Response.
