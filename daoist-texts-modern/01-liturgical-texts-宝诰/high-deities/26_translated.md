# Precious Edict of the Ancestral Lord of Thunder

With devoted heart, I turn my will and bow in reverent homage.  
High above in the Jade Firmament’s exalted palace,  
Within the cavernous abyss of thunder and storm’s deep court.  
The Three Realms unfold their true divisions,  
While the Nine Heavens weave the grand transformations—  
A convergence of radiance beyond the Great Luo’s veil,  
A boundless expanse of numinous power and wondrous marvels.  

He rescues the lands below from drought and flood,  
Drives away the locusts and plagues that span the kalpas.  
He issues vast vows,  
To benefit and aid all living beings.  

The Great Sage, of boundless compassion and mercy,  
The Great Compassion, Great Vow—  
The Ancestral Lord of Thunder of the Nine Heavens,  
The Heavenly Venerable who dispels calamities and saves all creatures.
