# The Precious Declaration of the Great Unity

With wholehearted devotion, I turn my heart and bow in reverent homage.  
In the exalted pavilion of the Lofty Azure Firmament,  
Within the Purple Tenuity’s Jade Palace,  
Radiance shines forth, lush and solemn;  
Truth condenses into the Supreme Ultimate.  

From the Golden Gate issues forth the wondrous qi,  
Illuminating the Great Transformation within the boundless Chaos.  
It returns the pure breeze to the remnants of the moist and dripping,  
Sustaining and regulating the kalpa’s turning;  
It extends beneficent grace upon the surface of the cosmos,  
Molding and nurturing the humble multitudes.  

The Great Sage, supremely compassionate,  
The Great Mercy, vast in vow,  
The Most High Purple Tenuity Jade Palace of Supreme Clarity,  
The Great Heavenly Emperor of the Great Unity,  
The Heavenly Venerable who sustains and regulates the kalpa.
