# Proclamation of the Cavernous Abyss Treasure

With devoted heart and reverent soul, I bow and surrender.  
In the exalted realm of the Most High Supreme Firmament,  
Dwells the Official of the Cavernous Abyss of the Six Heavens.  
Auspicious signs adorn with solemn majesty,  
Radiant light manifests within the azure expanse of the heavens;  
The true body vast and boundless,  
Spreading wondrous grace across the myriad peoples of Heaven.  

He restrains the demonic spirits of the five palaces,  
Sweeps away the miasma and pestilence of all directions.  
He elevates mortal life toward benevolence and longevity,  
Tenderly governs transformation in the realm of mystery and stillness.  

Great Compassion, Great Vow,  
Great Sage, Great Mercy,  
The Great Emperor of the Cavernous Abyss of the Six Heavens,  
Sublime Sovereign of the Highest One Heaven, Vanquisher of Demons.
