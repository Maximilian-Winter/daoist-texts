# The Precious Edict of the Six Waves

With a devoted heart, I turn and bow in reverent homage.  
In the violet firmament’s highest realm, the Heavenly Palace of the Six Waves unfolds.  
Its wondrous form shines with radiant light, revealing a compassionate visage at the One of Heaven;  
Its imperial abode vast and boundless, bestowing blessings and grace upon the human world.  
It guards against the vast and boundless deluge of cosmic calamity,  
And rescues from the fiery might of returning conflagration.  
It forges and melds myriad streams into unity, harmonizing the principle of the primordial origin.  
The Great Sage, supremely compassionate,  
The Great Mercy, with boundless vow—  
The Sovereign Lord Emperor of the Six Waves of Heaven universally dispenses the dharma’s moistening grace to the Heavenly Venerable.
