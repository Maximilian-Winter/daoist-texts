# General Declaration of the Three Pure Ones

With a devoted heart, I bow and submit my life in reverent homage.  
The treasure of the Dao, the treasure of the scripture, the treasure of the master—  
The Jade Pure, the Supreme Pure, the Grand Pure.  
One Breath flows forth, circulating without ceasing,  
The Three Honored Ones respond and transform.  
Their radiance envelops all in silent brilliance,  
Unspoken, yet through it the four seasons turn.  
True colors vanish into emptiness,  
Limitless, yet from it the Three Realms come into being.  
Above the Great Net Heaven, within the Golden Palace,  
Void and spontaneity abide—  
The Three Pure Ones, the Three Realms, the Three Treasures, the Heavenly Venerables.
