# The Treasure Invocation of the Celestial Survey

With devoted heart, I take refuge and offer reverent obeisance.  
The Purple Mysterious Radiance Pavilion,  
The Palace of the Nine Heavens’ Sustaining Fate.  

The Supreme Dao disperses its light,  
Gathering the Brahma Qi of the Ten Directions;  
True Permanence reveals its wondrous marvels,  
Turning back the vast kalpa’s scorching winds.  

It gathers the myriad heavens,  
Recording virtuous deeds and erasing the register of evil;  
Its grace blends with the ten thousand transformations,  
Inscribing the characters of fortune and bestowing names on new life.  

The Great Sage, Great Compassion,  
Great Mercy, Great Vow—  
The Celestial Surveyor of the Nine Heavens,  
The Vermilion Mound Sovereign,  
The Responding Origin, Sustainer of Fate,  
The Mysterious Transforming Heavenly Venerable.
