# Precious Edict of the Solar Star Lord

With devoted heart, I turn and bow in reverent homage.  
In the Great Luo Heaven above, within the Vermilion Radiance Palace,  
He holds exalted station at the summit of the Ten Extremes,  
His essence and form issuing forth governance;  
His rank stands upright above the Three Powers,  
Commanding virtue and wielding authority.  

Through cold austerity and scorching fire,  
He balances the Six Qi and brings universal peace to myriad nations;  
At dawn’s brightness and twilight’s dimming,  
He rides the Six Dragons to govern the Ten Blossoms.  

He holds the scepter of judgment over good and evil,  
Illuminating all with resplendent radiance;  
He fixes the record of merit and fault, subtle and manifest,  
His responses clear and unmistakable.  

His decrees thunder like lightning, swiftly banishing evil and calamity.  
Great compassion and vast vow,  
Great sage and boundless mercy—  
The Solar Palace’s Sun Yu Yi Emperor Lord,  
His awe-inspiring light spreads virtue,  
His kindly radiance, the Vermilion Sun Heavenly Venerable.
