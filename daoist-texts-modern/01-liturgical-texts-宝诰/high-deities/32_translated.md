# Precious Edict of the Lord of the Great Yin Star

With devoted heart, I turn my life toward you in reverent homage.  
In the Great Luo Heaven above, within the Garden of Seven Treasures,  
You hold the essence of gold and water’s purest spirit,  
Your bearing graceful and elegant, embodying the gentle compliance of the Primordial Earth.  
Your auspicious presence is solemn and majestic,  
Unveiling the divine radiance of the Jade Candle’s light.  

Your household bathes in clear dew,  
You refine the numinous medicine of the Purple Chamber,  
Bestowing upon humanity the gift of long life.  
Though your form is subtle and faint, your true body remains intact and unblemished;  
Your fullness is measured and complete, your luminous brilliance neither waning nor overflowing.  

You examine the ascent and descent of all immortals,  
You preside over the balance of fortunes and offices,  
Commanding the Jade Consort to nurture the sweet dew,  
Urging the springtime bloom of myriad grains,  
Consulting the Azure Maiden to summon the mysterious frost,  
Gathering the autumn harvests of a thousand granaries.  

Your transformative grace extends over Heaven and Earth,  
Your favor spreads throughout the Three Realms.  
Great compassion, great vow—  
Great sage, great mercy—  
In the Moon Palace, you are the Great Lord of the Great Yin,  
The Precious Radiance Illuminating Sovereign,  
Your treasure-light quietly shines like the Tathāgata,  
Marvelous fruit of the White Moon, Heavenly Venerable.
