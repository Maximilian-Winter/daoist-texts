# Declaration of the Central Dipper Treasure

With a devoted heart, I bow and take refuge in reverence.  
Positioned at the very center, it commands the four directions.  
In solemn stillness it dwells, unveiling the vast primordial chaos.  
The four extremities serve as its wings, radiating immense and resplendent light.  

The Seven Luminaries and the Rotating Pivot,  
The two shining orbs concealed in their mysterious support.  
It governs all phenomena, uplifting the cosmic order.  
Strictly marshaling the myriad heavens, the boundless divine homeland.  

It perfects beginning and end, the source of creation and transformation.  
The saint of saints, the numinous among the numinous.  
Encompassing the countless, nurturing all living beings.  
Great compassion and great vow, great sage and great mercy.  

The Great Chief Star Lord,  
The Most True Sovereign of the Vault of Heaven,  
The Central Numinous Boundless Heavenly Venerable.
