# Declaration of the Eastern Dipper Treasure

With devoted heart, I take refuge and bow in reverent homage.  
His功 (merit and power) reach the Purple Tenuity,  
His brilliance shines as Kui and the Radiant Wenchang.  
He commands the numinous forms in the Nine Heavens,  
Steers the divisions of the celestial enclosures among the Two Luminaries.  

The Azure Yang unfolds its grace,  
Encircling the mysterious current of the Milky Way’s profound flow.  
The Jade Axis proclaims the workings,  
Assisting the thunder’s imperial portents.  

He governs with radiant clarity as lightning coils and rainbows soar,  
Responding to transformations as the year’s essence aligns with the Pleiades.  
His embrace brings auspicious prosperity,  
His exaltation surrounds with blessings.  

Great compassion and vast vows,  
Great sagehood and boundless mercy—  
The Supreme Sovereign of the Eastern Extreme,  
The Azure Splendor, Lord of the High Void,  
Unsurpassed in the Six Palaces,  
Extending celebrations, prolonging life and augmenting fortune—  
Heavenly Venerable.
