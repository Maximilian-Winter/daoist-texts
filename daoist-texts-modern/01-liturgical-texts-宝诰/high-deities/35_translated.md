# Precious Edict of the Western Dipper

With utmost sincerity, I bow and submit my heart in reverent homage. Traversing the alchemical origins of the elixir, where clouds align and pure radiance shines forth. Illuminating auspicious brilliance as the imperial throne’s seals are divided; gathering the azure mysteries while celestial streets suspend their wondrous signs. The heavenly chariot moves and rests in harmony, entrusted with the authority over the eastern well and the stone elixir’s power. Withdrawn in steadfast balance, governing the decrees of the southern land’s upper wall. Observing the seven cycles to pass through the gates, measuring the four seasons to receive transformation. Of great compassion and vast vow, supremely sage and infinitely kind. The Great Emperor of the Western Dipper’s Cavern of Yin, luminous star lord presiding over assembled blessings, the True Sovereign of Celebration, the Most Mysterious Embodiment, Dao Heavenly Venerable.
