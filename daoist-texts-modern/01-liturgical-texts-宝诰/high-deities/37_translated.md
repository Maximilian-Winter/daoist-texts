# Precious Edict of the Northern Dipper

With a devoted heart, I bow and take refuge in reverence.  
Illuminating the Three Luminaries, turning back the Five Constants.  
He stands as the pivot of creation and transformation, the sovereign lord of both mortal and divine.  
Proclaiming power across the Three Realms, commanding myriad spirits.  
He judges the appointed time for human good and evil, overseeing the eyes that discern right and wrong in the netherworld.  
Able to absolve all sins, he subdues the demons and spirits.  
Great compassion, great vow; great sage, great mercyâ€”  
The Great Saint of the Central Heaven, the Nine Sovereigns of the Northern Dipper, the Blessed Star Lord who bestows fortune.
