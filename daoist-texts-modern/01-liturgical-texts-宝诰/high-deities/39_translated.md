# Precious Edict of the Star Lord Jumen

With wholehearted devotion, I bow and take refuge in reverence.  
Within the Purple Tenuity Enclosure, deep in the Palace of Earth’s Origin,  
beneath the shadowy yoke of common folk, only the numinous can save—this is the wondrous secret;  
among the sovereigns who serve as arm and sinew, if not by sacred virtue, who else could wield such power?  
He turns the stars of Heaven within the palm of his hand,  
and binds the earth’s malevolent spirits beneath the primal constellations.  
Great compassion, great vow; great saint, great mercy.  
The Great Saint of the Central Heaven,  
the second yin essence of the Northern Dipper—  
the Grand Dao Star Lord Jumen.
