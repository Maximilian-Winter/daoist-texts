# Precious Decree of the Jade Clarity

With a devoted heart, I bow and take refuge in reverence.  
Above the Three Realms, the Brahmanic Qi pervades boundlessly.  
The Supreme Apex, unsurpassed, the Heaven among heavens.  
The Yuluo Xiao Terrace, the Jade Mountainâ€™s Upper Capital.  
Vast and distant, the Golden Palaces shimmer,  
A myriad array, pure and luminous as a crystal pool.  
The Mysterious Primordial One Qi, before Chaos itself,  
Within the treasure pearl, profound beyond profound.  
Illuminating the Three Luminaries,  
Transforming and giving birth to myriad heavens.  
Countless heavenly beings, innumerable beyond measure,  
Turning the Dipper and the Winnowing Basket,  
Circling through the Five Constants.  
The majestic Great Pattern, the ancestor of myriad dao,  
The Great Luo Jade Clarity, Void and Natural,  
The Most True and Wondrous Dao, the Primordial Heavenly Venerable.
