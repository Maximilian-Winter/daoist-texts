# Precious Edict of the Star Lord Lucun

With a devoted heart, I bow and take refuge in reverence.  
Within the Purple Tenuity Enclosure, in the Palace of the Sun’s Origin,  
He molds and tempers yin and yang,  
Watching over the myriad beings born upon the lower earth;  
Turning ceaselessly through day and night,  
He arranges the principles in their proper order throughout the Celestial Circuit.  
No wish goes unfulfilled, and every calamity is swiftly resolved.  
Great compassion, great vow;  
Great Sage, great mercy.  
The Great Sage of the Central Heaven,  
The Third Perfected of the Northern Dipper—  
The Star Lord Lucun, Sovereign of the Great Dao.
