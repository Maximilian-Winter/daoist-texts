# Precious Edict of the Lord of the Literary Star

With devoted heart, I turn my life and bow in reverent homage.  
Within the Purple Tenuity Enclosure, inside the Palace of the Lunar Origin,  
Dwells the sacred spirit of both civil and martial arts—  
The very foundation of the realm ordained by the Vast Heaven.  
Endowed with brilliance and profound wisdom,  
He unfolds the grand design of the Yellow Elder’s vast blueprint.  
He charts the maps of worlds, bringing forth flourishing beings.  
Great Compassion and boundless Vows,  
Supreme Sage and infinite Mercy—  
The Mighty Saint of the Central Heaven,  
The Fourth Star of the Northern Dipper’s Mysterious Darkness,  
The Lord of the Great Dao, the Literary Star Sovereign.
