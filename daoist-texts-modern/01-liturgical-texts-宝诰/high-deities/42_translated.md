# Precious Edict of the Star Lord Lianzhen

With devoted heart, I turn my will and bow in reverent homage.  
Within the Purple Tenuity Enclosure, in the palace of the Primordial River,  
Amid the celestial tracks that traverse the central heavens,  
His eminent virtue soars grandly across the realms;  
He governs the myriad transformations,  
His功 (merit) accomplished, splendid and beautiful throughout the circumpolar sky.  
He wards off calamities and dispels disasters,  
Bringing forth auspiciousness and banishing retrogressions.  
Great compassion, great vow;  
Great sage, great mercy—  
The Central Heaven’s Great Sage,  
The Fifth of the Northern Dipper,  
The Primordial Golden Elixir Star Lord Lianzhen of the Great Dao.
