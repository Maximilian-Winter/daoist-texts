# Precious Edict of the Lord of the Martial Tune Star

With devoted heart, I turn to you in reverent homage.  
Within the Purple Tenuity Enclosure, deep in the Palace of the River’s Origin,  
Your radiance stirs the Three Enclosures,  
A myriad of lights dazzling like scattered pearls and jades;  
Your brilliance enfolds the Great Unity,  
A pure, clear pool reflecting the autumn of the Jade Mirror.  

You are the refuge of all beings,  
The sovereign lord of yin and yang,  
Great Compassion, Great Vow,  
Great Sage, Great Mercy.  

Mid-Heaven’s Great Sage,  
The Sixth of the Northern Dipper,  
The Martial Tune Great Dao Star Lord of the Northern Pole.
