# Precious Edict of the Star Lord Po Jun

With devoted heart, I turn and bow in reverent homage.  
Within the Purple Tenuity Enclosure, deep in the Palace of the Sea’s Origin,  
The Jade Axis spins through the void, sweeping clean the traces of myriad shadows;  
The Golden Bell spreads across the Dipper, silently dispelling the calamities of the six harms.  
Heaven’s grace shines forth clearly, quietly supporting the work of Creation.  
Great compassion and vast vows, the mighty sage and boundless mercy—  
The Great Sage of the Central Heaven, the Seventh Heavenly Gate of the Northern Dipper,  
The Star Lord Po Jun of the Grand Dao.
