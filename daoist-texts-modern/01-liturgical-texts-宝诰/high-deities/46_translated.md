# The Precious Edict of the Star Lord Youbi

With utmost sincerity, I turn my heart and bow in reverent homage. Within the Purple Tenuity Enclosure, in the chamber of the Most High Sovereign,  
His station corresponds to the Three Terraces, commanding the legions of ghosts and spirits;  
His merit regulates the Seven Luminaries, weighing the mechanisms of transformation and principle.  
He regards all with equal grace, universally nourishing the myriad streams of existence.  
Great Compassion, Great Vow; Great Sage, Great Mercyâ€”  
The Great Sage of the Central Heaven, the Ninth Hidden Radiance of the Northern Dipper,  
The Star Lord Youbi of the Great Dao.
