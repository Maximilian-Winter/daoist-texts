# The Precious Edict of the Lord of One’s Life-Star

With a devoted heart, I turn to you in reverent homage. Within the Purple Tenuity Enclosure, deep inside the Southern Pole Palace,  
Each year you descend once more to the mortal realm, arriving precisely at the hour of my birth, when toil and labor bring me forth.  
In the flowing cycle of years, six times you come down to the human world, on the very day when the exalted spirit assumes form.  
You become the sovereign master of the human body, the pivotal hinge of creation’s turning wheel.  
You judge the seasons of good and evil among humankind, and oversee the courts of the underworld, the discerning eye of right and wrong.  
Together with the Five Phases you bear your charge, aligned with the Seven Luminaries’ celestial laws.  
Whosoever prays to you finds no petition unanswered.  
Great Compassion, Great Vow, Great Sage, Great Mercy—  
In the Heavenly Palace of the Northern Dipper’s Celestial Wheel, there is born the Primordial Star-Lord of One’s Life-Star, the Great Dao.
