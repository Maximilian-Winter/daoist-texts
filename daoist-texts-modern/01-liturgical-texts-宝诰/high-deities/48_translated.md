# The Precious Edict of the Three Terraces

With a devoted heart, I bow and take refuge in reverence.  
Within the enclosure of the Great Tenuity’s celestial walls,  
In the heavenly palace upon the stairway of the sky,  
There dwells the sovereign who grasps the breath of emptiness and spontaneity,  
The master who harmonizes yin and yang in perfect accord.  

He manifests the form of three exalted levels,  
Revealing the symbol of twin eyes that see all beneath Heaven.  
Adorned in the imperial robes of solemn pattern, he proclaims the decrees of governance,  
Supporting and veiling the Northern Dipper’s chief star, he presides over the recording of life and death.  

He holds the balance of fortune and virtue in his hand,  
Examining and judging the ascents and descents of all immortals.  
Evenly regulating the six breaths, he secures the peace of the Three Powers—Heaven, Earth, and Humanity.  
He nurtures and brings forth myriad beings,  
Protecting the multitudes within the womb of existence.  

Great is his compassion, vast his vow;  
Mighty is his saintliness, boundless his mercy.  
He drives away demons and binds malevolent spirits,  
Safeguarding life and shielding the body.  

On the upper terrace dwells the spirit of emptiness,  
The Star Lord who opens the virtue of the heavens.  
On the middle terrace dwell the six pure ones,  
The Star Lord who governs the officialdom of the sky.  
On the lower terrace dwells the curved life,  
The Star Lord who oversees fortune and destiny.  

These are the Star Lords of the Three Terraces’ resplendent canopy.
