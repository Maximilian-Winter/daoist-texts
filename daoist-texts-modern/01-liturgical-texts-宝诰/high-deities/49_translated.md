# Precious Edict of the Emperor Wenchang

With heartfelt devotion, I bow and take refuge, paying homage.  
Unassuming within the imperial realm,  
The Jade True One of the Palace of Celebration,  
Manifests the conduct and concealment of ninety-eight transformations,  
Revealing countless myriad kinds of numinous marvels.  

Like a flying luan bird unfolding creation everywhere,  
He grants the wish-fulfilling salvation through kalpa after kalpa, giving life anew.  
Utmost filial piety and supreme benevolence—  
His merit endures across Confucianism, Daoism, and Buddhist teachings.  

Neither prideful nor joyous,  
He fulfills his duties to Heaven, Earth, and the Water Official.  
His功德 (merit and virtue) are beyond measure,  
His威灵 (power and numinosity) unfathomable.  

Great compassion, great vow,  
Great sage, great mercy—  
He assists the primordial in the Nine Heavens,  
Opening transformation as the sovereign ruler.  

Overseeing fortunes and the office of tribute is the True Lord,  
Whose sevenfold winding responses protect virtue and expand benevolence—the Great Emperor.  

He expounds the scriptures and unfolds the teachings,  
Dispelling kalpas and enacting transformation,  
Granting rebirth and eternal life—the Heavenly Venerable.
