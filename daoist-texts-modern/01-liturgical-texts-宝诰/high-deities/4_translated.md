# Supreme Clarity Precious Decree

With utmost sincerity, I turn my heart and bow in reverent homage. Dwelling within the realm of Supreme Clarity, he is named the Lord of the Numinous Treasure. Born from the ancestral kalpa of transformation, he commands over ninety-nine thousand nine hundred and more breaths of Brahma’s qi; his crimson script shines forth, inscribed with six hundred and sixty-eight authentic characters. Through the primal chaos of the crimson script, he opened the Nine Heavens; by marking the primordial jade calendar, he divided the Five Kalpas. The celestial scriptures and earthly weavings stand majestic as the very root of creation; the pivot of yin and yang’s mechanism, he is the unmatched ancestor of thunder’s might. Great compassion and great vow, great sage and great mercy—he is the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Venerable, the Dao Lord of the Jade Palace.
