# The Precious Edict of the Star of Primacy

With devoted heart, I bow and submit myself in reverent homage.  
The sovereign vigor of Kui Gang, the primal essence of Kui Bi—  
From the twin poles they gather brilliance, the Five Phases uphold their virtue.  
Upholding the flourishing of letters and culture, he dwells within the subtle enclosure of the Twenty-Eight Constellations.  

He examines the ranks of scholars, discerning the virtuous deeds of thirty-six thousand souls.  
By the grace of merit, he blinds the eyes of emptiness in the void;  
By the power of hidden works, he nods in secret approval.  

He opens the dull nature to wisdom’s light,  
He awakens the confused heart to keen insight.  
Broadly he spreads the transformative power of filial piety, friendship, and letters,  
Assisting and endorsing the authority of honor, rank, and reward.  

In the arenas of civil and martial affairs, within the gardens of spring and autumn,  
He drums the brush that soars like phoenixes, radiant with color;  
He shaves the beard and casts off the plain robe to ascend the ladder of glory.  

He judges the golden list within the Seven-Twisting Heavenly Palace,  
Weighs the jade register in the fragrant laurel halls of the treasured palace.  

Great compassion and great vows, great benevolence and great might—  
He bestows wisdom to communicate with the numinous, supporting letters and aiding the dao.  
He is the Lord of the Kui Dipper Star, the Wood Lodge of the East.
