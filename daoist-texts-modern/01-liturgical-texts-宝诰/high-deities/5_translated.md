# Precious Edict of the Great Clarity

With utmost sincerity, I bow and submit my heart in reverent homage.  
Adapting teachings to each place and time, through kalpas uncounted, guiding souls across the vast currents of existence.  
A master to emperors, a teacher to sovereigns, a guide to kings—assuming borrowed names and changing titles as the moment demands;  
Establishing the dao of Heaven, the dao of Earth, the dao of Humanity—concealing the sage, revealing the mundane.  

Overseeing the twelve hundred lords of office, encompassing the myriad billions of layers of sacred breath.  
Manifesting transformation through past and present, inscribing the dao and virtue in no less than five thousand words;  
Commanding yin and yang, wielding thunder and lightning by the power of the nine and five.  

Great Compassion, Great Vow; Great Sage, Great Mercy—  
The Most High Venerable of the Dao, the Heavenly Worthy of Virtue, the Grand Elder Lord Supreme.
