# General Edict of the Four Sovereigns

With heartfelt devotion, I bow and take refuge in reverent homage.  
Beyond reach, the Violet-Golden Gate stretches vast and boundless,  
Lofty and majestic stands the Jade Palace of shimmering brilliance.  
Here, the power over the Seven Governance of the Purple Tenuity is held,  
The sovereign of the imperial cycle, the master of the singular lineage.  

From the Three Radiances springs forth exquisite grace,  
The Five Canopies wave their iridescent banners on high.  
This is the pivot of creation’s grand mechanism,  
The mighty scepter wielded by gods and humans alike.  

Above, in the Great Net of Heaven, within the Golden Gate’s palace,  
Reside the Four Sovereigns, the Four August Highest Emperors,  
Their countenances radiant as gold, their forms resplendent as jade,  
The Celestial Venerables who govern the heavens with august dignity.
