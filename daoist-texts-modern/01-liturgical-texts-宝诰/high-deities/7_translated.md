# The Heavenly Sovereign’s Precious Edict

With devoted heart and reverent soul, I bow and surrender myself in homage.  
At the Purple Tenuity’s imperial throne, within the Heavenly Palace of Gouchen,  
Amidst the Nine Radiances’ treasured gardens, above the Mysterious Capital of the Five Phases,  
Dwells the Primordial Sovereign, who aids and governs the numinous transformations;  
He unites the Two Extremes and harmonizes the Three Realms’ principle.  

He presides over the balance of arms and warfare, extending vast virtue;  
He commands the courses and stations of the stars, never losing the eternal ordinance.  
His lofty image towers majestic, his true primordial power vast and boundless.  
Great Compassion, Great Vow, Great Sage, Great Mercy—  
The Great August Emperor of Gouchen, Heavenly Sovereign of the Upper Palace.
