# Proclamation of the Star Sovereign

With devoted heart, I bow and submit my life in reverent homage.  
In the great celestial palace of the Grand Luo Heaven, within the Purple Tenuity Star Court,  
There dwells the august one who reigns supreme at the lofty North Pole,  
Whose station is fixed at the very center above the heavens.  

By sacred law, he bears the name Golden Wheel of Blazing Splendor;  
By the dao, he is hailed as the Jade Dipper, the Mysterious Venerable.  
The Celestial Pivot and Jade Balance align the Seven Celestial Administrations;  
He governs the heavenly scriptures and earthly patterns, weaving the sun and moon’s courses.  

The constellations are bound by his ordinance, the four seasons march in their appointed ways,  
The Yellow Path and Purple Enclosure unfold beneath his watchful gaze—  
Master of myriad phenomena, sovereign over all the heavens.  

He is the Great Compassion, the Great Vow, the Most Sacred and Most Benevolent,  
Lord of the Myriad Stars’ teachings, the Primordial Emperor of Limitlessness,  
The Central Heaven’s Purple Tenuity, the Great Emperor of the Northern Pole.
