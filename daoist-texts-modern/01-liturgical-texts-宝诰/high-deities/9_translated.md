# Sacred Edict of the Queen of the Earth

With heartfelt devotion, I bow and take refuge in reverence.  
The Nine Glorious Jade Palaces, the Seven-Treasure Imperial Chambers—  
Here is the appointed time granted by Heaven’s mandate,  
Where the sovereign holds the balance of yin and wields the scepter of yang.  

The Dao, exalted and vast, unfolds in majestic radiance;  
Its virtue and measure lie stored within gentle compliance, smoothness, and steadfastness.  
Imitating the Vast Heaven’s grandeur, it nurtures the wondrous root of Earth’s primal origin;  
Flowing through forms and myriad beings, it manifests the motherly Dao’s compassion.  

The great mountains and rivers stand as its foundation,  
All hills and streams bow in humble submission.  
With boundless compassion and great vows,  
With supreme holiness and profound mercy,  
It follows Heaven’s example—  
The Queen of the Earth, august sovereign of land and spirits.
