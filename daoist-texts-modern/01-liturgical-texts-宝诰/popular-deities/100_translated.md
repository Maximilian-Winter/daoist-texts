# Precious Edict of the Ingenious Holy Immortal Master

With utmost sincerity, I bow and take refuge, offering reverent homage.  
Wondrous craft wrought by divine hands, as if shaped by spirits and demons—  
a singular genius of the artisan’s heart.  
He sets the compass and square, measuring roundness and straightness;  
fixes the standard and rule, gauging level and true.  

He invents the saw and plane, great works of earth and timber arise;  
with skillful chisel and brilliant polish, lofty halls soar, their eaves like hanging cups.  
His art crowns all under Heaven, outshining even the marvels of the Dao.  
Great wheels and mighty axles, his achievements surpass both ancient and modern.  

Supreme wisdom and profound insight, unmatched skill and numinous power—  
the Ingenious Holy Immortal Master, the nation’s guiding teacher,  
the venerable Patriarch Lu Ban.
