# Proclamation of the Great Spirit Guardian of Birth in the Nine Heavens

With devoted heart, I bow and surrender my life in reverent homage.  
Descendants of the Eastern Peak, attend the record: the Office of Birth Guardians in the Nine Heavens.  
They weave the exquisite essence into the forming embryo,  
Receiving the creative power of the twin forces—yin and yang—in cosmic transformation.  

They escort life into the world and safeguard the birth,  
Upholding the sacred framework ordained by the two august sages.  
Harmonizing the yin and yang with perfect balance,  
Dispelling and guiding the course of smallpox and measles alike.  

The Nine Heavens proclaim their joyous praise,  
Viewing all with equal grace and impartial regard.  
Great compassion and vast vows,  
Great saintliness and boundless mercy.  

Universally aiding and delivering all beings,  
The Bright and Primal True Lord, Guardian of Birth in the Nine Heavens.  
Many sons and many daughters,  
The Holy Mother Sovereign of the Nine Heavens’ Protective Chambers.
