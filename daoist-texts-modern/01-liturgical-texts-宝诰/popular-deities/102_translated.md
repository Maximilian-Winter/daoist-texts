# General Edict of Thunder and Lightning

With utmost sincerity, I bow and submit my vow.  
The Commander of Thunder and Lightning, the Supreme Marshal,  
The myriad officials of talismans and sacred registers, all lords of the dao,  
Suddenly the Fire Decree is issued by Marshal Deng,  
The fierce officer with silver teeth, Lord Xin of Heaven,  
Swift as the wind, the messenger Zhang speeds forth,  
The azure-toothed, iron-faced Lord Liu of Heaven,  
Generals Ma, Guo, Fang, Deng, and Tian stand firm,  
The Thunder Mansionâ€™s Jiang, Bi, and Hua, masters of thunder and lightning,  
Pang, Liu, Gou, and Bi, wondrously potent in divine power,  
Wen, Kang, Yue, and Meng, manifesting awe-inspiring numinous might,  
The Spiritual Officials, the two marshals Wang and Ma,  
The Earthly Official, the Grand General Yin of the Grand Cycle,  
The Fire Rhinoceros of the Thunder Mansion, Marshal Zhu,  
Within the Dipper, the two thunder gods Zhuan and Ba,  
Heavenly Physicians who attack the qi and heal disease,  
The host of spirits at the Fengdu Mansion,  
City Walls and Earth God, the social lord and the merit recorder,  
The Divine Tigers, He and Qiao, the two Way Spirits,  
Arrayed in ranks, their banners rustle like a forest on left and right,  
Standards and flags flash, illuminating Heaven and Earth,  
Swords, halberds, spears, and pikes ever in hand,  
Spears, knives, axes, and battle cleavers all accompany them closely.  

Should any evil descend to obstruct the Great Dao,  
They seize and drag them to the Thunder Prison to enact swift justice,  
Sweeping away the fierce winds to welcome the imperial carriage,  
Supporting the dao and its methods to save the good people.  

Now I issue this summons, hoping you will come forth,  
Bestowing great thunderous might to shield and uphold all.
