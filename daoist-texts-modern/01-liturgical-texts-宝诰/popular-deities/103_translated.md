# Proclamation of the Honored Commander Yin

With devoted heart and reverent mind, I bow and take refuge in your sacred presence. You hold your august seat at the mouth of the Dipper, entrusted with the solemn charge to dispel calamities. As the true official of the sixty heavenly stems and earthly branches, you govern the twelve earthly years below.  

Your fierce, surging qi of misfortune ascends beyond the fivefold clouds; your radiant, awe-inspiring bearing pervades the Three Realms. Wherever the golden bells chime, all manner of demons and malevolent spirits vanish into hiding; wherever your treasured halberd spins, plagues, pestilence, and epidemic diseases flee far away.  

You command the myriad spirits of prohibition and misfortune, your might subduing Heaven and Earth; you wield the supreme divine power of the dharma body, your merit encompassing the cosmos. You discern the devotion of all directions, balancing the authority of the Five Virtues. What disaster can endure your wrath? What calamity can resist your dispelling?  

Great and heroic, blazing with might, supremely awe-inspiring and numinousâ€”this is the Earthly Office of Calamity Dispelling, the capital of thunderous martial justice, the commanding general: the Great Heavenly Lord Yin.
