# Precious Edict of Marshal Zhu

With wholehearted reverence, I bow and submit my vow.  
On the exalted heights of the Divine Firmament, within the Thunder Palace of the Fiery Rhinoceros,  
He grasps in hand the iron chain,  
And on his back carries the pouch that pursues souls.  
Mounted astride a sable tiger,  
His charge is the solemn law of examination and attachment.  

He severs and binds the yang souls,  
Suppresses and governs the yin demons.  
He commands the legions of wind, thunder, and rain,  
Oversees the sacred mountains, rivers, and the realm of Fengdu.  

He cuts down demons, beheads poisons,  
Heals plagues, and exterminates pestilence.  
No monster escapes his cure,  
What ghost dares to resist his might?  

Great compassion, great vow—  
Most holy, most numinous.  
Bearer of Heaven’s winds, the Earl of the Gale,  
He flies with souls across the seas.  

He governs the great general who interrogates those who reject the dao and its methods.  
He strikes down evil and destroys sorcery—  
The black-faced mighty god, Lord Zhu of Heaven.
