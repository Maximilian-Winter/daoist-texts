# Marshal Zhao’s Precious Edict

With a devoted heart, I bow and take refuge in your presence.  
Your numinous communication unfolds vast and grand,  
Your sacred virtue shines forth with radiant clarity.  
You condensed your form at the primal dawn of the Great Brahma,  
Manifesting through the boundless ages without end.  

Holding the whip and tether,  
You master the tiger and subdue demons,  
Soaring through the Three Realms, causing ghosts and spirits to tremble,  
With but a single breath, the heavens and earth resound.  

Your majestic light gleams brilliantly; none who wish remain unheeded.  
Your profound mirror shines with spiritual clarity; all petitions are answered.  

You rescue living beings from suffering and illness,  
Protect the peace and stability of family and nation,  
Praising the dao and its methods in endless perpetuity,  
Truly governing the mysterious winds through eternal kalpas.  

Great compassion and vast vows,  
Great sage and boundless mercy,  
Supporting Heaven’s broad holiness,  
The Great Divine Lord of Harmonious Will and Utmost Power.
