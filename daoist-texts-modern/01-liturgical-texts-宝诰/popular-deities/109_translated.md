# Precious Edict of the Sovereign Spirit Official

With a devoted heart, I bow and take refuge in reverence.  
He is the Primordial Commander of Heaven, the Divine Lord of the One Breath.  
The Great Numinous Official who governs the celestial corrections of the entire Heaven,  
A fierce and impartial marshal of the Three Realms.  

With golden eyes and vermilion hair, he is known as the Thunder Lord of the Three and Five Fire Chariots.  
His beak like a phoenix’s, his teeth like silver fangs, he commands a million fierce pixiu spirits.  
Soaring through clouds and mists, his voice thunders like lightning.  
He summons rain and clears the skies, driving away evil and healing disease.  

He observes faults and errors over twelve years, entrusted by the Jade Emperor’s decree.  
Accumulating merits and achievements in countless myriad forms, he vows to assist the Patriarch.  
Utterly firm and supremely brave, he saves the dying and rescues the living.  
Everywhere he unfolds the teachings, opening altars in every place.  

The fierce marshal who scatters and strikes, the Three and Five Fire Chariots—  
The Heavenly Venerable of Great Unity, the Thunder God who manifests in response.
