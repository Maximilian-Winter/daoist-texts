# The Precious Edict of Heavenly Lord Ma

With utmost sincerity, I bow and take refuge in reverence.  
He of the Dipper’s Mouth, Chief Spirit,  
Commander upon the Starry Pivot,  
Three heads upright and unyielding,  
Manifesting the radiant form that shines from the Three Terraces,  
Nine eyes blazing with brilliance,  
Bearing the seal of the Nine Dipper’s luminous splendor,  
Wielding the golden qi of the Western Numinous Realm,  
His feet tread upon the White Serpent,  
Adorned with the awe-inspiring numinosity of the Southern Pole,  
His back bears the flying Vermilion Crow,  
Entrusted to transform within the soaring Wind and Fire Court,  
Solely commanding the Heavenly Gang of the Northern Pole.  

With treasured sword and jeweled bells,  
He sweeps away all demons and monsters without mercy,  
The imperial bell and dharma seal in hand,  
Wherever he moves, spirits and ghosts all submit.  
Following the Zitong, he presides over Literary Balance,  
Assisting the Purple Tenuity in governing fortunes and fate.

Great saint, great might,  
Exalted in the High Divine Firmament,
