# Proclamation of the Lord of the Passes of Heaven

With devoted heart, I bow and take refuge in reverence.  
The Great Sage, the Vanquisher of Demons,  
Who patrols the Three Realms with vigilant eyes.  
He is the executioner of ghosts and spirits, the commanding envoy,  
The seeker and captor of phantoms throughout the Three Realms.  

From the Primordial One Qi arises,  
The Seven-Ranked Great General who subdues dragons and tigers,  
The Venerable True Lord who guards the nation in majestic peace.  

With thunderous decrees he moves,  
The mighty envoy who punishes evil and summons justice.  
Commander of the Thirty-Six Thunders,  
The Censor of the Punishment Platform in the Capital of Darkness.  

He oversees the ghosts and spirits of the Three Realms,  
The grand adjudicator of the courts of punishment and law.  
He commands the cases of justice,  
The Mighty Heavenly Spirit of the Divine Firmament.  

Commander of all armies in the Three Realms,  
The great envoy who summons the troops.  
He governs Heaven and Earth,  
The Marshal of the Passes who slays gods and demons alike,  
The Heavenly Venerable of Supreme Fruition and High Certainty.
