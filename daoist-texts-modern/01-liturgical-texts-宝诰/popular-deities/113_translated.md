# Precious Edict of the Venerable Lord Wen Tianjun

With devoted heart, I bow and take refuge in your command. You are the Supreme General of the Heavenly Court, the True Deity of the Earthly Palace. Your wondrous dao unites all beings, bestowing blessings from the village of Spotted Bamboo; your virtue soars high, sacrificing self, granting waves of grace within the Golden Palace.  
Adorned with a crown of jade blossoms, you pass through Heaven’s gate unhindered;  
In your hand, you wield the ringed mace, unbound across the vast celestial expanse.  
You hold dominion over the Nine Netherworlds, swiftly executing the records of mortal fate;  
You bear the rank of chief among the divine generals of the Five Sacred Mountains.  
Your righteous qi blazes brilliantly, your numinous power radiates with awe-inspiring splendor.  
Great heroism, great might; great virtue, great compassion.  
Before the Jade Emperor’s hall, you stand as the Left Kang Metal Star,  
Assisting the numinous and manifesting martial prowess as the Grand Commander Wen of the Spiritual Host.
