# Precious Edict of Marshal Yue

With a heart devoted and reverent, I bow and submit my vow.  
Three peaks rise towering, grasping in hand the Divine Spear of Dripping Springs;  
Five divisions stand aligned at the brow, clad in silver armor like falling snow.  
Before the throne, the Marshal commands; within the hall, the General leads.  

Above, he governs the mighty celestial legions of the Nine Heavens;  
Below, he rules the five prisons, the guilty ghosts, and wandering souls.  
In the Three Realms, all who seek his aid find manifest transformation;  
Throughout the Ten Directions, his summons and commands are faithfully fulfilled.  

Loyalty shines like the sun, the eternal standard for ministers of all ages;  
Filial piety flows like the wind, the timeless teaching for children’s duties.  
His numinous might reveals itself in Jinling City, unchanging through a thousand autumns;  
His merits inscribed in Zhuxian Town, enduring for a hundred generations.  

Beneath his seat, thirty-two generals break bandits and purge treachery;  
At his side, five hundred young warriors capture demons and seize monsters.  
All beings bear virtue and the myriad families revere him with awe.  

Utmost in strength and courage, utmost in filial love and compassion,  
Founder of peaceful rule, Supreme General who subdues demons.  
The loyal and valiant Lord Wu Mu, the righteous and brave Great Inspector;  
Rescuer of the people, upright and known as the Junior Protector;  
Protector of the realm, selfless and honored as King E.  

Great compassion and great vow, great saint and great mercy—  
Before the Jade Emperor’s palace, he also governs as the Right Prime Minister,  
The Virtuous Sovereign of the Dao, the Boundless Universal Savior,  
The Sublime Heavenly Venerable of the Marvelous Dharma.
