# Precious Edict of the Marshal of the Central Altar

With devoted heart, I take refuge and bow in reverence.  
Arising as the sacred general of the Zhou, the vanguard that vanquished the tyrant Zhou,  
Enveloped in golden radiance forged within the cavern’s depths,  
From the Jade Void heeding the summons to descend upon Chentang.  

In his left hand, he wields the golden ring;  
In his right, the pointed spear;  
Beneath his feet blaze twin wheels of sun-fire and sun-wind,  
Driving away demons, destroying monsters, severing the kings of evil.  

He has personally endured one thousand seven hundred vast kalpas,  
Attaining the fullness of the Dao’s fruit,  
Shattering through thirty-eight thousand wicked formations,  
Eternally guarding the Heavenly Palace.  

One single lotus blossom,  
Transforms into a solemn and wondrous manifestation.  

Throughout the Ten Directions of the worlds,  
He broadly aids and rescues, a compassionate vessel ferrying those in suffering.  

His profound numinous功 is unfathomable,  
His transformations boundless,  
Ascending earth and Heaven in the blink of an eye.  

Facing foes without fear,  
Majestic and imposing in might,  
Great in loyalty and filial piety,  
Utmost in courage and strength,  
He pacifies the people and protects the realm—  
The Heavenly Venerable Marshal of the Central Altar.
