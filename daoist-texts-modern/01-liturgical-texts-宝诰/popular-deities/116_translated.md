# The Precious Edict of Marshal Kang

With sincere heart, I bow and take refuge in reverence.  
Under the command of the Venerable Heavenly Lord, True Warrior Emperor,  
there serves the Heavenly Venerable Marshal Kang, Great and Mighty.  

His face aflame with crimson, lips like vermilion,  
his brows divided into eight radiant hues.  
His majestic bearing solemn and earnest,  
his long beard flowing like five dragons entwined.  

Brave and vigorous beyond all peers,  
his spirit shines with divine light, his presence charged with lofty vigor.  
He roams and patrols across Heaven and Earth,  
his hand wielding a golden mace of power.  

He hunts down the sinister mists,  
subdues demons and captures strange monsters.  
He watches over human relations with vigilant care,  
protecting and blessing the virtuous and upright.  

By the dharma’s grace, he aids the Emperor,  
upright and impartial in all his dealings.  
He favors only the doors of goodness,  
with great compassion and vast vows,  
a great sage endowed with boundless mercy.  

The Northern Pole’s Mysterious Heavenly Highest Emperor,  
Marshal Kang of the Left Division,  
a resplendent and illustrious Heavenly Venerable.
