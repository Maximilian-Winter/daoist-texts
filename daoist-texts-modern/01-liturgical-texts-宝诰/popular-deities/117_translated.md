# Precious Edict of the Marshal of the High Origin

With heartfelt devotion, I bow and take refuge in reverence.  
At the Purple Tenuity’s imperial apex, the Primordial Essence of Great Unity,  
Reciting and entrusting within the Azure Forest, I encounter the Medicine Master who initiates transformation.  
Secretly transmitting the alchemical cauldron, reviving humans and beasts to bring tranquil healing.  

Favored and embraced by the grace of the imperial court, amidst the crossing of life’s wounds and trials.  
Receiving the protection of the Primordial Chaos, presenting the commendation of the Jade Minister of Heaven.  
Commanding the Golden Basin to govern yin and yang’s nurture, bestowing the treasured sword to divide male and female births.  

Crowned by Heaven and Sun to forge destiny, cradling the infant with abundant grace.  
Great benevolence and vast virtue, supremely heroic and fiercely radiant.  
Sealed by jade from the Nine Heavens, bestowed upon the qilin guardian who oversees life’s birth—  
The Golden Basin’s envoy, the Marshal of the High Origin who sends forth children.
