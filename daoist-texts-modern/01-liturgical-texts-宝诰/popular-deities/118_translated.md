# The Precious Edict of the Marshal of the Three Fields

With utmost sincerity, I bow and take refuge in reverence.  
Delighting in the extension of the Three Divisions,  
Soaring proudly upon the Ten Lotus Petals.  

Striking the notes of the music, the crimson plum blossoms burst forth in bloom;  
Performing the sacred melodies, the colorful phoenix soars in graceful flight.  

Dwelling in samadhi amidst playful delight,  
Subduing the fiendish spirits with gentle mastery;  
Turning the seven refuges to heal the festering sores,  
Dispelling calamities and banishing afflictions.  

The Jade Statutes and Golden Decrees, the judicial records of the Law,  
The Two Modes and Eight Trigrams unfold the command banners.  

Sent forth as envoy to patrol before the Jade Emperor’s palace,  
Bearing the treasured mandate, wielding authority to reward and punish;  
Within the Purple Mist Palace, praising and establishing merit.  

Piercing the righteous qi through the clouds and skies,  
Returning the primordial essence to the winged constellations.  

His dharma name is the Great Sage of Song and Dance,  
His dao title is the Venerable One of Harmonious Joy.  

He commands a million youthful souls,  
The sacred assembly united within the Dipper’s harmony;  
With great compassion and grand vows, he transforms the noble and the heroic.  

The inspector of the Nine Heavens,  
The commander who guides the illustrious marquis,  
Marshal of the Three Fields of Wind and Fire.
