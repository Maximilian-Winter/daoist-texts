# General Yang Si’s Precious Edict

With devoted heart, I bow and take refuge in reverence.  
Before Heaven’s birth, the Dao nurtured and transformed all;  
In youthful days, he attained the dao.  
In the watery realm of the Abyssal Deep,  
He stilled the winds and waves to ease boats and carts.  

Within the Gate of the Three Heavens,  
He commands talismans and orders to dispel plague and govern evil.  
Clad in golden armor and white robes,  
His axe and halberd raised high,  
He cleaves dragons and vanquishes monsters—  
His numinous might responds with wondrous power.  

His sacred deeds repeatedly manifest at Dongting,  
His potent grace flows through the lands of Sichuan and Hubei.  
No prayer goes unanswered; his virtue shelters the people.  
Great Sage, Great Compassion,  
Utmost justice and utmost courage.  

Upon the Purple Cloud Terrace,  
He slew the dragon and attained the dao.  
The numinous source grants aid and salvation—  
General Yang Si.
