# The Precious Edict of the Five Directions’ Wealth Deities

With devoted heart and reverent bow, I take refuge and pay homage.  
Their fragrant virtues shine forth amid the purple mists,  
Their merits and grace inscribed upon golden steles for all time.  

A lifetime of purity and integrity, their accumulated virtue runs deep.  
Their whole being upright and just, their compassion layered and profound.  
When faced with gain, they ponder righteousness—worthy to rule through countless ages.  

Not coveting is their treasure, deserving to enjoy eternal fragrant honor.  
Great compassion, great vows, a perfectly impartial will suffused with benevolence.  

They oversee all the world’s streams of wealth,  
Boundlessly increasing blessings and augmenting fortunes.  

These are the Great True Lords, the Wealth Deities of the Five Directions and Five Roads.
