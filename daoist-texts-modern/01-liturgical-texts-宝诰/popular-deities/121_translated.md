# Precious Edict of the Holy Mother of Vision

With devoted heart, I take refuge and offer reverent obeisance.  
In the Great Luo Heaven above, dwells the Primordial Divine Maiden.  
Her wondrous form adorned with solemn grace, a golden body wondrously manifest.  
She ascends amid clouds and rosy mists, auspicious clouds drifting gently by.  

Her radiance fills the full moon’s glow, the immortal countenance shining bright,  
In tranquil boundless void, she reveals herself to the human realm.  
Her virtue matches yin and yang, her blessings nurture Heaven, Earth, and the Three Realms.  
She is the pivot of myriad spirits in the human world,  
Opening the gates to flourishing divine light upon the earth.  

In the pure and quiet cosmos, she descends to bestow blessings and dispel calamities.  
The Three Realms rejoice and acclaim her, free from greed and partiality.  
She saves the suffering and rescues the distressed,  
Universally aiding and ferrying all across the great river of tribulation.  

Great compassion, vast vows,  
Great saintliness, boundless mercy—  
In the Eastern Peak’s Heavenly Immortal Palace,  
She is the Radiant Sovereign of the Two Poles.
