# Precious Edict of the Four Duty Officers of Merit

With devoted heart and reverent mind, I bow and take refuge in this teaching.  
They are the messengers who transmit the written decrees, the heroes who present petitions.  
Manifesting virtue across the Three Realms, administering merit within the Four Palaces.  

Clad in golden helmets and silver armor,  
Grasping white swords with azure blades.  
Mounted upon steeds, they at times descend into the Earthly Palace,  
At times tread the clouds and step upon the mist to ascend the Heavenly Court.  

When rituals are set and fasts observed, everywhere they rely on these steeds to inspect and discern.  
Recording merit and noting faults, each matter entrusted to spirits to reach full comprehension.  

Through the twelve months of the year, their spirits labor month by month.  
Within each day’s twelve hours, their diligent work never ceases.  

They bring down new scriptures to turn back the waning customs of the age,  
Facing the mortal world to rescue its failing winds.  

They repel the evil and uphold what is right,  
Bestowing blessings and transforming misfortune.  

Great compassion, great vows,  
Great numinosity, great responsiveness—  
These are the Four Duty Officers of Merit, the messengers who transmit the written word.
