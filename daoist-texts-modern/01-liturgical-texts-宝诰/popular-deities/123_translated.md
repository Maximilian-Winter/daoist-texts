# Precious Edict of the Dragon King

With utmost reverence and a heart bowed in surrender, I pay homage.  
The sea pours forth as palace halls,  
Jade isles extend blessings far and wide.  
Descendant of Heavenâ€™s pure lineage,  
Vast and boundless is the sovereign decree,  
Charged to uphold the Three Heavens,  
Commanding and governing myriad spirits;  
Heart united with the Heavenly Mother,  
Compassionate and all-encompassing toward ten thousand beings.  

The waves lie tranquil and serene,  
Never allowed to overflow into rivers and streams;  
Scales and fins dive deep in silence,  
Forbidden to surge and poison the world.  

Vastly embracing the chariot that points the way south,  
Profoundly nourishing the marsh where righteousness dwells.  
Divine power pervades without limit,  
Great virtue spreads wide and far.  
Boundless mercy, grand vows,  
Supreme sage, infinite kindness.  

All the heroes of the Nine Seas,  
Noble scions and divine kings,  
The Celestial Sovereign who moves freely without hindrance.
