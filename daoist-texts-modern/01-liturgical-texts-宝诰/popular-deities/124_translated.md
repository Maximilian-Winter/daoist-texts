# The Precious Edict of Zhong Kui

With utmost sincerity, I bow and take refuge.  
A scholar of Zhongnan, General Who Guards the Realm.  
His voice roars like thunder bursting forth, shattering the mountains and valleys of evil;  
His eyes flash like mighty lightning, encircling the imperial palace walls.  

Together with the venerable Duke Jingde of Qin, he serves as the Captain who commands demons,  
Alongside the gods Shentu and Yulei, devouring ghosts and specters.  
He commands three thousand ghostly soldiers—  
Their howls strike terror, causing chimeras and spirits to lose heart and flee in dread.  

He drives forth a million divine warriors—  
Phantoms and goblins shiver, their souls paling in cold fear.  
His name is inscribed on the Tiger’s Roll,  
Protecting the Dragon Palace’s sacred enclosure.  

Bestowed by imperial grace as Top Scholar,  
His office sealed as Metropolitan Judge.  
His illustrious renown shines brilliantly,  
His awe-inspiring numinous power dazzling all.  

Later appointed Colonel over the Nine Provinces’ islands,  
Each isle under his vigilant inspection.  
Granted authority over the summer season,  
Guardian god of transformation and protection.  

Great General who dispels evil and severs demons,  
The Iron-Faced Divine Lord of Zhongnan,  
Heavenly Venerable who sweeps away the miasma of monsters.
