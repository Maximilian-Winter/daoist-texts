# The Precious Edict of the Immortal Master Yue Lao

With utmost sincerity, I bow and take refuge in your grace. Beneath the full moon’s gentle glow, where lovers reunite, beneath the tree of longing, within the hall of betrothal—there you preside. You hold the marriage contracts of all under Heaven, weaving the bonds of union that stretch across a thousand leagues.  

With compassionate brows and a single knowing glance, you ensure that those with true affection become lifelong companions. A single red thread, once drawn, cannot escape the fate forged through three lifetimes of karmic ties. Leaning on your staff, pouch at your side, you journey tirelessly through mists, clouds, and radiant dawns.  

Your face is both youthful and aged like the crane’s plumage, transcending the passions of love and the sorrows of hatred. Great Sage, boundless in mercy; vast in kindness, immense in vow—you draw the fates, guide the threads. The Elder beneath the moon, the honored deity who unites marriages and joins destinies in perfect accord.
