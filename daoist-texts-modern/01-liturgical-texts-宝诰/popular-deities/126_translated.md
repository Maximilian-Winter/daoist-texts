# The Precious Edict of the Harmonizing Pair of Immortals

With utmost sincerity, I bow and take refuge in reverence.  
Upon the clouded steps of the jade terraces, within the Harmonizing Immortal Palace,  
Graceful and serene, the sacred path is held in a childlike heart.  
Laughing and playing, untouched by the world’s scattering sorrows,  
They hold in hand the lotus box, aiding reunion and wholeness.  

Their divine powers vast, they traverse the Three Realms,  
Harmonizing myriad affairs throughout the Ten Directions.  
Their precious name proclaimed far and wide,  
Bringing perfect joy to the marriages of men and women.  

At the mysterious altar, erected with solemn care,  
One may seek blessings for prosperous markets and heartfelt wishes.  
With bowed heads and reverent worship,  
Parted hairpins may be joined anew, restored to their matching crowns.  

Incense burns in offering, fragrant and pure,  
Shattered mirrors scattered may be made whole again.  
When the household is harmonious, all affairs flourish;  
When the people are united, all manner of things proceed smoothly.  

Great compassion, great vows,  
Great sage, great mercy—  
Embracing the Dao and holding virtue close,  
The Heavenly Venerable of Harmonizing All Things.
