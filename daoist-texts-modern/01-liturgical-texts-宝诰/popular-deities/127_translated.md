# The Precious Edict of the City God

With utmost reverence, I bow and submit my heart in homage.  
Ancient Lord of Earth and Grain, the righteous deity of all under Heaven.  
He weighs the fortunes of the realm and reveals the path of loyal deeds,  
Dispensing rewards to the good and punishments to the wicked with boundless compassion.  

Sovereign of the city and guardian of all its districts,  
Commanding the attendants of the various prefectures.  
Under his jurisdiction lie thirteen administrations,  
And he reviews the judgments of eighteen offices.  

His temple and altar endure for ten thousand years,  
His grace supports countless kalpas.  
He wields the scepter of blessing and awe,  
Holding the power to decree life and death.  

He channels divine might to protect the capitalâ€™s rivers and plains,  
Driving away shadowy armies and repelling barbarian foes.  

Most numinous, most sacred, ever just and impartial,  
He guards the nation, secures its peace,  
And aids the sage king with his majestic spirit and responsive power.
