# Precious Edict of the Director of Destinies of the Nine Heavens

With devoted heart, I bow and submit my reverent homage.  
He who holds the office of throat and tongue, who manages the kitchen and stove,  
Records the causes of merit and fault among mortals,  
And, according to appointed times, ascends to report above.  

He embodies the transformations born of Heaven and Earth,  
Sheltering and protecting the humble folk below.  
He drives away unrighteous ghosts and spirits,  
Sweeps away the blemishes and pestilence amidst the dust.  

Within each household, he brings auspicious joy,  
Uniting the dwelling in flourishing prosperity.  
From dawn till dusk, he receives the grace of support and aid,  
On the day of the Gengshen, he observes with discerning eyes what is right and wrong.  

Majestic and serene are his auspicious signs,  
Radiant and mighty are his numinous spirits.  
Great compassion and great vows,  
Great saintliness and great mercy.  

The Primordial Sovereign of Great Unity, Director of Destinies of the Nine Heavens,  
The Heavenly Venerable who fixes blessings and reports merits.
