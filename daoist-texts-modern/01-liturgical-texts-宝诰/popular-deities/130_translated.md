# Precious Edict of the Righteous Deity of Blessing and Virtue

With devoted heart, I bow and take refuge in reverence.  
Within a single parcel of earth and valley, the myriad clans find their Deity of Blessing.  
He holds fast to loyalty, upright and fierce, aiding the realm and guarding its people.  
Receiving the simple mandate, he calms a region, and the common folk look up with awe.  

Charged as the steward of merit and record, he oversees the transmission, his earnest spirit ascending on high.  
His righteousness threads through the Nine Heavens; good and evil shine forth clearly and respond in kind.  
His numinous power penetrates the Three Realms; he inspects deeds and faults with discerning clarity.  

He fortifies the golden moat and rampart, establishing peace for altar and land.  
Great loyalty, great filial pietyâ€”most illustrious, most efficacious.  
Protector of the nation, guardian of the people, he delights greatly and bestows generously.  

The Righteous Deity of Blessing and Virtue, exalted by the Most High with added rank.  
The revered Deity of earth and valley, enshrined by imperial decree of the Jade Emperor.  
Master of the altar, guardian of the palace, the Sovereign Bright King of the Land, the Righteous Deity of Blessing and Virtue.
