# The Precious Edict of the Gate Spirits

With utmost reverence, I bow and submit my vow.  
They hold their station at the path of coming and going,  
Entrusted with the sacred power to guard the dwelling.  
Wielding golden whips and silver reins,  
They drive away the unrighteous ghosts and spirits that lurk within the hall.  

With hearts of righteous courage and loyal devotion,  
They shelter the young and old, men and women alike, within the home.  
Looking upward to the Supreme Emperor,  
They stand as vigilant guardians of the humble folk below.  

Their grace enfolds the entire household,  
Their virtue blesses the neighborhood and lane.  
As Gate Attendants and Household Commanders,  
They are the spirits of utmost potency.  

They banish calamity and summon good fortune,  
Expel evil and extinguish malevolence.  
Standing watch over the gates and doorways,  
They forever secure and pacify the threshold of the home.  

Such is the divine might of the General who commands the dwellingâ€™s protection.
