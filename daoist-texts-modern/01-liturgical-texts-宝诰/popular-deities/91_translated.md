# Precious Edict of the Perfected True Lord Who Penetrates Emptiness and Comprehends the Marvelous

With devoted heart and bowed head, I take refuge and offer reverence.  
On high, beyond the clouds, dwells the Lofty One of the Divine Firmament,  
Within the Jade Pure Thunder Mansion,  
Where radiant light divides the primal breath,  
And the elegant peaks of the Sovereign Lord resound;  
The dao unfolds through the Five Phases,  
Attending the subtle imperial sanctuary.  

In his palm lie thunder and rain,  
Rescuing from drought and dispelling calamity;  
With his finger he commands the hidden forces of yin,  
Bringing peace to the realm and guarding the nation.  

His功 (merit) spans countless kalpas,  
A teacher and patriarch of the sacred法 (method);  
His virtue extends to save the lost multitudes,  
A compassionate father to all living beings—  
The Perfected True Lord of Penetrating Emptiness and Marvelous Numinous Wisdom.
