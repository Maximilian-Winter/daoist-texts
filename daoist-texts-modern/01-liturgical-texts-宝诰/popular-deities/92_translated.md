# Precious Edict of the Thunder Perfected

With heartfelt devotion, I bow and take refuge in reverence.  
From the exalted celestial mansion on High,  
The Mysterious Capital where the laws are upheld with solemn honor,  
The Venerable Great Perfected One who unfolds the teachings,  
The Jade Emperorâ€™s attendant censor,  
The inspector who surveys the Nine Heavens in their entirety.  

The compassionate Father of the Revealed Teachings,  
The true Master who aids the world,  
The guide who points the way through the Three Realms,  
The sovereign who commands myriad spirits,  
The Supreme Minister of the Jade Capital,  
The Universal Savior, Lord of the Primordial Marvelous Dao,  
The Thunderous Voice who unfolds the teachings, the Celestial Venerable.
