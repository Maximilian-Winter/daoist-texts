# Precious Decree of the Patriarch Sa

With utmost sincerity, I bow and take refuge in this sacred vow.  
From the western lands the lineage flows, its traces revealing the Dragon’s rise.  
Dispensing wealth and blending elixirs to aid all living beings,  
Accumulating deeds and merits, cultivating the supreme dao.  

Receiving the iron master’s profound teachings,  
Guardian of the Thunder Scriptures within the Jade Mansion,  
Clad in a robe of a hundred patches that subdues demons,  
In hand, the Fan of Five Luminaries to command spirits.  

In Heaven’s stead, proclaiming the transformative law,  
Uttering incantations, inscribing talismans,  
Summoning wind and thunder within mere inches,  
Cutting down fiends beneath the Dipper’s fierce constellations.  

The dao merges with the Great Ultimate,  
Positioned among the Primordial Ones,  
Like pine, bamboo, wild cranes—free to roam and soar,  
Near and far, a solitary cloud ever at ease.  

Everywhere, unfolding the teachings squarely,  
Master of myriad methods, the primordial teacher of all laws,  
Opening altars in every place, a model for future generations,  
Sovereign of the Celestial Capital,  
The One-Origin, Supreme, Patriarch Sa, True Lord.
