# Declaration of the Perfected Sea Jade Patriarch, White Ancestral Treasure

With utmost sincerity, I bow and take refuge.  
In the bloom of youth, I sought the truth, journeying to the southern seas in quest of the dao.  
I turned my heart away from gold, jade, and brocade’s splendor,  
Vowing to cultivate by feasting on snow and lying upon ice.  
Barefoot and with hair unbound, everywhere I refused to follow worldly appearances.  
I consumed the rosy clouds and breathed the vital breath,  
Enduring hardship to steadily accumulate pure cultivation.  
I painted plum blossoms and bamboo for my own delight,  
Drinking and chanting without weariness.  
Free and graceful as the wind, the dao’s methods knew no bounds.  
Great compassion, great vows; great sage, great mercy.  
From the Purple Clarity Palace lineage,  
The Divine Heaven’s Auxiliary Primordial True Lord,  
The Heavenly Venerable who unfolds the Five Thunders’ dharma.
