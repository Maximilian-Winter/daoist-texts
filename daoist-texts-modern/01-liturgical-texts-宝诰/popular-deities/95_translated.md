# Precious Edict of Patriarch Sanfeng

With devoted heart, I turn to pay homage and surrender my being.  
He began with the primordial One Qi of azure light, teaching to unfold throughout the Ten Directions.  
Accumulating merit and achievement beneath the great radiance, he guided sentient beings through the bustling market streets.  

Encountering the Fire Dragon, he carefully pondered the ultimate Dao;  
Entering Wudang, he harmonized and nourished the Spirit of the Valley.  
Blending with the common world, softening his brilliance, he labored through five cycles of the calendar;  
Retreating to the mountains, facing the wall, he endured the trial of nine years.  

At the grand court, he ascended in splendor, manifesting the flight of transcendence;  
On sacred mountains and ancient caverns, he left traces of the immortals.  
Everywhere he opened enlightenment, everywhere altars were set;  
He expounded the Golden Scripture, its transmission spanning ten thousand generations,  
Confirming the Golden Elixir, delivering all later disciples.  

Great compassion, great vow—  
Great mercy, great benevolence—  
Utmost numinous power, utmost sanctity—  
Utmost impartiality, utmost clarity—  
All true beings united as one primordial source.  

The Primordial Patriarch, the True Lord of Broad Compassion and Universal Salvation,  
The Heavenly Venerable who penetrates the subtle and reveals transformation.
