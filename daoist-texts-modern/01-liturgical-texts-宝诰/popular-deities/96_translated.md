# Precious Edict of the Five Patriarchs of Quanzhen

With devoted heart, I turn my life over in reverent homage.  
The great Dao first opened wide, the mysterious Primordial unveiled its transformations.  
Its teachings extend through ages past and present, revealing the name of the Eastern Splendor.  
It embraced the generals of the Han court, concealed itself within Zhongnan’s sacred embrace to forge immortal covenants.  
Surpassing the cycles of kalpas, its transformations transcend fate’s turning wheel,  
Its manifestations ever present among the mortal realm of men.  

It awakened the sages of the Tang dynasty,  
Illuminating the secret methods of the divine immortals.  
Swift as flying swords and potent as elixirs, it cautioned and transformed without fixed form.  
The lofty standard of the Golden Court’s Chancellor,  
The resolute courage to decline the treasured seal’s power.  
Clad in robes of rosy clouds, ascending on high,  
Uniting the north and south in ancestral lineage.  

Heaven again rises among mortal heroes,  
The Dao pervades and connects the four seas.  
From the golden lotus bloom seven petals,  
Unfolding the immortal lineage across the Ten Directions.  
The principle of longevity pervades to this very day,  
The profound heavens hang down over all the lands.  

Expansive and magnificent is the supreme Dao,  
Broadly delivering the foolish and bewildered.  

The Quanzhen Patriarchs:  
Eastern Splendor Purple Mansion, assisting the mysterious and establishing the supreme Dao Sovereign;
