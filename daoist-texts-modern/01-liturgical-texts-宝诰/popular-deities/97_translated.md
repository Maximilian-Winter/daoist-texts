# Precious Decree of the Southern Five Ancestors

With devoted heart, I bow and take refuge in reverence.  
Illumined in true realization, verified upon the dao,  
They journey forth to transform the Southern Heavens.  

The Nine Sovereigns descended their traces upon Tiantai,  
A single lineage deeply opened through Patriarch Liu.  
Gathering the celestial marvels of jade blossoms,  
They inscribed the elixir scriptures of awakening to truth.  

The dao entrusted to the apricot grove,  
Soon to return the original chapters of restoration;  
The methods passed through the chicken-foot peak,  
Where the marrow of the elixir’s book was perfected.  

The perfected ones stood forth in Huizhou,  
Their nature and ground transcending spirit and brilliance;  
Blades and compasses entered the mouth,  
Their divine transformations boundless and free.  

They wield thunder and rain within their palms,  
Reviving the people beyond the world’s edge.  
Virtue shone forth over the Southern Sea,  
Attaining the refined standard of jade’s essence;  

The dao spread across distant wilderness,  
Satiating with the wondrous subtlety of the dharma’s words.  
The traces of dragon and tiger float upon Luo,  
The realm of jade peaks in Wuyi’s embrace.  

Passing through transformations in many directions,  
The true writings fully recorded,  
They stand as the foremost crown of gods and immortals,  
Gathering the exemplary models of former ages.  

With solemn vow to expand the profound,  
Compassionate, benevolent, and holy ancestral masters:  
Awakened True Purple Sun Perfected One,  
Apricot Grove Verdant Mystery Perfected One,  
Dao-Illuminating Purple Worthy Perfected One,  
Mud Pellet Verdant Void Perfected One,  
Jade Pipe Purple Clarity Perfected One.
