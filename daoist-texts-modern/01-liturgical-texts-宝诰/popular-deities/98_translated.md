# True Treasure of the Northern Seven

With a heart resolved and reverent, I bow and take refuge. The Dao begins with the primordial breath—one qi—whence the world reveals the Seven True Ones. They awaken to words beyond the reach of the Five Phases, and grasp the secret of the Ninefold Reversal, returning whence they came. Like sweet springs nourishing all things, they transform decay and restore the bloom of spring. In the Golden Realm, the immortal’s grace is attained by mastering the Four Words and harmonizing with the Dao; in Weizhou, through wondrous transformations, sitting ten years brings forth the True.

Between the walls, ink traces bear the mark of the extraordinary; snow, bamboo, moon, and pine take on forms unlike any other. The Two Wells hold records of countless lives born anew, while at a single moment the merit of manifest transformation is revealed. Six years at Pan Creek, seven years at Dragon Gate—the Dao’s功 (achievement) complete, their name reaches the rulers of the age; bestowed with elixir and talisman, they command the mysteries of gods and immortals. On stone, they discourse on the profound; in empty air, their flying canopies appear.

The Primordial Lord repeatedly issues proclamations and inquires of the Dao; timely sweet rains descend to aid the people. Early they exhaust the words of the Easy Dao, late they forge the secret of the immortals. The hexagrams and charts unfold, the supreme Dao perfected. The serene recluse probes the mystery and attains the Way; the immortal path of Penglai is held alone through countless kalpas. With compassion to relieve suffering, the Perfected Ancestor of Quanzhen arises.

The Seven True Ones who manifest and transform as Heavenly Venerables are:  
- The True Lord of Danyang, embracing the One and embodying effortless universal transformation;  
- The True Lord of Changzhen, condensing spirit with profound stillness and nurturing virtue;  
- The True Lord of Changsheng, assisting transformation with mysterious clarity and virtue;  
- The True Lord of Changchun, fully virtuous, divine, and responsive, the chief teacher;  
- The True Lord of Yuyang, embodying mystery, vast compassion, and universal salvation;  
- The True Lord of Taigu, broadly serene, penetrating the profound and ultimate mystery;  
- The True Lord of Qingjing, deep and pure, mysterious and void, harmonizing the primal transformation.

Thus unfolds the celestial drama of the Seven True Ones, venerable lords of transformation and illumination.
