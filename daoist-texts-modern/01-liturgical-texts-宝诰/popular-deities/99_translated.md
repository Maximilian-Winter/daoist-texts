# The Precious Edict of Mazu

With utmost sincerity, I bow and take refuge in your name.  
A motherly presence matched with the earth itself,  
Your sacred virtue reaches to the very heights of Heaven.  
You commune with the numinous spiritual body,  
Silent and serene, a true immortal of the spirit.  

In Fujian Province, your mighty power shines resplendent,  
At Meizhou, your grace flows endlessly like a gentle stream.  
Your yang spirit manifests time and again,  
Saving the world with compassion and tender mercy.  

Time after time, you stir the transformation of the eternal order,  
Endlessly you emulate the profound teachings of the Dao.  
Embracing boundless compassion, you uphold the weak and aid the distressed,  
Extending your care to the hidden and the overlooked,  
Broadly ferrying all good affinities across the great river of existence.  

Your sacred virtue dwells within the waters,  
Your wondrous methods reach the great expanse.  
Utterly pure and steadfast in chastity,  
Neither partial nor biased in your ways.  

You heed the call to rescue from suffering and calamity,  
According to the heart’s wish, you dispel disasters and erase faults.  
Great compassion, great vow,  
Great saint, great mercy—  
The Jade-Sealed Heavenly Empress,  
Heavenly Sovereign, the Primordial Lady of the Celestial Realm.
