# The Daoist of Mount Wuyi Preserving the Jade Emperor’s Decree

Xu Huaiyuan, a Daoist of Mount Laoshan, wandered far and wide until he arrived at Mount Wuyi. Enchanted by the mountain’s waters and peaks, so noble and fair, he resolved to hang his single robe at the Zhi Zhi Hermitage and dedicate himself to cultivating the Dao and nurturing simplicity. Mount Wuyi is a blessed grotto of Daoism, where numinous qi gathers in abundance. The trees tower to the heavens, and the Nine-Bend Stream flows clear and melodious—an ideal realm for spiritual practice. Thus, not only Dao cultivators come here to refine their true nature, but the mountain is also home to mountain spirits and ghostly beings who cultivate in their own way.

Behind the alchemical chamber of Zhi Zhi Hermitage lies the deep mountain, remote and uninhabited. At night, strange sounds sometimes echo through the silence. Having dwelled there long, the Daoist paid no mind to these eerie noises. One night, Xu Huaiyuan sat quietly within the alchemical chamber, incense burning softly as he entered stillness. Suddenly, he heard the tapping of roof tiles above—thinking it a squirrel, he did not concern himself. Yet, in a moment of half-dream, a black shadow appeared, peering down through the window, observing the interior. Its form was like a person yet not a person. Xu Daoist knew at once this was a mountain demon, a malevolent spirit. Hastily, he chanted the Golden Radiance Incantation to shield himself.

The shadow hesitated, then leapt through the window into the room, reaching out to touch Xu Daoist. Alarmed, Xu Huaiyuan summoned his inner vision and imagined himself transformed into the Jade Emperor, Great August Sovereign. His body radiated ten thousand beams of light, illuminating the forest, the Three Realms, and the Ten Directions. The black shadow was seized by the brilliance, startled and fleeing in terror.

The Iron-Crowned Daoist says in the *Jade Emperor’s Repentance*: “May I attain the body of radiant light, ever shining as the Emperor’s light, so that all who behold me are embraced and protected.” When Xu Huaiyuan was tested by the evil spirit, his remembrance of the Jade Emperor caused him to be enveloped by the Emperor’s light. Thus, the scripture’s words prove true. When one can think of the Dao, the Dao also thinks of that person. Many in the world are blinded by external evils, though many outward causes exist. Rather than complain, it is better to remember the Dao and seek the true.

Master Bai Yuchan said: For those who cultivate, if each day they can hold in mind the sacred name of the Jade Emperor, Great Heavenly Venerable who Pardons Sins, then after a hundred years, they will not fall into the realms of suffering. Reciting the sacred name of the Jade Emperor brings profound merit, beyond measure. Know this: when I think of the Jade Emperor, the Jade Emperor also thinks of me. This body is forever under the Jade Emperor’s protection; calamity departs, blessings arrive, longevity and extended years are attainable.

Every year, on the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth lunar month, at the hour of the Rat, the Jade Emperor descends from Heaven to tour the realms, thoroughly inspecting the Three Realms. From the entire nation, great and small palaces, temples, and shrines respectfully welcome the imperial carriage.

Devotees from the Ten Directions offer humble and sincere offerings, gazing upon the golden visage.

The Sovereign Emperor bestows his grace, universally shining upon the people below; the Jade light spreads its protection, and all beings find deliverance.
