# The Verified Efficacy of Reciting the Sacred Name of the Jade Emperor by Feng Guohua of Taizhou

Feng Guohua was an elderly woman from a certain place in Taizhou. In her earlier years, she devoted herself to Buddhism, bowing before the Gengshen Repentance and the Ten Kings Repentance, among others—texts that were, in truth, worldly pseudo-scriptures. She even chanted sacred names such as “Namo Heavenly Primordial Great Treasure Amitābha Buddha.” Yet, with Buddhism and the Dao indistinct in her mind, though she practiced diligently, she found it difficult to reach the ultimate liberation.

A Daoist adept from the Purple Void Palace, seeing her earnest desire for emancipation, taught her to recite the sacred name of the Great Heavenly Venerable of the Jade Emperor’s Pardon of Sins. He said to her, “The Western Pure Land belongs to foreign lands; the Eastern Pure Land is China itself. If you die and go abroad, there will be no one there to speak with you. How could it be as convenient as in China?”

The old woman assented quietly. From then on, she held fast to the sacred name of the Heavenly Venerable, seeking rebirth in the immortal land of the East. Though others tried to dissuade her, she did not waver in her resolve. In time, her complexion grew radiant, her hair and skin became lustrous. In the winter of the year of Gengyin, she told her family she wished to bathe, then sat facing east within her chamber and passed away peacefully.

After death, her bones and joints remained supple and warm—signs that all believed to be marks of a successful rebirth. When the local elderly women heard of this, it spread like a gentle breeze, and many turned to the Daoist path.

The Patriarch Bai Yuchan said, “It is better to hold fast to the sacred name of the Jade Emperor Heavenly Venerable for healing.” For those who study the dao and can recite the sacred name of the Heavenly Venerable will surely receive the protection and guidance of the Heavenly Venerable. The Jade Emperor Repentance states, “May I attain the body of radiant light, forever embodying imperial radiance, for I am embraced by it.” It also says, “May I attain the peerless body, with the Supreme Emperor’s distant chant, honored by myriad gods.”

If one can call upon the dao, the dao also calls upon one. Those who cultivate the dao—why would they not strive diligently in this? Truly, this is a simple and easy gate to cultivation. Yet the Daoist tradition does not widely proclaim it, because most Daoists seek to become immortals rather than to be reborn. Even if one attains rebirth, it is but the rank of ghostly immortals, so the path of immortality does not emphasize it. Nevertheless, if one can be reborn, is that not better than descending into the evil paths of ghosts?
