# Quanzhou’s Luo Weiying: A Tale of Sorrow Stirring Heaven

Luo Weiying, a native of Quanzhou, was wed in the year nineteen eighty-eight to a man surnamed Hu. Together they bore a son. When the child was but thirty-some days old, the man Hu departed for foreign lands, journeying to Malaysia. Before leaving, he spoke to Luo Weiying: “You tend the child well at home; in two years’ time, I shall bring you both abroad.” Yet those two years stretched into thirteen, and Luo Weiying bore the child alone—enduring hardship beyond measure, her heart’s bitterness known only to herself.

In the year two thousand, Luo Weiying sought to buy a dwelling, yet her purse was light. In her distress, she traveled to Mount Wuyi—a journey both to ease her spirit and to pay homage to the ancestral Patriarch. Upon her return, she carried but two hundred coins. The very next day, a friend lent her fifty thousand; from other quarters, she borrowed more than a hundred thousand. Only then was the price of the house secured. The family of her husband, fearing the house might slip from their grasp, sent her over fifty thousand coins as well.

When registering the property, Luo Weiying inscribed the name of the man Hu upon the deed. She hoped that one day he might return. Yet when she called him, he only bade her wait two more years. Luo Weiying’s patience wore thin; despair took root. She often went to the Hu household to make a scene—shattering the icebox, smashing the stove. The in-laws grew weary. At last, in the year two thousand nine, the two were mediated into divorce. On the very day the decree was handed down, as Luo Weiying stepped from the court’s gate, she spoke to the Hu family: “All these years of marriage, I have wronged none of you. What one does is seen by Heaven. If Heaven has eyes, your family shall suffer retribution!” The next day, the mother of the man Hu fell from the upper floor, breaking her thigh—and in time, it festered and rotted.

Later, Luo Weiying’s son went abroad to work. She believed it was the spirit of Mount Wuyi who had long shielded her. Thus, she took up the path of the Dao and became a Daoist priestess.

A verse in praise:

Bemoaning faithless hearts and fleeting ties,  
Why linger where no fate abides?  
Though retribution may touch Hu’s mother,  
It cannot reclaim but a year or two of youth’s bright tides.
