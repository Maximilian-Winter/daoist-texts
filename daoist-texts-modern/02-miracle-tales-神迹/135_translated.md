# The Matter of the Kitchen Steward at White Cloud Cavern in Taicang

In Jiangsu’s Taicang, there lies White Cloud Cavern, a place of the orthodox Daoist Way, a true sanctuary of the Way. One day, the Daoist Master Hou Mingde of the Quanzhen Longmen lineage journeyed to White Cloud Cavern. Enchanted by the gentle beauty of Taicang’s watery villages, he requested to dwell there permanently. The steward of the place consented.

Yet a problem arose at mealtime. Why so? Because the orthodox Daoists of the Way customarily eat meat, only observing fasting on the triple prime days and the five winter fasts. But the Quanzhen Daoists chiefly observe vegetarian fasting. When the meal was served, all would go to take their portions, yet Master Hou alone took a bowl of plain white rice to eat.

The steward, seeing this, asked, “Dao friend, do you not eat meat?”

Hou Daoist replied, “I have been vegetarian for three years. If I eat meat, my stomach will rebel.”

So the steward instructed the kitchen henceforth to prepare a vegetarian dish for Master Hou every day, forbidding the use of animal oils and forbidding scallions and garlic.

The kitchen staff agreed, but perhaps being country folk unaware of the strictures, or careless in their duties, after cooking the meat dishes they did not wash the pots before making the vegetarian dishes. Master Hou tasted the food and found the flavor wrong. He said to the cook, “Your kindness is great. Might I trouble you, when preparing vegetarian dishes, to wash the pot first? I ask for but one vegetable dish.”

Now the cook grew angry and said, “I did wash the pot! How can you, a Daoist, speak so? You are picky about your food. What harm is there in eating meat?”

Then he reported to the steward, saying, “This newcomer, Master Hou, complains that I only make him one vegetable dish, while others have several meat dishes.”

Master Hou wished no quarrel with this worldly man and left Taicang.

Within days, the cook’s mouth began to swell with sores, red and oozing pus, pain unbearable. It was summer, and flies swarmed his mouth, relentless and impossible to drive away. Many doctors were sought, but none could heal him. The other Daoists whispered, saying it was retribution for his slander against the monastics.

At last, a Daoist of the orthodox Way from the temple recited several scrolls of the Scripture of the Three Officials, and only then did the cook recover.

The Iron-Crowned Daoist said: “In all numinous altars and temples dwell guardian spirits who uphold the Way’s sanctuary, silently protecting those who cultivate the orthodox Dharma. Some who labor long in the temple lose reverence for the Daoists. They do not know that working in the temple is a precious chance to accumulate merit and virtue. Instead, harboring malice, they harm the cultivators. Such people face severe retribution in the netherworld.”

The eulogy says:  
“The Daoist’s fasting was strict and pure,  
While the worldly ignorant gave rise to slander.  
Good and evil, in the dark, surely repay—  
Why not repent and honor the triple primes?”
