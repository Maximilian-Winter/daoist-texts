# The Retribution of the Contractor at the Releasing Pond of Southern Peak

Li Dinggui, a man from Jiamusi in Heilongjiang, was cunning by nature. Seeing the bustling incense offerings in the temples of the scenic area, and knowing the Chinese fondness for beseeching the gods’ protection, Li Dinggui sensed a grand opportunity hidden within. Thus, he ventured into the business of temple contracting, reaping considerable gains.

In the year two thousand and one, he rented a stall beside the releasing pond of a certain temple on Southern Peak, vending fish and turtles for devotees to purchase and release. By day, Li Dinggui sold these creatures to the pilgrims; by night, when the scenic area lay empty of visitors, he would scoop the fish and turtles back up, only to sell them again the next day for release. Thus the cycle turned, profit flowing ceaselessly like the river’s current.

Believing himself clever, he scoffed at the gods and the law of retribution. Yet in two thousand and three, while riding his motorcycle, he fell into the river and drowned. His family summoned divers to retrieve his body, but it was not until more than ten days later that his corpse surfaced upstream—already devoured by fish and turtles, half consumed by the very beings he had sold for release.

A verse praises thus:

> Disbelieving cause and effect, fearing not Heaven’s decree,  
> Under the Patriarch’s gate, profit flows freely.  
> Little knowing blessings and fortunes dissipate in shadow,  
> One dawn, retribution’s hand comes to fill the destined measure.
