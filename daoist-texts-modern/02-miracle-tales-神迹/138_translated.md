# The Possession of Wu Jun by Lord Guan of Hainan

Wu Jun was a man from Hainan. His parents had parted ways, and Wu Jun, having barely finished middle school, dropped out of school altogether. Thereafter, he drifted through society, becoming a petty ruffian, brawling and causing trouble wherever he went. Yet Wu Jun was fiercely loyal and generous to his friends; he stood up against bullies and championed the weak, delighting in righting wrongs. He often told those around him, “The deity I respect most is none other than Lord Guan.”

In the year two thousand and nine, a relative of Wu Jun passed away, and Wu Jun went to attend the funeral. The ceremony was held in the ancestral hall, where the bereaved family had invited a group of Daoist priests to chant scriptures for the soul’s deliverance. As Wu Jun listened to the priests’ hymns, his heart was deeply stirred, and tears welled in his eyes. On the altar stood a commanding statue of Lord Guan, the Guardian of the Shrine—his face flushed red, his long beard flowing, radiating awe-inspiring majesty.

Wu Jun fixed his gaze upon Lord Guan, and suddenly a flash of lightning streaked across the hall. At that moment, he fainted.

Those present were terrified and hurried to support him, pressing the acupoint between his nose and upper lip, and forcing down ginger broth. Suddenly, Wu Jun’s eyes snapped open. He stood on one foot, the other crossed in a manner like the “crossed leg of Erlang.” His right hand stroked an imaginary beard as he declared, “I am none other than Guan Yu, Marquis of Hanshou Pavilion.”

Having spoken, he strode forward to seize the ceremonial weapons displayed in the hall. Grasping the crescent-moon blade, he began to wield it with fierce vigor, the air itself seeming to roar with tiger-like power. Those watching were dumbfounded.

Hainan’s faith runs deep; the elders present recognized this as a true possession by Lord Guan. They quickly knelt and bowed in reverence. After about the time it takes for one incense stick to burn, Wu Jun regained his senses.

The Daoist priests said, “Just now, Lord Guan possessed you. Perhaps you share a karmic bond with him. You might try casting divinations to inquire further.” Wu Jun cast eighteen sacred hexagrams in succession, forging a solemn covenant with Lord Guan.

Through possession, Lord Guan expels evil and cures illness, aiding the world and teaching reverence for the divine. Wu Jun, through this possession, earned some money and accumulated merit.

Relying on Lord Guan’s mighty power, Wu Jun’s exorcisms proved remarkably effective, and people from nearby came seeking him. Gradually, his household’s fortunes improved.

The Iron-Crowned Daoist once said: “The Heavenly Altar Jade Code states: The Supreme Truth does not possess human bodies. True deities do not possess mortals. Yet the Lingguan Proclamation says: Possession perfects clarity and communicates intent. Lingguan indeed can possess.” Throughout antiquity, many accounts of possession exist, recorded in texts and passed among the people. Perhaps the spirit possessing Wu Jun was not truly Lord Guan, yet this tale is recorded to reveal that beyond the veil, spirits unknown to us dwell. Are they ghosts? Or gods?

In praise it is said:  
“Loyalty so vast it reaches the clouds—Lord Guan Yun Chang,  
Demons and fiends quake at his presence.  
Sometimes possessing mortals to relieve suffering,  
Still recalling the day he beheaded Yan Liang?”
