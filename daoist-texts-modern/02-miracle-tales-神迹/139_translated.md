# The Venerable Qiao of Dongguan Pays Homage to the Spiritual Efficacy of Mount Chisong

Qiao Huifang, a native of Dongguan, possessed the rare gift of spiritual insight and was herself a dedicated cultivator, able to perceive the hidden realms beyond the mortal veil. In the year two thousand and nine, she journeyed to the Golden Flower’s Mount Chisong to pay reverent homage to the Venerable Immortal Master Huang.

It was the sacred day of the Master’s celestial birthday, and within the Chisong Palace, the Daoist priests were conducting a grand ritual. Qiao Huifang beheld a magnificent host of celestial troops—countless and resplendent—descending from the heavens in majestic array. The Venerable Immortal Master Huang appeared radiant, bathed in golden light, his dharma form solemn and awe-inspiring.

Qiao Huifang was a mother to a son frail and beset by illness. With a heart bowed in earnest supplication, she knelt before the Master, beseeching his protection that her child might grow strong and healthy in the years to come. The Master spoke with serene gravity: “At present, my temple is undergoing repairs and requires a sum of funds.”

Moved, Qiao Huifang entered the hall and saw that indeed the temple was preparing to build a stage for sacred performances, yet lacked sufficient resources. Recognizing this as the Master’s subtle prompting, she generously offered a donation of one hundred thousand yuan.

Upon returning home, her son dreamed of an immortal bestowing upon him a numinous talisman, commanding that it be worn faithfully. From that day forth, his health flourished, and in all things he prospered.
