# The Verified Support of the Dao by Kang Tongsheng of Shaanxi

Kang Tongsheng, a native of Shaanxi, married a woman surnamed Wang. Kang Tongsheng was devout in his reverence for the Dao, generously cultivating offerings and support. Whenever he saw temples being built or repaired, or when he traveled about, he would always provide some money—sometimes five yuan, sometimes ten, sometimes a hundred. This had gone on for more than ten years. Occasionally, his wife would quarrel with him over this matter, but Kang Tongsheng would soothe her, saying, “The virtue and power of the immortals are beyond imagining. One cannot deny the existence of the numinous simply because one cannot see the spirits!”

In the year two thousand and three, Kang Tongsheng fell ill and went to the hospital for examination, where he was diagnosed with liver cancer. The family was poor, and considering that their children still needed to study, they did not seek treatment at a large hospital. Instead, they obtained some traditional Chinese medicine from the barefoot doctor in the countryside to take. As the illness worsened day by day, signs of liver cirrhosis and edema appeared. One day he said to Wang, “On the third day of the third month, the You Sheng Palace will celebrate the sacred birthday of the Great Emperor Perfected Martial. You must go to the temple and burn incense for me.”

When the third day of the third month arrived, Wang prepared offerings and incense and went to You Sheng Palace to burn incense and worship. Kneeling before the deity, she prayed, “Immortals, you know our Kang has given no small sums to the temple, doing many good deeds—why then is there no good reward? Why has he fallen ill with this disease? Immortals, please manifest your power!” As she thought this, tears began to fall. Reflecting further, Wang thought, “Perhaps this is my fate; the immortals cannot help,” and so she returned home.

Upon returning, she heard noises from the kitchen and found it strange. “Could it be the neighbors have come to cook for old Kang?” she wondered. Entering, she was astonished to see Kang Tongsheng cooking at the stove. Old Kang said, “While you were burning incense, I dreamed that a deity came to heal me. He said my yang lifespan was originally to end this very year. The Three Officials Emperors examined my merits and faults, and, recalling my usual support of the teaching, reported to the Eastern Peak and the Southern and Northern Dippers. They granted me an additional ten years of yang lifespan and sent the heavenly physician to diagnose and treat me. Now my body is much better than before. I am preparing a vegetarian meal to repay the grace of the gods.”

The Iron-Crowned Daoist said: The span of a person’s life and the timing of their death are all fixed at the moment of birth. Yet if one can perform many good deeds, then the immortals, in their examination, add blessings and extend life; if one does evil, they diminish one’s blessings and lifespan. One must know that a person’s misfortune, fortune, longevity, and premature death all depend on Heaven. Though it is said to be predestined, it is also changeable. The poem says: “Forever harmonize with fate, and seek abundant blessings yourself.” Misfortune and fortune have no door; only people themselves summon them. Among many good deeds, the greatest merit lies in supporting the Three Treasures. If one can sincerely revere the Dao and take refuge in the Three Treasures’ field of blessings, one may avoid disasters and premature death in life, and after death may be reborn in the immortal land of eternal joy. Some people fancy themselves clever and say ghosts and spirits are empty illusions, that there is no response or connection—this is only because their sincerity is insufficient, their faith unsteady, and thus they fail to perceive the numinous and divine!
