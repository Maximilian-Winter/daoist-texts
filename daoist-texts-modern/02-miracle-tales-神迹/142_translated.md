# The Monk of Taizhou’s Falsification of the Dao Scripture and Its Retribution

In the tenth month of the year two thousand and sixteen, within a certain temple in Sanmen County of Taizhou, Zhejiang, there dwelt a monk named Shì Yuanhui. He made his livelihood through fasting rites, sacrificial ceremonies, and repentance recitations, having received his training in the dharma lineage of Mount Tiantai. Upon witnessing Daoists performing rites to honor the stars and bowing to the Tai Sui, he mused, “If Daoists may worship the Tai Sui, then surely we monks may do likewise.” Thus, he procured the *Precious Repentance to the Spirit of Tai Sui* and the *Scripture of the Northern Dipper*, and began to alter the words within.

He changed the Star Lords into Bodhisattvas, the Celestial Venerables into Buddhas, and invited a band of monks to join in worshiping the Tai Sui, claiming to have received transmission from some venerable master of high standing.

The faithful, unable to discern truth from falsehood, all came to beseech Shì Yuanhui to perform the ritual of pacifying the Tai Sui on their behalf.

At that time, one monk voiced his doubt, saying, “Is it not improper for us to tamper with and falsify Daoist scriptures? After all, the Buddha himself never passed down such teachings.”

Shì Yuanhui replied, “This is but the teaching set forth by the spirits. Moreover, all dharma is Buddha-dharma; the Star Lords of Daoism are simply the Bodhisattvas of Buddhism. The Most High Lord Lao is even a disciple of the Tathāgata Buddha—how could he surpass the Buddha? There is no need for worry.” So he opened the altar and began chanting scriptures, also setting up a star altar modeled after Daoist practice, upon which was inscribed: ‘In reverence to this year’s Tai Sui, Bodhisattva So-and-So.’ When Shì Yuanhui opened the altar, the *Pilgrim’s Cap* fell from his head, yet he paid it no mind.

During the course of the ritual, it seemed as if a golden-armored general descended from the heavens, his voice stern and commanding: “You monks of the mulberry gate! How dare you falsify the precious scripture of the Most High and steal the profound arts of the Mysterious Gate! Wearing the crown of a farce, your guilt is unforgivable!” Having spoken, he raised a golden whip and struck the monks. Shì Yuanhui fainted.

When he awoke, he was stricken with a stroke, paralyzed on one side, and from time to time he cried out, “Immortals, have mercy on me!” Within less than one month, he passed away.
