# The Case of He Guobao of Nanping Harassed by a Vengeful Spirit

He Guobao, a man from Fujian, suffered from a persistent pain in his perineum. He sought help far and wide, but all remedies failed, and he spent a great deal of money. One day, he heard that in Dou Tian Palace of Xinyu, Jiangxi, there lived a Daoist master named Li whose acupuncture skills were extraordinary. Without hesitation, he took his carriage and hurried to Xinyu to seek healing.

After the customary greetings between host and guest, Master Li inquired, “When did this ailment first begin?” He Guobao replied, “It started shortly after I moved into my new house in the year two thousand and nine.” Master Li pondered silently: Could this be a matter of feng shui? Or perhaps the handiwork of some ghostly mischief? He then took out his silver needles and, following the sequence of the Thirteen Needles of the Ghost Gate, began to apply them one by one. When he reached the Quchi acupoint, suddenly a woman’s voice rang out sharply, “This is none of your business! Do not meddle further!” At once, Master Li ceased his treatment.

After sending away the onlookers, he turned to He Guobao and asked, “Have you ever wronged a woman? Or done something that betrayed a woman’s trust?” He Guobao answered, “In the year two thousand and ten, after graduating, I returned to Xiamen. My university girlfriend wished to come back with me, but while I was in Xiamen, another woman fell in love with me, and I broke up with my original girlfriend. Later, I heard that she soon fell into deep despair and drowned herself. Could this be connected to my illness?” Master Li nodded gravely, “I understand now. The woman you wronged has become a restless spirit, haunting you. Your sickness is the work of ghostly forces, beyond the reach of mere medicine or needles.”

He Guobao was filled with both remorse and fear, and he pleaded, “What should I do? Please, Master, teach me!” Master Li replied, “These troubles are the fruits of your own misdeeds. To heal, you must first sincerely repent and seek the forgiveness of the woman’s spirit. Secondly, you must hold a Yellow Register ritual altar to offer sacrifice and guide her soul to rebirth.”

He Guobao hastened to agree. He chose an auspicious day and invited a high-ranking Daoist master to conduct a Yellow Register ritual altar for three days and three nights. The ceremony was complete and the merits fulfilled. Without further treatment, He Guobao’s illness vanished as if by magic.
