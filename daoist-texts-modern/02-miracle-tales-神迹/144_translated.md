# A Devotee from Shaoxing Pays Reverent Tribute to the Celestial Master

Wang Guiying, a native of Shaoxing, suffered from a hidden ailment. She sought remedies far and wide, yet the results remained faint and uncertain. In the autumn of the year of the Wood Tiger, she journeyed with kin and friends to Mount Longhu, to pay homage at the venerable sites of the Celestial Master.

On the eve before their departure, she dreamed that Master Zhang appeared to her, entrusting a message: “Your health is frail. Tomorrow, when you arrive, I shall send someone to attend to your illness.”

The next day, while staying at an inn in Shangqing Town atop Mount Longhu, a maiden Daoist nun came knocking at her door. “Are you Wang Guiying?” she inquired. “Master Zhang has sent me to heal you.”

Wang Guiying found this most curious, for it so perfectly matched the vision of the night before. Half in doubt, half in faith, she welcomed the visitor. The nun’s countenance was fair and refined; her manner, graceful and unpretentious. After a session of acupuncture, Wang Guiying felt a sudden clarity flow through her limbs, as if all blockages dissolved and her long-standing malady vanished like morning mist.

Grateful beyond words, she said, “You came so hastily today that I have no gifts to offer. Tomorrow I shall visit the Celestial Master’s mansion to express my thanks. Pray, may I know your honored name?”

The nun replied, “Boundless is the blessing of life. I am but a humble Daoist, surnamed Hu in the mortal world.” With that, she took her leave.

On the following day, Wang Guiying prepared offerings and went to the Celestial Master’s mansion to thank the Daoist maiden Hu. She inquired throughout the household, but all replied, “There is no Daoist named Hu here at the Celestial Master’s residence.”

Perplexed, Wang Guiying left the Hall of Imperial Edicts. At that moment, the Fox Immortal Hall was open for visitors, so she ascended to pay respects. There, before the statues enshrined in the Fox Immortal Hall, she beheld a divine figure whose likeness matched exactly the immortal maiden she had seen the night prior.

Only then did she comprehend: it was by the Celestial Master’s command that the Fox Immortal had taken the form of a Daoist maiden to heal her. With deep reverence, she bowed and withdrew.
