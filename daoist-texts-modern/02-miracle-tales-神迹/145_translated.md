# The Tale of the Wudang Daoist and the Spirit Medium

Master Zhao Sixuan, a Daoist adept, in his youth took monastic vows on Wudang Mountain, inheriting the celestial lineage of the Heavenly Heart Method. In later years, he wandered among famed peaks—Qingcheng, Wuyi, and others—seeking out exalted sages and wondrous immortals. In the year two thousand and nine, he settled in Xiamen, where he built a humble hut and devoted himself to incense and cultivation. A benevolent lay devotee, moved by his presence, generously offered support and protection; before long, a modest Daoist temple rose. Since Master Zhao had entered the Way on Wudang, the temple honored the Great Emperor Perfected Martial, and was named the Xuantian Temple.

In southern Fujian, licentious spirit worship ran rampant, and spirit mediums and shamans abounded. Among them was one spirit medium who frequently came to the temple to perform frenzied spirit dances, babbling incoherent words that disturbed the sacred calm. Repeated admonitions proved futile. In the eighth month of the year two thousand and twelve, Daoist brother Lin Farun journeyed to southern Fujian in pursuit of the Way and lodged at Xuantian Temple. While sharing tea and heartfelt discourse with Master Zhao, they suddenly heard from the temple courtyard strange chanting, a babble of sounds in the local tongue, unintelligible to them. Lin asked, “What is this commotion?” Zhao replied, “Merely a spirit medium who often visits. Ignore her.” Lin said, “Today we are graced with rare affinity to gather and converse at length—shall we allow this spirit medium to spoil our refined mood? This evil spirit dares to run wild in the temple; it is intolerable. Let me summon the celestial generals and seize the possessing demon.” With that, he reached for his Heavenly Canopy staff to slay the demon.

Master Zhao hastily stopped him: “Brother, no! Those who have left the world bear compassion in their hearts. Watch and learn.” With a hand gesture, Zhao drew upon the qi of the Northern Dipper, and in the blink of an eye, silence fell beyond the window. Lin exclaimed, “Ah, the spirit medium suddenly ceased her dance—what has happened?” Zhao said, “Just now I invoked the Northern Dipper’s heavenly vigor to bind her. The evil spirit, struck with terror, fled.”

The two opened the window and called to the spirit medium in the courtyard: “Why have you stopped dancing? If you come again, I shall imprison that demon!” Only then did the spirit medium realize that Master Zhao’s previous mercy was not helplessness but deliberate restraint. From that day forth, she never returned to perform her frenzied rites in the temple.

The Iron-Crowned Daoist said: “Most spirits that possess are mountain demons or strange ghosts. Some possess to cultivate, but if arrogance arises and they cause chaos in temples, it is improper. Master Zeng once restrained them with the heavenly vigor of the Northern Dipper, but that is but a minor art. Daoism also has the method of purifying the altar and setting up protective barriers, inviting the Nine Phoenix Generals to sweep away filth, and summoning the great spirit officials to guard the sacred space, so that evil demons and heterodox paths dare not approach. There is also the method of severing and imprisoning, which can tightly confine evil spirits.”
