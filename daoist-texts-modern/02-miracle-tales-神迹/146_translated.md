# The Daoist of Liangzhou Captures a Ghost

In Liangzhou, at a certain public security bureau, there was a haunting. Even by day, stepping inside stirred a chilling gloom. At times, the night shift officers heard pitiful screams echoing through the halls, or glimpsed a black shadow trailing just behind them—a figure clad in red robes, hair unbound, dreadfully fearsome. One after another, several staff met strange and untimely deaths. The entire office was gripped by terror; some sought protective charms from the Tibetan regions, others recited incantations, yet none availed.

At this dire juncture, someone spoke to the bureau chief: “There is the Daoist Sun Jinglian of the Jade Emperor’s Palace in a certain place. He inherits the lineage of the Supreme Clarity, wields thunder magic, and excels at expelling demons and capturing ghosts. His efficacy is renowned. Why not invite him to take a look? What say you?”

Daoist Sun arrived at the bureau and produced a compass to survey the terrain. “This place faces Bing, sits on Ren; the water gate is blocked, gathering wind and qi. The feng shui is quite favorable, promising wealth and official rank alike. Former bureau chiefs all enjoyed honorable promotions.” The chief nodded in agreement.

Sun then moved to the northeast corner of the office building. “The Gen palace is the ghost gate, which ought to be tranquil. Yet here you installed a ventilation system. The haunting began right after this fan was put in.” An elder officer confirmed, “Indeed, we installed it in the year two thousand and seven; the hauntings started in the latter half of that year.”

Sun circled that corner repeatedly, then declared, “Three feet beneath the earth here lies a coffin.” The bureau immediately summoned diggers to exhume the spot. But Sun cautioned, “No haste. We must first capture the spirit before disturbing the grave.”

Thus, in the courtyard, an altar was erected, venerating Master Zhang, the Great Emperor Fengdu, and Marshal Tianpeng. Another jar was prepared, covered with red cloth, filled with water. Daoist Sun traced the cosmic patterns of the Big Dipper and the Seven Stars, calling upon any deities present. Soon, a chilling wind swept through. He shook the Three Pure Ones’ bell, drawing the ghostly soul into the jar, then sealed it with a numinous talisman.

When finished, he told the chief, “The fierce spirit is now captured. What remains is to relocate the remains of the deceased. After that, peace will return.” The chief asked, “How do you know the ghost is truly trapped?”

Sun replied, “At Maoshan, ghosts are sealed within porcelain jars filled with water. Once the spirit enters, the water ceases to ripple. If you doubt, try it yourself.” The chief dared not touch the jar, so Sun lifted it and shook it gently. “Do you hear the water flowing?” he asked. The chief marveled in wonder.

“What shall be done with this jar?” the chief inquired. Sun said, “Would you have me leave it here? I will take it back and bury it at the temple gate, to guard the shrine for me.”

The next day at noon, diggers were summoned again. In less than an hour, a coffin was unearthed; the corpse inside was not yet decayed.

The Iron-Crowned Daoist said: “When a tomb’s feng shui is poor, the departed soul easily becomes a fierce ghost. Once its resting place is disturbed, it harms the human world. In such cases, one must invite a master to subdue it. Therefore, we must always honor the dead and respect the masters dwelling within their tombs.”
