# The Verification of the Sacred Name of the Heavenly Venerable of Great Unity, Savior from Suffering, by Chen Wei of Hebei

Chen Wei, a native of Cangzhou in Hebei, lost his mother in childhood and went out early to work. During his time away, he came into contact with certain Daoist teachings, and on his own began to cultivate sitting meditation and recite the Daoist scriptures. In the year of Xinmao, he returned home and found that his native village had changed greatly, which filled his heart with joy. That very night, Chen Wei drank some wine with his father and, drowsy and heavy-headed, soon fell asleep.

In a state between waking and dreaming, Chen Wei felt that after so many years away, he ought to go out and see how his old home had transformed. So he stepped out of his room. Under the moonlight, the village lay serene and tranquil; from a nearby road came the occasional honk of a passing vehicle.

As he walked, Chen Wei thought to himself, “Life is but illusion and change—how well I remember this very ditch, where once I caught fish and bathed with Chen Juan and the others, ha ha.” Just then, a voice called out, “Chen Wei, why are you here? Come sit with me at my place.” Looking up, Chen Wei saw it was his youthful playmate, Chen Zijun. Surprised, Chen Wei asked, “How come you’re home?” Chen Zijun laughed, “Ha ha, I just came back a few days ago myself. Didn’t expect to run into an old classmate here. Come on, let’s go to my house.” Chen Wei asked, “Where’s your home?” Chen Zijun pointed to a nearby two-story building, brightly lit, and said, “There, just over there, very close.” Chen Wei looked at the glowing two-story house and felt something odd. “It’s so late, your parents should be asleep. Maybe tomorrow?” At that moment, Chen Zijun’s face suddenly changed, insisting that Chen Wei come to his house. Alarmed, Chen Wei exclaimed, “You’re not Er Gou, are you? Who are you?” In a panic, he struck the figure with a punch—and the head of the other was severed. He immediately tried to flee, but terrifyingly, the headless Chen Zijun still pursued him. Chen Wei felt as if his feet were filled with lead, running sluggishly, his heart gripped by dread.

He then silently recited the sacred name, “Heavenly Venerable of Great Unity, Savior from Suffering.” As he repeated the name, his feet began to move again. When he awoke, he found himself lying in bed, drenched in cold sweat. Chen Wei felt something was amiss, so the next day he sought out the place from his dream. He discovered that Chen Zijun’s old home had been relocated, and the original site transformed into a scenic lake. By the lakeside, a family was burning paper offerings. Approaching, Chen Wei saw it was Chen Zijun’s mother. Upon inquiry, he learned that Chen Zijun had died a year before.

The Iron-Crowned Daoist said: “Hereabouts there is a saying—that souls drowned and trapped beneath the water cannot depart unless a substitute is found. Could it be that what Chen Wei saw was the phantom of a drowned ghost seeking a replacement? Had he not reacted swiftly and recited the sacred name of the Heavenly Venerable, who knows what fortune or misfortune might have befallen him? The Heavenly Venerable appears spontaneously, and one must recite with compassion to save all beings. He is truly the ferry across the bitter sea, the compassionate vessel of the human world.”
