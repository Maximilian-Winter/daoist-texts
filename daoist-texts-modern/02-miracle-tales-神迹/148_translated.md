# The Marvelous Efficacy of Hu Aiguo of Nanchang

Hu Aiguo, a native of Wangcheng in Nanchang, was born in the years of the Republic. In his youth, he received the precepts at Qingyunpu, becoming a lay disciple of the Pure Brightness lineage. Amidst the chaos of turbulent times, he never forsook his original heart, holding the salvation of others as his true purpose. During the Cultural Revolution, when intellectuals were sent down to labor in the very village where Hu Aiguo lived, he cared for them with devoted kindness. Ever fond of doing good and delighting in charity, whenever he encountered the poor and destitute, he would offer either porridge and rice or money. His hidden merits shone forth, his virtue and deeds renewed day by day.

In the year two thousand and five, he passed from this world. His family laid him to rest by the shores of Jiulong Lake.

Years later, in two thousand and eleven, Nanchang undertook vast demolitions and expansions to build a new city. Jiulong Lake fell within the planned district, and Hu Aiguo’s gravesite had to be relocated. His descendants invited a Daoist to oversee the exhumation. When the tomb was opened, the coffin’s interior was remarkably clean—no bones were found, only a single shoe remained. Upon it grew a single sprout of lingzhi mushroom, radiant and alive. The Daoist was astonished and inquired of the mourners, “Who is the person resting here? What was his role in life?” The family recounted Hu Aiguo’s deeds and character.

The Daoist said, “Your honored father may well have undergone corpse liberation to become an immortal. This lingzhi is a sign of auspicious response; it is the fruit of his meritorious virtue, the manifestation of功德成神—merit perfected into divinity.”

The family found this incredible but took the lingzhi mushroom home. Whenever illness arose, a small piece was enough to bring swift healing, proving itself wondrously efficacious.
