# Laughing Proudly over Rivers and Lakes and the Shrine of the Yellow Emperor

In Jinyun County of Lishui, Zhejiang, there flows a cherished stream—the very mother river of the land. Yet this beloved watercourse often rages in mighty floods. In the year nineteen ninety-six, devout followers from Taiwan bestowed their offerings to build a shrine dedicated to the Yellow Emperor. Two years hence, the sacred hall was completed. Then came nineteen ninety-eight, a year when the southern lands were beset by great inundations, yet Jinyun County remained untouched, unharmed. The elders and fathers of the village all declared this to be the potent virtue and numinous protection of the Yellow Emperor’s grace.

Come the year two thousand twelve, the county government sought to raise the renown of the Immortal Capital scenic realm. They consented to film the new version of *Laughing Proudly over Rivers and Lakes* within the precincts of the Yellow Emperor’s shrine. Without heed or reverence, they removed the plaques inscribed with “Xuanyuan Hall” and “The First Shrine under Heaven,” replacing them with the banner of the Huashan Sect. The drama began filming in the third month of the Western calendar year. By the fifth month, relentless rains poured from the heavens without cease. The mother stream swelled beyond its bounds, swallowing bridges whole. The calamity reached the county town itself, flooding streets and buildings alike. Those wise in the ways of Heaven and Earth saw clearly: this was a grievous offense against the divine powers, a calamity sent from the celestial realms.

A verse praises thus:

Lofty and grand, the altar and temple guard the Immortal Capital,  
They quell waters and dissolve evil by their own right.  
Yet when the sacred shrine becomes but a stage for play,  
The once-beloved stream turns now to foe.
