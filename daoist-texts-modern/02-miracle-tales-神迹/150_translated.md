# Verification of the Efficacy of the *Treatise on Response* by Liao Mingyuan of Jiujiang

Liao Mingyuan, a native of Xiushui in Jiujiang, once journeyed to the Immortal’s Grotto on Mount Lu during the twelfth year of the Republic. There, he encountered a Daoist adept who, upon calculating his fate, discerned that his life was marked by the afflictions of solitary stars and lonely constellations. These portended harm to his parents and kin, hardship in offspring, and a destiny shadowed by poverty, lowliness, and isolation. At that time, Liao Mingyuan was already thirty years of age, yet remained unwed, his heart burning with anxious longing. Falling to his knees, he implored for a means of deliverance.

The Daoist then produced a copy of the *Most High Treatise on Response* and handed it to Liao, saying: “This is the precious teaching of the Most High, the *Treatise on Response*. If one can hold fast to and receive its words, blessings and fortunes will grow ever stronger. A person’s blessings and fortunes are originally decreed jointly by the underworld’s southern Dipper’s six officers. Generally, they depend on the measure of ancestral merit accumulated in the nether realms, as well as the good and evil deeds, merits and faults, of one’s previous life. This is what is called bearing the burden of fate. If one wishes to explain the responsibility of bearing this burden, one must multiply good deeds to dissolve the energies of resentment and grievance.

“Three feet above your head there are divine spirits. If you can accumulate acts of kindness and hold a heart full of harmony, auspicious energy will naturally emanate from you, and you will be a fortunate person. But if your heart is filled with rancor, and cruel, evil energy issues forth from you, then you are a calamitous one. Blessings and calamities have no fixed door; they are summoned by oneself. I hope you will practice according to the words in the *Treatise on Response*, and on the ninth day of the first month each year, burn incense and offer prayers to the Vast Heaven. In time, surely, auspiciousness will come.”

Liao Mingyuan followed this teaching faithfully. He honored and cared for his parents, repaired bridges and mended roads, showed compassion to the lonely and widowed, accumulated virtue and practiced benevolence, and restored the Xuantan temple and other sacred sites. By the fifteenth year of the Republic, he married and soon fathered two sons.

All these are the fruits of perfected good merit, the descent of divine blessings and auspiciousness. Though it is said that Heaven bestows these gifts, are they not truly wrought by human hands? Daoism often says, “My fate lies within me, not in Heaven.” When the human heart births a thought of goodness, even before the good deed is done, auspicious spirits gather around! If one harbors evil thoughts, even before evil is committed, malevolent spirits follow close behind! Knowing this single thought, one can command ghosts and spirits, seize upon creation and transformation, and alter destiny itself! As disciples of the Mysterious Gate, why should we not strive diligently to practice this?
