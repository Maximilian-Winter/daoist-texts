# The Verified Efficacy of Wang Tingzhi of Ganzhou in Holding the Holy Name of the Savior from Suffering

Wang Tingzhi, a native of Ganzhou, in his early years frequented the Jade Void Sanctuary to burn incense and reverently worship the sacred image of the Heavenly Venerable Savior from Suffering. His heart was filled with faith and devotion, and he held fast to the continuous recitation of the holy name. Though those around him mocked this practice, Wang Tingzhi merely responded with a faint, serene smile.

In the twentieth year of the Republic, as the fires of war raged fiercely, Wang Tingzhi could not escape harm. Struck by a stray bullet in midstream, he collapsed to the ground.

In a state of bewildered trance, he perceived the arrival of ghostly emissaries seeking his soul, who bore him away to the netherworld of Fengdu’s Underworld. Beneath the yellow earth, damp and dim, flickered here and there one or two ghostly flames, drifting uncertainly. From time to time, the sounds of torturous interrogations echoed through the gloom.

Moved by compassion for the suffering beings enduring torment in hell, Wang silently uttered the phrase, “Heavenly Venerable of Great Unity, Savior from Suffering.” Instantly, the murky shadows dispersed, revealing the Venerable riding upon five-colored auspicious clouds, astride a nine-headed lion, each step blossoming lotus flowers beneath his feet, his voice resonant and clear throughout the underworld.

Mighty attendants led the way, with celestial soldiers following close behind. Jade maidens and golden youths bore countless banners and standards. Witnessing this majestic scene, Wang’s heart brimmed with awe, and he prostrated himself upon the earth. Joy and praise welled forth as he beheld the Venerable’s solemn and wondrous form.

In that moment, hell itself dissolved; wicked ghosts fled in terror, and the iron enclosure of unbroken torment transformed into the jade garden and jade pool of the celestial realm! It was as if awakening from a dream.

When Wang stirred from his trance, he found himself lying within a coffin, his family stricken with fright. At that moment, Wang’s wife, a woman of stout courage, stepped forward to inquire, saying, “Just now, you were struck by a stray bullet; your heart had ceased beating and your breath had stopped. We all thought you were dead.”

Wang recounted the vision he had just experienced. All agreed that it was the manifestation of the Heavenly Venerable Savior from Suffering who had saved Wang Tingzhi’s life. They hurriedly burned incense and offered worship, giving thanks for the sacred grace.
