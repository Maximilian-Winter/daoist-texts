# Verification of the Sacred Title of the Revered Thunder by Lady Cai of Henan

Lady Cai, a woman from Luoyang in Henan, was born under a fate afflicted by the “child” star. From her youth, she delighted in reading the scriptures of both Buddhism and the Dao. Yet, bound deeply by worldly ties and lacking sufficient roots of virtue, she was unable to leave the mundane world to cultivate the dao. Because of a flaw in her Eight Characters of Destiny, she frequently attracted shadowy spirits and other such beings, causing her great distress.

In the year of the Dinghai, Lady Cai began to practice sitting meditation and similar disciplines. In moments of trance and profound obscurity, she seemed to feel a light entering her body, followed by a chill shaking her to the core. She was certain this was no divine radiance, but rather the presence of yin spirits. Alarmed, she hastily rose from her meditation cushion. At night, as she slept, it seemed as if someone lingered beside her, teasing her in every manner, engaging with her in intimate play. Even by day, she sometimes sensed this presence.

Filled with both fear and anger, Lady Cai called upon a Daoist priest from the Zhongyue Temple to seek counsel. The priest said, “Ordinary people whose fate is afflicted by the child star, the canopy, or emptiness are prone to attracting ghosts and spirits. If one does not leave the world to cultivate the dao, then one must carefully guard oneself to avoid being harmed by them. There are two remedies: first, to take refuge in Buddhism and Daoism, becoming a disciple of the Three Treasures, so that evil spirits dare not disturb you; second, to recite and hold fast to the Sacred Title of the Heavenly Venerable of the Thunderous Universal Transformation of the Nine Heavens.” The priest instructed Lady Cai to come to the Zhongyue Temple before the Zhongyuan Festival to take refuge, submit a memorial to Heaven’s Court, and he also gave her a spiritual talisman to wear.

When the Zhongyuan Festival arrived, the gates of the ghost realm flung wide open. While Lady Cai slept at home, she saw countless ghosts and spirits filling her room and its surroundings—men and women, rich and poor—all terrifying to behold. Some even smiled upon her with ill intent. In great fear, Lady Cai silently recited the Sacred Title: “Heavenly Venerable of the Thunderous Universal Transformation of the Nine Heavens.” At first, her mind was not fully focused, but gradually her heart grew calm and her attention fixed upon the sacred name. After about a quarter of an hour, all those beings vanished from her room. Only then did Lady Cai firmly believe in the mighty power of the Venerable’s compassionate will, and that the Scripture of the Tenfold Heaven was no empty word.
