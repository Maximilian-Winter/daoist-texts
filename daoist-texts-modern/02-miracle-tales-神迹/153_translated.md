# The Verified Efficacy of Reciting the Sacred Name of the Heavenly Venerable of Great Unity, Savior from Suffering — by Li Ailian of Huzhou

Li Ailian, a native of Huzhou, in her early years devoted herself to the Pure Land school of Buddhism, ceaselessly chanting the Buddha’s name.

In the year of the Wood Dog, her household was beset by restless spirits: cupboards opened and closed on their own, the clatter of bowls and chopsticks echoed mysteriously, strange apparitions haunted her dreams, and electric lights flickered ominously—portents of ill fortune. Several Buddhist lay practitioners urged her to diligently recite the sacred name of Amitābha Buddha to dispel these ghostly disturbances. Yet, for three full months, no relief came.

Frightened and desperate, Li Ailian sought out a Daoist priest at the Mist and Clouds Temple of Huzhou, beseeching him for a method of deliverance. The Daoist instructed her to faithfully recite the sacred name of the Heavenly Venerable of Great Unity, Savior from Suffering. Li Ailian humbly consented, pledging to observe this practice.

Upon returning home, she wholeheartedly chanted the sacred name of the Heavenly Venerable, counting not the repetitions. That very night, she dreamed that the Savior from Suffering descended upon a five-colored auspicious cloud, riding a nine-headed lion. Immortal beings and perfected spirits formed a reverent escort, banners and pennants leading the way. From the heavens, they swept down and carried away all the malevolent spirits haunting her household.

From that moment forth, no ghostly disturbances ever troubled her home again. Moved by this miraculous deliverance, Li Ailian embraced the Daoist path. In the year of the Metal Ox, she passed on; her body remained soft and gentle after death—this, a sign of her rebirth into the Pure Land.
