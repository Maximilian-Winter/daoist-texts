# Qian Daxin of Jiyuan Holds the Scripture of the Three Officials

Qian Daxin was a native of Jiyuan. In his youth, he was fond of bravado and rough quarrels, delighting in the company of local ruffians, and indeed committed many misdeeds. In the year two thousand six, when the government of Jiyuan City sought to expand the urban district, development reached Qian Daxin’s village. Qian Daxin received a considerable compensation and planned henceforth to engage in commerce and trade, resolving to live a good and honest life.

Yet Heaven’s will did not accord with his desires. Qian Daxin invested in several ventures one after another, but all ended in loss. Troubled and vexed, he sought out a local shamaness, asking, “Why do all my businesses fail and bring loss?” The shamaness replied, “In your youth, you committed many evil deeds. You have depleted your yin virtue and damaged your own fate of prosperity. Though you now temporarily enjoy wealth and honor, it is because your grandfather once saved a life. But the Three Officials are examining your record: your yang lifespan will only last until the year two thousand nine.” Qian Daxin was displeased and did not take her words seriously.

Not long after, he felt unwell and went to the hospital for examination. It was discovered he suffered from liver hydropic degeneration and other ailments. Recalling the shamaness’s words, fear seized him, and he returned to her, earnestly seeking a way of salvation.

The shamaness told him, “The sins and blessings of all beings arise from causes and conditions, all under the scrutiny of the Three Officials, Great Emperors. Those who do good are recorded for birth in Heaven, increasing blessing and extending life; those who do evil are dispatched to Hell, condemned to poverty and early death. Though one may evade the laws of men in the mortal realm, the net of Heaven is vast and wide, yet misses nothing. The spirits watch with unerring precision. If you now wish to extend your lifespan and seek blessings, there is but one way: you must recite the Scripture of the Three Officials, beseeching the Great Emperors to temper their judgment. At the same time, you must perform many good deeds and widely sow fields of blessing. Otherwise, if your evil is full and your death near, not even the immortals can save you.”

Hearing these words, Qian Daxin’s heart grew heavy with remorse. He repented the deeds of his past, knowing all was the fruit of his own making, and blamed no other. To change his fate, he resolved to rely solely on himself. Thus, on one hand, he gave away money in charity—helping poor students to study, supporting impoverished families, and offering sustenance to the Three Treasures; on the other hand, he observed fasts at home and recited the Scripture of the Three Officials. After more than one month, Qian Daxin dreamed of a youth, whose countenance shone with radiance, clad in a blue round-collared robe, wearing a Tang-style headscarf. The youth said, “I am a functionary under the Three Primordial Gates, an official of the examination bureau. Because you have performed many good deeds and recited the Scripture of the Three Officials, the Great Emperors have decreed to grant you a temporary reprieve. Should you dare to commit evil again, your life shall be taken; but if you continue in goodness, you shall be granted long years.”

Upon awakening, the dream remained vivid and true as if real. He went to the hospital again, and all indicators of his liver returned toward normal. Qian Daxin dared not neglect this sign. From then on, he redoubled his efforts in good deeds and scripture recitation, and gradually his health and fortune improved.
