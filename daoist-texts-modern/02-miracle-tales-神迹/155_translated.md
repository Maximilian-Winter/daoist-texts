# The Miraculous Devotion of Zhou Juhua of Taiyuan to the Three Treasures

Zhou Juhua was a native of Taiyuan. Born into poverty and lowly circumstances, she held a deep reverence for the Daoist teachings. Yet, lacking financial means, she often felt a quiet sorrow over her inability to contribute more. Whenever free, Zhou Juhua would go to the temple to volunteer her service or donate modest offerings—rice, flour, soybean oil—to the temple’s upkeep.

In the summer of nineteen eighty-three, Zhou Juhua felt the years weighing heavily upon her; her health steadily declined. Reflecting on her humble origins, she thought, “My fate is shaped by the stars; I cannot blame others.” Yet, by the grace and protection of the ancestral Patriarch, her family remained safe and well. She noticed that the great hall of the Lüzu Palace in town lacked a dragon canopy. Might she find a way to donate one to the temple? But in that year, the market economy was still nascent; embroidered dragon canopies like those seen today were nowhere to be found. So Zhou Juhua purchased a piece of red cloth at the market and commissioned a tailor to fashion a simple dragon canopy herself. She then offered it before the statue of Patriarch Lü in the Lüzu Palace.

Not long after, Zhou Juhua passed away from her lingering illness, her face serene in death.

After the funeral, Zhou’s daughter, who had married far away, dreamed of her mother being guided to the Heavenly Palace by a boy clad in vermilion robes. Puzzled, she recounted this dream to her brother when she returned home for the New Year, asking what it might mean. Her brother was unsure. Later, while burning incense at the Lüzu Palace, they saw a boy standing beside Patriarch Lü who was exactly like the one in the dream. On the dragon canopy before Lüzu, the crooked, uneven characters read: “Devout believer Zhou Juhua’s respectful offering.” Only then did they realize that their mother, through this solemn merit, had been received by Patriarch Lü and had been reborn into the Pure Land.

The Scripture of the Venerable Sovereign of the Void, Chapter Forty-Nine, declares: “Without fields of blessing in the world, upon closing one’s eyes, what can one rely on?” The Buddhists say: “Nothing can be carried along except one’s karma.” Though Zhou Juhua was born poor and humble, by this utmost sincere merit she was spared descent into the evil realms. Should we, who study the dao, not take warning from this?
