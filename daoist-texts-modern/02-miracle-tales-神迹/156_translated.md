# The Ascension Record of the Perfected Xie Xichun of Tiantai

Xie Xichun was a Daoist of Tiantai. In his early years, he entered the Minghe Temple on Tiantai Mountain to cultivate the dao, his resolve unwavering and his devotion ever deepening. He received the true transmission of the Southern Tradition, his功力 profound, mastering the art of embryonic breathing and concealed qi. In Hangzhou, during a test of his electrocardiogram, within but a moment, the heart tracing flattened into a straight line—doctors all astonished—yet Master Xie remained calm and unshaken. This is the method of embryonic breathing, able to suspend heartbeat and breath while life itself does not cease. This matter is well known among the elder masters of the Daoist community.

After the meeting of the Old Lord in the year eighty-four, a Daoist named Ma Sizhen journeyed from Jinhua to Tiantai to pay homage. Passing through You Sheng Palace in Linhai, he encountered a Daoist clad in hemp garments, wearing straw sandals, and donning a pure azure cap—his attire unlike that of ordinary Daoists, yet his bearing serene and composed. He asked Ma Sizhen, “Dao friend, are you bound for Tiantai?” Ma replied, “Yes, I am intending to make pilgrimage to Tiantai.” The Daoist said, “Might I trouble you to deliver a letter to Dao Master Xie Xichun?” Ma agreed, and the Daoist bowed in thanks and departed.

The next day, Ma Sizhen ascended Tiantai Mountain. At that time, travel was difficult, and he arrived on the mountain only at night. He paid respects to Master Xie Xichun. After reading the letter, Master Xie laughed heartily. “It is rare that my old teacher still remembers me,” he said. Ma Sizhen was somewhat puzzled but took no great notice. After spending some time on Tiantai, he set out to return to Jinhua.

Meanwhile, Master Xie Xichun instructed the temple attendants on certain matters. He bathed and burned incense, then went to the圆堂 to sit in quiet meditation, leaving only a few disciples nearby. Around the third watch of the night, a faint rumble of thunder was heard within the圆堂, and the earth trembled. There, upon Master Xie’s泥丸, white vapor emerged, swiftly forming above his head a child, shaped like a true human being, as pure and bright as snow and moonlight, radiant and lovely. Soon, the infant mounted a celestial crane and soared away!

Later, Ma Sizhen, back at Chisong Mountain in Jinhua, saw Xie Xichun again, who taught him secret formulas of internal refining. A Dao friend arriving from Linhai spoke to Ma about the Master’s feathered transformation. Ma said, “Impossible! Just days ago he was here teaching me the elixir methods!” It was then understood that the Perfected had manifested in a form to skillfully guide others. Ma Sizhen devoted himself to internal cultivation, and in the early nineteen-nineties, he moved on to cultivate at Mount Hua, after which his whereabouts became unknown.
