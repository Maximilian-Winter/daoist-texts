# The Matter of the Hunan Female Daoist’s Burning of Money for the Departed

Wang Zongyi, a female Daoist priestess of Hunan, was by nature gentle and mild. In her youth, she left home to enter the Daoist monastery of Baopu in Hangzhou. While residing at Baopu Monastery, she heard the teaching that one might carve seals to print money for the departed, burning it as an offering to the homeless souls without ancestral rites. Moved by this, she spent her own funds to carve a printing block for such money. During the leisure hours in the hall, she would print these sheets of money for the departed. At dusk, whether at crossroads, beneath great trees, or in the corners of walls, she would burn them as offerings to those wandering souls without memorial.

One night, after finishing the burning of paper money, Wang Zongyi Daoist Master fell asleep and dreamed. In her dream appeared a girl of about thirteen or fourteen years, who spoke to Master Ding, saying, “Thank you, Daoist Master, for the money. Now I have funds to learn the piano.”

The Patriarch often said: Those who cultivate the dao must form good affinities across the Three Realms. Thus, in morning liturgy one forms ties with the immortals, while in evening liturgy one forms ties with the ghosts. If one can lavishly present offerings and build good relations with ghosts and spirits, they will become your protectors, secretly aiding you.

Master Ding once suffered from stomach ailments and other chronic illnesses. Because of his diligent cultivation and wide-reaching good affinities, one day in a dream a divine being revealed a wondrous prescription. Following this formula, he gathered herbs and took the medicine, and now his body is healthy and his life smooth. Fellow Daoist friends at the same temple believe that the one who revealed the prescription was perhaps moved by Master Ding’s tireless generosity, appearing in his dream to save him. Or perhaps it was a pure and numinous spirit, skilled in the art of healing.
