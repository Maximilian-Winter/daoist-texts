# The Verified Tale of a Merchant from Wenling Seeking Wealth through the Pure Sacrifice

Mr. Zhou Aihua was an ordinary merchant from Wenling City, Taizhou, Zhejiang Province. His family ran a hardware factory, and business had been fairly prosperous. Yet in recent years, he felt the trade growing ever more difficult. Watching others’ factories turn profits while his own received no orders, his heart burned with anxiety. He had also invited many geomancers, but their effects proved faint and fleeting.

In Zhejiang, the local folk all believed in the Dao. Zhou Aihua lived at Zhanglaoqiao, under the protection of the Purple Cloud Palace. In the year two thousand twelve, during the Old Lord Assembly, Zhou Aihua came to the Purple Cloud Palace to pray for blessings. There, by chance, he met Daoist Xu Haibin from Qionglong Mountain in Suzhou. In casual conversation, he spoke of his family’s business.

Daoist Xu asked, “What is your zodiac sign?”

Zhou replied, “I was born in the year nineteen seventy-six, the year of the Dragon.”

“Those born under the Dragon,” said Xu, “in two thousand eleven, the year of Xinmao, faced the harm of Chen and Mao—an ill omen; in two thousand twelve, Renchen, the double Chen self-affliction, also brought misfortune. But next year, Guisi, things will begin to improve. Still, there is one more thing to heed.”

Eagerly, Zhou asked, “What else must I watch for, Master?”

Daoist Xu said, “A person’s blessings arise from several sources: first, the karmic causes from past lives as taught by the Buddhists; second, the accumulated virtue of one’s ancestors; third, one’s own cultivation of virtue. Those who accumulate merit and perform good deeds enjoy abundant blessings and prosperity; those who commit sins and wrongdoing find their blessings thin and cold. In this world, people often indulge in ignorance—greed, anger, jealousy—speaking ill of others, judging Daoists, severing ties with kin, stealing, debauchery—many evil acts secretly erode their own blessings. Looking at your visage, your heavenly court is full and ample; your ancestors were surely a family of virtue. Yet now your business is so bleak—this cause, you yourself should understand.”

These words made Zhou break into a cold sweat. Bowing his head, he asked, “How can I lighten my sins?”

Daoist Xu said, “Within the human body dwell three corpses and worms. On the days Gengshen and Jiazi each month, they report a person’s sins to Heaven. The heavenly court has special gods who judge these accounts, determining misfortune or fortune according to one’s good and evil deeds. Yet the Heavenly Venerable is compassionate and opens the gate of repentance, offering a path for renewal. If one can sincerely repent the errors committed, sever the roots of evil, and cultivate good thoughts, then past sins may be pardoned. Sin arises from the heart and likewise is extinguished by the heart. If one can repent with utmost sincerity and turn the heart toward goodness, then sins vanish and blessings arise. Know this well: the root of sin is the root of calamity; the good heart is the field of blessings.”

Thus Zhou Aihua respectfully invited Daoist Xu to establish a ritual altar for repentance and blessing, petitioning the Three Officials Great Emperors and the Eastern Peak Heavenly Sovereign to strike his name from the Black Register. With utmost sincerity, he repented, vowing to perform more good deeds henceforth. Not only did Zhou generously offer wealth to support the Three Treasures and to repair the Xuantan temples, but he also aided impoverished children in their studies and performed many virtuous acts. Now his factory thrives, with orders booked through the following year. As the Patriarch said, “A family that accumulates goodness will surely have lasting joy; a family that accumulates evil will surely have lingering calamity.” The way of Heaven is clear and just; retribution never fails.
