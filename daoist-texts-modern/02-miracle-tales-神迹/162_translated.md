# The Record of Zhang Luoqing of Wenzhou Encountering an Immortal

Zhang Luoqing, a native of Wenzhou, in his early years took monastic vows at the Eastern Peak Temple of Wenzhou. Later, he journeyed to Beijing to study, but through unfortunate friendships, he became entangled in many base habits.

One year, Zhang Luoqing returned from Beijing to Wenzhou. After chanting scriptures at a humble temple on Yandang Mountain, he prepared to return to the Eastern Peak Temple. By then, evening had fallen; the mountain paths were rugged and winding, the stars and moon veiled in mist, and he gradually lost his way. As he walked on, he saw flickering lights ahead and decided to seek lodging there. The house was small, a common tiled cottage typical of the countryside. In the courtyard, an old man was writing characters. His beard and hair were pure white, yet his bearing was extraordinary.

Zhang Daozhang did not wish to disturb him, so he simply approached to watch. He saw the old man writing the character “Dao” with vigorous strokes, as if well practiced. After finishing a sheet, the old man placed it into a basin of water nearby.

Zhang Daozhang could not help but exclaim, “It’s wet, it’s wet—the Dao is wet!”

The old man turned to Zhang Chengqing beside him and said, “You know the Dao is lost, so why do you still linger here?”

Hearing these words so pointed, Zhang Daozhang fell silent.

The old man continued, “For one who cultivates the dao, the precious thing is to uphold refined conduct with perseverance. Never imitate the vulgar airs of the mundane world, nor let the desires of the outside disturb your heart and nature.”

He then spoke further of inner alchemy, divinatory arts, and the movements of the stars. The old man answered fluently on all matters, as if nothing was beyond his knowledge.

When Zhang Luoqing awoke the next day, he found himself lying in a wild, desolate place. Not far off lay the ruins of an ancient temple. Asking the local elders, he learned that here once stood the Palace of Master Lü.
