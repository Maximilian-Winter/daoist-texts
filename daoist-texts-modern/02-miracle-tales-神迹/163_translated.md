# The Record of Qian Jinghai of Taizhou Encountering an Immortal

Qian Hai, a native of Linhai in Zhejiang, from his early years was deeply devoted to the mysterious teachings. He admired the robes of the Daoists and often told his companions, “In the future, I shall become a Daoist, wandering the four seas.” Within the quiet solitude of his own chamber, he studied the art of drawing talismans. His classmates would often mock him for this.

In the year two thousand and seven, Qian Hai came to Nanchang to pursue his studies. During moments of leisure from his coursework, he frequently visited the Wanshou Palace on West Mountain and the Wanshou Palace of Nanchang to pay homage, wandering through the halls of the Xuan Altar Palace, reluctant to depart for long stretches.

On the first day of the eighth lunar month, the sacred birthday of Lord Xu Zhenjun, many devotees from across Jiangxi would journey to the Wanshou Palace on West Mountain to offer their reverence to the Venerable Lord. Qian Jinghai was among them that year. That very night, Qian Hai and several classmates strolled through the town of Xishan. Suddenly, by the roadside appeared an old beggar. Though his hair was unkempt and soiled, his eyes shone with piercing brilliance, and between his brows there was an unmistakable air of refined grace.

Grasping Qian Hai’s arm, the old man said, “Good sir, might you spare some coins?” The friends accompanying Qian Hai dismissed him as a mere fraud and paid him no heed. But Qian Hai said, “He looks truly pitiable,” and so he gave the old man all the small change he had on hand, amounting to several tens of yuan. The old man laughed heartily and said, “You have given me so much—let me give you something in return.” From his pocket he then drew forth a copper coin and handed it to Qian Hai.

At the temple fair on West Mountain, there is a custom: at the stroke of midnight, the new robe is presented to Lord Xu Zhenjun. This moment is the most lively and joyous of the entire festival. Qian Hai and his classmates gathered to witness the ritual, sharing in the bliss of the dharma. At that moment, one classmate remarked, “Look, doesn’t this Lord Xu resemble that old man from just now?” Qian Hai replied, “Indeed, he does.” Then they noticed that one copper coin was missing from the robe of Lord Xu, and the coin on the robe was exactly the same as the one the old man had given Qian Hai—on it were inscribed the four characters “Divine Power, Marvelous Salvation” (神功妙济).

Only then did Qian Hai realize he had just encountered an immortal. He immediately bowed his head in reverence, offering profound thanks for the sacred grace. Later, he took refuge in the Pure Brightness Sect, receiving the Daoist name Qian Jinghai. He devoted himself wholeheartedly to cultivating the Pure Brightness teachings and vowed to propagate the dharma, benefiting all beings.
