# Encounter with the Sword Immortal on Mount Qingcheng

Mount Qingcheng is the Fifth Grotto-Heaven of Daoism, the Elder among the Five Sacred Mountains, where numinous energy gathers and from which emerge lofty sages and wondrous adepts. When the great earthquake struck in the year five hundred and twelve, great boulders tumbled down the slopes and trees crashed to the ground, yet among more than three thousand visitors and the mountain’s Daoist priests, not a single soul was harmed. The saying that Daoist grotto-heavens are blessed lands is by no means empty talk.

In the eighties, a Daoist named Guo Zhiqing from Zhejiang journeyed to Mount Qingcheng to pay homage. He wandered the hills and waters with great joy. Upon arriving at the Quanzhen Temple, he found a teahouse within, tended by an old Daoist woman, warm and welcoming. She asked, “Fellow Daoist, whence do you come? Please, have a cup of tea.” After Guo Zhiqing had respectfully visited several halls of Quanzhen Temple, he returned to the teahouse to drink tea and chat. Suddenly, a cold gleam of light flashed swiftly past outside the temple. Guo Daoist asked, “Old practitioner, what was that sudden light just now?” The old adept replied, “Since the Wei and Jin dynasties, Mount Qingcheng has been home to sword immortals. They often cultivate in the back mountains, rarely seen by ordinary folk. They can ride swords through the air, traveling ten thousand li in a day; from a thousand li away, they can seize a person’s head. But those who practice sword arts tend to be solitary and eccentric, their ways unpredictable.”

Guo Zhiqing had long heard that immortals dwelled on Mount Qingcheng. During the Cultural Revolution, the back mountains often echoed with the sound of wooden fish drums; when the Red Guards followed the sounds, they found no trace of anyone. Guo Daoist resolved that this visit to Qingcheng must include seeking out these immortals. After worshiping at Quanzhen Temple, the Celestial Master’s Cave, and the Patriarch’s Hall, he set out for the back mountains. At that time, tourism had not yet developed, and the mountain paths were rough and difficult. After a long trek, no temple appeared, and dusk was falling. Deep in the wilds, snakes slithered and insects crawled; the roar of a tiger shook the entire valley. Fear gripped Guo Zhiqing’s heart—he did not know what to do and began to regret venturing into the back mountains.

Just then, a voice spoke: “Fellow Daoist, from where do you come?” Guo Zhiqing searched for the source but saw no one—only a white crane perched upon an ancient pine. Could this white crane be speaking to me? Guo Zhiqing was puzzled. At that moment, the white crane flew to his side and transformed into the figure of a Daoist priest. He wore a robe of blue cloth, a crane-feathered cloak outside, a crescent moon crown upon his head, straw sandals on his feet, and held a three-foot long sword in his hand. The Daoist bowed his head and said, “Daoist Guo, do not doubt. We met just a few days ago, even before dawn.”

Guo said, “Forgive my dullness—I do not recall where we met.” The Daoist replied, “Have you forgotten the white light at Quanzhen Temple?” Guo said, “Could it be that you are the old practitioner?” The Daoist laughed heartily and said, “I am but a humble Daoist priest. Now, the back mountains are full of fierce tigers and leopards; truly, this is no place for ordinary men. Yet Mount Qingcheng is governed by celestial immortals, and these beasts serve only to guard the grotto-heaven. They do not harm the virtuous, preying only upon the wicked and cruel. Thus, the Red Guards of the Cultural Revolution dared not enter the back mountains lightly—it was by the protection of these tiger and wolf spirits.”

Guo Zhiqing said, “I see. I have heard that immortals dwell in the back mountains, but I was unsure if it were true.” The Daoist said, “Famous mountains and grottoes all harbor immortal beings. But where immortals reside is another grotto-heaven altogether. Without the ‘True Form Chart of Mount Qingcheng,’ one cannot enter. Your fate has not yet come; there will be other chances to visit. For now, I shall escort you down the mountain.”

Before Guo Zhiqing could respond, he felt clouds beneath his feet and a sudden chill wind arise. In a flash, he found himself at the gate of Qingyang Palace. Looking back, the Daoist he had just met had vanished without a trace. Guo Zhiqing hurriedly burned incense and bowed thrice toward Heaven. From that day forth, his diligence in cultivating the dao increased greatly. In the year nineteen ninety-eight, he entered Mount Tiantai, and thereafter his whereabouts became unknown.
