# The Daoist’s False Words Breach the Karma of Speech, Illness Lingering for Many Months

The Daoist Zhang Renbiao, learned and versatile, skilled in discoursing on the dao and eloquent in expounding the profound meanings of the Daoist teachings, often delivered lectures within palace temples and grand halls. One day, during a speech, he spoke extravagantly and carelessly, straying from the true dao’s intent. The audience, one after another, departed, and many reproached him. Afterwards, he fell ill and took medicine, yet for many months his sickness would not abate.

One night, he dreamed that officers under the command of the Department of Destiny—foot soldiers and mounted enforcers—came to seize him at his residence, as if arresting a criminal in the mortal world. Along the way, they traversed a vast, open plain overgrown with brambles and thorns. They dragged him swiftly as if flying; his garments caught on the branches and trees, the thorns pierced his flesh, causing unbearable pain. After traveling about thirty li, he saw in the distance a dark city, from which smoke and flames rose. Approaching to look closer, he realized it was an iron city.

At the gates stood guards—beasts with human bodies—some with four mouths and eight eyes, others with ten arms and nine heads; their teeth frosted like snow, their fangs sharp as swords. Truly, it was as if the hellscapes painted in mortal Daoist temples had come alive. Passing through the city gates, he beheld palaces of pearls and jade, halls of crystal and gems, jade towers and golden pavilions—scenes beyond the gaze of ordinary men. This place differed from the underworld’s dark pass. Traveling four or five li further, nothing appeared.

Zhang Renbiao slowly asked the captors, “What place is this? Why does it differ from what I saw outside the gate?” The mounted officer replied, “This is the Palace of the Heavenly Venerable of Great Unity (Taiyi Tianzun). Passing through this palace, one reaches our department.” Hearing the name “Palace of the Heavenly Venerable of Great Unity,” Renbiao suddenly recalled that in his usual teachings he often urged people to recite the sacred name “Heavenly Venerable of Great Unity, Savior from Suffering” (Taiyi Jiuku Tianzun), which grants rescue from all difficulties and invites blessings and good fortune.

At that moment, a bright idea struck him. Thinking, “Now that I have come to the Palace of the Heavenly Venerable of Great Unity, why not recite the sacred name more?” He then loudly chanted the sacred name “Responding swiftly to the call, Heavenly Venerable of Great Unity, Savior from Suffering” more than ten times.

The officer dragging him laughed heartily and said, “Trying to draw water when thirsty is like biting your own navel—how can that succeed?” Hearing the laughter all around, Renbiao again loudly intoned the sacred name more than ten times, his tone mournful and his voice filled with sorrow. Tears fell, soaking his robes.

Suddenly, a beam of red light shone upon Renbiao’s left and right. The officers dragging him vanished in an instant, leaving only Renbiao standing within the radiance. Looking back around in all directions, he saw mountains and rivers radiant and beautiful, clouds and scenery serene and unhurried.

After a while, the Savior from Suffering (Jiuku Tianzun) appeared before him with over a thousand attendants. Renbiao respectfully bowed to the Venerable, his voice choked with grief as he beat his head in repentance for his lifetime’s faults, praying for forgiveness from the Savior from Suffering. The Venerable sat upon a five-colored lotus throne, surrounded by blazing flames encircling him, within which shone nine-colored divine lights. Around the Venerable’s body and head blazed sharp radiance, shooting forth like tens of thousands of spears and swords, covered by a canopy of seven treasures. Behind him stood the precious flowering trees of the soaring wood, illuminating the eight extremes. True men and mighty warriors, Vajra kings, jade maidens, and golden youths filled the retinue. The Yin-Yang Great Unity and forty-six deities led the procession, also attending on both sides, with cloud chariots and feathered canopies filling the sky.

The Savior from Suffering said to Renbiao, “In life, one must be most careful of the three karmas and the ten evils; among the three karmas, the fault of speech is especially grave. One person’s false words lead to the false actions of ten thousand. The one who speaks falsely bears the chief guilt. Your three karmas’ offenses were shielded by my protection, allowing you to escape the depths of suffering. Your lifespan has ended; you should not return again. Now I pardon you for seven more years, sending you back to the living world, with my image widely displayed among men, opening the gate of guidance and serving as the key to turning toward goodness. I hope you will strive wholeheartedly to practice this.”

Having finished, he ordered a young attendant to escort Renbiao back to his dwelling. Afterwards, his illness was suddenly cured. Several days later, Renbiao went out of the city through the Spring Bright Gate and saw among the mugwort and thorns the footprints he had originally made while walking. Upon close inspection, he saw on the thorny tips threads of purple silk caught on his clothes, along with faint traces of blood—indeed, the very path he had traveled that night when pursued.

Thereafter, Renbiao used his own money to commission paintings of the Savior from Suffering’s divine image in the Su Ming Temple. He also painted many copies of the sacred image outside the Eastern Luo Pass, enlightening the confused masses and leading them to revere the true lineage. Zhang Renbiao passed away seven years later.
