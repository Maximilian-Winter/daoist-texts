# Xiao Guoping of Hubei Awakens to Past Life Matters

Xiao Guoping, a native of Enshi, wandered in his youth to Mount Wudang. There, upon the Prince’s Slope, he encountered the Wudang Daoist Chief, Master Wang Guangde. Seeing Xiao Guoping, Master Wang said, “Come with me for a moment—I will give you a sword. When your left hand moves erratically, place it behind your door; it will keep you safe.” Xiao Guoping was puzzled and thought him a charlatan. “Daoist,” he replied, “I have no money on me.” Wang said, “I do not want your money.”

Having received the sword, Xiao Guoping returned home but paid it no mind, thinking the Daoist eccentric and superstitious. The sword was casually set aside in a corner of his home, left untouched for more than ten years. Then, in the year nineteen ninety-six, Xiao Guoping began to suffer frequent nightmares. Soon after, his left hand lost control, trembling violently. He sought doctors and medicines far and wide, all to no avail. Remembering the Daoist he met on Mount Wudang, he took out the treasured sword and placed it behind the door. From that moment, peace reigned for a time.

One day, Xiao Guoping went to Changchun Temple in Wuhan to burn incense. There he met a wandering Daoist. In conversation, he spoke of his troubles. This Daoist, well-versed in cultivation and deep in the dao, told Xiao Guoping, “In your past life, you were a general. Because of the many killings, resentments cling to you, causing this strange affliction. On a good day, come to the temple. I will chant a scroll of the *Scripture of the Three Officials* for you. Perhaps it can explain and resolve these grievances.”

When the auspicious day arrived, the Daoist opened the altar and began chanting the scripture. Xiao Guoping knelt behind, trembling with reverence and fear. The wooden fish echoed through the hall, the Daoist’s voice soaring to the clouds. In a trance, Xiao Guoping saw a host of ghosts appear before him, pouring out their grievances. Soon after, a pair of child attendants appeared, holding ornate banners, guiding those resentful souls away.

The *Scripture of the Three Officials* says:  
“Reciting this scripture turns the wheel of repentance and atonement; even the deepest offenses are forever released. When spirits and humans part, no difficulty arises; mother and child remain together; harmful influences face no punishment; life grows and matures; both parents benefit. The scripture’s power is vast and profound; prayers bring blessings, rituals dispel calamities. The sorrowful melt like ice; enemies and debtors vanish by themselves. Lonely souls and multitudes, the nine mysteries and seven ancestors, the four births and six paths, the cycles of birth and death—all emerge from hell and ascend to the Eastern Extreme Heaven, the gate of salvation from suffering.”
