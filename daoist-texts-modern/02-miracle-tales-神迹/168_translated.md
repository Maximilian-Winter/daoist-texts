# Verification of the Wildfire Self-Extinguishing at Baihe Temple in Junzhou

In the countryside of Junzhou, near the southern county by the banks of the Han River, about ten li away, there stands a temple called Baihe Temple—the White Crane Temple. It is built following the mountain’s contour, looking down upon the level plains; the groves and ravines are deep and secluded, the surroundings exceedingly serene.

The local elders say: “When the Jade Emperor, Great August Sovereign, performed the Fengshan sacrifices to the Eastern Peak, white cranes nested atop the altar of the Fengshan ceremony. Thus, the Son of Heaven issued an imperial decree to build this White Crane Temple.”

During the Kaiyuan era of Tang Xuanzong, there lived here a recluse surnamed Ma, who dwelt in seclusion to cultivate the dao. One day, suddenly, he feathered and soared aloft, transcending the mortal realm. The villagers then fashioned his likeness in statue form and enshrined it for veneration.

By the end of the Xiantong period, since no daoist had dwelled here for a long time, the halls and pavilions gradually fell into ruin; some walls collapsed, and the courtyard grew thick with wild grasses.

One day, a wildfire, driven by a returning wind, rushed swiftly to the eaves of Baihe Temple. The villagers, seeing this, were struck with great alarm and rushed forth to extinguish the blaze. Suddenly, from above the eaves, water gushed down in torrents, quenching the fierce flames.

The villagers found this most strange—whence came this water? Looking up to the heavens, the sun still shone brightly, no wind nor rain stirred. Surely, this miraculous water that saved from disaster was none other than the power of the numinous.
