# The Manifestation of the Heavenly Venerable at Tangxing Weir

Tangxing Weir was but a humble dam built across a small irrigation ditch in the village. Each winter, the villagers would laboriously maintain the embankment, preparing it for the spring plowing. They invested great effort and resources, yet every year, when the waters swelled, the dam would break—year after year—without anyone understanding the cause.

One night, the steward of Tangxing Weir dreamt a vision. In a hazy reverie, a voice spoke to him: “I am the statue of a Sacred One, venerated by all nations beneath Heaven. Yet the folk of this countryside are too ignorant—they have used me to prop up the dam. The one who did this has been punished by the Spiritual Official, the protective deity of the Dao, and has already passed beyond. Unless you retrieve me from beneath the dam, this Tangxing Weir will never be properly mended.”

At dawn, the steward recounted the dream to the villagers. They prepared an incense altar and set about cleansing the dam. Indeed, they uncovered a stone statue of the Heavenly Venerable. Though long submerged, the figure’s black hair and golden crown remained unmarred, its colors vivid and radiant.

Moved by this marvel, the villagers built a temple to enshrine and honor the statue. From that day forth, all petitions were answered with certainty, and the Tangxing Weir never again suffered breach or collapse.
