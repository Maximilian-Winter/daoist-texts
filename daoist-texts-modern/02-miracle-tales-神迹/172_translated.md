# The Lady of Lang in Hebei Recites the Precious Name of the Ancestral Lord of Thunder and Feels the Response

Lady Lang, a native of Tangshan in Hebei, once encountered a sudden and grave trial. One day, her daughter was seized by a fierce fever. Seeking aid, she consulted a local shamaness, who declared: “There is an empty house nearby where a black serpent basks in the sun. Your child happened to glance through the door’s mirror inward, and the black serpent caught sight of her. Thus, it has clung to your child’s spirit.” Lady Lang was deeply distressed and asked if there was any remedy. The shamaness lamented that she was powerless to help.

Desperate, Lady Lang took her child to the hospital, but all examinations showed normal signs—no ailment could be found to explain the fever’s source.

While administering fever-reducing injections, Lady Lang sought solutions far and wide. Suddenly, she recalled a devout Daoist friend, Disciple Shen. She reached out to him and recounted the whole matter, inquiring if he knew of any countermeasures. Disciple Shen replied, “Drawing talismans to catch ghosts—such arts I do not master. Yet I remember from the *Jade Pivot Scripture* this teaching: ‘The Heavenly Venerable said: When one dwells in a place, black rats deliver demons; snakes and insects marry calamities; bricks and tiles are thrown; chickens and dogs are disturbed; invitations to offerings arise; shadows threaten in dreams; thieves and villains appear. They dare to claim their dwelling as a nest, causing living beings to be ensnared. Courtyards unclean, night howls upon beams, by day they watch the chambers; cattle, horses, dogs, and pigs suffer pestilence. Misfortune strikes kin, disaster afflicts offspring; licentious shrines and demon societies flourish; factions and spirits conspire; mourners come in succession; funeral carts follow one after another. If one recites this scripture, even the most cunning ghosts vanish, and all beings find peace.’ You might try chanting the sacred name of the Heavenly Venerable of the Nine Heavens’ Responsive Origin and Universal Thunder Transformation. His vow is vast and profound, his virtue mighty and expansive. Surely this will bear some effect.” Lady Lang asked, “For how long should I recite it?” Disciple Shen answered, “Until the fever subsides.”

Thus, Lady Lang began to chant the sacred name of the Heavenly Venerable. After about twenty minutes, her child’s fever abated. Thereafter, all remained stable. Disciple Shen himself often recites the sacred name of the Heavenly Venerable, and over many years has found smooth success. Deeply moved by the compassionate vow of the Heavenly Venerable, he shared this story with me, urging all to chant the illustrious precious name of the Heavenly Venerable.

(With gratitude to Disciple Shen for providing this account. May the Heavenly Venerable’s grace shine upon us all, and the Dao’s energy be fully realized!)

A hymn of praise:

Grateful for the Heavenly Venerable’s profound vow,  
Compassionately unfolding the Dharma to all beings.  
Should one call upon the Heavenly Venerable’s name,  
Evil spirits vanish like smoke and dust.
