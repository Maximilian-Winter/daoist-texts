# The Miraculous Efficacy of Reciting the Ten-Character Heavenly Scripture by Lady Lin Yin of Wenzhou

Lady Lin Yin, a native of Yongjia in Wenzhou, dwelt within the grand mansion known as the Wangfu Tower in Wenzhou. It is said that the very ground beneath the Wangfu Tower was once a place of execution, and thus, strange and numinous occurrences were frequent. Throughout the year, several souls leapt from the heights in despair. When four gathered to play mahjong, nine spectral hands would reach forth to touch the tiles. Such uncanny happenings abounded.

Some geomancers whispered that the name “Wangfu Tower” was too grandiose, ill-suited for a modest locale, and that this mismatch stirred restless energies.

At first, after moving into the Wangfu Tower, Lady Lin found peace. Yet soon, oppressive spirits weighed upon her at night, pressing down so heavily she could scarcely breathe. At times, in the dead of night, sounds echoed through her chambers—like objects cast to the floor by unseen hands. Troubled deeply, Lady Lin sought counsel from a Daoist brother.

This disciple of the Dao spoke thus: “Within the Daoist pantheon dwells a deity known as the Heavenly Venerable of the Nine Heavens’ Responding Primordial Thunder, Universal Transformation. This august Sovereign has sworn a mighty vow: whosoever sincerely utters His sacred name shall receive the protection of His thunderous potency, banishing all malevolent spirits afar. You might try reciting the venerable title of this Heavenly Venerable.”

Obedient to this guidance, Lady Lin began each night to silently chant the sacred name of the Heavenly Venerable many times over. On one such night, awakened suddenly, she glimpsed shadowy forms stirring beyond her window, and chilling winds swept through the air like restless phantoms. Hastily, she intoned aloud: “Heavenly Venerable of the Nine Heavens’ Responding Primordial Thunder, Universal Transformation!”

In an instant, the dark shadows vanished as if struck by a celestial bolt.

With heartfelt devotion she continued to chant:

“Heavenly Venerable of the Nine Heavens’ Responding Primordial Thunder, Universal Transformation!  
Heavenly Venerable of the Nine Heavens’ Responding Primordial Thunder, Universal Transformation!  
Heavenly Venerable of the Nine Heavens’ Responding Primordial Thunder, Universal Transformation!”
