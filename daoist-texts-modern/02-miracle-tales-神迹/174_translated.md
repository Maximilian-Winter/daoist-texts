# The Daoist Physician of Mount Hua: Xu Jiayan

Xu Jiayan, a Daoist of the Mount Hua lineage, was skilled in the art of traditional medicine. In the twenty-first year of the Republic, he took vows at the Maonü Grotto on Mount Hua. His medical skill was exquisite, his virtue and art both radiant. Near and far, those afflicted with perplexing ailments, if they sought out Daoist Master Xu, found their troubles effortlessly resolved—his wondrous hands restoring the spring of life.

In the year nineteen ninety-two, the lay devotee Wang Jianjun of Beijing, moved by reverence for the mysterious winds, abandoned his worldly work and came to the Maonü Grotto on Mount Hua. There, he humbly offered himself to the tasks of sweeping and tending, guarding Daoist Master Xu Jiayan in his cultivation. He chopped wood, carried water, kindled fires, and cooked meals—never shirking hardship. Thus he served for three years.

In the spring of nineteen ninety-four, the mountain winds blew fiercely, dislodging several tiles from the roof of the place where Daoist Master Xu and his companions dwelt. To prevent the house from leaking, Wang Jianjun resolved to climb up and mend the tiles. But misfortune struck—he slipped and fell from the roof. At that moment, Daoist Master Xu was inside concocting medicines. Hearing a sudden cry outside the window, he came forth and saw Wang Jianjun collapsed on the ground, unconscious.

From his gourd, Daoist Master Xu drew forth a single pill, dissolving it in water. Before the image of the Patriarch, he offered a prayer. With his left hand, he formed the Three Mountains hand seal, holding the bowl; with his right, he traced secret talismanic patterns upon the water with the sword hand seal. Then he presented the medicinal draught to Wang Jianjun, who drank it down. In the span of about one incense stick’s burning, Wang Jianjun awakened. He told Daoist Master Xu, “I just dreamed that a golden-armored divine general entered my body and seized something away.” Daoist Master Xu replied, “The immortals and perfected ones gather on Mount Hua, and many spirits and demons abound. Because your heart has stirred with worldly dust these past days, the mountain spirits came near. I used the Ghost-Dispelling Pill to drive them away. Like calls answering calls, like breaths seeking breaths—henceforth, you must diligently cultivate the good Dao, and auspicious spirits will naturally protect you. Should deluded thoughts arise again, you must not remain here long.”

From then on, Wang Jianjun served Daoist Master Xu with greater care, and in his leisure, he also sat in quiet meditation.

Though Daoist Master Xu used his healing arts to aid and save the world, he never neglected sitting in stillness and reciting scriptures. Whenever he chanted sutras in his humble hut, the Tibetan mastiffs from over a li away would come and lie outside, listening. The tigers and leopards of the mountain, too, were all subdued and respectful. Sometimes, visitors climbing the mountain, seeing Daoist Master Xu’s devoted practice, wished to offer support, but Daoist Master Xu always declined.

In the spring of two thousand five, at over eighty years of age, Daoist Master Xu told Wang Jianjun, “I am going to cultivate at Kunlun Mountain; I shall depart in a few days.” In the early days of the third lunar month, he descended the mountain carrying a qin and a sword, and thereafter vanished without a trace.

A eulogy says:  
Master Xu yearned for the Dao, leaving the dust of the mundane;  
For decades he dwelt in seclusion on Mount Hua’s springs.  
His medicine could strike down demons—no falsehood in this;  
Lightly, with qin and sword, he ascended to Kunlun’s heights.
