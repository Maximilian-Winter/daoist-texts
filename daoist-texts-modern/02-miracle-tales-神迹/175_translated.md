# The Tale of Daoist Zhao Liqing of Mount Hua’s Attainment of the Dao

Zhao Liqing hailed from Datong in Shanxi. Born into a family steeped in literary refinement, he early harbored a yearning to transcend the mundane world. When he reached the age of twenty, his family pressed him into marriage, but he fled instead to Mount Wutai’s Puji Monastery to become a monk, taking the dharma name Juehai. Master Juehai devoted himself to the arduous cultivation of Buddhist teachings. Amidst chanting Buddha’s name and meditating on the Chan, he delved deeply into the sutras. Yet a persistent sense of incompletion gnawed at him; the doctrines of reincarnation and transmigration seemed but fleeting shadows, unable to truly satisfy or still his heart.

One day, a Daoist wandered to Mount Wutai. Upon meeting him, Juehai felt an instant kinship and eagerly inquired into the Daoist methods of cultivation: the wondrous arts of secret gates and hidden transformations, the power to pierce mountains and shatter stones, to sever evil and banish ghosts, and the inner alchemy of longevity. The Daoist patiently expounded each in turn, then added, “My own practice is still shallow. Mount Hua, the Western Peak, is a blessed land where many sages and hermits dwell. If fate allows, you might journey there to seek them out.”

The next day, Juehai sought the Daoist at the Yunshui Hall, but the steward said, “He left early this morning and has not returned.” From then on, Juehai’s longing for the Dao grew ever more fervent. Witnessing the monks’ worldly corruption and various indignities only deepened his resolve. In the third year of the Guangxu reign, he departed Mount Wutai and traveled to Mount Hua to pay homage. At Yuquan Temple, he took refuge under the venerable elder Li Yixing, becoming a disciple of the Mount Hua tradition and receiving the Dao name Liqing.

Only after entering the Dao did Zhao Liqing realize the profound depths of learning. Master Li imparted to him the Mount Hua sect’s “Sleeping Dragon” technique: a practice of deep slumber—thirty days of light sleep, one hundred days of profound sleep. While reclining, the practitioner unites the waters and fires within, harmonizing the Four Symbols. After a year, Liqing’s complexion glowed with radiance, and his visage appeared younger than when he first arrived. Later, amid the chaos of war, Daoist Liqing found himself alone, retreating to a small hermitage on Mount Hua’s lesser peak. Yuquan Temple sent provisions periodically. About half a year later, Liqing instructed the attendant boy delivering the food, “You see the offerings you bring—I do not eat them. It troubles you to make the journey. Do not bring food again. Come back in three months to see me.” The boy obeyed.

Three months later, the temple sent people up as usual. They found Daoist Zhao Liqing seated upright in a stone cavern, motionless, his body covered in dust. The attendant boy was terrified and hurried down the mountain. He reported what he saw to the elder practitioners at Yuquan Temple. Several Daoists agreed to ascend and investigate. The elder approached and tested for breath—none; the pulse had ceased; no sign of life remained. Yet the skin was supple, and the body emitted a faint warmth. The elder declared, “This one has already formed the infant within, but the yang spirit remains sealed inside, unable to find its way out. We must use the sounding stone to draw it forth.” Thus, near Zhao Liqing’s ear, the elder gently struck the chime three times to summon the spirit.

Soon, Daoist Liqing began to open his mouth and speak, clasping hands in gratitude to his fellow cultivators for their aid. The accompanying Daoists urged him to descend the mountain and cease his practice, suggesting that by stopping, he might live several more years. Daoist Liqing replied, “My infant is already formed, and I am gradually finding the way out. Soon I shall ascend on the winds.” He resolutely refused to come down. The Daoists could only shake their heads and depart, saying, “We will return to see you in time.”

About thirty days later, it was already the eleventh lunar month. Snow began to fall heavily upon the mountain, deepening the chill. One night, thunder roared mightily, lightning flashed and thunderclaps echoed through the valleys, shattering hearts with their terror. All sensed the strangeness of the weather—perhaps a sign of the nation’s waning fortune, thus these portents. Some Daoist friends worried for Daoist Liqing’s safety in the small hermitage. The thunderstorm lasted about half an hour before ceasing. The snow stopped, clouds dispersed, and the bright moon shone over a thousand li.

From the small hermitage came the faint sounds of silk and bamboo instruments, drifting away on the night air.

The next day, all ascended the mountain to visit Daoist Liqing, only to find the cavern filled with celestial fragrance, but the Daoist himself nowhere to be found.
