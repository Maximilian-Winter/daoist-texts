# Li Dongming of Xi’an Supports a Recluse and Feels the Response

Li Dongming was a native of Xi’an. He made his living by writing and cherished the teachings of the dao. Whenever he encountered the Three Treasures, a reverent heart would arise within him. The Zhongnan Mountains were home to many recluses; during his leisure, Li Dongming would often attend the Daoist lectures held by the Eight Immortals Palace and the recluses of Zhongnan. One purpose was to deepen his knowledge of the dao; another was to make the acquaintance of more Daoist masters.

In the spring of the year of the Wood Tiger, Li Dongming was enjoying himself at a tavern in Chang’an not far from the Eight Immortals Palace when he saw several Daoist priests drinking tea. He approached to greet them, and after introductions, they began to chat idly. Among the Daoists was one named Lu Xuanqi, originally from southern Guizhou. At the age of twenty, he had entered the Zhongnan Mountains to cultivate, and now five or six years had passed. His complexion was dark as dusk, yet his eyes shone brightly; standing about one meter and sixty centimeters tall, he smoked a large pipe. His speech was refined, and Li Dongming was immediately taken with him, inviting the Daoists to a meal.

In their conversation, Li Dongming learned of the hardships Lu Xuanqi endured in his cultivation on Zhongnan Mountain. Though he occasionally came to the Eight Immortals Palace to receive some rice and flour, he had no other income. Moved, Li Dongming resolved to support this Daoist. He said, “Daoist Lu, no need to say more. If ever you lack money, just tell me. A few hundred yuan a month is no trouble at all.” With Li Dongming’s patronage, Lu Xuanqi cultivated peacefully on Zhongnan Mountain. In the year of the Fire Dog, he passed through the Three Passes and turned the River Cart. He received a divine instruction to journey to Wuyi Mountain in Fujian to seek a destined master.

A few days after Daoist Lu departed for Wuyi Mountain, Li Dongming dreamed of a youth clad in vermilion who told him, “Because of your merit in supporting the true man, an order has been issued to increase your stipend.” Not long after, a friend called Li Dongming, inviting him to enter into a business partnership. Having now laid down his pen to engage in commerce, his fortune soared to one million yuan!
