# The Story of Daoist Master Liu Yongning of Qingcheng Mountain

Daoist Master Liu Yongning hailed from Luling in the region of Jiangyou. Born into a family devoted to the dao, he was steeped in its teachings from childhood. During the Cultural Revolution, he was publicly denounced, and his wife was scattered from the household. After his name was cleared, he resolved to retreat into seclusion on Qingcheng Mountain. There, he entered a three-year period of closed-door cultivation, never descending the mountain.

In the year nineteen ninety-six, he suddenly appeared at Qingyang Palace to lodge as a guest. The temple arranged for him to keep vigil in the Hall of the Eight Trigrams. Whenever Master Liu was on duty, he would simply close his eyes and sit upright in stillness. Pilgrims came to burn incense and kowtow, but he paid them no heed. The temple authorities were greatly displeased by this.

Master Liu said, “Do not be angry. At night, I will watch over your parking lot for you.” The steward replied, “Then we are much obliged to you, venerable cultivator.” So, at night, Master Liu would guard the parking lot, sitting cross-legged in meditation, draped in a thin woolen blanket. Even in the bitter cold of midwinter, he remained unchanged.

Master Liu did not consume the five grains; instead, he long took powders of poria, pine needles, goji berries, and chrysanthemum flowers. When thirsty, he drank cold water. Sometimes he would go days without eating, yet his spirit never waned. When climbing the mountain, even young men could not keep pace with him. He was skilled in the art of incantations.

Once, while traveling on Qingcheng Mountain, a tourist accidentally fell and bled profusely from the hand. Master Liu happened to pass by, and the tourist sought his aid. The master said, “It is nothing, it is nothing.” With a jade script in his left hand and a sword gesture in his right, he traced the bleeding spot in the air a few times, and the bleeding quickly ceased.

Another time, a lay devotee suffering from sores came seeking healing, drawn by Master Liu’s reputation. The master traced a few secret talismanic marks, and soon the pus began to discharge on its own. Sometimes he would draw with incense ash, other times with burning yellow paper, and sometimes he would rub dust and grime from his own body onto the afflicted person. His methods were manifold and varied, yet illnesses often responded swiftly to his touch.

Thus, many from the Chengdu region and beyond came to him seeking cures, some offering gifts in gratitude. But Master Liu accepted no money, saying, “This old daoist wants no coin, no coin.” Occasionally, when he did receive money, he would casually give it away to the poor by the roadside. When wealthy patrons came to seek healing, bringing many offerings and money, Master Liu would refuse both payment and treatment, claiming ignorance, or feigning madness with song and chant, or sitting silently without rising. When asked, “Why do you not treat them?” he replied, “Some illnesses in this world are entangled with karmic bonds from past lives; no method or technique can heal them.”

He dwelled at Qingyang Palace for more than three years, then suddenly told the temple community, “My功果 is now complete; I may return.” In the third month on the third day of the year nineteen ninety-nine, he sat in stillness and transformed.

Around the fifth month, a fellow Daoist came from Mount Hua to Qingyang Palace and said, “An old cultivator named Liu Yongning arrived at Yuquan Courtyard, having come from your Qingyang Palace. He stayed a few days and then left. I wonder where he keeps vigil in the hall?” The temple community replied, “Master Liu passed beyond form on the third day of the third month this year.” Only then did they realize that what had appeared was but an illusory manifestation of corpse liberation. In truth, he had already ascended to the Purple Mansion, taken his place among the ranks of immortals, and wandered the Five Sacred Mountains.
