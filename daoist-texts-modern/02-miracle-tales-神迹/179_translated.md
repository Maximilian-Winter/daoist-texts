# The Verified Efficacy of a Woman in Lidu Town, Nanchang, Performing the Dou Ritual to Expel Evil

In Lidu Town, Nanchang, there lived a woman surnamed Sun who, for many years, was tormented by malevolent spirits. Her body was icy cold, her belly constantly gurgling. At night, when she tried to sleep, there would always be someone knocking at her door. Yet whenever she opened it, there was nothing there. Such disturbances went on for many years. She sought doctors and medicines, but all proved futile.

She recounted that in her twenties, after giving birth and while observing the month of confinement at home, she heard a child crying outside the door at night. She opened it to look, but the child had vanished. Then a beam of light flew into her body. She saw a man in the courtyard say, “That thing is troublesome; I entrust it to you for care.”

Though Sun appeared outwardly like any ordinary person, the intrusion of these spirits caused her great entanglement. Her mind was often unclear and unsettled. Years passed, and now in her forties, her countenance was dim, her vital energy withered, and her hair streaked with white.

In the year two thousand and ten, a Daoist named Zhang Youqin from Xishan came to reside at the Wanshou Palace in Lidu, overseeing the teaching and ritual affairs, restoring the ancestral Daoist sanctuary. Sun, having long admired the secret arts of Daoism—those with the power to revive the dead and the ability to dispel calamities and ferry souls across dangers—came to Wanshou Palace and bowed in supplication, seeking aid.

The Daoist priest, moved by her suffering, examined her fate and destiny, discerning that this was a karmic grievance from a past life, whose retribution had now come due and could be resolved. Thus, he consented to her plea.

At Wanshou Palace in Lidu, he established a jiao altar, summoning the celestial troops of the Linting and the officers and generals of the Dou Mansion. Each soared like clouds and lightning, riding cranes and dragons, wielding axes and halberds, treading upon auspicious clouds. Their blades flashed brilliantly; their ranks stood formidable and awe-inspiring.

Sun would at times prostrate herself on the ground, sweating profusely; at other moments, she would wail loudly, looking up to the heavens with a long sigh. Yet the voice was that of a man, not her usual tone.

After about the time it takes for an incense stick to burn, Sun regained clarity. Her expression brightened with joy as she said, “Just now it seemed a general came, leading a troop of soldiers, and took away the thing that was clinging to me. Now I feel so much lighter. I thank Daoist Zhang for his grace!”

The *Scripture of the Northern Dipper* says: “The Great Saints, the Seven Primordial Lords of the Northern Dipper, can dispel malevolent spirits and calamities.” The Northern Dipper can resolve all hardships, saving and delivering those who honor the Dao. The Polar Exorcism Courtyard is specially charged with expelling demons and subduing fiends. From this, it is clear that these are no empty words.
