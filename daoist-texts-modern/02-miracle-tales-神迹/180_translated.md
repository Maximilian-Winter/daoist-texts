# Cao Yongchun Explores the Five Elders’ Cavern

Cao Yongchun, a Daoist priest of Jianfu Palace on Mount Qingcheng, was known for his eccentric ways. Fellow Daoists all regarded him as a madman. In the year nineteen ninety-two, he suddenly told his companions at Jianfu Palace, “Last night I dreamed of the Green Snake. She invited me to visit the Five Elders’ Cavern.” Now, Mount Qingcheng was originally the place where Bai Suzhen and the Green Snake cultivated their Dao. The Green Snake and Bai Snake had even practiced in the Five Elders’ Cavern on Mount Emei. Mount Emei was once a Daoist grotto paradise, and legend held that the Five Elders’ Cavern was a path leading to the immortal realm—but no one had ever ventured there. The Daoist friends dismissed Cao Yongchun’s words as the ravings of a madman and paid no heed.

At Chengdu’s Wenshu Monastery, the monk Puming was close to Cao Daozhang. When he heard that Cao Daozhang intended to journey to the Five Elders’ Cavern on Mount Emei, he eagerly asked to accompany him.

The two, Daoist Cao Yongchun and Monk Puming, arrived at the mouth of the Five Elders’ Cavern on Mount Emei. At the entrance, they arranged offerings of fruit, lit three incense sticks, and burned some paper money. They prayed aloud: “Mountain spirits and earth gods, this humble Daoist comes by invitation. I hope you will grant us safe passage.” After finishing their prayer, they switched on a flashlight and entered the cavern.

The entrance narrowed steadily, barely wide enough for one person to crawl through. After about five minutes, the space suddenly opened up. Inside, the cavern was cold and damp; bats flew out from the shadows, and venomous snakes coiled beneath their feet. Monk Puming asked, “If we go further, will we run out of air?” Cao Daozhang replied, “No matter. Since they called me here, surely there is no danger.” So they pressed on deeper. Unfortunately, the cavern branched in many directions, with occasional deep pools and muddy swamps.

After about one hour, Cao Daozhang said, “Look, there is light ahead. We must be close.” The two walked toward the glowing place, only to find the light shifting to another spot. They moved toward that new glow, but again the light slipped away elsewhere. This happened repeatedly. They faintly felt a warmth growing, and after going a bit further, the two suddenly found themselves outside the cavern. They met two tourists, and Monk Puming hurried to ask, “Amitabha Buddha, may I ask where we are?” The tourists replied, “Master, this is Xianfeng Temple on Mount Emei!” Only then did the two realize they were no longer inside the cavern.

Cao Yongchun felt furious and said, “That Green Snake actually tricked me! I’m furious!” At that moment, a voice echoed from Xianfeng Cliff: “The immortal’s taboo lies in secrecy. I had intended to invite you to enjoy the immortal realm, but who told you to bring a monk along? Were it not for the respect this monk usually shows to the Dao, my disciples would have bitten you to death inside the Five Elders’ Cavern long ago. And you say I deceived you?” At this, Cao Daozhang was filled with deep regret.
