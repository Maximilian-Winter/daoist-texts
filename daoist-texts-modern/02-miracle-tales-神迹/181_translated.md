# The Devout Response of Master Jin to the Yellow Emperor

Master Jin, a native of Lishui, in the year two thousand and thirteen took on the lease of the teahouse within the shrine of the Yellow Emperor. At first, his intent was simply to earn some silver. Yet the fortunes of business were never prosperous. Still, Master Jin bore no vexation; rather, his reverence deepened. Each day upon arriving at work, he would enter the great hall and offer homage to Xuanyuan, the Yellow Emperor. Often he would say to his wife, “To serve within the temple is a merit in itself. Whether or not coin flows, the cleanliness of the teahouse must be upheld.”

In time, due to other affairs, he departed from the Yellow Emperor’s shrine.

Not long after leaving the shrine, Master Jin, General Manager Zhang, and an elder named Old Gen from the northeast set out by carriage toward Jiangxi. Zhang was at the reins. They traveled along the highway near Jiujiang, the road smooth and clear; laughter and talk filled the air. Suddenly, the carriage struck the guardrail on one side, then bounced to the opposite guardrail, then rebounded again to the first. With a great roar, the carriage caught fire. Yet Master Jin emerged unscathed—only his spectacles were shattered. Zhang, the driver, had a gash above his brow, blood flowing freely. Master Jin hastened to lift Zhang from the carriage. Then he called out, “Old Gen! Old Gen!” No answer came. Feeling along the ground, he found hair scattered about and thought, “This is grave; Old Gen must be dead.” Yet then he recalled, “No, Old Gen has no hair,” and continued searching. At that moment, farmers below the highway shouted, “He’s over here!” It turned out Old Gen had been thrown more than ten meters away, tumbling beneath the highway. Though his bones were cracked, he was alive.

Soon the traffic officers arrived, rescuing Master Jin and Old Gen from beneath the highway. One officer asked Master Jin, “Are you unharmed?” Jin replied, “I am well.” The officer cautioned, “Don’t speak. We have seen many accidents; often those who seem fine speak and then suddenly vomit blood and perish. Sit with us in the carriage and remain still.” Thus, Master Jin, Zhang, and Old Gen were taken together to Poyang Hospital. A thorough examination revealed no injuries. Master Jin then took a rickshaw to replace his spectacles. Returning to the hospital, the head nurse arrived with a group of attendants. Upon seeing Master Jin, they touched him reverently. Puzzled, he asked why. The nurses said, “Today a great lucky star has come among us; we all wish to share in this fortune.”

Master Jin reflected: under such circumstances, disaster would surely have struck. Yet he was unharmed. Why? It must be the protection of Xuanyuan, the Yellow Emperor. For when he served in the shrine, his heart was sincere and kind; he maintained the temple with care. Though his offerings were modest, his earnestness moved the numinous powers.
