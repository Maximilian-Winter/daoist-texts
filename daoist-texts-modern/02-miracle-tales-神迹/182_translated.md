# The Case of Official Jin Entering the Yellow Emperor’s Shrine Without Bowing

In the immortal capital mountains of Jinyun, Lishui, stands the Yellow Emperor’s shrine—a temple dedicated to the venerated cultural progenitor, Xuanyuan Huangdi. Throughout the ages, its numinous efficacy has shone forth unmistakably, beyond all exhaustive record. Since the shrine’s founding, many high officials of the imperial court have come to pay homage. Even the current sovereign, during his tenure as Prefect of Zhejiang’s Longqian, once visited to pay respects to Xuanyuan Huangdi. The very next year, he was summoned to the capital and elevated to the position of Grand Minister assisting in governance.

Some years ago, there was an official named Jin from a certain department in a certain city. He journeyed to the Immortal Capital Mountain for leisure and entered the Xuanyuan Hall without kneeling or bowing, boldly declaring himself a materialist. After leaving the hall, he soon felt his legs grow unsteady; he frequently stumbled and fell to his knees while walking. At first, he paid it no mind. Later, when visiting Mount Putuo, an elderly monk renowned for his cultivation approached him and said, “Sir, did you happen to visit the temple last month without kneeling in reverence?”

Jin replied, “Yes, how do you know this?”

The monk said, “I saw a divine warrior following behind you, wielding a staff and striking your calves. Have you often found yourself unable to stand firm, falling to your knees?”

Jin was greatly alarmed and said, “Indeed! Last month I went to the Yellow Emperor’s shrine on Immortal Capital Mountain but did not kowtow or offer incense to Xuanyuan Huangdi. Could this be the cause?”

The monk answered, “It should be. This divine warrior claims to be a guardian spirit under the command of Xuanyuan Huangdi.”

At once, Jin called the mountain’s steward official and said he wished to return to pay homage to the Yellow Emperor. The steward replied, “Did you not just come a few days ago?” Jin then recounted the entire matter.

Jin returned to the Xuanyuan Hall on Immortal Capital Mountain, respectfully offered three incense sticks, and performed three kneelings and nine kowtows, worshiping according to ritual. He confessed his pride and arrogance. After completing the rites, he no longer stumbled when walking. Thus he realized the awe-inspiring potency of Xuanyuan Huangdi—how majestic and numinous the divine presence above is, and how utterly insignificant one’s self is in comparison! Yet the divine transcends material concerns and does not require whether one bows or not. To bow does not increase its exaltation; to withhold bowing does not diminish its power. This is because the sage spirits, with patient and earnest teaching, wish only that Jin might relinquish his arrogance and cultivate humility. Upon careful reflection, this is a skillful and expedient instruction.

Praise says:  
The progenitor of Huaxia is named Xuanyuan,  
Who forged the cauldron and ascended to the Nine Heavens.  
Ignorant mortals, proud and self-important,  
Bring down the divine power’s wrath and punishment.
