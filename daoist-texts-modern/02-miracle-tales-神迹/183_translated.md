# The Account of Daoist Friend Jiang’s Return to the Primordial through Thunder Refinement on Weiyu Mountain

Jiang Zhizhen, a Daoist of the True Martial Temple in Longxi, was a man whose precepts were strict and whose conduct was precise. He transmitted the Thunder Method of the Divine Firmament. The northwest is a land of fierce winds and drifting sands. Once, a great gale swept through, hurling sand and stones, uprooting mighty trees as if they were but sprouts. A lay devotee sent word to Jiang Zhizhen, urging him to take shelter. Yet at that moment, Jiang Zhizhen was burning incense and chanting scriptures, unmoved by the warning. He formed hand seals and stepped the cosmic pattern. Half an hour later, he stepped outside to find that every dwelling within a measure of ten feet beyond the temple had been ravaged by the storm—except the True Martial Temple itself, which stood untouched by the fierce wind. Jiang Zhizhen’s garments were often rumpled, and he cared little for trifles. He frequently claimed to be an officer of the Thunder Division, demoted to the human realm for some transgression, now engaged in cultivation.

In the year nineteen eighty-nine, Jiang Zhizhen journeyed to Weiyu Mountain to visit fellow Daoist practitioners. One day, a Daoist friend proposed a pilgrimage to the Jingfu Palace on the mountain’s rear slope to pay homage to the Patriarch. Jiang Zhizhen said, “Since we are to honor the Patriarch, I shall don new clothes!” So he washed and groomed himself, putting on fresh robes: a primordial headscarf, cloud-patterned socks, shoes, and a long gown—all newly made. Several Daoist friends, laughing and chatting, ascended the mountain together. It was around the third lunar month. As they climbed, a light rain began to fall, and they took refuge in a small temple by the roadside. Suddenly, Jiang Zhizhen turned to his companions and said, “Friends, I will go ahead.” The others found this odd and asked, “It’s raining outside—where do you intend to go?” Before the words had fully left their lips, a bolt of thunder crashed down from the heavens, lightning flashing and the thunderclap shaking the earth. Jiang Zhizhen had already transformed into an immortal, his spirit taking flight. Two other Daoist friends who accompanied him were stunned by the thunder’s shock.

One of the companions recounted, “I saw the hand of the Lord of Thunder—it looked like a chicken’s claw reaching to seize me, but then it withdrew.” Afterwards, the temple arranged a burial for Daoist Jiang. When changing his clothes, they discovered a black mark on his chest, resembling a crow.

The Iron-Crowned Daoist said: “In the Tang dynasty, Li Yuanba was a warrior unmatched in valor and might. It is said he was the reincarnation of a general of the Thunder Division, later recalled by the Thunder Department. Daoist Master Jiang Zhizhen possessed extraordinary gifts and profound cultivation; it seems he has returned to the primordial. Moreover, from my reading of the Daoist scriptures, the crow is the messenger of the Thunder Division. The mark on Master Jiang’s chest must be the token left by the Thunder messenger.”
