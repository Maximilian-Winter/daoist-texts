# The Legendary Story of Offering Veneration to the Image of Celestial Master Zhang

In Pengcheng (present-day Xuzhou), when Liu Cunxi was but a child, he wandered to the Tangxing Temple and beheld the image of the Celestial Master. Deep within his heart, a profound reverence arose. With delicate silk, he traced the likeness of the image, so that he might offer it veneration at any time, for he had heard that to serve the Celestial Master Zhang with a single-minded heart would surely bring his protection.

As years passed and Liu Cun grew to manhood, he became an official. Wherever he was assigned to serve, he always carried this portrait with him, never lacking incense or offerings for a single day. In one year, when rebel forces attacked and the city fell, he fled with many others, able to take nothing but this very image of the Celestial Master. Along the way, more than thirty companions were slain by bandits, yet he emerged untouched, not a single hair harmed.

One day, he came upon a great throng of refugees gathered in a noisy clamor. Amidst the tumult, he discerned the voice of his lost wife. Filled with both astonishment and joy, he called to her, bidding her join him. Together, husband and wife journeyed to the deep mountain forests of Dayan Rock in Yangzhou, where the land seemed relatively peaceful. There they built a humble thatched hut and dwelt. Having no children, their life was not overly difficult. They resolved to retire from officialdom, no longer chasing fame or profit. The local people treated them with great kindness, often bringing oil, salt, firewood, and rice, seeing their lack of livelihood. Each day, with nothing pressing to do, they gathered cypress seeds from the mountain and burned them in offering before the image of the Celestial Master.

Yet, before long, the times grew stable. His old friend, Governor Song, attained a high post and prepared official robes, insisting that Liu Cun return to office. Though he declined repeatedly, he could not refuse and reluctantly took up his post. But war soon flared anew, forcing him once more to flee. This time he escaped to a mountain in Shazhou. After only four months, rebel forces came searching the hills. Seeing this was no place to hide, he planned to journey to Pinglu and set out again with his wife.

On a certain midnight, they encountered more than ten bandits on the road, who were escorting several captives. They could not evade and were seized with terror, thinking surely this time they would fall into the hands of thieves. Yet, to their astonishment, these enemies passed by them as if they were invisible, paying them no heed. Thus, they reached their destination unharmed.

Later, he was ordered to serve in Sichuan, where he continued with unwavering devotion to the veneration of the Celestial Masterâ€™s image. Wherever he went, he told the tale of how the Celestial Master had protected him, leaving behind this cherished story for all to hear.
