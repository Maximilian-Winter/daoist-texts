# The Tale of the Benevolent Mason Who Met an Immortal and Was Bestowed the Heavenly Master's Talisman

In the city of Chengdu lived a mason named Xie Zhen, a craftsman of exquisite skill and a man of honest, sincere virtue. Once, he journeyed to the summit of Crane-Singing Mountain, where the Upper Clarity Palace stood. Though the palace’s architecture was grand and majestic, time had worn it down; bricks were broken, tiles shattered, and the earthen walls crumbled, leaving only a scene of desolation and decay. The Daoist priests residing there told him that the Celestial Master Zhang had once cultivated the dao in this very place, and that this Upper Clarity Palace was the edifice he had built in days of old. Xie Zhen had heard many legends of the Celestial Master and held him in deep reverence. Seeing the palace so fallen into ruin, he vowed with great resolve to restore it to its former glory.

Yet Xie Zhen was but a humble mason, and his household was not wealthy. To gather funds for the restoration, he not only put forth his savings accumulated over many years but also traveled far and wide to seek donations. Every coin and grain he received was devoted entirely to the temple’s repair. Employing his masterful masonry, he plastered the walls so they were both sturdy and beautiful, adorning them with numerous murals that celebrated and propagated the dao’s teachings. Because Crane-Singing Mountain rose high and lay remote, with difficult roads and costly transport, moving materials was arduous and expensive. To prevent the work from halting, Xie Zhen was forced to sell his possessions and hire more hands, and only thus did the project press forward.

One day, as he painted upon a wall, a tall Daoist elder entered through the main gate, accompanied by two young acolytes. The elder was tall and vigorous, his long beard flowing down upon his chest, embodying the very spirit of transcendent Daoist grace. Approaching Xie Zhen, the elder observed his toil for a moment and then spoke: “Your heart is sincere, your will steadfast, wholly devoted to restoring this temple. Such devotion is rare indeed. Yet you have spent all your wealth, and surely your life ahead will be difficult. Now, allow me to teach you a method to earn your daily bread. Watch carefully and remember well.” With that, he drew upon the ground with a twig a strange pattern—neither fully character nor mere design—within which faint numinous light shimmered and overflowed. The elder said to Xie Zhen, “This is a talisman for saving lives and healing sickness. Once you learn to draw this talisman, you may use it to treat the ill. Charge only a modest fee; so long as you do not grow greedy, the talisman’s power will ensure your clothing and food are never lacking.” Before Xie Zhen could respond, the elder had already vanished with serene composure.

Xie Zhen recalled the elder’s method and, following the pattern traced upon the earth, copied it again and again, until after three days it was firmly engraved in his heart. When the temple’s restoration was complete, a plague swept through his hometown. He then tried drawing the talisman to heal the sick—and to his astonishment, it was remarkably efficacious. Gradually, his fame spread throughout the region. Many came seeking talismans, and though he charged little or sometimes nothing at all, his household’s fortunes slowly recovered. All this was the gift of that immortal elder! Yet Xie Zhen’s heart remained restless, wondering: who exactly was this divine being?

One day, a wealthy merchant from another place held a grand ritual locally, with a divine altar displaying a portrait of an immortal. Xie Zhen approached and saw—it was none other than the immortal elder who had taught him the talisman! He inquired of the merchant, “Who is this immortal?” The merchant replied, “This is the Celestial Master Zhang.” Filled with awe, Xie Zhen immediately commissioned an artist to paint a large portrait of the Celestial Master, which he then hung in the Upper Clarity Palace, so that devotees from the Ten Directions might come to pay homage.
