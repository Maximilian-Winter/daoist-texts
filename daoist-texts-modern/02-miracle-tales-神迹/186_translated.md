# The Story of Wu from Beijing Who Slandered the Scriptures and Teachings

Wu, a man from Beijing, delighted in critiquing the classics, ever confident in his own understanding. One day, within a WeChat group, he cast doubt and debated the sayings “The Wu Day Does Not Face the True” and the “Quanzhen Precepts,” declaring that “The Wu Day Does Not Face the True” was nonsense, for in former times the Wu day was still an auspicious day. He further claimed that the Quanzhen Precepts were merely imitations borrowed from Buddhism, and so forth.

At the fifth watch of the following day, in the midst of night, Wu dreamed that he drifted to the peak of a mountain. Before him, clouds and mists swirled, lofty pavilions rose like towers, and in row upon row, disciples clad in yellow robes sat cross-legged within the halls. Suddenly, a figure robed in red appeared in the empty air; beside him stood the Lord of Thunder and the Mother of Lightning. In an instant, thunder roared mightily, lightning cleaved the vast sky, shaking mountains and rivers with a force so fierce it could be heard clearly! The red-robed figure spoke: “I am the Thunder God; you must repent!” With these words, Wu awoke in a start.

He then prayed and inquired before the Patriarch’s altar, receiving guidance from the Patriarch himself. It was revealed that because he had rashly spoken ill of the “Wu Day Does Not Face the True” and the “Quanzhen Precepts” just two days prior, the Thunder God had come to warn him.

The Iron-Crowned Daoist said: “Among us today, some Daoist friends have no proper lineage or do not follow their master’s teachings. They read a few books and become self-assured, slandering the scriptures and teachings. They judge the Patriarch’s classics, ranking them as high or low. This is great disrespect, and it breaks the faith of others—an exceedingly grave sin. The Patriarchs are all great achievers; the Daoist Canon consists of the Three Caverns’ scriptures, and those included have been recognized by venerable masters through the ages. We need only accept and practice them faithfully, never harboring doubt. The *Scripture of the Northern Dipper* says: ‘Those who are deluded, even if they encounter the scriptures and formulas, but harbor no faith—such people, after death, fall into the Three Paths, drifting through various states, forever losing human form.’ Not only the *Scripture of the Northern Dipper* must not be slandered, but the other scriptures as well.”

Yet within the Daoist Canon, some say the Wu day may be used, others say it may not. This arises from differing lineages of the dharma; one is not right and the other wrong. Each must simply uphold their own master’s transmission. The Heavenly Venerable speaks the scriptures, tailoring teachings to place and person, skillfully adapting the dharma. To save beings of differing capacities, there are various methods. Though the forms differ, their ultimate purpose is the same. We must surely recognize this, understand the Patriarchs’ compassionate efforts to save, and never utter words of slander or harbor disbelief.

The *Scripture of Cause and Effect* states: “Those born as milk swallows or mountain sparrows come from much talking and quarrelling over scriptures and teachings.” It further says: “Criticizing scriptures and dharma, forcibly declaring right and wrong, breaking fasts and precepts, stealing and coveting wealth—all manner of disrespect and disbelief—such souls, upon death, enter the Nine Nether Hells, undergoing the eighteen tortures in full.”

Those who seek the Dao must not be ignorant of this. Otherwise, the Way will not be attained, boundless sins will be created, and after death, one will fall into the Three Paths. Alas! Alas! Take heed! Take heed indeed!
