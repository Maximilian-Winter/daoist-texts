# The Malevolent Spirit Harms People: The Great Manifestation of the Numinous Power of the Spirit Official Lord of Wudang Mountain

Liu Jianjun, a native of Ezhou in Hubei, found his household plagued by a malevolent spirit. They sought help from many monks and Daoist priests, yet none could dispel the affliction. One day, this very spirit, drunk and boastful, declared, “I fear no one except Li Yongnian of Wudang Mountain.” Upon hearing this, Liu Jianjun’s family immediately sought out this Daoist master. Yet Li, the Daoist, did not know how to draw talismans. After earnest pleading, the Daoist finally said, “I will smear cinnabar upon the Spirit Official Lord’s divine whip, then make an imprint on paper. Take it home and try it.” The man took the yellow paper home; just as he arrived, a dreadful scream pierced the air and then fell silent. Later, within the house, they found the corpse of a fox.

The Iron-Crowned Daoist said: The True Martial Patriarch of Wudang Mountain is none other than the Dark Heavenly Highest Emperor of the North, the Numinous Sovereign of the Mysterious Heaven. Commissioned by the Primordial Beginning, he sweeps away demon spirits. The Spirit Official Lord’s awe-inspiring potency is illustrious; he is appointed by the Jade Emperor to subdue demons and monsters. He protects the mountain gates, ensuring purity and banishing all evil spirits and heterodox paths, who are all thoroughly subdued. Therefore, whenever temples or monasteries are built, the Spirit Official Hall is often established at the mountain gate to ward off evil spirits. Those who study the dao should all reverently bow and respectfully offer according to the proper rites, surely receiving protection and grace. External evils will not interfere, and the immortal dao may be anticipated. If one encounters troubles from evil spirits, one should also take refuge in the Spirit Official Lord of the King; all will receive his safeguarding and deliverance.
