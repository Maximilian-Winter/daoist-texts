# The Marvelous Efficacy of Holding the Sacred Name of the Ancestral Lord of Thunder, as Experienced by Madam Tang Huiqin of Shanghai

Tang Huiqin, a native of Jiading in Shanghai, was engaged in the business of exporting furniture and had accumulated a modest fortune. In a certain year, she visited a monk’s temple in Hunan to burn incense. Upon returning, she found her body afflicted with discomfort—sometimes pain, sometimes itching—here in the shoulders and neck, there in the lumbar vertebrae, or in the hands and feet, with no fixed place of suffering. Thus, she sought out masters far and wide—lamas, Daoists, monks alike. Some said it was poor feng shui; others claimed it was the mischief of demons. Time and again, she spent tens of thousands of yuan, yet no clear remedy was found.

Later, a Daoist from Wenzhou named Zhao Fahan came to Shanghai to perform geomantic divination for others. By chance, Tang Huiqin was present and requested from Master Zhao a way to resolve her affliction. Seeing the misfortunes she had suffered and the money she had lost, Zhao Daozhang could not bear to see her waste more. He thus taught her to hold and recite the sacred name: “Heavenly Venerable of the Nine Heavens, Responding Origin, Thunderous Universal Transformation.” Tang Huiqin then asked, “Is there a swifter method?” Zhao Daozhang replied, “You may donate funds to print scriptures and perform merit; the response will come more quickly.”

Tang Huiqin immediately donated to have scriptures printed. Returning home, she began to recite the sacred name of the Heavenly Venerable. Gradually, she felt warmth spreading through her body. After persisting for several days, she dreamed of several golden-armored divine generals descending from the northwest. They searched her home and found several clumps of dark, murky things, which they bound with iron chains and carried away. From that moment, her strange illness was completely cured.

The Iron-Crowned Daoist says: The *Jade Pivot Scripture* states, “If one dwells in a place where birds and rodents bring forth demons, where snakes and insects wed calamity, where bricks and tiles are thrown, where chickens are startled and dogs disturbed, where invitations to sacrifice are sought, leading even to shadowy threats and dreams of coercion, or to bandits and thieves—yet these fiends dare to occupy the dwelling as their nest, causing living people to be bewildered. When the courtyard and gates are unclean, howls resound at night upon the rafters, and gazes pierce the rooms by day; cattle, horses, dogs, and pigs likewise fall to pestilence. Calamity strikes kin, disaster reaches offspring; profane shrines and demon societies flourish, factions of traitorous gods conspire; mourners gather frequently, and funeral carts multiply. But if one recites this scripture, even the most subtle spirits will vanish, and all beings will find peace.” Truly, the vow of the Heavenly Venerable is profound, and the power and virtue of the Heavenly Venerable are vast indeed!

Today, many who make a living by feng shui and divination bear the mannerisms of charlatans. Yet Master Zhao alone guides people toward goodness and urges them to return to the great dao—this is indeed rare! Those skilled in the arts of Lu Ban and feng shui often suffer solitude, poverty, or disability as retribution. Yet Master Zhao’s family is harmonious, and his descendants live in peace—surely this is the protection granted by the Patriarch from the netherworld!
