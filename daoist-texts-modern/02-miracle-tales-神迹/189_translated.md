# Records of Dragon and Tiger Mountain: Wearing the Talisman to Extend Life by Thirty Years

The *Records of Dragon and Tiger Mountain* tell of wearing the talisman to extend life by thirty years, of donning humble robes to cultivate the dao, and of reverently serving the Celestial Master. Though this tale is small, it strikes straight to the heart, revealing the distinctive features of the cultivation and the efficacy of the methods practiced by disciples of the orthodox dao.

From the time the Fourth Generation Celestial Master Zhang Sheng returned to Dragon and Tiger Mountain to live in seclusion and cultivate, all the way to the Fourteenth Generation Celestial Master Zhang Cizheng, there were eleven successive Zhang Celestial Masters who each chose to withdraw from the world and endure rigorous practice. The Fourth Generation Celestial Master Zhang Sheng once lamented: “My ancestors passed down the dao methods by selecting the eldest son as heir. The eldest son must marry and have children, to transmit the dao lineage through family. The other brothers willingly remained unmarried, devoting themselves to the dao.”

Every year, at the Three Primal Festivals—when the Heavenly Official bestows blessings, the Earthly Official pardons sins, and the Water Official resolves calamities—the Zhang Celestial Masters of each generation would open the altar to confer talismans. Thus, through five centuries of expounding the dao and spreading its teachings, the orthodox dao’s influence in society grew until it became known throughout the realm. By the Tang dynasty, even some wealthy and noble folk who held little faith in the Great Way, simply following the trend, would, if convenient, receive the orthodox dao’s talisman with a casual, indifferent attitude.

During the Tang dynasty, in Jiangxi, there was a great merchant who fit this description. He was very wealthy, lived near Dragon and Tiger Mountain, and was inclined to give alms when fate allowed. It was in this very circumstance that this merchant named Liu Qian, quite carelessly, received the talisman and wore the charm.

In the very year he was granted the talisman, Liu Qian traveled to Nanjing to handle a major business deal. Weary from the journey, upon arriving in Nanjing, he went straight to an inn to rest. The next day, when the sun had climbed high, the usually early-rising and strictly disciplined Liu the great merchant remained shut inside his room. His attendants summoned the innkeeper to open the door. Upon opening, they found Liu Qian’s breath had ceased and his body was rigid.

As all mourned the passing of Liu Qian and prepared for his funeral, something extraordinary happened two days later: Liu Qian’s body began to warm, and breath returned. When he fully recovered, Liu Qian recounted a mind-expanding tale. He said: “That night, exhausted from travel, I fell asleep upon lodging. In my dream, I was seized by the underworld’s earth officials and dragged to hell. In the depths of despair, helpless and crying out with no one to hear, a golden light descended from the heavens. A celestial official clad in yellow robes appeared, riding the air, holding a court edict. He read aloud before the two earth officials: ‘Liu Qian wears the orthodox talisman; his name is registered in the upper heavens, not under the earth’s jurisdiction. His allotted time is fulfilled; his life may be extended by thirty years.’”

Through this experience of death and rebirth—especially the searing, unforgettable feeling of fear and helplessness in hell, crying out with no one to answer—this great merchant Liu Qian truly realized that wealth, fame, and power are but external things. At the moment of utmost helplessness and need, only the orthodox talisman, gained without intent of profit but through genuine goodness, saved him.

This great benefactor, whose roots of goodness were deep, resolutely left his home and hastened to Dragon and Tiger Mountain to follow the Celestial Master. There he began pure cultivation and ultimately attained a good fruition.

The Celestial Master Liu Qian followed was the Nineteenth Generation Celestial Master Zhang Xiu. This Zhang Celestial Master was a man of simplicity, often dressed in plain cloth, tilling the fields in solitude. He seldom mingled with villagers but every year regularly taught people through talismanic methods and healed illnesses. At the age of eighty-three, he built his own tomb, saying he would depart the following year. When the time came, he bathed, changed clothes, sat upright, and transformed—passing from this world at the age of eighty-five.
