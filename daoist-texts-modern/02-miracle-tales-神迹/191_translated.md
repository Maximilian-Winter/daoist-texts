# The Beggar’s Burning Incense: A Heart Awakened to Repentance and Reform

During the reign of the Kangxi Emperor, in the province of Jiangxi, there lived a vagrant named Zhou Zhiren. He was over forty years old and spent his days wandering, relying solely on begging for his livelihood. Yet in his youth, Zhou had been gifted with keen intelligence. His parents once sent him to the finest academy in the county seat. Alas, he was too fond of play, squandering his energy on petty cleverness, and in the end, he never even earned the rank of a junior scholar. His father had hoped he would pursue the dao of learning and enter officialdom, but seeing that path closed, he reluctantly set Zhou to business instead.

The Zhou family ran a modest cloth shop—not a grand enterprise, but enough to support their household comfortably. As his elderly father’s health waned, Zhou Zhiren naturally took the helm as shopkeeper. Yet his idleness and frivolity remained unchanged. Within two years, the ancestral foundation crumbled beneath his hands; his parents, heartbroken, passed away soon after. Watching his peers rise—some becoming officials, others prospering in trade—Zhou found himself clad in rags, hungry and shivering. Day after day, he sighed deeply, lamenting his wasted years.

One day, as Zhou Zhiren wandered the streets, he noticed a lively crowd gathered before the gate of the Wenchang Palace. Curious, he edged closer and learned that the local moneylender had just invited the Daoist priests of Wenchang Palace to perform a blessing ritual, and now they were distributing food to the assembled folk. For Zhou, this was an opportunity not to be missed; he obediently joined the back of the queue.

While waiting, he overheard those nearby recounting the moneylender’s tale.

It was said that from childhood, the moneylender had been frail and sickly. Many doctors had declared him beyond hope. His family, desperate, brought him to worship at Wenchang Palace. Miraculously, after that visit, his health restored as if by divine grace. From then on, the whole family became devout followers of the Wenchang Emperor, funding the restoration of the palace and coming every month on the first and fifteenth days to pray and distribute food. This had continued for over twenty years. Recently, a chubby new son had been born to the family, making today’s gathering especially joyous.

Hearing this, Zhou Zhiren’s mind churned: Could the Wenchang Emperor truly be so numinous? Without hesitation, he abandoned his meal and strode straight into the main hall. With a thud, he knelt before the Wenchang Emperor’s image and began pouring out his bitter grievances, praying earnestly for the emperor’s spiritual protection. He did not ask for wealth or honor—only for enough to eat and wear.

Having finished his prayers and about to rise, a voice called from behind: “I cannot read. Could you help me understand what is written on this wall?” Zhou, though never diligent in study, recognized many characters. Approaching, he saw the inscription was the *Yinzhi Text of the Wenchang Emperor* written on the wall. He proceeded to read it aloud for the old man from beginning to end.

When he reached the admonition of the Wenchang Emperor to the world:

> “To expand the field of blessings, one must rely on the heart’s ground.  
> Act with timely expediency, perform manifold secret merits.  
> Benefit things and people, cultivate goodness and fortune.  
> Uprightness acts as Heaven’s agent of transformation,  
> Compassion rescues the people for the realm…”

Suddenly, Zhou Zhiren awoke to the truth. He had sought blessings and prosperity while idling away his days, doing nothing. Now, coming to the Wenchang Emperor, hoping for manna from Heaven, he felt a deep shame for his former ways.

From that moment, Zhou Zhiren cast off his laziness. Though lacking skill, he first relied on honest labor, rising early each day to take odd jobs at the market. Whenever he found a spare moment, he would return to Wenchang Palace to explain the *Yinzhi Text* to visitors, sharing the wondrous stories of spiritual efficacy he had heard. Gradually, he gained a modest reputation in the county. The moneylender, hearing of his transformation, generously offered funds to help restore Zhou’s ancestral business. At last, his life found a steady course.

Five years later, Zhou Zhiren had become one of the richest men in the county. And within the halls of Wenchang Palace, his story continued to be told, inspiring all who heard it.
