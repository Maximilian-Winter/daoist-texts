# The Story of the Guardian Immortal of Jinguai Mountain in Huzhou

Jinguai Mountain in Huzhou stands as a vital stronghold of the Quanzhen Longmen lineage in the southern lands of the Yangtze. Legend tells that the guardian immortal of this mountain is a female immortal named Hu Ganggang.

Hu hailed from Qingpu in Songjiang Prefecture (modern Qingpu County of Shanghai), originally named Manyue. She was the adopted daughter of the Yang family, the household of Yang He. In her youth, she encountered a transcendent being who imparted to her the alchemical formulas. By the age of nine, her practice had already become deeply numinous. At twelve, her yang spirit departed her body; she entered a state of meditative stillness, seated in perfect repose. Her family, mistaking her for dead, buried the lifeless form. Yet her yang spirit returned and, finding no original body, often manifested at night. Later, she appeared by day as well, causing great unrest in the Yang household. One day, a Daoist of the Longmen school named Qingyun passed by, though the Yang family did not reveal the recent spiritual manifestations.

In the dead of night, Qingyun heard a voice calling out: “Return my dwelling!” The voice drew nearer and nearer. The Daoist, feeling strange, focused his spirit to observe. Manyue’s soul form appeared before him. He beckoned her forward, and she approached calmly, unlike the usual restless ghosts. Qingyun’s discerning gaze showed no fear; he concluded she was no demon. Upon inquiry, he learned the truth: her physical shell was destroyed. Feeling pity, yet believing she could not be immediately delivered beyond, he first commanded her to withdraw. Manyue’s eyes brimmed with tears, her sorrow profound. Then the Daoist summoned her again and read aloud the *Precepts for Female Green Ghosts*—the Daoist code of conduct for spirits and ghosts. Manyue knelt and accepted the precepts.

After taking the precepts, Manyue spoke to the Daoist: “If you can restore to me my body so that my primordial spirit may dwell within, once I attain the dao, I shall repay you manifold.” The Daoist kindled a basin of red embers to her left, and a bowl of clear water to her right. He said, “Your body lies within the water; try to find it there.”

Manyue entered the water vessel and remained a long while before emerging: “It is not there.” The Daoist said, “If not in the water, then it must be in the fire; try to find it there.” Manyue entered the fire and stayed long, tears flowing, sorrow overwhelming, and came out weeping: “It is not in the fire either. It seems I am fated not to attain the dao.” The Daoist shouted: “Foolish girl! The subtlety of the immortals is that entering water does not wet, entering fire does not burn. You now pass freely through both, without the slightest hindrance. Have you not already reached the goal of your heart? Why cling to that broken shell? From this day forth, only hold firm your faith, gather your spirit, manifest and conceal yourself according to the true dao, defend and uphold the orthodox teaching. When you have fulfilled three thousand deeds of merit and perfected eight hundred kinds of good conduct, your immortal rank shall be conferred—this is but a matter of time.”

Manyue, hearing this, was greatly enlightened. She bowed nine times, calling out “Master.” The Daoist then bestowed upon her a few verses: “Whenever someone chants these verses, you must come at the summons; if you break this vow and do not come, you shall not attain the dao.” Manyue wept and took her leave, promising, “I shall surely follow your teaching.” Then clouds arose beneath her feet, and she drifted upward, vanishing from sight.

From that day on, the Yang household lived in peace and security. Daoist Qingyun recorded the verses of summoning Manyue in the lineage registers. For generations, whenever a Daoist of the succession recited the verses, Manyue would come to heed the command. It is said she was granted the immortal title “Jade Maiden of the Great Void,” forever serving as the guardian immortal of Jinguai Mountain.
