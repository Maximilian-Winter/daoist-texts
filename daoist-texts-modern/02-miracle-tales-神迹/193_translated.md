# The Legend of the White Cloud Cavern on the Rear Mountain of Qingcheng

It is said that since ancient times, the White Cloud Cavern on the rear mountain of Qingcheng has been a grotto abode where immortals cultivate and refine themselves. The Patriarch White Cloud himself dwells within this cavern, which is thus named the White Cloud Cavern. Inside the cavern lie the Heavenly Scripture and the treasured sword. It is told that whoever obtains the treasured sword will command the winds and summon the rains; whoever gains the Heavenly Scripture will turn stone into gold.

One day, a gentleman surnamed Zhou, known as Lord Duan, heard people speak of the Heavenly Scripture and treasured sword within the cavern. Overjoyed beyond measure, he thought to himself: “If I can fetch these, will I not become an immortal?” So he purchased a three-and-a-half jin weight of ox tallow candles, and at dawn the next day, he climbed the sheer cliffs and swung on vines until he arrived at the mouth of the White Cloud Cavern. Upon seeing it, he exclaimed, “What a vast cavern!” Beside the entrance was carved a poem. Lord Duan recognized a few characters and began to hum it with affected solemnity:

> Hastily I gather my tattered cassock,  
> Adjust my gear as the sun declines.  
> Sleeves brush white clouds, departing the grotto,  
> Shouldering the bright moon, I cross the horizon.  
> Pity the fledgling bird on the branch,  
> Reluctant to leave the old flowers by the fence.  
> I bid my dogs and cats to follow me—  
> No need to wander among mundane folk.

Having finished humming, Lord Duan thought: “Perhaps the immortals at this cavern’s mouth have all departed.” He quickly lit the ox tallow candles and, emboldened, stepped inside. He walked and walked, hearing only the rushing sound of water. Approaching, he discovered a small river barring the path. Fortunately, a single-log bridge spanned it. Shining his light, he saw the bridge was nearly rotten through. Carefully, he stepped onto the narrow log, heart pounding, sweat chilling his brow. Crossing the bridge, he continued on, searching for the Heavenly Scripture and treasured sword.

As he walked, suddenly he saw a glow ahead and ran eagerly toward it. Drawing near, he found it was an exit from the cavern. He stretched out his head to peer out and cried, “My heavens!”—his soul nearly fled in fright. Below was a precipice thousands of zhang deep, with a great river roaring beneath the cliffs. Across the way rose sheer rock faces, and along the riverbank stood human dwellings, from which came the crowing of roosters and barking of dogs. Lord Duan thought: “There is no way out here.” Hastily, he turned to retrace his steps. Looking at his ox tallow candles, more than half had burned away. Realizing his quest for the Heavenly Scripture and treasured sword was in vain, he resolved to return whence he came.

Walking back, he suddenly saw beside the path a stone table. Hastily lighting his candle, he beheld the Heavenly Scripture and treasured sword resting upon it. Lord Duan was overjoyed and reached out to seize them. Suddenly, a great roar came from behind the table: “Stop! Behold the sword!” Terrified, Lord Duan withdrew his hand. Looking closely, he saw a statue of Patriarch White Cloud carved into the rock wall, raising the treasured sword and striking toward him. Screaming, Lord Duan fled headlong, the candle extinguished. Groping in the dark, he struggled until he reached the edge of the single-log bridge. Frantically, he relit his candle, crossed the bridge, and after a long while emerged from the cavern’s mouth. The three-and-a-half jin of ox tallow candles had just burned out. Looking up, the sun was already about to set.

Lord Duan stumbled down from the cavern’s mouth and encountered some woodcutters. He recounted his ordeal within the cavern. Exhausted beyond measure, he coughed up several mouthfuls of fresh blood and collapsed, dead. The local mountain folk buried him before the cavern, and to this day his grave mound remains. As for the Heavenly Scripture and treasured sword? It is said that no one dares to claim them, and they still lie within the depths of the cavern.
