# Zhang Zhengyuan’s Cultivation and the Efficacy of the Great Brahmanic Secret Utterances

Zhang Zhengyuan, a native of Jingzhao, sought out Yin Sixuan and, under his tutelage, received the *Great Brahmanic Secret Utterances*. Morning and evening he recited them diligently, abstaining entirely from flesh and strong flavors.

When rebels in Weinan raised arms to invade the imperial court, Zhang Zhengyuan was seized and driven along by the marauders. At that time, the bandits slaughtered with wanton cruelty; corpses lay strewn across the roads, leaving no place to flee—his heart gripped by overwhelming sorrow and terror.

Yet, as he was being herded onward, suddenly countless warhorses appeared, matching the number of the marauders. They barred the path of the robbers’ pillaging. Zhang Zhengyuan was conveyed to rest beneath a great locust tree, where he was told, “Sit here, and fear nothing.”

He sat for a long while. No further fighting broke out. But as dusk deepened, fearing he might not reach safety before nightfall, he quietly rose and pressed onward—and found himself already beneath the locust tree at his own home. His family was all there, not one missing.

They dwelled there for several days in peace and safety. Then, journeying together, they crossed the mountains and settled in Jin Prefecture.

Later, Zhang Zhengyuan traveled to Chengdu. Amid the court’s affairs, he recounted this numinous event to Master Mingdao. With earnest reverence, he continued to cultivate and uphold the true scripture, leading his entire household to chant its verses.

*Note:* The so-called *Great Brahmanic Secret Utterances* here are not the Sanskrit of India. Rather, they are the Brahmanic qi of the Great Luo Heaven, the secret rhythms of the Nine Heavens.
