# The Daoist Luan Ba Slays the Demon Spirit of the Divination Temple

In the region of Sichuan, there lived a Daoist named Luan Ba. From his youth, he began to cultivate the dao, and in time his renown spread far and wide. He was summoned forth from the mountains to serve as a gongcao—an official in charge of ritual affairs. After several years, he was promoted to the position of Prefect of Yuzhang (modern Jiangxi), where the sacred Mount Lu stood within his jurisdiction.

There stood a temple there, famed for its numinous efficacy. It was said that the temple deity could speak with outsiders from behind the curtains; more wondrous still, when wine was poured, the cup would dance and fly through the air. When one drank, the cup would pause suspended in midair; once emptied, it would return to be refilled as if by invisible hands.

Travelers from afar often came to the temple to offer sacrifices and make vows. When the deity was pleased, all river and lake voyages would proceed smoothly, free from peril. Upon taking office, Luan Ba followed custom and visited the temple to pay respects. Yet, to his surprise, the temple deity vanished without a trace at his arrival. Luan Ba’s heart immediately sensed that something was amiss.

After thorough investigation, he declared, “This temple is inhabited by a demon spirit. It has been masquerading as the Heavenly Official, wielding false power and granting hollow blessings. For many years it has plagued the people and must be severely punished.” Thus, he entrusted official duties to his deputy and set out himself to hunt down the demon.

Had he delayed, the demon might have roamed unchecked across the realm, prompting people to build temples and offer sacrifices with livestock, while spreading disease and coercing the populace into costly prayers.

Luan Ba pursued the fiend far and wide, until he reached a certain place where he summoned the local mountain god, earth god, and river deity to question them about the demon’s trail. Cornered, the demon fled Yuzhang Prefecture and journeyed to Qi Prefecture (in the eastern part of today’s Shandong), thousands of li from Mount Lu. There, it transformed itself into a handsome scholar, discoursing endlessly on the *Yi*, *Shi*, *Shu*, *Li*, and *Chunqiu* classics.

The Prefect of Qi, upon meeting this scholar, was greatly pleased and gave his daughter in marriage to him.

Luan Ba searched long and hard before learning that the demon had escaped to Qi Prefecture and become the esteemed son-in-law of the Prefect. He reported to the imperial court, resigned from his post as Prefect of Yuzhang, and set out with haste to Qi Prefecture.

Upon arrival, Luan Ba went to pay respects to the Prefect. The scholar dared not show himself and fled into the rear courtyard. Luan Ba said to the Prefect, “Your daughter’s husband is no mere mortal, but an ancient demon spirit. He once impersonated the temple deity at Mount Lu and fled here when I pressed him hard. Today I have come expressly to capture him.”

The Prefect was filled with doubt and sent word for his son-in-law to appear. Luan Ba said, “Bringing him out will be easy enough.” Borrowing brush, ink, and desk from the Prefect, he drew a talisman. When finished, Luan Ba let out a long, piercing cry.

Suddenly, as if an invisible being took the talisman, it flew swiftly to the back hall. The scholar said to his wife, “This time it’s certain death.” Tears streaming, he took the talisman and carried it out.

In the great hall, upon seeing Luan Ba, he cowered and dared not approach. Luan Ba shouted, “Old demon, reveal your true form at once!” The scholar responded by transforming into his original shape—a great wildcat. Desperately, it kowtowed and begged for mercy.

Luan Ba commanded, “Behead him!” A sword flew down from the air, and the wildcat’s head rolled away. The Prefect’s daughter had borne the scholar a son, who too transformed into a wildcat and was slain alongside his father.

News of Luan Ba’s demon hunt spread far and wide, striking terror into all spirits and specters. Yuzhang, once plagued by demons—especially a fierce one-legged fiend—was now peaceful. Upon returning from Qi Prefecture, Luan Ba remained in Yuzhang, and all ghosts and goblins within the region fell silent, no longer daring to stir mischief.
