# The Great Filial Yang Xiao, the Immortal of Filial Piety in Hemp Garments

A healer who aids the world, whose filial piety moves Heaven. One immortal of the Medicine Bridge, one immortal in hemp garments—alone for eight hundred years he treads the path behind the ancients. The incense fires and offerings come by fate to this place; the filial son endures through the ages, the famed healer lives forever. For thirty springs he strove to pass on wondrous secrets, his grace and kindness spreading boundlessly to these people. This is the tale of the great immortal among the folk of Hunan.

The Immortal in Hemp Garments is also called the Filial Immortal Yang Xiao, for in life he was a paragon of filial devotion. According to the Gazetteer of Liuyang County, his name was Yang Yaoting, a native of Liuyang in the Tang dynasty’s Tianbao era. He made his living as a physician, traveling far and wide to cure countless ailments, excelling especially in pediatrics. Once, on a journey to treat the sick, he did not return; meanwhile, his mother fell gravely ill and passed away, leaving him shattered with grief. Overcome with remorse, Yang Yaoting donned hemp cloth in mourning for three years, then submerged himself in a pond beside the martial training ground outside the eastern city.

Months later, a lotus bloomed from the pond’s waters—astonishingly, it sprouted from the very mouth of Yang Xiao. The villagers discovered that the immortal’s face remained flushed and vibrant, just as in life. They believed his filial heart had moved Heaven and Earth, that he had ascended to immortality. Thus, they reverently honored him as the Immortal in Hemp Garments, also known as the Great Immortal Yang or the Filial Immortal Yang.

The people deeply revered his healing arts and steadfast practice of filial piety. Because he had practiced medicine in life, when someone fell ill, they would don white garments and come to pray for a medicine talisman. If the talisman’s prescription cured the disease, they would then proceed from their home, bowing every five steps until reaching the temple to give thanks. Hence, his following grew vast. It was said he held a special fondness for children; whenever a child was sick, seeking his medicine talisman was especially efficacious. Over time, the scope of folk belief in him expanded ever wider.

In the eleventh year of the Tongzhi reign, during a great drought in Pingjiang, the governor prayed for rain and dreamt that Yang Xiao came to aid him. Rain soon fell in torrents. The governor then petitioned the imperial court and obtained an edict granting him the title “Local Worthy,” permitting the holding of biannual rites in spring and autumn. His name shines beyond antiquity and modernity alike; his filial virtue remains between Heaven and Earth, his filial piety stirring the very heavens. His fame and power resound far across the lands of Hunan and Jiangxi.
