# The City God’s Clever Judgment: The Top Scholar’s Mistaken Temple Fire

It is told that in the earliest days, through the great patronage of the Ming Dynasty’s Progenitor, Zhu Yuanzhang, the Daoist faith in the City God spread far and wide across the land. Time and again, his numinous power proved manifest, and so the common folk came to revere him ever more deeply.

One day, in a City God temple somewhere in the Jiangsu-Zhejiang region, a man named Li the Carpenter entered the great hall, accompanied by a woman and a child.

The matter was this: Li’s hen, a laying mother hen, had gone missing. The child claimed to have seen the woman secretly eating the hen, yet the woman vehemently denied it. At their wit’s end, Li brought both before the venerable City God to seek the truth. Upon entering the hall, Li explained the situation to the presiding Daoist priest. The three knelt together before the City God’s seat. The child and the woman solemnly vowed that if either spoke falsely, may the City God render them unable to rise.

After burning incense and bowing their heads, each silently reported the matter to the venerable Lord within their hearts. The woman then rose, but the child’s legs went numb, unable to move. Thus, Li concluded that the child had indeed lied, and he forgave the woman.

Time turned like the shifting stars—twenty years passed in the blink of an eye. On this day, the newly minted top scholar returned to his hometown. Unexpectedly, the very first thing he did was to enter the City God temple.

What no one could have imagined was that instead of offering incense and worship, the top scholar pushed down the City God’s golden image, kicked over the incense burner, and set fire to the temple…

For a moment, the villagers stood dumbfounded, eyes wide.

Then, standing on high, the top scholar explained: “When I was but a child, I clearly saw a woman steal and eat the neighbor Li the Carpenter’s hen. Yet in the temple, the City God judged me a liar. Tell me, should such a deity still be worshipped?”

The villagers were struck speechless, their hearts shaken.

Suddenly, thunder rumbled in the heavens. The fallen City God statue faintly spoke with a human voice, revealing the truth.

It was that the woman had been with child at the time. Overcome by craving, she had cooked Li’s hen. When she knelt before the City God, her heart was clear and contrite; she confessed her guilt silently and vowed to find a way to make amends to Li.

The City God’s divine eyes, sharp as lightning, had already discerned the matter. But considering the woman’s pregnancy and fearing harm to the unborn child, and seeing her sincere repentance, he judged the child—the very top scholar today—to have spoken falsely.

Yet the City God, aware of his misjudgment, secretly aided the child. He appeared in various forms to guide him in diligent study of poetry and books, until at last he rose to the pinnacle of success.

Hearing this, the top scholar fell silent, shame filling his heart. At once, he ordered the golden image to be rebuilt and the City God temple restored.

From then on, the top scholar became the local magistrate—stern and impartial, just and incorruptible, beloved by the people, who gave him the nickname “Blue Sky.”

Seeing is not always believing; hearing is not always true. The peach and plum trees do not speak, yet beneath them a path forms naturally.

This is precisely the way of Heaven made manifest: to uphold the upright; the numinous revealed in splendor, sheltering the sincere.
