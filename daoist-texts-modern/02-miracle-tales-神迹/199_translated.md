# Li Zhenguo of Wenzhou’s Verified Daoist Ritual for His Mother’s Longevity

Li Zhenguo of Wenzhou was a man of loyalty, kindness, and filial devotion. Fond of the mysterious arts, he often visited the Xuan Zhen Temple in Wenzhou to burn incense, maintaining close fellowship with the Daoist priest Chen Zonglong of that temple. In the early spring of the year two thousand and ten, his mother suddenly fell ill. Upon seeking examination at the hospital, it was discovered she suffered from acute bleeding in the digestive tract. She was admitted for observation, and the entire family attended her with decoctions and medicines, unwilling to stray far from her side.

We all know that acute bleeding of the digestive path is a perilous condition, one that easily claims life. Li Zhenguo’s heart burned with anxiety. On one hand, he sought out acquaintances and connections, hoping the hospital might marshal all its strength in treatment, so as not to lose precious time. On the other hand, he called upon Chen Daozhang of Xuan Zhen, yearning to rely on the power of ghosts and spirits to preserve his mother’s life. The Daoist community of Xuan Zhen Temple thus established within the temple a Longevity and Life-Protection Daoist altar. The assembly, devout and reverent, kowtowed and worshiped, beseeching the Star Lords to bestow their great radiant might, praying for the venerable Madam Li’s extension of years.

Meanwhile, at the hospital, Madam Li suffered unbearable pain. With trembling voice, she told Li Zhenguo, “I am so very uncomfortable~” Her heartbeat and breath, the vital signs of life, had already grown faint and fragile. The next day, she said, “Last night I dreamed that someone came, holding chains to bind me and lead me away. We traveled a long path, all around was black and obscure, the road unseen. Occasionally I heard cries, chilling and dreadful. The road was uneven, full of pits and puddles. Suddenly, a bright light descended from above. A white-bearded old man spoke to the one who was escorting me: ‘The Northern Dipper Star Lord commands that this woman’s yang life is not yet spent; she must be returned to the world of the living.’ Then I awoke.” Madam Li remains in Wenzhou to this day, and her family continues to give thanks for the grace of the Northern Dipper.

In gratitude for the Star Lord’s favor in prolonging her life, Madam Li commissioned the carving of the Great Emperor of the Purple Tenuity’s divine image for Xuan Zhen Temple. Every month, on the appointed day of the Dipper, she comes to the temple to honor the stars with ritual offerings.
