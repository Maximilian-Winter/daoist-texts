# The Curious Encounter of the Country Innkeeper

Master Xu, a native of Xiushui in Jiangxi, once served as a cook far from home. In time, he resolved to return and open an inn. After surveying many places, he settled on a two-story house beside the highway just outside the county seat, establishing a rustic country inn. First, the location promised a steady flow of travelers, not far from the county’s heart. Second, the rent was affordable.

Not far from the storefront stood a grand camphor tree, its age spanning several centuries. Beneath its boughs rose a small shrine, its plaque inscribed with the words “Society of Peace.” Ancient records tell that the spirits of the community often dwell upon such trees. To find a shrine beneath the tree carried a certain venerable charm. Some had warned Master Xu that this place once served as an execution ground, where many souls met their end. The house received but brief sunlight each day, its air heavy with yin energy; they advised him not to be tempted by cheap rent. Master Xu laughed, saying, “What harm is there? Those with spirit need not fear those without!”

He invited a diviner to select an auspicious day for opening. Thanks to careful control over the dishes and the favorable site, business prospered. Yet the cooks reported strange happenings: dishes would sometimes vanish inexplicably after being prepared, as if pilfered by unseen guests. At night, voices could be heard in the main hall; when lights were switched on, no one was there. The mystery deepened.

One evening, past eight o’clock, a company arrived—men and women numbering more than ten. They ordered a grand feast. Under the moon’s high watch, with wine and food fully enjoyed, the hour had grown late past ten. The leader, a man with a large belly wearing dark glasses and a bulging money pouch, came to settle the bill. “How much do we owe?” he asked. The hostess counted and said, “Sir, your total is one thousand three hundred and fifty yuan.” The man bargained a little, then produced a thick stack of bills, handing them over with laughter and good cheer before vanishing into the night’s embrace.

The hostess returned to her husband, gleeful, reporting the night’s fortune. But the next morning, when she opened her wallet, all the money had turned to joss paper. Only then did they realize that last night’s diners were not beings of the living world. Terrified, they hastily closed the inn. To this day, the house stands abandoned, swallowed by silence.

The Iron-Crowned Daoist said: “This tale was told to me by my master when I journeyed to Xiushui. It strikes me as most uncanny. I had heard of ghosts taking taxis and paying with spirit money—nowadays, such paper money closely resembles real currency, so perhaps the driver was careless at night. Yet here, the very next day, the money turned to joss paper. Such a transformation defies explanation except by the workings of ghosts and spirits. The netherworld and its mysteries are not for casual glimpses; one must never lose the heart of reverence.”
