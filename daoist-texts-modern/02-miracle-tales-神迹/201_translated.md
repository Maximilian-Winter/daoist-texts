# The Story of an Employee’s Suicide

Master Dong, a native of Tianjin, had established a company in Beijing—one that belonged to the realm of high technology. Seeking smooth success in his enterprise and a steady flow of wealth, Master Dong often went to burn incense and pay homage to the gods. He and I shared a close bond.

One evening, Master Dong sent me a message on WeChat, asking, “Daoist Master, are you asleep? Is it convenient to take a call?” His tone was urgent, filled with anxiety. I had just finished a round of the game *Agricultural Poison* when I saw his message, so I promptly called him back.

Master Dong said, “Master, someone in our company is attempting suicide.”

I asked, “What happened? Have you been withholding wages from your employees?”

He replied, “It was not intentional. At the end of the year, because the final payment for a project had not yet arrived, we ended up owing employees two months’ wages. Perhaps this person was naturally silent and reserved, and with no money for the New Year, and some harsh words from family, he became despondent. He took sleeping pills, slashed his wrists—thankfully, he was saved. Today I went to visit him and found a Buddha statue in his home, facing directly toward his bed. It seems he burned incense diligently. Before the New Year, I had heard he was cultivating some kind of method. His eyes were dark and sunken. I advised him then, ‘You are still young; do not...’”

At this point, the call suddenly dropped.

A few minutes later, Master Dong called back, saying, “Sorry, my phone just reset itself to factory settings.”

I said, “This matter feels rather uncanny. The method he was cultivating must have been a powerful, sinister art. You’d better leave him be. Each person has their own karmic affinities. This year you clash with the Tai Sui; right at the start of the year, you encounter this trouble. In all things, be cautious and prudent.”
