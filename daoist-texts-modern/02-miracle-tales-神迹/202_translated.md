# The Story of Sun Daoyou from Guangdong Seeking the Dao

Sun Daoyou was a native of Shenzhen. From childhood, he delighted in watching Lam Ching-ying’s jiangshi films, marveling at the arts of the immortals, and dreaming that one day he might master the Maoshan daoist arts to aid the world—expelling demons, healing the sick, capturing ghosts, and seeking wealth. At a bookstall, he purchased a volume titled *Daoist Numinous Talismans* published from the Hong Kong station, and earnestly copied the talismanic diagrams and chanted the incantations.

Later, upon entering the workforce, this same Sun Daoyou roamed far and wide in pursuit of the dao. Hearing that somewhere there was a master who could wield forbidden spells to command the five ghosts to transport wealth, he hastened to make contact and bought a ticket to learn. He also heard of a certain daoist priest, heir to the Fengdu tradition, whose talismanic texts were complete and whose arts were superb. Without hesitation, he spent great sums and journeyed a thousand li to seek the dao. Thus it went for more than ten years—his heart could not be said to lack sincerity.

He boasted to all he met of the profundity of his daoist arts. Indeed, among the daoist circle around him, none could match his skill.

Once, while traveling to Mount Hua, he encountered a wandering daoist priest of plain appearance, carrying a backpack as he climbed. Because Sun Daoyou had by then gained the ability to perceive the ghostly and divine realms, he noticed that this seemingly ordinary priest was flanked by five imperial attendant youths of the Five Emperors, and guarded by six heavenly demon kings. These were great spirits, not the playthings of common minor arts. At that moment, a venomous snake nearby raised its head high, ready to strike. The wandering priest saw this and sharply commanded, “Malignant obstruction, begone!” The snake immediately crouched low, dared not move, and slunk away into the grass in shame.

Sun Daoyou hurried forward and bowed deeply, saying, “Merciful sir.” This startled the wandering daoist. “I wear such tattered clothes, a single garment worth only a few dozen coins. This man’s daoist robe costs over a thousand—why does he bow to me?” The wandering priest quickly returned the bow, saying, “Your kindness humbles me, venerable sir.”

Sun Daoyou said, “I see that you are surrounded by officers of the thunder division and countless celestial troops of the Jade Court. What method do you cultivate to command such a host of ghosts and spirits? What practice enables you to make venomous snakes and fierce beasts bow and obey? I hope your venerable self, in compassion, will enlighten me on your cultivation.”

The wandering daoist was puzzled and replied, “To be frank, I do not know any spells. I am merely a wandering pilgrim passing through this place. Please do not flatter me. What you say, I do not understand. I only persist in daily recitation of a single scroll of the *Scripture of the Northern Dipper*.”

Scriptural texts and precious talismans are all spoken by the golden mouth of the Heavenly Venerables, treasures of Heaven itself. They are hidden within the jeweled pavilions of the celestial courts, guarded by immortal youths and jade maidens. Sometimes they appear as phoenix script or dragon seal, cloud script or cinnabar writing. The primordial sovereigns inscribe and record them. When the great dao is to be practiced, the scriptures are transmitted to save beings. The world does not know the preciousness of these scriptures and instead seeks after petty methods and minor arts, delighting in them. It is like having a family treasure but failing to guard it carefully, instead begging others for scraps. Is this not laughable?

The Patriarch said: “Scripture is the root of the method; the method is the use of the scripture.” Many practitioners in the world are unwilling to steadfastly recite the classics, yet hope to learn a spell today and a charm tomorrow, to perform rituals for others to avert calamities and pray for blessings. Do they not know that this only distances them further from the dao? Where there is great scripture, there is great method. For example, where there is the *Scripture of Salvation*, there is the numinous treasure method of salvation. Where there is the *Scripture of the Northern Dipper*, there are methods to dispel misfortune, report to the Dipper, and prolong life. Where there is the *Jade Pivot Scripture*, there are methods to pray for clear skies and rain, to drive away evil and forbid harm. If methods are not rooted in scripture, they are no different from sorcery. If one knows only the methods but does not recite the scriptures, one is no different from a charlatan. The scripture is for self-cultivation; the method is to save others.
