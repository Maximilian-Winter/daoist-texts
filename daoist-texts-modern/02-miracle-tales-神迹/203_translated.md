# The True Story of Daoist Friend Wu’s Disrespect Toward His Master

Daoist Friend Wu was a man from the Northeast, a land known for its many great transcendents. Wu originally studied shamanic arts, then turned to esoteric Buddhism, and later still changed course to practice the dao/way of the Daoist methods. Though he had many masters, he refused to truly learn from any of them. His daoist practices and conduct mostly came from the vast networks of the internet. He did not understand the official licenses and approvals, let alone the steps of the Yu Pace or the hand seals. Sometimes, he would complain to friends that his master knew nothing and refused to teach him. When performing rituals, lacking proper ceremonial texts, he would simply search online, carrying an iPad to the altar. Often, he would quarrel with others online, calling this one a fraud, that one ignorant, thereby accumulating boundless negative karma. His absurdities were numerous and endless.

Wu had a senior fellow disciple, slightly older and of honest, straightforward character. This elder once admonished Wu, saying: “The dao/way and its methods are precious. In the past, when one sought to learn the dao, one must spend at least three years with the master, day and night, attending to the master’s meals and daily needs, tempering one’s heart and nature. Sometimes, one must bring gold and treasures as a pledge before the master will transmit the teachings. When the transmission occurs, oaths are sworn to Heaven, Earth, and the Three Officials—this is no trivial matter. You are in the Northeast, your master in the South. How many times have you met your master face to face? What have you done for your master? Yet you demand your master teach you this and that. What merit have you earned?”

Upon hearing this, Wu also felt the words made much sense, yet his pride remained unyielding. From then on, his words of complaint lessened somewhat. Later, once when ascending the altar, his ritual crown accidentally fell to the ground, and soon after he suffered a grave illness. On his sickbed, half dreaming and half awake, he vaguely saw an official spirit come to admonish him: “You have not obtained true master transmission, yet you recklessly don the robes and crown. The Thunder Division is enraged. Were it not for the protection of your master’s lineage, you would long ago have been punished.”

The Dao has three treasures: the Dao, the Scripture, and the Master. Yet the Dao itself cannot be spoken; it depends on the true master to transmit it. Sometimes the master is but an ordinary sweeping Daoist, a temple attendant, or a solitary practitioner performing scriptures and repentance rituals in the countryside. They possess no great power or social status. But once one has kowtowed and sworn to the master, one becomes a disciple of the dharma lineage. No matter how humble the master, they represent the unbroken transmission of Daoist law, a lineage stretching back thousands of years, deserving of reverence.
