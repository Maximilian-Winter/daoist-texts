# The Tale of the Hainan Construction Site

Hu the Layman, a mid-level leader in a well-known developer’s project in Hainan, found himself stationed at a rather remote site. This place had once been a shooting range—a grim ground where prisoners met their end by the bullet. The workers lodged there often felt cold winds sweeping through by day, but by night, the air thickened with dread. Nightmares came unbidden, and many suffered from the oppressive weight of ghostly visitation—what is called the soul’s paralysis. Hu was not alone in this; asking his fellow workers, he learned they too were plagued by these nocturnal terrors.

Hu the Layman, a steadfast devotee of the great Dao, carried a heart of reverence while on this ground, never daring to offend the spirits that lingered. One day, in a dazed moment between waking and dreaming, he heard the plaintive cries of a child, echoing from the depths of an ancient well. The voice begged him for deliverance, a plea to help the souls move beyond. Upon waking, the dream remained vivid, as if the scene unfolded right before his eyes.

The next day, Hu led his team on an inspection of the site and passed by that very ancient well. He asked a local worker, “What is this?” The worker replied plainly, “An old well.” Hu pressed on, “Is it only a well? Were children ever cast down here to die?” The worker, a native of the village, nodded gravely. “Yes. Children who died young were thrown into this well. Some who fell ill and could not be cured were also cast down here.” Only then did Hu understand the meaning behind the child’s voice in his dream.

Moved, he sought out a Daoist master and obtained some jade emperor coins and money for the departed. At dusk, he burned these offerings for the souls. The sky had not yet darkened, but as the paper burned, a whirlwind arose, as if the spirits were scrambling to seize the tokens. Hu prayed sincerely, “May all who hold wishes be reborn, returning to the Pure Land. By the power of the great Dao, may all find liberation.”

The Iron-Crowned Daoist said: “Many construction sites lie in remote places. When breaking ground, it is common to unearth coffins or remains of those who came before. Such discoveries demand utmost reverence and caution. Sometimes, we encounter spirits seeking aid—souls long dwelling in the shadowy realms, unable to glimpse the light. They often choose to reach out to the living who show kindness and honor the spirits. If we can offer help, the departed will surely remember with gratitude. Is this not a merit, a deed of virtue?”

Spirits without ancestral rites are called “li,” malevolent shades. In the Ming dynasty, every city had a City God temple. Each year during the Zhongyuan Festival, imperial officials would perform rites for these unoffered souls, demonstrating the vast grace of the emperor, benefiting both the realms of the living and the dead. Among the people of the world, while alive, the state maintained hospices to care for orphaned children and solitary elders. After death, the Zhongyuan rites honored those lonely souls without kin. Mencius said, “To nurture life and send off death without regret is the beginning of the kingly way.” Individual lives, within the state’s system of ritual care, receive ultimate concern at their end. The dead are not without life; they too deserve respect. Confucius taught, “To serve the dead as one serves the living, to regard the departed as if they still remain.” This not only shows reverence for the departed but also nurtures the people’s hearts with benevolence and filial piety.
