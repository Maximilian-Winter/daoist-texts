# A Layman of Henan Seeks the Water Ritual of the Three Officials

Li Shuming, a native of Henan, was trained in the healing arts. He opened a clinic in a certain locale of Henan and gained some local renown as a physician. In his early years, he was devoutly Buddhist; yet the cycles of fate turned against him, and his fortunes waned. Later, at the White Horse Temple in Luoyang, a master of great insight guided him to recite the Scripture of the Three Officials. Gradually, his luck began to improve. From that time forth, he reverently enshrined the Three Officials in his home. On the first and fifteenth days of each month, as well as on the triple prime festivals, he would fast, prepare offerings, burn incense, and chant the Scripture of the Three Officials, bowing deeply before the Great Emperors of the Three Officials. Moved by his sincere heart, the numinous powers responded with remarkable clarity.

This year, Li Shuming’s aged mother was stricken with a cough. For more than twenty days, she showed no sign of recovery. At night, especially before sleep, the coughing grew worse. Li first thought to treat her with medicine; being a doctor himself, he prescribed numerous remedies, yet none brought relief.

On the first day of the seventh month, Li Shuming, as was his custom, burned incense and recited the Scripture at home. Before the Great Emperors of the Three Officials, he offered fresh seasonal fruits and pure water. Secretly, he prayed to the Three Officials: “I beseech the Great Emperors of the Three Officials to grant medicine and bless my mother’s body to heal swiftly.” When the chanting concluded, he gave the offered water to his ailing mother to drink. That very night, her cough ceased. Li Shuming’s faith in the compassion of the Three Officials, their merciful rescue from suffering, and their potent efficacy deepened ever more.

The Water Official of the Three Officials proclaims in the Scripture:  
“Among all beings under Heaven, when the stars fall out of harmony, when fate’s limits delay and linger, when baleful stars clash and conjoin, many illnesses arise: sometimes plague invades, sometimes dysentery and sores afflict, sometimes swelling and scabies attack, sometimes climate causes throat ailments, sometimes wind poisons the throat, sometimes diarrhea and phlegm invade, sometimes ancestral tombs emit pestilential qi, sometimes dwelling sites suffer geomantic afflictions, sometimes evil masters oppose the sacred, sometimes fiery eyes bring wasting disease, sometimes vomiting blood is caused by venom, sometimes white-mouth curses assail, sometimes knives, fire, and thieves strike, sometimes madness and frenzy possess the body, sometimes hanging and shackles afflict, sometimes foul gates close with miasma, sometimes year, month, day, and hour bring misfortune, sometimes cutting down temples and trees causes harm, sometimes begging pits and earthworks disturb, sometimes foundations and marshes are opened, sometimes new additions replace the old, sometimes repairs before and after cause harm, sometimes malaria and rash afflict, sometimes plague fires and pestilential qi invade, sometimes official seals and quarrels afflict, causing grievous illnesses to cling. Those beings infected may perish. Yet if one recites this Scripture, even if evil illnesses cling, auspicious stars will protect, baleful stars will retreat, myriad calamities will melt away like ice, a thousand clouds of blessing will gather. The Scripture penetrates the kingly realms; blessings descend upon the human world.”

By the case of Li Shuming, this is verified—indeed, indeed!
