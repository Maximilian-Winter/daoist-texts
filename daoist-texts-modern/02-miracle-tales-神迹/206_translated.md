# The Daoist of the Southern Peak Playing the Xiao to Summon a Fox

Yesterday, I came across a set of photographs in the ether—an image of a Daoist master playing a *dongxiao* flute upon the vast grasslands, summoning a fox to his side. The fox even approached him with intimate familiarity. I was deeply struck by this marvel. For the fox is a creature of great numinous spirit, and animals are keenly sensitive to humans; they dare not draw near unless they sense safety, ever alert to human peril.

There is a story in the *Liezi*: A man of the sea cherished the *ou* bird. Each dawn upon the ocean, he would swim with the *ou* birds. When the *ou* birds arrived, they would rest a hundred times without alighting. His father said, “I have heard that all the *ou* birds follow you. Bring one to me, that I may delight in it.” The next day upon the sea, the *ou* birds danced but would not descend.

If you harbor no thought of harming animals, they will gladly abide with you; but once such thoughts arise, they flee far away. Thus, if these two Daoist masters were not of the highest cultivation—broad-hearted and compassionate, with no trace of intent to harm sentient beings—the fox would never have drawn near. Another possibility is that this was a fox in cultivation, coming to form a karmic bond with the Daoist. Indeed, tales of foxes in practice abound, and legends of foxes attaining immortality are many. In any case, this is a wondrous event.

The Daoist on the left, playing the flute, I met in two thousand and nine at the Chisong Palace in Jinhua. At that time, he had come from the Southern Peak and was assigned to tend the Three Saints Hall. When idle, he delighted in playing the flute. His appearance was not unremarkable. I was then proud and arrogant, paying him little mind, thinking he neither chanted sutras nor performed high rituals, nor had he studied many books. He did not stay long at Chisong and soon left Jinhua, journeying to Putuo Mountain in Ningbo to pay homage to Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva. My fellow disciple Liu in Ningbo also saw him. There, he played the flute at Putuo, drawing a crowd of tourists who laughed and joked, saying, “The Daoist has come to spoil the scene!” Ha ha. But after that, no more news of him was heard.

The Daoist Tieguan said: Generally, those who cultivate the Dao harbor virtue within and display simplicity without. “They do not desire to be busy like jade, nor noisy like stone.” The more one cultivates, the more the splendor peels away, appearing no different from ordinary folk. As it is said, “Only great heroes can be themselves; true gentlemen are naturally graceful.” When immortals manifest, they often appear in plain guise—sometimes as street beggars, sometimes as drunken revelers, sometimes in tattered clothes, sometimes mad and wild. They play with the world, guiding beings according to fate. Guan Yinzi said: “Sages speak, act, and think, thus they are like men. Those who neither speak, act, nor think are unlike men.” Ordinary people crave vanity. They see true immortals but cannot revere them; they meet perfect persons yet treat them as commonplace. This is because their hearts and nature have not arrived, and so they cannot encounter true teachers nor cultivate to the ultimate Dao.
