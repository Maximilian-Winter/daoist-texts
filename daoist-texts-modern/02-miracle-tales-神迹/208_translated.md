# The Child of Danjiangkou Who Disrespected the Deities and Fell Ill with a Strange Malady

Li Sanrong, a native of Danjiangkou, was a hereditary priest of the Orthodox Daoist tradition, well-versed in the dao and famed throughout his village.

One day, the young aunt of a three-year-old boy from Danjiangkou City came seeking out Master Li. She said: “At home, our child sleeps during the day but at night insists on being held by his grandmother. The moment she lets go, he cries. He has been in the hospital for twenty days, costing over six thousand coins, yet no illness can be found. The doctors are helpless and sent us to the emergency ward of Taihe Hospital in Shiyan, but even there, no cause was discovered. Still, the child remains unwell.”

Master Li asked to see a photo of the child. Observing the boy’s brow darkened and his face suffused with a black aura of ominous qi, he calculated the divinatory hexagram using the mysterious art of Qimen Dunjia. The star Tianrui appeared, poised above the Tengshe constellation — a sign of ghosts and spirits. The child’s affliction lay in the southeast, corresponding to the Earthly Branch Chen, the watery reservoir. Chen is also Earth, dominant in the third lunar month. The star Tianchong, the True Deity, was present. Master Li then told the family: “Your child, in the third month of this year, played by the reservoir or river and offended the deities. Hence this strange illness.”

Master Li said the child had collided with evil spirits, but the family did not believe him. He said no more. After returning home and resting at noon, the child’s grandmother dreamed that the Earth Deity appeared. He claimed to be the Earth Deity of Liangshui River in Danjiangkou City. There was no Earth Temple by the riverbank; the deity sat upon a great stone there. In the third lunar month, the child and a group of friends played by the water. To show his strength, the boy pushed a large red stone into the river. Because the child pushed the stone, naturally he fell ill. The Earth Deity instructed the family to properly handle the place, warning that if delayed by hospital treatment, the child’s life would be in grave danger.

Awakening suddenly, the grandmother recalled Master Li’s words from that morning and hurried back to his home, begging him to help resolve the matter. Master Li said, “The remedy is not difficult. First, prepare the three offerings and five sacrifices, burn ample paper money, and apologize to the Earth Deity with sincere repentance. Then clear away the stone pile and properly enshrine the deity.” The family eagerly agreed to follow these instructions. The stone that housed the Earth Deity’s spirit was cleared in less than twenty minutes. The child then vomited a great quantity of black filth. Alarmed, the family wanted to rush him to Wuhan for emergency care, but Master Li said, “No harm done; it is good that it came out.” After vomiting, the child felt sleepy. His grandmother held him as he fell asleep. Trying to lay him down on the bed, he did not cry. He slept soundly until two in the morning, when he sat up and said, “Just now, an old man with a white beard came and touched my head, telling me to get up. Grandma, I’m hungry.” The grandmother wept. The hospital had no food, so she gave the child some biscuits. The boy then slept peacefully through the night and was discharged early the next morning to return home.

The Iron-Crowned Daoist said: “In Zhuangzi there is mention of the community deity whose spirit dwells in trees. Even now, Earth Deities lodge their spirits in stones. The Earth and Community Deity commands the spirits, able to traverse Heaven and Earth, entering the hidden and the netherworld. They are the grassroots officers of the divine realm, protecting the peace of their domain. Therefore, we must all bow with reverence and never dare offend them. Should one collide with them, one must promptly offer ritual obeisance and repent sincerely.

Yet throughout the Ten Directions and the Three Realms, in the vast emptiness, where is there not a deity? Raise your head three feet and there are spirits. In the mysterious depths, destiny is fixed. Some do evil in secret, thinking no one knows. But ghosts and gods watch and the Three Officials examine all; good and evil are clearly distinguished. Those who do good naturally gather blessings; evildoers sooner or later meet calamity. Do not harbor illusions just because no one sees your deeds.”
