# Mr. Su of Xuzhou and the Repeated Dreams of Infants Clinging Close

Mr. Su, a native of Xuzhou in Jiangsu, was born into a family of some wealth. Handsome in appearance, he was the cherished child in his parents’ eyes. While attending university in Nanjing, he courted several young women, at times entangling himself with multiple girlfriends simultaneously. Among these, a few female students underwent abortions for his sake. Mr. Su took this as a matter of course, sometimes even boasting to friends about his exploits. One roommate, devoutly reverent of the Three Treasures, once earnestly warned Mr. Su: “Do not act thus. The Dao of Heaven bears witness; cause and effect cannot be escaped.” Yet Mr. Su, lost in sensual pleasures, paid no heed.

After graduation, the family business faltered and collapsed, draining their wealth. Mr. Su retreated to his ancestral home, unwilling to work, his spirit withered and listless. At times, he dreamed of two or three infants, clad in red bellybands, frolicking about his side—only to suddenly burst into wails, crying out, “Father, why do you treat us so?”

One year, during the Spring Festival, his family urged him to meet a match. They sent his photograph to a prospective bride, who, upon seeing his eyes, said, “This man’s gaze is lascivious,” and refused further acquaintance.

Mr. Su was deeply troubled. He reached out to his former roommate for counsel. The roommate said, “Back when you were studying, you indulged in sensuality, committing the sin of licentiousness. The Three Officials have long recorded this. Moreover, you caused abortions without care, harming life and wounding fate. The grudges of these infant spirits cling to you, unwilling to depart, thus bringing upon you bitter retribution. You must urgently repent, perform rites to liberate these infant spirits, and perhaps find release.”

He then instructed Mr. Su to copy several scrolls: the *Wondrous Scripture for Resolving Grievances of Three Lifetimes*, the *True Scripture for Deliverance from the Lake of Blood*, and the *Scripture of Purity and Stillness*. They also invited a venerable dharma master to perform morning and evening rites to the Three Primes, to untie grievances and release bonds, and to conduct the Lingbao sacrificial refinement. On the day of the Zhongyuan Festival, Mr. Su dreamed of the infants bearing halos behind their backs, who said, “Father, thank you for calling the immortals to receive us. Farewell.” From that time forth, he never dreamed of infants again.

The Iron-Crowned Daoist said: “People today, lost in sensuality, seek fleeting pleasure, unaware that this is a sea of suffering without end. Some do not believe in cause and effect, nor revere ghosts and spirits. Yet the Dao of Heaven is just and returns all things; good and evil receive their due, clear and unerring.

“The infant spirits originally sought life, struggling to be born, only to perish in the womb, suffering the torment of cutting and poison. How deep their resentment and venom—how could one treat this lightly? Thus they linger, unwilling to leave, ensnaring the sinful parents. How can their fortunes be good? Were it not for the Most High’s compassion in setting forth this boat of methods, then beings would repay grievances endlessly, with no end in sight. Alas! Rather than drown in sensuality and the boundless sea of suffering, better to turn back, bow before the Mysterious Sovereign, and take refuge in the Three Treasures.”

It is said:

> Some indulge in sensual pleasures, all sentient beings,  
> Sinking deep into the boundless sea of suffering.  
> Bowing before the Flowery Forest, worshipping the East,  
> Looking up to the Mysterious Grace to dispel calamities and obstacles.
