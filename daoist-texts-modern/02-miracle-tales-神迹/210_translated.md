# A Virtuous Layman of Shandong Transcends the Unoffered Orphaned Souls

Li Chengshun, a native of Qingdao in Shandong, one year suddenly dreamed a vision. In his dream appeared three or five ragged children, their garments tattered and worn, following closely behind him. Vaguely, there was also a monk among them.

Upon awakening, he gradually sensed misfortune shadowing all affairs, his whole body drained of strength. Thus, he sought out the local Daoist master to inquire into the root cause. The Daoist asked, “Have you ever caused a miscarriage?”

Li Chengshun replied, “I have always been single before; I have no such experience.”

The Daoist pressed further, “Then when did this condition arise?”

Li Chengshun answered, “Only this year.”

“Have you recently moved to a new dwelling?”

“Yes,” Li Chengshun responded.

He went on to explain that he now labored at a construction site, which had formerly been an Anti-Japanese War memorial hall. When the Japanese devils invaded China, fierce battles were waged here; the invaders slaughtered many innocent villagers. Yet no transcendence rites were ever performed, so the resentment remained heavy, and orphaned souls wandered restless. Sometimes, even in the scorching heat, a sudden chill wind would sweep through the room, causing the hairs on one’s skin to stand on end. The elders said that once there was a monk’s temple here. The monk had sided with the Japanese, aiding the invaders. The villagers, unable to bear this betrayal, slew the monk.

The Daoist said, “Souls who die with grievances, whose questions remain unresolved, refuse to reincarnate. Or at death, they may have been bound by a sealing spell, their souls detained here. They become orphaned spirits and wild ghosts, unrecorded by the City God, unnoted by the Eastern Peak, and thus cannot be reborn. Alas, alas!”

Li Chengshun kowtowed and said, “Today they have found me, knowing I have a dao affinity. Therefore, no matter what, I shall help them. I hope the Daoist master will show mercy, raise the great dharma cloud, bestow the great dharma rain, universally grant sweet dew, save the netherworld, and guide the unoffered souls directly to the joy of Heaven and Earth. Your disciple will spare no expense to assist.”

Thus, on an auspicious day, an altar was established. The Great Yellow Register fast was performed, universally aiding the netherworld. The ritual feast was complete; heavenly sweet rain descended. The next day, clouds dispersed and rain ceased, and the place felt clear and bright, filled with auspicious qi that filled the courtyard.
