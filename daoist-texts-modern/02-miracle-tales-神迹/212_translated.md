# The Spirit-Effective Repayment of the Yin Debt by Chen Maogong of Hangzhou

Chen Maogong, a native of Lin’an Prefecture in Hangzhou, had taken a wife for many years. They bore five daughters in succession, yet no son was born. Chen Maogong’s father, the venerable Old Master Chen, grew deeply anxious. Even when the thirteenth year of the Republic arrived and the Old Master Chen passed away, Chen Maogong still had no male heir. Two years later, in the fifteenth year of the Republic, Chen Maogong’s wife, Lady Liu, gave birth to a son. The whole family rejoiced greatly and held a feast to invite relatives and friends.

But the good fortune was short-lived. The child of the Chen household fell ill frequently, several times teetering on the brink of death. The Chens sought many healers and even summoned doctors from the provincial capital, yet all could only bring temporary relief before the illness returned. The family was driven to despair, their heads aflame with worry.

One night, Lady Liu, worn thin from tending the child without rest, drifted into a hazy half-sleep. She heard voices outside the door—voices like those of her deceased father-in-law. One voice said, “When will you repay the money you owe me? If you have no money, then this child I will take back.” The Old Master Chen pleaded, “Please grant me a few more days. I will pay the interest first, then settle the rest soon after.” The two voices murmured back and forth for a long while. Lady Liu’s heart trembled, and she could not help but speak aloud. The voices then fell silent.

The next day, Lady Liu recounted the strange encounter to Chen Maogong, who was skeptical. He went to the town and invited a spirit medium to divine the matter. The medium chanted in a singsong voice for some time and then said, “Your fate holds no male heirs. This son of yours was bought by your father with thirty-six hundred strings of cash. Because the debt remains unpaid, someone will come to claim the child back.” Chen Maogong asked, “Then what should be done?” The medium replied, “In three days, prepare twelve catties of paper money and burn it on your father’s grave, so he may have the money to repay this debt. Once the debt is cleared, the one who comes to claim your child will no longer trouble you.” The medium’s words matched exactly what Lady Liu had heard, and Chen Maogong could no longer doubt. Reverently, he prepared offerings and performed rites to honor his late father, then burned the paper money upon the Old Master Chen’s tomb. From that moment on, the child’s illnesses ceased almost entirely.

The Iron-Crowned Daoist said: When a person dies, they transform into a ghost, a yin spirit who watches over those still in the world. Yet even ghosts of the yin realm require money to accomplish their affairs. Therefore, descendants should burn ample paper money for their departed kin, so they may live well over there and thus have the power to aid those in the yang world.

In praise it is said:  
With single-hearted prayers for thriving offspring,  
The ancestors in the yin palace secretly lend aid.  
If not for the spirit medium’s truthful words,  
How would one know the trials after death?
