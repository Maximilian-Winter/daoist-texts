# The Spirit Efficacy of General Liu Tu’s Talisman

Liu Tu, styled Wengang, wore the talisman of the Seventy-Five Generals when he was but fifteen years old. From his youth, he was gifted with a keen mind and excelled in arithmetic. Later, he served as an official in Jiangxia County, where he carried out his duties with unwavering integrity and careful diligence.

In the third year of the Yongchu era under Emperor An of the Later Han, on the night of the tenth day of the second month, at the midnight hour of the Rat, the Lord of Mount Tai dispatched his envoy, Ya Yu, to summon Liu Tu to the celestial realm to assist in verifying the registers of all under Heaven. Ya Yu reassured Liu Tu’s family, saying, “Do not weep; Liu Tu shall not die.”

Liu Tu followed Ya Yu to the heavens, where he beheld the Most High Patriarch of the Dao, the Lord of Mount Tai, the Hidden Immortal Lord, the Celestial Master Lord, and the Lord of Dao and Virtue—five exalted divine immortals. Liu Tu bowed reverently before them. The Most High Patriarch spoke, “I know you have died because you upheld the dao with faith in truth and steadfast goodness. I also know your brilliance in arithmetic. Thus, I have summoned you to verify the registers of life and death for all under Heaven.”

Liu Tu was led to meet the left and right assistants under the Lord of Mount Tai, joining them in the task of verification. By the midnight hour of the second day, Liu Tu completed the work and took his leave of the Patriarch. The Patriarch said, “Come, I will show you the place where the heavenly dao is manifested and upheld, where the sins and blessings of men are adjudicated.”

The envoy Ya Yu brought Liu Tu to a place called Mili. At the first level, he saw over three thousand women, their heads hung upon great trees, their feet shackled with iron chains weighing a hundred and ten catties, enduring cruel torment. At the second level, he saw over three thousand men, similarly with their heads suspended from trees and bound with heavy iron shackles, suffering punishment. He journeyed through the third, fourth, and even the tenth levels, everywhere witnessing souls enduring retribution. Some wore iron shackles; some had their heads hung from trees; some had their hands bound; some were plunged into boiling iron; some bore great stones pressing upon their heads; some were pierced through with forks; some were whipped until their bodies were rotten and their suffering unspeakable. Ya Yu explained, “Those you have just seen are punished for slandering the Three Treasures of the Daoist scriptures and for oppressing the people during their lives, thus incurring these sins.”

At the eleventh level, Liu Tu saw his deceased father among three hundred others being whipped. He prostrated himself before Heaven and cried out, “What crime did my father commit to deserve such punishment?” Ya Yu replied, “Your father was a prison officer in life. He killed without discerning right from wrong, wrongfully harming many good people. For this, he suffers such punishment after death. He must endure seven more years of this torment to repay his karmic debts. I will petition the Heavenly Official on your behalf to seek pardon for your father.”

Liu Tu returned to the Most High Patriarch and kowtowed fervently. The Patriarch said, “Do not worry; I will pardon your father.” He then instructed Ya Yu to take Liu Tu to the Palace of Supreme Clarity. There, he saw thirty-six thousand people clad in azure robes, holding golden slips, chanting scriptures, their food and drink fully provided, and the music resounding to the heavens. Ya Yu said, “These are those who wore the talisman of the Heavenly Official and cultivated the dao with diligence and unwavering devotion in life. Therefore, after death, they enter the realm of Supreme Clarity to enjoy the bliss of paradise.”

Having completed the tour, Liu Tu requested to return to the mortal world. The Patriarch said, “Go back and tell the worldly folk and Daoist practitioners what I have shown you. The fruits of good and evil, the retribution of sin and blessing—all must be known, so that none lightly commit acts that harm Heaven and violate reason. Your return is hurried; I can only reveal these glimpses to you. You mortals and Daoists must shun all evil and practice all good, cleansing your sins each month. I look forward to meeting you again in the time of the Rat and Ox at the White Beast.” After Liu Tu respectfully thanked the Most High Patriarch, he returned to the human realm.

The life and death of men are recorded by the heavenly and earthly officials, who note every sin and blessing. No deed, great or small, escapes their notice. Hence the scriptures say, “The net of Heaven is vast and wide, yet nothing slips through.” Mount Luofeng lies in the northern Gui region, rising two thousand six hundred li, with a circumference of twenty thousand li. The grotto heavens extend for millions of li around, with six palaces at the center—residences of the six ghostly deities of the heavens. Each palace spans one thousand li. After death, souls must pass through these realms, receiving punishment according to their good and evil deeds in life.

Above, below, and within Luofeng Mountain lie eight hells each, totaling twenty-four hells. Beneath Mount Tai are five palace hells. The mountains, rivers, and seas of the world all contain hells. Each hell has its officials who administer punishments such as the Three Paths and the Five Pains. Afterward, souls are sent to Mount Tai, or to the Eastern Sea, or to the Three Evil Paths, or reborn among the barbarian lands beyond China, or born lowly, or born with illness—these are all repayments of debts from past lives.

The Patriarch said, “The virtuous ascend to Heaven; the wicked descend to hell. Those sinners endure manifold sufferings in hell, only to be reborn as beasts or in base stations of life, sent to backward lands without civilization. The sages pity them and teach them the dao of Heaven’s law, that good and evil are recompensed. This is clearly stated in the Inner Transmission of Master Wenshi.” Ignorant people say that Daoism speaks only of purity and emptiness, denying retribution, and thus harbor arrogance and disrespect. How can this not evoke lament? The Most High Patriarch, moved with compassion for the world, has entrusted virtuous men like Liu Tu to reveal the torments of hell and the joys of paradise, hoping all may reform, cultivate goodness, and become upright persons.
