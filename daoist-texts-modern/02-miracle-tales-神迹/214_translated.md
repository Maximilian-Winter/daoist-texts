# The Verified Tale of Liu Guolong of Wenzhou Donating Funds to Repair the Temple

Liu Guolong, a native of Yueqing in Wenzhou, began in the nineteen-nineties to establish a hardware factory at home. As time passed, his life grew steadily prosperous—he owned both carriage and dwelling. One year, Liu Guolong went to the Xuandu Temple to burn incense. At that time, the temple was undergoing repairs, and a benevolent thought arose within him. He donated thirty thousand taels to the temple’s restoration.

In the year of Wùzǐ, when the financial crisis swept across the world, many small factories in Wenzhou collapsed, and Liu Guolong’s factory also fell into hardship. Seeking guidance, he consulted a renowned diviner in Wenzhou. The diviner examined his fate and said: “Your fortune turns from Yǐyǒu year to Rénwǔ great luck. The Wùzǐ year clashes with Heaven’s decree and Earth’s opposition, portending misfortune in your career, coupled with injury and punishment.” The diviner cautioned Liu to be careful, especially when driving.

One autumn night, Liu Guolong dined and drank with several business friends. After the feast, he drove home. Approaching the carriage station, suddenly a freight truck dashed out from the opposite side. Startled, Liu hastily turned the steering wheel. The carriage sped too fast, and the brakes failed to hold. It seemed certain he would plunge into the river. At that moment, as if summoned by Heaven, a mighty warrior appeared—his hair bound, black beard flowing, bare-chested and barefoot, draped diagonally in a short brown garment. With great strength, he held the carriage steady. When the carriage finally stopped, the warrior vanished. Liu alighted and saw the front wheel had already slipped into the river. Greatly astonished, he pondered which divine being had just saved him.

Not long after the accident, Liu rested at home for several days, then told his wife he wished to go to Xuandu Temple to burn incense in gratitude. Upon entering the mountain gate, he saw two mighty warriors stationed there—one was the very same divine figure who had saved him that night. Only then did he realize that because of his earlier donation to repair the temple, the deities had remembered his merit and secretly protected him. He quickly kowtowed in deep thanks.
