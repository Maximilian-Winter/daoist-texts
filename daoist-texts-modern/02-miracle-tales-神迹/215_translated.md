# Cultivating Purity and Walking the Dao: Why One Should Not Seek Signs of Response

Some time ago, a lay devotee came to ask me, saying, “Daoist Master, I often recite the sacred names of the Heavenly Venerables, print scriptures and carve images, donate money to repair temples—yet my fortune remains poor. Today, I had another accident while driving, losing a great sum. Where could the fault lie? Please, Master, show mercy and enlighten me.”

The Iron-Crowned Daoist pondered: surely, other Daoist friends have encountered such troubles.

First, one must do good without clinging to goodness.

The *Dao De Jing* says, “The highest virtue is not virtuous; the lesser virtue clings to virtue.” The *Scripture of Purity and Stillness* teaches, “Those who cling are not called virtuous.” When we perform good deeds, our hearts often think, “This is a good act, accumulating merit and blessings.” Yet this too is a kind of attachment—a selfish one. Helping others with the true aim of “benefiting oneself” cannot be called genuine “doing good.” For in doing so, you expect a return. It is at best a “transaction” or an “investment.” Hence the *Scripture of Purity and Stillness* declares, “Those who cling are not called virtuous.” Such acts cannot be called true virtue.

Some begin with the desire for blessings. Over time, failing to cultivate those blessings, doubt and regret arise—this becomes a demon’s snare. The ancients said, “Bestow kindness without seeking reward; deal with others without regret.”

For the cultivator, doing good is not about expecting some return for the deed. Rather, it is because the act accords with the great Dao’s demand, bringing peace to one’s heart. This is true goodness. A merchant invests expecting profit; the Daoist cultivator’s goodness transcends profit and the mundane, caring not for reward.

Second, in cultivating purity and walking the dao, one must not hope for signs of response.

Some lay devotees perform rituals at temples hoping for efficacy. Some masters of high skill even proclaim their rituals’ miraculous effects. Yet they do not know: yin and yang are mutually rooted; where there is efficacy, there is also inefficacy. Thus, the Patriarchs never dared claim their rituals were always efficacious.

In the *Record of Words by the White Perfected of the Sea Jade*, there is this exchange:

A disciple spoke with the Purple Pivot about talismanic water, saying, “Those who seek it are not always sincere; some test it. I have tried giving it, but often it does not work.”

The Patriarch heard this and said, “Do not let their falsehood be your burden, while you receive it with truth. Whether it works or not is another matter.”

He added, “Do not ask if it is efficacious or not; do not ask if it is true or false. Simply act with faith and then let go of all thoughts.”

A disciple asked the White Patriarch, “Some who come seeking talismanic water lack faith. I try giving them the water with incantations, but sometimes it works, sometimes not.” The White Jade Cicada Patriarch replied, “Your attitude is mistaken. They come with falsehood (doubt), you receive with truth (sincerity). Whether it is efficacious depends on them.”

So it is with cultivating purity and walking the dao. Some come to the temple to perform rituals and ask, “Does this ritual work? Will my fortune improve? How soon will effects arise?” As ritual masters, such questions show a lack of faith. When one harbors doubt toward the ritual, how can one expect to connect with the numinous?

Some burn incense and offer to the gods, yet attract evil spirits. Why? Because their hearts harbor desires, and those ghosts and demons manifest as the forms they seek. In truth, these are but reflections of one’s inner world. The cultivator who desires nothing leaves spirits powerless.

The Patriarch established the ritual of purity with this original intent: to aid worldly people, whose bodies and minds are scattered and impure. Thus, the ritual purifies the body through vegetarian food and bathing; it purifies the heart with precepts, solemn demeanor, hymns, meditation, scripture recitation, and incantations, calming the scattered mind. Through repentance, the heart is uplifted and comforted. The divine way’s teachings use all these means as skillful devices, expedient methods to help us discover our true inner selves—not for any external, utilitarian aim.

When we sincerely take refuge in the Heavenly Venerable’s great Dao and pay homage to the Supreme Sage and Perfected, it reminds us not to forget the Dao itself. The great Dao has no beginning or end, yet it births and transforms all things. The Supreme Sage and Perfected are condensed Dao qi, incarnations of the great Dao. We must learn from the Patriarch, not forget his teachings, and hope that through ceaseless cultivation, we may reach the realm of unity with the Dao and attain long life and enduring vision.
