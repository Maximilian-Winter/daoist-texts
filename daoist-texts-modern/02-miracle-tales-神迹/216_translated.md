# The Story of Layman Zhang’s Inquiry into the Dao after a Miscarriage

Layman Zhang, a native of Huanggang in Hubei, once suffered a miscarriage in the year of Bing Shen. Guided by a monk from Ziguo Monastery, he took to reciting the *Sutra of Kṣitigarbha* each night, and in the spring morning of the year Ding You, he made pilgrimage to the sacred site of Bodhisattva Kṣitigarbha. Yet, Layman Zhang’s condition showed no sign of improvement. Strange and unsettling events grew worse: nightmares plagued his sleep, wealth slipped through his fingers, and even his beloved parted ways with him.

Bewildered and troubled, Layman Zhang sought counsel from a Chan master. The master said plainly, “Your karmic obstacles are too heavy. Simply recite the *Sutra of Kṣitigarbha* more often; all will be well.” With no other recourse, Layman Zhang turned instead to the Great Dao. A Daoist adept took him under his wing, instructing him to perform the supreme Huanglu Great Fast for a full day and night, issuing the Yellow Register and White Slip of Pardon, thereby liberating the spirits of orphaned infants and countless wandering souls. From that moment forth, the troubles largely ceased.

Overjoyed, Layman Zhang recounted these events to the Chan master at Ziguo Monastery. The master said, “That Daoist adept was a Bodhisattva manifesting to aid you. Now that your affairs are settled, you must go to the Bodhisattva’s sacred ground to fulfill your vow.” Hearing this, Layman Zhang found it reasonable, packed his belongings, secured his carriage ticket, and set out for the mountain pilgrimage.

But on descending the mountain, he stumbled and fell, losing his soul in the process. From that day to this, his mind has been unsteady, and he constantly speaks of being followed by unseen beings. He returned once more to the Daoist adept, who said, “With compassion, I must say, I cannot save you. Your karmic burden is too great. Recite the *Sutra of Kṣitigarbha* more often, and you will find relief.”
