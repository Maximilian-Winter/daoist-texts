# Grasping Life, Substituting Death, and the Bewitchment of the Mind by Ghosts

In recent days at Nanchang Dream Times Square, there have been continuous incidents of people leaping from heights. Some say it is a matter of feng shui; others claim it is the dead seizing substitutes to die in their stead. This brings to mind an event I personally witnessed several years ago in Fujian.

It was on an excursion to a hydroelectric station, where the dam soared as high as five stories—one can imagine how deep the reservoir’s waters must have been. Suddenly, without reason, I felt an urge to swim. I even took off my shoes. Since I was accompanied by fellow daoists, I refrained from removing my clothes, intending to swim fully clothed. Then my senior uncle sharply rebuked me, asking what I intended to do. I said I wished to bathe in the water. He replied, “Do you not wish to live? To bathe in waters so deep!” 

Later, returning to the temple, a chill ran down my spine; a lingering dread remained. The weather was not even very hot—just around the fifth or sixth month of the solar calendar. Truly, it was a case of the mind bewitched by ghosts. A voice kept urging me: “Dive down and swim, it’s so cool.” To plunge into such fathomless depths, especially at the very deepest point, would be to court disaster beyond imagining. Thus, I hold that the phrase “bewitched by ghosts” is not a mere fabrication. When entering the mountains, it is best to wear the Five Peaks True Form talisman.

The Iron-Crowned Daoist says: The *Jade Pivot Scripture* states, “Grasping life, substituting death.” This means that in certain places, the souls of those who died unnatural deaths linger, their ethereal and corporeal souls bound to the locale, unable to reincarnate. They require others to fill their vacant places, so only those who died prematurely may then be reborn. These ghosts cause great confusion among the living, turning things upside down and leading them to untimely deaths. Therefore, once a place harbors souls of unnatural death, similar tragedies tend to occur one after another. If one’s yang energy is weak, one is easily ensnared by these spirits. It is advised to carry the Five Peaks True Form talisman on one’s person. Should one find oneself lost in the mountains, trapped in a ghostly maze, then recite the nine-character mantra recorded in the *Baopuzi*: “Lin Bing Dou Zhe Jie Lie Zu Qian Xing”—“The soldiers and fighters arrayed, all in ranks advance before.”
