# The Response to the Printing of the Scripture of the Three Officials by Wen Shuhua of Jiaxing

Wen Shuhua, a native of Jiaxing in Zhejiang, was the mother of a son surnamed Liu. This young Master Liu, from his earliest days, was bright and clever, beloved by all at home, cherished as the treasure of the entire family. Wen Shuhua’s household ran a garment factory, bustling with business throughout the year, and within just a few years, they amassed a fortune of one million in wealth.

One year, on the Festival of the La (the eighth day of the twelfth lunar month), Wen Shuhua took her beloved son to the Great Blessing Temple in Jiaxing to burn incense and pay homage to the Buddhas. The Great Blessing Temple was a monastery with two monastics. A certain bhikkhuni, upon seeing the child, was exceedingly pleased and ladled some of her bowl’s La porridge to the boy. Wen Shuhua thought little of it—after all, it was a blessing bestowed by a monastic. Yet upon returning home, the child began to suffer from uncontrollable defecation, frequently soiling himself. They took him to the hospital for examination; all indicators were normal.

They then went to Shanghai and consulted the finest doctors for a joint diagnosis, but no ailment was found. Fortune tellers were consulted, feng shui masters sought, yet no remedy appeared. On one occasion, due to business matters, Wen Shuhua traveled with her son to Jiangxi. Upon entering Jiangxi’s domain, the boy’s condition returned to normal. The couple sensed something uncanny—surely some spirit or demon was at work. They invited a local shamaness to investigate, but she declared it was a grudge from a past life and confessed her powerlessness to intervene.

Because of this affliction, the couple lost heart in managing the garment factory; business plummeted, debts piled high. Yet they continued seeking cures. Someone introduced them to a great tantric master, a Rinpoche of profound dharma power and accomplished practice, residing somewhere in Shanghai. The couple drove to seek his aid. The living Buddha examined Wen Shuhua’s son and said, “Your son’s root of wisdom is deep. Yet because your ancestors once committed transgressions, this enemy lies in wait to take revenge.” Wen Shuhua replied, “My ancestors seem not to have committed any wrongdoing. And even if it is revenge, why did it not begin until after my child turned five?” The living Buddha said, “Demons and ghosts harm only when one’s fortune declines. As for whether transgressions were committed, you will know in time.” Wen Shuhua implored the living Buddha to save them. The master commanded his attendant to give the child a dew-elixir pill, instructing that before sleep at home, it be swallowed with warm water.

Remarkably, this dew-elixir pill had some effect. After taking it, the child began to ask Wen Shuhua for toilet paper when he needed to relieve himself. Wen Shuhua was overjoyed and spent her days chanting tantric spells at home. But the good times did not last. After about three months, the young Master Liu’s affliction returned. Wen Shuhua returned once more to Shanghai, but the living Buddha said, “This is as far as I can help you.” The Wen family was deeply frustrated, at a loss. Her eyesight began to fail as well.

One day, Wen Shuhua went to Jiaxing People’s Hospital for an eye ailment. On the way back, she saw ahead a Daoist priest, his hair bound and knotted, wearing a star-crowned headdress, clad in a dark blue hemp Daoist robe. He leaned on a staff and wore double-beamed shoes. A bundle hung slantwise across his shoulder. Wen Shuhua called out hurriedly, “Daoist Master! Daoist Master!” The priest stopped. Wen Shuhua quickly approached and bowed. The priest’s face was lean, his eyes clear and bright. He said, “Did the female lay devotee call me?” Wen Shuhua answered, “Yes, Daoist Master!” and then recounted her many years of seeking medical aid, pleading, “Please, Daoist Master, show mercy and save us.”

This Daoist Master, surnamed Li, was a disciple of the Qingwei lineage. All his life he delighted in wandering famous mountains and blessed places, seeking immortals and visiting the dao. This time he was en route to Siming Mountain in Ningbo, passing through Jiaxing. Wen Shuhua invited Daoist Li to her home. The family told him, “Last night there were strange clanging noises upstairs; we do not know what caused them.” Daoist Li said, “He knew I would come today.” He instructed Wen Shuhua to prepare lamps, candles, and fruits, and to set up an altar in the main hall, surrounding the room with red candles. He warned, “While I perform the ritual, no loud noise is allowed.”

Around nine o’clock that evening, Daoist Li began his rite. First, he lit the incense burner to summon generals to guard the altar. Holding a flowing-gold fire bell in his right hand and forming jade talismanic mudras with his left, he chanted secret mantras. Suddenly, a cold wind rose from beneath the ground. Daoist Li calmly shook his bell, guiding the chill wind into a prepared urn, quickly sealing it with a Heavenly Master’s numinous talisman.

Daoist Li explained to Wen Shuhua, “Your father once schemed to cause another’s death. That person, after death, lodged a complaint with the Three Officials and received their sanction to seek revenge. Now that the appointed time has come, he should have reincarnated. Yet he lingers, entangled by unresolved grudges and unbroken resentment. Today I bring him back to properly guide and liberate him.” Wen Shuhua, hearing this, was filled with boundless gratitude. Daoist Li said, “However, you must print five hundred copies of the Scripture of the Three Officials. This will both dedicate merit to him, helping dissolve his resentment swiftly, and accumulate merit for yourself.” Wen Shuhua kowtowed repeatedly, saying, “It shall be done as you command.”

From that day forward, young Master Liu’s body returned to normal. Wen Shuhua’s business gradually recovered its profits.
