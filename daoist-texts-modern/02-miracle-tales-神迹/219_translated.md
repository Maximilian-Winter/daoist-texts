# Chen Chongmiao of Xiushui’s Method of Seeking the Dao Without Sincerity

Chen Chongmiao was a man of Xiushui. From the age of about sixteen, he followed the local elder Daoists to learn how to perform the rites. After three years as an apprentice, his term fulfilled, he prepared to receive his commission and the register of office. For this, he invited the renowned high Daoists of Xiushui to come and serve as the Three Great Masters.

When transmitting the dao in various places, the old custom required the master to “pass the method.” But how was this method passed? Each place had its own way. In some regions, the master would take a sip of water, hold it in his mouth, then spit it out for the disciple to drink. Elsewhere, the master would chew his meal thoroughly, then spit it out for the disciple to consume. Some places even passed on morsels of chewed meat. In other spots, the master would simply spit into a cup, and the disciple would drink it.

On the day of commissioning and transmission, several elder Daoists ascended the altar—each well into their seventies or eighties. When it came to passing the method and bestowing the commission, these venerable elders chewed their rice thoroughly and spat it out for Chen Chongmiao to eat. But Chen Chongmiao, feeling it was unclean, refused to swallow it and discreetly spat it out in a quiet corner. The ritual concluded smoothly; he received his register, and no one thought much of the matter.

The next day, as Chen Chongmiao passed by the spot where the rice had been spat out, he found the ground strewn with talismans, incantations, and registers of office. Only then did deep regret seize him.

The Iron-Crowned Daoist said: “Whenever immortals transmit the dao, they sometimes manifest in forms most repellent to the senses. Often this is to test the sincerity of those who seek the dao—whether their hearts are truly earnest. If one cannot cast aside the prejudices of the mundane world, how can one grasp the true essence of the great dao? Chen Chongmiao’s failing lay in his insincerity in seeking the dao, his lack of earnest faith. Thus, he missed the great dao by a hair’s breadth. In his eyes, he saw only the frail bodies of the elder Daoists, not the dao-methods they transmitted. Yet there are those who, puffed up by worldly wealth and status, disdain the ultimate truth and slight the great dao. Are such people few in this world? They do not know that wealth and status are but fleeting illusions, like dreams and bubbles, vanishing in an instant, while the great dao is vast and boundless, enduring through kalpas without end.”
