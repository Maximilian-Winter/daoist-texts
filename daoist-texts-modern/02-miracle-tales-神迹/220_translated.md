# The Tale of the Practitioner of the Dao and the Mountain Demons and Wood Spirits

Zou Daozhang, a native of Nanyang in Henan, was a Daoist of the Taiqing Palace in Nanyang. He inherited the rites of Fengdu, overseeing summons and the interrogation of the netherworld’s courts, often manifesting numinous efficacy, gaining renown throughout his village. In his later years, he especially excelled at ascending the altar to perform the dao, and the local folk regarded him as a transcendent immortal. Zou Daozhang himself also took pride in being a celestial immortal.

One night, Zou Daozhang dreamed that a heavenly envoy clad in vermilion robes descended from the heavens. The envoy proclaimed, “Master Zou, throughout your life you have subdued demons and vanquished evil spirits, your merit and virtue are profound. The Jade Emperor has issued an imperial decree, appointing you as an immortal official. On the fifteenth day of the coming month, at the hour of the tiger, the immortal carriage will come to receive you. Please prepare yourself in advance.” Zou Daozhang accepted the decree with gratitude, deeply moved.

When the day arrived, he bade farewell early to his fellow Daoists and disciples, bathed and changed his garments, and awaited the arrival of the celestial conveyance. Sure enough, the sounds of flutes, pipes, drums, and cymbals drifted through the air, and a palanquin floated gracefully to a halt before the gate of Taiqing Palace. Zou Daozhang bowed respectfully to the assembled immortals, then mounted the carriage, his heart secretly jubilant.

The palanquin traveled for about half an hour. Then the music ceased, but outside the carriage, a chilling wind howled. Soon, a voice called out, “Step down.” Zou Daozhang found this strange — moments before they had addressed him reverently as “Immortal Lord,” yet now they spoke so rudely. He alighted and looked around. The carriage stood at the edge of a precipice thousands of feet deep. Across the abyss hovered a line of fiendish spirits, their faces green, fanged, their forms grotesque and uncanny. These demons said, “You have spent your life practicing the dao, killing countless of our kin and friends. Now, will you leap down yourself, or shall we escort you on your way?”

Zou Daozhang felt certain that death was inevitable today. He said to the fiends, “I am fully aware my sins are grave, and I deserve death as atonement. Yet I set out early this morning and have not yet drunk water. Might I drink a sip before I die?” The demons considered this a reasonable request and brought him a bowl of water. Zou Daozhang cupped the water in his left hand, forming the Three Mountains hand seal, while his right hand traced the sword talisman seal. He sipped the water and then spat it toward the demons. Instantly, dark clouds dispersed, and the fiends vanished. Zou Daozhang hurried back to Taiqing Palace.

His fellow Daoists were puzzled. “Did you not ascend to immortality? How have you returned?” Zou Daozhang recounted everything to them. They were deeply moved and sighed. Not long after his return, Zou Daozhang fell gravely ill and within a few days, he feathered away.

The Iron-Crowned Daoist said: The incantation speaks of “slaying thousands of ghosts.” The Patriarch believed that those who cultivate the dao must not harbor an overly heavy heart of killing. Thus, “slaying thousands of ghosts” was changed to “saving thousands of people.” When encountering evil spirits causing trouble, there is often a prior cause. The practitioner must first seek to reconcile grievances and persuade enemies to peace. If persuasion fails, one must understand the circumstances; if genuine enmity exists, one must not be blindly protective. But if the demons are wantonly stirring trouble, then one may call upon thunder and lightning to punish them. The rites of Fengdu are famed for their severity; though efficacious, the wrath of ghosts and spirits is terrifying indeed. The story of Zou Daozhang serves as a warning to all who practice the dao.
