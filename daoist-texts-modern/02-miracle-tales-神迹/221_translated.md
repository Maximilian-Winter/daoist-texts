# The Venerable Master Huang Shi of Taiwan’s Daoist Tradition Performs the Star Ritual for Chiang Ching-kuo

In the contemporary Daoist world of Taiwan, the venerable Master Huang Shi stands as a towering figure. His lineage is noble and revolutionary—his grandfather was the martyr Huang Xing, a pioneer of the revolution. Within the circles of Taiwan’s Daoist clergy and political realm alike, his renown is profound. As early as the year two thousand eleven, he foresaw with uncanny clarity that Ma Ying-jeou would secure a second term as president; his divinations were remarkably efficacious. Yet his mastery did not end there—he was also well-versed in the myriad arts and techniques of Daoist occult knowledge.

It is said that in a time long past, when Chiang Ching-kuo lay gravely ill, stricken with the late stages of cancer, he summoned Master Huang Shi to his bedside. With a voice weighed down by the shadow of death, he said, “I am not yet ready to depart this world. I still wish to live on for several more years, to build Taiwan into a better land.” Huang Shi inquired gently, “President, how many years do you hope to live on?” Chiang replied with resolve, “Ten years will suffice.” The venerable Master responded with calm assurance, “Very well, I shall petition the heavens on your behalf.”

Thus, he summoned his disciples, and together they entered a state of pure fasting and ritual purification. They bathed and cleansed themselves, then set up the celestial altar of the stars, invoking the numinous powers to seek the extension of life for Master Chiang Ching-kuo. The fast endured for forty-nine days. Upon the altar, fragrant clouds of incense curled and danced, while lamps burned with resplendent brilliance. Banners and canopies of precious brocade adorned the solemn sanctuary, lending it a majestic dignity. Offerings of incense, candles, and fruit were presented to the exalted spirits. The ethereal sounds of the “Stepping into Emptiness” chant soared through the clouds, while the azure-hued petitions were composed and sent forth, ascending to the heavenly bureaus. Truly, it was as the scriptures foretold: “The merit official carries the scroll away; the immortal officer descends with blessings.”

When the fasting period reached its full completion, Master Huang Shi informed Chiang Ching-kuo with solemn joy, “I have already entreated the celestial court to grant you ten years of yang life.” Indeed, the president’s illness soon began to wane, his body gradually restored to vigor. With these ten years granted by the heavens, Chiang Ching-kuo devoted himself to the vigorous construction of Taiwan. Those final ten years became the golden era of Taiwan’s economic flourishing, a time when the island blossomed under his stewardship.
