# The Story of Master Xiao of Nanning and the Mistakes in the Scripture

Master Xiao, the steward of Taihe Temple in Nanning City, was devoted to the restoration and rebuilding of the temple. The Daoist priests of the temple took on many scripture recitations and repentance ceremonies. Sometimes, when the workload became overwhelming, Master Xiao would say to Senior Disciple Gao, “Just do it faster. Skip over the parts that can be spared.” Master Gao replied, “Master, is that proper? It would be a sin.” The steward answered, “We earn money to repair the temple, not to indulge ourselves. What sin is there? If there is sin, I will bear it alone.” With no choice, Master Gao agreed. At times, a blessing ritual would be finished in half an hour. The Qingxuan sacrificial refinement would be done in just over an hour. Passages were recited out of order, scriptures were mistaken or omitted. Once, after drinking wine at noon, Master Xiao even ascended the altar to recite the Imperial Scripture. Over time, everyone grew accustomed to this and no longer found it strange.

In the blink of three or five years, the temple was nearly restored. Suddenly, Master Xiao felt unwell and went to the hospital for examination. It was already late-stage cancer. Before passing, Master Xiao lay in the elixir chamber, pulling the straw hidden beneath his quilt and eating it, saying, “This tastes good.” No matter how they tried to stop him, he would not be deterred. Soon after, he departed from this world. Everyone believed this was a sign that in his next life he would be reborn as cattle or horse.

The Iron-Crowned Daoist said: At the Eastern Peak there are monks and Daoists appointed to judge the merits and demerits of monks and Daoists. There is also a Scripture Completion Hall, filled with many small dark rooms. When monks and Daoists recite scriptures in life and make mistakes or omissions, after death they must go to the Scripture Completion Hall to fill in the missing passages before they can be released. Some who live scattered and go out to hold Daoist rites, upon discovering errors or omissions, will return home and recite the scriptures again on their own altar. Whether reciting scriptures, building temples and palaces, or crafting divine images and ritual implements, one must devote heart and effort, follow the proper methods and rites, and not be negligent or careless. The ways of the spirits are manifest and clear—it is not to be doubted.
