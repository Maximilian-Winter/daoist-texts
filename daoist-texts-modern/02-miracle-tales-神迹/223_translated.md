# The Recluse Daoist: Devoutly Cultivating Fasting to Attain the Immortal Dao

Li Dade, Daoist Master, is a recluse Daoist from a rural village in Jiangxi. Engaged in ritual teaching and ceremony, he has followed his master from childhood, traveling far and wide to conduct Daoist rites. Whether cutting paper talismans, writing couplets, divining the land, selecting auspicious dates, or beating gongs and drums, there is nothing he does not master.

In the countryside, Daoist rites are always held at the fasting host’s home, with the altars and ritual spaces quite modest. Yet Master Li never dares to be negligent. He possesses several genuine silk ritual robes, a boxwood repentance plaque, ivory morning tablets, and divine portraits—all heirlooms passed down from his ancestral patriarchs. When some offered high prices to buy them, Master Li firmly refused. According to the lineage recorded in his ritual texts, Master Li’s tradition descends from the True Man Zhao Yuanyang of the Song and Yuan eras. Though some errors crept in over generations, the rites he performs still carry the ancient Song-Yuan spirit.

Once, Master Li was invited to the Deng family ancestral hall in Shenzhen to perform a liberation rite. Even past nine at night, the ritual was still underway. Suddenly, outside came a low, wailing sound, growing ever nearer. The Deng clan members, terrified, all fled home. Only Master Li and a few disciples remained to continue the food-offering ceremony. After the rite concluded, the sound gradually receded. When I asked if he was afraid, Master Li said, “Of course there is some fear. But as Daoist masters, we must not show weakness. If we lose our composure, then we lose all our authority.”

Master Li said, “When we conduct rites, we follow the prescribed ritual to the letter. Whatever the master taught, that is what we do. As reclusive Daoists, our role is ‘to take people’s money and dispel their calamities.’ We cannot cut corners or perform incomplete rites; we must not fool the host. During the ritual, one must not look around or let the mind wander. The scripture says: ‘Return the body, return the spirit, return the life.’ Even life itself must be surrendered within. The spirit must not stray; one thought must be pure sincerity; the breath steady and calm. Only then can the ritual be efficacious.”

Master Li said that his family has been Daoists for thirteen generations. He does not know about the earliest ancestors, but his father and grandfather all lived long lives. His grandfather passed the age of eighty; before departing, he bathed his hair and dressed properly, then transformed like a feathered immortal. His father also passed peacefully, without illness, at noon.

The Iron-Crowned Daoist remarked: “Most reclusive Daoists do not know the methods of inner refinement, focusing solely on performing rites. They treat ritual as a craft. Yet their lineage is strict, preserving many ancient rules. I have seen many recluses in Jiangsu and Shanghai who have spent their lives performing rites. Even at eighty or ninety, they still ascend the altar, their voices loud and clear, their steps brisk—not inferior to the young. Thus, those who perform rites, if they strictly observe their lineage and altar rules, are in fact cultivating themselves and gaining real benefit.”

Nowadays, there is a saying: “Chanting scriptures and bowing repentance is the patriarch’s playacting; sitting in meditation and refining elixirs is the patriarch’s true discipleship.” This sharply divides ritual from cultivation. But this is mistaken. The ritual, originally called fasting method, is fasting as in ‘bringing into alignment.’ The world’s thoughts are scattered and uneven; through cultivating fasting, one aligns what is misaligned, reaching the realm of non-action. When the mind is clear and conduct pure, one can then harmonize with the Dao of Heaven. If one cannot achieve these two points, merely decorating the outer ceremony, it is like child’s play—insufficient to move the divine numinous.

The Patriarch Bai Yuchan said: “In ancient times, the sages found the study of the Dao difficult to enter, while the world’s desires easily misled. So they established ritual precepts and models to unify the outward forms; they wrote methods of focused recitation and concentration to correct the heart. Then, by refining the breath and the primordial embryo, they regulated diet and flavor; further, by offering prayers to the True Ones and performing morning and evening acknowledgments, they cleansed faults and offenses. Thus, those without learning could reach profound stillness, dwelling in the realm of ‘lessening and yet lessening.’ They attuned to non-action, so that the gates of deceit and trickery remained closed, and pure tranquility and harmony could be attained.” 

Studying the Dao is a matter of non-action, but non-action is difficult for ordinary people to achieve. Therefore, one begins with action. When performing rites, through solemn demeanor and focused thought, one purifies body and mind, concentrating the spirit. Over time, pure harmony is attained, and the immortal Dao becomes a hopeful prospect!
