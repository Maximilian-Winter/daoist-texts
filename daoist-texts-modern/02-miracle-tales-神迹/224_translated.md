# The Story of Daoist Zhang of Qionglong Mountain and the Transcendence Rite

Upon Qionglong Mountain stands the True Sanctuary, the very place where Patriarch Shidao Yuan first opened his lineage and transmitted the Thunder Methods of the Divine Firmament. Here dwell lofty sages and reclusive hermits, masters of profound arts and skilled in wondrous techniques.

In the years of the Guangxu reign, there came a gentleman of Suzhou named Hu Jiayou. He arrived at the guest hall of the True Sanctuary and spoke to the steward: “Last night, my mother appeared in a dream, entrusting me to seek here a Daoist named Zhang, the one who sweeps the grounds, to perform her transcendence rite.”

At that time, many Daoists served at the True Sanctuary. The steward found it strange—why not seek a master of great功, but instead a mere sweeper? He said, “There are many Daoists here, but only a few can perform the sacred ceremonies and rites of transcendence. There is indeed a Daoist surnamed Zhang, but he does not recite scriptures. Perhaps you should invite one of our masters of high功?” Hu the gentleman replied, “My venerable parent specifically named this master; surely there is no mistake. Steward, could you please take me to see Daoist Zhang?”

So the steward led Hu to the mountain gate and pointed to a Daoist: “There, that master sweeping the steps is Daoist Zhang.” The Daoist was about forty years old, plain in appearance, bowed his head and swept quietly. Hu approached with reverence and explained his purpose. Zhang said, “This poor Daoist cannot recite scriptures.” Hu said, “I see in you an extraordinary bearing; surely your cultivation is profound. My mother’s request must have its reason. Please, do not refuse.”

Hu then invited Daoist Zhang and a group of scripture readers and musicians to his home, arranged the altar, and prepared to perform the Doumu Refining rite. Zhang donned his ritual robes, yet he neither performed the steps of the Big Dipper nor summoned deities or generals. Hu’s heart grew uneasy. Before long, Zhang actually fell asleep upon the altar. Hu was displeased and went to awaken him, saying, “Master, master, I have sincerely invited you to transcend my mother, yet you sleep upon the altar? I must pay you and send you away.” Zhang did not mind and quietly left.

That very night, Hu dreamed his mother spoke to him: “Son, Daoist Zhang had just reached the gates of the Underworld when you called him back.” Only then did Hu realize that the Daoist’s sleep was a trance journey to the Underworld to escort her soul. Filled with regret, the next day he ascended Qionglong Mountain to apologize and offered a great sum to invite Zhang again for the transcendence.

This time Zhang again fell asleep. Hu resolved to let him rest fully. When the scripture readers finished their chanting, Zhang awoke and said, “Gentleman, you are blessed. Your noble mother has already escaped the suffering of hell. She also asked me to tell you that the debt of thirteen taels of silver owed by Li Dan’er of Li Family Village is forgiven.”

Hu was astonished and asked, “Master, you cannot recite scriptures or perform rites, how then could you enter the Underworld and see my mother?” Zhang replied, “Long ago, I cultivated the Inner Elixir. When the elixir matures, one’s yang spirit may emerge. When功德 is complete, one may ascend to the Golden Palace. The Underworld is the realm of yin governance. A Daoist well versed in the Way, recorded in the Jade Registers and bearing talismans, is guarded by officers and soldiers; ordinary lesser spirits dare not detain him. Naturally, passage through the Underworld and yin realms is unhindered.” Daoist Zhang’s given name was Sìbīn; he transcended in the nineteenth year of the Republic.
