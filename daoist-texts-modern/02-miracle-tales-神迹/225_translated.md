# The Story of Daoist Master Sun Xuanli of Wudang Mountain

Sun Xuanli was a native of Zhouzhi County in Shaanxi. In the eighties, he ordained at the Louguantai Temple in Zhouzhi County. Later, he dreamed of a divine being who enlightened him, and so he journeyed to Wudang Mountain to live in seclusion and cultivate. He lived simply and peacefully, embracing non-action and the natural way. Yet, the tourism bureau interfered repeatedly, driving him away, and Daoist Master Sun was forced to move deeper into the heart of Wudang.

One day, a wandering Daoist pilgrim climbing the mountain happened upon Master Sun’s humble thatched hut quite by chance. The sky was already dimming, and the wandering Daoist wished to stay overnight. Master Sun said, “You may.” He asked no further questions.

He then went to prepare the evening meal for the traveling Daoist. What he brought forth was a bowl of noodles. Sun said, “Fellow Daoist, the climb must have been arduous. Please, have a bowl of noodles.” The wandering Daoist expressed deep gratitude. Suddenly, a cockroach crawled onto the table, and the Daoist’s face showed clear disgust. Master Sun sharply commanded the cockroach, “Go, outside.” The cockroach promptly hopped away.

The wandering Daoist said, “I have learned the method of spell water, able to drive away cockroaches, snakes, and insects. I dare not return here again. In gratitude for your hospitality, I wish to repay you with this.” Master Sun replied, “This mountain is not mine alone, nor is Heaven mine alone. It belongs to all beings. Why claim this place exclusively, refusing other crawling creatures? I am no agent of the tourism bureau.”

The wandering Daoist said, “This place is damp and heavy with miasma. Staying long may bring illness. It would be better to move to Zixiao Palace.” Master Sun said, “Though damp, here there are fewer worldly entanglements and disputes. I can do my own work without others’ constraints. What is wrong with that? It grows late; rest early.”

Thus, Master Sun offered his own bed to the wandering Daoist, choosing to sleep on a bamboo cot himself. Suddenly, in the night, he heard the thunderous beating of drums and the long, clear call of a battle horn outside the window. Rising, he stepped out and saw a figure clad in golden armor, wielding an axe and halberd, standing upon the clouds. Immortal officers and soldiers thronged before and behind him. That general was none other than the Daoist who had sought lodging that evening. Master Sun hastily knelt and kowtowed.

The general said, “Sun Xuanli, I am Marshal Liu, patrolling this mountain by the command of the Dark Heavenly Highest Emperor, guarding Wudang and protecting those who cultivate here. Should anyone on this mountain make noise or cause disturbance, disrupting the pure practice, they shall be severely punished without mercy. You, with a clear heart, study the dao, shunning glory and wealth. You nurture simplicity and cultivate truth, showing compassion to all beings. I have already reported this to the Highest Emperor; you shall be listed among the ranks of immortals. Strive onward, strive onward.” With these words, he vanished in an instant. Master Sun bowed deeply in thanks.

Another twenty or thirty years passed. A Daoist at Yiquan Monastery on Mount Hua saw Master Sun again. His appearance was unchanged from the eighties, yet his complexion was even more radiant. Asked about the secret to longevity, Master Sun said, “The dao of long life lies nothing beyond nourishing the spirit within and accumulating merit and deeds without. Guard the form with the spirit, cherish the essence and nurture the qi. If one can turn inward to observe, reaching utmost emptiness and profound stillness, with breath flowing gently, the true numinous spirit gathers; when spirit and qi blend harmoniously, the dao naturally manifests.”

Master Sun stayed at Yiquan Monastery on Mount Hua for a day or two, then departed. Some say he was also seen at Taiqing Palace on Mount Laoshan and at Xuandu Temple on the Southern Peak, appearing and vanishing unpredictably, living freely as he pleased. It seems he has attained the way of the earthly immortal, wandering the Five Great Mountains, awaiting the hour of transcendence.
