# Zhang Rong’s Disrespect for the Dharma Talismans Brings Swift Retribution

In Suizhou, there lived a Daoist adept named Zhang Rong, who was wont to copy talismans and scriptures for others, charging exorbitant prices. Yet when he painted these sacred symbols and wrote these holy texts, he showed no reverence whatsoever. Sometimes he would carelessly toss them upon his bed; other times he would leave them scattered among his dining table’s cups and plates, perilously close to meat and fish. At times, he even slept atop the talismans themselves, utterly lacking any heart of respect.

Fellow practitioners, concerned for his conduct, admonished Zhang Rong gently. But he met their counsel with arrogant sophistry, twisting his reasons to justify his behavior. The more he collected in fees, the poorer his household became. His wife grew lonely and ill, suffering ailments year-round. More than twenty years passed, and he fell grievously ill, his sickness stubborn beyond cure. Each day at noon, he would leap from his bed to the floor, springing several feet high, only to fall gasping for breath, fainting in agony, crying out in wails of torment.

At midnight, the same dreadful scene would repeat. Twice daily, day and night, this continued for over half a year. His bones shattered, muscles ached fiercely, wounds opened anew, oozing pus and blood, emitting a foul stench most unnatural. He could not eat; when forced to swallow even a morsel, sharp pains would seize his belly and chest as if cut by a thousand blades.

A Daoist of Tiantai named Hanzhen heard townsfolk speak of Zhang Rong’s plight. He went to Zhang’s home and said: “The talismans of the Three Caverns are heavenly treasures of sacred script. You have never upheld or protected them; instead, you have repeatedly violated them wantonly. This is why you are now under divine trial. You must cleanse your heart, repent sincerely, and confess your offenses. Even if Heaven’s grace does not extend to your life, you may yet avoid torment after death. Such unbearable suffering—how can you endure it?”

Moved by Hanzhen’s words, Zhang Rong wept like rain, overwhelmed with sorrow. He cried aloud, vowing earnestly to beseech the Spirit Officer of the Protective Law and the divine generals and soldiers to pardon his past sins. He pledged to reform and preserve his life, never again to treat the scriptures and talismans with disdain. Then, howling in lamentation, he beat his chest and implored the gods, his voice carrying beyond the walls.

After a while, his heart grew calm. That night, he dreamed of more than three hundred golden-armored divine kings standing solemnly in the void. One sent a messenger to say: “Because you have defiled the Spirit Officer, profaned and belittled the true Dharma, you have undergone a total of two years of trial. Since you now recognize your errors and sins, we will pardon you for the time being. For the remainder of your more than eight years of life, you must never again trade in talismans so recklessly. Should you commit this offense anew, you shall be condemned to eternal damnation in the underworld.”

From that moment, the trials ceased, and his illness gradually healed, returning to normal within half a month. Zhang Rong recorded this entire affair in full upon his wall, earnestly urging fellow practitioners to take heed.

The *Jade Emperor’s Repentance* says: “May those who read with unclean mouths and touch with defiled hands have their sins erased.” To recite scriptures with an unclean mouth, or to touch sacred texts and treasures with defiled hands, is a grievous offense indeed. Swift repentance is required to seek forgiveness. Should one persist in error, knowingly and deliberately, the Three Officials’ divine trials will be unrelenting, without the slightest leniency.
