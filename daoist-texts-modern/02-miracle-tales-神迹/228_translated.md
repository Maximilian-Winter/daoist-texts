# The Story of a Daoist Who Changed His Path

There was a Daoist friend, well-versed in the myriad methods of the Clear and Subtle Numinous Treasure tradition, skilled in the various techniques of the Earth Official’s investigations, adept at curing illnesses and expelling malevolent spirits, and quite efficacious in his deeds. He was a renowned ritual judge in the southern region of Fujian. A few days ago, he sent me a message saying: “The burden of expelling demons and killing karma is too heavy. Next year, I plan to have a child and no longer intend to continue this work.”

Although it is said that Daoist ritual judges, who expel demons and heal the sick, bear the merit of protecting the people, after all, they are opposing certain ghosts and spirits. When one’s fortune is good, or when one strictly observes precepts, the ghosts and spirits have no way to retaliate. But once fortune wanes, or if one breaks precepts, allowing spirits to find a gap, then ultimately there is no escape.

For example, we know well the story of Master Sa. He razed altars and destroyed temples, even burning down the temple of the Spirit Official Wang. Wang Spirit Official went to lodge a complaint with the Jade Emperor, who bestowed upon him a golden whip and said, “Follow Master Sa closely. If he commits any breach of precepts, strike him dead with this golden whip.” The time limit was twelve years. Secretly following Master Sa for twelve years, Wang Spirit Official found that Master Sa cultivated daily without a single breach of precepts. Deeply impressed, he bowed in reverence, took refuge, vowed to protect the Daoist teachings, and obey Master Sa’s commands. Thus it is said, “Observing faults for twelve years, receiving the Jade Emperor’s mandate; accumulating merits in countless ways, sworn to assist the Patriarch.” Yet many of our Daoist friends may not be able to reach the heights of Master Sa.

“Heaven has the virtue of cherishing life,” and this applies also to malevolent spirits and resentful ghosts. As the saying goes, “Enemies should be resolved, not created.” Usually, when confronted with such situations, one speaks kindly to persuade, resolves grudges, explains grievances, then performs transcendence rituals, burning gold ingots to send the resentful spirits away. One would never start by striking and killing. Among the Eight Great Sacred Incantations, there is a line: “Slay demons and eradicate evil, kill ten thousand ghosts.” When we recite it normally, we say instead, “Slay demons and eradicate evil, save ten thousand souls,” striving to transform rather than confront.

I have a Daoist friend who is skilled in thunder methods. When he first entered the Way, he was especially devout, reciting the Jade Pivot Scripture daily. Later, a household with a haunting invited this friend to help. Upon arrival, he set up an altar, loudly struck the wooden fish, and began chanting the Jade Pivot Treasure Scripture and the Mysterious Scripture of the Northern True Martial, spoken by the Primordial Heavenly Lord. He intended to invite the Ancestral Lord of Thunder and the Great Emperor Perfected Martial to seize and remove the malevolent spirits. During the chanting, things were fine, but once he left, the disturbances worsened. Not only was the haunting not cured, but the next day he fell off his bicycle. When he told me about this, I said, “What you did was wrong. You cannot just expel demons at once. You must first understand the cause—why the haunting is happening in their home. If possible, send them away gently; only if that fails should you take stronger measures.” So I prepared some paper money, incense, candles, and offerings of water and rice. In the evening, at the northeast outside the house, I lit incense and candles, burned the paper money, poured water and rice onto the ground, spoke kindly, and sent the spirits away. The northeast is the Gen Palace, the ghost gate. Usually, one sends spirits off at this direction. The morning yang energy is too strong; the best time is evening, when yin and yang meet. I have used this method many times for similar cases, and it works quite well.

The *Internal Methods of Supreme Ultimate Sacrifice and Refinement* says: “Long ago, there was a man who devoted his life solely to sacrifice and refinement, and was quite responsive. He refused to practice other methods to control ghosts and spirits. When urged, he said: ‘Do not teach me to harbor murderous intent to harm ghosts and spirits, thus destroying my heart of compassion in sacrifice and refinement.’ His words were quite profound. Ghosts and spirits pity those with compassionate hearts and cannot bear to see them harmed, let alone be controlled. Those who practice the methods inevitably oppose ghosts and spirits; opposing them must breed ill will. The great virtue of Heaven and Earth is the original heart of the Supreme Lord who cherishes life. If one can preserve one’s essence and spirit intact within oneself, one will have great virtue and great merit toward all things. With but a single word, one can transform ghosts and spirits, summon clear skies and rain—what need is there to perform all these methods? Just as in the most perfect eras, the Dao transforms people, never using methods to control them.” It is said there was once a Daoist who devoted his life solely to sacrifice and refinement, and was very efficacious. He refused to practice methods to control ghosts and spirits. When some urged him to learn the techniques of establishing judgments, summoning, and expelling demons to cure illness, this friend said, “Do not teach me to harbor murderous intent toward ghosts and spirits, destroying my heart of compassion.” Practicing methods inevitably opposes ghosts and spirits, breeding ill will. Better to devote oneself to sacrifice and refinement, which bring great merit to all things. Naturally, ghosts and spirits will respect and obey, and one can pray for clear skies and rain. What need is there for methods to be efficacious?
