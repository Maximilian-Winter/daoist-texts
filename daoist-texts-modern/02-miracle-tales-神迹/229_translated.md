# The Tale of the Daoist Liu Chengde of Taizhou Reciting Scriptures with a Mundane Mouth

Liu Chengde was a Daoist of Jiaojiang in Taizhou. Among the common folk of the Taizhou and Wenzhou regions, it was their fond custom to hold Daoist ritual assemblies. Taizhou alone boasted over two thousand Daoist temples, and typically each temple had but one or two Daoists, who mostly made their living by reciting scriptures. At the dawn of the twenty-first century, Daoists earned about two hundred coins a day for their chanting, along with a pack of cigarettes. Now, it is said, the fee has risen to three hundred.

Daoist Liu Chengde was a master of high功 (merit and skill), and he busied himself moving from one ritual to the next across Taizhou. His voice was clear and strong, and everyone liked having him lead the chanting. Today he might be in Wenling, tomorrow in Jiaojiang, and the day after in Huangyan. The travel wearied him, and so he could not always be fastidious. Inevitably, sometimes he recited with a mundane mouth—荤口—uttering words with a worldly tone, or with unclean hands touching the sacred texts. When pressed for time, he would skip parts of the scriptures, reciting one section, omitting another, then jumping to a different passage.

At times, elder practitioners would admonish him: “Dao Friend Liu, you must not recite scriptures like this. To touch with unclean hands, to speak with a mundane mouth, these are sins. If the scriptures are not fully recited, after death you will have to go to the Eastern Peak to make up the missed chanting.” But Daoist Liu paid no heed. He said, “Eastern Peak? Where is this Eastern Peak? Who has ever seen it? Besides, every day we repent before the Jade Emperor’s penitential ceremony. Does not the Jade Emperor’s penitence say: ‘May the sins of unclean hands and mundane mouths be extinguished’? We repent daily. Moreover, we do not eat meat; we eat seafood, and seafood is not meat. There is no harm. The Patriarch is supremely compassionate and merciful; he will not hold it against us.”

One year, Liu Chengde went to the Taiqing Palace in Huzhou to perform a ritual of deliverance for the departed. When he ascended the altar, his crown slipped off. Fellow Daoists took this as an ill omen and urged him not to proceed. But Liu said, “It is nothing; I will just fix it and continue.” Then, as he summoned the wandering souls, a sudden gust of chilling wind swept through. Startled, Liu fell from the platform of the Dharma King, his face ashen with a bluish pallor, muttering repeatedly, “Guilty, guilty.” From that day on, he was ill for many months and never dared to conduct another ritual assembly.

When asked what he had seen, Liu refused to speak. After many months, he confided to his fellow Daoists: “When I summoned the wandering souls, I saw countless lonely spirits and malevolent ghosts gathering. But because I had not fasted strictly and could not transform my food essence, I was unable to deliver them. So they chased me and beat me. The City God was present then as well, but because my body was heavy with defilement, the divine spirits would not come near. From now on, when you recite scriptures, you must follow the Patriarch’s rules exactly.”
