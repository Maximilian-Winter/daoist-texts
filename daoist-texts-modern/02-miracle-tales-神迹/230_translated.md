# The Story of the Departed Seeking Paper Money

Du Xin, a native of Nanjing in Jiangsu, was born into a modestly comfortable family. After graduating, she entered the workforce. Later, she resigned to continue her studies. Du Xin grew up at her grandmother’s house; her grandmother passed away at over ninety years of age. Even now, Du Xin sometimes dreams of her departed grandmother. Each year, during the Zhongyuan Festival and the Cold Clothes Festival, she burns paper money and bundles for the elder.

On the Zhongyuan Festival of the Year of the Rooster, following custom, Du Xin stood at a street corner to burn paper money for her grandmother. It was evening when suddenly two little boys appeared by the roadside, staring intently at her. One asked, “Auntie, why are you burning paper money here like this?” One of the boys ran forward, stepping right into the circle drawn for the burning. Du Xin paid no mind to the child but prayed silently, “Earth Duke, ancestors, please forgive—children do not understand.” Soon after, the children’s mother came and took them away, saying, “This is not something you should see.”

After the two boys left, suddenly a boy of about ten or so appeared across the street, sitting on the curb, watching her burn the paper. After a while, he asked, “Auntie, did someone in your family die?” Du Xin felt a strange unease but ignored him and continued burning the paper. At that moment, the boy’s mother hurried over and took him away. When Du Xin finished burning the paper and was about to leave, a little girl emerged from the roadside grass and asked, “Auntie, why are you burning paper here?” Startled, Du Xin quickly ran home but did not tell her family about the incident.

Du Xin’s mother worked at an office, and Du Xin brought her lunch every day. On the noon of the sixteenth day of the seventh month, Du Xin went as usual to deliver her mother’s meal. Her mother asked, “Do you still remember your cousin?” Du Xin replied, “Of course I do. We were quite close.” Usually, cousins seldom kept in touch, but this cousin had been close to her and had even once said he would entrust her with managing his company in Nanjing. Her mother continued, “He died in a car accident during the first month.” Upon hearing this, Du Xin dropped the lunchbox to the ground, tears streaming down her face.

The Iron-Crowned Daoist said: The ancients spoke of omens; the Plum Blossom Numerology teaches of external correspondences. Upon reflection, those children encountered on the Zhongyuan night were in fact reminders—someone in her family had passed away, and she must also burn paper money for him. The affairs of the world are truly beyond explanation; science cannot fathom them. The boundary between humans and ghosts is blurred; though unseen, ghosts and spirits are as if above and below, as if to the left and right.

The departed, when seeking aid for their transcendence or for paper money offerings, usually find the one certain to help them. If the person receiving the dream does not promptly assist the deceased, other misfortunes may befall. In daily life, we must always hold a heart of reverence. Moreover, Ms. Du said she had dreamed several times of her cousin, with a clear impression—yet he had no head. Generally, those who die in car accidents have incomplete forms. To transcend such souls, one must cultivate the Heavenly Medicine dao-field, restoring their forms fully; only then can they be reborn and guided to the Southern Palace.
