# Liu Manwen of Guangdong Recites the Scripture of Resolving Grievances Across Three Lifetimes

Liu Manwen, a native of Shunde in Guangdong, was born into a family fractured early by her parents’ separation. She attended a local vocational high school, where, in the bloom of youth, she fell in love with a classmate and soon found herself with child. Overcome by fear and confusion, she and her boyfriend conferred and chose to undergo a painless abortion. Her heart was heavy with remorse, though friends and confidantes offered gentle words of comfort.

The following year, fate repeated its summons: Liu Manwen became pregnant again. With her economic foundation still fragile, she was forced once more to seek the path of termination.

After graduation, Liu Manwen parted ways with her boyfriend and entered the workforce. Yet, a shadow lingered over her spirit—her energy waned, her moods unsettled. Years passed, and fortune eluded her; month by month, her income fell short of her needs, leaving her grasping at the edges of subsistence.

One day, Liu Manwen journeyed with friends to the sacred Dragon and Tiger Mountain. There, amidst the solemn Daoist sanctuary, a sense of familiarity stirred within her—as if returning to an ancient home. A yearning to take refuge arose in her heart. At the venerable Celestial Master’s abode, she pledged herself to the supreme Dao. Following the teachings of the Daoist master, she devoted herself to earnest recitation of scriptures, reverent homage to the exalted perfected ones, and heartfelt repentance to cleanse her karmic debts. Gradually, her spirit lifted, and her fortunes began to turn.

Yet love remained elusive. Several suitors came and went, and each time marriage seemed near, inexplicable quarrels erupted, shattering the bond. Liu Manwen’s heart grew heavy with sorrow. Seeking answers, she invited a Daoist master versed in the art of the Ren Dun Six Jia divination to inquire into her fate. The master counted on his fingers and declared:

“Two little children follow you, restless in their moods, crying ceaselessly. Have you, by chance, undergone abortions in the past?”

Liu Manwen recounted her story in full.

The master said, “The great virtue of Heaven and Earth is called life. Among the sins of the world, the crime of killing is heaviest. You have harmed two unborn lives; their infant spirits bear grievances and refuse to reincarnate. The underworld records this in the black ledger, causing your fortune to falter. Yet, thanks to your devotion these past years—honoring the Three Treasures and repenting your sins—the black ledger has removed your name. Still, the grudges linger, with no place to be resolved. The infant spirits, filled with resentment, cannot be reborn as humans, nor receive offerings of incense and paper. Thus, they wander as restless souls beside their birth parents. How pitiful, how grievous!”

Hearing this, Liu Manwen could not hold back her tears. She implored the master, beseeching him to reveal the compassionate gateway to liberation. The master replied:

“In ancient times, the Heavenly Venerable of Great Unity, Savior from Suffering, proclaimed the *Most High Scripture of Resolving Grievances Across Three Lifetimes*. This single scroll unfolds the supreme bridge to untie grudges and transcend infant spirits. Upon returning home, recite this scripture three times daily, and your enemies will naturally dissolve. Remember well: sin arises from the heart, and likewise, it is extinguished by the heart.”

Liu Manwen bowed deeply, expressing her gratitude, and withdrew with reverence. Each day she lit lamps and chanted the scripture. After forty-nine days, she dreamed of a young boy with twin topknots, holding a banner inscribed with the words “Heavenly Venerable of Great Unity, Savior from Suffering.” Two infants, radiant and wondrous in appearance, came forward to bid farewell. One infant spoke:

“Once, through the calamity of being slain, our hearts harbored resentment. Now, by the grace of the Great Dao and the vast power of your scripture practice, grievances are resolved, and the realms of ghosts and humans part. From this day forth, we shall be reborn. Please, dear mother, take good care of yourself.”

With these words, they followed the splendid banner, gradually fading into the distance. Liu Manwen awoke, her heart heavy with sorrow.

The *Most High Scripture of Resolving Grievances Across Three Lifetimes* declares:

> “This scripture does not only untie the grudges of one person. If all of you sincerely recite it a hundred times, the grudges of an entire nation will be dissolved.”

This scripture’s merit is vast and profound. It can not only resolve the grudges of a single soul but also transform the grievances of all people. Those who hold and recite this scripture will see their karmic debts from three lifetimes vanish utterly. If one copies a volume for another, the entire family and kin will share in blessings and wisdom. Should one fund the printing and dissemination of this scripture throughout the world, thus spreading the grace of the Four Favors and the Three Pardons under the universal shelter of the Dao, the merit and power accrued are beyond measure.

Since birth, each of us, whether knowingly or unknowingly, commits various errors. Inevitably, grudges are formed. Though these may not equal the sin of abortion and killing, those harmed still harbor resentment in their hearts. Such karmic forces accompany us through many lifetimes, leading to cycles of retribution and suffering. Therefore, we must diligently seek repentance, widely cultivate good affinities, and avoid entangling ourselves in grudges.

The Heavenly Venerable proclaims:

> “Sentient beings often bind grudges,  
> Grudges deep and hard to untie.  
> One day’s grudge forms,  
> Three lifetimes’ retribution does not cease.  
> Now I transmit this wondrous scripture,  
> To dissolve all karmic grudges.  
> Hear and recite with devoted heart,  
> Your enemies shall vanish naturally.”

I take refuge in the Azure Profound Nine Yang Highest Emperor,  
And the Great Unity Savior from Suffering Heavenly Venerable!
