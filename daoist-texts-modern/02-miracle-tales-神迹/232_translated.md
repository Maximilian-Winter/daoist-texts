# The Efficacy of the Azure Dragon Lord of Huzhou

In Huzhou (present-day Huzhou City, Zhejiang), within the Kaoyuan Temple, there stands a venerable statue of the Azure Dragon Lord, crafted with exquisite artistry that ranks unsurpassed throughout the southern lands. The people all say: this was fashioned during the Tang dynasty, in the era of Emperor Ming of Tang, by the finest artisans of the realm. It is profoundly efficacious. Whether scholar or commoner, none who come with suffering and petition fail to find relief.

Before the Kaoyuan Temple, facing the main thoroughfare, there grew a locust tree, its trunk already over one foot in diameter, yet its branches and limbs had withered dry. The magistrate of Wucheng County commanded that this dead tree be cut down. That very night, he dreamt that the Azure Dragon Lord spoke to him: “This is the locust tree before my courtyard. Now, to let it die and be reborn anew, only a little more than a month is needed, and soon it will flourish with leaves and branches.” The magistrate pondered, “How could the Lord convey this to me in such a manner?” Yet he thought it merely coincidence. The next day, he ordered the workers to continue chopping the tree. Each time an axe fell upon the wood, the magistrate’s whole body was seized with pain. Suddenly, beneath the Azure Dragon Lord’s seat, a great serpent emerged, crawling forth. The workers were seized with terror, dropping their tools and fleeing in all directions.

After some time, a festering sore appeared on the magistrate’s body, throbbing with unbearable pain day and night. Only then did he realize it was the Azure Dragon Lord’s punishment for his disregard and for loving the locust tree. Though ointments were applied to the sore, the pain would not cease. Later, when crushed scallion paste was spread upon the place where the locust tree had been cut, the sore began to ease. More than a year passed, and the locust tree’s wounds healed; likewise, the magistrate’s sore was cured. The tree’s branches and leaves, once dead, were reborn, growing even more lush and verdant than before. From that time forth, the Azure Dragon Lord’s incense offerings flourished, morning and evening without end.
