# The Response to Merit of Layman Jiang from Hubei Who Donated Funds to Print Scriptures

Jiang Yuhan, a native of Huangshi in Hubei, once went to a daoist temple to burn incense. While there, he chatted with the temple’s daoist priest. The priest said, “I see a dark qi hovering between your brows; tomorrow, I fear you will suffer a blood calamity.” Jiang Yuhan replied, “Then I shall stay home tomorrow and not step outside.”

The next day, Jiang Yuhan called the priest and said, “Master, it’s all over—I have a relative who passed away, and I must go out today to attend the funeral. What am I to do? Can you help me find a way to resolve this?”

The priest was rather busy at the time and said, “Among all methods, burning incense is foremost. Of all merits, printing scriptures is the most weighty. Why don’t you donate money to print scriptures?” So Jiang Yuhan quickly transferred one hundred yuan to the priest to assist with printing the scriptures, and the priest registered his name.

On his return, Jiang Yuhan reported to the priest at the temple, saying, “Around two or three in the afternoon, I felt especially drowsy and saw double images. I was driving then and felt as if someone was pulling me insistently, urging me to stay alert. Shortly after, the car ahead of me had an accident. I was just one centimeter away from crashing into it. That night, when I drove home alone, nothing happened.”

The Iron-Crowned Daoist said: “The Treatise on Response and Retribution says: ‘When one intends to do good, though the good deed is not yet done, auspicious spirits follow; when one intends to do evil, though the evil deed is not yet done, ominous spirits follow.’ Printing scriptures and creating images to spread the daoist teachings is a merit of profound depth. The Three Officials examine and record virtuous deeds. Those with great merit can transform calamities and obtain blessings in this life, even to the point of becoming immortals and attaining the Dao. Layman Jiang Yuhan, according to fate, should have suffered a blood calamity. Yet by promptly donating one hundred yuan to print the daoist scriptures, he was still able to avert disaster. How much more then should we, through regularly accumulating virtue and practicing kindness, respectfully offering good resources, printing scriptures that circulate far and wide, and reverently upholding the Three Treasures, accrue even greater merit? Surely, we will be under the protection of the Patriarchs and receive great blessings.”
