# The Tragic End of One Who Secretly Learned the Methods and Deceived Others

In the year two thousand and nineteen, a devout believer came forward claiming he had been possessed by an evil spirit. Truly, such cases arise too often each year. Only after conversing with him did it become clear: this believer had been gathering ritual manuals from all corners, practicing the secret talismans on paper by himself, yet unable to properly safeguard them once drawn. Once, in a dream, he received a warning—yet it was only that single time, and he paid it no heed. In truth, the original heart to cultivate the dao and revere the dao is common to all. Yet, when one reaches a certain point, many gradually lose their way.

This believer was no different. After mastering the drawing of many talismans and some daoist methods, he donned the ritual robes and began to proclaim himself a high adept. In fact, we have seen many such people. When adding friends, he was still an ordinary devout lay follower; even in conversation, his understanding of Daoist teachings was but half-formed. Yet a year later, he had become the head of some sect or was already skilled in divining characters, casting lots, feng shui, and replenishing the storehouse of energies. Some suddenly transformed into grand masters of a family lineage or a particular sect.

This believer, having no true transmission, wrote a talisman of exorcism according to the ritual manual and gave it to the afflicted family to use. The result was not only ineffectual, but the evil spirit instead came upon him. While discussing matters face to face, the evil spirit suddenly appeared and bit his head. At that moment, the believer felt a pounding headache and dizziness. After the spirit was driven away, the conversation had to end, and the believer was told to rest first.

Later, an investigation revealed his guilt was grave. He was instructed to repent through prostrations and confession. Alas, he continued to act as he pleased. At the end of two thousand and nineteen, he died suddenly and violently.

Whether it be daoist methods or secret talismans, one must possess proper transmission and solemnly pledge to Heaven and Earth, dividing the rings and splitting the seals, presenting petitions to the Three Officials, and undergoing a series of complex rites before one may formally learn. How can one without true transmission command armies or direct thunder officials? To obtain daoist methods outside the orthodox path is itself improper, and divine aid is hard to come by. When a daoist practices secret talismans, the heart, incantation, and drawing must be united—and the talisman must be drawn upon water’s surface, not merely on paper. One must respect the secret talisman; do not think a talisman is just a piece of paper. It is a token of authority, an official document. Within it lies secret incantations, numinous qi, spiritual radiance, and a point of true qi that sustains all. One must honor the secret talisman and never treat it lightly.
