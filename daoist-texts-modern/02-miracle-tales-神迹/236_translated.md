# The Village Gentry and Temple Sacristan Conspire in Deceit, Encounter the Manifestation of Lord Guan

The Patriarch Bai Yuchan declared: “The Han Celestial Master once said: ‘Those who nowadays study the dharma do not root themselves in the Dao, nor trace back to the heart. People appoint themselves as masters, families as schools, treating the opening of light and spirit-possession as marvels, and chasing shadows and dreams as wonders. The generals they summon number in the hundreds and thousands; the offices they fill with laws are staffed by perfected beings and envoys. Some mix the secret arts of shamans with orthodox dharma; some descend ghostly immortals’ brushes and claim secret transmissions. When questioned, they answer according to ritual; when distinguished, they insist on true bestowal. Ha! Such false masters err greatly—not the fault of the masses. One blind leads many, confusing them with confusion. Alas!’”

The Patriarch Zhang Sanfeng of Wudang said: “The planchette is a borrowed art. Since ancient times, perfected beings have all rejected it as the practice of charlatan magicians. The immortals keep far from it—how much more so when it is profaned? They follow the planchette and toy with it, recklessly wielding talismans and incantations, thereby inviting ghosts into their homes! This is how sorcerers deceive the foolish, and why the immortals detest sorcerers. In my life, I have never liked people seeking divination by drawing lots or supporting the spirit’s writing. I only wish that everyone cultivates virtue and constantly introspects. I have heard of those who set up planchettes to seek geomancy or divine the heart of Heaven—these are all the lingering customs of charlatans. The true gods of the upper realms see through their deceit; none escape Heaven’s punishment!’”

There was a certain village where, year after year, sacrifices were held at the Temple of Lord Guan. Lives were taken in slaughter, wasting the people’s hard-earned wealth, making the already poor village even more destitute. Some even starved to death! One year, the villagers erected a stage before the Temple of Lord Guan, preparing to perform a grand opera. Naturally, the opera was all about Lord Guan. As the performance unfolded, suddenly a villager leapt several meters onto the stage, seized Lord Guan’s great blade, and began to wield it. His dance was fierce and mighty, like a whirling wind wheel.

After a brief while, he propped the blade and closed his eyes slightly, his face full of wrath. With a mighty roar he declared: “I am the Demon-Subduing Guan Yu! You common folk, deceived and coerced by the village gentry and the temple’s sacrificial beasts, emptying your homes to offer sacrifices— I know of these deeds. I now manifest in person. The gentry’s threats and the collusion of the temple sacristan, greedy for money, wasting the people’s lifeblood—within five days they shall perish. You must hold kindness in your hearts and revere the Great Dao; then your blessings and virtue will be boundless. There is no need for such offerings. I became a god through loyalty and righteousness; you yourselves should embody loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, and righteousness—that is the true grand offering. I depart now!!!”

Having spoken, he collapsed. Soon after, the villager revived. When asked, he said: “I only saw a great Lord Guan suddenly appear on the stage, his face red as a date, wielding a great blade. Then my body lost control; I could see Lord Guan the Holy Emperor beside me all along, but I could not control my speech or movements.”

Thereafter, the man became the temple sacristan, but Lord Guan the Holy Emperor never came again. Still, the incense and offerings never ceased. The village gentry and the former temple sacristan naturally died suddenly seven days later; others were bitten by venomous snakes and died without cure.
