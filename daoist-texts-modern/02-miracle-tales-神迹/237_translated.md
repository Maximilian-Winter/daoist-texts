# The Tragic Plight of a Devout Elder

This venerable elder now lies with his entire body ravaged by festering sores, yet despite all treatments and exhaustive examinations, no cause can be found. Because of the relentless ulcerations, he cannot bear to wear any clothing; even the slightest touch upon his flesh brings unbearable pain. Beneath him, many layers of quilts are spread to soften the hardness of the bedboard, sparing his body further torment. Such is his present state that one might say he is “living worse than dead.” 

His family, desperate, have taken to seeking healers far and wide—just as the *Jade Pivot Precious Scripture* foretells, where medicine proves powerless. Folk remedies have been tried, learned physicians consulted, great immortals sought, and monks and Daoist priests alike have been summoned. Yet no cause is uncovered, no remedy found.

At last, a Daoist master discerned the truth: this affliction is caused by a vengeful spirit holding the decree of debt collection from the Great Emperor of the Eastern Peak. Because of a grievous injustice, and the severity of its consequence, even the Underworld extended this elder’s lifespan by two and a half years, yet bestowed no blessing in return. Thus, it is fated that in the twilight years of life, he must endure suffering and torment. Though his body remains in the realm of the living, his soul and spirit are already subjected to the tortures of knife mountains and sword forests in the nether courts—hence the festering decay of his flesh.

Such a case is rare indeed. Yet it attests that even the Underworld keeps pace with the times: to suffer in the living world, dragging down one’s family in misery, is far more dreadful than death itself—it is as if the living have entered the prison of the dead.

Our human life is born and extinguished by the Mansion of the Dipper, which governs birth and death; thereafter, the Five Dippers allot the measure of blessings, fortune, and lifespan. Finally, one’s “file” is handed over to the Underworld’s Yin Tribunal, forming the ledger of life and death. The affairs of life and death in the mortal realm are thus under the jurisdiction of the Underworld’s Yin Court, while matters of blessing and calamity fall under the Heavenly Court. Therefore, it is clear: to have a lifespan without blessings is a most grievous plight. One must strive to perform good deeds, at least preserving a heart of kindness.
