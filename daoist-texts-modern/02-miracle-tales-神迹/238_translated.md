# A Young Man’s Attachment to Talismans Leads to His Summons in the Netherworld

During the Republican era, when famine spread across the land like a relentless tide, there lived a young man surnamed Zeng. Idle and penniless, with no grain to fill his belly, he sought refuge on a mountain where a venerable Daoist master dwelt. Hoping to scrape together a living, he became the master’s disciple, intending to learn some talismanic arts—those mysterious symbols and incantations that might earn him a livelihood.

At first, the old master taught him nothing, leaving the young man restless and impatient in his heart.

One day, after the midday meal, Zeng entered his master’s chamber to pay respects. There, on the table, lay a collection of yellow talismans stamped with the Three Treasures seal. Upon them were inscribed the words “Expel Evil, Guard the Home.” Thinking, *This must be my master’s talisman to ward off evil and protect the house,* he waited until the master’s attention wandered, then slyly pocketed several of the talismans.

Back in the alchemical room, Zeng carefully examined the talismans, tracing their forms in the air with his fingers. He practiced drawing them again and again until the symbols he inscribed matched his master’s exactly.

One day, eager to test the talisman’s power, he ventured down the mountain to meet friends. By chance, he heard of a household troubled by spirits. Boldly, he volunteered to cleanse the place and drive out the ghosts.

Arriving at the haunted home, Zeng produced the talisman copied from his master, muttered a few random incantations, then set the talisman aflame and scattered its ashes in a bowl of water to purify the space. From that day forward, the household knew peace.

News of Zeng’s ghost-banishing exploits spread swiftly. He frequently descended the mountain to draw talismans for others, even carving his own Three Treasures seal and stamping his talismans just like his master’s. He cut a figure of a seasoned Daoist adept.

But good fortune was fleeting. When the supply of his master’s talismans ran out, his tricks gradually lost their power.

He began to feel unwell, though he could not fathom why.

One night, as he slept, he dreamed himself transported to a dark and dreadful realm. Looking up, he saw the King of the Underworld seated upon his throne, flanked on either side by ghostly guards and the fearsome Ox-Head and Horse-Face demons. Zeng asked the King why he had been summoned to the netherworld.

The King of the Underworld laughed heartily and said, “In this year of famine, when the people suffer and starve, you still greedily charge exorbitant fees to line your pockets. Your greed outweighs your kindness. Moreover, you carved seals without your master’s permission and recklessly used incantations—how could ghosts fear you? You are idle and profit-driven, neglecting the cultivation of virtue. Even with your master’s true teachings, your talismans cannot be efficacious. Today, we take you as a warning: if you continue your misdeeds, you will not escape punishment. Since you have already taken refuge in the Dao, you ought to cultivate virtue first. Hurry back and repent your past.”

Zeng awoke with a start, drenched in sweat, gasping for breath.

At dawn the next day, he dragged his weary body up the mountain. Upon arriving at the monastery, he found his master waiting in the Hall of the Three Purities.

Seeing Zeng, the master said, “Kneel quickly and sincerely repent before the Patriarch, confessing your misdeeds. Otherwise, you shall not be spared. If you err again, I will expel you from the lineage, severing our master-disciple bond.”

Zeng was struck with terror. “Master, how do you know of my deeds?”

The master replied, “Once you enter the profound gate, how could your master not know your affairs?”

With that, the master commanded Zeng to kneel in incense smoke for five hours to complete his penance.

From then on, Zeng turned from his former ways, cultivating sincerity and kindness, becoming a true practitioner of the Way.

Whether Daoist talismans prove efficacious depends not only on the lineage of transmission and the master’s spiritual cultivation and dao conduct, but also fundamentally on the master’s virtue.

Long dealings with ghosts and spirits bring harm. First, one may incur too many grudges, inviting vengeance from restless souls; frequent contact with ghosts also damages the body. Second, if one’s cultivation is insufficient, or if charlatans handle ghostly matters with trickery, they not only bear karmic consequences but also risk retaliation from spirits. Caution is paramount.

Once, a Daoist brother who often helped others expel demons was besieged by fierce ghosts and died in a car accident. Another, who barely scratched the surface of the arts and had not yet completed apprenticeship, went to a graveyard to perform rites for a benefactor, only to fall ill with a strange malady and lie bedridden for over three months. Yet another, who had not formally taken refuge or apprenticed, purchased ritual implements like the whisk and peachwood sword, then set up altars, wrote talismans, performed rites, and consecrations—only to suffer repeated calamities. Such cases abound.

Those of high virtue command the respect of ghosts and spirits, who listen attentively and obey their orders. Otherwise, spirits whisper mockingly, deriding the pretender’s posturing and increasing his own guilt.

Daoists rely chiefly on admonition to dispel resentment and malice, helping spirits relinquish grudges and hatred. The saying “Enemies should be resolved, not multiplied” captures this truth. Of course, all things in the world follow cause and effect: if one does not summon misfortune, it will not come; if one does not invite calamity, it will not arrive. Among all methods, cultivating virtue is paramount: “When the Dao is lofty, dragons and tigers submit; when virtue is weighty, ghosts and spirits revere.” Otherwise, to invite the scorn of ghosts and spirits and bring disaster upon oneself is truly not worth the price.
