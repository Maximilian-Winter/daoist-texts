# The Household’s Resentful Qi Nourishes Spirits and Monsters, Bewitching the People

The Record of Dragon Qing Daoist’s Subjugation of Demons: If you do not believe it, simply regard it as a tale to be heard. Indeed, it is difficult to accept or trust, but if you do believe, then calm your heart and be a faithful believer!

The story unfolds in the year two thousand and twenty-one, within the home of a devout believer in Suzhou, where I personally witnessed this eerie event. It began thus: this family bears the surname Sun and has dwelt here for many years. All was well, until one day, Mr. Sun’s father (hereafter called Sun Father) struck Mr. Sun’s wife. Though she was a gentle Wu Yue woman, with soft Wu dialect and a tender nature, when faced with such a thing, who would yield? Thus, a fierce fight broke out.

After the battle, Mr. Sun’s beloved gathered her belongings and returned to her maternal home. Not long after, a call came from their child, saying they too wished to return home. When the child arrived, Sun Father flew into a rage and demanded to know where they had been. The child replied that they had just finished work. Sun Father scolded, “Such a young age, yet you lie! Clearly you skipped work to play games at home, now you pretend to come back just now from outside.” Unable to endure this, the child requested to live with their mother at the grandmother’s house. Sensing something amiss, Mr. Sun verified with the child’s workplace and learned that the child had indeed not skipped work.

Mr. Sun began to pay close attention to these matters, and what followed was far more terrifying, leaving him dumbfounded and stricken with fear.

One day, Mr. Sun was at home, using WeChat to plead for his wife’s forgiveness, promising to handle the situation properly. At that moment, a shadow suddenly passed by the door. What was terrifying was that this figure was none other than Mr. Sun himself, who was lying in bed. Immediately, Sun Father began to curse again and rushed into Mr. Sun’s room, demanding why he had thrown water on him. In that instant, Mr. Sun understood.

There was something that had taken the form of a family member, enraging the ill-tempered Sun Father and stirring disharmony in the household. Though incredible to recount, what I saw could not be mistaken. Later, one day, Sun Father went out to buy vegetables. Upon returning, he heard Mr. Sun’s voice at the door, scolding about not watching the pot properly. Puzzled, Sun Father opened the door and saw another version of himself in the kitchen, while Mr. Sun was washing pots. Witnessing this, both Sun Father and Mr. Sun were filled with dread. Yet the Sun Father in the kitchen merely smiled. Terrified, they fled from the house.

Now Sun Father understood. Because of this, the elderly Sun Father even stayed several days in the hospital. There was no way around it; young people could hardly bear such visions, let alone an irritable old man.

Sun Father and Mr. Sun went to apologize at Mr. Sun’s wife’s home, but she could not accept such an incredible explanation. Though the elders expressed their views, Sun Father and Mr. Sun declared they would never return home. Thus, Mr. Sun’s family rented another house elsewhere, yet they could not escape the torment of this entity. Family members successively saw another self, even the transformations of other household members. Seeing no way out, they sought a solution.

The Sun family mobilized many people, even inviting individuals from Southeast Asia and lamas from the Tibetan region, yet no resolution was found. There was some relief, but only relief, never complete resolution. They used all available methods, and the family converted to various religions—when Buddhism failed, they turned to Daoism; when Daoism failed, they underwent baptism; when baptism failed, they sought empowerment rituals.

During our casual conversation, Mr. Sun’s wife asked him, “Daoists, may I offer you tea?”

Daoist Long Qing and Daoist Long Yue exchanged glances. Long Yue said, “Better you keep quiet than anything else.”

Hearing this, Mr. Sun’s “wife” bowed her head and withdrew. Mr. Sun understood immediately and called out her name. At that moment, the real wife came out of the bedroom holding tea bags, while the “wife” entered the kitchen.

In truth, such transformations are easy to discern. To our eyes, the illusory beings bear “fuzzy edges.” Like when one uses Photoshop to place an image on a backdrop, but the feathering of the edges is too heavy. The real and the false differ greatly—one glance suffices to tell.

Thus, first a celestial net of heaven and earth was cast to enclose the house. Finally, an exchange was made with this entity.

It turned out this being was a mountain spirit newly awakened, born from an animal that died unjustly beside a tree. The tree absorbed the animal’s essence and blood, gaining some numinous potency. The dead animal had some cultivation, but fate decreed it die wrongfully in the wild, its blood nourishing the grass and trees. The essence of that vegetation was dug up by Sun Father, and then began to disturb the household. Because Sun Father had always been tyrannical at home, the family harbored resentful qi, which also fed certain beings. But when resentful qi is consumed excessively, whether demon, ghost, spirit, or numen, it tends toward darkness.

In such cases, Daoists have the authority to directly bind or slay the entity, but under ghostly law, unless the offense is grave, leniency is preferred. This being was sent bound to Dongyue for judgment. The verdict was that it disturbed the people, but thankfully caused no death. It would likely be punished with decades or even a century of confinement, or ordered to guard a certain place, forbidden to roam.

In our daily lives, only we can hold our tongues, refraining from uttering the most hurtful words to those who care for us—our beloved and kin. Guard your heart, do not let anger harm your liver; do not sow discord to breed disharmony; do not foster excessive resentful qi. Therefore, remember: harmony in the family brings prosperity to all affairs. Only with a peaceful household can misfortune turn to blessing, and more good fortune be invited in. Otherwise, one misfortune will follow another in endless succession.
