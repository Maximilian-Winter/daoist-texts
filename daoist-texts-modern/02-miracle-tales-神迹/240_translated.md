# The Hell Mirror Reveals the Good and Evil of Past Karma

In the *Most High Compassionate Daoist Altar for Disaster Elimination and Nine Netherworld Repentance*, there is a detailed listing of the thirty-seven hells. Besides the thirty-six hells spread across the east, west, south, and north, there is a singular hell at the center. Within this central prison hangs a mirror, which, when cast upon the sinner’s body, reveals their hidden differences and distinctions—“vanishing and manifesting in turn, seen clearly within the mirror.” This mirror is none other than the “Karma Mirror.”

The Karma Mirror, which later folk traditions transformed into the “Sin Mirror,” is a mirror that exists within the underworld. The *Underworld Ten Kings’ Liberation Ritual* clearly states that the fifth palace among the ten courts of the netherworld is governed by the Most Sacred Radiant Spirit True Lord (that is, Yama, the King of Hell). Within this palace stands the “Karma Mirror,” where the deceased, upon reaching the “fifth and seventh” day of their postmortem reckoning, are brought to suffer punishment. The Karma Mirror reveals the goodness or evil of their past karma, and retribution follows accordingly.

According to the Qing dynasty scholar Qian Yong’s *Miscellaneous Talks from the Foot Garden*, on the twenty-fourth day of the eighth month in the thirteenth year of the Yongzheng reign, a scholar surnamed Chen from Loumen was seized by the underworld authorities due to crimes committed across three lifetimes. During interrogation, he confronted his secret lover, a woman, in the underworld. One claimed the woman acted on her own accord; the other insisted it was a case of entrapment and seduction. Both sides stuck to their words, deadlocked without resolution. Finally, with no other recourse, a ghostly official was ordered to use the “Sin Mirror” to reveal the truth. The mirror showed that indeed the woman had willingly thrown herself into his embrace, and the verdict was rendered accordingly.

When the deceased arrive in the underworld to face judgment, it is much like a criminal entering the police station. Fearful of harsh punishment, many try to evade responsibility, resorting to deceit and lies, hoping to lessen or even wash away their guilt. But at this moment, standing before the Karma Mirror, one’s entire life of sins is fully reflected—murder, theft, lust, falsehood, and all manner of offenses appear plainly, without concealment. As the saying goes, “The heart knows well, the shame is unbearable,” leaving one speechless and unable to argue. Thus, no matter how much one wishes to flee, escape is impossible.

Yet the Karma Mirror can only reveal the surface of deeds; it cannot penetrate the depths of the mind. Ji Xiaolan’s *Notes from the Thatched Cottage of Reading the Subtle* once remarked: “What the Karma Mirror reflects is only the good and evil of one’s actions. But the subtle corners of the heart, the myriad deceptions of feelings, the arising and ceasing without constancy, the hidden and unfathomable depths—these leave no trace for the mirror to glimpse. Often, outwardly a qilin or phoenix, inwardly treading the ghostly realms, concealed and unformed, the Karma Mirror cannot reveal.”

This means the Karma Mirror shows only the moral quality of actions, but not the thousandfold emotions or the truth and falsehood of feelings within the heart. Therefore, besides the Karma Mirror, there is mention of the concept of a “Heart Mirror.” The two mirrors’ functions are distinguished: the “Karma Mirror” is used to examine the “true villain,” while the “Heart Mirror” discerns the “false gentleman.”

Though no earlier texts explicitly state this, in essence, the term “Heart Mirror” is an extension of the concept of the “Karma Mirror.” Here, the so-called “Heart Mirror,” though specifically used to examine the human heart, still belongs to the broader category of the “Karma Mirror.”

Furthermore, *If You May Listen* offers a detailed explanation of the principle by which the “Karma Mirror” projects the truth: When a person commits an act, an imprint of that deed is left in their heart’s memory. The Karma Mirror projects this image accordingly. But if a person acts without intention, unaware themselves and bearing no imprint in their heart, even the Karma Mirror will see nothing. Thus, the underworld’s judgment distinguishes good and evil based on “with intention” or “without intention.” Though this is the author’s own understanding of the Karma Mirror’s projecting principle, it also reflects the contemporary people’s conception of the Karma Mirror.

As the saying goes, “Three feet above your head are gods watching.” In the unseen realms, the Karma Mirror exists; whether one does good or evil, none can withstand its gaze. One must never harbor a careless heart. Humans may be deceived, but Heaven cannot be deceived.
