# Selling Rice in Life, Secretly Accumulating Yin Merit, and Transcending Death to Become an Immortal

In the region of Jiangyin by the Guangling River, there lived a man named Li Jue, whose family had dwelled in the city for generations, making a livelihood by selling rice. Yet Li Jue’s character was upright and simple, unlike ordinary folk. At the age of fifteen, he followed his father in the rice trade. Whenever his father had to go out on business, he entrusted Li Jue to manage the buying and selling. When customers came to purchase rice, Li Jue would take out a measuring container and let them measure it themselves. Regardless of whether the price of rice was high or low, he earned only two cash profit per measure, using this modest gain to support his parents. Over the years, this practice continued, yet their family wealth grew quite abundant.

His father found this strange and asked him the reason. Li Jue explained the true nature of his business dealings. His father sighed and said, “Among our peers, none fail to use two sets of measuring containers—one lighter for selling out, one heavier for buying in—to thicken their profits. Though the government inspects measures twice a year, they cannot forbid such trickery. I have long felt this was wrong, so I only use one set of measures for both buying and selling. Over time, I believe this is fair and just. Now you even let the buyer measure the rice themselves; my own conduct pales in comparison. Yet still, our wealth remains plentiful—surely the deities are aiding us.” After his parents passed away, Li Jue lived beyond eighty years, continuing his humble trade.

Meanwhile, there was a magistrate, also named Li Jue, appointed as the Military Governor of Huainan. Because the rice seller Li Jue shared the same name as the governor, he changed his name to Li Kuan. Several months after Governor Li Jue took office, he gave alms to Daoist practitioners and held a grand fasting assembly. On the second night, he dreamed that he entered a cavernous grotto. The scenery was that of early spring—blossoms in full bloom, phoenixes soaring, white cranes dancing, auspicious clouds and radiant mists filling the heavens, and earthly pavilions connected in a continuous expanse. Li Jue wandered alone within this grotto and saw a stone wall, smooth and lustrous, inlaid with large golden characters listing names. Among them was “Li Jue,” the characters over two feet tall. Upon seeing this, Li Jue was overjoyed, thinking to himself: “I was born in a politically enlightened era, have held many exalted offices, even rising to prime minister—surely my virtue has benefited the world. Now my name is inscribed in this grotto; I must have become an immortal!” The more he thought, the happier he became.

Just as he was caught up in his delight, two celestial youths darted out from either side of the stone wall. Li Jue hurriedly asked, “Where is this place?” The youths replied, “This is the Huayang Cavern Heaven. But the names on the stone wall are not those of the magistrate.” Li Jue was startled and quickly asked, “If it is not me, this Li Jue, then who is he and where is he from?” The youths answered, “He is a resident of Jiangyin under the jurisdiction of the magistrate.”

When Li Jue awoke, the dream remained vividly clear, and he marveled at its strangeness. He sought out Daoists, but none knew of a local Li Jue; he summoned officials from Jiangyin to inquire, but still no one recognized the name. He then ordered a search throughout the city, stirring up a commotion for several days, seeking anyone sharing his name. Only after questioning residents in the alleys did they learn that Li Kuan’s original name was Li Jue. They sent a carriage to bring Li Kuan into the government compound, where he was housed in a pure chamber. The governor bathed and fasted, then respectfully greeted Li Kuan as “Dao Brother.” The entire household honored Li Kuan, performing formal bows and worship at dawn and dusk.

Li Kuan was always serene in temperament, his appearance noble and dignified, his beard over a foot long, pure white and endearing. When he was sixty, a Daoist had taught him the fetal breathing technique, and for a long time he no longer ate grains. Li Jue’s reverence for him grew even deeper. After more than a month, Li Jue inquired, “Dao Brother, what dao arts have you attained? What immortal medicines do you refine and take? I once dreamed of entering a grotto where your name was carved on a stone wall. Guided by the celestial youths, I sought you out and brought you here to the government hall, to honor you as my master. Please teach me the immortal arts.” Li Kuan hurriedly declined, saying he truly did not understand such dao arts or alchemical medicines. Li Jue bowed again and asked earnestly, “Then what do you cultivate?”

Kuan replied plainly, “I am but a simple man who does not know what to cultivate; I merely make a living selling rice.” After repeated questioning, Li Jue sighed, “Your way is indeed difficult for ordinary people to follow. The yin merit you accumulate surpasses that of others. In this world, those who gain wealth and honor often invite harm; those in poverty, if they sincerely help the people, their names will be recorded in the immortal registers. You use your conduct to admonish the mundane world!”

Later, Li Kuan lived beyond one hundred years, moving with agility and enjoying extraordinary health. One day, he suddenly told his descendants, “I have dwelled in this world many years. Though I nourish my qi and no longer eat food, I am of little benefit to you.” That very night, he passed away. Three days after his grand funeral, the coffin suddenly split open. The onlookers saw that his clothes and sash were still intact, but the body was gone—like a cicada shedding its shell. Truly, he had transcended death and become an immortal.
