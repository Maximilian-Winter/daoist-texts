# Reckless Speech and Retribution (A Series of Words That Pierce Like Arrows)

In ancient China, when people married, they would perform ceremonies to worship Heaven and Earth, their parents, and then each other as husband and wife. The worship of Heaven and Earth served to call upon these cosmic witnesses as guarantors of the marriage, swearing lifelong responsibility to one another. The divine powers of Heaven and Earth bore witness and supervised their conduct; should they break their vows, they would face punishment from the numinous realms.

If you observe carefully, you might notice that the vows people make in life come due at certain appointed times and places. Countless facts tell us that promises, once spoken, inevitably come to fulfillment.

Thus, elders in the countryside speak with great caution and observe many taboos. They avoid saying what should not be said, perhaps out of fear that careless words might bring retribution. Whether the oath is heartfelt or merely casual, the cosmic dharma regards the act of swearing as a contract signed in blood; once sworn, it must be honored.

The ancients held language and writing in profound reverence, treating words as creations of the divine. They saw speech as a mysterious power that governs life itself.

Why do prophetic words come true? The principles of the Yijing (Book of Changes) offer an explanation. When one speaks recklessly, these harmful words and the disasters that later befall are a kind of negative energy field. According to the Yijing’s law of “like energy seeks like, like sound responds in kind,” our utterances draw our destiny toward these adverse outcomes. In other words, we actively tune the frequency of our life’s fate to match that of calamity. It can be said that disasters are summoned by ourselves.

For example: some boast that they have not caught a cold for a long time, only to fall ill within days; others claim their driving skills are impeccable, never having a scratch, then soon after suffer a car accident; some say they almost never lose things, yet soon misplace their phone... These are scenes familiar to us or our friends.

When we say, “I never...” or “I haven’t... for a long time,” we place ourselves in perilous ground.

As the Confucian classic *Shangshu* says: “Pride invites loss; humility receives benefit.”

## Reckless Speech: Disrespecting Spirits Brings the Ghostly Maze

Several years ago, a client of mine recounted a personal experience. Their company held an annual meeting at a resort near the Thirteen Tombs outside Beijing, lasting three days. On the second afternoon, he and two friends suddenly had to return to the city for some errands. After finishing, they headed back; by then, dusk was near.

The three chatted idly in the car when one suddenly sighed, “Who knows how many beautiful palace maids lie buried beneath this ground, so young, sacrificed as tomb attendants—what a pity! If only we could bring a few up to keep us company!”

They all laughed, spinning fantasies and daydreams. But laughter faded; their faces grew pale with fear. After driving for some time, they found themselves inexplicably back where they started. A stretch that should have taken ten minutes to pass was now a ghostly loop, endlessly circling.

Anxiety mounting, they sped forward. From dusk into night, they could not escape, always returning to the same spot. Only then did they realize they had fallen into a “ghostly maze.”

Awakened, they stopped by the roadside, stepped out, lit three incense sticks as offerings, and facing the Thirteen Tombs, kowtowed while apologizing. After this ritual, they returned to the car and, within five minutes, were safely back at the resort.

## Reckless Speech: Car Crash and Death

A friend once told me a story: he knew a couple who often quarreled fiercely. One day, for some unknown reason, they fought bitterly, smashing many things at home. The wife shouted at her husband, “Why don’t you just die quickly! If you die, this home will be peaceful!”

The husband stamped his foot, gritted his teeth, and retorted fiercely, “Fine! Fine! If I really die someday, let’s see if you regret it!”

These were angry words between husband and wife, and a few days later, they reconciled. Yet, unexpectedly, the husband soon died in a strange car accident—everyone else in the car was unharmed; only he lost his life.

## Reckless Speech: I Will Donate My Organs

On the fifth day of the ninth month in the year two thousand fourteen, a senior student named Lu Quanwei at Guiyang Normal University suddenly declared before family and friends: “If I meet with misfortune, please donate all my organs to those in need after I die.”

No one imagined that within a month, this would come true. Lu Quanwei met with a car accident on his way home and passed away.

## Reckless Speech: The Poison Tongue Brings Oral Cancer and Disfigurement

When I worked at a project department, there was a driver named Zhao Wei. Trusted by the leadership, he grew somewhat arrogant and spoke with biting sarcasm, mocking anyone he could. The modern phrase “poison tongue” seemed tailor-made for him.

Yet he was unusually warm toward me, often trying to get close, hinting at his admiration for my uncle—who was then chairman of our parent company.

One morning, Zhao drove his boss to the project office and greeted me: “Xiao Zhang, congratulations are in order.” I was puzzled. “What’s the good news at your home?” He said, “Don’t you know? Your uncle was invited for ‘tea’ by the higher-ups.” I was new to society and didn’t understand that “tea” meant interrogation; I thought my uncle was being promoted and felt happy.

That morning, my mother received two calls. I then learned my uncle and aunt were under investigation. At lunch, Zhao opened the topic, gossiping about my uncle’s corruption of over a hundred million yuan, dozens of mistresses, and his wild lifestyle, while giving my mother only a hundred yuan pocket money monthly. All baseless rumors and hearsay. He even asked me in front of others, “Xiao Zhang, better take leave and find the money. Maybe your uncle hid it at your place. After all these years in power, he probably doesn’t even know how much he’s stolen.”

I was too angry to speak. Though my uncle and aunt were indeed under investigation, and rightly so, I could not refute Zhao. The warmth he showed me yesterday vanished today, replaced by public humiliation. I found him terrifying. That was my first encounter with his venomous tongue.

Years later, I unexpectedly heard Zhao was diagnosed with oral cancer, luckily caught early. Though treated, half his face was removed, disfigured. When we met again, he was silent and seldom spoke.

## Reckless Speech: The Death of a Colleague Twenty Years Ago

Yesterday, on a business trip to company headquarters, I went to the archives. While searching, I found a familiar name in the “Deceased Employees” records—Wang Qing. I was surprised. He retired only in two thousand seventeen and died soon after.

Wang Qing was my colleague twenty years ago. I had just graduated as a lab technician. He was about forty then, the boss’s driver, and we young ones called him Brother Qing. He was fair and plump, his hair slicked back, walking with an imposing air. The boss was small and thin. Customers often mistook Brother Qing for the boss, bypassing the real boss to shake his hand.

When I first met him, Brother Qing boasted of his background, saying even the boss had to respect him. I respected him as a senior. One day, he called me to his room for something. After I entered, he closed the door and said, “Watch this.” I thought it was a secret company file and sat attentively. But the disc was an adult film, and I fled in shock. Afterward, he was cold to me and occasionally warned me in veiled words.

Brother Qing was not only unscrupulous but also cruel in speech. One day, our lab had a discarded rubber sheet ready to throw away. A worker said he needed one, so I gave it to him. Brother Qing saw this and, though he knew it was trash, accused me of stealing company property to curry favor, reported me to the boss, and spread bad rumors. I dared not confront him and let it be.

After two years, I left and never saw Brother Qing again. Others often mentioned how disliked he was—mocking, ridiculing, and delighting in others’ misfortune. Unlike those who insult for gain, he did it for pleasure, earning a notorious reputation.

Yesterday, I asked an old colleague, Tan, about his death. Though I once disliked him, time had softened my feelings. Learning of his passing saddened me.

Tan said, “Don’t mention it, such a tragedy! Tongue cancer, several surgeries...” Before he spoke, I guessed it was related to his sharp tongue—and indeed it was.

## Reckless Speech: A Death Oath Over Five Jin of Pork

In the late nineteen eighties, a classmate working as a secretary at a rural ironworks told me a story that remains vivid in my memory. Before the Mid-Autumn Festival, workers were given collective leave to return home. Five jin of pork were bought for the gatekeeper who stayed behind to celebrate.

Both the cook and gatekeeper were present when the pork was delivered.

Soon, the pork vanished. The gatekeeper claimed the cook took it; the cook denied it. They argued fiercely.

Onlookers were confused. To prove their innocence, at noon, the two stood in the factory courtyard, burned incense, and swore deadly oaths: the gatekeeper vowed, “If I falsely accuse, may I die on the fifteenth day of the eighth month.” The cook vowed, “If I took the pork, may I die on the fifteenth day of the eighth month.”

The crowd laughed it off and dispersed.

On Mid-Autumn Day, the cook died. Those who doubted the power of oaths called it coincidence; those who believed saw retribution.

## Reckless Speech: The Keyboard Warrior

At the end of the Ming dynasty, in Suzhou, there was a scholar named Qin, clever and talented, especially skilled in poetry. His mind was quick, and he could compose verses instantly. Yet he was arrogant and caustic, speaking harshly. Seeing others’ faults, he wrote poems attacking them; hearing of ridiculous deeds, he turned them into biting lyrics.

A neighbor’s scandalous affair became the subject of ten bawdy poems in the tune of “Yellow Oriole.” The verses spread far and wide. For this, Qin was beaten multiple times in public, even stripped and flogged. Another time, his satirical songs led to false accusations and legal troubles.

His ingrained habits were hard to break. In old age, he contracted malaria. After recovery, he went mad, often eating his own feces and cutting his tongue with a knife. His family, helpless, locked him in an empty room. Unable to find a knife, he bit off pieces of his tongue and spat blood. The room filled with a foul stench that sickened all. Yet Qin was unaware.

One day, through a window crack, he saw a wood-splitting axe. Breaking the window, he seized the axe and ended his own life.
