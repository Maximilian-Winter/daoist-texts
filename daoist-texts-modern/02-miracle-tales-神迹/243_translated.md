# The Blindness of Granny Qi: A Tale of Retribution and Family Discord

Granny Qi, known throughout the village as Granny Qi, was not born blind. Her blindness came late in life—and in a most peculiar way. One day in her twilight years, her eyes began to blur; the haze thickened day by day until, at last, her vision vanished entirely, and she was left in total darkness.

At that time, her eldest son carried her from place to place seeking healers. The doctors were baffled—no illness preceded this affliction, no cause could be found. They offered no conclusions. Remedies were tried in vain, from humble folk prescriptions to prayers at great temples, yet no cure nor sign of relief appeared. In the end, Granny Qi passed away with sightless eyes.

When the villagers spoke of Granny Qi’s blindness, they did not pity but rather scorned her. They recalled how she had tormented her eldest daughter-in-law in youth and said, “All beings reap their due; behold, this is the retribution for bullying a meek daughter-in-law.”

In her youth, Granny Qi was a formidable figure. Though she bore four sons and together they owned a modest three-room house, Granny Qi lived with carefree ease.

Her favorite saying was, “Children and grandchildren have their own fortunes; I will not be a beast of burden for them.” Every day she lived a life envied by others—playing cards with gusto, laughing when she won, and cursing the heavens and earth when she lost. No one knew whom she cursed; the words came out of nowhere, as if to vent some invisible anger, until the storm within subsided and her voice fell silent.

Her eldest son, Da Ming, had just returned from military service. With some money earned in the army, he bought two donkeys and spent his days leading them around, hauling carts for villagers.

Her second son, Er Ming, apprenticed in a neighboring village, living and learning a craft in another’s home, seldom returning. The third and fourth sons worked far away, only coming home during the hottest days of summer and the New Year.

Together, the four sons shared a tiled house. Their father had passed early, and in the countryside, it was difficult to find wives for poor families. Not only was their home impoverished, but Granny Qi’s reputation was poor as well. The only thing she could boast was that her four sons were diligent, hardworking, and unafraid of toil—unlike their mother, who was fond of ease and indulgence.

Da Ming was nearly thirty, handsome and steady, yet poverty barred him from marriage. Once, while hauling a cart in a neighboring town, a young woman took notice of him. She was six years his junior, fair-skinned and kind-hearted, though born with poor eyesight. She had to lean close to see clearly—glasses were not common then, so she simply adjusted as best she could. Her family did not mind and never provided spectacles.

Da Ming liked her too. Young hearts found harmony easily, and the match was made simply and without fuss. The young woman did not mind Da Ming’s poverty; they wed quietly.

One would think Granny Qi should have rejoiced—her son had found a gentle and virtuous bride, and the couple seemed affectionate. But Granny Qi’s joy lasted no more than three days. After that, she began to pick at her daughter-in-law’s faults, finding fault left and right. She declared the bride unworthy of her son, mocking her habit of leaning close to see. The way the daughter-in-law squinted and peered was unbearable to Granny Qi’s eyes.

She began to call her daughter-in-law “the blind one” behind her back, then openly, boldly. “Blind one, go tend the vegetables!” “Blind one, fetch the firewood!” she barked.

The daughter-in-law hated this name. It was shouted inside the house and echoed outside, and the young woman could not bear it. First, it was Granny Qi calling her blind; soon, the village scoundrels joined in, shouting the name as if it were a game.

Da Ming never called her that. He respected his wife and when she asked him to tell his mother to stop, he shrugged, “She’s old; let her be. Don’t take it to heart.”

One month into their marriage, the daughter-in-law became pregnant. Her mother advised her to keep the pregnancy secret for the first three months, lest the child be endangered. The daughter-in-law obeyed, carrying on with household and fieldwork as usual, careful not to strain herself, and heeding her mother’s counsel to let Da Ming do the heavy labor.

Granny Qi either did not know of the pregnancy or pretended not to. At any rate, she called her daughter-in-law lazy. Da Ming toiled all day hauling carts, his feet blistered and calloused, yet Granny Qi would not let the daughter-in-law rest, demanding she fetch water and firewood. With a scowl, she accused the daughter-in-law of being thoughtless, uncaring for her husband’s suffering, and selfishly delicate. Worst of all, she added, “No matter how delicate you are, you’re still a blind one.”

Harsh words chilled the daughter-in-law’s heart like a cold wind in early summer. She was gentle and never retorted, swallowing her tears and grievances. She dared not tell Da Ming, fearing he would be troubled or that his mother would retaliate when he was away. So she endured silently.

One day, when the water jar was nearly empty, Granny Qi returned from cards to find her daughter-in-law lying on the bed, sewing shoes. The sight of her leaning close to her work enraged Granny Qi, who thought the daughter-in-law half-disabled. Having lost money at cards, Granny Qi had no outlet for her anger and assumed the daughter-in-law was feigning laziness under the guise of shoemaking. She ordered her to fetch water.

The daughter-in-law hesitated, signaling that Da Ming would fetch it when he returned. This silent defiance infuriated Granny Qi, who stood before the daughter-in-law’s room, cursing and accusing her of laziness and mistreatment of her husband.

The young woman, weak and overwhelmed, wept silently but obeyed, fetching water. Even after filling the jar, Granny Qi’s anger was not appeased; she commanded her to fill every basin and pot in the house.

The well was nearly two li away. Exhausted and panting, the daughter-in-law’s condition was unknown to others, who only urged her to rest, not to stop fetching water. Her frail body could not endure Granny Qi’s harsh commands; burdened and weary, she collapsed—and the child was lost.

Da Ming was heartbroken and blamed Granny Qi for overworking his wife. But Granny Qi sneered, “When I bore your four sons, I did all the work. Carrying water was light work. Delicate people like her are different—they even killed my grandchild.”

Only Da Ming knew the truth: since he was a child, his mother’s days were spent at cards, impatient even with cooking. He learned to cook for the family by age six. His father, like a beast of burden, labored from dawn to dusk in silence, dying of exhaustion in the fields.

With the miscarriage, the daughter-in-law was too weak to rise and remained bedridden. Cooking fell to Granny Qi, who, used to being waited on, now entered the kitchen herself. The day after the miscarriage, the daughter-in-law’s mother came, furious and heartbroken. She demanded her daughter rest in bed for several days, forbidding heavy work for at least a month.

Perhaps sensing her fault, Granny Qi softened, even bringing food to her daughter-in-law, who was surprised by this rare kindness.

But a wolf remains a wolf, even in sheep’s clothing. Seeing the daughter-in-law’s poor eyesight, Granny Qi served her only leftovers and cold dishes, and, in anger, spat into the bowl before setting it down—an insult meant to defy the daughter-in-law’s mother’s orders. To Granny Qi, the mother-in-law’s kindness was a threat, a challenge to her authority.

Unbeknownst to Granny Qi, her card-playing friend Granny Chen saw this. Granny Chen was shocked—what great hatred must there be to spit into another’s bowl? Thinking she must be mistaken, she watched closely and later confronted Granny Qi under the pretense of inviting her to play cards. The truth left Granny Chen aghast.

No matter how much one dislikes a daughter-in-law, such cruelty—deliberate spitting in food—was unheard of.

Granny Chen wasted no time. By dawn, she spread the tale through the village like a fairy scattering blossoms, all while keeping Granny Qi unaware.

The day after the miscarriage, the daughter-in-law’s mother brought several jin of meat, two chickens, and one hundred eggs to care for her daughter. Da Ming told Granny Qi to prepare these well to nourish his wife. The meat was cooked and served at dinner for the whole family; the chickens, Granny Qi claimed, were stolen by weasels—Da Ming doubted but was heartbroken. Villagers whispered that Granny Qi had secretly slaughtered the chickens for herself. As for the eggs, ninety of the hundred were given away, ostensibly as gifts to visitors, but the card-playing friends knew they were pawned to cover gambling debts.

Da Ming was none the wiser. His wife kept silent, enduring all to spare him trouble.

Village gossip ran rampant, and many urged Granny Qi to treat her daughter-in-law kindly. Granny Qi ignored them, stubborn as ever. The meddling women threatened to tell the daughter-in-law’s mother, hoping she would intervene.

Coincidentally, when the daughter-in-law’s mother came again ten days later, the gossipmongers seized the chance to unload their grievances. The mother was furious. Seeing her daughter wasted away, she confronted Granny Qi, who blustered and stammered in denial. The mother saw through her and, in anger, took her daughter home. Da Ming was away; Granny Qi made no effort to stop them, even saying, “Good riddance. I’m done caring for young people. They must manage themselves.”

When Da Ming returned, Granny Qi exaggerated the story, telling him the mother-in-law had come to quarrel and forcibly taken her daughter, accusing Granny Qi of neglect. She warned him not to spoil his wife, saying, “If there’s trouble, she goes home. Don’t mind it. She left as she came.”

Da Ming was displeased. He had seen Granny Qi serve meat to his wife yet now found his mother so difficult. He wanted to visit his wife but, angered and influenced by his mother, he stayed away, blaming his wife for making a fuss before her mother.

Thus, the cold war dragged on for a year. Without a marriage certificate, the union dissolved. Later, the daughter-in-law married into a kind family she knew well. Da Ming remained single, living only with Granny Qi.

The other sons married too, but their wives were formidable. Especially the second daughter-in-law, who often clashed with Granny Qi. Hearing of Granny Qi’s treatment of the first daughter-in-law, she was fearless, retorting sharply, “You drove away the blind daughter-in-law, and your son is single. Now you want to chase me away? Will your second son remain single too?”

This silenced Granny Qi. The second daughter-in-law’s boldness opened the way; the third and fourth daughters-in-law followed suit. The sons dared not speak, nor defend their mother, knowing their wives were fierce but devoted to the family, unlike their mother’s lazy ways.

Granny Qi, seeing she could not confront these daughters-in-law, sometimes confided to villagers that she missed the first daughter-in-law. “Only before her did I have the authority of a mother-in-law; these others don’t tame themselves like she did.” The villagers listened silently, thinking, “If only she had treated the first daughter-in-law well, Da Ming would not be single now.”

Later, seeking peace and fewer insults, Granny Qi moved with Da Ming to the village commune. Then word spread that Granny Qi was bedridden and, mysteriously, blind.

People cannot act too cruelly. As the saying goes, “Man acts, Heaven watches.” Do not torment the meek, lest all evil return upon oneself.
