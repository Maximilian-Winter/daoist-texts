# The Departed Grandfather’s Love for His Descendants

A story personally experienced before last year’s New Year. In my family’s backyard, on a flower terrace against the wall, stood a small-leaf tree as thick as a bowl’s mouth. Its shade spread wide and vague, a shimmering patch of shadow. One ordinary day, my father went to the backyard to play with the dog. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw something moving on the eaves behind the tree’s shade. Looking closely, it was a snake as thick as a muscular man’s arm. Normally, aside from lost pet snakes, there should be no snake so thick in the neighborhood. Its pattern did not resemble the usual Burmese python or golden python, those popular pet snakes.

My father was indeed frightened. He found a wooden stick and tried to push the snake off the eaves. But the snake was as solid as a rock, and it seemed intent on climbing down the fragile branches of the small-leaf tree. This truly scared my father. Hastily, he pulled out the hose used for washing the courtyard, pressurized the water, and sprayed the snake with all his might. The snake was stubborn—it fell down but climbed back up again. Yet, by then, water fees had become, in my father’s eyes, a matter of life and death. After spraying for a long time, the snake finally slithered away along the eaves.

Then something strange happened. Since that day, my father could not sleep at night, nor rest during the day. His body was fine, but dark circles deepened under his eyes, and his temper grew increasingly irritable. At first, he was afraid to tell us, fearing to frighten us. Later, when he did tell us, we were not scared but rather intrigued. He then said that before this, the snake had appeared on the small path to the left of the backyard. It lay curled and still, and when it saw my father, it showed no sign of fear but instead crawled toward him. My father hurriedly called the dog and hid inside the house. Only after the snake disappeared did he go back to the backyard.

At that moment, I suddenly remembered that last year during Qingming, my father had not gone to pay respects to grandfather. So I suggested to him, “Let’s visit grandfather during the New Year. Perhaps after seeing him, you will be able to sleep.”

Interestingly, they did go to pay respects. Normally, it takes fifteen minutes to find the place. That day, they searched for two hours—from two in the afternoon until nearly five—and still could not find it. The grass was taller than a person, and every path was tried but to no avail. When they returned, grandmother scolded them: “You go every year, yet you can’t find the place? If you can’t find it, just come back. Lingering so long is frightening.”

I laughed at my father and said, “That snake must have been grandfather. He missed us and came back to check on us. You don’t treat him well—no good food or drink, no burning of paper money—and you even sprayed him with the hose for half an hour. Grandfather was angry and didn’t want to pay attention to you.” My father only smiled. Yet after returning from the mountain, his insomnia eased.

That Qingming, my uncle and I went to see grandfather. It took only fifteen minutes. We paid respects for a long time, spoke many words to grandfather, saying, “Father has not been involved in these matters; please don’t blame him. He still misses you very much. Last time, when he couldn’t find you, he was discouraged for a long while,” and so forth. The next day, my father’s gout was mostly cured; by the third day, it was nearly gone.

Perhaps this is how connection never fades, and love never disappears.
