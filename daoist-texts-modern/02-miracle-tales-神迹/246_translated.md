# The Legendary Child-Stealing Crone

Many know of the Child-Giving Lady, but do you know that there is also a Child-Stealing Crone? Let me tell you a story from my childhood:

I was born on the eve before the New Year, on the twenty-ninth day of the twelfth lunar month. My mother said that winter was especially bitter that year.

A few days later, my mother saw an old crone enter the bedroom, saying she wished to lift me up and take a look. It was during the Spring Festival, and my mother did not recognize this crone. She thought perhaps she was a relative from my father’s side and said, “The weather is cold, and the child is sleeping. Wait until she wakes, then you may look.” But the crone insisted on seeing me at once. Perhaps my mother felt some subtle warning in her heart, for she refused. The crone’s attempt failed, and as she left, she glared fiercely at my mother and said, “In a few days, I shall return again.”

My mother paid no heed. Yet from that day forth, I began to sleep by day and cry through the night. The whole family took turns holding me, soothing my wails.

Another week passed, and the crone returned. Without a word, she leapt onto the bed where I lay sleeping. My mother said she felt a pair of icy hands slip beneath the covers, swiftly lifting me from the bed. My mother sprang forward, tackling the crone and snatching me back, shouting loudly for my grandmother. The crone, thwarted, had no choice but to release me and turn away.

My mother told my grandmother what had happened. Furious, my grandmother cursed the crone in the bedroom, then hung a piece of peach wood on the door. After that, the crone never came again.

Though she did not succeed in stealing me away, my health remained frail throughout childhood—like Lin Daiyu, I took medicine daily, my body nothing but skin and bones. When the doctor gave injections, he had to pinch my skin just to find a place to pierce.

My mother said that at one point, the doctors said I might not survive, urging the family to give up treatment. Yet gradually, I grew stronger. To live was itself a miracle.

Therefore, I am deeply grateful—grateful to my parents, grateful for all that I have been given!
