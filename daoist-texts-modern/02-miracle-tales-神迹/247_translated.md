# Grandma, Advanced in Years, Bewitched and Deceived by One Hundred Yuan

Watching everyone share their own encounters with the numinous and uncanny, ha… I too have experienced one such event, so let me tell it as well. Though born in the rural lands of Jiangnan, and as a child loving the hot summer nights spent in the courtyard listening to the elders recount tales of demons, ghosts, gods, fox spirits, and strange beings, deep down I always thought these were but stories. I was a materialist at heart, not much given to believing in ghosts or spirits.

Five summers ago, my ninety-three-year-old grandmother suddenly fell ill.

This illness came in a strange way. Though it is true that in summer appetites wane, the old lady’s spirit was still good. The week before she fell ill, I had returned from Hangzhou to see her. We sat together in the courtyard chatting. She said, “Child, these days I keep feeling your grandfather has come back to see me. At night, I feel as if he is lying right beside me. Perhaps your grandfather feels lonely and wants me to go keep him company.”

At the time, I comforted her, saying, “Surely your grandfather is protecting you. He has been gone over thirty years. Back then, my mother and uncle were still young; you bore the family alone and raised the children to adulthood. Now that I have grown up, this is your time to enjoy blessings. You have suffered so much, and your grandfather surely wishes for you to enjoy happiness.”

Grandma chuckled softly and said, “Yes, yes, I am enjoying blessings.”

A few days later, I returned to Hangzhou. Before I even entered the gate of the compound, I received a call from my mother: “Your grandmother is gravely ill. She is babbling nonsense, no fever, blood pressure normal. The hospital sent us home…”

This was uncanny.

I turned around and rushed back.

When I saw her again, she lay there. At times she said the rain outside was too heavy and she did not want to go. At times she said her shoes were worn through and she needed to buy new ones. At times she said the pit was too deep and she could not jump over it…

Thus she drifted in a daze for two or three days. Several elders from the village, who were close to Grandma, came to persuade my mother and uncle: “Her soul has been taken away; it is time to prepare for her passing.”

My mother and aunts still clung to a thread of hope, believing Grandma would recover.

Sure enough, after four or five days of this hazy state, Grandma got better. The first thing she asked upon waking and opening her eyes was, “Oh, why are so many of you gathered around me? I just took a long journey. It was so tiring. Hurry and pour me some water!” Then she called my uncle’s name to bring her water.

Grandma gulped down half a small cup of water, leaned against the headboard and caught her breath (really like someone who just finished running), then told us:

“One night, after dinner, I lay down on the lounge chair to rest a bit, and I saw the Flower Woman from the neighboring village (an old lady about my age) come with two others, calling me to go pick tea leaves somewhere. One hundred yuan a day, she said. So I took my basket and followed her. That tea-picking place was so far away! First we took a car, then a train. When we got off, I saw people dressed in clothes unlike ours. Then a man with a big beard came and pulled me and the Flower Woman into a line. He was very fierce. The lines marched in order.

We walked for a very long time. I was at the very end of the line, the Flower Woman in the middle. We walked one or two days through places I had never seen. I looked back and saw no one watching me, so I secretly hid. I called to the Flower Woman to hide too, but she ignored me and kept following them…

I hid for a while, then tried to go back, but I didn’t know the way. I searched and searched but could not find the path home. Then I saw my brother nearby doing business. He took me home for a meal. My mother made me a pair of shoes to change on the road, and my brother sent me to the station, telling me where to get off and how to go. I took the train and at the station I saw my in-laws had opened a small restaurant (my grandfather). My mother-in-law was still so beautiful, like a refined lady. She wrapped me a bowl of small wontons and told me to eat quickly and leave, saying if I missed the train back I wouldn’t be able to go, because war was coming, the Japanese were arriving. I didn’t even finish the wontons before I left. I could not find the train station, the rain grew heavier, and I lost one of the shoes my mother made. The Japanese planes roared overhead. I was terrified and ran with all my might. Later I saw your grandfather; he brought me back.

Along the way he scolded me for being foolish, for my age and being tricked by one hundred yuan, for ignoring all the younger ones at home and running off with a basket. He told me to be obedient at home, eat on time, sleep on time, but not to eat too much—only seventy percent full each meal—and to remember this well. Then suddenly I saw so many of you gathered around me.”

The next day, the youngest son of the Flower Woman from the neighboring village came to our village to “report the death,” saying his mother had passed away last night. He said she had been unwell for a few days, lying at home, then she left…

My grandmother is now ninety-eight. Except for some hearing loss, her mind is still clear, and she can take care of herself.

Ha ha ha, this is my grandmother’s experience.
