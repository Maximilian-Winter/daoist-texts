# Grandfather’s Final Meeting with His Descendant Before Reincarnation

My grandfather passed away when I was twelve years old. In his lifetime, he suffered from cerebral atrophy; he had forgotten many people and many things, and his ability to express himself had grown unclear. Yet, somehow, he still remembered me.

When I was very young, I began doing all sorts of farm work—I could handle many tasks. I helped my grandfather wash clothes, fetch water, and bathe. In the era when my grandfather lived, favoring sons over daughters was the norm, so for me to receive his affection was no small thing. And I loved him deeply in return.

In the three years after my grandfather’s passing, I dreamed of him only two or three times. Upon waking, those dreams left no clear memory. Only the last time I dreamed of him did I remember clearly that he had already passed beyond. He told me he was going to a very distant place, to be reborn anew, and that I would never dream of him again. Then he turned and walked away.

I cried, begging him, “Grandfather, please don’t go.” I chased after him, refusing to let him leave. But he kept telling me not to follow. I pursued him all the way behind the house of my elder cousin. There, he said, “The heavens will soon brighten; I must go now,” and then he vanished. The rooster at my cousin’s house crowed several times, and the sun in the dream rose in the sky.

I called out loudly, “Grandfather!” and awoke. It was my alarm clock ringing—set to sound just like a rooster’s crow. Yet the tears at the corner of my eye told me this was real. From that day forward, I never dreamed of my grandfather again. Thus, I believe in the fate that links past and present lives.
