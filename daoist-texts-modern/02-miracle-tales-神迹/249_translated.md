# This Is Not a Place for You to Come

I grew up following my grandfather, who has long since passed away. I miss him dearly, yet as time flows onward, many things that were never recorded in writing have faded in my memory, leaving only vague outlines. While I still remember, I wish to leave a record, and gladly share with all the wondrous and strange world I have seen.

My grandfather was a man of great numinous spirit from childhood—sharp of mind, with a photographic memory. Skilled in qin, chess, calligraphy, and painting, he mastered them all. When he grew up, he pursued education and became a renowned teacher in our county. Yet his body was frail, and he fainted at the sight of blood. Thus, unlike the elders who studied medicine, he chose the path of education.

Grandfather told me he was the youngest child in the family. When my great-grandfather and great-grandmother bore him, ten or so elder siblings had already passed away in infancy, so he was especially cherished. From birth, he was taken to pay respects to thirty-six godfathers—masters of various folk trades. At birth, one godfather, a performer of feats, carried him through a ritual of walking over a mountain of knives and a sea of fire. Once, when the family home caught fire, it was a beggar godfather who came to their aid and saved them all.

My grandfather’s second godfather—his own uncle, my great-granduncle—was a barefoot doctor, specializing in orthopedics, famed across many villages. Grandfather said that for years, even if a leg was broken and bleeding, his great-granduncle could stop the bleeding and pain with a single spit. Even the fiercest bone fractures ceased their agony at his touch; there was no bone he could not set. Thus, the villages called him the Divine Doctor. Grandfather witnessed many miraculous bone-setting cures and long wished to learn medicine from him. But the great-granduncle refused, saying his body was too weak to endure such hardship, and instead taught him the arts he had learned.

Grandfather said his great-granduncle called his art the Maoshan technique. It required retreating periodically to a remote mountain forest, carrying a bowl of clear water to cultivate. During this time, many spirits and monsters would come to drink from the bowl. They must not be disturbed until they finished drinking. Only then would he drink the water himself, thus completing the cultivation. The great-granduncle said these secrets should never be revealed to outsiders, lest the cultivation be harmed. But now that both have passed on, I believe it is no harm to share. I intend to pass these stories to future generations—not demanding belief, but hoping someone will remember the merit accumulated by our ancestors.

My grandfather’s education made him a thorough materialist; he did not believe in ghosts or spirits, only in science. Yet the great-granduncle said he could summon them for him to see, though it might disturb the townsfolk. Grandfather declined. This is the story he told me.

## One: My Own Story

When I was about seventeen, doing my internship in nursing, rotating through the oncology ward, I lived in a dormitory with eight people. My bed was the lower bunk near the door, close to the stairs and the restroom. I clearly remember in the middle of the night someone got up and opened the door with a loud creak. I opened my eyes but could not see who it was, thinking someone had gotten up to use the restroom and paid it no mind. Soon after, the door opened again, equally loud. Feeling the cold wind on my face, I mumbled half-asleep, “Please close the door,” and then heard it shut. A while later, the door opened a third time, the sound even louder, the wind blowing directly on my head. I growled, “Could you keep it down?” The next morning, my roommates said no one had closed the door all night. We counted—only five of us slept there; the others were on night shifts. No one got up, no one opened the door, yet the door was wide open in the morning. A thief was impossible—the door had a latch lock that locked from inside and could not be opened from outside, and any opening would make a loud noise. The roommates wouldn’t do it either; it was winter and cold, no heating in the dorm, and leaving the door open would risk catching a cold. Then, when I and another girl arrived at the ward, the nurse who supervised me said that three elderly patients I cared for had passed away during the night. Those three old men had been in great pain during their stay, and I had cared for them with respect. At that moment, I broke down in tears.

Later, someone told me perhaps the souls of those three elders had accidentally followed me back, leaving at night and opening the door thrice. But if that were so, I had even shouted at them. I have carried that guilt ever since.

## Two: The Passing of Grandfather

After grandfather passed, the family hid it from me for two days. On the night I returned home, I stayed up all night. At the mourning hall, I wept hysterically, moving even my stoic elder brother to tears. Our hometown custom forbids relatives from shedding tears during the coffin burial, lest it bring misfortune to the descendants. So my two uncles and one uncle-in-law forcibly took me away, not letting me attend the burial, knowing I would not hold back.

That night, no one could find a place for me to sleep; I tossed and turned on the sofa. Eventually, I fell asleep and dreamed of the moment grandfather’s coffin was lowered into the ground—his eyes suddenly opened. I woke in terror, sat up, and called my brother and sister, telling them the coffin had just been lowered. My heart was heavy with sorrow; I had not accompanied him on his final journey. This remains my greatest regret in life.

Grandmother always said that after grandfather’s passing, I kept dreaming of him, which caused strange dreams. I was never a person who dreamed much, but in that year and a half after grandfather’s death, I was the only one who dreamed of him nearly every night. No one else dreamed of him again. I thought perhaps because I had not sent him off properly, he could not let me go.

Until one day, I dreamed grandfather took me to the rooftop to fly a kite. He wore his favorite pink-and-white shirt. I looked at him, happily following him up, yet my heart was heavy with the knowledge that he was gone.

On the rooftop, we played joyfully. Suddenly, he turned to me and said, “You already know I am no longer of this world, don’t you?”

Tears burst forth uncontrollably, but I dared not speak, fearing to say something wrong. He stood there, still slender as ever, and said, “I will never trouble you again. Take good care of yourself. Today is the last time I come to see you. I am going to be reborn.” Then he vanished.

I woke, weeping bitterly, knowing I would never see him again. Since then, I have never dreamed of him. I believe a man as perfect as grandfather surely was reborn into a good family.

## Three: Other Incidents

During the National Day holiday, I returned home to pay respects and slept in grandfather’s old bed. Others were afraid, but I was not—he loved me most in life; what was there to fear? That night, I went to bed late. I remember it was exactly eleven oh five. I held my phone in one hand and tugged the blanket with the other. The phone was a Nokia five-two-three-zero, so I remember clearly.

Then I caught a hand.

I turned and saw a black humanoid figure pulling my hand. I was strangely happy—I had finally seen a ghost. I tried hard to remember its appearance as it pulled me out of the bedroom. Once outside, it let go. I followed willingly, wondering where it would lead me, and entered a forest.

Here and there, I glimpsed hurried figures.

We walked a long, long time—I felt it was at least several days—until we boarded a crowded train. The train had no doors, only mist on both sides, and people kept getting off from both sides. The shadow I followed pushed forward without noticing me. I could not see where it went and, with resolve, I got off from the side.

Descending felt like falling into an abyss. When I climbed up, I found myself on a black canopy boat, with two white eternal lamps burning at the prow.

The boat was tall. I struggled to climb down and saw a narrow place surrounded by what looked like hanging coffin lids. A middle-aged man was sawing something. I politely approached and asked, “Uncle, may I ask where this is?”

The man looked up, startled, then put down his saw and stared at me. I recall his tone was stern: “This is not a place for you. Hurry back! Hurry back!” He pushed me toward the boat.

Realizing I had been brought to a dangerous place, I panicked and tried to retreat. I asked, “Back to the boat?”

“Yes, hurry back. This is not a place for you!”

With that clear answer, I ran toward the boat. Suddenly, a child appeared. The man looked afraid of the child, and I knew trouble was near. I scrambled onto the boat. The child ran after me, grabbing my leg: “Sister, don’t go. Stay and play with me.”

I knew not to anger him, so I crouched and said, “Little one, I have things to do. Let’s play next time, okay?”

“No! I want you to play with me now.”

A chill ran through me. I ignored everything and climbed onto the boat with all my might. The child, too weak to pull me down, grew angry and extinguished the two lamps at the prow.

Suddenly, I felt my body falling—falling endlessly—my viscera felt as if shattering. Then I crashed heavily onto my bed, my whole body aching as if breaking apart.

At that moment, I felt the pillow beneath my head. I knew I had returned.

Yet I was still dazed, pondering all that had happened, unable to distinguish reality from illusion.

Then, half-awake, I saw a group pass by my bed. They resembled those who had taken me away, but only one was dressed in splendid robes, unlike the others. He radiated light. Curiously, I reached out and grabbed him. When he turned, I was shocked—it was not a human face, but a horse’s face.

He asked, puzzled, “Do you know me?”

I stared in awe at his radiant light, which felt truly warm. I asked a foolish question, “Are you a god?”

He stopped and seemed to say, “It’s all right.” Then he slowly sat beside my bed. I was deeply moved; the warmth was overwhelming. I watched as he sat, his light gradually fading. I felt strength return, enough to rise.

Later, I checked the time: only eleven twenty-five. Yet it felt as though many days had passed.

To this day, I still shudder recalling the event. I am grateful to the uncle who pushed me back and to the radiant being. I do not know if I truly saw that great one, but in that moment, the warmth banished all fear. If I meet him again in a hundred years, I will surely say thank you.
