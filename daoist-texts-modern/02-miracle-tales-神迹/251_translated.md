# The Verified Bell of the Pengshan Temple in Meizhou

In Meizhou of Sichuan, there once stood an abandoned Daoist temple known as the Pengshan Temple. Within its silent halls hung an ancient bell, weighing several thousand catties. The temple lay more than twenty li from the city’s heart. Each time the bell was struck, its deep and lingering tones would ripple far beyond the city walls, echoing through the landscape like a voice from the heavens.

After more than a year passed, the monks of Meizhou, stirred by greed, petitioned the local authorities with falsehoods. They claimed that the Pengshan Temple was utterly deserted, not a single Daoist remained, and that weeds had overtaken the grounds. They insisted the copper bell should be removed. The official in charge, lacking true insight and clarity, hastily approved their request.

The copper bell was transported to a monastery within the city. Yet, no sooner had it been hung than misfortune struck—the foot of a craftsman was injured. This monastery faced directly toward the city gate, but when the bell was struck, its sound could not even penetrate the gate, let alone resound across the city as before. The monks understood then—the bell was manifesting its numinous power.

In response, they forged a new bell. Yet, they did not return the ancient bell to its rightful place, instead selling it to a temple in Jiazhou.

As the old bell was taken down from its belfry, calamity followed once more: two artisans broke their legs and bent their backs. When the bell was shipped by water, injuries continued as it embarked from the shore. Alas, the ignorant and hardened common folk failed to perceive that the ancient bell was revealing its spiritual potency.

From that day forth, the Pengshan Temple’s copper bell was lost to the winds of fate, never to return. This tale remains a lamentation, a sorrowful echo of what once was.
