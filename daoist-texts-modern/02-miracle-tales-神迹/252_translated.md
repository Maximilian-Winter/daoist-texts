# Commander Wei Gao’s Account of the Yellow Register Ritual’s Efficacy

When Wei Gao, the Grand Commandant and Secretary of the Central Secretariat, the Prince of Nankang, was overseeing state affairs in Chengdu, he undertook the development of a new southern market across the river, just south of Wanli Bridge. There, he excavated ancient tombs and filled them in to build streets and marketplaces. In a brief span, along the southern bank of the river, new people settled into new houses; pavilions and towers rose with carved beams and painted rafters; crowds thronged the bustling scene, a spectacle of beauty beyond compare.

Yet, as dusk fell each day, a wave of terror gripped the hearts of all. Sand and stones whipped through the air like wild spirits; ghostly wails and wolf-like howls echoed ceaselessly. The cause was clear: during the development of this new district, no tombs had been respectfully relocated, nor had any altars been set up for prayers and solemn petitions. Instead, the graves were simply filled over—mere empty formalities, nothing more than a hollow show. Since the numinous spirits and ethereal souls could find no peaceful dwelling, the market itself could not be truly established.

Upon learning of this, Wei Gao summoned Daoist adepts to erect a Yellow Register ritual altar on the site, with sincere repentance and confession of guilt.

After two days of rites, by the third day, the ghostly cries ceased. The people living there found peace at last. Wei Gao dreamed that an immortal appeared and spoke to him: “In your undertaking of the southern market, you disturbed the burial grounds, leaving the shades of the netherworld homeless and bereft of their bones. Together they grieved deeply, nearly bringing about great calamity.

Only through the power of the Yellow Register altar were these spirits delivered. The Heavenly Sovereign pardoned more than thirty thousand ghostly beings, who, riding on the merit of this ritual, were reborn and transmigrated. From that moment on, those dwelling here live in tranquility, no longer fearing disturbance.”

Wei Gao was struck with awe. He composed the “Record of the Yellow Register” and set up a stone stele at the True Talisman Temple to preserve this account.
