# The Verifications of Spirit Spells and Fasting by Wang Zhaoshang of Suzhou

Wang Zhaoshang, an official of the Wang clan serving at the Ironworks Bureau in Suzhou, was a man of immense wealth. His household was piled high with treasures and goods, and he lacked nothing in food or drink. Yet he was grievously afflicted by illness, ailing for many years without relief. Though he had set up fasting offerings before divine images and widely employed shamans and healers with their talismans and incantations, having tried nearly every method known, none could dispel his suffering.

Chen Daoming, a Daoist of the Jade Zhi Temple, devoted himself diligently to the pure cultivation of the dao. His ritual assemblies often bore miraculous results. Yet Wang Zhaoshang had never believed in the dao; he scorned those who spoke of mysteries and the Way. He thought: “I have spent countless riches—tens of thousands in coin and goods—to cure my body, yet it only wastes away. Death is all that awaits.” His family and friends urged him to invite Daoist Chen Daoming to establish an altar and perform the sacred jiao rites. Reluctantly, Wang Zhaoshang sent word to summon the Daoist.

Daoist Chen Daoming arrived at his home, setting up the altar and arranging the formations to perform the spirit spells and disaster-dispelling ritual. As Wang Zhaoshang’s condition worsened, nearing the brink of death, his family pressed the Daoist to begin the ceremony without delay. Just as the ritual commenced, Wang Zhaoshang suddenly closed his eyes. The household was struck with alarm, fearing all hope was lost. Yet after Daoist Chen took up the Way and began his rites, wielding the ritual sword and holding the sacred water, he sprinkled it throughout the inner and outer chambers of the house, dispelling the foul sickness.

Then Wang Zhaoshang spoke: “Master, might you sprinkle some water here as well?” Daoist Chen Daoming entered his bedchamber and sprinkled some water there too. Suddenly, Wang Zhaoshang sat upright, bowing his head to the ground, saying: “I am deeply grateful for your immortal skill! There is now hope for my healing.” Rising, he sat upright with joy and declared: “All my life I have applied my heart wrongly, ignorant of the great dao. Today I have witnessed the might of the heavenly warriors!”

He slowly recounted to his wife and family: “At first, my body was beyond my control, trapped in darkness, thinking this day was my death. Even when Daoist Chen opened the altar, I did not awaken. I heard a voice from the void proclaim: ‘The Great Emperor descends, leading the heavenly warriors to punish the rebels.’ Then a yellow radiance flashed like the sun, instantly filling the entire space. I saw millions of heavenly soldiers and divine generals on horseback encircle this dwelling. Countless ghosts and evil spirits were captured and bound. Then the Great Emperor and the Heavenly Deity of Great Unity rode forth in a chariot of seven treasures, like earthly sovereigns, surrounded by their guards. I was summoned to approach the Heavenly Deity of Great Unity. The deity commanded water to be sprinkled upon my face; a coolness penetrated deep into my heart. Instantly, I felt no pain in my body, though my strength remained somewhat weak.”

At that moment, he heard that the Primordial Heavenly Venerable was about to descend to the human realm. Hastening forward, he bowed deeply, seeing the ceremonial retinue had multiplied hundreds of times over. Then the Primordial Heavenly Venerable shone a beam of light upon him, and his strength increased greatly.

Wang Zhaoshang informed his relatives: “Quickly prepare my washing utensils, so I may cleanse myself and go to the altar to bow.” His family worried that his body, newly recovered from grave illness, might not endure, and urged him to wait until he was stronger. But Wang Zhaoshang would not listen. He insisted on washing and changing clothes. At first, he leaned on a cane, standing a long while, then cast it aside and walked straight to the altar, bowing with fervent sincerity. When his family tried to support him, he pushed them away. Afterwards, he sat aside to watch the ritual, looking as if he had never been ill—eating and living as before his sickness. Throughout the three days of the dao assembly, he devoutly offered incense and bowed without needing any assistance.

Later, he funded the restoration of the Jade Zhi Temple: the lecture hall, main shrine, gate tower, covered corridors, dining hall, and alchemical chambers, as well as the protective moat and streets before the temple, extending over forty paces (one pace equals five feet). Whether trees or earth, divine images or buildings, beds, pillows, vessels, clothing, or storehouses—anything money could procure was completed within two years. From that time on, his spirit was clear and refreshed, his mind alert and keen. Thus he resigned his official post and cultivated the dao, attaining true self-realization.
