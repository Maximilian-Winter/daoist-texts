# The Response of Zhao Guohai of Shandong to the *Scripture of the Three Officials*

Zhao Guohai, a native of Heze in Shandong, was a man diligent in his ways, yet his fortunes lay in shadows, his endeavors met with misfortune. Nearly thirty-one undertakings ended in failure. Moreover, he was plagued by recurring nightmares—visions of a woman, her hair disheveled and wild. At times she crouched by his bedside; at others, she stood silently in a corner, her gaze fixed upon him. His family, sensing a hidden cause, burned incense and worshipped deities far and wide, seeking a means to dispel this haunting presence.

Once, he journeyed to the Taiqing Palace on Mount Laoshan to offer incense. The Daoist priest who received him looked deeply and said, “A young woman follows you closely. This is the karma you forged in your previous life.” Zhao Guohai was stunned, for the priest’s words mirrored the very figure from his dreams. Bowing his head, he inquired, “What exactly has happened?”

The priest replied, “In your former life, you wronged this woman grievously and promised to marry her, yet you never fulfilled your vow. She died bearing a heart heavy with grievance. Her resentment lingers, thus she remains by your side.”

Greatly alarmed and filled with remorse, Zhao Guohai asked, “Is there a worthy method to resolve this?”

The priest said, “First, you must sincerely repent; second, you must perform the Yellow Register fast to send this lady on her way.”

Eagerly, Zhao Guohai implored, “Then please, Daoist, help me now to liberate this resentful creditor!”

The priest answered, “All sins arise from the heart. Without true repentance, any liberation is but fleeting. Return home, fast, and reflect for one full month before returning to me.” With that, he handed Zhao Guohai a copy of the *Scripture of the Three Officials*, saying, “Recite this scripture morning and evening, repent and confess your sins, and surely you will perceive response.” Zhao Guohai bowed deeply in gratitude.

At home, following the priest’s instructions, he burned incense each dawn and dusk, recited the scripture with contrition, kowtowed with tears, and repented with all his heart. After more than twenty days, the nightmares grew scarce. His spirit brightened as never before. A month later, he returned to Mount Laoshan to seek the priest, only to learn that the Daoist had already departed on a wandering journey.

Yet Zhao Guohai continued to follow the priest’s teachings. He commissioned the construction of a Yellow Register fast hall to perform rites liberating resentful creditors, dedicating the merit to all sentient beings throughout the Three Realms and the Ten Directions. He also resolved to take refuge in the Great Dao. From that day forth, his spirit grew ever stronger, and his fortunes gradually improved.

The Iron-Crowned Daoist said: Since time immemorial, through countless kalpas, whether knowingly or not, we err. These faults are not merely in killing, stealing, or licentiousness, but also in false speech and anger; sometimes a single malicious glance can wound another. Perhaps we forget swiftly, but the other harbors bitterness. Thus, enemies are made, bound by endless cycles of retribution through lifetimes. Therefore, we must diligently practice repentance, often facing the Most High Sages and Perfected Ones, revealing our true hearts and confessing our sins. If you repent sincerely, the Heavenly Venerables will forgive your transgressions. Resentful creditors, sensing your contrition, will soften their hatred. Only then can your path through life become ever smoother.
