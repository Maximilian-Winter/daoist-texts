# The Verified Tale of Du Jianzhou Holding the Scripture of Deliverance from the Nine Netherworlds’ Sins

Du Wu, a man from Jingzhao, held an important official post in Chengdu. He was a man of uprightness, untainted by corruption, and was esteemed and revered by all. When he fell ill with a slight malady, he took leave for several days. His family, in secret, summoned a shaman to diagnose his condition. The shaman said: “There is a youth, his body covered in blood, who claims to be your younger brother. He met an untimely end, a guest who died in a foreign land, with no one to offer him sacrifices. His heart harbors resentment, and thus your official career has been obstructed, causing many hindrances.”

The family relayed this to Du Wu, who inwardly knew the words were true. He said, “My younger brother has been away for many years; I do not know if he lives or dies. I have never thought to set up a memorial tablet for him, fearing he might still dwell in the world of the living. Now that I know, the description of his form, age, birth order, and childhood name are all accurate!” Deep sorrow filled Du Wu’s heart. After some time, he again sent the shaman to inquire what the departed spirit required.

The reply came: “So many years have passed that worldly rites alone cannot suffice. A Daoist must be invited to recite the *Golden Register’s Marvelous Precepts: Scripture of Deliverance from the Nine Netherworlds’ Sins* nine times, to draw talismans and burn them. Only then will there be effect. After this, the spirit will no longer return. Once I depart, the lawsuits and obstacles will vanish, and my elder brother will immediately rise in rank, serving as governor of two prefectures.”

Thus, the Du family invited the Daoist Gu Songhua, beseeching him to recite this scripture. He established the ritual altar, recited one hundred and twenty scrolls of the scripture, set up the altar petition, and burned garments and money offerings for the departed soul. When the ritual was complete, the shaman declared that the spirit had received the offerings, expressed gratitude, and departed. More than one month later, Du Wu was promoted to magistrate of the prefectural city, then appointed governor of Jianzhou. Upon completing his term, he assumed the office of ancient master of Jianzhou.

For this reason, he composed over one hundred copies of the *Scripture of the Nine Netherworlds*, passing them down among families who revere the Great Dao, urging them to hold and uphold this scripture!
