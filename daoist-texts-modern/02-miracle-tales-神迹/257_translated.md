# The Matter of Zhang Gaofu of Chisong Seeking Transcendence

Zhang Gaofu, a native of Henan, once took monastic vows at a local Temple of the Three Officials. In time, he wandered through the lands of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, finally settling as a guest resident at the Chisong Palace in Jinhua. There he remained for several years. When illness befell him grievously, his family came to Chisong and brought him back to Henan. It is said that not long after returning home, he underwent feathering transformation—ascending beyond the mortal coil.

One year, in the seventh lunar month, the steward of Chisong Palace was quietly reading in his alchemical chamber. At that moment, a knock came upon the door, and in stepped none other than Daoist Zhang Gaofu himself. Zhang addressed the steward: “Kind steward, your compassion is great. I have come to inform you of my temporary leave; I am returning home.” The steward replied, “Ah, very well. Go in peace, but remember to settle your accounts at the treasury. You are always welcome to return.” Zhang then said, “The Zhongyuan Festival is soon to arrive. When the temple holds its Daoist rites, please remember to inscribe my name.” With that, he took his leave.

The steward was stunned for quite some time afterward. Had Zhang Gaofu not left Chisong Palace years ago? Why now come to formally request leave? Could it be that he sought to have his name written for transcendence rites? Thus, when the Zhongyuan Festival came, during the temple’s Yellow Register fast, the steward himself paid out of pocket to have a memorial tablet inscribed for Zhang Gaofu’s passage to the beyond.

This tale was heard from a senior brother during those earlier years in Jinhua. Hence, many temples set up ancestral halls to venerate the successive patriarchs of their mountain lineage. Likewise, household Daoists often enshrine their own sect’s founding masters, maintaining the incense and offerings. There is wisdom in this practice, after all.
