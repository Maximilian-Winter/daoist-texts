# The Numinous Efficacy of the Five Sacred Mountains True-Form Diagram Worn by the Lay Practitioner of Lanzhou

Lay Practitioner Wang, a native of Lanzhou in Gansu, set out on the National Day of the Year of the Rooster, driving forth from Lanzhou to Nanchang to offer incense. The entire journey was upon the highways, racing swiftly all along the way. Reverent of the daoist teachings, Wang was well aware of the Five Sacred Mountains True-Form Diagram—a treasured talisman bestowed by the Queen Mother of the West to Emperor Wu of Han. Carried close at hand, it wards off calamities and transmutes malevolent forces. Especially when entering mountains and traversing perilous paths, or setting out by carriage, it is most fitting to wear this talisman, ensuring safety throughout the journey. Thus, Wang affixed the Five Sacred Mountains True-Form Diagram firmly onto his vehicle, so tightly that it required effort to pry it loose. Under the protection of the Five Sacred Mountains True-Form Diagram, the road remained safe and untroubled.

When the carriage reached Yichang in Hubei, the heavens opened with heavy rain. On the highway, visibility was poor. At that moment, Wang suddenly noticed the vehicle ahead had come to a standstill. It turned out there had been a collision, yet the car in front had not pulled over to the emergency lane, nor had it set out a triangular warning sign. Quickly, Wang braked and slowed, turning the wheel to shift into another lane. At this instant, the Five Sacred Mountains True-Form Diagram, which had been so tightly fastened, gave a sharp snap and fell down. Not long after, the sound of sudden braking and the crash of colliding vehicles echoed behind. All present believed that the Five Sacred Mountains True-Form Diagram had averted a disaster. They bowed in sincere prayer, giving thanks for the grace and protection of the great Dao.

The *Baopuzi* states: “Those who cultivate the dao and dwell in hidden mountain valleys must wear the Five Sacred Mountains True-Form Diagram. Then the mountain spirits, demons, tigers, insects, and all manner of malevolent poisons cannot approach.” On the seventh day of the seventh month in the third year of the Yuanfeng era under Emperor Wu of Han, it was received from the Queen Mother of the West and spread among the people. Later, in the Tai Chu period, Li Chong, who claimed to be from Fengyi and to have lived three hundred years, carried the diagram upon a grass vessel as he roamed. Emperor Wu saw him and conferred upon him the title “Master of the Diagram.” Hence, those who wear this diagram may cross rivers and seas, enter mountains and valleys, travel at night in the wilderness, or lodge by chance in ominous houses—every evil spirit, demon, goblin, water monster, and mountain essence will all vanish and flee, daring not to harm them. When kept at home for veneration, no malevolence can arise, and auspiciousness will gather forever. Therefore, this diagram is not only to be worn as a talisman scroll but may also be framed as a painting for household reverence and protection.
