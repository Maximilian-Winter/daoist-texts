# Chen Lihua of Huzhou Recalls the Efficacious Sacred Name of the Thunder Venerable

Chen Lihua, a native of Huzhou in Zhejiang, had a daily routine. Each time he went to and from work, there was a bend in the road where a small shrine stood. This humble sanctuary was a place where local villagers offered reverence to the regional spirits, though ordinarily it bore little incense or devotion.

One night, as Chen Lihua rode his electric scooter past this spot, he nearly collided with a child who suddenly appeared. Fortunately, the danger passed without harm. The very next day, a similar event occurred: he knocked down a middle-aged man. Though the man escaped serious injury, Chen Lihua compensated him with several hundred coins. Puzzled by these strange happenings, that night he dreamed of a man who smiled at him in a most uncanny way.

Unease took root in Chen Lihua’s heart. He had a relative at home, a devout Daoist priest serving in Wenzhou. Seeking clarity, Chen Lihua asked this kin, “What could all this mean?” The Daoist replied, “At crossroads, dilapidated shrines often harbor restless spirits. You might burn some paper offerings there to send them off.” Chen Lihua inquired further, “And if these troubles persist, what then?” The priest answered, “Within Daoism, there is a deity of great compassion and great vow, a great sage of immense mercy. He once pledged that all beings, no matter the hardship they face, if they sincerely call upon his sacred name, shall receive protection. When you travel by night, or suffer from fearful dreams or dread, recite the sacred title: ‘Heavenly Venerable of the Thunderous Universal Transformation of the Nine Heavens’ Response Origin.’ This will surely bring response.” With that, the priest handed Chen Lihua a protective talisman card bearing the Thunder Venerable’s image and a copy of the *Jade Pivot Scripture*. Chen Lihua expressed profound gratitude and took his leave.

In just a few days, Chen Lihua called the priest again: “The method you taught me is truly efficacious. One night, I dreamed of a monk clad in white, standing in the middle of the road with a grim countenance. I recited the sacred name of the Heavenly Venerable of the Thunderous Universal Transformation of the Nine Heavens’ Response Origin, and soon the monk vanished. Several other times, when plagued by nightmares, the same sacred name drove away those fierce and malevolent spirits. The *Jade Pivot Scripture* you gave me—I wrapped it in red cloth and enshrined it in my study at home. Since then, all has gone smoothly. I am deeply thankful to you!”

The Daoist priest replied, “Do not thank me. Give thanks to the compassionate vow and protective grace of the Heavenly Venerable.”
