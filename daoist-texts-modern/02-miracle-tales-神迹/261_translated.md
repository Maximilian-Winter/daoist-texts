# The Numinous Efficacy of the Ten-Character Heavenly Scripture Recited by Zhao Lixian of Yongjia

Zhao Lixian, a native of Yongjia in Zhejiang, cherished the dao and sought immortality. Yet, bound by worldly affairs, he was unable to leave home to seek the dao in solitude. Thus, he cultivated within the household. During the time when the Nine Sovereigns descended in sacred manifestation, he devoutly recited the *True Scripture of the Northern Dipper*.

One night, as he slept, he dreamed of a woman, her hair loose and flowing, clad in plain robes. She lay beside him, smiling gently, and with a needle she pricked his shoulder. Zhao Lixian was greatly startled, yet found himself unable to awaken. In silent prayer, he intoned the sacred name, “Heavenly Venerable of the Primordial Thunder, Responding from the Nine Heavens,” and after great difficulty, he finally roused. Though awake, a lingering pain throbbed faintly in his shoulder.

The Iron-Crowned Daoist said: “Many who do not cultivate the dao remain untouched, but once one sets foot on the path, demons arise to obstruct. Why is this so? The word ‘demon’ (mo) means ‘to grind.’ For every foot the dao ascends, the demon rises ten. In the world there are malevolent spirits, sometimes old enemies from past lives, who delight in hindering others’ cultivation. On the other hand, it is also because the cultivator’s own virtue and merit fall short. As the *Awakening to the True* states: ‘The great dao is easy or difficult to cultivate, beginning with self and Heaven. If one does not practice and accumulate hidden virtue, a host of demons will arise to block the way.’ Therefore, to attain the path of immortality, one must widely accumulate hidden virtue and aid the world’s beings. Then the spirits will guard and protect, and evil demons will retreat afar.”

Yet, in the process of accumulating virtue, one must not pause in cultivation. What then is to be done? One must employ “dao techniques” to aid oneself. For example, the lay cultivator Zhao Lixian, when beset by fiends and demons, recited the sacred name of the Thunder Venerable. This is a method to resolve difficulties when they arise. But this alone is far from enough. As the *Master Who Embraces Simplicity* says: “All who follow the dao and take medicine, or who flee chaos to dwell in seclusion, enter the mountains. Yet those who do not understand the methods of mountain entry often meet with disaster. Hence the saying: ‘Beneath Mount Taihua, bones lie scattered and wolves roam.’ This means those who know only one thing but not the whole, though they seek life, instead hasten death.”

Therefore, we cultivators, even those who refine the inner elixir, should learn the arts of restraining the soul and commanding the spirit. Not to say this can save the world and all beings, at least it can protect oneself.
