# The Devout of Bengbu Recite the Jade Pivot Scripture and Their Response

The lay devotee Meng, a native of Bengbu in Anhui Province, reverently embraces the Three Treasures and takes refuge in the Profound Teachings.

This year, he planned to purchase a home, searching far and wide until he set his heart upon a soon-to-be-opened housing estate in Bengbu. Meng wished to acquire a spacious dwelling—one hundred and fifteen square meters in size. The estate assigned homes by drawing lots. There were one hundred and eight units; Meng held number seventy-six. The sales attendant told him, “Even if you manage to get a one hundred and fifteen square meter floor, you will not be able to choose your preferred unit.”

On the eve of the opening, a day marked by the heavenly stem Xin, Meng sat at home, offering water and flowers, and recited the Jade Pivot Scripture once through. He confided his desire for a one hundred and fifteen square meter unit on a favorable floor to the Ancestral Lord of Thunder, praying for the august thunder deity’s blessing, hoping to obtain the home of his heart’s wish.

When the opening began at dawn, Meng’s family remarked, “This time, it looks like you will only get a west-facing unit.” Yet, to their astonishment, Meng secured a one hundred and fifteen square meter home on the sixth floor, east-facing.

He deeply felt the vast compassion and profound vow of the Heavenly Venerable of the Nine Heavens’ Primordial Thunder, the Universal Transforming Heavenly Sovereign, and the response was extraordinary.

The Jade Pivot Scripture states:  
“The Heavenly Venerable said: ‘I am the Great Sage of the Nine Heavens’ Pure Radiance. On the sixth day of each month and on the mid-ten-day Xin days, I oversee myriad heavens and roam freely through the Three Realms. Should anyone desire to learn the dao, aspire to immortality, seek to evade the Nine Mysteries, or wish to be freed from the Three Calamities, they must command a proper daoist, or gather their kin and friends within tower temples, at home, or in their communities, to offer water and flowers and to recite this scripture—once, thrice, five times, even dozens or hundreds of times—and they shall attain spiritual clarity and refreshing vigor, their hearts expand and their bodies grow robust. Whatever they seek, all shall respond to their earnest call.’”

A hymn of praise:  
No need for things, with breath alone one attains.  
One utters the august name, and Heaven and Earth turn to spring.
