# The Story of the Virtuous Layman from Shandong Delivering the Unoffered Orphaned Souls

Li Chengshun, a native of Qingdao in Shandong, suddenly had a dream this year. In his dream appeared three or five ragged children, their garments tattered, following closely behind him. Vaguely, there was also a monk among them.

Upon waking, he found that misfortunes began to befall him, and his whole body felt drained of strength. So he sought out the local Daoist master to inquire into the cause of these troubles. The Daoist asked, “Have you ever caused a miscarriage?”

Li Chengshun replied, “I have always been single before; I have no such experience.”

The Daoist then asked, “When did this condition arise?”

Li Chengshun answered, “Only this year.”

“Have you recently moved to a new residence?”

“Yes,” Li Chengshun said.

He went on to explain that he was now working at a construction site, a place that was formerly an Anti-Japanese War memorial hall. During the Japanese invasion of China, fierce battles had taken place here. The Japanese devils slaughtered many innocent villagers. Yet no rites of deliverance had ever been performed, and so the resentment was heavy; orphaned souls wandered restlessly. Sometimes, even in the height of summer, a sudden chill wind would sweep through the room, causing the hairs on one’s skin to stand on end. The elders said that once there was a monk’s temple here. The monk had sided with the Japanese invaders, aiding their cruelty. The villagers could not bear it and killed the monk.

The Daoist said, “Souls that die with grievances, when certain matters remain unresolved, refuse to reincarnate. Or at death, they may have been bound by talismanic laws, their souls detained here. They become orphaned wandering ghosts, unrecorded by the City God, unnoted by the Eastern Peak, unable to be reborn. Alas, alas!”

Li Chengshun knelt and bowed, saying, “Today they have found me, knowing I have a dao affinity. Therefore, no matter what, I will help them. I hope the Daoist master will show compassion, raise the great dharma cloud, let fall the great dharma rain, universally bestow sweet dew, rescue the netherworld, guide the unoffered souls, so they may directly ascend to the joys of Heaven and Earth. Your disciple will spare no expense to assist.”

Thus, on an auspicious day, an altar was established, and the grand yellow register fast was performed to universally aid the netherworld. The ritual feast was complete; heavenly sweet rain descended. The next day, the clouds dispersed and the rain ceased. Li Chengshun felt the air here was clear and bright, the courtyard filled with auspicious qi.
