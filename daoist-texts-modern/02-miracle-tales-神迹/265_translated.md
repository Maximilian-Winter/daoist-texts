# Paper Money Must Not Be Burned for the Most High Sages and Worthies

Burning paper money is an important way for our people to pray for blessings and communicate with ghosts and spirits. Whenever the Three Origins or the Five Winters come round, during ancestral rites and deity worship, paper money is always burned. But do you know? Paper money must not be burned for the Most High Sages and Worthies.

The *Heavenly Altar Jade Code* states: “At the great rituals, before the Heavenly True Ones of the sun, moon, stars, and constellations above Heaven, paper money must not be burned, lest one offend the Highest Worthies. Only the ghosts and spirits of the middle and lower realms, as well as one’s ancestral lands and local deities, may be offered paper money. In ancient times, this method did not exist; it was the Han Celestial Masters who first employed incantations to transform it, as recorded in the *Cavern Spirit Registers*.” See here? Only the ghosts and spirits of the middle and lower realms, and one’s ancestors and land gods, may receive paper money. If it is for the Most High Sages and Worthies—such as the Three Pure Ones, the Four Sovereigns, the Thunderous Universal Illumination Heavenly Venerable, or the Four Great Celestial Masters of the upper realms—paper money is not used. Not only is it unnecessary for blessings, but it is a transgression.

The *Crane Forest Dharma Sayings* declares: “Whenever setting up a ritual, one must not offer paper money to the Highest Worthies; this is a great profanation. In ancient times, though there were spirit utensils, there was no paper money. Only by the end of the Han did paper money appear, used to honor ghosts and spirits of the middle and lower realms—that is acceptable. But to offer it to the Heavenly True Ones? Impossible! The greedy and profit-seeking of this world, though they may have passed through the Taiyin, still harbor lingering thoughts. As the *Ten Thousand Radiances Repentance* says, what is lacking is worldly wealth and treasure. Thus, the transformation of paper money aims only to break their desires!” Patriarch Bai Yuchan, in the *Crane Forest Dharma Sayings*, admonishes disciples: do not use paper money to venerate the Highest Worthies.

Because paper money belongs to spirit utensils, it is burned for the departed ghosts. Lower realm deities and local land lords may receive it. But the Most High Sages and Worthies dwell in the realm of pure yang and do not require such things. In ancient times, there were spirit utensils but no paper money. Paper money only came into use at the end of the Han.

According to the *Miscellaneous Records of the Wanli Era*: “For example, Emperor Shizong of Zhou issued edicts making paper into gold and silver ingots; the yellow ones were called ‘Treasure of the Fountain Terrace,’ the white ones ‘Treasure of the Netherworld Journey’—already laughable. By the Song Gaozong’s time, the imperial ancestral temple used paper money for offerings, and officials found the amount insufficient. Emperor Xiaozong was displeased; a remonstrating official said, ‘Paper money is a Buddhist invention to help the departed pass on; it is not fitting for the sage sovereign.’ Xiaozong replied, ‘What sort of man was Shao Yaofu? When he worshipped ancestors, he must use paper money. Are living people in the world such that you could go a single day without money?’ Thus, this too is a passed-down story.” During the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms, Emperor Shizong already used paper money; in the Song dynasty, emperors also used it for ancestral rites. According to Emperor Xiaozong, Shao Kangjie also used paper money for ancestor worship.

According to Patriarch Bai Yuchan, the Han people used paper money in ancestral rites to break the greed of the departed. Why so?

Because though the departed have died, their attachments remain. Most people, while living in the world, lack money—that is the truth. Because of this attachment, they cannot reincarnate. How then can this attachment be broken? The best method is to give them much money (how reasonable! Once they have it, they no longer cling to it; the best way to stop the poor from coveting wealth is to give them endless money). Therefore, when burning paper money in rites, it is actually to break the departed’s greed. It is not that the departed truly need these things.

Thus, it becomes clear why burning paper money for the Most High Sages and Worthies is a transgression.

Because the implication is: “You still have greed,” which is incorrect. The Most High Sages and Worthies are perfect and complete; they need none of these. Yet sometimes, when performing rituals, paper money is still burned; in such cases, the paper money is intended for the guardian deities and spirits, not for the Most High Sages and Worthies.

Lin Boqian said: “How then should offerings be made?” The answer was: “In ancient times, the way to communicate was sincerity first; if later sincerity was insufficient, then objects were prepared as rites. If one’s sincerity is true, and objects are prepared, that is still acceptable. But if the objects are not prepared, nothing is more profane. The scriptures say: ‘One may offer water and flowers; why seek anything else?’ The scriptures also say: ‘Embody the dignity of the world.’ Thus, all present-day offerings should be without shame and sufficient! Otherwise, all are liable to profanation—should we not be cautious?” 

So what is good to offer the deities? The *Northern Dipper Scripture* says: “Follow the dignity of the world,” placing sincerity above all. Build merit according to one’s ability. Incense, flowers, lamps, fruits, tea, water, treasures, and garments—these are the ten offerings. The scripture says: “Offer incense, lamps, tea, and wine; nourish all the great gods and immortals. The good believers now offer incense, lamps, tea, and wine, wishing for boundless blessings and longevity.” Generally, one offers to the Most High Worthies according to worldly rites, but abstaining from meat and fish.

The scripture says: “Dao incense, virtue incense, non-action incense, pure and natural incense.” A heart of purity and compassion, a sincere and reverent heart, is the best offering. Some people, due to economic conditions, cannot afford much, but as long as they have a pure and compassionate heart and sincerely revere the deities, they too will receive blessings.
