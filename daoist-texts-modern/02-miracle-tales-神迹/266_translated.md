# The Efficacy of the Purple Tenuity Incantation Water

Tang Suqing, a native of Shiyan in Hubei, descended from humble farmers—his grandfather, Master Tang, was one such tiller of the soil in the local fields. During the Cultural Revolution, when the Daoist priests of Wudang Mountain were forced down from their sacred heights, Master Tang’s heart overflowed with great compassion. He tended to the Daoists’ daily needs—food, drink, and lodging—with unwavering kindness. Moved by his virtue, one Daoist master taught him to recite the scriptures of the Three Officials and the Northern Dipper, as well as imparting some knowledge of traditional Chinese medicine. After the turmoil passed, the Daoist returned to Wudang Mountain, and no more was said. Throughout his life, Master Tang held the salvation of the world and the deliverance of others as his highest concern. Villagers from near and far came seeking medicine and counsel; whether rich or poor, all were treated equally with utmost care. The fees for medicine were left to the sincerity of the heart—never demanded. So often did his children quarrel with him over this generosity that their voices filled the household.

Tang Suqing himself, from childhood, followed his ancestral master in healing arts and climbed the mountains to gather herbs. He studied Daoist talismanic methods, and by his early teens was already curing illnesses with talismanic water, with many remarkable results. Later, he entered a college of traditional Chinese medicine for deeper study, graduating to work at the Wuhan National Medical Hall. Yet his yearning for the dao was so fervent that he abandoned his position to enter the mountains and pursue the Way.

One year, Master Tang fell gravely ill. Tang Suqing returned home to administer decoctions, but his grandfather’s eyes remained half-closed for over a month. Several times he nearly passed beyond the veil, only to be revived by the herbal brews. For more than a month, Master Tang lay bedridden. One day, his eyes would not open, his mouth would not part, speech was lost, and his breath was faint—his condition perilous beyond measure. Only one hand moved, tracing the character “Tai” upon the bedsheet, as if trying to speak. In urgent desperation, Tang Suqing took a bowl of pure water, holding it in his left hand with the Three Mountains mudra, while his right hand formed the Sword mudra. He traced the Purple Tenuity incantation nine times, then dipped the sword finger in the water and smeared it upon his grandfather’s lips. The elder opened his mouth and spoke: “The Lord of Mount Tai and the King Yan have sent shadowy soldiers to seize me. Hurry and burn paper offerings to send them away.” Tang Suqing sprinkled the ritual water around the room, then hastened to burn paper money outside the house. Afterwards, Master Tang said, “The Great Emperor of Mount Tai and the King Yan dispatched twelve underworld officers to capture me. They bound my hands and feet, stuffed cotton in my mouth—I nearly died.”

Master Tang had thus narrowly escaped one great trial, and to this day remains among the living.

The Iron-Crowned Daoist said: “The efficacy of the ritual water is the efficacy of the official generals. The Maoshan method says: ‘Daoist magic need not be many; the Southern Star pierces the Northern River. All come to one character, to subdue all demons of the world.’ This character is the Purple Tenuity incantation. The Great Emperor of the Purple Tenuity reigns supreme at the North Pole, the father and lord of all stars. He also manifests as the Great Emperor of Fengdu, who governs the ghosts and spirits of Fengdu, commanding thousands of officers and countless troops. Those who cultivate the dao and study the methods, if they can skillfully wield a single Purple Tenuity incantation, many matters can be resolved. Patriarch Bai Yuchan said: ‘Now one need only wear a single talisman, hold a single office, practice a single method, and judge a single bureau’s writings. Before the officers of that bureau, one uses but one talisman and one bowl of water. It is merely the meeting of heart and spirit; when used, it is efficacious. Just like a true dragon: but a single drop of water can become a torrential flood. Why then use so many complicated things?’”
