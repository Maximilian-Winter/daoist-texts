# Yuan Guizhen’s Ritual Refinement of the Yellow Spirit Yue Seal: A Verified Miracle

There was a man named Zhang Rang, a native of Guizhou, who wandered through the lands of Hunan and Hubei. He was struck by a malady of the heart and mind. At first, his memory faltered—on the road, he would forget how to walk; within his own home, he forgot how to sit down. Sometimes he could no longer distinguish dawn from dusk, losing all sense of direction.

After more than a month, his condition worsened. His temperament turned fierce and violent; at the slightest provocation, he would erupt in rage, cursing ghosts and spirits with furious shouts, unsettling all those around him. He often ran about naked, utterly unaware of shame or modesty. His spirit was in chaos. Though frequently burned and cut, he showed no fear when touching blazing fire or sharp blades.

The Daoist Yuan Guizhen carved a Yellow Spirit Yue Seal. After performing the consecration rites of fasting and incense offerings to open the seal’s power, he prayed to the numinous beings, eager to test the efficacy of this talisman.

At that very moment, Zhang Rang was running madly, wild as a storm. He was seized, and the seal was pressed upon his chest and back. The man, once so frenzied, instantly fell into a deep slumber.

Yuan Guizhen knew then: the power of the seal had taken effect. He lit a pillar of cinnabar incense and stamped the seal once more upon Zhang Rang’s chest. Suddenly, the illness vanished.

From Zhang Rang’s mouth flew a black bird, soaring several dozen paces before falling dead to the ground. Curious onlookers gathered and saw—it was a great bat. On its back, the characters of the Yellow Spirit Seal were clearly inscribed.

From that day forth, Zhang Rang was restored to normal.

Yuan Guizhen took this divine seal and used it to aid others harmed by malevolent spirits, achieving great spiritual efficacy.
