# The Record of Shen Aiying from Heilongjiang Paying Homage to the Primordial Lady of the Azure Clouds

Shen Aiying, a native of Jiamusi in Heilongjiang, had been married for many years without bearing children. Once she became pregnant, but within a few months the pregnancy was lost. She sought doctors and medicines far and wide; some said it was due to inflammation of the womb, others claimed the husband’s vitality was weak—various explanations abounded. Time passed, and she was nearing thirty without any sign of new life. Her household grew deeply anxious.

One year, Shen Aiying traveled to Dandong. Hearing that the Puji Palace there was a sacred Daoist site, renowned for its numinous efficacy, she went with friends to burn incense and pay respects to the gods. Shen Aiying’s heart was filled with yearning for offspring; after the worship, she drew a lot. The lot’s verse read:

> “Last night the east garden was lashed by wild winds,  
> All the myriad purples and reds were swept away.  
> Luckily, a tender-hearted one rose early,  
> Nurturing the roots, life is replanted anew.”

The Daoist priest who interpreted the lot asked, “What matter do you inquire about?” Shen replied, “I ask concerning children.”

The priest said, “According to the lot, children are hard to come by. The myriad blossoms have been blown away by the fierce wind. Yet there remains a slender thread of life; one must find the tender-hearted who cherish the flowers, nurture the roots, and restore life.”

Shen bowed deeply and said, “The spirit mediums say that in my past life I committed many offenses, causing difficulty in having children this life. I often recite the *Sutra of the Earth Store Bodhisattva* to deliver them, but the effect is faint. I beseech the Daoist priest’s compassion to guide me—how might I resolve this?”

The priest replied, “The Great Emperor of the Eastern Peak of Mount Tai governs the karmic retribution of spirits, judging good and evil. The Primordial Lady of the Azure Clouds of Mount Tai is the deity who grants children. Your matter requires paying homage to the Eastern Peak, confessing your sins, and worshipping the Primordial Lady of the Azure Clouds to beseech offspring. Moreover, there is the Daoist *Scripture of the Three Officials*, which pardons human sins and liberates departed souls, bestowing boundless merit. You must diligently recite it.”

Shen expressed profound thanks. From then on, she vowed to make pilgrimage to Mount Tai. Her family strongly opposed, deeming it unnecessary, but Shen was resolute.

In the seventh month of that year, Shen arrived at Taian in Shandong. She fasted and purified herself, preparing to pay homage to Mount Tai. Determined, she began her pilgrimage at the gate of the Dai Temple, performing a kowtow every three steps, chanting the sacred name of the Great Emperor of the Eastern Peak with each step, slowly advancing to repent her past offenses. Seeing this, some attendants hurried over to dissuade her, saying, “In this scorching heat, you should rest first.” Shen shook her head and continued her prostrations forward, hoping the august power of the Eastern Peak would witness her sincere repentance. After worshipping at the Dai Temple, the next day she ascended Mount Tai to pay homage at the shrine of the Primordial Lady of the Azure Clouds.

But fate was unkind: the mountain cable car broke down. Shen walked up from the foot of the mountain, taking five or six hours on foot. Arriving at the shrine, she kowtowed and begged for forgiveness, hoping the Primordial Lady would have mercy and grant her offspring. Having completed her pilgrimage, Shen returned to Heilongjiang.

Not long after, about three months later, Shen dreamt of a celestial maiden descending from the heavens. Her bearing was extraordinary, clad in a gauzy skirt, crowned with a phoenix headdress. Attended by maidens, one dressed in blue held a purple book pouch; another in red cradled an infant. Countless celestial officials and soldiers bore banners and standards, surrounding her in solemn procession. The maiden spoke:

“I am the Primordial Lady of the Azure Clouds of Mount Tai. In your past life, your karmic offenses of killing were grave. The Eastern Peak judges clearly between good and evil, hence your difficulty in having children this life. Yet your sincere repentance has moved the divine spirits. By the merit of the *Scripture of the Three Officials*, enmities are forever released, and the living and the dead are separated. The Eastern Peak has erased your black record and restored your birth registry. I now come to deliver to you a qilin child. From this moment forth, you must strive diligently.”

With these words, the maiden commanded the red-clad attendant to place the infant into Shen’s womb, then she vanished like a drifting cloud.

Soon after, Shen became pregnant. The following year she gave birth to a son, deeply grateful for the grace of Mount Tai. She vowed again to cast and print images of the Eastern Peak and the Azure Cloud treasures, offering them to the Ten Directions in thanks for the divine favor.
