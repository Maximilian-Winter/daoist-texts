# The Immortal Bestowal of Healing Arts upon Wang Guoquan of Shiyan

Wang Guoquan, a native of Shahedian in Fang County, Shiyan, Hubei, was an unassuming old bachelor—seemingly ordinary in every way. Yet, his skill in healing was extraordinary beyond measure. Remarkably, he required no medicine, no acupuncture; only a single bowl of water. Lighting three incense sticks, he would face north in solemn prayer, intoning sacred incantations and tracing talismanic diagrams. Then, the patient would drink the water thus consecrated. More often than not, they would be completely cured.

In a nearby village, a man stricken with cancer sought Wang Guoquan’s aid. Wang told him, “About five li to the northeast of your home lies the grave of a woman. She died from a contraceptive procedure some twenty years past. When you travel, you have unwittingly offended her spirit.” The man returned home and inquired among the village elders, who confirmed that indeed such a woman was buried there.

Another came, plagued by inexplicable headaches. Wang said, “When you were by the river, you disturbed the restless soul of one drowned.” It turned out a man had drowned in the river, unclaimed by kin, and the authorities had buried the body by the riverbank. Tales like these were many.

Tang Peng, a practitioner of traditional medicine and Wang’s cousin, had graduated from a formal medical academy but harbored a fondness for the mysterious arts. Eager to learn Wang’s secret, he invited him to a feast, laying out a table heavy with wine and meat.

Suspecting the use of the ancient zhuyou healing arts, Tang produced his family’s ancestral zhuyou medical texts for Wang to examine. Wang glanced over them and said, “This is a fine book, but I cannot understand it.” Puzzled, Tang asked from whom Wang had learned his healing craft.

At first, Wang hesitated, mumbling evasively. After downing a jin of white liquor, he confided to Tang, “I once dreamed of an old man with a white beard, who offered me a bowl of water. The water was bitter and thick; I could drink only half before I could drink no more. When I awoke, I found I could heal.”

“Now, looking back, I regret not drinking the entire bowl. Had I done so, I could have stayed home and healed without wandering about.” Only then did Tang realize that Wang Guoquan’s healing art was a divine gift from an immortal, not a skill to be learned by ordinary means.
