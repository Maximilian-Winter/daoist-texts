# The Jade Emperor of Culture Urges Reverence for Written Words and Paper

The Jade Emperor of Culture, also known as the Emperor of Zitong, is the divine sovereign presiding over the fortunes of literature and the examinations. In ancient times, scholars who aspired to succeed in the imperial civil service examinations held him in profound veneration. Often paired with the Martial Emperor Guan, these two deities—one of letters, the other of valor—stand as twin pillars not only within Daoism but also as enduring emblems of Chinese culture itself. In the southern lands, the faith in the Jade Emperor of Culture flourished mightily, giving rise to the saying: “Confucius in the North, the Jade Emperor of Culture in the South.” Among Daoism’s treasured scriptures urging virtue are three renowned classics, widely embraced by society and revered as the Three Sacred Scriptures: the *Scripture of the Most High’s Responsive Manifestations*, the *Yinzhi Scripture of the Jade Emperor of Culture*, and the *Awakening Scripture of the Martial Emperor Guan*. Beyond the *Yinzhi Scripture*, the Jade Emperor of Culture authored many other exhortations to goodness, such as the *Exhortation to Filial Piety*, the *Merit and Demerit Register*, and the *Ten Precepts by the Banana Window*, each guiding the world toward moral refinement.

As the sovereign of cultural education, the Jade Emperor of Culture places special emphasis on urging people to cherish and respect written words and the paper that bears them. This is the heart of scriptures like the *Exhortation to Reverence for Written Words*, the *True Explanation of Cherishing Words*, and the *Twenty-Four Rules of Merit for Cherishing Written Words*, all woven around this sacred theme.

Words are sacred and exalted; characters inscribed upon paper must never be profaned or treated lightly. To honor and cherish written words brings forth blessings of wealth, longevity, and prosperity. Conversely, to disrespect the paper that carries these characters invites poverty, premature death, and heavenly retribution. Those who revere written words may enjoy long life and abundant riches, their descendants rising to honor and fame. Especially for those scholars preparing for the imperial examinations, such reverence is the key to success and distinction. Yet those who disdain or neglect the written word risk calamities and afflictions both in life and beyond. Naturally, the words worthy of such reverence must be upright and in harmony with moral principles; as for strange, licentious, or corrupt writings, these must be promptly consigned to the flames.

Paper inscribed with words must never be casually discarded, trampled underfoot, or used to patch windows and doors. Nor should it be mixed with other refuse. Even when the paper is worn or discarded, it must be burned with sincere respect and reverence. Thus, in many regions, structures such as “Pavilions of Cherishing Words” and “Towers of Cherishing Words” have been erected expressly for the ritual burning of books and written paper. On appointed days, ceremonies gather these precious remnants, consigning the ashes to rivers and streams, returning the words to the flow of nature. In some places, “Societies for Cherishing Words” form, parading lanterns inscribed with calls to treasure written words, collecting discarded paper from the streets, and regularly purchasing old books and waste paper for respectful disposal.

The Chinese script is vast and profound, its origins stretching back through the ages. Cangjie, the legendary creator of Chinese characters, was hailed by Fuxi as the Grand Historian and later worshipped as a divine figure. Temples dedicated to Cangjie stand in many places. It was through Cangjie’s invention of writing that history was born, enabling the recording and illuminating of past events, thus bringing forth the governance of culture. Moreover, Cangjie’s creation of characters moved Heaven itself, which sent down grains of food. These were discovered by the Divine Farmer, who then widely cultivated them, spreading sustenance throughout the world. This mythic tale reveals the exalted place of writing within Chinese culture.

Writing is the vessel of culture; through the Chinese characters, the culture has endured for millennia and blossomed forth. To cherish written words and to guide people to protect books holds profound and positive significance for preserving ancient texts and transmitting traditional culture. In this age of computers and networks, when many rely on digital devices for work and study and often suffer from the forgetfulness of pen and brush, the Jade Emperor of Culture’s teaching to honor and respect the written word carries a powerful and timely message.
