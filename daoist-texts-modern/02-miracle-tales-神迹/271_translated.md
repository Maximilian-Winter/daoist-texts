# The Story of a Certain Master Who Seized the Temple’s Foundation

In these past few days, there came a fasting devotee whose body was frail and ill. He had sought many doctors, yet none could bring relief. A friend, hearing of his plight, introduced him to us for assistance. Observing his complexion and spirit, I said: “Your family’s ancestors have committed the grave sin of taking life.”

He pondered deeply and then spoke: “Indeed, the elders in our household once killed two birds. Why were those two birds slain? It was in the days when our family moved the ancestral tombs, choosing a place of excellent feng shui. The ancestral grave was reburied there. On the day of interment, two birds chirped loudly nearby. The elder, skilled in marksmanship, took up his birdshot gun and shot them down.”

“Since that time,” he continued, “the elder’s health declined. Later, when the elder passed away, my own body also weakened. Though I conduct some business and have wealth, I remain unmarried, now approaching fifty years of age.”

I said to him: “You have taken possession of the temple’s land. Those two birds were likely messengers of the temple’s numinous deities, warning your family not to bury the dead in this place. Alas, they were slain by your kin, and thus this karmic retribution has come upon you.”

I urged him to make a great vow, striving henceforth to restore the temple to its former glory, for only then can this cause and effect be resolved. The foundation of a temple’s land must never be seized lightly. One must always hold a heart of reverence and awe.
