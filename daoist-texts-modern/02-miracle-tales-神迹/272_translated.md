# When the Dao Master Remembered the Shoes Left Out in the Sun While Performing Transcendence

Once, the Dao Master long engaged in the sacred rite of transcendence suddenly recalled the shoes left out drying in the sun.

I had heard from an elder adept a curious tale. It was said that a high merit master, while conducting a rite to deliver the departed, was offering food to the spirits. In the midst of this solemn act, he suddenly remembered that the shoes left outside to dry had not yet been brought in. Upon returning after the ritual, he found that the scattered rice grains and bits of steamed bread thrown out as offerings had all gathered inside those very shoes.

This story teaches us a vital truth: when performing transcendence, one must not let the mind wander heedlessly. Some may find this incredible, yet there is sound reasoning behind it.

What we now call transcendence is in truth “sacrificial refining.” Sacrifice is sacrifice, refining is refining. We sacrifice to the ghosts and spirits, and refine our own numinous energy. The *Dao Fa Hui Yuan* says: “Ghosts and spirits originally have no form or shape, only a single thought.” It continues: “Deluded thoughts do not arise from nothing; karma is not absent; there is indeed the matter of rising and sinking. One must use this clear and pure heart to transform their clinging views.”

Ghosts and spirits are but a single thought, a transformation of spiritual energy. Because of greed, anger, ignorance, and desire, they suffer the torment of stagnation. The method of sacrificial refining is to use my own yang qi to illuminate and transform their yin qi. When the master performs sacrificial refining, he must hold in mind the area below the navel as Fengdu Hell, from which the ghosts emerge. The heart’s location is the Southern Prosperity Upper Palace, the Vermilion Mound Fire Mansion; the Mud Pellet Brain Palace transforms into the Compassionate Venerable of Great Unity. During the rite, the ghosts are summoned and pass through the Vermilion Mound Fire Mansion to be refined and delivered, then ascend to the Mud Pellet. The Heavenly Venerable of Great Unity, Savior from Suffering, receives the departed, who rise soaring into the heavens.

The entire process, the efficacy of the rite, depends wholly on the master’s focused mind. Thus the Patriarch says: “First, one must cultivate in oneself a great heart of compassion, protection, transcendence, and rescue. Not knowing where I end and ghosts begin, ghosts and I forget each other—this is the essential mystery. Do not be impatient or let sudden restlessness arise. Such empty toil will come to nothing and fail to transcend. In stillness and clarity, if this single thought moves, the ghosts take it as real and follow the illusion of the mind. If I think of liberation, they too are liberated. When this reaches the ultimate Dao, they also delight in the Dao. In the depths of darkness, it is thus perfectly clear.”

Because the sacrificial refining method depends entirely on the master’s spiritual focus, the fire that refines the departed, the bathing, and the food offerings all exist within the master’s own practice. What the ghosts perceive is but the master’s numinous awareness manifesting illusions. If the master’s mind is filled with boundless nectar-like spiritual food, the ghosts and spirits are all nourished and satisfied. But if the master’s mind wanders—say, to the shoes left drying outside—then naturally the ghosts receive that very image. It is no wonder that the scattered rice grains fall into the shoes the master was thinking of.

The sacrificial refining altar may seem to be a place for refining ghosts and spirits, yet how is it not also the master’s own path of self-cultivation? Hence the Patriarch says: “Sacrificial refining is sacrifice to the ghosts and spirits, refining is refinement of oneself.”
