# Fishing Two Carp and Ending Up Conducting a Daoist Ritual for a Full Day

There was a lay devotee, a resident of the temple, who enjoyed fishing in his leisure time. A few days ago, he caught two large carp, each about sixty centimeters long. It took great effort to land them.

The carp rested in a basin, nodding their heads incessantly, as if performing kowtows.

A companion urged him, “Carp always face the Northern Dipper; you should release them.” But the devotee replied, “That won’t do—I’ve caught them with such difficulty.”

On the way home, the carriage nearly overturned. Upon entering his house, the yellow dog kept its distance, barking wildly at the fish basin. The companion laughed, “Even the dog wants to eat the fish today.”

That night, the devotee stewed the fish in an iron pot, turning them into a meal. In his dream that very night, two figures clad in red came to claim his life. The next day, his mouth began to ache unbearably, slowly festering and ulcerating. Even after visiting the hospital, there was no remedy.

In desperation, he sought out a Daoist master. The master said, “These two carp have cultivated for many years and are nearly perfected spirits. Today, having been caught and killed by you, they harbor resentment and have come to seek vengeance. You must hold a ritual, burning many golden and silver ingots, to properly send them on their way.”

The man was greatly frightened and said, “I will follow your instructions.”

Thus, a Daoist ritual was arranged to pacify the resentful souls and guide them along the cloud path of rebirth. He also performed the full recitation of the *Three Origins Precious Repentance Sutra*, confessing his sins and releasing the grudges. From then on, his condition gradually improved.

Animals cultivating the dao face great hardship, always fearing capture and death. In the *Legend of the White Snake*, the white snake was saved by a cowherd boy. Though the carp’s capture was a calamity, if the fisherman had shown compassion and released them, the carp’s dao cultivation would have advanced, and the fisherman himself would have accumulated merit. Would that not be beautiful? Therefore, in daily life, we must cherish kind thoughts and widely foster good affinities.
