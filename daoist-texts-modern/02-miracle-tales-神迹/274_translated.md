# Layman Chen of Shanghai Entangled in Years of Illness

The *Analects* record: Confucius fell ill, and Zilu requested to offer prayers. Confucius said, “Is there such a thing?” Zilu replied, “There is. The ancient texts say: ‘Pray to the spirits above and below.’” Confucius said, “I have prayed for a long time already.”

It is said that Confucius became ill, and Zilu asked to pray for him. Confucius responded, “Is that really an option?” Zilu answered, “The ancient writings instruct us to pray to the spirits of Heaven above and Earth below.” Confucius replied, “I have been praying for quite a while.” This clearly shows that in our land, whenever illness strikes, it is common to seek aid from ghosts and spirits.

Now, there is a certain Layman Chen in Shanghai who, several years ago, began to be beset by lingering illness. He consulted both traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine, yet found no remedy. His heart grew heavy with sorrow, his emotions blocked, and he even teetered on the edge of depression.

Later, a physician took his pulse and found it “sometimes large, sometimes small; sometimes long, sometimes short,” resembling the ghostly pulse described in ancient texts. Moreover, this year’s Qingming Festival, due to the pandemic, he was unable to visit ancestral graves for offerings. At night, he often dreamed of his departed parents seeking him out, his soul and dreams confused and reversed, greatly disturbing his work and life. So, he sought out a “master” online, hoping the “master” could find a solution. The “master” charged him eight thousand eight hundred yuan and performed rituals for a whole day in his apartment building. Yet the effect remained poor.

Coincidentally, the doctor was also a devotee of Daoist culture. Unable to bear it any longer, he introduced Chen to a small temple. Hearing this, I understood his anxious heart. But fearing his hopes might be too high—and what if it failed? After all, matters of ghosts and spirits are profound beyond measure, not something we can fully grasp. So I told him: “We only promise to perform according to the scriptures and the transmission. But whether it works, we do not guarantee.” He understood.

By chance, the next day there was a ritual for the deliverance of the dead, so I wrote a summons document for him on the spot. With the clanging of bells and gongs, the ritual proceeded as scheduled. Just after issuing the summons and preparing to recite the *Scripture of Deliverance*, Layman Chen sent me a WeChat message: “Thank you, Master. I already feel my body is better.” The next day at his follow-up, the doctor examined him and then messaged me: “Your method is quite miraculous. Today, when I checked his ghostly pulse, it had improved by two-thirds.”

The famed physician Zheng Qin’an said in *True Transmission of Medical Principles*: “In every household, illness is the hardest to avoid. If the affliction is light, medicine can heal. But if it is too heavy, lasting three years or two, medicine is powerless. Such illness arises either from the entanglement of sins and grudges from past lives or from failure to restrain oneself in this life, accumulating offenses and faults. For those who are fathers, sons, younger brothers, elder brothers, or husbands, it is urgent to turn inward and cultivate virtue, to perform many good deeds. Some abstain from eating beef and dog meat for life; some observe family fasts honoring the Nine Emperors; some buy fish or other creatures to release them; some donate coffins or repair roads—practices done at opportune times to amass vast hidden merit. With sincere fasting and purification, heartfelt repentance and prayers for grace, petitions to relieve calamities and dispel disasters, first presented to the Central Palace, then to the City God, then to the Great Emperor of the Eastern Peak, and burned in the open air, one may turn danger into safety. I have often taught this method, with repeated success, as a supplement where medicine falls short.”
