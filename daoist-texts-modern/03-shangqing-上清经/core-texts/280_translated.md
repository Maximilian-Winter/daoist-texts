To receive the secret instructions of the Grand Cavern, where the Cavern One and the Supreme Dao of the Feminine One unite in transformation, one must first recite the Sovereign Emperor’s Supreme Vows and the Mysterious Mother’s Eightfold Golden Flower Hidden Text. This is the forbidden scripture held in the bosom of the Emperor of the Nine Heavens. When transmitting it to disciples, one must first announce a fast—one day before and one day after—and then observe a pure fast for one hundred days before it may be entrusted. The middle fast lasts seventy days, the lower fast thirty-nine days; fasting is rigorous and austere, and the transmission is made in this manner. Should the person be unworthy, transmitting without fasting, the scripture master shall die, and the recipient lose both clarity of vision. If the fast is not severe enough, the scripture master shall fall ill, and the recipient lose speech. The burden lies heavier on the scripture master, guarding against careless reading; calamities fall upon disciples, so one must be cautious with mouth and eyes. Grave offenses bring disaster across seven generations; afflictions bind in the realm of the dead.

If one obtains this scripture, receiving and practicing it must be without fault, slackness, or substitution; the covenant of proclamation is exactly as in the highest methods. Feed the scripture master during the three fasts as if serving lord and father. Consult the hidden chamber in the quiet forest as if no one dwells there. Preserve the five spirits in the purple chamber as if the true numinous were present. If not a lord, master, father, or son, do not bestow it; this reveals the use of the subtle and true, making clear the difficulty of guarding the prohibition against violation. If not a lord, master, father, or son’s chamber, do not enter it; this shows the restraint of the foot from wandering, clarifying the embrace of seclusion and unity. If not a lord, master, father, or son’s garment, do not wear it; this shows the heavenly kinship’s admonition against excess, revealing the fullness that cuts itself off.

Refine the wondrous awareness of heavenly essence, sever the near thoughts of myriad entanglements, and reach a practice that manifests in hardship, leaving no trace akin to no light. Three meals suffice by mountain streams, sincerity cloaked in secrecy as one proceeds. Then the voice rushes to the chamber of the Five Elders, virtue rises above the Three Pure Ones, inner concentration is preserved in the bright jade, keeping garments fresh and unsoiled. Reflect on the Three Primes in the mud pellet, guard the Nine Truths in the form’s dwelling, exhale and inhale the Five Flowers, breathe the jade liquid, seek immortality morning and evening in the void’s sameness, awaken and rest opening spirit in the Great Desert, diligent without weariness, earnest without release. Such a person may begin to speak of the Grand Cavern’s gate, to anticipate the wondrous imaginings of the Dao. Those who serve it ascend the Three Mornings and roam the Great Firmament; those who violate it sink into the Three Springs and enter the Great Profound.

Those who transmit must cause the scripture and secret instructions to emerge twice, not bestowing all at once. First, the method and secret are given so that the disciple may practice and preserve reflection, refine the five forms, recall the purple chamber, dispel turbid emotions, focus on chastity and embrace unity, awaiting the spirit day and night. Thus the Great Elixir is hidden and mysterious, called the *Golden Flower Scripture*, the Three Primes Jade Morn—this is the Feminine One Essence. According to cultivation, after three years of preserving and refining the Feminine One, one then obtains the right to recite the *Grand Cavern True Scripture Thirty-Nine Chapters*. Now, receiving this secret, one may also practice it; practicing the secret surely attains numinous immortals, without necessarily holding the entire *Grand Cavern True Scripture* to understand it fully.

When the feeling of sincerity is firm, and the true is matched to the vision, the Three Primes appear. Upon receiving this scripture, the mysterious void descends and bestows, the Huang-Lao talisman is revealed, spirit is moved and light summoned, the Five Elders scatter blossoms, receiving the text in the void, one immediately ascends the Great Nothingness.

The Sovereign Emperor’s Twelve Vows are titled: Vow Heaven, Vow Earth, Vow Wind, Vow Cloud, Vow Yin, Vow Yang, Vow Great Void, Vow Great Nothingness, Vow Great Emptiness, Vow Great Existence, Vow Self-Generation, Vow Birth of Spirit.  
The Mysterious Mother’s Eightfold Gates in the Sequence of Movements are titled: “May the Mysterious Mother be born with me amid the vital breath; may she exist with me between sun and moon; may she protect me among the Nine Heavens; may she eat with me in the natural realm; may she drink with me by the Gourd River; may she rest with me in the Jade Truth; may she sleep with me in the Immortal Hall; may she roam with me among the Three Mysteries.”

The omen lies in a separate chamber, always reading this scripture, never forgetting even a moment—this is the inner vow to the Sovereign Emperor, opening the benevolent Eightfold Gates. Now, the Immortals of the Five Sacred Mountains and the fairy maidens of Divine China still sip jade nectar and taste precious fruits, proclaiming great vows, presenting the Eightfold Gates, awaiting the Primordial Essence, serving the Three Primes, aspiring to the morning sky, becoming jade truths, extracting seven generations, entering the Vast Cold—how much less so the vulgar and base of the world, the subtle and lowly of the Five Turbidities? Surely one must replace and cultivate; hearing but not doing—how can that be?

Though form and spirit are refined and suffer in birth and rebirth, if seven generations bear guilt and do not understand, they themselves have no hope of immortality. Therefore, one must open the great vows, present the Eightfold Gates, to release accumulated knots. Once the seven tests are blessed, the omen may escape death; those who do not die gain the root of the Dao, the origin of immortality. Those who aspire to this work—can they not strive diligently for long-lasting preservation?

### The Great Whirling Wind Grand Mixed Sovereign One’s Dao of Cultivation and Preservation: Nine Diagrams

To cultivate this scripture, first complete the name of the blessing, then close both eyes, preserve all hundred spirits transforming into white qi, like smoke of the ear, coming from the mysterious void into the mouth, lingering thickly for a long time. Then feel the white qi descend, exiting from the lower orifices, also from the jade phallus orifice. Again feel the white qi issuing from the soles of the feet and palms, encircling and binding the whole body, head to foot, hands and feet, mixing into one body.

![](/media/202305/2023-05-09_170114_0759960.4130832838634778.png)  
Moving with the white qi like smoke up and down, unseen to the eye.

![](/media/202305/2023-05-09_170123_3473020.6441306240432735.png)  
After a long while, the white qi suddenly changes color, becoming dense purple clouds, again entering my mouth into the head, reaching the five viscera, filling the abdomen.

![](/media/202305/2023-05-09_170128_7838230.8191262039294841.png)  
After a long while, the purple clouds again issue from the soles of the feet, palms, great orifice, and jade phallus orifice, circling and binding the whole body.

![](/media/202305/2023-05-09_170138_0026600.5703383784966397.png)  
After a long while, dense and full, moving up and down, merging with the purple clouds in form, unseen to the eye.

![](/media/202305/2023-05-09_170144_5012730.27860402200214796.png)  
In a moment, preserving the qi of the purple clouds, filling left and right and the entire chamber, then seeing a fan of wind qi issuing from the mouth, the smoke of the purple clouds turning back, intertwining and knotting.

![](/media/202305/2023-05-09_170155_4859380.4629117323623554.png)  
Suddenly forming a true person, male form, the state of first birth, four cun tall, called the Grand Cavern Sovereign One Honored Lord, named Father Ningzai, styled Mother Essence United, the guardian of the death gate gods, whirling wind mixing together, jointly forming the Sovereign One Honored Lord.

![](/media/202305/2023-05-09_170202_9756550.7593995263066019.png)  
Again preserving this Honored Lord, entering my mouth beneath the tongue, then ascending straight from under the tongue to the purple chamber of the Six Harmonies Palace, sitting calmly, facing outward the Honored Lord, left hand holding the five registers of omens, right hand holding the five talismans of omens. To the left of the Honored Lord’s mouth is sunlight, nine cun in diameter; to the right is moonlight, one cun in diameter. The Honored Lord’s tongue exhales the whirling wind qi, blowing upon the sunlight and moonlight, all dense and flourishing, sometimes white, sometimes red, causing the light qi to descend into the five viscera, six bowels, and a hundred joints, throughout the body, penetrating and bright, inside and out like the brightness of the sun. After a long while, forgetting the body, suddenly the matter is complete.

This diagram roughly paints the image between the eyebrows, as preserved in the eighth diagram, large in the purple chamber of the Six Harmonies Palace, that is the mud pellet palace, the Six Harmonies.

![](/media/202305/2023-05-09_170216_5441510.4450766068166174.png)  
Then the heart utters the vow:

Grand Cavern Sovereign One, Primordial Essence Honored Spirit, Father Ning, Mother Essence, two united forming the pair, hundred truths great chaos, one cycle of first birth, body bound by eight smokes, transforming fetal original infant, sun and moon treasure light, illuminating my form, Supreme One above, merging with the emperor, mud pellet guarding the jade, five viscera splendid and bright, long united with sun and moon, holding the cavern scripture, position as immortal elder, spirit ascending Supreme Clarity, thirty-nine chapters, golden talisman feather court.

This is the Great Whirling Wind Grand Mixed Sovereign One’s Dao, complete. Ten thousand transformations and a hundred changes, the method of Cavern Truth Supreme One, all exhausted herein.

Every evening preserve the Grand Cavern Sovereign One Honored Lord beneath the nose, in the center of the philtrum, always present in the mouth above the upper teeth, wrapped beneath the nose and upper lip of the philtrum. The Honored Lord’s form always faces outward, sitting, standing, moving, residing in intention. Preserve the Honored Lord holding sunlight in the mouth, nine cun in diameter, shining bright ten thousand zhang, illuminating the body of the omen. The One is the true One of the emperor. The One’s transformations return to the One. When reading the *Grand Cavern True Scripture*, also preserve the Sovereign One Honored Lord before the omen’s face, with the honored spirit’s mouth facing the omen’s mouth, allowing mutual facing, listening to my reading of the cavern scripture’s voice, dispersing the knots of seven generations.

The Sovereign One Honored Lord, named Father Ningzai, styled Mother Essence United, day and night remember and never forget, warding off ten thousand trials, extinguishing a thousand calamities, removing evil demons, bringing forth numinous immortals. If the body of the omen has pain or unrest, quickly preserve the Sovereign One Honored Lord, causing the mouth to exhale sunlight white qi, fumigating the painful place, the pain immediately cured.

The Sovereign One Honored Lord appears as a newborn male, unclothed, body four cun long. This is the great chaos reversing the fetus, the true form of first shape.

### Grand Cavern Inner Method of Cultivation and Preservation of the True Unity of Feminine and Masculine: Thirteen Diagrams

According to the Nine Palaces front and back, each palace is hidden from the other, facing and back shadows cannot be seen, making it difficult to paint a proper frontal image. Now arranged in sequence, all on the right side, drawing a frontal image would sink it; drawing a profile would cause the image to be imagined askew. Please preserve the true spirits of each palace, all facing forward sitting upright, among them three truths, that is two truths facing each other, as if in secluded annotation. The head inch and the bright hall together make one inch; though drawn frontally, it is still on the right side. Detailed and precise preservation and use, as in the scripture for nine years, ascending to Heaven in broad daylight.
