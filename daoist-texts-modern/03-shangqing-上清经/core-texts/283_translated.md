### Scripture of the Cavern of Truth, Supreme Clarity, Opening Heaven’s Three Charts and the Seven Stars’ Transit — Scroll One

**The Method of Transiting Death and Crossing to Life to Preserve Immortality**

The Heavenly Pass is the Gate of Birth in the Nine Heavens. It governs the southeast corner of the Nine Heavens, also called the Heavenly Chart and the Heavenly Pass, thus known as the Three Passes. It is the path all perfected beings traverse, the journey all immortals experience, and the gateway all seekers follow. It lies five thousand li from the Golden Palace, seven thousand li from the Jade Clarity Upper Palace. To pierce the Three Passes is to ascend to the Golden Palace and roam the Jade Clarity.

The First Heavenly Pass bears nine tiers of jade terraces, rising one thousand two hundred zhang above the earth. Below, thousands of long serpents, flying dragons, and venomous beasts guard the jade gate. Three thousand giant warriors stand ready, all clad in interlocking golden armor, holding mighty halberds at the gate’s edge. The Jade Dawn Overseer of the Great Void, styled “Xu Shangming,” dwells atop the jade terrace. Flying clouds and flowing rosy mists flank his chamber, sun and moon’s dark radiance illuminate it, shining through the jade clarity. Three hundred true immortals attend him, and he commands the coming and going of the upper immortals, opening and closing the gate.

The Second Heavenly Pass holds six tiers of jade terraces, nine hundred zhang high. Below it, thousands of long serpents, flying dragons, and venomous beasts stand guard, alongside three thousand giant warriors clad in interlocking golden armor flanking the gate’s two sides. The Supreme Overseer, True Jade Gentleman, styled “Lang Bo,” is stationed atop the jade terrace. Red clouds and purple canopies envelop his chamber, mysterious light of sun and moon reflects within. Three hundred true immortals serve him; he supervises the passage of the gathered perfected beings as they roam and feast.

The Third Heavenly Pass has three tiers of jade terraces, six hundred zhang high. Below, thousands of long serpents, flying dragons, and venomous beasts guard the jade gate, with three thousand giant warriors clad in interlocking golden armor standing sentinel on both flanks. The Supreme Emperor Overseer, True Jade Officer, styled “Tian Changsheng,” guards the jade terrace. Dark clouds cover its summit, ethereal smoke perfumes the courtyard, his form glows with self-illumination. Three hundred true immortals attend him. He oversees the upper heavenly perfected beings and the lower earthly beings, keeping the registers and records of the gate.

Whoever receives the Way of Casting the Golden Tablet and Jade Name must cultivate the method of piercing the Heavenly Pass gates. Always, morning and evening, enter the chamber, burn incense, knock the teeth twelve times to open the passages, face east and bow the heart to the four directions, holding in mind the ends of the Nine Heavens beneath the Three Passes, seeing their forms clearly and distinctly. When all is complete, next hold in thought the seven stars above in heaven, moving with the cycles, my body riding on the heavenly pass star, the seven stars moving my body, until beneath the jade terrace of the Heavenly Pass. Then cast down a jade tally, announcing my name to the Jade Dawn Overseer of the Great Void, who receives the tally and records it on the jade frame, permitting my body to pass beneath the Heavenly Pass.

Next, hold my body again upon the seven stars, the seven stars moving me to the jade terrace beneath the Heavenly Chart. Cast down a jade tally, announcing myself to the Supreme Overseer, True Jade Gentleman, who receives the tally and records it on the jade frame, permitting my body to pass beneath the Heavenly Pass.

Next, hold my body again upon the seven stars, the seven stars moving me to the jade terrace beneath the Heavenly Pass. Cast down a jade tally, announcing myself to the Supreme Emperor Overseer, True Jade Officer, who receives the tally and records it on the jade frame, permitting my body to pass beneath the Golden Palace and the Jade Clarity Palace.

Next, lose sight of the seven stars, my body floating above the empty mystery, in the vast abyss with no support or sight. In a moment, I awaken atop the Golden Palace, the Jade Capital, at the Golden Gate. Cast down a golden tally, seeing the Four Extremities True Person holding a jade desk receiving the tally, entering to report before the Golden Palace Emperor Lord. The Four Extremities True Person replies, and together we ascend to Jade Clarity.

Next, hold my body atop Jade Clarity, the Four Extremities vast and boundless with no edge, only verdant qi thick and lush. Looking up, no heaven; looking down, no earth. Only the central golden gate with four passages, inside are jade officials and jade trees, golden branches sprouting on both sides, giant dragons and beasts playing upon the summit. I hold my body roaming among them for a long time, feeling like sleep, returning to my resting form, body feeling hazy and indistinct, as if treading on empty space. Holding this roaming complete, I knock the teeth sixteen times, raise my head and recite the incantation:

> Three Radiant Treasures shine,  
> Jade Capital opens bright,  
> Mysterious brilliance spreads,  
> Reflecting the unseen overseer,  
> Golden tablets record the words,  
> Names announced in jade,  
> Clearly seeing the Nine Heavens,  
> Playing among the Three Pure Ones,  
> Heavenly Pass’s Three Charts,  
> Returning to the Purple Court,  
> Receiving titles at the Golden Palace,  
> East’s splendor records life,  
> Riding the Eight Scenes,  
> Driving the flying carriage.  
> Complete. Swallow the qi nine times and cease.

All who study but do not know how to pierce the Heavenly Pass gates, nor the method of announcing names by tablet and tally, will never succeed. The Three Passes govern all the heavens and earth, the upper perfected immortals, and the registers of beginners; none pass without crossing the Three Passes. All diligent students who can obtain a jade name in the Nine Heavens’ Three Passes, with the Three Passes’ Jade Dawn announcing it before the Most High Supreme Emperor’s palace, the Emperor Lord will send twelve jade boys and twelve jade girls to guard the body. This is the supreme chapter of the Great Emperor, passed to the Heavenly Emperor Lord, who passes it to the Southern Pole Supreme Origin Lord, who passes it to the Supreme Emperor of the Great Microcosm Heaven, who passes it to the Golden Palace Emperor Lord, who entrusts it to the Prime Minister Azure Youth Lord, to teach later students who aspire to be true persons. According to the mysterious method, within seven hundred years it may be transmitted thrice. The Supreme Origin Lord commands ninety Western Splendor Jade Maidens to guard within the Southern Pole Purple Chamber.

The Azure Youth Lord said: “Those with bones and corresponding mystery, who see this Way and know the method of casting tablets, will become true persons. But this method is especially weighty and must not be lightly revealed. Among countless students, how many meet the true one? Thus the Central Yellow Elder says: ‘To see the Great Cavern Truth Scripture’s thirty-nine chapters is to ascend to heaven in broad daylight.’ Yet some cultivate for years without success and say the scripture is not true. This is because they lack the golden tablet’s eye of Eastern Splendor, the Golden Palace lacks the jade tally’s name; the true spirit does not descend, but the heavenly demons ride instead, causing no response. Merely gaining spirit scriptures, however many, will not suffice. One must first present the golden tablet at the Azure Palace, offer the jade tally to the Emperor Sovereign, receive the Golden Dawn Jade Boy and Western Splendor Jade Maiden to guard the spiritual script, spreading it through all heavens and earth, the Three Realms acclaiming its goodness, chanting the chapters ten thousand times—how could it fail to bring the response of the jade carriage and purple canopy?”

**The Text for Piercing Heaven’s Three Passes and Casting Jade Tallies**

> To the Heavenly Pass Jade Terrace, to the Jade Dawn Overseer of the Great Void, cast down:  
> “From such-and-such county, village, male or female born Wang Jia, age so many years, born in such month, styled so-and-so.”  
> To the Heavenly Chart Jade Terrace, to the Supreme Overseer True Jade Gentleman, cast down:  
> “From such-and-such county, village, male or female born Wang Jia, age so many years, born in such month, styled so-and-so.”  
> To the Heavenly Pass Jade Terrace, to the Supreme Emperor Overseer True Jade Officer, cast down:  
> “From such-and-such county, village, male or female born Wang Jia, age so many years, born in such month, styled so-and-so.”  

Write these three jade tallies, each one foot six inches long.

**The Text for Piercing the Golden Pass and Casting Golden Tallies**

> To the Golden Palace, before the Golden Palace Emperor Lord, cast down:  
> “Such lord from such county, village, male or female born Wang Jia, age so many years, born in such month, styled so-and-so.”  

Write this golden tally, one foot six inches long.

The Azure Youth Lord said: “If no golden tablet, silver wood may suffice; if no jade tally, paulownia wood may suffice, so long as it is refined and excellent, with natural grain and no knots.”

The Azure Youth Lord said: “When piercing the Heavenly Pass, Heavenly Chart, and Heavenly Pass, ascending to the Azure Palace, Golden Pass, and Jade Clarity Way, write the jade tally, first enter the chamber, knock the teeth twelve times, face east and read the tally fully, then cultivate the method of holding the thought. Seal the tally in a cloud brocade pouch, always burn incense nearby, never lightly expose it. This is the supreme true title, the spiritual chapter of the Jade Emperor. If one has a golden name and jade character inscribed in reverse at the Azure Palace, and sees this Way, then follow the Supreme Truth’s method, carrying one golden tablet and one jade tally, each one foot two inches long, two inches four fen wide, one golden fish and one jade dragon each, one hundred feet of purple silk, thirty feet of blue patterned silk, to serve as the Supreme Truth’s oath, presented to the scripture’s master. The master faces south, the receiver faces north, invoking the Northern Emperor as witness, the Seven Ancestors as oath, pledging not to reveal or leak the secret. Follow the mysterious method, within seven hundred years transmit thrice. If transmitted to the wrong person, the Seven Mysteries and Nine Ancestors become eternal ghost servants, the body perishes in the Nine Springs, never to become immortal. Those who are earnest and aspire to immortality should follow the method and cultivate accordingly.”

Such treasured text is always jealously guarded by the Great Emperor, passed to the Heavenly Emperor Lord, who passes it to the Southern Pole Supreme Origin Lord, who passes it to the Supreme Emperor of the Great Microcosm Heaven, who passes it to the Golden Palace Holy Lord, who entrusts it to the Prime Minister Azure Youth Lord, to teach those who aspire to immortality. Every seven hundred years it emerges once. The Supreme Origin Lord commands thirty-six Western Splendor Jade Maidens to guard the spiritual script within the Southern Pole Purple Chamber.

The Heavenly Emperor Lord said: “This text governs the upper writings of the Nine Heavens, the hidden writings of the Eight Assemblies, crowning and surpassing all ways, wondrously distinct from the jade chapters. Thus the Central Yellow Elder secretly holds the thirty-nine chapters, the Heavenly Emperor Lord treasures the transit of the Seven Primes. Though the Three Vehicles each mark their mysteries, when it comes to establishing use, none are equally complete. True persons only know flying steps and mysterious threads, holding the Five Dawns, swallowing qi and taking in the rosy clouds, chewing the sun’s root, gathering the flowing essence of mystery, returning to vast whiteness to prolong years, yet do not recognize the Seven Stars’ transit and the opening and closing of the Heavenly Pass, turning yin and yang within the Heavenly Pass, returning the Nine Qi to self-observation, preserving the Seven Essences in the mud pellet. To practice this Way is to ride the green canopy cloud, hence the Great Emperor’s supreme title.”

The Southern Pole Supreme Origin Lord said: “From wondrous gathering of mysterious light, breathing in and out the flowing rosy clouds, condensing soul and harmonizing spirit, strengthening essence and preserving the spirit, riding the purple transit of blazing light, flowing golden fire bells, tying the jade belt, racing the moon, roaming myriad transformations, the Nine Truths and Eight Ways serve the sun and moon’s imperial splendor, jade pendants and golden ornaments preserve the truth of the two scenes. Such affairs number over three hundred, thus bringing the mysterious light to gaze upward, feasting in the spirit palace. Yet one has not received the Seven Stars’ transit, the heavenly gate’s key, traversed the Twenty-Eight Constellations, turned the sun and moon’s two lights, drawn from the Five Dawns for combined use, dissolved the separations within the bedchamber, heaven descending purple rosy smoke, the Emperor giving the Golden Dawn boy. If one can diligently contemplate and accumulate feeling in the mysterious palace, within seven years one may ride the green chariot and three pure flying carriages, ascend to the Emperor’s dawn. Such subtlety, spiritual transformation is endlessly profound.”

The Supreme Emperor of the Great Microcosm Heaven said: “True persons only know flying steps on the heavenly thread, treading the Seven Primes, yet do not know the transit of the Seven Stars opening the Heavenly Pass, turning the Dipper thread to shade the body, moving the Seven Degrees to prolong completeness, separating northeast at the death gate, joining southwest at the birth gate. Practicing fourteen years, one ascends to receive the mysterious descent of the jade carriage, flying rosy dan carriage’s reins, ascending by day to the Golden Palace.”

The Golden Palace Holy Lord said: “The Way of the Heavenly Pass is easy to pierce but hard to understand; the transit of the Seven Primes is hard to see but easy to practice. Separation and union are the source of birth and death. When humans receive qi, there are thirteen births, destined to end and return to thirteen deaths. Thus the Heavenly Pass is the knot of separation and union, the Seven Primes the root of birth and death. Cultivating nobly, seeking immortality and truth, yet not knowing to close the death qi at the ghost gate, to cross the life qi at the human gate, to turn the Seven Stars at the northeast, to pierce the Heavenly Pass at the southwest, one will not escape death, and true seeking is very difficult. If one has the golden name Eastern Splendor, green characters Supreme Clarity, and sees this Way, then the root of immortality practiced seven years, one attains the rank of named immortal, flying carriage green canopy, crimson body, ascending the mysterious palace.”

The Prime Minister Azure Youth Lord said: “The revolving pivot moves through heaven and earth, the mysterious Dipper governs the eight gates, flowing light reflects in the nine skies, heavenly might shakes the ten directions, arraying mysterious images in the heavenly chart, governing birth and death in the Seven Primes, firmly holding the Five Separations to quell death, gathering the Six Harmonies for self-protection. If one can ride the high true to seek crossing, close the death gate at the Heavenly Pass, wear the Nine Essences to illuminate within, hold the mysterious Dipper’s faint rays, achieve the flying rosy carriage, the three pure clouds, soaring through the void, ascending to the morning sky.”

All who cultivate the Way of the Seven Stars’ Transit must summon the Jade Emperor’s nine lords, the mysterious essence illuminating within, severing and blocking the root of death, in quiet chambers, undisturbed by dust and wind, standing alone facing the scene, gazing at the morning sky, burning incense left and right, scattering rosy smoke in the courtyard, with focused heart and bitter thought, not sleeping that day. After seven years, one attains the jade carriage, flying canopy, dan carriage, to welcome the destined body, ascend the Heavenly Pass, block the death path at the northeast, record the immortal register at the southern immortal. This is the rare and difficult Way, the true that descends easily.

Those who have the golden frame and jade name and receive this Way should do so on the days of Ren Yin, Bing Yin, Jia Zi, Jia Wu, Xin Wei, Xin Chou—these are the six assembly days of heaven, the time of supreme conjunction. The Jade Emperor always uses these days to have the jade boys at the Eastern Splendor Azure Palace verify the golden frame and jade name, recording the immortal’s register. On these days, those diligent in spirit and reaching the Jade Emperor’s favor command the Northern Emperor Fengdu’s six palaces to sever the root of death registers, record the life register at the human gate, move the Seven Stars added to the ghost gate, cross the mysterious pivot, and pierce the Heavenly Pass.

Whenever fasting purely, bitterly contemplating and focusing on mystery, closing eyes and holding inner vision, knocking teeth thirty-six times, thinking of the First Heavenly Supreme Emperor of the Mysterious Pivot, Yang Bright Heavenly Pivot, Soul Spirit Supreme Nine Lords, dressed in flying cloud brocade skirts, crowned with mysterious dawn crowns, descending from the mysterious Dipper into my body, chanting:

> Mysterious Pivot, Yang Bright Heavenly Pivot, Soul Spirit Supreme Nine Lords,  
> Mixed and transformed, together one god,  
> Will sever my death path at the ghost gate,  
> Cross the life register at the southern pavilion,  
> Remove the Seven Mysteries at the Three Paths,  
> Receive rebirth and become immortal,  
> Turn the Seven Essences with mysterious shade,  
> Cross my form at the Heavenly Pass.  
> Complete. Swallow qi twice seven times.

Cultivate without ceasing, summon the Jade Emperor’s guests, Emperor descends purple rosy clouds, with Western Splendor Jade Maidens and Golden Dawn Jade Boys, twelve each, guarding the body.

Next, think of the Second Prime Star, Northern Embryo Yin Essence, Heavenly Xuan Soul Spirit Supreme Jade Nine Lords, wearing yellow brocade flying skirts, mysterious dawn crowns, descending from the mysterious Dipper into my body, swallowing qi and chanting:

> Northern Embryo Yin Essence, Heavenly Xuan Soul Spirit Supreme Jade Nine Lords,  
> Mixed and transformed, together one god,  
> Will remove my yang sins at the Great Yin,  
> Cross yin qi at the sun,  
> Move the Seven Primes to sever death,  
> Pierce the Six Harmonies at the Heavenly Pass,  
> Pull the Seven Ancestors from the Three Paths,

> Complete. Swallow qi twice seven times.

Next, think of the Third True Star, Nine Extremes Supreme True Supreme Origin Lady, Heavenly Ji Soul Essence Supreme Su Nine Lords, wearing blue brocade flying skirts, mysterious dawn crowns, descending from the mysterious Dipper into my body, swallowing qi and chanting:

> Mixed and transformed, together one god,  
> Will open and dissolve the root of old grudges,  
> Sever the source of death’s path,  
> Make my eyes clear and bright,  
> Watch endlessly,  
> Mysterious truth gazing upward,  
> Essence pouring into my body,  
> Climbing the imperial leader,  
> Flying steps through the Seven Primes,  
> Riding the light and soaring empty,  
> Inclining with heaven.  
> Complete. Swallow qi twice seven times.

Next, think of the Fourth Knot Star, Xuanji Mysterious Darkness Heavenly Authority Soul Essence Supreme Void Nine Lords, wearing purple brocade flying skirts, mysterious dawn crowns, descending from the mysterious Dipper into my body, chanting:

> Xuanji Mysterious Darkness Heavenly Authority Soul Essence Supreme Void Nine Lords,  
> Mixed and transformed, together one god,  
> Will move and transit the Seven Stars,  
> Fill and block the ghost gate,  
> Sever death qi,  
> Pierce the bright Heavenly Pass,  
> Return the Northern Dipper to the mysterious pivot,  
> Cross life qi at the western earth,  
> Separate the Northern Emperor at Fengdu,  
> Record my name at the southern pavilion.  
> Complete. Swallow qi twice seven times.

Next, think of the Fifth Thread Star, Heavenly Balance Dan Origin Jade Scale Soul Platform Supreme Nine Emperor Lords, wearing cinnabar brocade flying skirts, mysterious dawn crowns, descending from the mysterious Dipper into my body, chanting:

> Heavenly Balance Dan Origin Jade Scale Soul Spirit Supreme Nine Emperor Lords,  
> Mixed and transformed, together one god,  
> Will raise and lower the Seven Essences,  
> Pour into my body,  
> Turn four times three,  
> Open the Seven Primes,

> Cross name Seven Primes,

Next, think of the Seventh Pass Star, Mysterious Yang Heavenly Pass Shaking Light Great Bright Most High Jade Emperor Dao Lord, wearing cinnabar brocade flying gauze skirts, mysterious dawn crowns, descending from the mysterious Dipper into my body, chanting:

> Dissolve my Seven Mysteries ancestors,  
> Enable roaming the mysterious clouds,  
> Cut my northern yin death root,  
> Record my Eastern Splendor jade chapter.  
> Complete. Swallow qi twice seven times.

Having held the Seven Primes, knock the teeth twelve times, gaze and think of the northern seven stars’ bright light, shining on the north, mysterious essence reflecting within, coming to cover my body. The Dipper True Lord in chaos transforms with no fixed form, together riding the green rosy cloud, coming to greet my body, ascending among the Seven Stars. I sense my body beneath the Dipper’s central canopy, essence light brilliant, crown encircling the body, turning with the Dipper like a wheel. In a moment, the Heavenly Pass opens; the Seven Stars and Nine Lords each grant me the symbol of opening and closing the Seven Primes, to control the Northern Emperor’s six palaces, severing the root of death qi. Receiving the symbols, I spin, returning to my original source, back in the Dipper. The seven symbols shine like fire essence, moving me downward, suddenly treading empty space, in a flash resting in my sleeping grove. Knock teeth thirty-six times, raise head and recite:

> Mysterious light shining essence,  
> Flowing scene electric form,  
> Abandon rosy clouds, escape and transform,  
> Ascend the Seven Stars,  
> Xuanji reins tightened,  
> Like lightning rushing in fright,  
> Heaven One opens the gate,  
> Cross me to life,  
> Northern Emperor’s yin palace,  
> Drop my death name,  
> No crossing no dropping,  
> Ascend to Seven Essences,  
> I wear the Seven Primes,  
> Flowing golden fire bells,  
> Open heavenly mechanism,  
> Flowing through eight darknesses,  
> Commanding the six jia,  
> Driving the six ding,  
> Heaven descends mysterious rosy clouds,  
> Emperor gives divine weapons,  
> Begging Eastern Splendor,  
> Record my jade name,

This is the Way of opening the Heavenly Pass, severing the root of death, mixing and transforming in myriad ways, complete here. Practice for seven years, wearing the symbol of opening and closing the Seven Primes, then the flying rosy green canopy comes to welcome the destined body. Keep this secret in cultivation, do not lightly transmit.

### Scripture of the Cavern of Truth, Supreme Clarity, Opening Heaven’s Three Charts and the Seven Stars’ Transit — Scroll Two

**The Emperor Lord’s Symbol of Opening and Closing the Seven Primes**

Written in orpiment green.

Written in empty blue and crimson.

Written in vermilion blue-green, also called yellow on white.

Written in orpiment white on white.

Written in orpiment raw purple, also called black on white.

Written in black on yellow-white.

Written in vermilion blue-green.

The internal symbol of opening and closing the Seven Primes is bestowed by the Emperor Lord to the Heavenly Emperor Lord, who passes it to the Southern Pole Supreme Origin Lord, who passes it to the Supreme Emperor of the Great Microcosm Heaven, who passes it to the Golden Palace Lord, who entrusts it to the Prime Minister Azure Youth Lord, to bestow upon those who respond to immortality. According to the Four Extremities Bright Scripture, the symbol emerges once every seven hundred years. The method of transmission: disciples must fast for seven days, prepare thirty-one feet of blue patterned silk, seventy feet of blue silk, ninety feet of phoenix-patterned gauze, seven pairs of golden buttons, one pair each of golden fish and jade dragons, as tokens of oath and trust. Without trust and receiving the scripture, it is called lightly leaking the heavenly treasure; violating trust and transmitting scripture is called leaking the heavenly dao. The sages value the Way over wealth, thus transmit only with trust. Those who covet wealth and seek the Way are far from it. Even if one sees the treasured text amid leaks, when the body perishes under ghost officials, harming the Seven Mysteries, it is of no use. Those with earnest heart and pure intent, opening to the Jade Emperor, named Eastern Splendor, dwelling in secluded peaks, cutting off worldly food and clothing, can then open and receive it. Students who do not know heaven has opening gates, earth has Fengdu, opening gates govern spirits, Dengdu governs ghosts—these two emperors govern life and death, linked by the Seven Stars’ key mechanism. Thus the Seven Stars move and transit; the Northern Emperor has no six officials’ name, the opening gate has the immortal register, the mysterious Dipper corresponds with the canopy, the Seven Primes grant the opening and closing, the path to immortality lies close at hand.

The Southern Pole Supreme Origin Lord said: “Those with will are all illuminated by the Seven Stars and Nine Emperor Lords, their hearts earnestly seeking and bitterly contemplating, naturally receiving this scripture. Cultivate for seven years and ascend by day to the morning.”

If one only reveres this scripture without holding thought and burning incense nearby, the Seven Stars’ essence will still mysteriously illuminate the chamber, and Fengdu’s officials dare not approach the body.

When the transit of the Seven Stars is complete, next hold in thought the two Emperor stars, sitting upright facing east, knocking teeth thirty-six times, holding in mind the two Emperor stars, the High Jade Emperor of the Eight Scenes, Nine Lords, Supreme Emperor of the Great Microcosm Heaven, Supreme Su Seven Star Lords, all wearing flying cloud purple brocade skirts, mysterious dawn crowns, descending from the mysterious Dipper into my body, chanting:

> High Jade Emperor of the Eight Scenes, Nine Lords,  
> Supreme Emperor of the Great Microcosm Heaven, Supreme Su Seven Star Lords,  
> Nine transformations mixed with the two Emperor lords,  
> Will open the Heavenly Pass for me,  
> Transit the jade name,  
> Sever and block the ghost gate,  
> Northern Emperor’s six palaces’ death root severed,  
> Ascend the Seven Primes,  
> Grant me the Eight Scenes, Seven Essences, Nine Emperors’ flying carriage green canopy,  
> Together ascend the Emperor Dawn,  
> Governing the imperial consorts,  
> Commanding myriad spirits.  
> Complete. Swallow qi three times seven.

**Jade Emperor’s Heavenly Pass Flying Symbol**

Written in orpiment green.

The two Emperor symbols ascend among the Seven Stars’ canopy. The two Emperor stars govern beneath the canopy, which always covers the two stars, their essence light unseen, no one can see them. Thus the *Golden Book Jade Characters* says: “To see the two stars extends life six hundred years.” Without the two Emperor flying symbols, one cannot ascend beneath the canopy, nor see the two stars. Wearing the two symbols, the two Emperors themselves shine mysterious light upon the body; cultivating seven years, one ascends by day to the morning.

**Northern Emperor Fengdu Six Palaces’ Method of Crossing Death**

Fengdu Mountain lies in the north, Gui earth, thus the northeast is the ghost gate, root of death qi. The mountain is two thousand six hundred li high, circling thirty thousand li. Beneath the mountain is a cave heaven origin, circling fifteen thousand li. Above and below are ghost spirit palaces and chambers; on the mountain are six palaces; within the cave are six palaces, each palace circling one thousand li, the six heavenly ghost spirit palaces.

The First Palace is named Zhou Jue Yin Heavenly Palace. Governs humans.

The Second Palace is named Tai Sha Liang Shi Zong Heavenly Palace.

The Third Palace is named Ming Chen Nai Fan Wu Cheng Heavenly Palace.

The Fourth Palace is named Tian Zhao Zui Qi Heavenly Palace.

The Fifth Palace is named Zong Ling Qi Fei Heavenly Palace.

The Sixth Palace is named Gan Si Lian Wan Lu Heavenly Palace.

These six palaces are governed by the Northern Emperor and the six heavenly ghost spirits, overseeing human names, all the dead pass through Fengdu’s six palaces. Thus the Emperor Lord always uses the Seven Stars’ transit to guide immortality seekers past the Heavenly Pass to the Southern Pole’s palace, severing and blocking the death gate at the northeast. When one completes the transit, knock left teeth nine times, call the six palaces’ names, and chant:

> I am the Emperor Lord’s minister, named Shu Yuqing,  
> Governing the six heavens,  
> Northern Emperor’s ghost palace, all are my camp,  
> All my troops, what ghosts dare live?  
> Wearing the opening and closing symbol on the right,  
> Bearing the fire bell on the left,  
> Casting fire ten thousand li,  
> Commanding myriad spirits,  
> Those who offend are executed,  
> Those who interfere are punished,  
> The Emperor Lord commands,  
> Capturing without pause.

When all is complete, one chant causes heaven’s light to tremble, myriad demons bind form, three chants extinguish ghosts and monsters, six palaces sever human death names, the Heavenly Pass crosses people, Southern Pole gives life. Those who do not know the Fengdu palaces’ names, governed by ghosts and spirits, and do not sever and block the death capital, will never become immortal.

**The Supreme Method of Five Separations, Crossing Death, and Transiting Life**

To practice the Six Assemblies’ transit, one must cultivate the Five Dawns’ separation at the death gate, crossing at the life palace, the flying immortal supreme method. Use the days Ren Shen, Bing Shen, Wu Shen, Jia Shen, Geng Shen—the five separation days of death. At this time, the Emperor Lord holds a grand feast, riding the dragon carriage, green rosy flying canopy, with immortal officials and jade maidens circling ten heavens, descending to the human realm to observe immortality seekers, ordering the Northern Emperor’s Great Yin Five Lords to carry the death register to the Lord of the Plain Capital’s Calculation Palace, to verify the death and life registers. The Five Directions’ Five Star True Emperor Lords each govern a direction, commanding all immortals who deserve the Way, named Eastern Splendor. Those with yin sins and yin faults, yang sins and yang faults, bound to the Northern Emperor, the Great Yin Lord says the palace is Fengdu’s, separating good and evil, life and death. Thus on the Five Separation days, the chief sin is at Great Yin, cultivating life at the sun, dropping death register at the Northern Emperor, seeking immortal register at the Five Stars. On those days, wear fine clothes, burn incense entering the chamber, repent faults and think good, hold spirit within, one heart focused on mystery, no other thoughts. The Emperor Lord tours the Five Realms, spirits record one’s merits, named at the Jade Emperor. After five years, one may receive the Five Star True Emperors descending to one’s chamber. At dawn, noon, and midnight, enter chamber, burn incense, face north, bow twice, knock teeth three times, recite:

> High Jade Emperor Lord,  
> Beg to remove from my Seven Ancestors onward,  
> Down to my own deeds of yin evil and yang faults,  
> Killing, lust, jealousy, harming the true law,  
> Thousands of offenses,  
> Yang sins and yin faults,  
> Named before the Northern Emperor,  
> Beg to remove and scatter,  
> Erase the sin names,  
> Sever the root of death,  
> Cross the Heavenly Pass,  
> Attain Eastern Splendor,  
> Record the main chapter,  
> Seven Ancestors and grandparents,  
> Return to rebirth at the Southern Immortal.

Complete, then think of the northern star Chen, True Emperor Lord Essence Origin, wearing purple brocade flying skirt, tiger token at waist, yellow crown on head, riding brocade rosy flying cloud, with twelve immortal officials, descending from the north, covering my body, light thick and lush, shining bright essence rays, looking upward chanting:

> Northern True Emperor,  
> Governing flying immortals,  
> Riding cloud and returning carriage,  
> Come crown my body,  
> Beg to fill and block the ghost gate,  
> Sever death root,  
> Named Jade Clarity,  
> Pierce and release Heavenly Pass,  
> I cross the Northern Emperor,  
> Ascend the Southern Pavilion,  
> Live with the True Emperor,  
> Guard the North Star.

Complete, next think of the western star Taibai, True Emperor Lord Liaoling, wearing white brocade flowing bell skirt, tiger token at waist, supporting dawn crown on head, riding white rosy flying carriage, with twelve immortal officials, descending from the west, covering my body, light penetrating, shining bright west, looking upward chanting:

> Seven Mysteries ancestors,  
> All ascend morning skies.

Complete, swallow qi six times and cease, then face center and bow, knock teeth three times, recite:

Complete, swallow qi twelve times and cease.

The Five Separations first pass at the Five Emperors, holding the Five Dawns to cross life, the matter ends here. If one always practices on these days without fail, after seven years one will sense the Five Dawns’ True Emperors, seeing their forms in one’s chamber. The Great Emperor sends five jade maidens from the five directions to guard the body; the Northern Emperor Great Yin also comes to one’s gate and dares not bind one’s sins. Those who seek immortality and truth should diligently practice. Repenting and seeking immortality is the Great Prime Minister Azure Youth Lord’s request to the Golden Palace Holy Lord’s method, a warning to later students seeking life, not the Great Emperor Lord’s repentance. Practicing this, the Emperor Lord also watches one’s heart. If past faults remain unresolved, the six heavens’ palaces will not drop one’s death name, the opening gate’s door will not cross one’s body. Thus the house of separation and union, the door of opening and closing—the door governs crossing life, the house governs filling death’s root. Only by earnest seeking can one attain the truth.

**The Emperor Lord’s Bright Lamp Inner Observation Method for Seeking Immortality**

Received from the Southern Pole Supreme Origin Lord.

The Emperor Lord always dwells on the Clear Mysterious Terrace, within the golden chamber and purple door, illuminating himself with the Bright Mysterious Lamp, channeling rosy light through the eight windows, contemplating the Supreme Truth in the five forms, opening the Three Wishes in the Emperor’s chamber, spiritual beings descend with purple canopies, the Primordial Emperor grants golden boys, naturally titled my imperial rank, governing the mysterious palace. Supreme birth arises from the beginning of marvel, the Way lies in subtle light. Now I inform you; you must diligently serve.

Tell the Southern Pole Supreme Origin Lord: “You study the Way of Divine Truth, dwelling above the spiritual official, inside the jade chamber, yet do not know to illuminate the lamp to reflect yourself, channeling mysterious light within the five viscera, thus gaining clarity. The spirit of the body returns.”

If you can light the lamp at dusk on your original life, in the morning on the year of action, and always illuminate the lamp on the Grand Duke, these three places of wishing thought, then your body’s qi will be pure and correct, true light shining bright, myriad spirits clear and bright. The Supreme Origin Lord accepts this method; practicing three years, you will receive twenty-four night light boys, mysterious light naturally bright, no need for lamp to channel light. Yet this supreme true subtle method is not transmitted to later generations. If one has a golden name, jade character, and mysterious pattern, receiving my Way, practicing nine years, the body shines bright, seeing through ten thousand li, mysterious observation natural, night light boys descend to your chamber, teaching you the true scripture, ascending by day to the morning.

Always illuminate the lamp in a quiet chamber above your original life, in the evening enter the chamber, kneel long facing the lamp, knock teeth twelve times, chant:

> Mysterious light reflects Great Yin,  
> Eight directions clear and bright,  
> Pure spirit curls in chamber,  
> Looking upward piercing Supreme Clarity,  
> Five lights issuing from mysterious platform,  
> Jade fungus naturally grows,  
> Illuminating and reaching Supreme Truth,  
> Myriads of spirits watch my form,  
> Sever nine yin qi,  
> Record my Eastern Splendor name,  
> Preserve me without end,  
> Long endure with sun and moon,  
> Remove and cross the Seven Mysteries’ difficulties,  
> Southern palace receives honor anew,  
> Bright light opens Jade Emperor,  
> Ascend to inner observation scripture,  
> Heaven descends flying morning carriage,  
> Soaring empty riding green canopy,  
> Attain to the Great Emperor’s hall,  
> Advance and bow at Jade Emperor’s court.  
> Complete. Bow again, face original life, swallow saliva seven times and cease.

Also always illuminate the lamp above the year of action, facing the lamp in the morning, knock teeth twelve times, chant:

> Bright lamp shines on year of action,  
> Scattering light shining eight directions,  
> Clear and pure colors and forms,  
> Inner observation bright as empty sky,  
> Pierce and release bright spirit collar,  
> You commune with jade truth,  
> Look up to the High Supreme Way,  
> Remote and formless trace,  
> Thinking to receive mysterious clouds descending,  
> Reining and riding flying dragons,  
> Returning my hundred-year term,  
> Returning to infant form,  
> Grant me Western Splendor maiden,  
> Give me Golden Dawn boy,  
> Guard incense and year of fate,  
> Bow to Jade Emperor’s chamber,  
> Spirit peaceful, dao also smooth,  
> Fear entering incense smoke,  
> Settle heart dwelling in great mystery,  
> Essence feeling penetrating emptiness,  
> Chamber summons divine sky to descend,  
> Close eyes gaze at immortal lords,  
> Remove the Seven Ancestors’ difficulties,  
> Cross form returning to southern palace.  
> Complete. Bow again, face east, swallow qi twice seven times and cease.

Always illuminate the lamp on the Grand Duke to communicate with spirits, fulfilling wishes to seek truth. After three years, mysterious light shines within, divine truth descends, granting you the method of immortality. At that time, there will be response. Every morning and evening burn incense, knock teeth twelve times, face the lamp and chant:

> Lamp fire reflects Supreme Truth,  
> Bright light penetrates mysterious void,  
> Pierce and reveal the unsurpassed Way,  
> Heart focused on Jade Emperor’s abode,  
> Penetrate the empty cavity within,  
> Spirit observes form naturally relaxed,  
> Accumulate feeling to bring spirit descent,  
> Heart serene and principle hidden,  
> Morning worship at Great Emperor’s hall,  
> Evening recite true scripture,  
> Wandering free in mysterious capital,  
> Ten thousand years return to infant,  
> Heavenly crown purple sky rosy clouds,  
> Emperor grants six jade carriages,  
> Floating roaming five mountain peaks,  
> At will attaining desires,  
> Seven Ancestors freed from three paths,  
> Blessings and fortune arrive.  
> Complete. Bow again, swallow saliva twice seven and cease.

If one can always keep the lamp burning in these three places without extinguishing, the Seven Mysteries and Nine Ancestors will be freed from the ten sufferings of separation and union, ascend to the Southern Pole, one’s body and spirit pure and correct, eyes seeing ten thousand li, ears hearing far, mind and wisdom foreknowing the future, divine truth descending, night light boys teaching the Way of Immortality. After nine years thus, spiritual light naturally bright, communicating within and without. The Five Separations first pass at the Five Emperors, holding the Five Dawns to cross life, the matter ends here.

**The Emperor Lord’s Five Wishes Method for Seeking Immortality**

The Emperor Lord always on the ninth day of the ninth month, fifth day of the tenth month, third day of the third month, eighth day of the fourth month, seventh day of the seventh month—these are the five wishes and ten assemblies—ascends the Supreme Ultimate Jade Terrace, within the High Jade Palace golden chamber, holding the Five Wishes in the jade palace, hoping the mysterious truth will descend, the void opens with jade edicts, golden sounds resound through the great void, summoning the Five Emperors to guard the spirit, celebrating myriad assemblies in the cinnabar chamber. Thus there is response and true arrival, true also responds and descends. On these days, always bathe and fast purely, enter chamber and burn incense, heart bows to the four directions, sitting upright facing due east, east being the direction of the rising sun’s first light. Knock teeth thirty-six times. First wish: “May I be born of natural qi, qi forming my body, body equal to the Three Lights, long enjoying the root of infinity;” second wish: “May my body always dwell above the great void, inside jade palace and jade chamber, morning feasting with the Jade Emperor, evening resting with the Mysterious Mother, thirst quenched with jade well spring and jade fungus, hunger fed with dragon embryo, jade fat, crimson tree, and red infant;” third wish: “May my body bear myriad auspicious signs, seventy-two lights, strange hairs and wondrous bones, flying feathers and robes, riding the void and driving the empty, entering and exiting the Emperor’s palace, myriad celebrations arriving, boundless longevity;” fourth wish: “May I be born with the non-being, die with the non-being, die and be born again, born a true emperor, sealed and governing the ten heavens, commanding the myriad immortals;” fifth wish: “May all beings, born and unborn, together protect the sun, moon, and Three Lights, those with the Way, Seven Mysteries ancestors, ascend the southern palace, all the world’s blessings, none unfulfilled.” The four directions’ five wishes together assemble in the jade hall.

Next, the upper five wishes: “May the nine mysteries nourish my body, soul, and spirit always dwelling in my palace, connecting heaven’s immortals below to the caverns, wishing heaven, earth, wind, spirit, and immortals, five wishes united, fixed register of longevity, heaven descending purple smoke, earth guarding five spirits, riding clouds and driving the void, flying carriage green canopy, ascending the Golden Palace, advancing to Jade Clarity, celebrating the Seven Ancestors, receiving rebirth, five wishes united, long enjoying benefit and virtue.”

Middle five wishes: “May I attain the root of the Way, wishing yin, wishing yang, wishing great void, wishing great non-being, wishing great mystery, feasting in the jade chamber with the Emperor, roaming the birth gate, piercing the waves of the Nine Heavens, primordial father fixing register, mysterious mother recording years, peach orchard gathering essence, protecting the firm cinnabar field, body soaring to the Golden Palace, name recorded in the jade chapter, Seven Ancestors freed, blessings arriving.”

Lower five wishes: “May I wish great void, wish great existence, wish supreme, wish supreme truth, wish spirit immortals, moving my body on the five mountain ridges, floating in the nine skies, entering and exiting the opening gate, escaping death gate, wishing heaven and earth be my parents, Three Lights guard me ten thousand years, spirits watch the nine sources’ openings, spirits descend natural qi, eight directions and five wishes respond in harmony.” When the five wishes complete, knock teeth twice seven times, chant:

> Supreme Emperor Supreme Origin,  
> Emperor One Mysterious Scripture,  
> Five clouds scatter light,  
> Thick and lush Three Pure Ones,  
> Jade boys and jade girls,  
> Burning incense serving spirit,  
> Upper wish opens and displays,  
> Merging with me,  
> Making me immortal,  
> Ascending the imperial court,  
> Northern Emperor falls death,  
> Southern Dipper notes life,  
> Eastern Splendor golden pavilion,  
> Attain my name,  
> Infinite wishes,  
> Equal with me.

After chanting, knock teeth three times seven, raise head and swallow qi five times and cease.

This is the Emperor Lord’s method of opening the five wishes and merging with spirit. Those who can always do so, jade splendor guards and jade boys scatter incense, ascending through the Nine Heavens, responding to the Emperor Lord. After five years thus, the Way naturally descends. The ten directions’ Way wishes all descend to you. When voicing the wish, keep heart and mind unified, no other thoughts or distractions. If the true spirit disperses, the wish will not descend. Treading filth and dust, the true is far away. The Emperor Lord’s five wishes and ten assemblies’ Way ends here. On these days, if one can diligently wish and think according to the method, the Emperor sends jade boys to guard the body, summoning the five directions’ wishes, the Way of immortals descends to your form. After five years, you may ride flying clouds, ascend the Nine Heavens, be listed in Eastern Splendor, Seven Ancestors and grandparents bearing blessings, leaving the Three Paths, receiving immortality in the southern palace.

The Southern Pole Supreme Origin Lord said: “The world’s people who study only know to seek in the morning and hope to gain by evening, one thought hoping for descent, uttering spells expecting response, yet do not know to ascend the Qi Ridge, arise from mountain traces, a thousand zhang tree emerging from a hair’s tip. The Way is high and true and subtle; how can one set foot and hope to ascend the cloud ladder? The Emperor Lord receives qi and governs truth, still illuminating the lamp to communicate, the five wishes to hope for blessings. How could it not embrace nature? The Way to seek immortality must first wish then seek, wish to feel and bring spirit. The five wishes are great, encompassing all, blessings covering all, fortune flowing everywhere, truly touching the wish’s goodness. If one can focus the heart on the wish, the wish will respond without fail. Later seekers, come again to inquire and consider.”

The Prime Minister Azure Youth Lord said: “I studied for seven hundred years, crossing steep peaks, traversing east and west, south and north, roaming the central plains, with thirty-two masters, receiving over three hundred matters, yet did not ascend the Golden Palace, nor visit the Holy Lord to receive the spiritual purple script, nor cultivate the Way of binding soul and spirit with sun and moon’s yellow splendor, tying jade belts and mysterious instruments, Nine Truths and Eight Ways to dissolve form and transform, purple transit blazing light flowing golden fire bells, breathing in and out flying rosy clouds, treading the Seven Primes’ precious scripture. The Holy Lord treasures the Seven Stars’ transit, telling the oath and granting it, severing the six palaces’ death names, filling the northeast ghost gate, opening the Heavenly Pass to transit my body. Only then can one ascend the Three Origins to serve, becoming the Prime Minister’s steward, commanding myriad immortals. The Seven Stars shine in heaven, turning the Nine Primes’ essence, riding the Three Origins’ qi, governing the six heavens’ names, birth and death, separation and union—all by the Seven Stars. Thus when humans are added by the Dipper, they die; when the Dipper moves, they live. The Seven Stars are the heavenly sign, the opening gate the office of crossing life. Those who do not know to sever the death gate at northeast, cross the life gate at the southern pass, how can life not be preserved? The Great Emperor secreted this scripture in the Six Harmonies chamber, commanding three hundred Western Splendor Jade Maidens and Golden Dawn Jade Boys to guard the spiritual script, later passing it to perfected beings, emerging from famous mountains.”

Lord Wang of the Western City later saw this scripture inside the stone chamber of Wangwu. Lord Wang had just completed three months of fasting, carrying faith to the mountain, receiving and transmitting the method of piercing and inspecting—the Seven Stars’ transit. Cultivating this Way, he became a true person. No one without a jade name becoming immortal has heard or seen this Way. Those with the scripture have their names recorded in Fengdu’s six palaces, transiting the southern pass, much less cultivating it. Lord Wang said: “This scripture originally had three scrolls: Heavenly Pass, Heavenly Chart two scrolls, not circulated in the world. The Southern Peak Lady received only this one scroll of the Seven Stars’ Transit.”
