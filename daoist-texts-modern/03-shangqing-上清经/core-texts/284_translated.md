# The Supreme Cavernous Truth Jade Emperor’s Great Cavernous Female-One Jade Inspection Five Elders Precious Scripture

### Scripture Title: The Supreme Cavernous Truth Jade Emperor’s Great Cavernous Female-One Jade Inspection Five Elders Precious Scripture. Abbreviated as the *Female-One Five Elders Scripture*. Author unknown, approximately from the late Eastern Jin of the Southern period. This is one of the early Shangqing school’s “Three Marvelous Precious Texts.” One scroll. Source text: *Zhengtong Daozang*, Zhengyi section.

Behold, the Supreme Cavernous Truth Jade Emperor’s *Great Cavernous Female-One Jade Inspection Five Elders Precious Scripture*—above, the Twelve Wills of the Mysterious Mothers, the Eight Intervals, the Nine Revolutions, the Five Returns, transformations of female and male. At the center, the Yellow Elder’s *Great Cavernous True Scripture in Thirty-Nine Chapters* is secretly kept in the palace of Great Abundance above the Nine Heavens, within the Jade Chamber of the Supreme Mysterious Spirit Terrace. Purple clouds serve as the bamboo slips to compose its text, blue-green as the characters inscribed to write its chapters. The Supreme Mixed Great Emperor births the Transforming Primordial Origin, the Middle Transformation of Seven and Nine, the Principle and Fate enduring long; below, the Divine Laws of the Passages govern, overseeing myriad spirits, female and male reunited, splendidly pure jade clarity, vast and profound in contemplation—the Supreme Radiance on high.

Guarding the scripture are twenty-seven Jade Maidens, who constantly kindle incense; attending the scripture are twenty-nine Jade Boys, ever bearing precious spiritual texts. Together, the Jade Boys and Maidens number fifty-six, sworn to forbid leaks or negligence, vigilantly watching over the true scripture, recording merits and illuminating goodness, carefully dispelling calamities. Their divine radiance manifests wondrously, each marked by splendid dawns to signify their truth. Thus the Jade Splendor takes the form of Jade Maidens, the Golden Dawn crowns the faces of Jade Boys, drifting and radiant above the Nine Mysteries, shining brightly within the chamber of accumulated responses, aligned with the Six Heavens, the deep and serene empty peaks, brocaded robes flowing with tinkling bells, flying azure feather skirts, belts adorned with primal talismans, heads crowned with morning crests—guarding the scripture’s body, assisting the cultivation of the perfected ones.

Whoever is destined to receive this scripture must practice its text. Always dwell in quiet seclusion, shut away in a chamber, scatter incense and brush away dust, let the spirit rest in the dark forest, avoid the human world, embrace solitude and forsake worldly affairs, cast off burdens and accept the true, open the heart and forget contention, surrender and follow the cavernous root, dwell alone in the secluded room, avoid valleys and bitterness, taste lightly the upper heavens, exhale liquid and harmonize the fluids, single-mindedly dispatch companions, gaze deeply upon the three souls, persist in austere cultivation, pass the middle without eating, fast bitterly for three years—only then may one receive and read the *Great Cavernous True Scripture*. All this accords with the solemn covenant; do not rashly transmit or leak it lightly, lest calamity befall the body. False speech and broken oaths do not prolong life.

The Nine Heavens’ precious scripture is forbidden by the Four True Ones of the Supreme Ultimate; it must not be falsely bestowed upon unworthy persons. Those who recklessly teach it without examining themselves leak the heavenly treasure, offend the Supreme Mysterious, provoke ten thousand spirits’ denunciations, invite a thousand spirits’ calamities, incur the Supreme’s judgment, lose the life bestowed by the Emperor Lord, their bodies condemned by the dark laws, forms severed from dust, death becoming lower ghosts, rivers flooded and mountains filled, reborn as parents of life and death, all punished in hell, tested cruelly by the Three Officials, madly withering away, bearing great calamities in the vast darkness. Calamities always arise from careless words; blessings always come from accumulated virtue. The body’s reflection in the mirror, like an echo in a deep valley, though distant from near, must respond afar; afar never fails to answer, near never fails to verify. Heaven’s retribution is swift without haste; the response expected arrives without delay—how can one not be cautious?

The Supreme Decree states: To transmit heavenly scriptures and thereby bring disaster upon one’s ancestors is a grave crime of proclamation, a covenant to prevent leakage. This scripture is the Jade Pure Emperor Lord’s, a sudden, momentary cavernous union transformation, the high mystery of the three primitives of the Supreme Ultimate True One. It is called the Way of Seven Transformations, the root born from the Great Unity’s infant brother, without the chapters of the myriad transformations of the hero sons. Thus, surveying all things, the Supreme Mysterious shines brightly in the cavern, suddenly and swiftly, the celestial balance follows its course, returning to the infant self-birth, the mud pellet guards the town, turning left through the Nine Heavens, overturning the Seven Luminaries, the Seven Luminaries govern the light—this is called the Seven Transformations. Female-One joins with the light; the Emperor Lord guards within; the Five Spirits and Eight Intervals, the Mysterious Mother faces south; turning right the Eight Qi, threading millions, flying and dispersing, the great mixed infant child, the Nine Truths receive qi; the Mysterious Father in the north, body aligned with the heavens, participating in the falling morning sky.

Herein, those who preserve the Nine Thoughts see golden radiance shining in the Eastern Splendor, jade form shedding at the Emperor’s gate, the divine Five Elders leap among the Three Primes, spiritual feathers spread in the void, qi condenses into auspicious clouds, able also to generate water and fire in the body, radiate light ten thousand fathoms, bearing precious brilliance, floating among the Nine Mornings, dividing form and scattering light, taking place as the Supreme True One. Thus, those who attain this way are the true spiritual sovereigns; those who lose it descend into the springs of the Nine Earths. The secret of this way is the great marvel of the cavern spirit. Again, female and male blend as one, the Emperor Lord subtly transforms, the Great Unity preserves the spirit, the Mysterious Mother births the infant, three, five, seven, nine, nine revolutions together shine, primordial response and radiant light, no hero marks it, resting in truth and reaching the utmost. Truly difficult to seek outside, so one uses inner contemplation to remove blockage and open the dark flow. Thus immortals may be sought, but essence is hardest to perfect; perfected ones may be seen, but nurturing will and nature is hard; myriad spirits may be commanded, but purity and stillness are difficult. Therefore, the Great Unity Emperor Lord uses the purple chamber as mixture; the Mysterious Father and Mother use the three platforms as divine brightness; the eight primitives conceal mystery with true thought as the supreme purpose; secret words use the Nine Truths as inner scripture; divine methods use refined thought as the deepest; returning to infancy to penetrate truth is to gain spirit; the great cavern uses the supreme as primordial; the Great Elixir uses female-one and three primitives as inner essence; the Old Lord uses naturalness as morning honor; the Supreme uses no hero as mysterious essence; the Yellow Elder uses will and nature as the root of the dao; the White Origin uses purity and stillness as entry to truth; perfected ones combine qi and descend; immortal essentials use essence and response to complete the dao.

Thus Female-One advances into the mud pellet; the Emperor Lord guards the six palaces; the great cavern chants in the silent chamber; the eight sounds scatter in the nine voids; the seven tests receive wisdom from the fetal immortals; gain heavenly blessings from the divine directions; celebrate the Mysterious Father in the spiritual capital; congratulate the Mysterious Mother in the jade chamber; accumulated responses arise in one inch; transformations flourish on the sky peaks; bright eyes gaze upon the nine mornings; the body ascends the splendid carriage—how lofty and profound! Blessings beyond measure. These are the precious secrets’ noble practices; if the disciple contemplates thus, they shall ascend in broad daylight.

To read the *Great Cavernous True Scripture*, one must first read the Supreme Emperor Lord’s Twelve Wills, the Jade Pure Mysterious Mother’s Eight Gates and Intervals; next read the Central Yellow Elder’s *Cavern Chamber Five Spirits Scripture*; only after three years may one receive and read the *Great Cavernous True Scripture*. This guides and draws the divine fluids, penetrates the spiritual source, secures the purple chamber, purifies and brightens the mud pellet, nurtures the Great Unity, opens and releases the three passes, guards and stabilizes the nine revolutions, condenses and harmonizes the primordial spirit, mixes and transforms the three and five, the myriad transformations of the nine mysteries. Practice the fetal qi, gaze upon the Great Void, embrace the subtle spirit, the spirit plate empties, the twelve wills come with birth, the eight intervals contain truth and roam, guarded by the Yellow Elder, written by the Supreme, thus called Female-One, the origin of the cavern chamber. Read it ten thousand times and you shall attain the way of immortality. Yet if one has not transcended the floating light in the void, nor soared the carriage to the empty, nor ridden the storm reins, nor leapt the three mysteries, nor taken command of the eight lights, nor controlled the nine mornings, nor ascended into Jade Pure and become a High True One—only by reading the *Great Cavernous True Scripture* may one achieve these feats. But to practice Female-One, one must diligently and bitterly awaken the response, study the utmost subtlety; only after three years may one receive and read the *Great Cavernous True Scripture*. One must first guard the Great Unity, blend the Emperor Lord, transform female and male, preserve the principle of the Nine Truths; next chant the great vows, the twelve linked aspects; then sing the Mysterious Mother’s eight gates and intervals; then read the Great Elixir cavern chamber’s hidden mystery to fix immortality—thus called certain immortality.

Those called Primordial Lords are all goddesses of women. The Female-One cavern chamber three primitive primordial lords are these. One must first preserve and contemplate the three primitive primordial lords of the cavern chamber; only after three years may one receive and read the *Great Cavernous True Scripture*. The *Great Cavernous* is called the true scripture because preserving and contemplating the three primordial lords is difficult. Those who can subtly and mysteriously awaken essence and thought to the utmost, who preserve and see the three primitive primordial lords, then the perfected way is complete.

The White Origin Primordial Lord is the mother of the Right White Origin Lord; those who preserve and contemplate her essence become immortal. The Yellow Origin Primordial Lord is the mother of the Central Yellow Elder Lord; those who preserve and see her shall live ten thousand years, and beyond ten thousand years ascend the three mysteries. The Purple Origin Primordial Lord is the mother of the Left No Hero Lord; if one preserves and contemplates the cavern chamber and suddenly sees the three primordial lords, one immediately ascends in broad daylight, wearing flowing bells and tiger talismans, roaming the Jade Pure. The *Great Elixir Hidden Scripture* calls the three primitives the utmost essence—this is what it means. The cavern chamber three primitive primordial lords, White Origin, No Hero, Yellow Elder Lord’s mothers, hence called the three primitive primordial lords, all female. The three daughters share one mother, called the Great Primitive Three Primordial Lord. The Great Primitive Three Primordial Lord is truly one woman. This one woman gave birth to three daughters, hence called the three primitive primordial lords. According to records, No Hero, Yellow Elder, White Origin Lords are the children of the three primitive primordial lords, thus the grandchildren of the Great Primitive Three Primordial Lord. Conceived in the void womb, relying on splendor to be born, birth also in the Supreme Shangqing precious primitive nine mysteries Jade Emperor Heaven, then descending into the cavern chamber, ascending with the self. Their three sons and lords dwell in the celestial chamber of the Great Void, the room of the primordial void—White Origin, No Hero, Yellow Elder, all male. Born from the true void to form the three sons’ shapes, endowed with spirit and jade morning supreme qi, thus forming human from void and nothingness, not by yin-yang conception. Also, White Origin, No Hero, Central Yellow Elder are titles of Shangqing celestial true official ranks. Also, there are true immortal essences who receive books and positions, corresponding to these titles, not all born from void. Among the heavens, all have them. Those born from void are nearly the wondrous primordial elements, combining true elegant light, body equal to vast radiance, spirit encompassing the nine mysteries, born suddenly by response, cooperating with qi and skylessness, spirit fan ascending, rising and transforming ten thousand directions; thus breath before arising touches objects in accord, following the response wherever it reaches, heaven and earth intermingling. If the heart is not one, then a hundred worries arise; if the spirit is not subtle, qi is not true; if thought does not respond, the dao does not abide; if essence is not firm, the dao drifts far. Do not gaze upon corpses and blood, do not use death to harm life; do not pollute the heart with filth; do not be unchaste in color; do not be intoxicated on the dao; do not fill with five flavors; do not let two hearts contend; do not seek life by evil means; do not fear demons’ tests; do not regard ghosts as spirits; do not advance by fame and wealth; do not be adorned with beauty; do not treasure riches; do not act unjustly; do not delight in vulgarity; do not contend for worldly rank; do not disrupt the true by competition; do not be swayed by voices heard; do not be burdened by filth and pollution. True immortals leave your courtyard; preserve thought without response; truly it is due to the body not being refined. Those who can recognize the great cavern’s precepts, ten thousand spirits vanish and peace prevails. What people must avoid is many; if one must rein in the void and vastness, rest the heart at the cavern gate, keep the body plain and pure, spirit guarding the secluded origin, bowing at the master’s window, seeking to open the profound gate—if strong, one must be weak; if firm, one must be broken; then heaven’s sincerity is clear without outside, the cavern’s fragrance subtle without ears, and naturalness is rare; to learn and practice is difficult. If you must be Female-One, studying the great cavern, do not forget these words.

The *Great Cavernous True Scripture* does not exist anywhere on earth or among the Five Sacred Mountains. The Shangqing celestial true ones especially treasure and forbid it; one must fast bitterly for three years to receive it. Those who can read the *Great Cavernous True Scripture in Thirty-Nine Chapters* ten thousand times, when finished, the Central Yellow Elder Primordial Lord reports upward; the Supreme commands the cinnabar-green canopy chariot; the Nine Spirits’ emissaries, the Great Unity’s life officer, come to welcome the disciple. Then the Five Elders’ winged pavilion, the eight winds’ feather fans, divine lightning leading ahead, jade splendor supporting the yoke—one may ride clouds and dragons, ascend in broad daylight, visit the Great Primitive Three No Lords’ palace to receive the book.

Those who master the *Great Cavernous True Scripture* always ride the Yellow and Primitive Two Clouds, command thirty-two Jade Maidens and thirty-two Jade Boys, hold the blue-feathered baton, drive the blue light dragon, wear the divine tiger talisman, don the lotus crown, purple embroidered robes, cinnabar flying skirts, shake tinkling bells, strike jade bells, the jade true opens the moon-bright mirror, golden immortals wear the nine mysteries’ badge, purple canopy with four shades, splendid banners encircle the wheel. Also wear the nine red spotted patterns to seal mountains and summon clouds; at dawn ascend the Supreme Ultimate Golden Hall, at dusk roam the Great Splendor’s mystery center, carve and fix the golden book, become a High True One, command immortal writings, marshal ten thousand spirits, rank as Supreme Ultimate’s left minister, minor immortal king, attend the imperial court, feast in the golden court. If conducting the full ritual, condense light and bind brilliance, qi roams the eight primitives, body refines jade morning, concurrently chants three and five, embraces the nine truths, the great brightness conceals radiance, soaring jade mystery, raising and grasping to dispel demons, controlling flavors with tiger patterns—thus one obtains the reins of the Three Primes, fixes the jade truth book, returns the carriage to cold splendor, arrays the ranks of High True Ones, ranks as Supreme Ultimate’s left and right immortal lords, commands the five offices and three heaven immortal officials, Jade Boys and Maidens attend limitlessly. Like the Jade Emperor’s regulations, when opening the scripture one must screen left and right, wash hands, feet, face, and eyes before viewing. Always burn incense on left and right to show the high spiritual virtue, present a special case to distinguish the wondrous gate. Thus harmonious sounds arise in chant, soaring clearly through the eight mysteries, qi reaches the clear heavens, moistening the nine passes, summoning spiritual light’s hidden splendor, preserving the old and decayed for long existence. Then the subtle voice begins to chant, smoke scatters in the void, responding to the Supreme Emperor above, the cavernous Great Primitive’s original truth, bright qi nine revolutions, spirit essence eight scriptures, great blessings enjoyed on the mysterious leaf, primordial luck scattered among close kin—thus life and death both attained, fanning the seven generations, receiving transformation at the southern pass, ancestral tests preserved, body in the cinnabar palace, fixed rebirth of the fetal immortal. Great indeed is this wondrous scripture, lofty and spiritual chapter, profound and mysterious, blessings immeasurable. The chapters are as follows, scholars take note.

### Jade Scripture Secrets Composed by the Central Yellow Elder Lord

Those who receive the great cavern secret, the supreme first head of Female-One, the Emperor Lord’s supreme will, the Mysterious Mother’s eight gates, the golden splendor of the hidden sunlight—this is the forbidden scripture in the bosom of the Nine Heavens’ Emperor Lords. When transmitting to disciples, one must first announce fasts of one hundred days before and after, then a clear fast of one hundred days to receive it. Middle fast seventy days, lower fast thirty-nine days, bitter practice passed down thus. If one transmits without examining the person or without fasting, the master shall die, the receiver lose both eyes. If the fast is not bitter and strict, the master falls ill, the receiver loses speech. The master’s offering is heavy, not lightly treasured; disasters fall on disciples—guard mouth and eyes well. Serious offenses bring calamity to seven generations, calamities arise in ancestral tests. If one obtains this scripture, receives and practices it, do not offend or slacken; treat the three fasts as revering lord and father. The old secluded chamber in the quiet forest, as if no one is there. Preserve the five spirits in the purple chamber, as if the true spirit dwells there. If not lord, master, father, son, or brother, do not receive it; this shows the spirit’s truth not to be used lightly, clarifies the difficulty of guarding the prohibition. If not lord, master, father, son, or brother’s chamber, do not enter; this shows the narrowness of the foot, clarifies the embrace of solitude. If not lord, master, father, son, or brother’s clothing, do not wear it; this shows the fewness of heavenly kin, clarifies self-trimming by fullness. Study the subtle awakening of heavenly essence, sever all worldly thoughts, reach the utmost practice through bitterness; vanish traces with no light, three meals suffice by mountain stream, sincere secrecy applied near and far. Then swiftly speed to the Five Elders’ chamber, virtue raised to the Three Purities, preserve inner condensation in bright jade, let clothing and headgear be unsoiled. Recall the three primordials in the mud pellet, guard the nine truths in the form’s dwelling, exhale and inhale five splendors, breathe jade liquid, seek immortality morning and evening in the empty cavern, awaken spirit in the great desert, diligent and tireless—such a one may approach the great cavern’s gate, pre-seek the dao’s wondrous thought. Serve it and ascend the three mornings, roam the nine skies; violate it and perish in the three paths, enter the nine darknesses.

Those who transmit must let the scripture secrets emerge twice, not give all at once. First transmit the method secrets, as if commanding practice and contemplation, refining the five forms, sensing the purple chamber, flowing away filth and thinning purity, exclusively guarding the one, morning and evening calling the spirit. Thus the great elixir hidden mystery is called the *Golden Splendor Scripture*, the three primordial jade morning—this is Female-One essence. After cultivating and preserving Female-One for three years, one may then receive the *Great Cavernous Thirty-Nine Chapters*. Now having received this secret, one may also attain the secret’s matters and become immortal, without waiting for the *Great Cavernous True Scripture* to fully understand. Those who wish to roam the Five Mountains, survey the many peaks, preserve form and rest whiteness, protect longevity and kalpa years, yet not wish to soar far from the world, may on the year’s main fate day and the eight seasonal festivals simply recite the Jade Pure hidden blessing, internally contemplate all spirits once, no need to recite the jade scripture. Recite a hundred times, then qi joins the morning dawn, a hundred spirits entwine within; a thousand times, the three primordials descend, inscribe the name in the Emperor’s register, long preserve sun, moon, heaven, earth, and years; ten thousand times, the dao is complete, ride clouds and dragons, roam the great void, lead and gather immortals. This way is lofty and subtle, not transmitted to the untrue.

When sincerity and response are deep, true correspondence with light, the three primordials appear. Upon receiving this scripture, mysterious spirits descend and bestow, the Yellow Elder issues talismans, moves spirit and guides brightness, Five Elders scatter splendor, receive it in the void, ascend to the Great Void. To know the *Great Cavernous True Scripture*, also called the *Nine Heavens Supreme True Dao and Virtue Scripture*. This scripture’s creation is from the mysterious subtle, compiled by the Ten Directions’ Primordial Heavenly Venerable’s qi. The Queen Mother of the West received the dao from the Primordial Heavenly King, then jointly engraved it in the Northern Primordial Heaven, recording the land of the heretics, the spiritual realm of human and bird mountains, the peaks of Jiali. In the void, gathering the nine mysterious true unity qi, linked to the Shangqing eight true central Yellow Elder Lord, teaching those destined to be perfected, ascending the three mornings. Thus the world lacks its text; those who obtain it are few. On the faces of Jade Boys and Maidens shines jade splendor and golden dawn light, each with a radiant form; those without this may not wear the moon canopy to ascend Great Abundance, may not gather the magical herbs or pluck hidden splendor, nor ride the stormy swift chariot, climb the green pavilion’s shaft, ascend the nine skies. One must diligently contemplate and practice bitterly, carefully discern the spiritual subtlety, then the dao comes, the hundred truths aid. Those who cannot hold heart to practice and seek bitterness and quietude only blame themselves—what hope is there?

The great cavern scripture is the wondrous secret of the Nine Heavens, the first scripture of the Great Primitive Lord’s golden book. All are secretly guarded by the Central Yellow Elder Lord; the world knows not. Only the Supreme Mysterious has the golden pavilion jade name, jade slips and purple bamboo slips; the Three Primes have combined morning hidden records; the cinnabar terrace has yellow characters—those destined to be perfected may receive it. Reading this scripture ten thousand times, even in broad daylight one ascends heaven, mounts Shangqing, receives the Supreme Ultimate book, bows as a high immortal left minister. Yet merely possessing this scripture without reading it, the Supreme Emperor Lord of Taiwei Heaven pulls out the death register at the start of receiving the scripture, fixes the true record at the beginning of fasting, crosses the Supreme Ultimate, carves the name East Splendor, reports to the Supreme, records and seals the Tortoise Terrace; ten thousand spirits and a thousand gods claim to be Supreme Mysterious officials, their rank matching the Supreme Pure Immortal Elders. With this they roam the world without interruption. The immortal’s path always harmonizes with auspiciousness. If entering deep mountains, valleys, desolate marshes, many evil beasts, venomous stones, and lands of dragons, demons, and spirits, temples with strong ghosts—then facing north recite the *Great Cavernous True Scripture Thirty-Nine Chapters* three times, then knock teeth thirty-nine times and stop; then mountain spirits and hundred harms dare not offend you. Then facing north recite:

“Supreme Nine Spirits, Eight Spirits arrayed, I am the minor true morning Supreme Ultimate left minister, once received the master’s secret formula, banishing evil directions; also received the *Great Cavernous True Scripture Thirty-Nine Chapters*, left has tiger and dragon to repel evil, right has fire armor and golden blade, front and back command soldiers to lower misfortune; jade morning and jade maidens attend me burning incense; mountain spirits and chamber officers, quickly come to serve and welcome, to meet and open the great cavern’s supreme method.”

After the incantation, knock teeth twenty-seven times and stop. This is the *Great Cavernous True Scripture* incantation before receiving the scripture. Once the scripture is obtained, entering and exiting the dark and obscure, mountain spirits and evil ghosts dare not approach humans, commanding ten thousand spirits, summoning dragons and clouds, roaming the utmost mystery; the gods of famous mountains all come to serve, nothing is closed to you. Also Jade Boys and Maidens always attend the scripture’s guardians. Wherever you go, always remember and preserve it, often touching the heart with the hand, chanting:

“*Great Cavernous True Scripture*, Supreme Jade Emperor, restraining soul and spirit, myriad spirits come to meet.”

Next, rub the cavern chamber twenty-seven times, the yin incantation:

“Primordial Three Lords, purple canopy and splendid dawn, Jade Boys guard spirit, Jade Maidens calm souls, five viscera and myriad spirits nurture my body, long life in heaven and earth, above a high immortal, sun and moon rest, seven stars protect truth, Supreme received the book, three splendors uphold cause.”

After the incantation, knock teeth three times to repel internal and external evil (bad sheep) qi.

All those called Later Sages are lords who attained the way later. The Great Cavernous golden book, Supreme Emperor united truth, Three Primes array brightness, Supreme Ultimate harmonizes spirit, morning compares brightness, seven subtleties all clear—only then may one be called Later Sage. But merely reading this scripture, one may ride clouds and dragons, rank as true lord and minister, rest in nine mysteries, roar proudly in eight directions, spread wings in the Broad Cold, dance the wheel in the void—thus a perfected one only, not to be called Later Sage. But those who fast bitterly and practice this cavern scripture gain long life and immortality. If one has this scripture but does not fast and contemplate, mingling with the mundane, one does not lose hidden lower immortality, may dissolve the corpse in broad daylight, and when fate passes the Great Yin, fill the underworld’s lordship, or leave bones and fetus, receive transformation in the southern palace. Those with bone records who should receive this scripture must be immortal lords.

When immortals depart the world, some vanish traces and hide away, inwardly dwelling outside; some dissolve swords and replace forms, leaving only staffs and bodies, drifting lightly in clouds and mist, extending spirit and entrusting mystery, wandering among the mundane, few recognize their origin or trace. If famed mountains and Five Sacred Peaks, spiritual thought ripens, or long distant from the human world, severing worldly dust; or celestial true ones bestow books, high immortals transmit and announce; or move the Five Spirits, Three Primes reveal, secretly seeking secret enlightenment, silent and unmatched, joyous within the heart, body formed hidden in spirit carriage, suddenly ascending the splendid carriage, soaring and climbing the void chariot, fanning the empty cavern, feet suspended over the Five Mountains, hands grasping bright rosy clouds, qi nurturing blessings—awake or asleep, in a moment already ninety thousand leagues apart. Thus attaining the way is hard to record, subtle and profound indeed, not merely unbelief.

The cavern scripture is precious; those who have the scripture are masters, those who receive are disciples. With devoted heart and bitter effort, revere it without change. Receiving it, do not privately speak; those who speak will surely lose in the dark—each scripture lost reduces one Jade Boy and one Jade Maiden; the celestial true ranks are fixed in the Great Beginning. If spoken to two persons, no longer a perfected one; if to three, cannot be immortal. If spoken to those who do not believe in dao and virtue, Jade Boys and Maidens report to the Supreme High Jade Emperor Lord, then the destiny is lost, body perishes, scripture leaves unperceived. Or mountains burn, houses blaze, wind blades, kalpas, thieves, all bring calamity and loss. Destiny becomes lower ghosts, ancestral punishments fall—very sad indeed. Reading the Emperor Lord’s hidden books and practicing the three primitive cavern chamber Female-One, always keep a bright mirror, six, five, or four inches; copper and iron no restraint; only desire clear and pure, without flaw or stain; always hang it between head and bed to harmonize the three spirits, restrain all evil.

The *Great Cavernous True Scripture* is the jade secret of the celestial true ones, the original chapter of golden book and jade characters. Those who obtain it fly swiftly through the void mystery, ride clouds and mount emptiness, ascend to high immortals, live long and fly. Great Abundance is the purple palace of the Nine Heavens, hence named Great Abundance. Small Abundance is the chief of the thirty-six caverns of clear void, the treasure palace of cavern mystery, hidden essence, and morning. Great and small abundance and middle, spiritual books and divine scriptures, sometimes incomplete—only on the Western Tortoise Mountain, above the mysterious garden, in the shadow of piled stones, within the golden hall jade chamber, is there the great cavern eight primitives high mystery feather chapter, all complete. Those destined to attain the dao, with bone records as perfected ones, may receive it. Receiving it, one can ride clouds and dragons, command ten thousand spirits. Among the millions who study immortality, not one sees its chapters. The heavenly golden palace, the Fangzhu Qing Mansion, and Earth Officials all oppose; carved slips before birth, those who receive must hear it. Those who obtain it are all masters and friends of true immortals.

The *Great Cavernous True Scripture* summons the life officer and record officer, removes one’s own and remembered persons’ death registers, commands the Three Officials to request removal of mundane sins, and checks Mount Tai’s people’s fate registers. It has the method of seven revolutions of the cavern. One must first read the Supreme Ultimate Dao Scripture, then the True Yang Scripture, then the Great Unity Scripture, then the Nine Elders Scripture, then the Blue Youth Scripture, then the Later Sage Li Lord Scripture, then the Small Abundance Middle Scripture. When all are finished, in one month one may perform the five transformations and seven revolutions. The seven revolutions mean reading seven times, called one passage; in one month one may perform five passages, called five transformations. The cavern scripture has its own text and must not be overly elaborated. Summon the record officer, oversee the Three Officials, remove death registers, freely control them; when seven revolutions and one passage are finished, the record officer stands ready. When matters arise, also summon divine beings for spiritual response, to teach and awaken the disciple’s heart.

After the *Great Cavernous True Scripture* comes the three measures one zhang trembling spirit talisman, characters one zhang square, written in cinnabar on famous mountain stones, to summon the Northern Emperor life officer, Five Mountains perfected lords, and Mount Tai’s Three Officials. The disciple should sit on this talisman, face north, perform seven revolutions of the cavern scripture once, and ten thousand spirits arrive; ask about death and life, erase registers; one must claim to be the Great Cavern Doctor, Supreme Lord. This talisman is one talisman, or called the Three True Spirit Talisman, with separate secret instructions, using colored ribbons as ground cloth, one zhang square on each side, cinnabar writing filling it. The scroll’s size may vary at will; always keep it inside bedding, sit or lie on it while reading and reciting the cavern scripture, preserving thought of the Emperor One, to perform great cavern matters. Another method: sit or lie on this talisman, repel a three-foot square, allowing the talisman writing, not necessarily confined to one zhang.

The *Great Cavernous True Scripture* has the Western Splendor Jade Hall Immortal Mother Golden Elixir Scripture, which may be combined with clear fasting; when the elixir is complete and taken, one may return to the human world, eat and drink among the mundane, mingle with the dust of the world, thus called true immortals, secretly transforming the eight directions. If one reads the *Great Cavernous True Scripture* but does not take this elixir, then after ten thousand recitations, immediately ride clouds and ascend heaven, unable to remain in the world, delighting in mundane dust. If one takes this elixir for three hundred days, one may long roam the world.

Those who obtain the *Great Cavernous True Scripture*, the Supreme Ultimate perfected ones have all tested it before, then see this scripture, and no longer wait for ten thousand recitations to test. Master the scripture and annotations, gain the Supreme Ultimate Immortal Lords and Ministers, ascend the nine skies, serve the morning Three Primes. The great cavern’s inner true ranks have the Yellow Ning inner blessing method: Yellow Ning is the wandering spirit of the life gate, always with Lord Tao Kang, ascending into the Yellow Chamber, one inch above the nipple center. At dusk, knock teeth twenty-seven times, rub both breasts twenty-seven times, swallow saliva seven times, and chant:

“Lord Tao Kang, fetal born inner morning, pearl robe wearing bells, dispersing qi of seven sources, purple canopy splendid crown, rightly at the life gate, support body and calm spirit, gather and refine three souls, long life riding brightness, ascend in broad daylight, Yellow Chamber perfected one, wearing yellow essence, harmonizing true flowing qi, circulating one form, calling soul and restraining spirit, fulfilling long life, left guiding, right restraining, hiding body in yellow spirit, then riding cloud carriage, ascending to Shangqing.”

After the chant, the person’s soul and spirit rest peacefully, often with auspicious responses.

The *Great Primitive Supreme Spirit Scripture* says: Receiving the *Great Cavernous True Scripture* permits three transmissions within five hundred years; beyond this, no further transmission. If one reverses the fetal store and departs, extinguishing traces and leaving the world, at the final crossing, that person may be appointed. If no such person, their end returns to the Great Yin chamber; if not the person, father and son transmission violates ancestral tests, seven ancestors suffer calamity—be cautious!

### Great Primitive Perfected One Hidden Morning Worship Wish Supreme Immortal Method

Receiving the great cavern supreme secret, practicing Female-One, reading the Great Elixir Hidden Mystery Jade Morning Golden Splendor Scripture, one must monthly secretly worship the Great Primitive Three Primes. On the nights of the first month’s tenth day, second month’s ninth day, third month’s eighth day, fourth month’s seventh day, fifth month’s sixth day, sixth month’s fifth day, seventh month’s fourth day, eighth month’s third day, ninth month’s second day, tenth month’s eleventh day, eleventh month’s twelfth day, twelfth month’s thirteenth day, in a quiet sleeping chamber, burn incense facing north, hold the three primordials in mind, bow three times, then sit or lie at will, bow heartily and chant:

“Respectfully open the Supreme Great Dao High Void Jade Morning Great Primitive Purple Palace Three Primes Emperor Lords, Central Yellow Elder, No Hero, White Origin, Jade Emperor Great Emperor, Five Elders High True Ones, Supreme Ultimate Emperor Essence, Mysterious Emperor Jade Lord, I, [name], am the great cavern three-morning disciple, respectfully on auspicious night, between nine heavenly gates opening, petition the Supreme Great Primitive, Three Primes, Three Primitives, Jade Emperor True Lord before me, to grant long life, save the world, supreme longevity without limit for billions of years, riding splendid dawn green canopy dragon chariot, ascending to purple court, commanding ten thousand spirits, attending and guarding the Four Bright Great Primitive Emperor Lords.”

Finished, bow three times, swallow saliva nine times, then stop.

Always perform this, do not let others know. This is the Supreme Ultimate perfected one’s secret morning worship of the Three Primes, night wish method. Formerly, Chang An Jizhongzi, not knowing other ways, nor practicing great elixir, nor the Three Primes method, only occasionally obtained this secret morning way, guarded and practiced it for thirty years, then rode clouds and storms, ascended to the mysterious continent. Immortals Wang Lubing, Zhao Shuangcheng, Fan Shuyou, Guan Ping’a, Li Mingxian, Yan Ansheng and others all attained this way, ascending Kunlun’s chamber, or dwelling in the divine continent or mysterious officialdom. The Great Primitive Three Primes are women. Their virtue conceals void and nothingness, spirit high and supreme, teaching and regulating celestial true ones, governing myriad qi, accumulating response and jade brilliance, born in the morning sky, forming smoke and scattering light, dao ascends jade true. When the Three Primes travel, the sun and moon tilt and shine, rows of candles uproot roots, eight winds open waves, stormy boiling mysterious sources, linking brightness ninety thousand, high sky dances morning, crimson clouds spread thickly, yellow clouds nine wraps. Then the Five Elders open the path, Great Emperor supports the carriage, Western Emperor holds the banner, Eastern Splendor raises the flag, Nine Heavens revolve for them, Great Nothingness rises smoke, hidden qi veils, eight lights join dust, looking around at the utmost, bowing and raising among the hundred officials. Great indeed is the High Emperor, called the Great Primitive Three Primes. At night in the secret chamber, always hold the Three Primes, come into my chamber, bow and speak from the heart; if not replaced, all wishes fulfilled, myriad matters harmonize—this is the perfected one’s essential method to attain immortality. The Great Primitive Three Primes wear purple qi floating cloud brocade robes, nine-colored dragon brocade feather skirts, build precious jade morning supporting feather crown, waist flowing golden fire bells, tiger talisman, dragon book, sitting in the great void, knees always with cinnabar green three primitive clouds of qi, thickly covering true form. The Great Primitive Three Primes chant:

“Great Nothingness connects Jade Pure, three lights cavern high bright. Eight lights turn divine wind, scatter clouds veil flying spirits. Round wheel cast in cavern, gold reflects crown heavenly essence. Jade splendor binds Five Elders, purple smoke moves sky carriage. Riding qi stirring mysterious chamber, surrendering and ascending the path. Golden form shines in nine clouds, jade quality leaps cold court. Infant child returns gaze, elders revert to infant. Emperor One firmly mud pellet, Nine Truths guard Yellow Ning. Gazing beyond ten kalpas, matching the Nine Heavens’ tilt.”

Bow heart, swallow saliva three times, finished. When contemplating, recite this chant. This chant was composed by Jade Pure upper official’s song, harmonizing form and spirit’s qi. Those who preserve the Three Primes first make the drooping cloud triangular bun, other hair scattered down to the waist, bun wears the supporting morning crown only. If the disciple’s response is utmost, they will also see them in the purple chamber and sides. Between times, the Great Primitive Jade Maiden and Three Chamber perfected ones will come down to the disciple. To practice this way, always keep separate sleeping and solitude, not mingling with others; all matters likewise, not only this one matter.

### Great Primitive Perfected One’s Teaching for Beginners to Repel Evil Dreams

If one often encounters evil dreams, one is said to have: first, soul demons; second, heart tests; third, corpse thieves. There is a method to dispel and eliminate these. Upon waking from a dream, immediately sit up, use left hand’s second finger to pinch the philtrum three to seven times, knock teeth three to seven times, and softly chant:

“Great Cavernous True Mystery, long refine three souls, always guard seven spirits, first soul swiftly guards seven spirits, second soul swiftly guards mud pellet, third soul guards heart’s command. Quickly summon Great Primitive Three Primes: I have encountered an ill omen dream, these seven spirits wandering corpses come to assist, source of myriad evils, urgently summon Tao Kang to protect life, report to Emperor Lord, Five Elders Nine Truths, all guarding body gates Yellow Gate, Spirit Master Purple Door General, holding axe and bell, eliminate evil fluids, turn misfortune to auspicious, life and death no fate.”

Finished, lie down again, bell receives good response. The qi causing evil dreams is closed below the three passes. After three years, only by response will dreams occur. Dreams are like seeing future clear judgments. Almost no more evil dreams, and no ill thoughts. If at night one meets good dreams, auspicious and good, and the heart feels it is fine, then it is auspicious response. Upon waking, rub eyes twenty-seven times, quickly close eyes, rub palms from inside outward, knock teeth twenty-seven times, softly chant:

“Supreme High Essence, three-five cinnabar spirit, scarlet palace bright and clear, auspicious response reports feelings, three primordials guard spirits, Heavenly Emperor bestows scripture, all directions harmonize, flying immortal Shangqing, always with jade true, together meeting purple court.”

Finished. This great cavern secret is passed to those first crossing the ferry. Always on the nights of second month second day, third month third day, eighth month eighth day, ninth month ninth day, tenth month tenth day, in the sleeping chamber contemplate cavern secrets, alone without sleep is auspicious. That night Jade Boys guard the scripture, Jade Maidens guard the scripture, then report to Three Primes, with Supreme Ultimate ritual perfected ones, together in the chamber carefully examining the disciple’s words. That night always burn incense, left and right focus the heart, if awaiting something. Sit or lie contemplating, or read cavern scripture and recite truth, contemplate purple chamber, practice Female-One, intend thus; but do not perform other matters that night—not the way of seeking dao. If the day is clear, even better—not only keep vigil. At the start of receiving cavern scripture, always practice this.

### Jade Morning Bright Mirror Golden Splendor Cavern Chamber Female-One Five Elders Precious Scripture Method

This scripture is also called the Three Primes Jade Morning Scripture, also called Female-One Hidden Mystery Scripture, all treasured and cultivated by celestial true immortals. Thus it moves the three primitives, accumulates spiritual origin, three truths arise, riding the sky and driving morning, together shining and returning brightness, inwardly forming hidden root, transforming into a woman, body endowed with majesty and spirit, ascending sky and entering void, between the eyebrows five elders’ precious spirit, hence called Female-One.

Female-One cavern chamber three primitive high primordial lords are the Great Primitive Three Primes’ children, spirit opening the nine skies, clearing the dragon mystery, scattering flowers in jade void, fetal spiritual fluids, spirit qi flowing in bright brilliance, clear light refined under the armpits, three daughters all born, called the three primitive primordial lords. The three primitive primordial lords are daughters of the Great Primitive Three Primes. Purple Origin Left Primordial Lord, Yellow Origin Central Primordial Lord, White Origin Right Primordial Lord.

The White Origin Right Primordial Lord is the mother of the White Origin Cavern Yang Lord, child of the Great Primitive Three Primes. White Origin Primordial Lord’s name is Qi Ming Xiao Ren, styled Golden Gate Superior. She relies on mysterious accumulated response, cooperates qi subtle beginning, condenses precious five ways, receives fetal void, forming shape as woman. Her appearance always like a baby, wearing dragon-patterned white brocade robe above, white brocade flying splendor skirt below, head adorned with purple splendid morning infant crown, waist belt with divine golden two tiger talismans, left hand holds flowing golden fire bell, right hand holds Supreme Wisdom Scripture. White Origin Primordial Lord’s mouth always exhales white qi, wrapping and entwining the contemplator’s body, called Jade Morning White Treasure, the soul’s qi to fumigate me, making me immortal.

The Yellow Origin Central Primordial Lord is mother of the Central Yellow Elder Lord, child of the Great Primitive Three Primes. Yellow Origin Primordial Lord’s name is Yuan Hua Huang Ren, styled Great Zhang Superior. She accumulates fetal Great Nothingness, void senses cavern, condenses and scatters splendor, nurtures the mystery within, born female, called Yellow Origin High Primordial Lord. Her shining form has golden quality, appearance like infant, wearing yellow brocade cloud robe above, yellow gauze flying splendor skirt below, head adorned with purple splendid lotus crown, waist belt with divine golden two tiger talismans, left hand holds flowing golden fire bell, right hand holds *Great Cavernous True Scripture*. Yellow Origin Primordial Lord’s mouth always exhales yellow qi, wrapping the contemplator’s body, called Jade Morning Yellow Treasure Great Spirit, the five viscera’s qi to fumigate me, making me fly immortal ascend heaven.

The Purple Origin Left Primordial Lord is mother of No Hero Elemental Lord, child of the Great Primitive Three Primes. Purple Origin Primordial Lord’s name is Yi Yu Yuan Ren, styled An Lai Superior. She is refined sky entwining splendor, weaving Great Nothingness, void fetal shining, following qi nurturing splendor, accumulating habit of supreme essence, thus forming female body, spirit mirror eight directions, appearance like infant. Wearing tiger brocade purple splendid robe above, purple splendid dragon-patterned skirt below, head adorned with purple morning lotus crown, riding purple morning double pearl canopy, waist belt flowing golden fire bell, also wearing divine gold, moon bright two tiger talismans, left hand holds Supreme Demon Dispelling Scripture, right hand holds golden true jade light badge. Purple Origin Primordial Lord’s mouth always exhales purple qi, wrapping the contemplator’s body, called Jade Morning Purple Treasure Life Fetal Flowing Rosy Splendor Smoke, to fumigate my body, making me ascend bright morning, ascend Jade Pure upper palace.

The Golden Splendor Female-One Cavern Chamber’s location faces south, entering straight north between the eyebrows, one inch deep is the bright hall palace, two inches the cavern chamber, three inches the cinnabar field, four inches the flowing pearl, five inches the Golden Splendor Female-One cavern chamber palace, also called the Three Primes Five Elders Precious Palace. The disciple contemplates Female-One, blending female and male, always dwelling in this palace, repelling a one-inch square, the center of the one-inch square is perfectly round like a ring, the ring all brightly shining with cinnabar red light. Straight north, five inches deep, behind the nape, reaches the Golden Splendor cavern chamber palace, one inch square only. The disciple often on the eight festivals, new and full moons, and fate days, and Great Return Five-Penetration days, hidden morning Great Primitive days, uses life qi time, enters chamber quietly, fixes gaze and contemplates, suddenly sees in the Golden Splendor palace a golden hall jade chamber, within the round inch, vast and narrow, vague and fleeting, not bound by the round inch but formed at will in a flash. In the chamber is a purple jade couch, nine feet square, three feet high; on the couch sit the three primitive high primordial lords together, facing outward; left is Purple Origin Primordial Lord An Lai Superior, right is White Origin Primordial Lord Golden Gate Superior, center is Yellow Origin Primordial Lord Great Zhang Superior. Behind Purple Origin Primordial Lord’s nape, wears purple morning double pearl canopy, preserved clothing as above. Behind the three primitive primordial lords each is a precious shining qi, nine-colored round light, brightly illuminating the Golden Splendor cavern chamber. After a while, the three primordials exhale qi as above, three qi combine, entwining and attaching, suddenly transforming into a sun image, nine inches in diameter, in the Golden Splendor cavern chamber, brilliantly bright. In a moment, the sun’s qi smoke shines into the mud pellet, bright red and blazing; at noon suddenly the three primitive primordial lords embrace, all transform shape, each like a mustard seed, entering and filling my mouth, feeling dense misty qi. After a while, close eyes again, swallow saliva, swallow sun qi thirty-three times, then preserve the sun qi entering the three primitives’ bodies, penetrating my heart, descending to the navel, illuminating the body inside and out, limbs and five viscera, feeling cool and different; thus pouring soul and shaping, refining the Great Primitive. This completes the three primitives Female-One true splendor refining brightness, also called Jade Morning Three Primitives riding sun to wash form. After preserving Female-One completes, continue with the festival, also preserving the Emperor Lord and Five Spirits, etc. Also in the six directions purple chamber where one dwells, each exhales purple qi, pouring into my five viscera, thick as the sun’s first rising, illuminating the abdomen, penetrating all joints, sometimes one hundred bone joints. Then the five viscera each grow five-colored splendor, like lotus flowers. Suddenly see the three primitive primordial lords sitting together in the heart’s splendor; suddenly see the Emperor Lord Great Unity sitting in the liver’s splendor; suddenly see White Origin, No Hero, Yellow Elder Lords sitting in the lung’s splendor; suddenly see Life Officer, Tao Kang two lords sitting in the spleen’s splendor; suddenly see Mysterious Father and Mother sitting in the kidney’s splendor. Fix gaze and contemplate, after a long while finish, knock teeth twenty-seven times, softly chant:

“Supreme Jade Morning, nine subtle guiding smoke, Five Elders scatter splendor, Eight Spirits give birth gate, Three Primitives treasure qi, Supreme Mysterious Jade Morning, Golden Splendor Female Chamber, within is Purple Origin, mixing and transforming seven and nine, ascending Emperor Lord, sun qi flowing form, pouring and nurturing myriad spirits, infant form qi child, crowned with supporting crown, dragon robe green canopy, splendid robe tiger pattern, summoning spirit talisman, calling soul and spirit, nurturing me, generating me, with me long abiding, returning brightness shining thoroughly, securing mud pellet, supreme three qi, entering void and exiting cinnabar, always with Purple Origin, together arrayed jade immortals.”

Also chant:

“Yellow qi nine transformations, Central Primordial Lord, high void upright essence, void courtyard no source, yellow brocade cloud robe, flying dragon splendid skirt, holding cavern scripture, waist belt tiger truth, governing divine dao, roaming five passes, leisurely golden chamber, transforming refining celestial immortals, arrayed sitting five splendors, jade brightness shining pavilion, then together ascend void, broad daylight riding morning, refining brightness three five, seven nine myriad spirits, three mysteries six palaces, Emperor Lord always abiding, sun essence pouring form, round treasure entwining, forever remembering Jade Pure, with Emperor cause green.”

Also chant:

“Vast spirit upright birth, White Origin Primordial Lord, Supreme divine essence, responding and meeting eight gates, dragon robe tiger belt, yellow morning splendid crown, governing imperial register, overseeing jade chapters, female and male great mixture, myriad transformations countless thousands, with beginning no end, longevity like returning ring, each sitting in hidden splendor, Five Elders Eight Intervals, circulating purple chamber, driving brightness flying whirl, ascending to Nine Pure, gazing at Yang Gate, next roaming Yellow Chamber, resting at life gate, great subtle brightness, three primitives born in void, with me together roaming, long guarding infinity.”

When Female-One matters finish, spirit returns to Golden Splendor cavern chamber. When practicing and contemplating, one may also sleep sitting or lying, may place hands on knees, or sit on knees, as comfortable, at ease. Mostly facing one’s fate is best; do not rush but quietly contemplate.

The disciple preserving Golden Splendor cavern chamber Female-One essence must always sleep in a separate chamber, not mingle with clothing or food, forbid weeping, lest the golden chamber qi be lost, also do not desire weeping sounds, disturbing the three primitives. Also do not desire to see corpse coffins’ filth, lest spirit response not arise. Also do not desire to visit dying homes, tread on corpse stench. If taking substances not of the same kind, wearing not of the same qi, then the Three Officials’ response scatters, fetal spirit drowns, five pungent herbs act as axe to cut storage, wine and lust as knives to break the body. If preserving Female-One, deeply guard against this, do not violate it; violators face Supreme Mysterious dark tests.

The bed where the disciple sleeps must be high with thick mattress, not near the ground, avoiding evil qi and five poisons’ smoke, which always rises one foot of smoke, obscuring the disciple’s soul and spirit. When soul and spirit are troubled, contemplation does not respond—this is the practice of Female-One refined thought. Thus the Golden Splendor cavern chamber’s three primitive jade couch is about three feet high.

### Great Unity Emperor Lord Cavernous True Mysterious Scripture Preserving Five Spirits Method

The scripture says: First preserve Great Unity; Great Unity is the fetal essence, master of transformation. Soul and spirit are born from fetal spirit, life qi issues from the fetal palace, transforming and combining Emperor Lord, mixing and transforming into man. Thus Great Unity Spirit is mother of birth, Emperor Lord honored as father of birth. Great Unity’s names are Wu You Shou, styled Gui Hui Chang, also called Jie Ming, also called Ji Lei. These three names are the true names of the Three Primes cavern mysterious inner precious scripture; outside formulas and miscellaneous notes are all false and untrue. Now this name is not to be told to others; those who know it live long and never die, ward off myriad calamities, can summon divine spirit jade maidens to descend. Every evening one must preserve Great Unity in one’s body’s six directions palace, or preserve Great Unity beside the disciple’s left and right, sitting or lying facing back, present everywhere. All preserved at life qi time, then chant:

“Great Unity essence arises from Great Pure, soul and spirit receive transformation, form and shadow become spirit, commanding hundred spirits, restraining three yang, Emperor Lord mysterious smoke, combining true Gui Hui, inner calming essence qi, outer repelling calamities, removing death registers, extending life forever, clothing old and young, changing and impermanent, governing six directions, roaming scarlet palace, descending cavern gate, ascending mysterious village, mixing three and five, roaming and resting heavenly capital, calling and summoning sun and moon, transforming male and female, commanding and summoning registers, fetal sac, life and death fate, Great Unity supports and leads.”

Preserve Great Unity and the disciple’s form are exactly the same, clothing likewise. Thus the disciple’s body must always be fasted and pure and cultivated greatly, to seek meeting brightness with Great Unity. Nothing in clothing may be borrowed from different qi; such matters must be guarded. If the disciple cannot abstain from grains and refines essence and thought, then must abstain from pungent, foul, and bloody foods, mixed meats and spicy vegetables—one prohibition. If able thus, even better, to preserve life’s longevity.

Left No Hero Divine Son is master of congealing essence and solidifying spirit, spirit of Three Primes upper qi, essence congealed from heavenly essence, essence born returning to three qi. Thus No Hero Divine Son always commands spirit’s talisman fate. Named Xuan Chong Shu, styled He Fu Zi, also called Elemental Lord, also called Divine Son. Always in jade chamber Shangqing within, every evening preserve and contemplate, then chant:

“Supreme Jade True, imperial essence connected, Three Primes heroic qi, Supreme Mysterious purple morning, nine skies upright bright, five splendors produce smoke, yellow gate golden chamber, within is great god, holding steady flowing bell, crowned splendid crown, purple canopy returning storm, dragon robe tiger pattern, appearance like infant, four spirits cavern balanced, exit cinnabar enter void, combine form Emperor Lord, call yin summon yang, heavenly dao has truth, named Xuan Chong Shu, titled No Hero Lord, roaming nine paths, dispersing and transforming five constants, commanding essence to birth me, with me long abiding.”

Right White Origin Lord, also called cavern chamber lord, commands soul and spirit’s qi, regulates spirit liquid’s god.
