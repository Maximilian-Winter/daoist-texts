### Scroll One of The Cavern of Truth, Supreme Clarity, Azure Essentials, Purple Writings, Golden Roots, and the Assembly of Scriptures

Azure Essentials Emperor Lord is a disciple of the Nine-Yang Primordial Sovereign Jade Emperor. In the first year of the Central Sovereign era, in the eastern direction of the world, when Heaven first announced the dawn, the Lord was nurtured in the boundless Heavenly Jade Kingdom of the Mysterious Hill, beneath the seven treasures of the jade forest, on the shore of the nine domains of vast obscurity. His law and transformation responded to the patterns; three days opened the morning. His surname was Yao, given name Bo Kai. Beside him stood the Nine-Dragon Wing Lord; seven-colored jade phoenixes shaded his body; divine scales contained spiritual fungus to nourish the mysterious; heavenly maidens exhaled essence to behold the true; jade youth cast blossoms to dispel filth; divine consorts scattered fragrance to sweep away dust; with inhalation and exhalation he breathed the fetal breath.

His law manifested naturally; his splendid crown bore the numbers two and six; his face and hair shone golden; his body bore spiritual talismans; his speech resonated with golden inscriptions, displaying seventy-two colors; the cavern reflected the jade clarity; three mornings shone splendidly; six energies aligned in harmony. Mysterious clouds and purple canopies arose in the chamber; flying essences and flowing light illuminated the courtyard. He alone grasped the truth, his joyous countenance spiritual and lofty, his order harmonious with transformation, following the ebb and flow of fate. His heart rested in the realm of bright rosy clouds, wandering the ruins of the jade kingdom, holding the strategy of the Primordial Sovereign, descending upon the hills of the nine domains.

Freely roaming and gazing, through countless kalpas he journeyed, finally returning to the pure fasting cloud chamber. His dwelling was a house of purple clouds, a city of azure mists, a palace of gold, a bed of white jade. The five energies intertwined; high terraces connected with eaves; jade steps and patterned stairs; phoenix gates spread in four directions; golden youths attended his side; jade blossoms held his kerchief; heavenly immortals guarded him; over five thousand in attendance, a celestial hunt complete. Feathered riders like scales, dragons and tigers warding off evil, pairs crouching in tandem; mysterious energies converged in nine meetings; spiritual winds raised smoke; fragrant aromas stirred Heaven; a palace born of emptiness, flowing essences and jade light; reflecting the ten heavens; serene and lofty, uniquely performing spiritual chapters; consuming essences and swallowing energies; chewing the mysterious root; taking the elixir and returning with white jade wine; golden liquid flowing essence; jade forest forming blossoms; sun and moon imperial springs; refining bones and changing marrow; the whole body becoming true.

The Primordial Yang Sovereign Jade Emperor Lord, at that time, rode the azure mist nine-phoenix flying chariot, jade wheels and feathered canopy, accompanied by a thousand true ones from the mulberry forest, ten thousand chariots and countless riders, flying attendants of thirty-six immortals, feasting in the celestial court of Jingxiao, descending to the Lord. Together they ascended the capital of the Nine Elders Immortal City, the chamber of nine bends. They commanded the Western Terrace Turtle Mother to open the cloud phoenix’s essence, the purple brocade pouch, producing the purple script of true secrets and jade chapters, to bestow upon the Lord.

The Lord’s cultivation of the dao was complete; his rank ascended to Jade Clarity. The Most High Dao Lord granted him the flying cloud feather canopy, flowing purple phoenix emblem, golden truth, jade light illuminating the seven primordial golden divine tiger talismans, flowing golden fire bells, azure essence jade seals, nine-colored seamless emblems, single azure feather skirt, flying and ascending Supreme Clarity.

Thus he unleashed myriad transformations, revolving through five mornings, steering the void to summon the moon, capturing the sun and raising the wheel, cavernous transformations of separation and union, sharing spirit with the true, releasing form and escaping change, countless tens of thousands, ascending the three origins, paying homage to the jade palace, wandering the boundless, inheriting the nine heavens, entering and exiting the cavern gates, carrying the jade immortal contract, looking up to the Most High Primordial Supreme True, responding to energies and obeying destiny, holding the imperial dawn, commanding myriad daos, no immortal not related, governing the spirits of the ten heavenly mountains, rivers and sources, five sacred peaks and four seas, all subordinate to the Lord.

From flying the eternal chart in the purple void, the golden name in the azure palace, the purple writings cannot be glimpsed, the golden roots cannot be heard.

Azure Essentials is another title of the Purple Clarity Emperor Lord, who received the jade emperor’s purple script of wondrous secrets, all the essentials of the assembly of scriptures, secret above the nine heavens, writing the hidden texts of the eight assemblies. The Jade Emperor commanded the Most High Worthy True Sovereign to compile the precious catalog, combining the assembly of scriptures, writing with purple brush, binding with golden orchid, all arising from the ancient dao of the Supreme Sovereign, composed by the High Sage, collected into scrolls, transmitted to Azure Essentials Emperor Lord, who passed it to the Supreme Void Sovereign Primordial Spirit Dao Lord, who passed it to the Supreme Elemental High Spirit Cavern Radiance Dao Lord, who passed it to the Southern Pole Supreme Origin Lord, who passed it to the Heavenly Emperor Lord, who passed it to the Supreme Subtle Heavenly Emperor Lord, who passed it to the Later Sage Nine Mysterious Emperor Lord, who passed it to the High Minister Azure Youth Lord, keeper of the talisman jade palace.

Those with predestined fate, upon seeing this text, all are mysterious and gather in assembly, surely with immortal talisman fixed. The Jade Emperor’s treasured secret is not transmitted to the world. Those who speak falsely are pierced by the nine heavens, reported to the Emperor Lord, saying, “Your crime is great.” The Most High dispatches the five emperor divine soldiers to punish the body; death becomes a lower ghost, filling the rivers and springs. The seven ancestors receive interrogation by the Water Official. Scholars beware the regulations; keep it secret and revere it.

If one has golden bones and jade marrow, named in the imperial register, and obtains this text, one must follow the Nine True Mysterious Regulations, cultivate the method and measure, according to the oath and trust, with one golden dragon and one jade fish token, one hundred feet of purple silk, forty feet of azure brocade, going to the scripture master to receive instruction. Master and disciple observe fasting together for seven hundred days; according to regulations, seven hundred years have some who hear three transmissions. Those who do not follow the script, lightly revealing the secret chapters, their body perishes to the ghost officials, seven ancestors bear responsibility, never to become immortal.

All who cultivate the Supreme True dao chant the *Yellow Court Jade Radiance* root ten thousand times, open the three palaces, illuminate the hidden passes, then may cultivate the Purple Writings Jade Secrets, summon the true and call forth spirit, the method of white sun ascending mystery.

“Qi transforms into spirit, corpse changes entering mystery, three transformations five refinements, ascending into nine heavens’ kalpa, changing Jia body, Jia body transforms again, able to become true man.”

Finished. If male dead, think of three golden youths; if female dead, think of seven jade maidens; request porcelain water to irrigate the corpse. Finished, wash hands and face with the water, look up and spit, finished, then chant in the yin:

“Heavenly qi now clear, human transformed now born, able to live above heaven, nine transformations receiving form, five sufferings three paths, sever death name, transcend to end soul, return to southern court.”

Stop.

The Purple Writing Secret says:  
All who study the dao, roaming the world, suddenly encountering a dead corpse on the path, foul qi drying the body, should stop for twenty-four steps, facing due north, knock teeth nine times. For male corpse think of three golden youths, for female corpse think of seven jade maidens, come to request the body in the jade valley, royal fungus pure water to irrigate the dead corpse, in a moment, the corpse is reborn as a person, then chant in the yin:

“Already withered now flourishing, already extinguished now born, able to live above heaven, again receive great spirit, nine heavens’ kalpa, repeated fetal infant, accumulated destruction, white corpse reborn.”

Finished, wipe eyes and hands twenty-seven times and stop.

Thus the foul qi is resolved, the dead receives transformation, later becomes a spiritual person. When encountering twenty-four steps, practice this refining chant, merit full and virtue increased, name inscribed Supreme Clarity, twenty-four years, able to ride cloud wheels, flying through nine mysteries.

### The Primordial Heavenly King Scripture

The Primordial Heavenly King received the natural progeny of Heaven, formed his shape from the undifferentiated mists, entrusted his body to the void-born fetus, born at the boundary of emptiness. At that time, the mysterious radiance was not yet divided, heavenly light dim and vast, immense and boundless great void. After accumulating over seven thousand kalpas, Heaven cleared and qi purified, two radiances entwined, mysterious clouds and purple canopy reflected upon his head, six qi electrified his true form, night born self-illuminating, divine light lighting the chamber, scattering fragrant smoke of emptiness, resting heart in the realm of celestial mists, refining visage on the shore of the cavern, alone riding the spiritual talisman rhythm, resisting mysterious descending chapters, internal qi mysterious cliff, daring to imagine the profound and remote, suddenly roaming freely, flowing and forgetting rotation, jade wheels and jade chariots, azure carriage and mysterious dragon, flying essences and flowing mists, shining lightning in the void palace, eastward roaming the azure water grand forest realm, resting above the azure mist nine bends chamber, advancing to the golden gate, receiving the title Jade Clarity Purple Void Most High Sovereign.

Hence named *The Capable Writing Great Cavern of Truth Scripture*.

Its dao is supremely honored, born together with the Primordial, Most High wondrous transformation, measure hard to surpass, flowing sounds trillions without ceasing, scripture renewed after myriad kalpas, without golden slips or jade names, none may hear or see. Later disciples, diligent and noble in aspiration, abandoning burdens and forgetting dust, silent heart in the long hills, facing morning sky, fasting and bitterly contemplating, weary but not daring to sleep, present golden slips and jade tablets, record name in jade clarity, then receive the *Great Cavern Scripture Secret Formula*, establish the three origins, uttering sounds that shake the nine heavens.

Those who obtain this chapter, root of Supreme True, with golden slips and jade names recorded in Eastern Splendor, become true men, chambers summon void-born radiance, halls descend hundred harmonies of smoke, jade flower attending, golden morning guarding form, cavern mirror reaching the edge of heaven, coordinating three lights to communicate truth, moving five mornings to drive chariot, steering flying dragon to govern wheel, ascending the three elements’ palace, paying homage before the Supreme Emperor.

The Most High Primordial Sovereign’s secret, the Most High Dao Lord’s utmost truth, subtle as the Primordial spiritual transformation secret text, entrusted to High Minister Azure Youth Lord, keeper of the Eastern Splendor record, to transmit to later sages who are to become true men. Its dao is treasured and secret, not transmitted to the world, lightly leaking the divine text, body serving the dark abyss, calamity reaching the seven mysteries, long filling the lower ghosts, never to become immortal.

High Minister Azure Youth Lord says:  
Golden slips and jade tablets come from the Most High Spiritual Capital palace, carved in jade as tablets, bound in gold as slips, written in vermilion characters, tied with purple cords, always shaded by mysterious clouds and purple canopies over the chamber, hundred harmonies of incense spreading in the courtyard, dispatching western jade maidens and golden morning youths each three hundred, overseeing spiritual texts.

The Primordial Heavenly King received from the Most High Dao Lord, its truth and regulations transmitted every seven hundred years in three transmissions. All learners, even if not receiving this text, their names have already been recorded in the Azure Palace, but without golden slips or jade characters. The leading immortal attendant and record keeper of jade officials always inspect the subtle and coarse; those diligent and bitterly aspiring are all granted mysterious transmission, to present names to the Jade Emperor of the Three Origins Eastern Splendor, then the Most High dispatches true men to grant their true scripture.

Later sages and all true ones, none do not first present slips to Eastern Splendor, cast jade tablets in Supreme Clarity, then receive the *Great Cavern Scripture*, fasting and bitter cultivation, becoming true men.

Those who are beginners, without golden slips recorded in Azure Palace, jade rules without mysterious bindings, divine scriptures cannot be granted, demons cannot be subdued, true spirit never descends, jade maidens never guard the body. Now therefore, according to the Most High’s regulations, copied and arranged by grade, to open the way for later learners. Those with heart should increase fasting, supervise diligent aspiration, focus on the mysterious true, deeply moving the Jade Emperor, present slips to Azure Palace, then may recite and chant the divine scripture, interpret the hidden mystery, the Most High may dispatch cinnabar chariots and flying carriages to welcome the body to ascend jade clarity.

Yet this scripture’s prohibitions are especially strict, not to be transmitted to the world. Those not true, lightly transmitting, calamity reaches the seven mysteries, body suffers wind blade punishment.

Those with golden slips and jade names are said to present to the Three Origins. According to depth of study, golden youths and jade maidens guard the body. If there is leakage, disrespect to truth or law, reported by golden youths, even with golden slips, one is removed and renamed ghost official, body suffers wind blade punishment, seven mysteries ancestors’ fate is sealed by the mountain stone, filling the night river.

The Primordial Heavenly King received the Most High’s casting slips seeking immortality supreme method, three presentations of slips and tablets, within nine years, the Jade Emperor may descend cinnabar essence, jade fungus, dragon seals, phoenix emblems, Tai Ji true man comes to descend the child’s chamber, Three Origins dispatch twelve golden youths and twelve jade maidens, High Minister Azure Youth reports to the Five Sacred Peaks, granting immortal officials flying mist mysterious canopies, welcoming the body to ascend golden gate palace.

The Most High’s treasured secret text, not transmitted to the world, thus entrusted to High Minister Azure Youth to keep records, verifying true immortal registers, transmitting to those destined to become true men. If one has suitable bones and qi, or earnestly seeks and bitterly contemplates, deeply moving Supreme Clarity, able to see the above text, their name is immediately recorded in Azure Palace, according to regulations present slips, becoming true men. The Most High sends thirty-six western jade maidens to guard the Southern Pole purple chamber.

Azure Youth Lord says:  
Those with bones and qi corresponding to the mysterious, able to see this dao, know the method of presenting slips, become true men. But the regulations are especially strict, not to be lightly leaked. Among the billions of learners, how many truly meet the truth? Thus the Central Yellow Elder says: “Those who see the *Great Cavern Scripture Thirty-Nine Chapters* will ascend in broad daylight.” Yet some cultivate for many years without success, saying the scripture is not true. This is all because Eastern Splendor lacks golden slip records, Golden Gate lacks jade tablet names, the truth does not descend, but demons ride upon it, hence no response, only obtaining divine scripture, none truly succeed. If first presenting golden slips to Azure Palace, offering jade tablets to the Emperor, receiving golden morning youths and western jade maidens to guard spiritual chapters, universally dispatching to all heavens and earth, three realms acclaim good, chanting chapters ten thousand times, how could there be no response to summon jade chariots and purple carriages?
