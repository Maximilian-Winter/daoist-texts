### Scripture of the Sevenfold Revolutions and Sevenfold Transformations of the Celestial Dance of the Perfected True of Supreme Clarity of the Divine Land

**Supreme Sovereign Master Purple Dawn Lord’s Scripture**

The Divine Land lies north of the Heavenly Gate, the sun and moon revolve southward, the seven stars spin their wheel at the center; by day, the eight celestial latitudes turn leftward, by night, the seven meridians turn rightward. The seven stars circulate in orbit, the heavenly light returns with numinous potency. This is the measure of transformation bestowed upon the Supreme Sovereign Purple Dawn, who then cultivates the method of the sevenfold revolutions, ascending to the Jade Clarity.

The Supreme Sovereign Master Purple Dawn Lord is born of the Two Radiances, formed from the essence of King Dawn; nurturing the dragon’s mist in the vast void, enveloping the purple emptiness in spiritual communion, entrusted to the Nine Profundities to contain the refined, condensing the great dew to become spirit, tempering the Three Vitalities to self-imbue, following the mysterious mother’s scripture to generate by method, enduring kalpas to receive transformation, responding to auspicious days to cleanse the form. Thus, in the first year of the Supreme Sovereign, the Heavenly Jia morning dawned, born at the Heavenly Eight Scenic Sites of the Divine Land, by the shore of the Cavern Abyss in the Central Plain of the Level Hills. His name and taboo: Po, styled Tiger Admonisher.

At birth’s dawn, his face shone with golden radiance, his body reflected jade light, adorned with five-colored purple emblems, manifesting seventy-two transformations, the essence illuminating his jade visage. The divine dragon breathed forth the magical herb to nourish, the phoenix and luan birds danced their wings to stir the mysterious, the cinnabar firmament scattered light upon the jade pavilion, flowing brilliance dazzled the distant truth. The two lights paused their radiance at the eight bright points, the seven origins returned essence to support the dawn, golden immortals scattered fragrance to stir the air, divine consorts cast blossoms to emit smoke, the five latitudes wove their cords, divine refinement adorned the purple heavens.

At the age of twenty-nine, roaming freely at the mid-origin, he consumed essence and swallowed breath, inhaled and exhaled the spiritual spring, contained the magical herb within to nurture, condensed the spirit embryo immortal, drew in and guarded silence, detached and natural, contemplating subtle thoughts and vital breath, never wasting time, accumulating the feeling of the profound origin, his name transcended Supreme Clarity, receiving the title Primordial Sovereign, ascending to the Purple Dawn throne. Orchids and phoenixes responded with auspicious signs, following the flow of fate, the spirit held the five luminaries, the form encompassed the seven origins, flying through the firmament in revolutions, riding the void and weaving smoke, the host of immortals opened the path, the Three Ways united in brilliance, lightning flashed forth might, the swift chariot traversed the Nine Profundities, ascending again the jade steps, thrice paying homage at the Purple Court, roaming the jade palaces, feasting on the three origins of light, holding covenant with the Five Elders, honored guests of the jade firmament, flying beasts reared and pranced, divine phoenixes soothed with calls, grasping great reins, the spirit wind scattered fragrance, flowing scents surged, lush jade clarity, golden youths climbed clouds to attend the wheel, jade maidens trod the void to guard the spirit.

He journeyed eastward to the pavilion of green waters and mulberry wood, to the pure cavern of vast spirit and utmost clarity. The god king of the Sunny Valley, chief of immortals and jade officials, summoned the Nine Profundities’ primordial chart, the azure essence and verdant spirit, the ninefold transformation’s light, the sun’s radiance and the dawn’s bright chapter, to refine true transformation of form, to roam the upper cavern palace, westward to the mysterious feathered white wilderness, to the western ridge and the shores of the misty expanse, the Purple Tenuity jade hall.

The Queen Mother requested the brilliant spirit’s pure chapter, the Turtle Mountain primordial register to determine the true sovereign’s rank, to bestow the title Purple Sovereign, journeying southward to the Vermilion Mound, the great cinnabar extreme flame and flowing fire land, the sun’s jade palace with nine tiers of jade terraces.

The Southern Pole Primordial Sovereign requested the Great Elixir Cavern Origin Fire Bell, the seven luminaries’ jade chapter, the golden true jade light, to summon the two radiances’ jade essence, to refine and transform the sevenfold changing form, journeying northward to the cold land of the Northern Yin and Nine Profundities.

The Great Lady of the Moon’s Jade Dawn, the nine origins’ true consort, received the flowing essence and flying radiance’s precious chapter, desolate and clear the nine luminaries, bright and open the seven origins, to open the Heavenly Gate, morning feast at the jade capital, ascending first to the Primordial Origin’s scene at the jade capital, the towering terraces and winding chambers.

The Venerable True Elder and Most High Dao Lord received the Three Heavens’ orthodox dharma, commanding the Six Heavens, receiving the nine-seamed flying essence chapter, wearing the flowing golden phoenix seal, ascending to the Purple Dawn Supreme Sovereign Master. Thus, the numinous brilliance shone forth, golden visage radiant and serene, body crowned with the dharma robe, head adorned with the purple patterned flying frost seven-colored crown, attended by countless tens of billions of maidens and immortals, flying dragons and venomous beasts guarding the jade pavilion, night bright with natural divine candles, the chamber spreading ethereal fragrance, the wind drums the mysterious banner, swirling and dancing in profusion, howling through the great void, jade sounds stir the reeds, ethereal chants and flying songs, the eight responses gathered, luan calls and phoenix blasts, pure music of profound peace, the numinous essence reflected, the three dawns paused their canopy, myriad true beings honored and celebrated, none failing to revere and rely upon it.

Following the Divine Land’s gates, the desolate endless pavilion, regulating the three-five cycles of fate, rescuing and transforming to bear the Tang’s calamity, governing the two principles in the mysterious chart, summing the Supreme Sovereign’s legacy, quietly chanting in the jade pavilion twice, bowing to the dark depths for contemplation, vast and majestic the three passes, the secret chapter opens the rhyme, commanding the singing of profound hearing, the bright model responding in praise, the ethereal voice gallops forth, the cavernous grace shines brilliantly, stirring the eight winds to hasten the body, capturing the flowing lightning to raise the essence, summoning the Six Jia of the Five Phases, commanding the martial troops of the Heavenly Dings, sealing the Five Sacred Mountains to serve as chariots, dispatching mighty edicts to rouse the spirits, transforming the celestial heavens in the Divine Land, revolving the sevenfold revolutions in the wondrous court, summoning the void to self-imbue, wearing the jade talisman to ascend the form, weaving the mysterious images in sun and moon, circulating the seven vital breaths in the Dipper stars.

Thus, drifting through the nine domains, the noble youth rides the chariot, the life officers align the wheel, roaming and feasting at Purple Dawn, commanding the Cavern Abyss, governing the host of immortals, from Heaven down, none fail to serve the Supreme Sovereign, all by the wondrous way of the sevenfold transformations.

**Scripture of the Sevenfold Revolutions of the Divine Land**

The path of the sevenfold revolutions and sevenfold transformations was received by the Supreme Sovereign Purple Dawn Lord from the Nine Heavens’ parents. Cultivating the dao to completion, he transmitted it to the Mysterious Response Supreme Heavenly Sovereign, who passed it to the Three Heavens’ Jade Youth, who passed it to the Purple Pole True Primordial Lord, who passed it to the Heavenly Emperor Lord, who passed it to the Southern Pole Primordial Lord, who passed it to the Supreme Heavenly Emperor of the Great Microcosm, who passed it to the Later Sage of the Golden Gateway, who passed it to the Supreme Minister Blue Youth Lord. Thus the true lineage was established, wisdom spanning myriad kalpas, one transmission after another, a small secret formula compiled by the queen, sealed in the western mountains. Those who obtain it all reverently welcome the Holy Sovereign at the Supreme Clarity Palace, providing each Jade Youth and Jade Maiden with twenty-one attendants, guarding the spiritual texts, protecting those who possess the scripture.

The Supreme Sovereign’s sevenfold revolution path is recorded on crimson slips and purple books, secret within the Purple Heaven’s Primordial Terrace, jade chamber, golden room, bestowed only to those who have already become true immortals, not taught to beginners. All who receive the *Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Perfected True*, *The Female One Jade Inspection*, and *The Great Marvelous Scripture*, and understand the dispersal of stagnation, extracting the seven mysteries, yet do not know the method of the sevenfold revolutions, cannot be said to truly chant the jade chapters.

The chapters of the sevenfold revolutions are all melodies of the Divine Land, exalted and supreme tunes, operating through Heaven and Earth, interlacing with the three dawns, turning left and right, converging at the cavern gate, transforming five into two to respond to the seven origins, revolving three into five, weaving the latitudes of the Heavenly Gate. The way is exceedingly wondrous, thus called the Celestial Revolutions. One cycle is clear and uninterrupted, seven revolutions and eight recitations, the three lights fully true, the Five Elders fixed in the registry, the life officers change the chapters, dispersing knots of the past, severing the fetal root, opening the nine ancestors above, returning to the fetal immortal, commanding and controlling through a thousand autumns, binding ten thousand demons, cultivating it ten thousand times, ascending to Purple Dawn.

Those who cultivate the sevenfold revolution path must first read the chapter of the Fifth Most High Dao Lord, next the chapter of the Three Origins’ Purple Essence Lord, then the chapter of the True Yang Elder Mysterious One Lord, then the chapter of the Blue Spirit Yang Peace Lord, then the chapter of the Sovereign of Supreme Clarity Perfected True, then the chapter of the Nine Heavens’ Most True, then the chapter of the Primordial Most High Jade Emperor. This completes the sevenfold revolution, encompassing the Primordial Most High.

Then read the Supreme Sovereign’s Dao chapter, next the chapter of the Sovereign Emperor Lord, next the chapter of the Sun Lord, next the chapter of the Most High Supreme Elemental Lord, next the chapter of the Central Yellow Elder Lord, next the chapter of the No-Shadow Central True Elder Lord, next the chapter of the Sovereign of the Original Purple Void, then again the chapter of the Most High Dao Lord. This completes the eight latitudes, converging at the Most High’s governed Jade Capital Mountain.

Then repeat as before, starting again from the fifth, completing seven cycles. Thus one responds to the Jade Emperor above, myriad true beings honor the music, below summoning myriad realms, binding the true form, refining diligently for one hundred days, bathing away filth and dust, sitting atop the spirit’s vibration, chanting the sevenfold revolution chapters ten thousand times, the dao perfected, ascending by day to Heaven.

The Most High Jade Chapters are secret and to be practiced reverently; do not reveal them to the unworthy. Leaking the numinous chapters is a sin that destroys the self, testing the seven mysteries’ flow.

Those who cultivate the sevenfold revolution path must on the first and fifteenth days of the month, and on the eight seasonal festivals, fast and purify, enter the chamber at noon facing east, read the sevenfold revolution chapters eight times and stop; at midnight facing north, read seven times and stop. One day and night combined make fifteen revolutions, thus responding to the Heavenly Gate, operating the three lights; in the middle, harmonizing one form, opening the passages and strengthening the spirit; below, controlling ten thousand demons, pacifying and extinguishing a thousand spirit wheels in harmonious rotation, participating in the fivefold brightness. Those who fail to learn this path die entering the nether darkness, refining spirit with bitter thought, overcoming to ride the flying chariot, ascending Purple Dawn, roaming and feasting at Jade Clarity.

Those who possess the Divine Land’s sevenfold revolutions and sevenfold transformations of the Celestial Revolutions path command twenty-one Jade Youth and twenty-one Jade Maidens, roaming the Five Sacred Mountains, weaving the mysterious cords of the blue fur season, riding the azure radiance dragon, wearing the divine tiger talisman, donning the hibiscus crown, wearing purple embroidered fur cloaks and cinnabar blue flying skirts, ringing golden bells, jade true purple canopies, flowery banners, bearing the nine red striped talisman to seal mountains and summon clouds, ascending to the Purple Pole Golden Hall.

If one cannot yet transform the scene and soar the firmament, then one cultivates this path among humans. The Nine Heavens’ parents, Supreme Sovereign Purple Dawn, also bestow the method, clothing, flying immortal feather chapter to the body, but it does not manifest in the noisy dust of the world. Those who cultivate this path must always wear this chapter clothing, ride dragons and command clouds, after seven years can attain true spirit and manifest form, ascending Purple Dawn.

Follow the Most True’s regulations, seven thousand years listening to three transmissions, within seven hundred years there will be such a person, also hearing the transmission.

Recipients must offer one jin of true pearls, thirty-two chi of blue pattern, five liang of gold, to pledge the Nine Heavens not to leak the trust. Loving wealth and coveting dharma is the same sin as greed. Lightly receiving treasures and scriptures, sincerely responding to the Jade Emperor. Elixir to report response, faith to clarify the heart. Without faith, what use is it in the floating world?

Such learning will sink into the valley ten thousand zhang deep, yet hope to climb the cloud path—how distant indeed! Cherish wealth and honor the dao, though the dao is secluded and silent, the hidden inspection is already clear, there will be steps ascending the heights, creating true existence is the way.

Now this chapter is compiled to transmit to those responding to immortality, not for ordinary talent. Lightly revealing the precious text, proclaiming the Most True, the seven ancestors and grandparents will charge the ghost officials, operating the stones of Mount Meng, filling the river of night, myriad kalpas reborn inhuman ways, body subjected to wind blade punishments, naturally losing the scripture, never attaining immortality. Recipients must keep secret and be cautious.

All Supreme Clarity precious scriptures three hundred scrolls, jade formulas nine thousand chapters, talisman diagrams seven thousand sections, all issued by the Primordial Most High Jade Emperor, inheriting the chapters of nature and the ancient dao. Students who obtain these chapters immediately ascend to true sovereign.

The way’s secret lies above the Nine Heavens, the palace of Great Unity, passing down jade writings, entrusted to the Supreme Minister Blue Youth Lord, sealed in the Jade Splendor Blue Palace; by the first year of the Primordial Radiance, compiled into one volume, sealed in the western city mountains.

The old regulations all transmitted once in myriad kalpas, after the Six Heavens’ retreat, the Three Ways clarified, fate hastened, the supreme dao must be practiced, regulations changed to seven thousand years listening to transmission, if within seven hundred years there is sincere heart, bone corresponding to mystery, recorded as Supreme Clarity, all may receive the pledge and transmission.

Those who obtain this scripture, able to become true immortals, cultivate in order, nothing lacking in principle, dao fully accomplished, qi sufficient and dao complete, then by day ascend to the dawn.

The Emperor Lord commands the Fusang Great Emperor Sunny Valley God King’s thirty-one volume independent formula, all encompassing Heaven and Earth’s fate, Yellow Court jade radiance, regulating the five viscera, opening and smoothing spirit gates, chanting ten thousand times, also able to fly and soar.

All students must first receive the bright regulations, extracting sins and redeeming faults, opening and releasing the seven mysteries, causing sins to vanish the nine yin, blessings born in Supreme Clarity, then able to receive golden slips and jade tags, report names to the Blue Palace, receive the open seven origins, flowing golden fire bells, golden true jade light golden mysterious feather chapter, commanding and controlling the Six Heavens and Three Heavens’ orthodox dharma, dispelling demons supreme scripture.

Next are the Nine Truths Eight Dao Spirit Books purple texts, clothing and commanding sun and moon summoning clouds and rosy clouds, yellow and white grades of forty-four directions, curved plain formula words of the Five Phases summoning souls, strategies for void chariots without purple degree flame light, flying feather scriptures stepping seven origins, three nine plain language blessings commanding five directions, yellow qi yang essence sun moon clarity, gold matching jade pendants two radiances mingling, three origins jade inspection firm spirit precious truth, Divine Land sevenfold revolutions eight transformations Celestial Revolutions, connecting Heaven and Earth, equally revolving day and night.

Thus able to recite the Great Perfected True Scripture thirty-nine chapters, extracting and crossing the seven ancestors, receiving birth in the southern palace. The Female One Jade Inspection Five Elders precious scripture, golden splendor jade chamber hidden morning three origins. The Great Marvelous Scripture cavernous mysterious pure spirit, Great Elixir hidden book five registries precious spirits. Three wondrous precious writings, ten thousand times ascending the mysterious, also commanding spirits flying hiding scene records form, seven stars moving degrees opening the three passes of heaven, hidden earth eight arts cinnabar scene dao essence, seventy-two transformations myriad changes instantly formed, mingling the One Emperor Five Spirits fetal birth.

Fully practicing myriad scriptures, dao full and qi abundant, above and below mutually assisting, great and small equally numinous, ascending fasting entering chamber, secluded thinking and contemplating birth, true spirits descending in response, three origins visiting chambers, crossing walking twisting and contracting, spirits scattering qi dispersing, empty body solitary study, like soul without form.

If one desires greed and fullness, not following the root, lightly revealing the three treasures, shaking and moving the Nine Heavens, the Three Officers holding, binding sins in the four brightnesses, within three years, body perishes to ghost officials. Not blaming oneself, but resenting dao scripture, not dao but betraying people, freely among the bodies.

Those who deeply study, receiving precious texts, must examine the regulations and grades, cultivating in order, nothing not responding, principle nothing incomplete, dao nothing not descending, form nothing not immortal, ten thousand times dao complete, ascending by day to Heaven.

The supreme scriptures three hundred titles, each Most True having its own endowment, also not all complete, later accumulating learning, also unable to equal the Most True’s cultivation. The world’s people mostly muddled qi, thus learning has order and rank regulations.

If cultivating the thirty-one volumes composed by the Great Emperor, dao complete then one obtains what one desires. Beginners must not directly seek what they want, thus harming bright regulations, their test is very severe, deeply each must be cautious.

---

**Small Heavenly King says:**  
Those who cultivate the thirty-one volumes, obtaining the order, elixir clear and pure, the Great Emperor will send the Supreme Ultimate True Immortal, again bestowing many scriptures of bow and rise patterns. Students diligent and earnest, always without loss, able to attain flying and roaming feasts at the Jade Capital.

Those who receive the supreme scripture must watch their mouths and speak cautiously, not turning away from one to another, dao teachings and scriptures, doubting heavenly truth, revealing to the world, destroying fellow students, falsely claiming sages, only able to overcome oneself, fabricating heavenly spirits, attacking teachers and friends, plotting rebellion and unrighteousness, claiming to have the dao fully complete wondrous scriptures.

Such are all held by the Four Officers, reporting to the Great Emperor, seven ancestors and grandparents collecting and binding ghost officials, closing the hells long, body subjected to wind blade punishments, never attaining immortality. Students each should be cautious.

---

**Four Extremes Regulations Grade:**  
If scriptures are not received, the master steals heavenly treasures; receiving without pledge breaks heavenly dao. If by cause and condition one obtains scriptures, but the world has no scripture master, one may follow regulations to receive secretly on a remote peak, hidden and pledged.

If there is a scripture master, then go to the master to pledge and receive. Obtaining scriptures without pledging, lightly and falsely cultivating, offending heavenly spirits, falsely speaking scripture titles, speaking to ordinary students, this test is very severe, held by the Four Extremes and Four Officers, seven ancestors and grandparents filling the night river’s endless service, body subjected to visible punishments, dying suffering ten hardships and eight difficulties, swallowing fire and embracing sword, to repay the false speaking of scriptures’ responsibility. Recipients must clearly heed regulations.
