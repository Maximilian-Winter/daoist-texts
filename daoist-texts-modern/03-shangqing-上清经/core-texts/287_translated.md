### Scripture of the Cavernous Truth, Supreme Clarity, and Great Subtlety: The Emperor’s Steps on the Heavenly Thread and Flight over Earth’s Chronicle in Golden Slips and Jade Characters

The black star is the soul and spirit of the Northern Dipper. When one desires to tread the thread, first one closes the qi, turning left beyond the seven stars, circling three times above the Dipper’s soul and spirit, then ascending to Yangming. If the child wishes to truly step the Dipper, the soul and spirit have a thread; they wind and follow the path, gaining ascent to the Jade Hall.

Step the Three Terraces, from the Jade Thread of Yu’s Steps, closing the qi, ascending to the Golden Thread, going back and forth nine times, knocking the teeth thrice, harmonizing the qi, then invoking the name of the terrace; whatever is wished will follow at will. To seek fields and lands, invoke the upper terrace; to seek rank and office, invoke the middle terrace; to seek gold and jade, invoke the lower terrace. Always use the six Jia days; this is a distinct method, no need for constant practice. The upper terrace is called Void Essence, the middle six Purities, the lower Curved Life—these are all names.

The Most High teaches the Way of the Flying Five Stars, seeking and stepping the Water and Fire Five Stars to descend, summoning the divine cloud chariot and feathered canopy, ascending the technique of the Great Void—this is the Way of Gu Xizi. Close the qi and ascend the thread, swallowing saliva fifteen times; each time reaching a star, the left hand bows to the heart and utters: “Flying Immortal, two words only.” Before ascending the thread, first preserve the essence of the Five Stars within the five viscera; each time the thread is stepped, press accordingly. Fourteen years, the dragon flies by day. The key lies upon the written slips—this is the thread chart.

The Later Sage Sovereign presented the Three Officials and Earth Gods’ books; wearing them, one steps the thread and flies as an immortal, ascending to the Emperor of Great Peace. The Most High Jade Emperor revealed the talisman of the Seven Stars, the vermilion inscriptions of the Eight Seasonal Days; wearing these, carrying one talisman upon the head, one applies them to those who step the thread as immortals.

The Most High’s secret writings are gathered on the left of the Jade Emperor’s talisman,

The Most High’s secret writings are gathered on the right of the Jade Maiden’s talisman.

The above talismans and vermilion scripts.

The Most High’s secret writings: The Great Subtle Emperor once bestowed upon the Cavernous True Lord of Supreme Clarity the Heavenly Thread, the Flight over Earth’s Chronicle; based on the Mysterious Dipper, climbing the Chief Star, connecting the Nine Truths, riding the flying dragon, roaming the Three Fates, floating the Three Lives, securing the Three Treasures, expelling the Six Harms, concealing the Six Yins, entering the Six Absolutes, guarding the Heavenly Heroes, preserving the extension of days, maintaining the primordial assistants, treading the Great Pivot, circulating the Elixir Chamber, ascending the Literary Flourish, turning through the Nine Paths, ranked as the Nine Elders, practicing for twenty years, receiving the scripture as a Supreme Clarity Perfected One.

The Most High Supreme Elemental Lord and the Eight Supreme Clarity Elder Lords below instruct the Twenty-Nine Perfected Ones of the Mysterious Continent to ascend the Lang Wind Terrace. The Later Sage Sovereign journeyed to the Golden Morning Splendor Palace of Supreme Clarity, entrusting it to the Palace’s Azure Youth Lord, commanding him to teach the immortal name and bone register; those with jade characters in the true register, when the dao is fulfilled, return the scripture to the Azure Youth’s chamber, then receive the scripture to ascend Great Subtlety. Ordinary people regard the Seven Stars as near, yet do not know how far the stepping is; Daoists, if they know the Heavenly Thread can be stepped but do not know the soul and spirit, do not pursue their body. It is not that the body will not bring the soul and spirit, but the soul and spirit fear the might of the Seven Stars and dare not follow the body upward. Thus, if the three souls are not gathered and the seven spirits scatter, one only steps the thread with an empty corpse, but the spirit does not follow; truly futile.

If you wish to step the thread, clear your heart and quiet your mind, do not think of sorrow or worry, do not recall honor or taste; then circle three times, ascend the star, open the invocation, so that the two divine souls pass the spiritual gate, suddenly loosening the body, swiftly forgetting the self’s fullness and purity. Then stepping is always like treading the void: one year avoids calamity, two years avoids war, three years avoids death, four years becomes an earthly immortal. A thousand harms and myriad evils dare not interfere. From then on, blessings and happiness arise without end, summoning divine emissaries and spiritual beings, harnessing flying dragons; the Great Ultimate bestows the spirit fungus, the Jade Emperor grants the youth. After twenty-seven years of practice, one becomes a Supreme Clarity Perfected One.

The method of stepping the thread: do not walk sideways across the thread. The straight lines connecting the stars’ boundaries are called the thread. To violate the Heavenly Thread horizontally is to sever the Heavenly Dao and is a great prohibition.

Do not tread the thread upon the Perfected One’s star; this is a great taboo. Violating either requires removing one’s cap, kowtowing, and apologizing to the thread’s image. The thread is made of cloth or silk, nine feet long and six feet wide, with star positions arranged upon the cloth; stars are drawn in blue ink, the thread in cinnabar ink. Store it in a clean box; whenever performing, burn incense and take it out. Seven Jade Maidens attend the scripture, and seven Jade Youths guard the stars. To step the worldly path, walking the common roads with ordinary people, where dust flies wildly and filth mingles, one may not step the thread. If one dwells among the mundane yet travels roads and rides carriages, and does not see flowing blood or corpses, one may step the thread. If one lives in mountains and forests, fasting long, severing ties with the human world, or dwelling in hidden caves, taking herbs and abstaining from grains, then the taboo of dusty roads does not apply. Avoid eating the six domestic meats and the five pungent vegetables; always bathe and wear clean clothes, burn incense at the place of stepping the thread, and always observe the Northern Dipper stars, bowing the head and placing the hands accordingly. Bathing is the beginning of stepping the thread; one need not bathe every time one steps, but hands, feet, mouth, and face must be most pure and full. On cloudy days, one may perform in a quiet room, even on the bed where one sleeps. Stepping the thread by day is especially superior to midnight; in all cases, avoid being seen by others while performing. Only avoid passing through filthy places; keep the heart refined.

The Great Subtle Emperor instructs the scripture of stepping the Heavenly Thread, carefully following the divine true highest method. First burn incense at the place of action, close the qi, turning left three times beyond the Dipper stars, beginning at Yin Essence, circling Yangming. When complete, harmonize the qi, then one may place the feet upon the Seven Stars, stepping only on Yangming. Then facing the morning star, again close the qi and invoke in the heart: “Yangming Great Chief, Mysterious Pole Literary Flourish, let so-and-so’s soul and spirit roam the Heavenly Thread.” After the invocation, the left foot steps on Yangming, then advance the right foot to step Yin Essence, invoking: “Yin Essence Northern Pivot, Most High Rotating Jade, let so-and-so’s soul and spirit follow the body.” Next, left foot steps on Mysterious Darkness, invoking: “Mysterious Darkness Shaking Light, Purple Tenuity Opening Yang, let so-and-so’s soul and spirit walk the Jade Balance.” Next, right foot steps on Cinnabar Origin, invoking: “Cinnabar Origin Purple Palace, Most High Spiritual Field, let so-and-so’s soul and spirit pass the Divine Ford.” Next, left foot steps on North Pole, invoking: “North Pole Heavenly Light, Returning to Mysterious Time, let so-and-so’s soul and spirit reach the Mysterious Pass.” Next, right foot steps on Heavenly Pass, advancing the left foot to join the right, then harmonize the breath. If one closes the breath before completing the thread, one may ascend again on the Cinnabar Origin star and close again. A subtle invocation:

“Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth, the Five Phases push each other; the Seven Stars shine brilliantly, the Heavenly Thread is most mighty; the Auxiliary Star guards the peak, the Assisting Star repels decline; the Nine Truths Most High, the Great Ultimate Great Subtlety; the Three Palaces Jade Emperor, the Three Honored Ones repel calamity; Heaven moves and Earth turns; soul and spirit accompany; let me fly as immortal; true light lingers; name enters the Golden Chamber; the Jade Gate opens; ride the dragon and ascend the void; sun and moon shine together; roam Supreme Clarity; ring the bell in emerald robes; left grasping flowing lightning, right commanding rushing thunder; myriad evils on earth subdued, death dares not pursue; evil hearts see me, let them be cut down and destroyed; by imperial command, Jade Maidens attend, guarding to return; soul, spirit, and god united, merge form and ascend flying.”

The reverse stepping method stops at Heavenly Pass, turning backward to North Pole, with a subtle invocation:

“Most High Primordial Spirit, Floral Canopy Purple Spirit, North Pole Jade Chamber, hiding the transformation essence; Great Subtle Mysterious Terrace, Nine Truths Jade City; may so-and-so fly as immortal, reach the Cloud Court, retrace the Heavenly Thread, soul and spirit both alive; ride the dragon in the Floral Palace, gain the name of the Way; left wearing jade pendant, right waist jingling gold bell, tiger girdle and dragon skirt, whistle commanding heavenly soldiers, riding the three pure lights of the scene, flying to Supreme Clarity.”

After the invocation, close the qi, raise the left foot to step North Pole, right foot to step Cinnabar Origin, next raise left foot to step before Mysterious Darkness, right foot joins left, facing the Perfected One’s star, harmonize breath, subtle invocation:

“Great Ultimate Nine Essences, Supreme Emperor High True, emerge ascending Primordial Clarity, enter hiding Mysterious Yin, nurture so-and-so long so-and-so, cause so-and-so to love immortality; Jade Terrace suddenly opens, Golden Hall’s eight gates; beg so-and-so to wear the scripture, crimson dragon and blue skirt, assisting Purple Tenuity; Later Sage Sovereign rides ten flying dragons, mysterious canopy and bright clouds, array names on the original chart, sun and moon shine together.”

After the invocation, again close the qi, left foot steps Assisting Star, advance right foot to step Yin Essence, advance left foot to step before Yangming, right foot joins left, harmonize breath, subtle invocation:

“Heavenly Chief True Yang, Dipper’s movement rising and falling, front turns the primordial mechanism, rear moves the spiritual thread, restrain spirit to calm, bind soul to health; soul and spirit with body, together walk the heavenly palace, facing the Golden Palace, Most High Supreme Emperor; right supports the Immortal Mother, left supports the Immortal Lord; purple and emerald flying blossoms, dragon robe and tiger apparel, wearing true kerchief jade, neck shining round light, hands hold divine bell, waist wears golden pendant, mouth chants Cavernous Truth, seven transformations wondrous chapter; first from emptiness born as king, flying through nine paths, based on the Dipper climbing the thread; front follows Great One, rear follows Mysterious Gentleman; reveal secret formula to so-and-so; sitting, standing, dying, reverse to the key point; ranked as immortal minister; five viscera self-generated, meet Heaven; all wishes fulfilled, all requests prosperous; myriad evils subdued, changing place and hiding; if Heaven punishes me, water extinguishes fire.”

Reverse stepping method again, close qi, right turns three times beyond Dipper stars, beginning at Yangming, circling Yangming, harmonize breath, invocation:

“Most High Supreme True, Seven Radiances Supreme, reverse stepping seeking life, ascend Heavenly Origin, let so-and-so fly as immortal, enter the Purple Gate.”

Then close qi, left foot steps Yangming, right foot steps Yin Essence, first right foot steps Mysterious Darkness, left foot steps Cinnabar Origin, next right foot steps North Pole, left foot steps Heavenly Pass, right foot joins left, harmonize breath, invocation:

“Seven transformations reverse rotation, ascend Jade Lodge, six chronicles assist me, three threads combined stepping; Jade Emperor looks left, Most High looks right, teach me to ride stars, soar ascending mysterious path; beg to grant flying immortality, the blessing of undying; floating through Supreme Clarity, riding the three pure lights of the scene, gold, blue, and emerald skirts; entering and exiting the nine mansions; Northern Emperor bows, Southern Truth bows; name inscribed on the Immortal Terrace; myriad transformations; gain friend the Sage Sovereign; Great Peace assists; wishes follow heart; all affairs succeed; those who harm me, knife punishment and fire tomb.”

When the three ways of forward stepping, reverse stepping, and contrary stepping are all complete, then raise both feet together upon the morning star, place right hand upon heart, left hand pointing to Mysterious Darkness star, close breath three breaths, knock teeth twenty-one times, swallow saliva twenty-seven times, called “Grasping the Dipper.” Subtle invocation:

“Yangming purple qi, Supreme Elemental Mysterious Time, Golden Palace Yellow Chamber, within dwells the Great God; left pats the Supreme Emperor, right holds the High True; dragon carries emerald robes, flying embroidered tiger patterns, waist bears jade talisman, head wears lotus crown; emerging from nothing entering void; golden truth jade light; spiritual honored towering; named Yangming; feet step vermilion smoke; mouth chants cavernous chapter; bestow so-and-so secret writing; see teachings of stepping the thread; circle three times; grasp the Dipper and forget self; let so-and-so fly as immortal; transcend emptiness, float in the void; name inscribed Supreme Clarity; ride mysterious dragon chariot; mind goes where it will; wishes all follow; Three Honored unite virtue; soul and spirit internal communication; grant to divine officials; Jade Maidens and Jade Youths; those who harm so-and-so, shape as lightning and wind; treacherous schemes sever tongue; exile to Ten Directions.” Invocation ends, heart stored within, suddenly forget self for a long while, then descend.

After completing the Way of Grasping the Dipper, raise both feet together upon Yin Essence star, left hand pats heart, right hand points to Perfected One star, close qi three breaths, knock teeth three times, swallow saliva three times, called “Climbing the Chief into Great Subtlety.” Subtle spell:

“Yin Essence Mysterious Element, Floral Canopy Birth Gate, within dwells the Jade Emperor, North Pole Supreme; phoenix embroidered floral collar, dragon emerald blue skirt, waist tiger bell pendant, supporting spirit fungus cinnabar crown; named Yin Essence, Most High Lord; bestow so-and-so secret writing; let so-and-so step the seven origins, climb the chief and ascend, roam the spiritual gate; outside restrain seven spirits, inside control three souls; spirit refines mundane burdens, soul treasures fetal spirit; soul and spirit guard body, together immortal; flying through Supreme Clarity; returning qi, infant face; wherever directed as heart; myriad desires no difficulty; those who harm so-and-so, shape dies by Three Officials; awe commands Six Heavens; command host of gods.”

After completing the Way of Climbing the Chief, raise both feet together upon Assisting Star, feet facing Perfected One star, four bows complete, kneel and close qi four breaths, knock teeth four times, swallow saliva four times, called “Connecting the True.” With correct heart, enter from the chief to ascend Assisting Star, do not cross the thread sideways. Kneeling, subtle invocation:

“Great Ultimate Nine Essences, Supreme Origin Bright True, correct mechanism holds balance, inhale and exhale purple smoke; golden light jade reflection, might shines over Ten Heavens; govern the Three Lights, harmonize yang and yin; principle origin bestows qi; change old for new; govern central mansion; mysterious pass of mystery; golden chamber jade door; northern side four directions; dispatch carriage eight scenes; floating roaming Great Origin; dragon brocade phoenix robes; tiger emerald flying skirts; crimson banner green veil; purple feathers seven edges; waist bears divine talisman; head wears supporting crown; rest in Nine Voids; descend to heavenly abyss; self-named Jade Emperor; Nine Heavens Supreme True; pity so-and-so loves the Way; bestow so-and-so secret chapter; personally ascend Assisting Chief; pay homage to spiritual lord; beg for elixir scripture; before life, gain governance of Three Heavens; fly through Eight Mysteries; five viscera self-generate; top grade flying immortal; gain wings from Jade Emperor; Later Sage’s minister; rank high grand master; ride clouds and flying wheels; all wishes fulfilled; myriad evils dare not interfere; those who harm so-and-so, violently break form and door.”

After completing the Way of Connecting the True, raise both feet together upon Mysterious Darkness star, right hand pats heart, left hand points to Cinnabar Origin star, close qi three breaths, knock teeth twenty-one times, swallow saliva three times, called “Northern Dipper.” Subtle invocation:

“Cavernous Heaven divine light, returning hiding Mysterious Darkness; qi fills Great Void, coming and going without form; hidden Heaven, concealed Earth; circulating nourishing without birth; suddenly ascend Heavenly Thread; step upon Purple Court; look north to Thunder Chamber; look south to Lightning City; dazzle with myriad changes; no longer former form; faint flowing light; poke hand and stand complete; seeking to hide body, gain my name; emptiness proud and lofty; nine transformations Mysterious Darkness; sit and rise six Jia; visit office of Six Ding; bestow so-and-so secret writing; step Dipper and walk stars; look up to Supreme Emperor; wear cinnabar kerchief blue; hold spiritual light; waist bears jade bell; ascend begging flying immortal; born with Heaven; name inscribed Great Subtlety; float through Supreme Clarity; descend begging transformation; conceal light record form; all affairs as wished; all crushed are pacified; those who harm so-and-so, slaughtered by divine soldiers.”

The Golden Root Upper Text of the Great Ultimate True Scripture says: “You ascend Mysterious Darkness, step the Dipper and conceal form; if you wish transformation, you must obtain my name; turning Heaven and moving Earth, myriad things come into being. When stepping Mysterious Darkness and wishing to conceal, keep this name in mind.”

After completing the Way of Stepping the Dipper, raise both feet together upon Cinnabar Origin star, left hand pats heart, right hand points to North Pole star, close qi three breaths, knock teeth three times, swallow saliva three times, called “Treading the Chronicle.” Subtle invocation:

“Most High Nine Terraces, Cinnabar Origin Mysterious Chronicle, outside governs Northern Pivot, inside correct Heavenly Principle; Golden Palace reflects outside, Jade Court shines within; within dwells the Supreme; named Red Child; governs in Cinnabar Origin, within the Crimson Chamber; emerald clouds embroidered floral; dragon robe tiger apparel; right holds imperial register, left grasps chief thread; feet step scenic clouds; head wears purple crown; right wears flowing bells; left carries jade chime; bestow so-and-so secret writing; tread the chronicle roaming; ascend begging flying immortal; ride mysterious dragon chariot; scripture named Cinnabar Terrace; Great Ultimate Jade Hall; wherever directed, blessings and fortune come to greet; those who harm so-and-so, may they be destroyed; grant attendant divine officials, Jade Maidens and Jade Youths.”

After completing the Way of Treading the Chronicle, raise both feet together upon North Pole star, right hand pats heart, left hand points to Heavenly Pass star, close qi three breaths, knock teeth three times, swallow saliva three times, called “Stepping the Thread.” Subtle invocation:

“Mysterious Supreme Great Subtlety, North Pole Purple Canopy, below dwells Most True; roaming the Nine Externals; emerald blossoms flying skirts; golden bells blue belts; waist bears jade light; mysterious clouds thick and dense; bestow so-and-so secret writing; ascend seven qi; mount clear playful smoke; Perfected Ones assemble; beg for flying immortal; scripture named Elixir Chamber; wherever directed, wishes fulfilled; no disaster no harm; those who harm so-and-so, let them be injured and ruined.”

After completing the Way of Stepping the Thread, raise both feet together upon Heavenly Pass star, right hand pats heart, left hand points to Heavenly Pass, close qi three breaths, knock teeth three times, swallow saliva three times, called “Riding the Dragon.” Subtle invocation:

When performing, always face north, holding the scripture while doing so. One may also follow the text to observe the stars, no need to recite secretly while acting.

The Later Sage Sovereign received the Most High’s secret scripture of stepping the thread, entrusting it to the Azure Youth Lord, who transmitted it to Lord Wang; Lord Wang secretly taught those with bone fate and jade register bearing immortal names. Those without immortal register or jade script, though seeing it, do not seek it; though having it, do not practice. Not for lack of desire to practice, but the spirit restrains them. According to the *Four Extremes Bright Methods*, the Most High secret scripture permits three transmissions within seven hundred years; beyond that, no further transmission. When first granting the scripture, the recipient is tested before passing it on. The test is not a single rule, but designed to provoke anger or doubt, to see if one can accept or reject. Thus, ancient Perfected Ones examined the heart to determine resolve, observed conduct to see deeds. When you receive transmission, heed their words carefully.

Master Huang received from the Yellow Accumulation Little Youth the method of stepping the Three Threads, practicing its essentials, swiftly flying through scenic clouds, journeying north to the Supreme Clarity Palace, entering and exiting the Gate of Life, breathing emptiness.

The Yellow Emperor received from Xiangcheng Little Youth the method of stepping the Six Chronicles, practicing its essentials, forging cauldrons on Mount Jing, hiding and transforming on Qiaoling, riding dragons in the Mysterious Garden, riding clouds in the Lang Wind.

Master Guangchengzi received from the Eastern Sea Zhongyuan Little Youth the method of stepping the Six Harms, practicing its essentials, riding the three pure clouds, arriving at the boundless wilderness, driving the splendid phoenix and eight dragons, entering the gate of infinity, reversing through the Great Void, ranked as Jade Emperor.

Gong Zhongyang received from Mount Song High Little Youth the method of stepping the Six Absolutes, practicing its essentials, gradually ascending the vermilion light cinnabar mound, riding the mysterious ascent, commanding ten flying cicadas, roaming the Southern Sea, crimson clouds as canopy, entering the Five Cities.

These Four Little Youths are all teachers of Celestial Truth. The secret scriptures they received and implemented all concern one matter. The Three Threads, Six Chronicles, Six Harms, Six Absolutes differ only in name. Spring steps the Seven Stars, called stepping the Three Threads. Summer steps the Seven Stars, called treading the Six Chronicles. Autumn steps the Seven Stars, called walking the Six Harms. Winter steps the Seven Stars, called ascending the Six Absolutes. Practiced secretly, floating and roaming Supreme Clarity.

Lord Wang said: “In my time of the Zhou, wandering between the Warring States, traveling through mighty Qin, emerging in the Great Han era, I trod the Earth’s source, roamed the Nine Palaces, met many immortals, asked the true officials, and first sought this dao. None who stepped the Heavenly Origin and walked the thread failed to obtain the Way; swift attainment and not difficult. Thus, wearing the robe stepping the thread, the seven essences descend and roam; gnawing the thread, ascend to Heaven; Wang Ni stepped the thread, riding clouds through Ten Heavens; Yellow Emperor stepped the thread, essence became Xuanyuan; Xu You stepped the thread, phoenixes flew in groups; Chao Fu stepped the thread, attended the Heavenly Sovereign; Zhi Li stepped the thread, roosted in Lang Wind; Hua Feng stepped the thread, body born of mysterious clouds; Zi Zhou stepped the thread, emerald dragon and tiger attire; Shan Juan stepped the thread, riding the leaping dragon candle; Shi Hu stepped the thread, flying to Yingzhou; Northern Man stepped the thread, Jade Maiden came to visit; Pu Yi stepped the thread, entered the Northern Dipper; An Gong stepped the thread, red dragon bore him; Huan Cheng stepped the thread, saw the Literary Beginning, befriended the West Return, half carriage of youths; Two Women stepped the thread, both washed in White Water, then saw the Golden Mother, dwelling on Eastern Terrace; Bian Sui stepped the thread, rode dragon to Taiqing; Wu Guang stepped the thread, body transcended Purple Court; Ma Huang stepped the thread, dragon and clouds arrived together; Peng Zu stepped the thread, reached the drifting sands; Lao Dan stepped the thread, called the Sage Master, received teachings from the gatekeeper, all gathered at Cloud Terrace; Jiao Jian stepped the thread, rode dragon racing stars, casting fishing rods and abandoning lines, forever a Supreme Truth; Da Xiang stepped the thread, appearance reverted to infant; Qin Shi stepped the thread, divine dragon spat talisman; Juan Zi stepped the thread, river produced spiritual fish, took in jade liquid, then ascended Mysterious Continent; Xiao Shi stepped the thread, hidden in Qin Tower, playing jade and receiving teachings, all reached Qingqiu; Jie Yu stepped the thread, husband and wife both immortals, gained governance of Emei, sealed as mountain and river lord; Bo Hun stepped the thread, ranked as water spirit; Geng Sang stepped the thread, roaming Eight Netherworlds. All require this technique; the dao is essential to completion. Thus roughly recording these persons to tell you. Some first diligently then rest, repeatedly tested but not passing, also become earthly immortals, and obtain the body’s release; some become underground lords, numbering several thousands or hundreds. Unable to recall their names one by one.”

Those who have released the body and become underground lords, according to the *Four Extremes True Methods*, after one hundred and forty years may be appointed as immortal officials; after another one thousand three hundred years, may be appointed as true officials; then they may ride flying floral canopies, command groups of dragons, ascend the Great Ultimate, and roam the Nine Palaces. Carefully following the law and practicing, none fail to become immortals; with focused heart and diligent sincerity, only fourteen years are needed. Then the essence of the Seven Stars descends and transforms into divine beings, riding flowing bells and eight scenes, cinnabar and mysterious clouds, all come to you, bowing as immortal officials, bestowing true talismans; the dao fulfilled, all ascend Supreme Clarity, rising to Great Subtlety Palace. Strive and be diligent, wherever you go you will be responded to. Why be lazy and become a corpse releasing the body, underground lord of the Great Yin? Only after one hundred and forty years will you gain the rank. I too once by diligent effort attained this.

The day for stepping the thread is the seventh day of the first month. The first, fifth, ninth, fifteenth, twentieth, twenty-fifth, and twenty-ninth days of the month. If stepping at night, use midnight; if by day, use noon; if in a place with no people, noon is best; do not let common people see. If seen by common people, the heavenly essence will not descend. When the Dipper is upright, the moon is in Yin, at dusk Heavenly Pass faces Yin, at dawn faces Shen, at noon faces Hai; calculate according to the moon and Dipper positions, always knowing the place, following the chart accordingly. If encountering evil ghosts or wicked people, hold only the Dipper star to point, close qi, and invoke:

“I am Heaven’s Eye, pursuing Heaven; eyes like thunder and lightning, shining bright over eight domains; penetrating inside and out; nothing does not obey. Thus, evil and wicked ghosts and disasters dare not offend me.”

On the Jiazi day and the Eight Seasonal Days, all stepping the thread gain immortality and cause the Seven Stars to visit you. Those who step the thread must not sleep on the winter Jiazi day evening; the light of the Seven Stars will cover the eye essence.

The method of stepping the thread to shed the death name with the upper jade register uses the third day of the first month, eleventh day of the second month, nineteenth day of the third month, eighth day of the fourth month, fifth day of the fifth month, ninth day of the sixth month, seventh day of the seventh month, fourth day of the eighth month, ninth day of the ninth month, fifth day of the tenth month, eighth day of the eleventh month, twelfth day of the twelfth month. Using these days to step the thread, the Azure Youth Lord and the Immortal Terrace erase the death records and add life characters. The seventh day of the first month stepping the thread follows the usual method; if death is sudden or calamity or illness, one may step immediately without waiting for an auspicious day. The words and invocations are as intended; first finish the old text invocation, then speak the wishes; all take effect immediately, swiftly through water and fire. Women stepping the thread use vermilion as the thread image; men use cloth or silk as the thread image.

The Most High secret scripture in golden slips and jade characters: stepping the Heavenly Thread, flying Earth’s Chronicle, ascending Supreme Clarity, entering the essentials of Purple Tenuity. The Most High often sends seven Western Spirit Divine Youths, faces adorned with jade splendor, attending the Seven Stars’ image on the left and right of the chart; when stepping the thread, the divine youths all follow and ascend the stars. Beginners have not seen them; after one year, often dream of these seven youths at their side; within three years, their forms appear before people. All fly with crossed topknots, wearing dark yellow and blue robes, holding fragrant sandalwood ointment, incense, and vermilion lamps. The Most High often sends the Southern Truth Spirit Consort and Purple Spirit Proud Maidens, faces adorned with golden and jade dragon splendor, attending this secret scripture on its left and right; when stepping the thread, the divine maidens all follow and ascend the stars. Beginners have not yet seen them; after one year, often dream of these seven maidens at their side; within three years, their forms appear before people. All fly with side knots, wearing cinnabar and emerald robes, holding clothing spring mysterious ointment, sun incense lamps. After seven days of fasting and purification, this scripture is transmitted; recipients likewise.

The *Most High Four Extremes Bright Methods* says: within one hundred years, one transmission is permitted; within seven hundred years, limited to three transmissions; beyond this number, no further reception. Transmission always involves fasting and crossing, making vows and oaths, ensuring no leakage; testing the heart’s depth, probing sincerity, examining inner truth, weighing good and evil, then only releasing it. If not bone fate, one should not receive this scripture. If a corpse or skin lover receives it, they will be tested but not enlightened, generating grudges and hatred, suffering injury or death, disharmony with life; all such are not children of the dao and must receive evil to stop, do not speak of the reason. The Seven Lords of Heavenly Spirit, great gods of dao and virtue, observe honor and disgrace, repay with blessings; do not worry. This is the true extreme meaning, the Later Sage’s method; enough to measure what can be done, enough to know what cannot be done. If you understand the observation and test, you must first thank the Seven Stars’ gods, then you may repair and recover losses.

The Eight Nourishing Formulas say: “It is not difficult to seek immortality, but difficult to find the right person; it is not difficult to learn the dao, but difficult to receive its scripture; it is not difficult to receive the scripture, but difficult to pass the test and not know; it is not difficult to be tested by the scripture, but difficult to practice the scripture with focused sincerity.” The Most High’s secret words are wondrous and trustworthy.

### Self-Introduction of Lord Wang in the Most High Purple Scripture

The Azure Essentials Purple Scripture says: “If you wish to ascend Heaven, you must walk the Seven Spirits; having ascended the North Pole, then enter the Purple Court; not for humans to transmit; first test their nature.” This is the true discourse on stepping the thread. I once received the Divine Scripture; some tested me, striking my hand with sticks and clubs until blood flowed; yet I still inclined my heart toward them, thoughts did not stray; this was the test’s excess. Then I obtained this scripture, was told: “You have already trod water and fire, and escaped.” At first I did not understand these words; later I realized striking the hand was the test. I once taught a person the Divine Scripture; before granting the method, without cause, fire was raised to burn his clothes; the clothes were consumed but he did not speak, though his expression was not greatly fearful. Though wicked qi does not appear outside, and evil words do not come from the mouth, this was passing the test. Later I also taught the secret scripture of stepping the thread. When practicing and attaining the Way, ascending the Great Ultimate, I saw beforehand carved Great Ultimate Northern Jade characters: “Mao Ying of Xianyang received the stepping thread scripture, following the hidden test method; fire burned clothes and form; mouth though silent, expression still uneasy; this is a lower pass, not true essence; may practice Great Ultimate, but not ascend Supreme Clarity.” Ying saw the jade characters, read them with melancholy, realizing since the test of receiving the scripture, he had not understood the burden of uneven colored qi; now at ninety-eight years, he knows the mysterious jade thread records all details. Then he again overcame and returned, swearing to the Supreme True, finally gaining appointment as minister to the Emperor. You should encourage this. Lord Wang says this to the young Lord Wang.

Facing the four extremes, calling the souls and essences of the four stars, invoking the hidden names of the four origins, to attain the roaming Supreme Clarity robes. The Outer Scripture says: “Wings fully formed” does not mean the body grows feathers and wings, but ascending the Heavenly Thread, resting on the chief star preserving truth, paying homage to the five essence souls, invoking the four origins’ names to summon spiritual offerings, thus the feathered robes descend mysteriously; truly by focused sincerity.

The Most High secret scripture says: on every Jiazi day and the Eight Seasonal Days, after completing the way of stepping the thread, face the chief star in the center of the thread, then face the Perfected One star, preserving the star image in the spleen, bow twice, kneel and invoke:

The Great Ultimate hidden spirit fungus has four kinds, or four directional colors, shining within a hundred paces like the moon. One kind is blue, like stacked bright mirrors, face diameter five or six cun, shining penetrating, three layers stacked, height six or seven cun, named Great Ultimate Spirit Mirror Hidden Heavenly Blue Spirit Fungus.

Obtaining and consuming them, Great Subtlety sends emissaries, appointing you as Immortal Lord, dividing forms and myriad transformations, body born of jade light.

The Most High secret scripture of stepping the Heavenly Thread, flying Earth’s Chronicle in jade characters, all requested by the Later Sage Sovereign, entrusted to the Azure Youth Lord, who teaches those with bone fate and immortal names in the jade register. Those without immortal register or jade script, children of the dao who attain the Way, will never meet or encounter each other, seeing this jade scripture. The Four Extremes Perfected Ones’ methods allow three transmissions within seven hundred years; transmissions are all sworn; scriptures sealed and not revealed, to honor the supreme spirit. This scripture is absolutely forbidden to mix with others. Those who receive the secret of stepping the seven origins and walking the stars use a silk cloth thirty-two feet long, to match the numbers one, five, and seven. Those who receive the secret of walking the five stars use a silk cloth of twenty-four feet, to match numbers two, four, and six. This is also the mysterious image of curves and straight degrees; thus the oath must be kept. The dragon fish is a thing unknown in the world; also one must not close the scripture awaiting rare illness. The silk cloth is ten feet long, showing the standard for this oath, showing the beginning and end, clarifying sincerity. Also to be presented to scripture masters, who must then disseminate it, not hoard it for private gain; violating the oath incurs the Three Officials’ punishment, no small matter. Perfected Ones value the blue trust gold; whenever making vows and oaths, they cite this as the clear standard. Violating the scripture’s secrecy is a crime, punishing ancestors and descendants, receiving hell’s penalty. The oath object is always kept highest; do not reveal to others. The Heavenly Pass’s three charts say: “Govern root with essence, open heart with standard, unify origin with sincerity; wherever directed, life arises; Perfected Ones value oaths, precious gold and blue; harmonize and bless; point as oath; this oath is great; do not violate or take lightly.”

All transmissions have limits; those who do not transmit but falsely speak of scripture titles all violate secrecy; Jade Youths and Jade Maidens report to the Most High; three violations of secrecy cause death name to reappear, no longer able to become immortal. Transmissions all follow the oath, and must return gold and blue to the master to encourage merit.

There is the Most High Jade Scripture secret writing, all stored in separate cases. When practicing and observing, always burn incense, with Jade Youths and Jade Maidens attending on both sides; do not say you have not seen them and so they do not exist. True spirits follow the Great Void’s mirror, to examine the subtle heart; can one not be cautious?

In the world, there again exists the method of stepping the thread and treading the chronicle. During the first year of Yangshuo, Han Cheng Emperor’s Grand Marshal Wang Feng heard that Daoist Liu Jing learned the Heavenly Thread method from Zhang Jun of Handan. Feng then pressured him with power and rank; Jing could not resist, secretly wrote this brief note and gave it to him. Feng said it was the essential method for longevity and seeking wealth and rank, practiced very secretly, transmitting it to the ancestral gate; thus many invocations speak of wealth and rank, using the days of Tian Cang and Tian Fu’s conjunction and separation. This brief note originated with Liu Jing. At the end of Han, it was also shown to Huangfu Long, who likewise practiced it. Floating rumors—how could they move Heaven and Earth or move divine truth? Feng’s disciple Wang Se, during the Mang era, was enfeoffed as marquis, saying the stepping thread scripture was recast in gold slips, carved and written, telling Mang: “Heavenly omen.” How could this not greatly benefit stepping the thread? Yet without seeing the true original text and formula, it already brings boundless benefit, let alone gaining its root. The brief note’s method is widespread in the world, beginning with Liu Jing, leaking to this day. As for the Most High Jade Scripture Flying Chronicle Great Formula, Jing treasures it secretly; none know where it was granted.
