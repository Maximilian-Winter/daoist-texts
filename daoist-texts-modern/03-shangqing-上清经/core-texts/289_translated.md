Heaven clear and bright, qi pure and serene,  
Three Luminaries shining through the cavern,  
Golden chambers and jade halls,  
Five precious Ganoderma born anew,

### Opening the Scripture’s Profound Secret Incantation

Pierce through the subtle, mysterious gate of radiance,  
Brilliantly clear, penetrating the void alike.  
The Ultimate Dao arises from stillness and silence,  
Where one beholds the Three Pure Palaces.  
Here the Great Dao is fulfilled,  
Harnessing the sun’s chariot and cloud dragon steeds.  
True attendants flank the scripture,  
Jade Maiden and Jade Boy,  
Their bodies crossing the ferry of immortality,  
Unbinding nets, following the spiritual wind.  
Seven Ancestors return to the fetal state,  
Worldly beings become the clan of divine immortals.

Tapping teeth, eyes closed, bowing heart, the blessing is spoken:

I, a humble and insignificant male servant named [name], now utter subtle words,  
Opening above to the Jade Pure Qiongyuan Lord,  
The Most Sacred Myriad True Most High Dao Lord,  
The Central Yellow Old Elemental Dao Lord,

Golden Pavilion Official Supreme Clarity Immortal Marquis—

May the morning radiance blaze forth,  
Illuminating my body’s organs and glory,  
Dispersing calamities and disasters,  
Seven Ancestors return to the fetal state,  
Together riding the cloud carriage.

Closing eyes, preserving the Emperor One Supreme Lord, like an infant, four inches tall, residing beneath the nose, within the philtrum’s skin,  
Master of gathering a hundred spirits, seated amidst five-colored clouds.  
Preserving the Emperor One Supreme Lord in the empty mystery,  
His mouth directly facing mine, listening to the recitation of the Jade Scripture.

### Chapter One: The Way of the Supreme Void Sovereign Lord

Supreme and lofty cavern mystery,  
Primordial birth in the Nine Heavens.

Knitting and scattering bring great liberation. Emperor One’s supreme radiance is the true one non-dual dharma gate, the highest and most excellent wondrous way. Linking the multitudes and gathering smoke means connecting all qi and gathering spirit smoke, taking the lungs as the five viscera’s canopy. Bright Beam ancestral qi is tied to the nose.

## Great Cavern Jade Scripture Volume Two

The Great Cavern Jade Scripture has long been transmitted in the Han altar. In youth I often opened and recited it, yet did not understand the scripture’s meaning. Predecessors said: mostly names of the hundred spirits within the body, cannot be reasoned by literary logic. Later, obtaining Maoshan sect altar and Zitong Wenchang scripture editions, comparing methods each has differences, sometimes due to transmission errors, sometimes phonetic mistakes, largely similar with gains and losses. Yet the holy scripture dare not lightly alter. In the year of Yisi, chrysanthemum month, I, Guozi Lijiao Yuzhang Taigu Xiong Linchu, resigned official to study Dao, thoroughly comprehended the Great Cavern scripture’s meaning, brought by Magu from Xijiang mountain, carrying the copied Great Cavern scripture edition. It contains the ancient Tai Xuan Zhao Zhenren’s annotations, many are names of the hundred spirits within the body, their domains and palaces, mountains, forests, pavilions, pools, each clearly explained. The Great Cavern divides life gates and death gates, guarding female embracing male as main, mixing hundred spirits, always each dwelling its place, managing its affairs. Master Lan Xue Zhou of Tongshan, though nearly eighty, with keen ears and eyes, strong penmanship, copied two editions, showing me, once recited clearly, can be called a wondrous encounter in late years. Alas, this humble old man cannot cultivate, yet cannot bear to discard, so tentatively copied one copy, to keep for daily contemplation, and to transmit to later students. After copying, returning to the wall, still hoping master will specialize in reciting, cultivating daily renewal, returning old to youth, not disappointing this encounter. Offering this ode:

The Great Cavern Jade Scripture,  
Essence of the Ultimate Dao,  
True thought Emperor One,  
Guarding female embracing male,  
Three sections eight radiances,  
Mixing returning wind,  
Auspicious smoke celebrating clouds,  
Gate sealed door open,  
Taiyi life spirit,  
Destroying demons pushing misfortune,  
Holding talisman grasping register,  
Knots all empty,  
Three gates unobstructed,  
Nine qi rushing,  
World unfolds jade orchid,  
Heaven root lush abundant,  
Proving single straight Dao,  
Ranked ascending immortal elder,  
Long preserving radiance transformation,  
Dispersing shaking jade palace,  
Another day Peng Lang,  
One smile meeting.

Eighty-nine elder Qiushui Gong Detong bows and writes.
