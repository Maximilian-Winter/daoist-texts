## Scripture of the Eight Primal Truths of the Cavern of Reality, Supreme and Most High: The Secret Formula for Consuming the Imperial Radiance of Sun and Moon

The Emperor of Fusang, in order to transmit the dao of the Supreme Ultimate and the Four Perfected Ones, consulted with the Queen Mother of the Western Tortoise. The Queen Mother told the Emperor:

“The years of the Supreme Sovereign, through diligent study, have revealed the treasured writings, enabling one’s rank to ascend to the Jade Clarity. This is all due to the secret cultivation of the precious dao, the hidden numinous power, neither spoken of by mouth nor shown to others, quietly sensed in profound stillness, leading to the Supreme Perfected One. Thus, the dao esteems concealment and silence, transforming without form, emerging beyond sound.

Since I received the true scripture in the Nine Emptinesses, countless kalpas have passed, yet it has not been transmitted to three persons. At the end of the first year of the Middle Sovereign, it was inscribed in the Northern Primordial Heaven in the land of Naluona, on the mountain of the Spirit Mirror’s bird, in the cavern of Jialei, within the Spirit Palace. There, the energy of the Nine Profound and Perfect Unity was condensed and formed into characters.

Later, the Holy Nine Profound Golden Gate Emperor came to see the numinous script and commanded the Immortal Capital to wield the brush and pledge to Heaven. Those who cultivate the dao and succeed ascend to the Golden Gate. The Most High, because I carelessly leaked the heavenly treasure, stripped me of the title of True Origin, demoted me to a wandering spirit official, and only after five hundred years was I restored to my original truth.

The Primordial Beginning established the palaces of the Four Officers and Five Emperors, commanding the divine troops precisely to check leaks and punish with the wind blade. How can one not be cautious? Later disciples, like forests, none attained immortality. Why so? All because they carelessly leaked the dao’s writings, scattering the heavenly truth. The dao does not descend; Heaven’s punishment subtly manifests. Advancing and retreating, they lose resolve, dying alone in empty mountains, laboring in vain, bitterly lamenting without words.

The dao is not hidden because of diligence, nor unpracticed because of secrecy. Upon seeing the true scripture, one must secretly cultivate and seek the numinous. The divine and true are easily responsive; counting days, one becomes immortal. Like the Four Extremities Perfected Ones, who possess the complete scripture and myriad precepts, the precious dao’s secret truth, firmly holding the numinous chart, with spirit and will towering, their names recorded in the Jade Clarity, their characters in the Imperial Tablets, their rank ascending to the Four Extremities—what doubt remains?

Thus, the Supreme Emperor transmitted the *Eight Primal Truths Scripture* according to the pledge. The Western City Lord now seals a copy within the mountain of Emei, inside a curved chamber.

The *Eight Primal Truths Scripture*’s mysterious text was born within the Great Emptiness, seen upon the Western Tortoise Mountain, above the Mysterious Garden, in the shadow of piled stones, enclosed within golden halls and jade chambers. The eight primal truths are lofty, mysterious, feathered banners; the numinous text is rich and profound, the purple characters shining in the jade forest. Divine light flows and glows within the Nine Origins; golden sounds ring clearly in the Purple Heaven; cinnabar clouds spread shade over the jade chambers; soaring to the heavens, dense and vigorous in true essence; purple phoenixes flap their wings; spiritual winds raise smoke; fragrant essences stir the qi; subtle and penetrating into the profound.

On the left moves the natural Golden Boy; on the right commands the Supreme Immortal of the Great Void; divine consorts attend and guard; Taihua holds the silk kerchief; jade youths assist in rank; the Four Officers preside at the pavilion; the Two Luminaries pause their radiance; the Three Dawns return the essence; flying immortals race each other; streaming brilliance fills the cloud camps; splendid light intermingles and shines; the Three Candles unite in brightness; majestic power shines resplendently; qi spreads through the Purple Court; all true beings feast and observe rites, praising the Jade Clarity. This is the supreme numinous text, its virtue lofty and exalted.

Then the Most High Jade Morning Supreme Dao Lord, purified and fasting in the Upper Palace, pledged to Heaven with purple-gold, receiving it from the Nine Profound. Gathering yellow blossoms at the Eastern Well, plucking the sun’s root at the Golden Gate, turning the Two Luminaries with mysterious infusion, receiving flying essence to illuminate the face, drawing the Great Void as the appointed time, sharing the same year with the Three Lights, naming the Most High in the highest heaven, compiling the purple register in the Jade Morning, commanding myriad offices in the Imperial Chart, governing the Jade Emperor among the upper immortals, consuming the Eight Primal Truths with the sun and moon, chanting the jade chapters to transform the spirit, timing the numinous truth to delight oneself. After myriad kalpas, it has not been transmitted.

This dao walks the empty sky, stepping the void, transcending the marvelous methods of the Supreme Perfected Ones. It should be transmitted only to those with records of bones, those who are truly perfected. Among millions of cultivators, not one has seen its chapters. The Golden Gate of Heaven, the various Azure Palaces, and the Earthly Palace all carved the tablets in reverse before birth; one must receive the true scripture. Those who obtain it supplement the Supreme Perfected Ones and become teachers of myriad immortals.

The Primordial Beginning transmitted the scripture to the Most High Jade Emperor, the Nine Heavens Emperors, and the Nine Heavens Elders, within the empty mystery, displaying it on the Western Tortoise Mountain, mysteriously granting it to the Western Queen Mother. The Supreme Dao Lord received it from the Nine Profound to transmit to the Fusang Supreme Emperor. The Golden Gate Emperor received it from the Northern Primordial to transmit to the Prime Minister Azure Boy; the Supreme Emperor transmitted it to the Four Extremities Perfected Ones. The ancient mysterious dao passes qi to qi, truth to truth. The Prime Minister compiled and collected it into numinous writings, secreted in the palace of Great Possession above the Nine Heavens, guarded by seven hundred jade boys and jade girls. According to the cycle, seven hundred years, a perfected one listens to the transmission. The Four Officers and Five Emperors’ divine troops, seven hundred in number, correct and punish leaks. Whoever obtains this scripture and transmits it recklessly without following the cycle, the Seven Ancestors charge responsibility; upon death, they descend to the Nine Springs.

The sun’s essence is red, round in shape with square radiance; its qi waxes and wanes, its motion subtly declines. It always passes through the third, ninth, seventeenth, twenty-first, and twenty-fifth days of the moon—five times a month—above the Golden Gate, refining with golden essence, stone radiance, water mother, and spirit herb, forging the sun’s soul shining with eight rays. On these days, the sun’s radiance scatters, flying roots pour down, golden essence overflows, moistening all under Heaven.

Those who seek immortality must on these days gather the sun’s root, spirit descending through the jade gate, essence filling the hidden passes, the body generating wondrous light, sharing the sun’s year. Secretly walk its dao, ascend to the Golden Gate. The Golden Gate lies within the Western Heavenly Pass, the gate where sun and moon communicate. The emperor’s name is Red Cinnabar Golden Essence Stone Radiance Water Mother, the scripture of the jade embryo.

The moon’s light is yellow; its qi is square and precise, round in image, cycling and waxing, revolving and tilting. It always passes through the fifth, fifteenth, and twenty-fifth days of the moon, above the Eastern Well, bathing in numinous brilliance, brightening the essence rays, the fresh imperial radiance. On these days, the yang essence scatters, yellow qi entwines within, imperial radiance overflows, all under Heaven accepts the truth.

Those who seek immortality must on these days gather the yellow radiance at the Eastern Well, consume the yang essence in the sun’s soul, moistening the nine orifices within, the spirit calming the five palaces. Cultivate its dao, ascend to the moon’s court. The moon’s soul lies within the Eastern Well, the gate where sun and moon shine together. The emperor’s name is Yellow Qi Yang Essence Hidden Heaven Moon, the scripture of the jade fetus.

Those who wish to gather the sun’s radiance and flying roots must, before the appointed day, purify and fast, burn incense, take nine dou of well water, expose it in the courtyard, write the Stone Radiance Nine-Refined Water Mother Jade Talisman on blue paper, place it in the water, face west, knock teeth twelve times, and softly recite:

“Yang brightness refines essence, light shines in the Purple Court, eight rays brightly reflect, spirit herb overflows and fills, five turns and three revolutions, qi connects the Great Numinous, fragrant flow curves and pours, shading and moistening all beings, crowned and girded at the Golden Gate, radiant root fresh and bright, consuming the Stone Radiance, Water Mother irrigates essence, following Heaven’s motion, accompanying the sun’s radiance, nine orifices receive truth, releasing the original form.”

Then leave the water exposed in the courtyard overnight. At noon the next day, take one sheng of the dew water and consume it facing the sun, knock teeth twenty-four times, and raise the head to the sun, reciting:

“Yang essence now connected, flying radiance renewed, imperial spirit herb overflows, shading entwined within, I look up to consume mysterious moisture, fragrant radiance arrives, the palace opens wide, washing away worldly dust, the body reflects jade light, the face emits golden truth, clouds fly with feathered steps, ascending to the sun’s gate.”

Then raise the head and draw in the sun’s essence with forty-five swallows. Use the remaining water to bathe the whole body, then return indoors, face west, knock teeth twenty-four times, close eyes and envision the five-colored flowing clouds at midday sun above the left eye, yellow qi above the right eye, flickering and shining, illuminating the head and face. Softly recite:

“The sun’s soul flows light, five colors pour down, refining the soul at the Golden Gate, round radiance lofty, numinous brilliance emits rays, receiving the bright Heavenly River, jade spirit herb overflows, orchid moistens fragrant sighs, drink my imperial spring, nourish my flying radiance, gather roots and swallow substance, longevity equal to the numinous tree, form attached to the great radiance, body soars in flying clouds, a thousand years and myriad kalpas, never faltering or erring.”

Then bow to the sun’s gate nine times. This is the method to gather the sun’s root and flying radiance, the sun’s essence, the ancient mysterious dao. Cultivate it for one year and the face gains jade luster, the body produces golden light. After seven years, the spirit descends; flying through the sun’s gate, the sun’s child and spirit converse. Without the Golden Name Imperial Chart, the green characters of the Azure Palace, none may see its chapters. Careless leakage of the numinous text brings the Seven Ancestors’ charge; the body perishes, three disciples suffer five hardships, countless kalpas without reprieve.

The Stone Radiance Nine-Refined Water Mother Jade Talisman is written in vermilion on blue paper, placed in water. On the day of practice, write it all in vermilion on blue paper, face west, and consume one piece. When practicing this dao, be cautious to avoid filth; do not eat the five pungent meats, keep the five viscera fragrant and pure, and surely receive the true numinous. If the sky is overcast with no sun, practice indoors.

Those who seek to gather the moon’s imperial radiance must on the moon’s arrival at the Eastern Well, at dawn, take one jar of well water, expose it in the courtyard, at midnight write the Yang Essence Jade Fetus Refined Immortal Talisman on the water, place it in the water, face east, knock teeth twenty-four times, and facing the water recite:

“Yellow qi yin radiance, yang essence pure and fresh, bathing the nine souls, crowned and girded at the Golden Morning, round brightness opens the announcement, jade fetus refines immortality, radiant light intermingles and shines, fragrant flow washes the ford, nine yangs transform together, mysterious clouds scatter smoke, primal radiance returns spirit, curving reflects my body, flying ascends to the Upper Palace, profound viewing of the jade pavilion.”

Then take one sheng of the water, consume it facing the moon, firmly grasp and retain the five-colored flowing essence of the moon, all crowning and encircling the body. Within the five colors is a yellow qi moonlight as large as the pupil, layered dozens of times. Within the moon’s five-colored essence, it enters through the mouth, circles the five viscera, then facing the moon swallow essence fifty times, swallow saliva ten times, knock teeth ten times, and softly recite:

“Yellow qi flows essence, three combine to condense light, mysterious brilliance returns upright, crowned and girded with eight rays, refining the soul at the Eastern Well, receiving the bright flying emperor, golden radiance scatters spirit, five lords flow fragrance, the lady descends sweet dew, moistening and sprinkling the Ten Directions, vast spirit herb descends, filling the six bowels, golden essence nine transformations, easy radiance returns form, riding the void dropping smoke, wandering feasting the Great Emptiness, ascending to the moon’s court, paired with truth, transforming the eight paths, exiting without entering, two dawns shine together, eternal preservation without end.”

Then use the remaining water to bathe, return indoors, face east, consume the Yang Essence Jade Fetus Refined Immortal Talisman, knock teeth twelve times, and softly recite:

“Heaven conceals and embraces light, yellow qi richly disperses, condensing essence and brilliance, eight rays brightly shine, clear and adorn yellow radiance, stone radiance washes and irrigates, jade spirit herb overflows, moistening and filling the firmament, all under Heaven receives refinement, opening bright dawn, riding radiance ascending the void, attaining the imperial residence, long departing the lower world, transcending the eight calamities, shining with the moon, sharing the year.”

Swallow qi fifty times and stop. This is the method to consume the moon’s radiance, the Primordial Beginning’s marvelous method. Cultivate it for one year and the face grows jade luster. After seven years, the spirit descends; the body emits golden light. After nine years, flying ascends to the moon’s homeland, the moon’s child, lady, and five lords accompany one’s travels. Without the Golden Name Imperial Chart, the recorded characters of the Jade Clarity, none may consult or hear it. Those who practice this method may attain the upper immortals. Careless leakage of the numinous text brings the Seven Ancestors’ charge; the body perishes in the ghost official’s domain, long confined in hell, countless kalpas without reprieve.

The Yang Essence Jade Fetus Refined Immortal Talisman is written in yellow on white paper, placed in water. On the day of practice, write all in yellow, face east, and consume one piece. If the sky is overcast with no moon, practice indoors. Missing one day of practice loses the merit of the previous one hundred days.

All advanced practitioners who consume the sun and moon’s imperial radiance, at evening rest should knock teeth thirty-six times, firmly grasp, close eyes, and envision the purple light at the left eye and the yellow qi at the right eye, flickering and shining, illuminating the head and face. Softly recite:

“The Two Luminaries flow essence, light reflects my form, flying radiance imperial spirit herb, sweet fragrance fills and overflows, crowned and girded with the Golden Pill, spreading the Yellow Court below, the Three Lights blend, the Two Qi unite, long preserve the Vermilion Palace, reverse aging and renew life, years equal the sun and moon, myriad kalpas equal in lifespan.”

If one can persist for one year, then the sun’s life officer and the moon’s five stars, with the radiance of true spirit and flying emperor’s splendor, descend and receive the destined body, the face shining with golden countenance, the head emitting purple light. For nine years without loss, one flies through the Great Emptiness. This is the supreme dao; do not transmit it to the unworthy.

Those who cultivate the supreme dao and consume the sun and moon’s imperial radiance, on the day of their birth year and the eight seasonal festivals, write the sun and moon’s Two Luminaries Flying Essence Eight Primal Jade Talismans on bamboo slips, placing them on the front according to the festival, and consume them at dawn. This talisman comes from within the Nine Emptinesses, revealed on the Western Tortoise Mountain, above the Mysterious Garden, in the shadow of piled stones. The Queen Mother received it from the Nine Profound to guide the flying radiance of the Two Luminaries.

Thus the Three Primal Lords of the Great Essence, the Supreme Lord of the Southern Pole, and the Perfected One of the Great Void all cultivate this dao, attaining the rank of Supreme Primordial Emperor, with purple talismans and jade void, numinous spirit and great truth. This method is most marvelous, not transmitted to the lower world. Those who obtain the method fly through the mysterious void, ascend to the sun’s gate, roam the moon’s court, live as long as the Two Luminaries, and endure with qi. Careless leakage of the numinous text brings the Seven Ancestors’ charge; the body perishes in the ghost official’s domain. The bamboo slips are empty and profound, connecting to the Eight Primal Mysterious Radiance’s qi. The light of the sun and moon’s Two Luminaries flows and reflects on the bamboo slips, so the flying essence shines clearly upon them.

Performing the female one jade inspection of the Mysterious Mother’s Eight Gates, the twelve upper vows, and the ritual’s qi to summon spirits and seek immortality—without this talisman, the spirit will not descend, qi will not come, the dao will recede, and immortality cannot be attained.

The Eight Primal Flying Essence Two Luminaries Jade Script was born within the empty cavern, revealed atop the Tortoise Mountain, above the Mysterious Garden, in the shadow of piled stones. The origin of myriad qi, commanding all heavens’ sun and moon’s hidden writings, secreted above the Nine Heavens, transmitted once in myriad kalpas. Those who obtain the numinous text share the sun and moon’s year, transform and extend radiance, exiting without entering, nape emitting purple light, face shining golden countenance, myriad spirits bowing, the Ten Heavens’ officers welcoming. After nine years of cultivation, one flies and ascends the Great Emptiness, pays homage at the Golden Gate, and roams the sun and moon’s chambers. Careless leakage of the treasured text brings the Seven Ancestors’ charge; the self perishes, three disciples suffer five hardships, countless kalpas without reprieve. Practitioners beware.

Those who cultivate this dao, on the appointed days, write talismans facing the center, knock teeth thirty-six times, close eyes and envision the sun and moon’s Two Luminaries above their own eyes, purple and yellow qi flourishing like smoke, crowning and encircling the body. Then raise the head and draw in the sun and moon’s two lights, swallowing the purple and yellow qi fifty times, swallowing saliva ten times, and softly recite:

“Eight spirits move the mysterious thread, Two Luminaries return to the Great Emptiness. Three Dawns share the numinous radiance, Seven essences shine with eight rays. Refine and transform above the Golden Gate, bathe in the Eastern Well. Flowing brilliance veils the cavern wilds, Stone Radiance scatters in the Upper Palace. Essence sprinkles beyond the Nine Heavens, vast spirit herb irrigates the Ten Directions. Looking up to consume the Eight Primal qi, riding Heaven to gather the flying emperor. Spirits descend, six stomachs flourish, reverse form and shine golden countenance. Long preserve the sun and moon’s root, myriad kalpas without end.”

Then consume the talisman and stop. When practicing this dao, be cautious of filth. If violating this prohibition, throw one zhu of true vermilion into water to bathe oneself before proceeding. This is the supreme secret dao; leakage causes the dao to vanish, secrecy preserves the dao. Cultivators should secretly practice to surely attain the upper immortals.

All advanced practitioners who obtain this method, if they do not diligently cultivate, think truly, and contemplate the spirit, remaining no different from the mundane, thus do not lose concealment but remain lower immortals, dissolving by day into corpse liberation. When the life passes under the underground lord of the Great Yin, or the bones transform the fetus, receiving transformation in the Southern Palace, they must lodge with the bone register, should obtain this scripture, and ultimately return to the immortals.

The Supreme Dao Jade Morning Lord received the Nine Profound Great Emptiness numinous text, the method of the sun and moon’s imperial radiance, the emperor’s twelve upper vows, the Mysterious Mother’s Eight Gates, the twelve upper vows’ ritual qi, reporting to the bright dawn of the Nine Heavens, summoning the ritual qi to call spirits. This is the moon’s radiance and sun’s light reflected at the Eastern Well. Those who obtain and practice this dao will have the Eight Primal qi naturally descend, surely gathering the sun and moon’s flying roots. The twelve upper vows can be fulfilled; the Mysterious Mother’s Eight Gates will carve the upper immortals. Without this method, one damages spirit in vain, gains nothing in seeking immortality. If wishing to perform it, receive the master’s oral transmission. This dao is subtle and marvelous, not practiced in the world. Those who obtain it are all recorded in the Azure Palace in reverse before birth, surely recorded in the Eastern Radiance, destined to be Jade Clarity Perfected Ones.

After inviting the Eight Emperors, face north, close eyes and inwardly envision eight primal clouds filling the chamber, thick and vast, descending from the sky, filling the room, crowning and encircling the body. Knock teeth thirty-six times, raise the head, draw in cloud qi twenty-four times and stop. Then recite:

“Auspicious day with good time, eight paths’ qi pure and clear. Subtle firmament rides the motion, flowing clouds shine in the Purple Court. Primal radiance brightens the Great Void, reins held swiftly on the green carriage. Flying roots refine the eight rays, imperial radiance brightens the soul essence. Two images emit wondrous ford, flowing fragrance irrigates the Great Darkness. Mysterious Mother seals the upper vows, eight slips present cinnabar sincerity. Ritual summons spirits to feast, looking up to the Eight Primal clouds. Spirits descend, not ending at dawn, swiftly the mysterious light pours. With vows to court the Jade Palace, compose chapters in the Eastern Radiance Court. Grant the eight luminary carriages, primal spirits bear the flying carriages. Spirit thoughts sense the mysterious response, vows do not harm my life.”

Then all face north and bow nine times, ending the ritual. The rest of the ritual ceases here; do not recklessly share with others. Practice this twelve times a year, three years thus, then no further practice.

This dao is most secret, not practiced in the world. Those who cultivate many scriptures, prepare talismans and swallow qi, but do not perform the ritual at bright dawn, the true spirit will not descend, the mind will not be moved, laboring in vain, damaging spirit and losing qi, no benefit in seeking immortality.

Those who obtain the method, if they follow the ritual for three years according to the days, the Nine Heavens are pleased, the Eight Primal rejoice, spirits and truths respond and descend, and in eight years can ride the carriage lightly, flying through the Great Emptiness. The ancient perfected ones’ ritual methods all use golden liquid and jade spirit herb; the world lacks these substances, but precious fruits and exquisite flavors suffice to move spirits and truths.

The Emperor opens goodness, wishing to perform the eight slips, precisely to condense the spirits and truths, hoping to summon numinous immortals. Now the Immortals of the Five Mountains and the Immortal Maidens of Divine Land still sip golden liquid and press jade spirit herb, proclaim great vows, present the eight slips, aspire to the Great Essence, serve the Three Primes, aim for the morning sky, become jade truth, elevate the Seven Ancestors, enter the Vast Cold. How could the mediocre and base among the five turbidities in the world replace this and not cultivate, hear but not act?

Though form and spirit accumulate goodness through generations, if seven generations bear unresolved sins, one cannot hope for immortality. One must make great vows, present the eight slips, perform the ritual fruits, hope for spirit descent, release old roots, and only then can the destined body attain immortality, surely becoming an upper immortal.

Without ancestral merging with immortals, carving names in the Upper Palace, this text cannot be seen. Those who obtain the numinous chapters are given twelve jade boys and twelve jade girls to attend and guard the spirits and truths, correcting leaks. Violating the clear prohibition is punished with the wind blade; the Seven Ancestors charge responsibility; bearing stones, climbing mountains, three disciples suffer five hardships, countless kalpas without reprieve. Practitioners beware.

Those who cultivate the Eight Primal dao and practice the eight slips’ method, always on the Beginning of Spring and Beginning of Autumn, enter the chamber at dawn, face north, knock teeth three times, envision the Great Essence Lord, head crowned with the sun’s round light and precious radiance, body clothed in cloud light and cloud-patterned white ribbon; the Beginning Essence Lord, head crowned with moon pearl and precious night radiance, wearing purple cloud robes and white ribbon. The two essences ride together on purple and green clouds, flying carriages and jade wheels, twelve phoenixes, thirty-six jade maidens from the Upper Palace hovering above Jade Clarity, traveling northeast. Then perform eight bows, eight knocks of the head, eight slaps of the cheeks, softly reciting:

“Primordial two spirits, primal qi high and bright, circling the jade carriage, auspicious day to practice purity, spirits’ light rises above, shining on my form, connecting my nine origins, descending my eight essences, four meetings interweave, five treasures cloud arise, riding the first luminary, ascending Jade Court, bowing to the Great Essence, receiving immortal primal spirit.”

Then raise head and swallow eight times.

On the Spring and Autumn Equinox days, at mealtime enter the chamber, face east, knock teeth three times, envision the Mysterious Essence Lord, head crowned with blue radiance and nine qi of the Year Star, wearing flying cloud nine-transform white ribbon; the Original Essence Lord, head crowned with white light and Great White Star precious radiance, wearing flowing cloud flying robes. The two essences ride together on mysterious yellow clouds, flying wheels and feathered canopies, twenty-four phoenixes, thirty-six primal spirit jade maidens hovering within Jade Void, traveling southeast. Then perform four bows, four knocks of the head, four slaps of the cheeks, softly reciting:

“Mysterious origin two luminaries, high honored primal spirits, transforming qi scattering spirit, flying soaring the Golden Gate, purple void reins the carriage, five spirits wing the pavilion, circling the splendid court, illuminating nine clouds, auspicious day, Heaven’s origin spreads, myriad blessings meet, my wish is natural, Most High flows down, forever preserve primal truth, riding luminaries flying the void, ascending Jade Morning, bowing to the Upper Mystery, receiving transformation to high immortality.”

Then swallow eight qi and stop.

On the Beginning of Summer and Beginning of Winter days, enter chamber at true center, face southeast, knock teeth three times, envision the Purple Essence Lord, head crowned with cinnabar origin and shining star of eight lights, wearing mysterious yellow nine-colored silk ribbon; the Yellow Essence Lord, head crowned with mysterious morning star and five-colored precious radiance, wearing flying cloud seamless silk brocade ribbon. The two essences ride together on purple and blue clouds, jade wheels and jade carriages, nine dragons supporting mystery, twenty-four jade maidens from the Upper Palace hovering above Purple Void, traveling east. Then bow twice, knock head twice, slap cheeks twice, softly reciting:

“Purple yellow void spirit, two essences high truth, riding void dropping luminaries, whistling wind commanding smoke, roaming Jade Clarity, profound viewing Purple Heaven, primal blessings auspicious, high saint spreads, flowing essence billions, washing ford thousands, descending encircling below, spreading through Nine Profounds, grant me eight luminaries, flying ascending without interval, shining with the sun, matching the moon’s year.”

Then swallow eight qi and stop.

On the Summer Solstice and Winter Solstice days, enter chamber at dusk, face west, knock teeth three times, envision the White Essence Lord, head crowned with yellow origin and three shining star qi, wearing yellow-green shining cloud patterned robe; the Flying Essence Lord, head crowned with seven luminaries and purple origin flowing light, wearing seven-colored cloud silk robe. The two essences ride together on blue rainbow clouds, flying jade purple canopy, twelve flying qilins, thirty-two jade maidens of Taihua, hovering above Cave Clarity, traveling southwest. Then perform six bows, six knocks of the head, six slaps of the cheeks, and recite:

“Flying luminaries eight primal, white origin condenses essence, mysterious qi joins blessings, blending Jade Clarity, flowing clouds two colors, shining truth in heavenly court, Jade Emperor reins the carriage, supporting purple jade, circling cinnabar chambers, eight qi profoundly bright, revolving through Heaven’s origin, flowing glances on my form, turning my cloud wheels, descending my flying carriage, attaining with Eight Primal, matching luminaries true spirit.”

Then swallow qi eight times and stop.

This Eight Primal True Practice of the Banquet Radiance, the Way of Gathering in the Cloud Capital, the name of High Spirit Jade, passed mouth to mouth, without golden books or green characters, listed in the mysterious charts, none may consult or hear. Those who practice its method, the Eight Primal arrive at the chamber; after eight years naturally illuminate the Eight Palaces, fly through the void, ride the mysterious, roaming the Jade Clarity.

Those who receive the Eight Primal True Scripture must fast with the master for one hundred days, or thirty days, bringing eight taels of superior gold, thirty chi each of five-colored silk, one set of ritual robes, to pledge the oath of the Nine Heavens’ spirits. Upon receiving the Eight Primal inner name, twenty-two chi of silk with patterns are used to declare the oath to the treasured truth. Without this trust, one must not recklessly reveal the Eight Primal name. Careless leakage of the High Spirit brings the Seven Ancestors’ charge; the receiver also faces the wind blade’s trial. True radiance swiftly departs; laboring in study is futile; the true form does not descend. Transmission and reception must be cautious, as with the Four Extremities’ pledge.
