### The Profound True Scripture of the Most High Eight Primal Essences: The Sublime Secret of the Three Radiances

**The Method of Receiving the Nine Stars of the Northern Dipper**

**The Method of Receiving the Five Stars of the Five Directions**

**The Method of Receiving the Nine Stars of the Northern Dipper**

The brilliance of the sun and moon is called Light; the essence of the stars is called Radiance. Together they are known as the Seven Luminaries, collectively called the Three Radiances. The Radiance is the image of luminous essence. By following these images to attain brightness, containing light and receiving radiance, one achieves long life and immortality. Such a person is called a Disciple of the Three Radiances, ascending into the void and entering the radiance, becoming one with the True, transforming freely, harmonizing perfectly with the True. This is the secret of the highest sages—handle it with utmost caution, never to be recklessly transmitted.

Regularly, on the ninth day at dawn during the early ten days of the first, fourth, seventh, and tenth months—the four beginnings; also on the nineteenth day at midday during the middle ten days of the second, fifth, eighth, and eleventh months—the four middles; and on the twenty-ninth day at midnight during the last ten days of the third, sixth, ninth, and twelfth months—the four ends; plus the first day of each month, practice this three times. Dawn to noon, noon to night, night to dawn, night to dawn to noon—thirty-six times a year, corresponding to the full cycle of three hundred and sixty degrees. The number five represents the surplus energy of fullness.

When the appointed day and hour arrive, enter the chamber with solemn purity, burn incense and focus the spirit. Close the eyes and hold the breath, knock the teeth nine times to open the passages, and envision the Nine Star Palaces and their Divine Lords, majestic and dignified, standing guard in solemn array.

The First is the Yang Bright Divine Person, exhaling the light of azure qi.

The Second is the Yin Spirit Divine Person, exhaling the light of black qi.

The Third is the Perfected True Divine Person, exhaling the light of yellow qi.

The Fourth is the Mysterious Darkness Divine Person, exhaling the light of crimson qi.

The Fifth is the Cinnabar Origin Divine Person, exhaling the light of white qi.

The Sixth is the North Pole Divine Person, exhaling the light of green qi.

The Seventh is the Heavenly Pass Divine Person, exhaling the light of scarlet qi.

The Eighth is the Auxiliary Star Divine Person, exhaling the light of turquoise qi.

The Ninth is the Assisting Star Divine Person, exhaling the light of profound black qi.

Each of the nine qi flows from its star, descending to the mouth of the visionary, exhaling in order. The utmost qi is swallowed, infinitely subtle and penetrating; the old qi is gently expelled, while gradually new qi of nine colors is received and swallowed. When all is finished, knock the teeth nine times to open the passages, sitting, lying, walking, and resting in harmony with the person’s nature.

After nine years of this, the Nine Sovereign Divine Lords descend to bestow the secret formula. One attains long life and immortality, ascending the Three Heavens, forming friendships with many True Ones, and uniting with the Dao.

**The Method of Receiving the Five Stars of the Five Directions**

On the day of the Five Kings, at the hour of the Six Ding, enter the chamber with solemn purity, burn incense to preserve the spirit, close the eyes and hold the breath, knock the teeth twenty-five times to open the passages, swallow saliva twenty-five times, harmonize the heart and calm the qi, straighten the body and remain still.

One then sees the Year Star with azure qi, the Fire Star with crimson qi, the Great White Metal Star with white qi, the Earth Star with black qi, and the Guarding Star with yellow qi, each in its proper direction, vibrant and radiant, their mists intermingling, five colors blending, shining brightly, crowning the heavens and piercing the earth, spreading across the four directions, reflecting within and without the visionary’s body, permeating all.

After a long while, the body warms and fragrant incense fills the air. Then, facing each King’s direction, first swallow the King’s qi, then swallow the qi of their generating cycle, circulating until complete.

Swallow according to the number of each King: east nine times, south eight times, center three times, west six times, north five times. When finished, knock the teeth twenty-five times again and swallow saliva twenty-five times.

After practicing for five years, the Five Emperors guide and escort the adept to roam and feast in the Jade Capital, forever becoming a Perfected True One.

Those who receive the light essence qi of the sun, moon, Northern Dipper, and Five Stars must not speak excessively, must not overexert, must not be negligent or lax, must not give way to joy or anger, must not raise the voice, must not recklessly pursue other matters, must not seek rank or status, must not be partial, withered, or isolated, must not mix with unworthy companions, must not claim to possess the Dao, must not reveal these teachings, must not hastily expect quick results, must not doubt the numinous spirits, must not abandon the self to chase after things, must not force things against the body, must not oppose the two polarities, must not offend the Three Honored Ones.

Even if one cultivates other precepts and practices various disciplines, without this essential principle, the numinous spirit will neither show favor nor descend to aid; without efficacy, the Dao cannot be attained. The foundation for achieving the Dao lies in this secret formula. Fellow students of the higher learning must reverently observe and practice it.

Those who honor the Three Radiances are called Disciples of the Three Radiances. After three have crossed over, entrusted to the master and friends, and later taught, they may be called Masters, Teachers, or Perfected Ones of the Three Radiances. Only by the master’s command and friends’ recommendation may one receive such titles. Without formal presentation, one must not recklessly claim them. Those who falsely claim great titles, driven by greed for honor, will be severely punished after three warnings, with no pardon. Offenders must urgently repent, first turning to the Azure Youth to reform past faults. Following the master’s instructions, no further offenses are allowed. Three offenses return to the original source. Repeated apologies only increase the burden of guilt. Those who diligently study must be especially careful and thorough.

All who receive the Dao value immortality above all, cultivating with effective practice to preserve long life, endlessly renewing life, thus becoming True Sages. The foundation of the sage is conduct and transformation; transformation leads to teaching and rebirth. Those lost do not follow; pity them without abandoning them. When they stray, guide them back to the correct path with tireless care. Compassion encourages the obedient; they never grow weary. Sad thoughts do not arise; anger and resentment do not take hold.

When reproving anger, first observe the heart. If possible, feign kindness to move them; if not, do not conceal resentment to appease them. Appeasement must not allow their grievance to grow, for grievance only deepens fault. Stir them often to progress; retreat loses blessings and gains misfortune. Solitary study yields no merit and cannot form virtue.

In the ancient past, when there was no turmoil, faults were few and did not require merit to atone. With focused thought and guarded stillness, avoiding contact, all attained the True Dao. Since the middle ages, affairs grew complicated; enmities accumulated. Urgent merit is needed to reduce harm and save beings. Preserve the Dao, recite scriptures, follow the master without negligence, day and night with concentrated heart and body, enduring hardship without complaint, avoiding evil tendencies, startled as if touching boiling water, satisfied in pursuing goodness as if thirsty seeking drink.

When the world is blocked, one temporarily remains solitary; when the world is open, one forever spreads and aids. When danger cannot be helped, one departs carefree; pity remains in the heart, remembrance never ceases. When decline can be saved, diligently manage and restrain, draw in and give out, contract and expand, observe the times, balance joy and anger, reward and punishment, promotion and demotion according to the moment.

The turning of times brings acceptance or rejection; sages and true ones have conduct and concealment. Without utmost refinement, none can comprehend this. The crude and shallow, falsely claiming truth, acting small yet pretending great, unaware of blockage and openness, confused and unable to avoid, rashly seeking merit, disaster comes unrecognized, plans fail instead of succeed.

Some do not repent, turning calamity into fortune; some repent late, with no chance to recover. The wheel of five sufferings of reincarnation is deeply painful indeed. Those aspiring to higher learning must carefully study and examine. Transformation of body and things requires ability and attainment; one cannot let a mosquito bear a mountain. Do not fail and then realize; great and small each have wondrous methods. Measure your strength and cultivate accordingly, all following the master’s formula, never acting on whim.

The heart is like a monkey or a wild fire—cannot be grasped or controlled. Without the master and lord, how can it be set right? Yet correctness comes from oneself—half master, half self; these two halves become one, then Truehood is attained. Without a master, one cannot return; with a master but no self, one cannot transform. Transformation is change and renewal—abandon the old and embrace the new, forsake evil and enter goodness, refine falsehood into truth. The master’s achievement and the true nature’s virtue harmonize eternally, becoming one with the Dao.

Those who wish to learn the Dao but are ashamed of masters, secretly steal scriptures, buy and redeem precepts, not understanding the profound command, acting at will—some do not follow the sacred classics, simply doing good by nature. Goodness is truly good, yet incomplete; partial goodness is small goodness, not forming great virtue. Demons come to corrupt, thus falling into evil factions, forever separated from the Dao. They labor for fame but gain no real learning—this is truly lamentable.

Such people must urgently repent; early awakening can save them, late awakening makes success difficult. Learners must self-reflect, examining themselves and others. Though others are hard to know, know them by law; the law inspects rise and fall, observes inside and outside, heart and body can be understood, emptiness and reality made clear. Remove emptiness and reward reality; merit and virtue will bear witness.
