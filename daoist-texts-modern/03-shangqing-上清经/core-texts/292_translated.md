### The Profound True Scripture of the Supreme Elder of the Cavern, the Eight Primal Truths: The Marvelous Secret of the Three and Five-Phase Transformations

The Four True Men of the Great Ultimate consulted the Most High Lord of the Great Dao, saying:  
“We consume the essence of sun and moon, hasten toward the marvels of the two luminaries, the utmost marvel, the highest treasure. Descending as the Divine Elixir, the Three Harmonies form virtue. We have humbly heard the command. Is the Dao sufficient to rest here?”

The Most High replied:  
“Well asked, a question of great benefit to all. Whoever learns the Dao does so by accumulating goodness. Within this, the methods and techniques—both internal and external—aid completion. Breathing in and out, consuming and absorbing, all are methods. The Three Wisdoms and Five Insights are all good deeds. Without establishing good deeds, methods bear no proof; even if proven, it will not last, and lasting too long will bring ruin to the body. The superior person of great talent first establishes good deeds, then methods. Methods are vast and countless, refined and coarse in ranks. Though each depends on conditions, from coarse to marvelous, the marvel lies in the Three Harmonies, in this sun-and-moon Divine Elixir. To swiftly gain effect, one must diligently practice myriad virtues. But myriad virtues cannot be done all at once; practicing them without knowing the essentials is futile. The key lies in the Three and Five. When the Three and Five are attained, myriad virtues naturally stand. Though the number may not be sufficient, within it one can cultivate methods. Methods and goodness move and rest together. Practiced and accumulated over time, no more than nine years, one will surely gain divine powers and ascend to true sagehood.”

The True Man bowed deeply and earnestly asked again:  
“May we hear the essentials of the Three and Five?”

The Most High answered:  
“You may hear them, but do not pass them to others unworthy. The Three are wisdom; the Five are insight. The Three Wisdoms are knowing Heaven, knowing Earth, and knowing Humanity. Knowing humanity follows Earth’s law; tranquility is the root. Knowing Earth follows Heaven’s law; harmony and compliance are the foundation. Knowing Heaven follows the Dao; movement does not disturb stillness. Stillness is ever deep and abiding; movement benefits all things, benefiting all without name or pride, without toil or worry, without weariness or refusal—this is clear knowing. To understand fully without doubt, merging virtue with the sun, thus called the Three Wisdoms. Wisdom is knowing. To know these Three Talents is to be fit to walk the Dao. Dao is penetration. Benevolence, righteousness, propriety, knowledge, and faith—the Five—are all unobstructed. Unobstructed means thorough, endlessly aiding. Things and self arise mutually, arising and arising most swiftly. Swift action without slack, resolving doubts without hesitation, benefits without end—thus called the Five Insights. The Five Insights unite with the Three Wisdoms; the Three Wisdoms penetrate the Five Insights. Wisdom and insight are boundless, intelligence without limit. Forgetting obstruction leads to penetration; long life without death comes from the Three and Five. Myriad virtues complete each other, each with its own scriptures, precepts, rules, and dignified conduct. Heaven’s patterns and Earth’s laws, human principles clearly distinguished. Fathers teach sons; lords command ministers; teachers instruct disciples; the lowly also offer respect to the high. Without mind, words are forgotten; with mind, mutual benefit arises. Benefiting others without claiming merit, merit forgotten by name is highest virtue; virtue attaining the supreme Dao always without fault—this is the ultimate for learners, the very source of this tradition.”

The True Man further asked:  
“The unsurpassed wondrous essence, I earnestly wish to proclaim and practice it. The high transforms the low, the low reveres the high. The teacher and disciple’s proper relations, the scriptures and scrolls interwoven—sometimes before, sometimes after, sometimes in the middle, sometimes separate ritual texts, sometimes transmitted formulas—generations differ, families and nations vary. Complexity and simplicity combined, usage is often doubtful. I dare not decide arbitrarily. Time slips by, the bright day easily fades, an inch of time hard to keep. Cultivation out of accord with the body increases guilt and faults. No way to save it. Bowing and looking up, ashamed and fearful, I submit to the Heavenly Venerable. The Heavenly Venerable compassionately bends to hear. Please grant the true essentials, especially a cautionary teaching.”

The Most High replied:  
“Learning must have a teacher; the teacher’s word is final. All writings and cultivation are to be forgotten; differences in quantity and quality are all intentions. How could all be fully spoken? Methods unfold to benefit all beings; all beings have mind and heart, urgently needing encouragement. I will speak the essentials; you should carefully measure and at the right time rest, never turning away from the source of the tradition.”

The True Man rejoiced, bowed, and accepted the command.

The Most High said:  
“The reason noble persons are equal to Heaven and Earth is that they can mutually instruct and guide. First learn awakening, then awareness, returning the flow to the one source. Abandon suffering and embrace joy—this is precious and honorable. Thus those who attain the Dao, the immortals and true ones, though not yet ultimate great sages, later all arise with heart and vow. By fate and response, they descend again among humans to praise the wondrous methods, accumulate virtue and merit, and then ascend to great sagehood. The great sage’s foundation lies in conduct and teaching, strict and clear instruction, correcting evil with righteousness, compassion, joy, and generosity, proclaiming the four classes. Those who cannot do so, though reciting scriptures day and night, wearing talismans and qi, labor much but gain little. To achieve the great vehicle, the great vehicle prioritizes universal aid; universal aid urgently opens transformation, urgently teaching all beings to hold the one, preserve the three, practice the five without laxity, and thoroughly investigate the great vehicle. Among these, small understanding cannot bear the great method; the small follow and entrust to it. Conduct and concealment lie with the teacher; the teacher is clear and without error. Carefully reflect inwardly; do not recklessly sing falsehoods, for oneself or others. The later body precedes the earlier. Unless one is a person of profound wisdom and penetrating insight, one cannot be spoken to about this Dao. When practicing transformation, first sincerely practice what is learned. What is learned has proof; though not ultimate, it can roughly save emergencies. Emergency practice is swift; waiting for perfection,功不进，求备则无期矣。求备有期，在乎并行，并行并习，并习并验，验不即者，久久自征，自征数满，满则得道。得道极修，不可即登，虽不可即登，当稍稍行习。习之以时，行之会运，运之未会，不可强时。易失可亏，亏时强运，劳而致弊，得时逢运，逸而保全。全德之人，不失时运，时运不是，上下相疑，内外精忌，阴阳相伤，此不可冒犯。犯之考深，幽显得罪，不可解除，欲免斯祸，谛识运时。四序五行，相续不绝，依时修习，无暂懈退，感至运开，各有其法。三洞诸经，法法不同，运兴则用，运衰则舍，不得轻慢，敬与用平，运有行藏，道无轻重也。化身化家，化乡化国，化天下，天下不相许，与勿犯之，国乡家身，皆同一法。身习不宜，亦莫苦强，苦强致敝，退败成灾，坠陷地狱，永隔天堂，人身尚不可得，何冀乎仙真。真人之学，自试为先，先习某所受事，可则进，不可则止。止不为恶，更思因缘，因缘未深，徐密又进，进可则前，不可又已。已重首过，惭愧屏营，不得对退，与他言之。默复潜习，一事三为，三为不可，可更易方。方法无数，随受施行，行化化身，然后及物，自一身及天下，至于无央。天下皆同，密行此术，此术练心，心练质易，质易心精，成真有期矣。

凡行妙化，当先化身，化身者先志道。道在心中，心中存道，道不可见，心不可忘，不忘心者，存道坚正，正道在心，心事不怀，邪不敢干，名之为志，志道至坚，成於事也。何由自坚，坚由大慈，慈爱一切，不异己身，身不损物，物不损身，一切含炁，木草壤灰，皆如己身，念之如子，不生轻慢意，不起伤彼心，心恒念之，与己同存。有识愿其进道，无识愿其识生，此应天德，万善之先，久行朗达，与日月并明也。

凡行妙化，先当化身，化身者先志道，志道已，次守德。德在识中，识中有神，神识笃道，守德成真，真人所习，习善不忘，忆之无遗，名之为识，识善行慈，生生为始，次用俭慎，慎终如始，无败无杂，号曰真人。谨密不忘，动身隐静，为事出则应时，时去即沦，不滞乎物。声色不能污，劳辱不能累，处富贵时，不积不傲，不骄不奢，不华不耀；在贫贱日，不谄不佞，不矫不偷，不唝不嗃。居中有常，厚薄取衷，潜光布实，持节用敬，节有尊贵之报，实光招洞真之果，修俭不休，与日月合德也。

凡行妙化，先当化身，化身者先志道，次守德，终谦卑。卑者，知也、移也、底也。识神有知道、知德，道尊德贵，不可妄求，求之以谦，卑以自牧，位势在前，退身在后。次第在后，无觊於前，恒居众下，底极之乡，人所不竞，俗所不营，止而不闷，思道益坚，守德弥固。群生所伏，凡所不能，己独能之，超群出众，神明所矜，正真所佑，移下升高，自地登天，舍凡入圣，遂成大智慧之源，一切所宗，天人所仰。由平退身，度人致能，居后反前，谦让更得，不静最雄，不敢为先，自之先达，人中之尊，天地齐一，白日登晨。星辰之极，三智之实，实在慈俭，不敢为先，智之妙也。

凡行妙化，先当化身，化身者习三智，三智已，遵五慧。五慧者，仁礼信义智也。三智洞者，包乎五慧，五慧中智，即是三智。学习未究，三智未相包，修行未通，五慧未相一。故立名有殊，三五成异。然则五慧中智，智未极也，极则在三同一，一同无复五矣。仁礼信义，亦有智分，智分在四，四故得成，四无此智，不能立也。四有少分，故不受智名，智分居多，故与四德为五，五德相通，平等无偏。无偏则无复五名，名元则与三智为一。三智初一，一就五焉，号为六通，洞达之后，又无三焉。三五既吻，谓之七觉，觉悟了然，究竟无极。有数无数，朗彻无碍，分之则分，合之则合，合不累分，分不累合，合则总称曰一，分则略名为七。七阶示渐，引末归源，识神生知，是其一也；知而能见，是其二也；见而能从，是其三也；从而能习，是其四也；习而能坚，是其五也；坚而能成，是其六也；成而不居，是其七也。七觉七阶，由乎一觉，觉有浅深，次第为七，过此以往，洞入道源。八达无穷，非言所说，说不能穷，默识自了。默识自了，其言自忘，忘言得道，道之上也。

凡行妙化，先当化身，化身者遵五慧。仁者好生恶杀，救败护成，禁忌杀伤，隔绝嫉妬，能和合阴阳，放生度死，慈悲慊款，念念弗忘，积仁长寿，遂登神仙。神仙所贵，贵乎相生，生长不绝，隐显相传，传行有气，气质有名。名仁者主木，木生火，火为礼。礼者恭敬内外，揖拜有仪，崇仰三尊，贵养重和，禁忌骄慢，断绝贪淫，能清贞廉洁，久则神仙。火生土，土为信。信者中实不妄，誓无负违，禁忌虚诈，欺内者诛，能心口相应，孚谅有征，笃厚诚实，久则神仙。土生金，金为义。义则明断是非，赏善罚恶，去邪就正，决嫌定疑，舍财不盗，抑猛佑赢，禁忌迷惑，邪见狐疑，强梁自用，窃夺公私，能奖福遏祸，治乱止暴，清素博赡，久则神仙。金生水，水为智。智者一切知了，分别真伪，禁忌奸邪，愚痴执滞，能清平洞彻，勤学教人，善诱无倦，久则神仙。五德偏多，有功有罪，有进有退，更相补赎。多善受福，多恶受祸，祸福无门，唯人所召，所召未专，善恶回换，虽福至天堂，尚有退落，祸入地狱，亦有超升。皆非学道之俦，正是流俗之侣，粗知信向，不能得真。真仙之道，付上士志人，志人上志，皆好学真仙，懃习三智，精修五慧。三智平等俱行，不偏不着，积久周通，克登上圣，与道合真，更相传授，必得其人。学不知三五，徒自劳苦耳。知者秘之，密行勿泄也。

凡行妙化，先当化身，化身者先受法。受法不斋，率尔传付，或斋戒不精，信物不备，或协势强求，不遵师法，或因缘遇得，不寻明师，或玄盟不洗，信物不输，初欲修行，俄便废弃，或更狐疑，訾毁敞露，形言丑恶，秽辱万端，或秘之不解，无意研寻，供养违科，施置非所，轻慢灵文，苟存我有，或夺或乞，窃览妄行。犯此诸罪，风刀无原，急宜解谢，洗心浣肠，归命青童，礼拜首愆，三年不替，罪必被原，后不重犯，乃得行经。若相命未合，由功德未充，唯存青童，开通心识，解咎殃之结，降洞朗之明，使究了玄义，自照因缘，修行速验，克成上真也。

### The Method of Preserving the Lord Qing Tong

In the midst of the Eastern Sea lies the mountain Fangzhu, originally named the Palace of Eastern Ridge and Eastern Splendor, circling three thousand li, with six gates.

The East Gate is named the Gate of Azure Splendor; its gatekeeper’s surname is Li, given name Boyuan, overseeing the records of those who study immortality.

The South Gate is named the Jade Gate of Divine Splendor; its gatekeeper’s surname is Wang, given name Zusi, overseeing the True Men’s comings and goings in flight.

The West Gate is named the Jade Cavern Gate; its gatekeeper’s surname is Kang, given name Shangjie, overseeing the exalted assembly of True Ones, the Jade Emperor, the Thirty-Nine Emperors, the Twenty-Four Jade True Ones, and the Western Turtle Queen Mother.

The North Gate is named the Jade Yin Gate; its gatekeeper’s surname is Shi, given name Shaoye, overseeing true immortals and beginners, recording those who repent and descend.

The Southeast Gate is named the Heavenly Pass Gate; its gatekeeper’s surname is Wen, given name Wuche, overseeing the registers of fate and cause, the origins of attaining immortality.

The Northeast Gate is named the Cold Water Gate; its gatekeeper’s surname is Zhong, given name Lindu, overseeing the records of ghosts and spirits in transit.

To the right of these six gates lies the Eastern Ridge of Heaven. The mountain gates are guarded by three hundred lions and three hundred giant beasts, with three thousand gate generals guarding each gate. Those who study the Dao first learn the names and order of the gates. Those who understand will not die; this is called the Azure Palace. Entering the chamber, burning incense, one always remembers the gate names and the gatekeepers’ surnames and given names. After nine years, one rides the clouds and ascends into the Six Gates.

Within the Six Gates are three palaces. The First Palace is named the Azure Palace of Fangzhu, governed by the Prime Minister Qing Tong.

The Second Palace is named the Jade Protector Azure Palace, governed by the Grand Marshal Gao Chen.

The Third Palace is named the Jade Splendor Azure Palace, governed by the Eastern Sea’s Azure Splendor Youth.

Within these three inner palaces grow hundreds of jade trees, above which perch the Kun rooster, phoenix, and nine-colored birds. Below grow magical herbs and jade wells that spring forth naturally; drinking from them grants longevity equal to the Three Luminaries. Lions and heavenly beasts assist and guard outside the walls.

Those who have not completed learning the Dao are all hindered by karmic obstacles. They must purify and fast, burn incense, repent sins, and pray for blessings. On the day and hour of the Wood Rabbit, emerge onto the open ground; if it rains, remain in the hall. Face east, knock teeth three times, close eyes and envision the three palaces. Recite the name of the Prime Minister Qing Tong, within the Azure Palace of Fangzhu, inside the golden hall and jade chambers, with three thousand True Maidens attending, guarding left and right. The mysterious radiance shines forth, the divine brilliance illuminates itself, azure clouds shade above, purple mist surrounds. On the northern hall’s upper level hangs a jade tablet, on which is the register of immortals’ names and dates, with one hundred thousand volumes of golden slips and jade tags, overseen by the Immortal Registrar.

Imagine your name preserved within, hold it firmly for a long time, then see the form of Lord Qing Tong, radiant and brilliant, heart steadfast, hands folded, stating your rank and name, now sincerely submitting to Lord Qing Tong, bowing three times. After bowing, secretly knock three times, whispering: “I beg forgiveness for this humble one, [name], for past and present deep offenses and grave sins. Open my heart and awaken my mind, so I may understand the profound scriptures, know my fate, swiftly become a divine immortal, bring prosperity to my family, and spread Dao and virtue.” Then bow three more times, knock three times, and cease. One may also face north, performing this ritual once every sixty days. Keep it in constant remembrance in the heart. If unable to find the Wood Rabbit day, other Rabbit days may be used. If unable to perform every sixty days, one may do so by the four seasons. Those who perform it perfunctorily accumulate sins and do not correct themselves, only increasing faults. It is better to perform once a year thoroughly and sincerely than many times superficially and falsely. Without the sixty-day practice, perform one ritual with three hundred sixty bows, up to three thousand six hundred bows. If the body is not overly fatigued, one may perform twelve hours in one day and night, three hundred bows per hour, totaling three thousand six hundred. After the ritual, reflect on faults and correct them, never repeating them; preserve good deeds without pause. After three years, the Three Honored Ones will descend and appear.
