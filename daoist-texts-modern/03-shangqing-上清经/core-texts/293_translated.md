### The Four Perfected Ones of the Supreme Ultimate inquire of the Most High Dao Lord:

*"Having received the dharma and transmitted the scripture, we have heard the words. As we cultivate step by step, where does one begin?"*

The Dao Lord replied:  
*"For those who begin their studies, they respectfully copy the scripture, arrange a separate chamber and desk, and offer incense and lamps morning and night to preserve the spirit. At dawn and dusk, they bow to what they have received. The Most High advises to proceed according to conditions; the rules differ, all are within the scripture, sometimes spoken directly, depending on the person. Those who receive teachings but neglect morning rites commit offenses and suffer repeated disgrace; their merits and practices do not flourish. If you sincerely wish to become true, do not forget the morning rites. If conditions are obstructed and the rites are not constant day and night, a good morning will not be lost, and there will be response and effect. I repeat this for you, carefully entrusting it to the person."*  

The Perfected Ones bowed their heads and accepted the command to carry it out.

### On Cultivating Merits and Achievements

Diligently seek the scriptures and admonitions, uphold essential precepts, deeply memorize them in your heart, keep the mind with understanding and intention, practice without doubt, without slackening or retreating, advancing daily with renewed vigor. Follow the teachings of the world’s transformations, act according to the times of concealment and manifestation. The scriptures of the Three Caverns appear and disappear in turn, harmonizing with the cosmic cycles to aid the urgent. Do not force or violate conditions; apply according to high and low circumstances, never suppress or abandon. Conditions must be balanced above and below, never discarded; one must find the middle path, neither blocking nor forcing passage. If one forces passage while blocking above, below, and the middle, confusion and rebellion arise, bringing disaster and trial. This must be carefully considered. When the great cycle harmonizes with the times, grades follow in order. On days without harmony, each receives a lesser portion, with depth and breadth varying; do not violate the ranks or leap beyond conditions. Be cautious not to oppose the cosmic cycle; with a refined heart, aspire to truth and strictly uphold the precepts alone.

### The Ten Precepts of the Fasting Method

One: Do not eat anything containing blood, nor living qi or the smoke of death. Only vegetables are permitted, and only in months not of growth.

Two: At dawn, sip porridge; at midday, eat the meal. After this, no sweet, rich, or flavorful foods may be consumed. During the day, burn incense; at night, light lamps. Incense must never be lacking even for a moment; sitting, rising, lying down, and resting must not depart from the rules.

Three: Abandon all causes and conditions except the Dao alone.

Four: Reflect on the scriptures and precepts, cleanse the heart, and advance diligently.

Five: Be compassionate and filial to all, pity and mourn the poor and destitute, open the way of life, and encourage the ignorant people.

Six: Repent and apologize for faults and sins, seek and beg for livelihood.

Seven: Renounce honor and glory; treasure lies in the Dao.

Eight: Labor the body and endure hardship, driven by the Dao.

Nine: Wish to remove all pain, the ten sufferings and eight difficulties, to save and deliver the people of this troubled world.

Ten: Respect the Dao and honor virtue, with heart and mouth in accord; cleanse the heart and advance diligently, aspiring to be among the immortals. Receive and uphold the scriptures and precepts, never daring to neglect or violate them. On the day of transcendence, unite with the Dao.

### The Most High’s Instruction:

*"Oversee the fasting masters, those in charge of fasting, reciting scriptures and practicing the Dao. When ascending the high seat, read one thousand words of scripture; if you hear but one sip of drink, it does not count as neglecting recitation."*  
This rule comes from the *Mid-Section of the Bright Instructions of the Four Extremes*.

### The Most High’s Instruction on Receiving the Five Difficult Precepts:

Those who receive the governance of the stars and accept the Three Treasures’ scriptures and dharma, the methods of the Mysterious True Scripture, after bowing, signing, and fasting, must receive the five difficult precepts. Those who do not receive these five precepts may not join the fasting officials’ registers. Those who have received the True Contract of Three Ones or above but do not accept the five difficult precepts may not be listed in the Upper Palace, nor may they submit petitions to the great chapters of the stars. If one submits petitions without receiving them, the Immortal Capital will not recognize the name, and exposed petitions will not be accepted. This is because without proper rules, the body is not pure; hence, petitions are not accepted. Moreover, the star officials do not accept petitions from unprecepted and impure masters. Therefore, there are great and small rules of precepts, clearly depending on acceptance.

There are five kinds of fasting qualifications, as follows:

One: Emergency aid and healing, following the Heavenly Master’s authoritative teachings. Entering the Three Primes method of repentance, begging for life, self-binding the forehead with mud, and the method of applying charcoal and pitch—all are within the authoritative teachings.

Two: The Spiritual Treasure’s Brahman conduct, gathering worthy ones to transform, cultivating the body and planting blessings. Within this is the method of life and death repentance, self-reproach, and reflection on faults.

Three: Supreme Clarity’s Immortal Seclusion, fasting for the seven generations of ancestors’ transmigration and ascension, also practiced monthly and straightened, a method of good conduct.

Four: True Unity’s guarding of stillness, thinking on the spirit and swallowing qi, a method of guidance and drawing in.

Five: Great Unity’s Divine Elixir, suitable for offerings to furnace fire and golden liquid, the method of closed chamber fasting for a full month. This is especially secluded and quiet, nourishing the spirit and continuing life, a pure and long fasting not subject to the five rules.

### On Daoists, Sacrificial Masters, and Male and Female Officials:

Those who have received the True Contract and the scriptures of Supreme Clarity and the Three Caverns, as well as the star governance methods, desiring to mark their name in the Mysterious Capital and submit petitions to the imperial decree, must receive the five difficult precepts of the Mysterious Capital. The precepts are as follows:

One: Do not disrespect Heaven; do not say Heaven has no spirit, nor call Earth without ghosts. Do not lightly scorn the earth gods, mountains, rivers, and great marshes, nor dig and bore without restraint. This is called denying the numinousness of Heaven and Earth, a fearless offense. Nor teach others to scorn Heaven and Earth, saying there are no spirits or ghosts.

Offense to this precept deducts three hundred heavenly calculations. One offense reduces lifespan by seven years, seven years of discipline, self-reflection on faults, and establishing merit to atone. If exceptional, one must swear thrice and then restore the prior position, counting merit and extending life. The Dao does not forsake people.

Two: Do not kill living beings, nor disturb nests or break eggs. Nor teach others to kill or disturb nests or break eggs.

Offense deducts one hundred sixty heavenly calculations. One offense reduces lifespan by five years, five years of discipline, self-reflection, establishing merit to atone, and purification of goodness. If exceptional, swear thrice, then restore position, count merit, and extend life. The Dao does not forsake people.

Three: Do not practice deceit, cunning theft, greed, or evil, scheming to take others’ possessions or will. Nor teach others to steal cunningly, covet possessions, or seize what others love.

Offense deducts one hundred twenty heavenly calculations. One offense reduces lifespan by four years, four years of discipline, self-reflection, accumulating merit to supplement virtue. If exceptional, then swear thrice, restore position, count merit, and extend life. The Dao does not forsake people.

Four: Do not drink wine, nor commit adultery with others’ wives, engage in immoral intercourse, or use public office for private gain. Nor teach others to drink, enjoy wives, take others’ children, or engage in immoral intercourse or misuse public office.

Offense deducts one hundred twenty heavenly calculations. One offense reduces lifespan by four years, four years of discipline, self-reflection, establishing merit to atone. If exceptional, then swear thrice, restore position, count merit, and extend life. The Dao does not forsake people.

Five: Do not curse, slander, envy, poison, or act without the Dao; do not slander good people or burn their homes. Nor teach others to curse, slander, envy, poison, slander good people, burn homes, or destroy households to repay grudges.

Offense deducts one hundred twenty heavenly calculations. One offense reduces lifespan by three years, three years of discipline, self-reflection, establishing merit to atone. If exceptional, swear thrice, restore position, count merit, and extend life. The Dao does not forsake people.

### On Daoists and Sacrificial Masters Who Do Not Receive the Precepts:

If they are careless in their Dao practice and violate prohibitions, petitions and memorials will not be heard. Rescue and relief often prove ineffective. This is because the Dao lacks proper rules, falling into the trials of wine and meat, a most careless state. Since the Three Saints ascended and transformed, true methods have become hidden, repeatedly despised by Heaven and Earth; the dharma methods have fallen into disrepair, old chapters lost. Even if sacrificial masters have not received the precepts, the registers already forbid them. Recently, many petitions have been made with no response from the celestial officials. One in a hundred may succeed, due to the sincere petitions of good people, deeply moved by the elixir’s goodness. The Heavenly Emperor directly protects and permits the petitions, all depending on the nature and life shown; merit does not depend on petitions or sacrificial masters. Yet foolish masters, mistaking the good effects of sincere people as their own merit, fear to disturb the people and seek improper gains, unaware of the sin of swallowing and hiding. They have already been reported and punished, their life names erased, lifespan reduced, and soon they perish. Because minor faults are not immediately examined as illness, they say Heaven and Earth are vast and do not check small faults. Some with minor merits delay punishment, extending their trials without adding small examinations. Yet their hidden sins are great, and in the example of expulsion, they must be destroyed before facing the torment of knife mountains and sword trees. Thus, small faults are not repeatedly examined. Foolish people do not understand and say that sins are not immediately punished, claiming Heaven and Earth allow indulgence. They say the heavens are vast and do not punish small faults, so there is no examination or blame. Such foolishness leads to daily faults and sins, claiming Heaven and Earth have no spirits. Those who have precepts know this is false, unaware they are already in the expulsion process, soon to perish unexpectedly. Heaven’s brightness is not to be deceived. Ignorant people think the Dao is light; I reflect on this with a heavy heart. Clearly, all should carefully do good, not be greedy or impure; sins are not light.

### The Most High’s Instruction:

Daoists, sacrificial masters, men and women officials who have received the true supreme dharma, and the supreme treasure scriptures, star governance, ranked from True One and above, and who have submitted to the dharma and received the true good precepts, must also receive the five difficult precepts and the great precepts of conditions. Having received the supreme dharma, if one does not receive these five precepts, their name will not ascend in the Immortal Capital’s elixir registers; their ink records and jade calendars will have no name; the Three Officials’ white registers will not erase their ghost names. After death, they become lower ghosts; their souls cannot become immortals; the trials never end, bringing disaster to descendants. The Dao folk have separate tests of sincerity and misfortune, which are not included here but recorded in the ink registers’ later sections.

---

### The Most High’s Instruction:

Those who study the Dao should diligently cultivate merit and atone for the sins of the seven ancestors, and also advance the immortal name for their family and self, to escape the ten sufferings and eight difficulties. They must receive the five difficult precepts, establish merit and virtue, seek the exalted immortal name in the Immortal Capital’s jade calendar, erase the Three Officials’ white death registers. You Dao followers, having received the great dharma, inner and outer true contracts, accumulating years, but whose conduct does not accord with nature and who do not receive the five difficult precepts, their bodies fall into the sins of meat and wine, their Dao practice lacks rules, thus committing offenses, losing calculations and life, dying as lower ghosts, unable to escape the torment of knife mountains and sword trees, suffering cruelly. This pains me deeply. You who follow the Dao, clearly observe the precepts, practice for three years without weariness, you will surely gain longevity; the heavenly calculations will increase. The heavenly officials examine the ink registers thrice yearly, calculating merits and faults, the Director of Life reports to Heaven, distinguishing good and evil, recording merits on the left contract, evil unatoned on the right contract, matters clearly manifest. The Dao does not forsake people, but few believe the truth; many violate laws and precepts, thus suffering punishment and fault. Clearly be cautious, be cautious to do good.

### On Daoists, Sacrificial Masters, and Officials:

Those who receive the true dharma, seek immortal transcendence, and extend life, must also practice precepts, establish merit and atone, heal the people, and submit petitions to the imperial decree. This must be done through diligent fasting and practice, receiving the precepts, not violating the rules, and advancing according to wishes, counting merits for transcendence. Their salary and lifespan will not be diminished.

---

### The Most High’s Instruction:

If one comes from noble rank and, though not receiving these precepts, their conduct accords with nature, they need not receive the precepts again. From ancient times to now, many such people exist, but today only one in a hundred. This cannot be taken as the norm. The key is to mark their virtue and accord with precepts. Except for those who are stubborn and utterly disdainful, one must receive precepts to establish the path of life. Thus, this precept system must be proclaimed.

---

### The Most High’s Instruction:

Whoever wishes to learn the Dao and seek truth, establish merit and virtue in the world, record their name in Heaven, and ascend to immortal officials, must receive the five difficult precepts, follow the precepts to practice the Dao for three years, establish merit and true name, then submit to the Immortal Capital, recorded in the elixir registers and jade calendar. The immortal register name is established; the Director of Life issues decrees to the Five Sacred Mountains, reports to the Three Officials below, informs the Perfected Ones, erases the Three Officials’ death registers and white books, removes ghost names. Only then can one truly be a cultivating Daoist, sacrificial master, or official. Such true names diligently remain in the Immortal Capital; all petitions are fully heard. Without receiving precepts and without diligence, the Immortal Capital has no merit name; petitions and memorials are all stopped. This is Dao practice without renown, merely wasting the people’s respect, offerings, and incense money, while incurring the trials of swallowing and hiding meat and wine. The soul and spirit are constantly sued and judged, all petitions unfavorable. Some break the law without being punished, or have no death registers in the Three Officials’ registers, often seen in good deeds not yet reaching evil, or have old grudges confusing the examiners’ minds, sins judged together. Thus, no small examinations occur; hidden sins accumulate, leading to expulsion and early death, not reaching three lifespans, sins compounded, added torment of knife mountains and fiery pits, dying as lower ghosts, suffering long pain. Is this not grievous? Grievous indeed.

New Daoists, sacrificial masters, men and women officials, if you wish to cultivate life and purify fate, seek truth with austerity, establish ghost control and healing with verified effect, and be revered by the people, you must receive the five difficult precepts. Having received the precepts, the Immortal Capital will record your name; diligently cultivate for three years, do not violate laws, the Director of Life will list you, report to the Heavenly Emperor, record your name in the jade calendar, and you will receive the Perfected One’s scattered title, able to control ghosts and heal with clear effect. Such goodness, can you not cultivate it?

---

### On Daoists, Sacrificial Masters, and Officials Wishing to Cultivate Ghost Control and Healing:

They must receive the Most High Middle Platform’s Five Precepts of Life Establishment. Having received these precepts, the Immortal Capital will confirm their rank, record in the elixir registers, and after diligent cultivation for three years, mark their name in the upper registers of the jade calendar. The Heavenly Emperor’s officials will examine merits diligently, inscribe the Five Sacred Mountains, Four Rivers, and Three Officials’ records, knowing your diligent and accumulated merits. Your name will be honored by the Mysterious Capital’s heavenly spirits and earth gods, subdued by all ghosts, your rescue and healing petitions reaching the heavens. You, having received the inner and outer great affairs, the mysteries of True One, if you do not receive the difficult precepts and neglect the five precepts, the Immortal Capital has no rank for you, the jade calendar has no name, your body bears the sins of sacrificial masters’ hidden impurities, and the Five Sacred Mountains, Four Rivers, and Three Officials’ ghosts and gods do not respect you. Your petitions are ignored. Because you run about in alleys, greedy and impure, disgraced, unaware of correction, violating rules and taboos, the Director of Life reports accordingly, reducing and deducting your lifespan. As a teacher of people, you violate minor laws, insufficiently examined, but known and repented, thus judged more severely. Today’s fools say that faults are not immediately punished as illness, claiming Heaven and Earth do not know their sins, or that there are no spirits, unaware that the shadow examination has already reported. Because of grudges and minor matters, they are not repeatedly reported, hoping to accumulate hidden sins, all in the expulsion example. Such death names are fixed, no further small examinations; they perish by great removal, die young, not reaching three lifespans, sins compounded, added torment of knife mountains and fiery pits, dying as lower ghosts, suffering long pain. Can this be spoken of lightly? You who have received the true dharma, wishing to establish merit and heal, cultivate the three yuan energies, nourish the spirit and extend life, must seek bright masters, observe the dharma and precepts, avoid greed for wine and meat, avoid indulgence and disorderly pursuits. All faults, great or small, will be reported. Only morning and evening fasting and practice, accumulating merit and atoning, can you hope for celestial grace and halt examinations. Thus extend life, restore your calculations, renew beginnings, balance merit and fault, leaving no detail overlooked. You must clearly be cautious, cautious in cultivation, preserving long-lasting immortality.

### The Most High’s Instruction:

Daoists, sacrificial masters, men and women officials, if you wish to cultivate the Supreme Clarity Divine Elixir, and practice the three yuan female and male arts, darken the body in mountains and marshes, contemplate immortality and nurture aspiration, you must first receive the Five Precepts of Life Establishment. Then undergo seven trials and nine refinements, crushing nature, enduring weakness, being insulted without resentment or shame; not allowing external thoughts or evil hearts, quieting the spirit and focusing on unity; enduring hunger and cold, accepting insult without anger or falling; accumulating diligent merit widely, rescuing the urgent, saving lives, receiving the beginning of rebirth; eating simple bitter food, widely cultivating hidden virtue, not hoping for reward before Heaven repays merit; great merit and virtue deeply felt, enduring hardship, near and far, not lamenting oneself; widely spreading benefit, enduring twisted insults without harm—these are great wisdom and virtue. There are five virtues; without a dark heart and firm resolve, one cannot establish this practice. Therefore, there are five titles of virtue, extremely profound and weighty indeed.

---

### On the Wisdom of the Daoist Path:

Studying the Dao for many years, enduring ten setbacks and nine insults, filth and evil heaped upon you, still harboring the benevolence of patience and weakness—this is one wisdom.

Forcefully practicing broadly, loving inner and outer cultivation, guiding and nurturing the three yuan, preserving the five spirits unharmed, advancing without decline, complexion unwithering—this is constancy, the second wisdom.

Persisting without retreat, roaming the eight directions, one clear and one deep, one turbid and one floating, diligent in worldly work, without record or name, accumulating virtue endlessly, daring to call it labor—this is the third wisdom.

Concealing medicinal qi, containing virtue and nourishing nature, turning and turning for nine years, sometimes reaching twenty-four, sometimes thirty-two years, accumulating bitter effort and diligence, enduring twists and insults, pitying and not counting, calm and self-possessed, always without merit to record, yet still anxious—this is the fourth wisdom.

For Daoists without worldly merit, few teachers, submitting to diligent masters, yet encountering calamities, scattering and damaging the true, enduring ten setbacks and ten thousand patience, still harboring care and gentleness, not sharpening the tongue—this is the fifth wisdom.

---

### The Most High’s Instruction:

Ordinary people learning the Dao, guarding the heart with chastity and unity, practicing good deeds earnestly, yet never awakening, enduring seven trials and nine setbacks, with no anger or retreat, observing the five precepts, uniting with the five wisdoms, not violating precepts, not neglecting scriptures and teachings, quiet and peaceful, acting without striving, long stained by worldly dust, counting no twisted insults, encountering misfortune, knocking and begging for forgiveness, repeatedly suffering hardship, not angry, but rather bestowing kindness and self-fortune, distributing alms to people, always fearing loss of prior merit and diligence, fearing deep and heavy past conditions bringing harm—having such lofty virtue and great merit, it is not called labor. Pure and bitter elixir, all the more firm and steadfast, fearing falling into abyss, morning and evening alike. Such wisdom is truly profound and great. With virtue and conduct thus, one can establish the Dao path and practice. After five years, serene and desireless, one may take refuge in forest seclusion, entrust life to cliffs and wilds. You who seek the Dao and cultivate life, extend human lifespan, must first dwell in humble chambers, harmonize spirit and nurture aspiration, guide and train the three yuan, accumulate diligent focus, be spiritually moved by the numinous truth. If afflicted by disaster, do not seek argument, bear twisted insults and misfortune with joy, not seeing it as denial. Practice these five precepts, establish the five wisdoms of life, keep Dao practice pure and clean, accomplish great and lofty merit, never hoping for reward, but rather becoming even more brave, vigorous, and diligent, always surpassing previous attainments. When merit is accumulated, what is there not to obtain? What wish not fulfilled? What petition unheard? What aspiration unaccomplished?

---

### The Most High’s Instruction:

Immortals have nine grades, arts have thirty-six gates, and there are one hundred twenty forbidden dharma—all essential for extending life. Has anyone ever followed the rules, sought aspiration, endured hardship, and failed? The only trouble is that people lack diligence in study, lack focused thought on the Dao, hold no constant will, have no united mind or accord. How can the Dao be cultivated? They only hear morning offerings and evening prayers, lightly neglect the orthodox teachings, say there is no spiritual response, are often stingy, greedy, quarrelsome, indulging in wine and meat seats, lacking focused hardship on the mysterious origin, acting confusedly, their sins piled in the heavenly treasury, soul and mind closed and struck, judged harshly in hell, not yet receiving verdict. Therefore, one should deeply reflect and reform oneself, diligently practice virtue and focus, to seek the effect of true clarity. Wise people hear and act, carefully observe the five precepts—is this not marvelous?

### On the Small Fasting Method

The host offers one virtuous person one hundred coins daily, with rice, vegetables, tea, fruit, honey, and ginger.

The middle fasting offers a thousand meals; one person daily contributes two hundred coins, with rice, vegetables, incense, flowers, lamps, candles, tea, fruit, honey, and ginger.

For these two, the number of people requesting fasting officials generally increases.

Also: For those in distress or illness requesting fasting, vegetable food follows the small fasting method.

The Spiritual Treasure’s Longevity Fasting offers a thousand meals according to the host’s supply, but killing life and violating rules is forbidden.

The Supreme Clarity’s scripture-turning, pure and quiet mountain forest long fasting, rice and vegetable food as constant, is not limited by money.

These five types correspond to grades and qualifications.

The Great Unity’s closed chamber, dwelling on elixirs for one hundred days, great fasting method, is not limited by money. In ancient times, oaths and pledges were made with gold and colors; today, they are replaced by forty feet of cinnabar painting and a pair of golden rings.
