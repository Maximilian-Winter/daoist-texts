The Supreme Emperor spoke to the Perfected of the Four Extremes:  
“Now there are those who hold steadfast faith in the ultimate Dao, who cultivate and study without weariness. These are all those whose former lives have already accumulated virtue, born among the heavens above, where heavenly joys abound. Yet, having no means to advance their功 (merit), when their years are fulfilled, they descend to the mortal realm through the wheel of rebirth. Some vow to awaken and declare their intent, seeking birth in the human world to save beings and establish功 (merit), diligently practicing the upper道 (way). These are no ordinary folk.

Ordinary people neither perceive this nor are aware of themselves; those who are aware do not speak of it. Such persons cannot escape calamity or misfortune: their families decline, their bodies fall ill, disputes arise public and private, hidden dangers and manifest misfortunes befall them. Evil men and foul ghosts, venomous beasts, birds, insects, and the elements of metal, wood, water, fire, earth, and grass all bring obstruction. This is because功德 (virtue and功) are incomplete, and their reception of the法 (method) is unprepared.

Urgently, one must purify by fasting and self-examination, repent faults and petition for blessings, preserve精 (essence) with utmost care, hold fast to the One without forgetfulness, practice the three and five, and earnestly recall the Mysterious Master. The Mysterious Master, the Azure Youth Lord, commands all scriptures, treasured writings, and wondrous diagrams—all come from him.

Scholars seeking the Master but not finding him, seeking scriptures but not obtaining them, or gaining them but insufficiently, or sufficient but unclear, or clear but not practiced, or practiced but not long-lasting, or having many leaks and lapses, unable to remember or know, or remembering but soon forgetting—these are all disturbed by evil精 (essence) and tested by demons and ghosts.

Quickly select an auspicious day—the day of Dingmao—and ascend the mountain or enter the chamber. Purify and solemnly burn incense, open the petition to the Supreme, sincerely preserve the Azure Youth, fix the heart facing east, envision all the palaces of the directions, bow and worship, face the Golden Gate’s Prime Minister. In times of weakness, calamity, or hardship, perform the six customary bows. After bowing, knock the head and secretly declare your earnest intentions: public or private obstacles, or lapses of mind and memory. Speak according to your vow. Point directly to the urgent affliction; do not speak of trivial or delayed matters. If urgent and complete, write down the details carefully. After bowing, secretly read aloud. If unheard, then burn the writing and treat it likewise.

If your vigor is strong, you may perform twelve bows, twenty-four bows, thirty-six bows, seventy-two bows, one hundred and twenty bows, two hundred and forty bows, three hundred and sixty bows, seven hundred and twenty bows, or one thousand two hundred bows—all completed in one session, focusing the mind to increase goodness.

If still unable, from the hour of Yin to the hour of Chou—twelve hours—perform one hundred bows at the time. If able, two sessions at Yin and Shen, or Zi and Wu, are suitable. Usually, practice for sixty days or one hundred days; do not postpone to other days.

Comrades in practice should be three or five persons; do not gather too many to cause noise or leakage of the examination, which must not be revealed. Those who study the upper道 (way) must be meticulous and cautious in cultivating this法 (method). Only then, when transmitting the scripture as a master, will the right person be found, and the teaching entrusted without regret.

If a master transmits the scripture to the wrong person, or the person is right but the transmission is not according to法 (method), then within twelve cycles of ten days, calamities will gather. Quickly thank the Azure Youth, endure hardship with blessings, and also open the gratitude for grace.

After receiving the道 (way), if practiced according to法 (method), within ninety days no calamity or illness will occur. This indicates a new宿 (past life) with much善 (goodness), a person aligned with the immortals. Within one hundred and ninety-two days and three hundred and sixty days, public and private affairs will be peaceful and prosperous. This is the accumulation of福 (blessings) before and after, a person aligned with the true.

Within three cycles spanning four years and one thousand two hundred days,功德 (virtue and功) flourish, reverence arises in the hidden and manifest realms. This is the most diligent upper士 (practitioner), a person aligned with the spirits.

Then transmit widely, save the wise and bright, rescue the mundane and loving, establish功 with compassion, broadly aid without selfishness, and thus ascend to the ranks of the Supreme Sage, Spirit, and True Immortal Lord, attaining the positions of emperor, duke, and minister.

If after receiving the道 (way), within one hundred days there arise calamities and illnesses, this indicates a宿 (past life) with many sins, not a person aligned with the immortals. Quickly repent first, vow to reform your conduct, change the past and cultivate the future, rely on masters and friends to wash away regrets and bitterness, with sincere and earnest resolve, reverence and faith without doubt, surely gaining blessings.

Within one hundred and ninety-two days and three cycles, follow this standard, establish德 (virtue) and功 (merit), avoid dangers and calamities, be ever vigilant and trembling, always harbor shame and fear, ashamed of deep sins and lacking great功, do not become a master, and be cautious in transmission.

As德業 (virtue and deeds) gradually rise over five thousand eight hundred and forty years, then select people to entrust and teach.

If calamities arise forcibly, and one meets a master by chance, both err—this is an evil cause and condition.

Among the earnest, those who do not fast or observe the度 (precepts), the master will have signs of binding and will pray for them, begging for grace with utmost sincerity and earnestness. Do not feign or act carelessly; the heart must not say one thing and the mouth another. Do not speak to others claiming功德 (virtue and功), only keep it pure and secret, so both sides gain blessings. Those who study the upper道 (way) clearly understand and follow this.

All life and death not yet ended arise from unremoved roots of sin. Moving between陰 (yin) and陽 (yang), activity and stillness, excess leads to death. Death’s suffering is grievous and feared by the upper士 (practitioner). Diligently study to seek life, receive scriptures and observe戒 (precepts), use techniques to ward off calamities, resolve sins and extend blessings, thus ascending to gods and immortals.

Beginners first repent and beg for grace, coming from the beginningless past, countless ancestors, and in this life seven generations of parents, where善惡 (good and evil) are intertwined. If seven generations have attained the道 (way) or are wise and talented,功德 (virtue and功) manifest in hidden and manifest realms, blessings accumulate, sins are easily released. But stubborn, fierce, rebellious ones bring many calamities hard to remove.

From oneself from the beginningless past to the seven ancestors,陰陽 (yin and yang) faults and offenses, some light, some heavy. Heavy ones are hard to dispel; light ones are easy to remove. The easy are removed by observing戒 (precepts) and establishing功 (merit), soon feeling effects. The hard require diligent effort for many years, yet may not receive response.

Those without response tend to slacken and retreat, not realizing the deep source of their prior offenses, growing resentful that the gods show no efficacy. This increases evil conditions, sins not forgiven.

If one can be more diligent, vowing to die without slackening, surely good effects will arise, turning calamity into blessing.

Among these, ancestors and former lives with much功德 (virtue and功) now add cultivation of善 (goodness), hastening their results.

Those unclear say their善 (goodness) is insufficient to be called attainment, or say they have attained the道 (way) falsely, or say it is illusion, or say it is natural and not learned. Such people cannot be taught, forever losing the缘 (connection) to the道 (way), becoming a band of demons, endlessly caught in生死 (life and death), deeply lamentable.

The wise, clear, and penetrating, talented and steadfast believers have no such doubts. Diligent in practice, small difficulties and setbacks, gradually accumulating over time, all can attain the道 (way).

To attain the道 (way) and long life, one must do善 (goodness), stop恶 (evil), have a firm heart and resolute will, strictly observe戒 (precepts), never allow the three尊 (Three Honored Ones) to be incomplete, never send away the five德 (Five Virtues), silently recognize and secretly act, never forget to speak.

善恶 (good and evil) may not always be practiced;善 (goodness) need not be public, for public suspicion breeds slander and jealousy brings calamity.

Therefore, the highest sages do善 (goodness) without replacement, knowing善 (goodness) as善 (goodness), this is not善 (goodness). Those who know善 (goodness) do not boast, do not insist on themselves, do not plan or scheme, do not consider it善 (goodness), but remain tranquil as if without—this is to attain the道 (way).

Those not of the same mind must not speak recklessly. What can be transformed should be transformed; not for others to force. The easy path is ninety-two cycles; the hard path two hundred forty-six cycles; at the utmost five thousand eight hundred years, none fail to attain the道 (way).

Those who do not attain the道 (way) all fail because they receive法 (method) but do not practice; practice but not diligently; diligence but not purely; committing sins in between; mixing善恶 (good and evil);功 (merit) not redeeming faults;德 (virtue) not repairing errors. After death, they become善缘 (good缘) among ghosts, awakening in the hidden to establish德 (virtue), becoming鬼官 (ghost officials), accumulating功 (merit) to ascend as仙 (immortals), or becoming灵人 (numinous beings), or turning the wheel as noble families of道德 (Daoist virtue), all without worldly toil—only unable to attain the道 (way) in this very body.

If one betrays and slanders, first is the end, not the beginning; death follows the evil party, severing缘 (connection) to善 (goodness).善缘 (good缘) does not sever because of faith and direction. Though faith and direction cannot reach the goal, they prevent doubt, confusion, and retreat, so善缘 (good缘) grows daily without cease, surely becoming true.

Perfected persons live four hundred years, four thousand years, forty thousand years, even ten thousand kalpas. Each transmission has its own formula and command. Beginners use ninety-two cycles as the limit;善恶 (good and evil) follow the standard; be careful not to offend recklessly.

Those who study the upper道 (way) must fix body and mind. If body and mind are not fixed, study achieves nothing. To accomplish study is to enter meditation; guarding the One is first. Subtle and difficult to practice, if guarding fails, the mind wanders and engages in other affairs.

If guarding fails to enter meditation, then carefully divine signs, examine self and things. If self is different or things change strangely, perceive and immediately correct. Use techniques and formulas to dispel and repel. After long absence of anomalies, then enter meditation, where myriad true forms gather.
