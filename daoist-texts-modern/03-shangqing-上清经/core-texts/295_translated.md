Transmission of the Great Azure Youth Lord

The Great Emperor Lord, the Most High Heavenly Emperor Lord, and the Great Subtle Heavenly Emperor Lord—these are the Three Honored Lords. Long ago, the Three Lords received the Primordial Elixir Scripture from the Most High Dao Lord. They practiced and cultivated the dao, perfected themselves, and thereby supplemented the truth of emperors and kings. On the day of ascending to the heavens, the Great Emperor Lord transmitted the true scripture to the Queen Mother of the West; the Most High Heavenly Emperor Lord passed the scripture to the Supreme Lord of the Southern Pole; the Great Subtle Heavenly Emperor Lord bestowed the true scripture upon the Sacred Lord of the Golden Palace. The Sacred Lord of the Golden Palace then transmitted the true scripture to the Prime Minister Azure Youth Lord, who in turn passed it to his disciple. This scripture is the Upper Chapter of the Pure Spirit. This dao is lofty and profound, not to be heard by the middling immortals. Unless one has the famous book with vermilion slips and green characters of the Supreme Ultimate, the Primordial Elixir Scripture will not be encountered or seen.  

Daoists who fully cultivate the Most High Three True Grade Scriptures attain the rank of supreme dukes and high ministers above emperors. Those who receive it partially or hear only limited dao attain the rank of kings of minor spiritual palaces, ministers of the divine realm, or mid-to-lower officials of the Supreme Ultimate—yet they too may ride dragons and clouds, soar on flights, command the spirit officials and guards, and scatter their shadows to the eight directions. The subtlety is profound and mysterious; it is difficult to lightly proclaim. The titles of the grade scriptures appear in the Most High Hidden Writings’ Eight Pure Chapters, which have the measure of looking up and down.  

When one is secluded, tranquil, and devoted to practice, the heart of diligence deepens beyond before. The perfected person thereby gradually acquires form and appearance. Unless you are this teacher, do not speak of it to others.  

Moreover, if you hear the sound of flutes and horns in your ear, it is an auspicious and noble omen; if you hear shouting and howling, it is an ominous and lowly sign; if you smell foul qi, there must be matters of disgust and filth, an omen of impurity, thus it is shown by foul qi. Immediately bathe, burn incense, and sweep your sleeping chamber to respond—this is the emperor lord’s admonition to warn people. If you smell fragrant qi, it means spirit officials and numinous beings are beside you, observing your condition. At such times, you should practice good deeds, cultivate virtue and kindness, rescue the poor and distressed, perform hidden merit, and bestow benevolence and love. The spirit officials and numinous beings will then report to the Most High about your goodness or faults. The subtlety of the dao must not be neglected; all are such omens. If you smell fragrant qi, unless you are this teacher, do not tell others. If you smell foul qi, you must be informed to reveal your own crimes and the formless pollution you have touched.  

If you hear blood qi or see blood gathering without cause, it is a sign of war and calamity. Quickly hide and flee to the human world, guard the Three Primordial Emperor Lords, seek instruction, and seclude yourself in fasting and purification for three months—disaster will also vanish. These are all the emperor lord’s warnings of good and ill, to make people fear and guard their fortune and calamity. When you see ominous signs, you must practice hidden rectitude, organize kindness, and rescue others in ways ordinary people cannot, and practitioners dare not. Only then can one escape the fate of certain death. You must strive diligently and not merely cling to the usual.

Above the space between the two eyebrows, moving upward: three fen (one fen is one-tenth of an inch) inward is the Guarding Inch Double Field; one fen inward is the Bright Hall Palace; two fen inward is the Cavern Chamber Palace; three fen inward is the Elixir Field Palace; four fen inward is the Flowing Pearl Palace; five fen inward is the Jade Emperor Palace. Anyone preserving and cultivating the highest methods first strikes the heavenly drum, places their hands over their ears, and utters the incantation:

“Within the palace dwells the infant; the nine truths reside in the chamber. Please heed the divine command, forever discern misfortune. The Great Unity’s flowing fire shall extinguish myriad calamities.”

When the incantation ends, strike the ear gate with the hand seventeen times. Then you should feel your face warm—this is a good sign. If you feel coldness in the head, nape, or neck, evil qi has entered. You must quickly lie down, close your eyes, and preserve the Primordial Elixir Palace’s Great Unity True Lord. Use the flowing fire’s bell to illuminate and cast out the evil qi, letting it exit the body. The firelight follows behind, shining brightly all around the body. After a while, calm returns.  

If suddenly you hear the sound of rushing water in your ear, or thunder and drumbeats, it means the body is fatigued and damaged; the heart’s storehouse is utterly exhausted and cannot taste the true life essence, leading to chaos and loss of control over the six internal organs. The soul and spirit wail—this portends disease and death. Thus, the method of the Mud Pellet is disrupted, the nine palaces lose their order, and sorrow and confusion overturn. The drums beat chaotically, and the spirit wishes to abandon its dwelling and forsake the body. Those who hear this must concentrate and recall the Great Unity True Lord, returning with a sincere heart. If the fault is not deep, one may hear and reform. This is why deafness arises: the ear’s spirit is lost.  

The ear is the emperor lord’s gate of hearing; the eye is the Great Unity’s sun and moon; the nose is the Three Primordial’s hill and mountain; the mouth is the Vermilion Palace’s Red Abyss; the eyebrows are the White Origin’s floral canopy; the hair is the Bright Hall’s forest essence; the tongue is the Dragon Shaft of No Shadow; the teeth are the power of the Stomach Palace; the hands are the gall spirit’s external aid; the feet are the kidney origin’s spiritual pass; the yin pole is the true mechanism of the Cavern Chamber. Each bone and hundred spirits has its own domain—none must be neglected or treated lightly.  

If suddenly you hear the sound of gold and jade, true qi is entering, and the dao wishes to be fulfilled. If you hear the sound of stringed music, the Six Ding and Jade Maidens come to guard you—these all mean the dao is about to be realized.

Above the space between the two eyebrows, wrapped within are the Yellow Gate, Purple Door, Vermilion Terrace, and Azure Chamber, which together stand guard in the middle of the Guarding Inch on the left and right ears. On the left side of the Guarding Inch’s face is the Vermilion Terrace; on the right is the Yellow Gate. The nine palace perfected persons enter and exit between the Yellow Gate and Vermilion Terrace, guided by the dao, hence the platforms stand on both sides. The platforms watch for unusual qi and welcome the coming and going of perfected persons.  

The Purple Door’s great god is named Peaceful Stillness, styled Dharma King. The Azure Chamber’s great god is named Upright Heart, styled First Origin. Both appear as infants, each wearing garments colored like their respective chambers and holding flowing golden fire bells. The Guarding Inch is three fen inward and is named for guarding the inch. At dawn and dusk, when lying down or in meditation, first preserve the two great gods, faintly envisioning them, and call their divine names thrice. Then softly bless:

“Purple Door and Azure Chamber, two great gods, hands holding flowing bells, bodies born of wind and cloud, chivalrously guarding the true dao. Do not heed outside matters; let my thoughts sense and connect, open the spiritual passes, freely enter and exit, ascend the nine gates, and behold the nine truths, the Most High’s honor.”

After the incantation, you may preserve the thoughts of the Three-One Cavern Chamber and the nine essential daos. The two gods of the Guarding Inch only listen to the true officials within the nine palaces. Those inside the nine palaces are the trusted emissaries of the Supreme Emperor, the Jade Youth Spirit Truths, the worthy sages and immortals, and the various imperial chariots coming and going. The two gods only permit these to enter; all others are not heard and are barred from entering the inner palace. This is the Yellow Great Unity method.  

Then the Infant Emperor Lord commands the two ear goddesses, Cloud Ceremony, to guide the entrance. Thus, when one feels ear ringing, it is an external envoy. They have likes and dislikes; Cloud Ceremony strikes the chime bell to sound the nine palaces, signaling the arrival of an external envoy and alerting the guard. The chime bell’s sound causes the ear ringing. Those who hear it place their hands over their ears and recite:

“Within the palace dwells the infant; the nine truths reside in the chamber. Please heed the divine command, forever discern misfortune.”

Within the Elixir Field is the Supreme Origin True One Emperor Lord and his ministers—three in total—who govern the Elixir Field Palace, guarding the Three Primordial True One Dao. This place is the essence of truth, the scripture of riding the dragon chariot. The Heavenly Venerable often delights in being a terrestrial perfected person, who hides away from official posts, avoiding court banquets and weariness. Thus, they are at ease, roaming freely with the times, sitting above seven wheels, stepping one breath upon the Great Nothing. Though the heavenly and earthly perfected persons differ slightly in rank, they share one truth. People each abide where they belong, unwilling to return as officials in the clouds.

The Primordial Elixir Palace lies above the Elixir Field, a perfect square one fen wide, with a purple chamber and green room filled with vermilion smoke. Within sits the Mud Pellet Great Unity True Lord, governing the Primordial Elixir Palace. The Great Unity True Lord appears as a newborn infant, seated on a golden bed beneath a jade canopy, wearing purple embroidered brocade robes and a belt with a flowing fire bell. The flowing fire bell is formless yet glows red; when moved, its sound carries for ten thousand li. It is the treasured bell of the Yellow Great Unity Perfected Person of the Upper Purity. In the left hand he holds the handle of the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper; in the right hand, the tether of the North Star. The North Star is the immovable star of the North Pole, called the tether. Sitting upright in the Primordial Elixir Palace, he faces outward, with no attendants on left or right. The absence of attendants is why he is named the Great Unity True Lord. He constantly guards the Three-One from dawn to dusk, alone in the rear is the unmanifested. The unmanifested first creates its lightness, then moves its heaviness.  

A person’s head contains nine palaces, which we now explain. Above the space between the eyebrows lies the Yellow Gate, preserved and called so. After calling the Three Lords’ names thrice, strike the heavenly drum twenty-four times; a thousand demons submit, ten thousand evil spirits vanish. If a daoist is hungry or thirsty, preserve the Three Lords, and with the mouth emit red qi to pour into one’s own mouth; inhale and swallow, and soon be full. If a daoist travels by night and cannot see the road, preserve the Three Lords, and with the mouth emit three fiery lights to illuminate ahead; soon the road becomes clear. If one is in a place of danger or calamity, amid knives and weapons, quickly preserve them, make the Three Lords ring the jade bell, concentrate and think; enemies naturally become terrified and no longer harbor evil or rebellious intent.  

If a daoist wishes to seek longevity, immortality, or rescue from illness and distress, rest the mind and settle to sleep, deeply think of the Three Lords of the Bright Hall, and kneel facing outward. With the mouth emit red qi, letting the light permeate the body and circle the mouth’s edge. Swallow the red qi in great abundance. Close the eyes and gently swallow; soon the red qi encircles the body and transforms into fire. The fire burns the body, making body and fire one. Inside and outside shine through; after a while it stops. This is called refining the form by sun and moon, dying and being reborn. Practiced regularly at dawn and dusk, one will surely live long and not die. Often swallow red qi thirty times upon rising, wiping the face and rubbing the eyes with the hand as routine, preserving the saliva’s color as red nectar.

Within the Cavern Chamber dwell the Three True Lords: on the left is the Duke of No Shadow, on the right the Lord of White Origin, and in the center the Lord Huang Lao. These three True Lords jointly govern the Cavern Chamber. This is the dao of the flying truth, with its own scripture. Within the Elixir Field dwells the Supreme Origin True One Emperor Lord. The Mud Pellet Heavenly Emperor Three-One is the spiritual ancestor of the body, the root of all spirits’ life, the mountain source of fluids, the jade chamber of soul essence. Thus, the stomach pool receives substances, the brain chamber is round and empty yet perfectly true; ten thousand hairs stand erect, a thousand pores emit smoke. Virtue completes the heavenly virtue, blending with the Great Mystery, the original nine spirits. Hence it is named the Upper Mansion of the Mud Pellet. The Upper Mansion of the Mud Pellet is the highest deity of the body’s form in the Great Dao.  

Most only know to swallow qi and saliva, ring the heavenly drum, and take in fluids, but do not know whence these arise—they are the foam of the Mud Pellet’s flow, the brain’s peripheral branches. Now I will reveal to you the secret of guarding the one, following the twelve hours. The spirits all have surnames, given names, hometowns, chambers, palaces, garments, and colors. If you wish to harmonize the elixir, all medicines must be combined with this spirit’s form and color.  

The male spirit is nine cun nine fen tall, wearing five-colored dark yellow pure spirit ribbons, head crowned with seven treasures of cinnabar and jade, wearing the crown of Infinite Advancement, dwelling in the supreme Supreme Ultimate Vermilion Palace, the mansion of seven treasures, the five spirit township, the mysterious origin neighborhood. His surname is Lian, given name Xian, styled Huangyan.  

The female spirit is six cun six fen tall, wearing blue treasure divine light brocade frost gauze ribbons of nine colors, head crowned with dark yellow advancement crown, dwelling in the supreme Kunlun Great Hidden Palace, the Bright Hall spirit mansion, nine light township, Great Transformation neighborhood. Her surname is Hui, styled Biyu.  

Those who see these two are all great immortals, the parents of the spirit elixir. Before the original qi is established, before the five administrations open, before light and shadow communicate, before infinite and boundless, without above or below, outside or inside, left or right, front or back—the Most High’s ancestors, the parents of original qi, the utmost subtle origin, the extreme void before existence, the origin of all things, Heaven and Earth’s longevity. Some dwell among humans, their lifespan the longest. Those who can preserve thought live a thousand years without aging, also dwelling among the Nine Heavens, receiving the original transmissions of myriad spirits.  

Those who wish to combine medicines, all medicines must be combined thus, first fasting, abstaining, and purifying. When the medicine is complete, it will be efficacious. It is called the Primordial Elixir, thus it must be combined with the pure elixir water of a virgin maiden. The combination must be made in solitude with the maiden. For three days and three nights, a yellow altar may be established.  

In the East is the Azure Dragon controlling the Wood Spirit talisman, written in blue; in the South the Vermilion Bird controlling the Fire Spirit talisman, written in red; in the West the White Tiger controlling the Metal Spirit talisman, written in white; in the North the Dark Warrior controlling the Water Spirit talisman, written in black; in the Center the Yellow Dragon controlling the Earth Spirit talisman, written in yellow. The five colors stand together in form and image, then the medicine is combined. The spirit sands and herbal essences may all be combined to form the elixir.  

The knife and jade tablet enter the mouth, ascending to Heaven by day. When combining medicine, be careful not to enter impurity or filth; failure to combine medicine properly leads to loss of life. The secret formula says: the method of combining medicine must know the origin of the Nine Heavens and the establishment of the Nine Earths, all emphasizing the order of knowledge.  

It is named the Supreme Purity Heaven, the upper mansion above the Nine Heavens, the first grandson. Its qi is clear and pure, the supreme’s dwelling. The Clear Subtle Heaven is the upper one’s palace, the second grandson. Its qi is subtle and marvelous, governed by the next honored. The Great Red Heaven is the northern first upper palace, the third grandson. Its qi is vermilion cinnabar, governed by the Sun Lord. The Great Azure Heaven is the mysterious origin’s mansion, the fourth grandson. Its qi is profound and distant, governed by the Void Lord. The Great Dark Blue Heaven is the northern capital official’s palace, the fifth grandson. Its qi is mysterious and subtle, governed by the Infinite Lord. The Supreme Mysterious Heaven is the northern first palace, the sixth grandson. Its qi is profound and silent, governed by the Great Dao Lord. The Great White Heaven is the capital mansion of the Seven Administrations, the seventh grandson. Its qi is vast and all-encompassing, governed by the Most High Old Lord. The Supreme Mysterious Capital Heaven is the northern peaceful upper palace, the eighth grandson. Its qi is clear and orderly, governed by the Dao Virtue Lord. The Supreme Bright Heaven is the palace of the Yang Immortal and Myriad Beginnings, the ninth grandson. Its qi is clear and bright, governed by the Supreme Clear Lord.  

Thus, the Nine Heavens are all clear, the Nine Earths all established, all things prosper, yin and yang, sun and moon, four seasons, and Five Phases. The one qi in Heaven makes Heaven pure; the one qi descending to Earth makes all things grow. Wherever the one resides, all is clear and bright. Heaven values the dao, humans value treasure. Heaven has the dao and does not lavish it; humans have treasure and do not speak falsely. Thus, Heaven is weighty, humans light. From the Great Beginning and Great Origin, the one is profound and subtle, the ancestor of myriad wonders.  

Thus, the Lesser Yang Floral Canopy Vermilion Palace, the Great Unity Yellow Court Mansion, the Great Red Vermilion Palace, the Golden Palace Jade Chamber, the Hidden Pass beside the Chivalrous, the Jade Gate first rising, the Jade Stem first born, Kunlun Mountain atop the Jade Palace’s summit, reaching nineteen thousand li above—within it is profound subtlety, five-colored lapis lazuli, above is the Great Unity, below the Vermilion Palace, which can appear and vanish. The original qi is born and all is contained. The dao’s virtue is one, thus it is weighty.  

Humans are born on Earth, with original qi from the beginning. Without Earth’s birth order, the Earth’s essence would not dare harm humans. The first Earth is named Original Virtue, its qi blue above and yellow in the middle, governed by the Original Earth Official, thick eleven thousand one hundred and ten li, governed by the Earth officials. The second Earth is Imperial Virtue, connected to black, governed by the Original Court Earth Lieutenant, also thick eleven thousand one hundred and ten li, governed by Earth officials. The third Earth is Emperor Virtue, connected to azure, governed by the Tiger Mouth Earth Dragon, also thick eleven thousand one hundred and ten li, governed by Earth officials. The fourth Earth is King Virtue, connected to yellow, governed by the Original Heart Earth General, also thick as above. The fifth Earth is Original Virtue, connected to red, governed by the Original Fortune Earth Official, also thick as above. The sixth Earth is Earth Virtue, connected to white, governed by the Original Bone Earth One, also thick as above. The seventh Earth is Village Virtue, connected to purple, governed by the Early Parents of Earth, also thick as above. The eighth Earth is Return Virtue, connected to blue, governed by the Early Worthy Earth Patriarch, also thick as above. The ninth Earth is Prosperous Virtue, connected to green, governed by the Xuan Beginning Upper and Lower Two Thousand Stone, also thick as above. Its qi numbers arise from the Great Cold Township’s drowning waters.  

For a daoist who can understand these two volumes, they commune with Heaven and Earth’s spirits. Those who later encounter and practice without undergoing the Nine Heavens, Nine Earths, and Nine Waters’ tests, without passing the Cold Hill and enduring cold, become among the clear and bright six laws of Heaven’s myriad beings.  

If a daoist does not follow the teaching’s essence, they enter the Yellow Springs, examined and punished in the underworld, must go to the Cold Hill. Though ghosts, their forms are poisonous, suffering intense pain and decay, unbearable to become ghost servants. They speak false words as truth, and when born as men or women, their lifespan is cut short by violent death. Moreover, the *Female Azure Ghost Law* and the eight volumes of edicts cause ghosts to submit.  

These two chapters of Pure Spirit must not be mixed with others unless one has the famous book with vermilion slips. One must have the full body’s chambers and mansions, spirit rooms, one hundred and eighty palaces, three hundred and sixty joints, twelve hundred pores, twelve thousand essence lights, thirty-six thousand spirit lords, the supreme’s dwelling, the mysterious saint’s place, three souls and seven spirits, twelve shapes and shadows, myriad sounds responding.  

Thus, the numbers of yin and yang, the Three Primordials’ calculations, the head is the Heavenly Origin, the heart the Middle Origin, the kidney the Lower Origin, all governed by the thirty-six thousand spirit lords, named the Three Primordial Subtlety, divided left and right. Thus it is said: left is blue, right is white, front is red, back is black, center is true yellow. The six laws arise, governed by twenty-four qi, each with its division. The chief and deputy officials number thirty-six thousand. Change is infinite; temporary disappearance is not death but transformation.  

Thus, myriad spirits are established in myriad things, combining forces and accumulating. When gathered, they form human qi; when dispersed, spirits scatter, and the body cannot move. Its true form thus hides itself. Common people grow old but do not know this principle, thinking death is final, weeping and wailing. This is no different from a hundred insects shedding skin on the first day of the Beginning of Winter, their forms returning to earth. At the middle of spring, the awakening of insects causes them to emerge again, unaware where they shed their skin before, like newborn infants.  

I often see you briefly emerge in the world, not learning the immortal dao, not combining the divine medicine, but only committing sins and suffering punishment. Then you return to your descendants’ bodies, borrowing forms and emerging—how ignorant this is! If you have faults and crimes, cultivate merit to atone, to expiate past offenses and taboos. Thus it is said: ancestors’ good deeds bring blessings to descendants; evil deeds bring sins to later generations. This is all the punishment of the underworld not yet complete, which must be repaid in the world again. It is not one’s own evil deeds obtained. Be cautious in speech; the examiner guards you daily. The mouth is Heaven’s gate; do not spread recklessly. If passed to the wrong person, fifty counts are lost.

The Bright Section Method: On the day of Gengshen (the 57th day of the sexagenary cycle), this day is when the six souls’ ghosts ascend to the Heavenly Mansion and return to the human body. On this day, sit facing east, do not sleep or lie down, and recite:

“The five viscera’s spirits, in their palaces, think together as law. If any leak, suppress them; if the head leaks, suppress it; if the feet leak, suppress them—all by the master’s command.”

The art of thinking of the viscera: my body’s left three souls are in my liver; the right seven spirits are in my lungs; one hundred and twenty shapes and shadows, twelve thousand essence lights, enter from my mouth’s heavenly bridge, ascend Kunlun Mountain, Fanyang County, the land of non-action. The Vermilion Bird leads in front holding banners and flags; the Dark Warrior follows behind bearing drums and bells; the Azure Dragon attends on the left; the White Tiger on the right; the central Yellow Spirit holds the battle axe. Thousands of ghosts and myriad spirits all submit without rising. Ahead is a cauldron of ten thousand stones of boiling water; behind are reversed scales and armor. Lord, please dispel disasters and scatter calamities. I have passed the Three Bonds and Six Chronicles; cut off ghosts swiftly as law commands.

As a daoist, you must observe your body’s light and color to know if the body is weak and qi declining, struck by the six ugly evil ghosts. At midday, close yourself in a dark room and look inward for a long time. If you see bright and shining colors, your body is strong and your year is robust. Plug your ears and listen; if you hear sounds of metal and stone, or the five-tone music of flutes and bells, these are good omens. If you see faint colors and hear wailing and crying, these are ominous signs. You must calm the spirit and preserve the True One Lord to return and govern the palaces, chanting:

“My form and myriad spirits, secure my palaces, guard my jade hall, do not roam. Chivalrous gatekeepers and mighty warriors, central youths, if any unusual entry or exit occurs, capture and hand over to the city authorities, strike the head and cover, forbid movement, swiftly as law commands.”

If you see your essence light faint and thin, at sunrise or moonrise, face east and lean calmly, recite:

“Warmly flowing, warmly flowing, essence light bright, swallow qi, eat shadow, enter my form, support my body, summon spirits, true qi returns, banish evil spirits, grant me long life and ten thousand years, swiftly as law commands.”

Swallow nine times and stop.  

If suddenly your body feels faint, your heart grieves and thinks as if recalling something without specification, your heart is unsettled and cannot calm itself—this means the spirit in your body wishes to leave, longing for the palaces. The three souls have departed, the seven spirits fly away, only the fixed form remains, mingling with evil. In dreams, you meet women or men and communicate, causing spirit leakage—these are signs of death. If such signs appear, you must reform yourself, seek a daoist priest to offer a memorial, kneel and plead with sorrow, establish subtle merit, and open your heart’s will. From now on, follow the times to cultivate, bow to the Four Honored, perform the Three Five Seven Nine, Two Four Six Eight, Eight Winds, Twelve Thunders, Twenty-Four Rains, Three Hundred and Sixty Lightnings, Nine Palaces, and Eight Trigrams. Do not hold truth to falsehood or act improperly, lest the examiners report you and the Three Officials cannot pardon you after death.  

The Vermilion Bird faces south, its talisman also faces south; the White Tiger faces south, its talisman faces west; the Dark Warrior faces south, its talisman faces north; the central Yellow Dragon faces south, its talisman faces east; the Azure Dragon faces south, its talisman faces east. All talismans are carved on peach wood.

### The Three Grades of the Most High Nine Truths Bright Section of the Cavern of Truth

The Most High commands the heavenly emperors, later holy emperor lords, Prime Minister Azure Youth, and Supreme Ultimate Perfected Person: All later disciples who see the supreme true three cavern treasure chapters and secret scripture titles, all are named East Flower Books, golden characters of Upper Purity. Though not yet soaring to control the Purple Court, they are all persons of transcendence. Yet though seeing these texts, if one does not know the *Nine Truths Bright Section*’s rules, the three cavern wondrous texts, and the Most True treasure scriptures, one may not simply open them. The Bright Section’s treasures are hidden in the Palace of the Mysterious Capital, within the Golden Capital’s Golden Chamber, not transmitted to the world. This is the deep source of the Three Caverns, the measure of the myriad true ones, the standard of the star lodgings facing the hidden palace, crossing the seven mysteries in the immortal registers, the totality of karma in myriad daos, resolving the heavy burden of the nine yins. Its subtlety is attainable and practical; using its rules one can be solemn and strict. Now I select the Three Grade titles to assist in promoting the Three Marvelous Pure Spirit Wonderful Scriptures, to admonish later disciples to be diligent and cautious with the precious rules.

The heavenly emperors, later holy nine mysterious emperor lords, Prime Minister Azure Youth, Supreme Ultimate True Youth, and Supreme Ultimate Perfected Person kowtow and dare to ask the Most High Heavenly Venerable: The supreme true highest methods are lofty, subtle, pure, vast, and clear, spreading to myriad lineages, profound, silent, and condensed, wondrous and inspiring, laws transforming the three vehicles, lost in countless kalpas. How can one bear it? Is it still necessary to inquire about the Bright Section?

The Most High replied: Good child’s words. Later disciples, unless naturally born from the clear essence of the Jade Void, are all conceived in the mixed qi, stained and bound by vulgar filth. Their constitution is impure, their nature not focused. Though they aspire to the profound, their hearts often turn away. Their conduct and vehicles all violate excess. Excess arises outside, extinguishing life within. Learning thus, how can they not stray far from truth? If the Three Officials enforce blame, summon the underworld office, examine the seven ancestors, and punish the body for faults, those who err will awaken to the mysterious rules and corrections. The great saintly transformation again permits methods of atonement. By following the rules and applying them, true realization will surely approach. Without this inspection, a scholar’s diligent thought is vain and of no benefit to bitter contemplation. Therefore, I now issue the Nine Truths Three Grade Bright Section, which may be granted to later disciples who should be perfected persons.

The Emperor Lords, Prime Minister Azure Youth, and Supreme Ultimate Perfected Person then withdrew, purified themselves at the Upper Purity, and received the *Pure Spirit Great Marvelous Scripture Nine Truths Bright Section*, hidden in the Golden Treasury and Jade Chest, guarded by Jade Youth and Jade Maiden, each three thousand in number, attending the spirit texts, scattering incense in the empty court, flying dragons and poisonous beasts, giant dragons a thousand zhang tall, claws raised against the cloud wall, fully guarding the Jade Gate. Thus, ten heavenly great saints and nine palace true immortals thrice a month ascend the mysterious palace to receive the Bright Section, bowing and worshipping the spirit texts. Prime Minister Azure Youth said: Whoever has a golden bone and jade body, named participant of the Azure Palace, obtains this text secretly and practices it. Thus receiving the ritual, mysteriously harmonizing the upper canon, applying and regulating, working with the true, redeeming sins and removing difficulties, resolving past ties, the seven mysterious ancestors rejoice, their bodies ascend and feast in the Jade Palace.

### The Supreme Grade Transmission Scripture of the Mysterious Capital Nine Truths Bright Section

The Supreme Grade First Chapter of the Mysterious Capital says: *Great Cavern True Scripture*, *Female One Treasure Scripture*, *Most High Pure Spirit Great Marvelous Scripture*—these are the three marvelous chapters, the supreme jade emperor’s treasure chapters, secret in the Palace of Great Plenty above the Nine Heavens, within the Great Mysterious Spirit Platform’s Jade Chamber. The sovereign’s ancient ritual, transmitted once every myriad kalpas, the three daos rightly clarified, the study of truth daily flourishing. The highest proper ritual is transmitted thrice within seven thousand years. Guarded by Jade Youth and Jade Maiden, each seven thousand in number, holding incense and spirit texts. According to ritual transmission methods, all must report fasting for one hundred days, divide golden buttons as oaths, give to Jade Youth and Jade Maiden, following the Four Extremes ritual. Those who transmit without following ritual incur the punishment of seven ancestors, their souls conscripted to the underworld, swallowing fire and eating iron, bearing mountain burdens and moving stones to fill the source of the Infinite, their bodies embraced by the wind blade’s punishment, long confined in hell, never to become immortals.

The Supreme Grade Second Chapter says: To transmit the *Great Cavern True Scripture*’s thirty-nine chapters to later disciples, one must swear with ten taels of gold, twenty-five jin of copper, five pairs of golden buttons, one golden fish and one jade dragon each, one tael of blue silk, twisted buttons as oaths. For *Female One*, swear with five taels of gold, fifty feet each of five-colored brocade, one jin of incense, three pairs of golden buttons. For the *Most High Pure Spirit Cavern True Mysterious Scripture*, swear with two taels of gold, one hundred feet of purple script, twenty-seven feet of blue brocade, five taels of red silk, one jin of incense, one tael of cinnabar. The sovereign swears faithfully, no omissions allowed; omissions break the ritual. If the master errs, they are demoted to Jade Youth and Jade Maiden and returned to their original palace. Within three years, they suffer the wind blade’s torture and naturally lose the scripture. Those who receive but do not follow the Bright Section lose form and spirit, the seven ancestors and parents bear the northern Feng’s punishment, endlessly reborn on the non-human path. Learners beware.

The Supreme Grade Third Chapter says: All with golden names East Flower, jade characters Upper Purity, who receive *Great Dawn Lapis Script Jade Text Emperor Chapter*, *Purple Crossing Flame Light Mysterious True Transformation Scripture*, *Upper Purity Transformations Seventy-Four Directions*, *Nine Truths Middle Scripture*, *Elixir View Dao Essence Hidden Earth Eight Arts*, *Form Release Transformation Flowing Scene Jade Scripture*, *Seven Transformations Dance Heaven*, all are the Nine Heavens True Kings, Primordial Heavenly King, Most High Heavenly Emperor Lord, Central Yellow Old Lord, received within the Great Void, inside the Nine Mysteries, the high chapter of emptiness and nothingness. All are secret in the Great Supreme Spirit Capital’s palace, within the Purple Chamber, under the Three Primordial Lords’ governance, guarded by Jade Youth and Jade Maiden, each three thousand in number. Since the beginning of Primordial, transmitted once every seven thousand kalpas. After the Three Heavens’ establishment, transmitted thrice within seven years, once within seven hundred years. Transmission requires fasting for ninety, thirty, or nine days, oath taking, and giving to Jade Youth and Jade Maiden, following the Four Extremes Bright Section.

The Most High marks their texts within the ancient scriptures for practical use. Transmission and oath taking all follow scripture rules; omissions carry the same punishments as the supreme grade. Scriptures without talismans allow heavenly demons to harm people; talismans without scriptures cause thoughts to lack response and spirit truths not to descend. The rules say: none may be practiced alone; doing so incurs the same punishments. Scriptures and talismans both arise from natural qi, the chapter of emptiness and nothingness, thus cannot be practiced independently. Without ritual, dao cannot be accomplished.

### Middle Grade Admonition of the Nine Truths of the Mysterious Capital

The Middle Grade First Chapter says: Later disciples who have committed killing, robbery, assault, plotting adultery, rebellion, nine clans intermingling, treason and lawlessness, their examination is especially severe. Grievances and blame arrest them, accumulating the nine yins; no pardon is possible. Later disciples must not contaminate the true scripture with their residual calamity or steal the treasured text. If one has a bitter will and strives to improve, first thank the seven mysteries, redouble merit, extract the underworld soul, expose oneself under the three lights, loosen hair and kowtow, three years without weariness, then bring heavy trust to the Nine Rivers, redeem past faults, then receive the pure fasting for one hundred days and accept the treasured scripture, then act accordingly. Those with such sins who do not first punish themselves and spit out the heavenly treasure before receiving the law, both master and disciple suffer wind blade torture, seven mysteries ancestors long closed in the underworld, bearing stone burdens and mountain weights, never released through myriad kalpas, bodies lost and scriptures lost. Be very cautious.

The Middle Grade Nine Truths Chapter says: The scripture titles transmitted in the Nine Truths Three Grades ritual are those first worn by the later holy emperor lords when receiving from the Most High Dao Lord. The Most High transmitted scriptures, issuing the Three Grade Bright Section to assist the Three Marvelous Treasure Texts, the supreme true dao scriptures. The ritual and application rules, their thirty-one volumes, independent matters, and many scriptures and rites are all within the *Four Extremes Bright Section*. The Nine Truths Three Grades place the upper chapters of the Three Pure in the Nine Emperor’s palace; the Four Extremes use the four officers to oversee all non-correction punishments and prohibitions. The Most True Bright Section is the Great Emperor Lord’s received mysterious chapter from the Primordial Heavenly King, the Heavenly King’s mysterious chapter, the supreme true ritual. Its method is secret in the Palace of the Nine Heavens above, the Emperor’s hall, hidden admonitions in the supreme true palace, not practiced in the world. The Nine Truths Bright Section forbids later disciples; the Four Extremes Bright Section governs the four directions. Its essence is subtle, without golden characters or jade names, unknown and unheard. Those who obtain this chapter need not study but naturally become perfected. The ritual forbids sins; seeing the ritual means knowing to reform. Knowing reform means no loss to Heaven and Earth; no loss to Heaven and Earth means conforming to nature; conforming to nature means attaining supreme supplementation and true immortality. Without ritual, learning will stray far from immortality.

The Middle Grade Nine Truths Chapter says: Whoever has utmost ambition, named participant of the Mysterious Palace, wishing to receive the Bright Section alone, must know the heavenly law prohibitions before receiving the scripture. If one has bones and constitution, one may first declare an oath and then be granted. The oath, faith, and ritual all follow the Three Marvelous Treasure Scriptures’ numbers and time limits. Know not to lightly disclose or entrust to unworthy persons. Revealing mysterious texts without following ritual causes death and descent to ghost officials, seven ancestors and parents tread the blade mountain and sword tree, never released through myriad kalpas. Outsiders who do not follow ritual incur the same punishments. Learners beware.

The Middle Grade Nine Truths Chapter says: Whoever receives the upper methods but does not accept the Bright Section, neglecting heavenly prohibitions, sins accumulate to seven ancestors, examined and arrested as one body. Once knowing to reform and beginning, punishments are self-imposed. If one returns to practice but again offends, the examination doubles the prior. This means bones and fate do not harmonize; form opposes truth; soul joins ghosts; all cannot restart or again practice the true scripture. Therefore, I issue the Bright Section to awaken the unenlightened. Those who know and yet offend, what use is there? Practitioners, be cautious.

### Hymn in Praise of the Great Emperor Lord

Dim and formless at the beginning, faint and scattered morning clouds.  
Great stillness, empty mystery above, vast and bright the two instruments divide.  
Condensing essence, embracing the mysterious embryo, forming transformation, nurturing the spiritual vision.  
Containing truth, nourishing spirit within, suddenly opening the dark dawn.  
Beginning to awaken, anxious for life, returning and crossing the heavenly river.  
Rustling steps through the void, circling to salute the Jade Emperor.  
Kowtowing to the Great Nothing, riding the wind to scatter fragrant spirits.  
Looking down and up at the emperor’s hall, drifting and soaring with the void.  
Marvelous chants emit wondrous sounds, reciting the Most True chapters.  
Flowing broadly through the four great realms, ten heavens measure without end.  
The Jade Terrace emits the hidden night, the divine candle breathes wondrous light.  
Brilliant jade forest blossoms, sparkling shining jade halls.  
Void born natural smoke, luxuriant and majestic governing the mysterious thread.  
All true ones spread praises to the heavens, treasure canopies rise with the wind.  
Flying steps chant empty songs, spirits sing the dao’s long transformation.  
Lush and great is the great transformation, splendid and thriving is the mysterious dao.  
Accumulating study with daily inspiration, merits complete entering the great vehicle.  
Blessings and fortune reach all, seven ancestors all ascend.  
Arranging the chariot to soar over Great Hua, turning reins to sever the sky pavilion.  
Spirit winds drum the empty caverns, incense flowers ride the smoke to scatter.  
Rustling salutes the empty hall, solemn steps tread the mysterious river.  
Clear chants move the hidden heart, rescuing the past root’s difficulty.  
Five sufferings timely resolved, fragrant flow pours and irrigates.  
Mysterious passes stand the cloud thread, flying rosy clouds wing the spirit chariot.  
Granting and guiding the trace-free truth, entering the vast emptiness.  
Riding the void reciting jade chapters, desolate chanting feathered writings.  
Broad thoughts without omission, all blessings are abundant.

The supreme dao is born in stillness, mysterious sounds seek each other.

Accumulating thoughts report spiritual response, promising to meet the jade truth.  
Dim and pure the heavenly river clears, drifting and floating the bright clouds return.  
The Three Truths soar into the void, controlling reins swiftly at Purple Tenuity.

### Recitation of the Later Holy Golden Palace Emperor Lord

Vast and boundless is Primordial Heaven, three images mixed into mystery one.  
Rustling the true dao arises, vast and great vehicle escapes.  
Six qi return to the proper court, all gather in the Mud Pellet chamber.  
Coming and going roaming the emperor’s palace, flowing essence shining clouds and sun.  
Circulating and returning the heavenly river, hidden and riding the mysterious seven.  
Round blossoms reflect bright pearls, two lights face the true radiance.  
Spirit glow opens the new meeting, mysterious images cross the eastern sunrise.  
Dark crossing seeks itself, yin flows bright in eight rays.  
If one can feast on this essence, long may one govern the mysterious thread.  
Playing in the nine mysterious terraces, resting in the western feathered nook.  
Divine beasts call in the jade hall, flying phoenixes mutually uneven.  
Void born natural chants, perfected persons sing harmony.  
Transforming body in the kalpa blade courtyard, following incense life’s clear song.  
Establishing merit, planting blessings’ fields, rescuing and crossing the body’s net.  
Seven mysteries scatter the hidden palace, departing without difficulty.  
Flying steps tread the sky ridge, soaring wings to the Eastern Flower Palace.  
Wind and cloud chant in the void, jade sounds scatter the jade hall.  
Perfected persons chant empty songs, wondrous sounds surpass cloud chambers.  
Freeing my natural heart, completing my accumulated kalpa merit.  
Long howling above the nine mysteries, clear gaze seeing the void as one.  
Dragon roars in the supreme mansion, phoenix cries in the great sky pavilion.  
Void chants without lingering taste, mournful sounds ride the wind to scatter.  
Who can fathom this chapter? Recite the Pure Spirit praise.  
To resolve nine yin faults, to rescue seven mysteries’ difficulty.

The Supreme Ultimate Perfected Person says: The *Most High Pure Spirit Cavern Primordial Wonderful Scripture* was born with Primordial. The spirit texts already exist, myriad truths come to the seat, burning incense and worshipping the scripture, circling and reciting these twenty-one chapters to celebrate in the spirit court. The jade sounds are clear and bright, penetrating the nine heavens. Its lines are subtle, wondrous and inspiring, chanting once awakens myriad spirits. Constantly able to master and practice, merging with the emperor to unite truth, resolving past burdens, rescuing seven mysteries in the hidden palace, releasing five sufferings in sorrowful souls, crossing the body to be born in the upper heavens. Marvelous and subtle indeed, this is the spirit text.
