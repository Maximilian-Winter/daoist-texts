### Scripture of the True Text of the Supreme Golden Chapter of the Cave-Truth Tiger Talisman

The True Talisman of the Golden Tiger on the Right, bestowed by the Heavenly Emperor of the Supreme Subtlety to the Golden Palace Emperor, inscribed in vermilion on white silk, enclosed in a purple brocade pouch, worn upon the head when traveling—by this means one commands the mandates of Heaven and Earth and the myriad spirits; the immortals revere and submit; the Jade Splendor holds the kerchief; the Heavenly Ding guard the body; the mountains and rivers bow their essences. Added are the solemn invocations of awe-inspiring spirits and the seals of jade essence, whereby one may behead the nine demons and annihilate a thousand fiends’ forms. This is the supreme Qing forbidden talisman, never transmitted to the world; those who wear it ascend swiftly to the Supreme Qing.

The Supreme Origin’s Highest Radiance Golden True Awe-Inspiring Spirit Inner Invocation summons and commands the divine warrior soldiers to behead and destroy evil souls. When entering a chamber, burn incense, click the teeth thirty-six times to open the passage, sit or lie at will, then recite the invocation:

“Repel the King of Dry Poison, shake the banner of the Thunder Picker, the Eight Immortals wield their halberds, the Five Spirits of the Supreme Emperor, the Supreme Mysterious Falling Radiance, the Seven Dawns guarding the courtyard, the Yellow True Shining Talisman, blazing and casting the fire bell, the Divine Tiger rouses its vigor, the poisonous blade runs rampant, the Purple Bo Wen ritual, four leaps resound upward, the Nine Heavens and Six Heavens, the Four Heavens crystal clear, the outer coils of mysterious qi, the inner guards of commanding troops, left is awe, right is vigilance, wind strikes, fire marches, commanding the beheading of ten thousand fiends, severing the heads of a thousand essences, the Golden True opens the thunder, the nine demons seize their forms, the Northern Feng shatters and falls, all destroyed are overturned. I wear the true talisman, commanding myriad spirits, the Three Origins report the truth, the mysterious unites with imperial sincerity, the Supreme Subtlety’s highest mandate, ascending to the Three Purities.”

The method of the Supreme Origin’s Highest Radiance Awe-Inspiring Spirit Inner Invocation is all from the Supreme Qing forbidden scriptures. The “Repel the King of Dry Poison” is the inner name of the great ghost of the Six Heavens. The “Shake the Banner of the Thunder Picker” is the hidden name of the Northern Emperor’s demon king. The “Four Heavens Crystal Clear” is the soul name of the Northern Feng ghost’s appearance. One who knows the names of the three ghosts will cause a thousand fiends to scatter and flee, ten thousand ghosts to hide their forms, the nine demons unable to stir or test, a hundred evils unable to manifest harm. Whether dwelling alone in the mountains and forests or among the gods and ghosts in temples and mansions, one may act according to this without burning incense or entering a chamber. Also, write it with orpiment on blue silk, three feet long and one foot two inches wide; it may also be square, one foot two inches on each side. Around the four edges, border it, and edge it with cinnabar brocade, then wear it on the right side of the waist. When ascending the fast or entering a chamber, or at morning and evening banquets on the eighth or ninth day, and when controlling demons and summoning spirits, driving and commanding divine truths, wear it and act accordingly. Be careful never to face corpses or filth; the crime is like leaking the secret, and the ancestor of the Seven Mysteries will punish you in hell.

### Supreme Divine Tiger Jade Scripture, Divine Tiger Inner True Talisman

The Divine Tiger True Talisman originates from the Parents of the Supreme Truth of the Nine Heavens; the Supreme Truth Elder transmitted it to the Eastern Sea Little Boy; the Nine Heavens True Kings passed it to the Supreme Dao Lord. The Supreme Dao Lord always treasures this secret, storing it in the Jade Chamber of the Spirit Capital of the Supreme Subtlety, guarded by colossal beasts and defended by poisonous dragons. Seven thousand Divine Tigers stand ready at the Golden Palace, accompanied by three hundred Golden Mornings, Jade Boys, White Spirit Jade Girls each, attending and guarding the spiritual script. The mysterious radiance fills the void, scattering smoke over the purple court, awe-inspiring throughout the nine distant realms, divine light dazzling the Supreme Qing, marvelously opening in accord with nature, penetrating grace through the formless. The Divine Tiger’s spotted image, the Golden Tiger’s true essence, wisdom marking its stem, dispelling demons and unfolding its source. Subtle commands and hidden phrases, wondrous and difficult to detail, all inscribed with the hidden names of heavenly demons or marked with the inner names of a hundred gods. Reciting its chapters startles a thousand essences; chanting its verses binds ten thousand fiends’ forms. At the founding of the Three Heavens’ governance, it was entrusted to the Heavenly Emperor of the Supreme Subtlety, to wield awe over the Six Heavens, behead ten thousand fiends, command mountains and summon seas, bind the myriad spirits, awe demons and destroy tests, and revolve the Five Stars.

Thus the Heavenly Emperor of the Supreme Subtlety received and accepted the two Golden Talismans of Demon-Destroying Wisdom and Spirit, wore them roaming the Supreme Qing, riding the void and soaring on the floating wheel of the Supreme Subtlety, clearing the radiance of the Supreme Truth’s hall, resting his feet on the Jade Emperor’s steps, quietly harmonizing with Heaven and Earth, moving in unison with the Seven Radiances’ brilliance, correcting the Nine Mysteries, grasping the pivot of spiritual mechanism, commanding myriad degrees, summing countless laws, stirring the hundred yang to generate lightning, turning the thousand yin to emit awe, divine mists envelop the Dao at the Golden Palace, the heavenly gate responds and opens by itself, commanding the Eight Radiances to ascend high, driving the Divine Tiger to soar and fly, the assembly of immortals opens the path, the Seven Stars rush and shift, mysterious light darkens and stagnates, myriad transformations and wondrous changes, penetrating the boundless realm of observation, surveying the extreme edges of the heavens, casting the gaze upon the five impurities, announcing the decline of birth and death—truly subtle and wondrous, the marvel of the spiritual north!

The Heavenly Emperor of the Supreme Subtlety instructed the Prime Minister Qing Tong and the Western City King: “The Supreme Qing Great Wisdom Scripture of Demon-Destroying True Text is the Jade Chapter of the Supreme Ultimate, the treasured secret of the Most High. The true poems of soul and spirit, the precious chapters of the Nine Heavens Supreme Truth. Wisdom can chase away filth, demon-destroying can bind evil, the true talisman can control demons. Those who possess the jade slip with purple inscription and cultivate the highest methods will not be ridden by myriad fiends nor tested by ten thousand demons. Truly, ten thousand harms cannot injure, ten thousand tests cannot affect—all by the might of the Divine Tiger, the marvelous use of the true scripture. Now I entrust it to you, to pass on to later learners who aspire to be true persons. They must follow the Supreme Truth’s regulations. Within seven hundred years, only three transmissions are allowed; it must not be shown to unworthy persons. To lightly reveal the true text is to suffer the punishment of the wind blade, the calamity extending to the Seven Mysteries. If there is one named East Flower in gold characters, or Supreme Qing in green script, who obtains this talisman from me, then with thirty-six Jade Boys and Jade Girls attending and guarding their person, they may pass through dangers and risks, cross mountains and seas, summon gods and command ghosts, seal and control spiritual peaks. Wherever they go, a thousand fiends crouch aside, ten thousand demons bind their forms, the assembly of immortals attend and guard, their bodies emit strange light. After cultivating for less than seven years, the true spirit will descend to their chamber, riding the flying chariot and green palanquin, ascending in the white sun’s morning. The recipient must fast and meditate for ninety days, or thirty days, or seventy days, all offering ten taels of supreme gold as proof of divine truth, ninety feet of brocade as oath to the Nine Heavens, thirty feet of blue silk as pledge of their heart. Those who love the dao and delight in truth, diligently focusing on the mysterious, not sparing wealth, valuing the dao above riches, the dao never lost—only such persons may be spoken to. Those who inwardly love wealth and outwardly are fickle, the dao will also abandon them. Seal it in a jade box, add the Golden Palace, and after ascending, deeply hide it in a famous mountain.”

Wear the Divine Tiger Supreme Talisman, with blue as earth and yellow inscriptions. If the Five Sacred Mountains lie amid calamity and the land of ghosts and demons, one must perform the great awe-inspiring invocation, clicking the left teeth thirty-six times, reciting:

“The mysterious sound of the Nine Heavens, the Ox Festival holds harmony, commanding the hidden and vast, opening the hundred divine flowers, transcending stagnation without trace, the three baskets of netting waves, returning the pure fullness of radiance, pearls dense in the canopy of sand, cinnabar bright in the appointed fate, the pear secret of kalpa A, containing light reflecting completion, ascending to fill the home, the master horse rides the void, steering the heavenly demons, adjusting and severing the lineage, annihilating forms in the nine nets, the tiger transforms with divine might, commanding and controlling myriad evils, slashing and killing without mercy, from great to small all perish, fiends vanish with time, calamity destroyed in supreme harmony, riding the radiance and steering the void, stepping lightly on flying mists, entering and exiting the imperial court, forever preserving the spiritual branch.” Then swallow the qi thirty-six times and cease.

Those who do not accept the Divine Tiger Supreme Talisman must not recklessly recite this invocation. This invocation contains the hidden names of the great demons of the Nine Heavens; one spell shakes the Nine Heavens, binds ten thousand ghosts’ forms, blinds a thousand essences, and summons a hundred gods to court. To recite without acceptance causes the soul and spirit to be lost. The high supreme demon-destroying invocation is likewise; be clearly cautious. There are also demon-destroying talismans and Divine Tiger talismans in the demon-destroying scripture, all secret sounds of the Nine Heavens demon kings. It is best to wear and invoke them all together when controlling demons.

On the first day of the seventh month in the year of Yichou, third year of Xingning, the Perfected One Tongbai bestowed to Xu Yuanyou, saying: “In the years of Jiashen, Yihai, Renzhen, and Guisi, on the first day of the ninth month, the seventh day of the seventh month, and the eighth day of the fourth month, there will be Daoists wearing seven-colored ritual robes, holding nine-curved staffs, either at spiritual altars or begging among the people, chanting scriptures and poems, or composing wild songs. If you see them, diligently seek their dao; they will surely grant you the Divine Tiger Supreme Talisman.” This is the Perfected One of the Southern Peak, who always sends emissaries at those times into the human world to observe the hearts of those who study the dao.
