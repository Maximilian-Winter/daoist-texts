Title of the Scripture: The Cavernous Truth Most High Nine Vermilion Ban Talisman of the Five Emperors Inner Scripture. Abbreviated as *Nine Vermilion Ban Talisman*. Author unknown, roughly dating from the Eastern Jin. An important early classic of the Shangqing lineage. One scroll. Source text: *Orthodox Daoist Canon*, Zhengyi Section.

### The Cavernous Truth Most High Nine Vermilion Ban Talisman of the Five Emperors Inner Scripture

The Nine Vermilion Ban Talisman, also called the Feathered Forest Flying Heaven Nine Talismans. The Primordial Heavenly King concealed it within the Golden Chamber and Jade Room atop the Shangqing Jade Terrace, where divine truths blaze brilliantly, radiating streams of light that illumine the void. The Four Extremities oversee its trials; the Five Emperors guard the truth. The Most High commands three hundred Jade Youths of the Cloud Palace, while the Upper Origin commands seven hundred Jade Maidens of Western Splendor, attending to the spiritual script. The divine standard is Shangqing, majestic over the Nine Heavens, commanding demons to vanish and purify, beheading hordes of evildoers, sealing and governing the sacred mountains, summoning water spirits, commanding myriad myriads, leading tens of thousands of immortals, the Five Sacred Mountains, the Four Great Waters, and all later disciples’ bodies. Their retinues wield divine weapons, punishing faults and rewarding merits. Every nine thousand years, the Nine Heavens open as one; when they open, their script reveals the chambers of the Five Sacred Mountains, mysteriously imparted to those who attain the Dao. Those without immortal bones or jade names carving this scripture for future lives shall never see its chapters. Whoever obtains its text becomes the master teacher of the Five Sacred Mountains, sovereign of the Four Seas. Those who honor it celebrate the souls of seven ancestral generations, blessings flowing to nine kinds of kin; those who cultivate it carve their way to becoming lofty Shangqing immortals and true perfected beings. The Nine Vermilion are the qi of the Nine Primal Origins, flying mysterious feathered seals, forming jade script. The Primordial Scribes transmit it to the Most High Great Dao Lord; the Primordial Heavenly King passes it to the Southern Pole Upper Origin Lord; the Most High transmits it to the Emperor of Fusang; the Great Emperor passes it to the Supreme Celestial Lord of Taiwei; the Taiwei Celestial Lord passes it to the Later Sage Golden Palace Lord; who passes it to the Upper Minister Azure Youth Lord; the Southern Pole Upper Origin Lord passes it to the Elder of Hongya and the Four True Lords of the Supreme Ultimate. Qi upon qi is passed on, all carved onto golden slips, bound with purple scrolls, wrapped in cloud brocade pouches, sealed with the triadic insignia, stored in dense, secret chests within nine winding chambers. Jade immortals perform incense rites; Mount Tai holds the banner; the Four Supervisors reflect; the Five Emperors guard the pavilion; the Three Origins hold solemn rites; myriad immortals pay homage to the truth. This Dao is supremely wondrous, transmitted once every seven thousand years by ritual. Leak it lightly and reveal it, and if passed to unworthy ones, the seven ancestors will investigate; the body perishes at the river source.

Later disciples, diligent and earnest, seeking immortality with sincerity, moved by the profound virtue of the great void, harmonizing with the mysterious vigor of the Three Origins, will naturally receive this text, obtain the true talisman, and then may traverse the mysterious mountains, entrust their bodies to secluded peaks, employ the Nine Vermilion to seal hills, command the Five Phases to summon spirits, cause the Water Emperor to erase sins, harness sea spirits to connect sources. Thus, the registers of sin vanish in the Nine Palaces, life records are carved in the Three Purities, qi shakes the vast waters, awe commands myriad spirits, demons are extinguished and tested, immortal officials descend in form, govern the Six Jia, control the celestial spirits, penetrate the hidden and subtle, perceive the unborn — hence they become divine immortals, soaring to Shangqing.

If one studies without seeing the Nine Vermilion White Feathers of the Feathered Forest Flying Heaven Nine Talismans, then the Five Sacred Mountains will not receive their mysterious names; the water spirits of the Four Seas will not erase sins or issue registers; the Three Purities will not inscribe. Wandering rivers and marshes, dwelling in hidden mountains, if one does not wear this text, then mountain spirits and heavenly demons will test and defeat their purpose, myriad calamities arise, and ultimately one will not become immortal. The Water Emperor compiles the books, listing sins before the Emperors.

### The Five Sacred Mountains and Five Emperors Inner Reflection on Transformation of True Form and the Supreme Method of Seeking Immortality

Whoever enters the Eastern Sacred Mountain contemplates the Azure Emperor God of the East. Closing their eyes, if they immediately see the true form, then their five palaces bind qi, six viscera produce truth, nine palaces are clear and bright, no stagnation within, harmonious sounds resonate, wondrous principles clearly understood — such a person is the talent of a supreme immortal. Thus the Dao descends for them, the divine brightness responds and meets them, and immortality is attained without shifting years. If they see azure qi dense and flourishing, this is the upright spirit’s qi reflected, indicating gradual Dao progress. If they see black qi, it is the upper truth’s original birth, the official reflected in qi, overseeing the trial of the destined body. If they see red qi, it is the official born from the cavern, reflected in qi, coming to guard the destined body. If they see yellow qi, it is the official dispatched by the mountain, reflected in qi, coming to grant the destined one true passage. All this is no wonder; act according to the text, and over time the Dao will naturally respond and descend. If they see white qi, it is the essence of heavenly demons in the void, coming to interfere with the destined body’s trial. They must knock their left teeth thirty-six times and recite the Golden Mysterious Chapter’s incantation once; then the demon essence self-annihilates, and the truth descends.

If they see black qi, it is the essence of the great heavenly demon in the void, coming to interfere with the destined truth. They must knock their left teeth thirty-six times and recite the Mysterious Chapter’s incantation once; then the demon essence self-annihilates, and the truth descends.

Whoever enters the Western Sacred Mountain contemplates the White Emperor God of the West. Closing their eyes, if they immediately see the true form, then their chest holds the golden palace, six palaces receive truth, penetrating hidden and spiritual realms, returning and releasing mysterious origins, no obstruction within, no dust of desire without — hence called the Golden Pattern of the Book, recording characters of Shangqing. Such a person is the talent of a supreme immortal. Thus the Dao descends for them, the divine brightness responds and meets them, and immortality is attained without shifting years. If they see white qi, it is the upright spirit’s qi reflected, indicating gradual Dao progress.

They must knock their left teeth thirty-six times and recite the Golden Mysterious Chapter’s incantation once; then the demon essence self-annihilates, and the true form descends.

Whoever enters the Northern Sacred Mountain contemplates the Black Emperor God of the North. Closing their eyes, if they immediately see the true form, then their mysterious vigor marks the dawn, five hearts bind networks, qi joins the purple heavens, mysterious script of the Northern Origin, carving slips in the azure palace, brightly illuminating hidden chambers, penetrating divine and subtle realms — such a person is the talent of a supreme immortal. Thus the Dao descends for them, the divine brightness responds and meets them, and immortality is attained without shifting years.

Closing their eyes, if they immediately see the true form, then their crimson palace produces splendor, the red child receives immortality, principles intertwine and remove stagnation, tastes of the bright firmament are clear — called the Imperial Chamber of the Book, mapping the Three Origins’ figures. Such a person is the talent of a supreme immortal. Thus the Dao descends for them, the divine brightness responds and meets them, and immortality is attained without shifting years.

Practitioners wear his talisman to summon his presence, preserve their qi to manifest their truth, erase the Water Emperor’s registers, inscribe jade slips of the chapters.
