### The True Secret Scripture of the Most High Dongzhen: The Three Nines’ Pure Words and Jade Essence True Formula

**The Three Nines’ Pure Words and Jade Essence True Formula**

The Elder of the Nine Heavens and the Jade Youth of the Three Heavens, at the auspicious day of the first year of the Heavenly Jia cycle, when the Northern Pivot was added, shifting degrees and halting the chariot, the Three Origins aligned in splendor, the Nine Emperors returned to truth, ascending the High Jade Pavilion in the Purple Void Heaven. There, the Three Nines’ Pure Words were revealed, unlocking the numinous gate; the Jade Essence True Formula, the principle of life’s longevity, opened vast and clear, pure and serene, the jade tones refined the void, the exquisite sounds soared to the skies, fragrant winds stirred the boundless, wisdom chanted in the distant expanse, the fragrance flowed deep within the mind, the breath crowned the divine whirlwind, the jade inspection commanded all, myriad immortals came to pay homage. This profound and ancient wondrous transformation has endured through countless kalpas without decay. The true formula was composed as a legacy for the contemplative, to test the heart’s diligence and aspiration. If one’s golden name is Eastern Splendor, the green characters of the Purple Court, having received this wondrous chapter, one’s rank ascends to Jade Purity; the Three Gates open the mechanism, the Nine Doors receive the spirit, the face shines with golden countenance, the five viscera blossom in splendor, the golden truth flows freely, clarity bursts forth in revelation, the divine candle shines hidden, precious light is born at night, flowing gold intermingles and scatters, radiant fire bells fall, the howling command stands firm, driving and marshaling the divine troops, the Three Origins arrive at the chamber, summoning the green palanquin, riding the void and driving the empty, soaring to Jade Purity.

The Prime Minister, Lord Qing Tong, said: “The Three Nines’ Pure Words arise from the Nine Emperors’ Three True Command Spells. The principle and qi halt the years, unlocking the numinous gate, the five viscera blossom fresh. If you possess jade bones and behold this text, secretly swear a solemn oath, pledging faith to the Nine Heavens and quietly cultivate its dao. Take utmost care not to recklessly proclaim it; to reveal it to unworthy persons invites calamity. Examine your own body carefully, for it is not mere wind blades, but disaster reaches the Seven Mysteries. Brightly and cautiously observe the heavenly regulations to seek the true dao; persevere nine years without slackening, and you shall attain the Supreme Immortal.”

The formula text was transmitted simultaneously by the Elder of the Nine Heavens and the Jade Youth of the Three Heavens, passed down through the Supreme Emperor Lord, the Heavenly Emperor Lord, and the Supreme Emperor of the Great Subtlety. The Supreme Emperor Lord transmitted it to the Southern Pole Supreme Origin Lord; the Heavenly Emperor Lord to the Queen Mother of the West; the Supreme Emperor of the Great Subtlety to the Sacred Lord of the Golden Palace. The Sacred Lord of the Golden Palace passed it to Prime Minister Lord Qing Tong, who passed it to the Western City King Lord, to entrust to future disciples who are to become true persons. Upholding the true prime ministerial lineage, the qi is linked to the imperial chapters. The King Lord has already endured over seven thousand kalpas. Afterward, the King Lord enshrined the spiritual text within the jade chamber of the western cave of Mount Wangwu, guarded by pure spirit officials who attend incense rites and texts. Its dao is secret and wondrous, not circulated in the world. Should one of profound name encounter this text, myriad immortals will come to court, the Heavenly Officials will guard the body, diligently practice and deeply contemplate, ascending by daybreak.

Whoever receives the Three Treasures of the Dao and Virtue of Shangqing, walking the path of void and ascending the mysterious, yet does not first liberate the five viscera and open the hidden gate of principle, the myriad qi will not consolidate, the true spirit will not rejoice, and all efforts will be in vain, never attaining immortality.
