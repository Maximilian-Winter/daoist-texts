### The Hidden Text of the Supreme True Divine Tiger of the Cavern

The Supreme Great Dao Lord, thus plucked the shimmering dragon-cloud chime, a thousand soaring tones, myriad echoes entwined and stirred, flowing brilliance thick and vigorous, purple mists circling yin, the mysterious wind issuing eight strands. Then the jade phoenix stretched its neck, golden luan gathered its qi, dragons chanted over blue waves, tigers leapt through the jade isles, nine howls harmonized in song, the Mysterious Sovereign’s cavernous heaven, beasts crouched rolling up their sleeves, fierce horses bared their throats, the fierce mountain spread its breadth, sword in mouth to seize evil, myriad voices in wild confusion, a hundred cries of strange demons.

Then he commanded the Jade Clarity Upper Palace maidens—An Fa Ying, Tian Sifei, Zhao Dingzhu, Li Yunmen—to unite in song, waving the divine poems, extinguishing essences and scattering spirits with their melodies. Their words read:

In ancient times, I rode the reins of the Great Rosy Clouds, traversing the Eight Floating Realms to forge the cloud encampment.  
The Divine Ancestor ordered the spiritual bosom, dragon wings flourishing over the Jade Capital.  

Golden gates entwined with luxuriant verdure, nine chambers shining with purple jade.  
High carriage crossed the Northern Origin, rustling entering the realm of Non-Being.  

The Vermilion Tiger guides the spiritual master, the Green Chariot ascends to the Supreme Clarity.  
Four mysteries illuminate the morning ban, embracing splendor returning to the Phoenix City.  

Seven calamities still the pure bond, aiming to mark the Nine Primal Crossroads.  
Proclaiming the treasure of the Great Radiance, the whirlwind leaps and spreads the shining scene.  

Regulating and controlling the origin village, the river spirit already leads the way.  
Yin clouds bear the night sun, the candle moon suddenly crosses the dawn.  

Binding the bright Vermilion Life Spirit, leading and returning together to Non-Being.  
Ten thousand sources inscribe the Northern Valley, riding the void to return as shooting stars.  

Extinguishing the radiance, selecting the floating wanderers, towering peaks rise from sky waves.  
Lingering joyous music lodges, subtle and wondrous stretching toward the void.  

The secluded abode holds the elixir pearl, the vast space of the dao flows freely.  
Dark and light grasp the spiritual talisman, secretly pushing—how could it be lost or destroyed?  

Descending into the profound to manifest the assembly, life’s beginning seems like a long dream.  
Virtue hides the traces within the void, utmost silence unaware of the moment.  

Divine essence stirs the Great Primordial, smoke reflected where it dwells.  
Mysterious sounds perform beyond form, subtle threads how could they be doubted?  

Coordinating the morning drum and long fan, brilliance and rosy clouds arise here.  
Cutting off the cavernous, vast flowing currents, wings soaring over the six commanding terraces.  

The Divine King enters the Jade Void, reaching Non-Being without invading the Vermilion Army.  
Nine nets encounter the distant vastness, wondrous assemblies already pacified.  

The Dao Treasury’s golden supreme chapter, plucking and tuning glorious cypress splendor.  
A thousand dragons spew green water, nine rivers overturn and pour out.  

Vast mists engulf the ultimate abode, spiritual waves cover the fourfold court.  
Heads aligned, towering brocade palaces, none can inspect form or name.  

Leading and drawing in harmonious elegance, freely grasping the mysterious transformation principle.  
Containing essence, burning the cloud chamber, desolate and clear the zero record.  

The spiritual dao hastens toward the orchid palace, mysterious and mysterious it rises.  
Ten thousand peaks spread wondrous sights, above the clouds are jade children.  

At the end of kalpas, coordinating jade splendor, unaware the sun has just begun.  
Original spirits unite in cavern transformation, sinking and submitting, forgetting fixed paths.  

The River Marquis binds the upper vision, shining pearls and exquisite jade court.  
Principle origin reveals the three spirits, condensed and clear, how could it lack fullness?  

The sun and moon interweave heavy yin, turning and brushing, preserving the fallen darkness.  
Fully entrusting the six senses beyond, spiritual chants harmonize as one voice.  

Turning the mechanism of the celestial river dao, shining and moving splendid jade.  
Ten thousand gods mount the vermilion horse, a thousand demons find no time to arise.  

Monsters perish by water and fire officials, true body guards the Great Purity.  

Four fates at the northern cliff, principle and spirit steady the reins,  
Calling and summoning earth deities, earth essence conceals qi,  
Mountains hide clouds, nine sources utterly extinguished,  
Checking and comparing a thousand essences, grasping heads, thunder shakes.  

The Northern Emperor opens the dao, four illuminations serve the chariot,  
Smashing and destroying myriad evils, cutting and severing Feng Mountain,  
Nine ghosts share the head, a thousand demons one body,  
Five Emperors wield the battle-axe, divine lords exhale smoke,  
Purple brightness towers the observatory, vermilion qi coils repeatedly,  
Spirit runs the night terrace, essence stores long and continuous,  
Poisonous beasts ten thousand feet tall, their slaughters have no kin.  

What small demon dares gather hundreds or thousands?  
Entwined qi all gaze together, when man opens the gate,  
The divine tiger unleashes might, cutting and seizing cruel birds,  
The Great Primordial wondrous dao, the utmost spirit’s discerning place.  

You now receive this, forever to wear upon your person,  
A thousand trials cannot compare, a thousand demons cannot touch.  
Jade splendor reaches the chamber, Heaven’s truth roams and revolves,  
Reciting clear spiritual sounds, ascending to court the Three Primes.  

When the song ended, the Supreme Great Dao Lord commanded the Left Mysterious Jade Gentleman Yu Lixuan,  
Holding the golden feather baton, to summon the Supreme Subtle Heavenly Emperor.  
The Supreme Subtle Heavenly Emperor condensed and transformed essence qi,  
Manipulated true glory and void, roared and commanded ten thousand gods,  
Gathered the original array, holding the golden truth,  
Calm and vast the Great Non-Being, suddenly hearing the command complete,  
He proceeded to ascend the bestowed carriage, feathered spirit vermilion sovereign,  
Opening the dao chariot armor, ten thousand heavenly tigers,  
Driving away golden dragons, commanding troops with jade baton,  
Casting radiance flying splendor, entering the dark flowing candle,  
Glorious array marches forth, the sun’s essence beats beside the blue drum,  
Striking the jade bell with pounding sound.  

Then the Mysterious Sovereign harmonized and united,  
Broad music restrained the rear, nine phoenixes stretched their necks and howled,  
A hundred dragons held the rhythm and blew together,  
Golden essence leapt in sound, entering luan flight and dance,  
Purple banners erected in the sky, brocade standards circling the wilds,  
Green canopies arrayed in shade, morning bends suddenly raised,  
Flowing bells tossed and exchanged, moonlight piercing clear sound,  
Jade rods manifest truth, circling and settling five images,  
Fragrant flowers scatter smoke, blooming splendor of three lights,  
Light clouds receive brilliance, thin rosy clouds bear light,  
Reins clatter seven ways, eight carriages float in the void,  
Empty chariot nine thousand, guarded by poisonous dragons,  
Running clouds hasten to the mystery, gathering qi and capturing wind,  
Heaven brightens and bursts forth, eight lights veil and cover,  
True maiden rides on the right, left commands the spirit youth,  
Suddenly a thousand myriad fish, already arrived at the Upper Palace,  
Halting the carriage at Jade Clarity, body rises to the imperial rampart,  
Turning steps at the purple gate, bowing heads awaiting passage.  

Having arrived a long while, the Supreme Middle Dao commanded the four morning attendants,  
Slowly leading them forward, ascending the bud pearl gate, entering the seven reflected inner chambers.  
The Supreme Subtle Heavenly Emperor proclaimed his name:  
“Your humble servant has now arrived, please open the great command.”  

The Supreme Great Dao Lord said:  
“Li Shanyuan’s virtue unites the seven sages, ruler of the Golden Gate,  
Now he shall visit the Ten Heavens, governing fate of myriad beings,  
Fixing the central origin in the mysterious mechanism,  
Controlling yin and yang to align the head,  
Drawing out the true and promoting leadership,  
Sealing rivers and summoning seas,  
Cutting off the duties of life and death, wielding heavenly might,  
Decapitating the six heavens, summing punishments of the Three Officials,  
Punishment executed by the Northern Emperor.  

The enlightened lord attends the chariot, the dao also stands lofty,  
Virtue vast and far-reaching, responsibility heavy indeed,  
Authority equally matched. Having explained this with wisdom,  
Also recording it to dispel demons, wisdom can drive gods,  
Dispel demons can destroy evil.  

Again, he is granted the divine tiger true talisman,  
To wield might to decapitate the six heavens,  
Chanting it with lofty divine verses, also assisting to scatter filth and remove calamity.  

Moreover, the Supreme Subtle Emperor treasures the golden tiger true talisman,  
To control heaven and earth spirits, commanding it to act,  
It can crush and sever a thousand essences,  
Wearing it when going forth, ten thousand ghosts vanish in form,  
Multitudes of demons rashly invade and immediately die,  
Groups of monsters spying upon it become dimmed.  

Thus it may all be bestowed upon Shanyuan to fulfill his duty.”  

Then the Supreme Subtle Emperor respectfully bowed,  
Unfolded the cloud chest, opened the jade box,  
Seven lights reflected on white, flowing sun revealed the truth,  
Nine radiances halted in brightness, flying fragrance intertwined.  

Holding the talisman but not yet granting,  
He personally commanded the Supreme Subtle maidens—Ji Linhua, Yan Caiyun, Zhu Tiaoyan, Han Fangyao, and others—  
To unite in singing the golden truth poem, stepping the void melody. Their words read:

The Great Darkness severs the four mysteries,  
The cavern’s radiance entrusts divine power.  
Jade terrace spreads vermilion sky,  
Green mists hold golden ramparts.  

Above drawing cloud pearl collar,  
Looking up to grant the blade-less peak.  
Spirit mirror fears the purple hall,  
Radiance vermilion shining mid-air.  

Dark transformation entwines the mysterious root,  
Grasping the baton, carrying the purple youth.  
Round path without condensation or desert,  
Luxuriant mists again bear weight.  

Southward pushing Vermilion Mound gate,  
Westward crossing the grand broken window.  
Body agile over myriad ferry waves,  
Spirit born encompassing the Ten Directions.  

Mysterious return to silent chariot,  
Ascending to ride the heavenly dragon.  
Darkness sweeps flying radiant carriage,  
Waving bells, seven ways roam.  

Light waves, cloud dust ferry,  
Suddenly arriving at the jade isles.  
Left seizes jade reflecting wife,  
Right commands golden truth husband.  

Above connects flying sky awakening,  
Bowing grants spiritual wondrous fields.  
Enveloping vast cold universe,  
Spreading brocade entering divine hills.  

Phoenix brain fixed for kalpa lifespan,  
Nectar flower returns to splendor’s decline.  
Supreme Great indeed longevity ripe,  
Controlling fate of myriad last steps.  

Three awakenings inherit mysterious numbers,  
Freely joyous shining tooth and return.  
Whirlwind dazzling halts radiant waves;  
Purple cassia where does it rest?  

Jade fruit rings the nine skies,  
Jade baton summons Supreme Subtle.  
Yellow tablet restrains virtue blade,  
How could it affect true man’s radiance?  

Abandoning plainness entering no substance,  
Hundred images all begin to leave.  
Opening yang elixir qi sprout,  
Brilliantly shining crimson clouds fly.  

Aligned and contracted jade reflection still,  
Dazzling suspended Supreme Clarity domain.  
Divine spirits respond to dark numbers,  
Following feelings summon portent worlds.  

Vast ferry waves thick and luxuriant,  
Joining radiance to partake in descendant.  
Towering golden gate child,  
Desolate entering spiritual boundary.  

Looking down and up myriad changes,  
Will follow and unite true contract.  
Mysterious dwelling severs silent terrace,  
Clear chant wisdom and intelligence.  

Dispelling demons reducing myriad edges,  
Waving poems to drive away filth.  
Golden tiger inherits heavenly might,  
Crushing gods to hide qi.  

Sweeping monsters ten thousand tons,  
Ten thousand li of heavenly evil chaff.  

Then the Great God cut the blood of a hundred essences,  
Blinding the golden tiger,  
Fierce and proud, exhaling might,  
Releasing poison, casting ghosts,  
Uninterrupted and crossing,  
Gut the six heavens,  
Sharing heads with divine spirits,  
Suddenly confining black beasts,  
Hiding sounds in forest and grass,  
Lying down in the Great Primordial.  

Wondrous ethereal spiritual text,  
Mysterious and dense to wear,  
And thus advancing to court the Jade Emperor,  
Paying respects in the chamber,  
All true beings come to his room.  

If there is leakage in the Divine Tiger text, disaster strikes the nine clans,  
If there is flaw in the Golden Tiger true talisman, calamity reaches the seven ancestors.  
Shanyuan keeps it hidden, the essence of dao and virtue.  
In the fearful night, simply reciting these two poems,  
A thousand essences scatter and hide, as if lodging with ten thousand men.  
Mountains and rivers hearing this chant, all seize whips and turn toward the sound to bow with reverence.  

Afterwards, one poem, the letter of the Nine Glorious Peaceful Consort, was revealed.  
On the sixth day of the eleventh month, at the fifteenth drum toward dawn,  
The Purple Clarity Nine Glorious Peaceful Consort came to bestow this,  
Commanding the writing, not yet finished by dawn.
