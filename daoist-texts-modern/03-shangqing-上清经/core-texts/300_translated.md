# Scripture of the Numinous Tiger Jade of the Most High Cavern of Truth

**Title of the Scripture:** Scripture of the Numinous Tiger Jade of the Most High Cavern of Truth. Also known as *True Talisman of the Numinous Tiger*. The author is unknown, but it likely emerged during the Eastern Jin dynasty. It belongs to the early Shangqing lineage of talismanic writings. One scroll. Source text from the *Zhengtong Daozang*, Zhengyi section.

Lord Wang said:  
The True Talisman of the Numinous Tiger was issued by the Parents of the Nine Heavens of Supreme Truth. The Elder of Supreme Truth transmitted it to the Little Child of the Eastern Sea; the True King of the Nine Heavens passed it to the Most High Dao Lord. The Most High Dao Lord always treasured this secret, hiding it deep within the Jade Chamber of the Qiong Palace in the Spiritual Capital of Taiwei. It was guarded by colossal beasts, protected by venomous dragons, with seven thousand numinous tigers stationed at the royal gates. Three hundred Golden Morning Jade Boys and three hundred Pure Spirit Jade Maidens attended as guardians of the numinous script.

The mysterious radiance filled the empty sky, scattering mists across the Purple Court. Its awe shook the realms of the nine directions; divine light shone brilliantly upon Shangqing. Marvelous and free, it opened naturally; penetrating wisdom reached the formless. The numinous tiger arrayed its image, the golden tiger spanned its true form, wisdom marked its staff, dispelling demons and unfolding its source. Its subtle meaning was profound and deep, its wondrous charm difficult to detail—each line inscribed with heavenly demon’s hidden secrets, sometimes noting the inner names of a hundred spirits. Reciting its chapters stirred a thousand spirits into awe; chanting its verses bound ten thousand demons in form.

From the establishment of the Three Heavens’ original order, it was entrusted to the Taiwei Heavenly Emperor, to wield authority over the Six Heavens, sever a myriad spirits, summon mountains and seas, bind the host of spirits, quell demonic trials, and revolve the Five Stars. Thus, the Taiwei Heavenly Emperor received and bore the two talismans of demon-dispelling wisdom and divine gold, adorned them while roaming Shangqing, riding the void in swift chariots, floating the Taiwei wheel, clearing the pavilion of Supreme Truth, resting his feet upon the Jade Emperor’s steps. In stillness, he harmonized with Heaven and Earth; in motion, he shone with the seven lights. He corrected the nine mysteries, grasped the spiritual pivot, led countless degrees, gathered myriad ferries, stirred the hundred yang to birth lightning, turned the thousand yin to exhale power. Morning mists unfolded the Dao at the Golden Gate; the heavenly barrier responded and opened of its own accord. He commanded the eight lights to ascend high, unleashed the numinous tiger to soar upward, the host of immortals opened the path, the seven stars raced in movement. The mysterious light darkened and lingered, a billion transformations and myriad venerables, penetrating the boundless realms of vision, surveying the edges of the utmost heavens, casting eyes upon the Five Defilements, lamenting all living beings and warning of decline. Truly subtle indeed—the wondrous efficacy of the True Talisman’s numinous transformation!

The Taiwei Heavenly Emperor said to the Prime Minister Qing Tong and the Western City Lord:  
“The Great Wisdom Scripture of Shangqing, the Demon-Dispelling True Scripture, is the Jade Scroll of the Supreme Ultimate, the precious secret of the Most High. The True Talisman of the Numinous Tiger is the treasured chapter of the Nine Heavens’ Supreme Truth. Wisdom can chase away filth; demon-dispelling can bind evil; the True Talisman can master demons. Those who possess the jade slip with its purple name and cultivate the highest methods will be borne by the host of spirits and tested by myriad demons. If one wishes that ten thousand harms cannot injure, ten thousand trials cannot affect, all is by the might of the numinous tiger and the wondrous use of the true scripture.

“Now I entrust it to you to pass on to later learners who aspire to be true persons. They must follow the Supreme Truth’s discipline: within seven hundred years, only three transmissions are permitted; it must not be shown to unworthy persons. If the true text is lightly revealed, the body will suffer the test of the wind blades, calamity will reach the seven mysteries. If one bears the golden name ‘Eastern Splendor’ and records the characters of Shangqing, then possessing this talisman, accompanied by thirty-six Jade Boys and Jade Maidens as guardians, one may brave dangers and risks, cross mountains and seas, summon spirits and command ghosts, seal and govern the spiritual peaks. Wherever one goes, a thousand demons hide in submission, ten thousand devils are bound in form, the host of immortals attend and guard, the body shines with wondrous light.

“Those who cultivate for less than seven years, the true spirit will descend upon the disciple’s chamber, riding the flying chariot and green plow, ascending the morning sun at noon. The recipient must fast and purify for ninety days, or thirty days, or seven days, each bearing ten taels of superior gold as proof of divine truth; ninety feet of brocade as oath to the Nine Heavens; thirty feet of blue silk as pledge of the heart. Those who love the Dao and delight in truth, diligently focusing on the mysterious, will not be disturbed by wealth or possessions. The light regards the Dao as precious; where the Dao is, nothing is lost. Only such persons may be spoken with.

“Those who cherish wealth within and are frivolous without, the Dao will also illuminate and close the jade box, storing it in the Golden Gate. After ascending and transcending, store it in the famous mountains.”
