## The Three Caverns of Mixed Transformation, Inner Truths of Change, Birth, Official Titles, and Precious Names

The *Scripture of the Supreme Primordial Spirit and Great Abundance* unfolds the Dao of the Three Truths and Nine Caverns through the Pure Words of the Three-Nine, the Primordial Elixir’s Supreme Transformation. It coexists with the primordial qi, born together from the Origin. The Three Essences condense and transform, forming a brilliant jade chapter, constructing and manifesting the three caverns’ palaces, weaving and governing the abyss of myriad truths. This secret lies above the Nine Heavens, within the Palace of Great Abundance, in the Golden Terrace and Jade Chamber of the Primordial Spirit’s Room. Carved upon jade slips, the text is inscribed in golden and jade characters to illuminate its chapters.

The mixed transformation of the three caverns births the Upper Origin, centrally governing the ten absolute voids of the celestial birth, and below, the myriad qi of principle—no hidden place is untouched. Flowing light, primordial and abundant, fragrant as jade purity, flying rosy clouds and purple mists, dazzling the vast heavens. The Jade Flower Maidens and Golden Morning Children, each three thousand strong, attend and guard the numinous script.

At this time, Heaven’s Origin aligns, celebrating the auspicious Divine Court. The Primordial Sovereign Jade Emperor, the Supreme Most High, and the assembly of myriad truths and immortals all come to the throne, burning incense and venerating the scripture, circling the Upper Palace. Mysterious dawns and obscure stagnations, flying incense veiling light, spreading fragrance to cleanse the spirit, dispersing smoke over the Jade Capital. Three pure primordial clouds, flowing lightning over rosy peaks, radiant brilliance intermingling, divine candles merging in light. Attendant maidens and myriad immortals number in the hundreds of millions; poisonous dragons and giant beasts guard the spirit gates; giant serpents strike swords, long fangs strike bells; Heaven’s awe shines resplendent, transforming into the Great Void.

The eight winds drum upon the mysterious banners, jade sounds arise within the spirit palace; phoenixes cry beside the nine mists, luans sing beside the purple firmament, thick dark clouds above, the first light of dawn below. At this moment, the Heavenly Emperor Lord, the Southern Pole Upper Origin Lord, the Supreme Celestial Emperor of Taiwei, the Later Sage Nine Mysterious Golden Gate Emperor, all in pure fasting for three months, gaze upward to the Great Darkness, their profound thoughts stirred by the Great Silence, their accumulated contemplation opening to the Upper Purity. Thus they bring forth radiant light to halt the gleam, the nine latitudes entwining form, hidden ganoderma forming beauty, treasure light born at night, tasting the essence of splendor, ascending to pour the morning essence, riding the void to form smoke, the eight paths shining bright, chewing the Great Harmony, wisdom flowing through jade chapters, wandering the subtle and profound, drifting through the celestial court, vast and boundless cavern source, endless in countless ages, embracing the great transformation, divine brilliance without end.

They delight in the spiritual vision, feast within the seven dawns, clear and wash the splendid garden, rest within the nine mysteries, transform the scene of jade emptiness, lead the myriad heavens, vast and clear in two harmonies, primordial celebration of countless ferries, gazing through ultimate kalpas, drawing in the path of forgetfulness, bathing in the spirit hill, orchid peaks and pure ridges, the bright model already established, inner rhythm complete, five splendors shining in the treasury, bright and lustrous jade heart, secluded and peerless abode, purple radiance of the cavern collar, shaking the mysterious river, plucking the crimson grace forest, surveying the vast domain within, eyes clear to the ten heavens’ sounds, faint and subtle divine traces, no form to seek, spiritual transformation already hidden, riding the motion of profound clarity, flowing smoothly in pure harmony, the empty embryo forming shape—the marvelous vision of Great Abundance unfolds in primordial spirit, the secret depths of the Nine Heavens, the condensed essence of the primal cavern, governing the three passes within the hidden palace, weaving myriad truths for future birth, establishing mysterious methods to check transgressions, redeeming one’s faults in the Great Darkness, rescuing the seven ancestors from the Three Paths, ferrying lost souls through the Southern Court, reciting the wisdom chants of the Three Emperors, cleansing the turbid defilement of the Three Purities. Great indeed is this jade chapter, the utmost spirit of divine virtue.

The *Great Cavern True Scripture, Thirty-Nine Chapters*, is the Dao standard of the Supreme Emperor, the marvelous text of the Purple Dawn, setting the steps of fate in the Nine Heavens, summoning the spirits of the Five Emperors, drifting back the mixed winds, condensing the nine revolutions in the mysterious essence, joining male and female, mixing and transforming myriad gods, vast and shadowy, jade echoes of the Supreme True, operating the opening beyond the bright beam, passing through the mysterious gate of change, carving virtue’s blade to create marvels, washing brilliance to reflect clouds. The Great Desert is the spirit gate’s qi; no blade is the year of the great calamity. Lofty is the divine hall, the abyss of myriad truths, golden chambers shining resplendent, fragrant in the Upper Purity. Its purpose is subtle and profound, difficult to fully comprehend. If one can fast long, sever worldly desires, recite the jade chapters in a hidden chamber, strike the jade sound to shake the spirit, then the true person will surely receive talismans in the Eastern Splendor, the seven mysteries refreshed in the Purple Court, commanding demon kings with divine might, summoning the Five Emperors to guard the body. This is the wondrous spirit of the Great Cavern, weaving myriad paths to rebirth. Without strange hairs or odd forms, golden bones and jade names must not be recklessly revealed in the spirit script. Its prohibitions all follow the *Nine Truths Bright Methods*. Recipients, be cautious.

The *Supreme Jade Inspection Female One Five Elders Treasure Scripture*, with twelve supreme vows, eight intervals of the Mysterious Mother, nine revolutions and five returns, transforming male and female, the second rare text, the supreme chapter, mixing myriad changes, governing fate’s longevity, solidifying soul and condensing essence, leading and commanding myriad gods, releasing and resolving knots, returning to the five penetrations, all qi gathered, ascending to the Mud Pellet, nurturing the ultimate truth, splendidly reflecting the Purple Court, drifting brightly within the nine mysteries, freely flowing and shining in jade purity, spirit smoke dispersing fragrance in bright rosy clouds, divine lamps shining in the vast sky, myriad truths celebrating in the jade chamber, immortals chanting praises and venerating the scripture, flying beasts leaping in the vast sky, phoenixes and luans crying mournfully, the three lights halting their radiance, heavenly brightness dimming at noon, vast sweat in the hidden hall, the supreme ultimate truth. Its purpose is fresh and empty, profound and deep, marvelous beyond record, principle difficult to exhaust. If one has the jade rod named after the Jade Emperor, Eastern Splendor’s memorial, listed in the jade palace, one may obtain this text. Following its methods, refining heavenly truth, fasting and bitter contemplation, eating at midday, chanting the treasured chapters, exploring the spirit texts, nine years without slackening, then one attains creation of truth, refining soul and spirit in the nine palaces, governing the mixed transformation in the three passes, rescuing the seven ancestors from the hidden paths, ferrying suffering souls through the Southern Palace, reporting to the form altar for essential response, swearing faith in the heart to seek immortality. This marvelous transformation influences the dawn, riding the void to drift through the heavens, feasting without interruption.

The Supreme One said: The Dao of the omen is to preserve thought—contemplate the *Great Cavern True Scripture, Thirty-Nine Chapters*, returning wind, mixing male and female, the Five Elders, the twelve supreme vows of the Golden Flower Cavern Room Emperor, the eight gates of the Mysterious Mother, the Great One’s transformation of male and female, the highest immortal method. On the day of practice, always first clean fast, bathe in orchid incense, enter the chamber to contemplate the Primordial Spirit Five Emperors, the official precious names and inner characters of the Primordial Cavern, the Caverns of Heaven, Earth, and Abyss, summon the true to bring spirit. After the matter is complete, then one may cultivate the Great Cavern Female One Treasure Secret. Its method is profound and subtle, born with qi, coexisting with Heaven. Therefore, the Great One’s Purple Room is the mixed origin father and Mysterious Mother, with three embryos as the divine secret words, nine true names as the inner scripture of the Great Cavern, the supreme origin great elixir, the female one as the inner essence, the marvelous scripture of Great Abundance, the primordial spirit as the mysterious cavern, summing the three treasures as rare texts, binding the three qi as the supreme chapter. Its marvel is unfathomable, its height unattainable, its depth immeasurable, majestic and subtle indeed—this jade chapter possesses great virtue. If you can diligently contemplate, then by day you ascend to Heaven, the path of immortality, the two extremes in the spirit script.

## Scripture of the Supreme Dao Lord Guarding the Three Primordial Truths as One

The Dao of the Three Caverns binds the name of nature, assisting the unification of the Three Treasures: *Great Cavern True Scripture*, *Female One Five Elders*, *Great Abundance Primordial Spirit*. They correspond to the Three Primordials: the Primordial Cavern governs Heaven, the True Cavern governs Earth, the Mysterious Cavern governs Man. The three qi unite in clarity, jointly governing the three palaces of the omen body, mutually supporting to complete the whole. If the omen desires immortality, it must seek the original birth, mastering and commanding the flowing rosy clouds, taking the cavern as the foremost.

All who cultivate the Three Treasures Shangqing True Scripture must first contemplate the inner true precious names of the three caverns, hold in mind the official titles, to protect the body form, then practice to become a true person. Its method is most marvelous, secret within the Great Abundance Primordial Spirit Palace. The omen has bone division; one must diligently practice the true Dao, always bitterly contemplating, fasting with orchid incense, avoiding defiled qi. The spirit will naturally manifest form. After eighteen years, the green carriage descends, riding clouds and controlling dragons, ascending by day to the mysterious.

Now I tell you this secret, to be carefully practiced.

Always at dawn contemplate the Cavern Heaven, at noon contemplate the Cavern Earth, at midnight contemplate the Cavern Abyss; or at noon contemplate all three truths at once. The method of contemplation: enter the chamber facing east, tap the teeth thirty-two times, first close the eyes and contemplate the Primordial Spirit Palace’s Clear Subtle Mansion, where blue qi and red qi interlace thickly, descending into the omen body’s Mud Pellet Upper Palace, then swallow nine qi. Next contemplate the Orchid Terrace Mansion, where red and yellow two qi interlace as before, descending into the omen body’s Lower Palace, then swallow nine qi. Next contemplate the Imperial Hall Mansion, where white and black two qi interlace as before, descending into the omen body’s Dan Tian Palace below the navel, then swallow nine qi. After swallowing the three caverns’ qi, recite the following invocation:

Heaven and Earth mixed chaos, cavern abyss three essences, primordial beginning forming transformation, five qi mixed birth, change and transform mysterious origin, pouring into the body form, mastering and commanding flowing rosy clouds, ascending into the Purple Court, Northern Emperor falls dead, Eastern Splendor records the name, cavern reaches the subtle, merging with the Emperor.

Finished, then tap teeth nine times, contemplate the Primordial Cavern Primordial Brightness Primordial Radiance Extended Spirit Illumination Lord Mysterious Mixed, granting me the Yang Rosy Dawn Vermilion Bright Talisman. Next contemplate the Cavern Heaven birth official, clothing and name as above, descending from the Primordial Spirit Palace’s Clear Subtle Mansion into the omen body’s Mud Pellet Palace. Then recite:

Cavern Heaven Upper Origin, overseeing the nine mysteries, commanding the three qi, mixed birth in the Dan Tian, opening the cavern’s hidden gate, entering and exiting without gap, soul and spirit precious radiance, entwining splendid freshness, flying clouds in the crimson chamber, feasting and wandering the purple heavens, jointly protecting Heaven and Earth, long enjoying countless years.

After finishing Cavern Heaven, turn south, contemplate the Cavern Earth True Cavern Great Mars Great Cavern Origin Birth Great Spirit Mechanism Sovereign Lord Scene Transformation, granting me the Transparent Four Caverns Nine Origins Talisman. Next contemplate the Cavern Earth birth official, clothing and name as above, descending from the Primordial Spirit Palace’s Orchid Terrace Mansion into the omen body’s Crimson Palace. Then recite:

Cavern Earth Middle Origin, commanding flying immortals, splendid crown and treasure radiance, blue waist and established kerchief, granting me the spirit talisman, communicating truth to summon spirit, cavern contemplation subtle, receiving the Emperor’s secret words, releasing knots and scattering bindings, nine orifices clear, seven ancestors all freed, ascending to the Southern Pavilion, cloud chariot descending, white sun rising morning.

After finishing Cavern Earth, turn north, contemplate the Cavern Abyss Mysterious Cavern Great White Retaining Golden City Radiant Radiance Primordial Essence Primordial Guide Supreme Ancient Lord Vast Field, granting the Dawn Opening All-Heaven Treasure Talisman to the omen body. Next contemplate the Cavern Abyss birth official, clothing and name as above, descending from the Primordial Spirit Palace’s Imperial Hall Mansion into the omen body’s Dan Tian Palace below the navel. Then recite:

Cavern Abyss hidden gate, above joining the Three Primordials, mysterious qi abundant, flying rosy purple clouds, flowing yellow five colors, splendid morning treasure talisman, mastering and commanding Dawn Opening, coexisting with the origin long-lasting, riding the void, driving the empty, feasting in the jade morning, carrying and leading the Radiant Emperor, forming friendships with true immortals.

After finishing Cavern Abyss, return east, tap teeth nine times, swallow saliva nine times, the three caverns are complete.

If you can practice this, true spirits will manifest form, jade maidens may serve, jade youths bring spirit, the Three Primordials descend, the elixir chariot green carriage comes to welcome the omen body, ascending to the Supreme Purity. This is the treasure secret; do not lightly transmit.

## Scripture of the Supreme Dao Lord’s Primordial Elixir

The Great Emperor Lord, Heavenly Emperor Lord, and Taiwei Heavenly Emperor Lord, having received from the Supreme Dao Lord, implement the Dao to completion, supplementing the Emperor’s truth. The Great Emperor Lord transmitted the scripture to the Queen Mother of the West; the Heavenly Emperor Lord transmitted it to the Southern Pole Upper Origin Lord; the Taiwei Heavenly Emperor Lord transmitted it to the Golden Gate Holy Lord; the Golden Gate Holy Lord transmitted it to Prime Minister Blue Youth Lord; Blue Youth Lord transmitted it to the Stream Son.

This is the upper chapter of the Primordial Spirit. This Dao is rarer than all scriptures, its method most exquisite, unknown to the middle immortals. There is no named book or crimson slip recording the words of the Shangqing; the Way of the Mysterious Elixir is not encountered. Daoists who cultivate the Supreme Three Truths Scripture attain rank as supreme emperor lords and high ministers. Those who receive only partial teachings, with limited understanding, attain rank as minor kings of the spirit palace, ministers of the divine land, mid-level officials of the Supreme Ultimate. They may still ride dragons and clouds, control the void, spirits guide and guard, scattering light to the eight directions.

Profound and mysterious, difficult to lightly reveal.

The chapters of the scripture are found in the Supreme Hidden Writings of the Eight Pure Chapters, with limits of reverence and humility.

The Three Ones are the spiritual ancestors of the one body, the root of the hundred gods’ life, the mountain source of fluids, the jade chamber of soul and essence. Thus the stomach pool is square to receive things, the brain palace round and empty to suit truth, myriad hairs stand erect, a thousand pores emit smoke, virtue completes Heaven and Earth, mingling with the Great Mystery; hence it is called the Mud Pellet. The Mud Pellet is the upper spirit of the body form.

The omen only knows swallowing qi and fluids, tapping teeth and taking in saliva, but does not know that this is caused by the Mud Pellet’s flowing foam, the brain’s peripheral branches.

Now I shall tell you the secret of guarding the One, the supreme true method. Close the mouth and cultivate reverently, do not spread. Violate the oath and you perish under ghost officials, examined by the seven ancestors, forever closed in the river source.

Above the eyebrows, one inch inward is the Bright Hall Palace; two inches inward is the Cavern Room; three inches inward is the Dan Tian. The Dan Tian straight above, one inch square, is the Mysterious Elixir Brain Essence Mud Pellet Soul Palace.

In the Bright Hall Palace, on the left is the Bright Youth True Lord, on the right the Bright Maiden True Official, in the center the Bright Mirror Spirit Lord. The Bright Youth True Lord, named Mysterious Yang, styled Young Blue. The Bright Maiden True Official, named Subtle Yin, styled Young Origin. The Bright Mirror Spirit Lord, named Illuminating Essence, styled Four Bright.

These three lords jointly govern the Bright Hall Palace, all wearing green brocade clothes, belts with four jade bells, mouths holding jade mirrors, mirrors and bells like red jade. Heads like infants, forms likewise, sitting facing outward or facing each other. This is the Dao of the Bright Hall.

If the Daoist fears, hold in mind the three spirits, ring the jade bells, let the sound reach the Supreme Ultimate, let the mouth emit jade mirror red light, shining ten thousand feet. After holding all three, call their names thrice, tap teeth nine times; then a thousand demons submit, ten thousand ghosts vanish.

If hungry or thirsty, also hold the three lords in mind, emit red qi from the mouth to pour into one’s own mouth, then inhale and swallow; in a moment one is full.

If traveling at night, darkness obscuring the path, hold the three lords in mind, let the mouth emit three fire lights to illuminate ahead; in a moment the path is clear.

If entering dangerous places with weapons and soldiers, urgently hold the three lords in mind, ring jade bells, concentrate spirit and thought; enemies naturally become fearful and intimidated, no longer harboring hostile intent.

If the Daoist seeks longevity and immortality, or faces illness and danger, seeking rescue and life, then calm the heart and rest peacefully, hold the Bright Hall three lords in mind, kneel long facing outward, emit red qi from the mouth, let the light penetrate the body, encircle the mouth, swallow countless red qi, always close eyes and gently swallow.

Soon the red qi surrounds the body, all turning to fire; the fire burns the body; body and fire become one; inside and out facing light; after a long while it ceases. This is called the Sun and Moon refining the form, dying and being reborn. Also, one must do this every evening before sleep, then one will surely attain longevity and immortality.

Also hold and swallow red qi several times, making one’s complexion return youthful, color like a maiden. This is the key method of immortality in the Bright Hall. Complete.

Above the Cavern Room are three truths: left is the Nameless Young Lord, right the White Origin Lord, center the Yellow Elder Lord; three jointly govern the Cavern Room. This is the Dao of flying truth, separately recorded in the *Golden Flower Scripture*.

In the Dan Tian are the Upper Origin True One Emperor Lord, his ministers, three together govern the Dan Tian Palace; this is the Dao of the Three Primordial Truths as One. This place is the key path of truth, the scripture of controlling the dragon chariot.

Heavenly truth has many official ranks; earthly truth are true persons; earthly true persons hide in official ranks, not laboring in court affairs, thus leisurely and at ease, wandering as time suits, riding seven chariots or more, stepping four qi in the Great Void.

As for heavenly truth and earthly truth, though differing slightly in rank, all are one truth. Earthly true persons each settle where they belong, unwilling to be cloud officials again.

The Mysterious Elixir Palace has the Mud Pellet Supreme One True Lord. One inch behind the Dan Tian is the Flowing Pearl Palace. The Flowing Pearl True Spirit has its own scripture, governing fate’s course. Its Dao is marvelous and great; one must swear an oath with pearl and silk to receive it.

This scripture is transmitted once every three hundred years, given five times only, never to be revealed again. This is the Supreme Ultimate court official’s Dao of fate.

The Mysterious Elixir Palace is above the Dan Tian, one inch square, Purple Room and Green Chamber, filled with vermilion smoke. Within is the Mud Pellet Supreme One True Lord, governing the Mysterious Elixir Palace.

The Supreme One True Lord appears like a newborn infant, seated on a golden bed with jade curtains, wearing purple embroidered brocade clothes, belt with flowing fire bells. The flowing fire bells have no substance but emit red light, their sound heard ten thousand li; this is the treasure bell of the Supreme Ultimate’s Yellow Great One True Lord.

In the left hand he holds the handle of the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper, in the right hand the tether of the North Star. The North Star is the immovable star of the North Pole, called the tether star.

He sits upright in the Mysterious Elixir Palace, facing outward, with no attendants on either side. The lack of attendants is why he is called the Supreme One True Lord.

Morning and evening he guards the Three Ones completely, alone preserving the last remnant. The last remnant is first to create its lightness, then to act its heaviness.

The head has nine palaces; let me first explain.

Above the eyebrows, wrapped within one inch, is the Yellow Gate and Purple Door, Crimson Terrace and Azure Chamber, jointly constructed guarding the one inch between the left and right ears.

To the left of the one inch is the Crimson Terrace, to the right the Yellow Gate; the Nine Palace True Lords enter and exit along the path between the Yellow Gate and Crimson Terrace. Thus the gates and terraces on left and right serve to watch unusual qi, to observe and welcome the movements of true persons.

The Purple Door Great God is named Peaceful Stillness, styled Dharma King. The Azure Chamber Great God is named Upright Heart, styled First Principle. Both appear as infants, wearing clothes matching their chamber colors, holding flowing golden fire bells.

The one inch guard is three parts inward, called the Guard Inch. At evening rest and during contemplation, first hold the two great gods in mind, as if seeing them, then call their names thrice. Then softly chant:

Purple Door and Azure Chamber, two great gods, holding flowing bells, bodies born of wind and cloud, guarding the true Dao, not heeding outside, causing my thoughts to stir, opening the spirit gate, entering and exiting with ease, ascending the nine gates, seeing the nine truths, Supreme One’s honor.

After the chant, one may contemplate the Three Ones, Cavern Room, Nine Paths, and other essentials.

The two great gods of the Guard Inch only heed the true officials within the nine palaces; those inside the nine palaces enter and exit ears and eyes, the Emperor trusts fate. When jade youths and true spirits come and go to the Emperor’s pavilion, the two great gods listen and report. Others who are not true are not admitted by these two gods.

This is the law of the Yellow Great One.

Then the Infant Emperor Lord commands the two ear spirit maidens and cloud attendants to guide entry. Thus when one hears ringing in the ears, it is an external envoy entering.

The cloud attendants strike chimes and bells to sound the nine palaces, alerting to outside visitors and preparing defense. The chimes and bells cause the ringing in the ears.

Those who hear this should cover their ears with crossed hands and chant:

The infant is in the palace, nine truths in the chamber, please heed the divine command, forever watch for misfortune, Yellow Great One flowing fire, extinguish all calamities.

After the chant, pat the ear gates twenty-seven times. One will feel warmth on the face—an auspicious sign. If coldness is felt in the head, neck, or nape, it is evil qi entering; one must immediately lie down, close eyes, hold the Mysterious Elixir Palace Supreme One True Lord in mind, ring the flowing fire bell brightly and cast it out, causing evil qi to leave the body, fire light following behind, shining brightly to illuminate the whole body, and after a while all calms.

If suddenly one hears the sound of rushing water, thunder and lightning, and drumbeats, it means the body is overworked, the heart organ severely damaged, unable to taste the true essence of birth, indulging in chaos and disorder, causing the six organs to lose control, soul and spirit wailing. This is the sign of impending illness and death.

Therefore, when the Mud Pellet loses control, the nine palaces become irregular, sorrow and disturbance overturn, drums sound in confusion, and the body wishes to abandon its residence and forsake the whole form.

Those who hear this should diligently contemplate the Supreme One True Lord, return from confusion, focus the true heart. If the sin is not deep, one may hear and reform.

The cause of deafness is the loss of the ear spirit.

The ear is the Emperor Lord’s gate of hearing; the eye is the Sun and Moon of the Supreme One; the nose is the hill and mountain of the Three Primordials; the mouth is the vermilion abyss of the Crimson Palace; the eyebrows are the white origin’s floral canopy; the hair is the bright hall’s forest essence; the tongue is the dragon shaft of the primordial hero; the teeth are the mighty blades of the stomach palace; the hands are the external aid of the gall spirit; the feet are the spirit gate of the kidney origin; the yin extremes are the true mechanism of the Cavern Room.

The one body has a hundred gods, each with their assigned domain; one must not neglect or be careless.

If suddenly one hears golden sounds and jade tones, true qi has entered, the Dao desires to be completed.

If one hears string music, the six dings and jade maidens come to guard; all are signs that the Dao is about to be fulfilled.

One should be silent and focused, cultivating with increasing diligence.

Thus true persons gradually manifest visible form.

If not your master, do not speak to others.

If suddenly one hears flute and horn sounds, it is an auspicious sign of noble arrival.

If one hears shouting and yelling, it is an ominous sign of lowly arrival.

If the nose smells foul qi, there must be lingering filth, an impurity not yet cleansed; thus the foul qi reveals it.

One must immediately bathe, burn incense, and clean the sleeping chamber to respond; this is the Emperor Lord’s warning and admonition.

If one smells fragrant qi, it means spirit officials and spirits are beside you, observing your condition.

At such times, one should perform good deeds, practice virtue and kindness, rescue the poor and distressed, spread merit, and show compassion.

The spirit officials and spirits will report your goodness or evil to the Supreme One.

The Dao’s subtlety cannot be neglected; all such signs are like these.

If you smell fragrant qi, do not tell others unless you are a master.

If you smell foul qi, you should inform others to reveal your sin and defilement.

If you smell blood qi or see unexplained blood gathering, it is a sign of war and misfortune.

Immediately hide in the human world, guard the Three Primordial Emperors for help, and fast for three months; calamity will cease.

These are all warnings from the Emperor Lord to alert people to good and bad, to make them fear and guard their fortune.

When seeing ominous signs, one should perform hidden virtue, cultivate kindness and rescue others, doing what others cannot do, what practitioners cannot do, to avoid the certain signs of death.

You must strive, not merely maintain the status quo.

Above the eyebrows, inward three parts is the Guard Inch Twin Fields; inward one inch is the Bright Hall Palace; inward two inches is the Cavern Room Palace; inward three inches is the Dan Tian Palace; inward four inches is the Flowing Pearl Palace; inward five inches is the Jade Emperor Palace.

One inch above the Bright Hall is the Heavenly Court Palace; one inch above the Cavern Room is the Supreme True Palace; one inch above the Dan Tian is the Mysterious Elixir Palace; one inch above the Flowing Pearl Palace is the Great Emperor Palace.

Altogether the head contains nine palaces.

The scriptures of the Bright Hall, Cavern Room, Dan Tian, and Flowing Pearl four palaces are all the Dao of immortals and true persons, transmitted to the world.

The Mysterious Elixir Palace scripture is also the essential words of the true officials governing fate, the leading sect of the four palaces.

This scripture must be granted by the Supreme Ultimate Emperor Lord; only then is it given, sometimes orally.

Those who combine the five palaces’ Dao and practice it in the world, with true names, have encountered it.

Those without the proper bone structure and fate do not hear these words.

There is also the Jade Emperor Palace, where the Jade Pure Spirit Mother dwells.

There is the Heavenly Court Palace, where the Supreme Purity True Maiden dwells.

There is the Supreme True Palace, where the Supreme Ultimate Emperor’s Consort dwells.

There is the Great Emperor Palace, where the Supreme Lord and Lady dwell.

These four palaces are all Female True One, the Dao higher than Male True One.

They also have treasure scriptures, passed only to those who have already become true persons; those not yet true do not hear them.

The essentials of Female True One are also not given.

The Supreme One thus issues the Eight Extreme Scenes, entering the jade chariot, three thousand jade maidens attending true persons, spirit consorts singing chivalrously, divine queens holding scarves—these truly guard the Female One Dao, used to gather the mysterious dawn.

This is the root of the Supreme One, passed down by the Void Emperor.

These four palaces all have people, but those who do not cultivate this Dao have empty palaces.

If one does not fully cultivate the nine palaces, the palaces are empty—not only the four Female palaces.

As for the Dan Tian Palace, there is always an Emperor Lord; the Guard Inch always has great gods, never absent; only cultivation reveals their presence.

Those who cultivate are immortals; those who do not, live and die.

Male and Female True One gods can both be cultivated; none are absent.

Only by decisively refining essence and bitter effort does one gain benefit.

The way of guarding the Mysterious Elixir Supreme One True Lord:

At evening rest, remove all thoughts, sit or lie as you wish, first hold the North Pole Star Purple Qi, descending into your Mysterious Elixir Palace; soon the palace fills, overflowing beyond the body, surrounding the body, connecting inside and out, merging with the purple qi.

Then hold the sun entering the Mysterious Elixir Palace; the sun fills the palace, in the purple qi center, looking like a fire pearl in the dark.

Then hold the Supreme Ultimate Yellow Great One True Lord, descending from the North Pole purple qi, entering the sun center of the Mysterious Elixir Palace, sitting.

The lord named Rule Hero, styled Transform Mysterious, wears the same clothes and appearance as above.

Then hold your own body, suddenly rising, entering the sun center of the Mysterious Elixir Palace, sitting opposite the Supreme One True Lord, clothes and appearance as you wish.

From the heart arises repeated bows and kneeling, asking the Dao, seeking immortality freely.

Then hold and swallow purple qi thirty times, then swallow saliva thirty times.

Then hold the Northern Dipper Seven Stars, with one red qi as large as a string, straight down into the Mysterious Elixir Palace.

Then the Supreme One Lord and you ride the sun, enter the red qi path, ascend directly to the Northern Dipper Leader, rest and sleep a long while.

Since that sleep, true responses arise.

After fourteen years of practice, you roam with the Supreme One, reaching the tether of the Seven Origins.

After eighteen years, you visit the Supreme Purity Palace, receive scriptures and talismans, command eighteen jade youths and eighteen jade maidens.

One night one holds this only a few times, do not let it lapse.

One may also specialize in this Dao, not necessarily guarding the Three Ones.

Combined, it enhances essence, quickly producing response.

On the first, third, seventh, eleventh, and fifteenth nights of the month, at midnight, hold the Supreme One True Lord in the Mysterious Elixir Palace, sitting facing outward, mouth emitting blue qi, descending into your mouth, you swallow fifty times, then swallow saliva fifty times.

Then softly chant:

Supreme One True Yellow, Central Yellow Purple Lord, named Rule Hero, styled Transform Mysterious, golden bed jade curtains, purple embroidered brocade skirt, belt with fire bells, cutting evil and destroying treachery, holding star essence in hand, born at the neck, sitting upright, emitting qi, making me swallow, speaking with me, feasting in the Mysterious Elixir, refining and washing the seven souls, harmonizing the three spirits, spirits and gods guarding, making me fly immortal, five viscera self-generating, returning to white youthful face, receiving scriptures of Supreme Purity, commanding fate officials, fulfilling wishes and desires, all blessings renewed.

Then hold yourself entering the palace, resting before the Supreme One.

Using this to sleep, one will dream of marvelous response.

By day doing this repeatedly, stages of meeting gradually arise.

## Four Palaces of the Female True One, Inner Divine Treasure Names and Jade Secrets

All who study the Shangqing Dao but do not know the inner names of Female True One will never attain immortality.

Students receive the master’s secret words, then practice.

On New Year’s Day, the first day of the month, and the Tai Sui’s birth day, enter the chamber facing east, contemplate and hold in mind the Jade Pure Spirit Mother, surname Lian, named Jing, styled Huangyan, nine inches nine fen tall, wearing the mysterious yellow primordial spirit sash, head adorned with seven-string pearl jade bun, crowned with the Infinite Worthy Progress Crown, dwelling above all, in the Supreme Ultimate Vermilion Palace, the Seven Treasures Mansion, Five Spirits Village, Mysterious Origin Lane, governing below the omen body’s Jade Emperor Palace.

The Shangqing True Maiden, surname Jue, named Hui, styled Bi Zhan, six inches six fen tall, wearing blue treasure divine light embroidered frost gauze nine-color sash, head adorned with jade treasure flying cloud bun, crowned with mysterious yellow worthy progress crown, dwelling above all, in the Supreme Kunlun Supreme Hidden Palace, Bright Hall Mansion, Nine Light Village, Great Transformation Lane, governing below the omen body’s Heavenly Court Palace.

The Supreme Ultimate Emperor’s Consort, surname Xuan, named Xusheng, styled Bo Wu, seven inches seven fen tall, wearing mysterious gauze flowing light five-color phoenix pattern sash, head adorned with seven treasures mysterious cloud bun, crowned with Infinite Worthy Progress Crown, dwelling above the primordial scene, in the Supreme Purity Supreme Mysterious Palace, Jade Room Mansion, Three Dan Village, Dan Origin Lane, governing below the omen body’s Supreme True Palace.

The Supreme Lord and Lady, surname Qian, named Hanhai, styled He Yansheng, three inches three fen tall, wearing seven treasures flying essence mysterious light cloud brocade frost gauze nine-color sash, head adorned with nine mysteries jade essence drooping cloud bun, crowned with mysterious yellow infinite three-treasure jade crown, dwelling above the Supreme Purity Nine Mysteries, Cavern Origin Supreme True Palace, Dan Essence Mansion, Cloud Light Village, Mysterious Mysterious Lane, governing below the omen body’s Great Emperor Palace.

When practicing the Dao of the Mysterious Elixir, guarding the Three Ones secret, one must always guard the four palaces of Female True One spirits, their clothing, form, name, and dwelling place.

This upper chapter of the treasure scripture is passed only to those who have become true persons; beginners must not hear or see it.

Its essentials are secret within the primordial spirit, not practiced in the world.

All who receive the Shangqing method and Three Treasures Divine Scriptures, though penetrating spirit and exploring subtlety, if ignorant of the Female True One method, will never succeed.

Therefore the Supreme One marks its grave prohibition, forbidding light disclosure, not recorded on paper or ink.

Those who have it should carefully examine their inner heart before receiving.

On New Year’s Day, the first day of the month, and the Tai Sui’s birth day, bathe and fast, burn incense, enter the chamber facing east, hold in mind the four palaces of Female True One spirits, their dwelling, names, clothing colors, and heights as above.

Afterward, tap teeth thirty-six times and chant:

True Female Spirit, named Female Spirit, transforming scene of nine mysteries, riding truth hidden and dark, day auspicious sky bright, reporting fasting to Supreme Purity, heart focused, eyes watching, cavern reflecting spirit form, returning to guard the palace, jade flower fragrance full, five colors changing, flowing yellow, purple, blue, directing flying rosy clouds, ascending to the Emperor’s court.

Finished, swallow qi thirty-six times, then stop.

After nine years of this, the face produces jade flowers, golden truth reflects light, spirit manifests form, converses with the omen.

Once you see the spirit, know it, do not recklessly transmit.

These four palaces of Female True One spirits are the primordial born yin officials, titled Emperor Consorts.

Their primordial qi not yet established, five constants unheard, light and scene not yet connected, infinite void, no above or below, no outside or inside, no left or right, no front or back, Supreme One’s primordial essence, mysterious beginning’s marvelous truth, prior to ultimate void, condensing qi and solidifying, mixing and transforming myriad things, Heaven and Earth preserved—all through the four truths.

Those who can sincerely hold them in mind will not know old age for a thousand years; within the Nine Heavens, myriad gods share longevity.

This Supreme Treasure Chapter was transmitted to the Great Emperor Lord, who transmitted it to the Heavenly Emperor Lord, who transmitted it to the Taiwei Heavenly Emperor Lord, who transmitted it to the Golden Gate Emperor Lord, who transmitted it to the Eastern Sea Blue Youth, appointed to control famous mountains and summon the Five Great Mountains.

Written in vermilion on white, worn on the left elbow, avoid filth.

Primordial Beginning issues order, proclaiming to myriad spirits, Supreme True Emperor Chapter, born with qi, governing below, all return to Upper Purity; if any do not obey, capture true forms, seal mountains and summon seas, order to destroy and topple, quickly come to submit, no delays allowed, swift as the proper law, no crossing the dark.

Finished, swallow thirty-six qi, then stop.

## Supreme Great Cavern Guarding the One Inner Scripture and Methods

The Supreme One said: The true person values the One as True One, supreme above all.

The One’s accord is the Great Void’s transformation, the One’s change and communication is the Heaven and Earth’s dark union.

Therefore, the Upper One is the Heaven Emperor of the one body, the Middle One is the Dan Emperor of the Crimson Palace, the Lower One is the Origin King of the Yellow Court.

The Three Ones truly govern and command the twenty-four qi within the body.

Qi receives life; life establishes the one body, responding above to Taiwei’s twenty-four truths.

True qi circulates harmoniously, forming shapes of things, mysterious spirits mixing and dividing, the Purple Room dim and dark.

Qi condenses from spirit smoke to form spirit.

Spirit relies on the Three Ones to rule itself.

Transformation is the work of the Three Ones; all transformation is by spirit self-concealing, mixing yellow and forming, attaining the ultimate mystery.

Each Three One Lord has true qi; true qi condenses to form thousands of chariots and ten thousand riders, cloud carriages and feathered canopies, always entering inward to the Purple Palace, ascending to Jade Purity, listing talismans and primordial diagrams, cutting the embryo and guarding the fetus.

The Three Ones nurture the body to become true persons, flying through the nine heavens, serving the Most High.

Thus the One’s accomplishment is born of Heaven and Earth, not merely small movements.

If you can guard it firmly, essence will respond freely.

If essence responds freely, the Three Primordials become visible.

If the Three Primordials become visible, white qi thickens and changes.

If white qi thickens and changes, mixed division self-generates.

Mixed division self-generates thousands of chariots and ten thousand riders, suddenly arriving.

Then feathered canopies may be ridden, cloud carriages mounted, and you ascend by day to Heaven, reaching Taiwei.

This is the mysterious merit of the Three Ones, the meeting place of essence and response.

Within Taiwei are twenty-four qi, mixed yellow and gathered, condensing qi and transforming; sometimes suddenly dividing, awakening and giving birth.

Within transformed qi are twenty-four true persons, condensing void to generate form, not born from womb, all caused by the Three One Emperor Lord’s qi, dividing paths and transforming, relying on mystery to establish scenes.

If you can guard the Three Ones within the body, then the Three Primordial Emperor Lords of Taiwei will descend and appear outside, speaking face to face with you.

Within the body are also twenty-four true persons, formed by the body’s mysterious qi essence spirit, dividing and transforming to create myriad beings.

If the cloud carriage is delivered, combined qi of dawn and scene, ascending to Taiwei.

The twenty-four true persons of Taiwei all unite with the body’s spirits, feasting together in the mixed yellow, sharing scenes within the Purple Room, relying on form qi in myriad paths, returning old mugwort to become infant, changing death register at the Northern Feng, receiving long life in the Emperor’s homeland, entering and exiting Jade Purity, resting at Taiwei.

Also practice the matters of Emperor One, Supreme One Five Gods, and the affairs of Three, Five, Seven, Nine; those who practice all find the One God’s response easy.

The Purple Room must guard the One as root; guarding the One must have the Purple Room as canopy; thus the three ones and three pure forms must be together, and the Purple Room’s six harmonies await.

Though they dwell separately, their function of achieving the One is all fulfilled.

If you think well and hold it, the Three Ones’ matters are complete.

If you receive only one path, the Three Primordials are incomplete; but focusing the mind on One, you may still attain longevity and immortality, entering Supreme Purity but not roaming Taiwei’s heavens, nor ascending the Upper Purity Palace.

The Upper One Truth Emperor is the utmost; the Middle One True Emperor is supreme; the Lower One King is marvelous.

The Heavenly Emperor attains the utmost, thus becoming the Emperor of the Pole.

The Earthly Emperor attains the supreme, thus becoming the True One.

The Human Emperor attains the marvelous, thus becoming the Lord of myriad marvels.

The Three Emperors embody truth to guard the One; thus the One hides no form.

Immortals seek truth to find the One; thus the Three Ones all shine.

The One hides no form; its truth is utmost.

The Three Ones all shine; to obtain the One is enough.

The truth having reached utmost, the Three Ones shining, obtaining the One gives birth.

Those who guard truth and One must make the heart quiet and spirit concentrated, body focused to seek response, so that a hundred thoughts do not wander, essence and intention do not scatter.

Within three months of inner vision, focusing the mind on one spirit, the spirit light transforms and generates, entwining the five viscera.

Thus focusing without scattering, specially directing qi to harmony, from firmness to utmost, is the effect of obtaining the One.

If false flowers arise, competing thoughts and confusion, the One will not fully respond, spirit will not immediately answer; not for lack of desire to go, but because the holder is not focused, the thinker not careful, thus years of effort pass without clarity.

If one can make the heart reach distant response, focus the mind without other thoughts, three months of diligent thought is not necessary, mixing with the One suffices.

The Supreme One said: The Three Primordials are the jade truths of the Nine Heavens, the correct Dao of the Upper Truth.

The root of the embryo is born, stored in the six directions; thus the True One Great Dao issues the True Emperor, the correct Dao of mysterious truth gives birth to the great god, separating and joining the Five Elders, myriad transformations suddenly formed.

When the Three Primordials resolve and transform, the One is born.

Thus transformation qi spreads and condenses, spirit becomes efficacious, myriad truths return to One, and mysterious merit is completed.

This is the ancestor of the correct Dao, the root and origin of primordial qi.

Scatter it into nothingness, white qi vanishes and joins; nourish it in form, and life is long-lasting.

The method of the Three Ones observes the Dao perfected in the Three Primordials; its Dao is marvelous, summing the spirit texts, Heaven, Man, and Immortal Emperors, holding the treasured divine scriptures.

The first marvel is the *Great Cavern True Scripture Thirty-Nine Chapters*; the second rare text is Female One Combined Transformation, called *Great Abundance Marvelous Scripture*; the third jade secret is the True Cavern Mysterious Scripture, Three Five Seven Nine, called *Supreme Primordial Spirit*.

Therefore, the Upper One Emperor Lord treasures the *Great Cavern True Scripture*, the Middle One Dan Emperor treasures the *Female One Marvelous Scripture*, the Lower One Origin King keeps the secret *Primordial Spirit Mysterious Great Abundance Marvelous Scripture*.

These are the names of Three Five, the utmost essence of the true Dao, the supreme chapter of the Three Ones, the secret prohibitions of Jade Purity, the secret chapters of the Supreme One.

If the omen guards the Three Ones and obtains our three scriptures, then one may ride clouds to ascend Supreme Purity, contemplate endlessly, roam and feast in the Purple Court, subtle and profound, difficult to express in writing.

Guarding the One gives birth to the Three Ones.

Since you have obtained the One, you have obtained this scripture.

Guarding the Three Ones’ method is the first chapter of the true book of the Golden Gate Emperor Lord of Supreme Purity, the jade Dao of the Supreme One, the crossing of immortals, the marvelous secret of myriad truths.

If you can guard the One, the One will guard you.

If you can see the One, the One will see you.

The One must stand with the body; the body must act with the One.

Your body’s advance and retreat, myriad matters, always think of the One.

When eating and drinking, think of the One.

In joy and sorrow, think of the One.

In illness, think of the One.

In danger, think of the One.

When walking on water or fire, think of the One.

In urgent moments, think of the One.

In gestures and gaze, thoughts are many.

Thoughts must be focused; without focus there is no hope.

Many have will but not firmness; firmness cannot last.

Knowing the name of the One but not guarding it; guarding but not firm in will; will without bitterness.

Thoughts are boundless, many have original heart.

Some know the Dao of One but cannot always guard it.

Thus when the Three Ones leave, correct qi departs.

Losing correct qi causes old qi to rise; old qi rising means death is near.

Common people learning Dao seek superficial splendor, not valuing true One.

At first they have will, later they falter.

All because the will is not one, evil qi enters.

The warning of guarding One is to avoid distraction; distraction does not last; lasting does not see essence; essence cannot be firm; firm but not constant, then Three Ones leave, body is empty house.

Empty house has no master; what harm lasts?

The Supreme One said: Qi condenses into essence, essence responds into spirit, spirit transforms into infant, infant rises to true person, true person ascends to infant—this is true One.

The Supreme One said: Heaven has three lights, the sun, moon, and stars, also called three essences, used for longevity.

Man has three treasures, three Dan Tian, also called three truths, used for eternal existence.

The Spirit Treasure Scripture says: Heaven essence, Earth truth, Three Treasures always exist; this is what it means.

The Supreme One said: Between the eyebrows is the upper Dan Tian; heart crimson palace is the middle Dan Tian; three inches below the navel is the lower Dan Tian; these three Dan Tian combined.

The infant dwells in the upper Dan Tian palace, true person in the middle Dan Tian palace, infant in the lower Dan Tian palace.

Above the eyebrows, inward one inch is the Bright Hall; inward two inches is the Cavern Room; inward three inches is the Dan Tian Mud Pellet Palace.

Inward means from the face backward to the top and back.

The Dan Tian Mud Pellet Palace is square, one inch on each side.

Hold purple qi rising to Heaven; within purple qi is a sun image, nine inches in diameter, shining over ninety thousand li.

My form changes size, appearing and disappearing; suddenly forgetting the body, yet still in awareness.

Both sit facing outward or facing each other.

The Upper Emperor Lord chants:

Profound Mud Pellet, life’s body guardian, Supreme One guards the register, Upper Origin solidifies spirit, Heaven’s constant true qi, nurturing form to become immortal.

Finished.

The palace where the Upper dwells guards the Mud Pellet, face, eyes, mouth, tongue, teeth, ears, nose, hair boundary; outside, awe and terror dispel the six heavens’ myriad ghosts and evil demons.

Within the omen body are three souls and seven spirits; every five days they come to court the Upper Origin Emperor One, receiving the mixed birth mixed qi Dao.

The heart is the middle Dan Tian, called the Crimson Palace, guarding the heart’s center, square one inch on each side, vermilion smoke reaching Heaven.

Within vermilion smoke is a sun image, seven inches in diameter, shining over seventy thousand li.

My form changes, appearing and disappearing; suddenly forgetting the body, yet still in awareness.

The Crimson Palace heart Dan Tian palace is where the Middle One Dan Emperor dwells.

To his right is the assistant imperial minister, representing the five viscera spirits, formed from combined qi, suddenly born.

Entering the Crimson Palace is the assistant imperial minister, named Middle Light Firm, styled Four Transform Spirit, also called Hidden Cart Elder, also called Dong Historian Splendor.

These two govern the Crimson Palace heart together, naked and without clothes, appearing as newborn infants.

The Dan Emperor holds in his left hand a glowing pearl the size of a chicken egg at its center; his right hand holds the Female One Supreme Talisman, placed in a white jade box.

The assistant imperial minister holds in his left hand a bright moon pearl, three inches in diameter, shining clearly.

Both sit facing outward or facing each other.

The Dan Emperor chants:

Five viscera shining bright, born from qi, Supreme Eight Scenes, contemplating the heart court, Middle One Emperor, protecting life and peace.

Finished.

Inside guards the muscles, bones, five viscera, flesh and blood; outside dispels myriad evil and misfortune, nurturing qi and calming spirit, long life and clear vision, flying immortal to Supreme Purity, matching Heaven’s utmost.

Within the omen body are three souls and seven spirits; every seven days they come to court the Middle One Dan Emperor, receiving dividing and dispersing qi, mixing the fetal spirit’s scene.

Three inches below the navel is called the Life Gate Dan Tian Palace; the Lower Origin infant dwells within, palace square one inch on each side.

White qi rises to Heaven; within white qi is a sun image, five inches in diameter, shining over fifty thousand li.

The omen form changes, appearing and disappearing; suddenly forgetting form, yet still in awareness.

Finished.

The Lower One Lord holds in his left hand the Great White Star, holding it like a chicken egg, pure white; in his right hand holds the *Primordial Spirit Mysterious
