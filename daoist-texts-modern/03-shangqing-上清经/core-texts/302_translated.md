### Scroll One of The Cavernous Truth: Supreme Most High Great Expanse Jade Script

**The Jade Empress of the Purple Tenuity Composes the Imperial Chapter of the Jade Script**

The Cloud Service Son is said to be the scion of the Primordial Sovereign of Jade Emptiness, the middle son of the Supreme Emperor. He embraced the jade embryo within the jade chamber, condensed cloud essence at the golden gate, contained sun and moon within the purple membrane, transformed great dew to solidify spirit, refined embryonic breath to propel movement, bore kalpas to rotate the wheel, transformed and gave birth within the Yuan clan, announced to the yang path to perfect truth. Thus, on the first day of the third month in the first year of the Supreme Sovereign, as Heaven’s radiance opened the dawn, he was born above the Nine Profound Mysteries, in the immeasurable treasure-radiance of Heaven. He beheld the sun upon the cloud cliff, shone with golden countenance in the jade pavilion, followed the imperial foundation in the emperor’s plan, patterned jade elegance in nature, washed by the nine numinous rays, irrigated by sweet fragrant jade springs, drank the spirit consort’s imperial ganoderma, nursed on nine-refined flying frost, with divine dragons winging his sides, jade phoenix shading his crown, purple smoke rising above him, flowing light luxuriant in the neighborhood. Two symbols upheld his framework; three dawns harmonized his truth; the Divine Land sang his marvel; seven transformations altered his spirit; numinous winds sped his body; returning fragrance stirred his dust. On high in the Great Void, by the shore of the harmonious waves, the sound of the flute echoed softly. At the age of eighteen, pondering the subtle and meditating on the profound, he adapted nature’s principle, moved with time’s flow, shunning imperial ways, roaming freely in the Central Plain, delighting in the Great Expanse, wandering the Purple Heaven, flashing through kalpas, attaining the path of forgetfulness, moving beyond self’s control, standing forth as an exalted immortal. Thus named the Imperial Script Emperor’s Register, his rank ascended to Supreme Truth, teaching the Three Origins below, bestowed the imperial scroll. At that time, he received the mandate, performed court rites at the Jade Heaven, ascended the Nine Profound Mystery Platform, the Palace of Great Abundance, the Purple Phoenix Jade Capital, the Seven Treasures Vermilion Chamber, within the Pavilion of Radiant Clouds, the Pure Fasting Jade Veranda, the Spirit’s Endowment announced and responded, his neck bore a round radiance, at night illuminating the divine candles, self-illuminating the jade hall.

Then the Void Sovereign Dao Lord, upon the empty cavern, within the profound mystery, by the *Great Expanse Jade Script Imperial Chapter*, descended and bestowed it upon the ruler. At that time, heavenly light darkened and spread, the three dawns returned essence, the five constellations altered their courses, the seven origins moved spirit, nine colors flashed and shone, illuminating the jade clarity, flying smoke thickened and luxuriated, flowing through the eight abysses. Ascending the jade steps, myriad emperors gathered in court, flying immortals bore feathered canopies, assisting the Supreme Truth, immortal boys and jade maidens, each commanding a thousand attendants, holding scarves scattering incense, spreading fragrance sweeping dust. Then the imperial carriage was summoned, commanding the five spirits, flying through the expanse, circling the wheel, riding the empty woven smoke, divine phoenix holding the reins, spirit consort guiding the immortals, the Bright Emperor opening the path, three ways merging in brilliance, flowing lightning raising essence, the swift carriage traversing the Nine Profound Mysteries, roaming the jade palaces, feasting in the three origins, circling the jade expanse, roaming freely the purple dawn.

Thus, unfolding the Jade Script upon the boundless cliff, chanting the imperial chapter amidst the azure clouds, managing the root of destiny through the jade formula, commanding awe-inspiring spirits with the jade text, singing wondrous melodies in the cavern, meditating in the jade pavilion, governing yin and yang by the profound diagram, holding the imperial register among myriad immortals, overseeing the earth’s offices at the Five Sacred Mountains, leading the Supreme Truth through the Three Passes, commanding the boundless above, subduing the cavernous source below. From Heaven downwards, none but the Supreme Truth is not subject. The spirit is unfathomable, transformation nameless, the near hard to discuss, the distant impossible to seek, clarity hard to pollute, chaos hard to clarify, subtle and wondrous indeed! This is the imperial spirit of utmost virtue, majestic and exalted.

The Great Expanse Jade Script is the celestial melody of the Nine Heavens’ Kings flying through the expanse; the Imperial Chapter of the Jade Script is the writing above the Nine Heavens. Born at the primal origin of the Yuan Beginning, emerging within the natural cavern, the Void Sovereign Jade Emperor received it from the Nine Profound Mysteries. Thus the heavenly kings recorded their names, cast gold into slips, carved jade into chapters, gold threads and jade characters to illuminate the precious text. Secreted above the Nine Heavens, in the Palace of Great Abundance, the Western Flower Jade Maidens and Golden Dawn Jade Boys, each numbering three thousand, attend and guard incense. Thus the nine emperors, supreme sages, ascend the jade steps thrice monthly, court and feast with divine truths, cycling through myriad kalpas, passing down to the Supreme Truth King. Their way is lofty and subtle, the source of all scriptures, spirits towering and elegant, essence crowning the Nine Heavens, jade grace bright and clear, penetrating the cavernous mystery. Unless one is a Supreme True person, one may not partake or hear; all are granted to those already perfected, not passed to middling immortals. The Great Expanse Jade Script is the melody of the Nine Heavens’ Kings flying the expanse; the Imperial Chapter of the Jade Script is the way of high numinous mystery, the essence of the Nine Heavens, overseeing myriad energies, commanding all scriptures. Anyone cultivating the *Great Cavern Thirty-Nine Chapters*, blending winds to unite with the imperial one, or the *Female One Jade Inspection Five Elders’ Precious Scripture*, explaining the root of destiny and extracting the seven mysteries, without this text, the Nine Heavens’ Kings will not accept their sound, the nine energies entangled, spirits displeased, heavenly demons invading the light, myriad trials obstructing, thoughts not penetrating the subtle, Heaven not opening the gates. All scriptures begin with the Jade Script, chanting in the silent chamber, quietly celebrating the rosy court, freely traversing the Nine Heavens, arranging and concluding the Supreme Mystery, startling the jade palace’s listeners, myriad true ones arriving at the veranda, demons subdued, myriad trials dared not advance. Whatever one cultivates, only then is the Way attained in truth, all scriptures perfected, body soaring to the Great Clarity. The essential secret is not complicated; it lies precisely in this scripture. With focused heart and diligent practice, one may overcome even the highest immortals.

The Cloud Service Son did not cultivate other ways; he received the Void Sovereign Dao Lord’s *Great Expanse Jade Script Imperial Chapter* above the Nine Heavens, singing wondrous verses, roaming and delighting freely, stirring and moving the divine truths, attaining the Three Origins’ lower teachings, one rank ascending to Supreme Truth King. He transmitted it to the True Person of Taihua, the Three Heavens’ Longevity Lord, the True Person of Taihe, the Old Master of Donghua, the Southern Pole’s Chief Commander, the Western Terrace Middle Marquis, the Northern Emperor’s Middle True, the Nine Spirit Princes, the Supreme Spirit Consort, the Red Essence Jade Boy, the Profound Valley Master, the Southern Mountain Red Pine, the Zhongshan King Qiao, the True Person of Ziyang, the Western City Lord, the Central Emperor Master, Zhao Boxuan, and Shan Zhongzong—eighteen persons in all—who all cultivated this way, their faces radiant with golden countenance, necks bearing round radiance, riding the void ascending the heavens, feasting in the purple court, transforming in myriad directions, roaming freely, how they pleased soaring, calling commands and standing firm, summoning myriad spirits, subduing legions of demons, deciding life and death, riding the expanse and riding the smoke, entering and exiting the imperial court—all by means of the Jade Script, to reach the Supreme Truth. The King Lord now enshrines a single pass within Western City Mountain, where a golden-named imperial register lies, characters green and purple clear. Those who are true persons shall obtain this text. Those who obtain it hold a precious secret; do not rashly transmit it. To leak the numinous chapters brings the Nine Ancestors to trial, filling the ranks of ghost officials, eternally confined in hell, never to be pardoned through myriad kalpas.

The Nine Heavens’ Nine Kings are the root ancestors of myriad energies and emperors, the primal source of the nine energies. Before Heaven and Earth condensed, before the three luminaries shone, they formed naturally within the cavernous void, in the vast abyss, passing through ninety thousand kalpas, dividing energies to govern each, establishing the Nine Heavens. The sun, moon, and stars shine there; myriad energies flow and evolve, forming the true Way. The Yuan Beginning Supreme Sovereign and the High Supreme Jade Emptiness, born at the beginning of Heaven, with thirty-nine emperors and twenty-four true ones, established palace orders and offices. The Supreme Sovereign’s precious scriptures all follow natural chapters to act. The way of longevity, the method of immortality, talismans, and jade formulas all arise from the Nine Heavens’ Kings, passed down through generations of the true. At the change of the three and five eras, the Nine Spirits respond in time. Later sages of the Nine Profound Dao Lords collated the original texts, traversing ninety trillion nine thousand repeated kalpas. The Supreme Sovereign’s regulations often do not correspond. The Dao Lord, on the first day of the ninth month of the first year of the Central Emperor, at the Jade Heaven’s jade chamber and golden palace, commanded the Eastern Flower Azure Palace to seek the pattern of rise and fall, to collate ancient texts, revise and compile the spiritual chapters, gathering three hundred precious scriptures, entrusting the Supreme Minister Azure Youth Lord to transmit to later learners of jade name and true union. Those who seek immortality without knowing the source of the Way, born from treasured formulas, learning in darkness without ancestors, the true will not descend, and the Way will not proceed. Those who desire immortality should seek the root of the Nine Heavens, obtain its original yuan, and the Way will be complete, immortality will be achieved. But the Nine Heavens’ Kings’ secret taboo names are hidden above the Nine Heavens in the Palace of Great Abundance, not passed to later generations. There is a mysterious imperial register, with gold characters of Supreme Clarity, which, when the time and meeting arise, reveals the Nine Heavens’ Kings’ names. The Heavenly Kings then dispatch twelve jade boys and nine jade maidens to attend and guard the destined body. Following the ritual of fasting for ninety days or nine days, bearing nine taels of superior gold and ninety chi of purple patterns, swearing the Nine Heavens’ trust, one may then receive the master’s transmission and oath. Do not lightly reveal the numinous secrets; otherwise, the seven ancestors will be examined, eternally consigned to ghostly servitude, bearing stone burdens and mountain labors, body perishing under the Three Officials’ judgment, never to become immortal.

Anyone cultivating this Way should observe the eight seasonal segments of their destiny, bathing and fasting, entering the chamber at the proper time, facing east, knocking teeth nine times, looking up to the Nine Heavens above, beneath the nine-colored flying clouds and flowing light, lush within the chamber, quietly calling the Nine Heavenly Kings’ taboo names, preserving thoughts of the true spirits, then reciting the Great Expanse Jade Script Imperial Chapter’s nine chapters once, to celebrate the expanse court, spirits rejoice in the silent chamber, numinous responses from the Nine Profound Mysteries. Following the ritual for nine years, one may ride the flying radiance, feasting in the purple dawn.

If descending to roam the Nine Heavens, observing the days of the myriad immortals’ mysterious assemblies, as above in the pure fasting, each recites once at their appointed time, then the Nine Heavens record the names, right beside the Supreme Truth; after nine years no loss occurs. One may attain the highest immortality.

The imperial chapters are all born from the Nine Heavens’ primordial essence, the Nine Heavens’ Kings’ hidden treasure names, talismans, and jade formulas all fully expressed within. Wearing this text, one is true with the Nine Heavens, myriad spirits bow, groups of immortals guard and welcome, commanding and restraining heavenly demons, entering and exiting without fixed places, riding clouds and driving the void, roaming and feasting in the great void. This text is subtle and wondrous, the clan of myriad emperors. Those who understand this secret become immortal kings. Those who leak or lightly transmit it die serving the nine abyss, calamity reaching the seven ancestors, filling the river source through myriad kalpas. Be cautious and faithfully practice.

The two hundred forty phonemes of the Jade Script Imperial Chapter are all the primordial essence of the Nine Heavens, the names of myriad true ones. They should be carved on jujube heartwood, received from the pure spring of the remote cliff, applied to flying gauze scarves, facing north swearing to the Nine Heavens, receiving the Nine Heavens’ chapter. The disciple holds nine taels of superior gold, ninety chi of purple patterns, faces south prostrating, the master reads the jade script and bestows it upon the disciple. If the carved text and seal are not yet obtained, one may also write with orpiment on blue-green silk, swear and bestow it, then gradually carve the text, ascending the mountain to swear at the Nine Heavens.

If carving the jade script on jujube heartwood, do not hang the seal facing the four directions; place it in a jade box in a separate chamber, facing upright, burning incense and worshiping the Nine Heavens’ Kings morning and evening. To summon the Eastern Peak Immortal Official to inquire about auspices and calamities, and to communicate spirit and truth, one should on the Jia and Yi days read the imperial chapter facing east once; then the Immortal Official arrives, speaking truthfully. To summon the Southern Peak, on Bing and Ding days, similarly, the Southern Peak Immortal Official arrives and communicates truth. To summon the Western Peak, on Geng and Xin days, similarly, the Western Peak Immortal Official arrives and communes truth. To summon the Northern Peak, on Ren and Gui days, similarly, the Northern Peak Immortal Official arrives and communicates truth. To summon the Central Peak, on Wu and Ji days, similarly, the Central Peak Immortal Official arrives and communicates truth. All methods of summoning the Five Sacred Mountains face the proper directions, knocking teeth thirty-six times, then reading the imperial chapter. With focused heart and fasting, spirits all descend. If one is unclean or unrefined, not penetrating mystery, closing eyes and focusing thoughts, one will surely see spirits. One should investigate deeply, discerning auspices and omens, and for nine years be one in form with the true, emerging from emptiness entering the void, roaming and feasting in the jade morning. Those cultivating the Way fully will have true persons descend, cloud carriages and purple canopies come to welcome their destined body. One should imprint the imperial chapter’s seal on the soles of both feet and palms of both hands, instantly forming feathered wings, moving the destined body to ascend likewise. If practicing in quiet places of the Five Sacred Mountains, chanting and reciting, if strange beings impersonate true forms, descending to the destined chamber, one should imprint the imperial chapter’s seal facing them, then truth and falsehood are immediately revealed. If a true immortal official, the destined one will prostrate and welcome, freely petitioning and receiving essential words. If a demon spirit, it will revert to its original form. The destined one should knock teeth thirty-six times, read the imperial chapter once, and the demon will vanish and lose form before the destined one. Such methods require heart and mouth to correspond; do not show others. Revealing to others leaks the truth, and the Way will not proceed. When alone at night, place the imperial chapter upon the heart, and the Great Expanse true immortal will come to guard; the destined one’s form and shadow respond in dreams, speaking with the true, within nine years meeting the true person face to face. Those who receive the imperial chapter’s seal must not rashly reveal it to others; if seen by three persons, the Way departs, and the practice fails. Those cultivating this Way must not lightly tread the impure, offend the true spirits, violating the Nine Heavens’ examinations, losing the destined body. If possessing the mysterious diagram imperial register, green characters and purple script, golden bones and jade marrow, named the Azure Palace, the Nine Heavens will dispatch four supreme true persons to bestow the destined body the jade script imperial chapter. If one has prior affinity and meets a bright master, all will be wondrously coordinated and should receive this text, achieving highest immortality. All should present true gold ribbons of trust, visit the master fasting, and receive cultivation. Without trust and oath, Heaven will not open spirit, the true will not descend, and immortality will not be attained. Masters warn that light leakage brings the seven ancestors to trial, eternally consigned to ghost officials. Be most cautious with the mysterious regulations; do not act rashly.

Those transmitting the *Great Expanse Jade Script Imperial Chapter* should do so in the lofty and tranquil void, placing flying gauze scarves facing north, offerings of incense, cakes, and jujube fruits arranged on a separate plate, the scripture placed atop the flying gauze. The master faces north, knocking teeth thirty-six times, respectfully petitioning the Nine Spirits’ Primordial True Supreme Officials, the Golden Immortals and Jade Maidens, the Great One Spirit, the Supervising True Officials, the Five Emperors and myriad true ones. Now there is Master So-and-So of such mountain and county, purple network forming the membrane, destined to ascend immortality, bearing gold ribbons of trust, seeking to receive the spiritual text, the Nine Heavens’ true taboo Jade Script Imperial Chapter, heavenly laws cautioning carefully, swearing precious spiritual truth, wishing to humbly illuminate the minister below, not daring to leak it, returning to the river source, seven ancestors apologizing, not daring to again ascend immortality. After completion, the master holds the scripture and ritual, the disciple holds the trust, both facing heaven whispering:

“Supreme High Supreme, myriad holy emperors, Five Emperors and Jade Officials, all Immortals, Supervising True Ones, today is auspicious, the eight seasonal and original life, opening and declaring yang sins and yin examinations, utterly extinguishing the nine yins, now beginning to extract the seven mysteries, escaping the fiery realm, forever leaving the mountain of knives, the three paths and five sufferings, not burdening my body, attaining unity with Heaven and Earth, long preserving the imperial dawn, five wishes and eight assemblies, nothing fails as spoken.” Then remove headgear, bow one hundred and twenty times, forehead to earth, but do not cause pain. Then replace headgear, look up to Heaven, heart focused: “Today my body receives Heaven’s grace, returning form and flesh, born to fly as immortal.” Then bow and swallow the twenty-four qi stops. Thus for three years, past faults are all removed, body and truth united, not treading the five sufferings, escaping the fiery realm, able to attain true immortality and roam the destined chamber.
