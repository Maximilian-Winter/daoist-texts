### Scripture of the Profound Transformations of the Supreme Venerable Purple Transcendence Flame Radiance

**Preface to the Purple Transcendence Flame Radiance**

The Purple Transcendence Flame Radiance is not merely the Purple Transcendence Flame Radiance of this text; it is a divine scripture condensed from the void, where primordial qi coalesces into chapters, mysterious light and fiery brilliance reflecting, accumulating over seven thousand years before its words appear. The Supreme Emperor of the Great Microcosm wove its title in purple orchid script, inscribed the main text on golden slips, and recorded it as the *Scripture of the Profound Transformations of the Purple Transcendence Flame Radiance*. The name “Profound Transformations Scripture” arises from transformations within the mysterious. Once the profound chapters existed, the Most High Jade Emperor commanded Golden Morning Jade Boys and Western Flower Jade Maidens, three thousand each, to attend on the text’s left and right, guarding within the Supreme Six Harmonies Purple Chamber. The Primordial Lord of the Southern Pole presides.

**Record of the Supreme Emperor of the Great Microcosm**

The Supreme Emperor of the Great Microcosm was born at the edge of primal azure, his radiance piercing the mystery, qi yet uncondensed at the beginning, forming the pattern of fragrant law and shape. His light connects and illuminates the spirit: purple clouds flashing lightning, mysterious smoke flowing and misting, vermilion brilliance entwining, subtle awakening stirring, still drawing from the highest accord, arranging pure harmony, inhaling and exhaling the dark essence, thus descending as the embryo of living spirits, nourished by the law’s spring and the curved mushroom. At the age of two sevens, his golden countenance blossomed within, jade splendor radiated without, penetrating wisdom and divine acuity, clearly perceiving the void and mystery. He compiled and held the imperial titles, entrusted with the task of purifying the nine heavens’ rosy clouds, soaring to gaze upon the source of profound clarity, discerning the mechanisms at the utmost mystery, needing to coordinate the myriad essences, accumulating responses in the dark assembly, wondrously awakening to nature itself. Thus he attained mastery of the Purple Transcendence Flame Radiance’s method of returning the spirit and soaring to the heavens, cultivating inwardly to respond and ascend to the exalted Jade Pure One, the Most High. The Way was complete and entrusted to the Central Yellow Lord Laozi.

**Three Hymns Composed by the Queen Mother of the West at the Time of Transmitting the Scripture**

Howl and sing on the Nine Mysterious Terraces, cliffs and ridges congeal chill and desolate. The mind’s principle and six senses clear, eyes unclouded, abandoning worldly dregs. Flowing rosy clouds shine in the golden chamber, the empty hall disperses mysterious incense. Accumulated feelings summon spiritual descent, the solitary form flees yet divides. In an instant, glimpsing myriad kalpas, how could one perceive the countless eons?

The elegant garden flourishes the divine steps, vermilion jade and shining jade courts. Flowing winds scatter the empty caverns, jade sounds ride the void’s brightness. Purple smoke entwines curved characters, vermilion brilliance reflects green canopies. Flying banners cluster the mysterious canopy, feathered segments shine with purple clarity. Ascending to the nine heavens’ border, roaming and playing in the Phoenix City. May I receive the honored realm’s son, one joy born together at dawn.

Rein the reins, control the mysterious radiance, the serene scene beyond the wilderness. Wandering seeking the spiritual person, merging form to celebrate the heavenly border. Hands part the vermilion mountain gate, eyes like divine surging peace. The golden palace towers majestic, the clear scene without dust or filth. Loosen the collar on the mysterious high terrace, fitting my good wish to meet. Removing shoes is thrice difficult, preserving refinement strengthens the aged years.

**Within the Purple Transcendence Flame Radiance Is Preserved the Method of Summoning the Boundless Cavern Observation of Heaven**

When the Emperor first formed his shape, he also learned the dao of summoning the true. His thoughts wandered afar, secretly reflecting inward, sitting in observation of the boundless, penetrating the profound void. At the age of three, the central method was precise and upright, true spirits unveiled clearly, counter-knowledge of the not-yet, thoroughly surveying the realm of the utmost heaven. No darkness unreflected, no highest unconnected, no lowest unanticipated. Thus he received the title of Great Emperor, descended by accumulated feeling—how could this be casually assigned?

Always at dawn, before the heavens are bright, when pure radiance begins to emerge, he rubbed his hands together until warm, wiped his eyes and the four corners thirty-seven times, knocked his teeth twenty-four times to open passages, then with his tongue swept inside his mouth, up and down, all around, causing the elixir to arise, swallowing the saliva nine times. Then he covered his body with a translucent cap, settled his form lying down, making the central method precise and upright. He caused inside and outside to be silent, hearing no sound, hands covering ears, eyes closed, inwardly preserving. He saw the eastern realm ninety thousand li away: mountains, rivers, grass, trees, birds, beasts, barbarians, elders—all as if before his eyes, making clear and precise, not wavering, remaining for a long time naturally visible. Once clear, he heard in his ears the ringing of bells and drums, lingering long, then saw the Immortal Official of the Eastern Peak, riding a blue dragon and blue clouds, holding five mushrooms, accompanied by twelve jade maidens wearing flying blue feather skirts, carrying a blue refined jade embryo, held in a golden box, presented to his body. Upon seeing the immortal official, he respectfully received it, tasted its sweetness, then wiped his eyes and swallowed qi nine times, stopping. Thus for three years, his eyes beheld matters ten thousand li away, his ears heard sounds ten thousand li distant, all clear and bright, counter-knowledge of coming fortune and misfortune, the signs of lifespan, his body shining with wondrous light, penetrating inside and out. The dao of summoning the boundless is extremely subtle, passed mouth to mouth, not written.

Next, he returned to the same method, inwardly seeing the southern realm ninety thousand li away: mountains, rivers, grass, trees, earth colors, birds, beasts, Yue elders—all as if before his eyes, clear and precise, not wavering, remaining long naturally visible. Once clear, he heard in his ears the myriad sounds in noisy clamor, lingering long, then saw the Immortal Official of the Southern Peak, riding a flying dragon and cloud canopy, holding a splendid banner, accompanied by twelve jade maidens wearing flying brocade skirts, carrying a mysterious thread and scarlet fruit, held in a golden box, presented to his body. Upon seeing the immortal official, he respectfully received it, tasted its sourness, then wiped his eyes nine times and stopped. Thus for three years, naturally penetrating the profound void, his eyes beheld ten thousand li away, ears heard ten thousand li distant sounds, lingering long, all clear and bright, counter-knowledge of coming fortune and misfortune, his body born with jade luster, face shining with jade light. The dao of summoning the boundless.

Next, again the same method, inwardly seeing the western realm ninety thousand li away: mountains, rivers, earth colors, grass, trees, birds, beasts, mysterious elders—all as if before his eyes, clear and precise, not wavering, remaining long naturally visible. Once clear, he heard in his ears the sound of golden drums, sharp and clear, lingering long, then saw the Immortal Official of the Western Peak, riding a white rosy carriage, accompanied by twelve jade maidens wearing mysterious brocade skirts, carrying golden liquid and cinnabar essence, held in a golden box, presented to his body. Upon seeing the immortal official, he respectfully received it, tasted its sweetness, then wiped his eyes and swallowed qi nine times, stopping. Thus for three years, his sight penetrated thoroughly, discerning countless ten thousand li matters, fortune and misfortune, calamity and blessing clearly seen before their occurrence, his face shining with golden light. The dao of summoning the boundless, its method utterly beyond writing, passed mouth to mouth.

Next, again the same method, inwardly seeing the northern realm ninety thousand li away: mountains, rivers, earth colors, grass, trees, birds, beasts, Qiang elders—all as if before his eyes, clear and precise, not wavering, remaining long naturally visible. Once clear, he heard in his ears the ringing of bronze bells, clear and resonant, lingering long, then saw the Immortal Official of the Northern Peak, riding a mysterious cloud carriage, holding five mushrooms, accompanied by twelve jade maidens wearing mysterious brocade skirts, carrying jade liquid and fragrant nectar, held in a golden box, presented to his body. Upon seeing the immortal official, he respectfully received it, tasted its bitterness, then wiped his eyes and swallowed qi nine times, stopping. Thus for three years, he penetrated the eight directions, investigated the profound and subtle void, sitting he saw the infinite, body light and clear, sitting, standing, and rising in emptiness. The dao of summoning the boundless, supremely true and difficult to declare.

Next, again the same method, inwardly seeing his own body thoroughly, the palace terraces of the nine heavens above, mountains, rivers, forests, flying birds, running beasts, clouds and cliffs without limit, meeting with many true beings, the assembly of immortals speaking together, clear and precise, not wavering or thinking otherwise, remaining long naturally clear. Once clear, he heard in his ears the sound of five-tone strings and chimes, as if audible, lingering long, then saw the Immortal Official of the Central Peak, riding a yellow rosy dragon, accompanied by twelve jade maidens wearing yellow flying skirts, holding five-colored splendid banners, carrying five mushrooms and cinnabar essence, held in a golden box, presented to his body. Upon seeing the immortal official, he respectfully received it, tasted its fragrance, then wiped his eyes and swallowed qi twelve times, stopping. The Purple Transcendence Flame Radiance’s method of summoning the boundless is supremely wondrous, difficult to speak of. Practicing three years, penetrating the profound void, thoroughly seeing the mysterious darkness, calculating fortune, salary, and lifespan, signs of fortune and misfortune, his whole body fully penetrated, face glowing with golden light.

Having preserved the five directions, he rose, sitting facing east, knocked his teeth nine times, and prayed:

“Ten thousand transformations arise as one, the mysterious thread governs the void, revolving wheels silent, turning the four directions. Flowing light spans ten thousand li, penetrating the empty caverns. The three treasures shine bright, flying rosy clouds cluster the chamber, morning essence flows mysteriously, nine orifices open and connect, four meetings and eight reaches. Preserving the void, summoning the boundless, grant me spirit and wisdom, clearly discerning fortune and misfortune, harnessing the mysterious chariot, green carriage flying swift, ascending the supreme morning, advancing to worship the Jade Emperor.”

The Emperor’s method of inwardly preserving the summoning and cavern observation of heaven concludes here, its efficacy surpassing all others. The central method is precise and upright, with single-minded remembrance. Entering the chamber one hundred days, one begins to glimpse the future. Three years, spirit and mystery penetrate thoroughly, all clear and bright, not one lost. Truly the rarest truth from the void, truly descended. Its dao is subtle and profound, not to be spoken of in the world. People prize rank and office, I prize this dao. The rulers of the four seas seek this method, I have not heard of it. My dao is the root of immortality, counter-knowledge of the not-yet, penetrating the profound void, gazing upward to the infinite, hearing the sounds of ten thousand li, broadly connecting the world’s marvels—how could it be surpassed? Those who obtain it ride the green carriage, flying rosy clouds and mysterious canopy, ascending to the imperial morning. Only in treasured secrecy, do not recklessly transmit. Those who violate the bright rules, leak the true text, their bodies and ancestors, the seven mysteries, parents, all become ghostly servants, their bodies lost in the dark springs, bearing the reckoning of the Three Officials, enduring great hardship. Be vigilant.

Wearing and receiving the Purple Transcendence Flame Radiance, cultivating and learning to preserve the true summoning and cavern observation method, one should always be in a separate quiet chamber, not concerning worldly affairs, quietly contemplating and preserving thought of the world’s four directions, ten thousand li away: mountains, forests, grass, trees, birds, beasts, people, barbarians, Qiang, Hu, elders, strange beings—all come to pay homage to oneself. Also contemplate that my two eyes emit flowing firelight, like stars shining forth the red brilliance, light filling ten thousand li beyond, the four directions’ mountains and marshes, Huai and Ji rivers, forests and trees, all vanish with the light, the utmost heaven cleansed and pure, no more dust or filth. Eyes behold the boundless homeland, all around penetrating and reaching, nothing not connected. Thus all made clear and precise, knocking teeth nine times, raising prayers:

“Mysterious light shines within, penetrating and reflecting without end, thoroughly seeing and hearing, nine orifices open wide, flowing essence rushing and stirring, ten thousand li clear and connected, sitting witnessing nature, counter-investigating fortune and misfortune, gaining flight on rosy clouds, ascending the supreme void.”

Complete, then draw in qi and swallow saliva seven times, stopping. If one can cultivate this dao, within one hundred days one will glimpse the future, three years eyes see the empty caverns, sitting see ten thousand li beyond, ears hear ten thousand li sounds. The utmost wondrous dao, not to be written, passed mouth to mouth, carefully receive the secret words.

**Flowing Gold Fire Bell**

The Flowing Gold Fire Bell is the mysterious light of the Supreme Great Dao Lord’s roaming feast, above rousing the might of the Nine Heavens, below extinguishing the calamities of the Six Heavens. The mysterious light shines upon the Dao Lord’s neck, flowing and illuminating the eight extremes and three hundred thousand li. At the beginning of the Three Heavens’ establishment, abolishing the Six Heavens’ beginning, it was transmitted to the Supreme Emperor of the Great Microcosm. The divine text is stored within the jade palace’s jade chamber, the empty light self-illuminating, dazzling the Jade Pure, flying dragons and poisonous beasts wing at its sides, purple clouds and mysterious radiance cover its peak, jade maidens and golden true youths, three hundred each, oversee and guard the spiritual text, dispersing incense in the empty court. Accumulated seven thousand years, transforming into five talismans, light penetrating all directions, owing to the five directions’ camp and guard officials. The Supreme Emperor of the Great Microcosm passed it to the Golden Palace’s later sage Dao Lord, who entrusted it to the Prime Minister Qing Tong Lord, to grant to those becoming true persons, to wear when roaming the Jade Pure. Those who study the true, without the Flowing Gold Fire Bell, their necks lack the round light, all unable to ascend the Three Lights. If one has golden bones and jade essence, the mysterious name Qing Palace, receiving this text and wearing it, all heavens, all earth, the four seas and five sacred mountains, all the heavenly host and holy immortals, none do not bow to welcome, the divine light startling and moving, its control weighty. The Three Primes dispatch thirty-six jade boys and jade maidens to guard the body. Wearing it nine years, one may ride the eight scenic jade carriage, flying through the supreme void.

The Flowing Gold Fire Bell is the essence of the Nine Stars, also called the Round Light. The Supreme Might Chapter, born before the Nine Heavens, condensed qi into text, bright and dazzling, illuminating the Ten Directions, hanging essence suspended over the Supreme’s neck. Accumulating ten thousand years, transforming into five bell divine talismans, mysteriously descending to the Supreme Emperor of the Great Microcosm, commanding the demons of the utmost heaven, the divine array of the Nine Rosy Courts, governing all below heaven, none not under command. The Supreme Great Dao Lord treasures this dao secretly, informing the universal heavenly masters and true immortals, inspecting and correcting careless leaks. Those with true immortal talent who wear this talisman, not relying on mysterious methods to lightly give to the untrue, profaning the spiritual text, all seven ancestors suffer calamity, implicating former teachers, all becoming ghost officials.

Wear it with a purple silk band two feet two inches long, inscribed in vermilion, worn on the head. If one has golden name and jade constitution, wearing this text, all are destined to respond as immortals. The wearer’s coming and going, roaming, should always imagine a round light on their neck, illuminating thirty thousand li beyond. Within nine years, diligently mindful of the true, pure fasting and resolute intention, one gains true spirit descending, round light self-illuminating, riding the void in movement, sitting, standing, and passing away.

**Five Seals Ascending to the Void Walking and Preserving Immortality Talisman, also called Fire Bell**

At the beginning when the Supreme Emperor of the Great Microcosm received qi, the mysterious phenomena first divided, ascending the Nine Mysterious Void-born Terrace, the Five Emperor divine officials guarded the eight directions, five talismans reflected in the void, appearing and disappearing, dark and misty on the Phoenix Terrace, within the jade chamber’s curved room. Accumulated seven thousand years, its text appeared, flowing light shining in the Nine Heavens, treasured text dazzling in the Jade Pure. Left cast becomes the Flowing Gold Fire Bell, right shake scatters the seven primes, commanding the demons of the utmost heaven, spreading might in the Nine Rosy Courts, supremely wondrous dao, subtle and difficult to surpass. The Emperor fasting on the jade terrace of the supreme void, the hall of profound truth, jade chamber of golden splendor, attended by maidens and true beings, five-colored divine officials numbering a hundred million, flying beasts and poisonous dragons, gates fully guarded, giant dragons thousands of feet long guarding walls and banks, phoenix cries and dragon roars, a hundred sounds stirring the hall, might spreading through the vast court, lion howls and calls, all blowing spiritual songs, jade sounds flowing and sparkling, divine consorts singing in chorus, jade maidens plucking strings and striking notes. Then I summoned the Central Yellow Emperor Laozi, the Four True Ones of the Great Ultimate, prepared the rosy nectar of flowing clouds, the fruit of the ringed steel, red trees and white seeds, hidden mushrooms intertwined, all fragrances falling, accumulated ninety days. Then the Turtle Mother pressed the brush, the Great One swept the mat, heavenly consorts tended incense, jade blossoms wove the text, inscribed on white jade slips, written in gold script, entrusted to the Left Duke of the Immortal Capital, sealed in a jade box with cloud brocade pouch, transmitted to the Central Yellow Lord Laozi, who accepted it by covenant and reverence, bowed and withdrew. Then summoned the Nine Spirits’ flowing rosy cloud carriage, fifty thousand five-colored divine officials, flying with blue-green feathered dragon cloaks, ascending the Golden Palace Jade Pure Palace. If one has golden script East Flower, and sees this text, one’s destined fate responds as immortal. Wearing the talisman and walking, myriad gods come to pay homage, entering and leaving the void, circling the five sacred mountains, moving the five stars, body born of water and fire, transforming the ten directions. Wearing it nine years, one descends to the green carriage, ascends to the Three Primes, position rising to Jade Pure. Its dao is secret and wondrous, not transmitted to the untrue, lightly leaking chapters, body lost and form ruined. According to the mysterious true bright rules, once every seven thousand years transmitted to one person, violating the covenant and oath brings calamity to the seven mysteries, body and former teachers, all becoming lower ghosts, enduring ten hardships and eight difficulties.

**Within the Flowing Gold Fire Bell Is Contained the Great Invocation of Power and Divine Wisdom**

Cultivating and wearing the Flowing Gold Fire Bell, coming and going near and far, traversing dangers, bandits, and illnesses, under threats and harm, one should preserve true light to protect oneself, opening the road ten thousand li. At the outset of issuing, facing the proper direction, knock left teeth twenty-seven times, swallow qi thirty-six times, then think of the place’s form and image, mountains, forests, grass, trees, people, birds, beasts, spirits, all clearly bright, all come to pay homage to me. Think of the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper covering my head, still preserving my left eye as the rushing star, right eye as swift lightning, its light dazzling, the rushing star nine thousand li beyond, seeing the path opening with the light, mountains, forests, grass, trees, people, houses, soldiers, ghosts, and qi, all vanish with no trace, the four roads open wide. Then pray:

“Front opens, rear closes, Heaven balanced, Earth raised, Divine Lords go roaming, four roads open wide, command Heaven and Earth, connect my bridges, front, rear, left, right, penetrating eight directions. Left cast the rushing star, right swift lightning light, flowing fire ten thousand li, what demon dares oppose? The Great One will escort, myriad gods come to welcome, wherever I go, all auspicious and good. Riding clouds, driving the void, ascending the supreme void.”

Complete, then draw in the essence of the two eyes, each returning to its palace, left taking seven qi, right taking seven qi, swallowing them. Thus one may face danger and hardship, attack ghosts and defeat soldiers, all responding with resounding effect. Its method is supremely wondrous, not to be recklessly transmitted.

The Five Emperor Flowing Bells’ five talismans command the demons of the utmost heaven, summon and gather the five directions’ spirits, correspond above to the five mornings, participate in the seven primes below, correspond to the human body, nine orifices and seven lights, encircling heaven and earth, nothing not connected, no darkness unmeasured, no detail unreflected. Preserve the talisman first, casting it then shakes might. If you wear it, receive the master’s words.

If in the human realm encountering places of evil ghosts, perform the great invocation of power, face north, close qi twelve breaths, think of the five directions’ qi covering crown and body, inside and outside bright, seeing nothing. Then knock teeth thirty-six times, swallow the five directions’ qi, then open three swallowing qi passages, all entering the destined body, preserving my two eyes’ youthful light like shooting stars, shining over the five directions. Then pray:

“Heavenly primal seven essences, Five Emperor Flowing Bells, dazzling lightning cast forth, like heavenly rushing stars, light shining ten directions, revealing ghosts’ true forms. What small demon dares approach my birth gate? The Most High commands, slaughter without kin, gut and disembowel, utterly annihilate ghost essences, thousands all crushed, tens of thousands all toppled, divine might utters prayer, capturing without pause.”

Complete, then swallow qi thirty-six times, stopping. Such a prayer, the five directions’ immortal officials all protect armor and life, record all spirits’ qi in place, bind and bring to court, three prayers and the ghost kings’ seed is destroyed.

If entering the Five Sacred Mountains, roaming mountains and rivers, risking steep paths, one should, before arriving at the place by one hundred paces, knock left teeth thirty-six times. If to the Eastern Peak, preserve the Eastern Blue Emperor’s Xilin Pearl officials nine thousand to guard front, rear, left, right, covering crown and body with blue rosy qi; if to the Southern Peak, preserve the Southern Red Emperor’s Dan Xuanzi officials eight thousand, guarding front and rear, covering crown and body with scarlet rosy qi; if to the Western Peak, preserve the Western White Emperor’s Shaohao Spirit officials five thousand, guarding front and rear, covering crown and body with pure rosy qi; if to the Northern Peak, preserve the Northern Black Emperor’s Xuanming Hao officials five thousand, guarding front and rear, covering crown and body with black rosy qi; if to the Central Peak, preserve the Central Yellow Emperor’s Zhizhong Yuan officials twelve thousand, guarding front and rear, covering crown with yellow qi. Then pray:

“Heaven shines spirit, seven mornings’ mysterious essence, Five Dipper splendid canopy, encircling my form, five-colored flying rosy clouds, mixed and merged, body wearing seven primes, Flowing Gold Fire Bell, dazzling cast without direction, utmost heaven dark and mysterious, Five Emperor divine officials, driving heavenly soldiers, for me commanding and controlling, mountains, rivers, lands, thousands of ghosts and myriad spirits, all come to bow heads, self-surrender true forms, front slay, rear slaughter, none captured stop.”

Complete. Such a prayer, heavenly demons vanish, myriad gods come to pay homage, roaming the Five Mountains, treading mountains and rivers, no longer fearing inspection or harm. The Five Mountains’ immortal officials themselves escort and present five mushrooms and five-born jade flowers to give to the body.

If among armies and bandits, under hanging blades, in peril and hardship, one should knock right teeth twelve times, preserve the seven stars covering the body, mysterious light penetrating and reflecting, encircling the whole body. Preserve the liver as the Year Star, emerging on the left; lungs as the Great White, emerging on the right; heart as the Fire Star, emerging in front; kidneys as the Celestial Star, emerging behind; spleen as the Guard Star, emerging on the chest. Let the five stars’ refined qi entwine front and rear, my body residing in the Dipper’s chief, beneath the five stars. Next preserve the five emperor divine officials guarding me left and right, pray:

“Heaven is my house, Earth my bed, Five Mountains and rivers my bridges, Mysterious Dipper primal essence my clothing, hiding body within seven primes, land of flowing fire. The one who passes me is the Great One’s endeavor, the one who crosses me is the White Prime without hero. Disaster cannot harm, soldiers cannot injure, command my body to ascend Golden Palace, capital of the Nine Elders.”

Complete. Thus in distress and hardship, the destined end is liberated.

**Five-colored Brocade each fifty feet, to request the Five Emperor Immortal Officials. Purple-gold five taels, translucent to the imperial avenue’s trust. Agarwood five catties, rising to the Three Primes. True pearls one tael, as the oath of the covenant elixir. Inscribed knife one piece, as the path to sever death’s qi. Golden pearls seven pieces, to offer to the seven primes’ essence. Scarlet patterned seventy feet, as the fiery radiance’s qi.**

Whoever receives the talisman scripture must treasure it, faithfully go to the master, fast three days, bathe and burn incense, write talismans and scripture, expose them on a high altar overnight, next morning ascend the altar together, report to the Northern Emperor, open the covenant document, pass the talisman scripture to disciples. Without ascending the altar and swearing, one must not recklessly open chapters. If the master lightly leaks scripture, the body suffers the test of the wind blade; disciples who do not accept and open the scroll, calamity strikes the seven mysteries, body crippled and blind. The Four Extremes’ methods forbid lightly leaking scripture; the Great Scripture’s law forbids without covenant and oath. Without golden name and jade constitution, none may hear or see.

Those seeking immortality first lack the five talismans to wear on the body, Five Mountains’ immortal officials do not guard the destined form, ghost registers do not record death names. Dwelling in rocks and caves, they are defeated by Nine Heavens’ demon kings; entering and leaving the human world, they cannot escape officials, blades, and soldiers. Those who obtain and wear them are covered and protected by heaven, roaming freely without direction, moving as they please. Preserve thought of the true person returning to their original palace, five mushrooms and five births, body shining with jade light, immortal officials guarding, the Three Primes visiting the chamber, riding clouds and driving the void, ascending Jade Pure. After wearing the talisman one hundred days, one should write five talismans on five five-inch paulownia boards, each on one board. Also write one inscription each, recording the year, month, day, hour, county, village, mountain, teacher Wang Jia, age, and which emperor’s descendant of which mountain. Bury the talismans in the Five Mountains, when burying, knock teeth thirty-six times, pray:

“Above open the Three Primes, Jade Emperor Most Honored, below inform the Five Mountains, five-colored immortal officials, receive the Flowing Bell, five talisman true words, fasting with five incenses, record mountain and river names, request to confirm true immortals, come guard my form, five mushrooms flowing yellow, black, white, red, blue, body born of water and fire, shining fiery bell, dragon reins to the chamber, ascending Jade Court.”

Thus, the Five Directions’ immortal officials guard the destined body, granting you the true spirit’s dao, roaming the Five Mountains and seas, myriad spirits all come to pay homage.

**Emperor’s Night-Illuminating Divine Candle**

The Night-Illuminating Divine Candle was granted by the Nine Heavens’ True Kings to the Supreme Emperor of the Great Microcosm. Ascending the nine-layered terrace, golden radiance and purple orchids in the palace, within the jade chamber, illuminating divine candles for the Five Emperors, performing rites and wishes, reciting and meditating on the chapters, within nine hundred days, divine response and spiritual efficacy arise, thus causing the Five Emperors to descend with spiritual talismans, void-born in the five directions, dazzling the Jade Pure, shining brightly within, penetrating the void, surveying the unfathomable, indestructible, radiant in the jade chamber. After seven hundred years, the divine text appeared, five-colored beasts guarding the talisman lamps, recorded as the Night-Illuminating Divine Candle’s Penetrating Light Spiritual Talisman, five colors dazzling, thoroughly penetrating the five directions. The Emperor then ceased fasting in the Jade Pure, cast the text in purple gold, received it in the supreme void, auspicious signs appeared, then had the Turtle Mother press the brush, the Great One swept the mat, heavenly consorts tended incense, jade blossoms wove the text, inscribed on golden slips, tied with purple cords, entrusted to the Left Duke of the Immortal Capital for record, jade palace purple clouds gathered above, fragrant smoke dispersed, thirty-six jade boys guarded, transmitted to the Golden Palace’s later sage Nine Mysterious Emperor, Prime Minister Qing Tong Lord, later granted to later students becoming true persons. This method is a treasured secret, not passed to later generations. Those with golden bones and jade marrow, named to join the Qing Palace, recorded in Jade Pure, shall obtain this text. Those who obtain it become true persons, practicing nine years, divine light self-arises, body bright and qi pure, riding the void driving the sky, ascending to the imperial hall.

This Emperor received the Nine Heavens’ True Kings’ Divine Candle inner hymns, cultivating and accumulating feeling, causing night light to shine clearly, the Five Emperors’ Penetrating Light Spiritual Talismans descending to the imperial chamber. If you have a jade name, and comprehend the secret text, you should bring five taels of gold as ritual to the five directions, five-colored silks each fifty feet, to covenant with the Five Emperors, swear to the Three Primes, then receive it.

**Returning to the Heavens, Descending Rosy Clouds, Riding the Void Supreme Method**

Received from Blue Youth Lord

The Emperor was born within bright rosy clouds, five clouds entwined, sky qi reflecting his countenance, form patterned in the imperial register, receiving the title Jade Void, condensing truth and solid liquid, now thinking of mysterious rosy clouds to move himself, intending to roam the heavens to ascend the void, riding the mysterious morning in ten heavens, galloping flying lightning to control dragons. Thus his refined thought became true, then he rode the void into the void. Its secret essentials, not mixed with many directions, now granted to you, so you may carry it out.

Eastern Blue Rosy Cloud, named Flying Void.  
Western White Rosy Cloud, named Pure Hut.  
Southern Red Rosy Cloud, named Vermilion Shine.  
Northern Black Rosy Cloud, named Mysterious Image.  
Central Yellow Rosy Cloud, named Gathering Life.

Knowing the five rosy clouds, one may summon flying wheels, morning and evening preserve thought, the mysterious heavens come invite, riding the void ascend, body create Jade Pure. You cultivate this dao, always at dawn when sunlight begins, go out to the courtyard, knock teeth sixteen times, east facing call three times the five directions’ rosy cloud names. Complete, raise prayers:

“Five directions’ mysterious rosy clouds, flowing and shining in mysterious void, participating in seven emperors and nine rulers, returning to create my hut, may I ride flying morning, control the purple carriage, ascend Great Ultimate, request to receive true scripture.”

Complete, bow heart, swallow qi thirty-six times, stopping. At dusk face west, same method. If a person cultivates the supreme dao without knowing the inner names of the rosy clouds, the cloud carriage will not descend, preserving thought will not cause response. You have this method, practice it eighteen years, the chamber produces self-formed qi, cloud carriage descends, moves your body, ascending Jade Pure. This dao is treasured secret, the text revealing the mysterious rosy clouds’ names, worldly people never again cultivate its method, so it should be kept secret. Lightly leaking it brings guilt upon your body, calamity to seven ancestors, how not be cautious?

**Passing Through Heavenly Passes, Opening Divine Cavern Observation Secret Scripture**

The Emperor said: “If you desire to soar and ascend the Golden Palace, you must cultivate cavern observation, pass through heavenly passes, bow to parents, preserve and call the inner truth, roam the Nine Heavens, ascend the imperial chamber. Every midnight, emerge in the courtyard, gaze upon the Northern Dipper seven stars clearly, think to see my body in the Dipper’s center, following the Dipper’s movement, passing heavenly passes, arriving above the southwest, then bow again, stand upright, knock head nine times, look up slightly and call three times: ‘Heavenly Father, Earthly Mother, now I return my body, returning body to father and mother, the respect of nature, how could you not pass my body? My body is passed, forever leaving thought and path, preserve thought of the two honored, looking up to enjoy blessings.’ Complete, swallow qi two times, swallow saliva nine times, stopping.

These two honored ones are Heaven and Earth’s utmost taboo, mysterious true hidden names, not to be recklessly told to others. If told three times, the Nine Heavens’ officials reduce lifespan, death in the nine springs, never attaining immortality. All who cultivate the supreme true dao, seven stars move and pass, opening the three heavenly passes, if not knowing these names, the Nine Heavens’ Jade True closes one’s cultivation’s feeling, not a child of the mysterious gate, cannot open, true spirit will not descend for you. This is Heaven and Earth’s wondrous method. Those who receive it must bring gold person and jade person each one form, receive secret instructions from the master’s mouth, ascend covenant and report passage, not to violate rules, body lost to ghost officials, calamity to seven mysteries. Those who receive, be cautious, be cautious.”
