Title of Scripture: The True Talisman of the Golden Tiger of the Cavern of Reality and Supreme Subtlety. Author unknown, roughly dating from the Eastern Jin dynasty. It belongs to the early Shangqing lineage of talismanic writings. One scroll. Source text: *The Daoist Canon of Orthodox Tradition*, Zhengyi section.

### The True Talisman of the Golden Tiger of the Cavern of Reality and Supreme Subtlety

The True Talisman of the Golden Tiger of the Supreme Subtle Heavenly Emperor is concealed within the Jade Palace of the Most High Primordial Radiance. It stretches ten thousand fathoms in poisonous delight, strikes down demons and guards the scripture. Seven thousand divine tigers stand ready at the Jade Pass, accompanied by three hundred Jade Maidens of the Western Splendor, scattering fragrance throughout the Celestial Court. The Five Elders’ classic texts and the Golden Morning attendants serve faithfully. Without the jade register and the sacred name, without carving the slips of the Three Pure Ones, none may obtain the inner talisman of the Golden Tiger nor hear the jade chapters of the Most High. This talisman is engraved within the Shangqing jade slip wisdom scripture, containing seventy thousand words, its numinous sound revealing the wondrous Dao, its subtle meaning difficult to explain. Sometimes it conceals the secret names of heavenly demons, sometimes it reveals the inner names of myriad spirits, sometimes it unfolds obscure allegories and enigmatic formulas in the jade voice.

A certain Master Wang once copied out this talisman and the method of the mighty divine text, to command the host of spirits in Heaven and Earth, but only one hundred words in all. This incantation is wondrous and secret, named the “Three Heavens Tiger Script of the Supreme Primordial Jade Register.” Those who receive it must first fast for seventy days, prepare a golden tiger jade bell, thirty feet each of white silk and dark gauze, to serve as the golden truth’s oath, pledging an unspoken covenant with Heaven and Earth. According to the bright rites of the Four Extremities, it may be transmitted to three persons within seven hundred years.

The True Talisman of the Golden Tiger Essence of the Supreme Subtle Heavenly Emperor is the inner voice of the Golden Seal of the Primordial Supreme Radiance and Natural Dao. It commands the golden immortals, seals mountains, summons spirits, and with awe shakes the Six Heavens, beheading ten thousand gods. The Most High constantly dispatches seven hundred thousand Western Spirit Tai Jia to guard the talisman in the Jade Palace of Supreme Subtlety. Those who wear this talisman wield authority over Heaven and Earth, commanding myriad spirits, controlling the radiant dragon, holding office among the high immortals. When the jade voice resounds, the Jade Splendor attends nearby, the golden truth guards the soldiers; a thousand demons lose their eyes, ten thousand ghosts vanish their forms, nine devils burst their heads, the Six Heavens collapse and fall. The Dao’s wondrous truth is utmost and perfect; the spirit gathers the Five Spirits. On the left whistles the Mysterious Youth, on the right seizes the Golden Morning. Great indeed is this precious script, the emperor’s majestic truth! It is not merely to repel poison, ward off trials, and destroy demons, but a wondrous treasure for seeking immortality, a mark of true attainment.

Attending the scripture are jade boys and jade girls, each forty-seven in number, guarding the body of the scripture bearer, serving the talisman and following the ritual, ascending to the Three Pure Ones. If one disrespects the celestial text or transmits it to unworthy persons, the body will enter wind and fire, and the seven ancestors and parents will be severely punished by the Water Official.

### The True Talisman of the Golden Tiger of the Supreme Subtle Heavenly Emperor

This right-hand Golden Tiger True Talisman was transmitted by the Supreme Subtle Heavenly Emperor to the Golden Palace Emperor. Written in vermilion on white silk, enclosed in a purple brocade pouch, worn on the head while traveling, it commands awe over Heaven and Earth and myriad spirits. Immortals bow in reverence; Jade Splendor holds the cloth; heavenly soldiers guard the body; mountains and rivers bow their essence. With the added invocation of the mighty divine blessing and the Jade Pure chapter, one may behead nine devils and obliterate a thousand demons’ forms. This Shangqing forbidden talisman is not passed down in the world; those who wear it ascend swiftly to Shangqing.

The Most High Primordial Radiance Golden Truth Mighty Divine Inner Blessing commands and summons divine troops to slay evil ghosts. Before use, enter a chamber, burn incense, knock teeth thirty-six times, sit or lie at will, then recite the blessing:

Repel the King of Dry Poison, shake the banner of the Shiluo, the Eight Immortals wield their halberds, the Five Spirits of the Supreme Emperor, the Great Mystery descends the radiance, the Seven Spirits guard the court, the Yellow True Radiant Talisman, blazing and casting the fire bell, the divine tiger rouses its might, the poisonous blade rampages wildly, the purple blossoming ritual, four leaps resound upward, Nine Heavens and Six Heavens, the Four Great Bright Crystals, wrapped externally by the Mysterious Qi, guarded internally by master soldiers, left commands, right watches, wind strikes, fire marches, shouting to behead ten thousand demons, crushing and beheading a thousand spirits, the Golden Truth awakens the quake, nine devils seize forms, the Northern Feng falls and collapses, all destroyed utterly. I wear the true talisman, commanding myriad spirits, the Three Primes proclaim the truth, the mysterious union of imperial sincerity, the Supreme Subtle issues the command, ascending to the Three Pure Ones.

The method of the Primordial Radiance Mighty Divine Inner Blessing is all from the Shangqing forbidden scripture. “Repel the King of Crushing Poison” is the inner name of the Six Heavens’ great demons. “Shake the banner of the Shiluo” is the hidden name of the Northern Emperor’s demon king. “Four Heavens Bright Crystals” are the soul names of the Northern Feng ghost generals. Knowing the names of these three ghosts causes a thousand demons to flee, ten thousand ghosts to hide their forms, nine devils to be unable to move or test, a hundred evils unable to set harm. Whether dwelling alone in mountains and forests, or among gods and ghosts in temples, one may act according to the text without burning incense or entering a chamber.

### The Five Bells Ascend the Void, Step the Empty, Preserve Immortality Supreme Talisman, also called the Fire Bell

The Supreme Subtle Heavenly Emperor of the Golden Tiger received the Qi at the beginning, the mysterious image first divided, ascending the platform of the Nine Mysterious Void Births. The five imperial divine officials guard the eight directions; five talismans float in the void, sometimes appearing, sometimes vanishing. On the Phoenix Terrace above, within the jade chambers and winding rooms, accumulated for seven thousand years, their script appears. Their radiance shines in the Nine Heavens, their script glowing brilliantly in Jade Pure. When cast left, it becomes a flowing golden fire bell; when shaken right, it crowns the seven primal falls, subduing the demons of the utmost heaven, spreading awe across the court of the nine clouds. The Dao is supremely wondrous and subtle, difficult to surpass.

The emperor, while purifying and fasting in the jade platform of the void palace of the Supreme Subtle, in the jade chamber of golden splendor, attended by numerous maidens and true spirits, five-colored divine officials, billions of people, flying beasts and poisonous dragons, heroic gates fully guarded, giant dragons thousands of fathoms tall guarding the walls, phoenix cries and dragon roars, a hundred sounds stirring the halls, majestic and widespread, lions roaring, crowds blowing cloud songs, jade chimes flowing and sparkling, divine consorts singing in harmony, jade maidens striking strings and plucking melodies.

I then summoned the Central Yellow Lord Lao, the Four True Ones of the Supreme Ultimate, set out the nectar of flowing clouds, the hardened fruits, red trees and white seeds, hidden herbs intertwined, myriad fragrances falling, accumulated for ninety days. Then the Turtle Mother set the brush, the Supreme One brushed the mat, the heavenly consort tended incense, jade maidens tied the bundle, using white jade as slips, inscribing golden script, entrusting it to the Left Duke of the Immortal Capital, sealed in a jade cloud brocade pouch, passed to the Central Yellow Lord Lao. The lord accepted the five talismans by covenant, bowed and withdrew, then summoned the Nine Spirits’ flowing radiance cloud chariot, fifty thousand five-colored divine officials, flying with azure-green feathered dragon cloaks, ascending the Golden Palace of Jade Pure.

If one obtains the golden script of the Eastern Splendor and sees this text, their destiny will respond to immortality. Wearing the talisman while traveling, myriad spirits come to court, entering emptiness and void, circling the Five Sacred Mountains, moving the Five Stars, body born of water and fire, transforming the Ten Directions. Wearing it for nine years brings down the green cake, ascending to the Three Primes, attaining rank in Jade Pure. Its Dao is secret and wondrous; it is not passed to the untrue. To lightly reveal its chapters means the body perishes and the form is lost. According to the mysterious bright rites, it may be transmitted to one person every seven thousand years. Those who violate the covenant and break the oath bring disaster upon the seven mysteries, their bodies and ancestors, and become lowly ghosts, suffering ten hardships and eight calamities.

Males wear blue on earth, with cinnabar script, worn on the left; females wear yellow script on white earth, worn on the right.

Five-colored brocade, fifty feet each, is offered to request the Five Emperor Immortal Officials.

Five taels of purple-gold, a translucent trust token.

Five catties of agarwood incense, to be offered at the Three Primes’ palace.

One pound of true cinnabar, as the pledge elixir of the covenant.

One writing knife, to sever the path of death qi.

Seven golden pearls, to serve in inviting the essence of the Seven Primes.

Seventy feet of scarlet brocade, as the token of fiery radiance.

Those receiving the talisman scripture must bring their trust to the master, purify and fast for three days, bathe and burn incense, write the talisman and scripture, exposing them overnight on a high altar. At dawn, ascend the altar together, report to the Northern Emperor, open the covenant and transmit the talisman scripture to disciples. Without ascending the altar and swearing the oath, one must not rashly open the chapters. If the master lightly reveals the scripture, the body will suffer the trial of the wind knife. Disciples who refuse to accept and yet open the scroll bring disaster upon the seven mysteries, their bodies maimed and sight lost. The rites of the Four Extremities forbid lightly revealing the scripture. The laws of the Supreme Truth forbid receiving without covenant. Without the golden name and jade seal, none may hear or see it. Those seeking immortality without wearing the Five Talismans will not be guarded by the Five Mountains Immortal Officials, their names will not be recorded in the Three Officials’ ghost register, and dwelling in mountains or caves will lead to defeat by the Nine Heavens Demon Kings; entering the human world will not escape the county magistrate’s calamities of sword and fire. Those who wear it tread the abyss of Heaven, roaming boundlessly, freely moving about, preserving true spirit, returning to their original palace, spontaneously growing the Five Mushrooms, their bodies reflecting jade light, guarded by immortal officials, visited by the Three Primes to the chamber, riding clouds and driving the void, ascending to Jade Pure.

After one hundred days of receiving the talisman, one must prepare five paulownia boards five inches long each, write the talisman on each board, and attach one board above. Also write five needles, recording: on a certain year, month, day, hour, in a certain county, village, mountain, a certain master named so-and-so, age so many, descendant of a certain emperor’s clan of a certain mountain. These are entrusted to the needles and buried in the Five Mountains. When burying the talisman, knock teeth thirty-six times and recite:

Above, open to the Three Primes Jade Emperor; below, report to the Five Mountains Five-colored Immortal Officials. I receive the flowing bell Five Talismans’ true words, purify and fast with five incense, record the names of mountains and rivers, request the true immortals to guard my form. The Five Mushrooms flow yellow, black, white, red, and blue; my body is born of water and fire, blazing and casting the fire bell; the dragon reins to the chamber, ascending to the Jade Court. Thus, the Five Directions Immortal Officials guard my form, granting the child the true way of the spirit, roaming the Five Mountains and seas; all spirits come to court.

The fire bell vibrates with mighty divine wisdom blessing. Wearing the flowing golden fire bell, entering and exiting near and far, traversing dangerous cliffs, bandits, and illness, in times of peril, one must preserve true light to protect oneself, opening and clearing the path of ten thousand li. At the start of issuing, face the proper direction, knock left teeth twenty-seven times, swallow qi thirty-six times, then contemplate the place, its form and image, mountains, forests, grasses, trees, people, birds, beasts, spirits, all clearly and brightly, all come to worship my body. Think of the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper covering my head, still preserving my left eye as the running star, my right eye as the swift thunder, shining and rushing beyond ninety thousand li, seeing the road ahead, opening with the light. Mountains, forests, grasses, trees, people, houses, soldiers, bandits, ghost qi—all are ordered to vanish, leaving no trace, the four roads cleansed.

Then recite:

Open before, close behind, Heaven balanced, Earth raised, the divine lord goes forth, the four roads open wide. Let Heaven and Earth connect my bridge, front, back, left, and right, penetrating the eight directions. My left casts the running star, my right the swift electric light, flowing essence ten thousand li—what demon dares oppose? The Supreme One will escort, myriad gods come to greet. Wherever I go, all is auspicious and good. Riding clouds and driving the void, ascending the great void.

When finished, draw back the essence of both eyes, returning each to its palace; take seven qi from the left, seven qi from the right, and swallow them all. Thus one may brave cliffs and cross dangers, attack ghosts and fight soldiers, all responding with resounding effect. This method is supremely wondrous, not to be transmitted in writing, passed only mouth to mouth. Be clear and cautious. According to the mysterious rites, it may be transmitted once every seven hundred years.

The Five Emperor Flowing Bell Five Talismans command awe over the demons of the utmost heaven, summon and gather the spirits of the Five Directions, correspond to the Five Stars above, participate in the seven primal falls, respond below to the human body, the nine orifices and seven lights, circumnavigating heaven and earth, nothing unrelated, no darkness unmeasured, no detail unexamined. When the talisman is preserved, its light is visible; when cast, it vibrates the spirits. If you wear it, receiving the master’s oral instructions, and encounter evil ghosts on earth, perform the great mighty blessing: face north, close qi for twelve breaths, contemplate the qi of the Five Directions, cover your head and body, inside and out all dark and hidden, nothing visible. Then knock left teeth thirty-six times, swallow the qi of the Five Directions, three swallows each. When all qi is removed, it enters your form. Preserve the two eye children, light like shooting stars, blazing across the Five Directions, then recite:

Heaven’s prime seven essences, Five Emperor flowing bells, blazing and casting electric light like heavenly shooting stars, shining in the Ten Directions, revealing ghosts’ true forms. What small demon dares approach my life gate? The great emperor commands slaughter without kinship, gutting liver and belly, utterly destroying ghost essences, thousands crushed, tens of thousands toppled. Divine might utters blessings, seizing registers without pause.

Then swallow qi thirty-six times and stop. With this one blessing, all Five Directions Immortal Officials summon armored soldiers, spirits bound and brought to court. Three blessings extinguish ghost qi and seeds.

When entering the Five Mountains, touring mountains and rivers, braving cliffs and peaks, before reaching the place by a hundred paces, knock left teeth thirty-six times. If at the Eastern Mountain, preserve the Azure Emperor’s Xilin Pearl officials, nine thousand strong, to guard my front, back, left, and right, covering my body with azure mist qi. If at the Southern Mountain, preserve the Crimson Emperor Dan Xuanzi officials, eight thousand strong, guarding my front and back, covering my body with crimson cloud qi. If at the Western Mountain, preserve the White Emperor Shaohao Spirit officials, six thousand strong, guarding my front and back, covering my body with pure mist qi. If at the Northern Mountain, preserve the Black Emperor Xuanming officials, five thousand strong, guarding my front and back, covering my body with mysterious cloud qi. If at the Central Mountain, contemplate the Yellow Emperor Zhizhong Yuan officials, twelve thousand strong, guarding my front and back, covering my body with yellow qi.

Then recite:

Heaven’s radiance shines, seven mornings’ mysterious essences, five dippers’ floral canopy, encircling and binding my form, five-colored flying mist, mingled and interwoven. Wearing the seven primal talismans, flowing golden fire bell, blazing and casting to the north, utmost heaven’s dark gloom. The Five Emperor divine officials station heavenly soldiers to command and guard for me. Mountains and rivers, lands and fields, a thousand ghosts and myriad spirits, all ordered to bind their heads and deliver their true forms, executing punishment front and back, no capture ceases.

When finished with this blessing, heavenly demons vanish, myriad gods come to court, roaming the Five Mountains, treading mountains and rivers, no longer troubled by trials or observation. The Five Mountains Immortal Officials come of their own accord, bringing the Five Mushrooms and Jade Flowers to give to your body.

If amid armies and bandits, under county magistrates’ white blades, in times of calamity, knock right teeth twelve times, preserve the Five Dipper cover, mysterious light shining, encompassing the whole body. Preserve the liver as the Year Star, appearing on the left; the lungs as the Great White Star, appearing on the right; the heart as the Mars Star, appearing in front; the kidneys as the Dragon Star, appearing behind; the spleen as the Town Star, appearing above the chest. Let the Five Stars’ essence qi entwine front and back, my body residing in the Dipper’s chief, beneath the Five Stars.

Next, contemplate the Five Emperor divine officials guarding my left and right, and recite:

Heaven is my house, Earth my bed, the Five Mountains and rivers my bridge and beam, the mysterious dipper prime essence my clothing, hidden within the Seven Primes, the land of flowing fire. Those who cross me are the Supreme One’s task; those who pass me are the White Prime without merit. Disaster cannot touch me, soldiers cannot harm me. Let my body ascend to the Golden Palace, the capital of the Nine Elders.

Thus, even in the midst of hardship and impending death, one’s fate may be liberated.
