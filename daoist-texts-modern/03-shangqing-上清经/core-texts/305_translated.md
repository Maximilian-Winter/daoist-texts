### The Cavernous Truth Supreme One Emperor’s Secret Scripture of the Great Elixir — The Mysterious Classic of Cavernous Truth

Also called *The Vast Treatise of the Three Origins*

When Lady of the Purple Tenuity first received this scripture, she composed this recitation:

Crimson radiance floats the mysterious dawn,  
Purple pavilion rides the clouds on a journey.  
Gazing upward beyond the Golden Palace,  
Looking downward upon the Western Splendor City.  
Eastern glow unfolds fivefold brilliance,  
Divine origins shine with seven numinous lights.  
Veiled shadows shade the three candles,  
Flowing currents freely traverse the dark.  
Winds drum the empty cavernous dome,  
Fragrant smoke disperses through the jade court.  
Hands clasp the Weaver Maiden’s dance,  
Twin collars fall like embroidered blue brocade.  
Left turns the banner of patterned feathers,  
The splendid canopy leans with the clouds.  
Feasting and resting beyond the nine courts,  
Right and wrong do not entangle me.  
Embracing the void within the mud pellet,  
Heavenly form cradled close to the sun,  
How unlike the sullied midst,  
Bleak and listless life.  
Supporting the green peak of Fusang,  
Vermilion spirit blossoms faintly bright.  
Above the azure platform at night’s void,  
Four views reflect the clear high.  
Flying shadows control the purple wheel,  
Three pure reins and red chariot.  
Reclining in the Supreme Emperor’s hall,  
Roaming the Mother of Cao’s courtyard.  
Washing in the jade stream’s waves,  
Holding the jade nectar jar.  
Curving morning fans the wind,  
Jade whirlwind sometimes tilts downward.  
Briefly resting in the misty haze,  
Turning the carriage to float the pure and true.  
Mysterious meetings hold their own essence,  
Wandering freely in the profound dark.  
At last knowing honor and disgrace,  
Just realizing the urgency of age.  
The crooked chamber can be pure and tranquil,  
Nurturing truth awaits the sun’s completion.  
Why speak of the common path?  
From it arise a hundred ailments.

Lady of the Purple Tenuity’s surname is Wang, given name Qing’e, style pronounced Yu Yun, the twenty-fourth daughter of the Queen Mother of the West. The Purple Tenuity Palace lies beyond the Northern Abyss, on the Feathered Bright Plain of Mysterious Ridge Mountain, which itself is northeast of Kunlun Mountain. Purple Tenuity spoke to Mother A, saying: “If one desires to preserve and ingest the qi of sun and moon, one must understand the phenomena of sun and moon. The sun is round in shape yet square in radiance; the moon is square in essence yet round in appearance. Radiance hides within form, essence conceals within appearance; radiance is red, appearance is yellow — this is the soul of sun and moon. If one knows this dao, then one may breathe out and take in the flowing rosy clouds.” The method to ingest sun qi is at dawn, to gather moon brilliance at midnight, storing it nine inches before the face, letting the light and radiance shine upon the mud pellet, descending to the five viscera, penetrating the whole form, drawing qi into the mouth, light and color flourishing bright, after a long while completing, one constantly attains long life.

The Right Middle Marquis’s Lady spoke the names of Purple Tenuity.

*The Supreme One Emperor’s Secret Scripture of the Great Elixir — The Mysterious Classic of Cavernous Truth* is such a precious scripture, stored within the Supreme Sixfold Purple Chamber, under the lordship of the Southern Pole Primordial Sovereign, hence called the Great Elixir Secret Scripture. This scripture has other names: Emperor’s Seven Transformations of Radiance and Nine Forms; Supreme One’s Three Degrees, Emperor’s Treasure and Five Essences; Emperor One’s Mixed Three and Five Completion. Each corresponds to the treasures of the four seasons, thus encompassing the scripture of the Supreme One as a whole. Whoever possesses it shall not die; those who revere it shall live long; those who preserve it become spirits and immortals; those diligent in it become true numinous beings.

The Supreme One Void-born Upper Mysterious Dao Lord commands the Supreme Ultimate Perfected to dispatch nine Jade Blossom Maidens and seven Golden Blossom Morning Boys to guard the Cavernous Truth Mysterious Scripture, to protect the body of the scripture bearer, and to shield the soul of those who wear the talisman. The Jade Boys and Maidens record all sins and merits, speaking of those who practice with affection. If you have this scripture, establish a secret chamber, keep your sleeping place pure and undisturbed, proclaim and communicate with the dark assembly, aiming for true qi. Always burn incense on left and right, bathe frequently, silently preserve the spirit, so that none may perceive.

The Supreme Ultimate Perfected recorded in the three springs: “The Supreme One Emperor’s Secret Scripture of the Great Elixir — The Mysterious Classic of Cavernous Truth.” In the three summers: “Emperor’s Seven Transformations of Radiance and Nine Forms.” In the three autumns: “Supreme One’s Three Degrees, Emperor’s Treasure and Five Essences.” In the three winters: “Emperor One’s Mixed Three and Five Completion.” Hence the four seasons bear different titles, arising with the festival’s cycle, the so-called mixing of myriad transformations, not fixed to one name — this is the scripture of the Ultimate Dao, to reach true numinosity.

To study the dao without the Supreme One is like looking without two feet; to preserve thought without the Supreme One is like a chest and belly without the five viscera; to govern the spirit without the Supreme One is like setting out without four limbs; to establish the body without the Supreme One is like a corpse stiff without qi. Therefore this scripture opens all myriad spirits, generates soul ferries, a thousand paths and a hundred ways — one must have the Supreme One to establish a person. Those who study without a master only toil in vain.

Now, separately composed is the scripture’s wave and flow, excerpted beyond its margins, not yet revealing the profound subtlety, nor covering the secret chants, called the Supreme One Separate Formula. If one can find it, one may awaken from beginning to end, suddenly opening the deep source. Even if the separate formula is subtle and practiced by learners, they only touch the coarse traces to awaken jade consciousness. As for the profound inner structure, uniting myriad ferries, flowing meetings of true spirits, mixing numinous mansions, splendid beyond the transformations of spirit and radiance, shining forth beyond creation, glowing like a perfect orb, silent like the Great Nothing, rising thickly to knot clouds, condensing thought for a thousand years through the night — truly subtle and deep indeed.

This is the love of the Supreme One; all principles are exhausted in this scripture, all affairs pertain to the Cavernous Mystery.

The lady is born of Heaven’s soul, formed in primordial spirit, revolving the nine qi, holding the life of the Supreme One, opening the gates of the three paths, accumulating spirits in hidden offices, thus the mysterious fluid entwines seven times, flowing ferries spreading blessings, sun and moon reflecting the six voids, mouth and eyes moving their sacred instruments, cloud-walking and rain-bestowing, virtue matching Heaven and Earth, born within the womb, five causes all present, establishing the dao of man — such is the way.

The five causes are the five spirits; the three paths are the three truths. The five spirits are the souls of Heaven; the three truths are the dao of Heaven; the nine qi are the womb of Heaven; the Supreme One is the source of Heaven; sun and moon are the eyes of Heaven; mysterious fluid is the moisture of Heaven; six voids are the light of Heaven; hidden palace is the mansion of Heaven; sacred instruments are the transformations of Heaven; primordial spirit is the emperor’s transformation.

All that speaks of nine qi is the mixed transformations of the emperor lord; transformed into nine, this is called the nine palaces, mixed and transformed yet one. Those who wish to cultivate themselves and seek life must begin from their place of birth — the place of birth means the primordial father and mysterious mother. The primordial father governs qi, transforming principle as the emperor’s predecessor; the mysterious mother governs essence, transforming and forming the fetus. Essence and qi complement each other like yin and yang begetting; clouds walk the self, dao unites the nameless, numbers rise in threes and fives, the self begins to receive form; seven and nine complete their cycles, the self’s body is thus formed, harmonizing three and five, seven and nine penetrating the dark, symbolizing before the emperor. One must have the emperor’s management, the heavenly sovereign’s work; the nine transformations become numinous, the work completes the human body, body and spirit together; if spirit leaves, death; if spirit guards, life.

Therefore the three origins are the beginning of the dao; the emperor lord is the root of the dao; the Supreme One is the transformation of the dao; the nine heavens are the spirits of the dao; the nine palaces are the dwelling of the dao; the mysterious field is the garden of the dao; mysterious fluid is the ferry of the dao. Cultivate for three years, you may see the mirror of the three fields, to reach spirit immortality, morning visiting the six directions, evening guarding the mud pellet, firmly holding the fetal essence, heart always joyful.

Later learners must take this as their cause; when seeing this scripture, only then may one speak of the Nine Black Pottery Annotations, the Supreme One’s movement of spirit. Since you have become human, and humans are many, without the Supreme One’s numinous slips, the three origins’ golden names, the life-command hidden talisman, the five elders’ purple registers — though receiving Heaven’s qi and born, none may hear or see the Ultimate Dao.

If you lack the mysterious palace’s purple talisman, the supreme emperor’s precious name, the Supreme One’s jade register, the Eastern Splendor’s secret chart, the three origins’ spirit inscriptions, the Supreme Emperor’s soul participation — though receiving Heaven’s nature and briefly hearing the Ultimate Dao, you still cannot cultivate it, cannot endure long, long but not firm, firm but not focused, focused but cannot penetrate. Merely able to hide and preserve the Five Mountains, ascend the path of constant life, but cannot transcend the eight scenes beyond the night, floating smoke controlling radiance, flying and soaring ethereal feathers, leaping and dancing the Great Nothing.

If you lack the jade terrace feather talisman, flowing clouds five corrections, Supreme One golden pavilion, five emperors’ secret talisman, the later sages’ seven talismans, empty mountain stone box, elixir terrace pure chapters, mysterious yellow five phases heavenly mother’s embrace chart, Supreme Highest Round Name preserving true elegant qi nine refinements of spirit body record — all these you cannot see the Cavernous Truth Mysterious Scripture, nor behold the Supreme One’s transformations, nor hear the chants of dispelling demons, divine tiger wisdom, nor hear the Supreme Hidden Scripture’s eight elements, nor hear the Great Cavernous Truth Scripture’s thirty-nine chapters, gold truth jade light illuminating the seven origins.

The scripture of the Ultimate Dao is deep and dark, only through diligent heart and preserved thought, focused mind and dark assembly, then spirit opens movement, god secretly responds, nine spirits gather, Supreme One’s slips gradually heard, the gate of mystery, the source of life — subtle and profound indeed. How can one not strive?

Preserve thought of the Supreme One, mixing the emperor’s predecessor, male and female guarding spirit, pouring forth vast clarity, always making the nine heavens’ qi flow smoothly, then one merges with nine to complete. The essence of Cavernous Truth is that one body always remains, ferry and blood self-generate, male guards the life gate, female guards the spirit chamber, Supreme One never departs, simultaneous with Heaven.

Hence the Supreme Hidden Talisman says: Preserve the male, guard the female, so Heaven and Earth cannot fill it. Once preserved, the five spirits guard the dwelling, the five viscera produce flowers, spirit rests in the crimson palace, the emperor guards the mud pellet, a hundred spirits firmly hold, the fetus seals the life gate. Long after, the three-one spirit appears at dusk, Supreme One emperor’s predecessor descends at dawn, appearing in form at your sleeping place.

You must be pure and fast, cut off external affairs, block evil paths, regulate all persons, rarely engage in cultivation, concentrate the spirit on one, morning and evening cultivate the dao, diligently without cessation, bathe in five fragrances, isolate a quiet chamber, burn incense left and right, aiming for true qi.

The dao of the Supreme One especially forbids seeing blood, foul odors, decay, filth qi; if tears fall and drop, the emperor lord grieves and is disturbed; if crying sounds issue from the mouth, the Supreme One congeals. When the Supreme One congeals, the nine qi stop and do not transform; the three-one grieves and does not gather. If nine qi do not transform, the three-one also congeals; congealed and stagnant day by day, then vital qi leaks out, and old qi flows in. Old qi flowing in is the beginning of illness and death.

Therefore the perfected say crying is the sound of death’s end; tears are the leaking essence’s ferry — one must be cautious and avoid them. If one sees a corpse, or mourns for days, the emperor lord is offended, banished to the Supreme, the Supreme One tested, condemned to the mysterious void. Within three years, you surely perish.

Those who do not accept the Supreme Dao cannot be the same as students. Hence the utmost taboo is mourning, decay, filth, sorrow, tears — these are the Supreme One emperor lord’s most intense worries. Also, one must not face a corpse; after receiving the scripture, if one sees forty-nine corpses, one cannot live long, surely the dao is cut and life ends. If one sees twenty-four corpses, one must temporarily pass through the Great Yin, then rise to immortality.

Because the corpse’s form is already gazed upon by two eyes, the corpse ghost’s fetus also lingers entwined in human thought; human thought’s preservation is recorded in the crimson palace; what the crimson palace knows, even if forgotten, still remains; it should gradually return to the body manifesting the corpse, sealing the eyes of thought and memory — you must be very cautious.

Seeing bloody corpses, death, decay, filth, mourning, tears — all are the Supreme One’s utmost taboos. If always pure and fasting, then preserved thought easily senses, spirit and mind gather, Supreme One guards life, rejoicing and mixing, practicing for eighteen years, white day ascends to Heaven. This is the perfected’s way of returning old age and reversing infancy.

Always bathe in five fragrances. The five fragrances are the green wood incense. The green wood flower and leaves have five nodes, each five connected, hence called the five fragrant grass. It wards off evil qi, checks soul and spirit, controls ghost smoke, summons numinous traces, because it has the five-by-five nodes, thus beneficial to humans. This incense mostly grows east of the Canglang, so the eastern gods and immortals name it green wood incense.

Also said: Burning green wood incense, and fumigating with Lu Anxi glue at the sleeping place’s head and face, opens the view of the five impurities, stops the earthly demons’ evil qi, ascending straight up forty li to Heaven. This incense’s smoke breaks the turbid qi of vision, clears away evil filth’s mist, so heavenly humans, jade maidens, Supreme One emperor and sovereign descend with the incense qi, resting between your face and eyes.

Burn incense at midnight, always preserve and do it, do not neglect or forget.

Preserve the three-one, guard the Supreme One, refine the chamber, meet the emperor lord, then transform and produce nine spirits within your form, assist your spirit brightness, complete your immortal truth, protect your long life, solidify your fetal soul.

White Origin, No Hero, Peach Health, Life Controller, Supreme One — mixing five spirits, holding registers and talismans. The five spirits each have their lord, mixing nine transformations, three-five cavernous transformations; thus the three palaces guard truth, a hundred joints receive spirits, emperor lord’s precious registers, fate unshifting, revolving in mist and smoke, opening mysterious essence.

The twenty-four truths suddenly arise, opening upper origin, below opening eight darks, left facing six Jia, right commanding six Ding, Jade Blossom leading the sun, Supreme One combining form, a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, raising the body to ascend morning, white day ascending to Heaven.

Those perfected who cultivate this Supreme One dao all attain the raising of the three heavens, hence said raising the body to ascend morning, white day ascending to Heaven. At cockcrow one ascends the empty void, like midday sun, reaching above the three heavens. The sun’s zenith is white day; cockcrow’s beginning is ascending morning; thus preserving Supreme One mixing often uses parrot’s cry and vital qi time.

If you have the Supreme One Cavernous Truth Mysterious Scripture, keep it in a separate pouch, sealed with precious instruments, placed on the altar, always bowing as if serving lord and father. Whatever you do or face, first open with a report and bow thrice, secretly call the nine names of the Supreme One lords, then speak your wishes and requests; dreams respond to divination of auspiciousness or misfortune. If your heart is precise and sincere, when lying down to sleep, you will have immediate response.

If you should recite, practice, observe, write a separate copy to keep on the desk. The scripture on the altar is regarded as the supreme treasure.

The three origins’ hidden transformations form three palaces, named Supreme Clarity, Supreme Simplicity, Supreme Harmony. Three times three is nine; hence there are three elixir fields, also three chambers, combining the upper three origins, thus nine palaces.

Within the nine heavens and nine palaces dwell nine spirits, called the Nine Souls of the Heavenly Sovereign, transforming into nine qi, becoming nine spirits, each governing one palace — hence nine palaces.

Within Supreme Clarity are Supreme Simplicity and Supreme Harmony; within the chambers are Bright Hall and Crimson Palace — these are called the six mansions. Above is the heavenly mansion, below the cavernous platform.

The numbers three and five differ in position. One is within Supreme Clarity, the three-five emperor lords; two is the three-one elixir field spirits. The five are the spirits of talisman registers: Supreme One, Prince, White Origin, Life Controller, Peach Health Lord — combined called the three-five, each with their palace and chamber.

If the three truths each rest in their palace, the five spirits appear above the emperor lord. To the emperor lord’s left are the primordial elders, to the right the Mysterious One Elder Lord. This is the so-called nine lords within the boundless, the highest being the True One.

The nine lords are called the souls of Heaven, naturally becoming true sons, serving as the signs of spirit. If one knows the nine lords’ essence, deeply contemplates the three truths, one can use the single body to revolve among the three and five, repeatedly wrapping seven and nine, so that the heavenly emperor’s spirit soul always governs the self, five spirits holding registers, revolving again and again, surely ascending the white day — how could one merely not die!

The emperor lord mixes and transforms, revolving three and five, Supreme One’s myriad changes, forming seven and nine, their number combining to twenty-four. Heaven has twenty-four qi, qi’s upper transformation. Changed, it becomes perfected person; people also receive it, thus the body has twenty-four spirits, spirits have a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, cloud-walking within the eight extremes.

If you think to preserve and remember, be careful not to forget, you can ward off death and seek life, ascend above the Ten Directions. Thus spirit rests and qi penetrates, above communicating with Heaven, surpassing the Earth’s gate, passing the Heaven’s gate, hiding and resting in the four directions, seven stars scattering and dividing, flying through cloud chambers, sun and moon nurturing roots, guarding golden treasury jade, commanding myriad spirits — who is the immortal king? I have already become its truth.

This hidden preservation dao also has scripture formulas in the Supreme Emperor’s supreme treasure radiance chapter. Since you have it, do not spread recklessly; you must swear an oath, carefully discerning the person before revealing.

The Supreme One is the honored, the myriad transformations of seven and nine, the so-called one changes into myriad thousands, seven and nine return again, the heavenly dao is not distant, three and five return again. If you know the one honored, you live long and fly as immortal; if you know three and five, you roam the world; if you do not know the one honored, though born you have no root; if you do not know three and five, the body returns to earth. This is true.

*The Great Cavernous Truth Scripture* says: Heaven has nine souls, cannot be undivided; dao has three truths, cannot leave the body; emperor one transforms radiance, myriad changes reach completion; flowing pearls stop brightness, purple clouds leap smoke, seven degrees of turning paths, three lights reflect truth, Supreme Highest essence talisman, mutually intimate. Such words are wondrous.

Also *The High Supreme Divine Heaven Scripture* says: Soul is born from no place, spread in nine palaces; dao issues from three poles, always roaming the crimson palace; three palaces combine and transform, called the purple chamber; the purple chamber’s location first from Bright Hall; the sign can know it, when opening the golden gate. The golden gate is within the chamber. Also says: Mix and unite, entering and exiting the emperor’s square; three and five combine as one, surely becoming immortal king. This means the time of mixing, the dao of three truths and five spirits. The emperor’s square is the Supreme Clarity domain.

Hence *The Great Cavernous Truth Scripture Middle Chapter* says: Two elders on left and right, emperor soul cannot be undivided; three nine transform their upper and lower; Supreme One stands in the middle root; five spirits serve my birth registers; life controller seals my death gate; nine palaces combine as one; six directions total and internal truth. This means distinguishing their palaces, mixing their transformations. This dao is the Supreme Highest precious practice, root of long life, establishing man’s emperor predecessor, the origin of the dao, the immortal clan of the birth mansion, the emperor’s secret chapter, the marvel of cavernous truth, the essential scripture of nine palaces.

*The Nine Truths Middle Scripture* says: Nine souls separate and unite, three lights shine together; heavenly sovereign in origin, purple smoke billowing; five spirits serve the chart, nature and life not lacking; transforming into nine palaces, wearing crimson robes, tiger-patterned belts, flowing clouds embroidered cloaks, pavilion cloaks mottled, five colors wandering, sun and moon observing, gallantly east and west; spirit court’s inner body, to remove thirst and hunger; three and five return again, turning and hiding mechanisms, revolving Supreme One, generating balance of yin and yang.

This middle scripture explains the Supreme One’s name and affairs, thus recorded here.

At midnight vital qi time, at cockcrow, lying down with eyes closed, slight qi, preserve the left eye emitting sun, right eye emitting moon, both nine inches wide, above both ears. Above both ears is called the Six Directions High Window. Let sun and moon illuminate the whole body, penetrating the mud pellet, descending to the five viscera, intestines and stomach, all clearly perceived, penetrating inside and out. Let the whole body merge with sun and moon light, after a long while complete, knock teeth nine times, swallow saliva nine times, then softly chant:

“Supreme Highest Mysterious One, nine emperors spit essence, three five seven transformations, penetrating and observing the dark, sun and moon hanging light, descending through spirit court, gallantly illuminating six directions, Supreme One Yellow Tranquility, emperor lord’s command slips, golden script unshaken, five elders serve talisman, Heaven and Earth together sincere, make me immortal, achieve true numinosity, restrain myriad evils, disasters vanish peacefully, ascend before heavenly sovereign, return old and reverse infant, Supreme Emperor has decree, a hundred spirits respectfully listen.”

Complete, then open eyes. This is called sun and moon refining root, three origins calibrating soul, to govern form and spirit, ward off all ghost qi invasions, making the self long-lived and immortal, preserved every evening.

Also preserve left eye as sun, right eye as moon, merging in spirit court, then ascend into Bright Hall, transform and produce yellow essence nectar, flowing down the mouth, nine swallows, to nourish Supreme One. Always at vital qi time preserve it, then softly chant:

“Sun and moon upper essence, yellow water moon brilliance, Supreme One comes to drink, spirit light high spread, make me long-lived, Heaven and Earth together.”

Complete. Do this five days.

The tongue on the mouth is spirit court; after preserving sun and moon, move the tongue, feeling yellow spring like purple gold color rising from the tongue, flowing up into Bright Hall, called yellow essence nectar. When preserving thought, close eyes and cease thought.

Always on the evening of the new moon, at vital qi time, lie down with eyes closed facing upward, heart preserving the twenty-four stars, each star one inch large, connected as if linked. Also preserve one star within, each having one person, altogether twenty-four persons, all like newborn infants without clothes. Then the twenty-four stars descend directly from heaven’s void, circling the body three times outside. After three circles complete, swallow each in order into the mouth, making twenty-four swallows; each swallow feels like swallowing a star. Feeling the star light going straight to the navel, the navel called the palace of receiving life. Also feeling star light illuminating the abdomen, penetrating five viscera.

Also preserve star light transforming into twenty-four perfected persons, spitting yellow qi like smoke, filling the navel, thick and penetrating inside and out. After a long while, softly chant:

“Twenty-four truths, return into Yellow Court, mouth spits yellow qi, twenty-four stars irrigate my life gate, a hundred spirits receive spirit, make my bones strong, soul and spirit peaceful, five viscera receive talisman, Heaven and Earth incline to each other.”

Complete. This is called true qi entering and guarding life gate, to ward off disasters, a hundred ghosts’ diseases, making one long-lived and immortal.

The Great Nothing mixed, symbolizes one spirit void-born son, called the Supreme Emperor Lord. Also dwelling in the mud pellet emperor, called the three-one honored emperor. The honored emperor is the void-born son. These are the three emperors.

The Supreme One is born in the void cavern, transforming in eight directions, establishing radiance between the three emperors, flowing and meeting the myriad spirits’ leaders. The honor of Heaven and Earth all require the Supreme One to self-move.

The numinous emperor without Supreme One, then the mysterious void does not return qi; the honored emperor without Supreme One, then the three-one does not dwell in its palace domain. Therefore the Supreme One’s spirit, together with five spirits, is used universally, residing in the three emperors’ bodies. The emperor’s height is like the Heavenly Sovereign Emperor Lord.

Equal in form are nine souls; souls born in three and five; three and five unite and meet, forming the emperor lord. When the emperor is born, he receives mysterious upper qi, the place where three and five separate and unite. Thus the emperor is born outside the boundless, formed in mystery, seen in Supreme Clarity domain, governing in Jade Clarity Purple Tenuity Palace, shining five colors, splendid canopy nine layers, front opening mud pellet, rear opening hidden gate, below facing six directions, above connecting purple clouds, a hundred officials guarding, flying pavilions communicating, jade halls and vermilion steps, inside golden rooms, middle with Supreme Truth, called Heavenly Sovereign, born relying on void, dwelling in boundlessness, wearing five-colored beaded robes, crowned with nine virtues morning crown, commanding heavenly ridge, riding jade dragon with six reins, soaring through void nine paths freely.

This is the natural essence qi, the emperor lord of myriad truths, always thinking of and reciting it, can become immortal king.

Within Supreme Microcosm are three emperors: one called Emperor Lord, two called Heavenly Sovereign, three called Emperor Elder. These are all the three origins’ qi, naturally mixed true forms. Each origin has one lord, all residing in Supreme Clarity.

Supreme Clarity has three palaces: highest is the Heavenly Sovereign Emperor Lord’s palace, left is Supreme Simplicity Palace, right is Supreme Harmony Palace. The three palaces reside at the mud pellet gate, inside boundlessness.

Therefore Emperor Lord governs one, holding spirit firmness; Heavenly Sovereign governs two, transforming radiance guarding form; Emperor Elder oversees three, maintaining and regulating myriad spirits; Supreme One mixes and unites, forming and giving birth to the self.

Thus three and five divide and transform, filling the nine palaces. Therefore the Supreme One’s spirit is the lord of transformation and birth.

Supreme Simplicity Lord is the original perfected Laozi, also Heaven’s soul, governing within Supreme Clarity, inside Gouchen, always attending the emperor lord, master of true original qi, called Great Simplicity Lord.

Supreme Harmony Lord is the imperial perfected Laozi, Heaven’s spirit, also governing Supreme Clarity Gouchen, called Supreme Harmony Lord, always attending heavenly emperor, master of fetal original qi.

Supreme Simplicity and Supreme Harmony Lords are the souls and spirits of Heaven, born of nature? Supreme Simplicity original perfected Laozi always attends emperor lord in Supreme Clarity; imperial perfected Laozi always attends heavenly emperor, entering and exiting Purple Tenuity, residing in Kunlun, Yellow Gate Purple Chamber, Supreme One consulting, chaotic three qi, root of the great dao. You must always think of this, emperor comes and lasts long.

On the second and third night of the moon, at midnight vital qi time, lie down with eyes closed, first think of the Supreme Ultimate Emperor Lord, then think of the left original perfected Laozi, wearing blue robes, crowned with nine splendid rays, left hand holding blue ganoderma, right hand holding blue banner; then think of the right Supreme Harmony Lord, imperial perfected Laozi, wearing white robes, crowned with five splendid white rays, left hand holding golden night paddle, right hand holding white banner, all within the Supreme Ultimate.

Within the Supreme Ultimate are nine names; within Supreme Clarity are five emperors, six mansions, nine officials, all domains the same: one Supreme Clarity, two Supreme Ultimate, three Supreme Microcosm, four Purple Chamber, five Mysterious Platform, six Emperor Hall, seven Heavenly Mansion, eight Yellow Palace, nine Jade Capital Mysterious Metropolis.

In brief: from the nape of the neck straight down one inch is the Supreme Ultimate Palace; the Supreme Ultimate Palace is one inch square, above the Six Directions Palace. The Six Directions Palace is where the Supreme One spirit dwells. From between the two eyebrows inward one inch is Bright Hall; inward two inches is the chamber; inward three inches is the elixir field. North of Bright Hall, south of chamber, one inch above between the eyebrows is the Six Directions Palace, one inch square.

After preserving the three perfected, also preserve my soul as one person, like my form, ascending into Supreme Ultimate Palace. The two elders give ganoderma and golden liquid paddle to see and offer, then preserve eating ganoderma and drinking paddle. Ganoderma looks like lotus flower; paddle like fine wine. After eating and drinking, then again preserve and bow before emperor lord, saying:

“Today I report to the Green Emperor Lord in the courtyard, granting divine ganoderma and golden liquid jade paddle, two elders overseeing registers, Supreme One serving the edict, long life and great vision, lifespan unending.”

Then preserve emperor lord’s reply: “Fortunate indeed, serving on the second and third days of the month again.” Complete, then take and ingest. Called receiving emperor’s medicine within the Purple Chamber.

Hence *The Scripture of Dispelling Demons* says: The soul may seek food, ascending to Supreme Ultimate, two elders granting command, emperor lord’s power — this is what it means.

When preserving thought of Supreme Ultimate, all must enter from between the two eyebrows. Between the two eyebrows is the jade gate of the mud pellet, called Guarding the Inch, Yellow Gate Purple Chamber.

Always on your birth day, or the first day of the first month, or the sixth Wu day at noon, put on cap and belt, enter the chamber facing north, bow twice, chant:

“High Emperor Lord, Supreme Jade Morning, Sovereign Heaven Primordial Elder, Supreme Great Dao, great-grandson Wang Jia, wish emperor lord long peace over self in Purple Chamber Palace.”

That night at fixed time, enter secret chamber, lie down with eyes closed facing upward, preserve thought of the Great Star at the center of the Northern Dipper Supreme Ultimate, essence shining with pure yellow light qi descending, preserve the self before, draw into mouth, swallow thirty-seven times and stop. Preserve to make yellow essence harmonize qi, fill Supreme Granary Yellow Court middle and lower elixir field, descend to Yin chamber earth gate, circulate throughout body, all made complete.

Then again think of five persons in Purple Chamber Palace, suddenly appearing as five emperors; Heavenly Sovereign Emperor Lord in center; Supreme One coming above; kneel before emperor, present life registers, life controller standing behind, removing death records. Preserve to erase death records. Death records are black slips with white writing; life records are white slips with blue writing.

Preserve seeing white jade slips, blue brush, life controller presenting these white slips and blue brush to emperor lord; emperor lord bows southward and writes: “Certain county village Wang Jia, style Yi, birth record year, long life upper mystery, all wishes fulfilled, true and immortal, all who see say perfected, Supreme One may command, protect Jia’s body, eternally nourish sun and moon, lifespan a million years.”

Also preserve a register slip one inch long, five fen wide. Think of writing characters clearly. Then preserve Supreme One, Prince, White Origin, Life Controller, Peach Lord five persons, from Six Directions Palace ascending into Purple Chamber, each presenting a blue jade desk, each desk with a talisman, talisman blue-green, to present to emperor lord. Emperor lord takes each talisman in turn, giving to those facing, together transforming the four emperors.

One emperor named Carved Beam Boundary, style Qingping; one emperor named Long Come Awake, style Nanhe; one emperor named Manifest Peaceful Fortune, style Xihua; one emperor named Protect Achieve What, style Beifa. Preserve these four emperors, and read five talismans together. After reading, give to the self; self receiving talisman kneels before emperor lord and takes them in turn.

Preserve one talisman one inch long, five fen wide. Complete, then preserve four emperors ascending from void, rising three heavens, each telling the self: “If you can always preserve my name, you will ward off myriad harms, live long and immortal. I am Supreme Highest’s child, true within three origins, crossing your life registers and five talismans into form, thus eternally preserving Heaven and Earth, attaining immortal spirits.”

If spring month, preserve Qingping emperor, with blue liquid nectar, served in blue jade bowl one sheng, given to take and ingest; after ingesting, four emperors all ascend three heavens. Summer month, preserve Nanhe emperor; the four seasons follow similarly. The nectar bowl’s color also follows spring, summer, autumn, winter.

Also preserve emperor lord’s left side has Mysterious One Elder Lord, wearing purple robes, dragon crown; right side has Three Simplicity Elder Lord, wearing brocade robes, tiger crown. The dragon and tiger crowns resemble worldly traveling crowns with dragon and tiger patterns.

Mysterious One Elder Lord named Lin Xu Fu, style Spirit Time Dao. Three Simplicity Elder Lord named Lao Zhang Shang, style Spirit Birth Dao. Both elders follow the Zhengyi perfected behind; their left perfected is Zhong Chengzi, also called Emperor Guest, style Four Splendors; right perfected Qu Wenzi, also called Light Firm, style Spirit Harmony, wearing robes and crowns like the two elders.

Afterward preserve Life Controller descending to Six Directions, visiting Supreme One Palace; Life Controller merges form with Supreme One; Supreme One again petitions emperor lord, crossing self’s talisman registers. Supreme One opens to emperor lord: “Talisman registers crossed, Life Controller merges form, four emperors grant nectar, Supreme Highest records life, requesting scripture name,” then issues register to two elder lords.

Emperor lord suddenly from bosom produces life registers, giving to left elder; again produces five talismans, giving to right elder. The two elders receive registers, saying to emperor lord: “Certain Jia’s birth record fixed, long preserved in world, emperor talisman five elements recorded in Supreme Simplicity Palace.” Then two elders command two Zhengyi perfected Zhong Chengzi and Qu Wenzi to carry Jia’s life registers and five talismans, ascend to Jade Clarity Supreme Simplicity Supreme Highest Three Origins Supreme Clarity High Mysterious Lords’ Nine Heavens Palace, proclaiming emperor to cross Jia’s birth register, enabling spirit immortal, called True Worthy. Two elders have command, all record accordingly. Then the two go to Nine Heavens, after a while complete.

Also preserve Life Controller and Supreme One dividing form, each as one person, jointly roaming Supreme Clarity, inspecting and governing one body’s hundred spirits, upper and lower all complete, each returning to their palace. This is called Hundred Spirits Mixed Original Life Emperor Lord Great Transformation Dao.

When five emperors fix records, two elders fix life meeting.

When mixing original life, many affairs are complicated; those who cannot reach understanding may enter secret chamber, read text and perform accordingly.

The three-one spirit in mud pellet elixir field palace has a separate heavenly emperor lord, the Purple Chamber emperor lord’s child. When mixing original life, first preserve three-one heavenly emperor, crimson palace, life gate three spirits, each resting in their palace; this palace has a separate three-one scripture.

Now what is mixed and transformed into myriad changes is not the three-one heavenly emperor. The three-one heavenly emperor again has times of mixing, each with different methods, methods varying accordingly.

Emperor lord governs transformation, Supreme One governs birth, Life Controller governs fate, No Hero governs essence, White Origin governs soul and spirit, Peach Health governs spirit numinosity.

People have five registers and five talismans, receiving from emperor lord; five spirits hold them, each governing one; interlocking original life, removing death and ascending life. Without Supreme One’s matter, nothing lives. Even if one aspires to dao and seeks life, with utmost sincerity and empty exhaustion, no benefit.

Even if possessing supreme virtue of Heaven and Earth, merits manifesting in Three Officials, gentle benevolent conduct, deeply affecting myriad spirits, if unaware of preserving Emperor Lord, cultivating inward three and five, returning five registers and serving five talismans, letting Supreme One petition emperor lord for life registers and immortality, still cannot cross seven and nine, above supplementing immortal officials.

The various emperor lords, two elders, and three truths, five spirits’ names must be carefully not shown to others, lest disaster destroy your family. Supreme One’s precious formula is transmitted only after oath. The precious formula is the Cavernous Truth Mysterious Scripture. First examine the person, then swear by gold and blue, replacing blood oath.

Also daily keep in mind, always let three souls enter Supreme Ultimate Palace, revolving with emperor lord is best. Also always on birth day, do not speak evil matters, close chamber preserving life qi, able to do good deeds, be cautious not to violate.

Supreme One is the fetal essence, lord of transformation. Soul and spirit born of fetal spirit, life qi issued from fetal mansion, transforming and uniting emperor lord, mixing and transforming into man. Therefore Supreme One’s spirit is mother of birth; emperor lord’s honor is father of birth.

Supreme One named Wu You Shou, style Gui Hui Chang, also named Jie Ming, also named Ji Pin. These are the true names of the three origins’ cavernous mystery inner precious scripture; outer formulas and miscellaneous excerpts’ names are all false and untrue.

Now these names are very secret, not to be told to others. Those who know them live long and immortal, ward off myriad disasters, can summon spirit jade maidens to descend. Every evening preserve Supreme One in your own Six Directions Palace, or preserve Supreme One on left or right of self, sitting, lying, facing back, all present. All done at vital qi time, then chant:

“Supreme One’s essence, arising in Supreme Clarity, soul and spirit receiving transformation, form and shadow becoming spirit, governing a hundred spirits, restraining three yang, emperor lord governing smoke, uniting true Hui Chang, inner settling essence qi, outer warding disasters, removing death registers, extending life, water long-lasting, clothing young and old, change and transformation without constancy, always governing six directions, revolving crimson palace, descending to cavernous gate, ascending to mysterious village, mixing three and five, resting in heavenly court, calling and drawing sun and moon, transforming male and female, governing registers and talismans, fetal sac, life and death fate, Supreme One supports and leads.”

Preserve Supreme One and self form exactly the same, clothing also the same. Thus the self’s body must always be pure and cultivated grandly, to seek meeting radiance with Supreme One. Clothing, headwear, all must not borrow from different qi. Such things must be cautious.

Since you cannot eat grains, refine and study truth, you must regulate all agitation, filth, fishy blood, mixed food, pungent and spicy vegetables — all strictly forbidden. If you can do so, gradually improve, can perhaps extend life.

Left No Hero Prince governs essence field, three origins upper qi spirit, essence field formed in heavenly essence, essence born returning to three qi. Therefore No Hero Prince always governs spirit’s talisman life. Named Mysterious Origin Uncle, style He Fuzi, also named Element Lord, also Spirit Prince, always in jade chamber Supreme Clarity. Every evening preserve thought, then chant:

“Supreme Highest Jade Truth, imperial essence connected, three origins heroic qi, Supreme Mysterious Purple Morning, nine skies upright bright, five blossoms produce smoke, Yellow Gate golden chamber, within great spirit, grasping firm flowing bell, head wearing splendid crown, purple canopy swirling whirlwind, dragon pattern tiger pattern, form like infant, four spirits equally balanced, out of elixir into void, uniting form emperor lord, calling yin summoning yang, heavenly dao has truth, named Mysterious Origin Uncle, titled No Hero Lord, roaming nine paths, dispersing transformation five constants, giving birth and supporting me, with dao long lasting.”

Right White Origin Lord, also called Cavernous Yang Lord, governs soul and spirit qi, inspecting and governing spirit fluid spirit. Therefore soul and spirit born in nine spirits’ palace, spirit fluid moves in three qi’s truth, so the lord governing is called White Origin Cavernous Yang Lord, governing soul and spirit’s talisman life.

White Origin Lord named Yu Ling Biao, style Mysterious Yi Jue, also named Vermilion Essence, also named Qi Cheng, governing in jade hall Supreme Clarity. Every evening preserve thought, then chant:

“Supreme Highest spirit essence, clear nine lords, three qi combined transformation, right at spirit gate, dragon robes tiger belt, supporting life returning soul, waist wearing jade register, yellow morning splendid crown, holding register holding talisman, breathing mixed division, named Yu Ling, titled White Origin, with me roaming, ascending to Yang Gate, revolving nine clears, within six directions, below nourishing essence fluid, mud pellet upper origin, a hundred spirits supporting generals, each guarding precious palace, inspection complete, returning to yellow chamber.”

Central Life Controller Lord, also called Life Controller Elder, governs birth year’s original life, overseeing lifespan’s register slips, Supreme One transforms soul and talisman array to Life Controller; Life Controller mixes and faces soul emperor lord.

Therefore Life Controller spirit governs years, lifespan, chief rod, length and shortness of term; thus great mixing governed by talisman registers, hence called Elder.

Named Li Ming Chu, style Mysterious Du Xiang, also named Spirit Ancestor, also Spirit Splendor, ruling in Bright Day governing Hidden Extreme Palace, governing and commanding Yin chamber, entering and exiting spirit hut’s two gates; evening governing in mysterious chamber, earth gate below, hidden palace below, above Six Directions Palace in one realm.

Yin chamber is the two nostrils. Life Controller enters and exits through nostrils, not between eyebrows. Evening in mysterious chamber is inside jade stem; earth gate is also inside scrotum.

If female preserves it, place it inside Yin gate north pole.

Every evening preserve thought, after complete, chant:

“Emperor One’s soul, transformed into nine palaces, mixing three truths, transforming radiance emperor court, hidden extreme mysterious gate, within is heavenly spirit, revolving seven movements, hundred spirits united, governing tally and calculation, Life Controller’s essence, dragon robes tiger skirt, crowned with seven stars, always with me, settling my form, titled Elder, named Li Ming, ascending talisman command, making me long-lived, three origins six mansions, myriad gates regulated, governing spirit qi, merging with self, dragon wheel wandering, jointly ascending Supreme Clarity, matching light sun and moon, deep and dark, engraving life blue register, Heaven and Earth inclined.”

Life Gate Peach Lord governs receiving qi’s life, this is the lord of original qi. Returning essence to spirit, returning essence transforming white, uniting and transforming beginning, firmly giving birth and establishing beginning, truly Heaven and Earth’s original resources, yin and yang’s spirit ancestor, golden gate jade pass chamber gate treasure, also governing life in Peach Lord’s qi.

Therefore Supreme One returns radiance, emperor lord combines soul; returning radiance and combining soul both mix and transform into myriad changes; combining soul transforms essence fluid and gives birth repeatedly.

Essence transforming beginning is sung by Peach Lord, distinguishing male and female signs.

Peach Lord named Child Dao Kang, style He Jing Yan, also named Life Jade, also Fetal Root. Bright Day governing golden gate five domains, this is the navel life gate, lower elixir field palace; evening governing Six Directions, Supreme One’s right.

Every evening preserve thought, then chant:

“Mysterious Origin binds essence, void merges smoke, fetal knot, yin and yang’s kin, Supreme Highest three qi, descending into self, a hundred joints receiving spirit, myriad spirits all arrayed, chaos into one, named Peach Lord, form like newborn, shining shining soaring to Heaven, wearing five colors, splendid wind patterns, hands holding divine talisman, uniting emperor’s soul, waist wearing tiger register, red scarf red crown, golden forest jade couch, right at life gate, mouth inhaling essence qi, strengthening my bones and joints, right has divine maiden holding vermilion banner, left has jade boy recording emperor’s words, yang black left path, mixed transformation not divided, yin qi right passing, flowing seven rotations, descending to no below, ascending to mud pellet, always roaming nine palaces, entering and exiting hidden gate, governing refining soul and spirit, between six mansions, leading and recording myriad spirits, with me together immortal.”

Right three-five mixing transforming giving birth five spirits’ method. These five spirits receive five qi’s great numinosity, talisman mysterious life’s ancestor. Born above void, below forming one body; within the body’s life, five spirits must move and rest.

The self must every evening preserve thought and chant. If cannot silently recite, can recite by day following text, need not be midnight, only vital qi time.

The three souls born in five spirits, three truths arise from five spirits; thus this dao is called mixing three-five method. Those who practice it live long and immortal; this dao is called Northern Inspection Bright Hall Traversing Spirit Purple Palace, producing and transforming three-five, greeting fetus upper origin.

Though already immortal, one should also practice it; practicing it means constant life.

When preserving thought, sitting or lying at will; if sitting, best to face birth direction. If cannot immediately think of five spirits, can first preserve two spirits, then three spirits, cycling repeatedly, starting from Supreme One.

Refined thought and preserved remembrance desire utmost purity, utmost stillness, quiet chamber or leisure room, like mountain forest, no human voices, no foul qi heard; then can practice.

First recite mixing three-five method, then close eyes and look inward, knock teeth nine times, swallow saliva nine times, then softly chant:

“Nine origins’ truth, truly has three fields, cloud chamber golden room, within five spirits, restraining and commanding firm power, transforming hidden dark, revolving mysterious mirror, encompassing Heaven and Earth, three five return again, mixing Supreme Clarity, yang qi flowing moist, transforming into nameless, with me immortal, ascending to spirit court, sun and moon facing, three lights mixing form, surpassing eight extremes, head crowned with heavenly essence, left turning right looking, hands holding seven stars, hiding body Supreme Microcosm, primordial qi together.”

After chanting, again preserve five spirits each sitting in their palace, five spirits all spitting purple qi to wrap my body, feeling purple qi thick and dense, inside and outside merging darkly, hands and feet not seeing each other, then stop.

Again preserve sun and moon emerging from my left and right cheeks, left sun right moon, two lights penetrating, then purple qi suddenly clears away.

Again preserve sun entering my mouth, then eat it; eating produces taste, nine swallows stop.

Again preserve moon entering my navel, at life gate below, illuminating Yin chamber between.

Again preserve my hand holding Northern Dipper seven stars’ handle, wearing it walking, entering Purple Chamber Supreme Microcosm Palace, seeing emperor lord.

Emperor lord says: “Your attainment of spirit immortal, your attainment of long years, I give you jade talisman, writing nine heavens.”

I bow twice, saying: “Please conceal Supreme Microcosm, unite radiance Supreme One, array attending emperor lord, revolving spirit chamber.”

Emperor lord immediately summons Supreme One, Supreme One comes before emperor lord; I then enter Supreme One’s mouth, merging form as one radiance, with Supreme One jointly one body, after a long while complete. This is called mixing Supreme Clarity, transforming into nameless, sun and moon facing, holding seven stars, same form Supreme One, hiding body emperor court.

After preserving five spirits all complete, chanting and inward viewing all thought complete, then open eyes, peck teeth five times, with left hand third finger tap under nose philtrum seven times, right hand second finger tap between eyebrows nine times; this is called warding reins three five seven nine, sealing and governing hundred spirits’ gates, letting hundred spirits settle self’s palace chambers, three truths solidify self’s body, five spirits guard self’s talisman life, emperor lord supervises self’s myriad palaces.

After finishing practice, again chant:

“Three five opposing, Heaven covers Earth begins, I have five talismans, ascending to emperor’s son, three origins long stay, palace wrapping, five colors mutually connecting, square round original record, outer warding hundred evils, inner restraining hundred histories, three truths support me, five spirits protect self, commanding and governing spirit firmness, making me immortal.”

Complete. Preserve Supreme One sitting in Six Directions Palace, thus merging with me, same form and radiance.

Then return fingers to their places, cover mouth with both hands, softly chant:

“Supreme One commands all spirits, all hold yin-yang gates, may not recklessly leave their palaces, must face emperor lord, just like three truths method, just like nine heavens’ fate. This mixing and transformation, all preserved and practiced complete.”

Supreme One always on Jiawu, Bingwu, Wuwu days at noon, descends to crimson palace, merging perfected and self body. This is called triple merging self, three truths qi, three mixed transformations.

Crimson palace perfected dwells in heart’s elixir field, Central Origin perfected dwells in its heart. *The Three-One Scripture* fully records this.

Always at noon, enter chamber preserving Supreme One descending crimson palace, crimson palace perfected suddenly merges form with Supreme One. Then preserve self entering crimson palace, suddenly again merges with Supreme One.

Thus within crimson palace, only feel Supreme One’s body, form and clothing like self’s body, but form slender and slight, like newborn infant’s beginning.

Complete, then think and preserve below both nostrils, left has sun, right has moon, sun has yellow essence red qi, moon has red essence yellow qi. Essence is the substance of two lights. Colored qi is sun and moon’s smoke. Two qi thickly come into crimson palace, crimson palace overflows, two qi again ascend into chamber, chamber overflows, then descend to Yellow Court.

Yellow Court is three inches below navel, lower elixir field palace.

Two qi full, again enter and fill Supreme Granary, two qi penetrating thickly, accumulating in stomach tube.

Preserve Supreme One ascending, right at stomach tube, facing south calling Central Origin perfected Yellow Court perfected, wearing yellow robes, yellow headband, sitting together with Supreme One, eating and drinking essence qi twenty-seven swallows.

After a long while complete, preserve Yellow Court perfected chant:

“Sun and moon’s brilliance, yellow and red two essences, round light combined qi, ascending issuing great brightness, three origins eating and drinking, Supreme One receiving spirit.”

Again preserve Supreme One and Central Origin perfected returning to crimson palace, Yellow Court perfected returning to lower elixir field palace, Supreme One and I merge form, returning to Six Directions Palace.

Complete, then chant:

“Supreme One emperor lord commands three origins, again commands me to govern hundred spirits, hundred spirits orderly staying in my body, may not recklessly enter or exit golden gate jade pass.”

After chanting, again preserve sun and moon below breasts, from both nostrils ascending into chamber, chamber has upper perfected, heavenly emperor.

Heavenly emperor is emperor lord’s child; emperor lord governs Supreme Ultimate Purple Chamber; heavenly emperor governs between two eyebrows inward three inches as mud pellet, upper elixir field palace; or governs between two eyebrows inward two inches as chamber palace.

Preserve upper one heavenly emperor, left and right hands each holding sun and moon, left hand holding sun, right hand holding moon.

Heavenly emperor first eats sun and moon; self must make nineteen swallows. After nineteen swallows complete, heavenly emperor exhales qi, qi arrives Supreme One Six Directions Palace, feeling purple smoke filling palace, Supreme One inhales purple smoke, makes nineteen swallows stop.

Called mixing three-one emperor, spreading sun and moon essence, transforming radiance three palaces myriad spirits, always living.

Above nine palaces entering emperor chamber, three five combined qi, original one seven, transforming into form and appearance, guarding secret five phases uneven same root node. This is dispelling demons’ talisman, emperor lord’s scripture.

Said three truths mutually pushing upward, five spirits receiving emperor soul downward dividing.

Always on Jiazi day midnight, preserve Supreme Micro Purple Chamber Palace, has one boy like infant, wearing vermilion robes, named Gan Jingjing, style Hui Yuanzi, right before emperor lord, holding red jade seal, on seal are five talismans and life registers.

Also preserve Supreme One coming from Six Directions Palace, ascending to emperor lord’s left. Boy says: “Talisman registers govern life, myriad spirits all listen, Jia and Yi records already written in emperor court, please Supreme One to decide Jia’s name.”

Jia is self’s name.

Emperor lord says: “Supreme One boy, myriad transformations enter self, removing death ascending life, revolving again and again, within form myriad truths, one commands chief historian.”

Thus self and boy both merge into Supreme One form, after a long while complete, again preserve Supreme One returning to Six Directions Palace.

Called mixing infant at beginning origin qi, transforming Supreme One at three truths’ border.

Hence *Great Cavernous Truth Scripture* says: Supreme Micro little boy always before emperor, named Jingjing, surname Gan, merging Supreme One, wearing vermilion clothes, five talisman life registers, holding jade seal, emperor lord’s command, governing all spirits.

Also *High Supreme Dispelling Demons Scripture* says: Xinzi Jingjing, has spirit and power, merging form three shapes, nine paths mutually pushing, clothes vermilion red, steps regular uneven, entering and exiting upper origin, Supreme Ultimate inner steps, knowing me is life, preserving me not fading, no one cries for self, relying on protection to ward off wrong, if you want to know my home, secretly ask Supreme Micro.

This is the fetal infant boy transforming fetal Supreme One’s soul. Knowing his name, all the world’s people cannot cry for self’s body. Always preserve him, ward off wrong and myriad disasters, live long and immortal.

On the day of transformation and merging, all six Jia days are auspicious, need not only use Jiazi day.

Supreme One five spirits serve five talismans and five registers, Supreme Clarity emperor lord mixing dao, seeking long life immortal formula.

Right Peach Lord talisman, written in white with cinnabar brush.

Five emperors’ inner precious talisman, Supreme One emperor lord mixing and transforming radiance dao. Can be written on birth day, five talismans together placed in brocade pouch and worn. Wearing it means long life and immortality.

Also always on birth month, with birth day and hour, enter chamber, write five talismans, face king and take at once. Complete, chant:

If wanting to often take these talismans, best on May fifth, July seventh, September ninth, midnight vital qi time, or autumn equinox midnight.

Five registers serve five talismans mixing emperor lord, always on birth day and month, March fifteenth and twenty-sixth, midnight vital qi, take a pure chamber, then can practice. Sitting or lying at will, if sitting then clasp hands facing eyes. Facing eyes means usually closed but not fully closed. If lying, close eyes and look inward, hands pat on heart, preserve emperor lord sitting in Supreme Ultimate Purple Chamber Palace, preserve Supreme Micro little boy attending emperor lord behind, preserve Supreme Simplicity original perfected attending emperor lord left, preserve Supreme Harmony imperial perfected attending emperor lord right, then preserve mud pellet palace heavenly emperor ascending Purple Chamber, facing emperor lord before.

Also preserve emperor lord, command heavenly emperor to summon Six Directions Palace five spirits.

Five spirits are Supreme One, Prince, White Origin, Life Controller, Peach Lord, all wearing vermilion robes and crimson headbands, each holding one white jade desk, each desk has one talisman, one inch long, five fen wide, register five inches long, one inch wide.

All matters distinguished, each has lord, registers on talisman above, preserving registers with village and name as above method.

Five spirits each serve, going to heavenly emperor, heavenly emperor takes in turn before emperor lord.

Emperor lord orders self’s talisman to read registers in order.

After reading, present to heavenly emperor, heavenly emperor takes and presents to emperor lord.

Emperor lord orders self to take five talismans in turn, complete.

Emperor lord commands heavenly emperor to summon crimson palace Central Origin perfected, then summon lower origin life gate perfected, to Purple Chamber.

Soon, two perfected ascend Purple Chamber before emperor lord.

Again preserve heavenly emperor, suddenly merging into emperor lord’s form, feeling entering from mouth, transforming and merging as one.

Soon, two elder lords enter emperor lord’s two nostrils.

Soon, see crimson palace and life gate two perfected, again entering emperor lord’s mouth.

Soon, see five spirits entering emperor lord’s Six Directions from left ear.

Again preserve seeing self and Supreme Micro little boy entering emperor lord’s Six Directions from right ear.

All complete, emperor lord then alone sits in Supreme Micro Purple Chamber Palace.

All spirits summoned by emperor lord already merged within form, transformed into form before emperor lord.

Preserve emperor lord chant:

Complete, self chant:

“Mixing complete, death registers extinguished, heavenly emperor has command, must not forget, hundred spirits emperor lord, each guarding their chamber.”

Then open eyes, complete.

This is the time five spirits serve talismans and registers, soul and spirit mixing method, self with refined heart thought preserving.

Right five registers five talismans mixing must produce certificate, on birth day noon, vermilion writing on blue paper, make one talisman. At midnight enter chamber preserve thought, take one talisman, face birth place.

Other talisman cut in half with knife, from black stained parts top and bottom divided, one half put in stove fire, one half in well water. Each birth day practice, called protecting spirit long life talisman, emperor lord’s life certificate.

Separately also has Supreme One outer formula talisman script, greatly different, all are middle precious emperor Chang scripture’s upper talisman. Not true ones, using them is ineffective, self must reverently and cautiously.

This is emperor lord’s constant chant of Supreme Highest void chamber spirit chapter. You must often recite it.

Its words urgently address filth and decay, I say it is mysterious.

Those who know emperor lord’s name must be avoided, be very cautious.

If self has sins and faults, wanting first to apologize and seek removal, at midnight and noon enter chamber, close eyes sitting upright, facing north preserve emperor lord in self’s Purple Chamber, preserve thought as above.
