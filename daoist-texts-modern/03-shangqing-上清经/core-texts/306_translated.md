Cloud Wuzi is said to be the scion of the Primordial Jade Void, the middle son of the Supreme Emperor. He embraced the jade embryo within the jade chamber, condensed cloud essence at the golden gate, contained sun and moon within the purple womb, transformed the vast dew to solidify spirit, refined the fetal breath to propel motion, endured kalpas to turn the wheel, transformed and was born among the Yuan clan, and informed the yang dao to attain truth.

Thus, on the first day of the third month in the first year of the Supreme Emperor, as the heavenly radiance opened the dawn, he was born above the Nine Mysteries, the supreme treasure shining in the boundless Heaven. He beheld the sun upon the cloud cliff, radiated golden visage within the jade pavilion, followed the imperial foundation in the emperor’s chart, patterned the jade elegance in naturalness, bathed in the radiance of the nine numinous lights, poured the sweet fragrance of the jade spring, drank from the spirit consort’s imperial ganoderma, nursed with nine-refined flying frost. A divine dragon flanked his side, a jade phoenix shaded his crown. Purple smoke rose above, flowing light thickened nearby. Two symbols upheld his thread, three dawns harmonized his truth. The divine realm sang his marvel, seven transformations changed his spirit, the numinous wind rushed his form, the returning fragrance stirred his dust. Above the vast void, the desolate shore of the cavern waves. At twenty-nine years, he pondered subtle thoughts and mysterious reflections, aligned with nature’s principle and motion, followed the timing of change, shunning imperial dao, roaming carefree in the central plain, delighting in the Tai Xiao, lingering in the purple heavens, gazing through kalpas, attaining the path of forgetfulness, moving beyond self-control, rising as a supreme immortal.

Hence he was named the Writing Emperor’s Token, his rank ascended to Supreme Truth, teaching the Three Primordials below, bestowed the title of Imperial Volume. At that time, he received the mandate, paid homage to the Jade Heaven, ascended the Nine Mysteries’ terrace in the Palace of Great Abundance, the Purple Phoenix Jade Capital’s seven-treasure pearl chamber, in the Hall of Bright Clouds, the Clear Fasting Jade Pavilion. Spiritual auspices announced and responded, his neck bore a round light, at night illuminating the divine candle, self-illuminating the jade hall.

Then the Void Emperor Dao Lord, above the empty cavern, within the profound void, bestowed the *Tai Xiao Langshu Qiongwen Emperor Chapter* upon the ruler. At that time, the heavenly light dimmed and reached, the three dawns returned their essence, the five lodges changed their course, the seven primordials moved their spirits, nine colors flashed and shone, radiating jade clarity, flying smoke thickened, flowing through the eight dark realms. Ascending the jade steps, myriad emperors gathered in the court, flying immortals bore feathered canopies, assisting the Supreme Truth. Immortal youths and jade maidens, each three thousand, held scarves and scattered incense, spreading fragrance and sweeping dust.

Then the command was issued, summoning the five spirits, flying through the heavens in revolving wheels, riding the empty net of smoke, the divine phoenix held the reins, the spirit consort guided the immortals, the bright emperor opened the path, the three ways united in brilliance, flowing lightning raised essence, the swift chariot traversed the Nine Mysteries, gazing upon the jade palace, feasting in the three primordials’ light, circling the jade heavens, roaming the purple dawn.

Thus the Langshu was unfurled at the boundless cliff, the emperor’s chapter recited amidst the blue clouds, the lodging of the roots of fate in the jade formula, the command of awe and spirit in the jade text, singing wondrous melodies in the cavern, meditating quietly in the jade pavilion, ordering the two principles in the profound chart, holding the emperor’s register among myriad immortals, commanding the earthly offices of the Five Peaks, leading the Supreme Truth through the Three Passes, governing the boundless below, encompassing the cavern source. From Heaven downward, none but submit to the Supreme Truth. The spirit is unfathomable, transformation unnameable, the near is hard to discuss, the distant impossible to seek, the clear hard to muddy, the mixed hard to clarify, subtle and wondrous indeed! This is the emperor spirit of utmost virtue, majestic and exalted.

The Tai Xiao Langshu is the melody of the Nine Heavens’ kings flying through the skies; the Qiongwen Emperor Chapter is the upper text of the Nine Heavens. Both arise from the Primordial’s beginning, born within the natural cavern. The Void Emperor Jade Emperor received it from the Nine Mysteries. Thus the heavenly kings recorded their names, forged gold into slips, carved jade into chapters, gold-engraved and jade-inscribed to reveal the treasured text. Secreted above the Nine Heavens, in the Palace of Great Abundance, the Western Splendor jade maidens and Golden Dawn jade youths, each three thousand, serve and guard with incense. Thus the nine emperors, the supreme sages, ascend the jade steps thrice each month, attend divine banquets, operate through myriad kalpas, transmit to the Supreme Truth King. Their dao is lofty and subtle, the source of many scriptures, spirits outstanding and elegant, essence crowning the Nine Heavens, jade wisdom clear and bright, cavernous delight entering mystery. Only those of the highest truth may partake; all others are already perfected immortals, not transmitted to mid-level immortals.

The Tai Xiao Langshu is the melody of the Nine Heavens’ kings flying through the skies; the Qiongwen Emperor Chapter is the path of high numinous mystery, the essence of the Nine Heavens, supervising myriad energies, commanding all scriptures. Whoever cultivates the *Great Cavern Thirty-Nine Chapters*, harmonizing wind and mixing the emperor’s unity dao, or the *Female-One Jade Inspection Five Elders Treasure Scripture*, explaining the lodging of roots, extracting transcendence from the seven mysteries—without this text, the treasury of the Nine Heavens will not accept their sound, the nine energies entangled, spirits displeased, heavenly demons invade the light, myriad trials come to obstruct, thoughts fail to penetrate subtlety, Heaven does not open the gate. Whoever cultivates the scriptures, regards the Qiongwen as foremost, chanting in the silent chamber, quieting in the rosy courtyard, communicating through the nine skies, arranging the upper mystery, startling the jade palace’s listeners, myriad truths attend the pavilion, demons submit their sleeves, myriad trials dare not advance. Whatever is cultivated at will, thus attains true dao, all dao perfected, soaring body to the Great Clarity. The essential secret is not complicated; it lies precisely in this scripture. With focused heart and bitter effort, one may attain the supreme immortal.

Cloud Wuzi did not cultivate other paths; he received the Void Emperor’s *Tai Xiao Langshu Qiongwen Emperor Chapter* above the nine skies, singing wondrous chapters, roaming in delight, stirring the spirits, bringing down the teaching of the three primordials, ascending to the Supreme Truth King. He transmitted it to Taihua Zhenren, the Three Heavens’ Longevity Lords, Taihe Zhenren, Donghua Laozu, the Southern Pole’s Chief Commander, Western Terrace Zhonghou, Northern Emperor Zhongzhen, Nine Spirit Jade Sons, Tai Ling Zhenfei, Red Essence Jade Youth, Xuan Gu Xiansheng, Southern Mountain Red Pine, Zhongshan King Qiao, Ziyang Zhenren, Western City King Jun, Zhonghuang Xiansheng, Zhao Boxuan, Mountain Zhongzong, and others—eighteen persons in all—who cultivated this dao, their faces shining with golden radiance, necks bearing round light, riding the void to ascend the skies, feasting in the purple court, transforming myriad directions, roaming at will, howling commands to establish arrival, summoning myriad spirits, restraining demons, deciding life and death, riding the skies on smoke, entering and exiting the imperial court—all by means of the Qiongwen, to reach the supreme truth.

The King commanded a seal to be conferred in the Western City mountains, inscribed with golden characters named the Emperor’s Token, green letters in purple clarity. Those who are true persons shall receive this text. Those who obtain it hold a treasured secret; do not rashly transmit it. To reveal the spirit chapters invites the seven ancestors’ punishment, eternal blame by ghost officials, long imprisonment in hell, never pardoned through myriad kalpas.

The Nine Heavens’ Nine Kings are the root and origin of myriad qi, ancestors of all emperors, the essence source of the nine qi. When Heaven and Earth had not yet condensed, the three dawns were not yet bright, they formed naturally and were born within the cavern, in the vast depths. After ninety thousand kalpas, the qi divided and each governed, establishing the Nine Heavens. The sun, moon, and stars thus shone; myriad qi flowed and unfolded, forming the true dao. The Primordial Supreme Emperor and the High Most Jade Void were born within the beginning of Heaven, the thirty-nine emperors and twenty-four true ones followed, establishing palaces and offices in order. The Supreme Emperor’s treasured scriptures all formed natural chapters to be practiced. The way of longevity, the method of immortality, talismans and jade formulas all arise from the Nine Heavenly Kings, passed down through generations of the true. At the three-five change of fate, the Nine Spirits respond in due time. The later saint, the Nine Mysteries Dao Lord, examined the original texts, passing through ninety-nine trillion nine thousand kalpas. The Supreme Emperor’s regulations mostly do not correspond. The Dao Lord, on the first day of the ninth month of the first year of the Central Emperor, at the Jade Heaven’s jade chamber and golden gate upper palace, commanded the Eastern Splendor Azure Palace to seek the pattern of rise and fall, to collate ancient texts, revise and compile spirit chapters, gathering three hundred treasured scriptures, entrusting the Upper Minister Azure Youth Lord to transmit to later learners of jade name and true person. Whoever studies and seeks immortality but does not know the origin of the dao, the source of treasured secrets, learns in darkness without ancestors, the true will not descend, the dao will not proceed. Those who desire to seek immortality should seek the root of the Nine Heavens, obtain its fundamental origin, the dao is complete, immortality is fully attained. But the Nine Heavenly Kings’ secret taboos are hidden above the Nine Heavens in the Palace of Great Abundance, not transmitted to the lower world. There is a mysterious name Emperor’s Chart, gold letters of Supreme Clarity. When fate and meeting align, one may know the Nine Heavenly Kings’ names; the kings then dispatch twelve jade youths and nine jade maidens to guard the destined body. Following the regulations, fasting for ninety days or nine days, bearing nine taels of upper gold, ninety feet of purple text, swearing the Nine Heavens’ faith, only then may the master transmit and swear. Do not rashly reveal the supreme spirit; the seven ancestors will punish, long serve as ghost officials, bear stone burdens, perish under the Three Officials, never attain immortality.

The Nine Heavenly Kings within the cavern, before the Primordial, sing profound songs governing fate, roaming and celebrating the sky court, their sounds and phrases subtle and mysterious. From the profound arises the spirit true treasured formula, thus the spirit chapters were written. Those who practice this dao attain rank equal to the Nine Heavens, with subtle thoughts preserving taboo, holding spirit and true thought, spirit auspices announce and respond, naturally ascending the dawn.

Whoever cultivates this dao should on their birth eight festival days bathe and fast, enter the chamber at the proper time, face east and knock teeth thirty-six times, look up to the Nine Heavens above, nine-colored flying clouds and flowing light below, lush chamber hall. Softly call the Nine Heavenly Kings’ taboo names, hold true spirit thoughts, then recite the Tai Xiao Langshu Qiongwen chapters, nine chapters once, to celebrate the sky court, spirits rejoice in the silent chamber, spirit responses in the nine mysteries. Following the method for nine years, one may ride the flying light, feast in the purple dawn.

If descending to roam the Nine Heavens, observing the day of myriad immortals’ profound meetings, like the Supreme Clarity fast, each recites once at the appointed time, then the Nine Heavens record the name, right alongside the Supreme Truth. Nine years without loss, one may attain the supreme immortal.

The emperor chapters all arise from the Nine Heavens’ primordial essence, the Nine Heavens’ emperor kings’ hidden treasured names, talismans and jade formulas fully expressed within. Those who wear this text are true with the Nine Heavens, myriad spirits bow, groups of immortals guard and welcome, commanding and restraining heavenly demons, entering and exiting without fixed place, riding clouds and driving void, roaming and feasting in the great space. This text is subtle and wondrous, the ancestor of myriad emperors. Those who understand this secret become immortal kings. Those who leak and lightly transmit perish in the nine springs, disaster reaches the seven ancestors, the cavern fills the river source, seized through myriad kalpas. Be cautious in practice.

The right jade text emperor chapters number two hundred forty sounds, all the Nine Heavens’ primordial essence, the myriad truths’ hidden names. They should be carved on jujube heart wood, received at the cliff’s clear spring’s tablet, applied on flying net scarves, facing north swearing to the Nine Heavens, receiving the Nine Heavens’ chapters. Disciples hold nine taels of upper gold, ninety feet of purple text, face south and prostrate, the master reads the jade text and then transmits to disciples. If the carved text and seal are not yet obtained, one may also write with orpiment on blue-green upper text, swear and then transmit, then slowly carve the text, ascending the mountain to swear at the Nine Heavens.

If carving the jade text on jujube heart wood, do not hang the seal facing the four directions. Place it in a jade box in a separate chamber, facing upright. Morning and evening burn incense and worship the Nine Heavenly Kings.

To summon the Eastern Peak immortal official, to ask for auspices, the method to communicate spirit and attain truth, on the Jia or Yi day, face east and read the emperor chapters once; then the immortal official immediately arrives, speaking truthfully together. To summon the Southern Peak, on the Bing or Ding day, use the same method; the Southern Peak immortal official arrives, communicating truthfully. To summon the Western Peak, on the Geng or Xin day, use the same method; the Western Peak immortal official arrives, speaking truthfully. To summon the Northern Peak, on the Ren or Gui day, use the same method; the Northern Peak immortal official arrives, communicating truthfully. To summon the Central Peak, on the Wu or Ji day, use the same method; the Central Peak immortal official arrives, speaking truthfully. All five peaks’ summoning methods involve facing the proper direction, knocking teeth thirty-six times, then reading the emperor chapters. With focused heart and fasting, spirits all descend. If the body is sullied and unrefined, not yet penetrating the profound mystery, closing eyes and concentrating deeply, one will see spirits. One will surely investigate the hidden and comprehend the dark, knowing auspices of good and ill. Nine years with the truth in form, exiting emptiness and entering the void, roaming and feasting in the jade dawn.

When the destined one’s cultivation is complete, a true person descends; a cloud chariot and purple canopy come to welcome the destined body. The destined one should imprint the emperor chapter’s seal on the soles of both feet and both hands, to establish feathered wings, moving the destined one to ascend.

If in the five peaks’ secluded quiet places one cultivates and recites, and strange beings impersonate true forms, descending to the destined one’s chamber, one should face the emperor chapter’s seal toward them; then true or false will immediately be revealed. If a true immortal official, the destined one should bow and welcome, presenting requests at will, obtaining essential words. If a demon spirit, it will revert to its original form.

The destined one should knock teeth thirty-six times, read the emperor chapters once; demons immediately vanish and lose form before the destined one. Such a method requires heart and mouth to correspond; do not show it to others. Showing it to others leaks the truth; the dao will not proceed.

At evening rest alone, the destined one should place the emperor chapters upon the heart; then the Tai Xiao true immortal will come to guard. The destined one’s form and shadow respond in dreams, speaking with the truth. Within nine years, one may meet the true person face to face.

Whoever receives the emperor chapter’s seal must not rashly reveal it to others. If three people see it, the dao departs, and the practice fails.

Whoever cultivates this dao must be careful not to tread filth, offend true spirits; if violated, nine years of punishment will afflict the destined one’s body.

If one has the profound chart emperor’s token, green letters in purple script, golden bone and jade marrow, named Writing Azure Palace, the Nine Heavenly Kings will dispatch four-pole true persons to descend and confer the destined one the Qiongwen emperor chapters.

If one has prior affinity and meets a bright master, all profound and outstanding, they should receive this text and attain supreme immortality. They should bring a gold ribbon of faith, visit the master fasting, and receive cultivation. Without faith and oath, Heaven will not open spirit, truth will not descend rank, immortality will not be attained. If the master transmits lightly and leaks, seven ancestors will punish, long serve as ghost officials. Be clear and cautious with profound laws; do not rashly proclaim.

Whoever transmits the *Tai Xiao Langshu Qiongwen Emperor Chapter* should do so among high mountains and empty solitude, placing flying net scarves facing north, incense, cakes, jujube fruits arranged, placed on a separate tray, the scripture laid atop the flying net. The master faces north, knocks teeth thirty-six times, respectfully petitions the Nine Spirits’ Primordial True Profound Beginning Supreme Officials, golden immortals, jade maidens, Taiyi spirit gods, supervising true officials, five emperors myriad truths: “Now there is a certain mountain master of a certain Jia, purple net forming the womb, destined to rise immortal, bearing gold ribbon of faith, seeking to receive the spirit text, Nine Heavens’ true taboo Qiongwen emperor chapters, heavenly laws to be cautious, sworn treasured spirit truth. May the circuitous divine light and profound reflection descend upon this servant. If there is a day of leakage, return the body to the river source, seven ancestors repent, dare not again be immortal.” Finished, holding the scripture in hand, delivered to disciples. Then bury cakes and fruits within the mysterious mountain, not for other use. This is the Nine Heavenly Kings’ secret mystery, the Supreme Truth’s wondrous secret. Cultivators without this heavenly law labor in vain in empty mountains, without response in the silent courtyard. Diligently and earnestly ponder the Nine Mysteries; the heavenly kings will be pleased, dispatch jade youths and jade maidens to guard the destined body. Within nine years, one may ride the flying jade, ascending the Nine Heavens.
