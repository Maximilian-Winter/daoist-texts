### Scripture of the Numinous Writings in Purple Script of the Sovereign of the Golden Pavilion of Supreme Clarity of the August Heaven

Received by the Supreme Perfected Immortal Commander of the Five Elders, bestowed by the Sacred Sovereign’s mandate upon the Azure Youth Lord, who in turn transmitted it to Wang Yuanyou, instructing him to teach those with immortal registers under the mysterious name of Bone and Appearance.

In the Eastern Palace of the Eastern Sea, the Azure Youth Great Lord fasted purely within the Yellow Chamber of the Numinous Pavilion and the Elixir Pavilion for three years. At that time, he rode the chariot of the Three Spirits of the Blue Mist, a flowing cloud vehicle, adorned with a flying cloak of azure-green feathers like a dragon’s mantle. From the Mulberry Grove of a thousand true beings, he ascended to the Golden Pavilion of Supreme Clarity to petition to receive the Scripture of the Numinous Writings in Purple Script.

Within the Golden Pavilion dwelt four imperial lords; behind them, the Sacred Sovereign sat to their left, residing in the Palace of Jade Terraces and Elixir Coral in the Supreme Void. Thirty thousand attendant maidens of true essence served there. Fierce beasts of poisonous dragons, thunderous tigers, and celestial jackals guarded the gates and embraced the passes. Serpents a thousand fathoms long patrolled the walls and fissures. Flying horses, rushing sparrows, and great-winged crows pecked and clawed, arrayed in the vast courtyard. The majesty of Heaven blazed brilliantly, radiating eightfold light. The wind stirred mysterious banners, swirling and dancing beneath fluttering canopies. Jade trees sounded with stirring music, and precious grasses whispered melodies. A chorus of cloud flutes sang, phoenixes called from blue terraces, divine consorts harmonized in song, roc birds soared and phoenixes marched.

When the Azure Youth arrived, he prostrated himself and faced north, holding his head in his hands, saying: “Your humble servant Fan Mei dares to present words before the Sacred Emperor, the Bright Sovereign. In ancient times, I governed the vast void, presided over the flight of true beings, observed the broad expanse of the Five Spirits, and directed the secret visions of the mysterious masters. I soared and bathed in the pure yang, sounded the bells of the white pavilion, and illuminated the three views. In serene contemplation, I beheld the wondrous awakening, the spacious spiritual garden, the cleansing blue valley. Thus I wandered the long gauze, strode with the mysterious elders, joined the nine phoenixes at the ruined threshold, released flowing light above the dark brilliance, traversed the twin mysteries, exhausted the marks of spiritual vision, and rested quietly in the dragon’s void. I concealed the faintest trace within the elixir chamber, opened the divine gate and entrusted transformation, following form and shifting to scatter burdens.”

“At that time, bonds were loosened and crossed, spirit and breath were faint and peaceful, the five spirits were tranquil, flowing like a polished void. Scales leapt at the blue ford, generous and unrestrained. Though self-sufficient in the eight views, truly there was no boundary in the shining heavens. Yet I considered the true talent not yet awakened, the spiritual jade unpolished and dormant. I wished to let the wind scatter the orchid forest, sound the music at the cloud’s edge, awaken the seven clear breaths, and cleave the condensed to reveal the hidden. But I do not know if the Scripture of the Numinous Writings in Purple Script can be granted for teaching below.”

At that moment, the Later Sacred Sovereign was weaving transformations beyond form, brushing distant imaginings, and inscribing the Great Cavernous Mysterious Scripture, instructing hundreds of Supreme Perfected Left Ministers and Numinous Youth Jade Maidens. He neither heard the Azure Youth’s words nor paused to recite or observe.

Then the Azure Youth Lord again opened his mouth, knelt forward, and earnestly petitioned without ceasing. After a long pause, the Sacred Sovereign sighed deeply: “Your words are bitter yet profound; with utmost sincerity you come to enlightenment. You have truly cast aside your heart.”

He then pointed to the empty realm with a look of compassion. He drew forth the zither of Cloud Sovereignty, plucked and played it. The clear, numinous tones sparkled, stirring a hundred harmonies. The jade strings vibrated through the nine voids, piercing the bright supreme heavens, and sang the chapter of the Great Cavernous Divine Land, the soul-condensing melody, the mysterious poem and spiritual ornament, the rare celestial rhythm. It illuminated the middle breath, with frequent clear notes. The words were:

> Mysterious Void, Supreme Clarity Qi,  
> Three Primitives soaring in splendid haze.  
> Abyss opens the spiritual gate,  
> Seven portals fan the feathered youth.  
> Vast and bright the Elixir Heaven’s view,  
> Clear and serene, dark motions manifest.  
> Awakening to the mysterious assembly,  
> Resting at the edge, flying in the supreme void.  
> Intestine terrace, great cavernous wilds,  
> Quiet and remote, radiant herb light.  
> Leaving the boundary, veiling the empty wheel,  
> Severed dwelling, self-communing in darkness.  
> High assembly at the mysterious star pavilion,  
> Cold heads bow to the Jade Emperor.  
> Divine reflections of vermilion spirit sounds,  
> Hollow drums resound with jade bells.  
> Nine reins loosen the cloud chariot,  
> Carefree on the purple mist peak.  
> Elixir mound opens the blue chamber,  
> Green courtyard unfolds five rooms.  
> Golden pavilion gleams towering,  
> Verdant wood covers the Supreme Clarity Palace.  
> Savoring the brilliance of sun and moon,  
> Gazing upon the formless directions.  
> Mysterious essence awakens three spirits,  
> Desolate in the kalpa’s height.  
> Why sit in the crossroads,  
> Bearing five hardships in the child’s heart?  
> Why not ride the red infant,  
> Mount my mud pellet lord?  
> Neither death nor birth,  
> Neither beginning nor end.

When the Sacred Sovereign finished chanting, he gestured for the Azure Youth to sit. He arranged flowing mist wine, surrounded by firm fruits, red trees with white seeds, crimson wood with blue fruit. Then he commanded the Supreme Perfected Immortal Commander of the Five Elders on the left to open the purple bud jade chest embroidered with cloud brocade, and take out the Scripture of the Numinous Writings in Purple Script. He entrusted it to the Azure Youth Lord, who was to bestow it upon those with jade names in the mysterious palace, those destined to become true beings. The Azure Youth retired from the hall, kowtowed, and received it, returning to the Eastern Palace.

The *Scripture of the Numinous Writings in Purple Script* was the essential text received by the Later Sacred Lord Li Jun from his youth in the Way. It was the oral transmission of the secrets from the Taiwei Heavenly Emperor and the Purple Tenuity Supreme Perfected Heavenly Emperor, the Jade Clarity Lord—two heavenly emperors—containing the true methods. The highest imperial grand principles and essential matters were all carefully compiled, arranged, and implemented with blessings and incantations, ordered sequentially into one scroll, engraved on purple jade slips with azure-gold script.

The Turtle Mother held the brush, the True Youth brushed the mat, the Heavenly Consorts tended incense, the Jade Youth bound the scrolls, naming it *Scripture of the Numinous Writings in Purple Script*. It was entrusted to the Supreme Perfected Immortal Commander of the Five Elders on the left, stored in the Purple Bud Jade Chest, wrapped in cloud brocade pouches. Ten jade maidens were appointed to attend the text on either side; ten jade youths were appointed to record the sacred sovereign’s chronicles and to inspect the Daoists who possessed the scripture, to speak of merits and correct faults, reporting to the Supreme Clarity Mysterious Former Masters.

Great offenses were examined by the Three Officials; minor offenses lost records and shortened years; grave offenses brought calamity to the Three Ancestors; light offenses harmed only the body; disrespect caused the spirit to depart; impurity caused the text to be hidden. Those who study immortality and open the sacred text must rise and bow, wash hands, and burn incense. The Heavenly Spirits inspect and judge—how can one not be cautious and reverent? Those not granted transmission must not recklessly speak of chapters; to do so is to violate the laws of revealing heavenly mysteries.

The Supreme Clarity Golden Pavilion Scripture of the Numinous Writings in Purple Script adopts the method of gathering and drinking the flying root and swallowing the sun’s qi. It was once received from the Taiwei Heavenly Emperor, also called the Scripture of the Red Elixir, Golden Essence, Stone Reflection, and Water Mother.

One should always see the sun at its first rising, face east toward the sun, knock the teeth nine times completely, and in the heart recite the yin incantation, calling the sun’s soul by name. The five emperors’ characters in the sun are:

Sun Soul, Vermilion Radiance, Illuminating Sheath, Green Reflection, Returning Glow, Red Youth, Mysterious Flame, Whirlwind Image.

After mentally reciting these sixteen characters, one closes the eyes, grasps firmly, and envisions the five-colored flowing clouds of the sun descending to embrace the whole body, reaching down to the feet. Then one envisions the five colors rising to the crown. The sun’s light and flowing clouds of five colors all enter the mouth. Within the sun’s flowing clouds and light, there is again purple qi, as large as the pupil, layered tens of times, dazzling within the five lights—this is called the Flying Root Water Mother. Together with the five qi, they enter the mouth, swallowing the sun’s clouds, performing forty-five breaths of swallowing. After swallowing the breaths, one swallows the liquid nine times. Then one knocks the teeth nine times completely and softly chants:

Red Hut Elixir Qi,  
Circle of Heaven nurturing essence,  
Firm receiving softness,  
Flaming fire, yin spirit,  
Sun and star primordial radiance,  
Called Great Brightness,  
Nine yang harmonize transformation,  
Two smokes arise together,  
Condensing soul and harmonizing spirit,  
Essence of five qi,  
Born among the five emperors,  
Riding light, governing form,  
Gathering flight to the void,  
Ceasing roots to gain fullness,  
Head wrapped in dragon flowers,  
Draped in vermilion and blue,  
Reins black flowing mysterious,  
Clouds reflect Supreme Clarity,  
Granting jade slips of scripture,  
Engraved names in golden pavilion,  
Eating and drinking morning brilliance,  
United with the true spirit,  
Flying immortals of Taiwei,  
Ascending the Purple Court.

Finished, one bows twice toward the sun. Among the true immortals, numbering over ten thousand, none know the name of the sun’s soul. This Dao is mysterious and subtle; it cannot be heard by those of blood and flesh, foul and decayed. When the sky is overcast and the sun is absent, one may perform this in a clean place indoors where one sleeps. Pure cultivators who are skilled in supreme response may practice without seeing the sun. If Daoists rest in mountains and forests, fast on the Five Sacred Mountains, sever dust from the human world, and deeply contemplate purity and truth, they may daily drink the sun’s root clouds and swallow the sun’s essence, instantly sensing their body born with jade luster, their face shining with flowing light.

If worldly affairs still burden them and they have not yet attained stillness of form, wandering the mundane path with hearts bound to fame and gain, they should perform this on the first, third, fifth, seventh, ninth, thirteenth, fifteenth, seventeenth, nineteenth, and twenty-fifth days of the moon, following the above method ten times in a month. On these days, the sun’s soul descends to receive, the flying root fills, and the water mother dispels dreams. After eighteen years of practice, Supreme Clarity will refine the golden truth, shining with jade light, attaining the rank of Jade Emperor, flying through the supreme void, riding the three pure flowers, illuminating all under Heaven.

### Taiwei Method of Drinking the Sun’s Qi and Opening the Bright Spirit Talisman

If one cannot regularly write talismans on the half-night of the lunar dark day, one must not miss the odd lunar dark days.

On the right, on the half-night of the lunar dark day, write in vermilion on blue paper, face east and swallow it, first to notify the sun’s soul. When taking the talisman, hold breath, grasp the talisman with the left hand, and mentally recite:

Taiwei Elixir Measure Pavilion,  
Named Opening Brightness,  
Summoning the sun’s upper soul,  
To transform a certain form,  
At dawn, strictly prepared,  
Issuing from the round courtyard,  
Flying flower water mother,  
Sun root golden essence,  
Purple reflecting flowing light,  
Called the Five Spirits.

After the blessing, swallow the talisman.

### Supreme Clarity Golden Pavilion Scripture of the Numinous Writings in Purple Script, Method of Gathering and Drinking Yin Splendor, Swallowing the Moon’s Essence

Once received from the Taiwei Heavenly Emperor, also called the Scripture of Yellow Qi, Yang Essence, Hidden Heaven, and Moon.

One should see the moon at its first rising, face west toward the moon, knock the teeth ten times completely, then mentally recite the yin blessing, calling the moon’s soul by name. The five ladies’ characters in the moon are:

Moon Soul, Warmth, Fragrance, Splendor, Shade, Lofty, Graceful, Void, Spirit, Orchid, Fragrant, Bloom, Knot, Proud, Pure Gold, Clear, Bright, Gen, Appearance, Platform, Mark.

After mentally reciting these twenty-four characters, one closes the eyes, grasps firmly, and envisions the five-colored flowing essence of the moon descending to embrace the whole body, reaching down to the feet. Then one envisions the five qi rising to the crown. The moon’s light and flowing essence of five colors all enter the mouth. Within the moon’s flowing essence and light, there is again yellow qi, as large as the pupil, layered tens of times, accompanying the moon’s essence and five-colored light—this is called the Flying Yellow Moon Splendor Essence. Together with the five qi, they enter the mouth, swallowing the moon’s essence, performing fifty breaths of swallowing. After swallowing the breaths, one swallows the liquid ten times. Then one knocks the teeth ten times completely and softly blesses:

Yellow Sentiment, Mysterious Radiance,  
Primordial Yin Upper Qi,  
Scattering vast cold winds,  
Directing spirit to gather the stomach,  
Empty waves, bright and clear,  
Rising and cleansing pure vessel,  
Moon essence, night scene,  
Mysterious palace exalted noble,  
Five lords and ladies,  
Each guarding their motherly place,  
Red infants flying in,  
Babies continuing on,  
Returning yin in three unions,  
Light mysterious in myriad directions,  
Harmonizing soul and governing spirit,  
Five wombs flowing and circulating,  
Riding clouds flying essence,  
Escaping void to the east,  
First binding spiritual clouds,  
Radiant splendor beckoning wind,  
Left bearing dragon talisman,  
Right wearing tiger badge,  
Phoenix feathers vermilion cloak,  
Jade pendants golden earrings,  
Soaring trees knotting Ah,  
Called the Wood King,  
Spirit base controlling root,  
With deficiency and fullness,  
Bright essence shining within,  
Mysterious waters spitting beams,  
Granting jade talisman,  
Engraved name in cloud chamber,  
Eating and drinking moon splendor,  
United with the true spirit,  
Flying immortals of Purple Tenuity,  
Attending the Supreme Sovereign.

After the blessing, bow twice toward the moon. One may sit or stand as convenient. Among the celestial officials, none know the name of the moon’s soul. Those true beings who know it at the time may perform it indoors when the sky is overcast and the moon is absent. The essential method is the same as drinking the sun’s light. Doing so every evening, one instantly senses the body born with shining light, the eyes filled with flying essence.

The key days are the second, fourth, sixth, eighth, tenth, fourteenth, sixteenth, eighteenth, twentieth, twenty-second, and twenty-fourth days of the moon—eleven times in a month—enough to become an immortal. On these evenings, yin and yang unite, the three breaths overflow, moon water forms splendor, and the Yellow Spirit descends to receive. After eighteen years of practice, Supreme Clarity will refine the soul and transform the spirit, shining with jade light, riding mysterious reins of radiance, flying through the supreme void.

### Purple Tenuity Method of Drinking the Moon’s Essence, Supreme Mysterious Yin Birth Talisman

If one cannot regularly write talismans on the half-night of the lunar dark day, one must not miss the even lunar dark days. Odd months are the first, even months the second.

On the right, on the half-night of the lunar dark day, write in yellow on blue paper, face east and swallow it, first notifying the moon’s soul. At this time, one should first drink the Opening Bright Spirit Talisman. When drinking the moon talisman, hold breath, grasp the talisman with the right hand, and mentally recite:

Purple Tenuity Yellow Script,  
Named Supreme Mystery,  
Summoning moon splendor water,  
Nourishing spirit and harmonizing soul,  
Strict matters in the center,  
Issuing from the mysterious gate,  
Hidden heaven moon,  
Five spirit ladies,  
Flying light through nine paths,  
Illuminating the bright mud pellet.

After the blessing, swallow the talisman.

### Taiwei Scripture of the Numinous Writings in Purple Script, Method of Binding the Three Souls

On the evenings of the third, thirteenth, and twenty-third days of the moon, the one or two souls are unsettled, the clear spirits float and wander, the fetal light spreads form, the hidden essence disturbs and calls. These Clear Spirit, Fetal Light, Hidden Essence are the three lords, the three soul gods. On these evenings, all abandon the body to roam, speeding away from the original chamber, sometimes seen and restrained by other souls or ghosts, sometimes caught by malevolent beings, sometimes unable to return, separating form and releasing substance, sometimes violating other souls. The two breaths fight, all agitated and competing, causing the infant to be distracted by other thoughts, coming and going without form, hearts sorrowful and minds troubled.

Daoists should bind and restrain them, preventing wandering. The method of binding is to lie down facing upward, pillow removed, legs extended, hands crossed palm up, eyes closed, breath held for three breaths, knock teeth three times completely, and hold in the mind a red qi like a chicken’s egg. From inside, it rises upward through the eyes, exits from the eyes, the red qi expands, covering the body, flowing down the body and up to the crown, transforming into fire, circling the body until it surrounds the whole body, making inside and outside clear and bright like burning charcoal.

When finished, one should feel a slight warmth in the body. Then knock teeth three times completely again. Then call the three souls by name: Clear Spirit, Fetal Light, Hidden Essence. The three gods quickly stop. Then softly bless:

Taiwei Mysterious Official,  
Center Yellow, beginning Blue,  
Inner refining three souls,  
Fetal Light at peace,  
Divine treasure jade chamber,  
Born with me,  
No reckless movement,  
Observer is most numinous,  
If wishing to fly,  
Only permitted to visit Supreme Ultimate Supreme Clarity,  
If hungry or thirsty,  
Only permitted to drink the returning water jade essence.

### Taiwei Scripture of the Numinous Writings in Purple Script, Method of Controlling the Seven Po

On the new moon, full moon, and lunar dark evenings, the seven po souls wander, roaming in filth and impurity, sometimes mingling with blood and flesh, visiting ghosts and malevolent spirits, sometimes associating with corpses, sometimes seducing infants, gathering evil and attacking homes. Sometimes they accuse human sins before the Three Officials and the River Lord, sometimes transform into monsters causing disgust and harm, sometimes bring ghosts into the body, calling forth evil and killing substance.

All lingering diseases in living people arise from the po’s sins; delight in death is the po’s nature; desire for ruin is the po’s illness. Daoists must control and urge them, refine and transform them, govern and correct them, restrain and awe them.

The first po is named Corpse Dog,  
The second po named Hidden Arrow,  
The third po named Sparrow Shade,  
The fourth po named Swallow Thief,  
The fifth po named Non-Poison,  
The sixth po named Remove Filth,  
The seventh po named Stinking Lung.

These are the seven po’s yin names, the turbid ghosts within the body.

The method of control and inspection is to lie correctly, remove the pillow, extend the legs, cover both ears with palms, fingers touching at the nape, hold breath seven times, knock teeth seven times completely, hold in the nose a white qi like a small bean, gradually growing to cover the body nine layers, reaching down to the feet and up to the crown.

When finished, the white qi suddenly transforms into heavenly beasts: two blue dragons in the eyes, two white tigers in the nostrils, all facing outward; a vermilion bird on the heart facing the mouth; a blue turtle under the left foot; a spiritual snake under the right foot; in both ears jade maidens dressed in mysterious brocade stand at the ear gates, each holding firelight in their hands.

After a while, all is complete. Then swallow liquid seven times, knock teeth seven times completely, call the seven po by name, then softly bless:

Pure qi nine turns,  
Control po’s evil and fierce,  
Heavenly beasts guard the gates,  
Delicate maidens hold the passes,  
Refine po and harmonize softness,  
With me in peace,  
No reckless movement,  
Observe the source of form,  
If you are hungry or thirsty,  
Listen to drink moon yellow sun elixir.

After the blessing and recitation, the seven po are closed within, restrained and controlled. If practiced regularly, the turbid po dissolve downward, returning to goodness and harmonizing with form, ascending to the three palaces, uniting with the primordial spirit.

---

A person’s body contains three primal palace spirits: the Life Gate has the Mysterious Gate Great Lord, and the three soul gods, combined with the seven gods, all residing within the form, wishing to grant long life, benevolent and greatly auspicious lords. The seven po are also born within the body but act as enemies attacking it, so they must be controlled.

Daoists only know the method of seeking immortality but do not know the method of controlling the po, thus cannot avoid futile effort.

The three primal palaces are located as follows: the Upper Primal Palace is in the mud pellet (head); its god is the Red Infant, named Three Primal Ancestor, also called Imperial Minister; the Middle Primal Palace is in the center of the scarlet chamber; its god is the True Man, named Southern Child Elixir, also called Middle Light Firm; the Lower Primal Elixir Palace is three cun below the navel; its god is the Infant, named Primal Yang Prosperity, also called Mysterious Valley Below. These three are the one god.

When wishing to bind and control the soul and po, first call their names in the yin, envisioning all three gods as jade-colored golden light, with infantile appearances; the upper two primal gods wear red, the lower primal god wears yellow, heads like newborn infants. When practicing Dao and breathing, one also calls their names.

The Life Gate is the navel; the Mysterious Gate is the passage of the original birth intestines. Inside is the Life Palace, where the Great Lord named Tao Kang, styled He Yan, dressed in vermilion robes and wearing a purple lotus crown, sits at the Life Gate, accompanied by the three soul gods.

The Great Lord always holds the Heavenly Emperor’s image talisman, harmonizing and directing the primordial qi, supplementing the fetus and restoring the womb. At night, before sleep, one first holds breath for twenty-four breaths, then mentally blesses the Great Lord’s name three times, then swallows liquid fifty times, knocks teeth three times, and softly blesses:

Fetal Spirit Great God,  
Imperial Thread Heavenly Lord,  
Holding the womb talisman,  
Head crowned with purple crown,  
Yellow returns, red turns,  
Above refining Life Gate,  
Transforming spirit, reversing birth,  
Six harmonies mutually cause,  
Form and body shining bright,  
Jade maiden dwelling within.

When finished, if practiced regularly for eighteen years, the Great Lord will be able to excite the three fields on the left, govern the three qi on the right, transforming the fields into flying ascent, the qi into mysterious dragons, commanding the twenty-four gods above, controlling the souls below, calling the six yang officials, summoning the six yin officials, a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders ascending in broad daylight—all the effect of the Great Lord Tao.

### Taiwei Heavenly Emperor’s Image Talisman

Also called the Emperor Lord Nine Circuits, Five Passages, Eight Intervals Talisman. When performing rites and blessings in a separate chamber, one must first write this talisman, place it in a brocade pouch, wear it, and only then may one proceed.

The Heavenly Emperor Image Talisman is entrusted to the Life Palace Great Lord Tao Kang He Yan, harmonizing the primordial upper qi, regulating the womb, and guiding essence movement. Written in vermilion on blue paper, taken on the first or fifteenth night of the moon, facing north, held with the left hand, breath held, mentally blessing:

Heavenly Emperor Mysterious Scripture,  
Imperial Image Numinous Talisman,  
To harmonize primordial qi,  
Move essence and reverse womb,  
Ten thousand years infant,  
Flying immortal at celestial pivot,  
Life Palace Great Lord,  
Draped in red, built in vermilion,  
Head wearing purple lotus,  
Conspiring with me.

After blessing, take it. After taking, rise and bow twice. The talisman is taken in the sleeping posture.

If a Daoist has the method of returning essence, turning yellow to red, directing essence to nourish life, moistening fluids, causing male and female to coalesce the elixir, and the face to grow jade luster, then one should know the importance of the Great Lord’s name and wear the image talisman to avoid aging. If one only practices without knowing the divine name, returning essence without wearing this talisman, not hearing its blessing, not understanding the palace and residence, even if granted a thousand years of life, one will still return to the corpse under the Great Yin, merely accumulating years of life, thus must return the bones to the Three Officials.

Daoists, before sleep, always keep the Great Lord in mind, blessing accordingly, taking the talisman on the new and full moon nights to circulate and benefit the fetal essence. In this way, one may become an immortal without the complicated arts of male and female returning and supplementing. Yet to govern the woman to ascend and to turn qi to seek heavenly immortals is more perilous than water and fire, swifter in killing than axe and cleaver. Unless one is of resolute heart embracing unity, one is likely to lose what one seeks. Those of middling skill may practice it, but it is like swallowing a sword yet wishing to swallow it unharmed—can it really be attained?

The Life Palace Great God Lord forbids eating raw blood, burning hair of six domestic animals, burning skins and leaves of gourds and garlic, and all kinds of meat dishes. These all disrupt fetal qi, foul and harm the infant spirit. Beware!
