### The Secret Words of the Eight Dao Paths of Shangqing

**First Path Secret Words:**  
On the day of the first month’s jiǎ and yǐ days at the Beginning of Spring, at dawn, facing north, if one sees clouds of purple, green, and white, these are the Three Primordial Lords of the Most High, riding upon three pure flying clouds. At that time, the Three Primordials mount the wheels of the Eight Chariots and ascend to the Heavenly Emperor, Great August Sovereign. When you see these three-colored clouds, hold in your heart the reverent act of kowtowing and striking your chest; with a mind of fourfold prostrations, humbly present yourself and petition: “I, your great-grandchild so-and-so, from youth have cherished the dao and virtue, cultivated the Nine Truths, bathed in the Five Spirits, and have been recorded by the Heavenly Emperor and Sovereign. Today, by fortune, I encounter the Three Primordials on their journey; I beseech to serve at the wheel hubs and to have my wishes granted at will.” When you see the Three Primordials’ carriage, you shall ascend to immortality by day. You must prostrate yourself and hold this thought, for a thousand and a hundred deeds are thus accomplished. The prayers and bows for the Eight Paths are likewise so; these are called the Secret Words of the Eight Paths. Those not recorded among the immortals may not hear them.

The attire: azure crown, pale green cape, robe of red rising flames, red banner, five-colored clouds; the attendant boys wear appropriate garments.

**Second Path Secret Words:**  
On the day of the Spring Equinox, and on the yín and mǎo days, at midnight facing northeast, if one sees clouds of dark blue, green, and yellow, these are the Three Pure Clouds of the Heavenly Emperor of Taiwei. At that moment, the Heavenly Emperor of Taiwei rides the chariot of Eight Scenes and ascends to the High Jade Emperor. Those who see this hold a heart of bowing and kneeling, as above. When one sees the Emperor’s carriage four times, by day there will be a dragon canopy and feathered parasol coming to greet and escort you to ascend to Heaven.

The attire: blue crown, red robe, blue edging, five-colored clouds; the outer garments are suitably chosen.

**Third Path Secret Words:**  
On the day of the Beginning of Summer, and on the jiǎzǐ days in the early ten days of the month, specifically wùchén and jǐsì days, at dawn facing northwest, if one sees clouds of purple, blue, and yellow, these are the Three Pure Clouds of the Supreme True Lord of Taiji, the Three Primordial Real Person of the Inner Palace. At that time, the Supreme True Lord of Taiji, the Three Primordial Real Person, rides the dark green chariot of mysterious radiance and ascends to the Purple Tenuity Palace. The heart’s prayer is as above. If one sees the Taiji green chariot five times, one will ascend to Heaven by day.

The attire: blue-green crown, pale green cloud-patterned cape, crane-feather mantle, red banner; outer garments suitably chosen.

**Fourth Path Secret Words:**  
On the day of the Summer Solstice, and on the jiǎxū days in the early ten days, specifically wùyín and jǐmǎo days, at dawn facing southeast, if one sees clouds of red, white, and blue, these are the Three Pure Clouds of the Great Emperor of Fusang. At that time, the Great Emperor of Fusang rides the chariot of radiant light of the Eight Paths and ascends to the Taiwei Palace. When seen, the heart prays and bows as above. If one sees it four times, by day there will be clouds and dragons to welcome and escort one in ascent to Heaven.

**Fifth Path Secret Words:**  
On the day of the Beginning of Autumn, and on the jiǎshēn days in the early ten days, specifically wùzǐ and jǐchǒu days, at dawn facing due west, if one sees clouds of white, red, and purple, these are the Three Pure Clouds of the Supreme True Heavenly Emperor, the White Emperor Lord of Taisu. At that time, the Supreme True White Emperor Lord rides the jade carriage of the repaired rainbow and ascends to the Three Heavens of the Mysterious Emperor, the High True. You shall pray and bow as above. If one encounters it five times, one will ascend to immortality by day.

**Sixth Path Secret Words:**

He rides the vermilion and lapis lazuli carriage and ascends to the Langfeng Terrace to pay respects to the Lady of the Nine Spirits. Upon seeing this, one should pray and bow as above. If encountered, one will ascend to immortality by day.

The attire: crown inset with gold, crimson robe, blue edging, five-colored clouds; outer garments suitably chosen, as below.

**Seventh Path Secret Words:**  
On the day of the Beginning of Winter, and on the jiǎchén days in the early ten days, specifically wùshēn and jǐyǒu days, at dawn facing southwest, if one sees clouds of green, purple, and blue, these are the Three Pure Clouds of the Most High Real Person Emperor Lord, the Ancestral Sovereign of Shangqing. At that time, the Most High Real Person Emperor Lord, the Ancestral Sovereign, rides the dark green chariot of mysterious radiance with eightfold light and the cinnabar carriage, ascending to the High Nine Heavens Jade Emperor. The heart reverently prays and bows as above. If one sees it four times, then the Purple Morning Great Unity Lord rides a phoenix-patterned feathered canopy to welcome you, and you ascend to Heaven by day.

**Eighth Path Secret Words:**  
On the day of the Winter Solstice, and on the jiǎyín days in the early ten days, specifically wùwǔ and jǐwèi days, at dawn facing due east, if one sees clouds of vermilion, jade, and yellow, these are the Three Pure Clouds of the Supreme True Real Person, the Jade Consort of Taixiao and the Great Void. At that time, the Jade Consort of Taixiao and the Great Void rides the wandering jade carriage and ascends to the Taihuang Palace to summon the Heavenly Emperor of Taiwei. When you see these cloud colors, you shall bow, pray, and petition as above. If encountered thrice, the Jade Emperor commands the Yellow Fate Official to descend riding a dragon in a jade chariot to greet you, and you ascend to the morning by day.

Thus conclude the Secret Words of the Eight Dao Paths. Upon seeing them, hold in your heart the acts of kowtowing, striking your cheeks four times, and bowing fourfold, then humbly present yourself as above. You must first bathe and burn incense, await the appointed time, then at the precise moment gaze outward for the space of one meal’s time, then return indoors. The three pure clouds each have their own color; the colored vapors interlace above and below, accumulating in the order of the prayers. For example, on the Beginning of Spring, when seeing the Three Light Three Pure Clouds, the purple cloud is above, the green cloud next, and the white cloud below, all interwoven. You must observe carefully. The “early ten days” means within the first ten days of the month after the jiǎzǐ day has entered. If it is not the appointed day or time but you see these clouds, you should still bow and see them with reverence and faith, and then on the appointed day you will surely see them. Those who practice the Nine Truths and oversee the Eight Paths are guarded by heavenly beings who protect their bodies; the True Emperor guards their life bones. Those not named in the immortal jade registers may not be shown this scripture; even if they seek it, they will never see it. Those who walk this path must not allow others to tread upon their shoes or lower their headscarves and rough garments. Shoes and sandals must always be kept bright and clean; garments of rough cloth must always be kept pure and spotless. This path has many prohibitions: it is said that the seven souls and remaining breaths of a person transform into dragons and tigers, guarding the earthly gates and lying beneath the shoes; the three souls and remaining spirits transform into clouds of the Five Spirits, reflecting upon one’s headscarf. If violated, the heart trembles and the mind becomes arrogant; suddenly one loses oneself, causing spirit depletion, soul scattering, and the essence light to become dim and obstructed. One must always be vigilant. Under the shoes, there must be no soil, nor the foul breath of filth or dung. Inside and outside the clothing boxes, no dirt or filth must be allowed, for the stench is forbidden. Attending scribes include seventeen High Jade Boys and Jade Girls. They say those who possess this scripture establish merit and amend faults, thereby warding off evil and misfortune.

Gentlemen who view the scripture should enter a quiet chamber deeply, burning incense on both sides. When transmitting it, one must face each other in fasting and quietude, sincerely in heart, so that ghosts and spirits discern the truth and unify their will. The Spiritual Treasure concerns the affairs of the Nine Truths and the names of twenty-four spirits. To keep them in mind and recite the prayers is to speak directly the supreme intent. Therefore, it is important to receive it first in fasting, pledging secrecy under the test of leakage. Two people fast facing each other for twenty-four days, and also fast one day before and after. After the scripture is issued and given to disciples, the disciples copy it, then cut their hair and bind it, presenting it to the master as proof of sincerity. They then bind it with nine lengths of white silk as a solemn pledge, replacing the drinking of wine oaths. The use of white silk symbolizes the Taisu energy; nine lengths symbolize the number of the Nine Truths. After receiving the scripture, one must not divulge or flaunt virtue, nor slander the orthodox, nor speak much or act wrongly, lest one defile the Dao and the True. Those who honor and cultivate this scripture shall ascend to the morning by day.

The seventeen High Jade Boys attending on the right declare: those who possess this scripture establish merit and amend faults, thereby warding off evil and misfortune.
