### White Feather Black Wing Numinous Flying Jade Talisman

The Primordial Parents of the Nine Heavens, the Venerable Patriarch of Great Truth, together feasted aboard the Jinglong chariot. From the mulberry groves came myriad perfected beings, tens of thousands riding forth—flying immortals and mighty dragons, steering wheels of lightning, swift as smoke. Their bodies moved with perfect ease, mouths chanting numinous verses, wandering the mysterious grotto of the Profound Hill, resting by the clear waves’ edge, roaming the pavilion of the Purple Void, pausing at the boundless brink.

At that time, the Heavenly Origin shone brilliantly; five dawns returned their radiance; three pure clouds streamed; purple smoke exhaled fragrance; flying incense circled the sun; scents diffused through the Great Nothingness; splendid light intermingled and blazed; three candles merged in brightness; the true essence was sealed on high; chewing on the sun’s root, dining on the mysterious influx of emptiness, revealing the shining golden script, howling through the nine subtle realms, the spirit flowed freely like the cut of a fine blade—jade indeed.

The pavilion—wonderful thoughts stirred in the Great Silence; inner contemplation awakened by Nature itself. On the first year of the Bright Supreme Emperor, third month, third day, at the dawn of the Primordial Beginning, suddenly the mysterious spirit descended in the chariot of the White Luan, the black-winged phoenix’s mouth holding a pure edict. The Flying Feather Scripture ascended the sky, stepping the void with true secret methods; jade essence guided the flying immortals through smoke; host gods guarded the spirit; a solemn presence above the Nine Heavens, radiant in the jade void’s court, came down to the Great Truth, mysteriously bestowing the precious scripture.

That day, the Venerable Patriarch of Great Truth had just completed his fast in Supreme Clarity. The Supreme Emperor, the Three Pure Primal Lords of the Purple Tenuity, the Heavenly Emperor, the Supreme Heavenly Emperor of the Great Tenuity, and the Exalted Jade Emperor’s guests all descended together and sat. They burned the incense of a hundred harmonies, set five-colored divine officials floating in jade seats, arrayed the ranks in the Purple Palace, all perfected beings reverently observed the scripture, circled thrice. The Three Pure Primal Lords rose, facing west, uttered a profound clear sound, recited the Celebration of the True Feather Chapter, praising the divine scripture. Their words said:

> Gentle mist in the Great Void pavilion,  
> Spirit winds scatter wondrous fragrance.  
> Rustling, the mysterious light rises,  
> Subtle breezes wing the sun’s path.  
> Pure luan swiftly flying phoenix,  
> Mouth holds the divine feather edict.  
> Fluttering, soaring through the nine heavens,  
> Mournful cries summon the mysterious beam.  
> Marvelous secret rides the empty sky,  
> Pure governance of the endless dao.  
> All perfected beings universally acclaim,  
> Bowing heads, honoring the Jade Emperor.

When the recitation ended, the Heavenly Emperor rose and faced north, reciting:

> Mysterious phoenix swift with cloud wings,  
> White startled, joyous and hesitant.  
> Flying incense blends with fragrant blossoms,  
> Flowing light dazzles the clouded thoroughfare.  
> Mighty dragons hold long reins,  
> Flying immortals mutually support.  
> Ten thousand perfected beings celebrate auspiciousness,  
> Joyful phoenix roams the void.  
> Primordial Origin has no trace,  
> Mysterious inspiration seeks itself.  
> Flapping wings need no chariot,  
> Floating lightly riding smoke.  
> Precious edict encompasses mysterious principles,  
> Five bodies govern spirit talismans.  
> Praise and honor the blessed court,  
> Circling incense thrice each.

When this ended, the Heavenly Emperor rose again, facing east, and recited:

> Pure feathers mottled with mysterious black wings,  
> Riding floating, falling, turning with fate.  
> Flowing incense fills the Ten Heavens,  
> Fragrant herbs lush in the Great Tenuity.  
> Spirit edict opens hidden mechanisms,  
> Feather scripture shines with mysterious radiance.  
> The supreme dao is originally without secret,  
> Holding truth, the vision flies by itself.

Thus ended the recitations. The Venerable Patriarch of Great Truth donned the dharma robe, crowned with the supreme heavenly limitless Three Treasures jade crown, wore the seamless nine-colored flying sky-radiant feather chapter garment, left side adorned with flowing bells, right side girded with seven primes, prostrated facing due south.

The Supreme Heavenly Emperor rose and commanded the Feather Immortal Attendant to hold the golden altar and present the scripture. Kneeling long facing north, he bestowed it upon the Great Truth. All immortals acclaimed its excellence. The Great Truth stood receiving the scripture, golden light radiating from his face, and from his five limbs naturally arose the Numinous Flying Jade Talisman.

Ascending, he gathered all perfected beings, boarded the White Luan chariot, drove the black-winged phoenix, to feast in the Eternal Yang. Eastward to the realm of the Qianmulin and the green waters; the ruins of Fusang and the mouths of the Nine Springs; westward to the domain of the Mysterious Feathers and the pure wilderness, the banks of Mengsi; southward to the Zhu Ling, essence of extreme flame, the city of Nanjia; northward to the Shuo Yin grotto of mystery, the land of cold waters; central plateau of the Ten Extremes, yellow qi and yang essence, the Great Mysterious Jade Capital, golden terraces, jade chambers, cinnabar palaces; roaming the bright Ten Heavens, the Eight Domains of pure grottoes.

He commanded the leadership of countless perfected beings: no heaven unlinked, no netherworld unbound, no qi ungoverned, no immortal uncollected. Universally commanding host gods, from Heaven below, none but conform to the virtue of the Great Truth, revering the Feather Scripture as their ancestor.

Thus the emperors each floated in mysterious palaces, scripture kalpa seven thousand, transmitted to the Most High Patriarch of the Great Dao.

According to the law, once every three thousand years they are passed on, not to be lightly revealed. To proclaim the heavenly truth, to violate the oath and break the pledge, is to serve the ghostly officials, bring calamity upon the nine ancestors, and be forever sealed in the nether springs.
