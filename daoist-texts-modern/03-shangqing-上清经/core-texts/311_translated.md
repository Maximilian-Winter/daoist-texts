### The Supreme Clarity Great Cavern Nine Microcosms Eight Dao Great Scripture and Sublime Registers

Beyond the Six Heavens’ texts of the Three Heavens’ Correct Dharma, the Holy Lord of Dongling commanded the Little Sovereign of the Clear Void and the Lesser Heavens to compile this collection of immortal and perfected secret registers. Its general title is the Six Heavens’ Texts of the Three Heavens’ Supreme Correct Dharma, designed to capture ten thousand demons and bind myriad evils. Passed down thrice every seven hundred years, with a true person bestowing it once every one hundred years. All observe a fast of three days, or seven days. Within the fast, they offer the scripture’s master ten taels of fine gold as a token of faith to open communication with the spirits. Those in the world who do not follow these rules incur punishment for seven generations, as in the laws of the Four Extremities. Wearing the scripture prevents one from encountering the turbid and defiling yin qi; if violated, the body perishes and one surely becomes a lowly ghost. To reverently carry it is to ascend to Supreme Clarity, to rise to Supreme Clarity. The Eight Sovereigns regard it as the true certificate of immortality; those who possess the true certificate hold the Taiji script on jade slips.

The Most High’s Multitude of Textual Registers

The talisman on the right: the upper text in vermilion script, the lower text in azure script, the border all in vermilion.

These three yuan (primordial) sovereign purple scripts announce to the myriad spirits of the Six Heavens, instructing them to open and guide the cloud dragons of the Ten Directions. Those who reverently receive and wear them must cultivate with precision and avoid treading upon yin defilement.

Beyond the Six Heavens’ true texts of Supreme Clarity, those who do not wear this register, when the era of great peace arrives, shall not be able to receive the Holy Lords at the Supreme Clarity Palace. The Three Heavens’ Correct Dharma is passed down by the True King of Unbroken Obscurity.

The talisman on the right is in vermilion script.

The chief bearer of the multitude of true textual registers is the Most High, who commands ten jade youths to attend the text, guarding and protecting the bearer of the register. Later, the sage Lord Li commanded the Lesser Sovereign of the Heavens to gather the true texts of the myriad heavens, forming the Three Heavens’ Correct Dharma. Those who wear it shall all be able to welcome the Holy Lords within the Supreme Clarity Palace. The Three Heavens Nine Microcosms Mysterious Capital Supreme True Yin-Yang Spiritual Register Upper Origin Chapter was received by the Great Emperor’s Father-in-Law from the Most High True Sovereign of the Supreme Void.

The Taiwei Spiritual Capital Graceful True Person’s Three Directions Text, bestowed by the True King of the Nine Heavens to the Most High Father-in-Law, when worn, summons the myriad gods, prolongs life by hundreds of millions of years, and protects the body with three hundred direct talismans, six thousand jade maidens, six heavens’ eight attendants, all residing in the Taiwei Spiritual Capital’s True Palace. Disciples who wear the text vow to cultivate and revere it.

The above two talismans on the right: vermilion border with yellow script.

The above three talismans on the right: all vermilion by day.

The above eight talismans on the right: vermilion border with yellow script.

The Nine Microcosms Eight Dao talismans and registers are transmitted to immortals and Daoist aspirants with resolve. They emerge thrice every one hundred years. Swear allegiance to the Supreme Sovereign Lord, sacrifice to the Nine Emperors, the Magnificent Mysterious Yellow Maiden; do not recklessly reveal them. Only those with utmost resolve may be shown—be cautious, be cautious.

Respectfully bearing this trust, I present myself before the Three Caverns’ Dharma Master, humbly requesting to receive the Great Supreme Clarity Great Cavern Nine Microcosms Eight Dao Great Sublime Precious Text Upper Register. I vow to conceal my resolve and cultivate accordingly, following the master’s instructions and oath. Should there be any Daoist aspirant or immortal registry bearer with a name, the transmission occurs thrice every one hundred years, continuing the grand legacy. From ancient times to now, the human heart has grown muddled; though such persons appear from time to time, none dare to suppress this treasure. Now there is a certain person, by nature refined and elegant, who ardently admires the precious text, diligently striving day and night without slackening, dwelling in a secluded famous peak, freed from worldly burdens, clutching the words and bearing this trust, seeking me to receive it. By law and oath I bestow it. Should there be violation, the Seven Mysterious Parents shall examine and punish in the dark palace, breaking stones and carrying sand to block the river’s source. Clearly, one must be most cautious, most cautious, exactly as the oath text and decrees command.
