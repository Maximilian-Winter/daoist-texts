## Preface to the Supreme Clarity Great Cavern True Scripture  
By the Twenty-Third Generation Maoshan Supreme Clarity Patriarch, Master Guan Miao, narrated by Zhu Ziying

The Dao is born from non-being, hidden within the myriad spirits yet unfathomable; the spirit condenses within the void, wondrously transforming ten thousand changes without fixed form. It is profound and dark yet has essence, calm and settled yet radiating light. Boundless in the great mystery, it attains emptiness by guarding stillness—this is called the Great Cavern. When it gathers essence and concentrates spirit, it governs the ancestral qi to revolve and return; it refines spirit to unite with the Dao, harnessing the auspicious wind to stir and dance. From nothing suddenly arises being; breath scatters into myriad forms of spirits; movement reaches its extreme and returns to stillness, faint and vague, encircling the wondrous unity of the Emperor One—this is called the Returning Wind Mixed. It is the root planted universally by Heaven and Earth, the origin of the creation by the august Emperors and Sages.

When a person is born, they receive qi from the Great Ultimate, and their movement and stillness follow the laws of Heaven and Earth; their spirit is initiated by the One Origin, and their entire body is encompassed by yin and yang. Therefore, the Supreme Clarity’s thirty-nine august emperors revolve truly below, entering the thirty-nine gates within the destined body. Each, through the gate they govern, inscribes a chapter of the scripture. Its words are profound and obscure, employed to command and encompass the myriad spirits, summoning true and dispelling false. This is what is called the auspicious clouds opening the gate of birth, the propitious smoke sealing the gate of death. Hence, the Central Yellow Elder Elemental Dao Sovereign Lord oversees the profound meaning of these august sages, compiling the great cavern true scripture—thus it is called the Thirty-Nine Chapters Scripture.

Moreover, the Returning Wind Emperor One, the High Origin Heroic One, and the Five Elders Feminine One—these three scriptures serve to assist the revered Thirty-Nine Chapters Scripture. The Dao has three marvels: the first marvel is the *Great Cavern True Scripture in Thirty-Nine Chapters*, the second marvel is the *Five Elders Feminine One Precious Scripture*, and the third marvel is the *Elemental Spirit Great Possession Wondrous Scripture*. Therefore, the Thirty-Nine Chapters are the wondrous formulas of the Nine Heavens, the foremost scripture of the Supreme Origin Great Element Sovereign Lord’s golden book. It is also called the *Three Heavens Dragon Book* and the *Nine Heavens Great True Dao Scripture*.

This scripture’s creation came from the mysterious ten directions, compiled by the Primordial Heavenly King’s circulating qi. The Queen Mother of the West received the Dao from the Primordial Heavenly King and together engraved it in the Northern Origin Heavenly Central Record, the Naxie Kingdom, the Mountain of the Spirit Mirror Human-Bird, and the Grotto of Jilai. Within the void chamber, they gathered the nine mysterious perfect unity qi, binding it into a book whose characters measure one zhang in height, preserved to this day.

The Primordial Heavenly King further transmitted it to the Supreme Clarity Eight True Central Yellow Elder Sovereign Lord, who taught that those below should become perfected persons ascending the Three Stars. The Central Yellow Elder Sovereign Lord concealed this scripture, so in the world, on the five sacred mountains of Earth and the heavens above, this scripture is never found. The Supreme Clarity celestial beings especially treasure this secret. Only the Great Mystery has a golden pavilion with jade names, exquisite slips and purple bamboo scripts; the Three Primordials have secret registers of the combined dawn; the Elixir Platform has yellow characters. Only those who are truly perfected may receive it.

This scripture is the way standard of the August Sovereign, the wondrous chapter of the Purple Dawn, the ladder commanding the Nine Heavens, summoning the spirits of the Five Emperors, releasing the Returning Wind Mixed, condensing the nine revolutions within the mysterious essence, interweaving male and female, blending myriad spirits, arrayed in solemn gloom, the jade resonance of the Great True, operating the dispelling of falsehood in the bright beam, communicating the changes in the mysterious gate, thoroughly manifesting virtue to create marvels, washing brilliance to reflect the clouds. The Great Han is the spirit pass of qi; without cutting, it is the year of the vast kalpa. Lofty is the divine pavilion, abyss of myriad truths, the golden chamber shining resplendently, lofty indeed is Supreme Clarity.

Its meaning is subtle and profound, difficult to fully fathom. The destined one must fast long, sever worldly attachments, recite the jade chapter in the curved chamber, strike the jade sound to shake the spirit. Then the perfected person fixes the register at the Eastern Splendor, the seven mysteries further moisten the purple chamber, restrain the demon king with awe-inspiring power, gather the Five Emperors to guard the body, circle ten thousand times until the flesh body flies, summon seven revolutions until the life controller arrives.

This wondrous chapter of the Great Cavern governs myriad ways and returns to life from non-being. It has no strange hairs or alien substance; golden bones and jade names must not be falsely revealed in spiritual texts. Its prohibitions all follow the Nine True Bright Codes. The destined one must endure three years of bitter fasting to obtain the right to read it.

When the recitation of this chapter is completed ten thousand times, the Central Yellow Elder Dao Sovereign Lord reports upward; the Most High commands a cinnabar whirlwind green canopy chariot, the Nine Spirits envoy Taiyi Life Controller comes to welcome at the hour of the Rat. Then the Five Elders wing the carriage, the Eight Winds fan the feathers, divine thunder leads the way, jade splendor supports the axle, riding clouds and driving dragons, ascending to Heaven that very day to the palace of the Great Element Three Primordial Sovereign Lords to receive the scripture.

This is called ascending Supreme Clarity, receiving the Great Ultimate scripture, and being appointed the High Immortal Left Minister. If the destined one has this scripture but may not read it, the Great Subtle Heavenly Emperor Sovereign Lord will pull out the death register, at the beginning of scripture bestow the fixed true register, at the start of fasting record the Great Ultimate, carve the name Eastern Splendor, report to the Most High, record and seal at the Turtle Terrace. The myriad spirits and thousand souls all call the destined one the Nine Mysterious Grand Master, ranked equal to the Supreme Clarity Immortal Earl. The manner of receiving the scripture follows the Nine True Bright Codes exactly; the destined one should comply accordingly.
