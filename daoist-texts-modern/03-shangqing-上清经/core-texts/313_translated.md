Preface to the Jade Instructions and Pronunciations of the Supreme Clarity Great Cavern True Scripture  
By the disciple Zhenjing, Master of the Great Cavern Three Scenes, bestowed the Purple Seal, Chen Jingyuan composed

The *Great Cavern True Scripture in Thirty-Nine Chapters* stands in solemn rank, crowned as the foremost treasure scripture of the Three Caverns. Its numinous chapters and secret blessings, jade-inspected hidden writings, are recorded in full detail. Since the descent from the Western City’s General True Lord and the Southern Pole Purple Origin Lord, transmitted to the Pure Void Perfected, who then passed it to Lady Wei of the Southern Mountain, it is said: “If you are not within the mountains, concealing your form in pure fasting, breathing in and out within the void, then the *Great Cavern True Scripture* must not be read lightly.” Why so? Because the wondrous sounds penetrate ninefold, the true voice sings on high, the literary qi mingles with the jade void in profound accord, the rosy hues flow freely with the sun itself. When lips move to utter, the jade blossoms instantly appear; when chanting the numinous verses, one is carried to covenant with the Most High; when still and upright, the purple chamber self-observes; when thoughts dwell on the desired, one touches the responsive resonance. Thus the seven ancestors gained blessings, received the talismanic registers of the Immortal Palace, transcended the ghostly shadows, and feasted together in the Vermilion Mound. This scripture is lofty and subtle, commanding the chariot at dawn, riding the dragon of the scene on the path above—this is not for the dust-bound and worldly to undertake. Should one read it amidst the mundane, the Three Officials and Northern Emperor slightly disturb its sounds, the listening qi becomes impure, and the clear resonance of Supreme Clarity cannot be attained; the voice cannot enter the numinous chamber of the Purple Tenuity.

In the *Essentials of the Azure Purple Book*, the Central Yellow Elder Lord says: “To behold the *Great Cavern True Scripture in Thirty-Nine Chapters* is to ascend to Heaven in broad daylight. Yet those who cultivate it for years without success say the scripture is not genuine. This is all because they lack the golden slips of the Eastern Splendor, the jade talismans of the Golden Palace; the true numinous does not descend for them, but rather the heavenly demons come, hence no efficacy is felt. Merely possessing the divine scripture will never suffice.” If only one first presented the golden slips to the Azure Palace, offered the jade talisman to the Emperor Sovereign, received the golden morning and jade youth, and the Western Splendor jade maiden as attendants of the numinous texts, universally descending through all heavens and earths, the Three Realms would acclaim it; chanting the chapters countless times, how could it fail to summon the jade chariot and purple canopy?

This scripture descended to the world, known only to the phrases of Master Yang and Master Xu, the Wangwu Sima Master of the House, and successive generations of exalted Daoists, all following the prescribed rules and mutual pledges, orally transmitting the chanting methods, secretly entrusting the subtle mingling of meanings. Hence it earned the name “Book of Golden Rules,” treading the path of Supreme Clarity. Now the true winds have dispersed, false hermits hide in the mountains, the model of the Dao is unheard, teachers and disciples are neglected, the teaching and methods decline—none more so than this.

Jingyuan, having left home in his youth and sought the Dao, wandered for barely thirty years, leading for more than ten years, then returned aged to Maoshan, built a hermitage to repent, lamenting his meager Dao affinity and heavy worldly karma. Though diligently studying the teachings, he had yet to meet a true master. Desiring to chant the Cavern Scripture, how could he dare to open its hidden meanings? Thus, purifying body and mind, quietly attending to reverence and purity, he sought ancient editions widely, first examining them carefully, delving deeply and repeatedly, analyzing every phrase and character without omission. When two meanings conflicted, confusion only increased—such as “hair” written as “smoke of hair.” Or partial substitutions and careless alterations, characters floating and mixed, like “rest” written as “song,” or “song” written as “rest.” These were thefts and private transmissions, handed down with errors. He then took the earlier masters’ study copies—the masters of the Three Caverns, Master Guan Miao and Master Chong Miao Huangfu Xi, all reciting the Cavern Scripture and living in the era of the Heavenly Sage. Comparing with the Maoshan hidden edition, he compiled pronunciations and annotations, explaining agreements and differences, roughly resolving doubts, but did not dare to reveal the Dharma meanings, merely recording what he had seen. Then, during the three-month fasting period, he carefully copied the Cavern Scripture Jade Instructions into one volume, reverently saluting morning and evening, earnestly hoping the numinous beings would grant transmission according to the rules, thus fulfilling his long-cherished aspiration.

### Chapter One: Scripture of the Supreme Void Emperor Lord of the Dao  
“Long Covenant, One Movement” (ancient text writes “one” as “single”). “Seven Generations” (one text writes “seven ancestors”). “Throw Leisure” (one text writes “barrier”). “Ling Fan” (pronounced “wen cheng”). Ancient texts write “ling” and “ling” interchangeably. “World Sends Jade Orchid” (one text writes “simple”). “Eight Luminaries” (one text writes “radiance”). “Following wind, separating root, matching, shifting foundation, reaching transformation into the profound” (one text writes “shifting chess, reaching transformation into the profound origin,” some texts add “elemental” twice, or read the next line as “Elemental Supreme High Spirit Jade Pure King.” The Maoshan edition lacks the “elemental” characters; this edition follows Maoshan as standard). “Male and female entrust spirit transformation” (one text writes “entrust” as “strange”). “Hundred Muddled” (pronounced “qi hun”). Ancient texts write “mixed” as “jiao,” all entering the Emperor Hall assembly. According to the Dao Lord’s jade notes: “The ‘Yi’ is ‘good’; the gate above the Nine Heavens at the northwest is named ‘Yi.’ Only upon entering the gate of ‘Yi’ can one ascend to the Emperor Hall’s assembly chamber.” The character “chamber” though rhyming with the previous text, should follow the jade notes and be “assembly.” “Bo Dai Tai” (one text writes “bi jian tai”).

### Chapter Two: Scripture of the Supreme Emperor Jade Void Lord of the Dao  
“Yan Yan,” pronounced “yan,” meaning light. “One thousand kalpas begin one cycle” (one text writes “ten kalpas begin one cycle”).

### Chapter Three: Scripture of the Emperor Supreme Jade Emperor Lord of the Dao  
The Jade Emperor bears the mysterious supreme banner, commanding the nine heavens’ steps (Maoshan edition lacks the character “steps”). “Seven awakenings receive the Dao count,” according to the Dao Lord’s jade notes: “Seven awakenings are repeated enlightenment in the netherworld, searching in the dim dawn; once the heart is clear and bright, then one knows the calling and Dao count.” The Dao count is the Great Cavern matter of the Cavern True Emperor One. One text writes “seven awakenings receive the count of the Dao,” which is likely mistaken. “Feng Can Bei Ting Hua, Zi Ying Chang Dong (Wang Qi), Lin He Jiu Xiao Wai, Yu Fu Zheng Tai Wei (Wang Qi),” the rhymes are not collected, no pronunciation can explain. According to the *Demon-Dispelling Scripture*’s *Entering Samadhi* chapter: “Feng Can Ting Lang Hua, Zi Gui He Xi Xi, Lin Shi Wu Jiu Xiao, Yu Jie Zheng Tai Wei,” the meaning matches the Cavern Scripture; “Wang Qi” is likely a copying error for “Xi.” “Guang Wei,” pronounced “yu wu,” meaning literary. Same below. “Miao Miao Ling Jing Wu,” “ling” in one text is “cloud.” According to the Dao Lord’s jade notes: “Unless one is the dim-seeking cloud scene and does not ascend the golden chamber, unless one repeatedly chants the Cavern chapters and does not see the jade guest.” The meanings of “Ling Jing” and “Cloud Jing” remain unresolved; follow Huangfu’s text as “Ling” to complete the true master’s questioning. “Sen Sa,” pronounced “su yi.” “Empty Clear Splendor,” Shi Chong says: “Original name.” Huangfu’s text writes “Qing.” “Zhu Yu Luo,” one text writes “Zhu” as “Shu.”

### Chapter Four: Scripture of the Supreme Emperor Purple Morning Lord of the Dao  
“Left no Ying Gongzi Xuan Chong Shu,” one text writes “Xuan Yuan Shu.” The Jade Instructions of the Five Elders also say “Xuan Yuan Shu.” The *Great Elixir Hidden Scripture* of the Cavern True also says “Xuan Chong Shu,” hence these two names. “Ling Guan Great Desert Below,” ancient text writes “mo.” “Ai Mo,” pronounced “mo pei,” meaning faint darkness. “Xuan Xuan Shu Fire King,” the *Great Elixir Hidden Scripture* says: “Below Xuan Lord Shu Fire King, styled You Hui Guang.” “Wang,” one text writes “jade.” “Xuan Dong Four Villages,” one text writes “Dong One Four Villages.” “Named An Yan Chang,” one text writes “An Yan Chang.” “He Ying,” the *Great Elixir Hidden Scripture* says: “Blue Qi Lord An Yan Chang, styled He Ying.” “Pan Chang Zai,” ancient text writes “(eye + clever right side).” “Fa Wu Lun,” one text writes “remove Wu Lun.”

### Chapter Five: Scripture of the Supreme Emperor Taiwei Lord of the Dao  
“Cavern Yang Yu Ling Treasure Soul born in golden radiant qi essence,” one text writes “radiant radiant” as “shining shining.” “Ba Zhi Hou Ye Huan,” one text writes “Ba Yun Hou Shi Huan.” Shi Chong rhyme, pronounced “huan.” “Zhuo Duan,” Shi Chong upper “yao” cut, lower “tu guan” cut. Later “duan” and “luo” same. “Ao Ming Qi Ye Sun,” one text writes “ye” as “hua,” Huangfu’s text writes “ming ming qi ye sun,” Maoshan writes “ao ming,” Shi Chong’s pronunciation and meaning also “ao,” pronounced “wu meng.” According to the True Hermits’ taboos, the Supreme True Bright Dao Lord’s name is Ao Meng. The *Jiyun* dictionary says ancient “meng” cut, meaning bright. Same pronunciation as “kuang.” “(Unknown character) Sha Xuan,” (unknown character) same as “bei.”

### Chapter Six: Scripture of the Three Primordial Purple Essence Lord of the Dao  
“Bones have jade flower,” one text writes “ying.” “Born joy,” pronounced “luo.” “Jade immortal,” “jade,” one text writes “five.”

### Chapter Eight: Scripture of the Supreme Origin Tai Su Three Primordial Lords of the Dao  
“Golden talisman summons the minister,” one text writes “xiang,” possibly rhyming with “xiang.” “Supreme High Demon-Dispelling Jade Pure King,” Huangfu and Maoshan texts as above, one text writes “Supreme High Spirit Jade Pure King.” “Those who know me are long-lived, those who preserve me do not decay,” one text writes “know me and live, preserve me and do not decay.” “Relying on avoiding wrong,” “rely” one text writes “serve.” “Chivalrous to me,” Shi Chong says: “Should be ‘jia,’ meaning to serve.” “Golden kerchief and feather pendant,” pronounced “ju yan,” meaning kerchief covering the head. “Yan,” pronounced “xiang zhan,” meaning fragrant cut. The *Dengzhen Yinjue* says: “Golden kerchief is the name of the Heavenly True crown kerchief.” Its making is inauspicious.

### Chapter Nine: Scripture of the Supreme Clarity Purple Essence Three Su Lords of the Dao  
“My body born with feathered garments, flying and ascending the Nine Heavens’ thoroughfares,” one text omits “my.” According to the jade notes: “The Supreme Clarity Purple Essence Heaven contains a tree whose leaves resemble bamboo and are red, its blossoms like mirrors shining bright, its fruit like plums without pits, named the Forest of Nurturing Blossoms. Eating its leaves wards off hunger, eating its blossoms grants immortality, eating its fruit enables flying immortals.

“Bladder,” two pronunciations. “Central Yellow Emperor containing light dew,” various editions preserve chapter thirty-seven on the method of thinking of five emperors, but only the East, South, West, and North emperors are included, all named “Five Emperors,” missing the Central Yellow Emperor title. Only the Three Caverns Master Guan Miao’s edition has this Central Yellow Emperor Containing Light Dew title, completing the method of thinking, further perfected by the true master’s questioning. “Heavy veil,” upper “zhi long” cut, lower pronounced “mi,” meaning covering food cloth; the character also written as “min.” “Clothed garment,” pronounced “pi.” “Important pendant,” upper “yi yao” cut, sometimes written “waist.” “Embroidered cape,” Shi Chong rhymes pronounce “pi.” “Curtain canopy,” upper “yu bei” cut, meaning awning. “Lan Gan,” two pronunciations meaning balustrade. “Turning store” departing tone. “Camp mechanism,” one text writes “mechanism.” “Circulating Supreme One,” one text writes “cavern flowing.” “Born equal two principles,” one text writes “two principles.” “Nourishing mud,” upper pronounced “bu.” “One heart elemental lord,” one text writes “su” as “qi.” “Position as heavenly lord,” one text writes “heaven” as “great.” “Opening divine splendor,” one text writes “open” as “close.” “Great era origin,” one text writes “great” as “big.”

### Chapter Thirty-Eight: Scripture of the Supreme Origin Morning Lord Carving Moth Eyebrow Mountain Cavern Palace Jade Gate Tai Su Lord of the Dao  
“Moth eyebrow,” sometimes written “e mei.” “Emperor minister beginning binding essence,” one text writes “binding” as “diligent.” “Three elegant branches,” pronounced “ge.” “Supreme Origin Tai Su Cavern Scene Profound Mysterious,” according to the Dao Lord’s jade notes: “Supreme Nothing is above the Cavern Scene, Tai Su is above the Profound Mysterious; the nine palaces array golden gates in Tai Su’s heaven, cinnabar towers obscure sevenfold in Supreme Nothing’s court.” One text writes “Tai Su Cavern Scene, exiting darkness entering mystery,” likely mistaken. “Three five flowing transformation,” one text writes “three five flowing spread,” likely rhyming pronunciation; but below already has Hundred Spirits proclamation, so follow Huangfu’s text as “transformation.” “White origin controller moon dusk,” one text writes “moon degree,” one writes “moon night.” “Heart mysterious dim enlightenment,” one text writes “dim” as “miao.”

### Chapter Thirty-Nine: Scripture of the Common Era Turtle Mountain Nine Spirit True Immortal Mother Azure Golden Elixir Empress of the Dao  
“Infant ignorant,” ancient scriptures mostly write “ignorant,” Shi Chong pronounces “meng.” “Branches,” Shi Chong says: “Accumulated branches are like accumulated generations.” “Shen Shen,” pronounced “suo zhen,” meaning numerous. “Receiving ride bright,” one text writes “ride” as “hanging.”

According to the *Dengzhen Yinjue* second scripture, the transmission regulations say: “Currently in the world there are two editions of the *Great Cavern True Scripture*. One is a large scroll, beginning with the Returning Wind Mingling Dao, but its words and meanings are falsely appended and mostly superficial and counterfeit; the other contains only thirty-nine chapters, within which are several phrases matching those spoken by Master You Ying, but they are mixed and indistinguishable. Only by personally seeing the true edition can one properly follow it. It is also heard that those who obtain the thirty-nine chapters of Yang and Xu are no different from the small edition in the world; since it has not been personally seen, the right and wrong cannot be judged; it is proper to copy it to supplement the catalog. There is also one scroll of jade notes, which briefly explains the meaning within the Cavern Scripture, which may also be recorded.”

Furthermore, according to the *Essentials of the Azure Purple Book Golden Root Scripture*, the Central Yellow Elder Lord says: “To behold the *Great Cavern True Scripture in Thirty-Nine Chapters* is to ascend to Heaven in broad daylight. Yet those who cultivate it for years without success say the scripture is not genuine. This is all because they lack the golden slips of the Eastern Splendor, the jade talismans of the Golden Palace; the true numinous does not descend for them, but rather the heavenly demons come, hence no efficacy is felt. Merely possessing the divine scripture will never suffice. If only one first presented the golden slips to the Azure Palace, offered the jade talisman to the Emperor Sovereign, received the golden morning and jade youth, and the Western Splendor jade maiden as attendants of the numinous texts, universally descending through all heavens, the Three Realms would acclaim it; chanting the chapters countless times, how could it fail to summon the jade chariot and purple canopy?
