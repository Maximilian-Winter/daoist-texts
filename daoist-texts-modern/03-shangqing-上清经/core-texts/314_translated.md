### Scripture of the Primordial Truth of Supreme Clarity: Five Registers and Talismans

The Five Spirits of the Great Unity present the Five Talismans and the Five Registers,  
Ascending to petition the Sovereign Emperor for the Way of Cosmic Fusion,  
Seeking the secret art of longevity and the divine immortals.

The talisman of the Five Spirits’ Inner Treasure is the Way of the Great Unity Emperor’s harmonious fusion of light.  
By inscribing the Five Talismans according to one’s natal day, placing them together in a brocade pouch,  
And carrying it with you, one attains longevity and immortality.

Moreover, on the month of one’s birth, at the hour and day within that month corresponding to one’s natal time,  
Enter a chamber and inscribe the Five Talismans; then present them to the King and consume them.  
Upon completion, recite this blessing:

“The Five Spirits of the Great Unity,  
Record the year of birth in the Registers;  
A thousand years, ten thousand years,  
Age with Heaven as your peer.  
The Emperor holds the talisman,  
Granting life without decline.”

If one wishes to consume these talismans repeatedly,  
The best times are the nights of the fifth day of the fifth month, the seventh day of the seventh month, and the ninth day of the ninth month.

The Great Unity’s talisman governing the Three Souls and Seven Spirits.

The Great Unity’s precious spirit summoning the Emperor’s talisman,  
Inscribed in vermilion on white paper at the eight seasonal nodes and at midday daily.  
Upon consumption, recite this blessing:

“Most High Three Mysteries,  
The Emperor dwells within the soul;  
The Five Spirits of the Great Unity,  
Protect the soul and secure the body;  
Within the Purple Chamber there is destiny,  
Commanding and restraining the myriad spirits.”

The Emperor of the Great Unity’s internal spirit talisman, composed of twelve heads,  
All are the breath of the Most High Primordial Essence,  
Utmost truth and utmost secrecy, not to be transmitted recklessly.  
Separately, there is also the Great Unity’s external secret method,  
With talismanic script greatly differing, all from the upper text of the Scripture of Emperor Chang of Zhongjin.  
If not genuine, its use is ineffective—those with good omens should revere and be cautious.

The Great Unity Emperor’s talisman for unbinding the three gates and twelve knots within the fetal body,  
Using one’s natal day or the eight seasonal nodes, when one wishes to perform unbinding,  
First swallow three of these talismans, facing the direction of one’s birth.  
Written in true vermilion on white bamboo slips wrapped in pale membranes,  
Born within the firm joints, then entering the void to receive the spirit.  
Thus, the bamboo membrane is inscribed as the script for unbinding the knots.
