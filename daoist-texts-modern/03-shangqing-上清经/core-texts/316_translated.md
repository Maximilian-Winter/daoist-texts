### Supreme Clarity’s Most High Jade Morning Phoenix Terrace Qu Su Shang Scripture

The Most High Jade Morning Phoenix Terrace Qu Su Shang Scripture—within the mysterious capital’s nine-curved tombs and layered phoenix terraces, the natural phoenix qi is gathered and formed. The jade chambers rest above the Nine Heavens, on the sunny side of the Jade Capital, where the void births the eight assemblies, mingling the true qi; ten folds, nine curves, penetrating the eight directions, summoning the soaring wings of the phoenix, alongside connecting the eight essences’ numinous spirits, binding the nine primordial oneness qi to compose the words of joy and sorrow, illuminating the mysterious terrace above.

The characters measure one zhang square, the text splendidly radiant, revealing the Nine Heavens. Flying phoenixes cover the clouds, purple qi dense and deep; swimming scales and roaming beasts intertwine and rush across. Six commanding lions stand guard below the gate; the Five Emperors and Jade Immortals hold five-colored command magic spirit banners, wielding awe to govern the five directions. On the right, the Taihua Jade Maidens attend; on the left, the Golden Immortal Jade Boys, each with three thousand attendants, serve the true classic incense.

Sun and moon shine side by side, the seven primordials return their spirits, three mornings align their light, mysterious radiance penetrates clearly. The jade forest shakes its branches, jade sounds stir the courtyard, seven treasures gleam brilliantly, streaming radiance ascends Supreme Clarity. This is governed by the Most High Jade Morning Supreme Dao Lord. The Mysterious Capital Elder, with phoenix script true writing of joy and sorrow’s melodies, mysteriously bestowed upon the Dao Lord.

Thus, all the myriad true beings of the upper heavens and the flying immortals of the Five Sacred Mountains ascend the phoenix terrace on the fifth, fifteenth, and twenty-fifth days of each month, performing elegant rites and fragrant wanderings, chanting the words of joy and sorrow. The upper blessings of the divine immortals, the lower compassion for the suffering people—their words are subtle and ethereal, jade bright and clear. The Four True Ones bow in reverence, myriad immortals sound their ritual music, scattering incense drifting to the skies, smoke flowing through the empty courtyard.

Whenever the upper palace is completed with perfected beings, or those beginning to learn as immortals, none fail to thoroughly cultivate the Nine Heavens phoenix qi, the Mysterious Hill true writing, chanting the melodies of joy and sorrow. The ancient mysteries have been transmitted once in ten thousand kalpas; now there are those who, within seven hundred years, have heard three transmissions. Possessing this text, they fly in Supreme Clarity, ascend the nine-curved phoenix terrace, and pay homage to the Jade True One.

Lightly leaking causes blindness; the seven ancestors sternly admonish—be cautious, and one may become a spirit-immortal. Whoever obtains the Mysterious Hill Tai True Writing, the Five Emperors’ command magic spirit banners, can then command the void to summon spirits, control demons, and command gods. Possessing the Five Phases secret talismans, one calls the soul and secures the spirit, preserving the divine self eternally. Reciting the words of joy and sorrow transcends the nine mysteries of the body, roaming peacefully in the Jade Capital. Wearing the Qu Su phoenix qi, one sees the peaceful reception of the holy lord, the body ascends the Mysterious Capital, receiving the immortal upper truth.

Thus, the Nine Heavens phoenix script words of joy and sorrow, the Mysterious Hill Tai True [Writing]#1, all are formed from the natural qi of the Nine Heavens. The numinous script reveals wonders within the void and mystery, enduring ninety thousand kalpas. The Mysterious Capital Elder received it from the Vast Void, transmitting it to the Most High Dao Lord, who passed it to the Supreme Ultimate Perfected One. The Perfected One transmitted it to the Eastern Sea’s various palaces’ Azure Youth Lords, who passed it to Daoist adepts with jade names, destined to be divine immortals.

Wearing it for twenty years, one may see the Three Primordials, who welcome the holy lord at Supreme Clarity’s Golden Palace. Over seven hundred years, three transmissions occur; within a hundred years, those worthy may receive it, with two permitted transmissions. During fasting, incense is burned and gold is offered—five taels of upper gold—then a solemn oath of gold and blue is sworn, replacing the blood altar covenant.

## The Most High Jade Morning Qu Su Words of Joy and Sorrow Wisdom

### Eastern Azure Emperor

Binding my natural qi, condensing the purple phoenix city. The high terrace soars beyond nine ridges, layered and lush with flying jade. Radiant joy ascends the great void, winding and penetrating the eight pure realms. The purple void shines over the cloud palace, streaming brilliance veils the five spirits. Four directions reach infinite wilds, eight qi revolve in perfect clarity. The soaring wings move the great void, seven lights turn the heavenly scripture. Movement comes as if rootless; time departs following transformation’s tilt. Nine encircling measures within, two images mutually contest. The emperor one firmly holds the central origin, four principles never falter in spirit. South gathers the flying sovereign’s fruit, north draws the vast cold court. The mysterious chamber mingles true assemblies, void songs born naturally. The Five Emperors command spirit banners, waving flags to summon myriad spirits. Demons howl from the void; the Dao governs joy without end.

Thus arise the Qu Su words, celebrating the divine, rejoicing in great peace. How vast the accord—one kalpa as a single lifespan. Revolving through ninety thousand kalpas, together roaming the purple phoenix carriage. The void births the purple phoenix terrace, jade towers join the Great Subtle. The numinous wind penetrates the eight assemblies, northern windows open the palace gates. Above, howling singing children constantly chant the cycle of loss and decline. At dawn, they ride the light to roam; at dusk, they attach to the light to return. Two lights merge as one body, fearing loss of radiant brilliance. The nine-five (sovereign) does not dwell constantly; Heaven and Earth face peril and tilt. The great kalpa ends a cycle; one hundred and sixty cycles reverse the movement. Flood springs surge through nine ridges; great birds soar, sky-hanging. Ten thousand crawling creatures drift in long streams, turning to the mountains with no place to rest. Wailing tears reach the endless horizon—how can one not grieve the human heart? The worthy sages diligently chant the scripture, thus able to ride the light and fly. When the time comes, they are welcomed and escorted, gathering at the Nine Heavens’ gates. The golden horse stars run out, myriad plagues cross and rush. No sight of those learning immortality—only the lamentations of the lost corpses. Alas for this ignorant commoner, holding fate, pain and sorrow abound.

---

### Southern Red Emperor

Scattering sorrow on the nine mysterious terraces, gathering joy on the steps of the great void. Carrying the covenant of the ten heavenly truths, howling commands the Eastern Sea youths. Four directions reach the eight assemblies’ qi, interweaving with the Lang Terrace winds. Eyes shine on the Western Floral Pavilion, thoughts unite with the Vast Cold Palace. Dancing beneath the purple phoenix, desolate are the nine ridge peaks. Gazing over infinite wilds, looking up amid kalpa heights. Clear songs harmonize palace tones; joy and sorrow accompany each other. Two paths harmonize one covenant; reason opposes yet returns to unity. Together they rejoice without end, holding the beginning and the end. Sweetly drinking jade pool nectar, looking up to rejoice with the flying floral sovereign. The spirit melon naturally ripens, yet not like the sun and moon’s light. The seven luminaries flow fragrant radiance—how can such joy be forgotten? The great kalpa has an end and movement; the cycle reverses as two images tilt. Dragon gate severs the heavenly river; three and five oppose each other. The red sovereign guards the eastern well; the floral canopy hides the morning star. Mysterious radiance darkens the eight wildernesses; foul qi veils the heavenly essence. The Three Officials hasten their control; the Five Mountains’ spirits are unsteady. Ten thousand plagues cross and rush; the Northern Emperor’s brave demon soldiers. Eight nets spread beyond heaven; the holy lord cannot purify. Thus natural qi is gathered, rising to the ninefold city. The high observatory pities myriad beings; joy and sorrow arise from this. Mysterious songs scatter divine robes; veiled joy turns to tears. Alas for these stubborn commoners, stingy with wealth and entangled in lust. Eagerly awaiting fate’s arrival, heedless of impending calamity. The wise and intelligent come from afar, morning and night diligently chanting scriptures. Revering the void, contemplating mystery, to transcend endless lifespans. If one can seek the dao’s source, the eight festivals will tune the jade name. Then one will avoid the nine calamities and see great peace.

---

### Western White Emperor

Jade phoenix thick with morning gusts, purple terraces shine over jade forests. Flowing light brushes the profound layers, towering beyond nine shadows. Purple radiance scatters red clouds, flying smoke searches and follows. Seven treasures shake jade branches, numinous beasts gallop cloud peaks. Ten thousand immortals ride the void chanting, divine winds raise wondrous sounds. Above is the high morning master, bowing quietly, howling and chanting. The eight assemblies naturally gather, void descends all as orchid and gold. Jade chews the endless kalpa dawn, jade wine scatters through the heart. Bright pearls sing numinous songs, dharma forms harmonize clear zithers. Jade chapters reach the Dao’s ancestor, joy and sorrow untie the human robe. Releasing me from endless lifespan, how deep the good joy. Without the high immortal’s charm, how can one share this drink? Morning plays in the Eastern Floral Palace, evening roams the Western Floral Hall. Taking pleasure in the two floral pavilions, never meeting joy itself. Only hearing the mysterious songster, sorrowful voices wound heavenly youths. Mournful sounds flow through the cold court, lamenting the world’s declining fate. Heavenly horses leap the nine rivers; the crow mother rides the flying dragon. The mysterious ford has no bridge; two qi separate and do not connect. Ascending my layered terrace, looking up amid the nine calamities. Foul qi fills the three spirits; myriad beings bear disaster’s clash. Eight domains have no survivors; mountains great and small collapse. Thinking of those who do not study, hearing scriptures as if deaf and dumb. Together they let fate arise; suddenly awaiting final command. Alas, how cruel the destined end; thinking of you wounds my breast.

---

### Northern Black Emperor

Purple phoenix rides the void, soaring over nine mysterious cliffs. Qi condenses and shadows appear; qi scatters and spirit vanishes. Floating boundlessly, heavenly music suits my delight. How to compare with the eight assemblies’ singing, matching my high immortal fields? Breaking the covenant of the ten heavenly truths, calming my nine phoenix drives. Ascending the Jade Capital’s palace gates above, playing in the Lang wind state below. Feathered riders swift on jade wheels, purple smoke supports in the void. Extreme dawn awaits the next morning, together rejoicing without end. Gazing freely, fate moves; one hundred million cycles make one revolution. Joy fills my natural robe, scattering my worldly worries. Without numinous spiritual essence, who can share this roaming? Alas, within the empty hollow, joy arises then sorrow returns. Morning ascends the Eastern Meng ridge; evening views the Western mound. No sight of the nine spirit mothers; the northern true Dao sought. Asking the vast image’s measure, two qi suddenly swirl around. Nine dragons move the eastern well; heavenly horses depart the western cliff. The Northern Emperor releases heavenly soldiers; five mountains’ mysteries align. Ten thousand demons are bound and girded; the Five Phases early conspire. War and disaster spread through heaven; myriad beings are restrained. Above and below all join the assembly, sweeping away falsehoods without delay. Alas, among the five calamities, fate comes with no kinship or favor. High ascending the eight assembly palace, gathering my dark fields. Observing the highest learners, blessed lands mutually support. Abandoning home to seek my Dao, able to cross and save your body. Diligently cultivating the supreme scripture, Dao attained will surely meet. Leisurely viewing the phoenix terrace—how joyful the roaming!

---

### Central Yellow Emperor

Great joy gathers the central origin, central origin assembles the joy court. Above are the eight assembly qi, dancing as purple phoenixes are born. Golden branches attach to jade roots, seven treasures form splendid bells. Dragons soar over extreme ridge peaks, phoenixes howl startling ten thousand li. No sight of wandering guests, only hearing wind and cloud sounds. Palace tones harmonize naturally, sounds and echoes complete themselves. Mysterious songs sing wondrous melodies; joy and sorrow form scriptures. I and myself seek each other—who knows the true spirit of the perfected one? Brocade clouds belt the night moon, purple radiance veils flying jade. Three mornings penetrate the great light, seven primordials shine the five stars. Spirit banners have awe-inspiring light, flowing smoke envelops purple clarity. Claiming the Western Floral’s wonder, not as good as the purple phoenix city. Above is the one who loosens the robe, one face rejoicing for ten thousand lifespans. Together rejoicing without end kalpa, thus sensing Heaven and Earth’s tilt. Spirit movement has its order; numbers end and freely return to mystery. Coming and going follow the cycle; why let sorrow entangle life? Scattering sorrow beyond the eight wildernesses, the great image is not crooked truth. Leisurely joy in the court—who is kin to sorrow? The five calamities are a regular assembly; those harmed have their own. Palace tones may not harmonize, but reason returns to balance. Thus arise the joy and sorrow melodies, to help those learning the Dao body. If one studies the numinous script, wondrous meanings will naturally appear. But only wearing the Qu Su badge can one enter the worry-free ford. Riding the void to ascend the phoenix terrace, high observatory inheriting Tang years. What joy could surpass this? Knowing sorrow lies where?

---

The Most High Jade Morning Qu Su words of joy and sorrow arise above the void-born phoenix terrace, numinous and bright in the five directions, golden sounds drifting clearly through the ten heavens. The Jade Capital’s nine-curved upper truths are all cast in gold slips, written with purple brush, voices united in singing the mysterious song of joy and sorrow. Their words are profound and subtle, wondrous and penetrating the abyss. None but the Most High’s peers can fathom their chapters. Only those with the golden name Eastern Floral, writing phoenix palace characters, may see this text.

Those who wear the phoenix qi Mysterious Hill true writing and command magic spirit banners, reciting the words of joy and sorrow, have the Five Emperors guarding the truth, heavenly demons instructing protection, safeguarding the upper immortals, receiving and welcoming the holy lord in the Supreme Clarity palace, roaming the halls of the phoenix terrace.

After receiving, no disrespect or defilement of the Dao truth; lightly revealing heavenly texts for others to see or hear causes the Seven Mysterious Parents to close the hells forever; one’s self suffers ten pains and eight calamities, utterly unable to become immortal. Be cautious and uphold faithfully.
