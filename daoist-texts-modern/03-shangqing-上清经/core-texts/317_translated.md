### Scripture of the Supreme Clarity Yellow Qi Yang Essence’s Threefold Sequential Path

The Sovereign of the Southern Pole, the Primordial Lord, declared:  
“I have received the essential teachings of the Most High’s threefold sequential path, the way of Yellow Qi and Yang Essence. I wear and command the numinous radiance, sip the imperial flowers by mouth, gaze upward to feast on the flying roots, preserve the Seven Luminaries within the Purple Radiance, traverse the threefold path through the Golden Gate, explore the vastness and narrowness within the Abyssal Radiance, discern the roundness and square of sun and moon, behold the vermilion steps at the Cave of Yang, enter to refine the intestines at the Vast Cold, ascend the Seven Treasures in the Mysterious Garden, climb the flying ladder at the Spirit Pass, return the yang essence at the Floating Dawn, gather the Yellow Qi at the Dense Single, lean beside the golden wings on the tall tree, pass the stone scene reflecting the visage, cultivate and command the numinous chart, thereby evoking the true spirits. Thus the threefold radiance casts its light, the seven essences wing the pavilion, the five spirits intertwine their bands, the four offices bind the chapters, the Western Tortoise fixes the records, the title inscribed at high dawn. Therefore, my position is to ascend as the Sovereign of the Southern Pole, the Primordial Lord.

This Way is profoundly subtle, not for the narrow learning of common men to discuss. Now, gathering what has been received, I roughly recount the Most High Jade Emperor’s curved words, to mark the mysterious and natural numinous script, entrusted to the Prime Minister Azure Youth Sovereign, who oversees the recording of the Mysterious Palace. After myriad kalpas, it shall be granted to those who hold the mysterious records, white slips, and azure registers. Such numinous books and purple texts, along with the Eight Elemental True Scriptures, the Purple Haze Inner Observation of the Sun’s Radiance and the Profound, each speaks of their respective rites, valuing only the wearing and commanding, yet cannot encompass the great root source, the vast and expansive diffusion. It may be said they grasp the branches but not the root, attain the Way but not its origin. Therefore, one should widely seek and must harmonize above and below, cultivate from beginning to end, complete the Way and fill the qi — then nothing will fail to become immortal.

The sun extends broadly two thousand and forty li, the golden division of water essence glows within, flowing light shines without. Within are cities and towns, people, seven-treasure bathing pools, growing four kinds of lotus flowers—blue, red, yellow, and white. People stand two zhang and four chi tall, wear vermilion garments, flourishing and fading with the four flowers, thus the four seasons—spring, autumn, winter, summer—proceed accordingly. The sun’s course is accompanied by five winds: the first is the time wind, the second the path wind, the third the assisting wind, the fourth the revolving door wind, the fifth the traveling wind. Therefore, the regulation and command of sun, moon, stars, and constellations, roaming the void qi, never rest; all are the Brahmanical threads of wind.

The waxing and waning of sun and moon’s motion are all the meeting of the four seasons, concealed and hidden by the crown and belt. Above the Golden Gate, the sun’s course is bright and clear. Within the Golden Gate is a pool of golden essence refining, located at the Western Pass, the division of Yani. On the day of the Beginning of Spring, the soul is refined within the Golden Gate, its radiance shining beyond the gate. At this time, the light is soft and fresh, the universal qi warm; this occurs once in the year, lasting forty-five days before ceasing. Each month repeats this five times, performing minor refinement of the eight-pointed star above the Golden Gate, as detailed in the Eight Elemental Scriptures.

The path proceeds to the Cave of Yang Palace. Above the Cave of Yang Sun is the upper hall, also named Li Luo, in the division of Floating Dawn. On the day of the Beginning of Summer, golden refining essence is emitted at the Cave of Yang Palace, irrigating the palace, further refining the eight-pointed star in the Court of Flowing Fire. At this time, the sun’s light is dim and strong, yang qi overflows and disperses, the universal sky is in great heat; this occurs once in the year, lasting forty-five days before ceasing.

The path proceeds to the top of the Eastern Well. The Eastern Well is the moon’s path of illumination, in the division of Lu. On the day of the Beginning of Autumn, the moon bathes within the Eastern Well in the halo of light, gathering the qi of the Eight Elements, returning to the Vast Cold Palace. At this time, the heavenly scene is high and clear, the universal qi cool; this occurs once in the year, lasting forty-five days before ceasing.

The path proceeds to the Vast Cold Palace. The Vast Cold Palace is the moon palace’s upper hall, the canopy of the Seven Stars, in the realm of the Dense Single. On the day of the Beginning of Winter, the sun’s essence hides in the Vast Cold Palace, further crowning and nurturing the fetus. At this time, the sun’s scene is shadowed, the universal sky cold; this occurs once in the year, lasting forty-five days before ceasing.

The sun’s yearly circuit crowns and belts the four regions, totaling one hundred and eighty days. The divisions passed on these days, the remaining one hundred and eighty days belong to the moon’s circuit. The two radiances separate and join, yin and yang wax and wane, each with limits to their degrees.

Within the Golden Gate stands the towering Gaoqian Tree, four thousand li tall, its branches extending two thousand li, encircling two hundred and eighty li, its roots deep eight hundred and forty li. Above it is the golden-winged crow, its wings spanning the realm; below lies the Court of Flowing Fire, eighty thousand li broad. Within are the fiery light and eightfold refinement of the natural mysterious elixir. The supreme true immortals all, on the day of the Beginning of Summer, assemble at the Court of Fire to refine the mysterious elixir and receive the fresh communion of myriad spirits.

All later disciples who attain immortality must pass through the Cave of Yang Palace, receive the eightfold refinement, and ascend to heaven. After refinement, they gain the food of the empty blue flower; the golden-winged crows weave feather garments as flying immortal robes, bestowed upon those refined, to ascend the Jade Capital’s Nine Phoenix Terrace.

All advanced practitioners wear the dao of sun and moon, and on the day of the Beginning of Summer’s zenith, take eight parts of true pearl, along with the eightfold refined elixir fetus jade talisman on yellow paper, cast into clear water facing south to bathe by the urn, knock teeth twenty-four times, utter subtle incantations like those of the Beginning of Spring. Then draw qi with eight swallows, return indoors to burn incense, refine the elixir and purple powder, enclose all powders to anoint the body, rub hands until warm, wipe face and entire body, lie facing south, knock teeth nine times, close eyes and grasp firmly, think of the sun’s light and purple qi piling up, descending to crown one’s body, imagine oneself inside the sun’s radiance, the sun’s radiance returning to one’s body, ascending to the Cave of Yang Palace, in the empty blue forest, Court of Flowing Fire, think of the Southern Pole Cave of Yang True Man, named Rongzhu, eight cun tall, wearing crimson embroidered single garment, head crowned with the sun essence’s yang-penetrating crown, mouth exhaling red qi blazing like fire, burning the body. In a moment, pluck a flower from the blue forest to eat; the flower tastes sweet, the body feels warm all around, swallow qi eighty times then stop, softly chant:

> The sun’s radiance shines upon the net,  
> Embroidered with mysterious recesses,  
> Flowing fire vast and bright,  
> Ten thousand streams raise waves,

> Purple jade vermilion clouds,  
> Qi like the jade true,  
> Fate aligned with numinous branches,  
> Long feasting in the nine mysteries,  
> The path without tilt or crag.

After the incantation, wear the eightfold refined elixir fetus jade talisman, swallow qi eighty times, swallow saliva thirty-six times then stop.

> Flowing fire ten thousand zhang,  
> Receiving refinement of the jade fetus,  
> Soul peaceful, spirit joyful,  
> Myriad gods joyous,  
> Extreme sun, eternal moon,  
> Three lights in harmony.

After the incantation, lie down. Practice this for eight years, then one will enter fire without burning, the face glowing vermilion, able to speak with Rongzhu’s visage, descend the vermilion clouds, and ascend Supreme Clarity.

Within the Eastern Well lies the Hall of Vast Spirit, where grows the triple-flowered tall ring tree, four thousand zhang tall, branches extending two thousand li, encircling two hundred and forty li. Once per kalpa, it bears the natural triple qi flower, resembling the radiance of a lotus. Eating one flower grants a lifespan equal to one kalpa. Above it is the golden-winged crow, its wings spreading around the realm. Below is the spring of blue mushroom jade ointment, named Eastern Well, nine ten-thousand zhang deep, nine thousand li broad, the spring eaten by the Spirit King of the Sunny Valley. The supreme immortals and myriad emperors all, on the day of the Beginning of Autumn, assemble at the Hall of Vast Spirit and Eastern Well spring, bathe and refine themselves, receiving the fresh communion of true spirits.

All who again study the Way and succeed, as well as the seven patriarchs of scholars ascending to heaven, none do not pass through the Eastern Well to bathe, refine in the jade ointment spring, and ascend to heaven. After refinement, they gain the food of the triple qi flower; the golden-winged crows weave feather garments as flying immortal robes, bestowed upon those refined, to ascend the Eastern Splendor Azure Palace.

Within the Vast Cold Palace grows the blue flower forest, four thousand zhang tall, branches extending one thousand two hundred li, encircling two hundred and forty li. Its leaves resemble bamboo but are red; its flowers resemble mirrors and shine bright; its fruit resembles plums but without pits, called the Crimson Tree’s Red Fruit. Eating its leaves grants ten thousand years of life; eating its flowers watches the sun and serves the spirit; eating its fruit roams and feasts in Jade Clarity. Above is the golden-winged crow, its wings spreading around the realm. Below is the Vast Cold Pool, where naturally grows the ninefold refined great spring, five ten-thousand li deep, five thousand li broad. The supreme true emperors and high immortals all, on the day of the Beginning of Winter, ascend the Vast Cold Palace, gather blue flowers to brush themselves, approach the Vast Cold Pool, irrigate the great spring to refine the truth.

The heavenly numbers and cloud scriptures number three thousand six hundred and some degrees; then yang qi declines, yin qi rises, the crossing of one hundred and six, myriad disasters sweep the world, heaven’s divisions alter their courses. Practitioners should follow the sun’s motion, take the yang essence, thus avoiding the disasters of one hundred and six.

The moon extends broadly one thousand nine hundred li, its halo encircles seven thousand eight hundred and forty li, white silver lapis lazuli water essence glows within, divided into sixty parts, fiery light shines without. Within are cities and towns, also seven-treasure bathing pools, eight tall forests growing within. The moon people stand one zhang six chi tall, all wear azure garments.

Those who wear this character live ten thousand years. Applying the dao of sun and moon, there are dozens of methods, but this sound is not to be circulated lightly. To leak it lightly is to appear in the world bearing the wind knife’s trial, the seven ancestors charge with infinite ghost penalties, three paths and five sufferings, ten thousand kalpas without remission.

Those who seek the Way of Immortality should, on the night of the Summer Solstice, enter a chamber facing south, lie or sit at will, close eyes, inwardly think of the Moon’s Vermilion Light Lady, surname [redacted], named [redacted], eight cun eight fen tall, hair arranged in drooping cloud bun, wearing vermilion embroidered flying skirt, mouth holding moonlight, descending into the destined body’s crimson palace. In a moment, the moonlight disperses into yellow qi, enveloping the form, the lady in the moon’s center, gathering empty blue flowers, scattering and brushing the yellow qi. The lady exhales yang essence, yang essence red, irrigating the destined form, from inside to outside, the yellow and red two qi entwine and envelop the whole body. The lady grants the destined six tones of the purple script elixir characters, then draws yellow qi twenty-four swallows, draws yang essence twelve swallows then stops, knocks teeth twenty-four times, raises a prayer:

> Flowing fire ten thousand acres,  
> Essence of Cave of Yang,  
> Yang peace palace,  
> Three flowers jade city,  
> Golden immortals reflected within,  
> Eight elements four brightnesses,  
> Nine luminaries descend qi,  
> Primordial highest spirit,  
> Lady exhales incense,  
> Scatters flowers jade clarity,  
> Elixir script purple characters,  
> Binding sound empty blue,  
> Orchid pool jade moist,  
> Flowing over eight darknesses,  
> Vermilion light veils universal,  
> Heavenly immortals fresh and flourishing,  
> Returning morning curved radiance,  
> Reflecting and watching my form,  
> Attain with vermilion moon,  
> Share death and life,  
> Ride the void,  
> Drive the void carriage,  
> Jade maidens wing position,  
> Golden youths assist spirit,  
> Emerald feathers light canopy,  
> Ascend to emperor’s court.

After the incantation, swallow qi twenty-four times, swallow saliva twenty times then stop, wear the purple script elixir characters. Practice this Way for eight years, the lady grants the destined elixir script true text, moon jade pendant, now the destined flies and ascends to the Cave of Yang Palace.

The right purple script elixir characters, moon soul hidden sounds, all inscribed on the empty blue forest in the southern moon realm, are the natural script. The Eight Elements true immortals and heavenly beings all, on the day of the Summer Solstice, gather the purple script elixir characters and wear them. Those who wear these six characters share years with the Eight Elements, then the nape bears round brightness, illuminating the Ten Directions. The method is extremely secret, the supreme emperor and Eight Elements true immortals inscribed this sound within the Eight Elements jade seal chapter, thus it is the Most High’s wondrous scripture. Lightly leaking the numinous sound brings seven ancestors’ charge, long death by knife mountain, body death by wind knife, never attaining immortality.

On the night of the Summer Solstice, write cinnabar on white paper and wear it, knock teeth twelve times, softly chant:

> Yang essence elixir pool,  
> Flowing fire dense gale,  
> Golden pavilion wings void,  
> Mysterious radiance brushes sky,  
> Eight elements gather orchid,  
> Scatter incense jade morning,  
> Blue forest hanging willows,  
> Wind shakes jade branches,  
> Elixir script purple text,  
> Containing elegant flourishing,  
> Flowing fragrance irrigates nectar,  
> Universal moist without limit,  
> Attain with mysterious radiance,  
> Equal light purple sky.

After the incantation, swallow qi twenty-four times then stop. Also write elixir characters in purple, wear on the head for three years, sun and moon mysterious radiance illuminates the destined form, moonlight lady grants the destined true scripture, gives six jade maidens. Light transmission is false, seven ancestors charge penalties, ten thousand kalpas no remission. Secret cultivation for eight years, then the cloud carriage descends, broad daylight ascends heaven, flying through Jade Clarity.

The right moon’s circuit flows through the four regions, thus sharing the new and full moon periods with the sun. The sun’s dao is yang, the moon’s dao is yin; though moving together, in the crown and belt they each occupy four seasons. Thus the sun divides one hundred and eighty days yang, the moon divides one hundred and eighty days yin, numbers passing three thousand six hundred and some degrees, combining with the sun, then yang qi rises, yin qi declines, the sun’s nine numbers’ motion changes heaven and earth’s lodgings, myriad diseases dissipate, evil is destroyed and misfortune removed. Those who do not understand heaven and earth’s motion cannot avoid the disasters of yang nine.

Among all those who accumulate learning, few sit to receive the dragon carriage and ascend the cloud palace. They labor in cliffs and caves, swallow saliva, wear and command sun and moon, yet do not know the division of mysterious radiance, the vast and narrow cities and towns, seven-treasure vermilion forests, motion and lodgings of the four regions, periods of waxing and waning, flying roots unattainable, imperial flowers unharvested, yang essence thus not descending, yin essence thus not reflecting, the dao of sun and moon is distant to behold. If one can diligently seek its root, know the motion and scene, cities and hills, vermilion forests and abyssal pools, the moon lady’s surname and name, then the sun and moon will respond and descend, no need for vexing distant seeking, naturally one will ride the cloud carriage and flying wheel, ascend the gates of sun and moon.

The purple script elixir characters are bound to the Eight Elements’ natural qi, high mysterious feathered banners, born in the moon’s eight tall forests, the characters shining purple light, glowing in the moonlight’s brightness. The Eight Elements true immortals and all heavens gather the purple script elixir characters from the eight tall forests and wear them, scattering incense to brush the sun and moon’s light. This sound fully expresses the Great Dongzhen Scripture, thus called the Most High’s script. Those who wear this character have golden countenance, nape bearing round brightness, sun and moon cave reflecting, without study become immortal. The method is very weighty, secret of the Most High, not to be lightly leaked. According to the rules, within seven hundred years, if there is a golden name Donghua, purple character Supreme Clarity, combined true person, they may hear three transmissions. Without this bone, secret in the jade pass, ten thousand kalpas not revealed.

The right eightfold refined golden smelting transformation immortal true talisman, on the day of the Beginning of Spring, yellow script on blue paper, cast into water to bathe, the whole body is refined and transformed, summoning the sun and moon’s mysterious radiance, descending true immortals to the jade court. Also yellow script on blue silk, worn for eight years, communicating with true immortals, descending cloud carriage, flying and ascending above the Golden Gate, receiving refinement in the golden smelting pool.

Also cinnabar script on yellow silk, worn for eight years, true immortals descend, grant destined true text, flying through the void mysterious, ascending the Cave of Yang Palace.

The right dragon’s radiance ninefold refined talisman, on the day of the Beginning of Autumn at dusk, azure script on white paper, cast into water to bathe, bone marrow refines and transforms, summoning mysterious radiance in purple scene, bringing yang essence to flying roots, receiving yellow qi in water mother, descending true immortals in purple pavilion. Also azure script on white silk, worn for eight years, head bears sun round brightness, flying through the Supreme Palace, ascending the Hall of Vast Spirit.

The right sun soul refining yin talisman, on the day of the Beginning of Winter at midnight, ink script on blue paper, cast into water to bathe, blood essence throughout the body is refined and transformed, bringing sun essence to purple scene, descending flying flowers in eight tall forests, refining five organs in jade pool, moving destined body in Vast Cold. Also ink script on blue silk, worn for eight years, body emits golden light, nape bears round brightness, true immortals descend, grant destined true text, flying through great void, ascending the Vast Cold Palace.

The Seven Stars are forty thousand li from the earth, encircling seven hundred and twenty li, all made of golden essence lapis lazuli for their cities and towns, the Seven Luminaries’ purple radiance brands their light. Within are the myriad heavenly beings’ true palaces and pavilions; the Vast Cold is their canopy. One day and night, they revolve once around the heavens, like the wheels of sun and moon. Within also grow seven-treasure vermilion forests. Thus after human determination, at the beginning of life, the Seven Stars are refined in the Vast Cold Palace, bright and fresh purple scene in the Seven Luminaries’ radiance. At this time, the Seven Luminaries shine and fall, flowing essence fills the heavens, purple scene emits nectar to irrigate the heavens. Then all true emperors and immortals at this time without exception gather the Seven Luminaries’ radiance and purple scene’s orchids.

All advanced practitioners wearing the dao of sun and moon should cultivate the wondrous method of the Seven Luminaries. After human determination, in a separate chamber, burn incense, lie facing north, calm body and mind, abandon strange thoughts, focus on the spirit, knock teeth twenty-four times, hold in mind the seven stars shining brightly in the north, lay oneself beneath the Seven Stars’ Dipper canopy, the Seven Luminaries’ light flowing and shining beyond the purple scene, crowning and covering oneself, oneself above the purple scene among the Seven Luminaries, inside and outside dense darkness, seeing nothing. After a long time, the light of the Seven Luminaries clears, transforming into seven boys, each on one star. The first boy named Shuming, second named Yaoling, third named Beiyuan, fourth named Baojing, fifth named Danying, sixth named Xuqing, seventh named Ziying. The seven boys emit seven treasures’ light to nourish and feed the destined body. Shuming boy emits purple scene light, Yaoling boy emits golden essence light, Beiyuan boy emits lapis lazuli light, Baojing boy emits silver light, Danying boy emits jade essence light, Xuqing boy emits precious pearl light, Ziying boy emits coral light. The seven treasures’ light all enter the destined body, then draw qi with forty-nine swallows, softly chant:

> Golden essence condenses and transforms,  
> Binding primordial seven spirits,  
> Purple radiance shines and falls,  
> Vermilion scene clear and bright,  
> Canopy lingers,  
> Wheels turn cold court,  
> Treasure light dazzling,  
> Seven leaps sparkling,  
> Mysterious radiance emits orchids,  
> Fragrant mushrooms flow full,  
> Evening rests in numinous palace,  
> Morning ascends Jade Clarity,  
> Celestial navigation path,  
> Purple scene wings form,  
> Banquet reins cloud wheels,  
> Driving flying carriage,  
> Roaming the eight extremes,  
> Threefold path merges.

After the incantation, swallow saliva seven times then stop, rise and anoint the body with millet flour, lie down enveloped. Thus for seven years, the body produces seven treasures’ light, the head bears purple scene canopy, always crowning the destined form, able to summon and ascend with the seven jade youths, command flying clouds and mysterious carriage, come to greet the destined body, ascending the Northern Star. This Way is secret and wondrous, practiced by the supreme true immortals, not circulated in the world. If one carves the mysterious name on slips before birth, records the azure register jade text, one shall obtain this Way. Those who obtain it can become supreme immortals, teachers and ancestors of myriad immortals. Light leakage brings blindness punishment, seven ancestors charge penalties of knife mountain and fire eating, three paths and ten thousand kalpas no remission. Scholars must be clear and cautious, the essence of the four extremes, deeply treasured here. These seven boys are the inner essences of the seven treasures, transformed into the Seven Luminaries’ highest truths. Knowing their names means no death; practicing their methods means immortality; leaking their secret means blindness. Morning and evening remembrance constantly guards the destined body. If disaster or distress arises, knock teeth seven times, call the seven boys’ names, disaster will vanish. This Way is truly to be known alone, holding pearls and jade, how could it be placed in dust and dirt? Be clear and cautious to keep it secret.

The Most High commands the Four Offices, Five Emperors, and all heavenly kings to dispatch true overseers and immortals, constantly treading the Five Mountains and famous peaks. In the world are the essentials of the threefold path, the method of Yellow Qi and Yang Essence, the characters of elixir script and purple text, then one’s name is listed in the Eastern Splendor, memorials sent to the Golden Palace, with seven jade youths and seven jade maidens guarding those with scriptures. If one lightly leaks numinous sounds, neglects precious texts, the jade youths report it, punished by the Five Emperors’ divine soldiers, dying and serving in the three paths and five sufferings, seven ancestors charge penalties, ten thousand kalpas no remission.

To cultivate the essentials of the threefold path, one should on the third, fifteenth, and twenty-fifth day of the moon, each month three times receive the sun and moon’s light, at midnight then face the Seven Stars’ essence, bow twice with heart and mind, wishing to ascend the three lights’ radiance, wear and command the numinous radiance’s form. Thus for seven years, the sun and moon respond and descend, granting the child the true Way of spirit.

If one has a golden name and jade character, listed and memorialized in the mysterious chart, one should follow the master’s fasting and retreat for ninety days, or twenty-seven days, or three days; disciples bring seven taels of superior gold, forty chi of yellow patterned cloth, thirty-two chi of blue silk, declare the covenant and transmit. Without covenant, lightly leaking causes the master to be judged and lose body, disciples lightly peeking at heavenly truth lose covenant and suffer punishment, seven ancestors incur guilt, three captures no remission. The heavenly patterns are wondrous and weighty, purple script elixir characters are very secret, thus entrusted with covenant and treasure, not lightly transmitted. Scholars judged by this must be clear and cautious. Such numinous scriptures arise within the great void, written upon the mysterious garden, beneath piled stones, wrapped in golden halls and jade chambers. The numinous script shines brilliantly, purple characters dense in the sky, spirit youths wing spirits, jade maidens scatter incense, each three thousand guarding true spirits. The Southern Pole Primordial Lord received it from the Most High, cast the covenant into the great void, transmitting to the Supreme Micro Heavenly Emperor, who transmitted to the Western Tortoise Queen Mother, who transmitted to the Golden Palace Emperor, who entrusted it to the Prime Minister Azure Youth Sovereign, to grant later disciples who become true immortals. Now one copy is sealed at Western City Mountain.

All who study immortality without cultivating this Way merely labor to evoke truth, only able to become lower immortals, not deathless. Hoping to pierce the heavenly gates and ascend the Golden Palace is forever impossible. Having worn the threefold path, cultivated the eightfold refinement, even if one cannot soar in broad daylight, on the day of hidden transformation one naturally changes, ascends the Golden Gate’s four regions’ palace, further refined in the jade pool, granted golden-winged feather robes, ascending the Golden Palace’s palace. Therefore, this method is profound and wondrous, not comparable to common scriptures; those who obtain its text become immortal without study. The Central Emperor Immortal, Mysterious Master Sheng, Mo Di Master, Zhao Yanfu, Ning Kangbo, Peng Jian, An Qi, and the seven hundred disciples of Bo Gao all sought the Way through hardship, their hearts pierced the jade void, though soaring to sky cliffs, roaming the Five Mountains, none attained the essentials of the threefold path, thus could not ascend within the Golden Gate, receive the Golden Palace’s audience. Now by swift body and cloud void, they are reinsmen of Jade Clarity, directing and welcoming the supreme true immortals. How different from those who begin study with diligence in the world, hoping to ascend the cloud palace’s roaming?

Like Su Zilin, Gu Xizi, Youyang Jun, Wang Qiao, Chi Song, Huang Ren, Qing Zhen and their disciples, beginning study immediately cultivating the essentials of the threefold path, the method of Yellow Qi, Yang Essence, elixir script, and purple characters, they immediately transcend the Three Pure Ones, ascend the Azure Splendor Palace, further receive the supreme wondrous scripture, visit the Golden Palace to receive titles, rank among the Jade Clarity supreme true immortals of the Four Extremes. Is this not different from those with mere ambition? Lord Wang transmitted the scripture to the Southern Mountain Lady; now it is sealed in the Southern Cave’s Chamber of the Sun Bath Palace. Those with aspiration should diligently seek its text.
