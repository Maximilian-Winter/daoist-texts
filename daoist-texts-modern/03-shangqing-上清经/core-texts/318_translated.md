### The Golden True Jade Radiance Supreme Hidden Scripture

The Elder of the Nine Heavens received from the Primordial Heavenly King the Golden True Jade Radiance of the Spirit Capital in the Great Void, naming it the Scripture of the Eight Scenes Flying. The Broadly Manifested Supreme True named it the Scripture of the Eight Primal Excellences. The Azure True Little Child called it the Seven Primal Disclosures. The Supreme Dao Lord called it the Hidden Scripture Jade Secret. The Golden Seal issued from before the Nine Mysteries; its upper chapters name the four seasons. Its dao is lofty and wondrous, the honored master of myriad truths, commanding ten thousand immortals, with numinous talismans flowing and shining, illuminating the Purple Morning, secreted above the Nine Heavens in the Palace of Great Abundance, the Golden Radiance Purple Hall, the Jade Treasures and Jade Chambers.

Casting gold into slips to compose the spiritual text, carving jade elixir scripts to clarify the chapters, the radiance streams brilliantly, shining through the Great Void, sun and moon accompany, five dawns wing the spirits. The daughters of Golden Splendor and boys of Jade Morning, three thousand each, attend and guard the jade writings; the jade consorts manage incense; the numinous winds raise smoke; mighty dragons and venomous beasts stand guard at the jade gates; the jade phoenix strokes its wings; the divine luan shadows the mystery; all the truths feast and perform rites; myriad saints pay homage before the jade steps; jade platforms gallop through the celestial court; the Supreme Emperor humbles himself before the desk; the Jade Emperor recalibrates the cycles and propels the turning; the celestial pivot commands the dipper to revolve the spirits; the divine lands sing in harmony; the seven transformations dance the heavens; traversing the three and five in divine transformation; scattering tracks and measures through the Nine Mysteries; steering the Five Phases to summon souls; commanding the disclosures to awe the numinous; ordering the Eight Scenes to ascend the sky; subduing the heavenly demons within the Golden True; unveiling the Hidden Scripture in the silent chamber; chanting wondrous chapters in the seamless void; governing myriad emperors at the highest heights; commanding all below in the realm of life.

At that time, the beginning of the established qi, the Elder of the Nine Heavens sat to command the Spirit Capital, carrying the covenant of the Jade Immortals, the Five Elders Supreme True, thirty-nine emperors, the Former Sovereign, the Primordial Dao Lord, the Great Sage God, the Supreme Dao Lord, the Emperor of Fusang, the Spirit King of the Sunny Valley, the Supreme Origin of the Southern Pole, the Three Primal Lords of Purple Essence, the Queen Mother of the Western Turtle, the Three Primal Lords of Supreme Origin, the Lady of Supreme Truth. Ascending the highest highest highest Purple Jade Palace, the Jade Treasure Terrace, the Seven Reflections Vermilion Chamber, issuing edicts to the Five Emperors and the Four Directions’ officials, the Spirit Capital’s divine soldiers, assisting and guarding the Supreme Origin.

Commanding the Supreme Immortal Taihe Jade Maiden to issue the Golden True talisman to summon spirits and subdue demons, placing them at the five directions. The Four Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate recite the Great Void chapters, wondrously chanting, clear and penetrating; the Eight Scenes all true, the Jade Radiance shining through the skies; the disclosures reveal the mysteries; the three dawns pause their light; the eight winds circle their banners; the numinous drum covers the clouds; the nine qi illuminate the spirits; the three and five wings praise; the six and six harmonize; luxuriant and profound above the profound, radiant and flourishing in the Great Darkness; flying fragrance encircles the sun; streaming lightning excites the essence; splendid light intermingles and sprinkles; divine candles merge in brightness; flowing through a thousand kalpas, attaining wondrous forgetfulness of rotation.

Then the Elder of the Nine Heavens appeared upon the Mysterious Platform, commanding the Left Immortal Attendant Li Yufei and the Spirit Supervisor Deng Yuansheng, holding the nine-colored banner, the jade script imperial seal, to announce the covenant to the Four Bright Ones, to entrust all the truths. The Supreme Dao Lord’s Scripture of the Eight Scenes Flying, Golden True Jade Radiance, Seven Primal Disclosures, ranks highest, roaming the Jade Clarity, with Golden Immortals assisting and supporting, the Five Emperors guarding the spirits, issuing commands in full, cloud chariots galloping, flying dragons arrayed, dragons soaring to the sky’s edge; in a blink, a hundred million immortals gather, jade wheels and emerald carriages, flowing essence luxuriant; all blow clouds and sing, phoenix cries and luan strides, smoke intertwines and collects, lingering in the profound great, rustling beyond the Great Glow, roaming beyond boundlessness, each returning to the Jade Void’s pavilion, disclosed like the movement of numinous winds.

The Supreme Dao Lord then returned to ascend the lofty layered terrace, the nine-curved chamber, inviting the Later Sage Nine Mysteries Golden Gate Emperor Lords and Prime Minister Qingjun, to fast and purify for three months, to receive the covenant according to the two lords, each sealing one transmission in the Golden Gate Upper Palace and the various Azure Palaces. At the great kalpa’s cycle, the three dao wax and wane, the two qi separate and unite, the principle of things has its time; in the Tang era, Yang Jiu unleashed calamities, cutting off evil and uproar, searching and gathering the highest sages.

In this year, if one cultivates the Great Cavern’s true scripture, the subtle gate of essence and unity, applying the eight dao to summon the void, refining golden splendor in the three origins, chanting the pure spirit in the silent chamber, steering the Five Phases to summon souls, wearing the golden tiger talisman, moving the seven stars at the heavenly gate, mastering the mysterious names in the imperial chart, establishing the Azure Register in Shangqing, nurturing jade elegance to bind the network, containing the jade embryo within the inner spirit, severing the world’s attachments to grow long and abundant, guarding solitude in nature — one may receive the profound transmission of the Eight Scenes, announce the wondrous secret of the Golden True, apply the summoning of spirits in the curved chamber, place the disclosures to command the gods, draw out the seven ancestors in the hidden palace, escape the five sufferings on the knife mountain, avoid the eight hardships in the fiery village, extinguish the burden stones at the root of habit.

Whoever obtains this text transcends the Nine Mysteries, freely traces flying shadows, clearly beholds the Three Pure Ones. Yet none possess it; through countless kalpas it is not transmitted.

The *Golden True Jade Radiance Scripture of the Eight Scenes Flying* was born above the Nine Heavens, before any scene, its mysterious light streaming, as if neither existing nor not, suspended essence thick and luxuriant, illuminating the jade palace, accumulated over seven thousand kalpas. Its text is very clear, gazing above the void and mystery, in the midst of the Great Emptiness, viewing it is unfathomable, destroying it is impossible; radiant and brilliant, shining through the ten heavens.

Thus the Elder of the Nine Heavens, in the first year of the Beginning Establishment, in the eastern direction, on an auspicious day of the Heavenly Stem Jia, purified and fasted at the Great Void’s Seven Treasures Jade Terrace, swore an oath to Heaven to receive the spiritual chapters, summon spirits, subdue demons, and disclose the seven primal secrets. The mysterious chapters once measured, yet have no master or lineage, unknown whence suddenly they arose.

The text’s practice reveals the eight scenes taking form, illuminating the jade chamber, summoning myriad truths; at that time, the imperial command was issued, all immortals without exception came to court, performing bows and prostrations, feasting upon the jade scripture. This is the imperial trust of the Nine Heavens, the majestic decree of the Jade Emperor, left assistant holding the staff of the Immortal Capital, right attendant jade youth, five directions’ spirit officials numbering a billion, managing and guarding the precious text, organizing and assisting those who wear it.

Following the Supreme Ultimate Four Bright Ones, transmitted once in ten thousand kalpas, secreted above the Nine Heavens in the Palace of Great Abundance, Golden Radiance Purple Hall, Jade Treasure and Jade Chamber, spreading flying gauze natural curtains, jade desks and golden beds, jade morning boys holding incense on the left, golden splendor daughters scattering smoke on the right, the Supreme Consort attending in front, jade immortals assisting behind, mysterious clouds and purple canopies shading the hall, all the true immortals and highest sages ascend thrice a month to perform rites.

Thus the precious secret methods are announced, the three and five alter the cycles, the great kalpa turns, within seven hundred years this will be practiced in the world. If one has the mysterious imperial tablet, jade characters of purple clarity, golden treasury and jade bones united in truth, they may hear the covenant transmission. Lightly revealing the imperial treasure, the seven ancestors, parents, and the destined body are examined by the Three Officials, filling the knife mountain hell, among the three disciples, never to be restored through ten thousand kalpas; those who receive must be cautious.

The Primordial Heavenly King opened it above the Void and Mystery to transmit to the Elder of the Nine Heavens, Supreme True Supreme Dao Lord, Azure True Little Child, Five Elders Supreme True, thirty-nine emperors, Former Sovereign, Primordial Dao Lord, Supreme Origin of the South Pole, Three Primal Lords of Purple Essence, Queen Mother of the Western Turtle, Three Primal Lords of Supreme Origin, Lady of Supreme Truth. The Former Sovereign transmitted to the Purple Clarity Emperor Lord; the Primordial Dao Lord to the Yellow Stone Master and the Three Heavens Jade Children; the Supreme Dao Lord to the Eastern Sea Little Child, Lady of Purple Tenuity, Later Sage Nine Mysteries Golden Gate Emperor Lord; the Emperor Lord entrusted to Prime Minister Qing Tongjun, Supreme Ultimate Four Bright Ones, Western City King Lord. Such precious secrets are all orally transmitted by the highest truths; the Prime Minister Emperor Lord carefully collates, compiles, and implements the blessings, laws, and regulations, successively gathering into a precious scroll, now sealed in a stone chamber on Wangwu Mountain.

If one is diligent and lofty in aspiration, abandoning worldly glory, ascending the Spirit Mountain, refining with earnest meditation, named the Master of the Azure Palace, they shall obtain this text; the Emperor Lord will dispatch a Perfected to mysteriously transmit to the destined body. Once the destined obtains this text, the Five Emperors guard the chamber, summon spirits, subdue demons, govern essence, and command gods; cultivating the dao and reciting scripture, responding above the Nine Heavens, no longer facing trials or defeat. According to the method of application, the Perfected descends and speaks with the destined; within seven years, they ride the void and walk the heavens; within nine years, essence responds; by day they ascend the dawn. The highest dao is not transmitted to the untrue.

Whoever obtains the *Golden True Jade Radiance Scripture of the Eight Scenes Flying* body, all are mysteriously responsive and destined to become immortals; each burns incense in a separate chamber, worships morning and evening, heart holding the divine true jade radiance purple qi, filling the purification hall; reverently bows and venerates as if eyes meet deity. The Emperor dispatches twenty-four golden splendor daughters and twenty-four jade morning boys to attend and guard the destined body, rewarding merit and punishing faults, distinguishing good and evil. Also, there are left and right officials of water and fire, inspecting leaks and violations; those who break rules are punished with the wind blade’s trial, offenses connecting to the seven ancestors. The laws of life and death require careful cultivation.

Whoever cultivates the supreme dao, enters mountains and purifies, chanting spiritual chapters without this text, applying the talisman of summoning spirits, subduing demons, and the Seven Primal Disclosures supreme method, must not rashly act upon the jade chapters; the true will not descend, heavenly demons invade the body. Therefore, this text is the trust of the Nine Heavens, the decree of the Jade Emperor; without trust, practice causes the true dao not to be attained, lightly reciting to seek immortality, accumulating toil without response, instead receiving calamity; the Three Officials hold the trial, extinguishing the destined body. Those who seek to cultivate dao must prepare many scriptures, ensuring sufficient numbers, complementing above and below, performing bows and prostrations, practicing with proper measure, reciting ten thousand times, obtaining the Perfected to descend to the chamber, achieving immortality on the appointed day; not necessarily ten thousand times, but focused refinement.

Those who wear the talisman to summon spirits, subdue demons, and the Seven Primal Disclosures are all born of the Supreme Ultimate, commanding life and death, changing years, managing registers and records, inscribed in the Supreme Mysterious, universally announcing to the Four Offices, Five Emperors, and spirit officials, the Five Sacred Mountains, Nine Rivers, gods and immortals, all kowtowing and welcoming, guarding the destined body. This is the true imperial decree of the Supreme Emperor, thus able to command gods and spirits. Whoever practices this dao must not enter filth or pollution, nor tread the defilements of life and death. Violating these prohibitions, the true spirit departs, returning to the Upper Palace, the name fails to control, instead harming the destined body; those who obtain the method must be cautious.

The Supreme Jade Emperor, Primordial Emperor Dao Lord, received the Seven Primal Disclosures talisman from the Elder of the Nine Heavens, commanding the office of the highest true flying immortals, communicating spirit and penetrating vision, commanding demons and subduing spirits, wielding might over the Ten Directions, flowing fire for ten thousand li, sitting in death and standing in life; practicing for nine years, one obtains the mysterious chariot, flying and ascending Shangqing.

Practicing the supreme dao, cultivating and seeking immortality, subduing demons and commanding essence, writing talismans as prescribed, facing north, knocking left teeth thirty-six times, holding the sun, moon, and five star essences, clearly illuminating the destined body; softly praying:

> Seven primal disclosures shining forth, flowing might and spewing essence,  
> Casting light ten thousand li, spirits shining the five spirits,  
> Above commanding Northern Feng, inspecting and recording ghost names,  
> Heavenly Emperor’s mandate and seal, cutting and exterminating evil spirits,  
> I fully prepare disclosures, flowing golden fire bells,

> Obtaining to govern mysterious clouds, harnessing the green carriage,  
> Leading the Five Sacred Mountains, guiding my ascent to clarity.

Finished, apply according to position for seven years, surely a Perfected will descend, bestowing the destined highest true precious text.

Those with golden bones and jade names, purple characters of Shangqing, who wear the talisman to summon spirits, summon truth, subdue demons, and the Seven Primal Disclosures talisman, are recorded in the Nine Heavens, the Emperor announces to myriad truths and Four Office spirit officials, separately marking the destined body, entering and exiting, ascending the Five Sacred Mountains, guarded and welcomed by immortal officers, myriad demons bow their heads, all evils lose essence. Cultivating for one hundred days, communicating with spirits, the Perfected descends, bestowing the destined true scripture. Within seven years, one obtains to ride the flying carriage, roaming the Five Sacred Mountains, entering and exiting the Three Pure Ones.

Those who obtain must keep it secret, cautious as the Four Bright Ones.

Those who study the dao and become immortal and ascend, yet lack this scripture, the Nine Heavens’ jade officials do not dispatch destined immortals, the heavenly gate cannot be passed, the Five Sacred Mountains’ officials do not guard the destined body. Therefore, the trust of the Nine Heavens, the imperial decree, is applied only to those already Perfected, not practiced in the world. Those who obtain become immortals; with left assistant holding the staff, immortal capital on the right, attendant jade youth, five directions’ spirit officials, guarding this text, it must not be lightly treated or divulged. Violating the prohibition leads to death and destruction of the destined body. Ancient regulations, once in ten thousand kalpas transmitted, now some hear three transmissions within seven hundred years.

Without covenant transmission, the body undergoes the wind blade trial; receiving without trust, lightly regarding the dao and despising truth, the body perishes under ghost officials, offenses connecting to the seven mysteries. Thus the Four Extremes bright regulations have one-third trust; masters receiving without following regulations to use for other purposes perish under the Three Officials, long filling hell, never to be immortal.

Zhao Boxuan, formerly disciple of the Primordial Master, received the scripture to complete the dao, was to ascend the Golden Gate, yet lacked the talisman to summon spirits, summon truth, and the Seven Primal Disclosures talisman; in the bow and prostration posture, he retreated to Mount Rong; after seven hundred years, he visited the Clear True Little Child, received the covenant, swearing on Mount Weiyu; now ascended as Shangqing Left Minister.

Master Wang transmitted the scripture on Yangluo Mountain, on the morning of the eleventh month at the hour of the Rat, swearing the Nine Heavens to transmit to the Lady of the Southern Peak, now sealed in Yangluo Mountain.

Songzi of the Southern Peak, in the year of Yangshuo, transmitted the scripture on Mount Taihua to Gu Xi Zi, ordering one copy sealed in Bird Rat Mountain.

Master Tong Bai, on the twenty-ninth day of the sixth month, transmitted this text to Xu Yuanyou.
