The text of the Nine Elixirs’ Transcendent Transformation was bestowed by the Emperor of the Supreme Subtlety upon the Jade Youth of the Three Heavens. It teaches the supreme transformation through nine revolutions, returning essence and condensing spirit, dissolving the purple embryo’s knots at their root, restoring essence to nourish and sweeten the numinous, calming the deepest intestines, filling within and overflowing without the nine orifices with clarity and brilliance, refining marrow and easing bones, segment by segment receiving the true. This method is profound and wondrous, secreted within the Nine Heavens’ golden chambers and jade halls of the Spiritual Capital’s palace, following the bright sciences of the Four Extremes, passed down once in ten thousand kalpas. Without the mysterious purple slips and green characters of Supreme Clarity, one must not listen or inquire. Those who violate the spiritual prohibition are struck down by divine arms; those who cultivate secretly and with Daoist feeling ascend as flying immortals by day.

The Elder of the Nine Heavens spoke to the Jade Youth of the Three Heavens:

“Heaven and Earth revolve and intertwine; the two symbols unite in truth; yin and yang descend their energies. Above they respond to the Nine Mysteries; the elixir flows through nine revolutions, condensing qi into essence; essence transforms into spirit; spirit changes into human form. Thus the human image mirrors Heaven and Earth; the qi follows nature’s law. The natural qi all comes from the Nine Heavens’ essence, transformed into the human body, containing the embryo and nurturing it. After nine months the qi is full; the nine heavens’ qi is universal; in the tenth month birth occurs. The embryo’s knots and transformations bring fortune or misfortune, longevity or premature death, shortness or length of life—all depend on the inherited root and condensed qi’s purity. When hidden in the stomach and stagnating, the six organs are damaged and broken; form and spirit are unstable; the body does not receive spirit; death qi enters the orifices—how can one survive? Many only know cultivation but do not understand this root source. Now I tell you: the true form of one’s body unties knots as it is born, nourishes the hundred spirits, and the body naturally shines. The inner palace is clear; the spirit rests in its dwelling; myriad qi and immortals unite. Keep this secret; do not lightly reveal it.”

All humans at birth condense the nine elixirs’ transcendent transformation within the embryo, following the qi of the Nine Heavens. When qi is full and spirit complete, one dwells within the embryonic sac and naturally knows one’s destiny, aware of the root cause, revolving through the wheel of causes and conditions, nine heavens’ kalpas, transforming into the body. Once the yang path is seen and the three lights opened, one forgets the cause and origin of birth. This is all due to the embryo’s root knots stagnating, the three passes locked, the five organs unregulated, death qi blocking the gates, causing the spirit’s passes not to open, and thus forgetting one’s cause and condition. But if the numinous truth entrusts transformation, containing and refining the jade embryo, briefly passing through the purple gate, walking the human path, naturally graceful and radiant, shining with spirit and seeing the numinous, then one soars to the Nine Heavens, no longer bound by essence or qi to become human. All who cultivate and seek immortals must know to refine the body through the nine elixirs, dissolve knots in the five spirits, guide qi to the original birth, extinguish roots at the three gates, nine refinements and ten transformations, a hundred joints opening in clarity, severing and extinguishing embryo knots—then one knows the original truth. Having known the original truth, one becomes a transcendent immortal. Without this method, the three palaces are not enlightened, death qi not extinguished, the stomach does not receive spirit, qi wanders with spirit, the infant is unhappy, the palace empty and wasted, demons enter the body, and thus all illnesses arise, death does not fulfill destiny—how can pain be spoken of?

The yang qi is red, called the Mysterious Elixir. The yin qi is yellow, called the Yellow Essence. Yin and yang meet, two qi descend, essence transforms spirit and condenses, responding above to the Nine Heavens. The qi of the Nine Heavens spreads downward to the elixir field, combining with essence to condense and unite, gathering at the life gate, requiring nine passes—this is the nine elixirs, transcendent transformation condensing below, forming within the human. In the first month qi is received, in the second month spirit is received, in the third month transformation is contained, in the fourth month essence condenses, in the fifth month the head is formed, in the sixth month shape is transformed, in the seventh month spirit’s position is set, in the eighth month the nine orifices are clear, in the ninth month the nine heavens’ qi is universal and sound arises, in the tenth month the life officer registers fate, and life is received. Thus humans inherit the Nine Heavens’ qi, yin and yang essence, called the nine elixirs, combining to form the human body. Once human, one should return to nourish the original truth, open the five viscera, dissolve embryo roots, sever death orifices, and naturally become immortal.

All humans in the embryo receive the Nine Heavens’ qi, condensing essence to form themselves. After birth, twelve knots remain in the embryo, locked within the five internal organs; the five organs stagnate and block, knots cannot be undone, knots cannot be extinguished. Thus human illness arises from knot stagnation; human life ends from knot fixation. Those who can dissolve the twelve knots within the embryo will not be able to seek death.

The upper part of the embryo has four knots: one in the mud pellet, one in the mouth, one in the cheeks, one in the eyes. To dissolve the upper four knots, on the day of one’s birth at dawn, enter a room and burn incense, face northwest and bow nine times, facing the Nine Heavens’ Primordial Father, knock teeth nine times, call the Primordial Father’s true name three times, “Obedient Return.” Then face southeast and bow three times, call the Nine Heavens’ Mysterious Mother’s true name three times, “Chaos Return.” Then face the birth year’s direction and sit calmly, close eyes and think of the Primordial Father; body length nine inches nine fen, wearing a black and yellow simple spirit sash, head wearing a seven-string pearl and jade headdress, the Infinite Worthy Crown, dwelling above the Nine Heavens in the Supreme Ultimate Jade Palace, the Jade Treasure’s elixir capital and spiritual village’s cave origin, riding the azure rosy flying chariot, accompanied by twelve flying dragons and twenty-four immortals, descending from the northwest, entering my body to govern the mud pellet’s realm. Next think of the Mysterious Mother; body length six inches six fen, wearing blue treasure spirit light embroidered frost gauze nine-colored sash, head wearing purple original black-yellow treasure crown, dwelling above the nine qi’s infinite pole in the jade forest’s seven reflections elixir chamber, the jade treasure cave origin’s capital, nine light village of Supreme Clarity, riding the purple cloud flying essence feather canopy, accompanied by ten ascending phoenixes and thirty-six jade maidens, descending from the southeast, entering my body to govern the facial chamber within. Think of father and mother transforming into blue and yellow two qi, twisting and overlapping, competing above the head and face. After finishing, knock teeth nine times, and softly pray:

“The Jia (first earthly branch) receives the nine spirits’ transformation; condensed qi is impure, knots stagnate and lock, blocking the spirit gates. I respectfully present my birth fate, reporting to the High Morning Primordial Father and Mysterious Mother, reflecting below on my body. Eight lights shine together, Nine Heavens share the truth, jointly dissolving the upper four embryo knots, returning spirit to guard the gate, nine orifices knotting immortally, inner embryo refining transformation, nine elixirs condensing spirit, changing blue to red, two qi entwined, lifespan matching the three lights, eternally enjoying countless years.” Finished, swallow qi eighty-one times to stop.

Then think of the Boundless King Yudan, surname Hun, named Frost Vanishing, wearing a nine-colored seamless natural spotted robe, head wearing the shining essence sun round crown, governing the sky’s endless mysterious platform purple gate, riding the nine qilin jade wheel, accompanied by twenty-four jade immortals. Next think of the Most Supreme Zen Good Boundless Life King, surname Xi, named Ripple Vanishing, wearing a nine-colored cloud patterned robe, head wearing the shining essence moonlight crown, governing the heavenly king’s vermilion forest seven treasures jade platform, riding the twelve mysterious turtles flying blue feather canopy, accompanied by thirty-two upper palace jade immortals. Next think of the Xu Yan King, surname Zi, named Yu Wan, wearing a nine-colored three-method cloud patterned robe, head wearing the heavenly origin jade treasure bright crown, governing the heavenly jade capital spiritual capital palace, riding the nine-colored flying swan and three white flying clouds, accompanied by twenty-four pure spirit jade maidens. Next think of the Three Heavens’ True Kings, together descending above my head and face, transforming into blue, purple, and yellow three-colored qi, chaotic like clouds overlapping, entering from mouth, ears, nose, and orifices, circling the face. Then raise a prayer:

“Three Heavens’ Great Kings, Nine Mysterious Numinous Immortals, for me dissolve the head and face’s knot locks, transform the nine elixirs naturally, descend essence on the golden gate above, unite the three truths’ clouds, flow down my body to form my spirit, sweep away death qi, extinguish embryo roots, spirit and radiance firm and stable, cast out all calamities, knots are dissolved, segments receive the true, mysterious light flows and spreads, penetrating and watering the hidden springs. This is called the Nine Heavens, returning to embryo transforming immortal, filling within and overflowing without, inside and outside forming spirit.” Finished, swallow qi nine times to stop.

Again think of the Upper Part’s Eight Lights Divine Children. Close eyes and preserve the brain spirit: named Awakening Origin Son, styled Dao Capital, body length one inch one fen, wearing white brocade clothes, head wearing three-beam treasure crown; hair spirit named Mysterious Father Splendor, styled Dao Balance, body length two inches one fen, wearing black cloud brocade clothes, head wearing Infinite Worthy Crown; skin spirit named All-Pervading Middle, styled Dao Link, body length one inch five fen, wearing yellow brocade flying skirt, head wearing three qi treasure heavenly crown; eye spirit named Void Monitor Life, styled Dao Child, body length three inches, wearing five-colored embroidered clothes, head wearing Heaven-Connecting Crown; nape spirit named Spirit Counsel Cover, styled Dao Zhou, body length five inches, wearing white brocade plain skirt, head wearing three-beam treasure crown; back spirit named Beneficial Calendar Assistant, styled Dao Pillar, body length three inches five fen, wearing white jade soft clothes, head wearing Mysterious Origin Treasure Crown; nose spirit named Rushing Dragon Jade, styled Dao Micro, body length two inches five fen, wearing blue-yellow plain brocade flying skirt, head wearing Far-Traveling Crown; tongue spirit named Beginning Beam Peak, styled Dao Branch, body length seven inches, wearing crimson brocade flying skirt, head wearing Worthy Crown. The Eight Lights all complete, each like an infant’s form, united on the face, each resting in its place. Then knock teeth eight times, softly pray:

“Upper Light One Section, Eight Spirits united in truth, condensed qi nine elixirs, transformed to form my body. A thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, like clouds dispersing smoke, descend and circle head and face, bestowing spirit and spreading spirit, dissolving knots, extinguishing embryo roots, removing fixation, opening the three passes, Eight Lights guarding and assisting, united with spirit through the years. Emperor and Mysterious Mother, winding and turning High Morning, descend my jade splendor, stop my decline, return my rosy countenance, face transformed to golden immortal, changing light chasing lightning, directly arriving at the sun’s gate.” Finished, swallow eight qi to stop, then wear the talisman of the Transcendent Transformation of the Nine Elixirs’ Yang Spirit.

### Talismans of the Transcendent Transformation of the Nine Elixirs’ Yang Spirit

Written in vermilion on blue paper, three sheets. At noon, facing one’s birth fate, knock teeth nine times, softly pray:

“Transcendent transformation of the nine qi, refining and transforming the hundred spirits, governing the six palaces within, descending the great immortal without, Mysterious Mother nurturing the ferry, dissolving knots and stagnation, severing and extinguishing embryo roots, body light and flesh flying, responding to qi naturally, ascending with qi, arriving before the Emperor.” Finished, wear the talisman, swallow qi nine times, stop.

The right upper knot lies in the head and face realm. On the day of one’s birth, at dawn, enter a room, quietly think of the true spirit, dissolve knots and segments, sever embryo roots, take elixir and swallow qi, command the yang spirit talisman, open the three palaces. For three years thus, body rests and qi grows strong, bones light and flesh strong, riding the void flying, entering and exiting without obstruction. After nine years, connecting with spirit, speaking with gods, summoning cloud chariots, ascending to the Emperor’s morning. The secret method of transformation, carefully not to reveal falsely, bright science strictly forbidden, calamities afflict the seven mysteries, only in secret cultivation can one achieve transcendent immortality.

The embryo’s middle part has four knots: one in the five viscera, two in the great granary, three in the large intestine, four in the small intestine. To dissolve the middle four knots, on the day of one’s birth at noon, enter a room and burn incense, face northwest and bow nine times to the Primordial Father, call his true name three times “Obedient Return,” then turn southeast and bow three times to the Mysterious Mother, call her true name three times “Chaos Return.” Face the birth year’s direction and sit calmly, knock teeth nine times, close eyes and think of the Primordial Father; body length nine inches nine fen, wearing black and yellow simple spirit sash, head wearing seven-string pearl and jade headdress, Infinite Worthy Crown, dwelling above the Nine Heavens in the Supreme Ultimate Jade Palace, the Jade Treasure’s elixir capital and spiritual village’s cave origin, riding the azure rosy flying chariot, accompanied by twelve flying dragons and twenty-four immortals, descending from the northwest, entering my body’s five viscera. Next think of the Mysterious Mother; body length six inches six fen, wearing blue treasure spirit light embroidered frost gauze nine-colored sash, head wearing purple original black-yellow treasure crown, dwelling above the nine qi’s infinite pole in the jade forest’s seven reflections elixir chamber, the jade treasure cave origin’s capital, nine light village of Supreme Clarity, riding the purple cloud flying essence feather canopy, accompanied by twelve phoenixes and thirty-six jade maidens, descending from the southeast, entering my five viscera. Think of father and mother transforming into blue and yellow two qi, chaotic like the sun’s roundness, illuminating the five viscera, shining inside and outside. Then raise a prayer:

“Father spirit and mother essence, two qi united, nine elixirs condensing and transforming, nourishing the purple jade embryo, receiving the light of Supreme Subtlety, commanding the nine spirits, Emperor spreading spirit, flowing truth watering life, five viscera knotted and connected, six palaces clear and open, stomach and intestines wise and open, nine orifices bright and clear, old knots dispersed, new embryo flourishing, changing light refining body, crowned with nine stars, three lights winging the section, flying into the Emperor’s court.” Finished, swallow forty-five qi to stop.

Then think of the Silent King, surname Jin, named Quen Ying, wearing seven-colored dragon patterned shining robe, head wearing yin essence night light crown, governing the vermilion palace jade platform in heaven, riding the eight lights flying wheel, accompanied by twelve jade immortals. Next think of the Unarrogant Joyful King, surname Ning, named Zi Quan Mao, wearing nine-colored flying frost cloud patterned spotted robe, head wearing green splendor Jupiter mysterious essence crown, governing the heavenly origin palace’s red elixir chamber nine-layer jade platform, riding white deer and cinnabar rosy chariot, accompanied by twenty-six upper palace jade immortals. Next think of the Transforming Responding Voice King, surname Yao, named Rang Lie, wearing nine-colored flowing light shining cloud brocade robe, head wearing white light Venus jade essence crown, governing the heavenly jade forest upper palace vermilion shining chamber, riding flying phoenix wandering sky purple wheel, accompanied by thirty-six supreme jade immortals. Next think of the Three Heavens’ True Kings, together descending into my five viscera, transforming into red, white, and black three-colored qi, chaotic like cloud smoke, entering through the heart orifice, circling the five internal organs. Then softly pray:

“Nine elixirs condense in the sky, three qi knot and entwine, mysterious truth descends fully, inside and outside bright and fresh, great granary closed and open, intestines and stomach knot immortal, sever and extinguish segments and stems, disperse old roots, three unite forming contract, nine transformations condense spirit, return essence to jade embryo, to form my body, nine colors black and yellow, flowing essence watering the ferry, washing away accumulated stagnation, inside no dregs or dust, splendid branches combine and flourish, planting spiritual roots, every orifice clear and open, every segment cold and still, bones transform and light fly, ascending to the purple sky.” Finished, swallow nine qi to stop.

Again think of the Middle Part’s Eight Lights Divine Children. Close eyes and preserve the throat spirit: named Hundred Flowing Release, styled Dao Connect, body length eight inches, wearing nine-colored embroidered clothes, head wearing Flat Heaven Purple Morning crown; lung spirit named Pure Spirit Life, styled Dao Peace, body length eight inches one fen, wearing white brocade flying cloud clothes, head wearing nine original treasure crown; heart spirit named Radiant Yang Prosperous, styled Dao Bright, body length nine inches, wearing crimson embroidered single clothes, head wearing jade morning treasure heavenly crown; liver spirit named Open Monarch Child, styled Dao Green, body length seven inches, wearing flying blue feather skirt, head wearing three-beam crown; gall bladder spirit named Dragon Virtue Captive, styled Dao Release, body length three inches six fen, wearing blue-yellow-green three-colored skirt, head wearing Infinite Worthy Crown; left kidney spirit named Spring Origin True, styled Dao Minister, body length three inches seven fen, wearing five-colored changing light skirt, head wearing Far-Traveling Crown; right kidney spirit named Elephant That None, styled Dao Life, body length three inches five fen, wearing white brocade single clothes, head wearing three qi treasure light crown; spleen spirit named Treasure Origin Complete, styled Dao Qian, body length seven inches three fen, wearing yellow brocade flying skirt, head wearing purple morning crown. The Eight Lights all complete, each like an infant’s form, united within the five viscera, each resting in its place. Again knock teeth eight times, raise a prayer:

“Middle Part Eight Lights, ascending to nine revolutions, transforming essence jade embryo, knotting qi purple brightness, refining soul and firming spirit, myriad spirits all gathered, Emperor dissolving knots, nine orifices scattering open, Mysterious Mother descending spirit, segment by segment receiving radiance, filling within and overflowing without, splendid light without fading, joining with Eight Lights, riding chariots flying together, birth fate announced, as the omen returns, guiding my ascent, opening the spirit gate.” Finished, swallow eight qi to stop, then wear the talisman for refining the embryonic essence and spirit.

### Talismans for Refining the Embryonic Essence and Spirit

Written in yellow on white paper, three sheets. At noon, facing one’s birth year, knock teeth nine times, softly pray:

“Mysterious qi condenses essence, yin transforms yang to birth, nine revolutions eight lights, gaining the riding flowing chariot, descending to the birth body, connecting spirit and calming spirit, dissolving knots and dispersing segments, four bindings open and clear, nine orifices wide and spread, myriad qi universally peaceful, riding the void flying light, ascending into Supreme Clarity’s stillness.” Finished, wear the talisman, swallow qi nine times, stop.

The right middle four knots lie within the five viscera. On the day of one’s birth, at dawn, dissolve the upper knots; at noon, dissolve the middle knots; sever and extinguish embryo roots; take spirit elixir, command spirit talisman, swallow original qi, connect spirit abode. For three years thus, spirit qi abundant; after nine years accumulating feeling, riding with spirit chariot, flying in the great void, ascending into the Emperor’s abode. Supreme and wondrous method, Dao is not empty; those seeking immortality must deeply keep this scripture.

The embryo’s lower part has four knots: one in the bladder, two in the yin, three in the back gate, four in the two feet. To dissolve the lower four knots, on the day of one’s birth at midnight, when life qi begins, enter a room and burn incense, face northwest and bow nine times to the Primordial Father, call his true name three times “Obedient Return,” then turn southeast and bow three times to the Mysterious Mother, call her true name three times “Chaos Return.” Face the Grand Duke’s direction and sit calmly, knock teeth nine times, close eyes and think of the Primordial Father; body length nine inches nine fen, wearing black and yellow simple spirit sash, head wearing seven-string pearl and jade headdress, Infinite Worthy Crown, dwelling above the Nine Heavens in the Supreme Ultimate Jade Palace, the Jade Treasure’s elixir capital and spiritual village’s cave origin, riding the azure rosy flying chariot, accompanied by twelve flying dragons and twenty-four immortals, descending from the northwest, entering my bladder within the five viscera. Next think of the Mysterious Mother; body length six inches six fen, wearing blue treasure spirit light embroidered frost gauze nine-colored sash, head wearing purple original black-yellow treasure crown, dwelling above the nine qi’s infinite pole in the jade forest’s seven reflections elixir chamber, the jade treasure cave origin’s capital, nine light village of Supreme Clarity, riding the purple cloud flying essence feather canopy, accompanied by twelve phoenixes and thirty-six jade maidens, descending from the southeast, entering my bladder, descending to the two feet. Think of father and mother transforming into blue and yellow two qi, chaotic like the sun’s roundness, illuminating the whole body, shining inside and outside. Then raise a prayer:

“Yin and yang in perfect harmony, two qi thoroughly clear, transcendent transformation of the Mysterious Elixir above, transformation to Yellow Essence below, containing embryo transformation, body without fixed form, Emperor supervising and reflecting, nine orifices receiving spirit, twelve parts knot dispersed, Yellow Court extinguished, Eight Lights entwined, stomach knotted purple jade, three souls refined, seven spirits peaceful, myriad spirits treasure guarding, inside and outside balanced, three parts and eight lights born with me, guiding my flight and ascent, ascending to Jade Clarity.” Finished, swallow twenty-four qi to stop.

Then think of the Brahma Treasure King, surname Jing, named Mist Cloud Xi, wearing nine-colored flowing cloud flying morning robe, head wearing flowing elixir vermilion treasure shining star mysterious essence crown, governing the southern heaven’s seven reflections palace, riding flowing rosy cinnabar jade chariot feather canopy, accompanied by twelve upper palace jade immortals. Next think of Brahma Maitreya King, surname Xuan, named E Hui, wearing nine-colored original phoenix flying cloud robe, head wearing mysterious morning star flowing essence crown, governing the Nine Mysterious Phoenix City purple jade platform, riding white qilin plain cloud flying wheel, accompanied by thirty-two Great Flower jade immortals. Next think of Polidahe King, surname Yu, named Ling Yi, wearing nine-colored seamless mysterious cloud treasure robe, head wearing Infinite Flowing Yellow Filling Star flying essence crown, governing the heavenly mound layered jade capital great wondrous palace nine-curved chamber, riding five-colored cloud chariot, accompanied by twelve Great Mysterious jade immortals. Next think of the Three Heavens’ True Kings, together descending into my body, governing the bladder, descending to the two feet, transforming into purple, green, and blue three-colored qi, chaotic like cloud mist, entering from the yin, flowing through bladder, back gate, and two feet, inside and outside reflecting. Then pray:

“Three Heavens nurture the embryo, nine qi knot spirit, transcendent transformation of the Mysterious Elixir above, transformation to immortal below, two symbols descend united, forming my body, six stomachs jade beauty, nine palaces receiving truth, twelve knots each severing roots, sweeping away filth and five spirits spreading, Mysterious Mother emitting essence, refining transformation bright and fresh, golden immortal wing spirit, jade splendor knotting chapters, named the Blue Palace, long serving the Emperor’s morning.” Finished, swallow nine qi to stop.

Again think of the Lower Part’s Eight Lights Divine Children. Close eyes and preserve the stomach spirit, named Same Zhu Yu, styled Dao Unfold, body length seven inches, wearing yellow brocade flying skirt, head wearing Flat Heaven Purple Morning crown; colon spirit named Zhao Teng Kang, styled Dao Return, body length two inches four fen, wearing crimson embroidered single clothes, head wearing three-beam crown; large and small intestine spirit named Peng Song Liu, styled Dao Kitchen, body length two inches one fen, wearing yellow crimson flying skirt, head wearing jade morning treasure heavenly crown; torso spirit named Shou Xiang Bo, styled Dao Void, body length nine inches one fen, wearing nine-colored embroidered clothes, head wearing flying morning jade crown; chest diaphragm spirit named Guang Ying Zhai, styled Dao Rushing, body length five inches, wearing white brocade flying skirt, head wearing Infinite Worthy Crown; two flanks spirit named Pi Jia Ma, styled Dao Accomplish, body length four inches one fen, wearing red and white two-colored skirt, head wearing nine original treasure crown; left yin right yang spirit named Fu Liu Qi, styled Dao Jade, body length two inches three fen, wearing blue-yellow-white three-colored skirt, head wearing Far-Traveling Crown; right yin left yang spirit named Bao Biao Ming, styled Dao Life, body length two inches three fen, wearing blue-yellow-white three-colored skirt, head wearing three-beam crown. The Eight Lights all complete, each like an infant’s form, each resting in its place, a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders circling within my yin, bladder, back gate, and two feet. Again knock teeth eight times, raise a prayer:

“Lower Part Eight Lights, dispersing form transforming spirit, containing primordial nurturing qi, refining embryo purple smoke, Supreme One Primordial Father, Mysterious Mother entwined, two essences flowing and watering, nourishing inner truth, Emperor fixing the register, life officer changing years, knots and segments dispersed, nine orifices fresh and clear, soul and spirit firm and secure, commanding myriad spirits, ascending with me, together creating jade morning.” Finished, swallow elixir eight times to stop.

Then think of the Dao One Inner Spirit, named Arriving No Horse, styled Dao Supreme Life, body length two inches two fen, wearing purple civilization light brocade skirt, head wearing Infinite Worthy Crown, dwelling below the navel in the elixir field, commanding the three parts and twenty-four truths. Knock teeth thirty-two times, softly pray:

“Mysterious Supreme Great Spirit, commanding without outside, settling the hidden valley, flowing essence purple canopy, myriad truths attending spirit, three parts mutually guarding, Emperor shining the seat, Mysterious Mother joyfully serving, nine origins united in talisman, life officer extending and advancing, three mornings shining together, binding with truth.” Finished, swallow twenty-four qi to stop, then wear the talisman of the Three Passes and Twelve Knots Within the Embryo.

---

### Talismans of the Three Passes and Twelve Knots Within the Embryo

Written in vermilion on bamboo slips, three sheets, after preserving thought, face the Grand Duke and wear them, softly pray:

“Upper part four knots, fix human mud pellet, falling human radiant face, premature death human proliferation; middle part four knots, gathering calamity as a group, locking the great granary, hastening human wandering soul, coming to communicate with demons, dreams unclear; lower part four knots, knotting human back gate, blocking human nine orifices, severing human life root. Emperor commands spirit, Nine Heavens’ five characters, dissolving and dispersing knots, extinguishing all root sources, Primordial Father and Mysterious Mother, nurturing the three passes, Eight Lights guarding fully, true qi dispersing and dividing, Supreme Clarity below Yellow, outer square inside round, wrapping all pure, descending three origins, gaining ride on Eight Lights, flying through clouds, soaring in the void, ascending to golden gate.” Finished, swallow twelve qi, swallow twenty-four times, stop.

On the birth day at dawn, noon, and midnight, dissolve the three parts’ twelve knots; the eight festival days also apply, to hasten the seeking of immortality. Cultivation on the eight festivals is the same as the three times of preserving thought. Practice for three years, face shining jade light, body reflecting golden truth, flesh consuming and bones light, inner transformation knotting immortal, after nine years spirit descends, ascending by day. Without this method, all efforts are in vain; death knots do not disperse, stagnation locks daily, spirit and qi do not spread, demons enter the body, wandering souls scatter—how can immortality be attained? Those with heart and determination should thoroughly seek this root. Dissolve knots at the three times, and one can obtain transcendent immortality. Returning to the jade embryo’s beauty, the three passes receiving truth, three parts and eight lights, twenty-four spirits, a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, together riding the purple smoke. Supreme and wondrous transformation, jade emperor’s spiritual chapters; false transmission and careless leakage bring disaster to the seven mysteries, death and soul burden responsibility, long closed in the river source, self bearing the trial, three paths and five sufferings, ten thousand kalpas without return. Learners must be cautious, secretly knowing these words.

The spirits of the two lights are all the Nine Heavens’ transformed spirits. The Primordial Father transforms above, the Mysterious Mother knots the embryo, the Nine Heavens nurture and nourish to form the human. The twenty-four persons each guard spiritual passes. Those who wish to cultivate but do not know to preserve thought of their form, their spirit wanders and qi scatters, death qi knots and sinks, demons enter the lights, hastening fate and short years. If one knows cultivation, dissolving the three passes, spirit rests in the palace, spirit guards the jade gate, knots dissolve by themselves, death qi naturally perishes, myriad spirits unite with lights, then by day one ascends to heaven.

All humans inherit the Nine Heavens’ qi, qi condenses to essence, essence transforms to elixir, elixir changes to human, knots in the embryo containing pregnancy, following nature. Once human, one should return to nourish the original truth, letting essence overflow the six palaces, qi descend the spirit court, inside and outside shining, united with truth and spirit. This method is profound and wondrous, not transmitted to lower immortals. Those who cultivate this way return white and stop aging, lifespan equal to the three lights, Heaven and Earth inclined together. To carelessly leak its essentials is to examine your own body closely.

All advanced learners first dissolve the three passes’ knots within the body. The method for dissolving knots must be practiced according to the embryo’s month, nourishing the original root, letting death knots sink and disperse, nine truths guarding spirit. Once true qi descends, one naturally grows long life; qi and image correspond, and one becomes without study. Practice this way: if born in the seventh month, then the tenth month is the embryo month; if the tenth month is the embryo month, then receive the Polidahe King’s qi. On the first day of the tenth month at dawn, the eleventh day at noon, the twenty-first day at midnight, and the third day of the next month at the three times, bathe with fragrant water, burn incense, enter the room, face northwest and bow nine times to the Nine Heavens’ Primordial Father, southeast three times to the Nine Heavens’ Mysterious Mother, then face the monthly direction and sit calmly, knock teeth thirty-six times, close eyes and think of Polidahe King, surname Yu, named Ling Wu, wearing nine-colored seamless mysterious cloud treasure robe, head wearing Infinite Flowing Yellow Filling Star flying essence crown, riding five-colored cloud chariot, accompanied by twelve Great Mysterious jade immortals, descending into the embryo’s mud pellet palace. Preserve vision of blue clouds dense and lush, crown surrounding the embryo, long time, then draw in cloud qi by mouth, swallow nine times, softly pray:

“Mysterious Origin spreading qi, yang path opening, two symbols descending united, blue and yellow following, transcendent transformation nine elixirs, condensing essence three palaces, form following nature, qi following great void, Emperor guarding spirit, Mysterious Mother watching chamber, myriad spirits settled, six stomachs flourishing, nine heavens crowned, three lights shining, five truths assisting wings, returning body to emptiness, riding void floating, ascending to Emperor’s hall.” Finished, swallow qi nine times, swallow elixir twenty-four times to stop. Thus the Nine Heavens’ qi nourishes the body; knots and stagnations at embryo time will not again form in the three passes. Practice for three years, know events ten thousand miles away, omens of fortune and misfortune. This is because the passes receive truth, orifices open and clear.

In the eleventh month receive Brahma Maitreya King’s qi; on the second day at dawn, twelfth day at noon, twenty-second day at midnight, third day of the next month at three times, bathe with fragrant water, burn incense, enter room, northwest nine bows to Primordial Father, southeast three bows to Mysterious Mother, face monthly direction calmly, knock teeth thirty-six times, close eyes and think of Brahma Maitreya King, surname Xuan, named E Hui, wearing nine-colored original phoenix flying cloud robe, head wearing mysterious morning star flowing essence crown, riding white qilin plain cloud flying wheel, accompanied by thirty-two Great Flower jade immortals, descending into the embryo’s chamber. Preserve vision of green clouds dense and lush, crown surrounding embryo, long time, then draw in cloud qi by mouth, swallow nine times, softly pray:

“Nine Heavens flowing elixir, transcendent transformation knotting essence, Primordial Father pouring qi, Mysterious Mother receiving spirit, five flowers scattering light, three truths mixed and united, Emperor commanding register, Supreme One recording birth, upper mysterious below yellow, three palaces pure and clear, nine orifices receiving truth, myriad spirits peaceful and harmonious, riding fate revolving years, returning to original form, ascending with qi, born with spirit, flying in mysterious void, reporting to Emperor’s court.” Finished, swallow qi nine times, swallow elixir twenty-four times to stop. Practice three years thus, refine intestines and strengthen qi, foresee the future, after nine years bones light, ascend by day.

In the twelfth month receive Brahma Treasure King’s qi; on the third day at dawn, thirteenth day at noon, twenty-third day at midnight, third day of next month at three times, bathe with fragrant water, burn incense, enter room, northwest nine bows to Primordial Father, southeast three bows to Mysterious Mother, face monthly direction calmly, knock teeth thirty-six times, close eyes and think of Brahma Treasure King, surname Jing, named Mist Cloud Xi, wearing nine-colored flowing cloud flying morning robe, head wearing flowing elixir vermilion crown, shining star mysterious essence crown, riding flowing rosy cinnabar jade chariot feather canopy, accompanied by twelve upper palace jade immortals, descending into the embryo’s bright chamber.

### Talismans for the Nine Elixirs’ Flowing Essence to Preserve Life

Written in blue on bamboo slips, facing birth fate, wear three sheets at three times. This connects abdomen refining marrow, transforming bone knotting spirit, three years raising body to transformation. Before wearing talisman, first pray:

“Heaven descends, Earth rises, two qi mutually flourishing, nine elixirs transforming, knotting essence in chamber, eight lights dispersing spirit, six palaces flourishing within, myriad spirits all pure, long enjoying great intestine, ending Heaven’s extreme Earth, joy without end.” Finished, wear talisman, swallow qi nine times to stop.

All who cultivate this Dao must calculate the embryo’s month, act according to the month, ending at the tenth month. This *Scripture of the Embryonic Essence Within* is the root of learning immortality, the source of seeking life. Without this Dao, all efforts are vain, no benefit to form and spirit. Form not refined, knots and roots unbroken, true spirit wandering and scattering, though cloud chariots descend, form cannot fly by itself. The supreme secret Dao, carefully not to reveal falsely, with solemn oath and examination, calamities afflict the seven mysteries, self bearing responsibility, long in hell without entering immortality. 

Those who transmit the scripture must fast with teacher and disciple for ninety or thirty days, bring one jin of refined gold, eighty chi of white silk, one jin of cinnabar, as substitute for oath’s trust, kneel northward to swear and transmit. Do not lightly transmit; without oath or trust, cultivating this Dao brings calamity to the seven mysteries, self bearing responsibility, burdened with sin in dark night, ten thousand kalpas without return. Learners must clearly be cautious, do not recklessly reveal.
