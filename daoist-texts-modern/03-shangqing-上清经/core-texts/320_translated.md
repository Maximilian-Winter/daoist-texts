### Title of the Scripture: Scripture of the Inner Names of the Hundred Spirits, Blessings of the Nine Heavens’ Supreme Emperor of Shangqing.  
Authorship unknown, roughly composed in the late Eastern Jin of the South, this text is a reworking of the *Great Cavern Scripture* and the *Female Unity Scripture*. One scroll. Source text from the *Orthodox Daoist Canon*, Zhengyi section.

Those who can foresee the chief names of the hundred spirits do not die; those who constantly recite the blessings of the Nine Heavens’ Supreme Emperor become immortals.

Three, five, seven, nine: the dao of immortals is fulfilled.  
The mixed cavern’s eight intervals condense the emperor’s form.  
The twelve vows bring forth the blessings of the heavens.  
This is the returning origin of the hundred spirits’ brightness.  
The secret blessings of the five paths protect Huangning.  
I know the hundred spirits obtain eternal life.  
May Heaven and immortals attain Shangqing,  
Blessings and fortune naturally contain the true numinous.  
The mixed cavern’s eight intervals, the female unity essence,  
Embrace the great cavern’s supreme scripture,  
The ancestral patriarch unties knots and receives the name of gestation.

Thus concludes the blessing of the hundred spirits’ names.

Three, five, seven, nine—the mixed cavern’s eight intervals, the emperor’s single condensed form; the twelve persons united in vows—this is the oral transmission of the great cavern, the jade formula of thirty-nine chapters. Those who obtain it become the supreme truth; those who practice it become the supreme truth.  
The golden slips are inscribed on feathered banners; jade tablets carved upon cavern peaks.  
The Heavenly Emperor treasures its transformations; the Three Primes forbid its leakage.  
Therefore, those who transmit it must fast facing the altar for three hundred days, mid-fast one hundred seventy days, short fast forty-five days; diligently with a red heart practice the dark formulas; painfully discipline the five bodies in supplication; labor the body with the breath of the scripture master; seek response from the numinous Han’s surface; incense clouds thick upon the sleeping mat; sit harmoniously in the master’s chamber.  
Thus the true heart becomes clear and bright, the profound hardship joins the journey, the hidden seeking is smooth and open; only then is the true scripture given to the ear.  
The fasting and food regulations all follow the great cavern’s law. On the day of receiving the book, a joint oath is sworn in a separate chamber.  
Leak the jade scripture, and the seven ancestors face the test and punishment of the Wind Blade.

### The Most High’s Chant for Wisdom to Dispel Demons

After reading the *Great Cavern True Scripture* ten times, one should read this chant to dispel demons once, to ward off the poisonous qi of the Nine Heavens and to avert the trial of the Northern Emperor’s Great Demon King.  
The Most High Four Elder Lords attend on the Jade Morning Most High Dao Lord’s left side. The Dao Lord dwells leisurely in the Chamber of Coordinated Morning Jade Void, the Golden Splendor Room, beneath the Nine Mysterious Registers, right aiding the Six Leaders.  
Here the Most Precious True Man summons the Jade Pure Spirit Maiden, holding the incense flower of the Vermilion Mound’s flying qi, clutching the essential mysterious numinous seal, standing.  
The Most High Dao Lord rinses with jade-green water, exhales crimson qi, empties heart and calms body, settles spirit and focuses the mysterious.  
He wears the divine tiger on the left, the golden truth on the right, chanting and intoning the Wisdom Jade Scripture, the chapter on dispelling demons and medicines, the eight mysteries and nine darknesses, the seven gates and three candles, the sun void and moon none.  
The upper text is clear and rich; a thousand truths halt their wheels, ten thousand spirits cease their steps.  
The empty sounds rise and strike; mysterious sprinklings bring a hundred blessings; the distinct echoes and elegant music, cavern gold clear and rich; the upper mirror penetrates the hidden depths, below shines and humbles the crouching.  
The mysterious pattern flows and blooms; the spirit’s insight is swift; the Dao meeting is boundless; rare rhymes and subtle awakenings; the whirlwind qi extends the void; dust and ruin accumulate realms; the mysterious reflection shines within; clear waves like a mirror pure; the great Dao is fully prepared afar; flying light burns remote and bright; moving steps traverse the numinous cosmos; startling waves drift in white ease; sinking and rising without darkness; gazing at the sun’s release and leap; transformation then hopes for azure; change is not crude silence; circling transformation lifts the soaring yang; rare rest and radiant virtue; serene joy at the twin gates; returning to grasp principle’s hinge; calming the simple great image; ringing bells shake the vast river; dark caverns penetrate and communicate; principle’s wonder connects the subtle; roaming and playing with the spirit blade; floating clear the great gem; stirring the hundred yang to birth lightning; beating the thousand yin to exhale might; six heavens lose qi; nine demons are destroyed and dispelled; grasping the sun’s broad rosy clouds; ten thousand mists enter the embrace; stillness harmonizes with Heaven and Earth; movement aligns with the seven scenes’ equal radiance; the mysterious resting place, the method hall; emptiness pours security and danger; reflecting bright smoke flows; gathering truth to contain rest; coordinating morning then two extremes separate and harmonize; opening eyes then ten thousand truths spontaneously unfold.

Yet these birds begin with human movement; the Dao also aids life; surmounting peaks condenses spirit; shaking and opening rugged heights; nine calamities send away hardship; no thought, no feeling; all harmonize eight images; mysterious no qi light; high sky seven glances; hanging fragrant elegant blossoms; vermilion yellow fiery gathering; flying smoke bright numinous; pottery motion containing truth; sprinkling simplicity scattering name; rinsing taste with numinous feathers; spirit level sky clear; wandering the nine heavens; high chamber fragrant dark; jade maiden holds incense; purple consort embraces infant; pouring ford sky pool; scattering blossoms jade court; issuing commands to armored steeds; swiftly seizing heavenly soldiers; poisonous dragons spitting tips; divine tigers deploying troops; outer wrapping mysterious qi; outer preparing five cities; Dao nothing not harmonized; relying on might to be born; true completion equal virtue; primal qi thus combined.

### Great Cavern Jade Scripture Method of Ingesting the Mysterious Root Qi

The method of ingesting the mysterious root qi makes the human body clear and bright; spirit and mind become eight-wise; the body bears sun’s reflection; the face has jade luster; eyes produce bright light; teeth contain purple qi; firm intestines hide brilliance; long life and clear vision.  
Taking in and exhaling morning liquid; suspending food and ceasing grains; the Dao’s essence lies in golden liquid; the matter’s marvel in water jade; this is called naturally breathing the great harmony; commanding the nine essences’ spirits.  
The Dao’s function esteems naturalness; virtue’s stillness honors serenity and joy.  
Grasping nature to reveal truth; embracing calm vastness to correct right and wrong; then transversal offenses do not arise; non-harm self-extinguishes.  
This and the three, five, seven, nine qi may be called the essential point of the Dao’s meaning.

Before rising from rest, one preserves in the mouth a white qi, as large as a chicken egg’s yolk; outside the yolk is five-colored qi, turning naturally and flowing.  
It gathers and overflows beyond the yellow; soon it must fill the heart and mouth; this is called the three, five, seven, nine sun-child mysterious root qi.  
Within the person’s heart, stomach, and mouth dwells a woman in the form of an infant, without clothes, standing upright in the stomach channel, mouth open facing the stomach channel’s gate; she is called the Nine Heavens’ Mysterious Maiden, receiving and pouring soul liquid, inhaling the five-colored qi of the chicken egg yolk in the mouth.  
Constantly rinsing and filling the mouth inside and out, up and down, with the tongue circling to absorb the sun’s five-colored fluid; filling the mouth and swallowing it, causing the fluid to descend into the Mysterious Maiden’s mouth.  
After five repetitions, finish, then knock teeth three times, softly blessing:

Jade Pure Most High, Nine Heavens Nine Spirits,  
Govern in the mysterious depths, descend into the clear stomach,  
Golden harmony and jade reflection,  
First born from emptiness, called Pure Ring,  
Named Brilliant Essence,  
Refining soul and binding spirit,  
Heart opens spirit bright,  
Taking in the sun-child,  
Golden splendor fills and overflows.

After a while, all finished, wipe both eyes with the hand, then rub both hands together, vigorously massaging between face and eyebrows, temples and skin edges, slightly warming, causing the altar to steam fragrantly.  
This is the Most High’s method of taking the three, five, seven, nine sun-child mysterious root.

### Ode to Lady Wang of Ziwei

Feasting and gazing at the Great Rosy Dawn Palace,  
Golden towers shining purple and clear.  
Immortal chambers reflecting Great Primordial,  
Four pavilions all vermilion jade.  
Casting wheels at the cavern ford,  
Guiding reins dancing green carriages.  
Jade splendor flying cloud covers,  
Western consort wielding brocade banners.  
Suddenly at the boundary of dust and impurity,  
Swiftly entering the beautiful person’s courtyard.  
Old karmic response destined to come,  
What is gained already in the dark.  
Riding the wind ascending the nine skies,  
Together sipping cinnabar infant’s nectar.  
Turning away from worldly things,  
How can one know the cavern’s spirit?  
North climbing the mysterious dark pass,  
Hand in hand binding high nets.  
Incense smoke disperses the eight scenes,  
Mysterious wind drums the crimson waves.  
Looking up beyond coral ford,  
Looking down at returning mountain’s nook.  
Jade whistles singing above the clouds,  
Phoenix cries in the cavern’s nine distant realms.  
Riding qi floating in great void,  
Why then tread mountains and rivers?  
Golden tokens commanding feathered spirits,  
Conquering peaks crushing high demons.  
Rinsing and drawing round morning radiance,  
Accumulating longevity and infant teeth.  
In the midst of competing throngs,  
Unknowing what to do.
