# Scripture of the Mysterious Elixir of the Bright Hall of Supreme Clarity

**Title of the Scripture:** Scripture of the Mysterious Elixir of the Bright Hall of Supreme Clarity.  
Author unknown, roughly dating from the Eastern Jin and Southern Dynasties. It is compiled by excerpting the *Great Marvelous Scripture* (*Dayou Miaojing*). The base text is sourced from the Zhengyi section of the *Orthodox Daoist Canon* (*Zhengtong Daozang*).

Guarding the inch to the left is the Great God of the Crimson Terrace’s Azure Chamber, upright of heart, styled Chufang; to the right, the Great God of the Purple Chamber of the Yellow Gate, calm and serene, styled Fawang. Their forms resemble infants, their garments matching the colors of their chambers; each holds a flowing golden fire bell in hand. When one desires to recline or to meditate, first one envisions the two great gods in their form and color, then calls their names thrice, and softly utters this blessing:

“Purple Gate, Azure Chamber, two great gods, hands grasping flowing bells, bodies born of wind and cloud, chivalrous guardians of the true dao, heed not the outside world; let me feel and think, open the numinous passes, freely enter and exit the portals of integrity, ascend the nine gates, and behold the nine perfected ones, the Most High’s august presence.”

Having done so, one then contemplates the Three-in-One, the Bright Hall’s left bright infant True Lord Xuanyang, styled Shaoqing; the central Bright Mirror Divine Lord named Zhaojing, styled Siming; and the right Bright Female True Official named Weiyin, styled Shaoyuan. Their forms are like infants, all clad in green brocade robes, belts adorned with four red jade bells, mouths holding red jade mirrors, sitting opposite each other, all facing outward or sometimes facing one another. This is the dao of the Bright Hall.

**Yellow Robe and Black Cap**

If the daoist feels fear, he envisions the Three Gods, causing the jade bells to ring. Now the sound reaches the Supreme Ultimate; the mouth emits the red light of the jade mirror, blazing and flashing ten thousand zhang high. When this is done, one then calls the names of the Three Lords thrice, clicks the teeth nine times, and thus a thousand demons are subdued, ten thousand ghosts vanish in form.

If the daoist is hungry or thirsty, he envisions the Three Gods and calls their names; the gods then emit red breath from their mouths, pouring it into his own mouth, which he inhales and swallows, and in a moment he is full.

If the daoist travels at night and the darkness obscures the path, he envisions and calls the Three Gods, who each emit firelight from their mouths, illuminating the way ahead; in an instant, all is clear and bright.

If one encounters danger, calamity, or the place of blades and soldiers, one envisions and calls the Three Gods, shaking the jade bells; the sound fills the six directions within the cosmos, and the dangers and evils no longer arise to harm.

If one seeks longevity or wishes to dispel illness, one must first set the heart upright and lie in peace, then envision and call the Three Lords. The Three Lords then kneel long toward the outside, emitting red breath from their mouths, which pours into one’s body and mouth; one must swallow it fully. The red light surrounds the body everywhere, transforming into fire that burns the body until it fuses with the flame, becoming utterly refined ash. Then one envisions the Four Kings’ breath dispersing the wind, after which the spirit gathers and opens the eyes. Repeating this often, the face becomes like that of a young maiden—this is the foundation of prolonged vision.

In the Chamber of the Grotto, to the left is the Noble Youth Wuying, in the center the Yellow Elder Lord, and to the right the White Primordial Lord; this is the dao of the Flying Perfected. There is a scripture on this in the *Scripture of the Golden Flower*.

In the Palace of the Elixir Field dwells the Primordial True One Emperor Lord and two ministers; the three reside together. This place is the true vehicle of clouds and chariots, controlling the dao of dragons and deer. There is a separate scripture for this.

The Palace of Flowing Pearls is where the Supreme Ultimate Lords and Ministers of Life Fate carry out their dao. After three hundred years, one uses pearl and silk oaths to transmit it.

The Scripture of the Three Officials seeks divine immortals as the path of true persons, practiced in the world. But only those whose bones and forms align with fate, who have true names in the world and encounter the proper conditions, receive notice from the Supreme Ultimate Emperor Lord and are granted it.

In the Jade Emperor’s Palace dwells the Jade Pure Spirit Mother, surname Lian, given name Xian, styled Huangyan, wearing the black and yellow pure spirit sash, her head adorned with a sevenfold vermilion jade coiffure, crowned with the Infinite Merit Crown.

In the Heavenly Court Palace dwells the Supreme Essence True Female, surname Jue, given name Hui, styled Bilie, clad in blue treasure brocade embroidered with divine light and frost gauze of nine colors, her head crowned with a jade treasure flying cloud coiffure, wearing the black and yellow Merit Crown.

In the Supreme True Palace dwells the Supreme Ultimate Empress, surname Xuan, given name Xusheng, styled Bowu, wearing a black gauze flowing light sash embroidered with five-colored phoenix patterns, her head adorned with a seven-treasure black pattern coiffure, crowned with the Infinite Merit Crown.

In the Great Imperial Palace dwells the Most High Lord Empress, surname Qian, given name Hanhai, styled Heyansheng, wearing a seven-treasure flying essence black light cloud brocade sash of nine colors, her head adorned with a ninefold black jade essence cloud coiffure, crowned with the black and yellow Infinite Three Treasures Jade Crown.

This scripture of the Four Palaces is the path of the Female True One transmission to self-attain immortality and seek truth; its dao surpasses that of the Male True One. Beginners find the palace empty and may not approach or hear its essentials; the pure spirit imposes strict prohibitions.

In the Mysterious Elixir Palace sits the Supreme One True Lord, surname Jue, given name Guiying, styled Huaxuan, his form like a newborn infant, seated upon a golden bed beneath a jade canopy, wearing purple embroidered brocade robes, a belt with flowing fire bells; in his left hand he holds the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper, in his right hand the cord of the Northern Pole, sitting upright alone in the Mysterious Elixir Palace.

When the daoist has completed contemplating the Three-in-One, he should then envision and call upon the Supreme Yellow Supreme One True Lord of Supreme Clarity, seeking longevity and prolonged vision. From the Supreme One’s palace, he rests and drinks the clear breath emitted from the Supreme One’s mouth fifty times, then swallows the saliva fifty times. Upon completion, he softly utters this blessing:

“Supreme One True Sovereign, Supreme Yellow Purple Lord, your name is Guiying, styled Huaxuan, golden bed, jade canopy, purple embroidered brocade robes, belt with fire bells, severing evil and eradicating treachery, hands grasping star essence, atop the birth of true reality, sitting upright exhaling breath, let me swallow and take in, speak with me, together peacefully refining the mysterious elixir, cleansing the seven souls, harmonizing the three spirits, spirits and numinous powers attend and guard, enabling me to fly as an immortal, organs self-generate, returning to the visage of a white child, receiving the scripture of Supreme Clarity, under the command of the Lord of Life Fate, all wishes and desires fulfilled, a hundred blessings solely intimate.”

Having done this, one practices it for fourteen years, and together with the Supreme One reaches the cord of the Seven Primes. After eighteen years, one goes to Supreme Clarity to receive the scripture and wear the talisman, commanding eighteen jade youths and jade maidens. One may name each and cultivate them, or focus solely on this dao without necessarily guarding the Three-in-One.

**True Talisman of the Supreme Ultimate Emperor Lord, Treasure Chapter, transmitted by the Supreme Subtle Heavenly Emperor Lord to the Golden Gate Emperor Lord.**

To the right is the True Talisman of the Supreme Ultimate Emperor Lord: six talismans of the Upper Origin, five talismans of the Middle Origin, and five talismans of the Lower Origin. The Most High summons the Three-in-One method of guarding form, on the days of the Beginning of Spring, Spring Equinox, Beginning of Summer, Summer Solstice, Beginning of Autumn, Autumn Equinox, Beginning of Winter, and Winter Solstice. Written in vermilion, at dawn one faces the king and wears one talisman; every sixteen days one wears another, completing sixteen talismans. The later eight solar terms follow the same method. One bows twice to the king and chants:

“Upper Origin One True, guarding the solid cinnabar pellet; Middle Origin One True, calming the spirit in the crimson palace; Lower Origin One True, protecting my life gate; the three origins shine together, preserving life long; summoning spirits and drawing breath, sitting and descending naturally; transforming form and refining body, bones become immortal; hair flying like feathers and gauze, soaring to the imperial dawn.”

Another vermilion talisman is placed in a brocade pouch and worn upon the head; one must not tread upon filth. Wearing the talisman for five years, one may meet true persons; after nine years, one’s numinous vision is thorough. Sitting and standing at death, commanding the six Jia, Heaven grants twelve jade youths and twelve jade maidens, riding clouds and dragons, feasting in the jade palace. The method of guarding the One is the foremost scripture of the Golden Gate Emperor Lord of Supreme Clarity, the exalted jade dao, the ford of immortals, the wondrous secret of all perfected ones. If you can guard the One, the One also guards you; if you can see the One, the One also sees you. One must stand with body and One, body must be One and One must be born. Constantly think of it, awake or asleep, never releasing it—then longevity can be hoped for.
