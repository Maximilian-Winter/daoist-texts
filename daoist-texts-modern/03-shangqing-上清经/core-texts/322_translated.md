### The Register of the Spirit-Flying Six Jia of the Jade Palace of Shangqing

Within the Jade Palace of Shangqing dwell the Spirit-Flying Six Jia and their sixty Jade Maidens. Their secret names and characters are inscribed on the left and right talismans. The Supreme True Nine Capitals’ Supreme Sovereign, the Great Ultimate Four Perfected Ones, received these from the Most High Jade Morning Venerable Dao Lord. On the left and right are the Spirit-Flying Six Jia talismans, also called the Jade Essence True Secrets, the Way in the Midst of Light, and the Scripture of White Feathers and Black Wings Concealed Wandering—these are the spiritual paths of the Spirit-Flying Six Jia.

The spirits of the Six Jia ride upon six dragons in their appointed times, feasting amid the clouds of celebration, gazing over the Six Directions, and returning to the chambers of those who wear their talismans. On the eight festival days, they ride in carriages drawn by white luan birds and black-winged phoenixes, feasting in the perpetual yang’s inverted light, observing the gods and sacred mountains of the eight directions. Returning to the bodies of those who wear their talismans, they harmonize soul and spirit, communicate with the numinous and manifest forms, blend the three breaths with incense, and cause the five viscera to blossom with brilliance. Whether sitting or standing at the moment of death, they summon and command myriad demons, tread sharp edges and brave dangers, summon ten thousand spirits to harmonize, traverse mountains and enter waters, walk along seas and rivers, untroubled by barriers or fears of heights, transform and conceal themselves, summon wind and thunder, raise clouds and rain, sit to command the kitchen of action, enter battle without harm, enter water without wetness, guarded by mountain spirits, welcomed by the Jade Maidens.

Those who wear these talismans for six years will see the Six Jia appear to their bodies, speak with them, receive true scriptures for their children, and attain longevity in Heaven and Earth, the two forces united in the talisman. They must keep separate chambers without mixing, abandon lust and forget desire, calm the mind like a mirror’s reflection—only then can one see and seek.

The Great Ultimate Four Perfected Ones say: The six breaths follow their course through the Ten Heavens; the Six Jia patrol the netherworld. With their talisman, one may vanish and transform without limit; hearing their name supplements one’s celestial truth; practicing their dao enables flight through emptiness and riding the light; wearing their script, the Jade Maidens hold the silk kerchief. Using these six years, one will be recorded in the Azure Palace’s jade slips. After nine years, myriad spirits will guard and serve, and the Perfected Ones will build a chamber for you. After fourteen years, the Three Primal Lords of the Great Element will welcome you with feathers of the three dawns, clothe you in a cloud mantle of purple splendor, ride the eight lights by night, ascend Kunlun by day, wave the tiger banner to summon the festivals, blow phoenix music to sing the profound, myriad spirits will support your carriage, gather wind and summon clouds, with the Great One reins in hand, ascending the morning sun.

The Spirit-Flying Six Jia Jade Maidens on left and right number sixty. Each Jia day at dawn, facing the king’s direction, one closes the moon gate and looks inward, preserving the Jade Maidens of one ten-day cycle of the Six Jia, all coming to stand before me. Their clothing, form, and colors are as above. After a long while, one clicks the teeth six times, swallows saliva sixty times, then softly chants the incantation:

> Left flies, right spirit,  
> Eight lights’ radiant essence,  
> Above grows the exquisite jade chamber,  
> Below blooms the cinnabar and jade,  
> Harmonizing the eight cycles,  
> Governing myriad beings,  
> Divine powers accumulate response,  
> Six breaths refine purity,  
> Cloud palace’s jade splendor,  
> Riding emptiness, following life,  
> Brocade mantle, scarlet skirt,  
> Rosy clouds reflect the purple chamber,  
> Waist belts tiger script,  
> Feathered cords build azure,  
> Hands hold divine talismans,  
> Flowing gold and fiery bells,  
> Waving away evil, repelling demons,  
> Protecting my integrity and virtue,  
> Severing and binding all monsters,  
> Ten thousand evils vanish,  
> Together roaming the Three Primes,  
> Returning old, reversing infancy,  
> Sitting and standing at death,  
> Serving my Six Ding,  
> Fierce beasts guard the body,  
> Following heavenly soldiers,  
> Breathing rivers and streams,  
> Mountains and valleys flow and tilt,  
> Suddenly commanding the kitchen of action,  
> Golden nectar and jade wine,  
> Binding tigers and leopards,  
> Roaring through the netherworld,  
> Commanding ghosts and spirits,  
> Capturing and subduing a thousand spirits,  
> Wishes fulfilled at heart,  
> All matters accomplished,  
> Parting the dao, dispersing the body,  
> Freely transforming form,  
> Supplementing the Perfected Ones above,  
> Heaven and Earth born together,  
> Ears sharp, eyes clear,  
> Seeing through the Yellow Court,  
> Six Jia Jade Maidens,  
> Serve as my envoys.

After the incantation, one closes the eyes. At first, one must hold the thought, sitting upright, hands resting on the knees, unseen by others. If seen, the true light will not unify, thoughts scatter, and the mind will not hold; one must guard against this. Before wearing the talisman, one must first call the Jade Maiden of the current day’s stem-branch name, then softly chant:

> Heaven dark, Earth yellow,  
> Great Void six breaths,  
> Morning wear spirit essence,  
> Divine golden tiger script,  
> Command my truth,  
> Also command my spirit,  
> Scatter form and shadow,  
> Seal the mountain, summon the spirits,  
> Command myriad essences,  
> Sitting death, standing life,  
> High roaming Shangqing,  
> North facing Jade Morning.

The Great Ultimate Jade Essence True Secret upper talisman begins on the Yǐchǒu day, worn twice daily: once at dawn by women, once at midnight on the eight festival days.

These two talismans are the ancestral talismans of the Spirit-Flying Six Jia. Before wearing the talisman, one must fast for six days, then wear it. After sixty days, one may wear the talisman of the sixty Jade Maidens. These two talismans summon spirits and open the numinous, communicate with myriad essences. Long-term wearing will not fail; one flies as an immortal and lives long. Having worn the sixty Jade Maiden talismans, one should use this talisman as well, cultivating both. Male and female talismans correspond to their names. Avoid filth, death, and mourning households; do not share sleeping or resting places with others; do not lend or borrow clothing; abstain from the five pungent spices and meat of the six domestic animals. Especially avoid contact with women; this is strictly forbidden, lest one lose spirit and soul, generate evil and lose nature, suffer calamities across three lifetimes, and die as a lower ghost. Always burn incense at the head of the sleeping place.

The above sixty-two talismans were received by the Great Ultimate Four Perfected Ones from the Most High Great Dao Lord. Those who receive them must fast, purify, and be sincere; bathe to remove the five impurities; dispel filthy dust leaks; cut off lustful desires; correct the eyes to preserve the six essences; concentrate thoughts on the jade truth; scatter incense smoke in the chamber; seclude the body in a solitary room; accumulate fine hairs; harmonize soul and preserve the center; imitate the five ways of divine birth in the three palaces; dispel contention among ordinary peers; guard silence to awaken response. The Six Jia spirits will descend and appear within a year. Those who can refine this dao with precision will surely ascend as immortals. Those who believe and serve become numinous persons; those who do not believe will perish and become lower ghosts.

The Dao of the Spirit-Flying Six Jia’s numinous reflections of Shangqing must be transmitted only to those who attain utmost truth. They quickly bring about communication and descent, and the Spirit-Flying is easily aroused. With long and diligent cultivation, sitting and standing at death, long observing myriad transformations, commanding the kitchen of action to sudden arrival. The Perfected One of Jiuyi, Xu Weiyuan, once received this method on Mount Zhongyue from Song Dexuan. Dexuan was a man of the Zhou kings’ era, who wore this Spirit-Flying Six Jia talisman, attained the dao, could travel three thousand li in one day, often transformed into crow beasts, and attained the dao of true numinosity, originally on Mount Song. Weiyuan followed him long and thus received this method. Having completed the path, he now dwells on Mount Jiuyi. Women such as Guo Shaoyao, Zhao Aier, Wang Lulian, and others also received this method and attained the dao, numbering several tens, some roaming the Mysterious Isles, some dwelling on the eastern flower directions’ various terraces, now seen residing on Mount Nan Yue. Lady Wei said: This Guo Shaoyao was the son of General Guo Qian of Yangping in Han’s Liaodong, fond of sincerity from youth; the Perfected One thus gave him the Six Jia. Zhao Aier was the niece of Liu Yu, governor of Youzhou, fond of the dao; after corpse liberation, she received this talisman. Wang Lulian was the daughter of Fan Lingwang Bogang, gate captain under Wei Emperor Wen, also a dao scholar; one day she suddenly abandoned her husband Li Ziqi. Li Ziqi was a man of Sizhōu Wei, descendant of King Qinghe; he often said this woman was madly wandering, one day lost without trace.

The Spirit-Flying Six Jia of Shangqing, wearing this true talisman, roam and travel the eight directions. Practicing this true scripture, one will find the proper person. According to the Bright Disciplines of the Four Extremes, those who transmit the inner scriptures of Shangqing all take oaths and pledges, then proclaim them. In seven hundred years, only six have transmitted it, limited and never leaked again. Those who receive the talisman must fast seven days, prepare the altar with firewood and incense, ten-foot altar, six pairs of golden rings, six taels of blue silk, to replace cutting hair and ascend the platform, swear by blood to break the contract, pledging not to leak the spiritual talisman’s secret. If one breaks the pledge and betrays trust, one will suffer the trial of the wind blade, fall into the river of accumulated night, be scourged by the stones of Meng Mountain, and fill Mengjin. Masters of the scripture, upon receiving the method, must give it to the poor, lonely, sick, and elderly, not use it alone. If one does not follow the regulations, the Three Officials will investigate, and death will be as a lower ghost. One must earnestly respect and be cautious.
