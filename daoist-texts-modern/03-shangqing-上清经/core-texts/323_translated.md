### Supreme Clarity Jade Palace Numinous Flight of the Six Jia Left and Right Superior Talismans

Within the Supreme Clarity Jade Palace, the numinous flight of the Six Jia is accompanied by sixty Jade Maidens. Their secret names and characters are recorded in the Left and Right Superior Talismans. The Supreme Ultimate’s Nine Divisions’ Supreme Emperor True Person received these from the Jade Dawn Great Dao Lord. The Left and Right Numinous Flight of the Six Jia Talismans are also called the Jade Essence True Secret, the Way in the Bright Midst, and the White Feather Black Wing Hidden Wandering Superior Scripture—these are the numinous flight Six Jia divine paths.

The gods of the Six Jia ride on six dragons, feasting upon clouds of celebration, gazing upon the Six Directions, then returning to subdue those who wear the talisman in their chambers. On festival days, they ride the chariot of the White Luan, driving the black-winged phoenix, feasting in the constant sun’s inverted light, observing the gods of the Eight Directions and the sacred mountains. Those who wear the talisman have their bodies harmonized and their souls united; their spiritual communication and form are perfected; the three breaths blend with incense; the five viscera bloom with vitality. Whether sitting, standing, or lying down, they command ten thousand demons, tread on sharp edges and precipitous cliffs, and receive myriad blessings in harmony. They traverse mountains and enter waters, follow coasts and walk rivers, unbound by ferries or bridges, unafraid of perilous peaks. They transform and conceal themselves, summon wind and call thunder, raise clouds and bring rain, sit to summon the kitchen’s offerings, enter battle unharmed, enter water unsoaked. Mountain gods serve as their guards; Jade Maidens come forth to welcome them.

Those who wear it for six years will see the Six Jia manifest in their bodies and speak with them. They will be granted the True Scripture of the Sons, live long as Heaven and Earth endure, and the two images will harmonize with the talisman. Separate your chambers and avoid mixing with lust or reckless desire. With a tranquil heart and mirror-like clarity, then you may see and seek.

The Four True Persons of the Supreme Ultimate say: The six energies circulate smoothly through the Ten Heavens; the Six Jia make their rounds through the netherworld. Possessing this talisman, one may vanish and transform without fixed form; hearing its name replenishes one’s celestial truth; practicing its way allows one to soar through emptiness and ride the light; wearing its script, the Jade Maidens hold their scarves. Using it for six years, one may inscribe achievements on jade slips in the Azure Palace, record names and titles, with myriad gods guarding and the True Persons constructing the chamber. Practicing for fourteen years, the Three Primal Lords of the Great Simplicity welcome you with feathers of the Three Dawns, clad in purple mist cloud robes, roaming the Eight Scenes by night, ascending the tiger carriage by day, singing with phoenix flutes, playing the mysterious zither, ten thousand gods supporting the chariot, gathering wind and summoning clouds. The Great One reins the bridle; the white sun rises at dawn.

The Six Jia Numinous Flight Left and Right Jade Maidens number sixty by name. Each Jia day at dawn, facing the kingly direction, close your eyes and look inward, preserving the Jade Maidens of the Six Jia’s ten-day cycle. They all come to stand before me, their garments and forms as above. After a long while, I click my teeth six times, swallow saliva sixty times, then softly chant:

> Left flight, right spirit, Eight Scenes’ radiant essence,  
> Above, planted in the jade chamber; below, blooming with cinnabar and jade.  
> Harmonizing the eight cycles, commanding myriad beings,  
> Divine power accumulates response, six energies refined and pure.  
> Cloud officials and jade blossoms, riding the void to follow life,  
> Brocade robes and flying skirts, rosy clouds illuminate the purple chamber,  
> Waist adorned with tiger script, feathers bestowed in blue,  
> Hands grasp divine talismans, flowing gold and fiery bells,  
> Waving away evil and repelling demons, protecting my integrity,  
> Cleaving and restraining countless monsters, all evil extinguished and leveled,  
> Traveling with the Three Luminaries, returning old to infant,  
> Sitting, standing, lying down, attending my six dings,  
> Fierce beasts guard the body, accompanied by heavenly soldiers,  
> Breathing rivers and mountains, mountains and rivers flow and tilt,  
> Finally summoning the kitchen’s offerings, golden nectar and jade essence,  
> Binding tigers and leopards, shouting and commanding the netherworld,  
> Commanding ghosts and spirits, subduing a thousand essences,  
> Wishes follow the heart, all matters succeed,  
> Parting the dao and dispersing the body, freely transforming form,  
> Supplementing the True Person above, Heaven and Earth born together,  
> Ears sharp and eyes bright, penetrating the Yellow Court,  
> Six Jia Jade Maidens, serve as my emissaries.

After the incantation, close your eyes. At first, when preserving thought, sit upright, place your hands on your knees, and avoid being seen by others. If seen, the true light will not be uniform, and thoughts will scatter. Keep your mind focused without wandering; this must be done with utmost care.

Before donning the talisman, first call the Jade Maiden’s name of the direct day. Then softly chant:

> Heaven’s mystery, Earth’s yellow, Supreme Void’s six energies,  
> Morning attire of numinous essence, divine golden tiger script,  
> Command my truth, command my spirit,  
> Scatter form and shadow, seal the mountains and summon spirits,  
> Command myriad gods, sit in death and stand in life,  
> Roam high in Supreme Clarity, face north to Jade Dawn.

After the incantation, then wear the talisman. The talisman’s script is truly essential as follows:

Inside the scroll, talismans are written in cinnabar.

Supreme Ultimate Jade Essence True Secret Superior Talisman

The right talisman is to be worn beginning on the day of Jiazi for two days: once at dawn by men, and again at the midpoint of the eight solar terms each day.

Supreme Ultimate Jade Essence True Secret Superior Talisman

The right talisman is to be worn beginning on the day of Yichou for two days: once at dawn by women, and again at midnight on the eight solar terms.

The above two talismans are the ancestral talismans of the numinous flight Six Jia. Those who wish to wear the talisman must first fast for six days before donning it. Wearing it for sixty days enables one to wear the sixty Jade Maiden talismans. These two talismans chiefly summon divine spirits, communicate with myriad essences, and long-term wearing does not fail—one flies as an immortal and lives long.

Having worn the sixty Jade Maiden talismans, one must also cultivate these talismans in tandem. Men and women officials each use according to their names. Avoid filth and decay, the rites of death and mourning households; do not share beds or sleeping quarters with others; clothing must not be borrowed; abstain from the five pungent spices and meat of the six domestic animals; avoid contact with women, especially strictly forbidden. Otherwise, one’s spirit and soul will be lost, evil and loss of nature arise, calamity strikes the three breaths, and death leads to becoming a lower ghost. Always burn incense at the head of the sleeping grove.

There are sixty-two talismans here, received by the Four True Persons of the Supreme Ultimate Upper Palace from the Most High Dao Lord. Those who receive them must be pure and vigilant in heart, cleanse the five accumulations of filth and defilement, eliminate dust, turbidity, and lustful desires, correct the eyes to preserve the six essences, concentrate thought on jade truth with incense smoke filling the chamber, seclude the body in a solitary room, accumulate virtue and merit, harmonize the soul to maintain the center, emulate the five spirits roaming the three palaces of life, sever contention and competition among ordinary folk, maintain silence to awaken response. The gods of the Six Jia will descend within a year. If one can diligently cultivate this dao, one will surely ascend as an immortal. Those who believe and serve become numinous beings; those who do not will sink into the nine springs of the underworld.

The Supreme Clarity Six Jia Numinous Reflection Way must be transmitted only to those most refined and true, so that they may attain full communication and descent. The True Person of Jiuyi, Xu Weiyuan, once received this method at Mount Zhongyue from Song Dexuan. Dexuan was a man of the Zhou Xuan King’s time, who wore this Numinous Flight Six Jia talisman and attained the dao. He could travel three thousand li in a single day, change shape into birds and beasts multiple times, and possessed the true numinous dao. He now dwells at Mount Song. Weiyuan followed him long and received this method; having completed the way, he now resides at Mount Jiuyi. Women such as Guo Shaoyao, Zhao Aier, Wang Lulian, and others also received this method and attained the dao. Some roam the Mysterious Isles, others dwell on the Eastern Flower’s many terraces, and are seen living there now.

Madam Wei of the Southern Peak said: Guo Shaoyao was the daughter of General Guo Qian of Yangping in the Han dynasty. From youth, she loved the dao with sincerity, and a True Person thus taught her the Six Jia technique. Zhao Aier was the wife of Liu Yu, governor of Youzhou, and sister of Deputy Zhao Gai. She loved the dao, attained corpse liberation, and then received this talisman. Wang Lulian was the city gate captain under Wei Emperor Wen, and daughter of Prince Fanling Bozhou. She also studied the dao, and one day suddenly vanished. Her husband Li Ziqi entered Mount Luhun, where a True Person again taught him this method. Ziqi was the Sima Wei man, Duke of Qinghe. It was often said this woman was wild and wandering, suddenly losing her place.

The Supreme Clarity Six Jia Numinous Flight hides and retreats; wearing this true talisman allows roaming the Eight Directions. To practice this true scripture, one must find the right person. According to the Bright Disciplines of the Four Extremes, those who transmit the Supreme Clarity inner scriptures all swear solemn oaths, reciting the sacred names. Once every seven hundred years, the method is entrusted to six people. After the allotted year, it must not be revealed again.

Those who receive the transmission must fast seven days, prepare a ritual altar with sixty feet of mulberry and white silk, six pairs of golden rings, two pounds of blue silk, and twenty-two feet each of five-colored silk ribbons to replace hair cutting upon ascending the altar. They swear blood oaths to uphold and serve the numinous talisman, promising never to divulge the jade names. If one breaks the oath, seven generations of ancestors and oneself will suffer the trial of the Wind Blade, journey to the River of Accumulated Night, move the Stone of Mengshan to fill Mengjin.

Masters of the scripture who receive the method must give generously to the poor, lonely, sick, elderly, and weak; it must not be used selfishly. If one violates the regulations, the Three Officials will record and investigate, and death will be as a lower ghost. One must reverently and carefully observe these rules.

#1 The phrase 遗淫妄欲 is likely a scribal error for ‘dispelling lust and forgetting desire’.
