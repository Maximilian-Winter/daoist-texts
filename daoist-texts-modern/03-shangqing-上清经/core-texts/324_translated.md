### Scripture of the Supreme Clarity’s Curved Plain Instructions and Charms

Also called the Great Scripture of the Nine Heavens’ Phoenix Qi and Mysterious Hill

Granted by the True Person of the Left of the Supreme Ultimate

The Most High Patriarch bestowed it upon the True Person of the Left, to transmit to the Azure Youth Sovereigns of the Eastern Sea Palaces, so that it might be passed on to the upper disciples who bear jade names and are destined to be divine immortals and true persons. Wearing it for thirty years, one may behold the Three Primal Lords and welcome the Sacred Sovereign at the Golden Gate of Supreme Clarity. For seven hundred years, two persons listen and transmit. Within the fast, the stern summons call forth the clang of completion; the oath of blood on golden silk is sworn, replacing the blood covenant to ascend the altar.

〔Curved Plain〕#1 Instructions and Charms

The Curved Plain commands the ghosts of the Six Heavens with awe, marshals the myriad spirits of the essences, commands the Five Emperors, governs the Five Sacred Mountains, seals the rivers and marshes, and summons a hundred ghosts.

The instructions and charms capture the tigers and leopards of the famous mountains, tame the dragons of the hundred rivers, command ten thousand ghosts, and drive away ten thousand evils.

All the above talismans are written in vermilion.

Purity and Clarity

White silk, thirty feet long, serves as the seal to preserve the blood essence, replacing the blood oath of the Curved Plain; without fasting, one must not open or receive the talisman. Plain brocade, twenty feet long, serves as the seal to preserve the immortal’s covenant, symbolizing the seven hundred years of triple transmission oath. It is worn entering sickness, water, fire, mountains, or chambers, always accompanied by the talisman. Three pairs of golden rings preserve the great longevity covenant, serving as the pledge to keep the heart unblocked. Without this document, the Daoist may not behold the Three Primal Lords. The incense weighs nine taels, serving as the seal to preserve the communication with spirits, as the pact of the nether spirits; without it, one cannot summon the ghosts of the Six Heavens. Males receive it facing north, their master facing south. Females receive it facing south, their master facing north. When submitting the document and offering sacrifice, the master’s instructions are orally transmitted. When granted, one faces north. Males receive it every ten years, with an additional fast and submission of the document. Females receive it every ten years, with one sacrifice. The talisman, wine, and preserved meat are arranged within a chamber; the Most High Venerable True Person of Supreme Clarity and the Most High Patriarch’s Palace officiate the precepts. When the recipient recites the talisman orally, no written text is used in the incense oath.

The Most High Immortal of Supreme Clarity, the Cloud of Radiance True Person, opens the great heavenly talisman. The Most High Patriarch descends to receive the Five Sacred Mountain Sovereigns. Wearing it removes calamity and banishes misfortune, repels evil and expels demons, guards the myriad essences, drives away the hundred birds, commands ghosts and spirits, extends life by ten years, restores the soul and reverses aging, securing the body’s long preservation. Also called the Contract of Certain Birth in the Three Heavens.

The Nine Heavens’ Venerable Lord commands ten white plain jade maidens, who are arrayed on the left and right of the disciples.

All the above talismans, except for casual notes on color, are written in vermilion.

The Great Scripture of the Nine Heavens’ Phoenix Qi and Mysterious Hill True Scripture, the Immortal Code of the Mysterious Capital Venerable Lord, is granted to be worn for three days, entrusted with blue silk, three pairs of rings, and incense ribbons as the covenant of granting. It transmits records of the Grand Year, without delay or deception, without malice or illness, practicing benevolence and accumulating virtue, preserving the true spirit and thought. Those who wear the record are immortals.

This single line above, the clerk writes for personal wearing. Originally, the sun, moon, and five planets constitute the Seven Primal Disclosures; beyond these, there are five additional talismans, likely from the *Scripture of Dispelling Demons*. However, the *Scripture of Dispelling Demons* contains forty-nine talismans, all left blank in the scripture, each with varying breadth and scope. Here, only a few remain; the rest are scattered. There is also a yellow talisman, which the scripture says comes from the *True Decree*, stating it is the talisman of the Northern Emperor of the Abundant Terrace, as in the *Jade Horse Scripture*, but this is not fully verified. Otherwise, the Seven Primal Disclosure talismans have rough methods of use in the transmitted scriptures, but here is the personal copy, so no explanation is given. It is fitting to follow the *True Decree*, using multicolored scripts and varied pigments for inscription, receiving and wearing it accordingly. The order of the Abundant Terrace says: whoever carries this talisman, places it in a deep purple pouch and wears it upon the head.
