### The Supreme Clarity Three Origins Jade Inspection Three Origins Distribution Scripture

The High Supreme Three Origins Distribution Scripture is the scripture of the Three Celestial Perfected of Supreme Clarity. It is the chapter of the Jade Inspection flying through the void from the Upper Truth, the Upper Origin Inspection of Heaven’s Great Register, the Lower Origin Inspection of Earth’s Jade Script, and the Middle Origin Inspection of the Immortal Perfected Scripture. Such treasured chapters, the High Supreme all inscribe as Golden Elixir texts, placed within natural cloud brocade pouches, sealed with the seals of the Three Origins Treasure Spirits, and stored in the Palace of Great Abundance above the Nine Heavens, in the Golden Terrace Jade Chamber’s Nine-Twisting Elixir Room.

The Southern Pole Upper Origin Lord commands, with seven hundred Jade Maidens of the Upper Origin Vermilion Palace as attendants, guarded by the True Spirits of the Supreme One’s Heart, and further by three hundred Jade Youths of the Spiritual Void, who hold fans and scatter incense. In the first year of Clear Void, the Primordial Heavenly King taught beneath the Pavilion of Radiant Clouds in the Great Cloud Chamber, imparting to the Three Celestial Jade Youths, who command the Three Dao, overseeing myriad immortals. According to the Way of the Supreme Truth, after seven thousand years of transmission, one becomes a Realized Person; without engraving the scripture’s mysterious diagrams, recording them before birth, one must not rashly reveal the spiritual writings. The High Supreme, aided by the Five Emperors’ Divine Soldiers, inspects for negligence; its prohibitions are especially strict.

The Most High Dao Lord received it from the Ancient Profound Master, passing it to the Immortal King of the Mysterious Capital; the Queen Mother of the West received it from the King of the Nine Heavens, passing it to the Great Emperor of Fusang; the Great Emperor passed it to the Later Sage, the Golden Gate Emperor; the Golden Gate Emperor passed it to the Supreme Prime Minister, the Azure Youth Lord. Now one copy is stored in the Eastern Flower Palace, to be transmitted according to the ritual over seven thousand years until one becomes a Realized Person. The Most High Dao Lord commands the Five Elders Immortal Capitals to seal the Four Extremes and Five Emperors, to assist and guard the spiritual writings, inspecting for leakage. Those who falsely speak of the chapters are punished by the Wind Blade; those who lightly transmit or neglect them are held accountable by the Seven Ancestors, bearing the burden of examination and long servitude to the ghost officials.

The Three Origins chapter says: The Jade Inspection text originates before the Nine Mysterious Void Caverns, binding the qi of Nature to form the jade script. The Nine Heavens divide and judge; the Three Dao unfold and clarify; the Three Origins distribute qi, inspecting and commanding the Three Perfected. Without this text in Heaven, the Three Lights grow dim, the Five Emperors err in position, the Nine Cycles reverse, and the Seven Mansions rush with essence. Without this text on Earth, the Nine Soils sink into abyss, the Five Mountains collapse, rivers and hills overturn. Without this text in study, Immortal officials do not descend, Earth officials do not operate, the names of the Mysterious are not recorded above the Nine Heavens, learning is in vain, and the Dao cannot be realized. Its method is profound and subtle, the secret chapters of the Three Origins; those who obtain its text are elevated to the rank of Immortal Minister.

The Upper Origin Jade Inspection, inspecting Heaven’s Great Register, contains all the Nine Heavens’ distributed qi, mysterious diagrams, and true texts; the Nine Heavens’ official titles command and govern the Celestial Perfected. Those who fully possess its text can roam above the Nine Heavens, living as long as kalpas. Those who see its chapters know the Nine Heavens’ names, the revolving birth palaces, transforming to become more immortal. Constantly cultivating for nine years, one can receive and welcome the Holy Lord at the Supreme Clarity Palace.

The Lower Origin Jade Inspection, inspecting Earth’s Jade Script, contains all the Nine Heavens’ distributed qi, mysterious texts, inspecting the spirits of the Nine Earths. Those who obtain its text can fly through the great void; the Nine Yin dare not restrain the soul of the fate; one can roam the Five Mountains, tread rivers and springs; myriad spirits bow in homage, ten thousand gods welcome. Those who see its chapters transform to ascend the Nine Heavens, revolve the wheel of rebirth, and through nine transformations become immortal. Cultivating its dao for nine years, one can enter water without sinking, enter fire without burning; the Three Origins descend, the white sun rises to Heaven.

The Middle Origin Jade Inspection, inspecting the Immortal Perfected Scripture, contains all the Nine Heavens’ hidden texts, the seals of immortal destiny. Those who fully possess its text have Immortal officials attending the court, descending to bring divine mushrooms and natural spiritual medicines. Cultivating its dao for nine years, Heavenly Immortals descend truly, Earthly Immortals descend spiritually, Flying Immortals descend in sedan chairs, riding the void to ascend to Jade Clarity. Those who see its chapters know the Nine Heavens’ names, revolve birth palaces, and transform to become more immortal.

The Three Origins chapter says: Without the Jade Inspection text, the spirits of the Nine Earths do not come to respectfully welcome; the mountain and sea spirits do not guard the body; Heavenly Immortals, Earthly Immortals, and Five Mountains’ Flying Immortals do not descend in cloud carriages; above the Nine Heavens, the mysterious names are not received. Without chanting the jade seals, Heaven does not send the true; ten thousand demons invade the light; seeking flight only sinks. Wearing the Jade Inspection, the Three Origins align in wheel; going out into emptiness and entering the void, transformations without interruption; treading water and fire; soaring through the Nine Mysterious; the body is a purple void cavern; the spirit reflects a golden countenance; seventy-two appearances shine brightly in the great void; presiding over the Three Heavens; the rank commands all immortals. Therefore, unless one is already a Realized Person, one must not lightly transmit.

### Upper Origin Inspection of Heaven’s Great Register

The Supreme Clarity Jade Radiance Elixir Spirit Cavern Heaven Upper Origin Three Origins Jade Inspection Text, bestowed to the Supreme Clarity Realized Person, worn to roam the heavens, inspecting and commanding the great void, overseeing all the Perfected. Those who wear this text attain the rank equal to Spiritual Immortals; all heavens respectfully protect; the Five Emperors command the reception; after nine years, one may see the Three Origins Lord and be received at the Supreme Clarity Palace.

Receiving this text requires fasting for nine days, writing with a blue brush on nine chi of yellow silk, offering it at the mountain of one’s birth star, then wearing it. If after nine years one has not ascended, one must again offer sacrifice, cast the text into the blue smoke of the sky, then receive from the Supreme Clarity Jade Radiance Palace a five-colored cloud chariot to escort the wearer’s body.

In the first year of Clear Void, in the year of Gengyin, ninth month, ninth day, the Primordial Heavenly King, on the day of Jiazhichen, purified the Supreme Clarity Palace, declaring the covenant: “No supreme, no peak; no color, no light; no form, no name; no ancestor, no clan; no limit, cavernous clarity, nine mysteries, nature without number of kalpas.” The Dao bestowed the Three Origins Jade Inspection text to the Three Celestial Jade Youths, to entrust later students with mysterious names. Those who are to become Supreme Clarity Realized Persons are fixed in the Elixir Terrace’s Golden Treasury Jade Tablet, purple writings, jade slips, to receive the Holy Lord’s escort flying to the Supreme Clarity Palace, bowing and looking up to the Supreme Clarity Cavernous Clarity Nature official titles, attending the Perfected, inspecting Heaven to summon Immortals, controlling demons and spirits, summoning cloud chariots, escorting certain Jia individuals—all as the Supreme Truth’s Nine Heavens covenant text.

The Upper Origin Inspection of Heaven’s Great Register text is written with a blue brush on nine chi of yellow silk and worn on the body. The writing must be offered at the mountain of one’s birth star, sacrifice to the Celestial Perfected, report to the Nine Mysteries, covenant with the Five Spirits, then wear it. If after nine years the Dao has not descended, one must prepare two copies, as prescribed, ascend the mountain, offer sacrifice, then burn them; scatter the ashes into the blue smoke of the sky; bury one copy deep nine chi at the mountain of one’s birth star. This is called reporting above to the Nine Heavens, below to the Five Mountains’ Spirit Mountains, and in the middle to myriad gods, to gain eternal life.

### Lower Origin Inspection of Earth’s Jade Script

The Three Origins Mysterious Terrace Jade Inspection Purple Script, also called the Nine Heavens True Scripture Primordial Inspection of Earth’s Register, also called the Three Origins Tiger Scripture, also called Flying Celestial Upper Truth, is to inform the myriad spirits of the Six Heavens, control mountains and rivers, and inspect the spirits of the Nine Earths. Wearing the text commands nine thousand Jade Maidens; in peaceful times one may receive the Holy Lord at the Supreme Clarity Palace. The recipient writes with yellow brush on blue silk, sacrifices at the mountain of their birth star, then wears it. If after nine years one has not ascended, one must write another copy and burn it, scattering ashes into the blue smoke of the sky; write yet another copy and bury it three chi deep at the mountain of one’s birth star. Wearing this text one may roam the eight directions, traverse the Five Mountains, tread river sources; control earth spirits and command myriad gods. After nine years, one may ride the Three Origins chariot and ascend to the Three Origins Palace. One must not rashly enter defiled places or touch the Celestial Perfected; lightly revealing or proclaiming brings the Seven Ancestors’ heavy responsibility, death, and loss of immortality.

---

### Middle Origin Inspection of the Immortal Perfected Scripture

The Immortal Perfected Scripture, also called the Supreme Truth Yin-Yang Spirit Register Three Origins Chapter, is the hidden text of the Three Heavens’ Nine Spirits. Heaven and Earth have great kalpas, passing through eight thousand kalpas; its text reveals the Three Origins Mysterious Terrace, directly corresponding to three hundred persons and ninety-one Jade Maidens. The wearer’s form and spirit all receive the title of Natural Jade Immortal. Without this text, form and spirit do not transform; defiled souls wander; wandering unsettled, spirit mingles with evil; spirit mingling with evil brings the time of decay. Form and spirit untransformed cannot summon Immortal officials or command the Upper Truth, even reciting the jade seals ten thousand times. Ten thousand jade seals are all the Nine Heavens Supreme Truth myriad gods’ hidden names; reciting them startles the Nine Heavens, binding myriad immortals. Without the Immortal Inspection text, lightly commanding Immortal officials shakes the Nine Heavens; Immortals do not descend, Heaven does not accept the sound; soul flies and spirit scatters; spirit panics and qi flees; palaces collapse; infants wail and perish; heavenly demons cause calamity; the body turns to ashes. Those who study this text do not cultivate but become immortal; in peaceful times, the Holy Lord is received at the Supreme Clarity Palace. Without mysterious diagrams or imperial tablets engraving elixir writings, one must not rashly reveal the treasured chapters; lightly leaking brings the Seven Ancestors’ heavy responsibility, long closure by ghost officials, loss of life, and no further immortality.

The Obscure Supreme Upper Truth Three Origins Immortal Immortal Qi Nine Spirits Hidden Character Text is the book in the central tower of the Western Sand Direction. Received by the Southern Pole Upper Origin, the Yellow Upper Truth Assistant Heavenly Origin Inspects Immortal Soul. Those who wear this text have Immortal officials attend the court; after one hundred days of entering the chamber and contemplating spirit, they see the Upper Origin Lord, who bestows the true scripture, naturally flying to the Supreme Clarity Palace. Without this text, one cannot walk the Immortal Dao or summon the true; the body suffers calamity.

The Mysterious Supreme Upper Flying Heaven Middle Scripture Inspection Immortal Text, engraved on the Three Origins Terrace, was produced by the Ten Thousand Beginnings Master to transmit to the High Supreme person, summoning Immortals and bringing forth truth. The recipient sacrifices to the Five Mountains, contemplates for one hundred days, sees a three-headed figure descending to the chamber. Without this text, one must not rashly seek Immortals on the Eight Festivals; the body suffers calamity. Wearing it, the spirit and truth communicate; twelve Jade Youths are given; it is said that what is recited is heard in the Nine Heavens. Lightly leaking brings the Seven Ancestors’ heavy responsibility; the Five Mountains’ talismans control demons and spirits to examine and punish guilty souls.

The Nine Heavens Dragon Scripture Three Origins Void Cavern Jade Inspection Flying Mystic Text, engraved and titled at the Nine Heavens’ Three Passes Gate, commands prohibition for all Heaven Realized Persons. Reciting the Nine Heavens’ upper scriptures without possessing this text is punished by the Nine Heavens’刺奸 (刺奸: “刺奸” here is “刺奸” as a severe heavenly punishment). Those who wear this text have the Nine Heavens’ Prime Minister summon the Inspection Heaven Origin, commanding Immortal officials. After one year of intense contemplation, one may see the Nine Heavens True King, or see one person with nine heads, riding a nine-colored phoenix, descending to the fate form. Seeing this, do not fear; this Nine Heavens True King is the chief recorder of the Upper Truth. But one must face south, prostrate, and open to plead for Immortals; one will then receive the Nine Heavens’ scriptures. Without this text, one must not lightly recite the Thirty-Nine Chapter Great Cavern True Scripture; violating this brings the Seven Ancestors’ heavy responsibility; the body is punished by the Nine Heavens’刺奸, and within one hundred days one’s life will be extinguished.

The Primordial Mysterious Void Flying Heaven Middle Scripture Three Origins Jade Inspection Text, engraved by the Primordial Heavenly King on the Golden Rampart Terrace, transmitted through ten thousand kalpas. Seeing this text, the Four Extremes immediately write their names at Eastern Flower. Wearing it, contemplating for three hundred days, eyes do not look elsewhere, heart has no other thoughts, one will see the Primordial Heavenly King. Seeing the Primordial Heavenly King grants ten thousand years of life.

Without this text, one must not enter famous mountains, roam the Five Mountains, or walk the Flying Immortal Dao. The Five Mountains will not accept one; humans and demons will attack the body; great calamity is certain.

The Supreme Truth Golden Scripture Nine Heavens Upper Void Hidden Text, written on the Phoenix Birth Terrace of the Nine Heavens’ Parents, directly corresponding to eight hundred persons; after nine thousand years, the Nine Heavens open once; when the Nine Heavens open, nine suns shine together in the East. This text naturally illuminates those who attain the Dao, above the Southern Veranda. If there is a mysterious name imperial register, the Four Perfected also descend to bestow on the fate body. Those who possess this text, after nine hundred days of focused contemplation and steady spirit, can see the Nine Heavens’ Parents. Seeing the Nine Heavens’ Parents means no more death or disappearance. Without this text, lightly practicing the ten thousand repetitions of the Dao, summoning Immortal truth, the body will surely suffer calamity; the Seven Ancestors assign servitude; no further immortality.

On the year, month, day, a certain mountain Realized Person, a certain Jia, from teacher a certain Jia, swore to receive the text, now ascending the Mysterious Altar, reporting to Heaven and receiving the mandate; a certain mountain teacher a certain Jia, closing the Five Emperors, Five Mountains, Three Officials, Nine Prefectures, Upper Truth, Four Departments, upholding the text’s prohibition, as the Supreme Truth ritual forbids disclosure. Wearing it, roaming the heavens, earth, waters, famous mountains, countless natural Heavenly Officials all respectfully welcome; demons are destroyed and Immortals descend; flying through the great void, receiving the Holy Lord at the Supreme Clarity Palace. The Nine Heavens shall cast the text to the Nine Heavens’ certain Jia; lightly disrespecting the heavenly text, rashly revealing to others, a certain Jia will be held accountable by the Seven Ancestors and ghost officials; the body will bear the Wind Blade examination; death will bear the Nine Origins’ servitude; one dares not feign immortality.

The scriptures are all written on yellow silk with blue brush; the four sides framed in vermilion brush, the treasure secret of the Celestial Perfected. The recipient fasts for seventy days, or twenty-seven days, or seven days. Disciples bring five taels of refined gold, ninety chi of phoenix-patterned gauze, thirty-two chi of green silk, ascend with the master to the mountain of one’s birth star, receive the Three Origins text, seat facing north, set incense, vegetables, cakes, and fruits on a large plate; nine sheng of clear oil set with nine lamps, arranged in a seat; place a five-chi scarlet gauze cloth to set the text separately in the center; place a separate seal token to the east; disciples face west and prostrate; master faces north and knocks teeth thirty-six times, chanting:

“Today I report above, Celestial Perfected scatter spirits, eight lights wander, nine emperors attend court, Three Origins untie belts, upper pass Three Pure Ones, this day grows full, myriad wishes prosper and are correct, respectfully ascending the mysterious mountain, reporting and covenanting with the Five Spirits, offering fruits to summon the true, to express utmost sincerity; Four Departments and Five Emperors, oversee my form; Celestial Perfected come to descend; my Dao is cavernous and clear; carrying the covenant and alliance, flying to ascend Supreme Clarity.”

Finished, swallowing thirty-six breaths, heart bows to the Five Directions, then faces north, kneeling long to report:

“Nine Heavens Great Void Supreme Emptiness Mysterious Spirit High Supreme Primordial Dao Lord, Supreme Clarity Jade Emperor, myriad holy great Immortal Spirit Officials overseeing True True Immortals, Four Departments, Emperor Lords, I formerly followed my first teacher, Mountain Teacher Zhang Jun, received the Three Origins Jade Inspection Secret Solid Spiritual Chapter, dared not lightly proclaim; the nine-five accelerated kalpa, spiritual fortune shifts; the Holy Lord presides; selecting imperial ministers to supplement the Upper Truth. Now a certain mountain teacher, a certain Jia, with a calm and quiet heart, seeking Immortal study and truth, accumulated but not descended; now the heart aspires to the High Supreme, opening oath and reporting spirit, receiving the treasured chapter, earnestly hoping the Immortals immediately open the path, as the Supreme Truth covenant; Heavenly Immortals descend, overseeing and reflecting on certain Jia’s body; cultivating thoroughly, to attain true Dao, flying through the mysterious void, ascending into the Three Pure Ones. Lightly revealing or telling others, proclaiming heavenly texts, certain Jia will bear life and death parents, Seven Ancestors’ roots, long closure of hell, ten thousand kalpas no pardon, body perishes under ghost officials, dare not again be Immortal.”

Finished, the master reads the text to completion, rises and stands long, holding the text in the left hand; disciple kneels long, receiving the text with the right hand; both point their remaining fingers to the northwest corner of heaven; disciple looks up and prays:

“Report to the Nine Void, swear to the Five Spirits, receive the heavenly text; dare to violate the covenant words, lightly reveal and expose, doubt and betray Celestial Perfected, life and death parents, Seven Ancestors’ roots, and body’s long demise, together bear the river source, Three Paths and Five Sufferings, ten thousand kalpas dare resent.”

Finished, then depart.

### The Three Origins Jade Inspection Eight Assemblies Dao

The hidden text of the great void, the secret mystery of the Nine Heavens, the wondrous chapter of Supreme Clarity, destroys heavenly demons in existence, summons jade Immortals in nature. Those who learn its method, movements accord with truth; the body generates water and fire, transformations myriad; preserving thought thoroughly, the Three Origins descend in form. Those who study without the jade text are like trees without roots; their efforts are vain and sincere, exhausting body and spirit; Celestial Perfected do not descend; the body does not form Immortality. Lightly chanting the treasured scripture startles the Nine Heavens;刺奸 will examine; calamity destroys the fate body. Therefore, Heaven has the ritual of bowing and looking up; the scripture has the order of grades; mutually restraining and commanding; above and below balancing; qi fully prepared; thus responding to nature. The Three Origins are the sovereign of all others; the Five Emperors are the officials of correction and punishment; prohibiting light study, incomplete heavenly text, correcting leakage, punishing with the Wind Blade, the balance of life and death. Carefully cultivate as the High Supreme Dao; easily become divine Immortals; but if one studies beyond the heavenly text, violating prohibitions, one will be seized, examined, and suffer calamity. All arise from shallow and narrow learning, not reaching the Dao’s origin; empty body summons truth; how can truth descend? When Dao does not descend, heavenly demons ride the void. Therefore, study should be broad and thorough; seek famous mountains; tread myriad tests without retreat; pass nine hardships with special diligence; only then may one break through heavenly texts, become a Four Extremes Realized Person, mysteriously bestowed treasured texts, complete with qi to become Immortal. But encountering only one scroll and sitting to listen, hoping for Celestial Perfected in one word, is like a fish at the bottom of the abyss hoping to fly to the edge of the Nine Skies. Such learning, is it not laborious?

The Southern Pole Upper Origin Treasure Secret Jade Inspection text, without golden bones and jade marrow, mysterious name imperial diagram, one cannot see its chapters or order. Even if leaked, what the mundane obtain is but a hundred days; surely punished by heavenly calamity; scripture self-destroys. If fate meets a spiritual master, ascends covenant and bestows, but does not follow the years, rashly showing to others, the Seven Ancestors will examine the roots of life and death parents; the body bears the Wind Blade punishment. If within a hundred years, an upper study Realized Person wears and cultivates the scripture but has not seen this text, when two hear transmission, they must first ascend the Spiritual Mountain, report covenant to the Nine Heavens, then listen to be shown the jade text. One must not fail to swear and lightly reveal the ultimate truth; punished by the Five Emperors’ divine soldiers, capturing the Seven Ancestors in hell, destroying the body in the Three Officials, blaming the Three Disciples with stone burdens, adding Five Sufferings on the Knife Mountain. If one does not heed calamity or fortune, one will not be troubled in seeking Immortality.

The Azure Youth Lord says: All Nine Heavens upper scriptures, Supreme Truth ritual texts, have the same level of prohibition and punishment, especially the Three Origins exclusive treasure Jade Inspection text. Yet the Jade Inspection text is the Nine Heavens official titles, inspecting and controlling Immortal qi, the root of myriad origins; how could it not be secret? Later students all aspire to admire the upper Immortals, and can copy and treasure its text, to preserve the pure and sincere words of hardship; yet if not following tradition, will it not be by their own fate?

Wearing the Jade Inspection text, entering the chamber to contemplate the Three Origins Lord, at the first thought, one may not immediately see the Three Origins Lord; sometimes strange lights and other forms of spirits appear before the eyes; this is no wonder; all are Celestial Perfected testing the disciple.

If closing the eyes one sees blue and purple two-colored light, faintly descending, this is the constant intestine Azure True Jade Void qi, the Azure Sovereign Primordial Lord’s reflected official title. The disciple should draw in qi eighty-one times, chanting:

“Celestial Perfected descend, Dao qi bright, visit the Three Origins, court Jade Clarity, ascend the Mysterious Terrace, observe spirit form, receive secret title, feathered robes grow, myriad Immortals come to welcome, flying to the imperial court.”

Finished, after three hundred days, one may see the true form of the Azure Sovereign Primordial Lord.

If one sees red and dark two lights vigorously descending, this is the Lesser Yang Upper Truth Clear Void qi, the Purple Sovereign Primordial Lord’s reflected official title. The disciple should draw in qi sixty-four times, chanting:

“Flying Heaven descends, returning Jade True, entering Purple Clarity, courting Upper Immortal, attending Three Origins, summoning myriad gods, seeing their form, receiving treasured words, my Dao complete, ascending Nine Heavens.”

Finished, after three hundred days, one may see the true form of the Purple Sovereign Primordial Lord.

If one sees yellow and white two-colored lights dense and descending, this is the Central Yellow Mysterious True Great Void qi, the Yellow Sovereign Primordial Lord’s reflected official title. The disciple should draw in qi thirty-six times, chanting:

“Central Heaven wanders, three qi accompany, Mysterious Mother mingles, scattering spirit Purple Tenuity, yellow and white divide and judge, my Dao comes home, elixir jade green carriage, carries me to ascend flight, to visit Vermilion Chamber, Three Origins shine together.”

Finished, after three hundred days, one may see the true form of the Yellow Sovereign Primordial Lord.

If one sees chaotic colored light, light without fixed color, vigorously descending, this is the Mysterious Yin Cavern Void qi, the White Sovereign Primordial Lord’s reflected official title. The disciple should draw in qi twenty-four times, chanting:

“Three qi transform, five colors flow yellow, pure radiance scatters truth, mingling in Middle Origin, coming to descend my chamber, my Dao clearly divides, looking up at divine countenance, like orchid like cloud, making my Dao complete, ascending Jade Gate, courting true form, Three Origins Lord.”

Finished, after three hundred days, one may see the true form of the White Sovereign Primordial Lord.

If one sees a nine-colored phoenix, or one phoenix with nine heads, this is the Nine Heavens Mysterious Mother’s reflected official, coming to descend the fate body; the Dao desires to be completed. Carefully do not speak; knock teeth nine times, swallow breath nine times, chanting:

“Heaven descends, Earth carries, two qi join true, three five mix, together forming my body, six qi celebrate together, myriad wishes open, ascending to the limitless, ultimate Dao arrives, riding dragon and phoenix, guiding purple smoke, flying to Supreme Clarity, Jade Void as neighbor.”

Finished, bow heart nine times and stop. During these nine hundred days, diligently and without weariness, one may see the true form of the Mysterious Mother, behold the Realized Person, and live without limit.

If one sees light as bright as sun and moon, this is the Nine Heavens Primordial Father’s reflected official, descending to the fate body; the Dao desires to be completed. Carefully do not speak; knock teeth twelve times, swallow breath twelve times, chanting:

“Mysterious qi scatters truth, transformations without pattern, Heaven joins Earth, void reflects great void, far spirit descends, mingling with primordial chaos, eight lights carry covenant, nine emperors form friends, able to see Upper Truth, court Vermilion Chamber, long preserve Heaven and Earth, countless kalpas unending.”

Finished, bow heart nine times and stop. After nine hundred days, diligently and without change, one may see the Primordial Father in the fate chamber.

If one sees a person with nine heads, or wearing nine-colored spotted clothes, this is the Nine Heavens True King, chief recorder of the Upper Truth reflected official, descending to the fate body; the Dao desires to be completed. Carefully do not speak; knock teeth nine times, swallow breath three times and stop. Chanting:

“Nine Heavens upper spirit, primordial sovereign essence, three harmonies nine transformations, refining and transforming fetus and infant, returning to true chaos, void descending my form, gathering my death root, extending my longevity, attaining unity with Heaven and Earth, forever enjoying countless years.”

Finished, bow heart nine times and stop. Within seven hundred days, one may see the Nine Heavens True King face to face, speaking together, able to fly above the Nine Heavens.

If one sees a person with dragon head and phoenix body, or one crow with nine heads, this is the Primordial Heavenly King’s left governance reflected Upper Truth official, descending to the fate body; the Dao desires to be completed. Carefully do not speak; knock teeth nine times, swallow breath thirty-two times, secretly chanting:

“Three Dao proceed smoothly, Primordial Heavenly King wanders, mysterious truth shines bright, nine spirits scatter, flowing gaze endless, descending my radiance, cloaked in vermilion light, releasing blockage and opening heart, able to command flying rosy clouds, soaring body purple Tenuity.”

Finished, bow heart three times and stop. After three hundred days, one may see the Primordial Heavenly King’s true form, bestowed with Nine Heavens upper scriptures, flying to Jade Clarity.

If one sees a three-headed spirit, or one person holding a five-colored banner, this is the Five Mountains Immortal Elder, inspector of truth, chief recorder official, coming to examine the disciple’s cultivation. Seeing this, just maintain correct heart and thought, do not lose correctness. Knock teeth three times, secretly chanting:

“Mysterious black black, Five Emperors’ gods, righteous qi descends, to bring me Immortality, my Immortality comes from truth, none but truth may advance, I cultivate the jade text, inspecting and commanding the heavens, reporting to Primordial, universally descending to famous mountains, all commanding myriad spirits, to guard my pavilion, enabling me to fly, ascending imperial morning.”

Finished, draw in qi five times and stop. After one hundred days, the Immortal Elder descends in form, able to visit the fate chamber; on the Eight Festivals days ascend mountains, then the Five Mountains announce fate names at Eastern Flower Palace; after nine years one naturally becomes Immortal.

If one sees an old man, head wrapped in yellow turban, wearing yellow clothes, waist sometimes with sash, hands sometimes holding a knife or nine-section staff, this is the great demon of Heaven’s center, or king of spirit mountains, coming to test the disciple. Do not fear; face north with correct heart; knock left teeth thirty-six times, secretly chanting:

“Heaven’s scalding, Heaven’s scalding, Heaven’s court’s hut, North Feng not restrained, mocking my heavenly text, Three Dao wandering, six evils ride the void, already reported to North Emperor, capturing ghost plots, dazzling falling bells, Jade Inspection heavenly talisman, spirit truth’s pursuit, cutting and destroying without remainder, urgent as my life, baseless and without stay.”

Stop, then pinch both ears’ back gates with both hands, thirty-six breaths stop. Thus entering mountains and cultivating, heavenly demons and mountain spirits all perish beneath the forest of mouth chants, no longer disturbing tests. True Immortal officials will naturally descend, without delay becoming Immortal.

If one sees an old woman, head wrapped in white kerchief, wearing yellow cape and purple skirt, this is the North Feng’s Yin official, chief inspector of great demons.

If one sees a young woman, about twenty years old, hair in three-cornered bun, wearing five-colored clothes, holding a golden halberd, this is the North Feng capital emperor’s daughter, also testing the disciple’s truth. One must knock teeth thirty-two times, secretly chanting:

“Flying emperor yin ring, receiving life of six heavens, transforming qi inheriting spirit, counting method for one hundred years, three generations successively, pure and clear all migrate, why alone do you, sink and hide in the world? Yesterday commanded by emperor, inspecting and testing delay, quickly go without staying, may temporarily report, separately telling North Feng, capturing and sending demon body.”

Stop, then pinch both ears’ back gates quickly with both hands, drawing qi thirty-six breaths and stop. Thus walking the Dao and seeking Immortality, myriad demons vanish and test; heavenly essence destroys and disperses; Dao naturally completes. Within one hundred days, Celestial Perfected will descend, communicating with spirits. Such visions mostly come from closing eyes and contemplating; sometimes after one hundred days one sees as above; sometimes seen in sleep or dreams. Without aspiration, one will not sense truth and see. Already having the imitation great method, within nine years none fail to see true spirits. Having seen true spirits, one ascends to Heaven in broad daylight.

Those who close eyes, knock teeth, contemplate spirit qi, but do not know light shapes, colors, and true or false forms, labor in vain and suffer hardship, never sensing truth. Seeing truth but not knowing how to summon spirits, seeing false but not knowing how to dispel demons, how can truth descend? How can demons vanish? As the Queen Mother has the Western Turtle’s register, the old place of myriad gods’ forms, myriad truths’ light, if the student does not see this, how can they attain completion?

To preserve thought and summon spirits without the method of inner observation, the Upper Truth cannot be immediately descended; those with sincere essence and complete cultivation all have reflected officials opening their meridians; this is the way to attain truth. If the body has defilements or the study’s qi is incomplete, heavenly demons and mountain spirits will first test and defeat one. Having this test but not knowing the method of dispelling curses, Immortality cannot be attained. This method of dispelling curses, practiced for one hundred days, no demon remains unvanished, no truth fails to descend. This subtle Dao cannot be discussed lightly; lightly revealing these words brings examination and punishment on life and death parents, Seven Ancestors’ roots. Only secret and cautious, Dao can complete the body.

### Three Origins Jade Inspection Text Casting and Sacrificial Writing

After receiving the method for nine years, if Celestial Perfected has not descended, one must follow the old text, write two copies on yellow silk, as worn, sacrifice at the mountain of one’s birth star. Set incense, vegetables, cakes, fruits on one plate; nine sheng of clear oil with nine lamps; set facing north a seat; with scarlet gauze cloth set the text in the center; write three slips, placing incense and fruits beneath. The recipient faces north, knocks teeth thirty-six times, softly chanting:

“Supreme Heaven Spirit, primordial chaos without form, thirty-nine emperors, Five Elders Supreme Clarity, auspicious day dawn, high Immortal scatters essence, eight lights wander, Three Origins swift jade, flowing truth descends, gazing at the void court, disciple certain Jia, dares to report to the Great Spirit, formerly granted by emperor’s command, bestowed treasured scripture, Jade Inspection hidden text, Three Origins inner name, thinking deeply and contemplating spirit, not yet seeing true form, respectfully ascending high mountain, listing colors and drawings, casting text into the hidden mountain, burning incense in eight darknesses, Four Departments and Five Emperors, examine my utmost sincerity, report my simple text, above hears clearly, able to descend true spirit, flying into imperial court.”

Finished, burn one copy and one slip completely at the altar. Mix nine kinds of incense with oil, pour fire on top. Scatter remaining ashes on the blue firmament. When scattering, knock teeth nine times, chanting:

“Spirit returns to Nine Heavens, text enters Nine Springs, above hears Nine Prefectures, below reports to river source, I wear Three Origins, Jade Inspection hidden text, spiritual truth descends, clear and undivided, solemnly swear to the high void, burning incense to be heard above, Five Spirits appear, Eight Emperors command Immortals, descending my chariot, swift my purple smoke, carrying me to the great void, ascending imperial morning.”

Finished, then bury one copy under the burnt fire, deep nine chi. Place incense and fruits on top in a container, level the mound. Knock teeth nine times, chanting:

“Report above to Nine Heavens, report below to Nine Spirits, Three Officials, Nine Prefectures, Twelve Immortal Courts, respectfully bury jade text, cast text to the great darkness, enable me to ascend and fly, return to my form, only needing dragon carriage, together meeting at the purple court.”

Finished, bury one slip on the mountain’s sunny side, one on the shady side, both nine chi deep. When burying, the sunny slip faces south, the shady slip faces north. Knock teeth twenty-four times, softly chanting:

“Three Pure Ones mysterious void, Nine Spirits subtle and hidden, great kalpa cycles, five degrees successively push, Supreme Emperor commands, Heaven connects Earth opens, bestows jade text to disciple, commanding myriad affairs, controlling void summoning emptiness, all Perfected return, true Immortals not yet descended, Three Origins wander, days pass and come, Dao should be delayed, cast text to Mysterious Mountain, proclaim command to four non-ones, enable me to ascend early, Celestial Perfected descend with radiance, able to ride eight lights, ascend purple Tenuity.”

Finished, then bury. Both places share this blessing.

These two origins’ casting texts are for beginners who have not yet descended the Upper Truth; follow the years for one passage; Celestial Perfected all descend in the sleeping chamber. If one feels and has imitation and spirit encounters, this is without delay ascending; no need to cast and sacrifice again to heavenly spirits. Without this method, the Dao cannot be realized; spirits cannot descend. This is the foundation of study. The method’s subtlety is only secret and Dao responds; only caution and truth descend; lightly revealing the ultimate method, heavenly examination immediately reveals.

### Three Origins Jade Slips

Celestial Perfected utmost taboo, applying them is the foundation of Immortal study; practicing for one hundred days, one immediately sees spirit form, wishes all to respond, thoughts all descend, aspirations all succeed. Those who obtain this method ascend to Heaven in broad daylight.

If the slips lack silver, use jade; if no jade, silver or wood may also be used. But they must be neatly wrapped in white, without defilement, then may be used.

Long ago, Ning Xuanfu received it from the Supreme Emperor Realized Person; not ascending Heaven for nine years, followed the text to bury it in the White Void Mountain, nine chi deep in the earth. Later student Li Zhongjun, passing by the White Void chamber, purified and contemplated the Dao; within one hundred days suddenly saw jade text silver slips in the chamber. Zhongjun ascended to cast the golden blue letter, swore and reported spirit, knelt and treasured it for three years; thus bringing down the Three Origins, extending life by seven hundred years. Then again went to Labor Valley to receive true text and ascend Heaven. Now one copy is sealed at White Void Mountain. The Primordial Lord at the Great Void Golden Mound plain bestowed the Azure Void Realized Person Wang Jun to teach later students to combine bones and flesh to become Immortal. Those who obtain this method do not study but become Immortal.
