# The Supreme Clarity’s Primordial Spirit, Part One

The Most High Heavenly Emperor, the Supreme Emperor, and the Most Subtle Heavenly Emperor Sovereign’s Profound Elixir Scripture, transmitted by the Great Lord Azure Youth — Chapter One.

The Great Emperor Sovereign, the Most High Heavenly Emperor Sovereign, and the Most Subtle Heavenly Emperor Sovereign — these three sovereigns once received the Profound Elixir Scripture from the Most High Dao Sovereign. They cultivated the dao and attained realization, thus supplementing the true essence of emperors and kings. On the day of ascending to the heavens, the Great Emperor Sovereign passed the true scripture to the Queen Mother of the West; the Most High Heavenly Emperor Sovereign passed the true scripture to the Supreme Origin Sovereign of the Southern Pole; the Most Subtle Heavenly Emperor Sovereign passed the true scripture to the Sacred Sovereign of the Golden Palace. The Sacred Sovereign of the Golden Palace then passed the true scripture to the Prime Minister Azure Youth; the Prime Minister Azure Youth passed the true scripture to the Disciple. This scripture is the Primordial Spirit, Part One. This dao is lofty and subtle, not to be heard by middling immortals. Unless one possesses the famous red bamboo slips or the green characters of the Supreme Ultimate, the Profound Elixir Scripture will not be encountered or seen. Daoists who fully cultivate the Three Supreme True Scriptures of the Most High rank above emperors and kings as supreme lords and ministers. Those who receive only parts or hear the dao partially rank as kings of minor spiritual palaces or ministers of the Divine Land, mid to lower officials of the Supreme Ultimate; yet even they may gallop dragons, ride clouds, soar through the void, guided by divine officers and guardians, spreading their radiance to the Eight Directions. The subtlety is profound and mysterious, difficult to lightly proclaim. The chapters of the scripture emerge from the Eight Primordial Chapters of the Most High’s Hidden Writings, possessing the measured rhythm of looking up and down.

Now, the Mud Pellet Heavenly Emperor Triad is the spiritual ancestor of the one body, the root of life for myriad spirits, the source of bodily fluids, the jade chamber of soul and essence. Thus, the stomach pool’s form is square to receive things; the brain palace is round and empty, perfectly true; ten thousand hairs stand erect, a thousand pores emit smoke; virtue completes Heaven and Earth, blending with the Supreme Mystery. Hence it is called the Mud Pellet, the supreme spirit above the physical form. Those who only know to swallow saliva and inhale qi, clatter their teeth and take in fluids without understanding the cause, these are but the flowing bubbles of the Mud Pellet, the peripheral branches of the brain palace. Now I will tell you the secret to assist in guarding the One, so you may become a true person among the highest immortals. Disciples receiving this scripture must fast and purify for forty-five days before transmission, using forty pieces of blue silk, five bright red mirrors, and three pairs of golden rings to form the covenant of the first cavern—do not reveal this oath lightly.

Above the space between the eyebrows, one inch inward lies the Bright Hall; two inches inward, the Cavern Chamber; three inches inward, the Elixir Field. Straight upward and one inch to the side lies the Profound Elixir, the brain’s Mud Pellet soul chamber.

Within the Bright Hall, to the left is the Bright Youth True Sovereign, to the right the Bright Maiden True Sovereign, and in the center the Bright Mirror True Sovereign. The Bright Youth True Sovereign’s name is Profound Yang, styled Young Azure; the Bright Maiden True Sovereign is named Subtle Yin, styled Young Origin; the Bright Mirror True Sovereign is named Illuminating Essence, styled Fourfold Brightness. These three sovereigns jointly govern the Bright Hall Palace, all clad in green brocade robes, belts adorned with four jade bells, mouths holding jade mirrors, the mirror and bells both made of red jade. Their heads resemble infants, their forms likewise, sitting opposite one another, facing outward or sometimes toward each other. This is the way of the Bright Hall, the path walked by immortals, the cultivation of dao and virtue. If a daoist fears or hesitates, they preserve these three spirits, causing the jade bells to ring—sound heard by the Supreme Ultimate—then they spit forth the jade mirror’s red light, ten thousand rays blazing. When fully preserved, they call the three sovereigns’ names thrice and beat the heavenly drum nine times; then a thousand demons submit, ten thousand ghosts vanish. If the daoist is hungry or thirsty, they also preserve the three sovereigns, spitting forth red qi, pouring it into their own mouth, inhaling and swallowing until satiated. If traveling at night and the path is dark and unseen, they preserve the three sovereigns, spitting three flames of light ahead, and soon the road becomes clear. Moreover, if passing through perilous places of calamity and danger, where blades and weapons threaten, quickly preserve them, causing the three sovereigns to ring jade bells and focus their spirit; enemies naturally become terrified and subdued, no longer harboring evil or harmful intent. If the daoist wishes to seek longevity, immortality, or rescue from illness and distress, they lie down properly, concentrate on preserving the three sovereigns of the Bright Hall, kneeling long outward, spitting red qi, first permeating their body, circling the mouth and sides, holding and swallowing the red qi. The more the better, countless in number. They close their eyes and swallow gently; soon the red qi surrounds the body, all transforming into fire. The fire circles the body; body and fire become one. Inside and outside shine through, lasting a long while before ceasing. This is called the Sun and Moon Refining Form—death followed by rebirth. If done nightly before sleep, one will surely live long and not die. Constantly swallowing red qi causes the complexion to brighten and diminish, resembling a child’s face. This is the way of immortality, practiced by immortals, the essential secret of the Bright Hall.

Every morning upon rising, swallow saliva thirty times, wipe the face with hands, rub the eyes as usual, preserving the saliva’s color as red fluid.

Within the Cavern Chamber dwell three True Sovereigns: to the left, the Nameless Child; to the right, the White Origin Sovereign; in the center, the Yellow Elder Sovereign. These three jointly govern the Cavern Chamber. This is the way of the Flying True, recorded in another scripture.

Within the Elixir Field dwells the Supreme Origin True One Emperor Sovereign. Alongside the emperor’s ministers, three together govern the Elixir Field, guarding the way of the Three Origins True One. This place is the essential path of truth, the route controlling the dragon chariot’s ride. Heavenly true beings often desire to become earthly true beings; earthly true beings hide in official posts, avoiding labor and court banquets, thus living leisurely and freely, wandering with the times, driving seven chariots or more, stepping the Four Qi upon the Great Origin. Though heavenly and earthly true beings differ slightly in rank, they are all one truth. Earthly true beings each settle where they please, no longer wishing to serve as officials among the clouds.

The Profound Elixir Palace houses the Mud Pellet Supreme One True Sovereign. One inch behind the Elixir Field lies the Flowing Pearl Palace, whose true spirits have their own scripture, governing the course of destiny. This way is the greatest, winding and twisting, entangling and binding, only then can it be entrusted. This transmission occurs once every three hundred years, ending after five transmissions, no longer to be passed on. This is the way of the Supreme Ultimate lords and ministers governing destiny.

Now, the human head contains nine palaces. First, let us explain. Above the space between the eyebrows is enclosed the Yellow Gate, Purple Door, Crimson Terrace, and Azure Chamber, jointly forming a guarded inch within, encompassing the left and right ears. To the left of the guarded inch is the Crimson Terrace; to the right, the Yellow Gate. The nine palace true sovereigns enter and exit through the path between the Yellow Gate and Crimson Terrace, thus placing the terrace and gate on left and right. The Terrace and Gate serve to observe extraordinary omens, welcoming the comings and goings of true sovereigns. The Purple Door’s great god is named Peaceful Stillness, styled Dharma King; the Azure Chamber’s great god is named Upright Heart, styled First Square. Both appear as infants, each wearing garments matching the colors of their respective chamber or door, holding flowing golden bells. The guarded inch lies three fen inward, named the Guarded Inch. At night’s rest and during contemplation, first preserve these two great gods, imagining them before the eyes, then call their divine names thrice, and softly chant:

“Purple Door, Azure Chamber, two great gods, hands grasp flowing bells, bodies born of wind and cloud, chivalrous guardians of the true dao, do not heed external disturbances. Let my thoughts connect, open spiritual gates, enter and exit with purity and benefit, ascend the Nine Gates, behold the Nine Truths, the Most High’s honor.”

Then preserve in thought the triad of the Cavern Chamber’s Nine Truths and all essential ways.

The two great gods of the Guarded Inch heed only the true officials within the Nine Palaces; only those inside the Nine Palaces may enter and exit. From the Most High Emperor’s trusted commands to the Jade Youth Spiritual Truth, the wise sages and immortals who come to the imperial pavilion are heard and admitted; others who are not true are not admitted by these two great gods. This is the law of the Yellow Supreme One. Then the Infant Emperor Sovereign commands the two ear gods, the Charming Maidens, and Cloud Attendants to escort entrants. Thus, when one feels ringing in the ears, it is an external envoy entering. If there is liking or disliking, the Cloud Attendants strike the chime and bell to alert the Nine Palaces, signaling outsiders’ arrival and alerting the watch. The chime and bell produce the sound of ear ringing today. Those who hear it should quickly cover their ears with crossed hands and say: “The Infant dwells in the palace, the Nine Truths dwell in the chamber; please heed the divine command, also examine for misfortune. The Supreme One’s flowing fire wields power over myriad calamities.” Then pat the ear gate seventeen times; afterward, one should feel warmth on the face, a good sign. If the head feels cold in spots, evil qi has entered. One must quickly lie down, close the eyes, and preserve the Profound Elixir Palace’s Supreme One Sovereign, casting forth the flowing fire bell to expel the evil qi from the ears. The firelight follows, illuminating the whole body until calm returns. If suddenly one hears the sound of rushing water or thunderous drums in the ears, it means the body is fatigued and internally damaged, the heart’s storehouse is severely impaired, unable to properly pour forth the pearl of truth, thus scattering and disordering, causing the six organs to lose their way, the soul and spirit to wail—this portends illness and death. Therefore, when the Mud Pellet’s method is lost, the Nine Palaces lose their order, sorrow and confusion overturn and err, drums sound and chaos ensues, seeking to change dwelling and abandon the body. Those who hear this should focus their mind on the Supreme One Sovereign, returning all attention to one point. If the offense is not deep, one may hear and repent. Deafness means the ear god has perished.

The ear is the emperor sovereign’s gate of hearing. The eye is the Supreme One’s sun and moon. The nose is the hill and mountain of the Three Origins. The mouth is the Crimson Palace’s vermilion abyss. The eyebrow is the White Origin’s splendid canopy. The hair is the Bright Hall’s forest essence. The tongue is the Nameless’s dragon axle. The teeth are the stomach palace’s power. The hands are the gall spirit’s external aid. The feet are the kidney origin’s spiritual gate. The yin pole is the Cavern Chamber’s true mechanism. The one body hosts myriad spirits, each with its domain—none may be neglected or treated lightly.

If suddenly one hears golden sounds and jade tones in the ears, true qi is entering; the dao wishes to be accomplished. If one hears string music, the Six Ding and Jade Maidens come to guard the child—this too means the dao wishes to be fulfilled. One should then quietly and diligently cultivate the path, the heart’s effort growing ever stronger. Thus the true person gradually manifests form and vision. If not your master, do not speak of this to others.

If one hears the sound of flutes and horns, it is an auspicious and noble sign. If one hears shouting and howling, it is an ominous and lowly sign. If one smells foul qi, there will surely be sickness or impurity—an unpropitious sign not to be taken lightly. Therefore, when foul qi appears, immediately bathe, burn incense, and sweep the sleeping chamber to respond. This is the emperor sovereign’s warning and admonition to people. If one smells fragrant qi, it means divine officers and spiritual beings are near the child’s side, observing the child’s state. At such times, one should cultivate good deeds, practice virtue and kindness, rescue the poor and destitute, accumulate hidden merit, and bestow benevolence and love. The divine officers and spiritual beings will then report to the Most High whether the daoist’s conduct is good or bad. The dao’s subtlety cannot be ignored; all such phenomena are signs. If fragrant qi is smelled, do not tell others unless you are the master. If foul qi is smelled, inform others to reveal the omen of transgression and impurity. If blood qi is smelled or blood appears without cause, it signals war and calamity. Quickly flee the human realm, guard the Three Origins Emperor Sovereigns, seek rescue, and purify for three months; the disaster will then vanish. These are all prior warnings from the emperor sovereigns to alert people to fortune and misfortune, urging fear and caution. When seeing ominous signs, one should practice hidden virtue, cultivate kindness and rescue. For what others cannot do, you must do, thus escaping the fate of certain death. You must be diligent and maintain constancy.

Above the space between the eyebrows, three fen inward lies the Guarded Inch Twin Fields; one inch inward, the Bright Hall Palace; two inches inward, the Cavern Chamber Palace; three inches inward, the Elixir Field Palace; four inches inward, the Flowing Pearl Palace; five inches inward, the Jade Emperor Palace. One inch above the Bright Hall is the Heavenly Court Palace; one inch above the Cavern Chamber is the Ultimate True Palace; one inch above the Elixir Field is the Profound Elixir Palace; one inch above the Flowing Pearl Palace is the Supreme Emperor Palace. Altogether, the head contains nine palaces. The scriptures of the Bright Hall, Cavern Chamber, Elixir Field, and Flowing Pearl—these four palaces’ scriptures—are the dao of immortals and true persons, the dao transmitted to the world. The Profound Elixir Scripture is also the essential words of true officials governing destiny, the chief lineage of the four palaces. This one scripture must be granted by the Supreme Ultimate Emperor Sovereign to be given; only then is it transmitted. All who unite the way of the five palaces and walk it in the world will encounter it by true name. Those without sturdy bones and strong fate will not hear these words. There is also the Jade Emperor Palace, where the Jade Pure Divine Mother dwells; the Heavenly Court Palace, where the Supreme Clarity True Maiden dwells; the Ultimate True Palace, where the Supreme Ultimate Emperor’s consort dwells; and the Supreme Emperor Palace, where the Most High Sovereign’s consort dwells. These four palaces are all feminine true one, the dao higher than masculine true one. They each possess precious scriptures passed down by realized true persons. True persons who have not yet attained realization do not hear of these. The essentials of the feminine true are not given to others. The Most High thus issues the Eight Extreme Scenes, enters the Jade Pavilion, where three thousand jade maidens attend the true, spiritual consorts sing chivalrously, and the divine consort holds the veil—these truly guard the feminine one’s way, used to exalt the mysterious morning. This is the root of the Most High’s lineage, transmitted by the Void Sovereign. All people have these four palaces, but those who do not cultivate this dao find the palaces empty. Those who do not fully cultivate the nine palaces find the palaces empty—not only the feminine four palaces. As for the Elixir Field Palace, it always contains the emperor sovereign; the Guarded Inch always contains great gods. No questions asked—only cultivation reveals their presence. Cultivators become immortals; non-cultivators live out their lifespan and die. The masculine and feminine one gods may both be cultivated by men and women; none are absent. Only through utmost refinement of essence and effort is benefit attained.

To guard the way of the Profound Elixir Supreme One Sovereign, at dusk and night’s rest, cast away all thoughts, sit or lie at ease. First preserve the Purple Qi of the Northern Polar Star descending into the Profound Elixir Palace. Soon the palace fills, overflowing beyond the body, permeating inside and out, merging with the Purple Qi. Then preserve the sun entering the Profound Elixir Palace, the sun filling the palace, positioned in the center of the Purple Qi, appearing like a fire pearl seen in darkness. Then preserve the Supreme Yellow Profound Elixir Supreme One Sovereign, descending from the Northern Polar Purple Qi into the Profound Elixir Palace to sit. The sovereign’s name is Guiying, styled Transforming Mystery, dressed and adorned as above. Then preserve oneself suddenly entering the Profound Elixir Palace, sitting opposite the Supreme One Sovereign, wearing any garment at will, and with arising heart, bowing and kneeling, asking the dao, seeking immortality and longevity, speaking freely. Then preserve swallowing Purple Qi thirty times, then swallowing saliva thirty times. Then preserve a red qi within the Northern Dipper’s seven stars, as large as a string, descending straight into the Profound Elixir Palace. Thereupon, the Supreme One Sovereign and oneself ride the sun, entering the red qi path, ascending straight to the Northern Dipper’s chief star, resting a long while. This rest is also a true response. Practicing for fourteen years, one journeys with the Supreme One, reaching the seven origins’ framework. At sixteen years, one visits the Supreme Clarity Palace, receiving scriptures, wearing talismans, commanding eighteen jade youths and eighteen jade maidens. One night’s preservation suffices; only count, do not let it slip. One may also specialize in this way without guarding the triad. Doing both brings benefit; when essence is utmost, response is swift.

On the first, third, seventh, eleventh, and fifteenth days of the month, at midnight, preserve the Profound Elixir Palace’s Supreme One Sovereign, spitting forth blue qi outward, descending into one’s mouth, swallowing fifty times, then swallowing saliva fifty times, softly chanting:

“Supreme One True Emperor, Supreme Yellow Purple Sovereign, named Guiying, styled Transforming Mystery, golden bed, jade canopy, purple embroidered brocade skirt, belt with flowing fire bells, cutting evil and destroying treachery, holding star essence, head born of true reality, sitting upright, spitting qi, causing me to swallow, speaking with me, feasting in the Profound Elixir, refining the seven souls, harmonizing the three spirits, true spirits guarding, enabling me to fly as immortal, the five viscera self-generating, returning to the white youthful countenance, receiving the Supreme Clarity scripture, governing destiny emperor sovereign, all wishes and desires, a hundred blessings anew.”

Then preserve oneself entering the palace to rest before the Supreme One. Thus one takes qi to sleep and will dream of marvelous responses. Through repeated accumulation, stages of mutual vision gradually arise. The Most High Dragon Scripture says: “Sit upright in the Profound Elixir, neither leaning nor crooked”—this is the essence of the way. One should always preserve the Supreme One’s Purple Qi circling the body and swallowing it. One should always preserve the Supreme One Sovereign within the Profound Elixir. Thus longevity is boundless, myriad calamities do not touch, the Profound Elixir’s way is complete.
