### Record of the Supreme Clarity’s Embryonic Essence: Instructions for Untying Knots and Conducting the Practice

Within the upper part of the embryo lie four knots: one knot in the Mud Pellet, two knots in the mouth, three knots in the cheeks, and four knots in the moon (the palate). To untie these four knots of the upper part, on the day of one’s birth sign at dawn, enter a chamber and burn incense. Face northwest and perform nine bows, saluting the Nine Heavens’ Primordial Father; knock the teeth nine times in succession, and call thrice the true name of the Primordial Father to guide the return.

Then face southeast and perform three bows, calling thrice the true name of the Mysterious Mother of the Nine Heavens to dissolve and return. Facing the birth sign, sit upright and close the eyes, envisioning the Primordial Father as nine inches and nine fen tall, wearing the black and yellow plain spiritual sash, head crowned with a headdress adorned with seven strings of pearl and jade, the Crown of Infinite Merit, residing atop the Nine Heavens in the Supreme Ultimate Jade Palace, the treasury of jade treasures, the abode of elixir spirits in the Cavern of Origins. He rides a flying chariot of blue mist, accompanied by twelve flying dragons and twenty-four immortals, descending into my body to govern the realm of the Mud Pellet.

Next, envision the Mysterious Mother as six inches and six fen tall, clad in a blue jewel robe embroidered with divine light and frost silk of nine colors, wearing a purple, black, and yellow precious crown, dwelling above the Nine Qi in the Supreme Infinite Jade Forest, the Seven Reflections Elixir Chamber, the treasury of jade treasures in the Cavern of Origins, the Nine Light village in the Supreme Clarity. She rides a flying purple cloud feathered canopy, accompanied by twelve phoenixes and thirty-six jade maidens, descending into my body to govern the inner chamber of the face.

Think of the parents transforming into blue and yellow qi, weaving and overlapping, finally settling upon the head and face. Having completed this, knock the teeth nine times, and softly intone the incantation:

"I, [Name], receive the transformation of the Nine Spirits; the knotting qi is impure, the joints obstructed and firmly bound, blocking the spiritual gate. With my birth sign as witness, I report to the High Dawn, Primordial Father and Mysterious Mother, to illuminate my body. May the eight lights shine together, the Nine Heavens align with truth, jointly unbind the four knots of the upper embryo, return the spirit to fill the gate, open the nine orifices, refine the inner embryo, condense the nine elixirs of spirit, transform the blue into red, entwine the two qi, live in harmony with the Three Luminaries, and forever enjoy countless years."

Having finished, swallow the breath eighty-one times and stop. Next, envision the King of Boundless Solitude, surname Hun, named (Rain Ten Ladle)(Rain Ten Ladle) Luo, wearing a nine-colored seamless natural spotted fur robe, head crowned with a shining sun disk, governing the Heavenly Mysterious Platform within the purple gate, riding a nine-kirin jade wheel, attended by twenty-four jade immortals.

Next, envision the Supreme Supreme Meditative Benevolent King of Infinite Longevity, surname Xi, named (Rain Ten Fall)(Rain Ten Ladle)(Rain Ten Bind), clad in a nine-colored cloud-patterned robe, head crowned with radiant sunlight, governing the Heavenly King’s realm, the Vermilion Forest’s Seven Treasures Jade Terrace, riding twelve mysterious turtles with flying blue feather canopies, accompanied by thirty-two jade children from the Upper Palace.

Next, envision the King Xu Yan, surname Zi, named (Rain Ten Carry)(Rain Ten Head) Luo, wearing a nine-colored triple-law cloud-patterned robe, head crowned with the Heavenly Origin’s precious brightness, governing the Heavenly Jade Capital Cloud City, riding nine-colored flying swans and three white clouds, accompanied by twenty-four pure spirit jade maidens.

Think of these three Heavenly True Kings descending upon my head and face, transforming into blue, purple, and yellow qi, swirling like clouds, entering through the mouth, eyes, and nostrils, pervading the entire face. Then raise the voice in blessing:

"Three Great Heavenly Kings, Nine Mysterious Spiritual Immortals, aid me in untying the upper knots of the head. Transform the nine elixirs naturally, descend upon the Golden Gate of Essence, unite the clouds of the Three Truths, flow through my body to perfect my spirit, sweep away the death qi, extinguish the embryo’s root, fill and solidify the spiritual radiance, abandon all calamities, resolve all knots, accept the true at every joint, let the mysterious light flow and spread, penetrate the imperial abyss, speak the name of the Nine Heavens, return the embryo to transform into immortals, fill within and overflow without, wrap and form the spirit."

Having finished, swallow the breath nine times and stop. Next, think of the Eight Scenic Divine Children of the upper part. Close the eyes and preserve them:

The brain spirit named Awake No-Child, styled Dao Capital. Form length one inch and two fen, dressed in white brocade, head crowned with a three-beam precious crown.

The hair spirit named Mysterious Father Splendor, styled Dao Balance. Form length two inches and one fen, clad in dark cloud brocade, head crowned with the Infinite Merit Crown.

The tongue spirit named First Beam Peak, styled Dao Branch. Form length seven inches, wearing crimson brocade flying skirt, head crowned with the Merit-Advancing Crown.

Preserve the Eight Scenic Spirits of the upper part, each stationed in its place, all resembling infant forms, united as one, clear as a face seen. Then knock the teeth eight times, softly bless:

"Upper Scenic One Section, Eight Spirits contain truth, knot qi into nine elixirs, transform and form my body, a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, scattered like clouds and smoke, descending around the head and face, bestowing spiritual distribution, untying knots and joints, extinguishing embryo roots below, removing firm stagnation, opening the three gates of principle, Eight Sceneries wing the body, sharing spirit and age, the Emperor Lord and Mysterious Mother, winding and turning the High Dawn, descend my jade splendor, halt my decline, freshen and restore rosy cheeks, face transformed into golden immortal; change scenery like lightning, directly reach the Sun Gate."

Having finished, swallow eight breaths and stop, then take the talisman of refining the nine elixirs of yang spirit.

The talisman on blue paper written in vermilion, three pieces. Facing the birth sign, knock the teeth nine times, softly intone:

"Transform the nine qi, refine the hundred spirits, govern the six palaces within, descend the Great Immortal without, the Emperor Lord’s domain, Mysterious Mother’s pottery ford, untie knots and disperse stagnation, sever and extinguish embryo roots, body light and flesh flying, respond to qi naturally, ascend together with me, rise to the Emperor’s presence."

Having finished, swallow the talisman, nine breaths, and stop.

Within the middle part of the embryo lie four knots: one knot in the five viscera, two knots in the Great Granary, three knots in the large intestine, four knots in the small intestine. To untie these four knots of the middle part, on the day of one’s birth sign at midday, enter a chamber and burn incense. Face northwest and perform nine bows, saluting the Primordial Father; knock the teeth nine times, calling thrice the true name of the Primordial Father. Then face southeast and perform three bows, saluting the Mysterious Mother, calling thrice her true name. Return to sit upright facing the current year’s birth sign, knock the teeth nine times, close the eyes, and envision the Primordial Father as nine inches and nine fen tall, draped in the black and yellow plain spiritual sash, head crowned with a headdress adorned with seven strings of pearl and jade, the Crown of Infinite Nobility, residing atop the Nine Heavens in the Supreme Ultimate Jade Palace, the treasury of jade treasures, the abode of elixir spirits in the Cavern of Origins. He rides a flying chariot of blue mist, accompanied by twelve flying dragons and twenty-four immortals, descending from the northwest into my five viscera.

She rides a flying purple cloud feathered canopy, accompanied by twelve phoenixes and thirty-six jade maidens, descending from the southeast into my five viscera.

Think of the parents transforming into blue and yellow qi, swirling like the round sun, illuminating the five viscera, shining inside and out. Raise the voice in blessing:

"Father Spirit and Mother Essence, the two qi united, condense the nine elixirs, knot the purple jade embryo, observe the Great Microcosm, command the Nine Spirits, Emperor Lord spreads spirit, flow of truth irrigates life, five viscera knot channels, six palaces pure and clear, stomach and pipes open and wise, nine orifices bright and clear, old knots disperse and vanish, new embryo flourishes, transform scenery and refine marrow, crown with nine stars, Three Luminaries wing the body, fly into the imperial court."

Having finished, swallow forty-five breaths and stop. Next, envision the Serene King, surname Ban, named Misty (Rain Ten Celebration), wearing a seven-colored dragon-patterned luminous robe, head crowned with the Yin Essence Night Light Crown, governing the Vermilion Palace Jade Terrace, riding the eight scenic flying wheel, accompanied by twelve jade immortals.

Next, envision the Unarrogant Joyful King, surname Ning, named (Rain Ten Flow)(Rain Ten Note)(Rain Ten Hold) Mist, wearing a nine-colored flying frost cloud patterned spotted robe, head crowned with the Blue Splendor Year Star Mysterious Essence, governing the Nine Heavens’ Vermilion Elixir Chamber Nine-Layered Jade Terrace, riding a white deer chariot of cinnabar clouds, accompanied by twenty-six upper palace jade immortals.

Think of these three Heavenly True Kings descending into my five viscera, transforming into red, white, and black qi, swirling like clouds of smoke, entering through the heart orifice, pervading the five internal organs. Then softly intone:

"Nine elixirs condense spirit, three qi entwine and bind, mysterious truth descends, inside and outside bright and fresh, Great Granary opens and connects, intestines and stomach knot immortals, sever and extinguish joints and stems, disperse and remove old roots, three unite and form contract, nine transformations condense spirit, return essence to jade embryo, perfect my body, nine colors of mysterious yellow, flow essence and irrigate fluids, wash away accumulated stagnation, inside no dross or dust, splendid branches contain bloom, plant the spiritual root, every orifice clear and bright, every joint cool and serene, bones transform into flying light, ascend to the Purple Heaven."

Having finished, swallow nine breaths and stop. Next, envision the Eight Scenic Divine Children of the middle part. Close the eyes and preserve them:

Preserve the Eight Scenic Spirits of the middle part, all in infant form, each stationed in its place, myriad chariots and ten thousand riders, pervading my internal organs. Then knock the teeth eight times, raise the voice in blessing:

"Lower Scenic Eight, disperse form and transform spirit, contain primordial nurturing qi, refine embryo purple smoke, Great One Primordial Father, Mysterious Mother entwined, two essences flow and irrigate, nurture the inner truth, Emperor Lord fixes the register, governs fate and changes the year, knots dispersed, nine orifices fresh and open, soul and spirit firm and secure, commanding myriad spirits, ascend with me, together create the Jade Dawn."

Swallow the saliva eight times and stop. Also envision the Dao One Inner Spirit, named Escape No-Horse, styled Dao Ultimate Life. Form length two inches and two fen, wearing purple civil bright brocade skirt, crowned with the Infinite Merit Crown, residing beneath the navel in the elixir field, commanding the three parts and twenty-four spirits.

Having finished, swallow twenty-four breaths and stop, then take the talisman of the three gates and twelve knots within the embryo.

The talisman on white paper written in yellow, three pieces. Having preserved all, take it facing the current year. Softly intone: This is the talisman of wearing only, not a command talisman or incantation.

The four knots of the upper part firmly bind the Mud Pellet, bathing the person’s radiant visage, Heaven and Man generate the fern (life). The four knots of the middle part gather evil into clusters, firmly bind the Great Granary, swiftly disturb the wandering soul, invite demons and illicit spirits, cause scattered dreams and lack of focus. The four knots of the lower part bind the person’s posterior gate; block the nine orifices, sever the root of life.

The Emperor Lord reports to the spirit, the Nine Heavens’ Jade Script dissolves and dispels knots, extinguishes all root sources. Primordial Father and Mysterious Mother nurture the three gates, Eight Sceneries guard and prepare, true qi scatters and divides, upper blue and lower yellow, square outside and round inside, wrapped in complete purity, descending to the Three Origins, riding the Eight Sceneries, flying like smoke in the sky, soaring to the Golden Gate.

Having finished, swallow twelve breaths, swallow saliva twenty-four times and stop.

In the fourth month, receive the qi of King Xu Yan. On the seventh day at dawn, the seventeenth day at noon, the twenty-seventh day at midnight, and the third day of the month at the three periods, bathe with fragrant water, enter the chamber and burn incense. Face northwest and perform nine bows, saluting the Primordial Father; face southeast and perform three bows, saluting the Mysterious Mother; then face the monthly pillar and sit upright, knock the teeth thirty-six times, close the eyes and call upon King Xu Yan, surname Zi, named Luo, wearing a nine-colored triple-law cloud-patterned robe, crowned with the Heavenly Origin’s precious brightness, governing the Heavenly Jade Capital Spirit City, riding nine-spirit flying swans and three white clouds, accompanied by twenty-four pure spirit jade maidens, descending into the yellow court palace of my embryo, envisioning a cloud of yellow qi thick and dense, crowning the embryo form. After a long while, softly intone the cloud qi nine breaths and the incantation:

"The three souls are settled, the seven spirits are peaceful, Heaven spreads the five lodges, body models the seven stars, myriad spirits attend and wing, mysterious truth exhales spirit, jade mushroom flows and pours, cavern irrigates five forms, inside fills and outside overflows, dark gates bright and clear, return to refine marrow, revert white to blue, freely change scenery, exit the hidden and enter the dark, ride the void and fly through the sky, ascend to the Moon Court."

Having finished, swallow breath nine times and stop, diligently and repeatedly.

The talisman on bamboo membrane written in blue, three pieces. Facing the birth sign, take three pieces at three periods, to open intestines, refine marrow, transform bones and knot spirit. In three years, fly and rise, flesh and bone become immortal. The incantation on the talisman reads:

"Heaven crimson, Earth rising, two qi interdescend, yang nine transformations, knot essence in the middle chamber, eight sceneries scatter spirit, six palaces prosper within, myriad spirits all clear, long enjoy the sun, forever Heaven’s pole, fear and joy unending."

Having finished, wear the talisman, swallow nine breaths and stop.
