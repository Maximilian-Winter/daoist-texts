The *Most High Hidden Scripture of the Eight Elements* is the Way of the Mysterious Pure Jade Emperor. The Supreme August Heavenly Emperor bestowed this scripture upon the Emperor Lord of the Supreme Subtle Heaven, the Three Primal Purple Essence Dao Lord, and the True Yang Primordial Elder Lord. This lord received the scripture, practiced and attained the Way, then entrusted it to the Most High Dao Lord. The Most High Dao Lord passed it on to the Golden Pavilion Later Sage Lord Li, who delivered it to the True Void Perfected Person and the Red Lord of the Southern Peak, commanding them to teach the Way below. It has long borne the golden name and jade characters, carved on high pavilions, reserved for those who are to become Perfected Persons. The Most High’s hidden writings are not transmitted to Earthly Immortals, nor can Earthly Immortals obtain them by themselves.

The Most High said: The Five Stars are the spiritual roots of the sun and moon, the five viscera of Heaven’s embryo. Thus the heavenly essence entwines to form the Five Stars; Heaven and Earth rely on them to gather qi; the sun and moon strike them to shine. If the heavenly qi fails to nurture, the three harmonies lose fullness and emptiness; if the earthly qi fails to nurture, myriad things wither and stagnate; loss of fullness and emptiness causes Heaven to quake and Earth to tremble. If the constellations fail to guard, the sun and moon wane and erode; if the Five Stars lose their order, the two luminaries lose their light. When Heaven and Earth are at peace, the Five Stars reflect clearly; when heavenly essence unites, the Five Stars shine brightly. The spiritual dao of the stars responds atop Mount Tai; the virtuous spirit Jade Clarity shines above, illuminating the True Void below and brightening myriad signs. When omens gain or lose, the five degrees err and reverse; when omens harmonize and bring fortune, the flow proceeds smoothly, reflecting hidden calamities and blessings, minute and clear, the mysterious illuminating the subtle, quietly preserving merit and fault. The Five Emperors report to the True Emperor among the stars; the True Emperor reports to the Most High Jade Lord. Hence the celestial light turns the candle to show all living beings, and the side movements crossing positions announce disaster or good fortune. The earth establishes the five sacred mountains to symbolize the Five Phases stars; humans stand with the five viscera spirits to correspond to the use of the Five Phases. The three qi revolve and unite, thus Heaven and Earth are arrayed completely. The stars as essence connect above to all essences, below sharing luminous passages; breathing out and in, the three blossoms rinse and moisten myriad spirits, reaching the three and six, containing nourishment for life. Their affairs are profound and subtle to the utmost; their vessels vast and all-encompassing. Immortals only know how to fly the elixir, summon frost, refine cloud cinnabar, water jade, dissolve metal in nine furnaces of fiery sky, laboring intensely in their cultivation, watching the seasons with diligence. Those who succeed merely ascend their bodies to Heaven, leap beyond the mysterious continent. This is the way of immortals alone; though they may roam between the Nine Palaces, they have yet to gain the gate of the Perfected Person. Now I have a Way, the method of the Supreme Perfected, not merely the Middle Perfected. If you desire to summon the Five Stars, ride with the Three Elements above on the same carriage, sit amid the Eight Scenes to gaze and roam, ascend the Western Ramparts of the Supreme Emperor, extend your form through the vast space, and greet the white sun at dawn. I once received this from the Jade Emperor and have practiced it unceasingly for four hundred and sixty thousand years, delighting in the marvels of this Way, rejoicing in the meeting with the Five Stars. Having obtained the division of forms into myriad myriads, giving birth to clouds and nurturing moisture, ascending to Jade Clarity, looking down upon the Supreme Ultimate, one thus becomes the Most High Perfected Person, bringing forth the essence of the Five Stars. The hidden subtle art is stored in the Cloud Pavilion, embracing the spiritual secret; those who accompany it also roam together. You must now seal all living beings, become the emperor of the Ten Heavens, with the mysterious name of the Jade Register, carved early in the Jade Pavilion. Let the initial Perfected Persons receive this secret chapter; let you transmit and implement it, surely you will find worthy ones. This scripture is the secret method of the Supreme Perfected and must not be passed to Earthly Immortals. From the beginning of transmission, one must have mysterious response and awakening, spirits informing the person; then one must purify and fast, swear an oath for three heavens. Within seven hundred years, three transmissions are allowed; after the limit, it must be hidden in the Five Mountains and no longer revealed. To leak the heavenly secret scripture is to inform the Heavenly Emperor, who punishes the three ancestors, then sends down the Three Officials, severing their life and body; in life they suffer water and fire, in death become lowly ghosts. All who study the True Way and receive this scripture have the Supreme Emperor’s eye-name Western Splendor Palace, with the orchid bamboo script in the Purple Palace; only those destined to be Perfected Persons obtain this text. Before you were born, five thousand years ago, your mysterious name was set and recorded, destined to meet this scripture. Do not think that receiving this scripture now is not part of your predestined fate. The Jade Emperor looks down upon all living beings; when he sees one who obtains this scripture, he immediately informs the Most High, who dispatches thirty-six flying spirit jade youths to attend the place where this scripture resides. He also commands the Supreme Ultimate to send thirty-two jade maidens of the Southern Hill to guard the names of the Five Star True Lords and their consorts. Together the jade youths and maidens guard the bearer of the scripture. Those who have the scripture all carry special cases; when opened and examined, they bow twice to the scripture and burn incense on either side. The jade youths and maidens oversee merit and fault, examine sincerity; if there is violation or kindness, they report directly to the Most High. You must be most cautious.

To cultivate this Way, within five years the jade youths and maidens appear in form to serve you. After fourteen years of practice, the Way is accomplished; you attain to ride with the Five Stars, ascend to the Jade Clarity Palace.

The Way of the Supreme Perfected has seven branches; the Way of the Most High has three; the Way of the Middle Perfected has six; the Way of the Lower Perfected has eight.

Second: The Most High Binding Jade Moon-Chasing Chapter  
Third: The Most High Eight Elements Star-Chasing Hidden Scripture  
Fourth: The Supreme Subtle Emperor Lord Flying Heaven Outline Scripture  
Fifth: The Lofty Great Cavern True Scripture Thirty-Nine Chapters

Seventh: The Huang-Lao Eight Ways Nine True Middle Scripture

The above Supreme Perfected Way, practiced in totality, makes one a Supreme Clarity Perfected Person, granted three thousand jade youths and three thousand jade maidens, ranked among the heavenly emperors. When practiced, the three-colored festivals proceed, led by myriad spirits and myriad Perfected Ones; the phoenix song leads in front, the mysterious ruler follows behind; the White Tiger opens the path, the flying dragon wings the carriage.

The Most High Way has three chapters, listed on the left:

Jade Clarity Hidden Scripture, Divine Tiger Great Talisman, Golden Tiger True Talisman.

The above Most High Way, practiced in totality, is the Most High Way, granted two thousand jade youths and two thousand jade maidens, ranked as the Supreme Perfected Jade Emperor Lord. When practiced, the five-colored divine festivals proceed, following a thousand Perfected Ones and myriad immortals; the heavenly ruler leads in front, the phoenix song follows behind; three Perfected Ones attend the carriage, soaring through the Nine Heavens.

The Middle Perfected Way has six chapters, listed on the left:

Supreme Elixir Hidden Scripture Morning True Supreme Scripture Jade Emperor Divine Talisman,  
Three Heavens Correct Dharma Phoenix True Text Nine True Ascending Mysterious Text,  
Three Primal Distribution Scripture Four True Chapters Supreme Golden Strategy,  
Square Various Cavern Chamber Jade Character Supreme Scripture Six Jia Spirit Flying,  
Spirit Treasure Secret Text Three Sovereigns Inner Text Heavenly Text Great Character,  
Azure Essentials Purple Scripture Curved Element Formula Words Three Five Sequential Practice.

The above Middle Perfected Way, practiced in totality, makes one a Supreme Clarity Middle Way Perfected Person, granted one thousand jade youths and one thousand jade maidens, ranked as the Supreme Clarity Left and Right Ministers’ teachers. When practiced, the purple-furred festival proceeds, following myriad gods and a thousand Perfected Ones; phoenix cries blow in front, heavenly rulers play music behind; the mysterious dragon opens the Way, the Five Emperors verify the carriage, flying through vast space, roaming the cinnabar sky.

The Lower Perfected Way has eight chapters, listed on the left:

Supreme Clarity Nine Transformations Ten Changes Three Nine Elements Speech,  
Elixir Scene Dao Essence Hidden Earth Eight Arts,  
Heavenly Pass Three Charts Mysterious Emperor Jade Scripture,  
Divine Land Seven Changes Seven Turns Cavern Scripture,  
Purple Degree Central Square Stone Essence Jade Horse Mother,  
Crimson Record Yellow Way Jade Eye Dragon Scripture Various Texts,  
Elemental Ode Central Chapter Five Phases Secret Talisman,  
Five Emperors Jade Mysterious Upper Origin Five Scriptures.

The above Lower Perfected Way, practiced in totality, makes one a Supreme Clarity Lower Origin Perfected Person, granted five hundred jade youths and five hundred jade maidens, ranked as Supreme Clarity Left and Right Grand Masters. When practiced, the five-colored festival proceeds, following myriad gods and jade maidens; nine phoenixes cry in front, eight luan birds blow behind; the white horned dragon opens the Way, the Supreme Ultimate verifies the carriage, flying in reverse scenery, roaming the purple chambers.

The Supreme Clarity Supreme Perfected, Middle Way Perfected, and Lower Origin Perfected Persons each have their respective scriptures for cultivation, each with chapters and sections, arranged accordingly. Those who cultivate the entire matter of one Perfected Way must obtain the complete scriptures of that Way and practice them together, thus becoming a Supreme Clarity Perfected Person.

If one obtains incomplete scriptures, or only the upper scripture, or only the middle chapters, or only the lower texts, though they practice diligently, lacking the others, they may only ascend as flying immortals. They may reach the Supreme Ultimate and descend to the Five Mountains, but cannot become the Supreme Clarity Three Perfected. You must diligently apply your heart to Heaven and Earth, open and inform the mysterious spirits, travel far to famous mountains, pray to myriad spirits, seek treasured texts, and perfect your dao and virtue. Having cultivated one section, ascending to Supreme Clarity, you will be granted jade youths and maidens numbering one thousand three hundred. If you only receive one scripture and not the others, the jade youths and maidens will be assigned according to the scripture received and guard accordingly.

Only by cultivating the *Most High Yu Ceremony Sun-Chasing Text*, *Binding Jade Moon-Chasing Chapter*, and *Eight Elements Star-Chasing Hidden Scripture* can one ascend to Supreme Clarity as a Lower Origin Perfected Person, due to not fully cultivating the Supreme Perfected Way. To surpass the others, all should be cultivated together; when the Way is accomplished by combined practice, one ascends to Supreme Clarity.

If one cultivates all three Perfected Ways’ scriptures, hears and sees the Jade Clarity Hidden Scripture, wears the Divine Tiger Great Talisman, one ascends as Jade Emperor Lord, Most High True One, granted thirty thousand jade youths and maidens, roaming the lofty pavilion, entering and exiting the Jade Clarity Palace. Then the Heavenly Emperor Supreme Subtle Lord comes to serve the Jade Emperor.

The *Jade Clarity Hidden Scripture* has four scrolls, once received by the Lofty Supreme Jade Emperor from the Jade Mysterious Supreme Emperor Dao Lord’s forbidden books. The Jade Emperor treasures this marvel, entrusting it to the Four Supreme Perfected Persons of the Supreme Ultimate, who guard the secret archives. Within five thousand years, three transmissions are allowed, given to the Supreme Clarity Jade Perfected Persons. If three persons appear within one thousand years, it is also permitted. After the limit, no further transmission is allowed. Among the mundane world’s millions, occasionally one person is chosen by the Heavenly True to receive this scripture. The Most High Mysterious Platform already has the jade name, destined to be a Supreme Perfected. Those who have the scripture at home are granted three hundred jade youths and three hundred jade maidens, who day and night bring myriad true immortals and mountain spirits to their chambers to discuss the Way and teach virtue. This is called having the scripture while still living in the mundane world, before departing to study the Way. When seeking mountains and tasting the spiritual text, one commands the six heavens, employs mountain spirits, summons the Five Sacred Mountains to pay homage; jade youths and maidens appear in form, attending the Perfected, burning incense.

The *Most High Divine Tiger Talisman* was given by the Most High Void Emperor Dao Lord to the Most High. The Most High Dao Lord gave it to the Three Heavens True Emperors to transmit to the Perfected and heavenly officials. This talisman, bearing the true name in Supreme Clarity, is worn by all who receive it. But those who have this talisman without the *Jade Clarity Hidden Scripture* cannot be Supreme Clarity True Ones, only Supreme Ultimate Perfected.

The *Supreme Subtle Emperor Golden Tiger Talisman* was given by the Most High Jade True Protector Emperor Dao Lord to the Most High Supreme Subtle Emperor Lord. The Heavenly Emperor has thirty-six, with the Supreme Subtle Emperor most honored; all heavenly emperors come to serve him. Those who receive this talisman command myriad gods and employ a thousand spirits, guarded by dragons and tigers, riding the clouds of the Three Elements, ascending Supreme Ultimate Supreme Clarity, honored as Left Duke.

The *Jade Clarity Hidden Scripture* is profound and remote; those of the Lower Perfected and flying immortals should calm their hearts with infinite hope. The *Divine Tiger Talisman* and *Golden Tiger Talisman* are sought tirelessly by flying immortals, some attaining the principle. Without the mysterious name and spiritual register, seeking without encountering this text is to be on par, let alone the Way of Jade Clarity.

The Most High said: In the past it was said that the Supreme Clarity was unattainable, how much less the Supreme Ultimate? It was said that the Supreme Clarity was not to be heard, how much less Jade Clarity? The bright middle has high and low; the mysterious has ranks and order. Beyond these, there is no further discussion.

The Perfected Persons below the Jade Clarity Palace are those above the Supreme Clarity Palace. The Perfected Persons above the Supreme Ultimate Palace are those below the Supreme Clarity Palace. The Perfected Persons above the Supreme Clarity Palace are those below the Supreme Ultimate Palace. From here downward, the flying immortals of the Nine Palaces are obtained.

When the *Jade Clarity Hidden Scripture* is to be transmitted, the Four Supreme Perfected Persons of the Supreme Ultimate each hold one scroll, presenting it to the Supreme August, Lofty Supreme, Jade Emperor, and Jade Mysterious Four Dao Lords, inspecting the golden register and jade name to confirm the Supreme Perfected Jade Lord, then releasing it. Those who have this immediately summon myriad true immortals to their chambers. If one cultivates the Way, the Most High no longer tests their condition. Those with the golden register and jade name are surely Supreme Perfected. The *Jade Clarity Hidden Scripture* is more wondrous than the *Yu Ceremony Text*.

Those who have the *Most High Yu Ceremony Sun-Chasing Text*, *Binding Jade Moon-Chasing Chapter*, and *Eight Elements Star-Chasing Scripture*, practicing their methods, the Supreme Ultimate Perfected no longer tests them.

Those who have the *Great Cavern True Scripture*, practicing its method, their seven ancestors and parents all shed ghost names, are forgiven by the Three Officials, recorded in the immortal registers, explained the difficult mysteries, sent to the Vermilion Fire Elixir Tomb Palace to learn the immortal Way. When the immortal Way is accomplished, they assist the Five Emperors as immortals of the Nine Palaces. Those who possess the *Great Cavern True Scripture* follow the Four Extremes’ fixed law, especially for their seven ancestors to attain immortality, differing from other scriptures, thus indispensable to cultivate. If one has cultivated it but is tested, yet only partially practices one Way or stops midway, unable to save themselves, they cannot bring immortality to their seven generations. Ghosts can learn immortality as people learn the Way. Seven generations establish virtue, thus blessing descendants to become divine immortals. One’s body cultivates the Way, fully understanding the cavern scripture, thus blessing seven ancestors; one should reverse this fetal form to become an immortal official. The Central Yellow Lord treasures this cavern scripture’s marvel, granting seven generations fortune, keeping it especially secret, paired with the *Yu Ceremony Text*. The Supreme Clarity myriad true also esteem this Way, as its merit adds to seven ancestors, virtue rising to former generations.

The Later Sage Lord Li received the *Eight Elements True Scripture Star-Chasing Hidden Scripture*, practiced its method, thus summoned the Supreme Subtle Emperor below to welcome him; the Five Stars rode the same carriage, riding the splendid Three Elements, ascending Jade Clarity, receiving the scripture as Supreme Clarity Golden Pavilion Emperor Lord.

**The Way to Ascend Jupiter:**  
The Year Star is a round mirror of wood essence, shining brightly on the eastern slope. Within the star are nine gates, each gate emitting nine sharp rays; the rays’ light extends nine million zhang. Each gate has a Blue Emperor, all guarding the central Blue Emperor True Lord. The central Blue Emperor is the Eastern Supreme True Blue Emperor Dao Lord, named Chenglan, styled Qingning; his consort named Baorong, styled Feiyun, governs within Jupiter, guarding the nine gates, wielding blue light flowing sharp rays to illuminate the True Ones above and below. To ascend, one must often envision the Year Star, focus the heart on the star, with the right hand patting the heart in salute, left hand covering both eyes, performing nine breath closures, then knocking the teeth twenty-seven times, swallowing saliva nine times, closing eyes beneath the hand, mentally calling the true emperor lord and consort’s names thrice, then saying: “I wish to ride with the Supreme Blue Emperor Lord Chenglan and consort, sharing the eight scenes’ jade carriage, ascending the Most High Palace.” After speaking, close eyes beneath the hand, facing the star, softly praying:

Heaven and Earth harmonize, essence flows eastward, gazing at the nine gates, flying rosy clouds scatter rays, the Blue Terrace holds the Blue Emperor, blue tusks hanging light, illuminating the Ten Directions, Lady Yu, styled Feiyun, dressed in spirit brocade, dragon cape and tiger skirt, waist bearing phoenix talisman, head scarf and splendid crown, emerging from non-being entering the void, roaming the Great Origin, leading the Blue Emperors ahead, followed by myriad gods, coming to greet and escort, becoming a flying true one, ascending Jade Clarity, the lofty chamber. Prayer complete, remove hands, open eyes to the star, absorb the star’s light twenty-seven times, retaining the star’s nine rays fully entering the throat. All complete, knock teeth thrice.

Practiced continuously for fourteen years, the Blue Emperor Lord of Jupiter reports to the Lofty Jade Clarity Palace, carving the Supreme Subtle bamboo slips, naming the jade script, ranked as Supreme Clarity Upper Flying True One.

Jupiter has nine gates, each with a Blue Emperor; each emperor guards a gate, serving the central Blue Emperor Supreme True Lord. The Blue Emperor is the Eastern Supreme True, the honored spirit of primal essence, entering and exiting Jade Clarity, befriending the Lofty Supreme. The gate Blue Emperors are called Blue Spirit Lords, Blue Gods, Blue Essence, or Blue Emperor Lords, all serving the central Blue Emperor. Practicing the Eight Elements secret Way summons the Blue Emperor to descend. Those who practice beyond the Five Spirits’ outer method summon the Blue God to bestow scripture. Thus the Way has depths and heights, and the summoned have ranks and order.

When the sky has no stars, on a cloudy evening, one may face east in the chamber to cultivate and pray. The heavenly Way is subtle, the mysterious thread minute; it is not necessary to face the stars to practice. When stars appear, one may go to the courtyard, sitting or standing as one pleases. This is called the Supreme Perfected Way to ascend the Eastern Star, not transmitted to Earthly Immortals.

**The Way to Ascend Mars:**  
Mars is a mysterious mirror of cinnabar essence, shining on the southern pavilion. The star has three gates, each emitting three sharp rays; the rays’ light extends three million wen. Each gate has a Red Emperor, three Red Emperors in total, guarding the southern Supreme Emperor True Lord. The star’s center holds the Vermilion Fire Zhu Yang Red Emperor Supreme Dao True Lord, named Weiting, styled Sanrong; his consort named Huaping, styled Xuanluo, governs within Mars, guarding the three gates, wielding red light flying clouds to illuminate the True Ones of the world. To ascend, one must envision the Fire Star, focus the heart on the star, with left hand patting heart in salute, right hand covering mouth, performing three breath closures, knocking teeth twenty-seven times, swallowing saliva nine times, closing eyes, mentally calling the true emperor lord and consort’s names thrice, then saying: “I wish to ride with the Vermilion Fire Red Emperor Lord Weiting and consort, sharing the eight scenes’ cinnabar carriage, ascending Jade Clarity Palace.” Then softly pray:

Mysterious image flows, vermilion light to southern darkness, gazing at the three gates, vermilion clouds and scarlet city, within is the Vermilion Emperor named Weiting, consort shining within, named Huaping, dressed in cloud and frost, phoenix flowers and dragon bells, waist bearing tiger script, head scarf flying blue, emerging from origin entering mystery, soaring the five cities, leading the Red Emperors ahead, followed by six Ding, coming to greet and summon, gaining true name, ascending the mysterious void, golden script Jade Clarity. Prayer complete, remove hands without covering mouth, open eyes to star, absorb the star’s light twenty-seven times, retaining the star’s three rays fully entering the throat. All complete, knock teeth thrice.

Practiced continuously for fourteen years, the Red Emperor Lord of Mars reports to the Three Primal Mysterious Upper Palace, carving the Mysterious Garden jade slips, naming the golden script, ranked as Supreme Clarity Upper Flying True One.

Mars has three gates, each with a Red Emperor; each emperor guards a gate, serving the central Red Emperor Lord. The Red Emperor is the Southern Supreme True, honored spirit of the cinnabar palace, entering and exiting Jade Clarity, befriending the Three Primal Supreme Emperor. The Red Emperor Lords within the star are called Red Spirit Lords, Red Gods, Red Essence, or Red Emperor Lords, all serving the central Red Emperor Supreme True Lord. Practicing the Eight Elements hidden scripture summons the Red Emperor to descend. Those who practice beyond the Five Spirits’ outer method summon the Red God to bestow scripture. Thus the Way has hidden and manifest, the text has secret and evident, and the summoned have ranks and order.

When no stars appear, on cloudy evenings, one may face south in the chamber to cultivate. When stars appear, one may go to the courtyard, sitting or standing at will. This is called the Way to rush the Southern Star, not transmitted to Earthly Immortals; transmission is forbidden and punishable.

Earthly Immortals themselves have the Eight Elements Scripture, discussing wearing royal qi and breathing methods. They also have the Nine Elements Scripture, discussing summoning ghosts, employing spirits to inspect souls and spirits, mainly for traveling mountains and attaining longevity and immortality. After the Eight Elements Scripture is the Heavenly Ruler’s Upper Quyang Song Nine Chapters; after the Nine Elements Scripture is the Phoenix Blow Dragon Roar Yin Song Eight Chapters—these are Earthly Immortals’ secret texts. Now the so-called Most High Star-Chasing Eight Elements is the Way of Supreme Clarity, not the Earthly Immortals’ Eight Elements. The Earthly Immortals’ roar songs await the Supreme Clarity’s roaming.

**The Way to Ascend Venus:**  
Venus, the Great White Metal Star, is a round mirror of metal essence, shining brightly on the western star. Venus has seven gates, each emitting seven sharp rays; the rays’ light extends seven million zhang. Each gate has a White Emperor, seven White Emperors in total, guarding the western Supreme Emperor Dao Lord. The star’s center holds the Great Element Lesser Yang White Emperor Supreme True Dao Lord, named Liaoling, styled Zhenxun; his consort named Biaoying, styled Ling’en, governs within Venus, guarding the seven gates, wielding white light flying essence to illuminate the Upper Origin True Ones. To ascend, one must envision Venus, focus the heart on the star, with right hand patting heart in salute, left hand covering both nostrils, performing seven breath closures, knocking teeth twenty-seven times, swallowing saliva nine times, closing eyes, mentally calling the true emperor lord and consort’s names thrice, then saying: “I wish to ride with the Great Element Lesser Yang Lord and consort, sharing the eight scenes’ pure carriage, ascending Jade Clarity Palace.” Then softly pray:

Seven qi fly brightly, light shines westward, gazing at the seven gates, spirit palace sharp rays, pure brilliance illuminating, virtue marks the metal clan. Within is Lesser Yang, called White Emperor, consort Ling’en, governing the jade chamber, dressed in bright brocade, flowing bells and tiger patterns, head scarf supporting dawn, waist bearing golden bells, emerging from emptiness entering void, roaming jade firmness, leading White Emperors ahead, followed by six Geng, coming down to greet, ascending the rampart palace, named Supreme Clarity, becoming True Lord. Spell complete, remove hands without covering nostrils, open eyes to star, absorb the star’s light twenty-seven times, retaining the star’s seven rays fully entering the throat. All complete, knock teeth thrice.

Practiced continuously for fourteen years, the Lesser Yang White Emperor Supreme True Lord of Venus reports to the Supreme Emperor Jade Emperor Palace, carving the Supreme Clarity Golden Pavilion, naming the jade slips, ranked as Supreme Clarity Left True Lord, overseeing the Supreme Ultimate.

Venus has seven gates, each with a White Emperor; each emperor guards a gate, serving the central White Emperor Lord. The White Emperor is the Western Supreme True, honored sovereign of the Great Element, entering and exiting Mysterious Clarity, befriending the Primordial Dao Lord. The gate White Emperors are called White Spirit Lords, White Gods, White Essence, or White Emperor Lords, all serving the central White Emperor Supreme True Lord. Practicing the Eight Elements secret marvel summons the White Emperor to descend. Those who practice beyond the Five Spirits’ outer Way summon the White God to bestow scripture. Respect and rank are profound; thus the Way has deep gradations.

When no stars appear, on cloudy evenings, one may face west in the chamber to cultivate. When stars appear, one may go to the courtyard, sitting or standing at will. If a quiet fasting Daoist, one may also cultivate the Five Stars’ true aspects within the chamber. All are Supreme Perfected Ways, rushing the Western Star, not transmitted to Earthly Immortals.

One night’s absorption of the Five Stars causes constant circulation; in spring absorb star light beginning with the east, in summer absorb star light beginning with the south, following the kingly moon with the kingly star first—this is the secret formula. The stars need not be in fixed directions, but follow wherever the stars are, practicing the formula facing that way.

When acting, if one does not wish others to see, one should act hidden and secluded. This is the Most High hidden Way, called the hidden scripture. Hidden and again hidden, lest ghosts and spirits steal a glance at the titles—how can it be allowed that the vulgar world lightly transmits it? Those who see these titles, though ignorant, have seven spirits within their bodies; seeing them is also leakage, so one must be deeply cautious. Those who cultivate the hidden scripture but reveal its titles must be examined by the Three Officials and are sure to cause calamity. Before inspection, always exclude others and living creatures like chickens and dogs, burn incense, bow twice, then examine.

**The Way to Ascend Mercury:**  
Mercury, the Round Mirror of Water Essence, shines reflecting the northern darkness. Mercury has five gates, each emitting five sharp rays; the rays’ light extends five million zhang. Each gate has a Black Emperor, five Black Emperors in total, guarding the northern Supreme Emperor. The star’s center holds the Supreme Mysterious Yin Primordial Black Emperor Dao Lord, named Qixuan, styled Jingchun; his consort named Xuanhua, styled Long’e, governs within Mercury, guarding the five gates, wielding mysterious light flowing bright qi to illuminate the northern primordial court, destined to be a Perfected Person. To ascend, one must envision Mercury, focus the heart on the star, pat the heart with both hands. After patting, raise both hands to cover both ears, perform five breath closures, knock teeth twenty-seven times, swallow saliva nine times, close eyes, mentally call the true emperor lord and consort’s names thrice, then say: “I wish to ride with the lord and consort, sharing the eight scenes’ azure carriage, ascending Supreme Clarity Upper Origin Palace.” Then softly pray:

Five qi fly mysteriously, light flows northward, gazing at the five gates, azure palace flourishing, sharp rays reach far, spirit reflects cloud shadows. Within is the Black Emperor, named Jingyuan, consort Long’e, both governing the mysterious gate, dressed in azure cape, purple brocade and scarlet skirt, waist bearing tiger talisman, head scarf lotus crown, emerging soaring nine voids, entering sounding jade ferry, leading Black Emperors ahead, followed by six Ren, coming down to greet, ascending purple chamber, named Most High, becoming Jade True. Prayer complete, remove hands without covering ears, open eyes to star, absorb the star’s light twenty-seven times, retaining the star’s five rays fully entering the throat. All complete, knock teeth thrice.

Practiced continuously for fourteen years, the Supreme Mysterious Emperor Lord of Mercury reports to the Lofty Palace, carving the Jade Chamber jade slips, naming the Jade Clarity purple text, ranked as Supreme Clarity True Lord.

Mercury has five gates, each with a Black Emperor; each emperor guards a gate, serving the central Mysterious Emperor Lord. The Mysterious Emperor is the Northern Supreme True, honored sovereign of the Supreme Mysterious, entering and exiting the Upper Void, befriending the Purple Essence Dao Lord. The gate Black Emperors are called Black Spirit Lords, Black Gods, Black Essence, or Black Emperor Lords, all serving the central Supreme Mysterious Black True Emperor Lord. Practicing the Eight Elements hidden Way summons the Northern Emperor to descend. Those who practice beyond the Five Spirits’ outer Way summon the Black Emperor Lord to bestow scripture. Respect and rank differ; thus the Way has hidden and manifest.

On cloudy evenings and when no stars appear, one may cultivate in the chamber or sleeping place. This is the Lofty Supreme secret Way, rushing to ascend the Northern Star, not known to Earthly Immortals or traveling immortals.

The Nine Palaces of Jade Clarity, Supreme Clarity, Supreme Ultimate, and Supreme Clarity each have officials, ministers, grand masters, marquises, arranged similarly, mutually governing and serving above. The palaces and pavilions are arranged in order, resembling each other, but the Way has honor and virtue with rises and falls.

**The Way to Ascend Saturn:**  
Saturn, the Round Mirror of Earth Essence, governs the yellow path. Saturn has four gates, each emitting four sharp rays; the rays’ light extends four million zhang. Each gate has a Yellow Emperor, four Yellow Emperors in total, guarding the Central Primordial Yellow True Lord. The star’s center holds the Central Yellow True Emperor Dao Lord, named Cangmu, styled Tanyan; his consort named Kongyao, styled Feixian, governs within Saturn, guarding the four gates, wielding yellow robes flowing qi, illuminating the Central Origin, overseeing those who study the True. To ascend, one must envision Saturn, focus the heart on the star, pat the heart with both hands. After patting, raise left hand to cover the upper cavity, perform four breath closures, knock teeth twenty-seven times, swallow saliva nine times, close eyes, mentally call the true lord and consort’s names thrice, then say: “I wish to ride with the Central Supreme Emperor Dao Lord and consort, sharing the eight scenes’ golden carriage, ascending Supreme Clarity Palace.” Then softly pray:

Four qi wander, converging in the Central Origin, gazing at the nine extremes, observing the four gates, yellow terrace and purple chamber, riding rays scattering light, spirit brilliance flourishing, heavenly flowers falling in jars. Within is the Yellow Emperor, named Tanyan, consort Qiande, called Feixian, governing harmony of life qi, guiding mysterious irrigation and origin, dressed in yellow clouds, dragon brocade and tiger skirt, waist bearing golden talisman, head scarf purple crown, emerging soaring mysterious void, spreading light through golden gates, leading Yellow Emperors ahead, guarded by six Ji, coming down to greet, ascending heavenly pavilion, golden script Most High, carved bamboo slips inscribed, flying through vast space, becoming Jade Minister. Prayer complete, remove hands without covering the cavity, open eyes to star, absorb the star’s light twenty-seven times, retaining the star’s four rays fully entering the throat. All complete, knock teeth thrice.

Practiced continuously for fourteen years, the Yellow Supreme Emperor Lord of Saturn reports to the Most High Palace, carving the Sky Terrace jade slips, naming the Nine Mysterious Elixir Text, ranked as Supreme Clarity True Lord, befriending the Four Extremes Supreme Perfected.

Saturn has four gates, each with a Yellow Emperor; each emperor guards a gate, serving the central Yellow True Emperor Lord. The Central Yellow True Supreme Emperor is the highest honored of the Central Pole, entering and exiting Supreme Subtle, befriending the Primordial Dao Lord. The gate Yellow Emperors are called Yellow Spirit Lords, Yellow Gods, Yellow Essence, or Yellow Emperor Lords, all serving the Central Yellow Supreme True Lord. Practicing the Eight Elements secret Way summons the Yellow True Dao Lord to descend. Those who practice beyond the Five Spirits’ outer Way summon the Yellow Emperor to bestow scripture.

On cloudy and starless evenings, all cultivate in the chamber, maintaining the five directions. The Perfected say: cultivating stars indoors is no different from seeing stars. Do not say that not seeing stars means abandoning it. This is the Most High hidden Way, the secret method to ascend the stars.

When swallowing the star’s light rays, one must fully retain the star’s true supreme emperor and consort, riding the light to descend, entering the mouth and throat, imagining their forms before the eyes. This is Lord Li’s secret formula.

Constantly cultivating the Most High hidden method, summoning and retaining the Five Stars’ supreme emperors, within five years their forms appear. After seven years they all appear, accompanying you in circulation. After fourteen years, the Five Emperors unite and descend, riding the mysterious splendid carriage, three elements’ purple clouds, led by the Five Emperors ahead, followed by myriad Perfected Ones; the Five Emperors carry you together, ascending the sunlit star, paying homage to Jade Clarity, bestowing scripture to become Supreme Clarity Upper Perfected.

The Most High Hidden Scripture of the Five Emperors Supreme True Five Passages Day is a Most High secret day, not told to the Nine Palaces’ immortals or Perfected. Only those with the Mysterious Jade Scripture, carved in the Golden Pavilion with names, know the day when encountered. The Five Passages are the heavenly essence opening freely, the Supreme True auspicious meeting, a day of celebration for myriad spirits and immortals. The days are: first month sixth day at midday, second month first day at feeding time, third month seventh day at midnight, fourth month ninth day at eclipse time, fifth month fifteenth day at midnight, sixth month third day at midday, seventh month seventh day at midnight, eighth month fourth day at midday, ninth month twentieth day at dawn, tenth month first day at dawn, eleventh month sixth day at midnight, twelfth month twelfth day at midnight. On these twelve months’ days, the Five Stars’ Supreme True Dao Lords ascend Supreme Clarity and Jade Clarity, meeting the Nine Mysterious Most High Dao Lords. Then a thousand Perfected Ones and thirty-six heavenly emperors descend, reaching Supreme Clarity flying immortals and above, celebrating at the Supreme Ultimate Palace. Also recorded is the diligence or laxity of those seeking the True Way in the world, listing the main names of those studying the scripture, carving golden pavilions, fixing bamboo slips, judging the merits and faults of the seven ancestors, the depth of sin and exile, the count of sins, so that the True Ones have ranks. If the seven generations have no sin and the body is diligent, they are recorded on bamboo slips, carved in jade text, ranked as Supreme Clarity Left True Lord. If the seven generations have many sins, even if diligent, they are only Lower True. If ancestors accumulated sin and oneself has many sins, even if diligent, one becomes a Lower Immortal. Early sins are not erased by merit; deep faults cannot be removed by diligence. The Five Passages are auspicious meetings for removing sin and fault; knowing these days brings hope. The Five True Ones pay homage; this is the Five Passages, reaching far and hearing, illuminating every detail. If you wish on these days to request pardon for your seven ancestors’ sins and your own past faults, I will instruct the Three Officials to request removal of punishment and exile, report directly to the Heavenly Emperor, erase sin records, forgive their servitude, scatter their misfortune records, so your seven ancestors may roam freely and enjoy themselves. You, having attained the True, your ancestors gain blessing; this should be so. Now, you must open your forehead and rejoice with your seven ancestors; this is the essential Way. If you rashly reveal these days as Five Passages days, you increase your sins fourfold; even if you repent a million times, it is useless. The Perfected keep silent and write by themselves; holding it in empty space, still fearing insects will glance at the text, violating secrecy; you must be deeply cautious.

Lord Li said: On those days, enter a quiet secret chamber, burn incense, face north, bow five times, mentally call the Five Stars Supreme True Lords and consorts’ names thrice, then knock teeth five times, then remove the headcloth and kneel long, respectfully petitioning the Five Stars, Sun and Moon Supreme True Lords, Dao Lords and consorts, Supreme Clarity Most High Supreme Emperor, Great Dao Sage Lords before them. Then confess your seven ancestors and parents below, down to yourself, a thousand sins and myriad faults since past lives, begging for release. The Three Officials report to the Heavenly Emperor to remove sin names, erase black slips. Beg to ride with the Five Stars’ true ones, rushing the splendid dawn, ascending Supreme Clarity, crossing the jade gate. Recall the roots of your faults, list sins in detail, confess sincerely; only exhaust yourself.

On this day of repentance, the Most High hears directly; this is the Most High auspicious meeting, the heavenly immortal celebration of the Supreme Emperor’s day. The myriad true emperors offer dragon robes, phoenix capes, tiger belts, flying robes to the Supreme Emperor; thus this day is treasured, releasing punishment and name. Those who do not know this Five Passages day cannot follow the example of sin removal. Those who seek the True Way must always practice it and keep its day secret, not letting others know. The Later Sage Lord Li said: On this day, think to retain auspicious matters, wish to fly immortal, avoid a hundred worries, lest spirit and soul grieve; establish virtue and charity, aid the poor and needy, perform merit and spread grace; do not wield punishment. This is the Most High auspicious day. The Most High on this day dispatches jade youths and maidens to secretly observe those studying the Way, their sincerity. Before you speak, your intentions, whether good or evil, are already known and reported to the Supreme Emperor. On this day, purify and fast, do good deeds; this is important.

The Later Sage Lord Li fully received the mysterious teaching, practiced and attained the Way, riding the eight scenes’ carriage, ascending the Supreme Clarity Palace, receiving the scripture as Golden Pavilion Emperor Lord. On the day of departure, he wrote by hand the Five Stars’ central emperor lord and consort’s names, and the Most High Five Passages auspicious days, on white jade slips, one scroll written in cinnabar jade, sealed in a cloud-rush case, stamped with the three light seal, placed in the White Stone casket of Mount Hua in the Western Peak, with inscription on the casket: “Heaven and Earth’s precious treasure, the supreme mountain’s rarest archive.”

He also wrote another scroll on green jade, inscribed in yellow jade, sealed in a phoenix jade case, stamped with the morning true seal, placed in the Green Stone casket of Mount Tai in the Eastern Peak, inscription: “The Ten Heavens’ secret chapter, the upper spirit’s hidden cavern.”

Another scroll on mysterious jade, inscribed in blue jade, sealed in a jade firmness case, stamped with the Supreme Mysterious seal, placed in the Yellow Stone casket of Mount Heng in the Southern Peak, inscription: “The Eight Mysterious supreme treasure, the Supreme Perfected’s spiritual garden.”

Another scroll on golden jade, inscribed in green jade, sealed in a vermilion gem case, stamped with the Lofty Emperor seal, placed in the White Stone casket of Mount Heng in the Northern Peak, inscription: “The Seven Spirits’ supreme Way, the Most True’s special palace.”

Another scroll on blue jade, inscribed in golden jade, sealed in a literary jade case, stamped with the Central Yellow seal, placed in the Mysterious Stone casket of Mount Song in the Central Peak, inscription: “The Nine Heavens’ special archive, the Five Sacred Mountains’ palace abyss.”

Another scroll was given to each of the Five Sacred Mountains, to be guarded by their lords. On a day of the auspicious Renchen meeting, the Sage Lord descends, commands the Five Mountains, opens these casket scriptures, entrusting them to the four high ministers, to teach the talents of the Supreme Perfected.

Another scroll, written with white plain patterns and eight colors, penned by hand, arranged with prayers and spells to attain the True Way, breathing in and out, advancing and retreating to seek the Way of the Five Stars, dividing the scripture into Five Passages, to explain the days of sin removal, titled: *Eight Elements True Scripture Most High Hidden Scripture*. It was entrusted to the True Void Perfected Person and the Red Lord of the Southern Peak to teach the Way below. Long ago there were true golden and jade characters, carved in the Golden Pavilion, reserved for Perfected Persons, not to be transmitted beyond Earthly Immortals.

Those who obtain the Most High Eight Elements Hidden Scripture are all recorded in the Purple Palace’s mysterious register, jade names carved in Supreme Clarity, destined to be Perfected Persons, thus receiving it. Among the mundane world’s millions, occasionally one is mistakenly given by the heavenly gods this scripture. Some obtain it but do not practice; all are by fate sent as messengers of the Supreme Perfected. Do not doubt; though received but unpracticed, they become corpse-released immortals, but cannot become flying immortals or Perfected Persons. After corpse release, they gradually tread the high and subtle path, awakening their confused hearts. But using years is a short time, then returning to true transcendence. You must strive and keep secret.

The True Void Perfected Person received the teaching and reported below: This is the Most High spiritual text, the wondrous Way to ascend the dawn. Three transmissions are allowed within seven hundred years. The Supreme Administrator Lord said: Within one hundred years, two persons may be granted; those who attain true spiritual response may also be granted, but only three transmissions within seven hundred years. All must purify and fast for seven days before granting the scripture; the receiver likewise. They must also swear an oath and open their hearts. Those who receive and practice the Five Stars to attain the Supreme Perfected Way are given a scripture master, forty feet of white silk, and two pairs of silver rings. Those who receive and practice the Five Passages are given a scripture master, thirty-two feet of blue cloth, as a lifelong covenant sealed with blood not to leak, a trust not to divulge. Then the Three Officials report directly to the Heavenly Emperor, who requests jade maidens to serve the receiver; reports to Supreme Clarity, which requests jade youths to attend the Eight Elements spiritual text. Each with thirty-two attendants, all recording the receiver’s faults and merits, carefully noting the slightest detail, reporting immediately to the Supreme Palace. If not human but granted, exceeding limits, revealing the hidden scripture, declaring auspicious days, not swearing oaths, not trusting secret words, all violate the *Four Extremes Bright Regulations* on secrecy, the three ancestors and parents are examined by the Three Officials, becoming lowly ghosts, punished by the stones of Meng Mountain, attached to the Five Mountains, drawing water from the dark sea, pouring into the four rivers, without immortal hope, suffering seven courts of hell. You must be most cautious when transmitting and practicing, guarding these precious secrets. The Most High warned Lord Li earnestly, fearing loss of the Way. Also, this scripture contains the Five Emperors Supreme True Dao Lords and consorts’ names and the Five Passages days; it is not suitable for the unawakened to know, increasing the burden of secrecy.

The Later Sage Lord Li said: If you dwell in the mundane world at home, not yet cultivating the supreme Way, fearing the myriad evils, thousands of demons and hundred devils attack your spirit qi, then at midnight, facing the five directions, first close breath five times, each yin side praying the carved Five Mountains stone casket inscription thrice. From the Western Peak’s white jade slip, the other four mountains each have a scroll; only then may you reach the white plain chapter, praying thrice. After three prayers, knock teeth thirty-six times, removing all evils, restraining the three souls, controlling the seven spirits. This prayer is not from external sect scriptures; these words have no chapters or sentences. The hundred evils, three souls, seven spirits do not fear this. The Way’s marvel is mysterious beyond the crowd; even the title can restrain evils, check souls and spirits; how much more the scripture treasured within the stone casket? The hundred ghosts, myriad spirits, thousand evils and many demons roam famous mountains, serving spirits, all seeing the Five Mountains Lord Li’s stone casket inscription, but not knowing what Way scripture lies within. Daoists should always pray this inscription; the ghosts believe people cultivate the scripture inside the casket, thus fearing and not daring to approach.

### True Void Perfected Person’s Secret Formula

True Void Perfected Person said: The former master taught: On the Five Passages day, when the sun rises three or four zhang, stand upright, facing the sun, holding the three souls and spirit with the sun’s light entering the heart. After a while, hold breath three breaths, swallow saliva three times, softly pray:

The sun scatters rays, hanging light purple-blue, entering my soul, illuminating my five forms, repelling ghosts testing the heart, making the heart calm and upright, inner penetrating nine qi, outer connecting fetal life, flying immortal ascending Supreme Clarity, jade register already fixed. Prayer complete, wipe eyes twenty-seven times with hand, knock teeth twenty-seven times, all complete. This method makes the three souls bright and clear, the cinnabar heart upright, all evil hidden arts, the heart tested not acting, truly essential Way; you should often practice it. On Five Passages days, facing the sun to induce sneezing; if no sneeze, use a soft object to guide the nose toward the sun to induce sneezing, then pray:

Heaven’s light comes in, six fetuses pass, three souls guard spirit, seven spirits not lost, receiving the sun’s sneeze, sharing the sun’s light, flying immortal ascending Supreme Clarity, ranked as True Lord. Prayer complete, wipe eyes twenty-seven times. This causes inner essence to ascend and join the sun’s light, the three souls to shine within, opening the heart and spirit, myriad essences circulating within the inner palace. If not on Five Passages day, this is not necessary.

Also on spring Yimao day, summer Bingwu day, autumn Gengshen day, winter Renzi day, when lying in darkness, first grind cinnabar, realgar, and orpiment finely, wrapped in cotton to the size of a date. Before sleeping, plug both ears with these; this is the Way to eliminate the three corpses and refine the seven spirits, a secret method. Do not let others know. The next day at noon, wash with east-flowing water, then redecorate bedding, change clothes and wash off old dirt, change shoes and bathe, then sprinkle and sweep under the bed, keeping the entire room clean. Arrange the pillow, lie facing upward, hold breath firmly for a while, then softly pray:

Heaven’s Way is constant, change renews, the Supreme Emperor’s auspicious day, bathing makes true, three qi eliminate corpses, cinnabar and orpiment calm souls, precious refine seven spirits, intimate with me. Prayer complete. This Way eliminates and refines corpse filth, the key to changing and renewing form. Each season takes only one day for this. Those receiving scripture and elders always have jade youths and maidens carefully watch the recipient and place, examine the root of the heart’s secret, whether fully or partially given. You should understand this intention. Those receiving (Bei Wei) must not scatter selfishly to avoid hunger and cold. Violators perish by the Three Officials, becoming lowly filthy ghosts; the Three Officials add this sin to the three ancestors. This is the Most High oath, a blood covenant. When entering famous mountains and becoming immortal, all must cast it between rivers, forests, caves, or distribute to mountain dwellers. If dying under the moon, if no spiritual response or message is given, all must be taken with oneself. Those receiving scripture likewise; at that time the mysterious realm must bring dreams and signs, the Supreme Perfected jade youths illuminating and confirming the form and words, deciding what is appropriate.
