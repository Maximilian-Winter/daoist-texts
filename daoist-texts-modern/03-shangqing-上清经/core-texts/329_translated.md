## The Purple Clarity Flying Spirit’s Eight Transformations Jade Talisman

The art of the myriad transformations of the profound true Dao of the Eight Earthly Transformations: first, to hide form and conceal shadow; second, to ride the void and command the sky; third, to vanish and soar to the azure heights; fourth, to emerge from existence and enter non-being; fifth, to fly the spirit to the eight directions; sixth, to unravel form and escape transformation; seventh, to return at dawn and revolve the mysterious; eighth, to conceal in earth and dance in heaven.

This is the wondrous art secreted within the golden terrace and jade chamber of Sublime Clarity, stored in jade volumes, sealed with golden marks, attended by jade youths, guarded by jade maidens, each numbering eight hundred. The Most High Jade Dawn Venerable Sage received it from the Nine Mysteries, and after seven thousand years passed it to the True Person of the Supreme Ultimate, the Great God of Eastern Splendor, the youthful disciples Fang, the Divine Kings of Fusang and Yanggu, and the True Person of Pure Emptiness. They swore an oath in Sublime Clarity, cleaving gold as their vow.

Whoever bears its script shall vanish into the eight directions; those who cultivate its art shall ride the void and harness the scenic light. It is passed mouth to mouth, forbidden to spread recklessly; sons do not show fathers, ministers do not serve lords with it. Only the golden slips bear its name and jade manuscripts. To lightly reveal its secret text brings calamity upon the Seven Mysteries; the body becomes a lowly ghost, blocking the river’s source. Such is the divine truth—secret and revered.

## First Art: The Technique of Hiding Form and Concealing Shadow

On the day of the Beginning of Spring, at dawn, enter your chamber and sit facing the northeast corner. Imagine dense purple clouds, thick and lush, descending from the northeast corner’s Gen palace, filling the entire chamber, dimming light inside and out.

“Return to the origin, transform the shadow, reflect the radiant orchid, cover my purple walls, conceal my golden city, merge with the vital breath rod, reveal not my form.”

When finished, swallow nine times and stop; open your eyes and wear the Flying Spirit Jade Talisman. Cultivate this for one year, and your form shall constantly vanish into emptiness. On days of peril, stand upon the Gen palace, take your natal earth element, and pinch it as a shield.

## General Instructions for Cultivating the Eight Arts Dao

Before seven days have passed, fast, purify, bathe, burn incense, and enter your chamber at sunset. First chant to dispel demons and control myriad spirits, following the prescribed method. When cultivating the eight arts, call the true names of the eight scenes and the sixteen secret yin names, all are kings of the eight palaces, commanding true immortal officials. Knowing their names keeps the aspiration to immortality steady, repels evil, and allows stepping the heavenly thread, treading the essence of the five stars. This is the work of the eight scene kings, descending true scenes, merging with vital breath.

The sixteen secret names are: first, Mysterious Prosperity; second, Cultivating Spirit; third, Flying Mystery; fourth, Shining Light; fifth, Demon King; sixth, Flying Storehouse; seventh, Union of Sprouts; eighth, Communicating Spirit. There are also secret yin names, spoken only by the master.

Cultivating for one year grants escape of the body; two years, riding the void; three years, vanishing and sinking; four years, entering non-being; five years, ascending the eight directions; six years, unraveling form and escaping transformation; seven years, revolving the five dawns; eight years, entering earth and ascending heaven. Those who persist long emerge and enter the imperial dawn, feast and ride cloud wheels, roaming Sublime Clarity.

This sublime text was composed by the Most High, the wondrous purple clarity manuscript. When one encounters its text, the golden slips bear its name. According to the mysterious method, it has been transmitted for seven hundred years, passed through eight persons, sealed with golden slips at the Five Sacred Mountains, and compiled in famous mountains.

The Flying Spirit Jade Talisman is to be offered in ritual at midnight on one’s natal day, facing north, kneeling and praying. Thus the spirit flies with the six Jia stems in the same text. Its script is lofty and profound, its oath especially deep. According to the mysterious true white silk forty feet long, purple patterns eighty feet, golden knobs eight pairs, replacing the list of pledges. The giver is called master, the receiver disciple. Violating the method and breaking the oath invokes the seven ancestral tests of the wind blade; one’s body becomes a lowly ghost, enduring five sufferings and eight calamities, never to be restored through myriad kalpas. Keep it secret and guard it carefully.
