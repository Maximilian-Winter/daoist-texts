### Scripture of the Nine Primal Centers of the Supreme Emperor Lord of Shangqing — Upper Scroll

**Transmission of the True Man of the Great Void, Immortal of Southern Peak, Master Chisongzi**

**Inner Instructions of the Scripture of the Nine Primal Centers of the Supreme Emperor Lord**

The Central Yellow Elder Lord is the younger brother of the Supreme, Most Subtle Heavenly Emperor Lord. In the second year of the Reigning Era of the Clear Void Supreme Emperor, the great chaos first gave birth; the sun shone with doubled brilliance, its light joined in sacred radiance, five clouds veiled and covered, auspicious smoke and mysterious stillness. At the age of seven, he already knew the essentials of longevity and the methods of the celestial immortals. Thus, he quietly gathered his thoughts, reverently received the profound truth, in serene contemplation of spiritual imaginings, his heart dwelling in the source of spirit, his body embracing the Eight Extremes, grasping emptiness and casting completeness. He freed himself from the net of literary adornment, donned simplicity in the abode of emptiness, traversed the vast dark continent, explored mysterious waves and towering clouds, held the reins of escape and transformation, purified the principles of myriad paths, kindled the cold wind of wondrous awakening, concealed and soared high to roam the celestial disk, stirred the primal mystery beyond Heaven, moved the nine breaths at the rosy ford, released the elegant orchid waves, condensed the clear swirling stillness, sounded strange tones and deep echoes, clouds gathered with eight mists, contemplated the principle of the Great Beginning, meditated on lofty images, sought the path in the Ten Directions, searched the hidden spiritual origins, gathered the whirlwind to shake the brush, concealed the subtle and hidden, eyes opened wide to the gateway of primal mystery, hands spread wide in the courtyard of myriad slumbers, looking up with joy at the divine craftsman, looking down with compassion at the five calamities, wandering with the master’s contract, mysterious and bright in mechanism, washed the spirit’s brilliance in the Book of Changes, returned thoughts to true spirit. Thus, the Supreme bestowed upon him the Scripture of the Nine Primal Centers of the Emperor Lord, the chapters of the Eight Secret Words of the Dao, to cultivate the path to accomplishment, receiving the text as the True Man of the Supreme Ultimate.

The Supreme Ultimate has four True Men; the Central Yellow Elder Lord dwells on its left, adorned with the dragon’s mysterious script, the talisman of the divine tiger, wearing the flowing golden bell, holding the purple-furred scepter, crowned with a golden essence kerchief. Sometimes he supports the morning splendor crown, rides the soaring dragon of luxuriant flowers, and mounts the three pure clouds.

The Eight Secret Words say: Those who desire to practice the Dao of the Nine Primal Centers must fast long and keep a pure chamber, regularly on the third day of the third month, the fifth day of the fifth month, the ninth day of the ninth month, and on their birth day, bathe in flowing eastern water with five fragrant essences; also on the day of the Jiazi at midnight, after bathing, burn incense on left and right, face their birth sign, bow twice in heart, and recite this prayer:

*Supreme Most High True One, Nine Spirits’ Radiant Essence, Emperor Lord’s Five Spirits, Supreme Unity’s Returning Light, grant me flight as immortal, ascend the Purple Court, bathe in the Flowery Pool, body and spirit purified, Peach Lord guards my fate, Emperor Lord returns to the infant, connects with the Great Void, five viscera self-generate.*

The Supreme said: Man only binds essence and accumulates breath, receives the fetus and gathers blood, yellow and white condense in secret, cinnabar and purple combine as smoke; thus bones condense and saliva is emitted, fluids disperse and flow, four seasons meet and transform, the nine palaces form one knot, five spirits command the shape of the body, the Supreme Unity fixes the register of talismans. Suddenly one stands, mysteriously one completes, invisibly one is equipped, and spontaneously one is born. Then the nine spirits come to enter, residing in their palaces; the five viscera are mysteriously born, the five spirits preside therein. Parents only know the beginning of birth, but do not perceive the Emperor Lord’s five spirits arriving to dwell within. The human body has honored spirits, their dwelling is not fixed, entering and leaving the upper, middle, and lower fields, cycling yin and yang, discarding the old and receiving the new, turning and flourishing, flowing and nourishing primordial fluids. The great spirit is born in emptiness, internally bound to form one body, irrigating substance and transforming, changing light and clarity. It is not like the three souls and seven spirits, but accumulates spirit and receives breath, self-generated from human parents. The Emperor Lord’s nine souls transform their forms at once, suddenly becoming honored spirits, nine in number, called the Nine Primal Lords. This is the Supreme Unity Emperor Lord’s fusion and transformation as one. Divided into upper and lower, they adapt to myriad paths. If one can cultivate them, one passes through water and fire, the five viscera constantly live, fasting and seclusion preserve their truth. This text is called the Nine Primal Inner Instructions, also called the Supreme Flying Text, also the Foreign Release Chapter, also the Divine Land’s Spiritual Manifestation; though four names, it is one precious scripture.

**First Primal Method:** On the birth day of the first month, on the days of Jiazi and Jiaxu at dawn, the Emperor Lord Supreme Unity’s five spirits unite and fuse, transforming into one great spirit within the heart, called the Lord of Heavenly Essence, styled Flying Birth Supreme Hero, appearing like a newborn infant. At dawn on that day, enter your chamber, place hands on both knees, close breath, gaze inward, preserve the Heavenly Essence Lord seated in the heart, called the Great Spirit. Let the Great Spirit’s mouth emit dense purple breath, encircling nine layers outside my heart, breath rising to the Mud Pellet, inside and outside as one.

This is the nine souls and seven spirits transformed into five spirits condensed, the Emperor Lord’s nine transformations, the Supreme Unity’s three Dipper talisman registers fixed, recording the mysterious purity, ensuring long life without death, ascending to the immortal court. This Dao is profound and secret, treasured by the upper spirits; without immortal registration, one may not hear it; without prior contract, one may not see it. Those who hear and see respond to fate and birth, unite with spirit and obtain it; thus mysterious responses and auspicious meetings, drawing the master’s subtle guidance, heavenly gods come to pass, jade splendor connects and shines, hence the Nine Primal firm heart, the Eight Ways’ awakening and observation. This is the union of the Three Primes’ talisman, not to be sought by common travelers. First declare the oath, then it may be revealed.

**Ninth Primal Method:** On the twenty-eighth day of the eleventh month, and on the birth day, and on the day of Bingzi at the hour of Si, the Emperor Lord Supreme Unity’s five spirits fuse and transform into one great spirit in the Mud Pellet’s purple chamber, called the Supreme Flourishing August Lord, styled Primordial Spirit Source. This spirit is the Emperor Lord’s father and ancestor; thus from the nine transformations of the mixed soul, it returns to the form of the grandfather, descending to the Upper Palace. It fixes the name in the immortal register, unbinds the knot in the womb; the knots in the womb cannot be dispersed without the ancestor, cannot be opened without the father, cannot set the soul straight without the Emperor. Therefore the grandfather must come to nurture, fix the form and spirit to endure long. At the appointed time, one must bathe, burn incense on left and right, enter the chamber and sit calmly, place hands on knees, preserve the Supreme Flourishing August Lord in the Mud Pellet’s purple chamber, let the mouth exhale purple breath, encircling the head nine layers. Then again let the mouth exhale purple breath, encircling both eyes inside and outside nine layers. Then again let the mouth exhale purple breath, encircling the tongue nine layers. Then again let the mouth exhale purple breath, encircling the teeth nine layers. In all four nines, thirty-six rounds of breath, making the entire body inside and outside dense and clear, like the sun shining within the body. When all is complete, knock teeth thirty-six times, swallow saliva thirty-six times, and recite:

*Ancestor Lord of Supreme Flourishing, Emperor August Primordial Spirit, guards the purple chamber, palace in the Mud Pellet, yellow gate and golden chamber, fused as nine souls, souls generate myriad transformations, thus forming the Emperor Lord, five spirits attend, seven breaths ascend true, dragon robes and phoenix capes, purple, emerald, and blue edges, holding imperial talisman, head crowned with splendid crown, left wears jade brilliance, right bears tiger pattern, seated beneath sun and moon, mouth exhales purple smoke, circulating breath on teeth and tongue, moistening eyes and lips, releasing cinnabar into the void, calling soul and summoning spirit, condensing essence and solidifying fetus, six directions long rejoicing, ascending to the Supreme Subtle, appointed immortal official.*

Thus the Dao of the Nine Primal Centers completes the year. Circling and beginning anew, the Mud Pellet leads spirit, eyes clear and bright, five viscera self-generate, blood vessels preserve fluids. If the body has not ascended, combined form still dawns, then one should veil the light and show the mundane, temporarily entering the Great Yin. The body passes through the Three Officials, the Three Officials do not violate. Then the Nine Primal summon the soul, Supreme Unity guards the body, the Three Primes protect breath, Supreme Unity gathers the soul, bones and flesh immortal, five viscera unfallen, able to die and live, able to yin and yang, pass from void into non-being, Heaven and Earth both generate. Therefore Daoists cultivate purity and stillness to nurture form, responding to the Nine Primal breath. The Three Primes fly essence in fullness and emptiness, Supreme Unity embraces my corpse and returns substance — how subtle, how profound, how subtle, how profound!

Those who constantly cultivate the Dao of the Nine Primal Centers have myriad gods bowing, ten thousand ghosts serving. If passing through Great Yin, then form and body immortal, five viscera self-generate; after twenty-four years, rebirth again. Suddenly awakened, fully aware, clearly recalling the day of entering Great Yin, like a night’s sleep. Suddenly outside the coffin, brightly seated atop hill and mountain — this is the mysterious subtlety of the Nine Primal, the utmost spirit of the Emperor Lord. Those who walk this Dao desire few words and quiet heart, speech not reaching death, correct conduct without excess, speech not reaching lust. Also cherish breath and nourish spirit, conduct life calmly, close breath to the utmost, exhale breath to the subtle, pass from void into non-being, continuous without end. This is where the Emperor Lord dwells, where the Mysterious Mother is close, able to preserve the five spirits, able to contemplate the Nine Primal.

**Supreme Element Shangqing’s Method of the Five Spirits of the Emperor Lord**

Always on the Wuxu and Wuxi days at cockcrow, close eyes and preserve the eastern blue breath as large as a bowstring, coming from the sun, filling the head’s Mud Pellet. Also two blue smokes emerge from the eyes, dense and thick, soon transforming into two youths, dressed in blue above and below, like infants just beginning to walk.

### Scripture of the Nine Primal Centers of the Supreme Emperor Lord of Shangqing — Lower Scroll

**Supreme Jade Morning Yu Yi Racing Sun Red Radiance Jade Text**

**Supreme Jade Morning Jie Lin Racing Moon Yellow Radiance Jade Chapter**

The right Racing Sun and Moon Hidden Dao, treasured secrets of the Supreme Ultimate Shangqing Supreme Emperor Nine Sovereigns Four True Men, the jade chapter of the Mysterious Void Primal Lord. Without the golden pavilion immortal name, and the green character Eastern Splendor, none may hear or see these two chapters’ titles. Those who practice first fast a hundred days, sever worldly ties, then perform it. Long practice leads to racing the sun and moon, gaining fifteen jade boys and jade girls each.

Supreme Yu Yi Red Text and Jie Lin Yellow Chapter are the spiritual secret chapters of the Supreme Jade Emperor Lord. Hidden in the Nine Heavens’ chambers, the cinnabar jade terrace, only those diligent in heart and fond of truth, with prior records of flying mysterious celestial immortals, can obtain and hear them. Hearing their titles cannot be rashly spoken; violators suffer the Three Officials’ trial, Heaven and Earth do not pardon. Initially one may transmit one person every three hundred years; afterwards one person every seven hundred years; if divine truth secretly reports suitability, then transmit. Transmission is always master to friend, to honor the mysterious ritual.

The seven spirits’ residual breath transform into dragons and tigers, guarding the human earth gate, lying beneath shoes and slippers. The three souls’ residual spirits transform into five spirit clouds, reflecting in their kerchiefs. If violated, the heart trembles and the mind is fearful, lost and confused, thus spirit weakens and soul scatters, essence and light dim and stagnate. Always be vigilant; beneath shoes and slippers no soil allowed, avoid foul earth’s breath; inside and outside clothes no filth allowed, avoid the stench of laziness. Attending the scripture are high jade boys and jade girls, seventeen each, who speak of the merits and faults of scripture holders, capturing ten thousand evils and misfortunes. If the child views the scripture, enter a separate chamber, burn incense on left and right. At transmission, face fasting and then hand over. According to transmission method, each faces fasting quietly, sincerely in heart, contemplates spirit and researches truth, uniting will. Now the precious scripture contains the Nine Primal matters and the names of twenty-four spirits, preserving thoughts and prayers, all spiritual words and upper sounds; thus received with heavy fasting, beginning the oath against leakage. Two persons each fast twenty-four days, then one day before and after fasting, when finished, hand over scripture to disciple. Disciple copies it, cuts hair and ties a knot, goes to master as proof. Now using nine zhang of white silk for the oath, biting the wound, using white plain silk as Supreme Element’s breath, using nine zhang as the Nine Primal number. After receiving scripture, no revealing or leaking allowed; violating virtue and destroying correctness, speaking much and losing practice, thus defiling the Dao’s truth. Those who follow this scripture ascend morning by day; those who violate the oath suffer seven ancestors’ hell trial.

Supreme Purple Essence Lord, Imperial Beginning Purple Spirit Dao Lord, always internally guard the cave chamber, watch the Nine Heavens, rest beneath the flower stars, sleep within the nine essences, restrain soul and spirit to ascend north, refine five spirits in true breath, roam the eight pure, list names in mysterious chart. Supreme Supreme Dao Lord chants:

*Upper purple gate, watch eight mornings, array cinnabar palace, possess bright spirit, roam nine breaths, dance heavenly immortals, kerchief sky blue, chant supreme calendar, belt clear fall, recite spiritual plan, summon whirlwind dragon, step twin white, lead purple youth, circle two reds, hide supreme element, conceal flowery wall.*

This speaks of the Purple Essence Three Emperor Lords, always bringing the five spirits’ Dao scripture. Supreme calendar means *Seven Saints’ Mysterious Chronicle*, spiritual plan means *Jade Emperor Scripture*.

---

**Ritual:** Do not teach to unworthy persons, do not violate law and order, to avoid leaking heavenly writings. Violating the oath and disrespecting the vow leads to death as lower ghost, seven ancestors’ trial for wind and fire sins. If not of the same breath, better to keep silent.

In the Western Mysterious Mountain Cave Terrace, these two scriptures are carved on jade slips, written in gold characters. Also in Wangwu Clear Void Heaven, they exist but not complete; only Supreme Mysterious Palace High Supreme Terrace and Penglai Mansion’s north chamber golden pillars and jade walls have complete carved texts. Central palace immortals and Supreme Clear officials do not know what these scriptures are.

In the northern cave of Mount Emei’s stone chamber door pivot, stone inscriptions read: “Yu Yi draws sun essence, Jie Lin brings moon spirit, attaining Dao at Upper Palace, position as Emperor Lord True.” Twenty characters in all; lower immortals see but the terrace does not understand. To practice and obtain this is not for foolish or wise, only earth lacks this text. True officials’ mysterious method, oath opens transmission; those with Dao and practice attain position as Supreme True, ride the eight scenic jade wheels, roam nine mornings, visit Supreme Element Palace, see Supreme Unity Emperor Lord, together court the primal morning. Hence the secret words say: “Child obtains Yu Yi and Jie Lin, then becomes true Shangqing; without cultivating the Supreme Dao, one cannot see the Three Primes.”

Receiving Eight Sceneries Elixir scripture, oath uses three pairs of golden rings, this is the ever-changing child’s round transformation oath. Together four oaths, invoking nine mornings as agreement, pointing to sun and moon as trust, must not leak, heart aligned with Heaven and Earth. If not reverent and faithful, body becomes lower ghost, seven generations and parents suffer trial of water and fire, crushed by mountain stones, thrown into piled night river. According to scripture master’s oath objects, they should be scattered in cold poverty, to rescue poor and sick, aid starving mountain rivers, serve spiritual public use. If privately cut for self-support, greedy and profiting, then scripture master’s seven ancestors suffer long trial in hell, body entering wind and fire, great pain. Also disciples and scripture masters love in harmony, thus intimate root. Dao and virtue thick, then enter ghost without gap; root intimate, then soul and spirit peaceful. If beginning reverent but end lax, not constant in virtue, what year’s life can be long, what immortal can be sought? Those who grasp it may be spoken to about seeking Dao’s beginning and end.
