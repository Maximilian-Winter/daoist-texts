### Scripture of the Supreme Clarity’s Most High Yellow Essence: The Forty-Four Divine Prescriptions

The Most High Great Dao Lord, mysterious, numinous, refined, and void-like, entrusted with supreme transformation, comprehends the principles of myriad truths, visits the Ten Directions, then summons the Eight Emperors by decree, conceals the restless waves of dawn’s summons, beheads the Six Heavens, rightly establishes the Three Dao, his majestic edge descending from the skies, radiating brilliance ten thousand fathoms deep. Thus he commands the Supreme Ultimate Perfected One and the Four Supervisors of the Upper Administration, ministers attending the Jade Dawn, to unveil the exalted treatise on the Correct Elixir of Yellow Essence, to strike down the cold spirits’ methods of transformation, thereby opening the Supreme Dao of the Eight Assemblies, setting forth the essential core of divine immortals’ prescriptions—altogether forty-four prescriptions, gathered into a single compendium, known as the Book of Yellow Essence. It was then sealed within a casket of Elixir Buds, wrapped in a brocade pouch of mysterious numinosity, entrusted to the Left Duke of the Immortal Capital, and stored in the Chamber of Seven Crystals. Moreover, he commanded thirty-seven Jade Maidens of the Northern Cold to constantly guard the body of anyone possessing this scripture. Following the clear regulations of the Four Extremes, it is granted transmission to three persons every seven hundred years.

The *Most High Yellow Essence Forty-Four Prescriptions* are all writings from the Nine Heavens, secret texts of the Eight Assemblies. Therefore, the Most High Dao Lord commands the Supreme Clarity High Immortals and the Supreme Ultimate Perfected One to classify and collect the items, arrange their sequence, and compile them into the Forty-Four Divine Prescriptions of Yellow Essence. These are the core principles established after striking down the Six Heavens. These chapters all arise from the commands of the Most High Sage, penned by the Upper Administrator’s brush; thus, the Dao is complete and supremely true, wondrously surpassing all other ranks. This is the so-called Correct Law of the Three Heavens, whose majestic sincerity suppresses the malevolent qi of the Six Heavens and exterminates a thousand demons’ ill omens.

Those with predestined fate who are meant to see this text are all profound and exceptional, surely summoned by divine immortals with fixed allotments. This divine scripture is not disseminated in the secular world; those who speak of it are pierced by the Three Heavens’ spies, reported to the Emperor Lord, charged with the crime of divulging secret oaths. Within less than three years, the Most High dispatches the Five Emperors’ divine soldiers to punish the offender’s body; death condemns them to the lower ghosts, their seven ancestors jointly examined by the Water Official.

Whoever receives the *Most High Yellow Essence Forty-Four Prescriptions* must, along with their master and disciples, fast and purify for forty-five days, avoiding worldly affairs. First, they must open the way to inform the divine spirits, carefully verifying to whom it may be entrusted before swearing the transmission. The oath uses a single jade tablet, one foot and five fen long, one inch and four fen wide, inscribed with the true oath of the Elixir Face O. Also used are forty feet of yellow essence, and two pairs of golden rings, to replace the blood-drinking oath boldly declared. Should one violate the oath after receiving the scripture, or transmit it to an unworthy person, the penalty is the same as recorded above—punishment by divine soldiers. Such is the utmost caution.

The Most High Dao Lord commands the Supreme Ultimate Perfected One and the Attendant Administrator of the Celestial Court to jointly compose the *Yellow Essence Divine Scripture of Forty-Four Prescriptions* as follows:

Anyone who reads the *Great Cavern True Scripture of Thirty-Nine Chapters*, able to interpret subtle sounds, speak without hindrance of mystery, exhaust the profound depths, expound and praise the numinous chapters, magnify the sound and thunderous resonance, master wondrous principles from all sides, quietly recite in solitude, clear and unimpeded—such a person is truly a talent of the Upper Immortals. Yet by reading this scripture, one can raise the Most High, seize the command of the Nine Truths, stand among the ranks of High Immortals, and fully manage life’s decrees. According to the *Most High Yellow Essence Forty-Four Prescriptions*, one may be called a Great Cavern Master. The Great Cavern Master is truly called “without clan,” overseeing the void and leading the mysterious, communicating with spirits and touching the subtle, radiating light to myriad truths, his rank equal to the Supreme Ultimate High Immortal. This is called profound study and secret responsiveness, not limited to countless traversals. If one merely has this scripture but does not study it or recite it in secret, they may still serve as the Most High’s chief and as master of ghosts and spirits.

Whoever reads the *Supreme Elixir Hidden Scripture of the Golden Flower Cavern* and the *Feminine One Precious Chapter*, able to savor the mysterious truth, grasp the principles of the Cavern Scripture, deeply awaken to the dark path, roam freely in the void court, touch all categories without obstruction, sincerely seek truth, proclaim in solitude, and secretly wish to communicate with spirits—such a person may be finely attuned to the Primordial Essence, ascend and descend the Nine Truths, blend the Five Spirits, and manage the life-recording chapters. According to the *Most High Yellow Essence Forty-Four Prescriptions*, they may be called a Master of the Three Caverns and the Primordial Radiance Perfected One. The Primordial Radiance Perfected One’s rank equals the Emperor One High Immortal. The Emperor One High Immortal oversees the void above, the supreme true of all spirits. If one only has this scripture but cannot yet study or respond to it, they may still serve as the chief of the Three Primes and undertake the duties of the Earthly Sixteen Immortals.

Whoever reads the *Supreme Elixir Hidden Scripture of the Cavern True Mysterious Scripture* and the *Emperor One’s Unbinding and Nourishing of the Hundred Spirits*, able to study deeply and respond secretly, penetrate mystery and reach spirit, return to refine the primordial essence, open and disperse the Seven Scriptures, resolve obscure blockages, savor the brilliance of the firmament—such a person is a mysterious and simple imperial window, mapping the Three Primes, thoroughly penetrating spirit and clarity, responsive to the meeting at Turtle Mountain. According to the *Most High Yellow Essence Forty-Four Prescriptions*, they may call themselves the Mysterious Cavern Master and Supreme Radiance Perfected One. The Supreme Radiance Perfected One’s rank equals the Nine Palaces Upper Immortal Grand Master. Such scriptures enable great blending of Emperor One, leading the Five Spirits, Nine Numinous Attendants, and the Three Officials’ ministers. If one cannot yet study and cultivate these matters, they may still serve as lords of the Three Heavens and undertake the Earthly Administration.

Whoever diligently studies the Three Scriptures, explains the wondrous texts, freely ascends to the supreme contract, indulges in the mysterious and distant flavor, such a person must surely possess exquisite jade books, golden registers, and jade names. Some receive the scripture at the start, seeing the spiritual person’s cause; some encounter this assembly and suddenly obtain it. Those who gain this scripture are all tested by the Supreme Ultimate, their sincerity observed, their rank and assembly judged; thus it is already set before bestowing, no need to fully venerate a master or swear blood oaths. According to the *Most High Yellow Essence Forty-Four Prescriptions*, they may call themselves the Chief Divine Method Supervisor, Supreme Radiance Sir, and the title of Nine Mysterious Grand Master. If they move the assembly and respond, with jade sounds and secret resonance, having traversed myriad cycles, blending male and female, then they may ride clouds and dragons, ascend the white day void, mount the Three Purities, and attain the rank of Supreme Ultimate Duke and High Immortal’s highest post.

Whoever obtains the Most High Dragon Book, Supreme True Dao Scripture, and the Jade Clarity Hidden Text of the Mysterious Feather Chapter, able to interpret subtle mysteries, judge doubts and explain the obscure, praise wondrous principles, touch all categories to completion, release aspirations to dawn’s firmament, and gaze upward savoring distant purity—such a person must surely possess golden books, jade registers, exquisite imperial scripts, mysterious true surging waves, pure void and gentle solemnity. Such talents must be Upper Immortals. According to the *Most High Yellow Essence Forty-Four Prescriptions*, they may be Masters of the Three Heavens and Most High Perfected Ones. The Most High Perfected One’s rank equals the Supreme Ultimate Immortal Duke. If one only has this scripture, then the Three Officials serve, the Four Bright Ones manage, myriad directions all harmonize; observing without omission, commanding ghosts and communicating with spirits, surely they will obtain Earthly Truth.

Whoever diligently tests and secretly directs, indulges in the mysterious truth, purifies with fasting to the utmost, reveres immortals, suddenly encountering these three grades of scripture without a master, such a person is all a mysterious assembly of past responses, listed in the imperial hometown as a perfected one. With secret transmission, they are destined to receive this scripture, their person outstanding and marked by worldly merit. According to the *Most High Yellow Essence Forty-Four Prescriptions*, they may hear secret oaths and divine methods. On the day of the Jiazi cycle, they must purify and enter a chamber at midnight, the hour of generating qi, sitting in repose at will, closing eyes in contemplation, knocking teeth twenty-four times, heart bowed to the Four Directions. Then softly recite:

“Most High Nine Numinous, Three Primordial Essences, Great Deity of the Immortal Capital, Four Extremes and Three Purities, once serving the Law of Transformation, meeting at the assembly scripture, mysterious masters far and deep, perusing true forms, beseeching secret oaths, sworn by divine spirits, jade youths guarding, jade blossoms supporting life, eight vows and nine unions, wondrous wisdom communicating spirits, wishing gods and immortals, flying to Jade Clarity.”

After the incantation, knock teeth twenty-four times again, swallow saliva ten times, bow heart before the scripture, then sleep or rise to recite the scripture—there will surely be auspicious responses. Regular practice for three years grants one the title of Scripture Master, fulfilling the role of Perfected One Grand Master. This is the inner method of Yellow Essence, no need to repeatedly seek masters or swear blood oaths. Even Perfected Ones who have received the scripture regularly practice this.

Whoever receives the Great Cavern Three Scriptures’ methods must seclude themselves in a quiet separate chamber, not mingling with the mundane. They must copy a full set cleanly as the book on the altar. Always offer incense, and set a separate bed facing east to stabilize the altar. When conducting divination rites, all must be done facing the seat; scriptures not permitted on the altar for reading.

All Daoists receiving the Three Grades True Scriptures, the Feminine One Cavern Mystery Hidden Feather Chapter, must diligently seek the supreme contract, respond to divine spirits, purify mind and fasting, dedicate themselves to the Dao for life, tirelessly savoring the brilliance and mystery. Such persons surely attain Upper Immortals. According to the *Most High Yellow Essence Forty-Four Prescriptions*, they may perform the Eight Morning and Three Morning inner rites and secret methods. On the days of Jiayin, Wushen, Gengshen, Dingsi, Jisi, Guihai, and Yihai, at dawn they enter the chamber, burn incense on left and right, close eyes in contemplation, knock teeth twenty-four times, bow heart to the Four Directions, then softly recite:

“Most High Supreme Spirit, Three Primordial Essences, respectfully on this auspicious day, inwardly present the true scripture, spirit youths and jade maidens scatter incense in the void court, making my gods and immortals, Heaven and Earth inclined.”

After the incantation, quickly close both eyes, merge inner and outer, neither hearing nor seeing. Knock teeth thirty times, swallow saliva three times, open eyes, all complete. This is called the Eight Morning Three Prime inner rite secret method. Regular practice enables one to communicate with spirits and see clearly, respond finely to the Three Primes, truly meet wondrous responses, ascend and descend the Great Mystery, serve the scripture jade maidens, present requests for life; immortals do not die, Heaven and Earth incline. Those not yet receiving the scripture who practice this for three years become scripture masters with spiritual auspiciousness.

Whoever cultivates and receives the Great Cavern True Scripture and Feminine One wondrous texts must have a separate chamber, avoid mingling with others, always place the scripture in a clean and pure place on the altar, burn incense and worship morning and evening, present vows to the human world, internally remove sin records. On the third, seventh, and twenty-first days of the month, the scripture jade maidens report human sins to the Three Primes and the Emperor One Lord in detail. On those days, one must enter the chamber, burn incense, knock teeth thirty-seven times, then softly recite:

“Divine prescriptions of the Most High, Great Cavern True Scripture, once by fortune encountering divine spirits, opening the seven charts, receiving the assembly of the Three Purities, if there is hidden sin, Emperor Lord scatters spirits, the Three Images open brightness, the Supreme Emperor unites form, commanding me to fly as immortal, divine truth eternal life.”

After the incantation, knock teeth twenty-seven times, bow heart to the Four Directions, open eyes, all complete. Regular practice causes secret responses of the Three Primes, Emperor Lord pardons offenses, all reported sins are not used.

All Daoists who keep in mind the supreme methods and cultivate the Emperor One’s affairs must avoid seeing dead bodies, blood, or filth. If one sees such, they may receive the Three Lights’ secret cleansing method. Using a single true cinnabar pellet, scatter it in water, then wash eyes, rinse mouth, wash hands and feet. Afterward, enter the chamber and bed properly, join palms, knock teeth twenty-seven times, bow heart to the Four Directions, then softly recite:

“Three Primes Supreme Dao, Emperor One protects form, Life Master Son, Five Spirits Huangning, blood and corpse scatter and vanish, evil filth sinks and disperses, seven fluids entwine, five organs flourish, command me as immortal, long enjoy benefit and virtue.”

After the incantation, quickly close eyes, use qi to merge inner and outer, neither hearing nor seeing. After a while, feel a slight heat in the body as a sign of completion. Knock teeth seven times, swallow saliva three times, all complete. This is called the Three Lights’ secret cleansing method.

Whoever cultivates and receives the supreme methods, wishing to see visions and insights, when opening the scripture box must burn incense on left and right, bow heart before the scripture, tap teeth three times, then softly recite:

“Jade Emperor’s supreme method, reported to the Three Purities above, auspicious day fasting sincerity, daring to open the divine scripture, myriad trials hidden, all directions succeed, jade youths guarding, jade blossoms scattering fragrance, report to the Three Primes, with me long life.”

After the incantation, open the scripture, then begin reading. This is called the Great Emperor’s scripture-opening method. Have jade maidens and jade youths guard, burn incense, summon descending spirits, reported to the Nine Heavens above.

All Daoists receiving and studying the Cavern Scriptures, cultivating Emperor One’s affairs, must not reveal the name of Emperor One Lord to those of differing intent. To reveal it is to violate the Great Mystery’s secret examination. Those who offend thrice will have the Five Spirits abandon their dwelling, never again becoming immortals. After passing thrice, death is as a lower ghost, no hope of transcendence remains.

All Daoists who receive the scripture must daily morning and evening recite Emperor One Lord’s name, first knocking teeth three times, then softly recite:

“Ascending Brahman, walking prosperously, Seven Spirits Elder, Emperor One’s endeavor, Five Spirits Huangning, ascending the Nine Heavens, alongside the Emperor, beseeching to fly as immortal, seven ancestors and fetus infants, releasing offenses and pardoning sins, ascending Jade Clarity.”

After the incantation, knock teeth seven times, swallow saliva three times. This is to preserve spirit, release sin, and petition the Emperor for immortality. Practice for seven years, and the divine spirits will respond, Emperor Lord pleased, Mysterious Mother assisting birth, Five Spirits always present, seven ancestors’ sins pardoned, receiving the Southern Immortal fetus, long life and deathlessness, ascending white day dawn.

All Daoists receiving student methods must not mention death matters. To do so causes life qi to fluctuate and not dwell with the Emperor; death qi enters, life spirit abandons, thus evil qi wanders the corpse, manifesting in bodily orifices, a sign of impending illness and death. Those cultivating Emperor One’s preservation of Five Spirits and the Nine Palaces’ blending with Emperor Lord must be careful not to harbor resentment or wish for their own death. After receiving scripture, those who reach age forty may no longer become Perfected Ones, serve scripture jade youths and maidens, or report to Emperor Lord, as it is considered the crime of fleeing life. Such are surely examined in the mysterious void, punished by the Most High, and within three years, the body will perish. This is the Yellow Essence’s regulation, the Great Mystery’s law.

All who cultivate and receive the supreme methods, and practice Feminine One and Emperor One’s affairs, must burn incense and recite spells to honor the divine spirits, not allowing bodily offenses or arrogance, nor falsely speaking of scripture methods to those of differing intent. Those who commit such offenses are recorded by scripture jade youths and maidens, reported to Emperor Lord. For each person told, one jade youth and one jade maiden are lost, returned to the Three Primordial Chambers. If three persons are told, all jade youths and maidens depart from the disciple. Sometimes scriptures are lost by water or fire disasters, or vanish unknowingly. If transmitted to unworthy persons, the Three Heavens’ life record officials punish the body, death as lower ghost, long servitude to the Water Official. This is the Jade Emperor’s regulation.

All who cultivate Emperor One’s affairs and the supreme methods of spirit preservation must carefully avoid seeing corpses or blood filth. Seeing a single corpse forbids practice for one year, losing a year’s merit. Yet this Emperor One regulation often forgives past offenses but blocks future ones. Seeing corpses for one year results in penalty of three years’ merit loss and interrupted affairs. Seeing twenty-four corpses forbids further cultivation of Emperor One’s quest for immortality.

All who cultivate and receive the supreme methods, Feminine One, and Emperor One’s affairs, have the qi of three souls and five spirits constantly permeating their clothes and hats; seven souls and nine spirits’ residual essence dwell beneath their shoes. Therefore, Daoist students do not mingle sleeping mats, wear coarse clothes, avoid borrowing others’ qi, and detest the filth of earth and dust on shoes. They also avoid allowing strangers to touch their belongings, so as not to disturb the three souls.

All Daoists who practice breathing and harmonize qi, preserve spirit and wear the rosy clouds, seeking the Dao of longevity, must not eat the five smoked vegetables, nor indulge in wine and lust’s diseases. Hence the ancient divine men say: The five smokes are the axe and hatchet that strike the storage; wine and lust are the coffin and coffin house that cause death. Only by severing the wounds of axe and hatchet, sealing the death house of coffin and coffin house, can one cross the path of life and death, extinguish the immortal’s trail.

Whoever wishes to dispel fear must always sound the heavenly bell at the left teeth twenty-six times before closing qi, then exhale sharply five times, constantly repelling refined evil qi and inauspicious qi. At night before sleep, stroke the heart three times, close eyes, softly recite:

“Supreme Spirit Nine Palaces, Emperor One guards the chamber, myriad gods take their places, souls and spirits harmonize, long life and deathlessness, sealing and reducing evil and calamity.”

After the blessing, sleep. This is called the Nine Palaces secret incantation for sleeping souls. Regular practice brings peaceful souls and spirits and constant auspiciousness.

When transmitting supreme methods, scripture masters must first seek spiritual response, then transmit. They enter a chamber, burn incense, secretly wish to the divine spirits, then bow heart before the scripture, softly reciting:

“Most High Primordial Lord, Immortal Capital Great Deity, today is an auspicious day, eight vows open, desiring to transmit such supreme method, daring to inform the spiritual origin, unknown if permitted, must await response before declaring.”

After the incantation, sleep; surely a spiritual response is received. The master knows their own heart’s goodness, carefully deciding to whom to grant.

When scripture masters transmit, they first bow heart to the Four Directions to invoke the divine spirits as the master’s lord. Then they take the scripture, stand, look to heaven and recite an oath, informing the spirits of the mysterious method’s covenant, stating the recipient’s name, opening the great deity, declaring the scripture’s items, making regulations and oaths, inscribing and pledging, combining elegant script and secret names. After the incantation, the disciple bows twice, kneels to receive, then bows again. This is the Perfected One’s internal method of oath to the gods, no need to always shed blood for the secret oath.

When scripture masters transmit, they must follow the above method, purify and fast in a separate place, avoid worldly affairs, inform the divine spirits, seek secret response, then transmit. If the true response is mistaken or inauspicious, this is the heavenly spirit revealing roots, forbidding transmission. If disciples disobey the spirits and transmit anyway, according to Yellow Essence regulations, they will be examined in the underworld, their seven ancestors’ souls long confined, body soon perishing, no hope of immortality.

Those who cultivate Emperor One’s affairs and wish to make vows must not kowtow. Kowtowing shakes the Nine Heavens, moves the myriad truths, causes the divine palaces to collapse, the mud pellet to invert, the Heavenly Emperor to cry in the upper palace, Emperor One to weep in the central field. Repeated thus, remembrance is useless, the Three Truths abandon their palaces, the Seven Spirits scatter, the mysterious abode receives misfortune—this is the Most High Five Spirits’ greatest taboo. Therefore, ancient Perfected Ones only keep kowtowing in their hearts, moving essence and response to act, never bending the body to pray.

Those cultivating Emperor One’s Dao, Perfected Daoists must not perform ritual bows, also forbidden by the Emperor Lord’s Five Spirits. If having deep thought and performing rites, only the heart bows, not the form. Those not cultivating or receiving supreme methods must not be like external scholars.

When Daoists enter fasting chambers and suddenly have spiritual responses or wondrous signs, auspicious dreams arise, all indicate the Dao’s desire to succeed. They must diligently cultivate to the utmost; no response surpasses the assembly. If not replaced, the true spirit jade maidens will rest in their beds. When lying down, one must face upright, knock teeth thirty-seven times, close eyes, softly recite:

“Highest Red Child, Elixir Emperor guiding the pearl, Emperor One exalted, condensing Heavenly Elder Wu, Seven Spirits ascend response, Five Spirits return roaming, spirit youths and jade maidens, revealing twin talismans, Seven Stars rising together, ascending morning hill.”

After blessing, knock teeth thirty-seven times, swallow saliva three times, open eyes, all complete. This is called Emperor One’s spirit retention and immortal meeting incantation. Practicing thus for three years, the Nine Heavens’ gods and the Great Mystery jade maidens will descend to guard.

When Daoists enter fasting chambers with sincerity, having cultivation but encountering many inauspicious things, strange blood lights, ghosts, evil spirits, and fear-testing beings, they must perform the Northern Emperor’s exorcism to kill evil spirits. First knock teeth thirty-six times, then recite:

“Two Images revolve and incline, mysterious One’s banner, Seven Spirits protect life, ascending to the Three Purities, twin emperors drive away, Heboluo’s troops, three hundred thousand, guarding divine camp, giant beasts with hundred patterns, spitting power to capture essence, wielding swords to chase evil, beheading demon spirits, divine elders’ curse, thousand demons destroyed.”

After blessing, knock teeth thirty-six times again. This is called Northern Emperor’s exorcism to kill evil spirits. All divine spirits and righteous qi hear this blessing, coming to serve and guard, while inauspicious qi dies instantly.

When Daoists lodge alone in mountains or forests, often tested by mountain spirits and evil ghosts, they must knock teeth twenty-seven times, hold breath, and recite:

“Yesterday I was summoned by the Emperor, commanding true essence, ordering me to seal and govern the Five Mountains, wielding the sword on Feng Mountain, mountain spirits and myriad souls, all summoned before the Emperor, Seven Spirits guiding, Three Primes managing truth, if any minor demons appear, immediately behead and destroy, mountain spirits and marsh marshals, swiftly come to serve, divine master’s command, reported to Three Purities, just like Great Cavern’s method.”

After the incantation, knock teeth twenty-seven times again. This is Emperor Lord’s spirit capturing incantation to strike mountain spirits and a hundred ghosts. All mountain gods, earth deities, ancestral spirits, and righteous qi hear this incantation, coming to wield whips and serve, divine soldiers guarding, as if lodging with thousands.

When Daoists hide in mountains and forests, meditating and sensing spirits, or reading Cavern Scriptures and making sounds, often the Northern Emperor’s great demons test and are defeated by humans. At dusk, they must knock teeth thirty-six times, then recite:

“Northern Emperor Great Demon King, serving before Emperor Lord, spring and creek ghosts, Four Bright Feng Mountains, thousand demons mixed forms, nine heads one body, divine tiger releasing poison, beheading thunderclap, divine lord spitting incantations, slaying without kin, Supreme Micro has command, capturing mountains and rivers, ringing bells clashing, radiating Nine Heavens, wind and fire campaigns, divine edge ten formations, fierce tests subdued and destroyed, myriad spirits beheaded, demon poison dares arise, sealed at three passes, requesting to follow Cavern method, none disobey.”

After blessing, knock teeth thirty-six times again. This is called Three Heavens’ Correct Law incantation to subdue demon spirits. Regular practice brings divine soldiers guarding, mountains and rivers capturing essence, thousand demons sealed, myriad tests not interfering.

Those who cultivate Great Cavern methods, Emperor One and Emperor One’s affairs, at dusk enter chambers, burn incense, bow heart before scripture, knock teeth twenty-seven times, then softly recite:

“Emperor One Exalted, Emperor One Mysterious Scripture, five clouds scatter brilliance, permeating Three Purities, jade youths and maidens burn incense and serve spirits, above wishes to open and present, merge with me, make me immortal, long prosper and benefit virtue.”

After blessing, knock teeth twenty-seven times again. This is called Emperor One’s incense burning, presenting wishes and merging spirit method. Those who do this regularly have jade blossoms guarding, divine spirits assisting truth, scattering fragrant incense clouds, reaching Nine Heavens above. Within three years, jade maidens and youths will all appear to you.

When Daoists enter fasting chambers with sincerity and have vows, at the meal they must hold a carved wooden pestle in the left hand three times, then softly recite:

“Two Mysterious Supreme Dao, Four Extremes pure and cold, Emperor One Lord, myriad spirits Huangning, receiving grain from Three Palaces, irrigating spleen spirit, upper feast of Great Harmony, tasting five fragrances, soul and fetus’s life, seven fluids flowing and stopping, hundred passages harmonized, five organs radiant, twin emperors combine brilliance, flying to Supreme Clarity.”

After the meal, tap the pestle three times again. This is called soul and fetus receiving fragrance, myriad spirits feasting method. Regular practice harmonizes spirit and qi, calms souls and spirits, repels evil and removes trials, always preserving benefit and virtue.

When Daoists arrange hair or wash head and prepare to let hair down, first knock teeth seven times, then softly bless:

“Supreme Emperor scatters blossoms, mysterious return great deity, today is auspicious day, arranging hair and washing dust, repelling evil and removing illness, long life immortal.”

After blessing, finish hair arrangement, knock teeth seven times again, all complete. This is called Supreme Emperor’s blossom scattering hair arrangement inner method, making one free from illness all year, ears and eyes sharp, head and mind free from pain.

When Daoists enter chambers to burn incense with vows, first knock teeth three times, then softly recite:

“Jade blossoms scatter brilliance, nine qi blend as smoke, incense clouds tightly woven, path piercing Nine Heavens, serving incense jade maidens, reported to Emperor above, commanding me long life, worldly true immortal, all wishes fulfilled.”

After blessing, bow heart and concentrate, also stating wishes as desired. This is called Supreme Constant secret incantation scattering incense, Nine Heavens descending spirits to chamber, wishing to meet gods and immortals method.

When Daoists travel alone lodging in mountains, forests, or temple seats, places rife with demon spirits and evil ghosts, must first knock teeth thirty-six times, close qi, softly recite:

“Supreme Emperor Yang Origin, four pillars dark gates, thousand demons ten thousand poisons, dare face me, giant beasts heavy bite, gutting and liver slashing, divine lord’s envoy, guarding camp, yellow-clad master soldiers, slashing demon souls, beheading thousand demons, crushing mountain traitors, exterminating species, commanding beheading and destruction, Jade Emperor’s supreme order, clearing Three Primes.”

After blessing, knock teeth thirty-six times again. This is called Supreme Constant waving spirit inner incantation, sealing and exterminating myriad demons method. Regular recitation brings divine soldiers guarding, myriad ghosts obeying, thousand demons dying subdued.

When Daoists prepare to sleep and undress, first knock teeth three times, stand and bless:

“Receiving command Supreme Emperor, ascending Nine Palaces, myriad gods in place, arrayed serving divine lords, souls and spirits harmonizing and refining, five organs flourishing, hundred nectars mysterious pouring, seven fluids filling emptiness, fire bells flashing, exterminating ghosts and removing calamity, upper wishes gods and immortals, eternal life without end.”

After blessing, knock teeth three times again, undress and lie down. This is called Supreme Emperor’s sleeping spirit exterminating ghosts and calamity method. It makes one sharp and healthy, souls and spirits always present, often auspicious responses.

When Daoists bathe body and wash hands and face, first approach water, knock teeth three times, then softly bless:

“Four Greats open mystery, Heaven and Earth constant, mysterious water washes filth, repels and removes inauspiciousness, twin emperors guard gate, Seven Spirits secure chamber, cloud ferry refining irrigation, myriad qi mixed and healthy, inner and outer benefit virtue, protect this yellow robe.”

After blessing, knock teeth three times again, then wash and bathe. This is called washing filth removing calamity Seven Chambers blessing method. Regular practice makes one’s spirit and blood pure, dispelling all evil qi.

When Daoists travel at night or enter fearful or trembling places, knock teeth twenty-seven times, then recite:

“I am a small true king, Three Heavens master lord, once receiving Most High divine prescriptions, killing evil writings, night traveling wandering corpses, seven evil demon souls, nine ghosts together robbing, thousand demons in groups, Heboluo troops, giant beasts arrayed, wielding sword cutting myriad demons, when I act they perish, dragon beacon seven alone, chasing evil without interval, Jade Emperor’s divine incantation, wielding sword east and west, exterminating calamity and evil, myriad ghosts suspended, Three Heavens correct law, all as I say.”

After blessing, knock teeth twenty-seven times again. This is called Three Heavens correct law removing Six Heavens secret incantation. Ghosts struck by this blessing become blind and lame, naturally dying. Wherever one travels with fear, just recite this, no need to travel at night. Regular recitation causes myriad demons to submit and thousand demons to perish.

When Daoists bless to exterminate the Three Corpses, always on the last and first days of the month, and on Jiayin, Gengyin, and Gengshen days, the seven souls’ wandering corpses, blood corpses’ ghosts, ascend to Heaven to report human sins, then return to harm the body or wander other places, called outer ghosts, joining as demon thieves. Thus evil dreams afflict the sleeping soul, illness troubles the spirit chamber. All who have evil dreams and illness are caused by the seven souls’ wandering corpses. On those days, one must bathe and wear clean clothes, burn incense and enter chamber, focus on the upper aspiration, not engage in other matters. At the hour of night’s generating qi or dusk, lying with head east, join palms, knock teeth thirty-seven times, then softly recite:

“Seven Spirits Five Gods, Eight Vows Four Declarations, reporting spiritual life, Central Emperor twin truths, recording souls refining spirits, sealing and extinguishing evil essence, blood ghosts wandering corpses, filth and stagnation long gone, harmonizing my life gate, closing my death gate, if there is dark fate, listen and answer before Emperor, grant me long life, kalpa age eternal, Supreme Emperor’s law, daring to report to Three Primes.”

After blessing, knock teeth thirty-seven times again, swallow saliva ten times, all complete. This is called Supreme Emperor’s soul regulation and corpse extermination divine incantation method. Blood corpses and seven souls struck by this incantation are all extinguished beneath the dead corpse, souls clear and spirits gentle, receiving transformation in the Three Palaces, repelling evil and removing illness, making one’s spirit immortal. Regular recitation ensures no weariness or darkness in life.

When keeping in mind the Supreme Dao and reciting to remove the Three Corpses, one must gather white angelica root and green sandalwood, boil with eastern flowing water, extract the juice, and bathe the body to repel all blood corpses and evil qi. One may also burn the mixed incense to summon divine spirits. If no green sandalwood is available, white angelica alone suffices.

On Gengshen and Jiayin days, the blood ghost and wandering corpse combine. On these days, heavenly qi mingles, seven souls compete in chaos, licentious filth mixes with truth, evil spirits radiate, bright laws diligently flow, Seven Spirits scatter. On these days one must fast and purify in a separate place, avoid mingling with others, carefully avoid seeing spouse or sharing bed. Also avoid competing for wealth or lust, as these are not Daoist ways. When burning incense and sensing qi, reciting incantations and scriptures mixed with spirits is also permitted. If contemplating the Cavern Chamber Emperor One’s affairs, only let essence and truth be the intention.

If Daoists suddenly have inauspicious dreams, or dream of fighting or being arrested by others, these are also caused by the seven souls’ wandering corpses. Or leading outer ghosts to enter the home, or three souls scatter and obscure, five spirits fight fiercely, or being bound and unable to return, causing bad dreams and misfortune. When lying down, face upright, join palms, knock teeth thirty-seven times, then softly recite:

“Nine Heavens Supreme Emperor, Four Gates Eight Spirits, Seven Chambers Two Mysterious, Three Primordial Essences, Emperor One Peach Blossom, ascending to Three Purities, please report to Emperor Lord, seize command Huangning, swiftly summon seven souls, verify the divine court, if there is misfortune, seven corpse ghost soldiers, follow twin truths, flow candle refining form, Supreme Micro Great Emperor, behead and strike evil essence, three souls harmonize and soften, blood corpses scatter and vanish, spirit returns to final abode, touching benefit and virtue, make me immortal, long preserve kalpa age.”

After blessing, knock teeth twenty-seven times, swallow saliva ten times. This is called Supreme Emperor’s divine blessing to repel dreams and remove calamity method. Those who practice this have harmonized three souls, controlled seven souls, correct spirit qi, corpse filth disperses, and the cursed ghosts are already received by hell. After three incantations, unless there is spiritual auspicious response, no more abnormal dreams occur.

When Daoists worship and vow to divine spirits, meditate on supreme methods, and perform secret incantations, they must burn incense, bow heart, and recite secret spells only, not allowing others to hear. If wishing to incant to strike the Six Heavens or exterminate evil ghosts, one may softly voice the incantation, but never loudly or clearly enough for bystanders to understand. When reading aloud, it is at one’s discretion.

On the eight festival days, all Three Heavens’ immortal spirits gather for feasts and rites. Those cultivating rites and vows must fast and purify on these days. As for new and full moon rites, these are not supreme methods.

On these days, when wishing to perform rites, vows, and recite incantations, first knock teeth seven times, bow heart to the Four Directions, then softly recite:

“Supreme Clarity Jade Emperor, Three Primordial Lords, Most High Great Spirit, Immortal Capital Great Deity, today is auspicious day, eight vows open, upper vow flying to the skies, long life immortal, middle vow Heaven and Earth, harmonizing wind and clouds, lower vow five organs, with me always, next vow seven ancestors, releasing and removing offenses, also vow Emperor Lord, severing fetal roots, sixth vow for all generations, wisdom fully opened, seventh vow exterminating ghosts, beheading Six Heavens, eighth vow descending spirits, thoroughly hearing east and west, upper vow united as one, none fail as spoken, wishing gods and immortals, ascending the Three Primes.”

After the incantation, bow again as at first, also stating wishes as desired, seeking release of seven ancestors’ offenses and one’s own sins to continue after rites. This is called the Three Primes Eight Morning secret incantation, the essential method of upper vows to gods and immortals. Practicing for three years, seven ancestors and parents, and one’s own sins, all are resolved. Then jade blossoms descend to guard, divine spirits respond, eight vows open, surely obtaining the essential contract of spiritual immortals.

The above *Most High Yellow Essence Forty-Four Prescriptions* are the Most High Great Dao Lord’s Correct Qi of the Three Heavens’ methods, later compiled into a wondrous scripture as a regulation chart. According to these scriptures, divine methods are truly wondrous; those cultivating life may surely apply them to govern the body. They are surely effective divine prescriptions. Unless one is a refined jade register of the Three Primes and possesses imperial charts and jade registers, the Forty-Four Prescriptions must not be contaminated. These divine prescriptions are wondrous beyond all other ranks, hidden in the imperial chambers. When transmitting, all must be High Immortals of superior rank, tested by the Supreme Ultimate, again reported to the Jade Emperor, and solemnly presented to the Most High before granting. This is the so-called Correct Law of the Three Heavens, linked in oath for seven generations, not transmitted to those lacking profound essence and nature. Those who violate Heaven’s prohibition and recklessly divulge the secret methods, their ancestral line is sealed in hell, their body examined by the Water Official—how can immortality be hoped for?
