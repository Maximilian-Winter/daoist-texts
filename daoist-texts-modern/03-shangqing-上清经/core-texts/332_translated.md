The Most High Jade True One’s Hidden Primordial Inner Observation employs the days of the Six Jia and the Six Ding of the ten-day cycles, at midnight—the very hour of vital breath’s birth—when the Heavenly Origin unfolds and manifests. The embryonic bonds are firm and dense; the seven souls ascend to report, the three spirits record transgressions, offenses against the Seven Ancestors accumulate penalties in the Three Yin. Hence, there is a method of elimination to liberate from faults and sins. Those who practice this dao are called seekers of immortality.

Always, on the day Ding Mao of the ten-day cycle Jia Zi, at midnight, one sits upright on the bed in the sleeping chamber, facing north, palms joined. After knocking the teeth seven times thoroughly, one then gazes upward, invoking the Seven Stars, making them shine brilliantly in the north. After a long while, one softly intones the incantation:

“First, the Great Star, Mysterious Pivot, Bright Yang Soul Spirit, Supreme Mysterious Nine Lords.”

Calling them seven times, then offering the prayer:

“May it be granted to remove the yang sins and yang offenses accumulated from the seven generations past until this body, all to be erased; may all wishes be fulfilled, all matters harmonize with the heart; may I swiftly ascend the Seven Primal Powers, and incline with Heaven; may my name be carved in the Dipper’s dawn, extending my record for a hundred million years.”

When finished, one envisions the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper descending from Heaven, flying into the mouth and directly entering the heart. One holds the star’s light, making inner and outer realms thoroughly clear, deeply contemplating this. This is called resolving the morning knots, the internal net reflected in the Supreme Dao.

On the day Ding Chou of the ten-day cycle Jia Xu, at midnight, one sits upright on the bed in the sleeping chamber, facing north, palms joined. After knocking the teeth seven times thoroughly, one gazes upward, invoking the Seven Stars, making them shine brilliantly in the north. After a long while, one softly intones the incantation:

“Second, the Primal Star, Northern Platform, Yin Essence, Heavenly Mysterious Soul Spirit, Supreme Jade Nine Lords.”

Calling them seven times, then offering the prayer:

“May it be granted to remove the yin sins and yin offenses accumulated from the seven generations past until this body, all to be erased; may the six energies be full and abundant, the four spirits operate in emptiness; may I swiftly traverse the Seven Primal Powers, inscribe the Jade Register, ascend to the Purple Clarity, ride the Mysterious Chariot of Nothingness, enter and exit with benefit and uprightness, and be in accord with Heaven.”

When finished, one envisions the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper coming from the midst of Heaven, flying into the mouth and directly entering the lungs, making inner and outer realms clear and the five viscera distinct. Again, one envisions the star entering the mouth, causing a sensation of light radiating and filling the mouth, a slight warmth felt within—this is the proof of the star essence entering.

Those who contemplate the Seven Primal Powers and preserve the Dao of the Nine Mornings must not share their sleeping bed or mat with others, nor their clothing. Men and women who share bedding bring upon themselves the register of sins in the Northern Mystery. Those who violate filth and defilement suffer calamity in the underworld. But friends and fellow practitioners sharing breath do not cause offense.

On the day Ding Hai of the ten-day cycle Jia Shen, at midnight, one sits upright on the bed in the sleeping chamber, facing north, palms joined. After knocking the teeth seven times thoroughly, one gazes upward, invoking the Seven Stars, making them shine brilliantly in the north. After a long while, one softly prays:

“Third, the True Star, Nine Extremes, Supreme True One, Primordial Perfected Person, Heavenly Mechanism, Soul Essence, Supreme Pure Nine Lords.”

Calling them seven times, then offering the prayer:

“May it be granted to remove the sins and offenses of death accumulated from the seven ancestors until this body, all evil and secret faults, offenses against Heaven, Earth, Water, and the Three Officials, all to be erased; may my eyes be bright and clear, my sight penetrating the hidden and obscure; may I swiftly traverse the Seven Primal Powers, have my name inscribed in Supreme Clarity, command myriad spirits, ascend to the Jade Court, ride the radiance and mount the void, inclining with Heaven.”

When finished, one envisions the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper descending from Heaven, flying into the mouth and directly entering the liver, making light shine upon the five viscera, inner and outer realms thoroughly clear. Then, holding the heart facing north, one bows twice; after bowing, swallowing saliva nine times suffices to rise from the bow.

On the day Ding You of the ten-day cycle Jia Wu, at midnight, one sits upright on the bed in the sleeping chamber, facing north, palms joined. After knocking the teeth seven times, one gazes upward, invoking the Seven Stars, making them shine brilliantly in the north. After a long while, one softly prays:

“Fourth, the Binding Star, Pivot Root, Profound Darkness, Heavenly Authority, Soul Essence, Supreme Void Nine Lords.”

Calling them seven times. Then offering the prayer:

“May it be granted to remove the ungrateful and unvirtuous, the unkind and unfilial, the countless tens of millions of yin evil sins accumulated from the seven generations until this body, all to be extinguished; may I take food and absorb essence, daily increasing; may I swiftly ascend the Seven Primal Powers, inscribe the Great Profound, be listed among the Jade Emperor’s retinue, ride the radiance of the Nine Heavens, command spirits and govern numinous beings, with sun and moon in harmony.”

When finished, one envisions the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper descending from Heaven, flying into the mouth and directly entering the spleen, making light clear and penetrating, illuminating the five viscera. Then swallowing saliva twenty-seven times.

On the day Ding Wei of the ten-day cycle Jia Chen, at midnight, one sits upright on the bed in the sleeping chamber, facing north, palms joined. After knocking the teeth seven times thoroughly, one gazes upward, invoking the Seven Stars, making them shine brilliantly in the north. After a long while, one softly prays:

“Fifth, the Main Star, Heavenly Balance, Cinnabar Origin, Jade Scale, Soul Spirit, Supreme Primordial Lord, Supreme Mysterious Nine Sovereign Lords.”

Calling them seven times. Then offering the prayer:

“May it be granted to remove the internal and external filth and sins accumulated from the seven generations until this body, all outer and inner cleansings and offenses numbering in the hundreds of millions and billions, all recorded in the hidden passes, all to be erased; may my body be filled with the Yellow Court, fully stabilizing the stomach; may I be listed among the Great Primordial, ride the radiance of the Purple Palace, with jade maidens on the right and jade youths on the left, sun and moon shining together, holding the position of True King.”

When finished, one envisions the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper descending from Heaven, flying into the mouth and directly entering the stomach, making light clear and illuminating, the five viscera distinct. Then swallowing saliva twenty-nine times.

On the day Ding Si of the ten-day cycle Jia Yin, at midnight, one sits upright on the bed in the sleeping chamber, facing north, palms joined. After knocking the teeth seven times thoroughly, one gazes upward, invoking the Seven Stars, making them shine brilliantly in the north. After a long while, one softly prays:

“Sixth, the Regulating Star, Life Mechanism, North Pole, Opening Yang, Soul Spirit, Supreme Cinnabar True Emperor, Void Nine Lords.”

Calling them seven times. Then offering the prayer:

“May it be granted to remove the evil sins and offenses committed and carried out, the treacheries, rebellions, chaos, and delusions that have summoned imperial officials, all accumulated from the seven generations until this body, all to be extinguished; may all illnesses be healed, body and breath be beneficial and upright; may my name be inscribed on the Immortal Terrace, engraved in gold in Supreme Clarity, commanding myriad spirits, flying through the Nine Luminaries.”

When finished, one envisions the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper descending from Heaven, flying into the mouth and directly entering the kidneys, making light clear and penetrating, the five viscera distinct. Then swallowing saliva twenty-seven times. On yang days, the star resides in the left kidney; on yin days, in the right kidney. One day is yang, two days yin. This dao especially forbids seeing blood, filth, foul odors, or eating mixed meats, pungent and spicy foods; violation causes calamity extending to the Seven Ancestors, and disaster descending upon this body, death as a lowly ghost, named “Removing the Imperial Gate.”

On the eve of the month’s end, before the cock’s crow on the first day of the new moon, one sits upright on the bed in the sleeping chamber, facing east, palms joined. After knocking the teeth seven times thoroughly, one gazes upward, invoking the Northern Dipper Seven Stars, making them shine brilliantly on the left side of the face. After a long while, one softly prays:

“Seventh, the Pass Star, Mysterious Yang, Heavenly Pass, Jade Radiance, Great Brightness, Most High Jade Emperor Dao Lord.”

Calling them seven times. Then offering the prayer:

“May it be granted to remove the hidden and obscure sins accumulated from the seven generations until this body, the countless tens of millions of divine numbers within the body punished by the Heavenly Net’s five penalties, all recorded by the Northern Emperor’s ghost officials, all to be extinguished; may my divine essence reach all directions, sitting, standing, and dying; ears hear no false sounds, eyes emit purple light; inscribe the Jade Great Primordial, thoroughly perceive the formless; may my name be recorded by the Emperor Lord, my fate balanced between two luminaries, flying through the Seven Primal Powers, resting and feasting in the Purple Court.”

When finished, one envisions the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper descending from Heaven, flying into the mouth and entering the pupils of the eyes, connecting and illuminating both eyes, making inner and outer realms self-illuminating, preserving and seeing the five viscera distinctly. On yang days, the star enters the left pupil; on yin days, the right pupil.

At the hour of midnight on the days of the Six Jia, one lies or sits on the bed in the sleeping chamber, head facing any direction at will, gripping firmly and holding breath to calm the spirit. After a long while, knocking the teeth nine times thoroughly, one envisions the Nine Stars of the Northern Dipper shining brilliantly above the nape, their light radiating and reflecting from the two stars in front of the dipper’s handle, shining mutually and reaching everywhere. Then one softly prays:

“Eighth, the Imperial Star, Most High Jade Emperor, Spirit of the Eight Radiances, Primal Lord; Ninth, the Revered Star, Supreme Micro Jade Emperor Lord, Spirit of the Great Primordial, Seven Morning Primal Lords.”

Calling them nine times, then offering the prayer:

“May it be granted to remove the sins and offenses of the nine ancestors and grandparents accumulated until this body, all hills, mountains, rivers, sources, great and small sins, recorded in the register of the dead, hidden evil and treacheries, secret deceptions, matters numbering in the billions, all recorded on the ghost emperor Feng Mountain, death sins and violations, recorded in the black register of the Northern Nine Primal Great Ultimate True Person; I beseech the Nine Primal Most High Emperor, Jade Mysterious Lord, to erase all matters; may I swiftly fly through the Seven Paths, ascend to Jade Clarity, roam the Great Nothingness, ride the radiance of dawn, feast in the Eight Pure Ones of the North, incline with the sun, attend the Imperial Consort, and command myriad spirits.”

When finished, one envisions the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper descending from Heaven, entering the Mud Pellet Purple Chamber, making it thoroughly illuminated, the light penetrating the entire body and five viscera, enabling inner and outer realms to generate purple light clouds, making them luxuriantly flourishing, deeply contemplating this. Then swallowing saliva thirty-nine times.

If the days of the Six Jia and the month’s end day, or the Six Ding days, are close or nearly coincident, one may adjust and measure the practice accordingly, not requiring frequent or too close repetition. Each matter must be accomplished thus, only to ensure completeness in the true method. Thus, the Most High Returning to the Origin and Erasing Sins Dao is complete.

The Most High’s Five Passages Days are sealed in the Jade Chest of the Five Sacred Mountains. The Hidden Returning to the Origin Dao is concealed in the Palace of the Nine Mornings. Having cultivated the Five Passages, one then proceeds with Returning to the Origin. The Five Passages open at the beginning of the Emperor; Returning to the Origin closes at the profound end. Therefore, those who cultivate the Five Passages and practice the Seven Primal Returning Hidden Dao do not eat blood, fish, or meat, nor see corpses or filth; violators undergo the Great Profound’s trial. The Five Passages are the Most High’s auspicious days; Returning to the Origin is the Most High’s day of renewal. Without knowing the Five Passages, one cannot resolve sins and erase offenses; without knowing the Returning to the Origin Hidden Dao, one cannot be listed among the Supreme True Ones. Always on those days, contemplate auspicious matters, first thanking the body for sins and offenses, thus resolving and freeing oneself from the punishments of seven generations, escaping penal names. This is not shown to the immortals within the Nine Palaces.

Those who cultivate within the grotto chamber and purple chamber, and those who preserve the Nine Primal and Seven Primal Powers, at the first waking and first lying down, and before and after meals, first softly pray:

“Five Stars, Five Passages; Six Harmonies, Purple Chamber; Returning to the Origin, Concealing the Dao; Dispelling the Seven Mornings; The one who gives birth to the soul is the Mysterious Father; the father transforms into one to become spirit; the one who gives birth to the soul is the Mysterious Mother; the mother transforms into two to give birth to the body; the one who governs my sinews and bones is the Noble Son; the one who governs my essence and breath is the White Origin; long life and long sight, flying immortally through the Ten Heavens.”

Finished, do not let the ears hear the sound of the prayer. This is the Most High Hidden Prayer, to dispel evil qi, summon spirit and numinous power, so that one never tires of obscurity throughout life.
