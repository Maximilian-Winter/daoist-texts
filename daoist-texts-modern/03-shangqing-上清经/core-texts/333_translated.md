### Scripture of the Supreme Clarity’s Most High Nine Truths: Secret Alchemical Formula for the Divine Elixir of Crimson Birth

Begin by closing the eyes and turning the gaze inward. If you sense anything lacking, then immediately burn incense while seated in perfect stillness with eyes closed, firmly grasping both knees. Preserve the essence and gather all spirits, reciting the incantation as prescribed in the above method. At dawn and midday, preserve the spirits and proceed from seated stillness, ensuring no one witnesses this. All is inward vision, held at the moment of closure. On the first night of the lunar month, at midnight, after preserving the spirits, also preserve the white vapor within the two eyes—like the size of a chicken’s egg—before the face. In a moment, it transforms into two bright mirrors, each nine inches in diameter, reflecting clearly the twenty-four spirits of my own body, front and back, with piercing clarity. After a long while, the heart utters this invocation:

Great Bright Treasure Mirror, dividing form and scattering transformation,  
Reflecting the primal spirit, subduing myriad demons,  
Flying to Supreme Clarity, unveiling the veil of clouds,  
Commanding a thousand spirits, sealing mountains and summoning rivers.

When the incantation ends, perform this once every five days. This is called “covering and checking the internal essence, gathering and inspecting the five spirits.” Those who constantly practice this will be free from disaster and ascend to the high ranks of immortals.

The Way of the Whisk-Bearer enables one to thoroughly see the Five Spirits of the Emperor Lord and the method of the twenty-four spirits. Always, on the cyclical day of Jiazi, the day Gengwu, at midday, take one sheng of pure water, drop one zhu of true elixir into it, stirring it counterclockwise three times and then seven times, reciting the incantation:

Mysterious Flow, Vermilion Ferry, first shining with eight lights,  
Body and spirit arrayed in multitude, all come to manifest form,  
Piercing vision ten thousand li, reaching the nine spirits,  
Emperor Lord’s reflected youth, enabling my essence to ascend.

When the incantation ends, face east and wash the eyes twice, seven times each. Those who practice this regularly will thoroughly see all spirits. The incantation must be whispered softly, washing the eyes with water facing the moon, always facing east.

### The Most High Perfected One Summons the Five Celestial Bodies in the Grotto Chamber, Registers the Flying Souls in the Six Harmonies, and Secretly Preserves the Hidden Path

### The Southern Pole Primal Lord’s Jade Scripture and Precious Formula

At midnight in pure stillness, whether seated or lying at ease, calm the body and purify the heart, broaden the breath and regulate the spirit. Turn the gaze inward and preserve the star of Venus in the west, located above the two eyebrows, called the Jade Pendant Purple Pavilion. One inch above the brow, straight in one inch, is the Jade Pendant Purple Pavilion. On yang days, preserve the star on the left brow; on yin days, on the right brow.

Next, preserve the star of the North Celestial Pole, in the imperial palace of the heavenly ministers at the center of the sky. From the nose straight upward, five fen short of the hairline, straight in one inch.

Next, preserve the star of Jupiter in the east, at the Vermilion Platform of the Grotto Gate. The Grotto Gate Vermilion Platform lies one inch behind the eye, straight in one inch. On yang days, preserve the star behind the left eye; on yin days, behind the right eye.

Next, preserve the star of Mars in the south, at the Jade Gate Splendid Chamber. The Jade Gate Splendid Chamber lies five fen inside the inner corner of both eyes, straight in five fen. On yang days, preserve the star at the left eye’s inner corner; on yin days, at the right eye’s inner corner.

Next, preserve the central guardian star, in the Golden Cabinet Yellow Chamber Long Valley. The Golden Cabinet Yellow Chamber Long Valley lies at the center of the philtrum, straight in two fen, the star appearing suspended above. When preservation is complete, imitate the star’s position and one should feel the five stars radiate light and emit five-colored smoke, penetrating the entire body, illuminating inside and out, as if star essence is entering and infusing the body. Then knock the teeth five times with five resonances, swallow saliva twenty-five times, and softly recite the incantation:

Lofty Purple Pavilion, within which the Emperor Lord is seen,  
The Great One’s unity, the gate of the Purple Chamber,  
Within the gate shines brilliance—this is the Three Primes,  
The Three Primes condense essence, thus there are Five Spirits,  
Precious radiance spreads its glow, shining fiercely at dawn,  
Essence transforms and accumulates, becoming an elder,  
First appearing with a pure countenance, green robe and crimson skirt,  
Right side adorned with flowing bells, left side with tiger patterns,  
Holding the heavenly cord, scattering crimson flying dawn,  
Feet treading splendid canopy, exhaling radiant streams,  
The Three Luminaries protect and guard, enabling me to attain truth,  
Nourishing soul and mastering spirit, riding the whirlwind to fly as immortal.

When the incantation ends, swallow saliva three times, knock teeth three times with three resonances. Those who can constantly practice this for fifteen years will be greeted by the Southern Pole Elder, Supreme True of the Elixir Mound, arriving in a carriage of green clouds; the Western Pole Elder, Su Ling Zi Qi, arriving in a chariot of yellow whirlwind; the Northern Pole Elder, Mysterious Supreme Immortal Sovereign, arriving on a dragon of dark radiance; the Eastern Pole Elder, Duke of Supporting Yang, arriving in a blue palanquin; the Central Prime Elder, Central Supreme Mysterious Son, arriving under a curved dawn canopy. The Five Elders unite and ascend together to the Purple Void. Practice without neglect, preserve with utmost precision. Avoid stepping on filth, forbid mixed company, always burn incense and bathe frequently. Those who violate this will wither away; those who comply will fly as immortals. After preservation, if you wish to make a wish, speak it in your mind after the incantation. Preserve the Five Stars together, their resting place two inches below the nape, and one inch to the side, stars like round pellets illuminating the grotto chamber and body.

On the first, fifteenth, seventh, ninth, thirteenth, seventeenth, twentieth, and twenty-fifth days of the lunar month, at cockcrow, preserve the images of the sun and moon in the soul chamber of the Six Harmonies. The soul chamber of the Six Harmonies lies above and outside both eyes at the upper corner, slightly raised in the high sky. Press and knock teeth; beneath the hand one hears the Four Assemblies moving—this is the place. Straight in one inch, nine fen square, called the Soul Chamber of the Six Harmonies. The sun is on the left, the moon on the right. Preserve and make bright the vision of the grotto form, commanding the imitation star to be in place, closing eyes and focusing intensely, allowing no escape. When complete, knock teeth seven times with seven resonances, swallow saliva nine times, and softly recite:

Great Bright Spirit Dawn, nine degrees dense blue,  
Summoning clouds hiding radiance, pouring and refining five forms,  
Palace carriage of the Six Harmonies, seven spirits harmonized,  
Enabling me to fly as immortal, soul ascending Supreme Clarity.

When the incantation ends, practice for fifteen years and the Jade Emperor will send three plain carriages to welcome you. One must nurture the ability to crow like a rooster, so that the master of dawn keeps regular hours. If one acts in secret, one will surely lose the radiance of the sun and moon. The Southern Pole Lady received this art from the Most High Supreme True, named “Twin Radiance Wings Form, Hidden Preservation of the Hidden Path.” Only those with immortal bones may hear this scripture.

### The Most High Returning to the Origin Hidden Path for Removing the Record of Sins: Inner Chapter

The Most High Jade True Hidden Origin Inner Observation, using the day of the Six Ding, is the time of vital energy. The Heavenly Origin is spread forth, the embryo is firmly bound, the seven souls report, the three spirits record faults, transgressions against the Seven Ancestors, accumulated sins of the Three Yins. Hence there is a method of elimination to dissolve and free from faults and sins. Those who apply this Way are those who seek immortality.

Always, on the cyclical day of Jiazi, the day Dingmao, at midnight, sit upright on the bed in the sleeping chamber, facing north, hands joined. Knock teeth seven times with seven resonances. Then look upward to preserve the Seven Stars, making them shine brightly in the north. After a long while, softly recite:

First Great Star, Mysterious Pivot, Yang Bright,  
Heavenly Pivot soul and spirit, Supreme Origin Nine Lords.

Call seven times, then recite the incantation:

May I remove all Yang sins and Yin faults from seven generations past down to this body,  
All be dissolved and eliminated, all wishes fulfilled, all matters in accord,  
Flying through the Seven Origins, leaning with Heaven,  
Names carved on the elixir tablets, extending records for countless eons.

When finished, again preserve the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper, descending from the center of Heaven, flying down into my mouth, straight into the heart. Preserve the star light, illuminating inside and out, deeply contemplate this—this is called untying the morning knot, the inner and outer void reflecting the Supreme Way.

In accord with Heaven.

When finished, preserve the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper, descending from the center of Heaven, flying down into my mouth, straight into the lungs, enabling clear vision inside and out, the five viscera distinct. Preserve the star entering the mouth, causing the eyes to perceive light radiance, scattering throughout the mouth, a slight warmth—this is the proof of star essence entering.

Those who think of the Seven Origins and preserve the Nine Mornings Way must not share their bed or bedding with others. Clothing likewise. Men and women sharing a bed are recorded as sins in the Northern Mysterious Register. Those who violate purity invite calamity and are cast into hell. Teachers and friends breathing the same air, mingling and resting together, do not count as violation.

On the cyclical day of Jiashen, the day Dinghai, at midnight, sit upright on the bed in the sleeping chamber, facing north, hands joined. Knock teeth seven times with seven resonances. Then look upward to preserve the Seven Stars, shining brightly in the north. After a long while, softly recite:

Third True Star, Nine Extremes Supreme True,  
Heavenly Mechanism soul and spirit, Supreme Pure Nine Lords.

Call seven times, then recite the incantation:

All accumulated evil and hidden offenses, violations of Heaven, Earth, Water and the Three Officials,  
All beseech to be dissolved and eliminated, eyes bright and clear, penetrating vision,  
Flying with the Seven Lords, names carved on Supreme Clarity, commanding myriad spirits,  
Ascending the Jade Court, riding the radiance chariot, entering the void, leaning with Heaven.

When finished, preserve the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper, descending from the center of Heaven, flying down into my mouth, straight into the liver, shining light illuminating the five viscera, inside and out. Then facing north, bow twice, swallow saliva nine times, or begin bowing.

On the cyclical day of Jiawu, the day Dingyou, at midnight, sit upright on the bed in the sleeping chamber, facing north, hands joined. Knock teeth seven times with seven resonances. Then look upward to preserve the Seven Stars, shining brightly in the north. After a long while, softly recite:

Fourth Binding Star, Rooting Mysterious Darkness,  
Heavenly Balance soul and spirit, Supreme Void Nine Lords.

Call seven times, then recite the incantation:

May I remove all sins without grace or virtue, unkind and unfilial,  
Countless evil Yin offenses from seven generations past down to this body,  
All be eliminated, taking in essence through food, daily progress,  
Flying to the Seven Origins, recording on the Great Mystery,  
Listed among the Jade Emperor, riding the swift Nine Heavens,  
Commanding spirits and guiding souls, sun and moon shining anew.

When finished, preserve the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper, descending from the center of Heaven, flying down into my mouth, straight into the spleen, illuminating clearly, shining on the five viscera. Swallow saliva twenty-seven times.

On the cyclical day of Jiachen, the day Dingwei, at midnight, sit upright on the bed in the sleeping chamber, facing north, hands joined. Knock teeth seven times with seven resonances. Then look upward to preserve the Seven Stars, shining brightly in the north. After a long while, softly recite:

All be eliminated, filling the body with breath, filling the Yellow Court,  
Calming the stomach, inscribing the Great Origin,  
Riding the radiance of the Purple Official,  
Right attended by Jade Maiden, left guarded by Jade Youth,  
Sun and moon shining together, position as True King.

When finished, preserve the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper, descending from the center of Heaven, flying down into my mouth, straight into the stomach, shining brightly, the five viscera distinct. Swallow saliva twenty-nine times.

On the cyclical day of Jiayin, the day Dingsi, at midnight, sit upright on the bed in the sleeping chamber, facing north, hands joined. Knock teeth seven times with seven resonances. Preserve the Seven Stars, shining brightly in the north. After a long while, softly recite:

Sixth Chronicle Star, Life Mechanism North Pole,  
Open Yang soul and spirit, Supreme Elixir Emperor Void Nine Lords.

Call seven times, then recite the incantation:

May I remove all sins and offenses from seven generations past down to this body,  
All evil crimes, treacheries, rebellions, and delusions,  
Recorded by the imperial officers, all beseech to be eliminated,  
Hundred diseases healed, body and breath aligned,  
Names carved on the Immortal Platform, inscribed in gold Supreme Clarity,  
Commanding myriad spirits, flying through the nine lights.

When finished, preserve the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper, descending from the center of Heaven, flying down into my mouth, straight into the kidneys, shining light illuminating clearly, the five viscera distinct. Swallow saliva twenty-seven times. On yang days, preserve the star in the left kidney; on yin days, in the right kidney. One day is yang, two days yin. This Way strictly forbids seeing blood, filth, foulness, or arrogance; forbids mixed foods, meat, or spicy flavors. Otherwise, the sins extend to the Seven Ancestors and reach the future body; upon death, one becomes a lower ghost, removed from the imperial gates.

On the eve of the lunar month’s end, the next day being the new moon, before cockcrow, sit upright on the bed in the sleeping chamber, facing east, hands joined. Knock teeth seven times with seven resonances. Then look upward to preserve the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper, shining brightly before my face. After a long while, softly recite:

Seventh Pass Star, Mysterious Yang Heavenly Pass,  
Jade Radiance Great Bright, Most High Jade Emperor Dao Lord.

Call seven times, then recite the incantation:

May I remove all dark hidden sins from seven generations past down to this body,  
All who suffer five punishments, countless spirits recorded by the Northern Emperor’s ghost officials,  
All beseech to be eliminated,  
May my spirit reach all directions, sitting and standing in deathlessness,  
Ears hearing silent sounds, eyes producing purple light,  
Engraving the Great Origin Jade, reflecting ghostly forms,  
Names carved for the Emperor Lord, fate burning with five lights,  
Flying with the Seven Origins, resting in the Purple Court.

When finished, preserve the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper, descending from the center of Heaven, flying down into my mouth, entering the pupils, illuminating both eyes, enabling inner and outer natural clarity, preserving vision of the five viscera distinctly. On yang days, preserve the star entering the left pupil; on yin days, the right pupil.

On the cyclical day of Jiaji, at midnight, lie or sit in the sleeping chamber, head facing any direction. Firmly grasp and hold breath, calm the spirit for a long time. Knock teeth nine times with nine resonances. Then preserve the Nine Stars of the Northern Dipper, shining brilliantly above the crown. Let the nine stars’ light, one star before the dipper handle, shine and reflect mutually. Then softly recite:

Eighth Imperial Star, Most High Jade Emperor Spirit,  
Eight Radiance Original Lords, Nine Honored Great Stars,  
Supreme Micro Jade Emperor Lord Spirit,  
Great Origin Seven Mornings Original Lords.

Call nine times, then recite the incantation:

May I remove all sins and faults from nine generations of ancestors and parents past down to this body,  
Hills, mountains, and water sources, great and small sins,  
Names on the death register, hidden evil and treacheries,  
Countless matters recorded on the ghost emperor’s Feng Mountain,  
Death sins and offenses recorded in the black register of the Nine Primes Supreme True of the Northern Nine Origins,  
Beseech the Nine Origins Most High Emperor Lord Jade Mysterious Lord,  
All matters be dissolved and eliminated, flying through the Seven Paths,  
Ascending Jade Clarity, roaming the Great Origin,  
Riding the dawn radiance, feasting in the Eight Plain,  
Attending the Imperial Consort, governing myriad spirits.

When finished, again preserve the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper, descending from the center of Heaven, flying down into my cinnabar field purple chamber, illuminating the cinnabar field, and shining clearly through the entire body and five viscera, enabling inner and outer to generate purple light and cloud vapor, extremely dense and flourishing. When finished, swallow saliva twenty-seven times.

If the cyclical day of Jiaji coincides with the lunar month’s end day or the cyclical day of Liuding, and the preserved thoughts conflict or are too close, one may adjust the sequence and measure the cultivation accordingly; no need to frequently overlap. Every matter follows this, only to be complete in true method. Thus ends the Most High Returning to the Origin Way of Repaying Sins. The Most High seals the Five Passages on the day of Five Passages, enshrining it in the jade box of the Five Sacred Mountains, hiding the Returning to the Origin Hidden Path in the palace of the Nine Mornings. Having cultivated the Five Passages, one then practices Returning to the Origin; the Five Passages begin at the emperor, Returning to the Origin opens at the mysterious end. Therefore, those who cultivate the Five Passages and practice the Seven Origins Returning Path must not eat blood or meat, nor see corpses or filth; violators suffer the Great Mystery’s test.

The Five Passages are the Most High’s auspicious meeting days. Returning to the Origin is the Most High’s day of renewal. Without knowing the Five Passages, one cannot resolve sins and remove evil; without knowing the Returning to the Origin Hidden Path, one cannot carve one’s name among the Supreme True. Always on these days, think to preserve auspicious matters, first thanking the body’s sins and faults, thus freeing seven generations and releasing form and name. This is not shown to the immortals within the Nine Palaces.

Those who cultivate the grotto chamber and purple chamber matters, and preserve the Nine Mornings and Seven Origins, at first waking, first lying down, at breathing times, and after meals, first softly recite:

Five Stars, Five Passages, Six Harmonies Purple Chamber,  
Returning to the Origin Hidden Path, opening the Seven Mornings,  
Soul be born from the Mysterious Father,  
Father transforms into the One Becoming Spirit,  
Soul be born from the Mysterious Mother,  
Mother transforms into the Two Becoming Body,  
Gathering my sinews and bones is the Noble Son,  
Nurturing my essence and breath is the White Origin,  
Longevity and long vision, flying immortal ten heavens.

When the incantation ends, do not let ears hear the incantation’s sound. This is the Most High’s secret incantation, to remove evil qi and bring forth spirit, so that one never tires of darkness throughout life.

### The Most High Nine Truths Emperor Lord’s Nine Yins Mixed Transformation of All Forms: Hidden Celestial Scripture

The Emperor Lord’s Nine Yin Scripture says: Therefore, to transform and divide form, to hide and sink into the eight directions, to conceal the body and hide the radiance, to enter the void and create darkness, to bring forth all things and summon and subdue the evil chief, one must always fast and cultivate the essence and thought of the Emperor Lord’s Nine Yins.

In the first star lies the Supreme Palace, within which the Emperor Lord’s transformed hidden escaping primal inner consort, named Supreme One Fa Dao, styled Xingzhengfu, wearing a yellow brocade robe and vermilion flying skirt, hair coiled like clouds.

In the second star lies the Central Prime Palace, within which the Emperor Lord’s inner consort protecting the fetus and transforming form, named Supreme One Three Urns, styled Luo Zhuying, wearing a blue brocade robe and green feather flying floral skirt, hair coiled like clouds.

In the third star lies the True Prime Office, within which the Emperor Lord’s six escapes and seven hidden upper prime elixir mother, named Supreme One Lingyi, styled Zhong Shuangzhao, wearing a blue brocade robe and embroidered feather flying skirt, hair coiled like clouds.

In the fourth star lies the Binding Hidden Office, within which the Emperor Lord’s inner consort concealing radiance and hiding light, named Supreme One Qi Lie, styled Heng Danpan, wearing a purple brocade robe and yellow floral feather flying skirt, hair coiled like clouds.

In the fifth star lies the Firm Spirit Palace, within which the Emperor Lord’s transformed body and changed radiance great female of the dipper, named Supreme One Yushu, styled Chou Qiulan, wearing a vermilion brocade robe and purple-blue flying skirt, hair coiled like clouds.

In the sixth star lies the Chronicle Bright Palace, within which the Emperor Lord’s hidden trace scattering multitude, middle female of the dipper, named Supreme One Qijing, styled Bao Dingling, wearing a vermilion brocade robe and blue embroidered flying skirt, hair coiled like clouds.

In the seventh star lies the Pass Assembly Palace, within which the Emperor Lord’s divided shadows and myriad forms, young female of the dipper, named Supreme One Yuhei, styled Tianfanji, wearing a cinnabar brocade robe and blue floral feather skirt, hair coiled like clouds.

In the eighth star lies the Emperor Seat Palace, within which the Emperor Lord’s transformed sun, moon, water, and fire, high emperor’s left consort of the dipper, named Supreme One Shi Qizhu, styled Luo Maohua, wearing a purple brocade robe and embroidered feather flying skirt, hair coiled like clouds.

In the ninth star lies the Supreme Venerable Palace, within which the Emperor Lord’s transformed metal, stone, mountains, and rivers, high emperor’s right consort of the dipper, named Supreme One Ai Tiao, styled Yun Yu, wearing a green brocade robe and emerald feather floral skirt, hair coiled like clouds.

These are the nine hidden consorts of the Emperor Lord’s Nine Star Dipper Palaces. When reciting the incantation, only utter the titles and names, not the robes or hair below. Those who can know the Emperor Lord’s Nine Yins ascend at dawn to the heavens, their position as Supreme Clarity Perfected Person, destined never to suffer the disaster of mourning in this lifetime. The spirits of the Great Yin guard them, the essence of myriad spirits pay homage, dispersing and mixing, transforming heaven and earth. These Nine Yin Consorts are the Emperor Lord’s Yin Palace spirits. Those who practice the Way and resolve knots, offering talismans to the upper registers, securing soul and mastering spirit, transforming body and spirit, guiding breath and extending essence to seek longevity—without knowing the consorts’ names and practicing the Nine Yins mixed transformation—will never become immortals.

Between the eyebrows, one inch inward lies the Bright Hall, a square one inch wide, where the Emperor Lord’s Nine Yin Consorts dwell constantly. Always on the moon’s even days, at dusk, during the time of vital energy, burn incense and enter a separate chamber, sitting or lying at ease, closing eyes for a long time. Preserve the Emperor Lord seated securely in the Supreme Ultimate Purple Chamber. Also preserve the Supreme One Five Spirits in the Six Harmonies. Also preserve the Northern Dipper Nine Stars in the heart. Also preserve the Nine Yin Consorts in the Bright Hall. Also preserve the Supreme Micro Youth Spirit of Gan Jing, standing opposite the Emperor Lord. The youth holds five talismans in the left hand, five registers in the right. Also preserve the shape of the destiny standing behind the youth. Also preserve the Nine Yin Consorts arrayed horizontally behind the destiny. Also preserve the Supreme One Five Spirits ascending from the Six Harmonies into the Supreme Ultimate Purple Chamber, arrayed horizontally behind the Nine Yin Consorts. When all is complete, the Emperor Lord’s myriad spirits suddenly unite in great transformation, becoming one person, like a newly born infant, named the Unchanging Youth, styled Transformation Jade. The youth holds the Nine Stars, wears the sun on the head, the moon in the mouth. The youth’s light of sun, moon, and nine stars shines and infuses the destiny’s whole body, inside and out, penetrating thoroughly, feeling the destiny’s body glowing red like fire, no longer wrapped, the wrapping all smoky and ethereal.

This is the Emperor Lord Supreme One’s Nine Yin, Nine Yin Mixed Transformation of Myriad Forms. After a long while, knock teeth twenty-four times with twenty-four resonances, swallow saliva nine times, then softly recite:

Grotto Heaven Spirit Light, returning radiance to Purple Clarity,  
Mysterious Yin Nine Mornings, hidden sinking into utter darkness,  
Lady of the Dipper, three daughters dispersing form,  
Spirit consorts transforming within, all things established,  
Lightning flashes and thunder roars, clouds and mist flowing,  
Ninety transformations, producing elixir and blue,  
Supreme One’s nine daughters, palace transforming and mixing,  
Unchanging youth sinking and flowing, dwelling in the nether darkness,  
Brocade robes and splendid garments, purple feathers and flying skirts,  
Left wearing hidden talisman, right bearing tiger pattern,  
Riding fire and wearing fire, holding crimson banner,  
Beside demons and eight winds, four pulling radiant clouds,  
Free and easy heavenly cord, transforming and sweeping the Seven Origins,  
Concealing mountains and rivers, overturning the Five Mornings,  
Sun and moon blocking radiance, constellations losing truth,  
Dividing form to create hundreds, transforming body into thousands,  
In fire becoming fire, in forest becoming forest,  
Dwelling in water becoming water, in mountain becoming mountain,  
What is sought suddenly arrives, what is summoned comes before,  
Swift as a startled fish, eyes instantly reach,  
Thousands of kinds and thousands of things, all as I say,  
The Emperor Lord in form, Supreme Jade Morning,  
No hero shares the radiance, four and White Origin,  
Water generates heaven and earth, preserving and nourishing my body,  
What the mouth utters, following the will to transform and shift,  
Jade youth bearing talisman, jade splendor holding scarf,  
Spirit consorts offering incense, four truths sharing the carriage,  
All matters and things, all as I say.

When the incantation ends, again preserve the planets Jupiter, Mars, Venus, the Celestial Pole Star, and the Guardian Star—together the five common stars—each coming from their direction, all entering the mouth, their light illuminating the cinnabar field purple chamber above, the five viscera within, and the yin chamber below, making the entire body’s form thoroughly clear. This is the Emperor Lord’s method of illumination, to return the Nine Yin Way. Preserve and contemplate for a long time, knock teeth five times with five resonances, swallow saliva five times, then softly recite:

Five Celestial Bodies arrayed horizontally, shining brightly in five directions,  
Mercury dispels disaster, Jupiter brings prosperity,  
Mars eliminates calamity, Venus wards off war,  
Guardian Star firmly stationed, I gain benefit and integrity,  
Emperor Lord uses transformation, harmonizing and returning the Nine Spirits,  
Great Yin pure brilliance, palace housing the Nine Stars,  
Record me on jade tablets, inscribe characters in the Emperor’s chamber,  
Riding the whirlwind, fanning radiance, flying through the great void,  
Entering and exiting the nether darkness, roaming the Ten Directions,  
Five clouds covering, summoning spirits and commanding winds,  
Commanding myriad spirits, guarding the immortals and lords.

When finished.

This is the Emperor Lord’s Nine Yin Hidden Scripture, the inner affairs of the Nine Truths. The ranks of the Five Spirits, the paths of the Three Primes. The Central Yellow Lord, the Southern Purple Essence Lord, the Eastern Blue Youth Lord, the Northern Most High Lord, the Western Great Origin Lord—all return the Nine Yin to scatter form, arrange the Five Stars to extinguish radiance, mix and transform all things, responding to events to establish all, enduring long and seeing far, becoming the Perfected Person above. If the destiny constantly practices this, transformation is boundless, the body born of water and fire. Thus ends the Emperor Lord’s Nine Yin Way.

### The Most High Jade Morning’s Radiant Ceremony: Running the Sun’s Red Radiance and the Moon’s Yellow Radiance Jade Charms

The Way of Running the Sun and Moon is the treasured secret of the Most High Supreme Clarity Supreme Ultimate Nine Emperors and Four Perfected Ones, the jade charm of the Mysterious Void Jade Lord. Those not of the Golden Pavilion Jade Name, nor recorded in the Eastern Splendor, may not hear or see these two chapters. Practitioners first purify and fast for one hundred days, severing ties with human affairs, then begin. Long practice brings the upper realm’s sun and moon to send fifty jade youths and jade maidens each.

The Most High Radiant Ceremony Red Script and Jade Charm Yellow Chapter are the Most High Jade Emperor Lord’s spiritual secret chapters, hidden in the palace of the Nine Heavens, on the altar of cinnabar jade. Only those diligent in truth, with the bones of flying mysterious heavenly immortals from past ages, may see or hear. Their titles must not be spoken lightly; to mention them is to offend the Three Officials, unforgiven by Heaven and Earth. Initially, once every three hundred years one person may transmit; after seven hundred years, transmission resumes. If the divine spirits report suitability, it is passed on. Transmission is always between master and disciple, to honor the profound mysteries. If passed to unworthy persons who do not follow the rules, it is a leak of heavenly secrets. Those who are negligent and violate oaths die as lower ghosts, suffering the Seven Ancestors’ punishment of wind and fire. Unless of the same spirit, better to keep silent.

In the Western Mysterious Mountain’s grotto platform, these two scriptures are carved on jade tablets, written in gold characters. Also at Wangwu’s Clear Void Heaven, they exist but are incomplete. Only the Supreme Mystery Palace’s high platform and the northern chamber of Penglai Mansion’s golden pillars and jade walls have complete carvings. The Central Palace immortals and Supreme Clarity palaces do not know what these scriptures are. In the northern grotto of Mount Emei, a stone chamber door pivot is carved with the words: “Radiant Ceremony draws sun essence, Jade Charm summons moon spirit; attaining the Way, one reaches the Supreme Palace, position as Emperor Lord True.” Only twenty characters. Immortals seeing this often do not understand its meaning. Many immortals have never seen these chapters. Its golden liquid divine elixir is but a minor technique, not for flying to Supreme Clarity. Those who wish to practice this Way need not be foolish or wise, but on earth there is no such text. True officials and mysterious methods are transmitted only after oath-taking. Those who obtain and practice this attain the rank of Supreme True, riding the eight radiance jade wheels, roaming the Nine Mornings, visiting the Great Origin Palace, seeing the Supreme One Emperor Lord, all paying homage to the Primal Morning. Hence the secret saying: “If you obtain the Radiant Ceremony and Jade Charm, you become a true Supreme Clarity; without cultivating the Supreme Way, you cannot see the Three Prime Lords.”

### The Most High Radiant Ceremony’s Noon Five Emperors’ Names, Titles, and Garments

Noon Blue Emperor, named Yuan Changwu, styled Zhao Longtao, wearing a blue jade brocade robe, azure feather flying skirt, crowned with the Jade Green Morning Support.

These are the noon five emperor lords’ names, titles, and garments. To practice the Way of Running the Sun, one must recite the incantation recognizing their names, preserve the emperor’s garments on one’s left, right, front, and back. The moon’s lady soul spirit internal god, named Ai Xiao Tai Biao, is paired with the five emperors of the moon, then also incanted. Those who know the moon soul’s name will be free from disaster and unharmed by myriad calamities. The Most High stores the names of the sun and moon emperors and ladies in the Great Origin Moon Palace; those who know them are divine and spirit communicators.

Moon Blue Emperor Lady, named E Yin Zhu, styled Fen Yan Ying, wearing a blue splendid jade brocade robe, emerald dragon and phoenix patterned flying feather skirt.

Moon Red Emperor Lady, named Yi Yi Liao, styled Wan Yan Xu, wearing a vermilion bud jade brocade robe, crimson phoenix falling flying feather skirt.

Moon White Emperor Lady, named Ling Su Lan, styled Yu Lianhua, wearing a white jade brocade robe with four dragons, white feather phoenix patterned flying floral skirt.

Moon Black Emperor Lady, named Jie Lianqiao, styled Ting Shu Jin, wearing a black Lang nine-path cloud brocade robe, black feather dragon patterned flying floral skirt.

Moon Yellow Emperor Lady, named Qing Ying Jin, styled Xuan Ding Rong, wearing a yellow cloud mountain patterned brocade robe, green feather phoenix embroidered skirt.

These five ladies all wear cloud-shaped triangular hair buns, with the remaining hair flowing to the waist.

These are the moon five emperor ladies’ names, titles, and garments. To practice the Way of Running the Moon, one must recite the incantation recognizing their names, preserve the ladies’ garments on one’s left, right, front, and back. The sun’s five emperor soul spirits internal gods, named Zhu Jing Chi Tong, are paired with the moon’s five ladies, then also incanted. Those who know the sun soul’s name will be free from illness and unharmed by myriad calamities. The Most High stores the sun and moon soul names in the Purple Void King Palace; those who know them are spirit communicators.

Those who preserve the Way of Running the Sun and Moon may practice as they wish, not necessarily completing all. To attain a quiet chamber of concealment, one must only see the first radiance of the sun and moon. If one does not sever human affairs or is entangled with external things, one cannot practice this Way.

At midnight, always burn incense, preserve the five ladies’ names, and mentally recite: “May I unite with the Emperor Lord Supreme One Five Spirits, merging radiance as one.” Practiced for twenty-four years, one may ascend to heaven in broad daylight, no longer needing to practice the Way of Running and Preserving. Always preserve them at one’s sides, and recite the old incantations, not allowing ears to hear.

### Practicing the Radiant Ceremony Way of Running the Sun

At dawn, observe the sun’s first rising. On days without sun, in the quiet chamber, close eyes and hold breath for ten breaths, then swallow the sun’s radiance ten times, preserving the rosy light, allowing it to enter the mouth and be swallowed. When finished, softly call the five emperor names and the moon soul names three times. Then preserve the Blue Emperor Lord, coming from the sun’s light to my left; then the Red Emperor Lord, coming from the sun’s light to my right; then the White Emperor Lord, coming from the sun’s light behind me; then the Black Emperor Lord, coming from the sun’s light above my left hand; then the Yellow Emperor Lord, coming from the sun’s light above my right hand. The five emperors all come, preserving their garments, enabling imitation. Then knock teeth five times with five resonances, swallow saliva nine times, softly recite:

Vermilion Furnace Elixir Radiance, perfect brilliance of nine lights,  
Great Radiance opens the dawn, shining forth vermilion essence,  
Five Emperors initiate the rosy clouds, illuminating the grotto and myriad beings,  
Observing the upper true, empty and undisturbed,  
Circulating breath and refining colors, flowing and wandering the five forms,  
Enabling my spirit to transform, six orifices fully open,  
Together with the Emperor Lord Supreme One without peer,  
Riding the crimson cloud chariot, ascending to the sun’s center,  
Uniting spirit with the Emperor, longevity equal to Heaven and Earth,  
Two luminaries inclining together.

When the incantation ends, knock teeth three times with three resonances, swallow saliva three times, then softly recite:

Moon soul spirit, Ai Xiao Tai Biao,  
Enable me to reach the sun’s cavern heaven,  
Eastern dark long hill, receiving the chapter of waving spirit,  
Bearing the talisman of the nine existences,  
Eating the green essence of the sun, drinking the azure nectar of clouds,  
Feasting in the city of the Eight Extremes, ascending the platform of true brightness,  
Sitting in the hall of rare forest, chanting the jade morning words.

When finished, preserve the red cloud chariot, riding the nine red dragons, coming from the sun’s light before me, riding together with the five emperors to run the sun. Forget form for a long time, then swallow saliva fourteen times. When finished, open eyes and focus, preserving the thought of having an imitation. Those who can practice long will surely ride the radiance to run the sun. Thus ends the Radiant Ceremony Way.

### Practicing the Jade Charm Way of Running the Moon

At dusk, observe the moon and face it. On moonless nights, in the quiet chamber, close eyes and hold breath nine breaths, then swallow the moon’s radiance nine times, preserving the moonlight, allowing it to enter the mouth and be swallowed. Then recite the five broad ladies’ names, and the sun soul names three times. Then preserve the Moon Blue Emperor Lady, coming from the moonlight, descending, left and right in turn, as with the five emperors of the sun. All come, preserving their garments, enabling imitation. Then knock teeth nine times with nine resonances, swallow saliva nine times, softly recite:

Yellow essence opens radiance, primal yin inner chapter,  
Reflecting and observing the Great Mystery, opening the grotto and myriad directions,  
Scattering the cold and fierce winds, seven mornings hanging bright,  
Returning yin to the three harmonies, heaven and earth emitting light,  
Purple radiance roaming and falling, floating splendor in nine skies,  
Perfect brightness assigning colors, six energies transforming and communicating,  
Five emperor ladies treading clouds and grasping winds,  
Spirit robes and dense gauze, wearing jade belts and pendants,  
Feather skirts brushing the sky, wandering spirits fanning east,  
Raising trees and spreading canopies, jade branches flourishing,  
Cloud frog refining and rubbing, nurturing the wood king,  
Roots of the grotto ten thousand li, shading and sheltering my body,  
Soul harmonized and spirit transformed, six mysterious spirits filling,  
Returning to the infant, jade reflecting the reverse youth,  
Emperor Lord united in transformation, merging radiance with peach and health,  
Riding the flowing bells, flying clouds and ten dragons,  
Ascending to the bright palace, position as protector of the emperor,  
Longevity merging the two luminaries, heaven and earth infinite.

When finished, knock teeth seven times with seven resonances, swallow saliva seven times, then softly recite:

Sun soul spirit, Zhu Jing Chi Tong,  
Enable me to reach the western gate of the six realms,  
Enter the harmonious morning jade palace,  
Eight strings on the white hill, eight radiance upper chamber,  
Receiving the talisman of ten lights, wearing the chapter of flowing stars and night light,  
Sitting in the hall of Great Harmony, ascending the platform of seven spirits,  
Drinking the moonlight ointment, eating the yellow jade purple nectar,  
Chanting the supreme chapter, reciting the jade morning true words.

When finished, preserve the flowing bells and flying cloud chariot, riding ten yellow dragons, coming from the moonlight before me, riding together with the five ladies to run the moon. Forget form for a long time, then swallow saliva thirty times. When finished, open eyes and focus, preserving the thought of having an imitation. Those who can practice long will surely ride the radiance to run the moon. Thus ends the Jade Charm Way.

If one has already become an immortal or Daoist, fully refining essence and thought, preserving for two years will bring imitation; three years, form appears; five years practicing, one attains running the sun and moon. Those not yet immortals who begin to refine essence and thought are thus not hastened. Those who can persist long ascend to the two radiances and become Supreme Clarity Perfected Persons. Once every seven hundred years passed to one person.
