### The Secret Writ of the Supreme Hidden

The Lofty Three Sovereigns, Most True, Mysterious Cavern, Supreme Cavern Dao Lord declared: The Golden Tiger Phoenix Writings True Talismans are issued by the Most True Parents of the Nine Heavens. The Most True Elder received them from the Three Sovereign Lords, transmitted through countless kalpas to the Eastern Sea’s Little Child. The Nine Heavens Kings passed them to the Most High Great Dao Lord, who ever treasures and guards them secretly, storing them within the Jade Chamber of the Spirit Capital of Supreme Subtlety, protected by colossal heavenly beasts, defended by venomous dragons and golden tigers, guided by seven thousand souls, all prepared within the Jade Palace. Golden Morning Jade Boys and Pure Spirit Jade Maidens, three hundred each, attend and guard the numinous script. The mysterious radiance fills the empty sky, scattering mist through the Purple Court, their awe shaking the realms of the Nine Directions. The August Heaven’s great divinity shines forth in Supreme Clarity, wondrously opening to the natural, penetrating wisdom in the formless.

The Divine Tiger leads its troop, the Golden Tiger guards its truth, wisdom marks its staff, demons vanish at its source. Subtle meanings profound and deep, marvelously difficult to detail, all bear the hidden names of heavenly demons, also marking the inner names of a hundred spirits. Reciting its chapters stirs a thousand spirits in fright; chanting its verses binds ten thousand demons’ forms. It establishes governance at the beginning of the Three Heavens, entrusting the Most Subtle Heavenly Emperor to wield authority over the Six Heavens, severing myriad spirits, commanding mountains and valleys, summoning sea gods, binding the myriad essences.

The host of spirits casts talismans, their great might shaking demons, evil destroyed in form. The true gods of the underworld turn the threads of the Five Stars. Thus the Most Subtle Emperor receives the Golden Tiger Phoenix Writings of demon-dispelling wisdom, wears the talisman and roams freely, playing in Supreme Clarity, soaring beyond the void, floating on the mysterious celestial wheel. The Most Subtle clears the scene in the high pavilion; the Most True halts at the steps and courtyard, harmonizing with Heaven and Earth’s accord, shining with sevenfold radiance and great brightness. They move evenly through the Three Sovereigns, shining sevenfold upon the Nine Netherworlds, grasping cloud tokens at cliffs and ridges, illuminating jade chapters with spiritual insight, encompassing myriad degrees with profound understanding, summoning divine truths and calling the hundred yang.

At once lightning flashes through myriad poisons, sweeping away countless evils, causing all demons to perish, their might shaking the distant courts. Golden Morning unveils the dao, opening without hindrance, gazing upward into the Golden Palace within. The eight scenes respond to commands and return; the Spirit Officials ride the Golden Tiger, carrying me through the absolute void in flight. The host of dragons opens the immortal path, ascending afar to pay homage to the Most Subtle. The Three Terraces serve as guides, the Seven Stars speed in pursuit, flying clear and swift to divine constructions, dense with heavenly secrets. They penetrate the Nine Mysterious Gates, roam to the utmost ends of the heavens, rest in jade chambers and pavilions, coming and going without decline. Subtle indeed is the Heavenly True Talisman, the august spirit bearing its wondrous name.

### The Earthly Sovereign’s Preface to the Phoenix Writings

The Earthly Sovereign bestowed the Golden Tiger Phoenix Writings talisman and chapters upon the Most Subtle Heavenly Emperor. The Most Subtle Heavenly Emperor informed the Supreme Holy Azure Youth Lord. Then the Western City King Lord declared: “The Supreme Clarity Great Wisdom Demon-Dispelling True Scripture.” This is the Phoenix Writings of the Three Sovereigns, the inner text of the Supreme Ultimate, the hidden names of myriad spirits, the jade chapters of the Lofty, the treasured formula of the Supreme Sovereign, the precious chapters of the Golden Tiger.

Wisdom can chase away filth and destroy demons, greatly exorcising and controlling poisons, also discerning evil; no demon can withstand its form. Wearing it unites form and flight, scattering radiance in myriad directions, roaming the sea crossings, immune to all harm. Sitting or standing, life or death, it communicates with the mysterious; once established, all wishes are fulfilled. Now, by the power of divine spirits, diligently cultivate oneself. This true scripture is lofty and subtle; one must recite its myriad passages, exhorting later worthy ones to receive the true fellowship. One must follow the Most True’s regulations; if not in accord, do not lightly open its container. In a world without faithful and obedient people, seven hundred years later they will follow one another, again emerging at the end of the Ma lineage, virtuous and upright in the Song region, their might supporting the Three Transmissions, thus ascending to the Supreme Ultimate Lord. Without the bearing of dragon and phoenix, how could the precious worthy be joined?

### The Human Sovereign’s Phoenix Writings

When the Phoenix Writings descended from afar, the Golden Tiger shone with divine truth. It bestowed primordial功, not descending to defiled and turbid men. It covers and supports the Three Caverns Masters, ascending beyond the high mysterious guests. Passing to the Queen Mother’s gate, roaming the heavenly river crossings. First bowing to the Supreme Ultimate Emperor, enduring thirty kalpas. Repeatedly receiving heavenly truth descent, jade maidens number in the thousands. Golden boys descend on the left, jade maidens attend on the right. Bestowed with the nine-bend token, jade and one are fresh alike. The Heavenly Officials follow its descent, the Five Mountains guide its front. Heavenly beings beat bamboo drums and jade bells, flutes and songs guard its midst. Mountains and seas become calm waves, the pure path without dust or shadow. Descending, it plays in the Four Rivers; the Five Mountains also briefly spin. Ten thousand demons all submit and hide; evil spirits and monsters all perish in body. Flying radiance in the Scarlet Palace, lushly following the host of immortals. Intent focused on heavenly descent, the white sun rises in august Heaven. Why not diligently penetrate it, broadly survey the bright master’s crossing? The Heavenly Sovereign’s dao is lofty and subtle, communicating above and penetrating the sacred true. The Earthly Sovereign follows in clarity, virtue aligned with imperial mandate. The Human Sovereign also sanctifies transformation, virtue equal to Heaven’s turning wheel.

Teachers receiving disciples must all strictly purify for ninety days, or thirty days, or a minor fast of seven days. All must offer seven taels of superior gold, as proof of the Golden Tiger Phoenix Writings’ trust. A brocade of cinnabar earth ninety feet long, sworn by the Nine Heavens. Blue silk forty feet long, pledging allegiance to the writings. Loving the dao and harmonizing with truth, diligently focusing on the mysterious, sparing no wealth or goods, valuing one’s person and cherishing trust, there should be no failure to descend, nor any lacking of renewal. Receiving it one must diligently seek, not to exceed before time, devoted through the night without sleep, striving to advance before distinguished persons. Why be lazy or neglectful? Sit upright receiving the seat’s fault; embody the method and accord with the dao; if not embodying, do not speak falsely. Inside and outside both floating well, how can one mingle freely? Beware that wealth is a burden, destroying reputation and losing one’s person. Even the slightest is already known by Heaven; do not say small things do not entangle. I wish you to avoid worldly snares, gradually leave behind sheltering famous mountains. Mountain marshes are silent without joy, able to preserve myriad spirits. Always scatter wealth and treasures to redeem past life faults, bridging generations, aiding and ferrying distant souls. Reduce excess and supplement deficiency, merit spreading to all directions. When disasters come, it must be by the dao; the dao descends wings to cover. Grace bestowed, one should welcome and act; do not wait for calamity’s clash. When calamity strikes, blame is already tied; not to be reckoned again. If reckoned, strength will not arrive. Think of you sitting guarding poverty.

Wear the Golden Tiger Phoenix Writings supreme talisman, inscribed in cinnabar; it may also be inscribed in blue as earth.

The August Dao says: Daoists learning the immortal true dao, establish功德 in the human world. After the years pass, they should enter the Five Mountains and various peaks. Scholars suffer hardship, not yet refining hidden retreat, hoping for the magical herb, directly reaching the mountains. The road is long and distant, suddenly encountering three calamities and five hardships, ultimately unable to apply methods and techniques, their bodies among evil thieves and ghosts. All should make mighty divine prayers. They repeatedly face evil places, sounding the heavenly drum thirty-six times, fully embodying the inner spirit, then praying:

May the Nine Heavens’ mysterious sound descend the tokens of myriad harmonies, commanding the four directions, opening the divine myriad splendors, surpassing the stagnant heavenly traces, combining three and five, returning pure verdant radiance, chanting the mandate swiftly, pledging the cinnabar oath, dispelling and removing sickness, containing light shining high, flowing radiance filling homes, the master strategist guiding, mighty severing heavenly demons, gathering and recording extinct breeds, destroying forms in the nine nets, tiger talisman divine might, awe restraining myriad evils, slashing and killing without mercy, subtle and fine all perish, demons vanish in the nine yin, disasters destroyed like flowing sand, myriad poisons all subdued, hundred hardships all passed. Let功 be spoken and rewards moved, not failing the great harmony.

### The Lofty Sovereign’s Phoenix Writings

Lofty and resplendent Five-Spike Ridge, solitary peak shining with supreme brilliance. Learners not strict or pure, officials and soldiers also disobedient. I uphold the correct dao path, what evil dares to add? Wearing the golden divine talisman, flowing bells follow the body in flight. The Three Heavens’ talismans and Five Mountains all guide me forward and back. The heavenly net is already stretched and maintained; the earthly web also laid with devices. Ghosts, demons, and venomous beasts, see me and immediately perish and collapse. Thieves and robbers dare not advance; the golden phoenix devours your decline. A thousand spirits lose their sight; ten thousand demons flee like thunder. How can thieves and robbers be allowed? The Three Officials should strictly push them. Quickly run, make them scatter and flee; tiger soldiers should painfully strike. Hurry, hurry, accept the command, strictly proclaim the great august might. Those with功 should be promoted and rewarded; those without功 pursued by myriad devices. Hurry, hurry, like the clear heavenly prayer’s decree.

There is also a great demon-dispelling talisman, found in the *Demon-Dispelling Heavenly Water Scripture*, which may be applied beforehand to repel evil, then the divine incantation and command proceed.

This is the hidden sound of the myriad demon kings of the Nine Heavens, also to be worn and prayed over to control demons. Without prayer and control, one should first wear a talisman, further commanding the inner spirits to respond accordingly.

On the seventh day of the seventh month, in the year of the Wood Ox of the third year of Xingning, the Perfected One Tongbai, inheriting from Master Lezi and Master Anqi, received and revealed the Golden Tiger Phoenix Writings talisman from the Three Sovereigns’ treasury, ordering the late-learning Daoist Xu Yuanyou to receive it, to control myriad demons. The divine prayers will be effective in the years of the Fire Goat, Wood Monkey, Fire Pig, Water Dragon, and Water Snake; on the first day of the ninth month, the seventh day of the seventh month, and the eighth day of the fourth month. On these three days, there shall be worthy Daoists wearing seven-colored ritual robes, holding a staff, standing on the spirit altar, or begging in the human world, chanting scriptures and reciting books, or making wild songs. If you see such a person, diligently inquire about their dao affairs; they will surely grant you the supreme Golden Tiger talisman and all essential teachings. Do not treat lightly; this is a hidden perfected person. The Perfected One of the Southern Peak follows the Most High Limitless Great Dao Lord and Heavenly Emperor Lord, often descending to the human world, observing the late-learning Daoists’ diligent hearts in the final age.
