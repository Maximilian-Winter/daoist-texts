### Scripture of the Two Flying Visions from the Primordial Truth Cavern in the Hidden Writings of Supreme Clarity and Great Expanse

To walk the path of the Six Assemblies’ shifting degrees, one must cultivate the Five Mornings of separation from the Gate of Death, crossing through the Palace of Life by the highest method of flying immortals. One must observe the days of Ren-Shen, Bing-Shen, Wu-Shen, Jia-Shen, and Geng-Shen—the five days of separation. At these times, the High Emperor customarily rides the chariot of the Radiant Dragon, draped in green mist, accompanied by the Jade Maidens of the Immortal Officials, circling the Ten Heavens. Descending to the human realm, he surveys those who study the dao of immortality, commanding the Northern Emperor, the Great Lord of the Five Breathings of the Taiyin, to carry the Death Register upwards to the Palace of Calculations in the Capital of Peace, to examine and verify the records of life and death.

The True Sovereign Lords of the Five Directions and Five Stars each unify their respective realms, commanding the immortals who are destined to attain the dao. This is known as Donghua. There are Yin crimes and Yin faults, Yang crimes and Yang faults, all bound under the Northern Emperor. The Taiyin Lord calls this the Palace of Fengdu, which separates good and evil, life and death. Therefore, on the days of the Five Separations, the chief guilt lies with Taiyin, cultivation of life with the Sun, death registration with the Northern Emperor, and seeking immortality with the Five Stars.

Whenever these days arrive, one must prepare with fasting and proper attire, burn incense within the chamber, repent past faults and contemplate virtue, preserve the spirit inwardly, focus the mind single-heartedly on the mysterious, without distraction. The Emperor Sovereign tours the Five Realms; the spirit officials record one’s merit, reporting it to the Jade Emperor Sovereign. If this is done for five years, one may receive the True Sovereign of the Five Stars descending into the chamber.

On this day, at dawn, noon, and midnight, enter the chamber to burn incense, face north to bow twice, knock the teeth thrice, and recite the incantation:

> Most High Jade Emperor Sovereign, I beseech you to pardon all the Yin evils and Yang faults committed since my seventh ancestor, extending down to my own person—acts of killing, licentiousness, and countless offenses numbering in the thousands and myriad eras. These Yang crimes and Yin faults are recorded under the Northern Emperor. I humbly request their removal, reduction of my guilt, severance of the root of death, passage through the Heavenly Gate, and admission into Donghua. Let the words be inscribed on the Jade Tablets; may my seven ancestors be reborn as Southern Immortals.

Having completed this, one then contemplates the True Sovereign Lord of the Northern Star, the Primordial Spirit, clad in a purple brocade flying skirt, belt adorned with a tiger talisman, head crowned with a splendid floral diadem, riding a jade chariot veiled in embroidered mist and clouds. Accompanied by the Twelve Immortal Officials, descending from the North, he covers my body. His radiance is dense and flourishing, shining with brilliant essence. Raising my voice, I chant:

> Northern True Sovereign, commander of flying immortals, riding the clouded chariot, come crown my body. I beg you to seal the ghost gate, sever the root of death, named Yuqing, to open and liberate the Heavenly Gate. May I depart from the Northern Emperor, ascend to the Southern Pavilion, live in harmony with the True Sovereign, and share protection with the Northern Star.

Then one holds the breath five times and stops. Facing east, bow twice, knock the teeth thrice, and recite the incantation:

> Jade Morning Most High Lord, Great Ultimate Primordial Radiance Lord, I beseech you to pardon all Yin crimes and Yang faults committed since the first year of my life, extending to the seven ancestral hosts and their grave offenses. Bound within the Three Yin, I humbly request release, obliteration of guilt, sealing of the root of death. May the Northern Emperor remove my ancestral bonds, Donghua record my name on the Jade Tablets, that my seven mysterious ancestors ascend with the Emperor of Morning.

Having completed this, one next contemplates the True Sovereign Lord of the Eastern Year Star, the Blue Fang, clad in a cloud brocade dragon robe skirt, belt bearing a phoenix talisman, head crowned with a splendid floral diadem, riding a jade chariot veiled in blue mist and clouds. Accompanied by the Twelve Immortal Officials, descending from the East, he covers my body. His radiance is lush and vibrant, brilliantly illuminating the East. Raising my voice, I chant:

> Eastern Middle True Sovereign, flowing mist of the Nine Gates, your light shines beyond the borders, cover and crown my body. I beg you to grant me favor, report to the Northern Emperor, sever my root of death, pass me the Jade Name, the Inner Truth of Donghua. May I ascend and cross over, forever leaving the path of death. May my seven mysterious ancestors all enjoy blessings and fortune, live with the moon, set with the sun, ride the void, float on air, and ascend the flying steps.

Then one holds the breath nine times and stops. Facing south, bow twice, knock the teeth thrice, and recite the incantation:

> Supreme Lords of the Three Origins of Supreme Clarity, Highest Lord of the Southern Pole, Jade Worthy of the Nine Breathings of the Sun, I beseech you to pardon all primordial evils and unfilial acts committed since my awareness, all acts of rebellion and lawlessness, licentiousness and theft, Yin crimes and Yang faults, extending to the seven ancestral hosts and their bonds, accumulated on white tablets, eyes fixed on Taiyin, guilt bound to the Northern Star. I humbly request release, obliteration of the Three Officials’ ancestral eyes, sealing the root of death’s breath, passage through the Northeast Gate, ascending the Southwest Gate. May my seven mysterious ancestors all receive imperial grace.

Having completed this, one next contemplates the True Sovereign Lord of the Southern Fire Star, Wei Chun, clad in a snow-frost phoenix and dragon bell skirt, belt bearing a tiger script, head crowned with a flying blue diadem, riding a vermilion mist and crimson chariot. Accompanied by the Twelve Immortal Officials, descending from the South, he covers my body. His radiance shines brilliantly like the rising sun. Raising my voice, I chant:

> Southern True Sovereign, mysterious image flowing light, wandering the Three Gates, riding the vermilion chariot, ascending to the Highest Origin, your brightness shines within. Crown my body, remove and sever the Northern Emperor’s guilt, untie bonds and disperse stagnation, extinguish Taiyin, let my body leave the ghost gate, cut off the root of ancestral bonds, open the Heavenly Gate, ascend to the Southern Pavilion. May my seven ancestors join me in paying homage before the Emperor.

Then one holds the breath eight times and stops. Facing west, bow twice, knock the teeth thrice, and recite the incantation:

> Great Primordial Lords of the Three Origins, Lords of the Four Elders and the Dao, I beseech you to pardon all offenses committed since my awareness, all acts of negligence and carelessness, lightly leaking scriptures, treading on filth and dust, defiling the Three Lights. With incantations and oaths, tears and sorrow, I touch the Emperor Sovereign. Ancestral bonds are fixed in Taiyin, guilt sworn to the ghost officials. I humbly request release, obliteration of the root of examination, severance and sealing of the road of death, passage through the Gate of Life. May my seven ancestors ascend to the Hall of Blessings.

Having completed this, one next contemplates the True Sovereign Lord of the Western Great White Star, Bai Xing, clad in a bright brocade flowing bell skirt, belt bearing a tiger emblem, head crowned with the Morning Support diadem, riding a white mist flying chariot. Accompanied by the Twelve Immortal Officials, descending from the West, he covers my body. His light penetrates thoroughly, brilliantly illuminating the West. Raising my voice, I chant:

> Western True Sovereign, pure shining mysterious standard, riding the jade chariot, your pure brilliance fills the skies. Return at dawn to descend, true form revealed. For me, turn the nine gates, pass me through the imperial court, let my body leave Taiyin’s records, ascend to the Mysterious Palace to join the Jade Chamber, live long as heaven and earth, unwithering for myriad years. May my seven mysterious ancestors all ascend the morning sky.

Having completed this, one holds the breath six times and stops. Next, facing the center, bow twice, knock the teeth thrice, and recite the incantation:

> Most High Great Emperor Jade Sovereign, I beseech you to pardon all the countless offenses and innumerable faults committed since my birth until this day, the seven ancestral hosts bound and stained without release, matters tied to Taiyin. I humbly request release, obliteration, dispersion, destruction of the Northern Emperor’s mysterious name, severance of the root of death’s breath in the ghost gate of the Gui Earth, passage through the Heavenly Gate, crossing the Five Mornings. May my seven ancestors all receive renewed immortality.

Then one contemplates the True Sovereign Lord of the Central Stationary Star, Tan Yan, clad in a yellow cloud dragon brocade tiger skirt, belt bearing a golden talisman, head crowned with a purple diadem, riding a yellow mist flying chariot. Accompanied by the Twelve Immortal Officials, descending from the center, he crowns and covers my body. His light penetrates thoroughly, brilliantly illuminating the Middle Origin. Raising my voice, I chant:

> Central True Sovereign, commander of the Five Emperors, operating the mysterious thread, riding the yellow mist, circling the Four Directions, sever the root of death for me, pass me through the Palace of Southern Yang, separate the five and return to six, soar with me, transform myriad crossings, enjoy boundless eternity, ascend the Great Ultimate, the Golden Gate and Jade Hall. May my seven ancestors share in prosperity and flourishing.

Having completed this, one holds the breath twelve times and stops.

The Five Separations first pass through the Five Emperors, preserving the Five Mornings to cross life; the matter is finished here. If one always arrives on these days and practices without neglect, after seven years one will be touched by the True Stars of the Five Mornings, seeing their forms in the child’s sleeping chamber. The Great Emperor dispatches five Jade Maidens from the Five Directions to guard the child’s body. The Northern Emperor Taiyin also comes to the child’s gate, not daring to bind the child’s guilt. Those who study immortality and seek the truth should diligently practice. Repentance and seeking the path of life—this is the method requested by the Supreme Minister Qing Tong from the Golden Gate Emperor Sovereign, made as a model for later students seeking life. It is not the Great Emperor’s own repentance.

If one carries out these matters, the Emperor Sovereign also examines the heart. If ancestral faults remain unresolved, the officials of the Six Heavens will not remove the child’s death name, nor will the Gatekeepers of the Opening and Closing pass the child’s body. Therefore, there is the Mansion of Separation and Union, the Gate of Opening and Closing. The Gate of Opening and Closing is the Palace of Crossing Life; the Mansion of Separation and Union is the source of filling death. Only by earnest refinement can one obtain the true reality.

Those who cultivate life yet do not know that Heaven has gates of opening and closing, and Earth has Fengdu, the opening and closing govern spirits, Fengdu commands ghosts—these are the two Emperors, overseeing the cycle of life and death, linked by the pivot of the Seven Stars. Thus, the Seven Stars move to cross over. The Northern Emperor has no name for the Six Palaces; the Gatekeepers keep the record of immortals, the mysterious techniques are veiled by the splendid canopy, the Seven Origins grant release and liberation. The path of departure from immortality lies close at hand.

The Highest Lord of the Southern Pole says: When a person has resolve, the Seven Stars and Nine Sovereigns mysteriously illuminate their heart. Through earnest seeking and bitter contemplation, one naturally attains this cultivation after seven years, ascending in broad daylight. If one only reveres this scripture but does not cultivate mindfulness and burn incense properly, the essence of the Seven Stars still mysteriously illuminates their chamber, and the officials of Fengdu dare not approach their body.
