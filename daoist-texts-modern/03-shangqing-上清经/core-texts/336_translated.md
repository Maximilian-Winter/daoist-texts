Life arises from the embryo within the womb, transforming itself; it draws upon blood and essence to form itself. Thus, once born, the embryo’s knots further bind; once complete, the blood and fluids do not remain. Those that do not remain—when the Emperor Sovereign blends them—are then held fast. The embryo has twelve knots, firmly anchored in the five internal organs. When the five organs become obstructed and stagnant, the knots cannot be untied, the joints cannot be loosened—thus arise human ailments, born of knotting and stagnation; human death, born of solidified knots. On one’s natal day, or on the eight seasonal nodes, one petitions the Emperor Sovereign to blend with the Great One, to command the hundred spirits, and to untie the stubborn knots within the embryo—the death knots rooted in the foundation. The embryo holds twelve knots; within these knots lie twelve joints. The joints dwell inside the knots. Those who do not know how to untie the embryo’s knots and joints cannot escape death. Those who constantly untie them attain longevity.

**Upper Embryo Knots:** One resides in the Mud Pellet, one in the mouth, one in the cheek, one in the eye—these four knots of the embryo dwell in the upper region.

**Middle Embryo Knots:** One resides in the five viscera, one in the great granary, one in the large intestine, one in the small intestine—these four knots of the embryo dwell in the middle region.

**Lower Embryo Knots:** One resides in the bladder, one in the yin, one in the back gate, one in the two feet—these four knots of the embryo dwell in the lower region.

**Method to Untie the Knots:** Enter a chamber, close the door, and preserve your thought. First, recite the names of the Emperor Sovereign and the hundred spirits below. When finished, proceed to untie the knots in order. This method is the Dao of the Emperor Sovereign Great One blending with the twenty-four spirits, to untie knots and dispel the corpse qi. On one’s natal day, or the eight seasonal nodes, at any hour from midday to midnight, sit upright facing the direction of your birth sign. Join palms and center your heart. Tap your teeth twenty-four times and say:

“A male born under [Name and Heavenly Stem], I hereby open to the embryo father and mother, the day of first birth, the three accumulations of retained blood, transformed into twelve great knots. Today, on my natal day, I respectfully invite the spirits of the Three Nines and the twenty-four perfected beings to untie the three passes and twelve knots.”

The summons is as follows:

The Nine Lords of the Lower Embryo, true within the embryo, generate and transform the nine qi—these are the nine souls. The nine souls’ essence knots within the embryo’s joints, making the Heavenly Stem’s life short, causing midlife collapse and decline. Today, on this natal day, as at first birth, I beg for their dissolution: the twelve death roots, recorded in the Supreme Jade Register; the five talismans enter the body; the nine qi below are pacified; forever entwined above, opening the Nine Palaces; below, opening the Nine Passes.

After the ritual reading is completed twice, harmonize the breath below the heart, ensuring the voice does not falter or become obstructed. Then close the eyes and call upon the Heavenly Venerable of the Great Ultimate Purple Chamber, the Heavenly Emperor Sovereign Feng Lingfan, styled Lichangling, also named Seven Spirits, also called Divine Elder. Recite thus the invocation, thrice preserving the Three Nine Knots to be untied by the True Sovereign. The Eastern Azure Emperor Diao Liangji and others descend to the Mysterious Mother Shuo Huo Wang and twenty-seven others, all clad in vermilion robes and yellow kerchiefs. The yellow kerchiefs resemble the hats worn by distant travelers. Their faces are like infants, some tall, some short. If one cannot grasp even a little of this, one may enter a chamber and perform according to the text.

Afterward, arrange the mountain hues, cloud qi, and figures, coloring as appropriate.

Next, summon the Great Ultimate Purple Chamber and face north toward the Great Emperor Sovereign, all kneeling long. They say:

“The Upper Pass: Diao Liangji and eight others;  
The Middle Pass: Great One Wuyou Shou and eight others;  
The Lower Pass: Next the Yellow Court Shiming Jing and eight others.  

The Three Nines, twenty-seven in total, correspond to the qi within the throat. Open the three passes; each pass has twenty-four knots; each knot has twenty-four sinews. When sinews are severed, knots are untied; fluids and blood surge upward, filling the Mud Pellet; jade fluid flows downward, nourishing the hundred spirits. Today, [Name and Heavenly Stem] is inscribed in the Emperor’s Register, a long-living immortal.”

When finished, again preserve the Great One’s summons. Ascend before the Emperor Sovereign. The Emperor Sovereign says:  
“The embryo knots are now opened, light penetrates inside and out, granting you longevity, your fate unshaken. You may now merge with my form.”

The Emperor Sovereign then opens his mouth, and I suddenly find myself entering his mouth, directly arriving in the Emperor Sovereign’s Palace of the Six Harmonies. Within this palace dwells the Most High Spirit named Heavy Dark Void, styled Silent and Boundless. He tells me:  
“You may now consume the essence of the sun.”

I immediately take the sun’s essence and consume it, swallowing nine times and stopping. Soon, I see the twenty-seven perfected beings standing all around me. They say:  
“[Name and Heavenly Stem], your embryonic register is now resolved; all turbid qi is removed; your face now shines like jade; your body is hollowed like the great void; you will live for eons, the Emperor Sovereign accords with your talisman.”

Again, the Emperor Sovereign’s blessing is preserved:

“Heaven above is true, this is your body;  
Heaven above is spirit, this is your form.”

After a long while, all is complete. This is the blending of the Nine Lords, the inner transformation of the hundred spirits, the untying of the embryo’s knots, opening the beneficial Three Passes, aligning with the Six Harmonies, and harmonizing with the Emperor Sovereign’s transformations and life register. Qi settles in the Mud Pellet; longevity is granted by talismanic power—thus one becomes a celestial immortal. When the meditation is complete, one lets the hair down, combs it, loosens the clothes, rebinds the garments, and washes the hands and feet.

Within the Emperor Sovereign’s Mud Pellet is also the Palace of the Six Harmonies. Within this palace is the Emperor Sovereign Great One, named Heavy Dark Void, styled Silent and Boundless. Those who know this shall have decayed bones renewed, the five viscera blossoming with splendor, and shall fear no terror throughout their lives. In times of fear, face north and call this name thrice, reciting the blessing:

“Loa Heavy Dark Void, Thunder Wind Silent and Boundless,  
Born above in the Emperor Sovereign’s form,  
Protect [Name] so that no worries come.”

When finished, one is as if among a thousand companions.

The Great One says:  
“Humans have three souls, which benefit one’s survival; humans have seven spirits, which harm one’s life. The seven spirits rise at dawn beneath the left eye, and at dusk beneath the nose and philtrum. Those who study the dao and wish to rest should first use the right hand’s claw to press beneath the left eye and the philtrum, each three times seven passes—this is the method to regulate the seven spirits.”

The Emperor Sovereign says:  
“The Great One’s Precious Mysterious Jade Scripture is hidden by the Most High Perfected within the Five Sacred Mountains’ Flower Chamber. Without an immortal register, none may hear or see it. Those who see it live; those who practice it become immortals. Therefore, it is solemnly sworn and bound by heavenly truth to prevent its disclosure, circulation, or deviation. From the Heavenly Venerable to the noble immortals, this dao is secret and profound; it is not granted to those without immortal bones, nor heard by those without utmost sincerity. Thus the scripture says: ‘The disciple who receives it must show reverence.’ The transmission of the scripture is from master to disciple; receiving the scripture is to practice the disciple’s dao. At the time of transmission, each must fast seven days, or ten days; before and after, also called fasting, each for eight days. In ancient times, oaths were sworn by blood and hair-cutting, establishing an altar and announcing to Heaven, as a pact not to reveal or betray trust. Today, one may substitute golden and blue silk threads for hair and skin, arranged in a separate sanctuary, invoking the Supreme Emperor. The ritual uses three golden rings, bright red and shining; nine feet of blue silk, substituting for the three contracts’ oath, which may be linked to twenty-seven feet. The scripture is written in duplicate, one for practice, one for record. The oath items are fully recorded and may not be privately used for personal gain. Therefore, the Middle Scripture of the Most High says:  
‘The master relies on the scripture’s work, thus it is called the living receiver. One practices to unify sincerity, invoking the heavenly oath, firmly declaring to spirits, entwining joy and sorrow, equating life and death. Only then does the proof begin and end, all aspiring to the immortal court.’  

Then one bows and consults to receive, performing the oath in the ritual chamber, distinguishing ranks to clarify the three contracts, discerning the diligent heart, treasuring the scripture’s secret, implementing its key words, preserving sincerity and focus, revering the master and scripture, never daring to neglect. Only thus may one speak of communion with spirits and the dao’s virtue. One reveres the scripture and keeps its way secret; one acts according to the oath. Then the Supreme records the name on the jade slips, inscribes the imperial register in the Great Ultimate. If one violates the dao, the seven ancestors receive the test of the Wind Blade; the Mysterious Mother suffers the harm of the Embryo Fragment; the body becomes a lowly ghost; the gate is sealed; one is cast into the Mountain of Obscurity’s stones and thrown into the River of Accumulated Night. Alas! Those with heart, be cautious to keep this secret.’  

This is the Most High Perfected’s covenant, revealed by Master Zhang in the *Elixir Vision Scripture*, a book of careful oaths. To receive the dao of the Most High Emperor Sovereign and act accordingly, this is recorded and implemented.

The three golden rings are the oath of the Three Primes. The blue silk twenty-seven feet is the oath of the Emperor Sovereign’s twenty-four spirits. The five taels of red silk is the oath of the Five Divine Sons. Two bundles of blended incense are the cause for spiritual communication. One brush, one hundred sheets of paper, one tael of cinnabar are for writing the oath.

These five items are kept in vessels and not revealed; all are prepared by the disciple receiving the scripture. After writing, the disciple brings the scripture and oath to the master’s chamber to receive the scripture. Only after receiving may one use it. Those who secretly use it without oath lose the two lights according to the Female Azure Edict. Those who receive but do not practice suffer heavenly calamities. Those who practice but reveal it suffer the test of the Wind Blade. Those who transmit it to unworthy persons bring the test upon their seven generations of ancestors. This is the essence of the Mysterious Capital Ghost Law Female Azure Edict.
