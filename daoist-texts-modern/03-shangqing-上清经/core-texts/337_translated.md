### Scripture of the Three Celestial Charts of the Supreme Clarity Heavenly Gate

**Secret Instructions of the Great Firmament**

In all who cultivate the dao of the Seven Stars’ Shifting Degrees, one summons above the Jade Sovereign and the Nine Lords, the profound essence illuminating within, severing and sealing the root of death. One must quiet the heart in the chamber of the inner court, unperturbed by wind or dust, standing alone facing the realm. Gazing upon the dawn and dusk, spread incense to left and right, dispersing the smoke and rosy clouds throughout the courtyard. In the essence, one bitterly contemplates, preserving thought without sleep. Thus, after seven years, one shall summon the jade chariot and flying canopy, the cinnabar chariot to come welcome the destined body, ascending the Heavenly Gate, sealing the death path in the northeast, recording the register of life in the southern immortal realm. This is the path hard to hope for, yet the true one easily descended.

Now, those who possess the golden tally and jade name, upon receiving this dao, must choose the six auspicious days of Renyin, Bingyin, Jiazi, Jiawu, Xinwei, and Xinchou—these six gatherings when the Most High aligns and harmonizes. The Jade Emperor often uses these days to dispatch the immortal jade attendants to verify the Azure Splendor of the Eastern Palace’s golden tally and jade name, recording the students of immortality. On these days, those who diligently aspire to ascend and penetrate, stirring the Jade Emperor’s favor, will command the Northern Emperor of Fengdu’s Six Palaces to sever the root of the death register, certify the life register at the human gate, secretly add the Seven Stars to the ghost gate, pass through the Mysterious Pivot, and open the Heavenly Gate.

Whenever one purifies by fasting, bitterly contemplates and concentrates on the profound, closing the eyes and preserving inward, one knocks the teeth thirty-six times to open the passages, thinking of the First Supreme Star, the Mysterious Pivot, the Yang Bright Heavenly Pivot, the soul and spirit, the Supreme True Nine Lords above, clad in flying cloud brocade skirts, crowned with the dark dawn’s diadem, descending from the Mysterious Dipper into my body, then reciting the prayer:

> Mysterious Pivot, Yang Bright Heavenly Pivot, soul and spirit, Supreme True Nine Lords,  
> Mixed and transformed, united as one deity,  
> I beseech you to sever the death path at the ghost gate for me,  
> To ferry the life register to the southern pavilion,  
> To remove the seven mysteries in the three realms,  
> To receive the fetal birth and transform into immortal again,  
> To return the seven essences under the mysterious shade,  
> To ferry my form through the Heavenly Gate.

Upon completion, one swallows the breath twice and seven times passes. Persisting in practice without weariness, one summons the Jade Emperor’s guests; the Emperor descends in purple rosy clouds, guarded by twelve precious jade maidens and twelve golden dawn jade youths, protecting the body.

Next, think of the Second Primordial Star, the Northern Fetus, Yin Essence, Heavenly Pivot soul and spirit, Supreme Jade Nine Lords, dressed in yellow brocade flying skirts, crowned with the dark dawn’s diadem, descending from the Mysterious Dipper into my body, swallowing breath and chanting the spell:

> Northern Fetus, Yin Essence, Heavenly Pivot soul, Supreme Jade Nine Lords,  
> Mixed and endlessly transformed, united as one deity,  
> I beseech you to erase yang sins at the Great Yin,  
> To ferry yin qi at the Great Yang,  
> To shift the seven origins and sever death,  
> To open the six harmonies at the Heavenly Gate,  
> To extract the seven ancestors from the three realms,  
> To receive the fetal root at the southern pavilion.

Upon completion, swallow the breath twice and seven times pass.

Next, think of the Third True Star, Nine Extremes, Supreme True Upper Origin Lady, Heavenly Measure soul essence, Supreme Pure Nine Lords, clad in blue brocade flying skirts, crowned with the dark dawn’s diadem, descending from the Mysterious Dipper into my body, reciting the breath spell:

> Nine Extremes, Supreme True Upper Origin Lady, Heavenly Measure soul essence, Supreme Pure Nine Lords,  
> Mixed and transformed, united as one deity,  
> I beseech you to open and resolve the root of past debts,  
> To sever the source of the death path,  
> To grant me clear vision and penetrating insight,  
> To gaze infinitely,  
> To look up to the mysterious truth,  
> To pour essence into my body,  
> To climb the imperial leader,  
> To fly the seven origins,  
> To ride the light and soar through emptiness,  
> To incline with Heaven.

Upon completion, swallow the breath twice and seven times pass.

Next, think of the Fourth Pivot Star, Long Ji, Mysterious Darkness, Heavenly Authority soul essence, Supreme Void Nine Lords, clad in purple brocade flying skirts, crowned with the dark dawn’s diadem, descending from the Mysterious Dipper into my body, then chanting the spell:

> Long Ji, Mysterious Darkness, Heavenly Authority soul essence, Supreme Void Nine Lords,  
> Mixed and endlessly transformed, united as one deity,  
> I beseech you to shift and ferry the Seven Stars,  
> To fill and seal the ghost gate,  
> To sever and block the death qi,  
> To open the bright Heavenly Gate,  
> To return the Northern Dipper to the Mysterious Pivot,  
> To ferry life qi to the Western Kun,  
> To separate the Northern Emperor from Fengdu,  
> To obtain the recorded name at the southern pavilion.

Upon completion, swallow the breath twice and seven times pass.

Next, think of the Fifth Firm Star, Heavenly Balance, Cinnabar Origin, Jade Scale soul spirit, Supreme Mysterious Nine Sovereign Lords, clad in cinnabar brocade skirts, crowned with the dark dawn’s diadem, descending from the Mysterious Dipper into my body, then chanting the spell:

> Heavenly Balance, Cinnabar Origin, Jade Scale soul spirit, Supreme Mysterious Nine Sovereign Lords,  
> Mixed and endlessly transformed, united as one deity,  
> I beseech you to send down the seven essences upon me,  
> To pour into my body,  
> To return the four turns and three,  
> To open the seven origins,  
> To seal the death gate at the Northern Bind,  
> To receive the life palace at the Nine Mysteries,  
> To record the name at the Eastern Splendor,  
> To serve the Jade Dawn.

Upon completion, swallow the breath twice and seven times pass.

Next, think of the Sixth Record Star, Life Mechanism, Northern Pole, Kai Yang soul spirit, Supreme Cinnabar Emperor, Supreme Void Nine Lords, clad in vermilion brocade flying skirts, crowned with the dark dawn’s diadem, descending from the Mysterious Dipper into my body, chanting the spell:

> Life Mechanism, Northern Pole, Kai Yang soul spirit, Supreme Cinnabar Emperor, Supreme Void Nine Lords,  
> Mixed and endlessly transformed, united as one deity,  
> I beseech you to open the first three celestial charts and mysterious gates above,  
> To turn downward to the Northern Emperor’s Fengdu Six Palaces,  
> To command and control the Yin officials,  
> To eliminate the root of nine deaths,  
> To return three and restore four,  
> To ferry the name of the seven origins,  
> To maintain endless longevity,  
> To be of the same age as the Dipper.

Upon completion, swallow the breath twice and seven times pass.

Next, think of the Seventh Gate Star, Mysterious Yang, Heavenly Gate, Shaking Light, Great Brightness, Most High Jade Emperor Dao Lord, clad in cinnabar brocade flying gauze skirts, crowned with the dark dawn’s diadem, descending from the Mysterious Dipper into my body, then chanting the spell:

> Mysterious Yang, Heavenly Gate, Shaking Light, Great Brightness, Most High Jade Emperor Dao Lord,  
> Mixed and endlessly transformed, united as one deity,  
> I beseech you to summon above the Imperial Morning Nine True Imperial Lords,  
> To mix the nine yins,  
> To turn the heavenly gate,  
> To resolve the seven mysteries’ ancestors,  
> To grant me the freedom to roam the mysterious clouds,  
> To erase my Northern Yin death root,  
> To record my Eastern Splendor jade chapter.

Upon completion, swallow the breath twice and seven times pass.

When the seven origins are preserved, knock the teeth twelve times to open the passages, close the eyes and think of the Seven Stars of the North. Their radiant light shines brilliantly upon the north, the star essence reflecting within, coming to cover my body. The true lords within the Dipper, in primordial chaos and transformation, have no fixed form, together riding the green rosy clouds to welcome my body, ascending with me among the Seven Stars. I feel my body beneath the central canopy of the Dipper, the essence light blazing brilliantly, a crown encircling my entire form, turning with the Dipper like the wheel of a chariot. In a moment, the Heavenly Gate is opened; the Seven Stars and Nine Lords each bestow upon me the talismans to open the seven origins and gates, to control the Northern Emperor’s Six Palaces, severing and sealing the root of death qi. Receiving the talismans, I whirl, returning to my original primordial state, still within the Dipper. The seven talismans blaze brightly like the essence of fire, guiding me downward, suddenly stepping upon the void, in an instant resting upon my bed. I knock the teeth thirty-six times, raise my head and chant:

> Mysterious light shines bright, flowing radiance shakes the form,  
> Riding the rosy clouds, shifting and transforming, ascending the Seven Stars,  
> The Heavenly One opens the gate, ferrying me to birth,  
> Northern Emperor’s Yin palace, dropping my death name,  
> Neither ferrying nor dropping, ascending to the Seven Essences,  
> I wear the seven origins, flowing golden fire bells,  
> Opening the heavenly mechanism, spreading through the eight dark realms,  
> Commanding the six Jia, directing the six Ding,  
> Heaven descends the mysterious canopy, the Emperor grants divine weapons,  
> Begging the Eastern Splendor to record my jade name,  
> Flying through the void, riding the emptiness,  
> Ascending to Jade Clarity.

Upon completion, swallow the breath thirty-six times once and stop. Thus, the dao of opening the Heavenly Gate and severing the root of death, mingling and transforming endlessly, is completed here. Practiced for seven years, wearing the talisman of the seven origins, one shall have the flying rosy green litter come to welcome the destined body. This is secret cultivation; be careful not to lightly transmit it.

**The Imperial Lord’s Talisman of the Seven Origins**

The talisman for opening the Heavenly Gate is within the lower scroll. After completing the practice of shifting the Seven Stars, and practicing for seven years, one wears the talisman of the seven origins.

Within the scroll is a painted image of the Perfected Person, besides the annotations, also wearing a jade crown and green cape, crimson robe and vermilion shoes, riding on five-colored clouds. The Perfected Person is depicted wearing a jade crown and yellow robe, green cape and blue skirt. The rest of the palace halls are decorated with gold, arranged suitably.

**The Northern Emperor Fengdu Six Palaces’ Method of Ferrying the Dead**

Mount Fengdu lies in the northern Gui direction, thus the northeast is the ghost gate, root of death qi. The mountain rises over one thousand six hundred li, encircling thirty thousand li. Its mountain caverns lie beneath the mountain, encircling fifteen thousand li. Above and below are ghost and spirit palaces and chambers. On the mountain are six palaces; within the caverns are six palaces, each palace encircling one thousand li. These are the palaces of the six and two heavens of ghost spirits.

The first is named the Palace of Severing Yin.

The second is named the Palace of Supreme Killing and Honest Affairs.

The third is named the Palace of Bright Dawn and Endurance of Offense.

The fourth is named the Palace of Tranquil Illumination and Sin Qi.

The fifth is named the Palace of Ancestral Spirit and Seven Faults.

The sixth is named the Palace of Daring to Manage Linked Repeated Matters.

These six palaces are governed by the Northern Emperor, ruled by the six heavens of ghost spirits, overseeing the death names of humans. None who die escape passing through Fengdu’s Six Palaces. Therefore, the Imperial Lord always allows those practicing the Seven Stars’ Shifting Degrees to pass the Heavenly Gate, opening the southern pole palace and sealing the northeast ghost gate.

When one completes the shifting degrees, one must knock the left teeth nine times, call the names of the Six Palaces, and chant:

> I am the Imperial Lord’s servant, named by Jade Clarity,  
> Commanding the six heavens below, the Northern Emperor’s ghost palace,  
> All are my camp, my domain. What ghosts dare to arise?  
> Wearing the talisman of seven origins on the right, bearing the fire bell on the left,  
> Casting fire ten thousand li, commanding ten thousand spirits,  
> Those who offend are executed, those who interfere are destroyed.  
> The Imperial Lord commands, capturing without pause.

When this is done, one chant causes the heavenly light to tremble, ten thousand demons are bound, after three chants the ghosts and spirits are exterminated, the Six Palaces sever the human death names, the Heavenly Gate ferries the person, the southern pole gives birth to the person. Those who do not know the names of the Fengdu palaces and the spirits that govern them cannot sever the root of death; without learning this, one cannot become immortal.

After completing the shifting degrees of the Seven Stars, next think to preserve one Imperial Venerable Two Stars. Sitting upright facing east, knock the teeth thirty-six times to open the passages, preserving the Imperial Venerable Two Stars, the Most High Jade Emperor’s Eight Scenic Sovereigns, Nine Venerables, the Supreme Emperor of the Great Microcosm, the Seven Stars of the Supreme Origin, all clad in flying cloud purple brocade skirts, crowned with the dark dawn’s diadem, descending from the Mysterious Dipper into my body, chanting:

> Most High Jade Emperor, Eight Scenic Sovereigns, Nine Venerables,  
> Supreme Emperor of the Great Microcosm, Seven Stars of the Supreme Origin,  
> Nine transformations mixed, the two Imperial Venerables above,  
> I beseech you to open the Heavenly Gate for me,  
> To ferry the jade name,  
> To sever and seal the ghost gate, the Northern Emperor’s Six Palaces’ death root,  
> To ascend the seven origins,  
> To bestow upon me the Eight Scenic Seven Essences Nine Sovereign flying chariot and green litter,  
> To ascend the Imperial Morning,  
> To attend the Imperial Consort,  
> To govern ten thousand spirits.

Upon completion, swallow the breath three times seven and pass.

Next, preserve the Imperial Venerable Two Talismans, ascending beneath the Seven Stars’ canopy. The two venerable stars govern beneath the canopy, always covering the two stars; their essence light is unseen, and humans cannot see them. Therefore, the golden script of the jade characters says: “Those who see the two stars shall extend their life six hundred thousand years.” Without the two Imperial flying talismans, one cannot ascend beneath the canopy, nor see the two stars. Wearing the two talismans, the two Imperial Venerables naturally shine their mysterious light upon one’s body. Practicing for nine years, by day one ascends the morning.

**The Supreme Method of the Five Separations to Resolve and Sever Death, Ferrying Life**

When practicing the dao of the Six Meetings and One Opening Ferrying, one must cultivate the Five Mornings’ Separation at the death gate, ferrying at the life official’s palace the method of the flying immortal. One must choose the five days of Ren Shen, Bing Shen, Wu Shen, Jia Shen, and Geng Shen, the Five Separations’ days. At these times, the Imperial Lord holds a grand banquet, riding the Dragon of Radiance’s chariot, the green pavilion’s flying litter, descending with immortal officials and jade maidens, circling ten heavens, descending to the human world to observe those who study immortality. One’s fate is carried by the Northern Emperor’s Tai Cang Five Lords, bearing the death register to ascend the Palace of the Equal Capital, verifying and examining the life register.

The Five Directions’ Five Star True Sovereign Lords each govern one direction, overseeing the immortals who deserve the dao, called the Binding Splendor. Yin sins and yin faults, yang sins and yang faults, are bound to the Northern Emperor’s Great Yin Lord, called the Palace of Fengdu, separating good and evil, life and death. Therefore, on the Five Separations’ days, the foremost sins belong to the Great Yin, cultivating life at the Great Yang, dropping the death register at the Northern Emperor, seeking immortality at the Five Stars.

Each time these days come, one prepares a grand fast, dons proper clothing, burns incense entering the chamber, repents faults and contemplates virtue, preserving the spirit inwardly, focusing the mind on the profound without other thoughts. The Imperial Lord tours the Three Realms, the divine officials record one’s merit, called the Jade Emperor’s record. Practicing thus for five years, one may obtain the Five Stars’ True Sovereigns, descending to one’s chamber.

On each Five Separation day, at dawn, noon, and midnight, one enters the chamber, burns incense, bows twice facing north, knocks the teeth three times, and chants:

> Most High Jade Emperor, I beg you to remove all my sins and faults from the seven ancestors until now,  
> Including all my own yin evil and yang faults,  
> Killing, lust, arrogance, countless offenses,  
> Yang sins and yin faults reported to the Northern Emperor,  
> Please remove and scatter, erase all sin names,  
> Sever the root of death, ferry me into the Heavenly Gate,  
> To be recorded in the Eastern Splendor jade chapter,  
> Seven ancestors and grandparents, return to fetal birth at the southern immortal realm.

Upon completion, think of the Northern Direction’s Chen Star True Sovereign Lord Essence Origin, clad in purple brocade flying skirts, waist bound with a tiger tally, crowned with a splendid crown, riding green rosy flying clouds, accompanied by twelve immortal officials, descending from the north to cover my body, radiance dense and splendid, shining bright essence rays, chanting upwards:

> Northern True Sovereign, commander of flying immortals,  
> Riding clouds and returning litters, crowning my body,  
> I beg you to fill and seal the ghost gate,  
> Sever the root of death,  
> Called Jade Clarity, opening and releasing the Heavenly Gate,  
> I may depart from the Northern Emperor,  
> Ascend the Southern Pavilion,  
> Longevity with the True Sovereign,  
> Together protecting the Northern Morning.

Then swallow the breath twenty-five times and stop.

Facing east, bow twice, knock the teeth three times, and chant:

> Jade Morning Supreme Lord, Supreme Ultimate Origin Lord,  
> I beg you to remove all my yin sins and yang faults since a certain year,  
> Including the seven ancestors’ past heavy offenses,  
> Bound in the three yins,  
> Please open and release, sever and extinguish all sin names,  
> Fill and seal the root of death,  
> The Northern Emperor removes my ancestral bonds,  
> The Eastern Splendor records my jade chapter,  
> Seven mysteries’ parents, ascending the Imperial Morning.

Next, think of the Eastern Direction’s Jupiter True Sovereign Lord Qingya, clad in cloud brocade skirts with dragon patterns, waist bound with a tiger tally, crowned with a splendid crown, riding the blue rosy flying clouds and jade litter, accompanied by twelve immortal officials, descending from the east to cover my body, radiance dense and brilliant, chanting towards the east:

> Eastern True Sovereign, flowing rosy nine gates,  
> Light shining inside and out, covering and crowning the destined body,  
> I beg you to grant me,  
> To report downward to the Northern Emperor,  
> To sever my death root,  
> Ferry my jade name,  
> Eastern Splendor’s inner truth,  
> I may ascend and ferry,  
> Forever departing the death path,  
> Seven mysteries’ parents,  
> Achieving blessings and prosperity,  
> Living with the moon,  
> Setting with the sun,  
> Riding the void and floating in the air,  
> Ascending the flying steps.

Then swallow the breath nine times and stop.

Facing south, bow twice, knock the teeth three times, and chant:

> Supreme Lords of the Three Origins of Supreme Clarity,  
> Southern Pole Upper Origin Lord,  
> Solar Nine Qi Jade Worthy Supreme Lord,  
> I beg you to remove all my original sins since a certain time,  
> Including unfilial acts, rebellion, lawlessness,  
> Adultery, theft, yin sins, yang faults,  
> Including the seven ancestors’ bonds and debts,  
> Recorded at the Great Yin,  
> Sin names tied to the Northern Morning,  
> I beg you to open and release, sever and extinguish,  
> The Three Officials’ ancestral bonds,  
> Fill and seal the root of death qi,  
> Ferry through the northeast gate,  
> Ascend the southwest opening gate,  
> Seven mysteries’ parents,  
> All receiving the Emperor’s grace.

Upon completion, next think of the Southern Direction’s Mars True Sovereign Lord Huaiding, clad in cloud frost phoenix and dragon bell skirts, waist bound with a tiger tally, crowned with the dark dawn’s diadem, flying blue brocade robes, riding the cinnabar rosy litter, accompanied by twelve immortal officials, descending from the south to cover my body, radiance brilliant like the rising sun, chanting upwards:

> Southern True Sovereign, mysterious image flowing light,  
> Wandering the three gates,  
> Riding the cinnabar litter,  
> Ascending the seven origins,  
> Light shining within,  
> Penetrating and crowning my body,  
> For me to descend and sever the Northern Emperor’s sin names,  
> To resolve and scatter bonds and stagnations,  
> To eliminate the Great Yin,  
> To depart from within the ghost gate,  
> Severing the root of ancestral bonds,  
> Ascending and opening the Heavenly Gate,  
> Entering the Southern Pavilion,  
> Seven ancestors and grandparents,  
> Together visiting before the Emperor.

Then swallow the breath eight times and stop.

Facing west, bow twice, knock the teeth three times, and chant:

> Supreme Origin Three Yuan Lords,  
> Four Elders of the Dao’s Center,  
> I beg you to forgive all my original offenses since I became aware,  
> Including offenses and violations,  
> Carelessly divulging scriptures,  
> Treading filth and dust,  
> Arrogance and neglect of the Three Lights,  
> Curses, oaths, and tears,  
> Touching the Imperial Lord,  
> Ancestral bonds tied to the Great Yin,  
> Sin names tied to the ghost officials,  
> I beg you to open and release, sever and extinguish,  
> Sever the root of death,  
> Seal the death path,  
> Ferry through the gate of life,  
> Seven ancestors and grandparents,  
> Ascending the hall of blessings.

Upon completion, think of the Western Direction’s Venus True Sovereign Lord, clad in white brocade flowing bell skirts, waist bound with a tiger emblem, crowned with the dawn-supporting crown, riding the white rosy flying litter, accompanied by twelve immortal officials, descending from the west to cover my body, light penetrating and brilliant in the west, then chanting upwards:

> Western True Sovereign, pure shining mysterious mark,  
> Riding the jade litter,  
> White brilliance soaring to the heavens,  
> Turning the dawn to descend,  
> True form opening and crossing,  
> For me to turn the nine gates,  
> Ferrying the imperial court,  
> Departing the Great Yin’s register,  
> Ascending the mysterious palace in harmony,  
> Longevity tilting heaven and earth,  
> Countless years without decay,  
> Seven mysteries’ parents,  
> All ascending the morning sky.

Upon completion, swallow the breath six times and stop.

Facing the center, bow twice, knock the teeth three times, and chant:

> Most High Supreme Emperor Jade Sovereign Lord,  
> I beg you to forgive all my offenses since birth until today,  
> Countless faults and debts,  
> Seven ancestors’ bonds and stains unresolved,  
> Matters tied to the Great Yin,  
> I beg you to remove and open, sever and scatter,  
> The Northern Emperor’s mysterious name,  
> Sever the Gui earth ghost gate’s root of death qi,  
> Ferry through the Heavenly Gate,  
> Passing through the Five Mornings,  
> Seven mysteries’ parents,  
> All receiving transformation to immortality.

Upon completion, next think of the Central Guard Star True Sovereign Lord Tan Chengyan, clad in yellow cloud dragon brocade tiger skirts, waist bearing a golden tally, crowned with a purple crown, riding the yellow rosy flying litter, accompanied by twelve immortal officials, descending from the center, crowning and covering my body, light penetrating and brilliant, shining down the middle origin, then chanting upwards:

> Central Guard Star True Sovereign Lord,  
> Commander of the Five Emperors,  
> Turning the mysterious thread,  
> Riding the yellow rosy litter,  
> Touring the four directions,  
> For me to sever the root of death,  
> Ferrying the name to the Southern Yang palace,  
> Departing the five and returning to six,  
> Flying with me,  
> Transforming myriad crossings,  
> Forever enjoying boundlessness,  
> Ascending the Supreme Ultimate Golden Palace Jade Hall,  
> Seven ancestors and grandparents,  
> Together bearing blessings and prosperity.

Upon completion, swallow the breath twelve times and stop.

The Five Separations first pass through the Five Emperors, preserving the Five Mornings to ferry life; the matter is completed here. If one always reaches these days and practices without ceasing, after seven years one will deeply perceive the Five Mornings’ True Sovereigns, seeing their forms in one’s chamber. The Supreme Emperor personally dispatches five jade maidens from the five directions to guard one’s body. The Northern Emperor of Great Yin also comes to attend one’s gate, not daring to restrain one’s sins. Those who study immortality and seek truth should diligently practice.

Repenting and seeking the dao of immortality is the method by which the Prime Minister Qing Tong respectfully requests the Golden Palace Holy Lord’s method, to serve as a warning for later seekers of life. It is not the Supreme Emperor’s repentance. Practicing this matter, the Imperial Lord also judges one’s heart; if ancestral faults are not exhausted, the Six Heavens’ palaces will not release one’s death name, the opening and closing palace will not ferry one’s body. Therefore, the palace of separation and union is the source of filling death; the gate of opening and closing is the palace of ferrying life. Only by refining the essence can one obtain the true path.

**Imperial Lord’s Bright Lamp Inner Observation Method for Seeking Immortality**

Received from the Southern Pole Upper Origin Lord

The Imperial Lord always dwells on the platform of bright mystery, within the golden chamber and purple door, illuminating himself with the bright mysterious lamp, connecting the rosy light through the eight windows, contemplating the Supreme Truth within the five forms, opening the three wishes in the Imperial chamber. The spiritual sovereign descends upon the purple canopy, the Primordial Emperor bestows a golden youth, naturally proclaiming my imperial rank, commanding the mysterious palace. The highest grade is born from the subtle marvel; the dao lies in the faint gleam. Now I announce this to you; you must diligently observe it.

He speaks to the Southern Pole Upper Origin Lord: You study the way of divine truth, residing atop the spiritual palace, within the jade chamber, yet do not know to use the bright lamp to illuminate yourself, to pass the mysterious light into the five organs within, thereby gaining clarity, the spirit of the body returning. If you can light the lamp at dusk upon your original life, light it at dawn upon your active year, and always keep the lamp lit upon the annual lord, these three places of wishing and contemplation will purify your essence, correct your qi, the true light illuminating within, all spirits shining clearly. The Primordial Lord receives the method; practicing for three years, one will bring forth twenty-four night-light youths, the mysterious light naturally bright, no need for lamps to communicate light. Yet this supreme true subtle method is not transmitted to later generations. If one has the golden name, jade characters, and mysterious tally, obtaining this dao and practicing for nine years, the body will shine with light, seeing through ten thousand li, clearly observing nature. Night-light youths will descend to one’s chamber, granting true scriptures; by day one ascends the morning.

Always keep the lamp lit above the chamber of original life. At dusk, entering the chamber, kneel long facing the lamp, knock the teeth twelve times, and chant:

> Mysterious light shines on the Great Yin,  
> Eight directions reach bright and clear,  
> Purifying spirit, wrapping the chamber,  
> Gazing upward illuminating Supreme Clarity,  
> The five radiances shine on the bright platform,  
> Jade mushrooms naturally grow,  
> Illuminating and passing through the Supreme Truth,  
> Ten thousand spirits watch over my form,  
> Severing and extinguishing the nine yin qi,  
> Recording my name in the Eastern Splendor,  
> Protecting me without end,  
> Long enduring with sun and moon,  
> Extracting and ferrying the seven mysteries’ difficulties,  
> The Southern Palace further receives honor,  
> Bright light plays before the Jade Emperor,  
> Receiving the inner observation scripture,  
> Heaven descends the flying rosy chariot,  
> Soaring through the void riding the green litter,  
> Gaining audience at the Supreme Emperor’s hall,  
> Advancing to bow at the Jade Emperor’s court.

Upon completion, bow again, face the original life, raise the head, swallow saliva seven times and stop.

Also, always keep the lamp lit above the active year. In the morning, facing the lamp, knock the teeth twelve times, and chant:

> Bright lamp shines on the active year,  
> Scattering light illuminating the eight directions,  
> Clear and pure color and form,  
> Inner observation bright as the void,  
> Opening and releasing the bright spiritual collar,  
> You communicate with the Jade Truth,  
> Gazing upward to the Most High Dao,  
> Remote and without trace,  
> Thinking to receive the descending mysterious cloud,  
> Holding reins to ride the flying dragon,  
> Returning my hundred-year term,  
> Returning to infant form,  
> Granting me the Western Splendor maiden,  
> Giving me the golden dawn youth,  
> Attending incense and wearing the year’s fate,  
> Bowing to the Jade Emperor’s chamber,  
> Spirit peaceful, dao also smooth,  
> Fearing to enter the incense smoke,  
> Straightening the heart, focusing on the Supreme Mystery,  
> Essence moved to penetrate the void,  
> Chamber summons the divine heavens to descend,  
> Closing eyes, gazing at the immortal lord,  
> Extracting faults and seven ancestors’ difficulties,  
> Ferrying the form back to the Southern Palace.

Upon completion, bow again, face the lamp, swallow breath twice and seven times pass.

Always light the lamp above the annual lord to communicate with the spirit, reason the wish to seek truth. After three years, the mysterious light illuminates within, the divine truth descends, granting the method of immortality. At that time, there will be response. Each morning and evening, burn incense, knock the teeth twelve times, face the lamp, and chant:

> Lamp fire shines on the Supreme Truth,  
> Bright light penetrates the mysterious void,  
> Opening and dispersing the unsurpassed dao,  
> Heart focused on the Jade Emperor’s abode,  
> Penetrating the empty cavity within,  
> Spirit sees the form and relaxes,  
> Accumulating feeling to bring down the spirit,  
> Heart calm, principle hidden,  
> Morning rites at the Supreme Emperor’s hall,  
> Evening reciting the Golden Truth scripture,  
> Wandering freely wrapped in the mysterious capital,  
> Ten thousand years returning to infant state,  
> Heaven crowned with purple rosy clouds,  
> Emperor grants the green jade chariot,  
> Floating and roaming the five peaks’ summits,  
> At will attaining what is desired,  
> Seven ancestors freed from the three realms,  
> Blessings and prosperity come in abundance.

Upon completion, bow again, swallow saliva twice and seven times pass.

If one can constantly keep the three lamps lit without extinguishing, the seven mysteries and nine ancestors will be freed from the ten sufferings of departure and separation, ascending to the southern immortal realm. One’s entire spirit will be clear and correct, eyes seeing ten thousand li, ears hearing far, mind knowing the unforeseen. The divine truth will descend, night-light youths will instruct one in the dao of immortality. After nine years thus, the spiritual light will naturally shine, communicating with the outer wrapping. The Five Separations first pass through the Five Emperors, preserving the Five Mornings to ferry life; the matter is completed here.

**Imperial Lord’s Five Wishes Method for Seeking Immortality**

The Imperial Lord always ascends on the ninth day of the ninth month, the fifth day of the tenth month, the third day of the third month, the eighth day of the fourth month, and the seventh day of the seventh month. These are the five wishes’ ten gatherings. He ascends the Supreme Ultimate Jade Terrace, within the Most High Jade Palace’s golden chamber, preserving the five wishes within the jade palace, hoping the mysterious truth will descend upon himself, the void opening to the Jade Emperor, golden sounds spreading through the supreme space, summoning the Five Emperors to guard the spirit, ten thousand celebrations gathering in the cinnabar chamber. Thus there is response and true manifestation.

On these days, one bathes and purifies, enters the chamber to burn incense, bows to the four directions, sitting upright facing the proper direction. Facing east is the direction of the beginning yang light. Knock the teeth thirty-six times. The first wish is: May I be born of natural qi, the qi forming my body, my body equal with the Three Lights, long enjoying the root of endlessness. The second wish is: May my body always dwell above the supreme space, within the jade palace and jade chamber, dining with the Jade Emperor in the morning, resting with the Mysterious Mother at night, thirst quenched by the vast jade mushrooms of the waves and springs, hunger satisfied by dragon fetus, jade fat, crimson trees, and red infants. The third wish is: May my body be born with myriad auspicious signs, seventy-two lights, strange hair and wondrous bones, flying feathered garments, riding clouds and driving the void, entering and exiting the imperial palace, all celebrations arriving. The fourth wish is: To be born with the void, to die with the void, dying and being born again, born as the True Sovereign, appointed to govern the Ten Heavens, commanding the host of immortals. The fifth wish is: May all beings, born and unborn, together protect the sun, moon, and Three Lights. Those with the dao, the seven mysteries’ ancestors, ascend the southern palace, all the world’s blessings without exception.

The four directions’ five wishes all gather in the jade hall.

Next, the first wish: The nine mysteries nurture my body, soul, spirit, and true gods constantly dwell in my palace, connecting above to the celestial immortals, below reaching the cavernous abyss. May Heaven, Earth, Wind, Spirit, and Immortal, the five wishes united, fix the register of longevity, Heaven descending purple smoke, Earth guarding the five spirits, riding clouds and driving the void, flying chariots and green litters, ascending to the golden palace, advancing to Jade Clarity, celebrating with the seven ancestors, again receiving fetal birth. The five wishes united, long enjoying benefit and virtue.

The middle wish also fivefold: To gain the root of the dao, may Yin, Yang, Supreme Space, Supreme Nothingness, Supreme Mystery, feast in the jade chamber with the Emperor, roaming the palace of birth, opening the nine heavens, the primordial father fixing the register, the mysterious mother recording the years, peach health binding essence, securing the cinnabar field, body soaring to the golden palace, name recorded in the jade chapter, seven ancestors freed, blessings and prosperity arriving.

The lower wish also fivefold: May Supreme Void, Supreme Existence, Supreme Above, Supreme Truth, and Spirit Immortal, move the body upon the five peaks’ summits, floating and drifting in the nine skies, entering and exiting the opening and closing palace, shifting and escaping beyond the death gate. May Heaven and Earth be my parents, the Three Lights guard me for ten thousand years, spirits watch the nine origins’ apertures, spirits descend the natural qi, the eight directions’ five wishes respond together.

When the five wishes are complete, knock the teeth twice and seven times to open the passages, and chant:

> Great Emperor, Upper Origin, Emperor One, Mysterious Scripture,  
> Five clouds scatter light, dense and flourishing the Three Clarities,  
> Jade youths and maidens, burning incense attending the spirit,  
> The upper wish opens and unfolds, merging with my form,  
> Making me spirit immortal, ascending the imperial court,  
> Northern Emperor dropping death,  
> Southern Pole attending life,  
> Eastern Splendor golden tally,  
> Granting me the highest name,  
> Endless wishes,  
> Together with me.

Upon completion, knock the teeth three times seven, raise the head, swallow breath five times and stop.

This is the Imperial Lord’s method of opening and unfolding the five wishes, merging with the spirit and form. Those who can constantly do this will have the jade splendor guarding and attending, jade youths scattering incense, ascending through the Nine Heavens, responding to the Emperor and Sovereign. After five years thus, the dao naturally descends.

The dao of the Ten Directions’ wishes is such; the dao never fails to descend upon one’s sincerity. When uttering the wishes, one must keep the mind and intention united, without other thoughts or distractions. If the true spirit scatters, the truth will not descend. If one treads filth and defilement, the truth will also be distant. The Imperial Lord’s method of the five wishes’ ten gatherings is completed here. Each time these days come, if one can focus the heart and wish according to the method, the Emperor dispatches jade youths to guard one’s body, summoning the five directions’ wishes, the dao of immortals descending upon one’s form. After five years, one may ride clouds to ascend the Nine Heavens, be listed among the illustrious, seven ancestors and grandparents also bearing blessings and prosperity, gaining release from the three realms, receiving immortality in the southern palace.

The Southern Pole Upper Origin Lord says: The world’s people studying only know to seek in the morning and gain by evening, one thought hoping for descent, spitting spells and expecting response, yet do not know to ascend the peak of Qiqi, starting from mountain traces, a thousand-zhang tree growing from a hair’s tip. The dao is lofty and truly subtle; how can one step forth and ascend the cloud ladder? The Imperial Lord receives qi and commands the truth, still illuminating the lamp to communicate, five wishes to seek blessings. How could it not encompass nature? The dao of seeking immortality must first wish then seek the wish, responding and bringing forth the spirit. The greatness of the five wishes is vast; the wishes encompass all, blessings cover all, prosperity flows everywhere. One may call this the purification of good wishes. If one can focus the heart on the wishes, there will be no lack of response. Later seekers may revisit and reflect upon this.

The Prime Minister Qing Tong says: I have studied for seven hundred years, traversing steep peaks, crossing east and west, south and north, roaming the Central Plains, studying under thirty-two masters, receiving over three hundred matters, yet have not ascended the Golden Palace to visit the Holy Lord and receive the spiritual purple script, nor mastered the dao of binding souls and restraining spirits by the sun and moon’s yellow splendor, nor the nine truths and eight daos of the jade pattern, nor the method of shape escape and transformation by the purple degree of flame light, nor the golden fire bell’s breathing and flying rosy clouds, nor the soaring steps upon clouds, nor the seven origins’ precious scripture. The Holy Lord treasures the Seven Stars’ Shifting Degrees, telling me the oath and granting it, severing the death name of the six palaces, filling and sealing the northeast ghost gate. Only then can one ascend the Three Origins to carry out the dao, becoming the Prime Minister’s steward, commanding the host of immortals, the Seven Stars blazing in the heavens, turning the nine origins’ essence, riding the three origins’ qi above, commanding the six heavens’ names below. Life and death, separation and union, all depend on the Seven Stars. When humans are added by the Dipper, they die; when shifted by the Dipper, they live. Thus the Seven Stars are heaven’s minister, the opening and closing palace is the palace of ferrying life. Those who do not know to sever the death gate at the Northern Dipper, ferry the life register at the southern gate, how can life be preserved? The Most High God moved this scripture to the house of the six harmonies, commanding three hundred Western Splendor jade maidens and golden dawn youths to guard the spirit script. Later passed to many true ones, emerging from famous mountains. The King Lord of the Western City later, within the stone chamber of the Wangwu, saw this text. The King Lord was then in retreat fasting for three months, bearing faith to the mountain, receiving and inspecting it. This is the Seven Stars’ Shifting Degrees; practicing this dao one becomes a Perfected Person. Without the jade name, none who become immortals can hear or see this dao. Those with the scripture have their names recorded in Fengdu’s Six Palaces, ferrying the southern gate; how much more if they cultivate? The King Lord said: This originally had three scrolls, the Heavenly Gate and Heavenly Chart two scrolls, not circulated in the world. The Lady of the Southern Mountain received only one scroll, the Seven Stars’ Shifting Degrees.
