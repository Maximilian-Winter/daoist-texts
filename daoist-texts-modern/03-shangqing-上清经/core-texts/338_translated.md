### The Inner Text of the Qing Tong Chapter of the Shangqing Foreign Release Scripture, Scroll One

**The Inner Text of the Supreme Person Guoyin Yuan**

The Most High True Jade Protector King of Shangqing, the Supreme Minister and Grand Marshal, commanded the exalted morning master of the Eastern Sea Jade Gate, the Qinghua Little Youth Lord, to receive the Inner Text of the Hidden Origin of the Foreign Release Chapter from the Most High Jade Emperor. This dao is supremely profound, born before the Nine Mysteries, weaving the flying mysterious purple qi of nature into its chapters. The numinous script reveals marvels, shining with the radiance of Shangqing, enduring through ninety thousand kalpas, inscribed on the sacred bird mountain of the Green Na country, set upon the eastern flower’s peak, the mysterious garden’s piled stones in shadow. Flowing light and cavernous brilliance reflect into the vast heavens, the sun and moon shine heroically, five dawns wing the spirit, eight pure strands intertwine, four gatherings knot smoke, soaring clouds veil the air, lush and verdant is the empty court.

Three hundred daughters of golden splendor and three hundred jade dawn youths attend as divine scribes and guards. The Heavenly Consort raises incense, the numinous wind scatters the truth; flying dragons and roaming beasts array the jade gates; vermilion phoenixes stroke their wings; divine luan birds shade the mystery; the Western Flower hosts banquets and rites; myriad saints pay homage at the pavilion. On the first day of the third month in the first year of the Central Sovereign, at the time when heavenly virtue is perfectly aligned, the Supreme Minister Qing Tong Lord fasted in the empty mountain, the golden-blue covenant of Heaven made, receiving from the Most High, journeying through the six countries, treading famous mountains, circling the Five Peaks, stepping the sources of rivers. The Five Emperors support and guide, descending to the numinous pavilion; the ten realms’ assembly of saints hold grand rites in the wide court; penetrating the profound and the remote, grasping the formless, flowing essence and shining light to communicate the dao; the sun excites lightning to unleash majesty; the seven primordials traverse the sky of purple emptiness; the eight scenes rein the reins and ascend in flight; chanting jade tones in foreign lands, releasing divine chapters to enter the subtle.

The Five Elders are commanded to arrange the ranks; ten thousand true ones summoned to gather; nine spirits harmonize contracts; three scenes unite in brilliance. The elixir spirit announces auspicious signs; the Most High supervises and reflects; the rank ascends to Supreme Minister; the name marked Purple Dawn; the body crowned with a nine-colored frost gauze robe; wearing the flowing light shining spirit cavern emblem; the crown of myriad transformations of the Numinous Treasure; flowing bells fall in chorus; cinnabar clouds entwine ninefold. Three thousand golden daughters, three thousand jade dawn youths attend as guards and lords.

Thus the Heavenly Mystery opens the rhyme, the model virtue responds truly; authority entrusted to the upper transformation; presiding over the Nine Heavens, governing all under Heaven; universally leading myriad immortals; the register of life and death, nothing left unconnected. The lord’s virtue and high dao complete; radiant and clear as jade pure; the seven primordials shine forth; the Five Elders attend the spirit; the three lights heroically shine; the nine emperors ride in procession; flying smoke and purple canopies; mysterious clouds born in emptiness; the jade maiden raises her voice; the spirits sound without net; dragon roars and phoenix songs; vast music in the empty court; flying clouds encircle the sun; flowing lightning excites essence; splendid light scatters and sprinkles; divine candles unite in brightness.

Alone riding the rhythm of the spirit talisman, hand waving the command demon spirit banner; roaming the pavilion of purple clouds; lingering in the chamber of Qinghua; commanding the six heavens in their coming fortune; cutting away myriad essences among the fierce beasts; gathering later disciples in golden slips; checking the azure registers of the ten directions; extending myriad emperors in curved characters; expounding treasured formulas in wondrous chapters; performing the Nine Mysteries to traverse fate; interpreting curves to reach the pupil’s haze; composing independence to harmonize truth; strictly surveying the four extremes to check violations; commanding the Four Officers to execute punishment; sealing the Five Emperors to correct errors; universally governing the infinite.

The four corners, six countries, Five Peaks, famous mountains; hundreds of millions of true ones, all without exception serve the Azure Palace, receiving orders from the Supreme Minister. Such precious text is the Most High’s mysterious natural chapter, weaving flying mysterious purple qi as hidden script; releasing thirty-six sounds of foreign lands; placing the six countries under the Five Elders’ offices; practiced by those who follow the dao of flying immortals; jade tones clear and bright; subtle meanings ethereal and profound; all expressing the resonance of the Supreme Sovereign’s ancient mystery. The four gatherings and eight reaches combine to form sound; the true delight is hard to detail, its principle hard to seek. Unless one is a purple embryo entwined, jade treasury fresh and open, a person whose nine orifices receive spirit, one cannot unravel its subtle rhyme or communicate with the jade tones.

The Most High keeps it deeply secret, thus passed by word of mouth. The Nine Heavens place the Left Assistant to hold the ritual of the Immortal Capital; the Right places the Jade Attendant and the Five Direction Spirit Officers, each with fifty thousand men, guarding the precious text. Jade boys and girls hold cloths and incense; mysterious spirits and purple canopies scatter smoke far into the court; myriad true ones gather, shining brightly in Shangqing.

On the eight festival days, the Most Holy Jade Emperor ascends the jade chamber, performs rites and chants the sounds; the jade resonance clear and penetrating, shaking the Nine Heavens. On the day this is written, the five stars emerge from their constellations; the seven primordials pause their radiance; the Five Emperors float in their stations; myriad immortals assemble in the court; a thousand demons lose their sight; legions of evil spirits lose their essence; power controls the six countries; countless realms fall silent and clear; divine marvels and wondrous transformations beyond speech; flowing glances through countless kalpas without extinction; great transformation changes the cycle and is fresh anew; numinous and splendid, lofty and majestic, hard to name.

If one possesses this scripture, all inscribed on slips before birth, named in the imperial register, fate responding to the immortal. Or a heavenly truth descends and grants this text; or by worldly cause and condition meets a scripture master; dreams and echoes respond, uniting with the true spirit. Receiving the jade tones, one should burn incense in a quiet chamber, perform rites and cultivate; chant it once, myriad true ones gather; the Five Elders pay homage; heavenly demons bow their heads; a thousand demons lose essence; power shakes the six countries; summons immortals and attains truth. After nine years, the three primordials visit the chamber; descending the cloud chariot, flying to Shangqing.

If one has this scripture but cannot cultivate in the world, with a pure heart and devoted offerings, then twelve jade boys and twelve jade girls will attend as guards left and right, protecting the body of the scripture holder; warding off myriad calamities, averting armor and weapons; a thousand troubles and ten thousand harms dare not rashly interfere; the Five Emperors defend and guard; one may obtain the lower immortal; or transform the corpse and wheel through reincarnation, ascending into the spirit chamber; but one may not receive the office of Jade Void, only roam among the Three Purities.

The Most High placed six countries’ inscriptions, transforming into thirty-six sounds. At the primordial beginning, the golden chisel inscribed its text, each placed in one country, now all sealed within the country’s borders, or sealed in famous mountains and Five Peaks’ caverns. Like China’s sound, it corresponds to the mysterious garden’s piled stones in shadow. Such divine text is each guarded by three hundred purple dawn jade boys and three hundred Taihua jade girls, attending incense. The old rules say in countless kalpas it shall be passed to true ones; those who obtain this text rise to immortal rank, able to roam the six countries, converse with the Five Elders, penetrate the mysterious void, command myriad spirits, without jade bones, inscribed on purple slips before birth.

**The Inner Sounds of the Most High Nine Mysteries Thirty-six Heavens**

The Most High Nine Mysteries hollow thirty-six heavens, cavern abyss nine earth foreign release chapter inner sounds were born before the great void nine mysteries, weaving flying mysterious purple qi natural chapters, numinous script soaring to the high firmament, true light shining in Shangqing, divine marvels manifest in the great Han, jade tones clear and stirring in the golden court, swirling winds flowing in purple smoke, raising incense scattering in the eight darknesses, cinnabar radiance issuing from its jade stem, vermilion sun irrigating its divine truth, flowing through countless kalpas, descending empty mysterious, three pure initiating motion, nine degrees pushing migration, numinous sounds manifest, inscribed on Kunlun mountain, on the mysterious garden’s piled stones in shadow, text brilliance hanging rays, essence shining in the upper heavens, sun and moon equal in light, five stars sharing brightness, four gatherings eight reaches, penetrating Jade Clarity, flying immortals and purple youths each three hundred, guarding incense waiting for spirit, wearing the beast of the celestial beast, defending with golden heads ten thousand layers, nine-colored flowing clouds covering the peak, divine luan and vermilion phoenix stroking their pavilion, Five Emperors supervising truth, Four Extremes governing immortals, seven luminaries emitting essence to shine fiercely, jade splendor scattering truth to adorn dust, treading yang and yin without weariness, enduring countless kalpas and ever fresh.

At the first year of the Central Sovereign, third month, first day, Jiazi, when heavenly virtue is perfectly aligned, the Most High True Jade Protector King of Shangqing, Supreme Minister and Grand Marshal, commands the exalted morning master of the Eastern Sea Jade Gate, Qinghua Little Youth Lord, to fast for nine hundred days in the upper palace, the blue-gold covenant of Heaven made, receiving from the Most High Jade Emperor, traveling through the heavens, penetrating void and nothingness, flowing glances through countless ferry crossings, observing boundless, playing widely, circling six countries, revolving nine mysteries, Four Officers inspecting and testing, Upper Origin fixing immortals, Jade Void reflecting down, Turtle Mother descending truth, eight scenes holding reins, Five Elders supporting pavilion, flying immortals racing, eight winds playing smoke, flowing lightning exciting majesty, hundred suns emitting essence, jade wheel shining in void, feather canopy lush and mysterious, golden youths scattering splendor, jade girls brushing dust, myriad spirits bowing, Five Peaks paying homage to truth, various heavens holding grand rites, Ten Directions commanding welcomes, leading countless paths, universally supervising myriad immortals, rank ascending to Supreme Minister, presiding over the exalted morning, truly by the jade emperor’s wondrous will.

The thirty-six heavens’ jade sounds govern life and death in the register, hold immortal titles in the Azure Palace, lead golden names in the mysterious record, oversee white slips in the jade volume, govern the boundless and infinite above, encompass the cavern abyss nine earth myriad spirits below, Five Peaks, Four Extremes, rivers and seas, myriad immortals, up to the thirty-six countries, none not all subject to the Qing Tong. The old rule says in countless kalpas one transmission, the Nine Five’s fate, three dynasties combined, there will be jade name recorded in the imperial register for thirty-six persons, those who see the text and wear these sounds, the nine earths vanish traces, six countries welcome, thirty-six heavens inscribe names, upper palace three primordials descend, naturally becoming immortals.

The mysterious canon enfolds the cavern source, the numinous track towering and hard to discuss, jade bay deep and hard to measure, wondrous transformation hard to repeatedly explain, briefly enumerating one thousandth, roughly marking one ten-thousandth of the true marvel.

---

The inscriptions of the heavens’ inner names, nine earths thirty-six sounds, coexist with the Primordial Beginning, void and numinous establishing titles, expressing natural names, manifesting in the nine mysteries, flowing and releasing foreign lands’ thirty-six sounds. Thus Heaven and Earth each have thirty-six divisions; Heaven has thirty-six heavenly kings to correspond to the thirty-six countries; Earth has thirty-six earth emperors to correspond to the thirty-six heavens. The heavenly kings and true earth emperors govern immortals; if the scholar does not know the heavens’ inner sounds, then heavenly kings do not receive name, not knowing the underground sounds, earth emperors cannot extinguish traces, cannot open the immortal path. Those who see the text and receive the secret sounds, heavenly kings’ mysterious mirror, seven saints inscribe chapters, western turtle fixing register, eastern flower writing names, earth emperors extinguishing corpse and traces, nine yin protecting and recommending Shangqing, five spirits reverently guarding, ten realms assisting and welcoming, circulating six countries, pacifying all fierce evils, five weapons crushing and subduing, heavenly demons binding forms, nine years riding void, flying through Shangqing. The true dao is profound and wondrous; do not recklessly declare; lightly revealing precious sounds, the seven ancestors charge responsibility, body perishes, three paths and five sufferings, countless kalpas unrecoverable; upper true ones act cautiously.

---

The heavenly kings often on eight festival and new moon days roam boundless, traverse cloud chambers, roam freely in Jade Clarity, glance through the ten directions, above the bright rosy clouds, often chanting the heavens’ inner sounds flying mysterious chapters, celebrating heavenly truth, rejoicing divine robes, jade resonance clear and bright, jade rhyme harmonizing sound. On these days, the Five Elders float in position, nine emperors attend the pavilion, Four Officers inspect and test, Five Emperors guard spirits, myriad true ones sing together, myriad immortals pay respect to the sound, three lights pause radiance, seven primordials shine bright, mountains and seas calm waves, heavens solemn and pure, eight strands scatter splendor, Four Emperors brush dust, numinous wind raises incense, green mist issues essence, heavenly origin dark and still, jade void containing joy, bright and clear high pavilion, distant vast desert, penetrating the void into subtlety, circulating endlessly. Those who obtain the dao, form friendship with the emperor, diligently chant its chapters, rank equal to immortal king, virtue equal to the heavens, lifespan equal to the three lights.

---

All who study the upper immortal dao, aspiring to ascend Jade Clarity, revering the emperor with rites, but do not know the thirty-six heavens’ sounds and flying mysterious chapters, then the thirty-six heavenly kings do not receive name, only diligent effort in vain, Heaven does not send truth, Four Officers do not respect, Five Emperors do not welcome, heavenly demons invade truth, ultimately failing to become immortal. If one wishes to fly through the mysterious void, roam the Five Peaks, but does not know the nine earths thirty-six earth emperors’ inner names, then nine yin do not extinguish corpse traces, nine earths do not erase traces, only labor in the dark mountains, hoping to fly but sinking instead.

To practice this dao, on each eight festival and new moon day, bathe and fast purely, enter the room and burn incense, pay homage to the heavens, face north, knock teeth thirty-six times, softly chant:

“I, servant Jiazi, yearn for gods and immortals, on the eight festival days, pay homage to the heavenly sovereign, wish to ascend brightness, ride the void and descend smoke, fly beyond Jade Clarity, roam the heavens, middle wish to transform form, summon five spirits, ascend the moon gate, gaze upon eight steeds, stone scene water mother, jade embryo flying root, long wear vermilion sun, coexist with light, lower wish four extremes, grant me words, western flower guards, command golden morning, carry and lead Five Elders, eight scenes together in pavilion, celebrate union, five wishes unfold, obtain as wished, body harmonizes with nature, true spirit descends, bestow ascent to upper immortal.”
