### Supreme Clarity Primordial Transformations Precious Truth Supreme Scripture

The Supreme Clarity treasured text, founded at the beginning of the Nine Heavens, all arises naturally, coexisting with qi. The Three Luminaries shine in unison, manifesting above the Nine Heavens, within the boundless void. Sometimes it weaves flying mysterious purple qi, forming numinous script—celestial writings wondrous and subtle, their strokes twisting and turning, characters each a square of ten zhang, difficult to trace or explain. Unless one is a True King of the Nine Heavens, none can fathom their meaning or sound.

Above the True Kings of the Nine Heavens, in the first year of the Void Origin, the Supreme Being of the Mysterious Capital commanded the Supreme Truth to cast gold into tablets. The assembly of sages, illuminated in righteous meaning, inscribed the highest secret formulas, compiling spiritual chapters. The Jade Emperor added his annotations, carving tablets into chapters. The order of reverence and submission is arranged with ranks and sequences, prohibitions and categories—all revealing the subtle intentions of the exalted saints. Sealed above the Nine Heavens, within the Great Palace’s jade chambers, guarded by the Western Splendor Jade Maidens and the White Spirit Palace’s Golden Dawn Purple Youth.

The Western Tortoise Mountain, also called Dragon Mountain, is the root knot of the Nine Heavens, the abyssal treasury of myriad qi. It lies at the northwest corner of Heaven, encircling four hundred thousand li, its height contiguous with the Jade Clarity realm. To the southeast, it connects with the rosy mists of Yang, upheld by the gate of the Divine Tiger of the Azure Palace; to the northwest, it joins the cold caverns’ wilds, opening to the celestial court of the Golden Pavilion immortals; southward, it reaches the land of the Great Elixir’s floating pear, where qi harmonizes with the light of the Yang cavity; northward, it points to Gouchen, intersecting the floral canopy, where qi treads the vast numinous; at the center lies the summit of Wind-Interchange Mountain, directly aligned with the Jade Capital’s eight-reaching expanse.

The sky spans thirty thousand li, all walls wrought of gold, gates fashioned from jade, golden terraces and jade towers, twelve divine palaces. Above them is the Hall of Natural Flowing Essence, the Purple Pavilion of Golden Splendor, the chamber of jade and precious stones, adjoining nine caverns’ grottoes. Purple clouds of self-born qi rise, interlaced with phoenix patterns, nine colors cascading in formation. Cliffs sprout purple laurels, ridges flourish with jade forests, coral forms the branches, jade roots the trunks. Lofty trees bear fruit, red infants with white rings, three blossoms gleam in vermilion light, their fragrance flowing sweetly into the Great Mystery. Eight airs fan the storm winds, jade flutes sing in the void, dragons roar in cloud towers, phoenixes whistle across peaks. Venomous beasts in myriad forms, serpents stretching a thousand zhang, divine halls majestic, cloud immortals thronging, the primal pavilion towering—each form exuding nectar. This is the wondrous transformation of the Primordial Origin, the spiritual root of Heaven’s Origin.

In the Hall of Golden Splendor, above the northern window, self-born purple qi condenses into mysterious script, characters each a square of ten zhang, radiating rays of brilliant light. The celestial writings are wondrous and subtle, impossible to fully discern. The Nine Heavens Elder, in the first year of the Supreme Celestial, purified in the Cloud Palace, feasted at Tortoise Mountain, carved golden tablets, compiled the mysterious script, explained its latent blockages, unfolded its spiritual sounds, recording it as the Tortoise Mountain Elixir Sovereign’s Flying Mysterious Purple Script.

On the first day of the first month of the Kaihuang era, the Queen Mother of the West rode the void, drifting in spirit, roaming the Nine Skies. In quiet meditation at Tortoise Mountain, she ascended the Hall of Natural Flowing Essence, Purple Pavilion, Golden Splendor, and Jade Hall, toured the northern window, bowed to the mysterious script, gazed at the cliffs contemplating the spirit, her heart yearning for the Supreme Truth. At that moment, a wondrous response awakened her inner vision; her red heart made manifest. Suddenly, a heavenly True Great God appeared, bearing sun and moon, his neck adorned with a round light, accompanied by a host of immortal feathered umbrellas, riding a flying chariot of purple clouds through the Nine Essences soaring skyward. He knelt before the Queen Mother, saying:

"I am the Phoenix Officer of the Nine Heavens, leader of the Immortal Kings, surname Supreme Mysterious, styled Enlightened. By command of the Primordial Heavenly King, I bring the Nine Heavens’ golden script with purple characters, azure gold, cinnabar, and yellow writings, descending to bestow upon the Queen Mother. I confer the title Western Origin Nine Spirits Supreme True Immortal Mother, enfeoffing her over the Western Tortoise Mountain. Also granted is a plain script scroll, the Supreme Truth Primordial Birth Transformations Original Record, overseeing the immortal registry, inheriting the Jade Clarity. Further, a blue jade tablet is given, along with the phoenix robe of the Nine Heavens, flying blue feathers, the morning infant’s jade crown, phoenix cloud sandals, the divine phoenix’s purple wheel flying umbrella with twenty-four chariots, and five-colored banners commanding the spirit’s festival. Additionally, seven hundred golden dawn jade maidens of the Upper Palace guard the Immortal Mother, managing the Hall of Flowing Essence, Purple Pavilion, Golden Splendor, and Jade Hall. She ascends thrice monthly to Jade Clarity, feasts again on Kunlun, and inspects the assembly of immortals. Thus the True Great God completes his teaching and returns to the Jade Palace."

The Immortal Mother then received her mandate, took her seat, announced a fast in the Jade Hall, and commanded her attendants—Prince Deng, Dong Shuangcheng, and others—to receive the golden script, purple characters, blue jade tablet, azure gold cinnabar imperial writings, the Supreme Truth Primordial Birth Transformations Original Record, and the Flying Mysterious Purple Script, four items in all, sealed with the Elixir Sovereign’s emblem, stored within the chamber of precious jade. She ordered thirty golden dawn jade maidens and thirty purple dawn jade youths to guard the spiritual script. Following the old three heavens’ order of reverence and submission, she reported to the Five Emperors, Five Sacred Mountains, Spirit Mountains, Rivers, and Seas’ rightful gods, commanding that each month on five days the names of students be reported, their merits and demerits distinguished and ranked accordingly.

The Immortal Mother often, on the eight seasonal festivals and five days each month, feasted in the Cloud Palace. At those times, she visited the Five Sacred Mountains, surveyed the river sources, and toured the eight extremes. At such moments, the five stars emerge in division, sun and moon pause their light, a hundred yang energies spark lightning, flowing gold shines with essence. The heavenly spirits lead the way, the Five Elders wield banners, the Immortal Mother rides a nine-colored chariot, purple clouds flying wheels, accompanied by five thousand celestial jade maidens and youths. The females ride phoenixes, the males mount dragons, all adorned in flying immortal feathered robes, each holding splendid banners, playing pipes, flutes, and drums. A hundred harmonies blend, phoenixes sing, dragons roar, clouds surge, brilliant light intermingles, the Three Luminaries merge in brightness. Purple youths scatter incense to dispel filth, divine consorts scatter blossoms to nourish truth. The Heavenly Balance sounds its banners, purple smoke veils the empty court, jade light flows through the vast space, divine transformations awe the myriad spirits. At such times, the six heavens obey the mandate, all malevolent forms are bound, demons lose their sight, the sky clears and the air is pure. This is the wondrous vision of the exalted immortals, the profound spirit of the Elixir Sovereign’s cavern.

## Tortoise Mountain Elixir Sovereign Flying Mysterious Purple Script

Flying mysterious purple qi condenses the spiritual root, the framework of jade void governing myriad gods. In the void it flourishes naturally, above stand twelve towering transmissions. The jade tower gleams radiantly with cloud light, flowing essence purple pavilion with golden veranda. The jade hall shines brilliantly with eight terraces, within emerges the azure gold nine spirits immortals. The Elixir Sovereign True Mother is titled Essence Extension, flying blue feathered unicorn, holding the spirit banner, five-colored commanding demons, facing the imperial sovereign. Holding the talisman register at the birth gate, chewing moon, biting sun, sipping jade spring. The net of separation emits radiance, refining the five souls, filling inside and overflowing the crimson mansion with joy. Golden light shines brightly, form perfectly round, entering from the north, into golden chaos. Only the Enlightened understands these words. On the tenth day of the fifth month, the northern origin carves the imperial canopy leading the immortal lord. Purple qi circles left with the Dipper’s motion, passing through twenty-eight constellations, finally returning atop the golden gate. Truly the Elixir Sovereign inspects myriad immortals, those who comprehend this secret add diligent refinement. Concealed in form and thought, each division is precise, wondrous scenes respond, capturing essential writings. Three years ensure preservation and longevity, nine years ascend the void donning feathered skirts. Phoenix robes lightly soar to Dragon Mountain, bowing and looking upon the nine spirits, paying homage to the Jade Morning.

The Southern Pole Supreme Origin Lord said: This is the script of purple qi flying mysteriously, carved above Western Tortoise Mountain, above the northern window of the Hall of Flowing Essence, Purple Pavilion, Golden Splendor, Jade Hall. The Nine Heavens Elder has observed this chapter, recording it as the Tortoise Mountain Elixir Sovereign Flying Mysterious Purple Script. The Queen Mother of the West always treasures it secretly; its meaning is profound and obscure, all are the wondrous rhythms of the Nine Heavens. It has no immortal name, none may glance upon its chapters. Those who obtain it are all recorded in the Nine Heavens’ registers, titled Tortoise Mountain.

The Nine Heavens Elder said: To cultivate the dao, one regularly on the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, eleventh, and twelfth months—ten months in the year; on the third, fifth, ninth, fifteenth, and twenty-fifth days of each month, five times monthly—fasts and chants the mysterious script once. After midnight, when dew appears in the courtyard, gazing up at the Northern Dipper’s floral canopy, purple cloud qi flows from the Dipper’s left thread, passing through the twenty-eight constellations, returning to the golden gate. If one’s inner sky is dark and lightless, one should silently recite and inwardly contemplate as per the method above, making each division clear. When finished, bow to the purple clouds four times, knock teeth three times, and offer the prayer:

"Heaven is bright and clear at night, the secluded void reveals truth, flowing clouds linger, golden splendor lifts four veils, the Elixir Sovereign spreads radiance, spirit flies the purple pavilion. Tonight the array opens, azure gold grants immortality, fulfill my highest wish, embody and respond to nature, bind the fate of moonlight, protect the year and day’s root, the Three Spirits unite with the luminaries, forever halting at Dragon Mountain, in the secret clear night. Please as spoken." 

Afterwards, inhale the purple qi through twenty-eight throat passages and hold. Practicing this for three years, signs of divine truth will descend upon the sleeping mat. The body will have purple qi, illuminating a form; the Nine Heavens’ script name will surely ascend to immortality.

The Nine Heavens Elder said: The celestial script is layered in myriad folds, each discussing its wondrous secret. Such a matter is sufficient to summon the spiritual truth descending, spreading wings through the Nine Skies, soaring to the Jade Clarity, feasting in the Cloud Palace. Without this wondrous method, even the Queen Mother of the West would not keep it secret within her robes, nor fully understand its prohibitions.

The Supreme Origin Lord said: Heaven has clouds of forbidden qi, affecting the divisions of sun, moon, and five stars. In their domains, all have those who harmonize with the dao, becoming lords of immortality. When such omens appear, their signs become visible.

The Nine Heavens Elder said: Upon seeing such clouds, follow the script’s rites and prayers; it need not be on ordinary days. Diligently attend to it; when the cloud descends, ascend and gather. It is fitting to seal it in the heart, not lightly revealing to others. If the dao leaks, the spirit disperses, and immortals cannot be moved.

## Primordial Bestowal to the Queen Mother of the West of the Azure Gold Cinnabar Elixir Jade Script

The Most High Primordial announces to the spiritual ancestors of the Nine Heavens’ vast void. The Queen Mother of the West, named Wanqin, embodies the qi of the Nine Spirits of the Sovereign Heaven, blending the essence of Western Gold’s soul, forming the purple cloud’s flesh and bone. She refines the sun’s essence radiance, exhales and inhales the seven luminaries’ splendor, harmonizes with the morning glow and consumes the phoenix marrow of the sun, inhales the moon’s essence and orchid brain, condenses the jade root and golden treasury, forms the cinnabar body, entwines eight purple hearts, manifesting in the Elixir Sovereign’s wondrous diagram, prominently displayed in the imperial pavilion, resting in the spiritual mountain, ashes of the heart in Supreme Clarity, merits aiding myriad beings, grace overflowing life, holding the festival’s season alone, enduring through kalpas. Therefore, the Most High curved flower Primordial bestows upon her. Because Wanqin possesses the virtue of golden truth, she is conferred the title Meditation Western Origin Nine Spirits Supreme True Immortal Mother, Azure Gold Cinnabar Elixir. She is enfeoffed to govern Tortoise Mountain, overseeing the original records, following the reverence and submission of the blue jade tablet with golden script and jade characters. Given the Nine Heavens’ phoenix robe, flying blue feathers, morning infant jade crown, phoenix cloud sandals, divine phoenix purple wheel flying umbrella with twenty-four chariots, five-colored staffs and banners commanding the spirit’s festival, flowing gold fire bells lighting the night, demon-destroying jade seals of the Nine Heavens’ imperial edicts, guarded by seven hundred golden dawn jade maidens of the Upper Palace Western Splendor. She manages the Hall of Flowing Essence, Purple Pavilion, Golden Splendor Palace of the Western Tortoise Mountain, ascending thrice monthly to Jade Clarity, feasting again on Kunlun, inspecting the assembly of immortals, the Five Sacred Mountains, Rivers, Seas, and Ten Directions’ spiritual officials—all under her comprehensive command, reporting accordingly. All rituals and ceremonies follow the ancient classic of the Jade Terrace Great Possession, the three heavens’ true text.

## Implementing the Blue Jade Tablet with Golden Script and Jade Characters

The blue jade tablet with golden script and jade characters, the Azure Gold Cinnabar Elixir inscription, all originate from the reverence and submission order of the Nine Heavens’ Great Possession Palace. They all form the high mysterious void cavern natural chapter, verifying the office of the Supreme True High Saint, not given to beginners. The Golden Pavilion’s Eastern Splendor and other palaces also have rituals to summon beginners to fly as immortals. These too come from the Great Possession’s order, differing only in rank and hierarchy. Unless one has a name in the Nine Heavens’ registers, one never sees these chapters. Those who see the writings carve tablets for future lives, list diagrams in the imperial registry, destined to become gods and immortals, thus inscribed in the spiritual order. On the day the dao is accomplished, the True Spirit will descend again, receiving the tablet’s inscription.

The Southern Pole Supreme Origin Lord said: The golden script and jade characters are carved on blue jade tablets or blue jade boards. The tablet measures nine inches and nine fen in length, two inches and four fen in width, inscribed with golden thread characters. Two jade youths attend the tablet, managing incense and inspection. According to the Four Extremes’ bright regulations, within one hundred years there will be such a person, passing on the transmission.

The Southern Pole Supreme Origin Lord said: Jade is not something worldly people can use. If one is named among the registers and sees the writings, one may carve them on blue wood tablets, inscribing with golden thread characters, storing them in blue brocade pouches, burning incense and offering worship for nine years. Naturally, the True Spirit will descend to bestow the jade tablet.

The Southern Pole Supreme Origin Lord said: The Primordial Birth Transformations Original Record is born together with the Nine Qi Primordial Cavern. The Most High Jade Emperor, the Supreme Saint Emperor True, all form from the primordial cavern’s qi to make their forms and names. Their attire and crowns all arise from the Nine Heavens’ Great Possession reverence and submission rituals. Their hometowns and titles also arise naturally. Heaven has the qi of eight assemblies, the four transformations’ cycles, governing the jade void’s framework, dividing principle between yin and yang, mysterious transformations managing beginnings, completing the birth of myriad beings. The Most High assembly of saints transforms form and scene, all following the four seasons’ changes, obeying the cycles and commands, with transformations and shifts, without aging, infinitely enduring. Thus it is said: the dao has no constant name—this is what it means. The Queen Mother’s virtue responds to the high mysterious, thus the Primordial bestows the title Elixir Sovereign, mysteriously granting a plain script original record scroll, to be given to later holy immortals, knowing the Primordial dao’s natural formation, with qi of transformations. Those who see its chapters are recorded in the Nine Heavens’ immortal registers, inscribed in the cinnabar terrace, adding diligent thought. Within nine years, they may enter the true chamber, following the four seasons’ transformations, soaring through the Nine Heavens.

The Southern Pole Supreme Origin Lord said: The Supreme Clarity dao’s high mysterious treasured scripture uses stored thought as response, swallowing qi as meeting. Once one comprehends its chapters, one should understand the stored thought of the Primordial transformations’ image, knowing its form, color, light, qi, and script’s four-season changes. One will arrive without speaking, closing eyes without words, qi gathering without effort. If not within ten years one sees the spirit, not within ten months qi fills. Later students and sages may diligently refine their thoughts; then the mysterious void may be named, and the path to immortals opened.

The Southern Pole Supreme Origin Lord said: Whoever cultivates the path of the upper immortals, thinking spirit and true mind, taking qi and swallowing fluids, yet does not know the Primordial’s title, the four seasons’ transformations, changing light, root of qi—only closing eyes in the vastness, empty swallowing without thought—how can spirit truth descend? How can qi and fluids fill? Gazing at faces and eyes, there is obscurity; how much more in the vastness without distinguishing form and qi? Such is wasted effort in sleep and breath, useless in empty chanting.

## Supreme Clarity Primordial Birth Transformations Original Record

The Primordial Sovereign Elder, qi of the Primordial Jade Void, named Yan Shiyin, styled Observer of No Awakening, form length ninety million zhang. In spring’s third month, he wears the crown of nine qi flowing essence purple radiance, robes of nine lights brocade, body adorned with nine-colored seamless natural ribbons, belt of six mountain fire jades, always riding clouds of blue and green, seated on nine-colored lions, shining brilliantly in the upper clarity of the jade void. His thought shrinks to nine inches and nine fen.

In summer’s third month, the Primordial Sovereign Elder transforms into one body with nine heads, length seven thousand zhang, wearing a nine-colored cloud crown, robes of cinnabar brocade with a hundred changing lights, belt with nine immortal forged swords, riding clouds of cinnabar and purple, seated on nine-colored dragons, radiance flowing in the jade void’s purple clouds. His thought shrinks to nine inches.

In autumn’s third month, he transforms into one body with nine phoenix heads, length five thousand zhang, robes of nine-colored striped tiger skin, riding seven-colored clouds, radiant and interlaced, above Supreme Clarity, thought shrinks to seven inches and seven fen.

In winter’s third month, he transforms into blue-black two-colored light, vigorous as the moon’s soul, reversing the jade void’s qi, further refining the primordial essence. His thought returns to the original true form.

To cultivate the Primordial’s path, one should on the day of the beginning of spring, bathe and enter the chamber, face east, bow nine times to the Primordial Sovereign Elder, then turn north, knock teeth nine times, think on the Sovereign Elder’s forms following the four seasons, above Supreme Clarity in the Golden Phase Palace, Jade Heaven Mansion, Eight Bright Villages of True Stability, turning true downwards, entering the Hall of Manifest Illumination. Softly pray:

"Sovereign opens truth, nine paths unite in brightness, transforming and refining void and nothingness, penetrating Supreme Clarity, dividing form and transforming scenes, four cycles following birth, I enjoy its truth, merging with the true spirit, internally binding jade immortals, externally entwining eight darknesses, eight scenes supporting wings, guiding the cinnabar carriage, riding clouds and smoke, steering Supreme Clarity, flying in cloud chambers, paying homage to the imperial capital."

Finished, inhale nine qi and stop. One who knows the Primordial transformations’ form, secret names, will live nine hundred years. Cultivate for nine years, commune with spirits, then can transform scenes and fly through the great void.
