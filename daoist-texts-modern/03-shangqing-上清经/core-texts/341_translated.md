### Scripture of the Seven Sacred Mysterious Records of the Jade Emperor of Shangqing, Returning Heaven to the Nine Heavens

The Supreme Scripture of the Jade Emperor of Shangqing, Seven Sacred Mysterious Records, Returning Heaven to the Nine Heavens, is the upper scripture whereby the Most High Sacred Sovereign, at the inception of the Nine Profound Energies’ establishment of qi, divides the ethereal and numinous. When yin and yang are fully revealed, the Nine Primordials harmonize in resonance. The Nine Emperors command the spirits, gathering at the Pavilion of Radiant Clouds.

Thus, the Most High Sacred One, bearing the jade tablet of the Purple Void and its attendant spirits, returns in pairs through the cinnabar heavens and the jade wheel, ascending the nine layers of the sevenfold reflected vermilion palace. He lingers above the bright rosy clouds, wandering amidst the desolate nine voids. The celestial origin is obscure and sluggish, the three luminaries merge their light, streaming essence shines through the void, eight gatherings and four penetrations intertwine true accord. He whistles and chants the Great Nothingness, the mysterious beginning reflects brightness, the celestial scene unfolds and spreads, rivers and seas lie in tranquil waves, eight winds lift the wheels, drifting smoke fills the dragon pavilion, floating images rise in the nine mysteries.

Golden immortals wield halberds, the four officers hold banners, the five emperors’ spiritual officials and billions of spirits fly mounted on qilin and feathered steeds, fully guarding the celestial truth. The Western Flower Jade Maiden and the Golden Dawn Spirit Child shine with cloud-like grace beside the jade pavilion, bearing immortal countenance within the orchid chamber, scattering numinous incense to dispel filth, waving floral essence with the whisk. Dragons dart and race within the purple pavilion, poisonous beasts brandish claws at the jade gates, golden wings stroke feathers in the jade forest, spiritual cranes fly and chant amidst the clouds.

The Western Consort beats the rhythm, heavenly maidens play the luo zheng, dragons roar and tigers howl, phoenixes dance and phoenixes sing, the four true ones harmonize in chorus, eight sounds blend in unison, cloud chimes ring clear and bright, startling the Three Pure Ones. Flying songs and mysterious melodies fill the vast music of the empty court, fragrant clouds veil the rosy glow, spiritual winds scatter the true, floral light intermingles and shines, the three candles merge in brightness.

At this time, the Most High Supreme Dao Sovereign wears a nine-colored silk cape, robes adorned with flying frost pearls, a crown that changes a hundred times in an instant, a sword girded with morning light and sun bells nurturing extension, a jade seal and phoenix emblem hanging from a flowing golden belt shining in the void. The seven essences stir the boundless, riding the azure mist through the nine spirits and eight scenes on a cloud carriage, accompanied by thirty thousand flying immortals under feathered canopies in the mulberry forest and purple void. The nine clouds manifest, heaven tilts its light, celestial soldiers lead the way, six divisions sharpen their blades, lightning bolts raise essence, four bright ones support the spirit and open the path, the five elders communicate the passage, flying banners mark the jade road, streaming brilliance clears the heights, ascending to the nine layers of the sevenfold reflected vermilion palace.

The Dao Sovereign arranges seats, the nine emperors rejoice together, the three true ones harmonize, the seven sacred ones share delight, heavenly music rings clear and smooth, the Most High rejoices. The mysterious heart fills the imperial tablet, flying brushstrokes flourish in celebratory smoke, the divine spirits bustle, virtue is empty and embodies mystery, dragon patterns shine in the vast abyss, clouds blaze in the nine heavens, lofty appearances are purified in orchid jade, golden essence issues forth from the jade spring. The seven records are arranged in the upper register, clearly carved in hidden chapters, condensed with deep brushwork, turning the stagnant wheel, gathering the five images, assembling the highest truth. This is the supreme and lofty transmission of the revealed transformation, to spread teachings to all directions.

Thus, the seven sacred ones compose the chapters of the upper mystery, gathering them into numinous writings, commanding the Turtle Mother to inscribe the brush, the Great One to sweep the mat, the heavenly consort to attend with incense, the Jade Flower to hold the cloth. The cinnabar script and purple characters are carved on white silver, secret numinous rhymes are bound in jade chapters, titled with the azure register of attainment, entrusted to the Five Elders, the highest true immortals of the Left Capital, stored in the Purple Bud Jade Chest, sealed with the chapter of command. Three hundred jade boys and jade girls scatter flowers to attend the spirit. The seven sacred ones each hold one passage, the Western Turtle fixes the records, the Eastern Flower verifies the names, calling upon the Five Sacred Mountains and myriad immortals.

Later disciples who present the three origins’ tablets and receive the register of the Azure Palace, annually selecting seven times, listing names of Shangqing, all are carved and annotated in the mysterious chart, becoming the highest true of peace. This is the celestial sincerity and mysterious clarity of the Most High Sacred One, the bright virtue united with the three origins.

Therefore, the Most High commands the record, inscribed in jade script, mysterious contracts and dark chants, the radiance of the heavens fresh within, profound and lingering rhyme, the wheel turns responding to mystery, high models surpass the Three Realms, elixir scenes rise among the highest true, inscribed on white tablets, recorded in azure script, the mysterious chart is lofty and subtle, not to be expressed by brush and ink alone. Only roughly one-thousandth is recorded, briefly marking the distant traces of attainment.

The Returning Heaven Nine Heavens White Tablets and Azure Registers, the Most High Sovereign received from the nine voids, bind the flying mysterious purple qi into natural characters. The mysterious record names the path of later disciples’ attainment, the numinous sounds and rhymes harmonize, the jade bright receives the truth. Sometimes by script, sometimes by hidden sound, the upper and lower four gatherings all express the mysterious name of empty birth, carved and written in the hall of vast spirits.

The ancient text had one hundred thousand jade words, characters without fixed class, rhymes without fixed tone, none but the Most High Sacred could comprehend their meaning. After accumulating seven thousand years, inscribed in the chamber of Kunlun, the northern cave’s source. Characters a square of ten feet, the text splendid and brilliant, four sides hanging rays, the void born serene and majestic, as if existing and not, streaming purple qi brushing away filth, golden essence cold-refined polishing the text. Through countless kalpas, the characters remain clear.

On the seventh day of the ninth month of the first year of the Central Sovereign, the seven sacred ones gathered their spirits, purified in the long palace, forging a golden-blue alliance with heaven. The veiled mother and the sorrel steed received the numinous text. The Most High understood its twists and stagnations, the seven sacred ones comprehended its wondrous sounds, recording it as the chapter of attaining the Dao by returning heaven to the nine heavens, carved on white silver tablets, bound with flying azure script, stored in a cloud brocade pouch, sealed with the chapter of command, entrusted to the Five Elders, the Left Capital of the Immortal City, in charge of recording the jade palace.

According to the four poles’ bright methods, transmitted once every myriad kalpas, examined by the four officers’ laws, punished by the five emperors’ divine soldiers. Named the Participating Mysterious Tablets, those who obtain this text lightly leak it, calamity destroys nine clans, examined by seven mysteries, their own body perishes, long held accountable by the ghost officials. Though bearing the mysterious name, they cannot enter immortality.

---

The Seven Sacred Mysterious Records Returning Heaven Upper Text, sometimes harmonizing rhymes, sometimes cross-referencing categories, sometimes using the upper and lower four gatherings to form characters and sounds, sometimes marking the true taboo, sometimes combining singular and plural, all arise from the mysterious ancient cave. The Most High composes and collects to clarify the numinous text. Later disciples name and consult its chapters, receiving the precious secret, naturally becoming transcendent immortals.

Yet there are the six harmonies and the seven harms: treasure it and it unites, neglect it and it perishes. Those with divided bodies must diligently cultivate sincerity, maintain long fasts and spiritual abundance, seek distant secluded mountains, burn incense and perform rites, recite scriptures morning and evening, abandon all distracting thoughts, focus the heart on the Supreme Truth, and strive to receive mysterious descent, soaring by day.

All later disciples, whether their name is not inscribed on the mysterious tablets yet possess the precious scripture, all have in past lives great virtue and abundant branches shading them, reaching their own degree. Or their body has dark功, their will surpasses the crowd, single-hearted and earnest, deeply revering the Jade Emperor, with the four poles reporting, the Five Sacred Mountains recording their name, encountering scripture masters and receiving precious texts. If they are diligent and do not violate the seven harms, true beings descend to grant their true texts, annotating the upper mysterious records, and also become immortals in seven years.

All who behold the Most High Sacred Mysterious Records’ text bear the mysterious name with the division of flying immortals, inscribed on the images of future lives, inversely annotated in the mysterious void chapters. Having received human nature, the Azure Palace selects names, guarded by the four officers, interpreted by the five emperors, bound and stored in the Jade Void, rooted in purple cords. Their bones emit strange light, their raised form matches immortality, the four officers secretly descend, the yin receives the precious text, the Great One fixes the register, controls fate and years, the soul is firm and spirit secure, the six stomachs bind truth, myriad gods all present. They succeed in becoming upper immortals, cultivating for seven years, naturally descending spirits, riding the void and soaring.

---

The Most High Sacred Sovereign said: Whoever obtains the Seven Sacred Mysterious Records Returning Heaven to the Nine Heavens, though not yet ascending, all have their names selected by the Azure Palace, reported to the Five Sacred Mountains, entrusted to the spirit officials of the mountains, rivers, and seas to guard their body. Twelve jade boys and twelve jade girls attend the spirit text, reverently carrying the scripture and practicing the truth. This mysterious upright response assembly, the principle accords with nature. The Most High always uses inverse annotation of the true register, ranks them as immortal ministers. One must be fully prepared in the dao, the four true ones visit the chamber, descend the cloud carriage, commanding the day to ascend morning, the patterns of bowing and raising follow rank to advance immortality.

This dao is remote and subtle, not to be glimpsed or heard by common learning. Those who receive it must keep it secret, do not recklessly proclaim.

### The Most High’s Hidden Record of the Six Harmonies, Fixed Tablets, and Immortal Ascension Methods

The Most High Sovereign said: On the first day of the first month, the third day of the third month, the fifth day of the fifth month, the seventh day of the seventh month, the ninth day of the ninth month, and the eleventh day of the eleventh month — these six days in the year are when heavenly virtue aligns. The Seven Sacred fix the tablets, the Five Emperors record the names, the Western Turtle engraves the records, the Eastern Flower composes the chapters.

On these days, the celestial origin celebrates in harmony, the four officers array their soldiers, the Most High displays the canopy, the Jade Void returns in pairs, the Nine Emperors gird their belts, the Seven Sacred gather spirits, billions of true beings and myriad immortals all float in the golden court, three mornings wing the pavilion, seven origins shine bright, heaven and earth are pure and falling, the ten realms are solemn and clear.

The Nine Heavens’ emperors dispatch true inspectors, the Most High Seven Sacred send fixed record left immortals, the Western Turtle Queen Mother commands the Five Elders, the immortal elders of the West, the Eastern Flower’s azure youth leads the immortal jade attendants, each division’s flying immortals roam in wheels and feathered steeds, journeying the ten heavens and five sacred mountains, inspecting the underworld’s origin for those who have attained the dao, wandering immortal officials, and later disciples’ names recorded in the tablets.

Those whose bodies have not ascended, or whose mysterious records lack names but who cultivate diligently, their hearts crowned by the Jade Void, upper sensing the Jade Emperor, reported by the Four Poles, all with learning bodies, on these days purify with fasting and incense, abandon all strange thoughts, wish to unite with the heavenly heart, preserve sincere thoughts and bitter remembrance, cultivate the numinous texts. The Five Emperors record on white tablets, the plain register records names, then the Four Poles descend and bestow the highest truth. In seven years, one will attain to ride the void and ascend the morning heavens.

On these days, if one lightly disrespects heavenly treasures, leaks the mysterious texts, violates the seven harms, the four officers correct and punish. Those with white tablets’ names are all recorded in the azure register, returned to ghost officials. Without prior tablets recorded, by chance encountering scripture, the Five Emperors punish with divine soldiers, capturing the seven ancestors, filling the responsibility of river source life and death examination, as clear as the sun.

Therefore, learning requires precision of heart, no need for white tablets or mysterious names. Only secrecy and earnestness will gain immortality.

Selecting those with named bones and nature, climbing mountains to pledge alliance, reporting to the Azure Palace, binding belts and bestowing words. The peaceful wood palace must issue governance, untying the Meng ford, reporting and welcoming the sacred sovereign at Shangqing officials.

Without mysterious name, one cannot consult its upper chapters. Those who obtain it use white tablets to fix numbers, diligently cultivate and practice, maintain long fasts and recite truth for seven years, naturally auspicious signs descend, awakening the child spirit. Then they become masters and sect leaders.

Without this upright, one cannot glimpse or lightly leak or recklessly proclaim. The seven ancestors hold responsibility, climbing the blade mountain, one’s own body perishes, long thanking the river source, unable to enter immortality.

### The Most High Immortal Prohibition of the Seven Harms

All scholars with mysterious records and names, their bodies bearing immortal appearance, naturally accord with truth, but if their hearts are not firm and upright, they suffer the seven defeats and harms.

**First Harm:** Bearing truth but acting falsely, lustful and noisy spirits, wasting fluids and leaking, essence and light drying up, qi scattering and soul dissolving, bones hollow and form wasted, spirits weeping in the desolate mansion, upper hearing at heavenly pass, true immortals journey afar, demons and spirits come to disturb, joining with the dark yin, mysterious records removed, nine prisons bind causes, six heavens intimate, sinking into endless suffering, how can they again attain immortality?

**Second Harm:** Outer form in dao, skin fine and thoughts true, heart harboring yin thieves, cruel and inherently stubborn, wishing others to fail, jealous and envying the worthy, sweet mouth but contrary heart, joyful face but inward anger, judging form’s gain and loss, fond of sowing crime sources, slandering and spying on learning, attacking sect roots, recorded by the Three Officials, marked as evil gate, immortals and true ones abandon, evil ghosts possess, running as shadow, flying able to embody spirit, thus causing crooked and perverse, utmost evil fate, examination full body perishes, soul sinks to nine springs, only bearing mysterious name, how can they preserve nature?

**Third Harm:** Fond of wine and drunkenness, damaging qi and losing spirit, five palaces in chaos, myriad gods startled, soul and spirit scatter, inner and outer decayed spirit, original chamber desolate, red children mourn, true immortals ascend high, demon spirits enter form. Such a form only accumulates sincerity, though having mysterious records, ultimately losing jade name, spirit confined in six palaces, body ashes in dark shadows, seeking extension in this way, years long halted.

**Fourth Harm:** Practice not broad and pure, blaming sect leaders, angry heart and cursing mouth, fond of fighting and competing, anger and joy losing measure, nature unstable, qi agitated and spirit scattered, inner truth flying and bursting, soul leaving and spirit wandering, bringing disaster and illness, lifespan declining, all due to nature. True immortals ascend high, myriad diseases come to harm, though diligent in learning, cannot avoid this calamity, hoping for immortality day long, hellish days lengthen.

**Fifth Harm:** Some see mysterious charts and receive precious scriptures, or encounter spiritual masters who open and bestow divine texts, but do not follow regulations and alliances, form leaks heavenly truth, not passing nine years, stabbing the famous mountains, making Azure Palace have records, Golden Gate binding chapters, then transmitting to people, spreading in the world, lightly leaking true treasures, examination binds their own body, only bearing mysterious name, instead accumulating seven mysteries, immortal dao ascends high, body dies in dark springs, long filling ghost responsibility, myriad kalpas no remission.

**Sixth Harm:** Body walking filth, form and shadow not fragrant, inside no purity and void, outside no orchid fragrance, dao not descending truth, spirit not dwelling chamber, qi disturbed and essence turbid, spirit origin losing light, five gods advance and scatter, red children flying and rising, evil demons come to attack, inner and outer suffer harm. Learning in this way, hopes increase but harm, true immortals ascend high, corpse alone walks, sinking and lost without rescue, how can immortality be attained?

**Seventh Harm:** Eating meat containing blood, killing and harming the mouth’s beauty, foul and fishy filling viscera, harming life and destroying what is not self, true qi disturbed at spirit gate, wandering souls frightened at red children, soul and spirit departing the palace, filth and turbidity entangled in mouth and teeth, immortals and true ones abandon in the clouds, self sinks and lags in the earth’s embrace, only bearing mysterious name imperial tablets, ultimately cannot avoid bodily death.

---

The Most High Sovereign said: The root of learning must urgently guard against the seven harms. Having attained to gaze and see the cave gate, viewing the jade chapters, not violating the seven harms’ prohibitions, one will await spirit descent, ascending by day to the morning.

If externally diligent in learning but internally violating the seven harms, this one will hope for immortality but instead fail, hope to be born but instead perish, hope for good fortune but instead misfortune, hope to fly but instead sink. Spirit immortals roam in the clear heights, right five gods scatter in eight wildernesses, red children wail in the middle chamber, wandering souls mourn in the mysterious void.

Therefore immortal appearance has success and failure, upper learning has seven harms. Those earnest and devoted, thoroughly refine their truth.

---

The Most High Sovereign said: Whoever has jade bones and cinnabar texts, listed on imperial charts, gaining to see the Seven Sacred Mysterious Records. Whoever has golden marrow and purple store, names inscribed on golden tablets, gaining to see hidden writings inner texts. Whoever has divine and wondrous strange hairs, purple embryos and jade cords, names marked Shangqing, gaining to see white tablets and jade chapters. Whoever has flowing essence and purple light, inner reflecting outer spirit, treasure store golden countenance, names inscribed Jade Void, gaining to see azure register texts. Whoever has divine upright response country, jade fetus purple void, names inscribed Eastern Flower, gaining to see seven harms inspection texts.

Without this upright, numinous chapters cannot be recklessly opened, precious texts cannot be casually viewed. Those who see these texts all have mysterious essence accord with immortality, nine years cultivation, able to fly in the mysterious void, ascending Jade Pure.

---

All who receive the Seven Sacred Mysterious Records Returning Heaven to the Nine Heavens white tablets and azure registers texts, disciples and juniors must fast and purify for ninety days or thirty days. Disciples present seven taels of gold, seventy zhang of purple silk, and seven taels of cinnabar, going to the master facing north, reporting to the Most High, pledging heaven and transmitting.

If the master bestows without alliance, lightly leaking precious texts, disciples receive without faith, recklessly opening jade chapters, all suffer the wind blade’s examination, the seven ancestors hold responsibility, three paths and five sufferings, myriad kalpas no remission. The Five Emperors’ divine soldiers constantly correct leaks. Be clearly cautious and faithfully practice.
