# The Most High Nine True Illuminating Methods

### Scripture Name: The Most High Nine True Illuminating Methods. Author unknown, roughly composed during the Eastern Jin and Southern Dynasties. It is a compilation excerpted from the *Great Marvelous Scripture*. Original source: *Orthodox Daoist Canon*, Zhengyi section.

The Most High addressed the celestial emperors, later sage sovereigns, Prime Minister Qingtong, and the True Person of the Supreme Ultimate, saying: All later disciples who behold the Three Caverns’ precious chapters of the Supreme Truth, the secret scriptures of the first day, are known by the name Eastern Flower, inscribed in golden characters as Supreme Clarity. Though they have not yet transcended to soaring heights, holding the reins of the Purple Court, they are all people of ascension and deliverance. Yet, even having seen these texts, if one does not understand the *Nine True Illuminating Methods*—the regulations and rites, the wondrous writings of the Three Caverns, the Most High’s treasured scriptures—they cannot simply open and read at will. The illuminating methods and precious secrets are hidden within the Palace of the Mysterious Capital, inside the Golden Chamber of the Jade Capital, never transmitted to the world. They reveal the profound depths of the Three Caverns, mark the ritual standards of the myriad True Ones, uproot karmic ties confronting the dark officials, and deliver the seven mysteries into the immortal registers. Truly, they encompass the myriad paths, unravel the heavy burdens of the Nine Yins; their marvels can be immediately applied, their methods strictly enforced. Now, therefore, the three ranks of chapters are set forth to assist in promulgating the Three Wonders of the Primordial Spirit’s Marvelous Scripture, to admonish later disciples, so that those diligent and reverent may be warned and cautious in their secret covenant.

The celestial emperors, later sage Nine Mysterious Sovereigns, Prime Minister Qingtong, and the True Person of the Supreme Ultimate bowed and respectfully asked the Most High Heavenly Venerable: “The supreme true highest dharma, lofty, elegant, profound, and clear, surpassing myriad lineages, mysterious, silent, and condensed, wondrously transcending and stirring the profound, with dharma transformations of the three vehicles, threading through countless kalpas—how vast is its measure? Could it still be examined through the Illuminating Methods?”

The Most High replied: “Well spoken, good child. Those later disciples, if not descendants of the Jade Void, born of natural spontaneity, all are immersed in the chaotic currents of the noisy defilement. Their conduct is impure, their nature lacks singular beauty. Though they yearn for the profound depths, their hearts constantly rebel and their actions contradict the path they ride. None escape faults. Faults arise outwardly and extinguish life inwardly. To study under such conditions, how could one not stray far from the truth? If the Three Officials report offenses to the dark bureaus, calamity extends to the seven ancestors, and guilt accumulates upon the body, those who commit such faults but awaken to the existence of the Illuminating Methods’ correction and punishment system, the great sacred transformation, and again permit the method of atonement, then by examining and applying the methods, surely the path to truth will draw near. For scholars without such inspection, their intense thought is in vain, their bitter contemplation yields no benefit. Therefore, the Nine True Three Ranks Illuminating Methods are now set forth, to be granted to later disciples who should become True Persons.”

The emperors, Prime Minister Qingtong, and the True Person of the Supreme Ultimate then withdrew to their chambers in Supreme Clarity, reverently receiving the Primordial Spirit’s Great Marvelous Scripture’s Nine True Methods for inspection, secretly stored in the Golden Treasury and Jade Cabinet, guarded by Jade Boys and Jade Girls numbering three thousand each, attending to the spiritual texts, dispersing incense in the ethereal court, amidst flying dragons and venomous beasts, colossal serpents a thousand fathoms long, clawing at the cloud walls, fully guarding the Jade Gate. Thus, the Ten Great Celestial Saints and Nine Palatial True Immortals, thrice each month, all ascend the Mysterious Palace to receive the Illuminating Methods, bowing before the scripture. Prime Minister Qingtong said: “Those with golden bones and jade marrow, known as participants of the Azure Palace, if they obtain this text, must keep it secret and practice it.” Thus, receiving the rites, mysteriously harmonizing with the supreme canon, applying and regulating accordingly, matching the True Ones’功 (merit), redeeming sins and removing difficulties, resolving karmic knots—all the ancestors of the seven mysteries rejoice, ascending themselves to feast in the Jade Capital.

### Mysterious Capital Nine True Illuminating Methods Supreme Rank Scripture Transmission Chapters

Within seven thousand years, three transmissions may be heard. Guarded by seven thousand Jade Boys and Jade Girls, holding incense and spiritual rites.

The Most High has fully incorporated these texts into the ancient scriptures for practical use. Transmission of illuminating methods strictly follows scripture regulations; omissions incur the same guilt as the supreme rank. Scriptures without talismans bring harm from heavenly demons; talismans without scriptures cause thoughts to lack response, divine truth not manifest. The methods state: none may be practiced singly; single practice incurs the same guilt as the methods. Scriptures and talisman originals both arise from the qi of nature, the chapters of emptiness and nothingness, thus cannot be cultivated alone. Without methods, cultivation will never succeed.

The rightmost Most Mysterious Nine True Illuminating Methods, three ranks, twenty-seven articles, originate from the Most High Spirit Capital’s palace, the Most High’s constant treasured secret, not disclosed to the world. Now the essentials are copied for use, entrusted to later sages, assisting in clarifying the Three Wonders, marked with the Great Abundance Primordial Spirit’s scripture. Those with bones divided and united with immortals may receive and apply these texts, redeem sins and resolve blame, unravel knots and scatter confusion, the Seven Mysteries vanish, within three years true spirit appears in form, merging with you, ascending the Nine Heavens. Lightly revealing the mysterious methods incurs the same guilt as above; only in precious secrecy may they be practiced and revered.

The Mysterious Capital Nine True Chapter states: The transmission of scripture titles within the Nine True Three Ranks Methods began when later sage emperors first wore scriptures, receiving from the Most High Dao Sovereign. The Most High transmitted scriptures from the Three Ranks Illuminating Methods to assist the Three Treasures’ wondrous writings, the supreme true dao scriptures. The application methods, their thirty-one volumes, separate remaining matters and many scripture rites, are all within the *Four Extremes Illuminating Methods*. The Nine True Three Ranks place the three elemental upper chapters in the palace of the Nine Emperors; the Four Extremes govern the four officials, overseeing all nonconformity, correction, and prohibition laws. The Supreme True Illuminating Methods, received by the Supreme Emperor Sovereign, the mysterious chapters of Primordial Heavenly King, the ritual standards of the Supreme Truth, their methods secreted above the Nine Heavens; the Emperor’s royal treasury admonishes the Supreme Truth officials, not practiced in the world. The Nine True Illuminating Methods forbid later disciples; the Four Extremes Illuminating Methods govern the four directions; their essence is profound and penetrating, without golden or jade names, unknown and unheard. Those who obtain this chapter need not study but naturally succeed. The methods forbid sin; seeing methods, knowing to reform, knowing reform incurs no loss to Heaven and Earth; no loss to Heaven and Earth accords with nature; accord with nature gains the supreme supplement to true immortals. Without methods, cultivation will be far from immortality.

The Mysterious Capital Nine True Chapter states: All with utmost will, named participants of the Mysterious Palace, wishing to receive illuminating methods singly, must know the heavenly laws forbid, then receive scriptures, carefully possessing bone division, may first report pledge and receive. Pledge, trust, and ritual items all follow the Three Wonders’ precious scriptures’ numbers, with the same time limits. Must not lightly entrust to the untrue, nor reveal mysterious texts, nor violate method intent; otherwise, body perishes to ghost officials, seven ancestors and parents tread knife mountains and sword trees, for myriad kalpas no release. Otherwise, not following method intent incurs the same guilt as scripture texts; these mutual prohibitions, learners, be cautious.

The Mysterious Capital Nine True Chapter states: All who receive the supreme dharma but do not accept illuminating methods, neglect heavenly prohibitions, guilt accumulates to seven mysteries, tests seize the body. Once knowing to reform, guilt punishes self, resume received teachings; if again offending, tests are heavier. This means bone and fate do not accord, form opposes truth, soul shares ghost rank; none may again begin to cultivate true scriptures. Therefore, now with illuminating methods, awaken the unawakened; once knowing and yet offending, what use is it? Recipients, be cautious.

Dim and obscure, the primordial transformation begins; faint and distant, morning dew scatters. The Great Stillness, Void, and Mystery above. Vast and bright, the Two Instruments divide. Condensing essence embraces the empty embryo, forming transformation and nurturing the void’s vision. Containing essence and profound spirit within, suddenly opening the dark dawn. Beginning to awaken to the urgency of mortal life, fate reverses the Milky Way. Rustling steps roam the void, circling to pay homage to the Jade Capital. Bowing and returning to the Great Nothingness, riding the wind to scatter spiritual incense. Looking up and down the Emperor’s Hall, drifting and soaring with the void. Wondrous chants emit strange sounds, reciting the Supreme True chapters. Flowing through the Four Great Realms, measuring the Ten Heavens without end. The Jade Terrace emits the dark night, divine candles exhale wondrous light. Brilliant jade forest blossoms, sparkling illuminating the jade hall. Emptiness births natural smoke, luxuriant guarding the mysterious thread. Multitudes of True Ones part the skies in praise, treasure canopies rise with the wind. Flying steps chant empty songs, divine singing transforms the dao’s length. Flourishing great transformation rises, abundant dao prospers. Accumulated study responds with the sun,功 (merit) fulfilled entering the great vehicle. Blessings reach all, seven ancestors all ascend. Organizing carriage to Mount Taihua, turning reins to the highest pavilion. Spiritual winds drum the empty cavern, incense flowers ride smoke and scatter. Rustling bows to the spiritual hall, solemn steps traverse the mysterious Milky Way. Clear chanting opens the hidden heart, delivering and crossing difficult karmic roots. Five sufferings timely resolved, fragrance flows to nourish and irrigate. Bright towers stand like cloud nets, flying rosy clouds wing the spiritual carriage. Guiding the trace-free True Ones, gracefully entering the Great Void. Riding emptiness reciting jade chapters, desolate chanting of feathered writings. Broad thoughts universally spread, all blessings are abundant.

### Praise by the Heavenly Emperor Sovereign

The supreme dao arises from empty stillness, mysterious echoes seek yin and form. The Three True Ones’ original source is one, qi transforms and principle returns distinct. The dharma wheel is formless within, drifting and flowing with clear vision. Condensing chapters need no thought, binding qi with mysterious talisman. Spiritual chants emit empty songs, reciting and stepping through the void. Mysterious transformation originally leaves no trace, with trace arises the dao lineage. Roaming the Nine Heavens’ edges, resting carriage in six palaces. Guiding high guests, returning to my Primordial Spirit chamber. Dao flows smoothly within the void, spiritual songs issue from the great void. Form senses the utmost silent court, thought chants rare and subtle communication. Cloud light veils morning radiance, halting brightness shading the Jade Capital. Mysterious dragons need no carriage, rustling stepping through empty soaring. Hands part seven treasures’ blossoms, spiritual winds scatter wondrous incense. Wondrous chants ride the collar and emerge, brilliant opening of jade chapters. Myriad qi mix as one, all returning to the Three Mysterious Beams. Riding heaven without clouds high, gazing afar the Nine Mysteries vast. Flapping wings thinking mysterious reins, hoping to ascend twilight clouds and sky. Accumulated thoughts report spiritual response, hoping to commune with Jade True. Dim and pure Milky Way clear, drifting and turning radiant clouds. The Three True Ones soar upward, holding reins swiftly at Purple Tenuity. Bright chants deliver later bodies, all allowed to ride the scene and fly. Extracting from the Three Paths’ hardships, Nine Mysteries freeing from sorrow and woe.

### Praise by the Supreme Micro Emperor Sovereign

The Supreme True arises from empty cavern, jade nets shining on treasure platform. Circling and paying homage to the Jade Capital, all immortals chant subtle poems. Turning without trace within, empty songs accord with hidden appointments. Crossing bodies ascending heaven, chanting and accumulating blessings’ foundation. Driving reins to the Great Rosy Pavilion, occasionally feasting on radiant clouds. Drifting without boundary, departing and entering the mysterious gate. Mind at ease, dao also smooth, heart elixir and will also divided. Accumulated study renewed daily, chanting my Primordial Spirit texts. Eight scenes move the heavenly carriage, flying dawn flourishing mysterious banners. White canopy rides wind returning, vast entering the Purple Clarity. Wondrous praise of myriad True Ones’ melodies, jade sounds ringing like bells. Extracting and removing Nine Yins’ registers, crossing bodies returning to Southern Court. Blessings flow universally, wondrous transformation all flourishing. Pure and tranquil mysterious dao lineage, bright and shining illuminating great void. Wondrous transformation arises from still darkness, subtle thoughts reach the Three Elemental Palaces. Accumulated thoughts penetrate mysterious void, faintly reaching the supreme dao’s communication. Bowing chants echo mysterious stillness, spiritual singing none do not flourish. Elixir brilliance reflects cloud court, purple smoke shines the jade forest. Radiant seven treasures’ blossoms, sparkling shaking spiritual sounds. Palace and commerce harmonize mutually, wondrous delight leads into the collar. Mysterious chants sow blessings’ fields, broadly delivering boundless hearts.

### Praise by the Later Sage Golden Palace Emperor Sovereign

Vast and indistinct Primordial Beginning Heaven, three symbols mixed into mysterious unity. Rustling, the correct dao arises, vast great vehicle soaring. Six qi return to the correct court, all gathered in the mud pellet chamber. Entering and exiting roaming the Emperor’s Hall, essence shines cloud and sun. Circling and reversing the Milky Way, graceful riding the mysterious seven. Perfect brilliance reflects bright pearls, two lights facing true radiance. Spiritual brilliance opens the new moon meeting, mysterious phenomena join the Fusang. Dark crossing seeking each other, yin flows through the mysterious eight wildernesses. If one can feast on this essence, long may one ride the mysterious thread. Playing in the Nine Mysterious Terrace, resting in the Western Feather Nook. Divine beasts cry in the jade hall, flying phoenixes mutually irregular. Emptiness births natural chants, True Persons sing harmonious tunes. Transforming bodies in kalpa courts, following incense and chanting clear songs. Establish功 (merit) and build blessings’ fields, extracting and crossing later bodies’ nets. Seven mysteries scatter dark palaces, departing and leaving with no difficulty. Flying across and treading sky ridges, soaring wings to the Eastern Flower Palace. Wind and cloud sing within emptiness, jade sounds scatter the jade hall. True Persons chant empty songs, wondrous sounds surpass cloud chambers. Unbinding my natural heart, completing my accumulated功 (merit). Long howling above Nine Mysteries, clear gaze beholds emptiness united. Dragon roars surpass dwelling mansions, phoenix cries at Great Dawn Pavilion. Empty chants leave no residue, mournful sounds ride the wind and scatter. Who can thoroughly understand these chapters, clearly reciting the Primordial Spirit’s praise, to resolve Nine Yins’ faults, extract and cross Seven Mysteries’ hardships.

The True Person of the Supreme Ultimate said: The *Most High Primordial Spirit Cavern Profound Marvelous Scripture* was born together with Primordial; the spiritual texts already exist, all True Ones come to the seat, burn incense and worship scriptures, circling and reciting these twenty-one chapters’ texts to celebrate in the divine court. Jade sounds sharp and clear, penetrating the Nine Heavens; their phrases subtle and profound, wondrous delight alongside; reciting once, myriad spirits awaken, always able to thoroughly study, merging with the Emperor’s truth, resolving heavy karmic debts, extracting Seven Mysteries’ dark palaces, resolving five sufferings of sorrowful souls, delivering bodies upward to heavenly birth. Marvelous indeed, such are these spiritual texts.
