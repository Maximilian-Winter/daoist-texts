### Scripture of the Most High’s True Law of the Three Heavens

Composed by the Little Heavenly King of Pure Emptiness

The True Kings of the Nine Heavens and the Primordial Heavenly King were both born before the primal breath began. Heaven’s light was not yet bright, the dense accumulation had not yet cleared; boundless and vast was the dark abyss, the chaotic great void. For more than seven thousand kalpas, the vast sweat flowed through the dark, until the mysterious radiance first divided. The Nine Breathings were preserved therein, each breathing separated by ninety-nine thousand nine hundred and ninety years. The Azure Youth Lord said: “At that time, there were no years or months. The Nine Breathings already existed, each breathing separated by ninety-nine thousand nine hundred and ninety li; one li equals one year.” The pure breath rose high and clear, the turbid and mixed spread below.

The True Kings of the Nine Heavens and the Primordial Heavenly King, inheritors of the natural lineage, were assigned the titles of the Nine Heavens. Both were born within the Nine Breathings; their qi condensed and took form. The Nine Breathings, mysterious and dense, were formed in the diagram of the Nine Heavens. The sun, moon, stars, and constellations shone forth then, all revolving and cycling within the realm of the Nine Heavens.

Thus appeared the emperors of the Nine Truths. The Azure Youth Lord said: “The Nine Truths are the pure breaths of the Nine Heavens, condensed into the positions of the Nine Palaces. The Upper Truth, Middle Truth, and Lower Truth are born in the highest Pure and Subtle Heaven; this Pure and Subtle Heaven is the clarity of the primal breath. Next, the middle three truths are born in the Heaven of Yu’s Remnants; this Heaven of Yu’s Remnants is the clarity of the original breath. Below are the three truths born in the Third Great Red Heaven; the Great Red Heaven is the clarity of the mysterious breath.”

With the three titles thus clarified, the three primal ladies were born from the breath, taking Heaven as father and breath as mother, thus called the Three Primal Lords of the Great Element. Each was naturally conceived by the breath. Born of the Three Primal Lords, all bear female titles. The Azure Youth Lord said: “The White Elemental Lord is the mother of the Right White Elemental Lord; the Yellow Elemental Lord is the mother of the Yellow Elder Central Lord; the Purple Elemental Lord is the mother of the Left No-Name Lord. They form empty wombs and conceive relying on breath.”

Each was assigned a palace and mansion, and thus the officers of the Supreme Clarity’s garrison were established. Three thousand golden morning jade youths, three thousand western flower jade maidens, served the Three Primal Ladies in the bridal chamber palace.

The Three Dao prospered, each bearing the title of Most High Great Dao Lord. The Most High Great Dao Lord is the emperor of all truths, exalted in rank and pure in breath, thus called Most High. All are descendants of breath inheriting the truth, accumulating rank and receiving titles; there is no single Most High in the primal Heaven. Those who receive the Most High title become lords of myriad spirits, placed in jade palaces and jade halls, dwelling in the Most High, Lords of the Great Dao, commanding the Nine Heavens and next in rank the Eight Directions.

The Eight Directions each have eight emperors, thus the upper Three Heavens have twenty-four emperors, the lords of the Jade Emperor. The Eight Emperors all receive the natural lineage and attain the title of emperor; this is not a responsibility of later scholars. Each then draws upon their inheritance to compose the chapter of the Supreme Emperor, making it a treasured scripture, secreted in the Palace of Jade Clarity to guide later seekers of truth.

By the time of the Yellow Emperor, the people were established and born; later generations arise from the Yellow Emperor. The Yellow Emperor shaped the earth into images and placed them in the vast wilderness. Over three hundred years, five colors changed and transformed; they could speak and converse, each dwelling in one direction. Hence the tribes of Cong, Qin, Di, Yi, Man, and Chai came to be. The five surnames combined virtue, following the natural law, inheriting the breath of the upper truth and thus becoming human. They possessed the cycle of birth and death, the measure of lifespan.

If one’s bone breath is connected to truth, one becomes immortal, able to supplement the upper immortals. Those who act impurely die and return to earth. The sluggish take on the original breath; their five-colored robes and crowns are all born from the original breath, clothed in five-colored garments. The governance of the Six Heavens thus flourished here.

Therefore, the Most High Great Dao Lord was given ghost soldiers to use during the Three Dynasties, driving away evil people. The Azure Youth Lord said: “The Yellow Emperor gave birth to the people, who each began killing and harming without receiving nature’s breath, causing Heaven’s breath to become angry and the three and five to lose their proper course. Thus, the breath of the Six Heavens was used to punish the wicked people.”

Those who practice good deeds with diligence, who meditate on longevity and do not offend the Three Officials, become the seed people and are granted the true scripture. The two breaths separate and unite; the principle of things has its time. Yang nine disperses breath; one hundred and six decides calamities. The Three Dao wax and wane, revolving and giving birth, with the term ending in the years of Renchen and Guisi.

The Azure Youth Lord said: “The great yang nine and the great one hundred and six are each nine thousand nine hundred years; the lesser yang nine and lesser one hundred and six are each three thousand three hundred years.” The Six Heavens received their titles by the Zhou dynasty, already three scriptures of great yang nine in number; good and evil still had not been balanced.

Later, the Saint of Nine Mysteries Dao Lord asked about the Most High’s time of non-response. The Most High replied: “The affairs of the Six Heavens are established, relying on the Most True. Seeking the nine scriptures of yang nine and one hundred and six, returning to govern the Three Heavens. The reckoning ends during the Tang years, in the reign of the Jin family, at the end of Dinghai and the year of Renchen. Good and evil will then be clear, fortune and misfortune all judged.”

The True Kings of the Nine Heavens bestowed upon the Most High Great Dao Lord the subtle and winding true three-directional texts of the Great Clarity Spirit Capital, along with the many scriptures and true registers, to regulate the laws of the Six Heavens and Three Heavens. The True Law of the Three Heavens was given by the True Kings of the Nine Heavens and the Primordial Heavenly King at the origin of receiving breath, within the empty mystery. The law for establishing governance of the Six Heavens was given to the Most High.

At the rise of the Yellow Emperor’s governance, the Most High entrusted it to later learned emperors, prime ministers, the Azure Youth Lord, and the Western City King Lord, to hand over to those who become perfected beings. By means of the breath of the Six Heavens, through the law of the Three Heavens, one attains divinity and immortality.

The Three Heavens’ Nine Subtle Mysterious Spirit Capital True Registers come forth from the True Kings of the Nine Heavens, passed down to the Most High and the Jade Emperor of the Three Heavens. The Primordial Heavenly King gave them to the Queen Mother of the West. The Spirit-Flying Most True Most High Elder bestowed them upon the many immortals who attain the Dao and become perfected beings.

This text is secreted in the palace of the Most High Spirit Capital, carved on purple jade slips with golden script. Entrusted to the Five Elders, the Supreme True Immortal Capital’s Left Duke, sealed in a purple bud jade box, wrapped in a cloud brocade pouch. The Heavenly Consort attends with incense, the Jade Splendor holds the towel, guarded by three hundred golden youths each. Thus, the later saintly Jinque Emperor Lord and Prime Minister Azure Youth Lord, every three days of the month during pure fasting, ride the blue mist of the nine spirits’ flowing radiant clouds, flying beneath the azure canopy, following the mulberry forest of a thousand truths, ascending to the palace of the Most High Spirit Capital to pay homage to the True Father and feast in the jade court.

The Most High Great Dao Lord, at times with the Nine Mysterious Holy Lords and Prime Minister Azure Youth Lord, ascend together within the jade palace and jade hall, attended by countless maidens and myriad perfected beings, flying dragons and venomous beasts guarding the spirit passes, giant dragons thousands of feet long, brandishing claws over the vast court, flowing light shining brilliantly, radiantly illuminating Jade Clarity, suspended beneath banners and canopies, flags swirling around incense, jade flutes singing ethereal melodies, the divine forest stirring sound, myriad echoes raising their voices, opening the nine origins, all blowing cloud songs, qilin dancing and phoenixes calling, stirring the jade void, jade shaking the Three Pure Ones, setting forth the flowing nectar of rosy clouds, the hard fruit of the ring, various tablets scattered, eyes flowing to the great dark, finally drawing forth the cloud-hued lute, plucking and playing it. The jade sound is splendid and bright, resounding through the great firmament, singing the chapter of the divine phoenix and the melody of the nine spirits. Its words say:

> Subtle indeed is the nine mysterious breath,  
> Piercing the source, cleansing the dregs of the Three Pure Ones.  
> Spiritual transformations arise with the cycles,  
> The abyssal echoes reach the lofty heights.  
> The six senses open the mysterious gates,  
> Without awakening, the path has only just begun.  
> Holding the jade court’s bosom,  
> Unveiling the principle of the great void.  
> Purple radiance brightens the mysterious terrace,  
> Flowing reflections endlessly.  
> The great kalpa has its destined end,  
> One hundred and six suddenly arise.  
> The divine delights know no age,  
> Comforting the sorrowful children of later generations.

When the Most High finished singing, the Nine Mysterious Emperor Lords named themselves and sang again:

> Reins guiding nine dragons,  
> Attending court at the jade emperor’s hall.  
> The great void’s nine mysterious breath,  
> Law and transformation sink into the three spirits.  
> High assembly at the mysterious morning gate,  
> Personally commanding the primordial essence.  
> Binding brilliance at the great rosy cloud pavilion,  
> Flowing glances without end.  
> The divine reflection penetrates the hidden gate,  
> Refining the womb to restore the original form.  
> Comforting the sorrowful children of the five turbidities,  
> Sharing the fate of fleeting morning life.

When the Nine Mysterious Holy Lords finished singing, Prime Minister Azure Youth Lord named himself and sang. His words:

> The Nine Heavens’ cavernous original record,  
> Transforming and giving birth to boundless breath.  
> The three spirits clear the mysterious radiance,  
> The six essences follow the cycle and pass away.  
> The cinnabar firmament veils the empty cavern,  
> The three truths transcend boundlessness.  
> Gazing upon the Great Emperor’s hall,  
> Receiving and inheriting the Three Heavens’ system.  
> Driving away and cleansing the six heavens’ misfortunes,  
> Establishing uprightness free from dust and filth.  
> Penetrating the Great True chapter,  
> To save those who inherit the Tang era.  
> Enlightening the late learners,  
> Those with heart aligned to the dark covenant.  
> Extracting and freeing from the three paths’ suffering,  
> Swiftly controlling the dragon reins.  
> The serene Supreme Clarity pavilion,  
> Who would think there remains any obstruction?

When the song ended, the Most High, the Later Saint Nine Mysterious, and Prime Minister Azure Youth Lord together composed the True Law of the Three Heavens for removing the Six Heavens’ text, applying the treasured formulae, blessings, and sacrificial rites, entrusting the two lords to teach later learners who become perfected beings, to regulate the Six Heavens and punish the multitude of evils.

Thus, the Emperor Lords and Prime Minister Azure Youth Lord accepted the true formulae, bowed their heads, and returned.

The Little Heavenly King of Pure Emptiness said: “Whoever receives the many texts of the Three Heavens’ Nine Subtle Mysterious Spirit Capital Great True Yin-Yang Registers must always cultivate with focused heart and diligent thought, enter a chamber to burn incense, pray to the true spirit, and seek to receive and welcome the holy lords in the Supreme Clarity Palace. Recite the spirit chapters and talisman scriptures once through. After nine years, the spirit will manifest signs and responses; the Most High will send the Great Ultimate perfected being to descend into the child’s chamber.”

The Most High told the Later Saint Lord: “Whoever approaches the scripture master to receive the texts, the master must face north to swear an oath and impart to the disciple. When the disciple finishes receiving the texts, he must return facing east and bow nine times; he may also bow in heart, silently blessing thus:

> I hereby open to the True Kings of the Nine Heavens, the Primordial Heavenly King, and the Most High Great Dao Lord. I, born in the late world, far from the upper mystery, inherit the true lineage and receive the True Law of the Three Heavens for removing the Six Heavens’ text. Overwhelmed with joy and celebration, I hereby report above, beseeching the true truth, granting the descent of true spirits, commanding the Ten Directions, controlling myriad essences, roaring and standing firm, raising sound to fill the dark, receiving the eight illuminations, and welcoming the holy lords.”

When finished, write the scripture, place it in a separate chamber, burn incense morning and evening, worship the divine text. The Most High will send ten golden youths and ten jade maidens to attend and guard the wearer.

The Most High told the Later Saint Lord: “Whoever has the bone form named ‘Eastern Flower,’ having the Three Heavens’ True Law and the Most High’s many spirit registers, every nine years on their birth day or the year lord’s day, must write a text in white, plain vermilion script, and bring it to their assigned mountain peak to bury it, thus regulating the breath of the Five Mountains and myriad spirits. When burying the talisman, face north and knock teeth three times, silently blessing:

> The Six Heavens cycle, the Three Dao are true and bright,  
> The upper immortal true text commands the nine spirits,  
> Sealing and controlling the Five Mountains, gathering myriad spirits.  
> The present true immortal comes to my form,  
> Reporting to myriad spirits, recording my name,  
> Washing away a thousand impurities, later ascending to Jade Clarity.”

Then bury the text at a depth of nine feet. After twenty-seven years, with three burials combined, the Most High will send the Four Extremities perfected beings to come and welcome the child’s form to the Supreme Clarity Palace. The Five Mountain spirit officers will always guard, go out and patrol, granting natural joy, cloud chariots, and feathered steeds to escort the child’s form.

“You, having received nine years, must on your birth day or the year lord’s day, at midnight in a separate chamber when people are silent and still, expose yourself in the courtyard, sitting facing north. Arrange five tables to the five directions; on one table place incense and fire, on another a handkerchief covering the table. Also place a three-foot red-patterned cloth on the table, with a plate of fruit, one sheng of dates, and one wooden box. Bow twice facing north, knock teeth twelve times, and invite the Nine Subtleties, the Eight Paths Upper Emperor, the Nine Flower Emperor Mysterious Yellow Lady, the Nine Spirit Officers, and the Overseer of Truth, naming yourself as so-and-so. Having formerly received the many books of the Eight Spirit True Registers, after nine years you respectfully offer this subtle rite, presenting to the many truths, wishing to receive their descent and accept the elixir heart, making your form clear and bright, commanding the Ten Directions, subduing a thousand evils and myriad impurities, all fully subdued, gaining divine powers. When the nine years complete, you shall again petition to clarify truth. Thus finished.”

Use the fruit and dates for sacrifice, burying them at the assigned mountain, nine feet deep. When burying, face north, knock teeth nine times, and recite the spell:

> Heaven pure above, subtle Dao far and deep,  
> The Three Truths’ principle moves, six breaths sink and vanish.  
> Upper true spirit registers command myriad impurities,  
> Present offerings to the five spirits to receive and accept,  
> Seal and return to the spirit mountain,  
> Let my form rest with the mountain in harmony.

Pour water over the remaining offerings. After three such sacrifices, the Most High will send perfected beings to grant the child the title of Primal Lord, the Five Mountain immortals guarding the child’s form.

The Most High told the Later Saint Nine Mysterious Emperor Lord: “You receive the title of Supreme Clarity Golden Pavilion Later Saint Emperor Lord, ascending Supreme Clarity, traversing the Great Ultimate in the middle, governing the Ten Heavens below, sealing and commanding myriad beings, and all the heavens, rivers, seas, divine mountains, and earthly sources, secretly inspecting all spirits. You oversee all concerns, diligently seeking the upper truth, assisting in rectifying the Three Heavens, extinguishing wickedness. Now I issue the many books of the Eight Spirit True Registers, entrusting you to increase diligence, granting bone division to be a holy lord, removing impurities and preserving the seed, restoring the Three Heavens, so that by the Tang era, the year of Renchen, our Dao shall prevail.”

The Most High told the Later Saint Lord: “Whoever receives the True Law of the Three Heavens must establish effects for the Three Heavens, assist the times in removing evil, so that the true way shines forth and the Six Heavens perish. Always bathe and fast purely, enter a chamber to burn incense, write the true texts and spirit registers five times, place them in the five directions of the room where one dwells. Sit upright facing north, knock left teeth thirty-six times, close eyes and inwardly contemplate your own breath, transforming breath into firelight and essence flow, filling the sky with thick darkness, burning the four directions, all lands, mountains, forests, grasses, trees, earth spirits, officials, and people, all utterly cleansed. The sky becomes dark, no trace remains, the void is boundless, fire breath extinguished, pure breath surging. Above, no heaven; below, no earth. All beneath Heaven return to the void. The Golden Gate, Jade Pavilion, Jade Palace, Purple Hall, all arrayed, along with your own form, exist within emptiness and pure breath. Then raise your voice in blessing:

> Heaven’s yang and Earth’s vigor, the three and five and spirits,  
> Flowing light to the utmost edge, filling the sky with thick darkness.  
> From below, no outside, all returns formless,  
> The Six Heavens’ myriad impurities, none remain unbalanced.  
> The Great One hastens the cycle, the true Dao shall prevail.  
> The Nine Heavens give command, gathering and restraining all life.  
> Circling Heaven and Earth, nothing halts,  
> The holy emperor reveals his banner, controlling the purple court,  
> Examining the Ten Directions, presenting reports to Jade Clarity.”

When finished, draw in the breath of the five directions, swallow it, then draw in the Nine Breathings to cease.

This blessing of the Nine Heavens was given by the True Kings of the Nine Heavens to the Most High, who passed it to the Later Saint, commanding constant practice to govern the Six Heavens and command myriad spirits. If one can diligently focus the heart and carefully attend the Three Officials, assisting Heaven to remove evil, a peaceful era will come. The Most High will then naturally oversee and adjust accordingly to fulfill the perfected immortal.

The Most High told the Later Saint Lord: “Whoever receives the True Law of the Three Heavens and wears the true texts must always bathe and wash urgently, keep shoes and clothing clean and pure, not allowing filth or impurity. The true spirit will then stay far away; evil spirits will find no foothold, avoiding ruin and decay. Learners should clearly heed this. Whoever violates this prohibition, the Great Ultimate Lord of Immortals will withdraw and strip the disciple of their perfected rank.”

The Most High told the Later Saint Lord: “Whoever receives the True Law of the Three Heavens must not rashly enter places of filth and decay, nor weep or shed tears, nor mourn or inquire about death and funerals. Violators will be stripped of their perfected rank.”

The Most High told the Later Saint Lord: “Whoever receives the True Law of the Three Heavens and wears the true texts, when going out or resting in the three lights and at night, must not expose the head without a kerchief or hat, nor remove clothing to expose the form, thereby insulting the true texts, causing the noble spirit to depart and leaving an empty corpse alone. Violators will lose their calculations and be stripped of perfected rank. Learners, be cautious.”

The Most High told the Later Saint Lord: “Whoever receives the True Law of the Three Heavens must not recklessly share beds or sit together with yin families, nor wear the same clothes or share bedding and rest with those whose outer qi differs, nor exchange shoes and sandals. Violators will lose calculations and be stripped of perfected rank. Learners, be cautious.”

The Most High told the Later Saint Lord: “Whoever receives the True Law of the Three Heavens, gathering and restraining myriad spirits, commanding and pacifying the Six Heavens, must first make their own form pure and tranquil, dignified and upright, not violating prohibitions. The true spirit will then be always solemn, myriad spirits guarding the form. Following the method of practice, the Six Heavens’ misfortunes will naturally retreat, and will not harm the disciple’s correctness. But if one’s form is unclear and taken by myriad impurities, on the day of calamity, do not lament this scripture. Learners, be cautious.”

The Most High told the Later Saint Lord: “These five rules come from the *Four Extremities Bright Methods*, chapter eleven, middle section. There are jade youths attending as guards; those who wear the texts and violate prohibitions are reported by the jade youths, their bodies suffer dark punishments, calamity reaches the seven mysteries. Therefore, I have copied them out to show later learners who wear them to study.”

The Most High told the Later Saint Lord: “Those who receive the purple text of the Three Primal Lords are given twelve golden youths and twelve jade maidens to attend and guard their form. Those who receive the many true registers are given ten golden youths to attend and guard their form. Those who receive the Great Clarity Spirit Capital’s subtle and winding true three-directional texts are given thirty straight talisman bearers and twelve jade maidens to attend and guard their form. Those who receive the Heavenly Emperor Lord’s Compassionate True Book are given ten golden youths to attend and guard their form. Those who receive the Most High Primal Lord’s true text are given twelve jade maidens to attend and guard their form. Those who receive the Purple Tenuity Mysterious Palace Jade Text Flying Heaven True Book are given twenty-four golden youths and twenty-four jade maidens to attend and guard their form. Those who receive the Penglai High Supreme True Book are given twelve golden youths to attend and guard their form. Those who receive the Heavenly Emperor Elder Lord Yellow Supreme True Book are given one hundred jade maidens, knowing fortune and misfortune. Those who receive the Mysterious Continent Immortal Elder’s Opening Heaven Myriad Immortals True Book are given twelve golden youths to attend and guard their form. Those who receive the Great Birth Great True Five Mountain Military Talismans are given twelve jade maidens to attend and guard their form. Those who receive the Primordial Heavenly King’s True Book, for entering and exiting the void, are given twelve golden youths and twelve jade maidens to attend and guard their form.”

The Most High told the Later Saint Lord: “Those with bone division, named Eastern Flower, recording characters of Supreme Clarity, receiving the many true books and registers, are given golden youths and jade maidens to attend and guard their form, recording merits and good deeds, correcting prohibitions and leaks. Wearers must not recklessly transmit; transmission by unqualified persons, or without regard to years, lightly leaking the treasured texts, will suffer the trial of the wind blade, lose life by ghost officials, calamity touching the seven mysteries and ancestors, their fate blocked by mountain stones, rivers of the nine sources sealed. Be deeply cautious in observance.”

*Supreme Clarity’s Text for Removing the Six Heavens: The True Law of the Three Heavens* was received by the Later Saint Lord from the Most High, compiled by the Little Heavenly King of Pure Emptiness, the Supreme Immortal Registers, collectively named the Six Heavens Text and Three Heavens True Law, to capture myriad ghosts and restrain myriad evils. Passed down three times over seven hundred years, with one hundred years having its person, allowing for re-bestowal.

A thirty-foot vermilion and azure banner is the essential token; a forty-three-foot blue cloth is the secret oath; five pairs of golden rings are the great oath pointing to Heaven. Men receiving the text need not offer sacrifice; women receiving it must offer sacrifice. The transmission requires fasting for three or seven days. Also, within the fast, a scripture master is served with ten taels of gold as the token of spirit communication. Those who leak or do not follow the regulations will be tried for seven generations, as by the Four Extremities’ laws. Wearing the text without proper yin breath, if the yin breath is turbid and foul, the body suffers great crime and after death becomes a lower ghost. Properly observing it ensures ascension to Supreme Clarity. The Eight Emperors regard this as the secret immortal certificate; those who have it bear the Taiyin Book named the Jade Slip.

The Scripture of the Most High’s True Law of the Three Heavens ends.
