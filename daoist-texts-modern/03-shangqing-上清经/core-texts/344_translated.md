### The Most High Jade Morning Yu Yi Binding Linting Flight to Sun and Moon Diagram

The Middle Chapter of the Most High Hidden Scripture says:  
“If you wish to become a True One, you must preserve the Lord of the Sun,  
Drive dragons harnessed to phoenix steeds,  
Ride the heavenly radiant clouds,  
Journey eastward to the rare forest,  
Then enter the imperial gate,  
With focused thought you shall attain it.  
The essential dao is not troublesome,  
Named Supreme Clarity Spirit,  
The ranks of True Officials hold the Yu Yi text.”

The Middle Chapter of the Most High Hidden Scripture also says:  
“If you wish to ascend to Heaven, you must preserve the Lady of the Moon,  
Drive ten heavenly dragons,  
Ride my flowing bells,  
Travel west to the Six Ridges,  
Then enter the imperial hall,  
With focused thought you shall see,  
The imperial court of the Heavenly Sovereign,  
Where you hold the Binding Linting chapter.”

The right-hand secret of flight to Sun and Moon, the Most High Supreme Clarity Great Ultimate Nine Emperors and Four True Ones’ treasured secret, is the jade seal of the Mysterious and Profound Primordial Lord. Unless one bears the Golden Pavilion jade name and the recorded characters of Eastern Splendor, these two chapters are not heard or seen. Those who practice it first purify with one hundred days of fasting and sever human relations; only then may it be done. Long practice leads to flight to Sun and Moon, receiving fifty jade boys and fifty jade girls each. The Most High Yu Yi red text and Binding Linting yellow chapter are the Most High Jade Emperor Lord’s spiritual secret chapters. They are stored in the chamber of the Nine Heavens, on the platform of cinnabar and jade; unless one is diligent in heart and fond of the True, or has the ancestral records of flying Mysterious Heaven immortals, none may see or hear them. Their chapter titles must not be spoken lightly. To speak them carelessly invites the Three Officials’ judgment—Heaven and Earth will not pardon. Originally, one person was allowed to transmit every three hundred years; after that, one every seven hundred years. If a divine True One secretly reports a worthy recipient, it is transmitted. The method of transmission is always master to disciple, to honor the profound ritual. If one is not the proper person, and does not follow the rules, it is a leak of the heavenly text. Those who are negligent or break their oath die as lower ghosts, suffering the seven ancestral tests of the wind blade. Unless of the same breath, better to keep silent. In the Western Mysterious Mountain cave platform are these two scriptures, carved on jade slips, written in golden characters. Also at Qingxu Heaven of Wangwu, they exist though not complete. The palace officials and Taiqing officials do not know what these books are. In the northern cave of Mount Emei, in the stone chamber door pivot, is carved:  
“Yu Yi draws forth the sun’s essence,  
Binding Linting summons the moon’s spirit,  
Where the dao is attained is the high official,  
Ranked as the great True One.”  
Twenty characters in all. Those immortals who see this are greatly puzzled and do not understand what it means. Many such immortals have never seen the chapters or their catalogues. The Nine Elixirs of Golden Liquid are minor arts and cannot fly to Supreme Clarity. To practice this dao, one need not be wise or foolish, only that on earth this text is absent. The True Officials’ mysterious method is transmitted by oath; those who receive and practice attain the rank of Supreme True One, riding the eight radiant jade wheels, roaming the nine dawns. Hence the secret saying:  
“If you obtain Yu Yi and Binding Linting, you become a true one of Supreme Clarity.  
Without cultivating this dao, you shall not see the Three Primordial Lords.”

The True One of the Great Origin said:  
“If you preserve the sun essence of the Five Emperor Lords,  
Holding the Most High Yu Yi text in your mouth,  
You must complete this dao to see the Lord of the Sun;  
Without it, you only toil in vain and suffer grievance.”  
He also said:  
“If you preserve the moon essence of the Five Emperor Ladies,  
Holding the Most High Binding Linting chapter in your mouth,  
You must complete this dao to see the Lady of the Moon;  
Without it, you only grieve and lament in vain.”

These two lines are the True One of the Great Origin’s received secret instructions from the Great Emperor Lord. The Most High Hidden Scripture says: “Preserve and hold them.” The Emperor Lord says: “Hold them in your mouth.”

The True One of the Great Origin taught Lord Pei: preserve and hold one text in your mouth, and grasp one text in your hand; practice both together.

The True One of the Great Origin transmitted to the Pure Spirit True One Lord Pei two matters: the Most High Yu Yi Binding Linting texts, to reach the spirits of sun and moon, to ascend swiftly to sun and moon, to communicate with heavenly light and fly the great void path. All ride cloud chariots and feathered canopies, drive the destined dragons, and ascend to the imperial purple court.

Inner observation says:  
“If you wish to tread the void, preserve sun and moon;  
If you wish to ascend to Pure Spirit, preserve the Five Stars;  
Secret chambers, secret journeys, do not leave your courtyard—this is what is meant.”

The Pure One’s Dan talisman says:  
“Great indeed is Yu Yi, wondrous is Binding Linting,  
Not seen by any but the Supreme True,  
Not heard by any but the Supreme Immortal,  
To summon the spirits of sun, moon, and five essences,  
Ride dragons to tread the void,  
Step upon the radiant clouds,  
Pursue with the Five Emperors,  
Enter the heavenly gate.  
If anyone hears this, be careful not to speak carelessly,  
At death you may depart, the oath is gold and transmitted,  
Must be entrusted to disciples.  
Those with intent who recklessly speak the chapter titles,  
The jade boys report above,  
If leaked, they are judged,  
Their bodies never immortal,  
Jade boys and jade girls depart and do not return,  
The texts must be lost,  
Punished by the Three Officials.  
You must be cautious in speech,  
Words are the source of sin.”

### Sun Palace

The Jade Hall sect instructions say:  
“At dawn on the first day of the lunar month, sit calmly,  
Purify and quiet the mind,  
Knock your teeth thirty-six times to open the passages,  
First preserve your own dantian as the great sea,  
The sun rises from the sea,  
Your own body sits at the crown gate,  
Body like a mountain stone,  
Chant the spell:”

“Yang gives birth to the primal sea, rising from below,  
Confused yang essence scatters the crowd of yin,  
Within is the great god, the Lord of Yu Yi,  
Descend this true qi, cleanse my form.”

The Jade Hall sect instructions say:  
“After chanting, swallow saliva nine times,  
Then preserve the rising sun,  
Golden light shines upon my true form,  
I face the Sun Palace, chant the spell:”

“Golden wheel presents auspice,  
Cavern shines with yang brightness,  
Flaming light rushes and flies,  
Ten thousand li flow essence,  
Demons vanish, flames extinguished,  
Dust and filth swept clean,  
Pierce the void and fly steps,  
Harness qi and rise high.”

The Jade Hall sect instructions say:  
“After chanting, swallow saliva nine times,  
Then mount the fire dragon,  
Rush to the Sun Palace, chant the spell:”

“Fire dragon leads ahead,  
Piercing crown light flies,  
Spirit enters the void,  
Pay homage to Yu Yi,  
In an instant gaze upon the sovereign,  
Mix and blend spiritual radiance,  
One truth pursues the root,  
Burn and destroy the corpse.”

The Jade Hall sect instructions say:  
“After chanting, swallow saliva nine times,  
Meditate entering the Sun Palace,  
Become one with the body,  
Long forget your form,  
Warm and gentle as spring,  
Practice for one year to dispel illness,  
Command ghosts and spirits to come and go naturally;  
Two years to communicate with immortals,  
Three realms serve and guard;  
Three years the demon king supports;  
Nine years the merit is complete,  
The Five Emperors descend to befriend you,  
Decree you a True One,  
Attain longevity.”

### Most High Jade Morning Yu Yi Flight to Sun Red Radiance Jade Text

The Spiritual Scripture in purple text says:  
“The method of gathering and ingesting flying roots, swallowing the sun’s qi,  
Was once bestowed by the Great Emperor Lord of Taiwei Heaven,  
Also named the Red Elixir Golden Essence Stone Radiance Water Mother Jade Embryo Scripture.  
Its method is always at sunrise, facing east, knocking teeth nine times,  
Then softly invoking the sun soul’s name,  
The five characters of the sun’s five emperors say:”

Chant these twenty-four characters, then close eyes and grasp firmly, preserve the five-colored essence light of the moon’s center all entering the mouth. Also, in the moon’s center is yellow qi, as large as the pupil, named the flying flower jade embryo essence. Those who cultivate this dao become immortals who fly to sun and moon.

Whoever practices the Yu Yi flight to sun dao must daily watch the sun’s first rising moment. If no sun, remain in the quiet chamber, facing east toward the sun, knock teeth nine times, close eyes and hold breath for nine breaths, swallow the sun’s radiance nine times, preserve the light and clouds to enter the mouth, then swallow it. Afterward softly call:

Repeat three times, still closing eyes and grasping firmly, preserve seeing the five-colored flowing clouds of the sun’s center all coming to receive the whole body, down to the feet, and preserve the five-colored qi rising to the crown. Then the sun’s light and flowing clouds of five colors all enter the mouth. Among the sun’s light and flowing clouds is purple qi as large as the pupil, layered dozens of times, shining brightly within the five-colored light, named the flying root water mother. All together with the five qi enter the mouth. Facing the sun, swallow the clouds with forty-five swallows of breath. After finishing, knock teeth nine times, softly invoke:  

“Red furnace elixir qi, round heaven flying essence,  
Firm to receive softness,  
Flaming water yin spirit,  
Sun and stars’ primal radiance, called Great Brightness,  
Nine yang harmonize transformation,  
Two smokes both arise,  
Condense soul and harmonize spirit,  
Essence of five qi,  
Midst born five emperors,  
Ride light and govern form,  
Gather flying to the void,  
Sip roots to fill,  
Head wrapped in dragon splendor,  
Cape crimson with blue belt,  
Reins black flowing mysterious,  
Clouds reflect Supreme Clarity,  
Grant book jade slips,  
Golden pavilion engraved names,  
Consume morning clouds,  
Unite with the dao and spirit,  
Fly immortal to Taiwei,  
Ascend purple court.”

After the blessing, preserve the Blue Emperor Lord descending from sunlight on my left; preserve the Red Emperor Lord descending from sunlight on my right; preserve the White Emperor Lord descending from sunlight behind me; preserve the Black Emperor Lord descending from sunlight on my left hand; preserve the Yellow Emperor Lord descending from sunlight on my right hand.

Great brilliance opens dawn,  
Shining red essence,  
Five emperors initiate clouds,  
Reflecting caverns of myriad life,  
Observe the fall of Supreme True Ones,  
Void without obstruction,  
Move qi to refine and gather,  
Flow and wander five forms,  
Make my spirit transform,  
Six bowels spread spirit,  
Together with Emperor Lords,  
Taiyi without brilliance,  
Harness scarlet clouds,  
Yang fire nine chariots,  
Ascend swiftly to sun center,  
Unite spirit with emperor,  
Longevity equal to Heaven and Earth,  
Two dawns incline to each other.”

After finishing, knock teeth three times, swallow saliva three times, softly bless:

Make me obtain,  
Sun cave of Heaven,  
Eastern dark long hill,

Wear the talisman of nine existences,  
Eat blue essence candy,  
Drink cloud green fat,  
Feast in the domain of eight extremes,  
Ascend the platform of bright truth,  
Sit in the hall of rare forest,  
Chant the words of Jade Morning.”

Blessing finished.

The right preserves the flowing bells and flying clouds chariot, driving nine yellow dragons, coming from moonlight before me, still preserving the Five Ladies riding together, rushing to the moon. After entering my form, long time passes, swallow saliva fourteen times, then close eyes and deeply meditate, preserve the thought as if present, then again bow to the moon. Those who can long practice this dao will surely ride the radiance to fly to the moon. This is the completion of the Yu Yi dao. If a daoist rests in the mountains, fasting long at the Five Peaks, severing dust of the human world, thinking far of purity and truth, they may daily consume the sun root’s clouds, swallow the sun’s essence, and immediately feel their body born with jade luster, face shining with flowing light. If externally still entangled with human affairs, not yet attained quiet form, wandering the worldly path with the heart bound and entangled, they must on the moon’s first, third, fifth, seventh, ninth, thirteenth, fifteenth, seventeenth, nineteenth, twenty-fifth day, perform accordingly as above method, ten times in one month. On that day the moon soul descends to receive, flying root fills, water mother dreams gather.

Practiced for eighteen years, Supreme Clarity will then refine soul and change substance, shining with jade light, riding mysterious reins and radiance, flying through the great void.

### Ziwei Consume Moon Essence Supreme Profound Yin Birth Talisman

On the night of the new moon, at midnight, written in yellow on blue paper, facing east, consume it to first notify the moon soul. At this time one should first consume the Opening Bright Spirit talisman. When consuming the moon talisman, hold breath, right hand holds talisman, heart chants:  

“Ziwei yellow script, named Supreme Profound,  
Summon moon flower water,  
Nourish soul and harmonize spirit,  
Strict matters in the square,  
Emit from mysterious pass,  
Hidden heaven moon,  
Five spirit ladies,  
Flying light nine paths,  
Reflect bright mud pellet.”

After the spell, consume the talisman.

It also says:  
“Those who know the moon soul’s name,  
Will have no disasters their whole life,  
Ten thousand harms cannot injure.  
The Most High stores the sun and moon emperor ladies’ secret names in the Great Origin Palace; those who know are divine immortals.”

It also says:  
“Those who know the sun soul’s name,  
Will have no illness their whole life,  
Ten thousand calamities will not strike.  
The Most High stores the sun and moon soul names in the Purple Void Jade Palace; those who know communicate with spirits and make them efficacious.”

Those who preserve the flight to sun and moon dao may practice as convenient, need not do it all. If wishing to find a quiet chamber and hide, only require seeing the first rays of sun and moon. If not severing human affairs and connected with external things, one cannot practice this dao. At night always burn incense, preserve the names of the Five Emperors and Five Ladies, heart chants: “May I unite with the Emperor Lords and Taiyi Five Spirits, merge radiance as one.”

Thus practicing for twenty-four years, one also ascends to Heaven in broad daylight, no need to practice the flight and preservation dao. Always preserve them at my side, with heart chant. The old saying forbids letting ears hear. If already attained the immortal dao, perfected essence and thought, preserve for two years, then have visions; three years form appears; five years obtain flight to sun and moon. Those not yet immortals who first seek essence and thought are thus uninvited. Those who can long cultivate it ascend to the two radiances, become Supreme Clarity True Ones, and every seven hundred years transmit to one person.
