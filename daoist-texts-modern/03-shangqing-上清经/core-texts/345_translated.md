### Supreme Scripture of the Jade Pendant and Golden Tassel, the Supreme Ultimate Golden Book

On the first day of the first month in the first year of the Supreme Spirit, when the six origins celebrated in union, the day of Jiazi and the direct hour of Chen, the Primordial Heavenly King and the Supreme Emperor jointly rode the azure mist and swift whirlwind of the purple ranks. They ascended the cliff of the Nine Mysteries, to the borderless edge of colorlessness, wandering the cavernous heavens, roaming freely in the ultimate origin. Their forms flowed and stretched, delighting in the floating wheel, beholding the two principles as they divided and judged, observing the great transformation as it endures forever. Bowing to assume the imperial throne, they rejoiced in our dao and exulted. They calculated the cycles to alter the degrees, comprehended the final birth to turn the wheel, prayed for numinous auspices in the vast sky, expounded the supreme methods in the Nine Heavens, and opened vows to announce to the spirits, purifying the celestial court with fasting.

On that day suddenly the heavenly light dimmed and darkened, sun and moon vanished in daylight, the eight breaths withdrew their thanks, the seven origins concealed their essence, the profound phenomena became obscure and blocked, myriad numinous beings fled in spirit. For three days and three nights, the jade rooster crowed to herald the dawn. At that time, nine suns blazed brightly in the east, mysterious light shining clearly upon the heavenly origin. Then a blue crow came flying, its beak holding a purple scroll, gathering at the jade pavilion, descending through the empty air, mysteriously presenting it to the Heavenly King and the Supreme Emperor.

Thus the two sovereigns purified themselves in the high heavens, receiving the imperial edict of true writings, which read:

*The Jade Pendant and Golden Tassel, Supreme Ultimate Golden Book,  
Profound True Cavern’s Flying Twin Radiance Precious Scripture,  
Its words richly adorned with the Supreme Firmament,  
Its divine light dazzling throughout the Nine Heavens.  
Jade characters reveal profound wisdom in the Purple Void,  
Precious sounds drift brightly at the Misty Ford.  
From on high, the pure spirit daughters are sent,  
The Supreme Truth gifts the purple dawn children,  
Each three thousand attendants guarding the divine writings.  
Jade maidens scatter flowers to dispel filth,  
Purple children turn incense to banish dust.  
Radiant light intermingles, four gatherings play smoke,  
Auspicious clouds linger, seven origins pour their essence,  
Nine splendors shine brightly, heavenly spirits unfold,  
Rivers and seas calm their waves, eight winds raise the wheels.  
Golden immortals wield halberds, five emperors bear banners,  
Flying immortals and feathered riders number billions,  
Holding banners and setting rhythms, troops arrayed in tens of thousands,  
Flying dragons and poisonous beasts claw the cloud peaks,  
Jade trees sound their music, a hundred chants echo each other,  
Palace tones harmonize in emptiness, high and low form melodies,  
Western consorts beat time, heavenly maidens play the zither,  
Eight sounds rise in clamor, ethereal echoes fill the clouds,  
Twin emperors quicken the rhythm, phoenixes dance and soar,  
Dragon flowers fold four times, voices join in chorus,  
Cloud chimes ring brightly, shattering the jade clarity,  
Flying songs answer each other, vast music fills the empty court,  
Profound yellow glows shine, dense as the net of stars,  
Three treasures fan each other, weaving emptiness around spirits,  
All numinous beings rejoice, three candles merge in brightness,  
No day, no night, long celebration of cloud arrays.*

Then, the Primordial Heavenly King and the Supreme Emperor swore a golden-blue covenant with Heaven, announcing to the spirits of the Nine Void, receiving the supreme truth. They cast gold into slips, carved the spiritual writings, had the Turtle Mother hold the brush, the Supreme One sweep the mat, placed them in a pouch of cloud brocade, secreted in the dense forest chest, sealed with the triple seals of Jade Clarity’s Three Origins. Entrusted to the Left Duke of the Immortal Capital, attendant to the immortal feathered attendants, stored in the Jade Essence Jade Terrace’s Profound Cloud Feather Chamber. They also commanded the Northern Cold Golden Platform’s Dragon Flower Jade Maidens and the White Void Yu Palace’s Western Spirit Jade Children, each three hundred, to oversee incense and hold scarves, guarding the spiritual truth. According to the Supreme Truth’s regulations, through myriad kalpas, the scripture shall be passed to those whose bones and spirits are united with immortality. Those who glimpse it shall find the Supreme Ultimate book named and presented to the Shangqing. Those who leak it lightly shall be named ghost officials, punished by wind blades, with seven ancestors filling the blame—care must be taken.

On the first day of the third month in the first year of the Central Emperor, at the time when heavenly virtue aligned, the Primordial descended to instruct within the Cold Spirit Elixir Hall, the Jade Terrace Yellow Chamber. He ordered the Five Elders of the Immortal Capital to unfold the frost silk cloud brocade report and the dense forest chest, bringing forth the Jade Pendant and Golden Tassel, the Hidden Writings of the Supreme Firmament, the Profound True Cavern’s Flying Twin Radiance Precious Scripture, to transmit to the High Sage Jade Dawn Supreme Great Dao Sovereign, the Three Heavens Jade Children, the Western Turtle Queen Mother, the Purple Clarity Jade Essence Three Origins Sovereigns, and the Central Yellow Lord Lao. The Supreme Emperor transmitted to the Heavenly Emperor, the Supreme Subtle Emperor, the Southern Pole Supreme Origin Ban Sovereign, and the Emperor of the Golden Palace of the Supreme Clarity. At that time, the assembly of numinous beings ascended the Jade Space Jade Terrace’s Profound Truth Hall, dwelling within the Jade Chamber and Golden Splendor, purifying and fasting for three months, arrayed in gold and blue to swear to the spirits, announcing the cinnabar covenant to the supreme truth.

Thus the Jade Pendant Soul-Spirit Emperor, draped in a pearl-embroidered splendid cloak and flying brocade blue skirt, wearing a purple crown with moon and sun, holding the jade pendant standing on the left; the Golden Tassel Corporeal-Spirit Emperor, draped in a purple pearl-embroidered cloak and flying gauze cinnabar skirt, wearing a splendid crown with moon and sun, holding the golden tassel standing on the right. The two sovereigns proclaimed the covenant to the spirits, accompanied by blue and white twin lights, shining brilliantly through the Nine Heavens, streaming through the vast sky, startling the Jade Clarity’s four offices and five emperors, the flying immortals and feathered riders numbering in the billions. Suddenly they arrived, leading the immortal jade attendants holding the five emperor spirit mills, the assembly of immortals floating in place, myriad spirits guarding the pavilion.

The Primordial Heavenly Lord wore the crown of the Limitless Cavernous Heaven, draped in a nine-colored silk gauze cloak and flying frost pearl robe, girded with the divine light sun bell and the sword of nurturing extension, left side adorned with the falling jewel, right side with golden truth. The Supreme Emperor wore the seven-pearl crown, draped in a nine-colored natural cloud-patterned cloak and flying gauze radiant feather robe, waist bound with phoenix patterns flowing gold fire bells, holding the command demon nine-colored scepter. The nine elder immortals held the golden essence altar standing in the void, above supporting the precious writings, to present to the assembly of numinous beings.

Thus the announcement to the spirits was complete, each guarded by three hundred golden immortal children and Taihua daughters, attending the divine truth. Such are the high sages, all receiving the spiritual writings thrice monthly. When the cycle reaches the end of the three generations, Heaven and Earth’s qi mingle, the scripture shall be passed to the seed people, bearing the mysterious jade register, listing the figures of the Three Origins Heavens. Without this, the scripture is secreted in the golden chamber, forbidden to be rashly revealed or leaked.

### Jade Pendant Hidden Writings of the Cavernous Flying Precious Scripture

The Jade Pendant contains the soul essence of the Nine Heavens. Above the Nine Heavens it is called Morning Lamp, also the Supreme Hidden Profound Cavern Flying Precious Seal. It dwells in the Jade Clarity Hall within the Supreme Firmament, gathering the qi of the Azure Yang, reflecting the Nine Heavens, its blue light murky yet clear, illuminating the platform of the Three Origins, its color like blue jade, shape like a full moon. Within is the empty profound jade platform and purple palace, where the Soul-Spirit Emperor dwells centrally. The Hidden Writings of the Supreme Firmament’s Jade Pendant are inscribed on the southern pavilion of the Profound Platform. The scripture says:

*To seek longevity, first take from the body  
Moonlight and moon essence, sunlight and sun brilliance,  
Left turns the jade pendant, right holds the golden tassel,  
Twin radiances entwined, twin spirits at peace,  
Ascending the Supreme Ultimate, descending to the Ten Directions,  
Firmly preserving the profound truth, securing the spiritual root,  
Profound valley and radiant embryo, pouring and reflecting precious treasures,  
Rinsing the moon, biting the sun, to enter the heavenly gate,  
Golden tassel gazes upward, jade pendant guards the pass,  
Blue and white clearly divided, fitting my mud pellet,  
Precious liquid seals essence, refining the soft body and spirit,  
Three lords fully guarding, cinnabar and scarlet skirts,  
Pearl-embroidered splendid cloaks, flying brocade blue skirts,  
Wearing moon and holding sun, crowned with purple,  
Seated in the bright hall, shaded by the seven origins,  
Yellow Court’s Wu and Ji, blocking and suppressing evil sources,  
Respectfully managing the two sons, no white or bright origin,  
Peach and Kang three elders, at my birth gate,  
Penetrating the five palaces, twelve threads,  
Exhaling and inhaling the six chambers,  
Soul rejoices, spirit delights, banishing a hundred ailments,  
Repelling heat and removing cold, twin radiances entwined,  
Ten thousand spirits inwardly joyful,  
Clearly revealing its text, flying to ascend the southern pavilion,  
Holding the golden pendant and jade, entering the radiant mysterious light,  
Nine Heavens united in spirit, the Profound Mother in the chamber,  
Yin nourishes, yang guides, bright colors fresh and fair,  
Positioned in the cinnabar chamber, named and inscribed in the imperial palace,  
Three revolutions and nine degrees, blending with fate.*

This jade pendant precious text is the Supreme Ultimate Profound Truth scripture. Those who cultivate it fly through the vast void, roam the Nine Purities, record on white slips, and the Eastern Splendor books name it. The Queen Mother of the West now carves this text in the Profound Garden chamber of Mount Kunlun. Only those of pure and empty nature may glimpse and contemplate it.

Those who wish to soar to the Nine Purities, feast in the southern pavilion, turn the jade pendant in the bright hall, draw the golden tassel in the mud pellet, summon the true soul at the morning lamp, and call the flying radiance to the emperor, should always, at dusk before sleep, place both hands on the heart, close the eyes and inwardly think, drawing the azure yang qi of the jade pendant, its light murky and round like the moon, reflecting the destined body, penetrating the one form. The Soul-Spirit Emperor, surname Kaiyuan, named (Men Shixing), shape nine inches long, head crowned with purple, draped in pearl-embroidered splendid cloak, wearing flying brocade blue skirt, girded with moon and sun, riding the azure crow, amidst azure light, descending to the destined body to settle the mud pellet.

The destined one must tap the teeth nine times through the nine passes, swallow saliva twenty-seven times, and the yin invocation says:

*Profound Origin Supreme Spirit, soul essence of the Nine Heavens,  
Morning lamp shining brightly, gathering murky azure qi,  
Called the Jade Pendant, illuminating the great brightness,  
Wearing moon and sun, establishing talisman and holding bell,  
Radiant light flowing and dazzling, pervading all under Heaven’s gloom,  
Riding azure controlling wings, cinnabar carriage and purple canopy,  
First feasting in the Three Origins, returning to descend my form,  
Settling in the mud pellet, flowing down to the Yellow Court,  
Checking souls and binding spirits, myriad gods at peace,  
Five viscera connected, nine apertures flourishing,  
Eight radiances soaring, ascending into Jade Clarity.*

Then, rubbing both hands to warm them, pressing the forehead nine times, wiping the eyes twenty-seven times, swallowing breath three times and stopping, then lying down. Thus the soul is peaceful, the spirit tranquil, myriad gods guard the palace, internal spirit qi solidified, external evil sources blocked, eight radiances transform, refining the true to change into immortality. After nine years, one can penetrate the dark and obscure, reverse the unknown, sit with the dead and converse face to face. After eighteen years, the dao is perfected, the true descends, flying and roaming Shangqing. Without this method, the three souls do not guard, the seven spirits are restless, three corpses fly, nine worms rush in terror, attacking within the form, evil comes to penetrate essence, qi scatters, spirit departs, body unclean and impure, swallowing saliva in vain, losing qi and spirit. Those who obtain this dao can achieve longevity, treasure and carefully refine it, how could fate be overturned?

If Heaven lacks the Three True, Jade Void is unclear, the Nine Heavens not bright, the Three Lights not shining.

Those who know this secret, together with the Three Treasures and Complete Truth, its method is deeply secret and must not be rashly revealed. Without ascending the covenant to announce to the spirits and swearing faith to the Nine Heavens, one may not be shown the precious name. Light transmission is false, the blame falls on the seven ancestors, suffering the three paths, treading the five hardships on the blade mountain, the body perishes by wind blades, repaying sins at the river source.

There is a golden imperial chart, listing characters of Jade Clarity. Those who receive this secret keep their mouths closed, cultivate and serve day and night. Within three years, the true form descends naturally, flying and soaring.

All qi returning, guarding the nine sources,

Morning lamp shining brightly, ascending to the emperor’s honor,  
Record my cinnabar name, early attain supreme immortality,

The right Nine Heavens corporeal spirit Supreme Firmament Yin birth upper radiance talisman is carved within the golden tassel rainbow reflection yin radiance inner truth, the pivot of the Nine Heavens, the canopy of Supreme Clarity. Without this text, there is no day or night; without it, the vast void has no Supreme Clarity. Therefore, the Primordial carved the text on golden slips, named the Supreme Clarity Golden Characters Jade Script. Its sound is the inner name of the heavenly corporeal spirit. In the past, on the first day of the ninth month of the first year of the opening of the origin, a blue crow carried the text, presenting it to the Queen Mother of the West. Now carved and inscribed on the shady side of the piled stones of Mount Kunlun, jade maidens oversee incense, guarding the jade truth. All Shangqing numinous beings receive it from the Primordial, wearing it to roam the Shangqing palace. The Nine Heavens keep it secret in the Jade Terrace, not passing it to the world below.

Those who see the text find the golden tassel’s downward reflection, one body illuminated. Those who wear the text ascend the Rainbow Reflection mountain, shine on the jade flower seat, loosen membranes at the jade pass, pull the three paths at the spirit pavilion, change the nine talismans for rebirth, and can fly as immortals in the imperial register. Cultivate its dao, wear its text, and in nine years gain the Soul-Spirit Emperor of the Nine Heavens prime minister, riding the white phoenix cloud carriage, descending to the sleeping chamber, granting the destined divine truth dao, the three departments and eight radiances moving the destined to fly through the void, ascending the Nine Heavens, feasting on the jade mountain.

Without the mysterious name at the northern window, recording golden characters at the Dan Terrace, holding the destiny before birth, sealing jade storage in the purple womb, the yin radiance upper talisman cannot be lightly studied, jade sounds cannot be lightly revealed. Light leakage brings loss of body to ghost officials, seven ancestors’ servitude, endless kalpas without reprieve.

To wear this talisman, one must write it in white on black silk, on birth and year lord days ascend the Profound Mountain, swear with blue gold to the Nine Heavens, announce to the five spirits, then transmit it. Orally pronounce the secret sounds, blessing as per the Supreme Truth’s regulations. Do not rashly reveal or leak; leakage brings left official wind blade trial, losing immortality and body.

The Soul-Spirit Emperor is the Nine Heavens Fate Controller, governing the Nine Heavens soul essence, overseeing later disciples’ fate calculations. The emperor dwells in the sun gate golden court.

The Corporeal-Spirit Emperor is the Nine Heavens prime minister, governing the Nine Heavens corporeal spirit, overseeing later disciples’ registers. The emperor dwells in the moon palace of the jade capital.

The Primordial told the Queen Mother of the West: Those who do not know the Jade Pendant Morning Lamp as the Nine Heavens soul, the yang talisman as the original birth qi, the golden book secret characters as the Nine Heavens hidden name, but only cultivate the Eight Simple True Scriptures, spiritual writings and purple texts, swallow the sun and moon imperial brilliance, and swallow the flying roots, the sun essence will not descend, the flowing rosy clouds will not root, only drawing qi in vain, the stone radiance cannot be gathered, the sun brilliance cannot be eaten. The Nine Heavens do not accept the destined name, the profound truth cannot be grasped, the morning lamp cannot be returned, the jade pendant cannot be turned. Since the twin radiances do not descend, the mud pellet is empty and abandoned, myriad spirits fly away, soul departs, spirit scatters, qi disperses and truth is lost, laboring diligently without gain in immortality.

Those who do not know the golden tassel Rainbow Reflection as the Nine Heavens corporeal spirit, the yin talisman golden characters jade script as the inner sound of the Nine Heavens corporeal spirit, but only cultivate the yellow qi and yang essence three-five orderly dao, the yellow water moonlight cannot be drunk, the youthful face cannot be secured, the flower countenance cannot remain fresh, the spiritual sound cannot be recited, the golden tassel cannot be turned, the twin radiances do not descend on the bright hall floating in the void, myriad spirits vanish, true radiances scatter, diligent but fruitless, losing immortality and gathering disaster. This is the root of learning; be cautious not to say otherwise.

Those who do not know the Soul-Spirit Emperor’s name shall not rashly practice the method of controlling and swallowing sun essence. Light practice causes the Nine Heavens Fate Controller to seize the calculation, preventing the sun from descending. Without the yang radiance talisman golden book secret character sound, one must not rashly call the emperor’s name, or lightly stir the supreme truth, bringing grave disaster to the body.

Those who do not know the Soul-Spirit Emperor’s name shall not lightly practice the method of swallowing moonlight. Rash practice causes the Nine Heavens prime minister to erase the name from the registers, preventing the moon from descending. Without the yin radiance talisman golden characters jade script, one must not rashly call the emperor’s name, or the body suffers the yin trial, losing immortality.

To cultivate the supreme dao, swallowing rosy clouds and swallowing qi, swallowing and controlling sun and moon, all must first proceed with the jade pendant and golden tassel yin-yang twin radiances talisman, preserving and thinking of the Three Origins Nine True inner spirits, the two emperors of soul and spirit’s honor, then one may summon the sun and moon’s radiance. Morning and evening, sitting, rising, lying, and resting, always keep in mind the sun above the head, the moon at the mouth, the Soul-Spirit Emperor in the mud pellet, the Corporeal-Spirit Emperor in the bright hall. Mindful and visualizing, constantly making it seem as if, within no more than one year, the true form appears, blue and white clearly divided. After nine years, able to ride the void flying, ascend the morning lamp’s hall, roam the Rainbow Reflection mountain.

### Morning Salutations to the Nine Heavens Soul and Spirit Emperors Seeking the Immortal Supreme Method

Always on the third, ninth, and sixteenth days of the month at dawn, face the sun, bow nine times, perform nine kowtows, or mentally bow, look up and tap teeth twenty-four times through the passes, softly invoking:

*Heavenly soul nine entwinements, supreme emperor honored spirit,  
Sun sun sun essence, golden gate transforming to immortal,  
Small destined one so and so, dare to present humble words,  
Today I report above, eight wishes laid out,  
Please grant the rites and wishes, humbly hoping for mysterious grace,  
Azure dragon and vermilion phoenix, riding purple pavilion,  
Five clouds interweaving shade, six qi fanning dust,  
High and lofty bending hips, three lights descending truth,  
Two radiances entwined, my dao flourishing,  
Heart bright and ears keen, eyes clear and colors fresh,  
Body light and bones rising, face glowing with splendor,  
Feathered robes born form, flying to the imperial dawn.*

Then, facing heaven, draw sun essence forty-five times swallowing and stop. After practicing for three years, eyes become clear and penetrating, seeing the infinite, face with golden countenance, body born of jade fluid. After nine years able to move, no shadow outside the body, flying through the mysterious void.

If the sky is overcast with no sun, practice in a secret chamber with the heart mindful, also feeling the natural response.

Also on the fifth, fifteenth, and twenty-fifth days of the month—these three days are human-determined—face the moon, bow nine times, perform nine kowtows, or mentally bow, look up to the moon, tap teeth sixteen times through the passes, and invoke:

*Soul essence and corporeal spirit, born together in the Nine Heavens,  
Stone radiance and water mother, bright and clear moon,  
Wandering the moon palace, refining the golden court,  
Twin radiances united, auspicious times clear,  
Eight meetings interlaced, I manifest and succeed,  
Wishing for light and countenance, wishing for freshness and glory,  
Wishing for spirit and immortality, flying to Shangqing.*

Then, look up and draw moon essence forty-five times swallowing and stop.

### Profound True Cavern’s Flying Twin Radiance Precious Scripture

All who cultivate the Supreme Firmament dao, preserving and turning the golden tassel and jade pendant methods, must also control the sun and moon essences, to refine the five fetuses’ spirits, summon the five emperors of the sun, the ladies of the moon, the twin radiances’ mysterious reflections, descending the body form, causing the face to have jade luster, the body to produce wondrous light, inside and outside bright and clear, heart sharp and eyes bright. Then the jade pendant may be held, the golden tassel may be turned. The soul and spirit emperors will rest in the child’s chamber, the morning lamp and Rainbow Reflection light, enabling one to stand and ascend.

The *Profound True Scripture* says: Supreme Supreme Profound, twin spirits four bright, profound truth within reflected, bright hall outside clear, swallowing breath of two radiances, longevity spirit essence, supplementing the Fate Controller, overseeing myriad spirits, six flowers filling, thoroughly observing yellow tranquility. In all forty characters, the Supreme One carved them in the southern pavilion of the Phoenix Terrace. Not taught to non-true disciples, nor transmitted to those not Fate Controllers.

Those who wish to cultivate the Profound Truth method, preserving and swallowing sun and moon in the mouth, during the day preserve the sun, at midnight preserve the moon, or preserve without day or night, to distinguish the sun. The sun’s color is red, the moon’s color yellow, the sun has purple light with nine rays, the moon has white light with ten rays. Let the sun and moon face the mouth, nine feet apart, rays shining toward the mouth, rays straight as strings, entering the mouth. Also preserve a woman in the center of the sun and moon, head wrapped in purple kerchief, vermilion brocade cloak and skirt, calling herself the Supreme Profound Upper True Cinnabar Jade Maiden, named Entwining Rotation, styled Secret Truth, mouth exhaling red qi, filling the space between sun and moon light, making it flow with the rays and clouds, all entering my mouth, I swallow it, the maiden also exhales it. Practice ninety swallows to completion. Then perceive the sun and moon’s radiance closely approaching my face, placing the jade maiden’s mouth upon mine, letting qi and liquid descend into my mouth. I softly invoke:

*Supreme Firmament Purple Truth, bright hall yin spirit,  
Sun and moon radiance essence, jade maiden Entwining Rotation,  
First from emptiness born, her character is Secret Truth,  
Crowned with purple splendor, lotus spirit crown,  
Body draped in brocade cloak, cinnabar flying skirt,  
Emerging from the sun entering the moon, heavenly light subtle and fragrant,  
Mouth exhaling crimson qi, pouring into my three origins,  
Face close to the heavenly well, soft spirit controlling soul,  
Profound liquid flowing, fetal essence growing complete,  
Five viscera producing radiance, restoring youthful countenance,  
Overseeing myriad spirits, Fate Controller flying immortal.*

Then, preserve the jade maiden’s mouth saliva, letting it pour into my mouth, I rinse and swallow again, ninety times and stop. Calm the heart and sense the response, practice diligently without limit. If preserving the sun, do not preserve the moon; if preserving the moon, do not preserve the sun. The key is to preserve both evenly. If unable to take it, preserve the twin radiances returning to the bright hall, sun on the left, moon on the right, letting sun and moon radiance shine with the eyes, combining to illuminate and flow the two qi, making them mutually penetrate and pour. One may also always preserve sun and moon in the bright hall, not always needing to wear the twin radiances, but using both together. After five years, the Supreme Profound Jade Maiden will descend to the child, speaking with him. The Supreme Profound Jade Maiden can also divide into dozens of jade maidens, commanded by the child. This accumulates response, condenses essence, transforms into images and visions, the utmost essence, the wondrous response.

The right way of sun rays and moon essence, drawing on the twin radiances’ method, enables one to be spiritually connected and true, body born of jade reflection, commanding myriad spirits, ascending the imperial chamber.

Without the mysterious name in the imperial chart, blue slips in the square, jade storage and purple networks of the Perfected, one can never glimpse the profound writings or chant the spiritual chapters. Those who see it live as long as the Three Lights, those who wear it fly through Shangqing, those who cultivate it become Perfected. Its dao is secret and subtle, not transmitted to the world below. In the past, the True Duke of Zhong Mountain taught the dao of Xia Yu, which is this profound truth method, but only copied in brief, its original old text concerning Entwining Rotation. The True Duke is now the Nine Heavens Ban Official, not yet attaining the imperial true office. Xia Yu also dwells in the Profound Mountain’s administrative division, governing the Five Mountains’ capital. All cultivate the profound truth dao to gradually ascend the Jade Clarity ranks.

The Western City Lord received it from the Queen Mother of the West, now sealed in a pass in Western City Mountain. The Supreme One further instructs, with the left official assisting the jade pendant, the right official assisting the golden tassel. Those who leak the spiritual writings are punished by wind blades, seven ancestors filling the blame, moving stones to fill rivers, souls burdened and robbed, causing loss of scripture.

Those granted the scripture, masters and disciples purify fasting for one hundred days or thirty days. Disciples present two taels of real gold, forty feet of blue patterned silk, ninety feet of white gauze, announce the covenant and then transmit. Following the Supreme Truth’s regulations for covenant and blessings. Light transmission without covenant causes masters and disciples alike to be tested by the left official, seven ancestors filling servitude in the three paths and five sufferings, endless kalpas without reprieve. Be bright and cautious in practice.
