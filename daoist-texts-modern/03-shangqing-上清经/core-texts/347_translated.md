### Scripture of the Jade Radiance of the Nine Heavens, Golden Firmament, Majestic Divine King’s Supreme Primordial Invocation

All who bear predestined fate and are worthy of this text must first enter a solemn covenant, cutting their blood as bond, swearing oaths to the Nine Heavens, before it may be transmitted. According to the Most High Patriarch’s Western Spirit regulations, only three may receive transmission within two thousand two hundred years.

The Jade Radiance Supreme Primordial Great Tiger Talisman is the inner numinous spirit of the Majestic Divine King of the Nine Heavens’ Golden Firmament, a precious script uniting the twin radiances. The dao is wondrously supremely true, qi mingling with the Supreme Primordial; treasured by the Jade Emperor, revered by all emperors. Those who wear it command the essence of radiance, ascend the Nine Mornings, extinguish ghosts and demons, and govern myriad gods. All who behold its script manifest the vigor of true immortals, extending blessings and fortune for seven generations. Yet only after encountering a master’s initiation, enduring the summer fast in austere solitude, shunning worldly dust, may one bear the talisman of the descending spirit, invoke the inner numinous potency, radiate through the vast void, and stir the Three Pure Ones to respond.

At this, the immortals prostrate themselves, evil trials vanish without trace, fate’s signs lengthen in secret caution, overseers watch and judge the merits and faults of one’s path. The Most High Patriarch constantly commands seventy million great armors of the Western Spirit, seven thousand divine tigers, to guard the essence king of radiance, attending the scripture at the Supreme Primordial Western Jade Terrace.

The Essence King of Radiance is the inner name of the Most High Golden Firmament Majestic Divine King. Those who know the name of the Majestic Divine King cause all lower ghosts and spirits to bow and submit to their omens. This divine king is the highest numinous spirit of the primordial jade heaven, the true majesty of the golden firmament divine tiger. Therefore, wearing its script commands the authority of the six heavens; holding its talisman summons the ministers of the Three Officials; honoring its chamber hastens the arrival of the jade brilliance; reciting its invocation opens the tiger’s passage. Its majesty descends through the eight voids, its spirit penetrates the nine mornings; it beheads hordes of demons, strikes down great treachery, commands mountain spirits, subdues river and sea sources, roars across the Ten Directions, marshals fate and immortals, grants longevity equal to the Three Luminaries, its majesty shines upon the Supreme Primordial—truly the wondrous scripture of Shangqing, the majestic seal of radiant essence.

Whoever is granted this divine script must be carefully chosen. Only those with predestined contracts and secret unions, truly destined for immortality, may then petition the Grand Master’s oral command, the Dharma Master’s recommendation, and the Scripture Master’s covenant. They seek the talismanic response of divine spirits, summon the subtle awakening of qi, and scrutinize faint omens to decide the meeting—thus activating the crucial mechanism. If one transmits without the Grand Master’s command or Dharma Master’s endorsement, falsely claiming covenant, even if encountering immortal vigor, jade-name youths, or ancestral omens, they shall be examined by the dark regulations. Therefore, those who transmit without covenant cause the Scripture Master’s death, their souls consigned to the Water Official, and disciples suffer the trial of heavenly fire. Those who covenant but fail to uphold it cause the Scripture Master to perish on the bitter path, disciples transformed by ghosts and demons. Hence, the utmost reverence for covenant and oath, never lightly divulged. Water and fire serve as punishments from different heavens; nine demons become bitter poisons; souls punished, bodies scattered, long tested in the deepest abyss. Though they may wander in grotto dwellings, begging the imperial spirits, their crimes never open; their petitions unheard; the seven mysteries long judged in hell. The immortals’ promise is certain, the heavenly law proves true—how cautious one must be!

If one wishes to drive out the ghosts and spirits of the six heavens, to seize and strike the toxic qi of evil, and to destroy talismanic demons and temples, then secretly perform the Majestic Divine King’s great invocation method. First, knock the teeth thirty-six times, then summon the Essence King of Radiance from the palace of the Six Harmonies’ cave chamber, emerging before one’s face, commanding it to hover one inch above the nose. The Essence King of Radiance appears seven inches long, crowned with white brilliance, clad top and bottom in white brocade robes, mouth exhaling golden true qi, dense and vibrant like white clouds. Command the white cloud qi to flow and fan the four directions, circling the body and advancing forward. Within the white smoke suddenly appears vermilion essence, shining and flying like shooting stars, swiftly transforming into hundreds of divine tigers, leaping forward to strike the captured ghosts and bandits, shattering them utterly. Then one utters the invocation:

Most High Radiance of Bright Majesty, Inner Truth of the Golden Firmament, Essence King of Radiance releases qi to seize the spirit, guarding the secluded dwelling; the Supreme Emperor commands ministers; the radiance of smoke flows and shines, harmonizing the Nine Heavens; majestic script shines forth; divine tiger opens the passage; spiritual clouds gather thickly; vermilion essence fans the void; seven transformations of the script’s men; true power wielded in the Nine Firmaments. Whoever dares oppose me shall be beheaded, evil trials subdued, demons and treacheries crushed and erased, ten thousand demons extinguished; twin radiances combined to suppress with the Majestic King, ascending to the imperial morning, Supreme Primordial’s wondrous freedom, protect my integrity and virtue.

When the invocation ends, knock the teeth thirty-six times again, then one may exterminate talismanic demons, subdue myriad gods, disperse cold spirits, and capture the six heavens. Thus, thousands of demons and myriad poisons have already perished before the invocation.

This Majestic King’s invocation is profound and weighty, treasured by the high transcendents. Its script is all concealed in the Nine Heavens’ Jade Clarity above, on the Supreme Primordial Western Spirit’s terrace. A precious forbidden method, never transmitted to the world, except by the great law of the Golden Name Feather Register King. Those overflowing with mysterious celebration will never see the great law of the Majestic King. Only those who ascend to high immortality, as lords and ministers of Shangqing, and guests of the imperial morning, may bear this talisman. When one begins the great invocation, the High Primordial arrays the reins, the Emperor dances in the firmament, golden true spirits swiftly advance, the Essence King of Radiance commands the quarters, the mysterious dragon spits poison, the divine tiger roars on the right, beheading and destroying ten thousand demons, cutting down a thousand monsters; the six heavens collapse before it, mountains and rivers awaken to greet the dawn, jade brilliance arrives at the chamber, purple youths turn their covers, the heavenly sovereign aids the majesty, the Nine Firmaments are serene and grand, evil poisons and coldness vanish, water conquers fire, a thousand billion hills are swept away, the eight voids break open. Thus, spirits are at peace, qi harmonized, no obstruction or stagnation; golden radiance and morning spirits, immortals united in accord, serve my divine talisman, mysterious blessings for ten thousand generations.

### Great Tiger Talisman of the Jade Radiance of the Nine Heavens, Golden Firmament, Majestic Divine King’s Supreme Primordial Invocation

Should one face urgent peril or trembling fear, simply secretly call the Essence King of Radiance’s name three times, holding the spirit clearly in mind as if it protects one’s left and right; then a thousand disasters and ten thousand calamities will all be averted, treacheries extinguished, demons and poisons all perish. Also, before sleep, knock twice seven times and recite the divine name, ensuring the soul and spirit are guarded, corpses and ghosts sealed, evil dreams banished, and misfortune removed.

Those who transmit this scripture, Scripture Masters and disciples must observe a twenty-one-day fast and covenant, delivering the scripture at day’s end. The covenant uses thirty-seven feet each of plain silk, gauze, and blue gauze, with a pair of golden fish each weighing one tael, as the Most High Western Spirit’s precious forbidden bond. These tokens must be returned to the Grand Master and Dharma Master’s gates, to serve the common use of divine spirits. If privately cut for self-benefit, greedily profiting, and not following the heavenly law’s covenant, those who display great faith at the covenant’s start shall have the Scripture Master’s seven mysteries ancestors tortured in the Northern Abyss prison, never to attain immortal fruit.

The method of bearing this talisman is to write it in vermilion on white silk, three feet long, placed in a purple brocade pouch, worn before the heart. When performing divine invocations, one must always wear it.

Those who wear this talisman command heaven and earth’s ghosts and gods, drive out and strike the cold spirits of the six heavens, destroy the vicious qi of the nine demons, extend their fate in heaven and earth, govern high immortals at the Supreme Ultimate, imprint the spirit talisman on the body, manifest the Majestic King’s great law; divine officials bow and worship, golden soldiers assist and guard, water and fire both pass through—observe the lasting power. Therefore, the Three Officials and Northern Emperor dare not breach its gap.

Once the omen accepts the divine script, it is only to be treasured for court rites and ceremonies, not casually worn among the human world. If the precious script is lightly revealed, or the Majestic King’s name proclaimed, the Most High will have the seven mysteries ancestors tortured by poison, devoured by the divine tiger’s mouth; the omen’s soul and fetus will be sealed in hell; body and life destroyed by water and fire punishments; for seven hundred years then transformed into warts and sores, inflicting leprous diseases upon nine clans’ kin. Those two masters who lightly act thus, and disciples who recklessly accept the script, suffer the same punishment.

Those who ascend to immortality must wear the descending spirit talisman and pay homage at the upper palace. Written in vermilion on white silk, seven feet long, shaped like a five-inch wide belt. Using plain gauze or green silk one zhang four feet long, fashioned as a yellow waistcoat, also following talismanic methods, worn at the waist. This is the so-called phoenix script tiger belt descending the seven primordials. Those who fast long and attend court rites all wear it.

### Descending Spirit Talisman

### Golden Tiger True Talisman of the Supreme Emperor of the Great Subtle Heaven

The Golden Tiger True Talisman of the Supreme Emperor of the Great Subtle Heaven is concealed in the Supreme Primordial Upper Radiance Jade Palace. Poisonous beasts stretch ten thousand fathoms; it strikes demons and guards the scripture. Seven thousand divine tigers stand ready at the Jade Gate; three hundred Western Jade Maidens scatter fragrance in the firmament court; the Five Elders’ classic texts; golden morning attendants of truth. Without the Jade Register and Jade Name, carved on the Three Pure Ones’ slips, none may obtain the Golden Tiger’s inner talisman or hear the Most High’s jade chapters. This talisman originally carved in the Shangqing jade slip wisdom chapter contains seven hundred thousand words; its spiritual sound and wondrous dao are subtle and difficult to explain; sometimes veiling heavenly demons’ secrets, sometimes revealing myriad gods’ inner names, sometimes clarifying obscure metaphors through jade sounds. A certain minor lord copied out this talisman and the Majestic Divine King’s inner script method to govern the myriad spirits of heaven and earth, totaling only one hundred words. This invocation is wondrous and secret, called the *Three Heavens Tiger Script Supreme Primordial Upper Register*. Recipients first fast seventy days, bearing the golden tiger jade bell, plain silk, and mysterious gauze each thirty feet, as the golden truth’s oath, covenanting with heaven and earth’s inappropriate accords. Following the Four Extremes’ bright regulations, only three may transmit it within seven hundred years.

The Golden Tiger Jade Essence True Talisman of the Supreme Emperor of the Great Subtle Heaven is the inner incense of the Supreme Primordial Upper Radiance’s natural golden seal. It commands golden immortals, seals mountains and summons clouds, shakes the six heavens with majesty, beheads myriad gods. The Most High constantly commands seventy million great armors of the Western Spirit to guard talismans in the Great Subtle Jade Palace. Those who wear this talisman command heaven and earth, scold and order the myriad spirits, control and drive the radiant dragon; their position governs high immortals. When the jade sound trembles, jade brilliance waits nearby; golden true guards and soldiers cause a thousand demons to lose their gaze, ten thousand ghosts to lose form, nine demons all bow, the six heavens collapse. The dao is wondrously supremely true, spirits gather the five numinous, left howls the mysterious youth, right seizes the golden morning. Great indeed is this precious script, the supreme emperor’s majestic truth—not merely to repel poisons and banish trials, or destroy demons, but to seek the dao’s wondrous essence and attain true standard.

This golden tiger true talisman, the Supreme Emperor of the Great Subtle Heaven transmits to the Golden Gate Emperor. Written in vermilion on white silk, placed in a purple brocade pouch, worn on the head when going out, it commands fate, heaven, and earth’s myriad spirits; immortals revere it; jade brilliance scatters like a scarf; heavenly soldiers guard the body; mountain troops command spirits; adding the majesty divine invocation, the jade essence seal; then one may behead and rejoice, nine demons perish, a thousand monsters lose form. This Shangqing forbidden talisman is never transmitted to the world; those who obtain it ascend to Shangqing.

### Supreme Primordial Upper Radiance Golden True Majestic Divine Inner Invocation

This invocation commands the right divine soldiers to behead and destroy evil souls. When entering the chamber, burn incense, knock the teeth thirty-six times, sit or lie at will, then invoke:

Repel the Dry Poison King, shake the Shiluo banner, the Eight Immortals wield axes, the Supreme Emperor commands the five spirits, the Great Mysterious casts radiance, the Seven Mornings guard the court, the Yellow True Radiance talisman, blazing and casting fire bells, the divine tiger leaps fiercely, venomous blades wildly present, purple flourishing ritual, four leaps and cries, Nine Heavens and Six Heavens, Four Heavens’ bright crystals, outer coils of mysterious qi, inner guards of master soldiers, left majesty, right vigilance, wind strikes, fire conquers, shouting to behead ten thousand demons, crush and behead a thousand spirits, golden heavenly majesty shakes. Nine demons seize forms and are delivered to the Northern Feng to be destroyed; all who perish collapse. I wear the true talisman and command myriad spirits; the Three Primordials report to the mysterious union emperor sincerely; the Great Subtle Heaven commands; ascending to the Three Pure Ones.

The Supreme Primordial Upper Radiance Majestic Divine Inner Invocation method is all Shangqing’s forbidden scripture. The Dry Poison King is the inner name of the six heavens’ great demon. The shaking Shiluo banner is the Northern Emperor Demon King’s secret name. The Four Heavens’ bright crystals are the soul names of the Northern Feng ghosts. Those who know the three demon names cause a thousand demons to flee, ten thousand ghosts to hide form, nine demons unable to move; try to observe but cannot manifest. Alone in mountains and forests, or among talismanic temples with spirits and ghosts, one may act accordingly without incense or entering chambers.

Also, write in orpiment on blue gauze, three feet long, one foot two inches wide, or square one foot two inches on each side. Outline in vermilion with cinnabar brocade edging the wrapping, wear on the right side of the waist. When fasting and entering chambers, or attending the eight primordial court feasts, commanding demons and summoning spirits, driving and marshaling divine truths, wear and act accordingly. Beware not to face corpses or filth; the penalty is the same as leakage, the seven mysteries ancestors tortured in hell.
