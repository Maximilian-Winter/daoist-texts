### The Supreme Scripture of the Numinous Golden Elixir of the Purple Script of the Great Microcosm

First, one must fast in the mountains and forests for forty days, refraining from all worldly affairs. Then proceed to craft the sacred clay vessel, a process lasting one hundred days, until the clay cauldron is complete. Select fire-resistant clay pots capable of holding three dou, neither white nor red in any spot, but able to endure the fire without cracking or breaking.

The method to prepare the sacred clay is as follows: take six parts of oyster shells from the left shore of the Eastern Sea, three parts of earth from the burrowing mole cricket, one part of fine horse hair shed naturally, three parts of talc, three parts of red ochre, two parts of fine goat hair, and half a part of large wash water—seven substances in all. Pound these together and sift finely, then mix with a hundred-day-old fermented malt liquor, pounding with thirty thousand pestle strikes. If the clay is too muddy, add more red ochre; if too stiff, add more malt liquor. Pound again until the clay is fine and smooth.

Choose oyster shells wrapped in white, avoiding the outer bone-like skin. First cleanse and select horse and goat hair, then separately sift mole cricket earth, ensuring all are pure and free from coarse impurities. The portions mentioned are not by weight but by volume sufficient to make two clay cauldrons, the quantities balanced for all materials combined.

The two clay cauldrons’ walls—inside and outside—must be seven fen thick. Apply gradually: first a thin layer of clay, dry it in shade until crisp, then add more clay, repeating until the thickness reaches seven fen. After the seven-fen layer is complete, dry it again, then mix malt liquor with cinnabar, pounding thirty thousand times until it becomes clay-like. Apply this mixture inside and outside the two cauldrons, three fen thick. If cracking appears, add more clay and dry in shade for ten days to prevent cracking.

Cinnabar here refers to lead cinnabar; do not apply this mixture on the outer surface of the clay. Once the medicine is placed inside, seal it tightly with refined clay, filling all joints to ensure airtightness. Then apply another clay layer, covering the outside top, bottom, and all four sides, four fen thick. After drying in shade, place the vessel in a secure place for twenty-seven days. If fine cracks appear on the outside, use goat whiskers as brushes to paint clay into the cracks, drying again for seven days. The outer layer should then be about one cun and four fen thick—this is ideal.

Thus, the sacred clay vessel is complete, and the medicine is enclosed within.

This clay preparation method is a simplified version of the ninefold refining cauldron of the Golden Elixir, but the clay must be made extremely fine and pure, carefully balanced and skillfully handled, surpassing even the ninefold cauldron. Be meticulous and prevent the essence from leaking or dispersing; if it does, the effort is wasted and the fasting and offerings lose their efficacy.

According to the lunar calendar, change the fasting day, then fast another one hundred days. Upon completion, pour three dou of fine wine into the eastern flowing water and, facing the water, recite the prayer:

> Great Mysterious Azure Stream,  
> Eight Seas and Nine Rivers,  
> Mountain Spirits and Earth Deities,  
> Guardians of the Elixir’s Essence,  
> With three dou of fine wine,  
> I solemnly honor the River Spirit.

Having finished, do not look back, then on that day place the medicine into the cauldron.

When making the elixir, choose a secluded mountain forest by the eastern flowing water, a place untouched by human footsteps, where the sounds of chickens and dogs cannot be heard—such a place is most auspicious. Be cautious.

The ingredients of the Numinous Golden Elixir are as follows:

- Ten jin of Scarlet Ridge Vermilion, code name: Cinnabar.
- Five jin of Sun Soul from the Vermilion Mountain, code name: Realgar.
- One jin of White Soaring Dragon, code name: White Quartz.
- Five liang of Azure Waist Maiden, code name: Celadon.
- Five liang of Purple Ridge Marquis, code name: Amethyst.
- Five liang of Jade City Flying Splendor, code name: Lapis Lazuli.
- One jin of Northern Emperor’s Mysterious Pearl, code name: Niter.
- Five liang of Nine Numinous Yellow Child, code name: Sulfur.
- Five liang of Five Spirits Golden Sheep, code name: Yangqi Stone Core.
- Five liang of Rain Splendor Flying Essence, code name: Mica.
- Five liang of White Tiger Shedding Teeth, code name: Golden Tooth Stone.
- One jin of Flowing Vermilion White Paste, code name: White Lead.
- Five liang of Reverse Walking Divine Bone, code name: Rong Salt.
- Five jin of Mysterious Terrace Moon Splendor, code name: Orpiment.

Fourteen kinds in total, each separately pounded in order, beginning with cinnabar, each receiving five thousand pestle strikes. The pounders must be careful and temperate, avoiding excessive speech. They must fast for thirty days before pounding. When combining the medicines, only three or four people may be present. Such persons are hard to find in harmonious accord; if even one is discordant, the entire work is spoiled.

When the Numinous Golden Elixir is complete, one liang constitutes one immortal dose; if one wishes to remain in the mortal world, half a liang may be taken.

After all pounding is finished, place the medicine carefully into the cauldron. First place the Rong wash at the bottom, then niter, then mica, then yangqi stone, then golden tooth stone, then white lead, then celadon, then sulfur, then white quartz, then lapis lazuli, then amethyst, then orpiment, then realgar, and cinnabar alone on top.

All fourteen kinds must be evenly spread in order, filling the cauldron with slight layering. Then pour three jin of mercury over the medicines; this completes the filling.

Next, place the outer clay cauldron, sealing the flat joint with cinnabar clay, and the outer joint with oyster clay. Dry in shade, then apply clay all around the outside—top, bottom, and four sides—to a thickness of four fen.

The furnace house foundation is first dug, removing all impure earth three chi deep, then filling with good earth, compacted full. On the level earth, build the foundation two chi five cun high. Do not build the furnace on old tombs or former homestead ruins.

The furnace house should be three zhang long, one zhang six chi wide, and one zhang six chi high, clean and well maintained, covered with good grass, the clay walls inside and out made firm and dense. The main gates face due east and due south, each four chi wide, closed at dusk.

The fire tender and master remain inside the chamber. Place a turtle shell under the center of the house. The furnace mouth faces east, built with fine bricks and stones. Use bitter wine and eastern flowing water to pound fine white earth mixed with hair from oxen, horses, deer, and antelope into clay, and use this to plaster the furnace.

Inside the furnace, place an iron frame to hold the medicine cauldron centrally. The cauldron should be three cun and a half away from the furnace walls on all sides. The furnace height exceeds the cauldron by two chi; the cauldron bottom is one chi eight cun above the earth.

Use good chaff fire beneath to heat, maintaining the fire about one chi away from the cauldron. Adjust carefully to avoid fierce, violent flames. After twenty days, reduce the fire to six cun below the cauldron; after another twenty days, reduce to four cun; after another twenty days, reduce to one cun; after ten days, bring fire close under the cauldron; after ten days more, raise fire halfway up the cauldron; then after another twenty days, the full one hundred days are complete and the medicine is formed.

Let it cool for three days before activating it. The flying splendor will lightly settle atop the cauldron. Use feathers from a three-year-old male rooster to sweep it; the splendor should display thirty-seven colors, flowing and radiant like purple clouds and mysterious brilliance, named the Numinous Golden Elixir.

On the first day of the eleventh, fourth, and eighth lunar months, at dawn, face the king and bow twice, then take one liang with the eastern flowing water. The head will emit seven-colored qi; the face will shine with golden radiance and jade luster. Holding breath will immediately summon the Eight Mystical Chariots; spitting on the ground transforms into a flying dragon; a left whistle calls immortals to court; a right finger summons the three pure winds, with thousands of chariots and ten thousand riders flying to the Upper Clarity.

If the elixir’s splendor has not fully risen, one may again seal the two clay cauldrons’ joint as before, making it airtight, and reheat the cauldron’s belly, pausing for forty-nine days—then it will surely complete.

### The Yellow Water Moon Splendor Elixir Method

Fire the cauldron for one hundred days, forming the Numinous Golden Elixir. Do not activate it yet. Begin firing anew, following the initial method and fire control measures, for another one hundred days, totaling two hundred days.

Cool it for six nights, then activate it and observe. The myriad essences gather atop the cauldron forming a curtain. Within the curtain is yellow water, and on the water yellow splendor, resembling a lotus flower, named Yellow Water Moon Splendor.

The curtain hovers above the cauldron like a mysterious gallbladder. Scoop and take it. Eating the splendor and drinking one sheng of the yellow water causes the body to divide and transform endlessly; the eyes become bright moons, floating through the vast cosmos, flying to the Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace.

### The Circulating Water Jade Essence Elixir Method

Fire the medicine cauldron for two hundred days, transforming into Yellow Water Moon Splendor. Do not activate it yet. Begin firing anew as before for one hundred days, totaling three hundred days.

Cool it for nine nights, then activate it. The myriad essences form a bud atop the cauldron. Within the bud is white water, like jade paste, swirling and moving constantly leftward within the bud.

Within the white water are three bright pearls, each the size of a chicken egg, named Circulating Water Jade Essence. Its flavor is a hundredfold sweetness, fragrant and soft as candy.

Taking one pearl causes immediate union with Heaven; the body produces water and fire; spitting breath forms jade; the form transforms into the sun; the Heavenly Emperor descends to welcome, riding the radiance to ascend to the Upper Clarity.

Dig a pit seven chi deep and wide; take the Numinous Golden Elixir and mix with circulating water equal to the size of a chicken egg; plant it in the pit, restore the earth, and build firmly for three years.

Above grows a tree with red fruit like jujubes, three or four chi high, its fruit shaped like rings, named the Ringed Hard Tree. Eating its fruit causes union with Heaven, ascending to the Great Ultimate, transforming into clouds—also called the Great Ultimate Hidden Ganoderma.

Dig a pit six chi deep and wide; plant one ringed fruit, irrigate with five he of yellow water, restore the earth, build firmly for three years.

Above grows grass like gourds, its fruit like peaches, five-colored, named Phoenix Brain Ganoderma. Eating its fruit ascends to the Great Ultimate; spitting on the ground transforms into a phoenix, which one may ride to soar—also called the Great Ultimate Hidden Ganoderma.

Dig a pit one zhang deep and wide; take four he of yellow water and one phoenix brain fruit, plant together, irrigate the fruit with yellow water, restore the earth, build firmly for three years.

Above grows a red tree like pine, five or six chi high, its fruit like pears, seeds pure white as jade. Eating its fruit ascends to the Great Microcosm; spitting on the ground transforms into blue jade.

Dig a pit eight chi deep and wide; plant red tree seeds, irrigate with five he of circulating water, restore the earth, build firmly for three years.

Above grows a crimson tree like plum, six or seven chi high, bearing green fruit like jujubes, color green as emerald. Eating its fruit ascends to the Purple Tenuity; spitting on the ground transforms into gold, enabling one to ride the mysterious clouds and travel.

### The Water Yang Blue Reflecting Liquid Method

Take one sheng five he each of yellow water and circulating water, three sheng total, and boil in a small iron vessel until seven boils, transforming into a blue water named Water Yang Blue Reflecting.

At dawn, drink it all at once; the body will shine with blue jade light, the mouth exhales purple smoke, ascending to the Upper Clarity. Spitting on the ground forms cinnabar in eight stones.

Boil one jin of lead and two liang of mercury in an iron vessel to a fierce boil; throw in one zhu of Numinous Golden Elixir; after a moment, it becomes true silver.

Boil one jin of lead and five liang of mercury; throw in three zhu of Numinous Golden Elixir; after a moment, it becomes purple gold.

When gold and silver are formed, cast one hundred jin each into the eastern flowing water, forming cakes weighing fifty jin each. Facing the water, recite the incantation:

> Heavenly River Weaver Maiden,  
> Earthly Stream Water Elder,  
> Great Elixir forming splendor,  
> Immortal souls refining spirits,  
> Long departing the earth,  
> Ascending as imperial guests,  
> Bearing twin precious discs,  
> To guard the source and marsh.

Having finished the prayer, return without looking back.

To plant the sacred tree, choose a famous mountain’s shady side for the pit, keeping all four sides free from human or beast tracks crossing above.

The Sovereign Lord of the Supreme Heaven of the Later Saints, having studied the dao from youth, received secret teachings and practices, becoming the Emperor of the Golden Gate.

The Five Elders, Supreme Truths, and the Left Wearied Lord of the Great Ultimate compiled the *Numinous Scripture of the Purple Script*, commanding the Eastern Palace’s Azure Youth Lord to transmit and carve the mysterious names, intended for true perfected beings.

This is the Most High’s secret speech, the Later Saint’s Purple Script.

The methods of the Bright Lords of the Four Extremities are to be transmitted only thrice within seven hundred years. If within a hundred years two persons are qualified, they may be taught, but must swear to transmit to only three persons within seven hundred years. Beyond this limit, no further transmission is permitted.

When transmitting, the recipient must fast seven days before receiving the teachings.

Ten Supreme Spiritual Officials, ten Jade Maidens, and ten Jade Youths attend the scripture, guarding and monitoring, reporting merits and faults.

Those who seek immortality must be clear and cautious from the start. The method requires establishing oaths and pledges to prevent leakage.

The Later Saint’s Purple Script records the ranks of the holy lords, their garments glowing with absorbed clouds, receiving enlightenment from yin and yang, and the heavenly emperor’s talisman, as well as the scriptures on soul capture and spirit control.

The scripture’s master carries forty chi of white silk, two pairs of silver rings, and four liang of white silk as a substitute for blood oaths, sealing the secret with unbroken trust.

Those receiving the *Numinous Golden Elixir Supreme Scripture* must have masters bearing golden dragons and jade fish, replacing engraved stone oaths to ensure no leaks.

Ancient sovereigns treasured the precious divine scriptures, guarding against careless disclosure, hence the solemn oaths and strict warnings to prevent leakage, demonstrating sincerity and clarifying origins.

Those who fail to observe the rules or leak the Later Saint’s Purple Script records shall incur the Three Ancestors and parents’ wrath: punished by water and fire in life, judged by the Three Officials after death, becoming lower ghosts, having immortal registers erased, cast into the Northern Qi stones, attached to Mount Tai, drawn into the Western Ford waters, and sent to the Eastern Sea. Let all be cautious.

All medicines use ancient names, now refined to the utmost.

The Azure Youth Lord, named Fanmei, is preserved every eight festival days.

The Lord Wang says: The oaths of the golden dragon and jade fish are rare in the world and cannot be sealed after the expiration of their term.

Above is the standard of thirty chi of blue cloth for the oath. Blue signifies refined heart; cloth signifies spreading sincerity.
