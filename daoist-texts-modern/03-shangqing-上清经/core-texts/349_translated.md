## Supreme Clarity Primordial Transformations Precious True Supreme Scripture of the Nine Numinous, Most Sublime Turtle Mountain Mysterious Register — Scroll One

The Supreme Clarity Treasure Scripture, established at the dawn of the Nine Heavens, all arise naturally, coexisting with qi. The three luminaries shine in unison, revealing the Nine Heavens above, amidst the vast void. Sometimes it weaves flying mysterious purple qi, forming numinous script—celestial writings wondrous and intricate, their strokes twisting and turning, characters each a square of ten zhang, elusive to detailed comprehension. None but the True Kings of the Nine Heavens can fathom their meaning or sound.

Above the Nine Heavens, in the first year of the Void, the Mysterious Capital Supreme True forged gold into slips; the assembly of sages illuminated meanings, compiling the highest secret formulas into spiritual chapters. The Jade Emperor inscribed notes, carving slips into chapters, arranging them with the order of bow and glance, each with strict hierarchical prohibitions and limits; the categories fully reveal the subtle intentions of the exalted sages. Sealed above the Nine Heavens, within the grand palace’s jade chambers, guarded by the Western Splendor Jade Maidens and the Pure Spirit Palace’s Golden Dawn Purple Boys.

The Western Turtle Mountain, also called Dragon Mountain, is the root and nexus of the Nine Heavens, the abyssal treasury of myriad qi. It lies at the northwest corner of Heaven, encircling four hundred thousand li, towering to connect with Jade Clarity. To the southeast it links with the rosy mists of Yang, ascending to the Azure Palace’s Divine Tiger Gate; to the northwest it joins the cold caverns’ wilderness, opening to the Golden Gate of the Divine Immortals’ Court; southward it reaches the land of the Great Elixir Floating Dawn, where qi harmonizes with the light of the Yang Cavern; northward it points to Gouchen, intersecting the canopy of Hua, with qi treading broad numinosity; the center thrusts straight into the Jade Capital’s Eightfold Wind-Interchange Mountain summit.

The sky is thirty thousand li wide, all encircled by golden walls, with jade gates, golden terraces, and jade towers, twelve divine palaces. Above rests the Hall of Natural Flowing Essence, the Purple Pavilion of Golden Radiance, the Jade Chamber of Exquisite Splendor, adjoining the nine caverns’ grottoes, spontaneously generating purple qi clouds, interlaced with phoenix patterns, nine colors arrayed in formation. Cliffs sprout purple laurels, ridges flourish with jade forests, coral forms branches, jade roots planted deep; soaring trees bear fruit, red infants with white rings, three blossoms gleaming in vermilion light, fragrant flow returning in the Great Mystery, eight airs fan the long winds, jade flutes sing in the void, dragons roar in cloud towers, phoenixes cry across the peaks, venomous beasts myriad as nets, serpents a thousand zhang long, divine palaces majestic, cloud immortals myriad and bustling, the lofty primordial hall, all things issuing forth nectar.

This is the wondrous transformation of the Primordial Origin, truly the spiritual root of Heaven’s Origin. In the Hall of Golden Radiance, above the northern window, purple qi spontaneously forms mysterious script, characters each a square of ten zhang, hanging rays shining bright, celestial writings wondrous and intricate, beyond detailed seeking.

The Nine Heavens Elder, in the former first year of the Upper Jia, purified in the Cloud Palace, feasted at Turtle Mountain, carved golden slips, copied mysterious script, explained its lingering blockages, unfolded its numinous sounds, recording it as the *Turtle Mountain Elixir Sovereign Flying Mysterious Purple Script*. The Queen Mother of the West, on the first year of the Kaihuang era, first month, early Yin day, rode the void, drifting in spirit, roaming the Nine Skies, purifying at Turtle Mountain, ascending the Hall of Natural Flowing Essence, Purple Pavilion, Golden Radiance, and Jade Hall, touring the northern window, paying homage to the mysterious script, gazing at cliffs contemplating spirit, heart pondering the Supreme True.

Then a wondrous response and profound awakening arose, the cinnabar heart made manifest. Suddenly appeared a heavenly true great god, bearing sun and moon, neck adorned with round light, from the assembly of immortals and feathered canopies, riding a flying chariot of purple clouds, nine essences streaming through the skies, kneeling before the Queen Mother, proclaiming:

“I am the Nine Heavens Phoenix Palace Leading Immortal King, surname Supreme Mysterious, styled Enlightened. By command of the Primordial Heavenly King, I bring the Nine Heavens’ golden script with purple characters, the Azure Gold Elixir Sovereign’s text, bestowed upon the Queen Mother. Bestowed the title Western Origin Nine Numinous Supreme True Immortal Mother, enfeoffed over the Western Turtle Mountain. Also granted a pure script scroll, the Supreme True Primordial Transformations Original Register, overseeing the immortal registers, inheriting Jade Clarity. Also given a blue jade tablet, the Nine Heavens Phoenix robe of flying blue feathers, the morning infant jade crown and phoenix cloud shoes, the divine phoenix purple wheel flying feather canopy with twenty-four chariots, five-colored banners commanding the spirit’s rhythm. Further, seven hundred Golden Radiance Jade Maidens of the Upper Palace attend the Immortal Mother. They govern the Hall of Flowing Essence, Purple Pavilion, Golden Radiance, and Jade Hall, ascending to Jade Clarity thrice monthly, feasting again at Kunlun, inspecting the assembly of immortals.”

Thus the heavenly true great god completed the bestowal and returned to the Jade Palace. The Immortal Mother then accepted the mandate, ascended the throne, reported at the Jade Hall, commanding attendant maidens Wangzi Deng and Dong Shuangcheng, etc., to receive with divine light brocade scarves the golden script with purple characters and the blue jade tablet, the Azure Gold Elixir Sovereign’s bestowed text, Supreme True Primordial Transformations Original Register, Flying Mysterious Purple Script, four items in all, sealed with the Elixir Sovereign’s seal, stored within the Jade Chamber.

She commanded thirty Golden Radiance Jade Maidens and thirty Purple Dawn Jade Boys to guard the numinous script. According to the old Three Heavens’ order of bow and glance, she reported to the Five Emperors, the Five Peaks, the numinous mountains, rivers, and seas’ true gods, all commanding the five monthly reports of students’ names and their merits and faults, ranked and reported accordingly.

The Immortal Mother often, on the eighth day of each solar term and five times monthly, feasted at the Cloud Palace, visiting the Five Peaks, inspecting river sources, roaming the eight extremes. At such times, the five stars emerge in division, the sun and moon halt their light, a hundred yangs stir lightning, flowing gold radiates essence, heavenly spirits lead the way, five elders wield banners. The Immortal Mother rides a nine-colored carriage, purple clouds flying wheels, accompanied by five thousand celestial jade maidens. The females ride phoenixes, the males wield dragons, all in flying immortal feather robes, each holding splendid banners, flutes, and drums, a hundred harmonies blending, phoenix songs and dragon cries, stirring bright clouds, radiant splendor interwoven, the three luminaries merge in brilliance.

The Purple Boys raise incense to dispel filth, divine consorts scatter blossoms to water truth, heavenly balance plays its banners, purple smoke veils the void court, jade scenes flow and glance in the vast space, divine transformations command myriad spirits. At such times, the six heavens obey the mandate, all demons bound, magicians lose sight, the sky bright and air clear—this is the wondrous vision of the exalted immortals, marking the cave spirit of the Elixir Sovereign.

### Turtle Mountain Elixir Sovereign Flying Mysterious Purple Script

Flying mysterious purple qi condenses the spiritual root, the framework of jade emptiness governs myriad gods. In the void it flourishes, forming nature; above rise the towering twelve transmissions, jade towers soaring beyond cloud vistas, flowing essence Purple Pavilion with golden pavilions, jade halls dazzling around eight peaks, from within emerge the Azure Gold Nine Numinous Immortals.

The Elixir Sovereign True Mother named Essence Extension, flying blue feathered Xie, holding a jade scepter in the left, grasping a spiritual banner in the right, five-colored commanding demons, facing the imperial sovereign, holding the talismanic registers at the birth gate, chewing moon, biting sun, sipping jade springs, exhaling brilliance, refining the five souls, filling inside and overflowing outside the crimson mansion with joy.

Golden light dazzling, form perfectly round, entering the new moon into golden chaos. Only the Enlightened can understand these words. On the tenth day of the fifth month of the Northern Origin, carved are the imperial canopy leading immortal lords, purple qi circling left with the Dipper’s movement, passing through four and seven into the golden gate.

Truly the Elixir Sovereign inspects myriad immortals, diligently adding essence, shaping form and secret thoughts, each division ordered. Wondrous scenes and meetings grasp the essential text. Three years to examine and preserve completeness, nine years to ride the void donning feather skirts, phoenix robes lightly soaring to Dragon Mountain, bowing and glancing to the Nine Numinous to greet the Jade Morning.

The Southern Pole Supreme Origin Lord said: “This is the script of condensed purple qi flying mysteriously, carved on the Western Turtle Mountain, above the northern window of the Hall of Flowing Essence, Purple Pavilion, Golden Radiance, and Jade Hall. The Nine Heavens Elder viewed this chapter, recording it as the *Turtle Mountain Elixir Sovereign Flying Mysterious Purple Script*. The Queen Mother of the West always treasures it in secret; its meaning is profound and hidden, all is the wondrous rhyme of the Nine Heavens. It has no immortal name, and its chapters cannot be casually numbered. Those who obtain it are all recorded in the Nine Heavens’ registers, titled Turtle Mountain.”

The Nine Heavens Elder said: “To cultivate its way, always on the first, second, third, fourth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, eleventh, and twelfth months; on the third, fifth, ninth, fifteenth, and twenty-fifth days; five times monthly, purify and chant the text once through. After midnight, when dew appears in the courtyard, gaze up at the Northern Dipper’s imperial canopy; purple clouds arise from the Dipper’s left loop, passing through the twenty-eight constellations, returning above the golden gate.

If one’s human sky is dark and without light, then silently recite and inwardly contemplate as above, making all clear. After contemplation, bow to the purple clouds four times, knock teeth three times, and raise the gaze to pray:

‘Heaven bright and clear at night, the secluded void opens truth, flowing clouds linger, golden radiance encircles four camps, the Elixir Sovereign spreads brilliance, spirit flies the purple pavilion, this evening opens the formation, Azure Gold grants immortality, fulfills my highest vow, body responds to nature, binds fate with moonlight, preserves year and day roots, three spirits unite in radiance, forever halting at Dragon Mountain, secret night’s feelings unfold, please as spoken.’

Afterward, orally draw in purple qi through twenty-eight swallows and stop. Practice this for three years, and divine true signs will descend to the sleeping chamber. The body will have purple qi, reflecting a single form; the Nine Heavens’ script named, one will surely ascend as a supreme immortal.”

The Nine Heavens Elder said: “Heavenly writings are layered in myriad folds, each discussing its wondrous subtlety. Such a matter alone suffices to bring down the spiritual true, to shake wings in the Nine Skies, soar to Jade Clarity, and feast in the Cloud Palace. Without this wondrous method, the Queen Mother of the West would not keep it secret within her robes; even the Great August Sovereign would not understand its prohibitions.”

The Southern Pole Supreme Origin Lord said: “Heaven has clouds of forbidden qi, affecting the divisions of sun, moon, and five stars; in their respective domains, there are those who harmonize with the dao and become sovereign immortals. Such portents naturally reveal themselves.”

The Nine Heavens Elder said: “When you see this cloud, follow the written rites and prayers; it need not be on a fixed day. Diligently attend to it; when the cloud descends, ascends, and gathers, it may be sealed in the heart. Do not lightly show it to others; if the dao leaks, the spirit disperses, and immortals cannot respond.”

### Primordial Bestowal to the Queen Mother of the West of the Azure Gold Elixir Sovereign Jade Text

The Most High Primordial declares to the numinous Nine Heavens and the vast void ancestors. The Queen Mother of the West, named Wanqin, truly embodies the qi of the Nine Numinous, blending the essence of Western Gold, forming the purple cloud’s fetal bones, refining the radiance of sun essence, inhaling and exhaling the brilliance of the seven luminaries, harmonizing with morning mists and feasting on the phoenix marrow of the sun, sipping the moon essence and orchid brain, condensing into jade root and golden treasury, binding into cinnabar form, entwining the purple heart, manifesting in the Elixir Sovereign’s wondrous diagram, prominently displayed in the imperial pavilion, resting in the spiritual mountain, heart aflame with purity, her merit aiding myriad beings, grace overflowing life, holding the rhythm alone, enduring through kalpas.

Hence the Most High bestowed upon her. Because Wanqin possesses the virtue of golden truth, she was bestowed the title of Meditation Western Origin Nine Numinous Supreme True Immortal Mother, Azure Gold Elixir Sovereign, enfeoffed over Turtle Mountain, overseeing the primordial register, according to the bow and glance of the blue jade tablet, golden script, and jade characters; given the Nine Heavens’ phoenix robe of flying blue feathers, morning infant jade crown and phoenix cloud shoes, divine phoenix purple wheel flying feather canopy with twenty-four chariots, five-colored banners commanding the spirit’s rhythm, flowing gold fire bells and night-light candles, demon-dispelling jade seals of the Nine Heavens’ harmonious trust, guarded by seven hundred Western Splendor Jade Maidens, managing the Hall of Flowing Essence, Purple Pavilion, Golden Radiance, and Jade Hall of Turtle Mountain.

Thrice monthly ascending to Jade Clarity, feasting again at Kunlun, inspecting the assembly of immortals, the Five Peaks, rivers, seas, and Ten Directions’ spiritual officials, all under her supreme command, reporting accordingly. All ceremonial rites follow the ancient classic of the Jade Terrace Great August.

### Implementation of the Blue Jade Tablet with Golden Script and Jade Characters

The blue jade tablet with golden script and the Azure Gold Elixir Sovereign’s bestowed text all originate from the Nine Heavens’ Great August Palace’s bow and glance order, all composed of high mysterious void profound natural chapters, attesting to the Supreme True High Sage’s office, not given to beginners. The Golden Gate Eastern Splendor Palace and other palaces also have rites to summon beginners who ascend as flying immortals. These too come from the Great August’s order, differing only in rank and hierarchy. Without a name in the Nine Heavens’ registers, no chapter title ever appears. Those who see the text carve it on slips for future lives, listing diagrams in the imperial registers, destined to become gods and immortals, thus inscribed in the spiritual pattern. When the dao is complete, heavenly true beings will descend anew to receive their bestowed texts.

The Southern Pole Supreme Origin Lord said: “Golden script and jade characters are all carved on blue jade tablets or green jade tablets. The tablet measures nine cun nine fen long, two cun four fen wide, with golden-threaded characters, attended by two jade boys and two jade maidens, managing incense and inspection. According to the Four Poles’ bright order, within a hundred years there will be a person to transmit once.”

The Southern Pole Supreme Origin Lord said: “Jade is not for worldly use. If one is named in the registers and sees the text, it may also be carved on blue wood tablets, with golden-threaded characters, stored in blue brocade pouches, incense burned and worshiped; within nine years a heavenly true being will descend to bestow the jade tablet.”

The Southern Pole Supreme Origin Lord said: “The Primordial Transformations Original Register is born together with the Nine Qi Primordial Cavern. The Most High Jade Emperor, the Supreme Holy Emperor, all form their shapes and names from the qi of the Primordial Cavern, their clothing, crowns, and colors all from the Nine Heavens Great August’s bow and glance rites. Their hometowns and village names also arise naturally. Heaven has the qi of eight assemblies, four changes of fate, using steel to bind jade emptiness, dividing principle and yin-yang, mysterious transformations governing beginnings, forming myriad beings. The exalted assembly of saints transforms shapes and images, all following the four seasons’ governance, obeying fate and mandate, moving with transformations and migrations, without aging, ultimate transformation enduring. Thus it is said: the dao has no constant name—this is what is meant.

The Queen Mother’s virtue repays the high mystery, thus the Primordial bestowed the title Elixir Sovereign, mysteriously granting the pure script original register, to be passed to later sages and immortals, knowing the Primordial’s dao, the natural names, and the qi of transformations. Those who see its chapters are inscribed in the Nine Heavens’ reverse registers and immortal rosters, their names carved on the cinnabar platform, adding their focused thought. Within nine years, they may enter the true chamber, following the four seasons’ transformations, soaring through the Nine Heavens.”

The Southern Pole Supreme Origin Lord said: “The Supreme Clarity dao’s high mysterious precious scripture uses stored thought as response, swallowing qi as meeting. Once one comprehends its chapters, one should understand the stored thought’s primordial transformations’ image, knowing its forms, colors, light, qi, and hues change with the four seasons, arriving without speaking with closed eyes, meeting without drawing breath. Thus, within less than ten years one sees spirits; within less than a month one’s qi is full. Later scholars and sages may diligently refine their thought, then the mysterious void may be illuminated, the path to immortals opened.”

The Southern Pole Supreme Origin Lord said: “Those who plant and cultivate the path of supreme immortals, thinking spirit and contemplating truth, swallowing qi and saliva, but do not know the Primordial’s names, the four seasons’ transformations, the root of changing light and qi, only close their eyes in blankness, swallow emptily without thought—how can spirit and truth descend? How can qi and fluids be replenished? Gazing and staring, there is dimness; how much more in the vastness without distinguishing form and qi? This is mere labor in sleeping and breathing, no benefit in empty chanting.”
