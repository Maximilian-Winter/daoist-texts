## Teachers, Disciples, and Conduct

### On Writing the Scripture and Formulas

Whenever one obtains a scripture, one must rewrite it anew. The earlier copy serves only as a talismanic anchor, a vessel for offering and reverence. The present transcription, however, is carefully proofread and enriched, with abundant resources and effort devoted. Each copy stands in triple accord: one for long-term talismanic safeguard, one for ritual offerings, and one for diligent study.

The study copy should always remain close at hand, kept separate on a dedicated shelf within one’s chamber, personally guarded and never entrusted to others indiscriminately. Should family members or disciples of like spirit and sincere heart be permitted access, do so sparingly and never wholly delegate responsibility. For laxity, shallow understanding, or inadvertent transgressions may bring calamity upon both parties. Clarity and caution bring blessing; heedfulness wards off misfortune.

When writing the scripture, one must observe pure fasting and ritual cleanliness. The method requires hand-copying, exchanging manuscripts with one’s teacher. If one serves in the community’s mundane tasks and cannot write personally, or lacks time or skill with brush and ink, the wealthy may commission scribes with gold and silk, while the poor may hire laborers to assist. Yet one must always borrow from exquisite exemplars; careless or perfunctory work is forbidden.

Errors in text, distorted images, or lost forms incur penalties and misfortune rather than blessing. The scripture contains illustrations, sometimes in separate scrolls, each guarded by appointed officials—jade youths and maidens—mirroring the scripture’s hierarchy. One must not recklessly alter or discard these images when revising the text. Erroneous washing or correction is limited to no more than three places per sheet; simple sheets likewise no more than three. Beyond three, the sheet must be replaced and purified by fire to cleanse errors.

Sheets must be carefully aligned and trimmed; the leading scrolls bound with silk bands; stored in cloth bags or scarves; kept in sturdy chests. They must be complete and pure, never excessively ornate. The world’s teachings advocate forsaking embellishment; yet where ornament cannot be abandoned, it is used judiciously. The mundane world’s vanity must be diminished; ornate offerings for the dao gradually give way to simplicity. After attaining simplicity, ornament naturally remains unspoiled—not sought, not forced, but arising spontaneously, impossible to prevent. Because simplicity is the root, one must not cling to worldly splendor.

Altars and ritual garments vary in richness or frugality, matching wealth and poverty appropriately. The rich should not force poverty upon themselves; the poor should not feign opulence. Extravagance or stinginess both violate the dao’s regulations. The dao values moderation, harmony between inner and outer. This is not arbitrary neglect; first, one must repent faults and errors, purify through fasting and confession, all according to the Great Truth’s regulations. When long corrupted, reforms must fully follow the Great Truth’s methods. Incense, lamps, and prostrations honor the venerable with utmost purity; such purity surely leads to sagehood, harmonizing with the Dao’s true nature.

### The Formula for Initiation and Proclamation

When disciples arise, relying on their teacher to request the method, those to be transmitted to must first copy the scripture and illustrations. After completing the catalog, select an auspicious day to conclude the fasting. During the fast, make proclamation, roughly as follows:

Though fasting methods are many, all conform to the Three Origins. The fasting rites of the Three Origins encompass all methods. The bestowal and reception of the supreme scripture use the Upper Origin. Within, the matters revealed depend on the occasion; changes and updates occur; keep it concise, not verbose.

Before fasting and proclamation, prepare formal documents with utmost sincerity—never neglect or slight them. The documents begin by naming the country, the year’s Tai Sui, the month’s first day and hour, the province, prefecture, county, village, the rank and name of male or female officials, ritual wine servers, Daoist masters, perfected immortals, and noble ladies.

Then, state the location of mountain retreats, palaces, mansions, or residences; list the names of male and female Daoists and ritual masters receiving the Great Cavern of Truth scriptures. Catalog the Cavern of Truth scrolls by number and sequence. Those receiving the full set must carefully follow the order; partial recipients should not receive all scrolls, but only those appropriate. There is no need to list scroll numbers; simply cite the titles and number of articles as they truly are. This completes the proclamation document.

The named person from the province, prefecture, county, village, humbly petitions to register as a worthy disciple, annually offering to the Mysterious Pole, partaking of precious texts with reverence and fear, earnestly seeking longevity beyond short life, eager to advance without retreat. Encountering a favorable moment, they beseech to receive the aforementioned scrolls, following the prescribed methods and faith. Humbly submitting this petition, they pray the master to graciously approve. With solemn heart, they vow to cultivate diligently, never to betray the master’s dao. Should they err, they accept the penalty of the wind blade upon themselves, daring not to harbor resentment. All done according to clear regulations, this is their solemn petition.

On the day and hour of Tai Sui in such-and-such month, at such-and-such mountain retreat, this is respectfully submitted.

### The Secret of Transmission

The essence of transmitting scriptures and treasures lies in preserving the master. The master’s master, and the master’s master’s master—three generations residing in the village. Record the gender, rank, name, style name, birth year, place of transmission, and the disciple receiving the transmission on yellow or white paper. The disciple must carry this with them, never losing it. Loss incurs punishment, all as per the Great Truth’s regulations.

Those who do not constantly carry it should attach it inside the scripture, wrapped separately in a cloth pouch. The master, the master’s master, and the mysterious master, the master’s azure youth lord, and the junior lord—these two lords must be preserved and respected according to ritual.

### The Formula for the Certificate of Method

The certificate of method differs from the scripture. The master’s master’s secret formula varies with each disciple and changes over time, hence differences arise. Do not doubt. Follow the master’s instructions. If no master is available, invoke the mysterious rites and follow the prescribed format for issuing the certificate without deviation.

Scrolls are received separately, formulas passed gradually, scripture and formulas complement each other. The master and disciple measure carefully: even if light is used to overcome heavy, or ease to remove difficulty, one must consider the matter and ritual, never violating the prescribed method. Only those with proper registration may receive.

Those receiving all at once use the following:

One, nine taels of superior gold;  
Two, one hundred and twenty feet of purple brocade;  
Three, forty feet each of five-colored patterned silk;  
Four, one thousand two hundred feet of plain white silk;  
Five, twenty-four zhang of purple-patterned cloth;  
Six, colored threads interwoven with stems and branches, patterned silk measured by year in bolts and feet;  
Seven, three jin each of five-colored silk threads;  
Eight, nine jin each of five kinds of incense;  
Nine, three jade dragons and three jade fish;  
Ten, five golden dragons and five golden fish;  
Eleven, one jade wild goose and one jade sheep;  
Twelve, one golden wild goose and one golden sheep;  
Thirteen, three jade talismans;  
Fourteen, nine pairs each of gold and silver rings;  
Fifteen, three hundred sixty pearls the size of parasol tree seeds;  
Sixteen, five-colored threads measured by prescribed weight;  
Seventeen, three hundred sixty sheets of large-format paper;  
Eighteen, five pairs of brushes;  
Nineteen, five dragon-headed writing knives;  
Twenty, one purple canopy wrapped in red cloth; two sets of vermilion-dyed brush heads, with gold and silver fittings;  
Twenty-one, five blue canopies wrapped in green cloth; three sets of black-dyed brush heads, with ivory and copper fittings;  
Twenty-two, one bright mirror, one foot in diameter, never less than nine inches;  
Twenty-three, one set of ritual garments, including crown, shoes, and hand covers, of medium fineness, freshly cleaned and perfumed;  
Twenty-four, one pure jar and one plate, made of gold, silver, copper, or tile, assorted as needed.

These twenty-four items correspond to specific ritual functions and must be gathered completely without omission. In remote or impoverished regions, substitutions of equivalent items are permitted, but never arbitrarily. If some items cannot be immediately procured, note the deficiency and seek to complete the set after receiving the method.

At the beginning of the fasting and at the initial submission of the petition, all preparations must be ready. Consult the venerable master about offerings and dedications, record all arrangements, append them after the scripture catalog and before the petition text. Read aloud at the start of proclamation. When the time comes to confer the scripture, present official memorials and restate these matters carefully without neglect.

When the master receives this certificate, following clear regulations, its use will surely achieve its purpose, mutually ensuring the attainment of true realization. If invoking the mysterious covenant, follow this method. After issuing the Golden Writ, the ritual of scattering may be performed. If the scripture is incomplete, do not use this secret. Those of great aspiration must observe these details precisely and thoroughly.

## The Nine Regulations of the Great Truth

The Most High, Most True King of the Dao, established these regulations to complete all methods, scattered throughout many scriptures, sometimes at the beginning, sometimes at the end. Readers often overlook them; one must diligently seek the original text. This text comprises three scrolls, secret to the master, who, upon receiving it, becomes teacher of Heaven and Humanity.

Now, this great summary outlines nine essentials, observed by the Nine Heavens’ perfected immortals, universally followed. They govern teaching and transformation, action and stillness, success and failure.

If a wise and discerning person seeks to receive the precious scriptures, they must be shown these essential laws. The proper bestowal and reception must follow these nine rules, applying analogies to find all necessary points. Do not arbitrarily add or subtract. All scriptures of the Three Caverns conform to these rules.

The Most Supreme Perfected, the Western City King Lord, the Immortal Officials and Scholars, and the Talented Elders all treasure these secrets. Guard them carefully; do not leak them.

### First Regulation: Completion of Fasting and Bestowal of Precepts

After fasting concludes, bestow the precepts. Following precepts, transmit the scripture. The year of transmission marks the limit. This limit disciplines the heart, setting the goal to see the Dao. The Dao is lord of all marvels; to behold marvels is to perceive their root.

Suppress desire first; lessen desire next. Depth depends on capacity; quality depends on virtue. Virtue’s measure is boundless, divided into six great spans:

- First, forty thousand kalpas;  
- Second, forty thousand years;  
- Third, four thousand lifetimes;  
- Fourth, four hundred years;  
- Fifth, forty years;  
- Sixth, exactly four cycles.

When the kalpa cycle ends, one may transmit to one person, up to nine persons—the honor of clear Dao and precious virtue.

When fate hastens and time presses, great compassion broadly saves; when meeting the worthy, transmission is given without fixed number. But initial reception must be subtle, seeking proof within the limit.

If internal foundation meets danger, threatened by misfortune beyond wisdom’s transformation, one yields humbly to avoid disaster. The essence lies in the heart, not trapped in scrolls to harm the mysterious truth.

If compelled by power to oppress the master, one may petition the master to temporarily comply with such intent, only if afterward able to rectify and preserve the original resolve. Otherwise, sever ties with death, never disrespect or abandon the true Dao.

If wisdom cannot manage, do not forcibly attempt to control; lacking virtue and strength, one destroys body and life without success, only increasing guilt. Reflect thrice before acting.

If loss or theft occurs unknowingly, or plundered by kalpa thieves, uncertain if surviving, all must undergo long fasting and confession, surrendering body, life, and wealth, relying on the master for years, exhausting single sincerity without resentment or laziness, then receive anew.

If receiving thrice is lost, do not accept carelessly again; increase confession until spirit is moved, then receive once more, surely ascending the Dao’s truth.

Those who receive without response achieve nothing, sowing future cause; better to receive the superior than the inferior.

If reception is unending, mind and spirit shift; though initially fruitless, ultimately they attain the Dao.

---

### Second Regulation: After Receiving Scripture

Diligently seek the master’s instruction, illuminating the inner radiance, never flaunting it. When the time limit ends, only then transmit to the worthy. Worthy ones are rare; do not recklessly transmit to unfit persons.

Transgressors suffer the wind blade, extending upward to ancestors, downward to descendants, severing lineage, filling the ranks of ghosts.

If within the limit calamity strikes—family death, disputes, bloodshed, imprisonment, fire, theft, grave illness—even if the limit passed, do not transmit. Instead, repent, diligently perform good deeds, announce joy on time, then transmission may occur.

If the Three Venerables grant longevity and fate ascends, or if innocent suffering imprisonment, these do not hinder transmission; it proceeds as scheduled.

---

### Third Regulation: Faith, Purity, and Use of Offerings

Faith must verify the heart, illuminating subtle meaning, ensuring refinement and delight, grasping principle rightly.

Proper portions must be prepared, stored, and carefully managed; do not boast or hoard.

Beware of evil seeking, bargaining, or forceful demands. Theft of secret knowledge, claiming merit, only adds guilt and loss of blessing.

The master uses the offerings thus: one-third for disciple’s fasting support, incense, and scriptures; one-third to aid mountain hermitages and the suffering; one-third to supply the master’s ritual garments, fine and coarse, and offerings to the Three Venerables. No private dispersal allowed.

Dispersal must follow law, without stinginess or greed, lest calamity and disgrace fall, inviting scorn from gods and spirits.

In urgent times, partial aid may be given as needed, first invoking the Three Treasures, then supplementing. Violations invite investigation and punishment.

Those sharing the Spirit Treasure altar follow the twelve regulations.

---

### Fourth Regulation: Maintaining Ritual Purity

After receiving the scripture, keep ritual purity without fail. If sudden illness or unforeseen affairs cause lapses, promptly repent, confess, and cleanse the elixir heart.

If wandering, indulging in lust, pride, or arrogance, causing transgressions, one falls deeply into the netherworld.

---

### Fifth Regulation: Long Fasting

The method requires long fasting. If unable, select auspicious times and sincerely apply oneself.

The year has six fasting months: first, third, fifth, seventh, ninth, and eleventh. Each month uses odd days, harnessing Yang’s fullness and Yin’s power.

Each day has assigned duties: ten days in a month, the first, eighth, fourteenth, fifteenth, eighteenth, twenty-third, twenty-fourth, twenty-eighth, twenty-ninth, and thirtieth.

If fasting is wholly abandoned, no merit accrues. Forgetting the Dao and forsaking the method invites disaster. Unintentional fasting breach requires confession. Repeated offenses without repentance lead to demonic downfall.

Persevere without slackening; do not break or retreat. Preserve the Dao and spread the method; harmonize self and things; attain sagehood in due time; receive the title of Mysterious Virtue.

---

### Sixth Regulation: Study and Practice of Scripture and Precepts

Fasting, reading scripture, and precepts must be mastered and practiced. Teach and clarify daily, seeking subtle understanding. Understanding must be enacted; violation demands confession without repetition.

In sitting or walking, preserve the text; never neglect or forget.

If one hides knowledge, deceives others, neglects precepts, shirks answering doubts, resents questioning, uses false words, feigns understanding, distorts meaning, adds or removes chapters, fabricates heresies, or violates truth and righteousness, grave calamity follows.

---

### Seventh Regulation: Propagation and Moral Cultivation

Proclaim scripture and precepts; establish virtue and merit; aid others and oneself; exhort transformation as supreme.

Uphold correctness and openness; avoid arrogance and falsity; use skillful wisdom.

If talent is shallow, do not act rashly; improper expediency leads to falsehood.

Follow true meaning to guide united hearts to the master’s gate. Study scripture and precepts to prove subtle principle, awaken good hearts, prepare fasting and contemplation, so that hearing and seeing blessings and registrations bring joy and harmony, achieving success without harshness or anger, which only increase faults.

Use gentle persuasion, never forceful coercion. Balance firmness and softness; one yields to one seizes; various methods soften confusion without turning it. Show compassion without stinginess; never abandon kindness.

Find good teachers and vow together to ascend the mysterious. Cherish master and resources; achieve the highest truth.

---

### Eighth Regulation: Master’s Equanimity in Reward and Punishment

The master pities disciples equally, with one heart, without partiality. Rewards and punishments are clear: punish to stop evil, reward to encourage good.

No detail is overlooked; no slightest error is ignored. Errors and partiality bring disaster, with hidden and manifest consequences.

---

### Ninth Regulation: Disciples’ Reverence and Diligence

Disciples must be respectful and cautious, serving the master without division. Speak little and act sparingly; be solemn, quiet, and sincere.

Attend the master’s presence, consult and report on secret formulas, reflect on achievements, assist the Three Treasures, focus heart and effort, obey commands promptly, fear neither fire nor water, near nor far.

When in doubt, immediately consult and examine. If permitted to reform, repent; if forbidden, obey. If failing, accept consequences without evasion.

The master tests disciples to strengthen their hearts, ascend the Dao, enter truth. Ranks and distinctions teach recognition and insight. Daily assign tasks, supervise and urge refinement, to expand the supreme Dao.

If the master’s power is weak, do not rashly test others. A sage master’s tests cause no harm. Good or ill fortune follows the wise master.

If encountering a bad master, the method has no evil; evil arises from oneself. Death brings no grievance; one must self-reflect, reform past and cultivate future.

If still hesitant or doubting the master, one should not serve. Serving requires obedience; disobedience loses the Dao and falls into ruin.

Be cautious at the start, strive to the end.

These nine regulations, proclaimed by the Nine Palaces’ perfected immortals, are followed by the countless great sages who have attained the Dao in the Ten Directions, rescuing and saving all beings.
