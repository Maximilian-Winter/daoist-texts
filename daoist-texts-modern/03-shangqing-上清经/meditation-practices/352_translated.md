## The Cavernous Truth of the Most High Purple Script Golden Elixir Chapter

Also called the Nine Heavens Jade Clarity Green-Character Hidden Script

The Purple Script Golden Elixir and Green-Character Hidden Script, comprising one hundred and twenty words, is the vital breath above the Nine Heavens, condensed from the essence of purple radiance, forming a naturally ordained chapter that manifests within the Jade Clarity Palace. Its text shines forth brilliantly, illuminating the Supreme Clarity, inscribed by the Most High Patriarch’s hand, revealing its hidden sounds, weaving the framework of the Jade Void, commanding fate throughout the Nine Heavens, ever reigning with awe-inspiring potency, summoning the numinous to inspect and purify the spirits.

This very text was worn by the Primordial Heavenly King, passed down to the Jade Clarity Sovereign Lords, the Demon-Dispelling Great King, and the Jade Clarity Divine Firmament King. Attending the script are twenty-four Jade Youths and Jade Maidens, who bind the wearers against the leaks of sloth and distraction, guarding those who bear the text upon their person. To possess this text is to align with the Nine Heavens’ truth, inscribed on the Vermilion Altar, a position matched with the exalted mysteries—one’s body radiates purple light, the neck bears a perfect brightness, roaming the Great Void, commanding the Ten Realms’ welcomes, summoning the Three Primes to descend, feasting together upon the celestial palanquin.

To cultivate the path of the divine immortals, one must open and recite the Most High Jade Clarity Hidden Writings, the Great Cavernous Truth Scripture. One should settle upon a square measure of earth, the heart reflecting the Purple Script Golden Elixir Chapter; the left hand holds the flowing-gold fire bell, the right commands the seven primal energies of the void. Then the Jade Void descends unbidden, the Great Cavern opens without knocking, myriad spirits respond to the occasion and gather, legions of demons bind themselves and perish. One maneuvers the eight breaths, cycles the five stars, seats the command over myriad spirits, marshals and commands the host of immortals; breath merges with the high void, form rises as the purple guest.

The secret profundities of the Nine Heavens, the hidden script of Jade Clarity—if this chapter is revealed, the body will be struck by wind blades, held accountable by the seven profound tests of life and death, just as with the Nine Heavens’ covenant text.

There is a golden name and a jade character, arranged as a diagram of the Nine Heavens. To behold this text, one must prepare a three-foot length of crimson-patterned silk as the base, inscribe the Golden Elixir Chapter upon it with a purple brush, carry the Purple Script ninety feet long, adorned with golden fish and jade dragons, and present it to the master in a pure chamber for ninety days of cleansing. Facing north, one must declare the covenant to the Nine Heavens and transmit it. The disciple who receives it carries it in a brocade pouch at the heart.

Those who bear the Purple Script Golden Elixir Chapter are matched with the exalted mysteries, granted the Jade Clarity Hidden Writings, their rank aligned with the Great True. Sitting, rising, sleeping, and waking, they intertwine with the Jade Void; Jade Blossoms guard the true self on left and right; the Five Emperors watch over the sleeping pavilion. They must not mingle with the common folk, nor pollute the exalted truths. To violate this is to have the spirits depart and demons advance; to be tested and lose immortality.

When wearing the Purple Script Golden Elixir Chapter, at all times of entering, resting, or walking the path, one should first think that one’s body is suffused with purple radiance, the profound veil above, breath circling the whole self; then knock the nine passages of the teeth and softly intone:

> Jade Void ninefold, purple radiance eightfold entwined,  
> Profound light hanging and reflecting, Jade Clarity exhaling nectar,  
> Purple script golden writing, manifesting the Nine Heavens,  
> Commanding fate over myriad spirits, summoning and marshaling the host of immortals,  
> Awe-inspiring and restraining ten thousand legions, inspecting and pruning a thousand thousands,  
> Echoes and responses immediately assemble, five clouds emit smoke,  
> Flying chariot and purple canopy suddenly come before me,  
> Let me ride the void, ascend high to the Jade Morning.

When complete, draw the twelve throat centers of purple breath to a halt. After nine years thus, a purple cloud canopy will appear, shading the destined body; the body produces purple light, shining upon the Ten Directions, communicating with spirits, reaching the true, clearly perceiving the Great Void.

Long ago, the Lady of the Upper Origin bestowed the hidden script to the Jade Maiden of Great Harmony. The Jade Maiden of Great Harmony passed it to the Lord of Young Yang, who, upon completing the path, ascended to the void and sealed the text within the cave chamber of the Nine Peaks. After seven hundred years, it is destined to be granted to the one who unites truth and penetrates mystery. Later students who refine their thoughts and practice diligently will naturally respond and be prepared by fate.
