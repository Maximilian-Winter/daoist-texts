## Record of the Supreme Cavernous Truth’s Flying Feather Scripture of the Nine Primal Ascensions of the Mysterious

The Supreme Great Dao Lord once received the Flying Feather Scripture of the Nine Primal Ascensions of the Mysterious, a treasured text inscribed with purple characters recording the golden words of transcendence—how to soar beyond emptiness, tread the void, and float upon the shifting shadows of the path. This was granted by the Jade Pure Upper Palace’s Celestial Sovereign, the Mysterious Lord of the Dao.

Thus, the Supreme Great Dao Lord, holding this essential transmission, passed it to the Jade Emperor of the Upper Clarity, who in turn transmitted it to the Primordial Great Elemental Lord of the Upper Origin. The Great Elemental Lord then passed it to the Heavenly Emperor of the Supreme Subtlety. The Heavenly Emperor bestowed the true secret upon the Yellow Radiance Lord of the Morning, who passed it to the Purple Spirit Lord of the Imperial Beginning, who then passed it to the Central Yellow Elder Lord. The Yellow Elder Lord transmitted it to the Nine Subtle Supreme Jade Protector King, the Golden Pavilion’s Chief Minister, the Great Fate Master of the Morning, the Green Youth Lord, and the Brahman Mèi, instructing them to teach this scripture only to those destined to become true perfected beings.

Wherever there are the Crimson Records of the Great Elemental Lord or golden slips engraved with names, this scripture must be seen. None but the destined may encounter it. Those who wish to pass it on must be finely responsive and deeply moved; only then is it entrusted. They swear an oath sealed with blood and broken gold, vowing never to reveal it. Those who possess this scripture are guarded by the Great Elemental Lord’s emissaries—twenty-four jade youths and twenty-four jade maidens—who attend on either side of the text, piercing through arrogance and carelessness, protecting the bearer’s body. This is the Supreme Middle Truth of the Dao, not for the unprepared or the unworthy, but the very essence of central harmony and true reality.

Matched with the Three Primes, the text is named *Great Elemental*, carried with the purple banner’s standard, riding in the brocaded chariot of eight lights. Tens of thousands of spirits lead the way, followed by a thousand true beings; nine phoenixes cry out in unison, the celestial balance sings with strings, divine dragons open the path, the Jade Emperor joins the chariot, soaring through the great void, feasting in the cinnabar heavens, honored as a Perfected of the Upper Clarity, master of the Jade Court.

Those who possess the Supreme Flying Feather Scripture of the Nine Primal Ascensions may study it for three thousand years and six transmissions. Upon meeting the destined person, it is granted all at once in a single day. If no one is worthy, when the three thousand years expire, the text is written in vermilion and white, sealed within the Golden Terrace chamber of Mount Emei, never to be passed forth again. To grant it to the unworthy is to betray the way of the perfected; to receive it and not uphold its precepts is to break the perfected’s oath. The master who grants the scripture and the disciple who receives it form a complete lineage. Those who violate the text, disrespect, or reveal the treasured words shall be visited by the seven ancestors and grandparents, summoned to the Mysterious Capital to endure the Wind Blade’s torment, their bodies condemned to the lower ghosts, wandering the dark river of the netherworld.

If one desires to receive the flying path, they must scatter gold as an oath; to know the immortal’s taboos, they must wear the text’s headband as a token. Once the feather script is known, Heaven and Earth accord; the disciple hears the mysterious text, transcends the chariot, and rejoices in auspicious clouds—this is what is meant. The names are carved on the Feather Cavern Terrace.

The Great Elemental Lord of the Three Primes said: “Immortals first come to know the protective way of the Dipper stars, yet do not understand the perfected’s method of concealing the Dipper’s essence. The Nine Dippers are the central canopy of the Heavenly Pivot, the splendid jewel of the Mysterious Axis, the mechanism and hinge of the eight dimensions, revolving through nine degrees, shading the round and square, governing harmonious qi, regulating yin and yang, overseeing all without exception. The Dipper’s mysterious bright lights, the twin glimmers, form the night’s shadowed constellation, moving through the four images as their flowing fall; the mysterious brilliance merges and shines, their majestic radiance together flourishing.”

The Great Emperor said: “Immortals only know to chew yin and yang, inhale and exhale the two breaths, but do not know the Dipper stars are the root mansion of yin and yang, the mysterious thread of the two images. They labor over the wave’s end, yet fail to recognize the camp’s beginning and its ease; they shade its branches and lose the root. Why not store the Nine Dippers in the heart, temper the two images in cold refinement? After fourteen years of practice, the Supreme One greets you with a jade wheel, transcends the void, treads the sky, ascends to Upper Clarity, ranks among the highest perfected, returns to the infant face of spirit, with myriad gods attending the chariot.”

The Green Youth Lord said: “Immortals only know the great majesty of the celestial pivot, the shining brilliance of ten thousand stars, behold the flowing streams of the nine paths, delight in the orb’s movement to gather spirit, shelter it seeking great breadth, use it seeking immortality, yet still fail to recognize the turning of the nine qi within, illuminating the Dipper concealed in the mud pellet. Here the soul condenses, the spirit refines, virtue and spiritual smoke unite; understanding this way ascends to Upper Clarity, attaining the Dao body as a perfected. Thus the perfected embrace the great image to hide the rosy clouds, envelop the Dipper essence to conceal the body. My former master therefore rides the left with green clouds, reins on the right with crimson dawn, body ascending the Great Elemental, transcending the void, treading the sky. Preserve the Dipper star’s purple hue, its firm red color, sensing the purple qi’s warmth. Preserve the star’s size and place—this is the Green Youth Lord’s secret formula.”

Long ago, Wuchengzi, Guxizi, Guangchengzi, and Qingzhenzi each preserved the Dipper star’s qi and entered together the lotus seed’s center. Suddenly within the lotus appeared a golden pond a thousand li wide, jade mountains stretching ten thousand acres, official terraces and mansions, all connected with clouds, vermilion wood bearing fruit, purple blossoms growing in the garden, emerald chariots of dark yellow, three pure and eight transports—a wondrous sight beyond naming. The four traveled through time, feasted and gazed to the utmost before returning. At that moment, they did not perceive the lotus seed’s center. This is called casting the great upon the small, transformation without trace—this is the utmost response of star preservation, the measure of breadth and narrowness. One might boast the eight seas as mere twigs—how wondrous indeed the lotus seed!

On the first, third, and fifth days of the month, at the hour of the midday midpoint or midnight, the unique hour, enter the chamber, sit upright facing north, join hands, settle qi, close eyes. Then preserve the nine stars of the Northern Dipper descending, entering the head’s mud pellet. With the ladle’s handle pointing forward, the Dipper’s chief star faces upward. After a long while, suddenly one sees within the Dipper’s chief a great divine person, whose robes and name are as the incantation says. After a long time, the head feels a gentle warm heat. This is the arrival of the Nine Primal True Qi of the Upper Origin, hence the warm and unusual feeling confirming the response. Then swallow saliva fifty times, knock teeth nine times, raise the left hand’s third finger, pinch between the eyebrows, and softly recite:

> Supreme Purple Radiance, honored of the nine paths,  
> The floral canopy’s seven falls, revolving lights of ten thousand stars,  
> Moving to govern high spirit, resting in harmonious clouds,  
> Yin and yang flow and irrigate, the two breaths divide within,  
> Circling aid without boundary, shining bright through myriad heavens,  
> Commanding the moon to open its teeth, come ascend the mud pellet,  
> Primordial essence forms response, transforming into great divinity,  
> Named Marvelous Pivot, its character is Spiritual Thread,  
> Sitting upright within the Dipper, roaming my bright hall,  
> Phoenix feathers purple cloak, tiger brocade cinnabar robe,  
> Left bearing jade pendants, right waist golden rings,  
> Hand grasping flowing bell, headband of dawn’s light,  
> Exhaling qi to nourish essence, mud pellet made sound,  
> Soul and spirit condensed in harmony, erecting splendid pillars and beams,  
> Enabling my flight as immortal, transcending void, treading sky,  
> Ascending to Upper Clarity, steering tiger, commanding dragon,  
> Facing north to the King Emperor, jade forest upper palace,  
> Westward visiting the Great Elemental, bowing to the Three Primes.

After the incantation, swallow saliva thirty times, knock teeth nine times, repeat the incantation as before. Then rise, face north and bow twice, face west and bow twice. After bowing, do not reopen eyes; the ritual is complete.

This may be done in a quiet chamber above the lungs; the bows need not touch the ground. The perfected’s method values resting where one finds rest, revering subtlety and simplicity, no longer twisting or breaking the ordinary, avoiding disturbance of the habitual place. The essence of the Dao is not complicated; the key is peerless.

Later, the three incantation methods all follow this example, differing only in the words and whether the star preservation faces backward. The key is to practice in a secret, winding chamber, never letting others see one’s star preservation. This is because jade youths and maidens stand nearby to observe. Also, one must not attend funerals or sit by corpses, nor let the scripture be soiled or defiled; clothing, headbands, shoes—all must be strictly observed to avoid false borrowings of evil kinds. What are evil kinds? Those who share the same path and agreement are not included. Those not of my fellowship do not share my seat; those not of my alliance do not share my food. Daoists and layfolk differ. Those who worship the Six Heavens or serve mountain and river demons do not dwell in this chamber, do not partake of this scripture, do not wear its garments or headbands, to avoid the corpse’s defiled lower qi and to block the evil winds’ coming and going. This is the true Dao’s true Dao, the exquisite’s exquisite. If one can master this subtlety, one attains the true; if one can avoid defilement, one gains the new. If one mixes chaos and disorder, foul and fragrant alike, neglects the spirit’s mark, fails to regulate qi, mingles licentiousness and chastity, greed and integrity, dwells in evil winds without cleansing the heart, walks dusty paths without seeking transcendence—seeking truth thus, truth is not found. Night light does not arise from a cesspit; talent does not grow on a marked hill—thus it is said. The spirit’s response is faint, the numinous answer subtle, jade blossoms confirm, divine light reveals. Unless one is this teacher, do not speak of it.

The great divinity within the Dipper is the essence of the nine stars, suddenly born from responsive transformation. When practicing, one must keep the name in mind; after the incantation, the deity reappears, preserved as at the start. This star god within the mud pellet always dwells therein. Every matter follows this image.

Preserving the Dipper stars descending causes the utmost thoughtlessness, suddenly one is already within the form. At first the preservation may not respond clearly, but with utmost thought, as if already inside the form, it suffices to bring response; gradually one enters the marvelous.

On the seventh, ninth, and twelfth days of the month, at the midday midpoint or midnight hour, enter the chamber, sit upright facing north, join hands, settle qi, close eyes. Then preserve the nine stars of the Northern Dipper descending into the heart. With the ladle’s handle upright pointing to the throat, the chief star faces outward. After a long while, suddenly one sees within the chief a great deity, robes and name as the incantation says. One should feel warmth in the heart, the true qi entering. Then swallow saliva fifty times, knock teeth nine times, raise the right hand’s second finger to pinch the heart, and softly recite:

> Supreme Purple Truth, spirit among nine qi,  
> Encompassing myriad degrees, the celestial pivot shines bright,  
> Flying rosy clouds streaming brilliance, illuminating jade clarity,  
> Mysterious canopy and myriad stars, yin and yang resolved,  
> Four harmonies descend, seven latitudes follow life,  
> Beginning with auspicious moon days, shining on the heart’s court,  
> Flowing light falls and fades, the middle origin fills,  
> Six palaces open gates, floral liquid smooths,  
> Soul and spirit disciplined, attaining true essence,  
> Response touches transformation, myriad changes arise,  
> Suddenly seeing great deity seated in heart chamber,  
> Regulating qi, facing the dew, all joints flowing,  
> Climbing the Dipper, grasping the chief, gazing afar to all directions,  
> Named Celestial Degree, character Pure Health,  
> Green feathered splendid cloak, dragon belt tiger robe,  
> Body born of precious radiance, neck bearing round light,  
> Head crowned with flying dawn, adjusting crown high and low,  
> Enabling my flight as immortal, transcending the void, treading the sky,  
> Ascending the Purple Palace, facing north to the Jade Emperor,  
> Commanding myriad gods, myriad spirits welcome,  
> Blossoms arise above the heart, auspicious clouds eternal,  
> Phoenix cries clear, luan blows resonant.

After the incantation, swallow saliva thirty times, knock teeth nine times, repeat the incantation as before. Then rise, face south and bow twice. The ritual is complete; open the eyes.

On the fifteenth, nineteenth, and twenty-third days of the month, at midday midpoint or midnight, enter the chamber, sit upright facing north, join hands, settle qi, close eyes. Then preserve the nine stars of the Northern Dipper descending, entering three cun below the navel, the Lower Origin palace. With the ladle’s handle upright pointing to the heart, the chief star faces outward. After a long while, suddenly one sees within the chief a great deity, robes and name as the incantation says. One should feel warmth in the navel, true qi arriving. Then swallow saliva sixty times, knock teeth nine times, raise the left hand’s third finger to pinch below the nose at the philtrum, and softly recite:

> Supreme Purple Sovereign, shining center,  
> Nine jade discs bright and splendid, radiance illuminating rosy clouds,  
> Myriad spirits gaze in awe, a thousand dawns plant teeth,  
> Seven degrees use brightness, nine smokes fragrant blossoms,  
> Governing yang’s exterior and order, holding yin in harmony,  
> True radiance opens array, mysterious root gathers all,  
> Beginning with auspicious moon, observing the navel within,  
> Purple qi issues to the heavens, flying light descends and scatters,  
> Refining my soul and spirit, floral dew entwined,  
> Suddenly seeing great deity, noble of the upper palace,  
> Named Blessing Sprout, character Flowing Abundance,  
> Sitting upright in the navel, riding the nine qi of the Dipper,  
> Exhaling and inhaling cloud liquid, balancing blood and regulating stomach,  
> Yellow phoenix feather cloak, dragon robe tiger belt,  
> Hand opening sun root, head wearing green talisman,  
> Waist bearing flowing fire, shining lightning reflecting the void,  
> Enabling my flight as immortal, transcending the void, treading the sky,  
> Ascending the jade chamber, carrying the empty heavens,  
> Commanding myriad gods, Heaven and Earth in harmony.

After the incantation, swallow saliva thirty times, knock teeth nine times, repeat the incantation as before. Then rise, face one’s birth sign and bow twice. After bowing, open the eyes; the path of the Lower Origin is complete. Whenever raising the hand to pinch, this is the moment of incantation poetry; after incantation, hands return as before.

On the eight festival days at midnight, enter the chamber, sit upright facing north, join hands, settle qi, close eyes and look inward. Then preserve the whole body rising gently, flying and ascending to the Northern Dipper’s chief star. After a long while, one feels the form already within the Dipper. With utmost thought, one hears heat within the body—this is true qi uniting with virtue. Also preserve the names, robes, and colors of the nine essences and three great deities, their appearance like newborn infants. The three gods sit opposite me; my heart bows to them. The refined vision is faint, the form vanishing, making one nearly lost in trance. Then swallow saliva eighty times, knock teeth nine times, raise the left hand to stroke the heart, and intone:

> Supreme Cinnabar Spirit, mysterious light flashing,  
> Nine jade discs opening the celestial pivot,  
> Radiance and qi clear and dispersing, purple dawn’s faint candle,  
> Seven luminaries gathering bright, two glimmers playing light,  
> Yin and yang judged, four degrees flourishing,  
> Cloud dew returning to irrigate, eight festivals opening qi,  
> Ascending the nine origins, grasping the Dipper, climbing the thread,  
> Paying homage to the three gods, asking why I linger,  
> Why not ascend as immortal? I bow in fear before ghosts,  
> The emperor appears radiant, mouth holding sun root,  
> Left breaking six heavens, right furrowing Deng mountain,  
> Flowing bell shining above, myriad demons shattered,  
> Then harmonizing my spirit, strengthening my three souls,  
> Concealing the Dipper’s inner light, nine essences in heart,  
> Purple clouds illuminating the cavern, flying light ten thousand fathoms,  
> Harmonizing soul and disciplining spirit, cleansing six viscera,  
> Essence responding, transformation leaping, jade consort suddenly seen,  
> Sitting at my heart, gazing up and down,  
> Named Secret Blossom, character Neighboring Grace,  
> Exhaling and inhaling vermilion qi, harmonizing all gates,  
> Body clothed in brocade cloak, phoenix radiance and luan skirt,  
> Waist bearing tiger record, dragon pattern and jade script,  
> Hand holding moonlight, crowned with sun,  
> Leaping to the great heavens, riding the canopy cloud,  
> Scripture named Great Elemental, I attain flying immortality,  
> Transcending the floating void, riding the jade great origin,  
> Ascending the vermilion chamber, commanding myriad gods,  
> Marking the two degrees, returning to infant face,  
> Northern emperor stirring lightning, southern emperor fire array,  
> Granaries bound, candles lit, resplendent thunder shaking,  
> Westward flowing double flaps, wailing sounds chanting the balance,  
> Four directions leaping high, offering to my jade truth,  
> Then riding the eight lights, roaming the nine smokes.

After the incantation, swallow saliva thirty times, knock teeth nine times, repeat the incantation as before. Then rise, face northwest and bow twice. Open eyes; the true practice of the eight festivals is complete.

This Dao is the secret marvel of transcending the void, the wondrous method of the nine primals, practiced in three stages of true cultivation, using the nine days of the month, hence called the *Nine Primal Ascension Text*. This Supreme Forbidden Scripture is the inner treasure, the essential secret of the perfected. If one finds the destined person to transmit it to, the receiver must fast and purify for one hundred days, or thirty days, or ten days, as suits their condition. One should first announce a fast day to cleanse the pure heart. The transmitter fasts alongside the receiver. On the day of transmission, they first drink blood, pile the altar, cut hair, and swear an oath never to disclose the secret. Later sages, to prevent injury to life energy by enemy blood, forbid cutting hair or violating the skin; instead, they use two taels of gold to substitute for the blood oath, and thirty-two feet of soft blue silk as the hair-cutting pact. The master receiving the oath object must not disperse it for private gain or misuse, but must dwell in mountain seclusion or live as a solitary humble Daoist. If ascending and soaring the void, or casting it into a mountain chamber, scattering it on cloud rocks, this is because Heaven’s clear trust values binding oaths, measuring the Dao’s essence, cherishing and nurturing it. Those who do not honor the precepts shall face death and the seven ancestors, endure the Mysterious Capital’s Wind Blade’s test, and become lower ghosts. Transmission years and limits, granting and regulating follow the above method. One must carefully observe it; all oath objects are refined and supreme. Open the heart, be solemn and orderly, sincere and single-minded, without reserve.

Receiving the scripture makes one a lineage; granting it makes one scripture master. Hearing the Dao, one looks up to the model; seeking life, one preserves the near life ground. Those who do not follow the precepts, who are negligent or disrespectful, the three ancestors punish them at the Fire Official, their bodies born with karmic illness. Master Xuanyuan judged the Mountain Elder, who only understood the stone refining method, nothing more wondrous—how could he be superior to Jinyun? Xuanyuan once asked his stone refining method and thus apprenticed. The Mountain Elder of Jing Mountain is Ji Youzi, now at Feather Mountain, able to refine stone into water, boil water into jade, powder jade into powder, taking it with stone water. He knows the Dao and coexists with Heaven, but cannot fly through the void, only grasping morning clouds. Stone refining, though wondrous, is a minor art.

The Supreme Flying Feather Scripture of the Nine Primal Ascensions’ upper record is complete. The lower scroll is the Supreme Nine Primal Middle Scripture. Though both have prefaces and sequential formulas, their methods differ and are unrelated. The Central Yellow Elder Lord divides and transmits it to the True Person of the Great Void, alongside the secret sayings of the eight paths. The Nine Primal Middle Scripture is practiced among humans, also with formulas, but these secrets are not written here. Now, a brief mention:

- First true method: practice five times in the month on the fifth, fifteenth, twenty-fifth, twenty-seventh, and twenty-ninth days, all at dawn.
- Second true method: practice six times in the month on the eighth, eleventh, fourteenth, nineteenth, twenty-third, twenty-seventh days of the eighth month, all at the hour of the dragon.
- Third true method: practice six times in the month on the sixth, seventh, seventeenth, eighteenth, twenty-fifth, twenty-sixth days of the sixth month, all at the hour of the snake.
- Fourth true method: practice six times in the month on the second, eighth, fourteenth, eighteenth, nineteenth, twenty-eighth days of the first month, all at the hour of the horse.
- Fifth true method: practice five times in the month on the third, eighth, thirteenth, twentieth, twenty-sixth days of the third month, all at the hour of the goat.
- Sixth true method: practice seven times in the month on the seventh, eleventh, fourteenth, eighteenth, twenty-third, twenty-fifth, twenty-eighth days of the seventh month, all at the hour of the monkey.
- Seventh true method: practice eight times in the month on the second, sixth, ninth, thirteenth, sixteenth, nineteenth, twenty-third, twenty-seventh days of the eleventh month, all at the hour of the monkey or rooster.
- Eighth true method: practice seven times in the month on the second, seventh, ninth, fifteenth, eighteenth, nineteenth, twenty-seventh days of the second month, all at the hour of the dog or pig.
- Ninth true method: practice six times in the month on the third, ninth, seventeenth, nineteenth, twenty-sixth, twenty-ninth days of the twelfth month, all at the hour of the rat.

The above are the formulas for practicing the Nine Primal Middle Scripture. These months and days are the times of true harmony and turning, when vital qi gathers essence—ideal for preservation of thought and easy to bring mysterious response. If one dwells in high solitude on remote peaks, marking cloud rocks, cutting off human affairs inside and out, cutting grains to clear the intestines, joining hands with a correct heart, harmonizing with the morning, all should be practiced daily as the original scripture directs. Nowadays, people are busy and cannot practice daily with leisure. Practiced for fourteen years, one transcends the floating void and nothingness, able to die and be born, emerge from water and enter fire, ascend to Upper Clarity, five viscera blossoming, mingling with Heaven.

This upper scroll of the Ascension Feather Scripture is practiced in three ways; the ninth day of the month is also the time of insufficient great stillness among humans. Those who fast long and remain quiet, solitary and detached, gazing into the empty cavern, mind single and beyond affairs, all should practice on this day, in sequence and continuation. The nine practices of the month apply to the human center.

During the eight festival days ascending the Dipper, one may suddenly see the Jade Consort sitting before me, entering my heart with purple smoke. After a long while, her robes are as the incantations of the eight festivals say. This woman is the Yin spirit of the nine essences, the upper consort of Jade Clarity. From the Green Youth Lord’s secret formula.
