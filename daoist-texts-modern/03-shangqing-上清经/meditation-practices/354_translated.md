## The Most High Scripture of Flying Through the Nine Mornings of Jade

The Most High Great Dao Lord addressed the True Sovereign of the Northern Pole, saying:  
“In former times, I revolved amidst the northern heavens, harnessing my chariot at the Broad Cold Palace, my feet treading the Celestial Canopy, my hands parting the Nine Primalities, roaming the Cloud Palaces of Radiance, frolicking in the Northern Profound, wandering freely in the Pavilion of the Northern Yin, delighting at the Gate of the Cavern’s Brush. I gazed upon the Celestial Pivot to summon the cycles, hastened the kalpa gatherings to dance the transmissions, sighed over the withering decay of myriad things, and looked down upon the eternal vastness of Heaven and Earth. Then I perceived the wondrous marvel of the Nine Stars and comprehended the utmost numinosity of the Dipper’s Chief Star.  

The Nine Stars are indeed the spiritual roots of the Nine Heavens, the bright beams of the sun and moon, the primordial ancestors of all myriad things. Thus, Heaven has nine vital airs, which take the Nine Stars as their subtle spirits; Earth has nine provinces, which regard the Nine Stars as their divine lords; humans have nine orifices, which the Nine Stars govern as their life mansions; yin and yang have nine palaces, which the Nine Stars serve as their gates; the Five Sacred Mountains and the Four Seas regard the Nine Stars as their deep reservoirs.  

The Five and Nine interweave and array, the web and warp are boundless, governing the celestial mansions, revolving the Three Stars, harmonizing the Four and Five, thereby ensuring Heaven and Earth endure. The source of all things, the reliance of gods and immortals. Without the Nine Stars, Heaven would lack clarity; without the Nine Stars, Earth would lack supreme numinosity; without the Nine Stars, the nine orifices would be dim. The Supreme Emperor unites them through True Communion; immortals depend on them to attain realization; the Five Phases ride upon them to reach transcendence; myriad beings receive life through them.  

When Heaven is clear and Earth is tranquil, the Nine Stars shine brilliantly; when Heaven is agitated and Earth is obstructed, the Nine Stars are veiled and darkened. The Celestial Pivot summons the kalpa’s appointed times, the Heavenly Gates direct the Five Phases’ airs, transmitting through the vast void’s great spokes, hastening the Nine Heavens’ responsive gatherings. Thus divine light turns and blazes, mysteriously overseeing myriad lives, moving aside from their proper stations to forewarn of calamities and auspices.  

Heaven and Earth’s great cycles intersect; the one hundred and six correspondences all hinge on the Nine Stars’ weaving and turning numbers, which govern yin and yang’s waxing and waning, the two airs’ obstruction and excitation, Heaven overturning and Earth upheaving, the Nine Seas merging into one, gold and jade dissolving and melting, not a speck lost. All revolve at the Nine Stars’ returns, the Celestial Pivot’s hastening. Illuminating Heaven and Earth’s function, the profound web’s marvel, those who grasp the center find the void’s constant concealment, hiding radiance and fleeing form, transforming the Three Stars, establishing myriad things.  

The twenty-five names of the black dots lie hidden and submerged, their subtlety profound and secret, not passed down below. Above are the Nine Morning Radiant Lords; within are the Nine Imperial Ladies; their souls, spirits, and numinous essences all wield the mighty divine power of the Nine Dipper, emitting the shining light of the Seven Luminaries, flowing and reflecting at the gates of the Nine Heavens, revealing the depths of the void, nothing left unmanifest.  

The stars’ yang brilliance manifests as flowing golden fire bells; the yin brilliance as the bursting Seven Primalities—both supreme spiritual strategies, the majesty of the Primordial Origin. The Dragon’s Flying Scroll formula is hidden in secret words, arranged beneath the silken morning, invoking the Heavenly Lamb’s rites to summon the True. Then the mysterious light curves and shines upon the solemn altar; the Nine Mornings descend into the numinous palace; the Ladies rejoice upon their resting seats; the Celestial Dipper records names in the secret books.  

Those who know this dao and preserve it need only this to avoid the great kalpa’s gathering, to cross the great flood in the Jia-Shen year. Cultivate it for twenty-seven years, and you will gain the serene swan’s wings to soar, repel the Purple Firmament and ascend the morning. This is the supreme dao of Jade Clarity, unlike the mid-level immortals of Supreme Clarity. Jade Clarity is the high transcendents of Supreme Clarity; Supreme Clarity is the high spirits of Great Clarity; Great Clarity is the high numinosity of the flying immortals.  

Those who walk the path of Jade Clarity, upon emergence are served by the heavens with three thousand jade boys and jade girls each, establishing the three seven-colored banners, riding the purple cloud flying chariot with twelve jade wheels, led by phoenix song in front, followed by mysterious lord behind, six masters opening the path, flying dragons winging the carriage—their rank matches the high immortals, listed in the Jade Clarity charts.  

Those who walk the path of Supreme Clarity, upon emergence are guarded by the five mansions, served by fifteen hundred jade boys and jade girls each, establishing the purple feather banner, riding the flying cloud cinnabar carriage, phoenix and luan birds blowing ahead and behind, mysterious dragons opening the way, the Five Emperors joining the chariot—their rank matches the left and right ministers of Supreme Clarity.  

Those who walk the path of Great Clarity, upon emergence are guarded by the Five Emperors, served by eight hundred jade boys and jade girls each, establishing the five-colored banner, riding the dragon carriage flying with smoke, nine phoenixes howling ahead, eight luans blowing behind, the white dragon opening the way, Great Tether joining the chariot. Thus within the True there are heights and depths, within the Profound there are ranks and orders.  

The path of Jade Clarity is profound and remote, far beyond the mid-level True and flying immortals. The supreme method of the Nine Stars’ upper law and mysterious reflection, I once received from the Primordial Origin. Through seven hundred million kalpas, through Heaven and Earth’s rise and fall, through the waxing and waning of the ranks, its dao alone endures. Even now it is cultivated above the cloud vistas, never forgotten at the appointed times. I delight in this dao’s lofty subtlety, cherishing the Ladies’ reception.  

How much more for those newly learning the flying serene steps, yet unaware of the hidden search and void-walking methods—how could they open the gates of the high heavens, observe Heaven and Earth’s beginning and end? Without this dao, separated from the Nine Mornings’ domain, the Ladies’ journeys are cut off. Merely possessing the mysterious imperial register, soaring and rising high, might gain the chariot to ride the cloud dragon, roam the Five Sacred Mountains—but not escape death. To hope to tread the Dipper’s Chief Star, circle the shining morning, ascend the Jade Clarity radiance—there is no set time for this.  

You, now, must regulate the kalpa’s cycles, seal and hold the ten heavenly registers and mysterious records, govern and judge gods and immortals—you should receive this method to unify myriad lives. Now I entrust it to you; keep it secret and cultivate it.”

*“Cloud web falls on the Heavenly Record, Nine Dipper’s jade void. Purple canopy atop the high sky ridge, mysterious essence brightens the Eight Summits. Above are the Nine Morning guests, chanting hidden and secret books. Flying steps roam the Northern Han, long life dwelling in Heaven and Earth.*  

*Rein the reins at the Mysterious Feathered Terrace, flying through the Nine Primalities’ place. Cavern void deep and profound, cloud web rides the void’s lift. Below are the truth gatherers, gazing up at the Jade Morning mansion. Three circuits above the Yang Bright, nine returns into the cavern wild. High steps ascend the imperial throne, long songs of dragon flight uttered.*  

*Jade firmament reflects the northern pole, jade branches and emerald hidden boughs. Void births the Nine Spirit Terraces, shining essence illuminates the vast beyond. Heavenly Gate moves the heavy darkness, kalpa gatherings repeatedly pass. Ride my feathered chariot, flying steps cross the Weaver’s River. Preserve spirit, void constant transformation, forever forget Heaven and Earth’s many.”*  

These three chapters come from Jade Clarity’s upper palace. The Nine Yang Jade Boys and Nine Radiant Jade Girls always sing them atop the shining morning to harmonize form and soul’s exchange, opening the numinous truth at the hidden gates.  

---

Those who cultivate the flying steps of the Seven Primalities and walk the Nine Stars’ path, without these songs and chapters, shall not rashly ascend the Heavenly Thread nor tread the Mysterious Dipper. To violate the Nine Stars is to have one’s soul and spirit seized and confined beneath the Dipper’s thread. This causes madness and loss of nature, anger and delusion arising; within three years, none escape death. The dao does not wish for people to become immortals without understanding the dao’s deep origins. How could one not proceed with care?  

The Nine Stars are the roots of the Nine Heavens, the bright essences of Jade Clarity; the Nine Souls are the bright spirits of the Nine Stars. People only know the marvel of stepping the Seven Stars but not the supreme numinosity of the Nine Stars’ souls and spirits. The Seven Stars alone do not wish to carry people up to the Dipper; the body’s soul and spirit fear the Dipper Stars’ numinous spirits and dare not follow to soar. To cultivate the flying step path, one must know the Dipper Stars’ souls and spirits, the Nine Imperial Ladies’ inner names and hidden formulas. According to the chart, to cultivate is to surely ascend the Northern Origin, pay homage to the shining morning. But this dao is lofty and subtle, the Jade Clarity treasure secret not widely practiced, few mid-level immortals attain it. Those who know its method find the Nine Stars reflect inward, the Ladies descend to their seats, the Dipper’s soul feels joy, and together they rise within the Nine Primalities’ inner palace.

---

### The Perfected One Star is Heaven’s Minister of Works, governing immortals, overseeing the Nine Heavens’ high true ones above, supervising the Five Sacred Mountains’ numinous immortals in the middle, commanding those who study the dao and true immortals below; none are exempt. The star encircles seven hundred and seventy li, also crystal and glazed water, within grows a jade tree with yellow fruit, a golden-winged bird perches there, naturally producing yellow essence jade mushrooms; eating one bite grants thirty million years of life. The star has twelve gates, each with four rays of light, brightly shining across nine hundred million li. Above is the Yellow Platform Jade Tower, home of the Perfected One, called the Sun True Primordial Palace Yellow Platform Jade Tower Chief Immortal Radiance Lord, surname Gui, given name Miao Yin Guang, style Tong Du Yuan Du Ning Zhi. His head wears the Flying Morning Precious Crown, robes of blue feathers and flying garments, holding the Dipper’s blue register, seated within the jade tower. There is a mysterious name Fang Zhu; those who know it understand the Radiance Lord’s inner name. Those who know the Radiance Morning’s descent and the Perfected One’s mysterious descent cultivate this path to fly through the vast void and ascend within the twelve registers.  

To cultivate the flying step path, one must not tread the Perfected One Star, but stand on the Aide Star, the so-called resting beneath the Celestial Canopy.  

---

The Northern Old True Sovereign said:  
“If you wish to soar your body, do not disturb the Perfected One; if you wish to fly, do not violate the Heavenly Thread; if you wish to become an immortal, you must worship the Radiance Morning. When walking the dao, avoid the Perfected One Star, stand upon the Aide Star, bow to the Perfected One, face the Radiance Morning, and seek to fly the void.”  

The Aide Star is called Void; the Assistant Star is called Constant. Constant means constant yang; Void means hidden. Its secret name must not be passed by word of mouth.

The Nine Morning Mysterious Chart Golden Slip text says:  
“To cultivate the flying steps of the Nine Mornings, one should also follow the days of walking the Heavenly Thread, practicing both to hasten the speed of flying through Heaven, as the Mysterious Dipper often verifies. If practicing both, one should first walk the Nine Mornings, then walk the Heavenly Thread. These two methods have different incantations but are originally the same method.  

The Heavenly Thread was once bestowed by the Great Microcosm Emperor to the Supreme Clear Cavern True Lord. Walking the Heavenly Thread, flying the Earth Record, relying on the Mysterious Dipper, climbing the Dipper’s chief star, joining the Nine True Ones, riding the flying dragon, roaming the Three Lives, floating the Three Births, solidifying the Three Treasures, expelling the Six Harms, hiding the Six Yin, entering the Six Records, calming Heaven’s heroes, guarding the extension of time, preserving the primordial support, treading the Great Aide, using the flowing elixir chamber, ascending the Literary Prosperity, turning through the Nine Paths, ranked among the Nine Elders.  

Walking it for twenty years, one receives the book and becomes a Supreme Clear Perfected One. Ordinary people see the Seven Stars as near, not knowing the step is very far. Daoists who know the Heavenly Thread can step it, but if they do not know that the soul and spirit do not follow the body, it is not that the body will not bring the soul and spirit, but that the soul and spirit fear the Seven Stars’ numinous spirits and dare not follow the body to ascend. Therefore, the three souls are not gathered, the seven spirits scatter, merely stepping the thread with an empty corpse, the spirit does not follow me, truly futile.  

If you wish to step the thread, clear your heart and quiet your mind, do not think of sorrow or bitterness, do not recall the Fiery Mars Star. Then circle three times, ascend the star and open the incantation, allowing soul and spirit to pass the numinous gate together, suddenly releasing the body, swiftly forgetting, pure and clean, then step, always as if treading the void. One year avoids calamity, two years avoids war, three years avoids death, four years becomes an Earth Immortal, a thousand harms and myriad evils dare not interfere. From then on, blessings and celebrations arise without end, causing spirits to serve and be efficacious, harnessing the flying dragon, the Great Ultimate bestowing mushrooms, the Jade Emperor giving boys. After twenty-seven years, one becomes a Supreme Clear Perfected One.  

Do not step the thread horizontally to interfere with the thread, but draw straight lines connecting the stars’ boundaries, called the thread. Violating and crossing the Heavenly Thread is to cut off Heaven’s dao, a great prohibition. Do not tread the Perfected One Star, a grave taboo. Violating these two requires removing the cap, kowtowing to apologize to the thread’s image, making a cloth nine chi long and six chi wide, arranging the star positions on the cloth with blue brush for stars, cinnabar brush for thread, storing it in a clean box. Whenever wishing to practice, burn incense and take it out, attended by seven jade girls and seven jade boys guarding the stars. Women walking the thread use crimson cloth.  

---
