## Scripture of the Most High’s Flying Steps among the Five Stars

To step among the Five Stars: before ascending the starry constellations’ power, and upon completing the descent from their might, one must first preserve the essence of the Five Stars within one’s five viscera. When preservation is complete, knock the teeth five times to open the passages, swallow saliva five times, and softly intone:

*The Five Stars arrayed and shining bright,  
Illuminating the five directions’ light.  
Mercury dispels disaster’s sway,  
Wood’s virtue brings flourishing day.  
Mars’ glow consumes all ill fate,  
Venus wards off war and hate.  
Saturn anchors the four points’ might,  
Blessing home and realm with right.  
Names carved on jade slips’ scroll,  
Recorded deep within the imperial soul.  
Riding the whirlwind, scattering rays,  
Soaring through the vast celestial ways.  
Entering and leaving the dark unknown,  
Wandering and feasting in the Ten Directions’ throne.  
Five clouds cover, beckoning the staff,  
Summoning winds, gathering all craft,  
So that myriad spirits may ascend,  
To serve the immortal lords’ command.*

Finished.  
Set the mind rightly toward the constellation’s gate, and at the moment of ascending or descending the constellation’s power, preserve this blessing. Hold the breath and ascend the constellation’s power; first call the names of the Five Stars and their consorts. Only then cross the constellation and tread upon the stars.  
First lift both feet upon Venus; from Venus ascend to Saturn; from Saturn to Mars; from Mars to Jupiter; from Jupiter to Mercury; from Mercury return to Venus.  
Repeat thrice. Then again hold breath and ascend the constellation’s power, following the old method of going back and forth fifteen times.  
At each star, call aloud the names of the star lord and their consort, touch the heart with the left hand, and intone: *Flying Immortal.*

The scripture says:  
When acting, always face north holding the secret book while performing the rites. This is because the beginner of the true mystery has not yet ventured into the subtle and distant, does not understand the foremost direction of the stars, nor recognize the pointing and establishment of the Mysterious Dipper. Therefore, one must face north holding the book to gradually seek understanding.  
Once the meaning of the book is grasped, and the stars’ turning and timing are known, one should follow the direction the Dipper points and proceed accordingly. Thus, there is no fixed direction, and one does not always face north.  
All facing north is only for beginners.  
It is feared that this may be understood by analogy and association, and no further questioning is needed.

The Most High Perfected One’s path of stepping among the Five Stars is to govern the Five Stars descending into the chamber. Holding breath and ascending the constellation’s power, first call the names of the Five Stars and their consorts. Only then cross the constellation and tread upon the stars.  
At the first ascent, pause firmly and call the names; only then cross the constellation and tread the stars.  
At each star, it is best to again call aloud the names of the star and consort to strengthen the effect.  
If tedious and repetitive, one may follow the old method.  
In former times, Master Yushe Gong, Beilian Zisheng, and Elder Changling all used this method to ascend to Heaven, not shying from difficulty or hardship.  
What is called governing life waits for the right moment.  
The busy merchant’s striving, does he fear the muddy shore? He only seeks money and goods.  
If one seeks the Dao with the diligence of a merchant, how could one not attain immortality?  
But alas, beginners all say they exert utmost effort, yet then slacken and neglect.  
Like a cart with worn parts, its hundred joints loosen and fall; like a burdened ox traveling far, its steps falter and slow.  
This is what learners suffer and what those who succeed laugh at—such are the matters.  
If one can deeply study the inner mirror, one will be stirred by the spirit and receive the inspiration of a spiritual person, riding the chariot of the stars and constellations.  
The Five Star chart is always oriented southward, because Venus is in the west and Jupiter in the east.  
This is because the Five Stars hide and shift without fixed position, unlike the Northern Dipper’s constellations, which are always fixed and thus positioned in the five directions, not following the stars’ locations.  
The Three Eight Scenes combine the Twenty-Four Spirits; reciting them in order is also possible.  
One may instantly preserve the Three Eight Scenes at once, or at dawn preserve the upper scene, at midday the middle scene, and at midnight the lower scene—this depends on one’s intention.  
If the outer body dwells in a secluded cavern, cut off from worldly affairs, and the inner mind contemplates the spirit’s gate, gathering true morning breath, then at dawn one may instantly preserve the Three Eight Scenes, and at the three times each may again preserve one scene, which is even better.  
But worldly affairs are many and this is difficult to do regularly; if affairs cannot be constant, one’s merit will naturally be slight.  
Formerly, Lord Wang of the Western City and the Perfected One of Tong [illegible], both followed this path.  
According to the *Baoxuan Yulu Baijian Qingjing* scripture:  
*Those who do not preserve the Twenty-Four Spirits nor know the names of the Three Eight Scenes cannot be peaceful commoners, nor ministers of the later sages.*

Hear all and silence sound,  
Three souls gather essence,

## Secret Formula of the Most High Perfected One

On the spring day of Yimao, summer day of Bingwu, autumn day of Gengshen, winter day of Renzi, at the time of darkness outside, first grind vermilion and realgar finely and evenly, wrap in cotton to the size of a jujube.  
At the appointed time, place in both ears.  
This dispels the Three Corpses and refines the Seven Souls—secret method, do not let the knowledgeable know.  
At noon the next day, bathe in the east-flowing water.  
After bathing, tidy the bed and bedding, change clothes, wash the old clothes, replace worn shoes, and bathe again.  
Then sweep wine under the bed in the sleeping chamber, ensuring the room is clean.  
Settle the pillow and lie down, face upward, hold breath firmly for a long while, then softly intone:

*Heaven’s Dao is constant,  
Changing old for new,  
The Supreme Emperor’s auspicious day,  
Bathing to become true,  
Three breaths dispel corpses,  
Vermilion and realgar secure the soul,  
Treasure refines the seven souls,  
With me intimately.*

This is the supreme method to dispel and refine corpse filth, the key to changing and renewing the form.  
Only one day of each season is taken for this.

## The Most High Perfected One says:

The former master taught: on the five arrival days, when the sun rises three or four zhang high, stand upright, face the sun with the heart, preserve the three souls and spirits entering the heart with the sun’s light.  
After a long while, hold breath for three breaths, swallow saliva three times, softly intone:

*The sun scatters radiance,  
Hanging light purple and blue,  
Entering my soul,  
Illuminating my five forms,  
Repelling ghosts and testing the heart,  
Making the heart calm and correct,  
Within thoroughly nine breaths,  
Without connecting to the fetal life,  
Flying immortal to Upper Clarity,  
Jade slips already fixed.*

Finished, wipe the eyes twenty-seven times with the hand, knock teeth twenty-seven times, all finished.  
This method makes the three souls bright and clear, the true heart upright, all evil and hidden arts tested and not effective—truly essential Dao.  
Always practice it.

---

On the five arrival days, face the sun and induce sneezing.  
If unable to sneeze, use a soft object to guide the nose toward the sun, which will cause sneezing.  
After sneezing, intone:

*Heaven’s light comes in,  
Six fetuses ascend and connect,  
Three souls guard the spirit,  
Seven souls do not perish,  
Following the sun’s sneeze,  
Together with the sun god,  
Flying immortal to Upper Clarity,  
Positioned as True Lord.*

Finished blessing, wipe the eyes twenty-seven times.  
This internally refines essence and connects with the sun’s light, making the three souls bright within, opening the mind and spirit, resolving all essence, circulating within the inner palace.  
If not the five arrival days, this is not necessary.

---

## On the Five Arrival Days, face north and bow five times, calling in the heart the names of the Supreme True Sovereign Lord and consort three times, then knock teeth five times, remove the headscarf and kneel long, and respectfully say:

*Five Stars, Sun, Moon, Supreme True Sovereign Lords,  
Sovereign Lords and Consorts of the Dao,  
Jade Clarity, Most High, Upper Clarity, Supreme Sovereign Emperor,  
Great Dao Holy Lords before me,  
From my seven ancestors and grandparents down to myself,  
Confessing a thousand sins and myriad faults,  
Since past lifetimes, I beseech liberation.  
The Three Officials command all bureaus,  
To release and absolve all charges,  
Erase the black register,  
I beseech to join the true Five Stars,  
Together to hasten to the splendid stars,  
Ascending Upper Clarity,  
Passing through the Jade Gate,  
Ascending Jade Clarity,  
High and supreme chamber,  
Ascending Profound Void,  
Golden script and Jade Clarity,  
Name inscribed in Upper Clarity,  
Granted the title of True Lord,  
Name inscribed in Most High,  
Granted the title of Jade True,  
Flying through the vast space,  
Granted the title of Jade Noble.*
