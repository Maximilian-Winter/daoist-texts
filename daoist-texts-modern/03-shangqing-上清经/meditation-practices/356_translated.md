## The Most High Scripture of the Five Stars and Seven Primordials’ Eternal Void Secret

### Diagram of the Seven Primordials

The dao of flying among the Five Stars is to seek the steps of Water, Wood, Fire, Earth, and Metal—the Five Stars descending—to summon the numinous cloud and feather canopy, ascending the steps of the Great Mystery. The method of Gu Xizi instructs: close the breath and ascend the stellar rigors, going back and forth fifteen times. Each time you reach a star, place your left hand upon your heart and silently recite: “The Five Stars arrayed shine forth, so and so.” Before mounting the rigors, first preserve the essence of the Five Stars within the five viscera. After each step upon the rigors, press and perform this act. Practiced for fourteen years, the dragon flies by day; the essential dao is inscribed on the tally slips—this is the diagram.

The Most High Perfected One’s Way of stepping the Five Stars is to cause the Five Stars to descend into the chamber. Closing the breath, ascending the rigors, one must first call the names of the Five Star Sovereigns and their consorts; only then cross the rigors and tread the stars. At the moment of first mounting the rigors, pause and call their names; when finished, then cross the rigors and step upon the stars. Each time you reach a star, it is even better to again center your heart and call the name of the star you have arrived at. If this is too troublesome or difficult, simply follow the old method. In ancient times, Yusha Gong, Beili Zisheng, and the Elder of Changling all ascended to Heaven by this method, never complaining of difficulty. This is what is called governing life. Merchants, busy and anxious, do they fear hardship? Their only aim is money and goods. If seekers of the dao were as diligent as merchants, how could they fail to become immortals? But alas, beginners all say they will exert themselves fully, only to slacken later, like a cart about to break with every joint loosening, or an ox bearing a heavy load stumbling on a long journey. This is the trouble of late learners and the laughter of those who have succeeded—such is the way of these folk. If one can truly refine the inner mirror of the heart, this will stir the spirit and bring forth a numinous being to awaken the novice, bearing the chariot of stars and light.

The diagram of the Five Stars always faces south, for Venus is in the west, Jupiter in the east. This is because the Five Stars hide and reveal, their arrangement shifting without constancy. Unlike the Great Dipper’s fixed array, always in one place, set firmly in the five directions, not following the stars’ wandering locations.

The Most Pure Perfected One said: When stepping the Five Stars, before mounting the stellar rigors and after descending them, always first preserve the essence of the Five Stars within my five viscera. When preserved, knock the teeth five times to open the passages, swallow saliva five times, and softly recite:

> The Five Celestial Bodies arrayed across,  
> Radiant and bright in the five directions,  
> Water Star repels disaster,  
> Wood Star brings prosperity,  
> Mars dispels calamity,  
> Venus wards off war,  
> The Stationary Star guards the four quarters.  
> I gain benefit and truth,  
> Names carved on jade slips,  
> Recorded in the imperial archives,  
> Riding the rushing wind and fanning the light,  
> Flying through the vast void,  
> Entering and exiting the dark unknown,  
> Roaming and feasting in the Ten Directions,  
> Covered by five clouds,  
> Summoning spirits and harnessing winds,  
> Commanding myriad numinous beings,  
> Ascending as an Immortal Lord.  
> Complete.

Set your heart rightly facing the rigors’ mouth, and recite this at the moment of ascending or descending.

### The Five Star Sovereigns and Their Consorts

- **Eastern Jupiter True Sovereign:** Named Chenglan, styled Qingning. His consort is Baorong, styled Feiyun.  
- **Southern Mars True Sovereign:** Named Weiting, styled Sanrong. His consort is Huaping, styled Xuanluo.  
- **Central Stationary Star True Sovereign:** Named Canglu, styled Tanyan. His consort is Kongyao, styled Feixian.  
- **Western Venus True Sovereign:** Named Liaoling, styled Zhenxun. His consort is Souying, styled Ling’en.  
- **Northern Water Star True Sovereign:** Named Xianxu, styled Jingyuan. His consort is Xuanhua, styled Longe.

When closing the breath and ascending the rigors, first call the names of the Five Stars and their consorts. Only then cross the rigors and tread the stars. First raise both feet onto Venus, from Venus ascend to the Stationary Star, from Stationary to Mars, from Mars to Wood Star, from Wood Star to Water Star, then from Water Star return to tread Venus. This is done three times. Then again close the breath and ascend the rigors, going back and forth fifteen times according to the old method. Each time you reach a star, call out the Sovereign and consort’s names, place your left hand upon your heart, and silently recite as above.

### The Scripture Says

When performing the practice, always face north holding the secret scripture. This is because beginners of the true mystery have not yet ventured far, do not understand the stars’ positions or the Great Dipper’s pointing, nor know the subtle directions. Therefore, they face north holding the book to gradually seek understanding. Once the meaning of the text is grasped and the stars’ movements are known with the times, one should follow the pointing of the Dipper and adjust the steps accordingly. Thus, there is no fixed direction, and not all facing north. All facing north is only for beginners. This may be understood by analogy and need not be further asked.

### The Three Eight Phases and the Twenty-Four Spirits

The Three Eight Phases combine with the Twenty-Four Spirits; reciting them in order is also possible. One may instantly preserve the Three Eight at once, or preserve the upper phase at dawn, the middle phase at midday, and the lower phase at midnight, according to one’s intention. If one’s outer body dwells in a secluded cavern, cut off from worldly affairs, inwardly contemplating the spirit palace and gathering true morning breath, then at dawn one may instantly preserve the Three Eight phases, and at the three times each may be preserved again, which is even better. But the world is full of affairs, and this is troublesome and difficult to do regularly. When affairs cannot be constant, the benefit lessens. In former times, Lord Wang of the Western City and the Perfected of Tongwu both followed this path. According to the *Baoxuan Yulu Baijian Qingjing*, those who do not preserve the Twenty-Four Spirits or do not know the names of the Three Eight phases cannot be commoners of Great Peace, nor ministers of the Later Sage.

### The Most Pure Perfected One Said

To transform and divide the form, to hide and sink into the eight directions, to conceal the body and hide the image, to enter the void and create the dark, to come forth and bring all things, to hunt and capture all villains, one must constantly cultivate the essence and thought of the eternal void. On the Eight Festival days and the Six Ding days one also cultivates this. If days coincide, one may practice twice, or continue after stepping the rigors, which is also good. This is the way of hidden sinking.

### The Eternal Void Rigors Bear Twenty-Five Black Points:

1. The first point on earth is called Nine Constant; dwell here to escape form.  
2. The second point named Nurturing Constant; transforms body into grasses and myriad things.

4. The fourth named Flow Constant; escapes as breath, transforms as breath.  
5. The fifth named Moving Constant; escapes as fire.  
6. The sixth named Upper Constant; people say it is above heaven and below earth.  
7. The seventh named Heaven Constant; escapes as fire.  
8. The eighth named Mysterious Constant; escapes as water.  
9. The ninth named Three Constant; escapes war.

25. The twenty-fifth named Six Constant; escapes ghosts that kill people.

The path of stepping the Eternal Void begins at Nine Constant, each time arriving at the eleventh central star’s place, softly reciting:

> Four bright upper origins,  
> Sun and moon’s breath bright,  
> Flowing light shining radiantly,  
> Twenty-five stars,

The nine heads are gathered in disheveled cloud buns. When closing the breath and ascending the rigors, first call the names of the nine inner consorts, then proceed to tread the stars.

Venus hangs horizontally, scattering sharp rays, then emits three parts and two golden sparks, illuminating the boiling expanding universe and flowing field—the Mysterious Chamber of the bright and dense Venus star. Suspended horizontally, scattering among the sharp points, spreading across the Nine Heavens. The Perfected One says this star has seven rays, always preserving the emission of three rays to the west and two rays to the south. Thus, golden brilliance pierces the eyes, the diagram shines with boiling awe. Penetrating the self, one may enter the star spirits and the palaces of the expanding universe and flowing light. Within the palace is the Mysterious Chamber, where one rests and roams, bowing as a Perfected One. These are all the palace names within the Venus star.

## Practicing the Most High Secret Scripture

The scripture says: When performing the practice, always face north holding the secret scripture. This is because beginners of the true mystery have not yet ventured far, do not understand the stars’ positions or the Great Dipper’s pointing, nor know the subtle directions. Therefore, they face north holding the book to gradually seek understanding. Once the meaning of the text is grasped and the stars’ movements are known with the times, one should follow the pointing of the Dipper and adjust the steps accordingly. Thus, there is no fixed direction, and not all facing north. All facing north is only for beginners. This may be understood by analogy and need not be further asked.

The Most High Perfected One’s Way of stepping the Five Stars is to cause the Five Stars to descend into the chamber. Closing the breath, ascending the rigors, one must first call the names of the Five Star Sovereigns and their consorts; only then cross the rigors and tread the stars. At the moment of first mounting the rigors, pause and call their names; when finished, then cross the rigors and step upon the stars. Each time you reach a star, it is even better to again center your heart and call the name of the star you have arrived at. If this is too troublesome or difficult, simply follow the old method. In ancient times, Yusha Gong, Beili Zisheng, and the Elder of Changling all ascended to Heaven by this method, never complaining of difficulty. This is what is called governing life.

This is the trouble of late learners and the laughter of those who have succeeded—such is the way of these folk. If one can truly refine the inner mirror of the heart, this will stir the spirit and bring forth a numinous being to awaken the novice, bearing the chariot of stars and light.

But the world is full of affairs, and this is troublesome and difficult to do regularly. When affairs cannot be constant, the benefit lessens. In former times, Lord Wang of the Western City and the Perfected of Tongwu both followed this path. According to the *Baoxuan Yulu Baijian Qingjing*, those who do not preserve the Twenty-Four Spirits or do not know the names of the Three Eight phases cannot be commoners of Great Peace, nor ministers of the Later Sage.

### Receiving the Great Cavern True Scripture

One must receive the highest dao methods, wearing no borrowed headgear or clothing, using no shared vessels, nor sharing carriage, clothing, bed, or bedding. This is to block the filthy and impure paths, preventing the coming and going of evil winds. This is very easy to do but often made difficult by lack of faith in the dao, desiring to fly but falling back into sinking.

Those who cultivate the cavern chamber and practice the Seven Primordials’ steps, upon first waking, upon first going outside, and after finishing a meal, first softly recite:

> Five Emperors and Five Passages,  
> Jade-character cavern chamber,  
> Returning to the primordial hidden dao,  
> Opening the seven dawns,  
> The mysterious father who births the soul,  
> Transforms one into spirit,  
> The mysterious mother who births the corporeal soul,  
> Transforms two into the living body,  
> The lord who governs my sinews and bones,  
> The white origin who nourishes my vital energy,  
> Longevity and long vision,  
> Flying immortal of the Ten Heavens.  
> Complete.

Do not let ears hear this blessing’s sound. This is the Most High secret blessing, to dispel evil qi and bring forth spirit. To transform and divide the form, to hide and sink into the eight directions, to conceal the body and hide the image, to enter the void and create the dark, to come forth and bring all things, to hunt and capture all villains, one must cultivate the essence and thought of the eternal void. On the Eight Festival days and the Six Ding days one also cultivates this. If days coincide, one may practice twice, or continue after stepping the rigors, which is also good. This is the essential way of hidden sinking.

When closing the breath and ascending the rigors, first call the names of the Five Stars and their consorts. Only then cross the rigors and tread the stars. First raise both feet onto Venus, from Venus ascend to the Stationary Star, from Stationary to Mars, from Mars to Wood Star, from Wood Star to Water Star, then from Water Star return to tread Venus. This is done three times. Then again close the breath and ascend the rigors, going back and forth fifteen times according to the old method. Each time you reach a star, call out the Sovereign and consort’s names, place your left hand upon your heart, and silently recite as above.
