## Scripture of the Supreme Clarity on the Five Constants’ Transformations and Myriad Metamorphoses of the Obscure Netherworld

The Most High Great Dao Lord declared:  
“The Void Constant is the soul and spirit of Heaven and Earth, the majestic potency of yin and yang. The Void is the soul essence of the Nine Heavens; the Constant is the spirit soul of the Nine Earths. These two energies conjoin to form the Great God of Imperial Veneration, whose radiance assists and supports the luminous majesty. The Void Constant, by means of this assistance, serves as the watchful gaze, directing the celestial light, observing the myriad directions, overseeing the heavenly constellations, revolving and transforming the Five Constants, summoning and gathering, hastening the turning and transmission of mechanisms. When Heaven rests and Earth is peaceful, the Void Constant conceals itself; when Heaven is obstructed and Earth is agitated, the Void Constant shines forth. Auspicious and inauspicious retributions are immediately announced; the transformations of myriad energies, the alternations of yin and yang, the cycles of the four seasons—all proceed from it. Therefore, these two stars are noble and exalted, hidden and veiled in splendid dawns; they embody the wondrous delight of the Void Constant, rarely beheld repeatedly. To behold these two stars is to extend life without end; to preserve and cultivate their dao is to ascend to the splendid hall, to grasp the secret words of the Supreme Truth—this is what is meant.”

The Prime Minister Qing Tong Lord respectfully asked:  
“The dao of the Void Constant, its numinous sound and wondrous preciousness—how may one hear it?”

The Most High Great Dao Lord replied:  
“The Void Constant is the ultimate name of Heaven and Earth, yet it is called nameless; it is the mingling into oneness, thus becoming named. But the Nine Heavens conceal its numinous sound, not allowing it to circulate in scriptures. It operates assistance and support as sight and hearing, relying on light and shadow to communicate truth. The Imperial Veneration receives it to bring about governance; the learner commands it to attain immortality. Those with intention seek it in the unfathomable, thus naming it as named. Named yet not transmitted to the vast ignorant masses, none can fathom it, lovers of it yet do not obtain its truth. How then could it be the foundation for encouraging learning? Yet the Nine Heavens decree: only those with the mysterious charts and jade characters inscribed on tablets, destined to be perfected in future lives, may partake in the hidden name. You shall oversee all directions, test myriad immortals, settle the subtle mysteries, rescue the multitudes; do not recklessly disclose this secret—keep it hidden.”

Thus the Lord ascended above the crimson chambers of the celestial spirit, purified for three months, tore silk to announce to the numinous, with golden sheep and silver wild goose offerings, reverently receiving the truth from Heaven. The Dao Lord declared:  
“The Nine Heavens impose prohibitions, decreed to be transmitted once in myriad kalpas, allowing the cycles to interweave and complete, the qi to return to Supreme Clarity, the dao to be practiced now. According to the profound method, within seven hundred years there will be one who hears the three transmissions; if none arise, the seal returns to the Nine Heavens, or is entrusted to the chambers of the nine caves on sacred mountains. To lightly divulge or be negligent brings blame upon the seven ancestors, who draw in the dark waves to flood the four rivers, bear the mountains to fill the seas and rivers. This is the retribution of calamity and blessing—no error or loss. You must clearly examine these words and act with caution.”

---

The Most High’s method of walking the Void Constant: on its appointed days, purify oneself, burn incense, isolate in a separate chamber, avoid human affairs, practice secretly. Calm the heart and fix the mind, preserve and contemplate the numinous truth, array the stars clearly, and gradually walk the thread. Within five years, the Imperial Venerables and Imperial Consorts descend without fail, the Primordial Emperor and Five Stars all shine upon, illuminating the form within, transforming myriad spirits. After seven years, divide form into myriad lights, conceal traces in nine voids. After fourteen years, fly through the Great Void, ascend the Dipper’s morning. If bound by worldly affairs, upon receiving the scripture, though not yet mastering walking the steps, on appointed days burn incense and hold the scripture, face north to the stars, preserve and contemplate the numinous truth, beseech gods and immortals—thus ward off myriad disasters, repel misfortune, spirits clear and body pure, return years and reverse aging. Thus fourteen years extend life by seven hundred years. Carelessness, negligence, and leaks bring ruin to a household, punish seven ancestors. The correspondence of sin and blessing is clear and manifest.

After a long while, again contemplate the nine stars, the five star imperial lords, and imperial consorts, the nine star inner concubines, their surnames, names, styles, and garments, each in their star palaces, clearly arrayed. Suddenly, all the gods solemnly unite and transform into a small child, like a newborn infant, named the Unchanging Child, styled the Transformation Spirit King, holding the nine stars and five stars, wearing tassels all over, bearing sun and moon. The child uses the light of sun, moon, and stars to illuminate and perfume the destined body, the body within the red light, wrapped and penetrating thoroughly, thus becoming the dao of myriad transformations. Then inhale qi nine times, and softly recite:
