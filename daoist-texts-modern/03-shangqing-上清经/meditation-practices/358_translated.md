## Scripture of the Inner Mystery of the Supreme Clarity River Chart — Volume One

The Mysterious Master, the Sacred Artisan, passed down from generation to generation, their inspiration waxing and waning like light and darkness. Good and evil alternate, one falls as another rises, sinking only to rise again, severed only to reconnect anew. Lofty pride drifts endlessly, forever severing the roots of goodness. Yet with utmost care and secrecy, virtue grows green and lush; through affinity, goodness can be felt. Mysterious responses come again and again; when they come, the extraordinary appears. The extraordinary leads to divine communication; the divine master’s spiritual scripture, secret words and essential texts, descend naturally to be seen. They cleanse filth and dispel dust; the subtle awareness reverently follows. Long life, divine immortals, aid the body and rescue all beings. The Three Vehicles unfold mutually, the hidden and manifest never abandoned. Those who do not follow will sink into ruin; suffering is painful indeed. All should fear and be cautious, ending as they begin, thus harmonizing with the Dao.

All true texts of nature exist originally in the void; thus they sometimes fly, sometimes sink, sometimes hide, sometimes appear. Dragon, horse, turtle, fish—each bears the diagram and image, born without beginning, manifesting according to feeling, appearing unevenly. Only goodness is true. Those who attain it come later; its text has long existed before. What is gained now is the same as what was gained then: all are golden and jade slips, carved and written in secret stores, memorized and thoroughly understood. Preserving and reciting, cultivating and practicing, also uses silk and linen, written in vermilion to wear on the body, guarding against forgetfulness. In urgency, seek details and act to dispel calamities, reverse misfortune and extend blessings. Long practice without slackening leads to ascending to the holy true immortals.

Teachers and disciples keep pure and clean, opening mysteries and reporting to spirits. Not to be transmitted carelessly by mortals; reckless leakage brings deep calamity. Each must be especially cautious, secretive, and obedient.

### Secret Taboos of the Great Unity — Two Sections

Great Unity is the child of the Dao. The Dao responds to the world’s call, manifesting the divine to give birth to One. One divine guides and generates all things, boundless and infinite. Before learning, one must first awaken to this and practice it to attain utmost truth. The true saints pass it down to guide later learners. Later learners, awakening and following, become one with the former; becoming one with the former means becoming one with the Dao.

The Three Powers and Five Virtues, the Nine Sovereigns and honored spirits—these are the origins and extremes of transformation and salvation for all beings. First, the One governs hidden and manifest, the ancestor of formlessness. Second, the Mysterious Origin begins the mingling of qi for Heaven, Earth, and Humanity. Humans have sharpness, dullness, and balance; Heaven and Earth respond as three grades; separation and union as five; three times three makes nine, with transformation complete. Refining the non-existent and the existent, existence and non-existence penetrate each other, relying on the perfect person.

Man models Earth, Earth models Heaven, Heaven models Dao, Dao models Nature. The Three Powers have form and can practice the Dao; practicing the Dao to the end matches Nature. Though differences number five, all return to one source. Therefore, the spirit of Great Unity is most honored and noble, giving birth to Heaven and establishing Earth, creating humans and things.

Those who do not receive the original source of the River Chart, do not wear the true characters, do not recognize the original Great Unity, do not preserve the Five Spirits, do not keep the Three Ones, do not serve the Nine Sovereigns, cannot practice the Great Thanks. When making Great Thanks, one must summon and report widely, honoring the supreme secret taboo, the inner spirit’s hidden name. Without receiving from a master, do not recklessly practice. Practice and use must be received from a master, and when conditions allow, follow the ceremony of the Mysterious Covenant. According to this ceremony, one must not rashly create a method and forcefully practice it. Doing so incurs guilt, harming oneself and others.

Those who sincerely wish to practice must secretly seek a clear master and find the ceremony of the Mysterious Covenant. With a focused heart and pure self, natural encounters occur. Following the prescribed steps, first open and report; after the petition, set up the ritual offering with sincerity, being cautious and secretive. Violations will be examined and punished. Diligence and earnestness bring blessings; blessings accumulate virtue and coexist with the Dao.

The Great Unity honored spirit, taboo Wuyoushou, also called Guihuichang, one name Jieming, another Jipin. Through accumulated good causes, encountering this true taboo, secretly recognizing and preserving it in the heart, moving and still reciting spells, begging for wishes, all according to heart’s desire, must not be told to others. If not the proper person, both sides offend. To avoid punishment and gain blessings, keep it in subtle awareness, always seeing the Great Unity honored spirit’s radiant image, dazzling and extraordinary, at one’s side, sometimes sitting, sometimes walking, slow or fast day and night. Diligently preserve and never forget; then misfortune dissipates and good fortune arrives. Over time, speech will come; speech and form unite, becoming one.

Those who cannot maintain constant presence day and night may keep it at night, placing it within their body’s Six Harmonies Palace. Enter between the two eyebrows, one inch in is the Bright Hall, two inches in is the Cavern Chamber. The Cavern Chamber lies south, the Bright Hall north; this is the Six Harmonies Palace, above which is the Supreme Ultimate Palace. Great Unity dwells in the Supreme Ultimate by day, in the Six Harmonies by night. Constantly preserving this, one’s practice renews daily; demons dare not invade.

If one does not know Great Unity and practices empty merit, evil will break it, and virtue and achievements will not form. For learners seeking attainment, preserving the One is urgent.

Assisting Star Supreme Official Jade Tower Purple Pavilion Imperial True Original Morning Sovereign, Sovereign Empress, High Sovereign Right Empress;

Giant Gate Chou Hai Yin Essence Central Palace Five-colored Jade Tower Northern Morning Sovereign, Sovereign Empress, Transforming Inner Concubine;

Fortune Store Yin Xu Perfected True Original Palace Yellow Terrace Jade Tower Lord of Immortal Splendor Morning Sovereign, Sovereign Empress, Upper Original Mother;

Literary Tune Mao You Mysterious Darkness Knot Hidden Palace Vermilion Terrace Jade Tower Mysterious Upper Flying Canopy Morning Sovereign, Sovereign Empress, Origin Inner Concubine;

Honest and Chaste Chen Shen Cinnabar Origin Ridge Divine Palace White Terrace Golden Jade Tower Golden Leader of Seven Morning Sovereigns, Sovereign Empress, Fighting Central Eldest Daughter;

Respectfully petition the Seven Spirit Great Gods, Nine Essence Imperial Mornings, Four Venerables to observe, bestow compassion from the heart, grant descending cloud chariot, move holy light ceremony. With Zhonghe Lord, Ten Thousand Blessings Lord, Longevity Lord, Life-loving Lord, Clear Calculation Lord, Record Keeper Lord, Fate Settler Lord, Rewarding Good Lord, Wish-responding Lord, with spirit boys and girls, direct talisman officers, true officials, righteous generals and cavalry, all officials, descend here to such village’s exposed altar, observe such person’s reverent feelings, accept such humble offerings. Your servant such and such and such, connected by Dao righteousness, from beginning to end with cause, feelings like bone and blood, united in heart and earth. Your servant returns homage to the Nine Sovereigns, Seven Saints and Great Spirits, Great Dao Utmost Truth, all Lords and Masters. Your servant sincerely fearful, bows twice.”

Then pour wine into cups, take three pinchings and three offerings of wine, totaling nine pinchings, completing nine offerings of oranges. Declare the Three Treasures disciple your servant such and such, reporting to the Seven Spirit Great Gods, Nine Essence Imperial Mornings, bright spirits and high venerables, Dao and virtue lords, all righteous spirits. Your servant now has the same meaning, such prefecture, county, township, names, today carefully writes and reads as listed. Humbly wishes all spirits to observe and reflect on these words, and your servant now sets up this humble ritual, carefully handling the life cloth as dry silk several feet long, your servant goes to the respective lords and empresses according to order of jade mechanism, begging to redeem your servant’s destined broken fate, asking for renewed grace. Humbly wishes all sovereigns and empresses to compassionately accept your servant’s earnest heart, enjoy this humble ritual, jointly witness and swear the covenant. Humbly hopes all spirits to urge and encourage their sovereigns and empresses, especially bestowing mercy and grace, descending with responsive power, so your servant forever avoids calamity and illness, no longer fears death and sickness, escapes wrongful disasters, myriad calamities dissipate, all directions harmonize, wishes fulfilled as intended, sincere and satisfied, thus your servant reports.

Your servant, though foolish and ignorant, mistakenly participates in true teachings, aims to spread mysterious wind, rescue and protect all, putting others before self, dares not slacken. Now overwhelmed with sincere and earnest feelings, humbly and boldly reports. But life’s movement is truly full of faults, due to ignorance and darkness, misusing truth, causing confusion and losing correctness. Humbly seeks principle in the realm of existence, must not be heartless; the heart’s affairs must leave darkness and approach light. Light must be bright and clear, relying on saints and spirits. When mysterious rewards respond, saints permit worship and thanks, spirits permit mercy. Mercy comes from sincere earnestness; worship and thanks depend on cleansing the heart. When the heart is complete, response begins; repentance of boundless sins. Sincere earnestness calls for respectful offering of sacrificial food and ceremony; when ceremony is proper, divine protection surely arrives; when sins are forgiven, good wishes surely harmonize. Humbly relying on this principle, dares to express the elixir heart. The outer rituals of offering to Heaven and Earth, hoping to sacrifice mountains and rivers, were set by former sages for external governance, later wise ones to complete virtue. Invoking the Five Elders and praying to Great Unity, summoning the Eight Spirits and bringing the Six Gods, the mysterious truth established in the inner methods, clear proclamations continuing to spread the Dao, ranks and order in place, wondrous without error. Therefore, offerings and cultivation should be according to intention, presented timely, noble not wearying of abundance, humble not bound by frugality. Thus, blue silk, qilin and phoenix, jade wine and fine spirits, are the affairs of the highly accomplished, not for the lowly and poor. If the great crane is ashamed to offer to the Emperor, the duckweed to the honored spirit’s majesty, this is not suitable for humble servants to perform, only foolish earnestness to express.

### Essentials of Star Observation

After receiving the Nine Sovereigns’ taboos, on good nights petition Heaven, always carefully observe the Northern Dipper, preserving the order of inner and outer names, imagining seeing the spirit descend, speaking with oneself. Then seek the Auxiliary and Assisting stars, to see their forms, focusing heart and gaze, long seeing them oneself.

Star observation is secret, do not let others know. If asked, answer briefly but do not reveal. Whether seeing or not, do not speak, only heart and eyes know each other. At star observation, cleanse body qi, if dirty bathe, if soiled change clothes. Clothes fragrant, inside and out clean, burn incense where stopping, keep opening the mysterious spirit, thoroughly study scriptures and diagrams, clearly remember and recognize, then go out to observe. Do not rush or speak loudly, nor gather many people; companions may be three at most. If companions are unworthy, do not share. Each does it separately, do not visit each other. If tired, drunk, or in disorder, do not observe. Also perform offerings, thanks, and petitions; long without response is due to not observing. Even if not seeing, sincere heart and feeling, gradually diligent, never slackening or retreating, surely gaining clarity, seeing brings spirit descent, ritual verified, benefits boundless. Unable to focus and practice careful observation, demons come to harm people, evil monsters move, ritual wasted, labor and guilt increase. Those with aspiration, clearly heed this warning.

The nine stars govern different fields, each with territory and harm, all to be avoided. Small matters are averse and warded off, cultivate merit, establish ritual offerings to gain grace, secret and unspoken, calamity dissipates and blessings gather. Merit is myriad good deeds. Ten thousand practices and names, the main nine are:

One, do not kill; two, do not lust; three, do not lie; four, do not steal; five, do not be evil; six, do not anger; seven, do not envy; eight, do not be arrogant; nine, do not be obstructive. These are the nine virtues of those who attain the Dao.

One, release life and save the dying; two, reward chastity and encourage purity; three, offer loyalty and practice faith; four, give charity and remove greed; five, moderate wine and keep correctness; six, harmonize and forgive admonitions; seven, forbid treachery and stop envy; eight, respect and love all ranks; nine, communicate worries and resolve troubles. These are the nine merits, public and impartial. Merit acts outwardly, virtue settles inwardly; inwardly established and outwardly cultivated, spirits surely secretly descend. Talented and diligent, closing mouth to verify oneself, heart transmitting to companions, not to be revealed to others, observing differences and similarities, heart broad and deep. This method’s verification can be known; those without merit see unclearly, or evil spirits confuse their eyes, seeming true but false, speaking ill as good, good turning to ill, contradicting scriptures and writings, should first examine inner faults, then observe again.

All complete, then the Lords and all spirits suddenly merge and transform into one person, one person like a newborn infant, named the Impermanent Child, styled Transformation, left hand holding nine stars, head wearing the sun, mouth holding the moon. The child, with the light of sun, moon, and nine stars, illuminates and perfumes the omen’s whole body, inside and out fully transparent, self-aware, the omen’s body glowing red like fire’s blaze, no longer wrapped, the wrapping all dazzling bright. This is the Imperial Lords’ Great Unity Nine Yin mixed transformation of myriad forms.
