The Nine Imperial Lords and Nine Imperial Consorts conceal their secret surnames and names; knowing them grants longevity of a thousand and a thousand years. Regularly observing them each evening, imagining the majestic and radiant forms of the Lords and Consorts, recalling their surnames and secret names, and deeply storing them in the heart, one may behold the Eighth and Ninth Stars and extend life without end.

The Nine Imperial Lords and Nine Imperial Consorts are the soul essences of the Nine Qi, the spiritual souls of the Nine Heavens, the wondrous images of the Nine Emperors, the mighty spirits of the Nine Transformations. Men and women who study the dao wear these talismans during rituals; coming and going, sitting and lying, contemplating truth, dispelling worry, anger, illness, and calamity, healing disease and supporting decline, cultivating the self and aiding beings, always remembering them, disasters vanish and misfortunes scatter, blessings flow and spirits communicate.

In urgent times, write talismans on bamboo slips with vermilion brush according to the method, bow twice facing north, and drink the well water. Taking it once begins the cycle of nine watches anew; if one, two, or three worries are removed and illness cured, then one may rest. No other incantations are needed—only preserve the nine secret names. Diligently establish good merit, and after nine years without slackening, one will surely attain spiritual power.

The Jade Emperor’s essential teachings must not be recklessly revealed; keep them secret and cultivate them carefully. One’s rank will be that of Perfected Original Lord, associating with the highest sages, the Three Pure Ones, and Perfected Lords. Receiving it, one tears open the plain scroll, sets the chart, announces and transmits it. Keeping the secret name in the heart, one becomes immortal.

---

Those who receive the River Chart must first petition the Nine Imperial Lords’ secret names, observe fasting for nine days, seven days, five days, three days, or one day as appropriate, and set up petitions and announcements accordingly. When the fasting period ends, in mountain lodges or altar halls, one must request quiet and closure, then present the petition as above.
