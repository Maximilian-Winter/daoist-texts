## Supreme Clarity Golden Script Jade Characters Supreme Scripture

### Transmission by Minister Azure Youth Lord

Above the head shines the True Star, while thoughts dwell on the Grotto Chamber Deity; the right foot points to the Emperor Star, the left foot to the Venerable Star. When present, slightly bend the left foot to face the stars. The left hand grasps the Northern Platform, the right hand holds the Jade Root, silently preserving the incantation until complete, reclining within the Northern Dipper itself. Practiced for nine years, death is removed and life ascends, the name inscribed in the Ministerial Registers. Practiced for eighteen years, the Nine Essences descend, cloud chariots come to greet. The Jade Root is the essence of the Binding Star. The Northern Platform is the essence of the Primordial Star.

Reclining within the Nine Dipper, the heart yearns to fly as an immortal Supreme True One, sheltered beneath the celestial canopy, riding white clouds by day to ascend the morning.

To the right are twenty-four characters, carved by the Most High upon the eastern wall of the Jade Chamber of Mount Emei. The characters are in ancient script, unintelligible now, but here revealed.

Azure Youth said: To form the Grotto Chamber, the face has three yang lines, two snakes cross lengthwise, the nose is the Heavenly Mountain. Looking upward to the Bright Hall, the Divine Gate is the Purple Portal, then one sees the Grotto Chamber, a square jade disc standing upright, one inch square, quietly preserving the Dipper essence, coming to rest within it, shining to shelter the red child. Without the Three Kings of Excellence, one becomes a flying immortal, riding the mysterious chariot dragon, ascending to the splendid stars, commanding the jade maidens and jade youths—thus the dao is complete, secretly honored and secretly practiced.

Minister Azure Youth of the Purple Canopy and Purple Youth first enacted the Grotto Chamber, resting beneath the splendid stars, reclining within the Nine Essences, restraining soul and spirit upon the Northern Dipper. Hence he is called the Dipper Center True Man. The former master received the Supreme Clarity Purple Essence Lord’s and Primordial Purple Void Lord’s *Grotto Chamber Supreme Scripture*, which Azure Spirit Yang’an Lord transmitted to the Central Yellow Elder Lord, the Three Heavens Great Unity Primordial Lord, who then created the Supreme Profound Lord of the Immortal Mansion, to establish the Golden Script, carve the Jade Characters, naming it the Grotto Chamber Supreme Scripture. The Jade Emperor entrusted it to the Later Sages Li and Peng Lords, to grant to those whose bones and fate merit immortality, to be practiced accordingly, names listed in the Primordial Charts, inscribing birth and death, flight of divine immortals, serving as officials to assist the Later Sages Li and Peng Lords.

Thus, the two lords entrusted the Golden Script Grotto Chamber Scripture to the Western Mysterious Palace’s Grotto Platform and all those True Men who have attained the Way, to transmit to those becoming immortals. They also entrusted the Jade Characters Grotto Chamber Scripture to the Ministerial Officials and the Mysterious Continent Immortal Capital, to teach the destiny of bones and names of those destined to attain the Way. The Later Sages, riding the chariot of the Great Void, roamed the gates of the Ten Heavens and Nine Caverns, awaiting the appointed time of fate to govern as emperor, managing the True Officials on the Divine Platform, teaching the peoples in great peace.

The two lords, having observed the myriad destinies of good and evil, soaring through the mysterious void, knew which Daoist adepts could succeed or fail. If one’s heart is sincere and will focused, truly yearning for the divine truth, persevering year after year without wavering, with spiritual insight into form and bone, already bearing the immortal name in the Jade Register, then the two lords’ intentions align, and thus you receive this scripture. To practice this scripture means your bones and fate are already fixed; the Mysterious Pavilion’s register already holds your immortal name and birth record.

The Later Sages’ two lords always conceal their forms, initially not transmitting themselves, but allowing conditions to bring seekers to them, so that when fate meets, they receive this divine scripture. Some scriptures fall into the hands of the mundane or worldly defiled persons; though they have the scripture, they do not practice it, thus serving only as tools of the yin teachings. Therefore, those whose bones and fate have immortal portions and receive the scripture mostly come through past causes, thus obtaining it here. Sometimes one meets a true immortal who first receives the scripture; when the appointed period ends and the time to transmit arrives, after examining form and bone, they grant it to the disciple. You should diligently contemplate flying immortality, sitting and rising with blessings in your heart, practicing for a long time, and you yourself will obtain this scripture.

Do not say this scripture comes from lowly or base quarters, nor despise its text or slight its transmission. This is the mysterious fate of the Later Sages, the yin already divided, the destined to attain the Way carefully judged, thus given to you. What you now reverently uphold is to fulfill the two lords’ intent, hence the respect even to lowly origins. Just as worldly disciples reverently honor their masters, are masters always all lofty sages? It is only that their roots and hearts are far-reaching. Fast seven days in quiet retreat, then receive this scripture. Cultivate and practice with caution and vigilance, uphold it accordingly, avoiding mingling with defiled, vulgar, or chaotic persons. Practice secretly so as not to be noticed; outwardly conform to the world, inwardly the mirror burns bright. Only then may one speak of the Grotto Chamber’s affairs.

This is the essential secret of the True Mother of Turtle Mountain, decreed to the Western City King Lord. The Twenty-Eight Mansions depend upon the splendid stars, governing the gods of the Four Directions. According to the laws of the Four Extremes and Four True Ones, the Most High Grotto Chamber Golden Script Jade Characters’ trust requires solemn oaths on torn silk, as a pact not to reveal falsely. Those who receive this scripture must offer thirty-two feet of blue brocade silk. The number of the Four Directions is eight each, totaling thirty-two feet. Those who have the scripture receive this silk, further divided with incense and fumigation as per the secret formula. If first received from a true immortal, whose trace is utterly vanished, then the divided incense is the means by which it is bestowed, given as a gift for Daoist use as needed. It must not be given out as miscellaneous offerings.

The Supreme Emperor commands the oath, heavily using golden-blue talismans, called the Oath Blue Silk. The *Nine Plain Scriptures* say: “You receive the golden-blue; the Most High has inscribed your name; be careful not to scatter it, seeking wealth and honor.” This is its meaning. When buying this golden silk, always please the Most High; do not carelessly unravel it to shirk responsibility. The Mysterious also judges your sincerity. These are all the Most High’s writings, each with fixed regulations.

At first, one hears of one transmission per one hundred years, three transmissions within seven hundred years; beyond this, no further issuance. If transmitted to the wrong person or beyond the limit, it is considered a breach and closure. Breach and closure mean that ancestors and descendants below the third official receive examination; upon death, they suffer heavenly punishment and become lower ghosts. The King Lord says: Within one hundred years, two persons may be permitted to receive; also allowed is three transmissions within seven hundred years as an oath.

The Dipper Stars are the purple canopy of the Great Ultimate, the spiritual forest of the Mysterious True, the divine seats of the Nine Emperors, the banquet chamber of the Heavenly Venerable. You who walk this dao, your rank becomes Immortal Ancestor, attaining the flying dragon of eight scenes, ascending to the Supreme Subtle, entering and exiting the Purple Court, feasting and resting in the Northern Dipper, flying and circling the Grotto Pass, looking up and down the Mysterious Canopy, breathing the splendid stars, riding the flowing radiance, to create the Three Profound, entering and exiting the Purple Chamber, roaming the Great Origin, named the Supreme Golden Pavilion, listed among the True Men.

At dusk, before lying down, first preserve the Dipper Star upon your sleeping mat, have its image drawn and placed accordingly, as per the above method. Let your head and crown reach the Nine Extremes, allowing true qi to enter the Mud Ball; feet tread the Venerable and Emperor two stars, always mindfully thinking of flying immortals. Let the Most High restrain your seven souls, the Supreme Subtle govern your three spirits; left hand grasp the Northern Platform, right hand hold the Jade Root. Practice for eighteen years; surely your complexion will return to infantile radiance.

One day suddenly the essence of the Nine Stars appears, transforming into the nine elders of the Emperor, all descending to greet you with mysterious radiant flying dragons, bearing true bells, riding eight chariots of jade, carrying purple feathered canopies, guided by immortal officials. Ahead the phoenix cries, behind the heavenly balance sounds; clad in emerald robes and blue belts, by day ascending the morning, jade youths and jade maidens attend. Thus they hold the banner.

At dusk, often secretly tap teeth three times seven, swallow saliva three times seven, and recite the yin incantation: “Nine Stars’ supreme essence, Northern Pole True Lord, increase my essence and embryo, strengthen my three souls; left draw in the sun’s splendor, right restrain the moon’s ferry; midst the stars the yellow radiance, primordial void and true yellow, make me a flying immortal, ascend the purple smoke, divine tiger jade talisman, always guard the gate of life, vanquish ten thousand evils, receive the refining Dipper Lord.”

At dawn, about to rise, often secretly tap teeth two times seven, swallow saliva two times seven, and recite the yin incantation: “Heaven’s primordial Most High, Dipper’s seven youths, Supreme Clarity Purple Essence, within the destined body, splendid stars purple canopy, Great Element Mysterious Palace, Later Sage’s spiritual qi, descend into the Grotto Chamber, make me a flying immortal, attain the Supreme Ultimate Golden Hall.”

When beginning to preserve the stars externally at dusk, first recite the yin incantation of star names, then preserve the stars only. The incantation says:

1. The first supreme star essence, named Mysterious Pivot, may so-and-so fly as immortal, ride the void chariot to float.

2. The primordial star essence, named Northern Platform, may so-and-so fly as immortal, roam the Grotto Platform.

3. The true star essence, named Nine Extremes Supreme True, may so-and-so fly as immortal, govern the Three Profound.

4. The binding star essence, named Jade Root, may so-and-so bear the jade name, listed among flying immortals.

5. The main star essence, named Heavenly Balance, may so-and-so fly as immortal, ascend Supreme Clarity.

6. The record star essence, named Fate Mechanism, may so-and-so fly as immortal, inscribe the Supreme Subtle.

7. The pass star essence, named Mysterious Yang, may so-and-so fly as immortal, command the jade youths.

8. The emperor star essence, named Most High Jade Emperor, may so-and-so fly as immortal, ascend the Later Sage’s hall.

9. The venerable star essence, named Supreme Subtle Emperor Lord, may so-and-so fly as immortal, enter the cinnabar jade chamber.

Having recited these nine lines in order, then preserve the stars and rest peacefully within the Dipper. Afterwards, again secretly tap teeth and swallow saliva, reciting the incantation of the Nine Stars’ supreme essence and Northern Pole True Lord.

When all preservation and incantations are complete, after a long while, the essence of the Dipper stars suddenly enters the Grotto Chamber, illuminating the whole body, penetrating the five viscera, the three gates, and a hundred joints, all glowing with red radiance. The incantation says: “Grotto Chamber primordial essence, red child Most Venerable, Dipper’s radiant canopy, come shine upon the Mud Ball, protect the refining of bone and blood, restrain the spirit and govern the soul, make so-and-so a flying immortal, ride clouds to ascend morning, pay homage to the Jade Emperor, Great Unity Primordial Lord.” All complete.

The external image of the Dipper stars only divides essence into the Mud Ball; it does not mean leaving one place to go to another. Thus, both the mat and the head have it.

Azure Youth Lord said: Reclining with the yin essence of the Northern Dipper brings immortality and spiritual efficacy; the Grotto Chamber brings the yang essence of the Dipper, causing the five viscera to self-generate, thus enabling riding the radiance and roaming Supreme Clarity. As Azure Youth Lord said, the Northern Dipper has yin and yang two essences. Perhaps this also symbolizes the human’s two essences of soul and spirit. The stars of the Northern Dipper cover the splendid stars, their essence shines through nine paths, their light shelters the Ten Heavens, yang revolves in ninety-nine cycles, hence their exalted status. The world only sees seven stars and not the other two, the eighth and ninth, which are the spirits of the Emperor Sovereign Most Venerable, hidden in the inner mirror, protecting and governing the heavenly soul, their spiritual light blazing. They serve as the guard for the seven stars but do not shine upon worldly fame or vulgar renown. Only those who have attained the Way, high immortals, noble true ones, and officials of Supreme Clarity and Great Clarity may see them. Having seen, one must not speak falsely. After seeing, the Most High Jade Emperor and Supreme Subtle Emperor Lord will come to you, granting you true official status. Mundane people who leap and err may also mistakenly see these two stars; those who see them must be cautious not to speak of it.

The Most High Divine Register says: Those who see the Northern Dipper’s Most High Supreme Subtle star gain three hundred years added to their lifespan; those who see both stars gain six hundred years. But most mundane people are defiled and have not yet caused the two lords to descend. This star is greater than the seven stars, its light all purple splendor, unlike the ordinary, dazzling and awe-inspiring. Those who see it must bow and kneel to pray and entreat. Always on the third and twenty-seventh nights of the month, secretly watch for it, not letting others know. With sincere heart and long practice, none fail to see it. The star has three essences, hence the use of twenty-seven days. The Most High’s method warns: Those who falsely speak the names of essences or reveal sightings will suffer war and fire, and upon death will be judged in hell, offending the Three Officials. In the Qin era, Xu Fu was an ordinary person who also perceived the two stars but dared not speak, thus gaining years. Then he first believed in immortals and knew to study the dao. Han ministers Han Zhong, Sima Jizhu, and Central Peak True Men Meng Zizhuo, Zhang Jujun, and even Yin Gui’s followers also saw them. Han Chancellor Huo Guang had a household servant named Huanche, who knew some letters and once saw a short scroll within a solemn light saying: “Always on the third and twenty-seventh of the month, secretly watch the Northern Dipper; often you will see it; upon seeing, bow and pray, finish entreating, do not spread it; all gain three hundred years added.” Thus Huanche secretly remembered and often observed, seeing not just once but suddenly the two stars atop the Dipper, with extraordinary light. He bowed and returned; Huanche thus gained six hundred years. This servant had some intention but no great ambition, so he did not study the dao, only filling years before death. This tale comes from Lord Wang, who transmitted it to Great Mao Lord.
