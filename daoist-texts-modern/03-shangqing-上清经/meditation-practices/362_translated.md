## Scripture of the Upper Cavern of the Purple Essence Sovereign, Primordial Purple Spirit Dao Sovereign

### The Five Spirit Qi Methods of the Supreme Patriarch of the Great Simplicity and Upper Clarity

Beneath the resting blossoms of the splendid celestial time, reclining within the nine essences, the soul and spirit are bound to ascend northward. The five spirits are refined within the true qi, wandering freely through the eight primordial elements, their names arranged in the profound chart. The Most High Great Sovereign chants:

At the Upper Purple Gate, gazing toward the eight dawns,  
Expanding the Vermilion Palace, fully illuminating the spirit,  
Roaming the nine qi, dancing with the celestial immortals,  
Wearing the azure heavens, chanting the great calendar,  
Wearing the flowing robes, reciting the spiritual plan,  
Summoning the tempest dragons, treading the twin whites,  
Expanding the purple youths, revolving the two reds,  
Concealing the Great Simplicity, hiding the splendid jade disk.

This is the Scripture of the Purple Essence, the Dao of the Five Spirits. The great calendar refers to the record of the seven sages. The spiritual plan refers to the Jade Emperor’s Scripture.

Often, at the time of the parrot’s call, the azure qi of the east is preserved, arriving from midday, filling the head’s mud pellet. Within the mud pellet are two azure smokes, which emerge again from the eyes, dense and flourishing, transforming into two youths, clothed in blue from head to foot, like infants just beginning to walk. The left eye youth is named Flying Spirit; the right eye youth is Morning Infant. Both dwell at my sides, perfectly imitating the form. After a long while, I knock my teeth nine times through, swallow saliva nine times, and softly chant:

Eastern Five Spirits, sun’s qi shining azure,  
At dawn entering the mud pellet, refining the brain’s treasure form,  
Left transforms, right changes, bestowing the name of the Way,  
Enabling me to ascend court, Great Simplicity Purple Clarity.

When finished, deeply recalling the names of the two youths, no harm can touch me. Constantly cultivating this for eighteen years, one ascends to Heaven. Preserve the two youths, allowing them to emerge from the eyes, so that the azure qi suddenly transforms and generates. They dwell at left and right, commanding the two youths each to exhale azure qi, irrigating and encircling my entire body, penetrating inside and out.

At midday, closing the eyes firmly, I preserve the thought that two red qi enter my clenched fists. After a long while, they suddenly transform into red youths, one in each hand, both clothed in red, like infants just beginning to walk. They both dwell at my sides, attending my every move. The left hand youth is the Lord of Fate at Midday, named Receiving Birth. The right hand youth is the Midday Peach Lord, named Square Full. Both exhale red qi, irrigating into my mouth, surging upward to the mud pellet, downward to the whole body, penetrating inside and out like firelight. After a long meditation, I softly chant:

The sun is true and proper, red spirit moves smoke,  
Jade spirit transforms and generates, intimately with me,  
Receiving Birth and Square Full, gods above the sun,  
Governing soul and protecting form, extending life by billions,  
Raising the whole body to harmonize with the light, ascending as high immortals.

When finished, those who constantly perform this and preserve the spirit’s name will sit, stand, and pass beyond.

At feeding time, sitting calmly, closing the eyes, I preserve the thought that within the moon there are two white qi, which directly enter the soles of my feet and tread upon my heart. After a long while, each sole transforms into two white dragons, dwelling at my sides. The left dragon is named Tempest Essence; the right dragon is named Swift Pavilion. Both dragons exhale white smoke, entering my two nostrils, directly reaching the lungs. Within the lungs dwells a youth, clad in white from head to foot, emerging from the right nostril, standing at my right side, named Bright Pure Youth, resembling an infant just beginning to walk. After a long while, I carefully distinguish and perfectly imitate the form, then knock my teeth seven times through, swallow saliva seven times, and softly chant:

Jade Emperor’s Tempest and Swift, two dragons descending at dawn,  
Entering my two feet, transforming and generating my whole body,  
Bright Pure Youth, turning left and right, harmonizing and gathering the six qi,  
Nourishing and nurturing the five spirits, bearing me upward to soar,  
Great Treasure Immortal of the Great Simplicity.

Those who constantly perform this will act swiftly without illness. The left eye youth Flying Spirit, right eye youth Morning Infant, left hand youth Receiving Birth, right hand youth Square Full, lung youth Bright Pure—these are the five spirit names. Always commanding and holding the two dragons Tempest and Swift, exhaling qi to irrigate me. Practice without negligence for eighteen years, then the Great Simplicity dispatches Jade Protector to welcome me, riding the light and driving the dawn, directly to Purple Clarity. Always preserve Bright Pure standing at my right, mouth exhaling white smoke, thick upon my face. Deeply meditate in silence, without distraction. Preserve all thoughts at the eyes, then open them. Always keep the five spirits and two dragons at my sides, irrigating qi without ceasing. On the eight festival days, do not mingle or stray. Do not borrow others’ clothing or headwear, nor use carriages or horses in crowds, so as to concentrate quietly, embrace the response, focus the mind to seek the subtle. Thus one can ride the purple carriage to fan the sky, mount the Tempest and Swift to ascend.

Immortals study the heart; with sincere heart one becomes immortal. The Dao is sought within; with inner secrecy the Dao arrives. The true cultivator refines stillness; penetrating quietude one unites with truth. The spirit must be stirred; accumulating response one becomes numinous and efficacious. Constantly guarding this, the day of departing the immortal path draws near. But if the heart competes with spirit, the body’s harmony is not focused, movement and stillness lose essence, and the ears and eyes are too open, one merely accumulates years seeking the Dao, yet the Dao grows ever more distant.

### [Scripture of the Twenty-Four Spirits Returning to the Origin of the Supreme Emperor of the Great Subtlety]#1

The Supreme Emperor of the Great Subtlety and the Supreme One create form, the Purple Origin inner spirits, twenty-four true ones, mixed qi transforming and generating, jade immortals of the highest essence, dispersing and dissolving cellular knots, releasing stagnation and opening the origin.

---

### [Twenty-Four Knots, Must]#2

The twenty-four spirits command the release of knots, thus one attains liberation. Those who can cultivate and preserve the names govern and pacify the whole body, protecting the primordial essence. To untie the knots, one must first chant the incantation to open the gates. These spirits are the profound ancestors of knot qi, the true spirits of the formed body, guiding clouds and mists, bearing true smoke, each able to summon jade brush dragon riders, thousands in array, all united as one body, ascending at dawn. These are the twenty-four spirits of the Most High Perfected, guarding the origin, the Emperor Sovereign of Upper Clarity riding the Tempest and Swift Dao.

Always settle the body and calm the mind, correct qi and level the form, close the eyes and look inward, forget the body and think of the spirit, burn incense and cleanse, preserve the spirit and guard the truth, imitate the three entries, radiate the profound light. Practice for eighteen years, then the Most High commands the Supreme Emperor of the Great Subtlety and the Five Spirits of the Supreme One to transform and generate the Mixed Spirit Dao Sovereign, summoning the twenty-four perfected ones, a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, galloping wind and treading clouds, breathing flowing ascent, ascending to Heaven by day.

The way of preserving spirit: do not mingle with improper kinds, avoid affairs in deep chambers, rest the essence and tread the void, keep the heart and eyes focused, guard the subtle void, calm the soul and settle the form, then ten thousand harms cannot injure, a hundred ghosts flee, a thousand demons cannot act, disasters disperse and misfortunes vanish, blessings are countless. First knock teeth twenty-four times through, then preserve the thought:

Brain spirit named Awake No-Child, styled Dao Capital, form length one inch one fen, color pure white.

Hair spirit named Mysterious Literary Splendor, styled Dao Balance, form length two inches one fen, color profound.

Skin and flesh spirit named Communal Middle, styled Dao Connection, form length one inch five fen, color yellow.

Eye spirit named Spirit Overseer Life, styled Dao Child, form length three inches, wearing five colors.

Nape marrow spirit named Spirit Counsel Cover, styled Dao Circle, form length five inches, color white.

Backbone spirit named Beneficial History Support, styled Dao Pillar, form length three inches five fen, white jade robe.

Nose spirit named Middle Dragon Jade, styled Dao Subtle, form length two inches five fen, wearing blue-white-yellow robe.

Tongue spirit named Beginning Beam Peak, styled Dao Branch, form length seven inches, bright red.

The right upper body eight scenic spirit youths’ names are next preserved, each like an infant’s form, imitated on the body, each placed in its proper position. When finished, knock teeth eight times through, swallow saliva eight times, and softly chant:

Upper scenic eight spirits, Emperor Sovereign Mysterious Mother, five spirits arrayed, united entering the body, raising form to escape and transform, flowing and changing to truth, a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, all ascending the imperial dawn, pure origin without excellence, Dao nourishes the great guest, eight spirits wing the body, jade splendor holding smoke, faintly circling a thousand times, directly reaching the sun’s gate.

At the beginning of preserving thought, first call the three spirit names thrice, after blessing again call the three spirit names thrice, so that the voice emerges from the mouth, all three parts together. At dawn, midday, and midnight, always preserve the twenty-four spirits, calling and blessing in order, as above.

*The Scripture of the Most High Precious Spirits* says: The method of knocking teeth—left to left is called knocking the Heavenly Bell; right to right is called striking the Heavenly Chime; center up and down knocking together is called sounding the Heavenly Drum. If suddenly encountering ominous evil, one should knock the Heavenly Bell thirty times. If crossing a mountain, warding off evil and invoking mighty spirits, one should strike the Heavenly Chime. If preserving thought and contemplating the Dao, summoning truth and spirits, one should sound the Heavenly Drum. Though knocking teeth is one act, it actually involves left, right, up, and down. Thus evil fears the sound of the Heavenly Bell; mountain spirits dread the resonance of the Heavenly Chime; summoning spirits reveres the vibration of the Heavenly Drum. The tones of palace and commerce have rhythm, subtle inner response, not to be matched casually with a single discordant sound. Thousands of chapters and myriad affairs all follow this; the way of knocking teeth is thus revealed, the sounds of bell and drum distinguished. Therefore, Dao numbers cannot err, nor techniques be confused; error leads to dark defeat, confusion to slander and calamity—not by blind chance, but by practicing blind chance without order. The Dao not accomplished, affairs not verified, is due to seeking truth by wrong paths, not by the traces and tracks of the Way. Knocking the Heavenly Bell twenty times means no other blessing is needed; this must be done to remove misfortune. If there are special instructions, follow the text’s specified number of teeth knocks; thirty is not always required.

Throat spirit named Hundred Flows Release, styled Dao Connection, form length eight inches, wearing nine-colored robe.

Lung spirit named Pure Spirit Life, styled Dao Level, form length eight inches one fen, pure white.

Heart spirit named Radiant Yang Flourish, styled Dao Bright, form length nine inches, color red.

Liver spirit named Opening Lord Youth, styled Dao Blue, form length six inches, color blue.

Gallbladder spirit named Dragon Virtue Restraint, styled Dao Release, form length three inches six fen, color blue-yellow-green.

Left kidney spirit named Spring Origin Straight, styled Dao Noble, form length three inches seven fen, color profound, number changing white-red five colors unsteady.

Right kidney spirit named Elephant Other No, styled Dao Jade, form length three inches five fen, color white or black.

Spleen spirit named Precious Origin Complete, styled Dao Soar, form length seven inches three fen, color pure yellow.

The right middle body eight scenic spirit youths’ names are next preserved, each like an infant’s form, imitated on the body, each placed in its proper position. When finished, knock teeth eight times through, swallow saliva eight times, and softly chant:

Middle scenic eight spirits, four transformations nine flights, refining soul and correcting form, bright scene with shared radiance, gaining union with eight spirits, united chariot of equal might, a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, ascending the Great Subtlety.

Stomach spirit named Together Come Nourish, styled Dao Expand, form length seven inches, color yellow.

Lower intestine spirit named Sign Tower Health, styled Dao Return, form length one inch four fen, yellow-red color.

Large and small intestine spirit named Rush Send Stay, styled Dao Kitchen, form length two inches one fen, color red-yellow.

Torso spirit named Receive Thick Bo, styled Dao Void, form length nine inches one fen, wearing nine-colored robe.

Chest diaphragm spirit named Broad Jade Residence, styled Dao Void, form length five inches, color white.

Two flanks spirit named Ward Off False Horse, styled Dao Accomplish, form length four inches one fen, color red-white.

Left yin and left yang spirit named Support Flow Rise, styled Dao Jade Tablet, form length two inches two fen, color blue-yellow-white. In males preserved as left yang, in females as left yin.

Right yin and right yang spirit named Bundle Manifest Bright, styled Dao Life, form length two inches three fen, color blue-yellow-white. In males preserved as right yang, in females as right yin.

The right lower body eight scenic spirit youths’ names are next preserved, each like an infant’s form, imitated on the body, each placed in its proper position. When finished, knock teeth eight times through, swallow saliva eight times, and softly chant:

Lower scenic eight spirits, dispersing form transforming spirit, purple smoke dense and growing, containing origin guarding essence, Supreme One Primordial Father, Emperor Sovereign upright birth, seven clear registers, governing fate and recording life, soul and spirit settled, five clear nurturing brightness, a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, united with me, first creating Great Simplicity, next saluting Upper Clarity.

The Dao One inner spirit named Chasing No Horse, styled Dao Extreme Life, form length two inches two fen, purple color. In males preserved as Dao One inner spirit, in females as True Origin Central Spirit.

The rightmost deepest root hidden spirit, guarding the center’s highest spirit. Next preserved, like an infant’s form, seated in place. When finished, knock teeth thirty times through, swallow saliva twenty-four times, and softly chant:

Profound upper inner truth, nourishing form attending dawn,  
Gathering and binding the strands, nine degrees eight rotations,  
Dipper stars inner profound, palaces and halls nine arrays,  
Emperor Sovereign united flourishing, nine paths seven swallows,  
Exuding fluids and receiving essence, harmonizing and irrigating all spirits,  
Five viscera generating splendor, reversing old to youthful face,  
A thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, ascending to Heaven,  
Attending the Great Steps, deeply saluting the Jade Dawn.

The rightmost body treasure named Inner Character, the spirit of transformation and generation. Without knowing this name, the immortal Dao cannot be accomplished. If on the day of untying knots one does not first bless this, the knots will not be untied. If knots remain untied, the three souls will lose their place, the upper origin within will be lost, the five elders will lose sight, and the Emperor Sovereign will be estranged. In males preserved as the spirit of youths, in females as the spirit of maidens, both with the same name.

Preserve the twenty-four spirits, always at midnight, lying flat without pillow, sitting calmly, holding firmly and relaxing the body, adjusting qi subtly, preserving thought on the body’s spirits, peacefully thinking of the Emperor Sovereign, commanding imitation to take position, closing eyes and looking inward. If anything is incomplete, then burn incense, sit calmly, close eyes, hold firmly on both knees, preserve essence and all spirits, bless and proceed according to the method. At dawn and midday, preserve spirits from calm sitting and proceed without letting others see. All are inwardly viewed and preserved with closed eyes.

On the first night of the month at midnight, after preserving spirits, again preserve white qi in both eyes, like the size of a chicken’s egg, before the face, soon transforming into two bright mirrors, nine feet in diameter, reflecting the entire body and the twenty-four spirits before and behind, making the inspection clear and distinct. After a long while, mentally bless:

Great Bright Precious Mirror, dispersing form and transforming,  
Illuminating the original spirit, restraining ten thousand demons,  
Flying and ascending Upper Clarity, unveiling cloud veils,  
Commanding a thousand spirits, sealing mountains and summoning rivers.

When finished, perform this every five days, called covering and inspecting the inner essence, gathering and collecting the five spirits. Constant practice prevents disaster and one’s rank ascends to high immortality.

### The Way of the Whisk, Revealing the Methods of the Emperor Sovereign’s Five Spirits and Twenty-Four Spirits:

Always on the ten-day cycle of the Jiazi, on the day of Gengwu, at midday, take one dou of pure water, cast one zhu of true elixir into the water and stir it, turning left thirty-seven times, blessing:

Mysterious Flow Vermilion Essence, generating light entering brightness,  
Body spirit arrayed in multitude, all coming to see form,  
Thoroughly viewing ten thousand li, reaching the nine spirits,  
Emperor Sovereign reflecting youths, enabling me to ascend essence.

When blessing is finished, wash the eyes facing east twenty-seven times. Those who constantly practice this thoroughly see all spirits. Blessings should be whispered softly, washing the eyes facing the moon, always facing east.

### The Supreme Perfected One Summons the Five Stars in the Cavern Chamber, Registers the Flying Immortals in the Six Directions, Secretly Preserves the Hidden Dao, and the Primordial Sovereign of the Southern Pole Receives and Transmits the Jade Scripture Secret Instructions

At midnight in pure stillness, sitting or lying at will, settling body and calming mind, broadening qi and adjusting spirit, closing eyes and looking inward, preserve the Western Great White Star above the eyebrows, named Jade Pendant Purple Gate. One inch above the eyebrows, extending straight one inch, is the Jade Pendant Purple Gate. On yang days preserve the star above the left eyebrow, on yin days above the right eyebrow. Next preserve the Northern Star of the Celestial Mansion’s Profound Palace. The Profound Palace is straight above the nose, reaching five fen to the hairline, extending one inch straight in. Next preserve the Eastern Wood Star at the Cavern Pass Vermilion Terrace. The Vermilion Terrace is one inch behind the eye, extending one inch straight in. On yang days preserve the star behind the left eye, on yin days behind the right eye. Next preserve the Southern Fire Star at the Jade Gate Splendid Chamber. The Jade Gate Chamber is five fen inside the inner corner of both eyes, extending five fen straight in. On yang days preserve the star at the left eye corner, on yin days at the right eye corner. Next preserve the Central Guardian Star at the Golden Cabinet Yellow Chamber Long Valley. The Golden Cabinet Yellow Chamber Long Valley is in the center of the philtrum, extending straight in two fen, the star appearing as if suspended above. After preserving all, imitate and place the stars in their positions, one should feel the five stars emitting light rays, releasing five-colored smoke, penetrating my whole body, illuminating inside and out, the body feeling as if suffused with fragrant star essence entering. Then knock teeth twenty-five times through, swallow saliva twenty-five times, and softly chant:

High Origin Purple Gate, inwardly seeing the Emperor Sovereigns,  
Supreme One mixed and combined, gate of the Purple Chamber,  
Within the gate shining brightly, these are the Three Origins,  
Three Origins binding essence, within are five spirits,  
Precious radiance spreading brilliance, releasing light surging through the gate,  
Essence transforms and accumulates, becoming an elder,  
Head wrapped in white cloth, green cape and crimson skirt,  
Right side wearing flowing bells, left side wearing tiger patterns,  
Hands holding heavenly strands, scattering sharp flying stars,  
Feet treading splendid canopy, exhaling rays refining the body,  
Three scenes guarding and preserving, enabling me to attain truth,  
Nourishing soul and controlling spirit, riding the tempest flying immortals.

When finished, swallow saliva three times, knock teeth three times. Those who constantly practice this for fifteen years will be met by the Southern Pole Elder True One of the Elixir Tomb, welcomed riding the green cloud; the Western Pole Elder Pure Spirit Son Qi, welcomed riding the yellow tempest chariot; the Northern Pole Elder Profound Upper Immortal Sovereign, welcomed riding the dark radiance dragon; the Eastern Pole Elder Supporting Yang Son, welcomed riding the blue carriage; the Central Origin Elder Central Upper Profound Son, welcomed riding the curved dawn canopy. The five elders united, all ascend to Purple Void. Practice without interruption, preserve without laxity. Avoid treading filth, forbid mingling places, always burn incense, bathe frequently. Those who violate this decline and fail; those who follow it fly as immortals. After preserving the stars, if one wishes to make a vow, continue speaking after the blessing.

Preserve the five stars’ common chamber resting place, extending straight down three inches below the nape, still clearing one inch square. The stars are like pellets, clearly visible on one cavern face. On new moon, full moon, seventh day, ninth day, thirteenth day, seventeenth day, twentieth day, twenty-fifth day, at cockcrow, preserve the sun and moon images in the soul chamber of the six directions’ mansion. The six directions mansion is above the outer corners of both eyes, slightly raised in the high void. Pressing there and knocking teeth, one hears four meetings below; what moves beneath is this. Extending straight in one inch square nine fen, named the soul chamber six directions mansion. Sun on left, moon on right, preserve to make brightness penetrate the form, commanding imitation to take position, close eyes and deeply meditate, no escape allowed. When finished, knock teeth six times through, swallow saliva nine times, and softly chant:

Great Bright Spirit Dawn, nine degrees dense blue,  
Summoning rosy clouds hiding brilliance,  
Irrigating and refining the five forms,  
Palace driving the six directions, seven spirits harmonizing,  
Enabling me to fly as immortal, ascending and journeying Upper Clarity.

When finished, practice for fifteen years, the Jade Emperor dispatches three pure jade youths to welcome. One must nurture the crowing rooster, assigning it to govern dawn with constant rhythm. If one conceals this chapter and acts otherwise, one will surely lose the sun and moon’s combined brilliance. The Southern Pole Lady receives this guarding the Most High Supreme True, named Twin Scenes Winged Form Hidden Dao.

The first star of the Dipper is the Supreme Star, essence named Mysterious Pivot, spirit called Yang Bright. The second primal star, essence named Northern Terrace, spirit called Yin Essence. The third true star, essence named Nine Extremes, spirit called Perfected Person. The fourth knot star, essence named Rotating Root, spirit called Profound Darkness.

These are the Dipper Sovereign names, called the Nine Stars.

The Dipper has soul and spirit stars, revolving outside the Dipper, entwined about it; the Dipper is within soul and spirit. Its strands are outside, unlike the Dipper itself, for soul and spirit wander and transform without form. The child-step Dipper soul, preserving the heart, calls the seven souls by name, called Flying Immortal, treading a black star, calling each soul’s name. Without knowing these names, techniques do not work, the Dao is not accomplished. Its star lies between Yang Bright and Yin Essence, the chief star of Dipper soul and spirit, named Heavenly Pivot Soul Spirit. Next, at the upper corner, the second star named Heavenly Rotation Soul Spirit. Next, following Yang Bright, the third star named Heavenly Mechanism Spirit Essence. Next, opposite Perfected Person, the fourth star named Heavenly Authority Spirit Essence. Next, opposite Cinnabar Origin, the fifth star named Jade Balance Soul Spirit.

### The Supreme Hidden Dao of Returning to the Origin for Removing the Register of Sins, Inner Chapter

The Most High Jade True Hidden Origin Inner Observation, using the Six Ding days, the time of vital qi, the heavenly origin unfolds, cellular knots heavy and firm, seven spirits report, three souls record faults, seven ancestors’ transgressions, accumulated punishments of the three yin, thus there is a method of removal to liberate faults and sins. Those who practice this Dao are called seekers of immortality.

Always on the ten-day cycle of Jiazi, on the day of Dingmao, at midnight, sitting calmly on the bed facing north, holding hands, knocking teeth seven times through, then looking upward preserving the seven stars, making brightness shine in the north. After a long while, softly chant: “First Supreme Star Mysterious Pivot Yang Bright Heavenly Pivot Soul Spirit Supreme Sovereign.” Call it seven times, then again bless: “May all sins and faults from the seventh generation ancestor down to this body’s yang sins and yang faults be removed, all wishes fulfilled, ten thousand affairs harmonized, flying steps of the seven primals, leaning with Heaven, names inscribed in the Dipper Dawn, extending life by billions.” When finished, preserve the Yang Bright star flying from the Dipper, entering my mouth, directly into the heart. Preserve the star’s light, making inside and outside transparent, deeply meditate. This is called untying the morning knot net, reflecting the upper Dao.

One should preserve the seven stars, missing one with the remaining six, thus suspended in Heaven. The missing one will come, suddenly entering my mouth; thus the other six remain in Heaven. All matters follow this method.

On the ten-day cycle of Jiaxu, on the day of Dingchou, at midnight, sitting calmly on the bed facing north, holding hands, knocking teeth seven times through, then looking upward preserving the seven stars, making brightness shine in the north. After a long while, softly chant: “Second primal star Northern Terrace Yin Essence Heavenly Rotation Soul Spirit Supreme Jade Sovereign.” Call it seven times, then bless: “May all sins and faults from the seventh generation ancestor down to this body’s yin sins and yin faults be removed, six qi filled full, four spirits used in emptiness, flying through the seven primals, names inscribed in the Jade Scripture, ascending Purple Clarity, riding the dark chariot without obstruction, entering and exiting with benefit and virtue, harmonizing with Heaven.” When finished, preserve the Yin Essence star flying from the Dipper, entering my mouth, directly into the lungs, enabling inspection inside and out, five viscera distinct. When the star enters the mouth, one should feel the light scattering warmly throughout the mouth, like a small heat—this is proof of star essence entering.

The seven primals’ method for preserving the nine dawns requires that the bed and seat be exclusive, not shared with others. Clothing likewise. If men and women share bed and rest, they are listed in the register of sins of the Northern Profound. Those who violate filth bring disaster upon the three ancestors’ tests. Masters and those of the same qi do not violate this.

On the ten-day cycle of Jiashen, on the day of Dinghai, at midnight, sitting calmly on the bed facing north, holding hands, knocking teeth seven times through, then looking upward preserving the seven stars, making brightness shine in the north. After a long while, yin blessing: “Third true star Nine Extremes Supreme True Supreme Origin Perfected Person Heavenly Mechanism Spirit Essence Supreme Pure Sovereign.” Call it seven times, then bless: “May all sins and faults from the seventh generation ancestor down to this body’s death sins and death faults, accumulated evil and secret offenses, violating Heaven, Earth, Water, and the Three Officials, be eliminated, eyes clear and penetrating, inspection thorough and profound, flying through the seven primals, names inscribed in Upper Clarity, commanding myriad spirits, ascending Jade Court, riding light and mounting void, harmonizing with Heaven.” When finished, preserve the Perfected Person star flying from the Dipper, entering my mouth, directly into the liver, illuminating the five viscera, inside and out clear. Then bow twice facing north; after bowing, swallow saliva nine times; one may also heartfully bow to the true star.

On the ten-day cycle of Jiawu, on the day of Dingyou, at midnight, sitting calmly in the bedchamber facing north, holding hands, knocking teeth seven times, then looking upward preserving the seven stars, making brightness shine in the north. After a long while, softly chant: “Fourth knot star Rotating Root Profound Darkness Heavenly Authority Spirit Essence Supreme Void Sovereign.” Call it seven times, then bless: “May all sins and faults from the seventh generation ancestor down to this body’s ungratefulness and lack of virtue, unkindness and unfiliality, yin evil sins, numbering in the millions, be eliminated, taking food and receiving essence, daily increasing, flying to the seven primals, names inscribed in the Great Mystery, ascending Jade Emperor, riding the swift nine heavens, commanding spirits and guiding souls, sun and moon renewed together.” When finished, preserve the Profound Darkness star flying from the Dipper, entering my mouth, directly into the spleen, making light clear and penetrating, illuminating the five viscera. Then swallow saliva twenty-seven times.

On the ten-day cycle of Jiayin, on the day of Dingwei, at midnight, sitting calmly in the bedchamber facing north, holding hands, knocking teeth seven times through, then looking upward preserving the seven stars, making brightness shine in the north. After a long while, softly chant: “Fifth strand star Heavenly Balance Cinnabar Origin Jade Balance Soul Spirit Supreme Sovereign Supreme Profound Nine Emperor Sovereign.” Call it seven times, then bless: “May all sins and faults from the seventh generation ancestor down to this body’s internal and external filth sins, wrapped and hidden faults numbering in the millions and billions, recorded in the dark pass, be eliminated, body filled and qi full, Yellow Court guarding the center, ascending Great Simplicity, riding light Purple Palace, right attended by jade maidens, left attended by jade youths, sun and moon shining together, position as true king.” When finished, preserve the Cinnabar Origin star flying from the Dipper, entering my mouth, directly into the stomach, making light clear and bright, five viscera distinct. Then swallow saliva twenty-nine times.

On the ten-day cycle of Jiayin, on the day of Dingsi, at midnight, sitting calmly in the bedchamber facing north, holding hands, knocking teeth seven times, then looking upward preserving the seven stars, making brightness shine in the north. After a long while, softly chant: “Sixth record star Life Mechanism Northern Pole Open Yang Soul Spirit Supreme True Cinnabar Emperor Void Sovereign.” Call it seven times, then bless: “May all sins and faults from the seventh generation ancestor down to this body’s committed and carried out evil sins and faults, treacheries, rebellions, and delusions, recorded in the imperial palace, be eliminated, a hundred diseases healed, body and qi benefiting virtue, names inscribed on the immortal platform, carved in gold Upper Clarity, commanding myriad spirits, flying through nine brightness.” When finished, preserve the Northern Pole star flying from the Dipper, entering my mouth, directly into the kidneys, making light clear and penetrating, five viscera distinct. Then swallow saliva twenty-seven times. On yang days it is preserved in the left kidney, on yin days in the right kidney. One day yang, two days yin. This Dao especially forbids sexual intercourse. Sexual intercourse causes the Most High’s test and three generations of ancestors and parents to be offended; death leads to becoming a lower ghost.

On the last night of the month, the next day being the new moon, before cockcrow, sitting calmly on the bedchamber facing east, holding hands, knocking teeth seven times, then looking upward preserving the seven stars, making brightness shine on my left face. After a long while, softly chant: “Seventh pass star Mysterious Yang Heavenly Pass Shaking Light Great Bright Most High Jade Emperor Dao Sovereign.” Call it seven times, then bless: “May all sins and faults from the seventh generation ancestor down to this body’s hidden and obscure sins, violating the five punishments, spirits numbering in the millions and billions, recorded by the Northern Emperor Ghost Official, be eliminated, making certain spirit essence reach eight directions, sitting, standing, and passing beyond, ears hearing no sound, eyes producing purple light, inscribing jade Great Simplicity, thoroughly inspecting ghost forms, names recorded in the imperial pavilion, fate balanced by two brightness, flying through seven primals, resting in the purple court.” When finished, preserve the Heavenly Pass star flying from the Dipper, entering my mouth, then into the pupils, illuminating both eyes, making inside and outside self-illuminating, preserving vision of five viscera, making them distinct. On yang days the star enters the left eye, on yin days the right pupil. When acting and preserving thought, always close and gaze with both eyes.

On the day of the Six Jia, at midnight, the time of vital qi, lying or sitting on the bed with head as desired, holding firmly and calming breath and spirit, after a long while, knocking teeth nine times through, preserve the nine stars of the Northern Dipper, making brightness shine at the crown. Two stars at the front of the Dipper handle, their light shining and reflecting each other. Then softly chant: “Eighth emperor star Most High Jade Emperor Spirit Eight Scenic Primordial Sovereign, Ninth revered star Great Subtle Jade Emperor Spirit Great Simplicity Seven Dawn Primordial Sovereign.” Call them nine times, then bless: “May all sins and faults from the ninth generation ancestors and grandparents down to this body’s various hills, mountains, waters, and sources, large and small sins, recorded in the death register, hidden and secret evil, treacheries, and deceptions, numbering in the billions, recorded on Feng Mountain by the Ghost Emperor, death sins and regulations, recorded in the Northern ascent nine primal Supreme Ultimate perfected black register, beseeching the nine primal Most High Emperor Jade Profound Sovereign, all matters be eliminated, flying through the seven paths, ascending Jade Clarity, roaming the Great Void, riding the light of dawn, feasting in the eight primordial, leaning with the sun, always attending the true consort, commanding myriad spirits.” When finished, preserve the eighth emperor star and ninth revered star flying from the Dipper, entering my mud pellet palace purple chamber, illuminating the mud pellet and clearly connecting the whole body and five viscera, making inside and outside generate purple light and clouds, extremely dense. Imitate and meditate on this. When finished, swallow saliva thirty-nine times.

If the day of Six Jia and Six Ding conflict in preservation, redo in order, each matter following this method, only to be complete in true method. Thus the Supreme Way of Returning to the Origin and Repaying Sins is complete.

### The Supreme Way of the Five Passes, Sealed in the Jade Chest of the Five Sacred Mountains, Hidden Returning to the Origin Dao in the Palace of the Nine Dawns

Having cultivated the Five Passes, one then practices Returning to the Origin. The Five Passes open at the beginning; Returning to the Origin closes at the end. Therefore, those who cultivate the Five Passes first fast for three days, then practice on that day. Those who cultivate the Seven Primal Returning Dao do not eat blood or fish on the days before and after fasting. The reason for not fasting is that the Five Passes have already been fasted before. The Five Passes are the auspicious meeting days of the Most High; Returning to the Origin is the renewal day of the Most High. Without knowing the Five Passes, one cannot remove sins and faults; without knowing the Returning to the Origin Hidden Dao, one cannot carve the tablet of the Supreme True. Always on those days, preserve auspicious matters, first thanking the body’s sins and faults, called liberation of form and name. This is not shown to immortals within the nine palaces. Those cultivating the Upper and Purple Chambers, and preserving the Nine Primal and Seven Primal, upon first waking, lying down, and after meals, first softly chant:

Five stars five passes, six directions purple chamber,  
Returning to the origin hidden Dao, opening the seven dawns,  
Generating souls the mysterious father, father transforms to form spirit,  
Generating spirits the mysterious mother, mother transforms to give birth to body,  
Governing my sinews and bones the young lord, nourishing my essence and qi the white origin,  
Long life and enduring vision, flying immortal ten heavens.

When finished, do not let ears hear the blessing’s sound. This is the Most High hidden blessing to remove evil qi, bring forth spirit, so that one never tires of darkness in life.
