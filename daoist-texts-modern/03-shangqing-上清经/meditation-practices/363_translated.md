## The Jade Scripture and Precious Instructions of the Supreme Clarity Purple Tenuity Emperor, Southern Pole Primordial Lord

The Supreme Subtle Emperor, the Great One who shapes forms, the Purple Origin Inner Spirit, and the Twenty-Four Perfected Ones—born of mingled qi and transformation—are the lords of transcendent essence above immortals. They dissolve the knots of the embryo, release stagnation, and open the primal source.

The twenty-four nodal knots require the command of the twenty-four spirits to be removed and freed. Those who can cultivate and preserve the names will govern and pacify their entire body, guarding the primordial essence. On the day one wishes to untie these knots, one must first offer prayers; only then can the gates be opened. The Purple Numinous is the profound ancestor of the binding qi, the true spirit forming the body, guiding and directing clouds and mist, bearing living true smoke. Each can summon the jade chariot and dragon steeds, countless in array, all moving as one body, ascending at dawn’s first light. These are the twenty-four spirits of the Most High Perfected One, guarding the primordial lord, ascending the jade clarity chariot on the path of the whirlwind.

One must always secure the body and quiet the mind, straighten the vital qi and smooth the form, close the eyes and look inward, forget the body and contemplate the spirit. Burn incense, wash and rinse, preserve the spirit and guard the true. Imitate the threefold entering of the misty radiance, serene and profound. Practicing thus for eighteen years, the Most High commands the Supreme Subtle Emperor, the Great One of Five Spirits, to transform and birth the Mixed Spirit Dao Lord, who summons the twenty-four perfected ones, a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, treading the wind and clouds, breathing flowing rosy clouds, creating Heaven in broad daylight.

The way of preserving the spirit forbids any mingling with the wrong kind. In deep chambers avoid worldly affairs, rest the essence and gather the spirits. Keep the heart mindful and eyes imagining, subtly guarding the void. When the soul is tranquil and the form at peace, ten thousand harms cannot injure, a hundred ghosts flee in terror, a thousand demons cannot act, disasters vanish and calamities scatter—wondrous beyond measure. First knock the teeth twenty-four times through, then preserve the thoughts.

The High Supreme Precious Scripture of Divine Illumination says: The method of knocking the teeth—left to left is called Breaking and Controlling the Heavenly Bell; right to right is called Shaking the Heavenly Mallet and Heavenly Chime; center top and bottom knocking together is called the Resounding Heavenly Drum. If one suddenly encounters misfortune and ill omens, break the Heavenly Bell for ten strikes. If passing a mountain, ward off evil with the mighty spell of the Heavenly Mallet and Chime. To preserve thought and call forth spirits, sound the Heavenly Drum. Though knocking the teeth seems one act, it truly has left, right, top, and bottom aspects. Thus, evil fears the sound of the Heavenly Bell; mountain spirits are subdued by the Heavenly Chime’s resonance; spirits are summoned and solemnized by the Heavenly Drum’s vibration. The profound commerce has rhythm, subtle inner response; it cannot be sought by mere stabbing or happen by chance as in antiquity. Thousands and tens of thousands of chapters all follow thus—the way of knocking the teeth unfolds, the sounds of bell and drum differ. Therefore, the Dao’s numbers must not err, nor the methods be confused. Errors bring ruin in darkness; confusion invites slander and destruction—not from mysterious disconnection, but from disorderly practice without sequence. The Dao fails, affairs do not verify, because seekers of truth lack the method, treading the edge of the track, creating many faults.

Breaking the Heavenly Bell thirty times means no other prayers are needed; one walks this alone to remove misfortune. If following the text’s prescriptions, knocking the teeth the prescribed number suffices; no need to break thirty times.

The brain spirit is named Awakening Primordial Son, styled Dao Capital. Its form is one inch and one fen long, color pure white.

The hair spirit is named Mysterious Literary Splendor, styled Dao Balance. Its form is two inches and three fen long, color profound black.

The skin spirit is named Universal Communicator, styled Dao Connection. Its form is one inch and five fen long, color yellow.

The nose spirit is named Middle Dragon Jade, styled Dao Subtle. Its form is two inches and five fen long, wearing garments of blue, yellow, and white.

The tongue spirit is named Original Ridge Peak, styled Dao Branch. Its form is seven inches long, clad in red robes.

On the right side of the body’s upper section are stored the eight scenic spirit youths’ names. First preserve them, each in the form of an infant, imitating the body, each placed in its proper position. Then knock the teeth eight times, swallow saliva eight times, and softly pray:

“O Eight Spirits of the Upper Scenery, unite and enter the body. Emperor Lord, Mysterious Mother, the Five Spirits arrayed, shapes raised and transformed, flowing and changing to truth. A thousand chariots and ten thousand riders all ascend the imperial dawn. White origin without brilliance, guiding and nourishing the great guest. Eight spirits wing the body, jade blossoms hold the smoke, faintly circling ten rounds, directly reaching the Sun Gate.”

At the beginning of preserving thought, first call the three spirit names aloud, after prayer, again call the three spirit names, so that voice just emerges, all three parts united. At dawn, noon, and midnight, constantly preserve the twenty-four spirits, reciting them in order, prayers and calls as above.

The throat spirit is named Hundred Flow Release, styled Dao Communication. Its form is eight inches and nine fen long, color red.

The lung spirit is named Pure Spirit Birth, styled Dao Peace. Its form is eight inches and one fen long, pure white.

The gallbladder spirit is named Dragon Virtue Restraint, styled Dao Release. Its form is three inches and six fen long, blue, yellow, and green.

The spleen spirit is named Precious Origin Complete, styled Dao Soar. Its form is seven inches and three fen long, yellow.

The left kidney spirit is named Spring Origin Upright, styled Dao Noble. Its form is three inches and seven fen long, color profound black, changing to white and red, five colors without constancy.

The right kidney spirit is named Elephant Other No, styled Dao Jade. Its form is three inches long, color white or black.

On the right side of the body’s middle section are stored the eight scenic spirit youths’ names. Next preserve them, each like an infant, imitating the body, each placed in its proper position. Then knock the teeth eight times, swallow saliva eight times, and softly pray:

“O Eight Spirits of the Middle Scenery, four transformations and nine flights, refining the soul to protect the body, bright scenery shining alike. Emperor Lord unties knots, fetal bonds return in four directions, upper connects to Mysterious Mother, dispersing spirits and issuing power. Joined with the eight spirits, together riding the chariot flying in unison, a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders ascend the Supreme Subtle.”

The stomach spirit is named Together Coming Nourishment, styled Dao Spread. Its form is seven inches long, color yellow.

The lower intestine spirit is named Prosperous Rising Health, styled Dao Return. Its form is two inches and four fen long, yellow-red.

The large and small intestines spirit is named Abundant Sending and Staying, styled Dao Kitchen. Its form is two inches and one fen long, color red-yellow.

The torso spirit is named Receiving Thick Bo, styled Dao Void. Its form is nine inches and one fen long, wearing nine-colored garments.

The chest diaphragm spirit is named Broad Jade Residence, styled Dao Void. Its form is five inches long, color white.

The two flanks spirit is named Expelling False Horse, styled Dao Accomplish. Its form is four inches and one fen long, color red-white.

The left yin and left yang spirits are named Supporting Flow Rise, styled Dao Jade. Its form is two inches and three fen long, color blue, yellow, and white. In men, preserve as left yang; in women, preserve as left yin.

The right yin and right yang spirits are named Enveloping Manifest Bright, styled Dao Life. Its form is two inches and three fen long, color blue, yellow, and white. In men, preserve as right yang; in women, preserve as right yin.

On the right side of the body’s lower section are stored the eight scenic spirit youths’ names. Lastly preserve them, each in infant form, imitating the body, each placed in its proper position. Then knock the teeth eight times, swallow saliva eight times, and softly pray:

“O Eight Spirits of the Lower Scenery, dispersing form and transforming spirit, purple smoke thickly arising, containing origin and guarding essence. Great One of the Primordial Unity, Emperor Lord standing forth, seven blossoms shining bright, governing fate and recording spirits. Soul and spirit at peace, five blossoms nurturing brightness, a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders join with me, first creating the Great Element, then saluting Supreme Clarity.”

The Dao One Inner Spirit is named Vanishing No Horse, styled Dao Extreme Birth. Its form is two inches and two fen long, purple in color. For men, preserved as Dao One Inner Spirit; for women, preserved as True Origin Central Spirit.

On the right side of the body is the most hidden spirit of the extreme root, guarding the center’s upper spirit. Next preserve it, like an infant, seated in its place. Then knock the teeth thirty times, swallow saliva twenty-four times, and softly pray:

“Mysterious Upper Inner Truth, nourishing the form and attending the dawn, gathering and binding the threads, nine degrees and eight rotations, outer stars arrayed, inner halls nine arranged. Emperor Lord united and flourishing, nine paths and seven throats, releasing fluids within essence, harmonizing and watering all spirits. The five organs produce blossoms, reversing old age to youthful visage, a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders ascend with me to Heaven, paying homage at the Supreme Terrace, deeply bowing before the Jade Dawn.”

On the right side of the body is the treasured name of the inner character, the spirit of transformation and birth. Without knowing this name, the immortal dao cannot be accomplished. On the day of untying knots, if one does not first pray to this, the knots will not be undone. If knots remain unloosed, the three souls lose their way, the upper origin is lost within, the five elders lose their sight, and the Emperor Lord turns away in estrangement. For men, preserved as the male child spirit; for women, preserved as the female child spirit—both share the same name.

Preserving the twenty-four spirits, always at midnight remove the pillow and lie flat, grasp firmly and relax the body, adjust the breath subtly, think of the entire body spirit, calmly contemplate the Emperor Lord, causing the imitation to dwell in place. Close the eyes and look inward. If any are absent, immediately burn incense, sit upright with eyes closed, grasp firmly on both knees, essence preserved, all prayers performed according to method. At dawn and noon, preserve the spirits similarly, never allowing anyone to see; all is inward observation and closed contemplation.

On the first day of the month at midnight, after preserving the spirits, again preserve the white vapor in the eyes, like a chicken’s egg in size, before the face. Soon it transforms into two bright mirrors, each nine inches in diameter, reflecting front and back my entire body and the twenty-four spirits, making the inspection clear and distinct. After a while, silently pray:

“Great Bright Precious Mirror, dispersing form and transforming, illuminating the primordial spirit, restraining ten thousand demons, flying to Supreme Clarity, unveiling cloud veils and nets, commanding ten thousand spirits, sealing mountains and summoning rivers.”

Complete. Practice this every five days. This is called enveloping and clasping the inner essence, inspecting and gathering the five spirits. Those who can always perform this will avoid disasters and ascend to high immortality.

The way of the whisk bearer makes one thoroughly see the Emperor Lord’s five spirits and the twenty-four spirits’ methods. Always on the tenth day of the sexagenary cycle, on the day of Gengwu, at midday, take one sheng of pure water, add one zhu of true elixir, stir it in the water, circle left three times and seven passes, praying:

“Mysterious Flowing Vermilion Ferry, generating light of eight brightnesses, the body’s spirits arrayed, all come to see the form, thoroughly viewing ten thousand li, reaching the nine spirits. Emperor Lord reflects the youth, commanding me to ascend essence.”

After prayer, face east and wash the eyes twice, seven passes each. Those who constantly practice thus will thoroughly see myriad spirits. The prayer should be softly spoken, washing with water facing the moon’s position.

## The Most High Perfected One’s Inner Record of Summoning the Five Celestial Bodies’ Flying Souls in the Cavern Chamber, the Six Harmonies Hidden Preservation Precious Instructions

The Most High Perfected One summons the Five Celestial Bodies in the cavern chamber, registers flying souls in the secret path of the Six Harmonies, the Jade Scripture and Precious Instructions of the Southern Pole Primordial Lord.

At midnight in pure stillness, sitting or lying at ease, body settled and mind clear, breathing wide and calming the spirit, eyes facing inward, preserve the Western Great White Star on the face above the two eyebrows, named Jade Pendant Purple Gateway. One inch above the eyebrow, straight in one inch, is the Jade Pendant Purple Gateway. The yang-day star is preserved on the left eyebrow, the yin-day star on the right eyebrow. Next preserve the Northern Celestial Star in the imperial village of the Mysterious Palace. The imperial village of the Mysterious Palace lies straight above the nose, reaching five fen into the hairline, straight in one inch. Next preserve the Eastern Wood Star at the Cave Pass Vermilion Terrace. The Cave Pass Vermilion Terrace lies one inch behind the eye, straight in one inch; the yang-day star on the left eye’s rear, the yin-day star on the right eye’s rear. Next preserve the Southern Mars Star at the Jade Gate Splendid Chamber. The Jade Gate Splendid Chamber lies five fen inside the inner corner of both eyes, straight in five fen; the yang-day star on the left eye’s corner, the yin-day star on the right eye’s corner. Next preserve the Central Guardian Star in the Golden Cabinet Yellow Chamber Long Valley. The Golden Cabinet Yellow Chamber Long Valley lies at the center of the philtrum, straight in two fen, the star like a suspended jewel above. After preserving and meditating, cause the stars to take their places, one should feel the five stars emitting radiant beams, releasing five-colored smoke, penetrating the entire body, inside and out, as if black star essences enter the form. Then knock the teeth five times, swallow saliva twenty-five times, and softly pray:

“High Supreme Purple Gateway, inwardly seeing the Emperor Lord, the Great One of Primordial Unity mingled, the gate of the Purple Chamber, within the gate shines brightly, these are the Three Origins. The Three Origins bind essence, thus there are five spirits, precious radiance spreading brilliance, casting light to guard the dawn. Essence transforms and accumulates life, becoming the old man, first donning the white crown, green cape and crimson skirt, right belt jingling bells, left wearing tiger’s armor, hands grasp the heavenly staff, scattering sharp flying stars, feet treading splendid canopy, exhaling rays refining the body, the three scenes protect and guard, granting me truth, nourishing the soul and controlling the spirit, riding the whirlwind to fly as immortal.”

Complete. Then swallow saliva three times, knock teeth three times. Those who can constantly practice this way for fifteen years will be greeted by the Southern Pole Elder True Man of the Elixir Mound, riding a carriage of green clouds; the Western Pole Elder Su Cloud Master, riding a chariot of yellow whirlwind; the Northern Pole Elder Mysterious Supreme Immortal Sovereign, riding a dragon of mysterious radiance; the Eastern Pole Elder Supporting Yang Lord, riding a blue palanquin; the Central Origin Elder Central Supreme Child, riding a curved morning canopy. The Five Elders united all ascend the Purple Void. Practice without neglect, preserve without laxity. Avoid treading filth, forbid mingling places, always burn incense, bathe often. Those who violate this decay; those who follow it fly as immortals. After preserving the stars, if one wishes to make a wish, after intention and prayer, continue speaking.

Preserve the place where the five stars dwell together, straight in two inches below the nape, also clearing one inch square around. The stars are like pellets, shining upon the cavern face and body. On the new moon, full moon, the seventh, ninth, thirteenth, seventeenth, twentieth, and twenty-fifth days of the month, at cockcrow, preserve the sun and moon images in the soul chamber of the Six Harmonies. The soul chamber of the Six Harmonies lies above the outer corners of both eyes, slightly raised in the high empty space. Pressing it and knocking the teeth, one hears four meetings below; the moving one beneath is that. Straight in one inch, square nine fen, named the mansion of the soul chamber of the Six Harmonies. Sun on the left, moon on the right, preserve and cause the light to illuminate the cavern form, cause the imitation to dwell in place, open the eyes and focus intensely, no escape allowed. Then knock the teeth seven times, and softly pray:

“Great Bright Spirit Dawn, nine degrees lush blue, summoning rosy clouds hiding radiance, pouring and refining the five forms, palace carriage of the Six Harmonies, seven spirits harmonized and balanced, enabling me to fly as immortal, soul ascending Supreme Clarity.”

Complete. Practice for fifteen years, the Jade Emperor sends three white palanquins to welcome. One must nurture the ability to crow like a rooster, so that it governs dawn and maintains regular timing. If acting in secret, one will surely lose the sun and moon’s mutual radiance. The Southern Pole Lady received this technique from the Most High Supreme True One, named Twin Scenery Winged Form Hidden Preservation Secret Path—only those of immortal bones may hear this scripture’s eye.

Facing east, the Supreme Clarity Mysterious Origin Lords of the Three Heavens of Limitless Great Dao. Facing west, the Celestial Master, Female Master, Successor Master, and Lineage Master—the Three Masters. Facing north, the Most High Lord Lao, Supreme Mysterious First Lord, Most High Elder. Facing south, the Dao Virtue Lord, Dao Virtue Elder, Ten Thousand Blessings Lord, Ten Thousand Blessings Elder, Ten Thousand Life Lord, Ten Thousand Life Elder.
