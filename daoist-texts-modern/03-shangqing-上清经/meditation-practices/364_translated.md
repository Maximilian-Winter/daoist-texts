## Scripture of the Twenty-Four Spirits of the Taiwei Emperor’s Return to the Origin

The Taiwei Emperor, the Taiyi who shapes form, the Purple Primordial Inner Spirit, commands the twenty-four perfected beings. From the mingling breath they transform and give birth, presiding over the immortal’s supreme essence. They dissolve and scatter the fetal knots, releasing the blocked root of origin.

By the command of these twenty-four spirits, one attains liberation and release. Those who can cultivate and preserve their names govern and stabilize the body, guarding the primal essence. To unravel the method of knot-release, one must first invoke them; only then can the gates be opened. These numinous ones are the profound ancestors of knot-bound qi, the true spirits of the formed body. They move the dao like clouds and mist, bearing the breath of life’s marsh, capable of summoning jade carriages and dragon steeds, tens of thousands arrayed in procession, all united as one body, ascending to Heaven by day. This is the way of the Taiwei Emperor, the Tai Shang Perfected of the Twenty-Four Spirits, who dwell in the mysterious origin of the Emperor Lord of the Supreme Clarity, riding the whirlwind.

One must always settle the body and quiet the heart, walk the path with upright qi, close the eyes and look inward, forget the body and mind, burn incense and wash the spirit, preserve the numinous and guard the true. Imitate the threefold entrance of the misty radiance, the mysterious essence of the azure brightness. Practice this for eighteen years, and the Most High commands the Taiwei Emperor, the Taiyi Five Spirits, to transform and give birth to the Primordial Spirit Dao Lord. From the twenty-four perfected beings, a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders rush forth, riding the wind and gathering clouds, breathing and flowing upward, ascending to Heaven by day.

The way of preserving the spirit forbids mingling with improper types. Seclude yourself in deep chambers and avoid affairs. Grasp the essence and tread the void. Keep the heart with mindful vision, subtle and mysterious guarding the void. Calm the soul and settle the form, then myriad harms cannot injure you, a hundred ghosts flee in terror, a thousand demons cannot approach. Disasters vanish and calamities scatter; blessings and felicitations overflow beyond measure. First knock the teeth through the twenty-four passages, then hold the thought:

The brain spirit, bright and aware, the Primordial Child, named Dao Du, form length one inch and one fen, color pure white. The hair spirit named Xuan Wenhua, styled Dao Heng, form length two inches and two fen, color dark. The skin spirit named Tong Zhongzhong, styled Dao Lian, form length one inch and five fen, color yellow. The eye spirit named Xu Jiansheng, styled Dao Tong, form length three inches and six fen, wearing five colors. The nape marrow spirit named Ling Mo Gai, styled Dao Zhou, form length five inches, color white, dressed in plain robes. The back spirit named Yi Li Fu, styled Dao Zhu, form length three inches and a half, white jade plain robes. The nose spirit named Chong Long Yu, styled Dao Wei, form length two inches and five fen, wearing blue-white-yellow robes. The tongue spirit named Shi Liang Zhi, styled Dao Qi, form length seven inches, bright red.

These are the eight spirits of the upper body, the divine children’s names. First preserve them, each shaped like an infant, imitating the misty form upon the body, each settled in its place. When complete, knock the teeth through eight passages, swallow saliva eight times, and softly invoke:

Eight spirits of the upper scene, united into one body, the Emperor Lord’s Mysterious Mother, the Five Spirits arrayed, each presenting form, escaping transformation, flowing and changing to truth. A thousand chariots and ten thousand riders all ascend the imperial palace, the white origin without brilliance, the dao nurturing the great guests, eight spirits winging the body, jade blossoms holding smoke, faintly circling ten times, directly arriving at the Sun Gate.

At the beginning of preserving thought, first call the spirit names thrice, after invocation call them thrice again, so that the voice issues forth, the three parts united as one. At dawn, noon, and midnight, always preserve the twenty-four spirits, reciting them in order, invoking and calling as above.

The *Supreme Treasure Scripture of Divine Illumination* says: The method of knocking the teeth is to knock left to left, called “Knocking the Heavenly Bell.” Knock right to right, called “Beating the Heavenly Plate.” Knock center top to bottom, called “Sounding the Heavenly Drum.” If suddenly encountering misfortune and evil omens, knock the Heavenly Bell thirty times. If passing a mountain, warding off demons with mighty divine invocation, beat the Heavenly Chime. If preserving thought and contemplating the dao, summoning truth and calling spirits, sound the Heavenly Drum. Though knocking the teeth seems one action, it truly involves left and right, top and bottom. Thus, evil fears the sound of the Heavenly Bell, mountain spirits dread the movement of the Heavenly Chime, spirits summoned are solemnized by the trembling of the Heavenly Drum. The dark azure has rhythm, subtle inner resonance; one cannot seek it with a single plate nor join it by chance. Thousands of chapters and myriad affairs all follow thus; the way of knocking teeth unfolds, the sounds of bell and drum differ. Therefore, the dao’s numbers must not err or stray, the method’s guards must not be confused. If mistaken, there is ruin in darkness; if confused, there is disaster in uproar. This is not a blind, unconnected wandering. To act blindly without order is to fail the dao and make affairs unverifiable, for the path to truth is lost. To tread clumsily is to bring disgrace among the worldly. Knocking the Heavenly Bell thirty times means no other invocation is needed; one acts alone to remove misfortune. If one has a case to follow, knock the teeth as many times as the method prescribes; it is not necessary always to knock thirty times.

The throat spirit named Bai Liufang, styled Dao Tong, form length eight inches and eight fen, wearing nine colors. The lung spirit named Su Lingsheng, styled Dao Ping, form length eight inches and one fen, pure white. The heart spirit named Huan Yangchang, styled Dao Ming, form length nine inches, color red. The liver spirit named Kai Juntong, styled Dao Qing, form length six inches, color blue-yellow. The gallbladder spirit named Long Deju, styled Dao Fang, form length two inches and six fen, color blue-yellow-green. The left kidney spirit named Chun Yuan Zhen, styled Dao Qing, form length three inches and seven fen, colors shifting white, red, blue, five colors inconstant. The right kidney spirit named Xiang Di Wu, styled Dao Sheng, form length three inches and five fen, color white or black. The spleen spirit named Bao Yuanquan, styled Dao Qian, form length seven inches and three fen, color pure yellow.

These are the eight spirits of the middle body, the divine children’s names. Next preserve them, each like an infant, imitating the misty form upon the body, each settled in its place. When complete, knock the teeth through eight passages, swallow saliva eight times, and recite the incantation:

Eight spirits of the middle scene, four transformations and nine flights, refining the soul and correcting the body, bright scene shining together. The Emperor Lord unties knots, the fetus refined in four returns, ascending to the Mysterious Mother, scattering spirit steps with majesty. To join with the eight spirits, united in carriages and gates, a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders ascend Taiwei.

The stomach spirit named Tong Lai Yu, styled Dao Zhan, form length seven inches, color yellow. The lower intestine spirit named Zhao Tengkang, styled Dao Huan, form length two inches and four fen, yellow-red color. The large and small intestine spirit named Peng Songliu, styled Dao Chu, form length two inches and one fen, color red-yellow. The torso spirit named Shou Hou Bo, styled Dao Xu, form length nine inches and one fen, wearing nine colors. The diaphragm spirit named Guang Yingzhai, styled Dao Zhong, form length five inches, color white. The two flanks spirit named Pi Xia Ma, styled Dao Cheng, form length four inches and one fen, red-white color. The left yin and left yang spirit named Fu Liuqi, styled Dao Gui, form length two inches and three fen, blue-yellow-white color; in males preserved as left yang, in females as left yin. The right yin and right yang spirit named Bao Biaoming, styled Dao Sheng, form length two inches and three fen, blue-yellow-white color; in males preserved as right yang, in females as right yin.

These are the eight spirits of the lower body, the divine children’s names. Lastly preserve them, each like an infant, imitating the misty form upon the body, each settled in its place. When complete, knock the teeth through eight passages, swallow saliva eight times, and softly invoke:

Eight spirits of the lower scene, scattering form with nine spirits, purple smoke thickly born, containing origin and guarding essence. Taiyi the Primordial Father, the Emperor Lord standing forth, seven clear ones exempt from record, governing fate and recording life, soul and spirit at peace, five blossoms nurturing brightness, a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, all united with me, first creating the Great Element, bowing north to Supreme Clarity.

The Dao One Inner Spirit, named Dai Wuma, styled Dao Jisheng, form length one inch and two fen, purple color. In males preserved as Dao One Inner Spirit, in females as True Primordial Middle Spirit.

This is the secret spirit of the supreme root, guarding the center’s highest spirit. Next preserve it, like an infant’s form, seated in place. When complete, knock the teeth through twenty-four passages, swallow saliva twenty-four times, and softly recite:

Mysterious Supreme Inner Truth, nurturing form and attending morning, governing bonds and gathering threads, nine degrees and eight rotations, the Dipper stars shining within, palaces and halls arrayed in nine, the Emperor Lord united in prosperity, nine paths and seven passages, issuing liquids and inner essence, harmonizing and pouring to all spirits, the five organs producing blossoms, reversing old age to youthful countenance, a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders ascending with me to Heaven, paying homage to the Supreme Terrace, bowing deeply to the Jade Morning.

This is the treasured name of the body’s inner character, the spirit of transformation and birth. Without knowing this name, the immortal dao cannot be fulfilled. If on the day of knot-release one does not first invoke this, the knots will not dissolve. If knots do not dissolve, the three souls lose their place, the upper origin is lost within, the five elders lose their sight, and the Emperor Lord turns away in estrangement. Males preserve it as the spirit of a boy, females as the spirit of a girl, both sharing the same name.

To preserve the twenty-four spirits, one must lie flat at midnight, remove the pillow, hold firmly and relax the body, regulate the breath subtly, preserve thought of one’s bodily spirits, calmly think of the Emperor Lord, causing the misty forms to take their places. Close the eyes and look inward. If anything is incomplete, burn incense, sit calmly with eyes closed, hold firmly on both knees, preserve essence and all spirits, and invoke according to the method. At dawn and noon, preserve the spirits starting from sitting calmly; do not allow others to see. All look inward, closing eyes while preserving.

On the first day of the month at midnight, after preserving the spirits, also preserve the white breath in the two eyes, like the size of a chicken’s egg, before the face. In a moment it transforms into two bright mirrors, each nine inches in diameter, reflecting front and back upon one’s whole body and the twenty-four spirits, making the inspection clear and distinct. After a long while, mentally invoke:

Great Bright Treasure Mirror, scattering form and blossoming flowers, reflecting the original spirit clearly, restraining ten thousand demons, flying to Supreme Clarity, unveiling cloud veils, commanding a thousand spirits, sealing mountains and summoning rivers.

Complete. Perform this every five days; this is called covering and inspecting the inner essence, checking the five spirits. Those who can always do this will have no disasters arise and will ascend to high immortality.

## The Way of the Whisk-Bearer, to thoroughly see the Emperor Lord’s Five Spirits:

Always on the tenth day of the sexagenary cycle, on the day of Gengwu, at noon, take one sheng of pure water, drop one zhu of true elixir into the water and stir it three or five times counterclockwise, invoking:

Mysterious flowing vermilion essence, generating light entering brightness, the body’s spirits all arrayed, all coming to see and act, thoroughly viewing ten thousand li, reaching the nine spirits, the Emperor Lord’s reflecting child, sending me to Supreme Clarity.

After invocation, bind the gaze and wash the eyes twenty-seven times. Those who do this regularly can thoroughly see all spirits. The invocation should be whispered softly, washing the eyes facing the moon, not always facing east.
