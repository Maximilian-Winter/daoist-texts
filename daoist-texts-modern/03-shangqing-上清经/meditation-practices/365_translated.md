## Preface to the Commentary on the Supreme Cavern Chamber Inner Scripture

*By Perfected Zhou*

The Dao can be studied, yet subtle thought is truly difficult.  
The immortal can be sought, yet utmost refinement is hard to attain.  
The Perfected can be seen, yet nurturing the will and nature is arduous.  
The Jade Maiden can be summoned, yet cultivating purity and stillness is challenging.  

Thus, the Eight Primitives place true thought as foremost;  
The secret words hold the Nine Truths as the inner scripture;  
The divine methods rely on refined thought as the deepest;  
Returning to childhood means perfect truth as spiritual attainment;  
The Great Cavern is the supreme origin;  
The Great Elixir is the inner essence of the female One and Three Primitives;  
The Old Lord reveres naturalness;  
The Supreme One values the unmanifest as pure;  
The Yellow and Old honor will and nature as the Dao;  
The White Origin cherishes purity and stillness as chastity;  
The Perfected seek union of will and mutual pursuit;  
The immortal essence depends on refined response for Dao to be fulfilled.  

These are all the precious aspects of the Dao—reflect on them and practice accordingly.  
If thought does not respond, the Dao will not advance;  
If refinement is not subtle, the true will recede far away.  

Do not sacrifice life for death; do not let lust defile chastity;  
Do not drunkenly ponder the Dao; do not seek life by crooked means;  
Do not advance by glory or rank; do not regard ghosts as numinous;  
Do not treasure wealth; do not fill yourself with adornments;  
Do not delight in vulgarity; do not be swayed by hearsay;  
Do not confuse the pure with the impure; do not let the body lose refinement.  

There are many things men should avoid.  
Preserve the cavern chamber; be cautious with words I forbid.  

Few are born knowing the natural Dao; cultivate and practice it, study and refine it.  
Laozi said: “The superior person hears the Dao and diligently practices it.”  
Truly, these words are trustworthy.  

The Great Cavern is called the true scripture because it is the utmost true refinement.  
The difficulty of subtle thought refers to the challenge of preserving the cavern chamber.  
If one can be subtle and profound, with refined thought deeply moved,  
And preserve the vision of the unmanifest, then the Perfected’s Dao is complete.  

Laozi’s *Outer Scenery* says: “The secret to longevity is the essential matter of the chamber.”  
When you are in the cavern chamber, if you see the White Origin Lord on the right, then the immortal path is fulfilled;  
In the center, if you see the Yellow Old Lord, then you will live ten thousand years;  
On the left, if you see the Unmanifest Lord, then you have reached the utmost essence of truth.  

When the three lords appear, the white sun rises to Heaven,  
Wearing flowing bells and tiger talismans, roaming the Upper Clarity.  
If a person’s virtue in the world matches this, their name will be recorded;  
Without this virtue, there is no hope for immortality.

## Signs of Birth and the Path to Immortality

One born with a golden tally and jade name;  
Two, with the Supreme Mysterious Palace holding the plain register;  
Three, with great characters on the left hand;  
Four, with a blue mark on the back, resembling the River Chief;  
Five, with seven stars marked on the body;  
Six, with purple light in the crown, illuminating the body;  
Seven, moving like cranes and dragons, with body adorned in netted patterns;  
Eight, with nine apertures in the heart, a blue cavity beneath the lungs;  
Nine, with five energies growing from the head, connecting to layered clouds above;  
Ten, with jade sounds and golden echoes, purple breath issuing from the mouth.  

If one is born with these, no need to learn the Dao—they are destined to become immortal.  

Next come those born without the place of death;  
Then those with blue bones;  
Then those who surpass ancient sages;  
Then those whose virtue equals the highest worthies;  
Then those steadfast in will and reaching the Dao, focusing their heart on the profound subtlety, flowing with hidden virtue, acting without violating the Dao.  

Next are those whose will and conduct are pure and gentle, whose nature is harmonious and kind, soft, thick, warm, and benevolent—what they preserve will surely respond.  

By learning the Dao thus, one may attain immortality.  

Next are those whose ancestors bestowed grace, cultivating virtue for seven generations, meriting the Three Officials, without offending gods or men, diligently practicing the Dao themselves—these may again become immortals.  

Next are those whose ancestors bear immortal names, already possessing great merit with the Three Officials, having three hundred good deeds—these may attain immortality.  

Below these, even if gifted and brilliant beyond the world, without these highest matters, one only labors in vain, with no hope of immortality.  

In sum, those born with a bone record surely have the immortal will.

## Transmission and Practice Instructions

Now, I pass on the Dao I have received to you—be careful not to transmit it to the unworthy.  

Long ago, Master Su Zixuan, a foreigner, excelled in the Three Ones practice and was an immortal of the Central Mountain.  

I, fond of the Dao, have met him and was granted the divine Ganoderma, taught the immortal Dao, and received the true secret words of the Old Lord’s Yellow Court Outer Scripture.  

I have faithfully practiced and risen to Perfected status.  

Now you study the Dao; I write this to pass on to you—read and practice accordingly.  

Preserve the cavern chamber White Origin Lord; always at sunrise, when the mysterious light first appears, stand facing east, bow twice, close your eyes and look inward, hold your breath and swallow saliva one hundred and twenty times.  

Then preserve the image of the Scarlet Palace Great God within the jade chamber, and see the White Origin Lord.  

Practice this morning and evening as a method.  

Every day of the Jiazi cycle, at midnight when the vital breath is born, loosen your hair, apply powder, place your hands on your knees, hold breath and swallow saliva one hundred and forty times.  

Call the name of the jade chamber spirit; when called, the ear will hear a response like a human voice, sometimes accompanied by chanting—this is the response.  

Then rub your eyes with both hands twenty-seven times and stop.  

The key to this practice is to wear fine clothes and coverings, carefully keeping yin qi away; seek a secluded quiet chamber, so the ears hear nothing, the eyes see nothing, the heart holds nothing, the body is still and the spirit harmonious—only then proceed.  

If near the human world, seen by others, or if one feels sorrow, fear, or panic, the spirit will be offended, preservation will not respond, and the practice will fail.  

I then bow twice and carry out the practice.  

After preserving the cavern chamber for five years, I indeed saw on the right side of the chamber the White Origin Lord, wearing dragon robes and tiger belts, standing precisely on the right side of the chamber.  

I secretly laughed to myself, knowing the Dao would surely be fulfilled.  

Then I traveled the world’s five sacred mountains, meeting immortal men who orally transmitted Dao secrets—over five hundred and seventy matters in all.  

I will gradually pass these to you; keep them secret and cultivate carefully. Be cautious not to transmit to the unworthy.

## Encounter with the Yellow Old Lord

Long ago, I ascended the Central Mountain’s high peak, opened the洞庭 (Cavern Court), entered the cavern gate, and met the Yellow Old Lord.  

I immediately bowed twice and declared:  

“I, a mortal tainted by the world’s flesh, stained by filthy dust, for seventy years privately cherish one heart, secretly admire the Great Dao, and aspire to the divine immortals.  

The true Dao is profound and distant, numinous and wondrous.  

Though I have traveled the five sacred mountains, surpassed famous peaks, and met immortals to receive secret instructions, my stubborn filth is hard to remove, and I have yet to ascend.”  

Now, in this mysterious shining light, receiving the returning sun’s radiance, I have personally seen the true visage and received the spiritual brilliance.  

Therefore, I kowtow and plead: for the years of my life and my wishes, I beseech your pity and grant me the divine secret.”  

The Yellow Old Lord said:  

“You preserve the cavern chamber; do you see the White Origin Lord?”  

I advanced and knelt long, replying: “I truly see the White Origin Lord.”  

The Yellow Old Lord said:  

“You are not yet sufficient; continue to travel and receive true instructions. I will grant you the Supreme True Dao Scripture.”  

I again bowed, beating my chest, and earnestly requested to be an envoy to roam and serve the dragon carriage.  

The Yellow Old Lord said:  

“You have a golden tally and jade name; you shall be a Perfected. What worries have you?  

You see the White Origin Lord; your immortal affairs are sufficient.  

If you wish to be a Perfected, preserve the Unmanifest.  

If you see the Unmanifest, the true Dao is fulfilled.  

You may preserve it; I do not doubt you.”  

I again declared, begging for the cavern chamber scripture, the great lord’s inner section.  

The Yellow Old Lord said:  

“Within the cavern chamber’s utmost refinement dwells a great god, nameless and ineffable.  

If not you, then whom should receive it?  

Go retreat and fast, then return; I will grant it to you.”  

I bowed twice and respectfully accepted the teaching.  

After retreating and fasting in the Lesser Chamber for three months, I ascended the Great Chamber, reentered the cavern gate, and again met the Yellow Old Lord.  

The Yellow Old Lord said:  

“Now I grant you the cavern chamber inner scripture.  

Preserve this god; always at midnight, close your eyes and quietly contemplate, reciting this scripture.  

Suddenly you will see the great god, the Unmanifest Lord.”  

I bowed twice and accepted the teaching, practiced accordingly, and after twenty-seven years saw the Unmanifest Lord, and again saw the Yellow Old Lord, who granted me the *Great Cavern True Scripture*.  

Then I rode clouds and dragons, ascending to Heaven in broad daylight.  

This scripture is most secret; now I grant it to you—be cautious not to transmit it to the unworthy.

## Commentary on the Supreme Cavern Chamber Inner Scripture

**Yellow Old Lord said:**

I am the Yellow Old Lord, the Central Dao Lord.  
I govern the Cloud Court Palace, the Cloud Court Cavern Chamber, the Divine Gate at the center.  
My divine name is Bo Tao, the so-called Great Lord of the Dao.

Heaven has a divine palace, the Supreme Mysterious Elixir Spirit,  
The Supreme Mysterious Elixir Spirit is the palace of the Heavenly Emperor,  
Also called the Supreme Subtle, the Purple Palace, the Elixir Terrace, the Spirit Palace—  
The residence of the August Heavenly Emperor.  

Its image is a person with a cavern chamber.  

Discussing the essentials within the Purple Chamber, first speak of the Purple Palace Elixir Spirit.

Heaven has the Great Chamber and the Jade Chamber Cloud Court,  
The Cloud Court is where the Yellow Old Lord dwells at center,  
Man is in the center of the cavern chamber.  

The Jade Chamber is the cavern chamber, also called the Purple Chamber, the Scarlet Palace, the Bright Hall,  
Above is the floral canopy, the east and west palaces,  
The cavern connects left and right to the Yellow Court within.

The Kunlun Peak is formed, high and unyielding,  
Kunlun is the head; the Purple Chamber cavern connects to the head, both high and deep.  
It resembles Kunlun’s Mysterious Garden and Yellow Chamber to the south,  
South lies the洞庭 (Cavern Court) chamber, also called the Cavern Gate.  

When discussing the Purple Chamber, first speak of the head.

The immortals reside in the Golden Hall and Jade City,  
The cavern chamber has a golden city and jade chamber,  
Four directions reach the Spirit Palace,  
Mysterious radiance shines on both sides,  
The cavern essence floats in the clouds,  
The Three Elders of the immortals dwell there.

The chamber is square and round, within three inches,  
The golden jade palace room is within three inches.

The Yellow Gate and Purple Door are supremely mysterious and refined,  
Within the Purple Chamber is the Yellow Gate, connected to the Yellow Court,  
At the center is the Purple Door.  

The Purple Door is also called the Cloud Court, where the Yellow Old Lord dwells.  
Within the Purple Door is profound and utmost refinement.

To the left is the Blue Palace, where the Blue Youth dwells.  
To the right is the Bright Pure Palace, where the White Pure Jade Maiden dwells.  

If broadly preserved, the Blue Youth may become the Nine Old Lords;  
If refined and subtle, the White Pure Jade Maiden becomes the Mother of Western Purity.  

These are the alternate names of the left and right eye spirits;  
Preserve them day and night, and immortality is attainable.

In the center is the Great Truth, beyond naming,  
Within the cavern chamber dwells the great god,  
Utmost true and subtle.  

To the left is the Unmanifest Lord, also called the Elemental Lord, also the Divine Young Master;  
To the right is the White Origin Lord, also called the Cavern Yang Lord.  

These are the great gods within the jade chamber.  
If you focus and can preserve them, the true Dao is fulfilled.

Who are their parents? They arise naturally from emptiness,  
This sovereign of the primal essence elements has no parents,  
Existing in harmonious unity, born before the primal void.  
Preserve them day and night without neglect.

The Unmanifest Lord wears a splendid crown and purple canopy,  
Wears flowing golden bells,  
Roams the Supreme Mysterious,  
Can master the true scriptures.  

The preservation method is always practiced after midnight when vital breath arises,  
Sit upright, place hands on knees, hold breath, close eyes and look inward,  
Recite:  

“Three Primes’ heroic breath, Supreme Mysterious Purple Throne,  
Yellow Gate Golden Chamber, within dwells the great god,  
Splendid crown and purple canopy, dragon robes and tiger patterns,  
Issuing elixir, entering emptiness, calling Yang, summoning Yin,  
Heavenly Dao is true, named Unmanifest,  
Supporting my life, nurturing me, enduring with the Dao.”  

The White Origin Lord wears dragon robes and tiger belts,  
Reads the洞真经 (Cavern Truth Scripture).  

Preserving him, always at dawn at sunrise, face east and bow twice,  
Hold breath, close eyes and look inward, recite:  

“Supreme divine essence, right at the divine gate,  
Dragon robes and tiger belts, morning yellow splendid crown,  
Holding the register and scripture, this is White Origin,  
Together we roam, ascend to the Yang Gate,  
Circling the Nine Purities, returning to the Yellow Chamber.”  

Leaving the Yellow Chamber, playing in the Elixir Field,  
The Yellow Chamber is the cavern chamber.  
Unmanifest and White Origin emerge from the Yellow Chamber, roaming the Elixir Field together.  
Preserve them day and night; surely one will become a Perfected.

Ascending to the Supreme Subtle, sometimes entering the Mysterious Cavern,  
The Divine Abode is the Mysterious Cavern,  
The Supreme Subtle is the palace of the August Heavenly Emperor.  

If one can preserve and see the Unmanifest, then one attains the Supreme True Secret, the *Great Cavern True Scripture*.  
This is the true Dao.  

Seeing the White Origin Lord, the immortal path is complete.  

Broadly speaking, the Unmanifest Lord is the elemental truth;  
The White Origin Lord is the upper immortal path.

Gathering the Six Harmonies, meeting the Peach Lord,  
The Peach Lord is the Great Dao Lord,  
Wearing vermilion robes and purple crown, right at the Life Gate.  

The Unmanifest Lord and Great Dao Lord contain form within the Six Harmonies.  
There are separate scriptures and secrets.

Sometimes roaming the Seven Gates, thoroughly seeing the Yellow Tranquil,  
Yellow Tranquil is the spirit name of the Yellow Chamber,  
Located one inch above the center of the breasts.  

Always at dusk, knock teeth twenty-seven times, recite:  

“Yellow Chamber dweller, wearing yellow essence,  
Harmonizing true flowing breath, circulating my form,  
Calling soul and commanding spirit,  
Granting me longevity, left leading, right accompanying,  
Yellow spirit conceals the body.”  

Calling Yang and summoning Yin, commanding the Six Dings,  
Yang is the Supreme Three Yang;  
Yin is the three Yin within Yang;  
The Six Dings are divine maidens.  

When the Perfected calls Yang, three breaths come;  
Summons Yin, three dragons ascend;  
Commands the Six Dings, the divine maidens appear.  

The method of calling Yang has its own scripture, the Old Lord’s scripture.

Chaos is one light, returning to primal Yang.  
The Three Ones are also great gods.  
Primal Yang is another name for One.  

The White Origin Lord and One enter and exit together, meeting in the Elixir Field.  
The Three Ones have separate guarding secret scriptures.

The Three are subtle and wondrous; the chamber is the true capital.  
The Three Subtleties are the nine mud points in the head, the scarlet palace in the heart, and the Elixir Field below the navel.  
All three subtleties are truly wondrous; their true capital is only in the jade chamber, most refined—how subtle and deep!

Deep and subtle, before the primal,  
The cavern chamber is utmost subtle,  
Within it the god is utmost refined and true,  
Born of the Supreme Void Lord, born of the upper primal breath.

If you can see it, you ascend in broad daylight at dawn.  
Dawn is the spirit within the Supreme Subtle.  
The Supreme Subtle has five palaces; Dawn is the Supreme Ultimate Palace,  
Its right is the Perfected’s hall.  

The inner name is the jade chamber; the Unmanifest Lord dwells on its left,  
The White Origin Lord on its right.

Refined mastery of spirit vision, Yang qi becomes cloud,  
Calling Yang’s three breaths forms the three primitives into cloud.  
Penetrating the six harmonies of the cavern, the three gods come to see.  
Then the three breaths transform into cloud, the so-called cloud of the three primitives.

Penetrating the six harmonies of the cavern, drawing Yin and summoning dragons,  
Within Yin and Yang are the three Yin.  
Refined mastery of spirit vision, three primitives form cloud,  
Penetrating the six harmonies, the three Yin summon dragons,  
Riding clouds and dragons, the true Dao is complete.

The purple and emerald canopy rises, roaming the immortal palace,  
Purple and emerald are the floral canopy.  
The immortal palace is the Supreme Ultimate official residence.  
With utmost refinement and spirit vision, riding clouds and dragons,  
The purple canopy covers, the Jade Maiden Yu Yuan,  
Ascends to the Emperor Lord, roaming the immortal palace,  
Then the immortal path is greatly fulfilled, becoming a Perfected.

The cavern chamber is complete—be cautious not to transmit it recklessly.

The central Yellow Old Lord says the chamber’s Dao is complete—do not transmit it to the unworthy.

## Daily Practice of the Five Directions’ Cloud Qi

At dawn, noon, and after sunset, preserve and imagine the cloud qi of the five directions.

The eastern blue qi transforms into the Azure Dragon;  
The western white qi transforms into the White Tiger;  
The southern red qi transforms into the Vermilion Bird;  
The northern black qi transforms into the Mysterious Warrior;  
The central yellow qi transforms into oneself.

## Dawn Hymn

Subtle and vast,  
The primal qi’s refined light.  
Magnificent and delightful,  
The soaring of soul and spirit.  
Hiding within my chest,  
The midst is spacious and empty as a canopy.  
The beam is white as the bright moon,  
Connecting all ten thousand directions.  
The Ganoderma grass is so flourishing,  
Unworried by lack of root.  
Breathing out the old and taking in the new,  
To communicate with the divine spirits.

---

## Dusk Hymn

Vast and boundless,  
With the gods without end.  
Wearing beautiful garments,  
Eating mysterious Ganoderma.  
Galloping like horses,  
The Jade Balance as chariot.  
No bounds above or below,  
No fixed times for coming and going.  
All diseases are dispelled and cured,  
The divine qi alone sustains.  
The Controller of Fate records the register,  
Jade slips and elixir writings,  
Bound with golden threads,  
Wrapped with white silk.  
Countless in the billions and myriads,  
Nothing remains doubtful.  
The Great One aids me,  
The divine spirits support.

---

## Instructions for Recitation and Cautions

Recite with clear purity and no distracting thoughts,  
Facing the cardinal directions or the sun and stars.  

Those wearing talismanic officials and making covenants with Heaven and Earth,  
Using the body to realize the Dao and delight in its methods,  
All recite this.  

If not according to the method, the penalty is five hundred strokes,  
The chief official presides.

Avoid reciting on the days of Wuchen and Wuxu.  

This hymn is from Volume Nine of the *Zhengyi Xuandu Code*.
