## Scripture of the Golden Palace Sovereign, True Unity of the Three Primal Origins

*Master Juan transmits to the Azure Youth Sovereign of the Eastern Sea*

The perfected one values oneness as the true essence. Above is the One Body Heavenly Emperor; in the middle, the Scarlet Palace’s Elixir Sovereign; below, the Yellow Court’s Primal King. Together they oversee and govern the twenty-four qi within the body, corresponding to the twenty-four True Ones of the Supreme Subtlety. Qi is the spirit formed from condensed ethereal smoke. Each of the Three Primal Sovereigns commands thousands of chariots and myriad riders, cloud carriages and feathered canopies, ever entering within to the Purple Palace, ascending to the Supreme Clarity, recording the primal charts, holding the rank of perfected ones, soaring through the nine heavens.

If one can guard this steadfastly, then the Three-in-One may be seen. When the Three-in-One is seen, the myriad chariots and countless riders arrive. The feathered canopies can be ridden, the cloud carriages mounted, ascending by day to Heaven, journeying to the Supreme Subtlety. Within the Supreme Subtlety dwell twenty-four qi, mingled yellow and blended, gathering and transforming qi, sometimes suddenly dividing and flowing forth. Within this qi are twenty-four perfected ones, all the qi of the Three-in-One Sovereigns, bringing forth the differentiated paths and transformations.

If one can guard the Three-in-One within the body, then the sovereigns of the Three-in-One in the Supreme Subtlety above descend and appear outside, speaking with you.

Within the body again are twenty-four perfected ones, also generated by the refined essence and bright qi within the body. When the cloud carriage comes to escort one to ascend the Supreme Subtlety, the twenty-four perfected ones of the Supreme Subtlety join with the body’s spiritual lights in a banquet within the blended yellow, sharing the radiance of division and ascent, harmonizing the virtues within and without. All enter and exit the Supreme Clarity, resting in the Supreme Subtlety, also traversing the Cavern Chamber.

Within the Cavern Chamber itself is the Yellow Gate, Purple Portal, and Mysterious Essence Chamber — the constant dwelling place of the Three-in-One Honored Sovereigns within the body. Those who traverse it see one spirit growing swifter. The perfected ones of the Cavern Chamber must guard oneness as their root; guarding the One perfected one requires the Cavern Chamber as its canopy. Thus the Three-in-One mutually require each other; the Cavern Chamber mutually awaits them. Though their abodes differ, their Dao and function are harmoniously interdependent.

If one only attains one path and focuses the mind firmly, one may enter the Supreme Clarity, earning the rank of Supreme Clarity Immortal Sovereign alone, but will not roam the Supreme Subtlety or float to the Supreme Clarity above.

The highest perfected emperor above is the ultimate of the Heavenly Emperor; the middle One perfected sovereign is the utmost of the Elixir Emperor; the lower One perfected king is the subtlety of the Primal King. The Heavenly Emperor attains the ultimate, thus above is the Imperial Apex; the Earthly Emperor attains the utmost, thus above is the True Unity; the Human Emperor attains the subtlety, thus above is the Sovereign of myriad subtleties.

The Three Sovereigns embody truth by guarding oneness; thus oneness hides no form — it is the ultimate truth. When the Three-in-One shine together, attaining oneness gives birth. Therefore, those who study the Three Sovereigns in the world all value guarding the true unity.

Guarding true unity means the mind is simple and the spirit concentrated, blending and focusing on mysterious response, so that a hundred thoughts do not arise, and essence and intention do not scatter. Within three months of inner observation, focusing the mind on one spirit, the spirit’s light transforms and is born outside the body, roaming with it. This is focused thought without distraction, concentrating qi to harmony, arriving at simplicity swiftly.

Since simplicity disperses, truth separates, illusions gradually arise, competing thoughts and confusion are born. Therefore, oneness is not fully seen, spirits do not immediately respond. It is not that one does not wish to abide; those who keep it are not focused, those who think on it are not discerning. Thus, after years of accumulated effort, only then does semblance appear.

If one can fast from worldly affairs, focus the mind without striving, surely within three months the response will come, and one will face the One.

The Three Primal Origins are the Jade Truths of the Nine Heavens, the true path of the Most High. Thus the True Unity Great Dao issues forth the True Emperor; the true path of mysterious truth gives birth to the Great Spirits. The Three Primal Origins unravel transformations, so that what the One gives birth to, all truths return to One, and mysterious功 is fulfilled. This is the ancestor of the true path, the root and beginning of primordial qi.

The method of the Three-in-One comprehends the Dao fully in the Three Primal Origins, encompassing the spiritual chapters, grasping the treasured divine scripture. The first secret is the *Great Cavern True Scripture*; the second secret is the *Great Abundance Mysterious Scripture*; the third secret is the *Most High Simple Spirit*. Therefore, the upper emperor treasures the *Great Cavern True Scripture*; the middle Elixir Emperor treasures the *Great Abundance Mysterious Scripture*; the lower Primal King treasures the *Most High Simple Spirit*. These three texts are the utmost refinement of the true Dao, the supreme chapters of the Three-in-One, and the forbidden secrets of the Supreme Clarity.

Marvelous and nameless, its Dao is not far away. Guarding the One gives birth to the Three-in-One. Since you have seen the One, you may seek this scripture, and it should also be secretly transmitted to guard the Three-in-One method.

The Golden Palace Sovereign of the Most High Supreme Clarity’s true scripture’s foremost chapter, the wondrous secret of all perfected ones. If you can guard the One, the One will guard you; if you can see the One, the One will also see you. Your body’s advance and retreat, myriad matters, must always think of the One.

In eating and drinking, think of the One; in joy and pleasure, think of the One; in sorrow and grief, think of the One; in illness, think of the One; in danger and peril, think of the One; when treading water or fire, think of the One; when riding carriage or horse, think of the One; in urgency, think of the One.

A person’s thought of the One, in every movement and gaze, is many; the thought is focused. The trouble is when one’s will is not firm, and firmness cannot last long. Knowing the name of One but not guarding it; guarding but not firm in will; many boast but cannot keep constant. Thus when the Three-in-One departs, correct qi leaves; those who lose correct qi fall to evil qi; when evil qi comes, death draws near.

Common people who study the Dao seek superficial splendor, not believing true unity is precious. At first they have resolve, but later fail, because their will is not one; evil qi enters because of this. The caution in guarding the One is to beware of not focusing; focusing but not lasting; lasting but not refined — then the Three-in-One departs, the body becomes an empty house without a master. How long can such calamity endure?

Qi condenses into essence; essence moves spirit; spirit transforms into infant; infant rises to perfected one; perfected one ascends to red child — this is true unity.

Heaven has three mysteries: the sun, moon, and stars. It also has three essences, used for longevity. Man has three treasures: the three cinnabar fields, also called the three truths, used for eternal existence.

The *Scripture of the Numinous Treasure* says: “Heavenly essence, earthly truth, the three treasures always endure.” This is what is meant.

Between the eyebrows is the upper cinnabar field; the heart’s Scarlet Palace is the middle cinnabar field; three cun below the navel is the lower cinnabar field — these three cinnabar fields combined.

The red child dwells in the upper cinnabar palace; the perfected one dwells in the middle cinnabar palace; the infant dwells in the lower cinnabar palace.

Between the eyebrows, going inward one cun is the Bright Hall; inward two cun is the Cavern Chamber; inward three cun is the cinnabar field, the Mud Pellet Palace. “Going inward” means going toward the back of the neck.

The Mud Pellet Palace is exactly one cun on each of the four sides. Purple qi rushes to the heavens, shining outward seventy thousand li, covering the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper as a canopy, with the ladle handle pointing forward and outward.

Transforming in size, flying form faint and elusive, it is held in intention.

The upper origin red child dwells in the center, beneath the dipper canopy. The red child’s name is Mysterious Condensation Heaven, styled Three Primal Ancestor, holding the rank of Mud Pellet Heavenly Emperor.

To his right is an imperial minister facing him, the spirit of teeth, tongue, and brain, born from ascending transformation. His name is Initiation Lock Essence, styled Middle Mystery Birth, ascending to become the imperial minister sovereign.

These two jointly govern the Mud Pellet, both wearing red embroidered robes, appearing as newborn infants.

The Heavenly Emperor holds the Supreme Clarity Divine Tiger Talisman; the imperial minister holds the *Great Cavern True Scripture*. Sitting together facing outward, or sometimes facing each other.

Within, they guard the Mud Pellet, the realm of face, eyes, mouth, tongue, teeth, ears, nose, and hair; without, they awe and shake the six heavens, banishing myriad wicked and fierce demons.

The three souls and five spirits come once every seven days to pay homage and receive orders.

The heart is the middle cinnabar field, called the Scarlet Palace, governing the center of the heart. Exactly one cun on each of the four sides. Vermilion smoke ascends to the heavens, shining outward thirty thousand li, transforming faint and elusive, held in intention.

The middle origin perfected one dwells within, named Spirit Movement Pearl, styled Southern Son Cinnabar, holding the rank of Scarlet Palace Elixir Sovereign.

To his right is the assisting imperial minister, the spirit formed from the four viscera. Entering the Scarlet Palace as the assisting minister, named Radiant Firm, styled Four Spirits.

These two jointly govern the Scarlet Palace, both wearing vermilion brocade robes, appearing as newborn infants.

The Elixir Sovereign holds Mars, the Fire Star, in his left hand, and the *Grand Protector Scripture* in his right. The assisting minister holds the *Great Abundance Mysterious Scripture*’s eight scenes. Sitting together facing outward, or sometimes facing each other.

Within, they guard muscles, bones, the five viscera, flesh and blood; without, they dispel myriad evil and misfortune, nourish light and calm the spirit, granting longevity and long vision, flying immortals to the Great Firmament.

The three souls and seven spirits come once every three days to pay homage and receive orders.

Three cun below the navel is called the Life Gate Cinnabar Palace. The lower origin infant dwells within, one cun on each side. White qi rushes to the heavens, shining outward seventy thousand li, transforming in size, flying form faint and elusive, held in intention.

The lower origin infant’s name is Beginning Bright Essence, styled Primal Yang Prosperity, holding the rank of Yellow Court Primal King.

To his right is the guardian minister, the spirit of essence, qi, and body fluids, condensed smoke ascending and transforming.

Entering the cinnabar palace, the guardian minister is named Return Supreme Bright, styled Valley Lower Mystery.

These two jointly govern the lower cinnabar palace, both wearing yellow embroidered silk robes, appearing as newborn infants.

The Primal King holds Venus, the Great White Metal Star, in his left hand, and the *Jade Morning Golden True Scripture* in his right. The guardian minister holds the *Most High Simple Spirit Scripture*, the nine courts’ life-generating talisman. Sitting together facing outward, or sometimes facing each other.

Within, they guard the four limbs, body fluids, intestines and stomach, bladder and other organs; without, they dispel disasters and scatter calamities, warding off myriad evils.

The three souls and seven spirits come thrice daily to pay homage and receive orders from the Primal King.

The method of guarding the One: on the day of the Beginning of Spring, at midnight, sit upright facing east; blow qi nine times; swallow saliva thirty-five times; then preserve the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper, slowly descending above the head, turning toward Heaven, with the ladle handle pointing directly east.

Preserve the Yin Essence and the two perfected stars, closely approaching the crown; the Yang Bright and Mysterious Dark two stars are behind above.

Yang Bright and Yin Essence stars are behind; Mysterious Dark and Perfected stars are in front. Thus, in semblance and remembrance, the position is fixed.

Then think of the Three-in-One Honored Sovereigns, suddenly transforming and giving birth, jointly emerging within the dipper’s chief star. In an instant, the three ministers are reborn as three sovereigns; in an instant, six persons ascend together to the Mysterious Dark star, swiftly moving eastward, reaching the heavenly gate and stopping, all facing my mouth.

Then visualize the upper origin hand supporting the upper minister, the middle origin hand supporting the middle minister, the lower origin hand supporting the lower minister.

I then swallow qi once through, pausing long; the two upper origin persons come from the qi into my mouth, ascending back to the Mud Pellet Palace.

Next I swallow qi once through, pausing long; the two middle origin persons come from the qi into my mouth, descending back to the Scarlet Palace.

Next I swallow qi once through, pausing long; the two lower origin persons come from the qi into my mouth, descending back into the lower cinnabar palace.

Preserve the heavenly gate star, commanding it to leave the mouth seven feet; the star commands facing before the mouth; the Three-in-One enter my three palaces.

All completed, then refine and contemplate true unity, each settling in its place. Sitting or lying, think on it in the heart; when the heart has wishes, all affairs open the heart; what is sought is also sought by the heart.

Preserve thought only to be still and silent; stillness is the chamber of rest; even by day one may preserve thought.

At Beginning of Summer, preserve the Three-in-One facing south, as at Beginning of Spring with refined thought.

At Beginning of Autumn, preserve the Three-in-One facing west, as at Beginning of Summer with refined thought.

At Beginning of Winter, preserve the Three-in-One facing north, as at Beginning of Autumn with refined thought.

Preserve and think of the Three-in-One, each settling in its office. When completed, softly recite:

> Command of the Five Directions and the Dipper,  
> Spirits summon the Seven Stars,  
> The Three Honored Ones condense and transform,  
> Above they summon the Purple Court,  
> Six Spirits wander,  
> Three Palaces and Cinnabar Cities,  
> Mysterious Communication Great Emperor,  
> Descend to the Cavern Yellow Tranquility,  
> Heavenly Truth guards and protects,  
> Summon and lead the Six Dings,  
> Immortals together float,  
> Riding smoke to the Three Pure Ones,  
> Four Bodies firmly refined,  
> Five Viscera self-generate.

Thus is the right method to guard the Scripture of the Golden Palace Sovereign, True Unity of the Three Primal Origins.
