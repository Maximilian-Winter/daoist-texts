## The Supreme Clarity Golden Palace Emperor’s Five Dipper Three-One Diagram Manual

At the precise midnight of the vernal equinox, rise and sit facing east. Close your eyes and hold within your body the Three Palaces, the Three Ones, the Three Ministers, and yourself—seven in all, with yourself at the center. Together, mount the smoke of purple qi and ascend to the Yang Bright Star of the Northern Dipper. This Yang Bright Star is the eastern deity of the Northern Dipper. There, enter and sit within the star’s center, swallowing thirty passes of purple qi. Practice this for a long time, and you will see the Yang Bright Star’s Eastern Primordial Most High Palace. Within the palace dwells a young azure mysterious boy who grants you the True Light. First, hold the purple qi beneath the Northern Dipper star, as large as a bowstring, pouring straight down before you. Then hold the Three Ones.

Master Zhou’s Secret Formula: Hold the seven persons and the seven stars of the Dipper as a canopy, and together ascend the Yang Bright Star in a flying formation, the wild geese in flight, with me at the center. The canopy star means the leader covers the head, the handle of the ladle points forward. Swallow thirty passes of purple qi—I hold the purple qi and swallow it. Then think on the Three Ones and the Three Ministers, swallowing them simultaneously. After finishing, hold the seven persons, and the purple qi comes down from the edge, returning to the Three Palaces. After a long while, silently recite:

> Three Honored Supreme Truths,  
> Most Mysterious High Spirits,  
> Yang Bright rules the spring,  
> Myriad children open the gate.  
> Dan Origin rules the summer,  
> Vermilion qi blends with smoke.  
> Yin Essence rules the autumn,  
> Heaven’s might with six arrays.  
> North Pole rules the winter,  
> Ten thousand evils blocked and destroyed.  
> Five Earths, Geng and Ren,  
> Wu and Ji, Heaven’s gate,  
> All crushed and extinguished,  
> None can withstand the way.  
> Refine my seven souls,  
> Harmonize my three spirits,  
> Generate my five organs,  
> Grant me true attainment,  
> Ascend and fly to Supreme Clarity,  
> Float among the seven origins,  
> Long life and smooth journey,  
> Command a thousand spirits with a shout.

When finished, you may also sleep while holding this state. The four seasonal festivals share this one invocation.

At midnight on the summer solstice, rise and sit facing south. Close your eyes and hold within your body the Three Palaces, the Three Ones, the Three Ministers, and yourself—seven in all, with yourself at the center. Together, mount the smoke of purple qi and ascend to the Dan Origin Star of the Northern Dipper. The Dan Origin Star is the southern deity of the Northern Dipper. Enter and sit within the star, swallow thirty passes of purple qi. Practice for a long time, and you will see the Dan Origin Star’s Southern Pole Most High Palace. Within the palace dwells the Vermilion Yang Spirit Consort, who grants you the Scarlet Script and precious writings.

---

At midnight on the autumnal equinox, rise and sit facing west. Close your eyes and hold within your body the Three Palaces, the Three Ones, the Three Ministers, and yourself—seven in all, with yourself at the center. Together, mount the smoke of purple qi and ascend to the Yin Essence Star of the Northern Dipper. The Yin Essence Star is the western deity of the Northern Dipper. Enter and sit within the star, swallow thirty passes of purple qi. Practice for a long time, and you will see the Yin Essence Star’s Western Primordial Most High Palace. Within the palace dwells the White Pure Maiden, who grants you the Jade Seal and Tiger Script.

---

At midnight on the winter solstice, rise and sit facing north. Close your eyes and hold within your body the Three Palaces, the Three Ones, the Three Ministers, and yourself—seven in all, with yourself at the center. Together, mount the smoke of purple qi and ascend to the Northern Pole Star of the Northern Dipper. The Northern Pole Star is the mysterious deity of the Northern Dipper. Enter and sit within the star’s center, each swallowing thirty passes of purple qi. Practice for a long time, and you will see the Northern Pole Star’s Northern Primordial Most High Palace. Within the palace dwells the Mysterious True Person, who grants you the Golden Book and secret characters in the sequence of three and five.

---

On the first or fifteenth day of the sixth month, avoiding the days of the autumnal equinox and summer solstice, at midnight sit facing southwest. Close your eyes and hold within your body the Three Palaces, the Three Ones, the Three Ministers, and yourself—seven in all, with yourself at the center. Together, mount the smoke of four qi—crimson, purple, azure, and yellow—and ascend to the Heavenly Gate Star of the Northern Dipper. The Heavenly Gate Star is the central deity of the Northern Dipper. Enter and sit within the star, swallowing ten passes each of the four-colored qi, starting with the crimson qi in order. Practice for a long time, and you will see the Heavenly Gate Star’s Central Primordial Most High Palace. Within the palace dwells the Most High Majestic True Great King, who grants you the Demon-Expelling Talisman, the Evil-Seizing Axe, and the Yellow-Clad Military Register.

---

Each of the eight solar terms is guarded for eight days, beginning at midnight on the festival day. On other days, simply hold the Three Palaces and sit peacefully. With utmost clarity and imagination, one may approach the state of vivid presence.

### The Right Guard’s Five Dipper True Unity Scripture Formula

The Daoist scholar, devoted and secluded in mountain forests, long hidden in rocky chambers, far removed from the human world, becomes ever more refined, and the spirit swiftly arrives. This is essential. Many do not understand the calculation of calendars and divisions of degrees, nor how to make the calendar. Without knowledge of the calendar’s way, the twenty-four qi and eight solar terms can never be truly known. Nor can one annually leave the human realm to seek and inquire—this is a scholar’s doubt. Now, according to the Northern Emperor’s natural calendar method: the third day of the first month is the Beginning of Spring; the fifteenth day of the second month is the Vernal Equinox; the first day of the fourth month is the Beginning of Summer; the sixteenth day of the fifth month is the Summer Solstice; the seventh day of the seventh month is the Beginning of Autumn; the twelfth day of the eighth month is the Autumnal Equinox; the fifth day of the tenth month is the Beginning of Winter; the eleventh day of the eleventh month is the Winter Solstice. Mountain forest practitioners should use this method. Those who understand the external calendar’s eight solar terms should follow accordingly. The eight solar terms of the calendar are the utmost degrees of the celestial pivot, the days when myriad true spirits, immortals, and divine beings gather in court.

The Northern Emperor’s natural method marks the days when two lunar phases coincide—also greatly auspicious times. It is fitting to cultivate the dao and virtue on these days, all considered as one. Foreign lands count the first day of the month as the start, the second as removal, counting thus. When no calendar is available, this may be used. The Xiongnu nation counts the first day of the first month as Jia Yin, the new moon as six Jia, cycling anew; the first month is large, the second large, the third small, the fourth large, the fifth small, the sixth large, the seventh small, the eighth large, the ninth small, the tenth large, the eleventh small, the twelfth large.

Those deeply secluded in the wilderness, utterly removed from worldly traces, should also follow this.

---

On every start day, or the first day of the month at dawn, hold the Three Ones emerging from your own Three Palaces, sitting before yourself. Then silently bow twice, as if seeing them vividly. Then silently recite:

> Heavenly Honored Three Emperors,  
> Guarding the life gate,  
> Wandering the void,  
> Six qi mysterious divisions,  
> Nourishing my five spirits,  
> Correcting my three souls,  
> Five organs self-generated,  
> Long life flying immortal.

Finished, then hold and return the Three Ones from the void to the Three Palaces. After a long while, swallow thirty passes of saliva. By this, at night you will dream of the Three Ones and the Three Ministers. Or you may dream of white crows, white cranes, white tigers, golden jade objects—all transformations and manifestations of the Three Ones. If you guard thus without neglect, you will see their images, gradually face to face.

---

On every removal day at midnight, secretly rise and face north. Gaze upward at the inner image of the seven stars of the Northern Dipper. See the Three Ones descend from the auxiliary stars and enter your Three Palaces. Then return to rest quietly, concentrating and holding the vision as if truly seen. Then softly recite:

> Most High Heavenly Support,  
> Where the Three Emperors roam,  
> The Three Ministers assist,  
> Joining with the true,  
> Descending into my body,  
> Sitting in peaceful stillness,  
> Exhaling essence to irrigate form,  
> Harmonizing soul and spirit,  
> Enabling me to fly as immortal,  
> Cloud chariot traveling the floating realms.

Finished, swallow twenty-seven passes of saliva. This is taken once a month on removal day.

---

On every opening day at midnight, rise and sit facing east. Remove your cap, or you may let your hair loose, then comb and tie it. After a long while, softly chant:

> Upper Origin Three Truths,  
> The infant within the truth,  
> Hair loosened, smoke dispersed,  
> Connecting above to the heavenly terrace,  
> The mud pellet solid and firm,  
> Simultaneous with Heaven,  
> Enabling me to fly as immortal,  
> Traversing and mingling with the cavernous terrace.

Finished, swallow nineteen passes of saliva, then don your cap and rest. Concentrate and hold the Three Ones and Three Ministers, each settled in their palaces, the Emperor and ministers facing each other. Hold the Three Ones and Three Ministers, each calling the qi in their palace, thirty passes each. When holding, also call the qi yourself thirty passes. Calling qi means opening the mouth and exhaling qi. At this time, you should feel a unified heat—this is the proof of harmonizing spirit and condensing soul. Hold the One before your eyes, inwardly viewing the spirit palace.

---

The way of holding the One causes the Most High Three Pure Qis to appear in the Three Palaces. The Three Pure are the purple, azure, and crimson three mysterious colored qi, with purple above. Then hold and guard the Three Ones within, imagining the Northern Pole’s purple chamber jade palace, arranging the celestial officials in order, thinking that you sit before the Emperor, making requests and offerings with bowed heart.

The Most High is Supreme Clarity, the Emperor of Supreme Clarity, supremely noble. The Northern Pole purple chamber is the Emperor’s chamber. Also hold your own Three Ones, discussing with the Emperor the way of flying true life.

---

Whenever facing a sumptuous meal, always correct your heart and hold the Three Ones. Imagine first drinking the food and drink, then signaling to eat it. Always so, evil qi retreats and true qi advances. After eating, silently recite:

> Hundred grains enter the stomach,  
> Unite with spirit and qi,  
> Fill and replenish the blood,  
> Corpse evil perishes and falls,  
> Ascend through the Golden Gate,  
> Long life in Heaven and Earth,  
> Command the six Dings,  
> Spiritual children serve and guard.

---

The method of guarding the One is on the days of Jia Wu, Jia Chen, and Jia Yin at midnight. Sweep and clear the resting courtyard, spread a mat one zhang square, burn incense facing north, bow twice, or simply bow in heart. Then gaze upward at the seven stars of the Northern Dipper, letting purple qi emerge from the Dipper, enter your body’s Three Palaces, and flow northward to join your hands above. Hold the Three Ones, Three Ministers, and yourself, all riding the purple qi to ascend the Supreme Ultimate. The Supreme Ultimate is the Northern Dipper star. Command to forget body and lose form, faintly like ascending to Heaven. Thus the immortal way is near. Immortals call this Great Stillness. On yin and rainy days, you may think of this on your bed, or prepare an altar in a pure place, one zhang square, fenced on all sides several feet high, to practice daily. This is the way of Great Stillness.

---

The way of guarding the One is to always wait for the moon’s first rising, face the moon and bow twice. After bowing, silently recite:

> Great Yin Mysterious Essence,  
> Lady of the Bright Moon,  
> Newly born flowing light,  
> Illuminating my Three Palaces,  
> Spirits and immortals ascend and fly,  
> Roaming high in the eight directions,  
> Wherever I go and wish,  
> All is within fortune.

---

The way of guarding the One always holds the seven Dipper stars as a canopy over the head, the handle pointing forward. Thus, a hundred evils dare not interfere, and harmful qi self-extinguishes. This is the essential secret.

---

Those who guard the One must avoid eating the five pungent spices and all meats, and avoid entering the homes of women in childbirth. On Jia Zi days, hold thoughts; also avoid seeing great drunkards and all foul odors, all to be carefully avoided without doubt. Also avoid holding infants, and keep away from black beasts and insects. Do not share clothing, shoes, or bedding with others while holding the One. Think true, calm the spirit, and call the dao to summon spirits—all seek a separate place. This is not a trivial matter.

---

The later Sage Golden Palace Lord received four manuals: *Three Primes True Unity Scripture*, *Supreme Ultimate Emperor’s True Talisman*, *Five Dipper True Unity Scripture*, and *Great Ultimate Emperor’s Precious Chapters*. Later passed to the immortal Juanzi. Juanzi fished in the river and caught a carp, splitting it open to find a green jade box. Opening it revealed two talismans and two scripture methods. This is the Most High inner hidden method, the supreme path of earthly truth, also enabling court attendance at Supreme Clarity, gazing upon the Supreme Ultimate, flying and roaming the empty caverns, resting in the Kun and Xuan. 

---

According to the Four Extremities Bright Methods and the Living Spirit Talisman, those with earthly true supreme scriptures all have a limited transmission period, sworn oaths to the Three Officials, pledges of silk and blood on the altar, and cutting of contracts before receiving the teachings.

The recipient must fast for one hundred days, or fifty, or thirty, or ten, or seven days. Only those with sincere heart, devoted spirit, and true faith shall be taught. Guarding the Three Primes’ truth, using the two Emperors’ talismans, ascending the Five Dipper’s way—this is the supreme path of earthly truth. The method is transmitted to one person every forty years, and to ten persons every four hundred years, no more. If no suitable person appears, a white script is copied and sealed in secret rocky chambers of the Five Sacred Mountains, with a copy made every forty years and sealed in the Five Mountains. The Five Mountains mean focusing on one mountain, not spreading evenly across all five; the nearest place is chosen. If mountains are unreachable, famous mountains suffice. The Northern Baodu, Western Dizang, Southern Luofu and Dahe, Eastern Tiantai and Kuohuo are such famous mountains. If within forty years ten persons can be taught, teach them; beyond the limit, no further transmission. Those who violate the rules and leak secrets will be taken to the Water Official and suffer the Wind Blade’s torture, and their descendants will perish. The fragile blood oath is received from the Azure Youth Lord as a demonstration for late learners, a perpetual regulation. Those receiving the Three Primes True Unity Scripture must make solemn oaths and pledges. The oath protects the spirit, the pledge strengthens the heart, so no being can violate it, nor Heaven and Earth. Those receiving the supreme method use forty feet of purple ribbon and a bright mirror; those receiving the middle method use forty feet of crimson ribbon and two pairs of rings; those receiving the lower method use white silk matching their age, one foot per year, counted accordingly, and two pairs of gold rings. Scripture masters receive these oath objects, awaiting the exhaustion of forests, marshes, and mountains, to aid travelers in urgent sickness, and must not misuse them for selfish ends. Those who violate and do not comply will die as lower ghosts, suffering the Wind Blade’s torture. Fathers and sons transmitting also make oaths as prescribed. Transmission of this scripture is mutual teaching and friendship—this is the way of Heaven and Man.

---

Those who receive the Great Cavern Guarding One Scripture become masters; those who receive this scripture become disciples. Thus, they honor the root and ultimate, clarify the utmost sincerity of Heaven, and aspire to the place where spirits and numina gather, entrusting ranks as masters and friends. Masters and friends manage the external, the Three Ones mirror the internal, the Emperor delights in the palace, the infant rejoices in the dwelling. Thus the purple chamber excels in the sky, the cinnabar field shines brightly, the Three Elders descend to the chamber, the Three Blossoms rest in the bed. Soon the spirit will ascend the great rosy clouds, trust and aid the empty caverns, body united with wondrous numina, rising to Heaven in broad daylight. Those who violate this way are incomplete; those who leak this prohibition are maimed; those who hear this way live long; those who practice this way are immortals. Can one not be cautious?

---

Those without the predestined immortal bone, mysterious register, or golden jade name cannot hear or see the wondrous way of True Unity. Some from past lives have done good deeds, their merit reaching three hundred, or are compassionate and virtuous, kindness extending even to beasts and birds, or by fate and destiny meet and unite with spirits—such all attain the Three Ones. In ancient times, Zi Jin attained it, riding cranes and clouds; An Qi attained it, revolving among the five stars; Juanzi attained it, ascending to Supreme Clarity; Zhu Shi attained it, flying storms to the northern abyss. This way is wondrous indeed, granting long life.
