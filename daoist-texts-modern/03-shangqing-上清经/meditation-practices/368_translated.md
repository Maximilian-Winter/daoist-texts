## The Most Primordial Heavenly Venerable’s Scripture of Profound and Subtle Mysteries

The Dao speaks:  
To reach the wondrous subtlety of the profound, one must quiet the mind and follow the dao in due time. At the precise moment of midnight on the Spring Equinox, rise and sit facing east. Close your eyes in meditation and preserve within your body the Three Palaces, the Three Ones, the Three Ministers, and your Self—seven persons in all, with yourself at the center. Together, mount the smoke of violet qi and ascend to the Yang Bright Star of the Northern Dipper. This Yang Bright Star is the eastern deity of the Northern Dipper. There, enter the star’s center and sit; swallow the violet qi thirty times, practicing this for a long while. Then you will see the Eastern Primordial Most High Official of the Yang Bright Star. Within the official’s palace is a young lad of azure mystery, who grants you the true radiance. First, you must preserve the great violet qi beneath the Northern Dipper star, as large as a bowstring, pouring straight down before you, then preserve the Three Ones.

The Master Zhou’s formula says:  
Preserve the seven persons under the Dipper’s seven stars, and together ascend the Yang Bright Star in a flying geese formation, with me in the center. The “Dipper star” means the star with the handle covering the head, the ladle’s front pointing forward. Swallow the violet qi thirty times—I preserve the violet qi and swallow it. Also think on the Three Ones and the Three Ministers, swallowing them all at once. After swallowing, again preserve the seven persons riding violet qi, descending from the empty sky back into the Three Palaces. After a long while, silently recite:  

> Three Venerable Supreme Truths,  
> Most High Mysterious Spirits,  
> Yang Bright rules Spring,  
> Ten Thousand Children open the gate.  
> Dan Yuan rules Summer,  
> Vermilion and purple merge as smoke.  
> Yin Essence rules Autumn,  
> Heavenly Might with six arrays.  
> North Pole rules Winter,  
> Ten Thousand Evils blocked and sealed.  
> Five Earths hold Ren,  
> Wu and Ji are Heaven’s gates,  
> All crushed and destroyed,  
> None can resist their might.  
> Refine my seven souls,  
> Harmonize my three spirits,  
> Generate my five organs,  
> Grant me true attainment,  
> Ascend and soar to Upper Clarity,  
> Float among the seven origins,  
> Long life and smooth dwelling,  
> Whistle command to a thousand spirits.  
> Complete.

You may also preserve this in sleep; the four seasonal festivals share this single incantation.

At the Summer Solstice, at midnight, rise and sit facing south. Close your eyes and preserve within your body the Three Palaces, Three Ones, Three Ministers, and your Self—seven persons in all, yourself in the center. Together, mount the smoke of violet qi and ascend to the Dan Yuan Star of the Northern Dipper. The Dan Yuan Star is the southern deity of the Northern Dipper. Enter the star and sit together; swallow the violet qi thirty times, practicing for a long while. Then you will see the Southern Pole Most High Palace of the Dan Yuan Star. Within the palace is the Vermilion Yang Spirit Consort, who grants you the scarlet script and precious writings.

At the Autumn Equinox, at midnight, rise and sit facing west. Close your eyes and preserve within your body the Three Palaces, Three Ones, Three Ministers, and your Self—seven persons in all, yourself in the center. Together, mount the smoke of violet qi and ascend to the Yin Essence Star of the Northern Dipper. The Yin Essence Star is the Northern Dipper’s missing character, lacking over four hundred and seventy characters.*#1* The Eight Sections should be consulted accordingly. The Eight Sections are the precise degrees of the Celestial Pivot, the days when myriad true numinous immortals and spirits gather for courtly feasts.

The Northern Emperor’s natural law, within the count of the months, on days when the three phases of qi align, is also a most auspicious time. It is fitting to establish cultivation and reflection on the dao. In general, I follow the One.

Foreign lands count the first day of the month as the beginning, the second day as the removal, and count by these numbers. Now, without a calendar for the phases, this may be used. The Xiongnu nation counts the first day of the first month as Jia Yin, the new moon on the sixth Jia, cycling again and again. The first month is large, the second large, the third small, the fourth large, the fifth small, the sixth large, the seventh small, the eighth large, the ninth small, the tenth large, the eleventh small, the twelfth large. If one is deep in the wilderness, far and remote, one should also follow this.

At each beginning day, or the first day of the month, at dawn, preserve the Three Ones emerging from your own Three Officials, sitting before you. Then, with your heart, rise and bow twice, as if seeing them in the flesh, and silently recite:  

> Heavenly Venerable Three Emperors,  
> Guard the gate of [name]’s life,  
> Journey through the void,  
> Six qi and mysterious divisions,  
> Nourish my five spirits,  
> Correct my three souls,  
> Five organs self-generate,  
> Long life flying immortal.  
> Complete.

Then preserve the Three Ones returning from the void to the Three Palaces. After a long while, swallow saliva thirty times. Repeat ten times thus; at night you will dream of the Three Ones and the Three Ministers. Or you may dream of white crows, white cranes, white tigers, gold and jade objects—all are transformations and manifestations of the Three Ones. Guard this without fail, and you will see their images, gradually appearing face to face.

---

At each removal day, at midnight, secretly rise and face north. Observe the inner image of the Northern Dipper’s seven stars. See the Three Ones descend from the auxiliary stars and enter your Three Palaces. Then return to bed and meditate quietly, preserving their likeness as if seeing them. Then softly recite:  

> Most High Heavenly Aides,  
> Where the Three Emperors roam,  
> The Three Ministers support the bones,  
> United with the true,  
> Descend into my body,  
> Sit in peace at the origin,  
> Exhale essence and pour into form,  
> Harmonize soul and spirit,  
> Make me a flying immortal,  
> Cloud-walking and roaming the floating realms.  
> Complete.

Swallow saliva twenty-seven times. The month takes only one removal day.

---

At each opening day, at midnight, rise and sit facing east. Remove your cap, or you may also loosen your hair, then comb and tie it well. After the knot is secure, softly call out:  

> Upper Origin Three Truths,  
> The infant in the truth,  
> Scatter hair and open smoke,  
> Connect upward to the Heavenly Terrace,  
> The mud pellet solidifies,  
> Together with Heaven,  
> Make me a flying immortal,  
> Traverse and mingle with the grotto terrace.  
> Complete.

Swallow saliva nineteen times, then don your cap and rest. Carefully preserve the Three Ones and Three Ministers, each settled in their palace. The Emperor and Ministers sit facing each other. Preserve the Three Ones and breathe thirty times into the palace. When preserving yourself, also breathe thirty times. Breathing here means opening the mouth and exhaling. At this time, you may feel a warmth throughout the body—this is the proof of harmonizing spirit and condensing soul. When preserving the One, always close your eyes and inwardly view the spirit palace.

---

The Way of Preserving the One causes the Most High Three Pure Qis to appear within the Three Palaces. The Three Pure are the violet, azure, and scarlet mysterious colored qì, with violet above. Then preserve and guard the Three Ones within, imagining the Northern Pole’s Purple Gate Jade Palace. Arrange the Heavenly Officials in order, thinking that you will sit opposite the Emperor. Whatever you seek or beg, you bow your heart. The Most High is the Upper Clarity; the Emperor of Upper Clarity is supremely noble. The Northern Pole’s Purple Chamber is the Emperor’s chamber. Also preserve your own Three Ones and discuss with the Emperor the dao of flying truth and generation.

---

Whenever facing a sumptuous feast, always correct your heart and preserve the One. Imagine the One first drinking the food and drink, then you may partake. Constantly so, evil qi will retreat and true qi will come forward. After eating and drinking, silently recite:  

> Hundred grains enter the stomach,  
> Merge with spirit and combine qi,  
> Fill and replenish the blood,  
> Corpse and evil vanish and fall away,  
> Long life with Heaven and Earth,  
> Fly ascend the Golden Gate,  
> Command the Six Ding,  
> Spirit children serve and guard.

The method of guarding the One: on Jia Wu, Jia Chen, and Jia Yin days at midnight, sweep and clear the quiet sleeping courtyard. Spread a mat one zhang square, burn incense facing north, and bow twice, or simply bow with your heart. Then gaze up at the Northern Dipper’s seven stars, causing violet qi to emerge from the Dipper and enter your body’s Three Palaces. Facing north, place your hands on your knees, preserve the Three Ones, Three Ministers, and yourself. Together, ride the violet qi and ascend to the Supreme Ultimate. The Supreme Ultimate is a star. Make yourself forget your body and lose your form, as if ascending to Heaven. Thus the immortal dao is near. Immortals call this Great Stillness. On rainy days, you may contemplate this on your bed, or prepare an altar in a quiet place, one zhang square, fenced on all sides with a barrier several feet high. On the appointed day, always cultivate this. This is the Way of Great Stillness.

The Way of Guarding the One: always watch for the moon’s first rising, face the moon and bow twice, then softly recite:  

> Great Yin Mysterious Essence,  
> Lady of the Bright Moon,  
> Newly born flowing light,  
> Illuminate my Three Palaces,  
> Spirits and immortals ascend and fly,  
> Roaming high across the eight directions,  
> Wherever I go and wish,  
> All is within blessing.

---

The Way of Guarding the One: always preserve the Northern Dipper’s ladle star covering the head, the handle pointing forward. This is the essential formula for banishing all evils and extinguishing harmful qi.

---

The one who guards the One must avoid eating the five pungent spices and all meats, and must tread only in the houses of women in childbirth. On Jia Zi days when preserving and reflecting, also avoid seeing drunkards and all foul odors; all these must be shunned carefully and sent away without doubt. Also, do not hold infants; only your own child is permitted. Do not share clothes or shoes, or beds and mats with others—only preserve the One. Think truly, calm your spirit, and call forth numinous beings. All will be found elsewhere; this is not merely about this one matter alone.

Later, the Sage of the Golden Gate Emperor, in ancient times, received the *Three Origins True One Scripture*, the *Supreme Ultimate Emperor’s True Talisman*, the *Five Dipper True One Scripture*, and the *Supreme Ultimate Emperor’s Precious Chapter*—four formulas in all. Later, these were passed to the immortal disciple Juanzi. Juanzi fished in the river and caught a fish; opening it, he found a jade box, inside which were two talismans and two scripture methods. This is the highest Way of the Most High’s inner hidden earthly truth, also allowing courtly feasts in Upper Clarity, roaming the Supreme Ultimate, flying and wandering Kunlun, resting in the mountains of Kunlun.

According to the Four Extremes Bright Methods illuminating the Living Spirit Talisman, all who possess the Earthly True Supreme Scriptures have a fixed transmission period. They swear oaths to the Three Officials, entrust silk and blood at the altar, and sign the leather covenant before receiving the teachings. The recipient fasts for one hundred days, or fifty days, or thirty days, or twenty-one days, or ten days, or seven days. Only those who can teach with pure heart and true faith may be entrusted with preserving the Three Origins’ truth, using the two Emperors’ talismans, and ascending the Five Dipper’s dao. This is the highest earthly true Way. The method allows transmission to one person every forty years, ten persons every four hundred years, no more. If no suitable person appears, one must copy a white silk scroll and seal it, placing it in a secret cave of the Five Sacred Mountains. Every forty years, copy one scroll and seal it in the Five Mountains. The Five Mountains are gathered in one mountain only; no need to distribute evenly among all five. Choose the closest place of residence. If not near the Five Mountains, famous mountains will do. For example, in the north, Baodu; in the west, Difei; in the south, Luofu and Taihe; in the east, Tiantai and Kuohuo—these are all famous mountains. If within four hundred years ten persons appear, they may be taught; beyond the limit, no further transmission is allowed. Violators who leak secrets and disobey the law will be summoned by the Water Official, suffer the test of the Wind Blade, and their descendants will be utterly destroyed. The blood oath covenant is received by the Azure Youth Lord, shown to later disciples as a perpetual regulation. Those receiving the *Three Origins True One Scripture* must swear before a Daoist master, with white silk eighty-seven chi long, two pairs of silver rings; one scroll uses white silk twenty-nine chi, one pair of silver rings only. This is the complete set. Or use three buttons as a substitute for the leather covenant. Those receiving the *Supreme Ultimate Five Dipper True One Scripture* must swear before a scripture master, with purple patterned silk forty chi long, two pairs of gold rings, substituting the blood oath covenant. Those receiving the *Supreme Ultimate True Talisman* must swear before a talisman master, with vermilion silk twenty chi long. Those receiving the *Supreme Ultimate Precious Chapter Talisman* must swear before a scripture and chapter master, with blue-green silk twenty chi long, used when ascending the altar and cutting hair, as a vow unto death. Recipients must await the utmost hardship of forest, marsh, and mountain ridges, and must not recklessly use it for selfish ends. Those who violate and do not comply will be subject to the penalty of cutting and removal, their bodies falling into the Three Springs. Fathers and sons transmit with oath as prescribed. Transmission is always by mutual teaching, to honor the root and clarify the bitter sincerity of Heaven. This is not only applied here, but also to ensure there are further instructions and methods. Those without the innate immortal bone and mysterious register may never hear or see the wondrous Way of the True One.
