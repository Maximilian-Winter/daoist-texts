## Scripture of the Supreme Clarity’s Numinous Treasure: The True Secret of the Cavern Chamber, Upper Scripture

This scripture is also called *The Chronicle of Lord Qingtong*, and *The Supreme Protector’s Jade Scripture*. Immortals cultivate it as the true essence of Supreme Clarity. Long ago, Lord Wei Junhua preserved it and bestowed it upon Lord Xu Yuanyou, who dwelt in the western city’s ramparts and terraces. They pledged by the purple radiance of ten splendid medicines and jade, cutting the starry clouds and the treasured soaring phoenix brocade, to reveal it to Supreme Clarity. For a hundred years it passed among perfected beings, not revealing its text to the common folk, but manifesting its truth openly in Heaven.

The Jade Protector King Qingtong, the Dao Lord, named Longguang Xuan, styled Youwu, was born of the true unity of wood essence and azure breath, flowing light with nine transformations on the mountain of Xuannuo in the Eastern Jade Na Kingdom. The verdant splendor contained spirit, flowing pearls guarded by chivalrous knights. Nine thousand cycles passed, fragrant blossoms spread, bright medicines fell, jade instruments nine feet tall, inner observation of the Ten Directions, heavenly maidens holding robes, the Jade Emperor bowing his head, chanting voices clear and penetrating, forests and valleys trembling in awe. The Heavenly Treasure Immortal King bestowed upon the Supreme Primal True One one hundred and fifty-five secret registers, every truth fully known. Transforming the myriad beings’ gates to open the Buddhist cycle, the root of the dao is declared:

“The Ultimate Dao is the Cavern Void.  
The root of transformation is awakened intention.  
Heaven and Earth speak not, yet show signs.  
All myriad creatures and kinds bear images.  
Thunder, wind, clouds, and vapor respond with feeling.  
Why so? Because awakened intention obtains it;  
All penetrate the cavern void and transform.  
Transformation is constant. Change is its name.  
All phenomena of Heaven and Earth arise from the cavern void,  
The cavern void is non-being and being.  
Transformation, image, awakened intention—all emerge from the cavern chamber.  
The cavern chamber has ‘having’ without ‘being’; the cavern void is ‘being’ without ‘having.’  
The chamber has ‘having,’ things do not depend on people.  
Heaven’s craft surpasses human sight and grasp of intention.  
Humans obtain by intention.  
To obtain is to take.  
Heaven reveals to humans by intention, giving to them.  
What is given and united is Dao, virtue, and primordial qi mixed as one,  
Able to do all things, able to see all things.  
Birth and death, coming and going, myriad changes and disappearances,  
All lie within awakened intention.  
Heaven and Earth are my parents, no difference between them.  
The end and beginning, being and non-being, do not go beyond this.  
Following creation, responding accordingly, manifesting in the subtle.  
The subtle is the Supreme Clarity’s Numinous Treasure Cavern Chamber True Secret.  
True is truly this.  
Secret is secret in this.  
One who obtains this is a Most High Immortal.”

The Jade Protector Dao Lord, at that time, his body flowed with jade light, shining endlessly. He first donned a lofty crown, pearls and treasures reflecting his form, draped in imperial rosy clouds. Heaven announced auspicious signs, cinnabar mushrooms presented fragrance. Having attained the true Dao, he retired from fasting to report to the Jade Sovereign of the Golden Palace, the Later Sage of Truth, saying:  
“Great indeed, profound to the utmost, to generate, extend, and widely bestow, to long nourish the source of transformation—this is the Jade Treasure. The infant guards the feminine, abundant grace without form, thus named Qingtong.”  

The Jade Sovereign of the Golden Palace told Qingtong:  
“Your body has jade bones, your heart contains nine sovereigns,  
Sun windows high and low, purple will beneath the jaw,  
Emerald pupils deeply reflecting—naturally you should ascend to the high truth.  
The secret of the Ultimate Dao is now revealed,  
And one form dwells in heavenly harmony,  
Also must be refined coldly, to unite being and non-being, ascending to the Mysterious Palace.”  

Lord Qingtong retired to the secluded forest, taking small steps with elbows bent, humbly requesting to investigate thoroughly. Then he was told:  
“You shall dwell in leisure, close your eyes and practice vision,  
Let it be as if your eyes are open, open and close your eyes,  
Do not let seeing go to seeing.  
Hold this for one hundred days, at night gaze until light connects.  
Then again gather heavenly light into the Mysterious Mirror,  
Meditate on your body containing crystal water,  
Look upward at the true pole below, the three truths in the cavern chamber’s square inch.  
After one hundred days you shall hear thunder like Heaven shaking,  
Within the square inch, it can be as large as a mat.  
One hundred and eighty days, as a great hall.  
Three hundred days, as a government palace.  
One thousand days, equal to Heaven and Earth.  
Not by thought thinking, not by mind minding,  
Not by awareness aware, not by intention intending,  
Only the essence connects, all phenomena complete.  
What awakened intention obtained before is all within.  
The numinous way manifests itself, manifest yet obscure,  
Vast and distant from the world.  
Within the cavern chamber you shall see your boundless, endless creation,  
You suddenly ascend Heaven, sit peacefully in the cavern chamber,  
Holding the scripture facing south,  
The Yellow and the Old then nourish you with numinous marvels.”

Lord Qingtong practiced thus for one thousand days, his body adorned with falling pearls, riding phoenixes and clouds, journeying to the Sun Palace. Within the sun, red qi condensed essence, coiling and turning a thousand times. The sun’s root spirit formed the jade’s quintessence, named Yuyi Chizhang Dragon Pattern. Qingtong bowed to it, gathering the sun’s essence.

## The Illuminating Jade Pure Text of the Most High

Lord Qingtong said:  
“Drinking the sun’s cinnabar, heavy rings shining bright,  
Drawing in and inhaling the utmost essence,  
Ascending to the moon’s midst, yellow vapor blending with the expanse,  
Secretly gathering golden radiance, containing emptiness to nourish brightness,  
Deeply tranquil is its spirit, thus called ‘Binding the Luminous Yellow Script with Tiger Pattern.’”

Lord Qingtong gazed at the emptiness of the Mysterious Pole,  
Communing with the shining spirits,  
Sun and moon conjoin qi, refining cold true form.  
Heaven and Earth receive its subtlety,  
Divine brightness emerges from its chamber,  
Turning eyes to the Nine Heavens, flying swiftly to the Eight Directions,  
Golden truth seizes qi, jade clouds double their light.  
Light penetrates one form, within seeing the Three Palaces,  
The Three Palaces combine and transform, the Twenty-Seven Palaces,  
Lofty golden courts, seated ranks of jade infants.

The Nine Officers of the Mud Pellet, each palace named,  
Below connected to the Long Tower, the Twelve Jade Cities.

The Middle Elixir Field has Nine Palaces.  
The two breasts’ high places are flat hollows, guarding the paired fields of the inch.  
On the left is the Great God named Mingning, styled Shuping,  
On the right is the Great God named Zhengjing, styled Zizhang,  
Wearing red embroidered robes, holding a fire bell, illuminating the four directions.  
The tower ring is the perfected person’s palace, inside is Jade Pure Perfected One, named Tianyu, styled Xuantong, wearing azure cloud robes, holding a jade mirror.  
The lungs are the Bright Pure Palace, with the Pure Splendor Dao Lord named Cheng, styled Yuxu, wearing flying cloud robes, sitting on a golden bed, holding a great pearl like a chicken’s egg.  
The heart is the Red Origin Palace, inside is Jade True, named Longjing, styled Xishen, wearing red brocade jade robes, mouth holding the sun.  
The spleen is the Yellow Chamber Palace, inside is the Central Jade Maiden, named Shesheng, styled Bohun, wearing purple rosy robes, holding a jade ruler.  
The liver is the Orchid Spirit Palace, inside is Wood Duke, named Changjing, styled Mengxian, wearing blue sky robes, holding the Jade Emperor’s script, sitting on a patterned dragon.  
The gallbladder is the Supreme True Palace, inside is the Mysterious Light Youth, named Yanwei Yu, styled Immortal Soul Son, wearing purple cloud robes, holding a sword.  
The left kidney is the Jade Emperor Palace, inside is Mysterious Noble Lord, named Tongzhen, styled Youfu, wearing green cloud robes, holding a fire jade.  
The right kidney is the Jade Maiden Palace, inside is Upright True Youth, named Xugen, styled Zhengxian, wearing yellow jade robes, palms joined sitting opposite.  
The wrapped end of the intestines is the Supreme Constant Palace, inside is the Lofty Lord, named Dongying, styled Hanhua, wearing azure cloud robes, holding a staff.  
The nine palaces above, the spirits like infants, sit among purple clouds, governing the square inch within.

The Lower Elixir Field has Nine Officers.  
Beside the navel, two hollows high and sunken guard the paired fields.  
Inside are two great gods: left is Biaoyuan, styled Qi Wang; right is Liming, styled Jingqing, wearing purple embroidered robes, holding a fire torch, illuminating the nine abysses, guarding and calming life’s brightness.  
One inch inward is the Bright Hall, with Peach Health Great God, named Yuwei, styled Shangming, wearing red brocade robes, sitting on a golden bed.  
Two inches is the Cavern Chamber, with Mysterious Highest Emperor Lord, named Wuyou, styled Mingzhen, wearing dark brocade robes, holding keys.  
Three inches is the Elixir Field Palace, with Life Palace Great God, named Wuguang, styled Qinyuan, wearing red gauze robes, holding a jade bell.  
Four inches is the Flowing Pearl Palace, with Weak Water Great God, named Jiyuan, styled Tianying, wearing white gauze robes.  
Five inches is the Purple Pole Palace, with Great Unity Great God, named Baoling, styled Qingsheng, wearing single brocade robes.  
One inch above is the Cavern Origin Palace, with Southern Upper Jade Consort, named Su, styled Juechang, wearing blue cloud robes.  
Two inches above is the Cavern Court Palace, with Azure Origin Highest Emperor, named Dahuang, styled Zengzi, wearing yellow embroidered robes.  
Three inches above is the Cavern Yang Palace, with Sun Mysterious Great Lord, named Yuming, styled Jiansheng, wearing dark brocade robes.  
Four inches above is the Cavern True Official, with Emperor One Great God, named Bogao, styled Duyuan, wearing vermilion robes, sitting upright, facing outward.  
The nine palaces of the lower elixir field also each measure a square inch, spirits shaped like infants, sitting among yellow clouds.

Lord Qingtong’s cavern vision saw the Twenty-Seven Truths, arrayed the jade infant, secretly forming the lotus chamber, reversing spirit and ignorance, form united with Supreme Mystery, Dao and virtue dwelling, united with Heaven. He chanted:

“Row upon row, palace upon palace,  
Jade officials of nine cities,  
Three officials arrayed,  
Red and blue arranged finely,  
Circulating through the hundred gates,  
Subduing and refining the corpse form,  
Wondrously uniting qi,  
Transforming to give birth to brightness,  
Serving and commanding the great authority,  
Ascending on high to Jade Pure.”

The Dao is complete with numinous treasures,  
Profoundly leading true secrets,  
Virtue pervades all beings,  
The Jade Emperor smiles,  
His body adorned with dragon chariots,  
Circling through myriad heavens,  
Looking down on the Three Stars,  
Sitting knowing countless ages,  
Composing one chapter of scripture,  
Engraved atop the Eastern Splendor Jade Palace Mysterious Sanctuary,  
To transmit the golden name, the azure script, and jade slips,  
To the high perfected ones.

## Lord Qingtong and Jade Protector King’s Dao Scripture

“Nine openings of the dragon embryo first,  
Embryo subtlety beyond beginning,  
Jade emptiness flowing eternally,  
True intention treasures gathering,  
Chivalrous sun of Eastern Mulberry glow,  
Swallowing and inhaling from the Purple Palace,  
Three origins, ultimate primordial beginning,  
Supreme virtue, principle, highest mystery,  
Stirred but faintly,  
Wondrous awakening, Dao is natural,  
Peach Health and Stellar Pivot father,  
Life essence ascending the Mud Pellet,  
Vermilion pearls nurturing cloud roots,  
Heavenly radiance descending into abyss,  
True spirits unite mother essence,  
Trickling gentle flowing springs,  
Silently commanding Lord Bo Yu,  
Morning glow rising condensing mist,  
Illuminating the hidden Jade Duke,  
Concealed and settled in the chamber,  
Golden radiance hiding mushroom blossoms,  
Supreme Emperor bows on jade steps,  
Mixed transformation, true constant name,  
Wisdom and grace command nine returns,  
Countless ages not too many,  
Unchanging flying spirit cinnabar,  
Great Dao attains eternal existence,  
Eternal existence opens and closes between.”

Lord Qingtong’s Jade Scripture is a solemn oath,  
The pivot of the Dao’s profound axis.  
Now resting in the green forest,  
Gathering and correcting the Supreme True,  
Regulating and commanding numinous qi,  
Nurturing life’s primal origins,  
Numinous treasure true secret,  
Prior to Heaven and Earth.  
Those who know this text,  
Their bodies gain immortals,  
Knowing its precious secret,  
Ascending the ancestral mystery,  
High serving the imperial throne,  
Living countless years without end.
