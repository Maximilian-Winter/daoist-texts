## The Jade Scripture of the Supreme Clarity’s Numinous Youth United in Inner Transformation

The Jade Guardian King, Azure Youth Dao Lord, first approached the realm of the Dao, floating through the celestial cinnabar groves, descending to gaze upon the cavernous sea. He drew in the essence of flavors and flowing spirits, weaving and nurturing the radiant youth within. Ten thousand li from the solar palace, suddenly the nine gates opened wide; cinnabar light mingled with violet clouds, smoke and vapor merged in clarity. The Five Emperors applauded gently, the divine crow pecked at the brightness; heart and eyes fixed in attention, essence and soul intertwined. Supreme Harmony arose spontaneously; the golden body flowed in serene accord.

The Jade Guardian Azure Youth Dao Lord, in moments of leisure, saluted and bowed, reaching the utmost void to birth spirit. He peacefully slumbered in the mysterious palace, where the Three Primes and Nine Beginnings watched attentively without entering the courtyard. Suddenly, a divine figure appeared, piercing clouds and bearing moonlight, adorned with heavenly stars. The jade spirit was elegant and sharp; blue bones soft and luminous. He spoke to the Azure Youth:

“You have long absorbed the sun’s essence, seated to receive the moon’s liquid. You shall attain heavenly brilliance, nourishing your golden form. Thus, the twin lights divide their radiance, illuminating your being. Within your cinnabar field grows the ethereal mushroom of essence, jade blossoms blooming profusely. I reveal to you the essential secret, so the people may know the true unity: by obtaining the numinous youth, one may attain the immortal body.

“The numinous youth is the flourishing sprout of azure yang. The true youth is the son of the Azure Youth’s single strand. Preserved within your body, when you think of him, he comes. When he comes, you roam together, blending and transforming. Calling him follows order; the principle must not be rash.

“Your body’s vital breath transmits the water essence—this is the will. The will is earth, born of fire. Earth transmits fire’s essence as spirit. Spirit and breath accumulate, forming bones. The essence of bones is the pupil within your eyes. The frame of the eyes is the mysterious window of your body. The twin pearls shining brightly are your spirit mirrors, connecting above to the sun and moon’s light, pouring below into your hidden ox. These elements are why the numinous youth comes.

“The numinous youth is a spiritual being; when he comes, you yourself know it. On the appointed day, watch carefully: when he comes, he moves in his place. Something settles within your body. To invoke him, face the sun and offer prayers. First, close your eyes and you will see red vapor filling the space before you. Then, closing your eyes again, the red color intensifies, rising in waves.

“Now tightly close your eyes, and with the essence of your sight pierce through skin and texture. You will see red and purple forming precious hues, within which hundred-flower patterns whirl like a spinning chariot. Then, lead it with your nose, threading from beneath your nape, through the spine, piercing the kidneys, reaching the heels, and returning through the cinnabar field. The colors appear as before.

“Heartfully recite:

‘Spirit summons, breath connects, within and without imagined,  
Spirit and breath closely meet, sun’s crystal flows like smoke,  
Washing my old marrow, extending ease to birth truth,  
Numinous youth, azure yang, flourishing sprout vigorously,  
Opening the yin’s shadow, wraiths and goblins vanish,  
Sun and moon blend their light, nourishing my sacred form,  
Ascending above to Jade Guardian, minister to the ancient sages.’”

The moon follows the same method, for at its appointed hour it alone dwells in slumber. Watch with your heart; something will come to enter from that place. The left foot corresponds to the Beginning of Spring, days of Wu Yin and Ji Chou; the left chest corresponds to the Spring Equinox, day of Yi Mao; the left hand corresponds to the Beginning of Summer, days of Wu Chen and Ji Si; the chest and throat correspond to the Summer Solstice, day of Bing Wu; the right hand corresponds to the Beginning of Autumn, days of Wu Shen and Ji Wei; the right chest corresponds to the Autumn Equinox, day of Xin You; the right foot corresponds to the Beginning of Winter, days of Wu Xu and Ji Hai; below the waist and hips corresponds to the Winter Solstice, day of Ren Zi.

On these days and hours, watch carefully and draw inward to the cinnabar field to see what is gained. It is not necessary for all to reach their places, but the numinous youth naturally unites with the year’s Jia and roams within the body as one. The two lights mingle and shine; morning by morning this is done. Sitting at night, suddenly a flying light comes before you; you look and it vanishes. Over time, you may fix your gaze and see within the light a form fully present—that is the shape of your numinous youth. The cinnabar field also holds this form. Practicing this is the true path of Supreme Clarity, not to be revealed to lesser learners.

The Azure Youth Dao Lord practices his way, issuing the secret formula to unlock the jade palace of blossoming flowers, entrusting it to the perfected ones, following the clear methods.

Thus transmitted by the Eastern Flower Guardian of Morning, Mysterious Yellow Dao Lord, teacher of the Way.
