## Chronicle of the Later Sage Dao Lord of Shangqing

By Fang Zhu, Eastern Palace Azure Youth Lord, transmitted to disciple Wang Yuanyou

The Later Sage Emperor Lord Li Hongyuan of the Golden Pavilion of Shangqing—his given name was Xianshui, styled Ziguan, also called Shanyuan—was born of the lineage of the Earth Sovereign, a man of the Mysterious Emperor’s era. In the seventh year of the Shanghe era, the year of Bingzi, on the day of direct conjunction in the third month, he was born beneath the Heavenly Steel Mountain of the Northern Country, in the Li family. His mother first dreamed of dark clouds entwined with sun and moon, and thus conceived him. When bathing him, a host of dragons spat water into the basin.

At five years old, he delighted in the dao and loved the true; he spoke and chanted complete compositions, often gazing upward at the sun with joy, smiling; facing the moon, he sighed and intoned, observing the radiant brilliance of yang qi, and perceiving the waning and decline of the yin path. Thereupon, he gathered his soul and refined his spirit, guarded the precious fetus spirit, recorded the essence and stilled the blood, consolidated the fluids and solidified the sinews. He then studied swallowing light and drinking mist, chewing on flying roots.

By twenty years, he possessed golden bearing and jade-like visage. He abandoned home and kin, transcended the dust of the near and far, secluded himself in a chamber of long fasting, wandering famed mountains. Alone he held the talisman of the Spirit Platform, the mysterious illumination of yielding transformation; he grasped the Three Qi and embraced transformation, plunged into the pivot of spirit to align with the true, his ambition soaring high in emptiness, his sincerity reaching utmost subtlety. His demeanor was serene and inspired, his secret purpose vast and tranquil, his transcendent principle rare and lofty, profound and grand in stillness.

He settled his heart beyond the celestial vistas, restrained his soul to return within the Scarlet Court; he governed his spirit and made the azure and dark jointly guard; he nurtured qi within the chamber of cinnabar and essence. Thus the spirit did not dissipate, the numinous did not scatter; internal virtue was perfectly full, external encumbrances far resolved; he screened the immortals and spirits from the earthly realm, sought the Supreme Truth in the Purple Pavilion.

At this juncture, his essence touched the Great Void, his heart communicated with the divine dawn. He thus brought down the Heavenly Emperor’s teaching, flowing light gathered and was bestowed upon him: the Great Ritual of Yu Yi, the Grand Cave True Scripture; granted him the curved morning flying canopy; drank the circling water jade essence; gifted the white feather and mysterious wing to ascend the eight directions. Receiving this mandate, he withdrew to fasting and enacted the practice.

He recited the scripture in twenty-four matters, diligently longing for the supreme assembly, never weary in thought. Occasionally, he would immerse himself in subtle profundities, condensing and shifting, forgetting return; probing mechanisms to grasp the root, then weighing and taking sole responsibility; studying scripture and chanting mysteries, clarifying external things; his spirit dwelling in the nine distant realms, observing the state of cessation and forgetfulness.

When the lord’s lofty resonance opened the appointed time, fine encumbrances dissolved; he bowed in harmony to all companions, competed and reformed the divine borders, severed stagnations and dispersed doubts. The profound principle expanded beyond measure; the allied sects daily drew from its clear waves, yet could not fathom the source and origin of the heavenly abyss.

Opening wide the void within, the numinous primordial essence inwardly reflected, there came the Purple Tenuity Supreme True Heavenly Emperor, the Jade Pure Lord, dispatching the Eight Scenes of Jade to welcome the Sage Lord, to ascend the Shangqing Palace. He bestowed the Ruigang Pill, the Jade Phoenix Seal, the Golden Truth, the Jade Radiance; gave the talisman of the Divine Tiger and the flying feathers; the vermilion brocade dragon skirt, the azure robe and tiger belt, waist adorned with radiant clouds and sun-moon symbols; crowned with the round-form divine diadem; received the scroll naming him Later Sage Emperor Lord of the Golden Pavilion of Shangqing.

Ascending Shangqing, residing midstream in the Supreme Ultimate Office, governing the Ten Heavens below; enfeoffed to command the myriad peoples, and all the gods of the heavens, rivers, seas, immortals, and earthly sources; inspecting the hidden roots within the dark and secluded caverns; managing the profound distribution of qi, spreading clouds and stirring the ferry; soaring and glancing with slight movements; guiding the turtle mountain carriage; penetrating the obscure and illuminating the hidden—nothing escapes his grasp.

When the Sage Lord journeys forth, the jade wheels and resplendent carriage, the azure ranks of mysterious dragons, three streams of flowing rosy clouds, moon essence exhaling fragrance, flying sounds circling the sun, streaming lightning brandishing blades, rushing serpents striking swords, long fangs clashing bells, splendid light intermingling and blazing, three candles joining in brightness—at the front, a whistle and nine phoenixes sing in harmony; behind, a blowing and eight luan birds chorus together; the Divine Tiger howls upward, the flying dragon bows and roars; the heavenly scales play their banners and canopies; a hundred sounds issue forth in the empty court; the numinous consort chants grass hymns; the immortal guests open the path; the divine maiden waves purple bindings to stir the qi; the jade youth moves the sun’s radiance to repel dusk; long songs form cloud arrays, no day nor night.

At that time, heavenly light was dim and distant, flowing beyond the eight outer directions—truly the magnificent spectacle of the Supreme Ultimate, the High Emperor of Shangqing. Thus he is exalted in Shangqing because of his divine height and spiritual void; thus he dwells midstream in the Supreme Ultimate because he gathers all the true beings who attend the flying immortals; thus he governs below in the Ten Heavens because he is enfeoffed to command the myriad peoples; thus he inspects within the cavern heavens because nothing below escapes his concern.

For only the two qi separate and unite, the principle of things has its appointed time; the three ways wax and wane, arising and departing according to fate; when the appointed time arrives, one follows it and adapts; the cycle has come, one approaches and soothes it.

In the Tang Cheng era, spanning forty-six Dinghai years, before and after, in the midst was the era of the black beast; the nation’s fortune began to wane; east and west contended for supremacy; to support the weak lord, who bore the name of the Nine-One Strategist. Later, in the era of Haoguang and after Changyuan, in the year of Jiashen, before and after, good people were born; the wicked were removed; pestilence and flood overwhelmed above; war and fire encircled below; evil was utterly destroyed; the fierce all perished. The good cultivated the dao in seclusion; the virtuous ascended mountains; the turbid flowed and surged; they controlled the whale abyss, all were distinguished.

On the sixth day of the third month in the year of Renchen, the Sage Lord descended, illuminating the myriad peoples. At that time, the Sage Lord emerged from Qingcheng’s Western Mountain, passed through Longnan and Yunbei, observed beyond the Dragon Candle, westward turned at the Nine Streams Pass, eastward to the Fulin Morning Descent, southward gazed at the Zhu Mountain clouds; riding the three-colored flying carriage, accompanied by tiger chariots and myriad dragons, heavenly light shone in total, divine mirror observed the Three Stars.

There he exterminated the wicked, preserved the merciful in water and fire; those who sowed the people’s learning became immortal envoys; those who attained the dao became immortal officials. If one can refine the chamber at the Upper Origin, cultivate the Nine Truths with utmost diligence, step through the hidden writings of the Seven Spirits, exhaust the use of the Eight Elements with sincerity, having crossed the Three Calamities unharmed, and must observe renewal at Great Peace, then one is granted the immortal official’s scroll, the divine and true long life.

Yet this mysterious text and numinous art are hidden within the Golden Pavilion of Shangqing Palace; few have seen its chapters. The divine and true descend to teach, thrice transmitted within seven hundred years. Those who receive it need not be wise or foolish; with focused heart and practice, all attain flying immortality. However, those who bear the mysterious record of immortal bones, jade named Fang Zhu, are the ones who truly obtain it. Without this sign, one will never encounter this text, even if among millions some mistakenly see it; for it is transmitted by fate through relay posts, granted with cause and effect, passing through gates to become numinous envoys, thus allowing that person to receive and be entrusted.

Merely possessing it without practice is the dark teaching’s way. Those who seek immortality should widely travel famous mountains, kneel and pray to the heavenly spirits, seek out this hidden formula, hoping to obtain the treasured secret and ascend the ranks of immortal officials. Then the Sage Lord will again consider their rough and subtle merits, promote them to supplement officials, some ranked as Immortal Elders, others appointed as lords, assisting the sacred teaching among the people, managing qi and spreading virtue, some enfeoffed over a city, entrusted with governance of a state.

If one reveres the Yu Yi to summon the sun, applies the Jie Lin to capture the moon, chants the supreme scripture of the Great Cave, the seven transformations of the turning book, consults the true writings of the Golden Pavilion, bears the great talisman of the Divine Tiger, enacts the Eight Ways to restrain spirits, opens the Purple Script to startle the floating, recites the Golden Root to endure long, sets the Nine Reds to seal the mound, commands the Qu Su to summon ghosts, employs the Purple Du to illuminate the origin, drinks the Five Phases to call the soul, draws upon the Lang Jie without ceasing, tests the scripture’s sharpness without doubt, walks through fire and war without fear—such are appointed as Left and Right Immortal Dukes and Ministers, or as ministers and prime immortals overseeing the imperial immortal lords.

Therefore, the Sage Lord follows the tiger chariot and myriad dragons to observe all immortals, granting according to talent. Though the Sage Lord is enfeoffed over the myriad peoples, he looks down upon ten thousand lives; thus he freely roams the Golden Pavilion, the palaces of Shangqing, dwells in the Great Void, wanders the Five Cities, inspects and illuminates the Ten Heavens, and peace prevails in all directions.

Those who witness this peace are sometimes kind-hearted and benevolent, simply guarding goodness; sometimes they study the dao and believe in immortals, teachable men; sometimes numinous persons impart scriptures, guarding the refined precious fetus; sometimes those who attain the dao and immortality, men of sincere spirit; sometimes the mysterious registers record names, seven generations of virtue, blessings extending to descendants destined to be immortals; sometimes born with azure bones, communicating with spirits and connecting to truth; sometimes possessing great and tranquil talent, heavenly nature pure and noble.

The ranks of immortals number in the hundreds. The Sage Lord assigns offices according to talent, making them great and small lords, each with rank, to govern and nurture the people. The lords annually present themselves at Shangqing to meet the Sage Lord and receive instructions. The Sage Lord descends every five years to tour, visiting lords to inspect the people and hear immortal governance.

The Sage Lord’s cultivation was arduous; he endured hardship, inheriting his master’s tribulations, braving hunger and cold, treading water and fire’s harshness; he inscribed private thoughts on his five kin, passed through the Heavenly Emperor’s great trials, all with firm heart and upright duty, death and life assured, ten thousand evils could not violate his spirit, a thousand demons could not confuse his truth. Thus his sincerity was profound and clear, spirit and numinous responded in harmony; hence the Supreme Emperor gave the farewell instructions, the Heavenly Venerable bestowed the dao.

One might say his clarity and lingering resonance, the mysterious gate opened wide, lofty model and exquisite wonder, thorough inspection standing alone, secret passes and myriad paths, heavenly principle emerging all around—no mere simple letters or brush strokes can fully convey. This is but a thousandth part roughly written, briefly listing signs to transmit the essence fitting the immortal’s child.

Those who see it, the mysterious record names it, submitting it to Shangqing, attaining rank as immortal ministers. If one can carry out the true affairs of the Golden Pavilion, be appointed minister, attended by ten jade youths, and ten jade maidens serve the Golden Pavilion’s purple script. Whenever reading, chanting, or practicing, one should respectfully bow and revere, burning incense before the text’s sides. Neglecting the numinous record makes one a lower ghost, the Three Ancestors will investigate.

The jade youths and maidens report upward any transgressions, hearing sincerity, good and evil; nothing escapes their recording. Fang Zhu, steward of the palace, Azure Youth Lord, composed this Chronicle of the Later Sage Dao Lord, presenting it to the Sage Lord, transmitting to Azure Youth disciple Wang Yuanyou, to show those whose bones correspond to immortals. Twice in a hundred years, thrice in seven hundred years, it is heard and taught to those who will come to attain immortality through the dao.

The Sage Lord said: “Those who obtain my Chronicle are all recorded as mysterious named immortal talents, their texts fixed; or inscribed on golden and jade tablets, destined to be immortals. If one has this Chronicle but only reveres the treasured secret without other cultivation, they are granted white-day corpse liberation. If one has it but then does not uphold dao and virtue, truly sinks into vulgarity, nature reversed and will changed, such followers are wandering low talents, not of fragrant bone. Even having my Chronicle, they are named underground lords to dispel their turbid nature and cleanse their filthy spirits.

From here, one must gradually advance in rank, awakening from the great confusion of dreams. Children, be diligent and cautious; do not leak it to unbelieving corpses. Wearing my Chronicle, entering calamities of pestilence, flood, fire, and war, among mountain and forest spirits, thousands of evils and myriad disasters, none can harm you. Those who see you will all be joyful; the text has jade youths attending, covering your body’s death.

Evil men with evil hearts who recklessly harm you, I will cause the mountain and river spirits to strike their fate. Do not say the dao is vast and the numinous mirror uncertain; I gaze from above the Great Void, within the mysterious emptiness, as clearly as eyes behold nose and ears. If you do not believe, try once, and see if you dare violate my prohibitions and oaths; watch how I can probe the unspoken heart, the internal response of calamity and blessing.

Those who receive the text are bound by oath and alliance, a trust not to leak. I dispatch below teachings to bones and fate, and to those who sincerely study the dao and guard sincerity, sending Ma Ming, Zhang Ling, Yin Sheng, Wang Bao, Mo Di, Sima Jizhu, and the Seven True Men of the Dongtai Qingxu Heaven, the Eight Elder Sages—twenty-four in all, some named, some hidden, changing names and characters, truly hard to distinguish. You but need a sincere heart, diligent day and night, and you will surely see these persons; after seeing them, their true names and surnames will also be told to you.”

The Later Sage Lord commanded Lord Wang to oversee the twenty-four True Men, to decide the teaching’s merits. The twenty-four True Men all serve under Fang Zhu Azure Youth, who instructs the disciples under Lord Wang. Lord Wang first reports those who can succeed to the twenty-four True Men; then the True Men accept the matter and teach. The *Chronicle of the Sage Lord* is entrusted only to Lord Wang, to select those worthy to teach; not all True Men fully transmit it.

To know the names of the twenty-four True Men, see the end of our *Qing Yao Zhong Wen Jing*; there are the fixed persons, their taught scriptures, talismans, divine formulas, and chapters listed above the scripture: *Yu Yi Jie Lin*, *Great Cave Mysterious Scripture*, *Shangqing Golden Pavilion Spiritual Text Purple Script*, *Eight Element True Scripture*, *Supreme Hidden Scripture Nine Truth Middle Scripture*, *Huang Lao Eight Way Secret Words*, *Great Elixir Ten Formulas*, *Jade Character Chamber*. The teachings of this scripture are all for the ranks of Left and Right Immortal Dukes and Ministers, Left and Right Ministers and Prime Officers.

The remaining texts—*Nine Elixir Transformations*, *Great Pure Supreme Scripture*, *Huang Su Dao Essence*, *Azure Register Heavenly Pass*—these teachings are for the ranks of True Men, overseeing the True Palace and supervising, enfeoffed as immortal state lords and marquises, each with order and rank, recorded in Fang Zhu’s palace white slips and azure registers, fully detailing their sequence.

The Later Sage Lord Peng, named Guangyuan, also called Xuanxu, styled Dazhuang, also Zhengyang, Peng also known as Li, or called Pengxian Li, cultivated the dao. Born in the era of the Human Sovereign, he held the position of Supreme Left True Protector Sovereign Lord of Taiwei, and was to receive the mandate to govern the myriad peoples, as Grand Tutor Li, managing the Taiwei Northern Pond Palace’s Spiritual Upper Radiance Platform. Peng Lord changes his name every two thousand five hundred years, wandering the Great Void, traveling the Eight Darknesses, ascending to the Unsurpassed, descending to the Bottomless; few true officials have ever seen his radiant face. Yet his original surname and true name are fixed, fully listed in Fang Zhu’s palace white slips and azure registers.

The Later Sage Lord Li, Supreme Minister of Fang Zhu Palace Azure Youth Lord  
The Later Sage Lord Li, Supreme Protector of the Great Elixir Palace, Southern Pole Prime Lord  
The Later Sage Lord Li, Supreme Tutor of White Mountain Palace, Great Element True Lord  
The Later Sage Lord Li, Supreme Governor of Western City Palace, Chief True Lord

These four right-side great ministers, along with the remaining three hundred and sixty ministers, immortal officials, and ministers, are all listed in the white slips and azure registers; their surnames and names are no longer recorded in detail.

Azure Youth Lord said: “Those with bone records are fond of immortality; those fond of immortality all have immortal aspirations. Those with immortal aspirations may waver or be steadfast; wavering means the good merit of ancestors is insufficient; steadfast means the mysterious record and predestined fate are fixed. Some love immortality but are not devoted, also due to incomplete worldly virtue.

Generally, the Heavenly Register manifests in the Mysterious Palace, diagnosing qi and climate in the body’s form; the recorded characters appear in the Supreme Ultimate, rectifying heart and spirit in the cinnabar chamber. If born with Golden Pavilion jade name, their eyes have sunlight, blue teeth and white blood; such a person is benevolent and delights in immortality, bright and outstanding.

If Shangqing has golden books and jade registers, then their will is set against the River Chief, with a reclining bone in the chest; such a person is respectful and harmonious, humble to others, with virtue extending to insects. If the Supreme Ultimate Palace has cinnabar slips and azure texts, their hands have layered characters of ‘people’ and ‘inverted great’; such a person is secretive and fond of truth, pure and empty yet tolerant of faults.

If Fang Zhu has mysterious white and purple names, their eyes have purple light within the four boundaries, illuminating their body; such a person cultivates deeply and subtly, pure and flourishing, avoiding filth. If Shangqing has jade registers and scarlet names, their voice has jade tones and metal echoes, mouth square and eyes round; such a person widely bestows love, regards others as wounded.

If Great Element has jade slips and golden names, their white will appears in the abdomen, purple qi in the mouth; such a person is kind and spiritually connected, quietly benevolent and humble. If Southern Pole has cinnabar texts and purple registers, their head produces five qi, connecting to the clouds of the multi-storied tower; such a person is harmonious and kind, loving the poor, relieving disasters and aiding the needy.

If the Dipper has mysterious jade green registers, their heart has nine orifices, lungs bear brocade patterns, under the chin a jade pellet, eyes have green veins, eyebrows and corners bear thousands of orderly lines like city walls; bald temples reveal spots, bright halls are flat and white, thousands of lines form the ferry of true connection, broad pellets are the dwelling of receiving spirit; such a person is kind to the poor and lowly, benevolent even to beasts.

If the Mysterious Palace Upper Origin has blue, gold, and red writings, their cinnabar heart has purple orifices, yellow flowers encircle the stomach, fragrant breath in the mouth, many teeth with jade fluids; such a person delights in watching the sun and moon’s flowing clouds, loves the light and images of stars, pure in nature, bones strong, sincere and probing mysteries.

If the Mysterious Capital Cinnabar Terrace has white jade and gold characters, their blue liver and purple network, granary and kidney have silk patterns, mysterious chest overflows essence, form flourishing and spirit pure, body fragrant and soft, blood clear and qi radiant; such a person indulges in preserving mystery and distance, tastes the spiritual essence, delights in benefiting others, rescues and aids the destitute.

If the Three Origins Officials have exquisite slips and azure writings, their purple brain and brocade tongue, mysterious will and temple hairline, green intestines and red marrow, square heaven and round forehead, yin has hidden bones, soft hair with purple luster, three openings at the orifices, movements somewhat stiff, eyes with flowing light, blue essence condensed liquid, palm patterns four directions, teeth and fangs three edges; such a person is spiritual, kind, humble, compassionate and inspiring spirit, fond of subtle reverence and faith, delights in forests and spring, loves clear flowing water, cherishes mountains and rivers, wishes to cast name to Ah, protects spirit and nourishes soul, aspires to soar to Azure Peace, tastes the heavenly immortals.

All with such signs must be upper immortals. They may learn and obtain, or obtain without learning; the key is that the person must love the dao, love to study its subtlety, and will swiftly ascend and transform.

Next, on the nose is the mysterious mountain. The mysterious mountain is a black mark on the nose. Also, the abdomen must have a mysterious mound, corresponding to the mysterious mountain. The mysterious mound is also a black mark. If either is missing, the immortal sign is incomplete. If one has foul breath and a nature enduring filth, both mysterious mountain and mound signs are spoiled.

Next, blue bones: those with blue bones love the fragrance of five spices, and love to study numinous and spiritual matters. Next, crane gait and dragon stride, jade pillow at the nape, morning hidden behind the ears, blue marks under the ribs, body covered in net patterns, heart true and gallbladder calm, ears firm and qi broad—these are all signs of next-level immortals.

The Mysterious Continent also has golden engraved name registers; those who obtain corpse liberation without study, if they learn, become immortals who release the corpse by day. Next, the Three Officials’ Tai Mountain Office has the birthplace of life, a land without death; such people’s souls and fate do not end in death, floating and wandering infinitely; thus those who study the dao and become immortals are those who have attained earth-walking immortality.

Every thirty years they change place and name, also with no death date. Therefore, the Tai Mountain Three Officials’ mysterious record white register does not note death places, not the Three Officials’ mistaken annotation of death places.

The Taiyin records life and death, with black registers and white books, cinnabar compiled slips, recording birth order and death order, comparing their numbers; for every six thousand slips, one person has no death place. Such people mostly live long and are hard to kill, often exceeding one hundred years; when they die, it is sudden and painless.

If added to this is dao study, they nearly become complete and teachable. Yet such people’s nature is mostly cautious, humble and gentle, fond of subtle matters—all immortal signs. Next, those steadfast in the dao, with focused and upright spirit, or widely practicing yin virtue, aiding the poor and rescuing the distressed, bestowing favors on kin and poor, burying bones; virtue surpasses ancient men, pure, fair, gentle, humble, not lustful or thieving; or ancestors bestowed grace, generations established merit, virtue in the Three Officials, having performed three hundred good deeds; with this dao study, all can attain immortality.

If the heart is upright, Heaven and Earth cannot oppose; if spirit is firm, ghosts and gods cannot resist; if soul is bright, myriad evils cannot invade; if spirit body is white, ten thousand demons cannot harm; if essence is pure, lustful corpses cannot mount; if fluids are abundant, three worms cannot disturb; if blood is congealed, turbid qi cannot scatter.

Therefore, those who study the dao must have true heart and firm spirit, sharpen spirit and embrace soul, imprison ten thousand evils in the eight desolations’ prison, close myriad demons at the nine distant ends, with sincerity preserve true unity at the primal beginning, diligently and constantly wish to spread wings and fly as immortals, settle the vermilion spirit in the scarlet abode, guard the five treasures in the clear mystery, walk the test and observe without faltering, dwell in honor and disgrace without shifting, face south without looking back, abandon ten thousand gold without regret, endure cold and hardship’s harshness, delight in quiet fasting on hills and mountains, guard sincere heart without weariness—thus one may be called a true dao practitioner.

If none of these signs or conduct are present, though one may be a hero standing out, aspiring to swallow the four seas, broad in qi and lofty in tone, deep and bright as a jade gem, flying pen and eloquent speech, elegant and extraordinary, reasoning obscure and comprehensive, speaking of emptiness while eyes survey the eight directions—such is certainly not immortal talent, merely vain toil through the years, without understanding and attainment.
