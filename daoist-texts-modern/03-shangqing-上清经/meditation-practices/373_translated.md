Chapter on Cosmic Portents, Part One

Poem of Startled Green Splendor

The divine mountain thrusts through the clouds, peaks soaring a thousand fathoms high. The vast void encloses the numinous valley, jade forests flourish, austere and dense. This single character, inked thick and dark, is no longer recognizable; from its center a stroke extends downward, resembling the character for “sheep” — the person’s name is Quan. Born marked by beauty and grace, at twenty he flows with clear tones. His dwelling is solemn wisdom’s ferry, transcending form and image like Wei’s forest. He raises colors within vermilion gates, harboring a heart beyond the vulgar. I and the Master share clan and root, originating from the same abyssal pool. The grand lineage divides into upper deeds, now each a different branch. Orchid and gold, favored for their beauty, thrice increased, now felt more and more. Quietly seeking joy in this meeting, elegantly weaving through countless ancestral rites. Who says the hidden mirror is hard to grasp? To hold it within the heart’s fold is the true gain. Lofty thoughts beyond the cage, all are mountain hermits. Let not soaring wings rise, lest startled winds arise in their midst. Transformation may come from men, but the abundant sheep are not easily matched. What is sought is not the morning splendor, but the year’s end in my son.

Startled Green Splendor claims to be from the Southern Mountains, though which mountain is unknown. The woman is about twenty years old, dressed in blue from head to foot, her complexion flawless. She descended on the night of the tenth day of the eleventh month in the third year of Shengping. The two characters clipped from this name correspond to “sheep” and “Quan.” From then on, she came six times within a month. She said her original surname was clipped to the character “Startled.” The given character was originally “Quan,” but later generations darkened it. She gifted this character, originally “Quan,” later darkened to “Startled.” The poem and a fire-washed handkerchief were offered, along with one golden and one jade strip. The strips are refined and rare. The divine maiden said: “This was originally the grass-script ‘Quan’ character, later darkened to ‘Startled’ with a stroke above. You must be careful not to reveal me, lest we both be punished.” Inquiry revealed she is Luo Yu, a Daoist woman from Mount Jiuyi. In past lives, she was a teacher’s wife who poisoned a wet nurse; the sins of Xuanzhou had yet to be expiated, so now she is exiled to foulness to repay her fault. This “Quan” is also grass-script, resembling the former but not darkened. The elixir for corpse liberation is now at Xiangdong Mountain, suspended there by one inch. This woman is already nine hundred years old. This should be the descent of “Sheep Quan.” The Quan character is a Daoist title; Chen’s youngest son later became the Yellow Gate official under Jin Jianwen, namely Yang Xin, who also cultivated Daoist fasting. This was written for Lord Yang, sharing the same surname; one might also ask Yang Quan, who answered and explained. According to records, the third year of Shengping is the year of Jiwei, six years before Yichou, when the many true ones had not yet descended.

The following three lines are in Yang’s cursive on paper.

The Lady of Southern Mountain and her disciples say, the writing reads as follows: The disciple is Yang himself. This assembly of true ones seems to be gathered at the cave palace, so the Overseer of Life is foremost, likely the host. The Lady explained to Yang the sequence of titles, not during Yang’s descent.

Eastern Peak Supreme True Minister Overseer of Life Lord.

Eastern Palace Nine Microcosm True Man Golden Pavilion Prime Minister Azure Youth Lord.

Right Immortal Lord of Penglai, Jia Bao’an, a man from Zheng. From this point on, all are referred to by their Daoist titles, not personal names; clans are also recorded in the world’s Daoist records. Qingxu has a minor Heavenly King’s son named Deng. Regarding the Azure Youth’s high rank, one dare not speak his taboo name; Azure Void is the teacher of Southern Mountain, still called by his style name, but the Overseer of Life’s name is not revealed, which is difficult to clarify.

Tongbai True Man Right Assistant King, Leader of Five Mountains, Attendant to Emperor Chen, Prince Qiao.

Azure Canopy True Man Attendant to Emperor Chen, Guo Shigan, a man from Wei.

Rongshan True Man Supreme Pole Right Immortal Lord Fan Bohua, a recluse.

Shaoshi True Man Northern Terrace Official Liu Qianshou, a man from Pei.

Panzhong True Man Left Guard Official Wang Daoning, a man from Changshan.

Daliang True Man Wei Xianren, a man from Changle.

Minshan True Man Yin Youzong.

Luhun True Man Supreme Pole Overseer of West City Guo Youdu.

Jiuyi Mountain Marquis Zhang Shanggui, a man from Chu.

Dai Zong Divine Marquis, Leader of Luofeng Right Guard Official Bao Yuanjie, a man from Donghai.

Huashan Immortal Elder Qin Shuyin, a man from Fengyi.

Geyan True Man Zhou Jitong.

Yangluo True Man Leader of Western Return Fu Chunyu of Tai Xuan, a man from the Western Regions.

Gouqu True Man Right Guard Official Mao Jiwei.

Yujue True Man Pei Xuanren.

Baishui Immortal Capital Zhu Jiaofu.

Three Officials Life Protection Officer Mao Sihe.

Taihe True Man Shan Shiyuan.

The above twenty-three true men sit facing west, rise facing south and walk east. According to ritual, this is facing south, with the west as superior; the female true ones face east, so they should rise southward. Those facing north now do so likely because of proximity to high true ones.

Taihe Spirit Consort Supreme True Lady.

Northern Sea Six Microcosm Mysterious Pure Lady.

Northern Han Seven Spirits Right Lady.

Supreme Pole Central China Right Lady.

Purple Microcosm Left Palace Lady Wang.

Canglang Yunlin Right Heroine Lady. Note: Right Heroine is Purple Microcosm’s elder sister; now reversed in position, indicating rank fluctuations.

Supreme True Overseer of Life Southern Mountain Lady. This is Lady Wei herself, who does not state her surname.

Eight Spirits Dao Mother Western Mountain Lady Jiang. Note: There are several titles; more are considered higher. The Queen Mother of the West is called Nine Spirits; thus Eight Spirits should precede Seven Spirits, but now reversed, which is unclear. Also, reading the Huangting text, the Northern Mountain Lady Jiang differs from today.

Supreme True Eastern Palace Guard Lady.

Fangzhang Platform Zhaoling Lady Li.

Purple Clear Upper Palace Jiuhua Lady Anfei.

Zhuling Northern Absolute Platform Lady Guanfei.

Northern Mountain Supreme True Lady Shan.

Western Han Lady.

Changling Lady Du.

The above fifteen female true ones face east, sit facing south, and rise facing north. Though the month and day are not recorded when discussing this, the names and ranks of the true ones are given first, with those considered higher mentioned earlier, much like honorific titles today.

On the night of June twenty-first, Dinglu asked: “What does Prefect Xu desire in seeking the Dao?” The answer was: “Earnest cultivation of true sincerity.” Dinglu further said: “In the past, there were Zhao Shutai and Wang Shiqing, who also spoke of diligent study but ultimately did not meet expectations, and were thus summoned by the Northern Bright Duke’s mansion.” This was in the year of Yichou, June. Before this, only on June fifteenth did Dinglu give this answer to the Prefect’s letter, discussing Maoshan matters. Before that, there was another transmission, date unknown, recorded in scroll four; no earlier ones exist. The Northern Bright Duke’s mansion is the official bureau of Fengdu Palace. Formerly, the gate to Tianjin, gathering flowers at Chiqiu, then sounds of spirits and garments, dust-covered splendor—this corresponds to the initial descent of Huaqiao, the character slightly dependent on others. Radiant mountain, lofty sky, self-proclaimed resonance of the mysterious, everywhere unblocked, washed by numinous waves, truly hoping to flourish with all things. Yet unable to spread the work in pairs, wandering peaks and chasing freedom, then realizing the moment of enlightenment, the mysterious sound does not drive away but returns, quieting the Ge platform. The mysterious blade has no kin, flowing mirror escapes truth; if one goes to the cloud wall, imagining surpassing all alone, bowing to open and sprinkle, moving should be hidden and free—then we all share joy and enthusiasm. Formerly seeing the situation, knowing well at the end. The writing says: “Perusing the sacred records, events profound and subtle, golden scripts plainly written, azure records mysteriously fixed, thus transcending the mundane, roaming freely in the Purple Yang; how clear and distant, how subtle and precious! Those who can, please borrow to explain.” Also says: “The steps to the Dao sharpen the spirit, calm the body, trust in the night, wash sincerity to seek protection; thus speaking, the Dao is near. Yet inquiring late at night, one should be diligent in management, then later grasp the heavenly bond, float on the numinous web, mind roaming the vast space, eyes seeing the cave chamber, not long to wait. If the five emotions err and waves rise, the three souls cross over; then the three true ones dance swords, the Yellow Pavilion swiftly closes gates—can one not strive? Can one not strive?”

On the night of June twenty-second, at rooster’s crow, a message was given—this is the Purple Yang’s decree.

The above two lines were written by the Prefect.

Qingling True Man spoke of the *Treasure Scripture* and so forth. This record of cultivation is found in scroll three, not repeated here.

Purple Microcosm Lady’s message reads as follows. The matter is also in scroll three.

In the third year of Xingning, the year of Yichou, on the night of June twenty-third, this message was given. Earlier that evening, there was a discussion: many had dull ears and eyes, wishing to request this method. That very night, a descent appeared—this is the message seen. This is Yang’s own record. The Prefect was about sixty years old, with failing ears and eyes, hence the inquiry. Yang did not wish to reprimand, so he said it was on behalf of others.

Also said: “Daoists with heavy ears” and so forth. This matter is also in scroll three.

The above one line is Qingling True Man’s words.

The True Man said: combing the hair and trimming it, seeking to have too much. This matter is also in scroll three.

The above one line is Purple Microcosm Lady’s words.

That night, the first descent entered the door but had not yet sat, saying: “Tonight the waves sound like thunder.” The disciple asked the reason; the answer was: “Just now I saw a great wave in the Eastern Sea.” The disciple is Yang himself.

The Lady of Southern Mountain spoke.

Also said: “Do you hate blood?” The answer: “Truly I hate it.” She said: “Blood is on the path; if you hate it, how can you walk?” The answer: “One should avoid it.” Also said: “Avoidance is good; better if the eyes do not see it.”

The Lady of Southern Mountain spoke.

From then on, the true ones spoke together.

Also said: The *Treasure Scripture* is a book in Pei Qingling’s embroidered pouch, always carried by attendants. Pei once received this book from Purple Microcosm Lady; I also have it, all written thus in the Western Palace’s fixed edition.

Asked where the Western Palace is, the answer was: it is the northern altar of the Mysterious Garden, atop the Western Jade Terrace; all heavenly true treasures are stored therein.

The Lady of Southern Mountain spoke.

Pei True Man also said: this book is of the same rank as the *Hidden Book*, essential and usable, also called the *Seven Mysterious Hidden Book*. The two gentlemen completed its transmission on the second day.

The Lady of Southern Mountain reported: Purple Microcosm Left Lady Wang, named Qing’e, style Yuyi, is the twentieth daughter of the Mother, ruling Yuye Xuanlong Mountain, chiefly teaching those destined to become true men.

The above line was given the previous evening. These lines correspond to the message from Purple Yang on the twenty-second night; that same evening was to have further major events. Later, the voice and breath subsided, also from that evening. Yang later recalled this matter, elaborated in the twenty-second day’s records, hence “previous evening.”

From Qingling come twelve lines, all written by the Prefect.

On the night of June twenty-fourth, Purple Microcosm Lady descended, and upon entering the earthly realm requested: “The true spirit has descended into the mortal world, yet hands and feet have never written anything themselves; thus it must be humble and distant, not yet to be seen. I dare ask here, hoping to enlighten the ignorant.” The Lady then sat again and gave a transmission, now recorded as follows: This is Yang’s own account. The body of Shen Jingxu is ethereal, no path to seek; words arise from empty space, nothing to grasp; wandering and transforming without delay. These two lines both float and sink in darkness and oblivion, moving like a fish in water, blazing and silent; thus reckless and without ferry, riding the wind and drifting, existing only in the empty boat. Therefore, the emptiness within reality, the presence within emptiness, the form within non-being. As for the close demonstration, it is to wave forms on paper, with clear writing and principles, roughly good in outward appearance, mysterious brushwork brilliant, model and substance manifest, silent and elegant, forms transmitting to the mundane world. If one exposes any corporeal matter, advancing to the world and retreating, it stains the ode of the transcendent, harms the prohibition of separation; this is not our practice, nor permitted by spiritual law. Now I present the origin of writing: once the text was begun, it was the first sprouting of five colors, the time when literary painting was fixed, the meeting of refined people, the differentiation of yin and yang. Then came the three origins and eight assemblies, the myriad directions flying in the heavens, and the eight dragons’ cloud seals shining brightly. Later, in the era of the Two Emperors, the eight assemblies’ writings evolved into dragon and phoenix chapters, condensing cloud seals’ traces as the Sanskrit script, dividing and breaking into two paths, grounding truth from the easy, matching distinct branches, thus becoming sixty-four kinds of writings, spreading through the thirty-six heavens and ten directions above and below, each taking its category, differing in use. Though the sounds and standards are uniform, the traces and forms differ. Upon examination and discussion, the eight assemblies’ writings are the truest, the ancestors of literary works; the cloud seals and shining light are the root and origin, the beginning of writing. Now the three origins and eight assemblies’ writings are used by the Supreme Pole’s high true immortals; the cloud seals and shining light chapters are the characters seen in talismanic writings. Then in the era of Hua Ji, false writings arose, all clever and superficial, descending to vulgar texts, licentious and eccentric characters, abandoning the root and imitating the false, a clamor of filth and death. Why would true immortals abandon the root and write licentious and chaotic characters? Those who attain true manhood have all true matters; why alone in the vulgar and superficial halls would they preserve licentious and floating faults without change or correction? In the world, there were those who could write well and do affairs; upon becoming true immortals, the external writings also suddenly follow the body and reflect themselves; true matters close at hand are no longer discarded; now having received the impure writings, one again studies the superior texts, then truly understands the true writings. The ghost path is the same, but the writing has minor deviations. Using the spiritual brush and true hand, one initially dares not present writings to fleshly men; though sometimes there are those who attain the Dao but have not transcended the world, also dare not present writings and ink to show the nearness of the characters. Thus, talismanic writings and spiritual embellishments are only newly made from the beginning; therefore, the world cannot understand their origins, nor do we hide them; in the dark they mutually understand, inside and outside correspond. Also, the *Four Extremes Bright Section*, a high and strict prohibition, also does not heed us, but is again a common text in the world. Since I have begun, you certainly do not understand; what use is it to be troubled and confused? This too should be concealed in its acceptability or not, hardly worth suspicion; I imagine it somewhat opens the chest and heart, no longer a flow of writings.

Supreme True Overseer of Life Southern Mountain Lady transmitted, now recorded as follows:

To look upward and cast clouds, reins held in the vast sky, hands grasping the heavenly web, feet stepping the jade court, body ascending the imperial gate, donning precious blue robes, above discussing the nine mysteries’ transcendence, below recording the myriad springs of great life, thus standing upright as lightning and thunder, a thousand clouds shining bright, true words and mysterious waves, lofty talks of Jade Purity, stirring the flow of crimson lips, moving the sun’s qi in drips and drops, then breathing out beacon fires and dispelling smoke, plucking gold and playing jade, phoenix sounds flourishing, phoenix songs of auspicious voices. If only responding to scenes and turning downward, returning to spiritual dust and ashes, joining the carriage in decrepit chambers, wandering Buddha’s court and market, coming to form true talent, instructing my disciples, then jade chimes fall in sound, jade bells held within, eyes surrounding the five impurities, vast and narrow, faults in the chamber, spirits laboring with foul smells, filling the nose and closing breath, thus closing orchid sounds in the central China origin, retreating from the inferior golden sounds and issuing forth. Spirits speak subtly nearby, reaching ten thousand miles to connect; strange melodies though touched, layered endlessly without obstruction. Therefore, once true principle is divided, hearing afar the Dao is lofty and distant; the unpolished jade does not scatter brightness, yet brings humble and subtle wisdom. Now you have the utmost awakening of heart, bringing forth suspicion and doubt; outwardly observing vulgar opposition, inwardly harboring hesitation and insight. Not applying matters as needed is already beyond; hope that what you cultivate is the Dao, savoring the subtlety; once the Dao’s subtlety is attained, high and low sounds must be calm and clear. This is not what is planned; you add excessive worry, scattering such thoughts—be cautious.

The above three lines are in Yang’s writing.

On the night of June twenty-fourth, Southern Mountain Lady appeared and ordered this to be written. Earlier on the evening of the twenty-second, there was a discussion in a separate room about the Dao; Purple Microcosm and Southern Mountain Ladies’ voices and breath were distinct, the lower ones did not understand their meaning, so this letter was given to answer the doubts of those gathered. Upon first descent, the color and breath were still uneven; after transmission, the disciple only felt the color uneven, no other matters to speak of. This line is also Yang’s own record.

That evening, Southern Mountain Lady spoke to disciples: “Tomorrow I shall go to Qingxu Palace on Wangwu Mountain, so you shall know where I go.”

That evening she also said: “At the western head of Tongbai Mountain in the East Sea, about two hundred zhang of collapse occurred.”

Purple Microcosm Lady said: “How can the thoughts and worries of the world be truly accurate in all matters? Should there not be answers to their hearts?” Southern Mountain Lady said: “It is but a jest, intending to establish firmness and clarity.”

In the third year of Xingning, the year of Yichou, on the night of June twenty-fifth, this was the beginning of Lady Anfei’s descent, recorded separately in another scroll, thus restarting the year and era titles. Purple Microcosm Lady descended again, accompanied by a divine maiden. The divine maiden wore cloud brocade, red above and blue below, shining with patterns and colors; a green embroidered belt at the waist jingled with more than ten small bells, alternating blue and yellow; on the left belt hung a jade pendant, similar to worldly pendants but smaller; her clothing was bright and translucent, illuminating the room like sunlight shining on mica. Her hair was coarse, resembling a mane. Two attendants accompanied her: one wore vermilion clothes with a blue embroidered pouch, holding a brocade pouch about one foot one or two inches long, containing about ten scrolls, sealed with white jade inscribed “Jade Purity Divine Tiger Inner True Purple Primordial Elixir Chapter.” The other attendant wore blue, holding a white box bound with a red cord, the box resembling ivory. Both attendants were about seventeen years old, exquisitely adorned. The divine maiden and attendants’ faces were bright and clear like jade, fragrant with five spices, like incense for infants—“infant incense” from foreign lands. Upon first entering the door, following Purple Microcosm Lady, she announced: “Today a noble guest comes to discuss good matters.” Then I rose. The Lady said: “No need to stand, just sit together and bow to each other.” The Lady sat facing south; I first sat below the bed facing west; the divine maiden saw this and sat on the same bed facing east, both saluting with left hands. After bowing, Purple Microcosm Lady said: “This is the young maiden of Lady Li, Supreme True Lady of the Void, Golden Platform, who once was sent to Turtle Mountain to learn the Shangqing Dao, attained the Dao and received the Most High’s book, appointed as Purple Clear Upper Palace Jiuhua True Consort.” Then she bestowed the surname An, named Yubin, style Lingshao. Purple Microcosm Lady asked me: “Have you ever seen such a person in the world?” I answered: “Spirit noble and lofty, beyond comparison.” The Lady laughed heartily, “How so?” I did not answer further. The Purple Clear True Consort sat long without speaking, holding three jujubes in hand, dark and large, without pits, lacking the taste of jujube, more like pear flavor. She first offered one to me, then one to Purple Microcosm Lady, keeping one herself, instructing us to eat. After some time, the True Consort asked my age and birth month; I answered: thirty-six, born in the year of Gengyin, ninth month. The True Consort said: “Your Master, Southern True Lady, Overseer of Life, holds authority; the Dao is lofty and perfect, truly the root of good virtue. I have long heard of your virtuous reputation; unexpectedly today, due to uncle’s cause, joy arises. May in the meeting of the dark fate, you still be entwined with pine and moss.” I replied with my name: “Drunken and fallen into vulgarity, dust stains my nature; high and low are distant clouds; no affinity to receive respect; I shamefully fall short of spiritual descent, joy and dance without limit; only by your instruction can I dispel darkness and aid my original self, the wish of many nights.” The True Consort said: “Now speak without modesty; words of modesty are inappropriate.” After a long while, the True Consort said: “I wish to compose a letter to present to you; may you take the brush and express my humble intent, is that agreeable?” I answered: “I obey your command.” Then folding paper and dipping brush, she orally transmitted and composed the following poem:

Cloud Pavilion firm in empty heights, Jade Terrace towering and lush. Purple Palace rides green light, Spirit observatory majestic and lofty. Within the Langxuan vermilion chamber, supreme virtue shines like crimson clouds. Bowing to wash in the cloud vase’s ferry, looking up to gather blue olive blossoms. Washing feet in the jade heavenly pool, beating oars at the Cow River. Then driving the cloud chariot, descending the dragon reins at the mysterious pass. Shaking robes at the edge of dust and filth, treading the turbid waves in armor. Wishing to bind with mountain and marsh, firm and gentle, yielding and harmonious. Together carrying the twin purity within, Supreme True Dao without error. Purple Microcosm gathers good plans, singing acceptance and abundant blessings.

Upon finishing writing, I looked and said: “Now I present this as a gift, to express my sincere heart; do not say otherwise. If there is anything unclear in your mind, there will be subtle inquiries.”

Purple Microcosm Lady said: “I shall again compose a letter to inform you, to show good matters.” I folded paper and dipped brush; the Lady’s poem was:

Two images within and without, the mysterious qi truly divided in the fruit. The dark meeting needs no carriage, thus the precious attainment of truth. Southern Mountain casts bright gold, faintly observing the tilted book. Red clouds illuminate, thus inspiring the spiritual sky people. Riding the storm, companions in bed, together holding the scarlet clouds. Realizing and sighing at the human-heaven boundary, within numbers there is fate. The supreme Dao is truly without error, the dust is not heard. Same eyes all constant images, high singing for your cause.

Upon finishing, Purple Microcosm Lady took the writing and said: “I give this to you; today I am the master of fate and the chief of cause. Tomorrow Southern Mountain Lady will return; I shall welcome her with the Consort at Yuntao Pavilion. If she does not return tomorrow, then there will be matters for several days.” After a long while, Purple Microcosm Lady said: “I depart now; tomorrow I shall return with the True Consort to visit you.” Rising from the bed, she vanished. The True Consort lingered behind, saying: “Dark feelings not yet settled, spirit not forgotten; I imagine you savor it; tomorrow I shall return.” She took my hand and held it, then descended from the bed and disappeared before leaving the door.

On the evening of June twenty-sixth, the true ones came and submitted the following:

Purple Microcosm Left Lady,

Purple Clear Upper Palace Jiuhua True Consort,

Supreme True Overseer of Life Southern Mountain Lady Master, all previous “Ba Shi” persons are Yang’s pseudonyms.

Purple Yang True Man,

Maoshan Lord,

Qingling True Man,

Maoshan Junior Lord.

Also present was a very young person, well-groomed, wearing a lotus crown, vermilion clothes, belt and sword, never before seen. This person discussed many matters of Jinting Mountain with the true ones, respectfully saluting Purple Microcosm, Purple Clear, and Southern True Ladies; others spoke plainly. Said to be Tongbai Mountain True Man Prince Qiao, who did not speak with me. Earlier and later, true men came to descend, but none spoke directly with me.

Each sat for a long time; Purple Clear True Consort said: “I wish again to trouble Master’s hand to write something to disperse thoughts and forget words, may it be so?” I folded paper awaiting transmission; the True Consort slowly and softly spoke and gave:

I am the young maiden of the Primordial Lord, beloved son of Lady Li of the Void. Once first learning the truth at Turtle Terrace, receiving jade chapters from the Most High, bearing the tiger record at Purple Emperor, holding jade iron from the Heavenly Emperor, receiving books from the Supreme True Consort, to roam Jade Purity. Often passing through nine nets by my own hand, stepping on the mysterious chamber, spirit forms and voids, drinking the sun’s root, entering the feast of seven pavilions, exiting the reins of cloud chariots, gathering the three stars and ascending together, scattering the rosy clouds to fly the chariot. Not unable to select the upper chamber, seeking Azure Youth, seeking the king’s palace companions, meeting high spirits to form pairs, connecting the mysterious to lead the strange, befriending the imperial young man. This is my assigned task, to arrange meetings and appointments, setting ink meetings and names, jade contracts and hometowns, aligning principles and celebrations, traveling with wild geese, dividing gourds and cups, performing rituals and tying robes, looking back on companions’ merits, hiding true prescriptions. From this, the fate is fixed in the dark records, blue books of the upper origin; thus the good and humble hearts are aligned, the fondness for scenes is bounded. Wishes fulfilled and roaming, joy combined with past decrees—is this not natural? This is again the great root of the two images, the matching of inside and outside, truly not to change or reverse, condensing feelings and empty blades, spirit knives with seven layers, leaving duties to the primordial, preserving truth and opening jade, called the single scene of eight emptinesses. Pure, silent and clear, gathering and flowing through the sky, making phoenix songs on cloud roads, dragon roars and tiger howls, the twin lights of the heavenly sovereign, ascending distant star towers, stars casting light, sun and moon illuminating the body, mouth breathing dark smoke, eyes flashing lightning, resting in jade chambers, flowing through Jade Purity, hands grasping the scene clouds, feet stepping the golden court. From this moment, at the time of attaining the Dao, one should fully unite inside and outside, principles like metal and stone, feelings entwined in pairs, united in heart and curtain, embracing the quilt firmly, with light connections, dust and filth of seven spirits, sorrowful souls and wandering spirits. This is my seeking of clan and lord, not evil. Now you may be said to have attained the true heart, feelings united as one, about to join together, harnessing jade emptiness, traveling this mystery, gathering scarlet fruits in the jade garden, picking cinnabar flowers in the Lang Garden, sharing drinks from the Purple River’s water, washing together by the Blue River’s shore, purple flower feather mantle, sun crown lotus coronet, roaming freely in Shangqing, all attending the Three Origins, eight scenes blossoming, phoenix gates and cloud passes, bowing to wash golden marrow, chanting jade mysteries, floating in the air resting peacefully, high meetings at the Great Morning, four jun singing clearly, incense mother playing smoke, all watching in unison, carrying skirts and sashes, is this not joyful? Is this not fulfillment? Master, please follow the fate and meetings, I shall not refuse, nor can I go against truth and return to darkness, only entrusting the heart. After transmission, she took the writing and said: “Now I present this letter to you, hoping to clear doubts and blockages.” After speaking, she laughed. After a long while, Purple Microcosm Lady said: “The True Consort’s words are complete, the cause of affection established; you may no longer hold anything back; the mysterious fate and dark division make it so.” Southern Mountain Lady appeared and transmitted a letter saying: “The dark fate and numbers respond, the mysterious fate matches; the appointment comes to visit, new bonds formed; this brings good affairs of truth, showing paired names, fixing inside and outside duties, not to follow the world’s filth and act licentiously and impurely. The paired spiritual consort connects the scene, inviting noble true maidens, for your close friendship, greatly advancing your achievements without fear of severance. A thousand gods may test and see; no more need be said. The true banner surely can go forth; the cloud plow surely can ride together. I once arranged this intention for you with Purple Microcosm Lady; now it is fulfilled, increasing my joy. Be careful not to doubt in your heart.” I recently saw Lady Li of the Golden Platform in Qingxu, who said you still have doubts and the color and breath slightly suggest the character “liang” should be made; if you go against this, you mislead others greatly. The True Consort has the Divine Tiger Inner True Cinnabar Blue Jade Script, not for those who possess it; talented ones seek to write it, so it should not be hidden. Today, together, what is written is not mere words but surely will ride the scene king’s clouds. If any do not understand, subtle inquiries are appropriate. The True Consort saw the Lady’s letter and laughed, saying: “Hand in hand on twin platforms, joyous meeting; chariots and carriages together, all united here.”

Chapter on Cosmic Portents, Part Two

Qingxu True Man transmitted a letter saying: The Way of Yellow and Red, the method of mixed qi, was taught by Zhang Ling as a seed technique, not the matter of true men. I have often seen those who practice this perish without seed; none have sown it and obtained life. Among millions, all are examined and punished; among tens of millions, only one mistakenly obtains it, and that one attains near immortality. Zhang Ling taught this to the world; his later transformations no longer practice this. Be cautious in speaking of the impure lower path of birth; the true qi of the sky and earth is the proper qi. Those who harbor lustful thoughts, keeping the mind on color and form while practicing the hidden scriptures, only invite the Three Officials’ punishment. It is like embracing jade and rushing into fire, buried in a golden coffin like a dog. Color and form are called yellow and red; the upper path is the hidden book, difficult for people to understand, even to this day.

Purple Microcosm Lady transmitted a letter saying: The Yellow Book and Red Realm, though secret essentials of longevity, are actually lower techniques of life, not the words of the Upper Palace celestial true ones riding clouds and resting in serene light. This path is only about long nurturing and partial birth, not the upper Dao. Those harboring lustful qi and practicing the hidden scriptures are sure to hold the Water Official’s pen and sound the Three Officials’ drum; the mysterious cannot be served, nor can forgiveness be relied upon. In short, when upright, the spirit descends; when focused, the gods are sent.

The true man’s paired scene is treasured for matching pairs, love residing in the two scenes; though called husband and wife, they do not follow husband and wife’s traces, using empty names to show the senses. If yellow and red remain in the chest, even true men cannot be seen, spirits cannot be contacted; only laboring in affairs, also laboring under the Three Officials. At cockcrow, Southern Mountain Lady transmitted a letter: “The cock has crowed; the cause of affection is firm.”

Purple Yang True Man transmitted a letter: “The Void is distant and lofty; high and low connect alike; the meaning of worthy conduct is written in the dark fate; be cautious of doubts about yellow and red.”

Maoshan Lord transmitted a letter: “The mysterious mark touches the scene, bowing to harmonize with the dusty mist, jade chimes sound in the chamber, clear winds soar swiftly; should one not strive?”

After speaking, the true men departed; the True Consort lingered behind and transmitted a letter:

Forget the brilliance of orchids and grasses, the heart aligned with the appointed method. Count the closeness to the pure cosmos, virtue harmonizing with flowing light. Joyous gathering and clear mind, leading the refined and submitting to bright clarity. You are noble and lofty, even if delayed, forget the vulgar. 

After speaking, she held hands and descended from the bed, disappearing before reaching the door.

On the night of June twenty-sixth, eight true men descended:

Purple Microcosm Left Lady one.

Purple Clear Upper Palace Jiuhua True Consort two.

Supreme True Overseer of Life Southern Mountain Lady three.

Purple Yang True Man four.

Qingling True Man five.

Maoshan Lord six.

Maoshan Junior Lord seven.

Also present was a very young person, well-groomed, wearing a lotus crown, vermilion clothes, belt and sword, never before seen. Likely Tongbai Mountain True Man Prince Qiao, discussing many matters of Jinting Mountain, respectfully saluting Purple Microcosm, Purple Clear, and Southern True Ladies. All bowed in respect. This line repeats with slight variation; earlier records are Yang’s own account of Jiuhua’s descent; hidden and not revealed. From this point on, the account elaborates the Prefect’s matters, showing the Prefect’s record. 

Supreme True Man said: “Yesterday with Uncle Shen, we went to Qingxu Palace to examine the gains and losses of immortals; recently, forty-seven have been removed, leaving only three. Also re-examined your names and records; now they are good. Xu is the Prefect’s name; Yang submitted this record, so the name is not recorded.”

“I initially did not understand how much better this is; its cleansing and advancing, focusing on principle, heart and intention exhausted, like walking on water and fire. If one persists long, even true men cannot escape, nor immortality be hidden. One must cut off lustful desires; then we can see; I shall explain. This is Southern Mountain Lady’s words. This is what was said on the twenty-fourth day, about going to Wangwu Mountain the next day.”

The Lord said: “Bojue is below me; the great elder can still be considered. Jiangdong has not seen such diligent Daoists; yet do not rely on Bojue and forget the Dao. Falsehood is the disease of virtue; flamboyance is the disaster of the body; stagnation is the loss of the head; shame is the key to the body. Only after dispatching these four difficulties can one begin to ask the Dao. Thus the spirit wheel moans, the sun seems to waver. Do not act with lustful faults; this is the upper true Dao. Yesterday I saw the proper names removed from Qingxu Palace, yet they are again examined and punished, handed over to the Three Officials for judgment—should one not be cautious?”

Southern Mountain Lady said.

Prefect Xu carefully attended funerals and mourning, showing signs within the year. Maoshan Junior Lord laughed after speaking. The Prefect is well known for his kindness and solemnity; the Heavenly King recently asked about this person’s whereabouts and cultivation. The Eastern Minister answered: “He is a man from my hometown.” Hometown means the same region as Jurong and Maoshan, not originally from Xianyang.

Inner true and outer mixed worldly deeds, a good talent; now cultivating the Supreme True Dao. This is Southern Mountain Lady’s words.

From June twenty-fourth onward, twenty-four lines, all with Yang’s writing.

Xiao Miao is a true talent, inner mirror and outer harmony; Zeng Can leaves the field, heart and cinnabar aligned; three moves and three changes, coming to shelter the head. These four lines are a cryptic combination of characters, the Prefect’s style name.

Record named Supreme Pole, golden script of Eastern Province, seven degrees of difficulty, indulging in the cave tower; inner burdens dissipate, soul and spirit soften; guarding tirelessly, accumulating without rest; five difficulties dispatched, sealed as marquis. Seven degrees refer to flying steps; cave tower and chamber matters.

The above is Purple Microcosm Lady’s message to Prefect Xu.

One line written by the Prefect.

Purple Microcosm Lady said: “At the side of the floral canopy...” This matter is in scroll three.

On the night of June twenty-seventh, this message was given.

One line with Yang’s writing.

Accumulated essence inspires, all things respond; subtle sincerity not yet complete, form and splendor not full; form and splendor incomplete, the cave chamber within is hard to distinguish. I once received this method, always storing it in the northwest; northwest is the refreshing place of heaven and earth, the mysterious gate of inner illumination; thus it can be clearly shown. Northwest is the internal gate of heaven and earth.

On June twenty-seventh, Purple Yang’s message. On this day, the true ones descended again; their matters are many and not all recorded.

One line written by the Prefect.

Two lords each have six attendants; Pei’s attendant holds a blue feathered baton, one attendant carries an embroidered pouch; Zhou’s attendant holds a yellow feathered baton; no pouch.

Two lines in Jia script.

On June twenty-ninth, Jiuhua True Consort transmitted a letter:

The scene responds with twin brilliance, clouds gather and descend mysteriously, dragons flourish in the five emptinesses, gathering jade plates on the terrace. Singing long of the spirit toad, opening the jade door, faintly leaving behind worldly affairs, bidding farewell to the world, crimson scrolls and vermilion waves, lightning rushing to the purple perch, together carrying clear sounds beyond, roaming clouds and cliffs wide—how good, how joyful! The sun is the fruit of the rosy clouds; the clouds are the essence of the sun. You have only heard the method of consuming the sun’s fruit, never the knowledge of consuming the clouds’ essence. The scripture on consuming clouds is most secret; the way to attain clouds is easy. This is the method of embodying jade light and cloud reflections in Shangqing.

The eye is the mirror of the body; the ear is the window of the form. Too much seeing darkens the mirror; too much hearing closes the window. I have the stone to polish the mirror and the method to open the window, thus able to penetrate all spirits, keenly discerning silent sounds. The face is the courtyard of the spirit; hair is the brain’s flower. When the heart grieves, the face burns; when the brain declines, hair whitens. Thus essence and primordial fluids are lost, cinnabar juices exhausted. I have the scripture of childlike face, the method to restore whiteness. Essence is the spirit of the body; brightness is the body’s treasure. Too much toil scatters essence; when the body is spent, brightness fades. Thus old age follows qi’s decline; senescence comes. I have the way to benefit essence and extend brightness, the scripture to prolong life. These four ways are inner writings of Shangqing, true chapters of verification. I wish to present them to assist your clear illumination. After transmission, I showed it; I answered humbly, requesting it.

On the night of June twenty-ninth, Tongbai True Man descended with others, again transmitting and ordering me to write:

The eight bright and four extremes, spirit peaks distant and vast, strange words uttered with clarity, jade sounds vibrating, morning flight soaring clear, mysterious qi rushing to the sky, body transcending jade void, heart leaving difficult edges, sinking and stagnating beyond the subtle net, condensing and harmonizing on the quiet waves. Such a person must be able to spin and soar the mysterious river, sprinkling the true court; the Three Origins can be seen, the scarlet name can be established. If the heart is full of faults and waves, eyes seeing colored sleeves, moving with the net and trap, stirring competition and contention, this is the distant immortal path, seeking life and birth far and wide; be cautious. After writing, I showed it. This was Tongbai’s words, following the same evening as Lady Anfei’s transmission; thus again transmitted. Eventually, it seems still Lady Anfei, so annotated.

On the night of June thirtieth, Jiuhua True Consort descended with Purple Microcosm Lady and Southern Mountain Lady. The True Consort sat for a long time, then ordered attendants to open the embroidered pouch, taking out two scrolls to show and entrust. Now copied, titled:

*Shangqing Jade Rosy Purple Reflection Inner Observation Hidden Book*  
*Shangqing Returning Morning Returning Youth Sunlight Middle Mysterious Scripture*

The above two scroll titles: these titles should be of the Three Origins Eight Assemblies’ books; Yang, having thoroughly recognized the true characters, ordered them to be written in clerical script to make them clear.

On the night of July first, Purple Microcosm Lady, Southern Mountain Lady, Jiuhua True Consort, Purple Yang, Tongbai, Qingxu three true men, Maoshan two lords descended together. After a long time, I presented myself to the assembly of spirits, seeking methods for securing the body, wishing to know distinctions of rank and fate, the measure of years and limits. Then the True Consort laughed, and after a long while, transmitted a letter saying:

Bright Lord, simple and serene, secret structure of jade brightness, orchid abyss high flow, clear sounds of golden palace, truly a treasure trove of precious gems, inner radiance shining, marking and brushing the spiritual chapters, riding numbers and following life, pure virtue in the divine garden, cinnabar record of Jade Purity, rising smoke and pulling light, distant drum and far sound. Surely three officials attend the morning, the emperor himself high in assistance, four aides uphold the system. The holy lord governs life, judges death, rewards and punishes ghosts and gods, controls the fates of a thousand spirits, seals mountains and summons clouds, overseeing the harmony of yin and yang, and is appointed lord of Wu and Yue ghosts and gods. I shall extend my command to condense and observe, relying on splendor to be born, spirit flying through the Nine Heavens, void sounds rushing through chambers, following the four senses, mysterious ladder matching images, purple named Supreme, clear text of eight scenes, spirit shining in western light, virtue bright within, thus receiving the book and riding the qi, becoming the True Consort’s duty. Also assisting you to oversee the three Huo, commanding myriad gods, facing the Northern Emperor, issuing decrees to Feng Mountain, and cooperating to join sleeves in the spirit chamber, riding smoke of seven origins, auspicious meetings in rare forests, internally based on cause and effect. Therefore, your surname is Yang, mine is An; I myself descend from the mystery to create, you receive the book in the Western Palace, following the northern chariot, riding the cake east carriage, holding the feathered baton and iron, commanding the binding and control, the Three Officials serve with respect, rivers and mountains open source, heavenly soldiers offer martial power, four armor guards transport. At this time, you are truly the most noble lord, a magnificent spectacle of true immortals. Among the Three Officials, there is a saying: “Lord Yang An, Dong True Fate Spirit, is the one who governs us.” The sacred emperor’s way has lasted twenty-eight years, plus twenty-two years; the bright lord will ride the dragon and clouds, ascending by day, first visiting Shangqing Western Palace, then facing the Jade Emperor and Three Origins, then finally taking charge of the Eastern Chariot. This is your jade bright Purple Microcosm, golden sound and void command, honored by the Supreme Pole, the mysterious virtue rising high, no longer needing diligent study and toil, traversing mountains and rivers. For those who strive diligently, the spirit is clear and fresh; it is not a matter of today’s effortless deeds. The worldly entanglements of rank and wealth, traversing the dusty path of struggle, on the crossing of gain and loss, surely cannot be managed by true men; it is but to endure hardship and fortune’s moments. Seeing the bright lord’s ease, truly joyful; seeing the bright lord’s failure, truly sorrowful; these two feelings arise from color and expression, yet are insufficient to bring deep grief and long sorrow. As for the internal dark paired scenes, and foremost mysterious affinity, lightly sending dust and mist, joining form and worldly chamber—how could I, for faults and floating lowly delays of youth, damage the fixed essence of the true? Yin and yang have pairs; failure and success alternate use; the two images are arrayed, the paths of coming and going intertwined. Now people dwell in dust and turmoil, mostly guilty ghosts, the test of death. Those who dwell uselessly in the noisy mire, then attain true uprightness, relying on the mundane for inner observation, are the roots of spiritual immortals. Wealth and luxury are axes and saws breaking bones, like boats carrying sins; glory and pride in the world, competing for fame and time, are enough to teach faults and disgrace, weapons to cut fate—not good matters. Therefore, ancient sages, seeing the difficulty of sin and blame, knew the unendurable nature of wealth and glory, and so wandered in long forests, holding the name of famous mountains, chewing harmonious qi, washing in clear rivers, wishing to distance from this evil near, seeking many blessings, transcending and roaming, preserving the utmost purity. Why should you be anxious about worldly rank and wealth, throwing yourself into the arena of honor and disgrace? Now battle is joined, disasters meet daily, approaching divine winds to dispel, foul airs reaching the sky, bright gold born in mud and filth, treasures thrown into dung to attract dust, lifting clothes and shaking blood, impure essence damaging truth, mysterious communication far and wide—this is the time. If you cannot endure the smoke of wind and fire, wishing to embrace true form in secluded woods, you may seek the sword liberation way, making a final end. From complete emergence and concealment, near and far, facing the moment and place, you have a duty to the bright lord. The dark numbers respond, having orders and meetings; spiritual books and jade platforms, true contracts matching the scene; thus words are simple, heart complete in brush; how could I only lament one person? This is the example of naming and ranking. After writing, she gave it to me again, saying: “You should consider this and be less confused.”

From June twenty-ninth onward, nearly forty-four lines, all with Yang’s writing.

The Eastern Minister Lord came at the first watch of the fourth watch, with seven attendants entering the door; one held a purple banner baton; one held a floral banner; one named Ten Absolute Spirit Banner; one carried a green embroidered pouch; three held ivory boxes, the boxes seeming to contain books; one held a flowing gold bell, younger than the second brother. The second brother also came leaning, the Eastern Minister ordered to sit, so he sat. After a long time, speech was intricate. Earlier the divine maiden came, suspected to be the Queen Mother’s daughter; last night she came again, surely so. Southern True said: “She is the thirteenth daughter of the Mother, Lady Wang Meilan, style Shenlin, governing Canglang Mountain, receiving the title of Yunlin Lady.” These two matters were briefly recorded on the night of July fifth, later elaborated in detail. Thus Right Heroine Lady first descended frequently on July third and fourth evenings.

Two lines with Yang’s own record.

In the year of Yichou, third year of Jin Xingning, on the night of July fourth, Overseer of Life Eastern Minister came down, with seven attendants entering the door. One held a purple banner baton; one held a floral banner; one named Ten Absolute Spirit Banner; one carried a green embroidered pouch; three held white ivory boxes, seeming to contain books; one held a flowing gold bell; attendants all wore vermilion clothes; the Overseer of Life’s form was smaller than the second brother, wearing blue embroidered skirt, purple feather mantle, lotus crown; the second brother also came leaning; ordered to sit, so sat. Speech lasted long. On the night of July sixth, Overseer of Life came again, and after a long time transmitted a letter saying:

If one must follow the mysterious image, clear and rare, then one rises above the crowd of weeds, folding wings to rest high, sensing the supreme contract, deep and firm, mountains and rivers standing, jade scrolls playing, treasure spirits born, abandoning worldly attachments, tuning and plucking clear and pure, clarifying the empty scene, the five paths manifest, colors surpass transformation waves, desiring to be light and faint, emptiness like the dark path, no seeing or hearing, far from the perfect true, again rising mysterious awakening, bright virtue internally complete, spirit lifted externally sufficient, finally able to drive the cloud chariot to the sky, writing the Overseer of Life’s cinnabar record. If essence scatters and thoughts arise, life is unstable, qi follows dust waves, heart not truly united, this is enough to trouble body and spirit in the forest, said to be the character “zu” in error. The way is subtle and easy to seek, the way is difficult and hard to obtain, also shown to Prefect Xu. These two lines also written by the Prefect.

Prefect Xu wishes to dwell on the mountain, valuing the Dao without error, dwelling in truth with peace and joy. To be still is not to be the master of great compliance; to be calm is not the craftsman of teaching; thus one should be troubled to receive the no-ness. Such is the meaning. You do not change, why must there be four seasons? Qi is like breathing; a thousand years is like a passing moment. Zhaozi may be worried; disbelief is at the end, doubt in the heart is also already bitter.

The Overseer of Life spoke to Southern Mountain Lady.

Those who pursue the Dao always dwell in deep calm and solitude, often resting spirit and wandering leisurely, drinking and eating simply to suffice, not speaking of prayers or glances at cages; joy and sorrow thus depart, how can one reach the gate of premature death?

Each has their dwelling of will, each nature has its rhythm; how can one follow the evil of things, chasing the vanity of proper work?

Why not fully let loose the extreme mark of heaven, seeking true inner delight, from quiet truth to brighten the heart, soothing the entrusted to rest the mind, dwelling on Eastern Mountain to hide traces, grasping the mysterious spring in wondrous control, preserving the pearl to contain and shine, dispatching the five difficulties from the chest?

These three lines also seem to be from the Eastern Minister.

On the night of July fifteenth, Purple Microcosm Lady transmitted a letter saying:

Diligence in essence is the mark of mysterious spirit; calm and peace are the bed and quilt of true restraint. You diligently bathe the cinnabar heart, racing to the high peak; this may be called the handle of striving for the Dao, diligence to the utmost. Yet the Dao is gentle, true, and void; guarding blandly and mingling with things; peaceful and quiet, allowing spirit to awaken and shine. In short, impatience and restlessness are not entirely reasonable; those who oppose this also suffer labor.

Given to Prefect Xu.

On the night of July fifteenth, Qingling True Man transmitted a poem:

Aspiring to fly, as if sensing and becoming; majesty not inwardly connected; proud maiden far removed; three or four zigzagging, entering the imperial court; traversing eras and titles, attaining great age, surely shining; the four officials and prime ministers, suddenly soaring wings, ascending Shangqing. This is the great name of separation and union, the name Hui. Given to Prefect Xu.

That evening also Maoshan Lord transmitted a letter to Prefect Xu, answering questions about the cave heavens. Now recorded in scroll four.

Phoenix nest on tall trees, pure clothes fluttering. These eight words form the Prefect’s small name Mu. Following the path of truth, condensing heart and void mystery. Still taking these thoughts and mysteries, thus growing the Prefect’s style name. Five officials and stones of fatness, the body’s convenience; quickly take them to wear, can slightly brighten the face. Three eight orders clear and bright, next to practice mysterious truth, unyoke the carriage and rest, can recite cave chapters; jade blade corresponds to numbers. This jade blade character is the Prefect’s small name Yufu, same as the external record’s meaning; thus “corresponding to numbers.” Essence heart, high handle, hidden and quiet, true qi not lost, technique disperses and cures illness; this is what you should do. Next take rice and grain without violation, benefit marrow and remove illness, skin and flesh full and fat. Then ascend the mountain, chant cave chapters and lecture on mysteries. Yin beast white teeth—these four characters are the “Tiger Tooth,” also able to see opportunity, thus attaining immortality. Passing the year of Renchen, resting in flourishing wood, playing and holding Zhou’s book. These eight characters form the name Yang. Supreme Pole sets records, golden name Western Splendor, learning and wearing, can or not. Should be spiritual talisman; principle differs but agreement is the same; spirit and cave seek each other.

Dinglu said: “The matter of Dao medicines,” this is Dinglu’s words.

These are four lines of metaphor for the four persons’ names, each explaining what cultivation and wearing is appropriate. The words are connected sequentially, not knowing how two persons could speak together.

Allegories surely can be used; not using them is heartless. How can one ride swift traces? Seeking this spiritual sound in the void, subtle sounds have purpose; use carefully and do not lightly treat; all matters respond to divine mechanisms; protect yourself to see peace.

Right Heroine Lady chants this.

Maoshan Dinglu said: “Good admonition, can be recorded. Immortal talent does not use complicated worries, thus can attain it.” Life protection words.

In mid-August, that person must temporarily visit East Show to burn incense. Life protection at departure said.

From the year of Yichou onward, fifteen lines, with Yang’s writing.

Respectfully thinking of wind and flow, entrusting heart to fleeting scenes, ashamed of faults and ignorance, a humble cup of wine, thoughts self-driven, bathing and nurturing, crossing the stage of fortune and misfortune, hoping for grace to reach. Xu Xuan tremblingly bows twice; Prefect’s full name is Mi, style Sixuan, now simply called Xuan, meaning not yet fulfilled. Visiting Master Jia. This is Prefect’s hearing of Yang Xuan and Zhou Ziyang’s words, Jia Xuandao and others in charge of trial and verification, thus this writing. Jia presented it to Overseer of Life; Overseer of Life later replied, saying Jia recently brought this book. Zhou’s words are in scroll four.

One line is Prefect’s own written copy.

Taiyuan True Man gave this book, then ordered and transmitted a letter as follows:

If one can be distant and subtle in the present world, then what is valued is only the body; rarely striving for external difficulties, then there is no place of death. Thus ancient scholars grasp the mysterious spring to hide the handle, conceal the bright mirror amidst worldly affairs, focus spirit on mountain rock courtyards, nurture truth at the peaceful valley ferry. Thus letting hair loose on high peaks, weaving and measuring my life, shining bright, absorbing the five spirits, roaming and stepping the nine paths, ascending the origin to cleanse form, casting thoughts to sever emptiness, worldly affairs unengaged, closing and preserving three qi, refining subtle essence; thus able to reverse the waning years, becoming a childlike infant. If matters accumulate like sand grains, blocking the path, then what is guarded cannot be encouraged; what is tested cannot be stopped. Things depend on each other; touching kinds causes troubles; the gaze of heaven and man, how can it be a mere moment? The officials reward cultivation, the test is in daily renewal. Jia recently brought this book, entrusting it to the diligent; it can be said to have feeling, yet not to pass Liang, seeming like a deceit.

On July sixteenth, this line also has a clerk’s writing. Reflect on what is asked; have heart. You hope to face mountains and increase distant thoughts, gladly accepting and turning, often seeing this meaning. For Daoists, diligence is sufficient; if there is feeling but no diligence, nothing can be done; diligence but not focus, also cannot succeed. One must let the cup open wide; this later character is darkened and defiled, no longer recognizable. Quickly open and scatter; this also seems to be the Eastern Minister’s advice to the Prefect. Why not often visit Eastern Mountain, gazing at the three peaks, wandering the pavilion, eyes seeing forest and water, judging others’ past, hardly anything further to benefit.

Southern Mountain Lady said to disciples.

Speech is the total ruin of nature and life; faith is the hinge of gain and loss. Zhang Liang’s three stages may be called steadfast in Dao and clear in heart.

Southern Mountain Lady said to disciples.

Nature is very broad and kind but hears urgently; responding quickly to things is more contrary to the purpose. The matter of fire jujubes is not yet suitable to ask. Discussion of fire jujubes is later.

Jiuhua True Consort said.

From Taiyuan onward, five lines, with Yang’s writing.

Driving the scene to Canglang, leaping to the clear sea ferry. Scarlet smoke disturbs the sun, feathered canopy tilts the nine heavens. Cloud chariots float in the empty cave, sudden wind and waves inquire. Coming to seek friends in the dark, accompanying Emperor Chen. Prince Xiemingde, together inviting jade sages. Looking down to the eight palaces, resting in rare forests’ peak. Washing this purple jade fat, thus knowing the bitterness of the filthy mire. Where will the good person rest? Diligence is needed to be close.

On the evening of July eighteenth, Canglang Right Heroine Lady transmitted a poem. This poem relates to the Prefect and also mentions the clerk.

Joyful and hopeful in rare forests, roaming far without boundary. Desolate beyond images and numbers, being and non-being naturally the same. Diligent and harmonious virtue rhymes, drifting lightly stepping the vast sky. Lingering freely on waves, ringing bells scattering in the wind. Within reflecting the seven path observatories, able to forget all. Why must one repeatedly respond, awaiting worldly writings? The mysterious heart should awaken by itself; be silent and surely follow high traces.

On the evening of July twenty-sixth, Purple Microcosm Lady transmitted a message, ordering it to Prefect Xu.

Crimson Pavilion gates wide in the sky, opening vermilion to the scene chamber. Purple banners wave in clouds and mist, feathered morning strokes the eight winds. Stopping the canopy to wash in the blue creek, gathering refined moon branch peaks. Chewing the three spiritual flowers, breathing out the nine divine rays. Countless great immortals rise, scattering in the dust and mist. Lingering in the bright true hall, looking up to the supreme emperor. Northern Jun singing to feathered people, jade mysteries shining among the worthy. Cloud river waves and winds, gain and loss are my bell. Raising the neck within the noisy court, opening the heart to plan against filth and chaos. Practicing to avoid the domain of honor and disgrace, rarely stepping in rare forests’ palace. One calm is enough; try to see Canglang.

Right Heroine Lady transmitted this.

From the scene driving come three pieces, with Prefect’s writing.

Weak loss in the cave harbor, earnest spirit not yet complete, leaning and resting on different causes, the cloud ladder not yet raised. Though having desire for progress, still not deep in ultimate principle. Your talent is truly heaven-made, condensing waves in clear melody, intending to dwell spirit in the great mystery, hoping for the purple court and stepping the void. With heart opening to flying and stagnation, soft feathers flourishing in the mysterious contract. Movement follows rules and compass, equal circle and different square, stillness harmonizes true flavor, breathing and exhaling to arouse sound; this may be called lofty virtue rising, truly admirable. Yet filthy thoughts not open, petty and tangled, licentious thoughts not gradually gone, spirit pool not clear, will not yet reach the time to discuss inside and outside, only floating the two scenes’ crossing. The precious thing is to be able to change, to release feelings and attachments; now no harm. Though temporarily silencing many voices, thus able to harmonize. The previous phrase should be “you” character, distant; this is not one case, many threads of leakage, always a secret battle; if feelings have faults and scatter, losing with events, subtle words of enlightenment; how to stop it? How to send it away?

On the night of July twenty-sixth, Canglang Right Heroine Lady transmitted this message to Prefect Xu; do not reply.

One line written by the Prefect.

Worldly treasures fragrant and abundant, Dao’s root mysterious and high assembly. Shaking robes seeking dark fields, turning chariots at dust and wind’s edge. Good virtue shines in spirit’s radiance, bright root gathering splendid growth. Secret words bring many blessings, pure and clean still precious. Constant and unchanging in image and pattern, hand in hand sharing quilt and sash. Why engage in worldly affairs, daily bringing harm? 

On the evening of July twenty-eighth, Right Heroine Lady transmitted this poem to Prefect Xu. In December, the Prefect replied: “The metaphor of constant and unchanging is the response to this poem.” Constant and unchanging is from the *Zhou Yi*. One poem written by the Prefect.

Clear sounds scatter in emptiness, spirit winds sprinkle the forest, body transcends the dark path, will chants spiritual sounds. Benevolent Lord is the person. I wish to show Pei True Man’s full record to Xie; surely it will harmonize; the mind not well guided is also revealed inside. Who is Pei True Man? There are those who have passed the seven scriptures, thus showing it.

On the evening of August seventh, Right Heroine Lady transmitted a letter, ordering it to Prefect Xu.

One line with Yang’s writing, also written by the Prefect.

Guarding truth as one, steadfast for a year, preventing white hair, baldness regrown. The body connects inside to children and grandchildren, externally encompassing royal affairs, friends’ relations, ears and eyes widely used, voice and breath mixed in servitude; this too is not exclusive Dao. True talents mostly live in seclusion, dwelling in mountains and forests, far from the world and embracing blandness; thus must have infant face and mysterious temples.

Jade nectar and golden wine, crossing pear and fire jujube trees—these are medicines for soaring flight, not like the Golden Elixir. Benevolent Lord’s body is not truly genuine, filthy thoughts fill the chest; I fear these things will not come. If true sincerity is not unified, the Dao is also without self; it should not be asked. The fire jujube and crossing pear trees have already grown in your heart; yet thorns still mix in the heart, so the two trees are unseen and unclear. One may prune the thorns, bring forth the tree, bearing only fruit; almost good.

Though it is said to ask, the desire is to hope for nearness; one should ask the master leader, asking every three years to begin on this day.

In the year of Chou, these two characters were later added by the Prefect on the night of August seventh, orally transmitted by Canglang Right Heroine Lady, answering Prefect Xu.

Focus heart on emptiness and form, inner observe the cave chamber, embrace mysterious thoughts and spirit, exclusively guard truth as one; then hair does not whiten, baldness regrows. The character “Zhen” should be “Qin,” none have tangled thoughts a hundred times, cold and heat break spirit, managing these duties in this dusty world; those who make the character “fei” are all mispronunciations, not the door or fan of doors. Gates of gain and loss, many worries like this, ten thousand thoughts like this; though having true heart, it is not steadfast, embracing Dao but not practicing, holding treasure but not using it, naturally hoping hair does not whiten, also hoping to hear.

Jade nectar and golden wine, crossing divine pear, Fangzhang fire jujube, mysterious light lingzhi; I shall give these to Maoshan Xu Daoist, not to others, asking Prefect Xu.

On the night of August seventh, Purple Microcosm Lady transmitted a reply to Prefect Xu.

Six lines written by the clerk.

Preparing to ride East Summit people, stopping scene to invite quietness. Benevolence and virtue come riding waves, gathering at the three peaks. Lingzhi can surely be eaten, granting you endless longevity. Presenting true golden nectar, no need for the hundred-foot well.

On the evening of August sixteenth, Qingling True Man transmitted.

One poem written by the Prefect.

Void and harmony can guard the male, desolate can guard the female. The desolate is the single scene going alone. In the crimson palace, the character “ju” should be made to fly up into the sky. Above it is the edge of mystery. The Dao is easy to hear but the trouble is not being true; the scripture is easy to get but the trouble is not practicing. If only this, all true immortals in the great heaven are equals; I also have no blame for those who cannot do it.

The heart unsettled yet wanting to write, as if to sell it. The mind not going yet seeking truth, like wanting to put it on the street. Wish to tell.

On the night of August seventeenth, Right Heroine Lady transmitted this letter to Prefect Xu. It seems to answer the heart’s wish to guard the female’s true oneness.

The ancestor planted virtue and flowers; the old man is the seventh ancestor Xu Zhao. The character “dui” should be “zhui.” Stamping the foot, suspending the carriage, no early or late. Only the heart firmly focused on truth and subtle spiritual mechanism is sufficient. As for high and lofty long ridges, resting in dark forests and marshes, despite worldly difficulties and disdain, sending nine relatives to taste the spirit is truly a fine act. If the heart is not focused, faults fill the chest; though stepping the Langshan to roam, visiting the circular mound to greet the dark, surely will fail. If truly empty, I shall tell you when there is cause for movement; for now it is not yet time.

On the night of August seventeenth, Life Protection Immortal Lord Maoshan Junior Lord orally transmitted to Prefect Xu:

Containing benevolence and guarding kindness, dispelling hidden worries, single-hearted kindness and guidance, dwelling spirit in the spiritual mirror—Prefect Xu is this person. The regret is in responding too quickly to things, inviting the true abruptly.

If vast and lofty void reflection, then can guard the female; having sought, one should be able to guard it; guarding it is easy, perhaps there is nothing impossible.

On the night of August eighteenth, Purple Microcosm Lady transmitted, showing to Prefect Xu.

Four lines with Yang’s writing.

Mu respectfully wears the sound, often troubling to the utmost, humbly receiving grace and moisture, brilliance increasingly radiant, reading with joy and celebration, grateful beyond measure. Mu is stuck in the mundane, does not forget to rise and depart, often swearing in the heart, thinking to climb step by step, examining the Eastern Mountain chamber, dwelling in scenic forests and valleys. This is the will and deed; Mu is cautious and resolute. When relying on the spiritual clan, reporting to the divine rules, if the heart is thus, it is also to be measured. The female true oneness is mysterious and distant, wondrously emerging from secret realms. Mu has not yet cleansed faults and filth, worldly burdens not yet removed, chest and heart polluted, sincerity shallow, not daring to speak. Southern True pities and sympathizes, last spring sent a scripture master to teach the method of the cave chamber’s walking and rules, eight elements and nine truths to gradually cultivate, not daring to say the character “dai” means laxity; the nine truths require utmost quietude, human affairs mixed and confused, the trouble is lack of focus. Ancient people learning the Dao sought masters and friends, accumulating years, traversing mountains and valleys, facing dangers and trials, enduring hardships, then receiving essential secrets. Mu’s virtue is thin and faults heavy, sitting upright in the fault chamber, often seen and recorded by many true ones, warnings continuing, awakening not just one. The ancients said: “Not knowledge but practice is difficult.” The Master’s grace is bestowed, one can slowly proceed; this must be for Prefect Xu to gradually move to Eastern Mountain, then personally transmit the Dao, not counting speed; the grace is great; no limit to early or late; the command is given, wishing to report, respectfully.

The Prefect’s reply to Right Heroine’s words on female oneness, clerk wrote it; later re-copied, so this copy remains.

True Words Scroll Two ends.

True Admonitions Scroll Three

Golden Pavilion Right Minister of Life, Overseer of Water of Penglai, National Master of Liang, Upright and Pure True Man of Huayang Hermitage, Tao Hongjing composed

Chapter on Cosmic Portents, Part Three

Northern Origin Middle Mysterious Dao Lord, Li Qingbin’s daughter, Junior Sister of Jade Gentleman Li Lingfei, received the book as Eastern Palace Spirit Illumination Lady, governing the thirteenth Zhu Pavilion of Fangzhang Platform. The Lady wears purple brocade, bears the Divine Tiger talisman, holds a flowing gold bell, accompanied by two attendants about twenty years old; the Lady is about thirteen or fourteen. One attendant named Yinhui. Attendants all wear blue silk, holding two red jade boxes, bound with blue ribbons, inscribed with white jade seals reading “Most High Chapter” and “Most High Text.” This record of woven seals is the same as earlier Jiuhua.

The Lady wears a blue jade-colored ribbon, like worldly pouches; the hidden seal is about five zhang long, three or four chi wide. Before departing, she composed a poem, then sang:

Cloud pond girds the sky’s structure, seven qi shining spirit Feng. Jade fan opens morning calls, nine sounds in the scarlet pivot.

Purple clouds rise at vermilion gates, fragrant smoke born at green windows. Four chariots dance tiger troops, azure chariots cast the mysterious void.

Floral canopy topples with clouds, falling phoenix controls six dragons. Driving the scene over Five Mountains’ passes, three pure glances at the lord’s chamber.

Suddenly smelling foul stench, ten thousand impurities disturb my chest. Foul things poison the spirit, noisy dust clashes mutually.

Bright kings all crumble and rot, why alone does virtue flourish? High bows bitterly too late, sitting on the ground growing worms.

On the night of August twenty-second, Spirit Illumination Lady transmitted this poem. The Prefect wrote “Spirit Illumination Lady,” while Yang wrote many “Illumination Spirit” characters.

Before departing, she sang:

Heart do not desire disorder, spirit do not be enslaved, Dao is easy yet not smooth, disasters heavy and not reversed.

Return to the Xu family, I shall return again; you diligently strive and that is all.

The above eight lines are Yang’s writing.

Eastern Prince Jinfu Zhou Lingwang had thirty-eight sons; Prince Jin was the crown prince, known as Prince Qiao. Lingwang’s third daughter named Guanxiang, beloved among many, was a Song concubine, a half-sister to Prince Qiao. She received the method of flying and escaping nets from Prince Qiao, entered the outer scriptures as the Wei clan in the mountains, later joined Prince Qiao in Luhun, accumulating thirty-nine years. Guanxiang attained the Dao, received the book as Purple Clear Palace Inner Transmission Consort, leading the Eastern Palace’s waiting true ladies. This is the Middle Waiting Lady. Prince Qiao had seven brothers who attained the Dao, five men and two women. His brother Meishou was Guanxiang’s full brother, also attained the Dao. This seems to be a separate matter of Meishou, now lost; the clerk’s writings mention a dream of a woman claiming to be Meishou’s younger sister, perhaps an answer to this.

Two lines with Yang’s writing.

Riding swiftly through the eight voids, roaming and feasting in the floral chamber. The Mother extends the pavilion view, loudly howling and stepping the spirit wind. I await arrival, thus crossing Canglang.

Right Heroine Lady’s song.

Riding the storm ascending the nine heavens, resting the carriage at the three peaks. Awaiting wandering glances, no waiting thus should be upright. Canglang is not worth toil; who can surpass the mysterious well?

Purple Microcosm Lady replies to Heroine’s song.

Writing my Golden Court pavilion, unyoking the three peak territory. Nightly spirits spread brilliance, chewing and filling great hunger. Singing high without roaming, winter rising with awaiting song. Empty responding to spiritual sounds, no waiting, how to proceed?

Tongbai Mountain True Man’s song.

Morning roaming Yujue Mountain
