# Secrets of Ascending to the True

Title of the Scripture: Secrets of Ascending to the True. Compiled by the Daoist Tao Hongjing of the Liang dynasty. It is a secret manual of the early Shangqing lineage’s methods for cultivating immortality and ascending to the True. Originally it comprised twenty-four or twenty-five scrolls. Now only three fragmented scrolls remain. The source text is from the *Zhengtong Daozang*, Dongxuan section, category of Jade Secrets.

# Secrets of Ascending to the True

### Secrets of Ascending to the True, Scroll One

Composed by the Recluse of Huayang, Tao Hongjing

Transmitted by the Supreme Minister Su Jun of Xuanzhou

Within the transmission lies the practice of guarding the One, fragmenting and piercing through the caverns; the scripture contains the Flying Step Scripture, now nearly lost. These are difficult for practitioners, so detailed annotations are added to dispel doubts and remove obscurities.

## True Talismans

The True Talisman of the Supreme Emperor of the Great Ultimate: all four talisman chapters speak of the Supreme Emperor of the Great Ultimate, who is the Heavenly Emperor of the Great Ultimate, the Sacred Lord of the Golden Palace, the master who first received the Three Ones in the initial study of the dao. The Six Talismans of the Upper Origin, the Five Talismans of the Middle Origin, and the Five Talismans of the Lower Origin correspond to the three palaces of the three origins within the body; each talisman character has its own source of birth. The fish split by the disciple Juanzi revealed this—this is the Supreme One summoning the Three Ones to guard the form. By summoning with the talisman, one commands the One to guard the body, just as the Purple Script summons the Three Souls.

The eight solar terms—Beginning of Spring, Spring Equinox, Beginning of Summer, Summer Solstice, Beginning of Autumn, Autumn Equinox, Beginning of Winter, Winter Solstice—are the starting days, each regarded as a beginning. Written in vermilion ink at dawn facing the ruler, one swallows a talisman. After completion, bow twice and offer wishes as one pleases. Initially, on the day of Beginning of Spring at dawn, facing the Tiger direction, write on white paper in vermilion ink starting from the first talisman of the Upper Origin, hold with the left hand and offer the blessing; after blessing, swallow it; after swallowing, bow twice again. One may also draw sixteen talismans and cut them, placing them aside; each dawn take and swallow one, preserving the talisman of the Upper Origin in the upper palace, the Middle Origin in the middle, the Lower Origin in the lower, all accordingly. When writing and swallowing talismans, first burn incense on the left side. According to various scriptures, many talisman swallowing rituals have blessings, but here it says “as you please,” so it is not mandatory. One may also compose four-character rhymes, taking the purpose of summoning and greeting as the blessing, which is separately established.

Wear it on the head, contained in a brocade pouch; do not tread on dirt or collapse it. After five years, one meets the True One. Wearing the talisman also begins with guarding the initial day, the dawn of Beginning of Spring. After drawing the talisman, before swallowing, write again the three origins’ talismans on plain white paper in vermilion ink, cut into three pieces, hold each and bless; after blessing, roll them together into a purple brocade pouch, wear on the head; only then swallow one talisman. This is only done at the Beginning of Spring; then one may meet the True One. Other solar terms need not be repeated except for reissuing the talisman for wearing.

Swallowing talismans begins with the eight solar terms, sixteen per day, stopping after one day; for later terms, swallow as at the start. Each solar term’s dawn is the beginning; thus there are sixteen talismans. When all are swallowed, stop. One solar term is forty-five days apart; one qi (vital energy) is fifteen days apart; thus from the solar term swallow the talisman, completing the proper qi day. After June, preserving the middle Dipper, it is not allowed to not swallow talismans. This only enumerates the eight solar terms, as later mentioned four terms with one blessing; it means one must wear talismans, so it avoids the Summer Solstice and Beginning of Autumn.

## Precious Seals

The Precious Seal of the Supreme Emperor of the Great Ultimate was bestowed by the Azure Youth Lord of the Eastern Sea to Juanzi, to seal and govern the sacred mountains. This too was obtained by splitting the carp fish, though not spoken of before, as the earlier talisman already explained it. Written in vermilion ink on plain paper, wear it on the left elbow; do not let it get wet. Wear it for eight years, and the Three Ones will all be seen. After finishing wearing the three origins’ talismans in white paint, again facing north, write on plain paper like a long and broad golden plaque, hold with the left hand, bless as you please; after blessing, roll into the purple brocade pouch, wear on the left elbow; wearing this seal also leads to meeting the True One. If the Beginning of Spring falls in the twelfth month of the old year, still write and wear on that day, until the first day of the first month when it is replaced.

Do not tread on dirt or corrupt the seal; now, if bending or moving carelessly, one may forget or err. One may guard the One for a time, wear it, and after matters are concluded, remove it and place it in the bed or utensils. It is said after eight years the Three Ones are all seen; earlier talisman said five years to meet the True One, so not all are fully seen. When it says meeting the One, it means not only seeing the Three Ones within oneself, but also the Three Ones of the Supreme Purple Tenuity Emperor, who descend to meet and teach the disciple. Therefore, one must first diligently guard this accumulation before being able to sense that One.

On the first day of the first month at dawn, write a talisman in blue ink; this too is a precious seal. After wearing it, it is called a talisman; engraving it on gold and wearing it as a belt seal is then a seal. The seal is like a signet, with fixed dimensions, not to be damaged; talismans are like edicts of kalpa, their size can be infinite, but now the small seal is reduced from the talisman. Every year on the first day wear it, until meeting the One, then stop. Use fine dark blue or dark green, finely ground, washed with water to remove metallic harshness, then mixed with glue, thinly written on white paper, not thick; indigo blue may also be used. Facing north, bow twice, swallow it; after writing facing north, hold with the left hand, bless, bow again, then swallow; also store it in the upper palace. Whenever wearing talismans to summon and inform the body spirits, one must bow; if informing external spirits, no bowing is needed; this is the general rule.

After meeting the Three Ones, write on gold, nine inches long, four inches wide, three-tenths of an inch thick. Gold should be pure gold; the quality refers to the material on which the main inscription is engraved. Such a method requires tens of pounds of gold, not something a Daoist can manage. Silver may also be used, called white gold, so both can be used. The engraved characters are like seal script, all written left to right, using ancient measurements. It seals and governs the mountain and river demons, commanding the true essences of the Five Great Mountains. The sequence of seasonal commands is taught by the Three Origins’ True One Lord themselves. The sealing and commanding is to have servants and agents; the method is not yet revealed; one must meet the Three Ones to receive instruction. This matter comes from the *Supreme Primordial Spirit Scripture*. This true scripture has not circulated in the world; it is the root of guarding the One.

## Nine Palaces

All heads have nine palaces; first, let us explain them. They are arranged for application in cultivation. Between the eyebrows, upwards three fen (one-tenth of an inch) is the guarded cun (inch) double field, facing the nose straight up, the lower boundary one cun above the eyebrow. The “retreat” means backward, entering the bone boundary; all within three fen inside the bone is the guarded cun domain, including the Terrace Gate within it; the Bright Hall is only the remaining seven fen. Having established one cun in the middle, with both sides arranged, it is called the guarded cun double field. On the left is the Azure Chamber, on the right the Purple Gate; two spirits dwell here. Retreating one cun is the Bright Hall Palace; on the left is the Bright Youth True Lord, on the right the Bright Maiden True Lord, in the middle the Bright Mirror Spirit Lord; three spirits dwell here. Retreating two cun is the Grotto Chamber Palace; although the head is connected as the Grotto Chamber, this is the true center of the Grotto Chamber; on the left is the No-Shadow Lord, on the right the White Origin Lord, in the middle the Yellow Elder Lord; three spirits dwell here.

Note that “retreating one, two, three cun” means continuing from the eyebrows as the base, not adding one cun after three fen backward. Some say one must retreat three fen to guard the cun, or one cun to get the Bright Hall, but is that so? We cite examples for reference. According to the Five Celestial Method: the Stationary Star is in the Yellow Chamber Long Valley, which is in the Philtrum; the central line enters two fen; the star seems suspended above. The chamber is small but the star is large, so the rest extends on the skin. If entering two fen is the Yellow Chamber, how could the star be outside? It also says entering one cun and opening one cun square is enough to assist the Bright Hall. The scripture also says one cun above the Bright Hall is the Heavenly Court Palace, which is above the Bright Hall, within the outer retreat one cun; it is not necessarily exactly one cun above the Bright Hall. Since the forehead is already steep, it differs by three fen degree backward above the Grotto Chamber; its palace’s front entrance is still in the middle of the guarded cun, where the Upper Purity True Maiden dwells. One cun above the Grotto Chamber is the Supreme True Palace, retreating two cun; the Great Ultimate Empress dwells here. One cun above the Dan Tian is the Mysterious Elixir Palace, retreating three cun; also called the Mysterious Elixir Brain Essence Grotto Palace, where the Central Yellow Taiyi True Lord dwells. One cun above the Flowing Pearl is the Supreme Emperor’s Palace, retreating four cun; where the Supreme Lord and Lady dwell.

One cun above the Bright Hall is the Heavenly Court Palace; this is again above the Bright Hall, within the outer retreat one cun, not necessarily exactly one cun above the Bright Hall. Because the forehead is steep, it is offset by three fen degree backward above the Grotto Chamber; its palace’s front entrance is still in the middle of the guarded cun, where the Upper Purity True Maiden dwells. One cun above the Grotto Chamber is the Supreme True Palace, retreating two cun; the Great Ultimate Empress dwells here. One cun above the Dan Tian is the Mysterious Elixir Palace, retreating three cun; also called the Mysterious Elixir Brain Essence Grotto Palace, where the Central Yellow Taiyi True Lord dwells. One cun above the Flowing Pearl is the Supreme Emperor’s Palace, retreating four cun; where the Supreme Lord and Lady dwell.

Altogether, the nine palaces are within one head, yet they differ in rank and height. The first is the Supreme Emperor’s Palace, next the Supreme Emperor’s Office, then the Heavenly Court Office, then the Supreme True Palace, then the Mysterious Elixir Palace, then the Grotto Chamber Palace, then the Flowing Pearl Palace, then the Dan Tian Palace, then the Bright Hall Office. This is the order of their superiority and inferiority.

The scriptures of the Bright Hall, Grotto Chamber, Dan Tian, and Flowing Pearl palaces are all the dao of the true beings of the immortals, passed down in the world. The Bright Hall currently only has the *Preservation and Visualization Scripture*, with little blessing method, suspected incomplete. The Grotto Chamber is the current advanced inner scripture, only one text recited, with no preservation use; its dao has circulated but no true original seen. The Dan Tian scripture is the dao of guarding the Three Origins’ True One; its root comes from the Primordial Spirit, and its matters are complete here, nothing lacking. The Flowing Pearl scripture says it is the method of the Great Ultimate Lords of Life and Fate, the middle and lesser lords also receive it; though said to be transmitted, the world has never seen it. Therefore the middle lord says: “Diligent and unceasing, I shall give the Flowing Pearl truth; this is also the highest path of the middle truth.” This speech seems to be a parable to encourage guests, not necessarily received.

The Mysterious Elixir Palace scripture is also the essential words of the True Officials of Life and Fate, the leader of the four palaces. This scripture must be told by the Supreme Emperor of the Great Ultimate, granted at times. The Mysterious Elixir scripture is the later of the Three Ones; its root also comes from the Primordial Spirit. This dao is profound and subtle; though in the same scroll as the Three Origins, it is the last teaching of Master Su to obtain the True Official. Thus Ziyang wrote of this matter and recorded it later; originally it was not a single scripture. Their oaths differ in category; when receiving transmission, one need not receive it together with the Three Ones. The Mysterious Elixir scripture says: “Guarding the Three Ones day and night is complete, then the unpreserved is attained.” So the Mysterious Elixir family may guard the One first; the One family need not know the Mysterious Elixir.

All combined five palaces’ dao circulate in the world; those with true names have encountered it; unless one’s bones and fate are sturdy, this is unheard of. Many in the world receive this dao, but none cultivate and guard it; the spirits within the body are inferior to other methods. The highest truth’s treasured secret is enough as a career. Now if this one dao is practiced, one attains longevity; if not, one dies. Thus none are called sturdy and upright. Also, the Supreme Emperor’s Palace houses the Supreme Mother of the Jade Purity; the Heavenly Court Palace houses the Upper Purity True Maiden; the Supreme True Palace houses the Great Ultimate Empress. Earlier it was called Supreme True; here it is called True Supreme, two words reversed; unclear which is correct, perhaps a later mistake. Also the Supreme Emperor’s Office houses the Supreme Lord and Lady. These four palaces are all female True One; their dao is higher than the male True One. They have precious scriptures transmitted by already perfected beings; those not yet perfected are unheard of. The essentials of the female True One are not given. The previous five palaces’ spirits are all male, hence called male One; these four palaces are female, hence female One. The nine palaces of Shangqing and Taiwei have True Lords dwelling; thus the human head is arranged to correspond, so-called “void and harmony guard the male, desolate guard the female.” “Desolate” means solitary light going alone. In the world, though not perfected, the chest harbors residue and stagnation, so it cannot be cultivated. The *Five Thousand Words* also say: “Know the male, guard the female.” These four palaces are in all people, but if one does not cultivate this dao, the palaces are empty. If one does not fully cultivate the nine palaces, the palaces are empty, not only the female four palaces. The Dan Tian Palace always has an emperor, the guarded cun always has a great spirit; no need to ask if guarding is necessary to see them. Those who cultivate are immortals; those who do not cultivate die in longevity. Thus ordinary and vulgar people’s bodies all have the Three Ones always present, but cannot cultivate and guard; when their lifespan ends, they depart, and death follows. If one obtains the method and cultivates it constantly, then even the empty palaces receive spirits as needed, not only the Dan Tian’s emperor. Guarding the One is safe; when the lifespan limit passes, there is no longer a death date; upon meeting, one attains the dao. The male and female One spirits, men and women can cultivate both without distinction; only by utmost refinement of essence and bitter effort can benefit be gained. This is called the male-female One; men and women may cultivate both without distinguishing male or female forms. If a man guards the female, he takes female form; if a woman guards the male, she takes male form. But the Three Lords are the essence formed within my body; each must follow their own original gender. The principle of guarding the One requires one or two years of refined thought and bitter effort; one must attain the semblance of visualization, then it becomes easier to preserve and imagine.

Guarding the cun is the beginning method of guarding the One. Searching the scripture’s sequence, the order is not consistent; sometimes the beginning is unclear, sometimes matters transcend order; one cannot fully rely on the original to explain and write. Now it is reinterpreted and arranged in order, excerpting the source and main points. The large characters are all from this text, unchanged, only the topics and threads are arranged in order.

At midnight of the Beginning of Spring, sit upright facing east; the scripture later says at Beginning of Summer face south, Beginning of Autumn face west, Beginning of Winter face north. The secret says this is the method of guarding the Three Origins’ True One, all using the four seasonal nights; after the hour of the Pig, one may begin the practice, each facing the monthly branch; the four beginnings correspond to the four early months, not the cardinal directions; the Five Dipper divisions correspond to the four middle months.

Sit evenly, close breath, gaze softly, grasp firmly on both knees, first preserve and guard the cun properly. Between the eyebrows upward, wrapped are the Yellow Gate, Purple Gate, Crimson Terrace, Azure Chamber, together forming the guarded cun center; left and right ears are within the retreat three fen domain; the Terrace Gate is within the three fen, one cun wide on each side, arranged left and right, each three fen square, opening four fen in the middle as the path, internally connected to the Bright Hall, upward to the Heavenly Court’s front gate. To the left of the guarded cun is the Crimson Terrace, shaped like the side tower of a city gate, made of red jade; the tower’s middle has windows, blue curtains, and spirits dwell within. To the right is the Yellow Gate, shaped like a terrace, square and open, made of yellow jade; the gate’s middle has windows, purple curtains, and spirits dwell within. The nine palaces’ true spirits enter and exit through the Yellow Gate and Crimson Terrace, so the path is between them; the terraces guard the path, managing the extraordinary qi, watching and welcoming the movements of true beings. This is the explanation, not a matter of preservation or thought.

The true spirits’ entrances and exits in the nine palaces are thus; though there are higher emperors commanding fate, they cannot come forward; so two spirits always hold bells to guard, like city gate guards. Regarding the Grotto Chamber, the Purple Gate’s entry is called the Dipper Star, entering through its middle into the Grotto Chamber, not only through the Yellow Gate or Purple Gate’s inner sides; this is just one name. Each palace has front and rear gates connecting. The four palaces above the head open from the Heavenly Court’s front, descending through the guarded cun Terrace Gate wrapped face outward; only the Mysterious Elixir palace has a lower gate connecting to the throat, relating to the middle and lower palaces.

The Purple Gate Great Spirit is named Peaceful, styled Dharma King, on the right side. The Azure Chamber Great Spirit is named Upright Heart, styled Sharp Square, on the left side. These two spirits dwell within the chamber gates, so they are not called terraces. Their forms are like infants, like newborn babies, jade-colored, sitting facing each other. Each wears clothes matching their chamber gate colors: right side purple, left side blue, all are veils, not brocade. Each holds a flowing golden bell, each holding one bell, both hands grasping together. The flowing golden bell is a fire bell, without substance but shining red light, shaped like a flame. These two spirits also have wind and cloud qi within their bodies, brilliantly guarding the guarded cun realm.

At dusk and when preserving thought, if only preserving the nine palaces at night, at first lying down also preserve and bless thus. If guarding the nine palaces at night, before lying down preserve thus first. First preserve the two great spirits’ semblance, close breath, preserve thought fully as before; once in their palaces, it is like seeing them. Call their names thrice, calling in the heart:

“Purple Gate Great Spirit named Peaceful, styled Dharma King, two two two two; Azure Chamber Great Spirit named Upright Heart, styled Sharp Square, two two two two.”

Thus connect qi and softly bless:

“Purple Gate and Azure Chamber, two great spirits, hands holding flowing bells, bodies born of wind and cloud, escorting the true dao, not heeding outside front, let my thoughts sense, penetrate the numinous gate, enter and exit with good fortune, ascend the nine gates, see the nine truths, the Supreme Honored Six Rhythms.”

After blessing, then preserve thought on the Three Ones’ Grotto Chamber and the nine paths’ essentials. The nine paths are the dao of the nine palaces. Those who cultivate only the Bright Hall, Grotto Chamber, or Mysterious Elixir all first preserve and bless thus. The female One’s subtlety also follows this method.

The nine palaces’ positions in the head have two spirits; the left spirit is superior, then the right. If three spirits, the middle is superior, then left, then right. At the start of preservation and cultivation, one must begin from below; thus guarding the cun first preserves the Purple Gate, the Grotto Chamber first preserves the White Origin; the Bright Hall first preserves the left, as females are esteemed over males. Only the Dan Tian and Heavenly Court are my body’s essence transformation, not external ranks, so preserved last. If the upper palace is not below the body, then left is superior, then middle, then right.

## Bright Hall

After preserving and guarding the cun, next preserve this. If not guarding the One, only using this is also good. If guarding the One above, not practicing this is no fault; those who can combine both are better. On the left is the Bright Youth True Lord, named Xuanyang, styled Shaoqing; preserve as male form. On the right is the Bright Maiden True Lord, named Weiyin, styled Shaoyuan; preserve as female form. In the middle is the Bright Mirror Spirit Lord, named Zhaojing, styled Siming; preserve as male form. These three lords jointly govern the Bright Hall Palace, wearing brocade green clothes, belts with four jade bells, holding a red jade mirror in the mouth; the mirror and bells are red and shining, resounding through the nine palaces. Their heads are like infants, forms likewise, sitting facing outward or facing each other, like newborn forms, golden light and jade color. In daylight, all three face outward; at night, left and right face inward. This is the dao of the Bright Hall.

If guarding the One and then preserving the Bright Hall, at this point call each position’s title three times:

“Bright Youth True Lord named Xuanyang, styled Shaoqing, two two two two; Bright Maiden True Lord named Weiyin, styled Shaoyuan, two two two two; Bright Mirror Spirit Lord named Zhaojing, styled Siming, two two two two.”

Then knock teeth nine times, then preserve the Grotto Chamber. If not guarding the One, only practicing later matters, also first preserve thus, then follow later methods.

If the Daoist fears, Daoist meaning cultivators, living alone in the mountains, free from evil demons’ invasion, and when the heart is unsettled or startled, one should use this method. Preserve the three lords, ring the jade bells, make sound heard in the Great Ultimate; each lord shakes four bells, belt with four bells; hearing the sound awakens the ears, shaking and resounding to the Heavenly Great Ultimate Palace. Preserve and emit the red mirror’s red light, shining ten thousand zhang, also feel the mirror’s light issuing from the guarded cun, illuminating all directions, circling fifty li, one hundred sixty-six steps and four chi; wherever one dwells, first step around all four sides; when reaching a certain mountain, village, or border, let the number match; when preserving the light, let the fish stop here, then it is easy. All matters require such precision and essence, not only this one method. After preserving all, call the three lords’ names thrice, knock teeth nine times, then open eyes; all demons submit, ten thousand ghosts vanish. After preserving, call the names and positions in order. This item is the method to repel evil spirits and myriad demons.

If the Daoist is thirsty, meaning thirsty for drink, or perhaps hunger and thirst, also preserve the three lords, and with mouth emit red breath to irrigate one’s mouth; the mouth inhales and swallows; soon one is full. This should preserve and emit red breath in the guarded cun, thick and dense, descending into my mouth; the mouth inhales and swallows countless times, emitting and swallowing, to fullness. This item is the method to stop hunger and thirst.

If the Daoist travels at night and cannot see the road, preserve the three lords, continuing previous matters; thus there are words. Let the mouth emit three fire lights to illuminate ahead; soon the road is naturally bright. This also emits three red lights, like bright fire, issuing from the guarded cun, extending far ahead; preserve and note as if seeing with the eyes; when bright, proceed; when moving, do not rest. This item is the method to illuminate darkness.

If traveling in dangerous places among weapons and soldiers, unable to sit or stand, or fleeing to deserted places, worldly affairs are full of dangers and sudden emergencies; without protection and warding, this method is revealed. Even worldly practitioners may use it, so as not to be without Daoist vision. Urgently preserve the three lords, ring the jade bells, focus the spirit and imagine; preserve and shake the four bells, vibrate the red mirror light to cover and strike enemies and evil places; let their armor encountering this light immediately collapse. Enemies naturally are terrified and daunted, no longer harboring murderous intent. “Cut” means to sever or take away, also can be understood as harm. This item is the method to repel danger and evil.

If the Daoist desires to extend life and not die, when illness approaches and seeks rescue, lie down properly, recline, grasp firmly, close breath, darken eyes, calm heart; first visualize the sun and moon in the Bright Hall, sun on the left, moon on the right, preserve the three lords as before. Preserve the Bright Hall three lords, all kneeling facing outward; at night preserve also facing outward. Though the body lies down, the spirit still kneels long as standing. All spirits within the body have lying forms; preserving here is clear, like guarding the cun Terrace Gate, no turning allowed; thus the spirit attaches to the form and lies sideways, but should imagine sitting. Mouth emits red breath, making light penetrate my body all around; each emits red mirror light qi, issuing from the guarded cun, gradually circling the body. My mouth swallows red breath, countless, closing eyes slightly swallowing; inhale and swallow the penetrating red breath, feeling it enter vigorously, flowing to chest and abdomen. Soon the red breath circling the body becomes fire; fire burns the body, body and fire become one, inside and outside shining through; long after it stops. It resembles the method of soul restraint, letting fire burn through the body’s surface and bones and flesh, like charcoal’s state; this is called sun and moon refining the form, dying and being reborn. When first encountering illness, one should use this method to cure. If waiting for critical illness, fearing preserving thought is no longer precise, then quickly practice at slightest feeling. This item is the method to cure disease and dispel illness, to be practiced at any time.

Also, if done at dusk lying down, one will surely live long without death. Doing it every evening to seek longevity, though not a high method, it only prevents death; it is a minor but observable dao. This item is the method to cultivate longevity, commonly used by the Bright Hall family.

Also, preserve swallowing red breath several times, making one’s complexion become youthful, like a child; this is the method of not dying. It is not for curing illness; at dusk lying down preserving thought, one should always preserve swallowing red breath, also preserve the three lords’ mouth emissions, issuing from the guarded cun, descending into my mouth, swallowing. This item is the method of returning youth.

The essentials of the Bright Hall are complete. All these Bright Hall matters have seven items, fully covering all methods, except for the matter of blessings. According to the usual true dao, it is also the Bright Hall family method; preserving and blessing is especially detailed, and it is feared the Bright Hall has another great scripture; this transmission is probably an excerpt.

Upon rising, always swallow saliva thirty times, wipe face and rub eyes with hands as routine; preserve saliva as red nectar. This item is to coordinate with Bright Hall family matters. “All” means practicing the Bright Hall longevity method, every dawn should do so; also can be combined with guarding one family use; though both methods are practiced, they are one practice.

## Grotto Chamber

One should also practice the Grotto Chamber along with guarding the cun and Bright Hall; then one attains the Dan Tian; thus it is said to practice together, not to skip the middle. Within the Grotto Chamber is the Yellow Gate, Purple Gate, and Mysterious Essence Chamber, the usual dwelling place of the Three Ones’ honored lords within the body. These Yellow Gate and Purple Gate are not the guarded cun; they belong separately to the Grotto Chamber Palace, like the Mysterious Elixir’s Purple Chamber and Green Room. The upper lord also sometimes enters here; the jade character stored here is so. The middle and lower Two Ones do not dwell here; this refers to the Three Ones, collectively called honored lords, meaning the emperor lords of the Three Ones. Practicing both together, seeing one spirit is faster. Since many are preserved, the response is also swift.

The Grotto Chamber True Lords must guard the One as the root, from outside to inside, from beginning to end; the root comes from the One. The True One must have the Grotto Chamber as a canopy, its radiance covering and shading to complete the dao. Thus the Three Ones must be together, the Grotto Chamber must await; though their abodes differ, the dao application must be equal. The dao of the nine palaces is each palace’s use; for combined cultivation, the more the better. The matters differ and do not hinder each other, but the scriptures are difficult to complete and understand, so practitioners tire and abandon; thus no one has grasped even a hair’s breadth.

Within the Grotto Chamber are the Three Truths: on the left the No-Shadow Lord, on the right the White Origin Lord, in the middle the Yellow Elder Lord; three govern the Grotto Chamber. This is the dao of the Flying Truth, separately with its scripture. These Three Truths are the constant spirits of the Grotto Chamber; the Nine Truths are temporary illusions; the White Origin and No-Shadow combine as one truth. Also, White Origin is in the lungs, not entering the Grotto Chamber; the jade character only mentions the Yellow Elder Lord.

End of Secrets of Ascending to the True, Scroll One

### Secrets of Ascending to the True, Scroll Two

Lady Yunlin said: When lying at night, first quickly close the eyes, face east. According to later texts, one must do so at the time of vital energy; thus lying down at early evening cannot do this; after the hour of the Rat, lying down and waking, one may do it; before midday all may count and bless. But beware of facing east, not following the four seasons.

Use the thumb of the hand to press and wipe the eyes toward the ear gate; let both palms meet at the back of the neck, passing three nines times. This is near the back of the palm, starting from the thumb edge, first lightly pressing the eyes as said; then wipe eyes left and right, rub ear gates, crossing behind the neck; then reverse and repeat, three nines times then stop. Within the eyes are purple, blue, and crimson three-colored qi issuing before the face. This is the inner pressing of the three essences, used to irrigate the child. When pressing at the time, preserve the three-colored cloud light, thick and dense, issuing on the face; after three nines times, pause briefly, as if moving the three qi, letting the radiance irrigate the eyes of the child, then repeat.

The yin blessing says:

“Eye child three clouds, two eyes true lords, bright and clear essence, open and penetrate the clear spirit, great mysterious cloud ceremony, spirit graceful and fluttering, protect and benefit the twin gates, open and penetrate the nine gates, all joints respond with sound, morning liquid in the mud pellet, body ascends to the jade palace, arrayed among the six rhythms of the highest truth.”

After blessing, swallow saliva fifty times, then open eyes as usual. Sitting up may be done, not only at night; must be done at the time of vital energy. After about one year, ears and eyes become bright and clear; long practice sees a thousand li, mapping divine spirits, hearing the faintest sounds. This is also the high dao of true immortals, not only bright eyes and open ears. I, the Canglang Fangzhang immortal, always treasure and do this. This dao comes from the *Supreme Four Bright Kings Scripture*, transmitted with a golden-blue oath before practice. Seeking the dao of ears and eyes, none is more wondrous than this method; thus an oath is made before transmission. All matters of guarding, preserving, and blessing must also be sworn to the mysterious master; otherwise no effect; the amount of gold-blue is in the mind of man.

Right, Yunlin reports to Yangshu.

On the face, one always desires to rub both hands, making warm, high and low following the form, all making full circles. First rub and clap both palms to warm, then wipe face and eyes several times; then clap palms again and rub; repeat four or five times; then rub behind the neck and both temples; then rub temples mutually upward, like combing hair, several tens of times then stop. This method is a remedy to restore youthful face and whiteness. This is the meaning of the characters.

Right, from the *Dan Jing Scripture*, makes the face lustrous, no wrinkles or spots, hair not white, pulse not floating outside; practice five years, color like a young girl; called the mountain and river circulating qi, always full and never lacking. This is from the lower grade *Dan Jing Dao Essence Scripture*. Written by the Chief Clerk.

Lying down and rising, no need to rise early; at lying down and first rising, all can do this. Calm and regulate qi, let breathing be slow and subtle; sit upright, facing the month lord’s direction, first clasp hands, then reverse clasp, stretch arms forward; then cover back of neck, tilt head back, look upward, raise both hands, hands compete three or four times; “raise” means lift; after clasping hands covering neck, tilt head back with force and competition, then lower gently; repeat three or four times; should hear neck bones creak. Then move and bend body, release hands, lower head, bend waist, turn back; feet may rise and lean. Stretch hands in four directions, raise hands above head, stretch and scatter to both sides, from front then back together, then reverse stretch. Reverse stretch and side pull means first bend waist and reverse stretch, then clasp hands with body, sway left and right, side pull and shake. Shake all joints; then move and invigorate body, feet, hands, arms, knees, all circulate. Do each three times; such matters repeat three times; this is the formula. It means to move the four limbs; not all can be fully recorded; the formula carefully shows the form and use; the meaning is as annotated.

Right, from the *Great Grotto True Scripture Essence Scene Massage Chapter*, makes one essence harmonious and blood flowing, wind qi does not enter; practicing long, no death or illness. This is the example of the Great Grotto; the scroll title is many, not only thirty-nine chapters; later it says *Great Grotto Essence Scene Upper Scroll*, also *Great Grotto Suppressing Evil Great Blessing*, thus all are not few. Written by the Chief Clerk.

Lying down and rising, first wipe the neck’s four sides and behind ears with a thick cloth or silk, making circular motions, warm and gentle. Rub hair as combing countless times; long after rub both hands to treat face and eyes; all done, swallow saliva thirty times to guide inner liquid. At lying down and first rising, first face the lord and do this method, then clasp hands and reverse all matters.

Right, from the *Great Grotto Essence Scene Scripture* upper section; practicing long makes eyes bright and evil qi not harm, body not dirty or generate filth. Written by the Chief Clerk.

If the body is unsettled, meaning feeling unwell but no pain, then curl the tongue to block the throat, rinse saliva and swallow countless times, vigorously roll tongue upward to block throat, rinse and swallow. Soon the unease illness is removed; one also feels the body relaxed and soft. May also combine with all massage and blessing methods in this scripture.

Right, from the *Xiao Mo* preface. The *Xiao Mo* chapter title is also like the Great Grotto scroll titles, all not few. Written by the Chief Clerk.

Right, so far about thirty-seven matters, including morning worship, nurturing, and daily use.

When passing dangerous roads, among ghost temples, where doubts and difficulties arise in the mind, if the heart has slight fear, instruct the feet to first curl the tongue inward, curl the tongue inside the throat, then bless and stretch it. Swallow saliva three times; then use left hand’s second and third fingers to pinch the base of the philtrum under the nose, inside the nasal septum; thirty-six times, pressing quickly without counting fingers. This pressing is done with the breath counted as one pass duration. The nasal septum’s inner edge is called Mountain Source, also Ghost Well, Spirit Pool, Evil Root, and Soul Terrace. These five names appear in later blessings; thus first reveal their meaning. Lady Ziwei says Mountain Source is the base of the philtrum under the nose, slightly entering the valley under the nose. Using a needle here also treats sudden death. After pinching, knock teeth seven times; then cover nose with palm; keep the hand without removing, knock teeth again; after knocking, cover nose and mouth with palm, fingers to hairline, bow covering Bright Hall. Then facing eyes, preserve the Bright Hall three lords, with ringing bells and red mirror light shining and casting; also preserve the Mud Pellet Red Child Emperor Lord, reciting the Great Grotto True Scripture to awe and command. Then softly bless:

“Red crow soaring to heaven, divine might expanding within, Mountain Source four guards, Ghost Well fleeing, Spirit Pool exhaling breath, Evil Root hiding, Soul Terrace four brightnesses, jade chamber tinkling, jade truth towering, sitting guarding Bright Hall, waving purple haze, head erect morning light, chanting Grotto Scripture, thirty-nine chapters, containing repelling evil dragons and tigers, cutting mountains and ridges, fierce beasts and bulls, biting knives and swallowing blades, raising mountain bells to heaven, divine birds and poisonous dragons, six leaders spitting fire, devouring ghost kings, lightning blocking thunder fathers, controlling stars and flowing meteors, owls pecking and scorching, moving against wind, heavenly beasts arrayed, all beside me, spitting fire ten thousand zhang, to remove misfortune, myriad spirits opening the dao, sealing fallen mountain villages, a thousand gods and a hundred spirits, all bowing heads, Ze Wei holding the censer, burning incense for me, wherever I go, myriad gods welcome.”

Afterward, knock teeth three times, then open eyes, remove left hand; then the spiritual root is moved, heavenly hunters come to guard, a thousand spirits tremble and submit; none may harm my qi. This blessing names divine beasts and spirit officers, thus able to shake off evil spirits.

Right, from the *Great Grotto True Scripture Supreme Inner Chapter*, Great Suppressing Evil Blessing Upper Method. Written by the Chief Clerk.

## Northern Emperor’s Ghost-Slaying Method

First knock teeth thirty-six times, then chant:

“Heavenly Peng, Heavenly Peng, Nine Origins killing child, Five Ding captains, High Sword Northern Lord, Seven Governance Eight Spirits, Supreme Vast Fierce, Long Skull Giant Beast, Holding the Emperor’s Bell, White Owl Three Spirits, Strictly riding Kui Dragon, Mighty Sword Divine King, Cutting evil and erasing traces, Purple qi riding heaven, Danxia brilliant and piercing, Swallowing demons and eating ghosts, Crossing body drinking wind, Blue tongue green teeth, Four-eyed old man, Heavenly Ding warrior, Mighty south guarding evil, Heavenly steed fierce, mighty north biting blade, Three hundred thousand soldiers, guarding my ninefold, repelling corpses a thousand li, dispelling misfortune, dare any small ghost, wishing to come see, chained by the great heavenly axe, cutting five ghost forms, Flame Emperor splitting blood, Northern Dipper burning bones, Four brightness breaking bones, Heavenly plan extinguishing species, Divine sword one strike, ten thousand ghosts collapse.”

Afterward, four-character verses with one tooth peck as rhythm. Thirty-six verses, then three plus six tooth pecks.

If chanting at night or day, it is a constant blessing; no fixed time for practice; at leisure or dawn and night, in places of doubt and darkness, one may chant. Speak softly. Ghosts are blinded and rotten in eyes, and their bodies die. This means killing evil ghosts and all evil spirits in heaven and earth; hearing this they die, not the souls of dead humans becoming ghosts. Such ghosts have eyes; if blinded, they die. This supreme god blessing names the ghost-slaying officers; the chant contains official titles of Fengdu’s underworld and various gods, so ghosts hear and fear death. One named Xu leads the south troops of a thousand men; this repels evil. Flame Emperor is the Hai Emperor; Four Brightnesses are the various lords. The Northern Emperor keeps this method secret; he should dispatch ghost spirits and men; when hearing this blessing, ghosts cannot return; thus the method is secret. If worldly people obtain this blessing and practice it, they will not die. People die because ghosts and spirits kill them; now this cannot be taken, so it is the way not to die. Men, women, young and old can carefully use it; only the problem is not knowing this chant. Those who know it secretly use it, unlimited in size or smallness. This seems to be instructions to the Chief Clerk’s family. When sick, practice this and recover. When ghosts flee, illness is removed. When knocking teeth, preserve and see the five viscera, complete with five spirits, naturally preserved. At first knock twenty-six times, then face eyes and preserve the five viscera, imagining each clearly; all five viscera spirits are inside; then one may ride the proper qi to control evil and command spirits, then exterminate ghosts. Fengdu secretly keeps this blessing method; now secretly given, not to be leaked except to those with dao; all keep it secret. Though not the highest true scripture, it is the supreme art of cutting ghosts; when evil is removed, proper qi can prevail; it is a key method for practitioners. Many people despise its shallowness, causing it to be lost in transmission, making divine spells hidden and ineffective, refusing to practice, which is blameworthy.

Right, Yang and Clerk’s two books.

## Luo Feng Mountain

Located in the northern Gui direction, with ghost spirit palaces above and below; six palaces on the mountain, six palaces in the cave, all with the same names and images. The first palace is called the Palace of the Severed Yin of Zhou, then eastward the second palace is the Palace of the Supreme Killing and Honest Affairs, the third palace is the Palace of the Bright Morning Enduring the Martial City, the fourth is the Palace of Tranquil Illumination and Sin Qi, the fifth is the Palace of the Ancestral Spirit Seven Non-virtues, the sixth is the Palace of Bold Commanding and Continuous Repeated. These six palaces inside and outside share names; the first is most west, then east arranged south-facing; each palace is surrounded by a thousand li; all are the mansions of ghosts and spirits. If one knows the names of Fengdu’s six heavenly palace gates, a hundred ghosts dare not harm. Earlier it said “stone” is the palace name; here and in the chant it says it is the gate name; gates take palace names, so the same title. Ghosts hearing people know these names say these are the palace lords, so dare not harm. Before lying down, first face north and bless thrice, softly. Also slightly incline toward the Gui direction, recite the blessing once, then six times knocking teeth; then bless again, three times only. Blessing says:

“I am the Supreme Disciple, commanding the six heavens; the six heavens’ palaces are my domain, not only mine but the Supreme’s command. I know the six heavens’ palace names; thus I live long. Dare to offend, the Supreme will cut your form. The first palace is the Palace of the Severed Yin of Zhou, then eastward the second palace is the Palace of…”

One recites the palace names in order, ending at the sixth palace. Then knock teeth six times, then lie down. Three times done, then proceed with other matters. This is the lying down method, only one practice.

Repel ghosts and evil qi, at dusk first bless the Stone Bamboo Scripture, then read this section, the Fengdu Palace chant says:

“Severed mark emperor morning, honest affairs build heavy arch, flame like marriage in the sky, bursting like shining flowers, martial sun bearing divine edge, tranquil illumination swallowing clear river, palace gates facing cinnabar well, cloud gates towering and steep, seven non-virtues passing strange canopy, continuous spreading also demons, six heavens across northern path, this is the home of ghosts and spirits.”

The chant has twenty thousand words; now only the six heavens’ palace names are excerpted; it may be softly read at night; it also repels ghosts. Since it has palace gate names, ghosts also fear it. Earlier the third palace was called Martial City; now the chant says Martial Sun; perhaps two names or different meanings, not an error.

Right, two lines from the middle lord. Yang and Clerk’s two books.

At night walking always knock teeth; knocking teeth has no fixed count; killing ghosts and evil ghosts fear the knocking teeth sound; thus they do not harm people. Killing ghosts are those sent by Fengdu Supreme to capture humans; evil ghosts are spirits and demons in heaven and earth harming people. If combined with rinsing saliva and chanting, even better. The immortal method says: always swallow saliva and knock teeth, making one return to youth. Knocking teeth means no external ghost invasion, and inner spirits always guard; swallowing saliva means harmonious qi always full, muscles and marrow moist, thus no sickness and no aging.

Right, middle lord says. Yang’s book.

There are many evil strong ghosts of the lower earth, often appearing as women to seduce and test people. Worldly old strong ghosts are good at shape-shifting, not only women, but according to people’s likes. All cause confusion and indistinction. Beginners’ hearts are not pure and upright, often harboring evil thoughts, inviting these matters; thus one must repel them. If such appear, close breath, think of the celestial gate’s central stars, the constellation image, the ladle, balance, and assistant stars all in the guarded cun; point the ladle finger to the front true spirit. Correct colors, steady will, carefully observe the pearl in the ladle; if the pearl is turbid and unclear, it is a ghost test. One must make expedient approaches near the edge, also look into the eyes; if the child is dim, know it is not immortal but evil ghost. One may also try the bright mirror to reflect it. Knowing the ghost test, think of the seven stars before the face; also may be on the head to expel it. Also think of the seven stars issuing from the guarded cun covering the head, ladle finger forward, strike it; also may mentally recite the heavenly eye and heavenly peng chants. The ladle square and bright means immortal or Daoist. Though not square and upright but eyes clear, also is a virtuous person; fire sun shines on it with no shadow, further proof. The enlightened bow; the unenlightened fail the test; if encountering evil and calling it true man, also a failure; be cautious. These two matters are hardest to distinguish; I discuss them fully in the second scroll’s precepts.

Right, Master Pei says. Chief Clerk and Clerk’s two books.

So far six matters, including exorcising evil spirits and preventing ghost tests.

## Bright Hall Inner Scripture Opening the Mind to Repel Delusions Talisman

Written by Lord Wang, Supreme Administrator of the Total Truth. The talisman is in the sixth scroll’s talisman diagrams and secrets. This is the method to enter the heart’s one cun Bright Hall; there should be another great scripture; now excerpting the repelling delusions matter. Lord Wang is the chief supervisor of the Total Truth. At dawn, facing the lord, write in vermilion, bow twice and swallow.

After bowing and blessing, swallow saliva five times, knock teeth five times; do not let others see. If not using the opening day, use the monthly first day, fifteenth day, and twenty-seventh day; swallow three times a month; in one year the secret talisman is effective. It means no need to know the opening day, just a few days; now one may also use it together. Five or six times a month.

Right, Chief Clerk and Clerk’s two books.

## Eastern Splendor True Lord’s Method of Wearing Sun and Moon Images

This is the method men and women of the Eastern Splendor Palace use to become perfected; thus still wear it. Therefore the sun rays method, the Azure Lord still preserves it. Men wear the sun image, women wear the moon image; never neglect the sun; makes one bright and clear, five viscera produce flowers, soul and spirit refined and controlled, six organs peaceful and harmonious, the way of longevity and immortality. Always at dawn facing east, write the sun image in vermilion on blue paper, hold with left hand, preserve as sun form like a pellet, red with purple rays, then swallow it; swallow into the heart, light shining through. Afterward knock teeth nine times, swallow saliva nine times. Women wear the moon image, yellow writing on blue paper, hold with right hand, also face east, swallow and preserve into the heart. “Returning moon” these two characters are copied from the true original vermilion script.

Right, writing sun and moon image method may also write the sun in a circle. Now there are square and round, and sun characters unchanged; thus should follow this. The purple script Tai Xuan talisman has sun characters written round; since called sun and moon images, it is convenient to depict sun and moon characters. Also ancient books sometimes write moon characters similarly; thus the eight styles of writing are called pictographic. If wearing the round, the characters should be so; all have their own established methods in the talisman diagrams and secrets.

Right, Yang’s book.

## Supreme Void True Lord’s Southern Mountain Red Lord Inner Method

At midnight on the fifth day of the month, preserve the sun image in the heart; the sun enters through the mouth, shining within the heart, uniting with the sun’s light. Sitting or lying at will, first preserve the red sun with purple nine rays, suddenly entering the mouth, directly residing in the heart, enveloped with shining light as one. Afterward, one feels the heart warm, rosy radiance manifests. At first, preserve until the heart warms; long preserve to truly feel the heat; with focused heart imagine, easy to sense effect. After a long time, bless:

“Great brightness nurtures essence, internally refines red heart, radiance shining united, divine truth comes seeking.”

After blessing, swallow saliva nine times. On the fifteenth, twenty-fifth, and twenty-ninth days, repeat the above method. These three days are all odd, also the meeting of day counts. Later it says practice need not be on these days; one may do it daily at midnight. Makes one open and bright, all joints clear, face with jade light, body with golden luster; practicing fifteen years, Taiyi sends the Guardian Chariot to welcome, ascending to the Great Firmament. Another true scripture says: practicing five years, Taiyi sends Jade Guardian Lord to welcome, seeking him is to shed the chariot character. This plainly says Guardian Chariot is the Jade Guardian Lord’s chariot. Practice need not be on these days.

Right, one item from the *Supreme Elimination Massage Scripture*; this is from the *Great Wisdom Scripture* upper and middle sections, copied by the Red Lord, thus called inner method. Written by Chief Clerk, two books.

The Eastern Splendor Palace has the method of wearing sun and moon rays; perfected beings still wear it, preserving the sun image in the heart, large as a coin, red in the heart. “Preserving” means not entering from the world’s mouth; only seeing the sun shape in the heart; though large as a coin, it is not flat, like a pellet, exactly nine fen, pure red. Also preserve the sun with nine rays; the rays are red, not called rays. According to later text, moon rays are white, so sun rays should be purple. From above the heart, down the throat to the teeth, nine-colored purple rays issue, all in the mouth, tip facing teeth but not out; at the time close mouth and teeth; only rays issue from ears, not the sun shape. This is called wearing sun rays. Returning to the stomach, rays issue while preserving the sun in the heart; rays reside in the stomach, shining brightly inside mouth and teeth, long after the rays curl back down throat into stomach; stomach is equally distant from heart and throat; rays do not extend or contract. After long time, facing eyes preserve and see clearly heart and stomach; sun remains in the heart, rays in the stomach, letting light flow and penetrate the viscera; thus the abdomen should be slightly warm. Then exhale breath and rinse saliva; swallow thirty-nine times and stop. “Exhale breath” means at first preserving, mouth closed, breath held; after preserving, open breath and mouth, rinse mouth with saliva, then swallow; preserved saliva is purple. Three times daily at dawn facing east, noon south, feeding time west; all sitting, facing, eyes closed, breath held, then preserve.

Practicing one year removes disease, five years body shines, eighteen years must attain dao, practicing at noon with no shadow, repelling hundreds of evils and disasters. If wearing sun and moon shapes, not reaching eighteen years, this is because rays are small and slow. Sun and moon always reside in the body, illuminating the form; thus no shadow; myriad spirits shine clearly; how could evil dare harm? Always preserve sun in the heart, moon in the mud pellet. It also says always preserving means not appearing outside the mouth when not worn. Nighttime wearing moon light is like wearing sun method; preserve sun and moon need not see their true forms, only inside the room. Moon is used at night, may lie down and preserve; also should be done thrice at the hours of Wu, Zi, Chou. It says always in the mud pellet, meaning the upper Dan Tian’s mud pellet palace; the Mysterious Elixir is also called mud pellet. Also the Mysterious Truth preserves moon in the Bright Hall palace; these are separate uses. Now since in the heart, the residence of perfected beings, the moon should also be in the Red Child’s chamber, fitting the matter; thus made to reside in the upper Dan Tian. Preserve moon with ten rays white; moon color is only yellow; this white is the ten rays of the dao moon, rays white; also clarifies the moon shape does not descend outside the mouth. Preserve moon diameter one cun; from the brain down the throat; the nine palaces of the head all connect within the brain. Now moon is in the mud pellet; thus can be called brain; also clarifies it does not issue outside downward. Also the nine palaces only the mud pellet palace has a lower hole connecting to the throat; when preserving ten rays descending from mud pellet straight down, each five rays issue from one hole into the throat; tip also facing teeth; rays do not issue from teeth but return to stomach. At this time mouth is closed, teeth as before; rays fill the mouth with light; then curl back down throat into stomach; then exhale breath and rinse white saliva thirty-nine times; after, feel the rays in the brain suddenly vanish.

Right, reported by Lady of the Southern Pole; this is the method of true beings, from the *Great Wisdom Scripture* upper and middle sections; those who practice it always see peace.

Lord Wang of the Western City said: practicing this sun in the heart and moon in the mud pellet dao is simple and easy to grasp; no interruption or loss; no blessing words, no need to see sun and moon; preservation thought method is not difficult; in the human world no need for many methods. Removes the three corpses, a hundred diseases, and a thousand evils; refines soul and controls spirit. Sun and moon always shine on the form, so ghosts have no hiding place; form always dwells in sun and moon, so evil ghosts have nowhere to hide; thus no illness. The Azure Lord still practices it; I am that person. This wisdom scripture matter is not only this method; thus the Total Truth also uses it. Practicing this dao does not hinder practicing the precious scripture’s sun and moon method; practicing both is better. The precious scripture sun and moon means the Five Elders’ precious scripture, the purple script three souls’ method; this is the difference between inner and outer, so can be practiced together. Now at dawn and dusk, first preserve and wear rays in the room; when sun and moon rise, then practice the essence and rosy clouds method. Now telling you, telling Yang Jun secretly; only to secretly show those with heart. Let it be shown to the Chief Clerk. Immortals practice a thousand matters daily and nightly; at first unaware of fatigue; diligence in dao is utmost; life must not be lost. Having been called immortal, their body and principle can endure fatigue; this is the meaning of those destined to be immortals. Beginners not yet very pure and strong, their nature easily fatigues; long practice then can be at ease; must not be initially resolved and diligent then slacken. Start little by little, gradually advance; keep one method constant; do not greedily seek many or high. Cultivating dao does not fear many, only that order is proper, not chaotic; so-called not blindly without coherence, practicing blindly without order. Tying bonds through kalpas, now having this life; if this life is lost, then again kalpas; how not be vigorous and diligent to attain constant life here?

Right, Yang’s book.

## Initial Child Supervisor Fan’s Method of Wearing Three Qi

Preserve blue qi, white qi, red qi each like threads, from the east sun descending, straight into the mouth; always at dawn facing the sun; if overcast, also preserve accordingly; sitting or standing at will, facing eyes preserve these three colors in a row; blue on the left, arranged like suspended rays, converging into the mouth, making the roots of the three qi like attached to the sun. Draw ninety times; fullness then stop. One inhale and one swallow is one embrace. Swallow qi into the throat, let it flow to the viscera; when nearing the count, gradually stop. Do this ten years; the body naturally has three qi. It means the body always has three colors of qi issuing from the head. This is the high lord Tai Su’s inner scene method, one of the Three Origins of Shangqing Tai Su Lords’ minor methods. Do it every dawn, facing eyes; vision grows better. The method is rare but effective; Lord Xu may do it. This is the Tai Su method; also let the immortal lord do it; thus not low. Fan’s use is only for the supervisor; his cultivated daos are few, only one method; thus allowed to use this to assist, not to fix the career.

Right, middle lord says. Yang’s book.

## Han True Platform Maiden Zhang Weizi’s Method of Wearing Mist

Always at dawn, in a quiet room where one sleeps, sitting or lying at will; first close eyes and look inward, imagining seeing the five viscera; preserve the five viscera’s form and colors separately as prescribed. Afterward, exhale breath twenty-four times, facing eyes do this. This is because exhaling five viscera’s five-colored qi, making five qi all issue simultaneously; twenty-four times; facing closed eyes preserve the five viscera; after complete, slightly open eyes and exhale breath; let eyes see five colors of qi entangled and rising on the face. It says exhale breath, but here says five colors; five colors are not from elsewhere but from the five viscera’s five colors; making five qi intertwine and cover the head and face. Swallow into the mouth fifty times; facing the five colors thick on the face; after long, then re-enter; also inhale and swallow; feel drawing the five-colored qi of heaven and earth, joining with the face’s; both return to the viscera; all five qi issuing from inside return to their original viscera. The main ten swallows follow lung, heart, liver, kidney, spleen. Afterward swallow saliva sixty times; this is truly swallowing saliva. Then softly bless:

“Great rosy clouds emit radiance, spirit mist moves in four directions, binding qi winding and bending, five colors penetrate heaven, divine smoke contains and opens, golden stone and flower true, dense purple sky, refining form preserving whole, issuing light hiding deep, five spirits transform and divide, unite bright fan of void, timely riding six clouds, protect and guard my body, ascending nine heavens.”

Afterward knock teeth seven times, swallow saliva seven times, then open eyes; matter complete. It says the method of wearing mist; its sequence says mist is the essence of mountains, marshes, water, and fire, golden stone’s abundant qi. Now preserving and wearing is still the five viscera’s inner qi; why? Because exhaling twenty-four qi makes it unite with outer mist; two mists combine, then swallowing fifty times means swallowing mist qi achieving twenty-six passes. This dao is wondrous; many in the mysterious capital of China have this method; you may practice it. Long practice, always ride clouds and mist to roam. Also says: long wearing disperses form into void, uniting with cloud qi.

Right, middle lord says. Yang’s book.

## Du Guangping’s Received Method of Mysterious White

Also called Fetal Essence Middle Scene Mysterious White Inner Method. Always at dawn, sitting or lying at will, preserve black qi in the mud pellet, white qi in the heart, yellow qi in the navel; these three places are called three palaces, also a separate dao of the Three Ones but with different qi colors. The three qi arise like clouds covering the body, each issuing from its initial place, like small beans, then growing large to cover the whole body. Then transform into fire; fire circles the body; inside though fire, outside still has three qi. The body is thoroughly penetrated, inside and outside as one. Fire and qi burn and refine the body, enveloping and shining through. Practice until the middle of the day then stop. Among all cultivation, only the method is long; preserving thought of qi and fire is easy and peaceful; gradual transformation and after refining the body, even after long time, like sleeping, no longer feeling the four limbs is best. Then swallow qi one hundred twenty times, all done. Also preserve and wear the three colors of qi, each forty times. The dao is thus; makes one long-lived and immortal, repels myriad harms. So-called knowing white and guarding black, wishing to die but cannot; knowing black and guarding white, myriad evils dispelled. White and black correspond to the three colors of qi, called mysterious white; this phrase also appears in the *Five Thousand Words*. Especially forbids six domestic meats and five pungent flavors; must have separate sleeping place and quiet thought; especially forbids sexual intercourse, intercourse causes death. This dao is similar to guarding the One but more direct and concise. It is called concise and reduced. Sexual intercourse is more forbidden than guarding the One; guarding the One forbids excess, but not all. Initially preserving qi issues like small beans, then grows to the sky; three qi entwine the throat and body, forming one mixture; suddenly fire arises within the three clouds; also combine radiance to refine the body; the body enveloped, five viscera shining through; this is also an essential dao. The earlier method was brief, so repeated here; preserving thought must be thus. This is the dao of not dying, not yet the immortal dao; may be practiced together to remove myriad evils and repel a thousand harms; practice thirty years, hide form and body, daily travel five hundred li. This dao is very low; practicing it long, if practicing other matters, cannot use it; beginners with shallow understanding should only guard this; not the concern of advanced study. If one wishes to guard mysterious white, must have its scripture; the scripture is also few; should have blessings; this is only an excerpt, like the mysterious truth matter; this dao is still the old method of the Supreme Clarity family. The junior lord now says, seemingly telling Yin Tuo.

Right, life preservation report. Clerk’s book.

Lord says: To attain longevity, wash face and refine heart; when sun rises two zhang, only after wearing the sun may one do this. Face the sun, mouth emit dead breath, nose inhale sun essence; must sneeze from nose then stop; this is qi passage. Mouth always emits four-season dead turbid breath; nose inhales and draws the danxia essence; sneeze soon stops. This is somewhat like the above method but without blessing words. To replenish essence and restore fetus, the way of longevity.

Lord says: To make the heart correct, always at sun rising three zhang, after sneezing, do again. Cross hands on shoulders, left hand on top, no mistake. Use the sun at the heart; this is to correct the heart facing the sun; preserving sun also faces the heart correctly. Heart feels warm, then heart is correct. Also preserve the sun’s essence radiance entering the heart, thus feeling slight warmth. Always practicing is good. It is said some hearts are not correct, easily moved by evil matters; thus true beings make one face the sun to observe; seeing bias, thus giving this method. Generally like sun’s light entering the heart. Now regardless of correct or not, always practicing this is good technique.

Right, two lines from Master Pei. Chief Clerk and Clerk’s two books.

So far about nine matters, including wearing, controlling breath, preserving and noting smoke and rosy clouds.

End of Secrets of Ascending to the True, Scroll Two

### Secrets of Ascending to the True, Scroll Three

## Reciting the Yellow Court Scripture Method

## Bowing and Blessing Method

The *Three Nine Plain Words Jade Essence True Secret* says: in the middle grade there are *Three Nine Plain Words*; Wei transmission has *Jade Essence True Secret*. The *Three Nine Plain Words* should be this scripture, but not circulated; in the world there are forgeries, no such secret. Reciting the Eastern Splendor Jade Chapter *Yellow Court Inner Scene Scripture* says ten recitations and four bows. This scripture here says facing the Supreme, now omitting three characters, then clearly facing north to worship and bless the Supreme; is this not contradicting the earlier meaning? First pay respects to the Supreme Emperor, then face north; the scripture sequence has no blessing method. It means the Yellow Court preface does not say the worship method. According to this scripture’s fourteen characters, it is enough to clarify the matter; why need a preface? The *Xiao Mo* chant also mentions this; worshiping the four directions also needs a separate method. Now the Yellow Court’s secret comes from the *Plain Words*, the high and low grades, seemingly unrelated. The Supreme Emperor is east, should be worshiped facing east. The Supreme Emperor is the Purple Morning Lord. According to *Entering the Dao*, one faces southeast to support the Sang Supreme Emperor’s three essence flying clouds. Also, the Fangzhu is in Kuaiji southeast; northeast is Tang Valley. Also *Entering the Ning Mountain* is in Canglang northeast, Penglai southeast; Ning Mountain is the Supreme Emperor’s domain. Also the Pure Void Lord travels east, crossing the dawn Canglang, ascending Guang Sang Mountain, entering Shihui Court, worshiping the Supreme Emperor. Thus the Sang is southeast of Tang Valley, slightly south of Jinling due east. Also the Jade Register Supreme Emperor has no Purple Morning title; now these words contradict; if must use, then should face due east; thus reciting scripture facing due east, yet still says first worship the Supreme Emperor, meaning east. Then face north to bless the Supreme. Shangqing is north; thus scripture says later face north. First practice the light, then approach the heavy. Ten recitations finished, rise and face the Supreme Emperor bow again. After bowing, kneel and bless:

“Little mortal so-and-so respectfully reads the golden book jade scripture; Eastern Splendor calls it Jade Chapter; now opening the Supreme Emperor and calling it Jade Scripture—is this not excessive? Ten turns finished, begging to ascend the dragon plow; scripture sequence says ten thousand turns to fully see the five viscera only; now having ten turns, begging to ascend the dragon plow, is this against the meaning? This method is not as good as other blessings; starting to issue it easily wastes the divine immortals and lacks the number of turns. Heavenly gods descend, commanding six dings, seven ancestors ascend; I ascend Shangqing. According to the Yellow Court, it only adjusts and harmonizes the five viscera, refines soul and spirit; it is not the method to ascend the seven ancestors. Also the inner Yellow Court only means not dying; how can one ascend Shangqing? Also calling oneself “I” is against humble request etiquette. The flying step blessing mixes names with “I”; this is the blessing of the star’s time, using “I” to oppose the evil; not like now personally facing the Supreme Emperor and calling oneself so. Finished, open eyes, swallow saliva ten times, knock teeth nine times. If ten swallows are ten turns, then knocking teeth should be the same. Now nine times’ meaning is unclear. Next face north, bow again, kneel and bless:

“Supreme Emperor Supreme True, make me ascend to the void; Supreme Emperor Supreme True, not the Purple Morning’s eye, make me ascend to the void.” Same as before’s criticism. The Supreme Emperor calls himself “I,” and the Supreme cannot; true method worship blessings only say names, no “I” or “I” examples. Pure fasting and bathing, reciting golden book, Supreme calls it lute heart Yellow Court, then speaks of the Sang’s eye; how come both blessings contradict? Seven mysteries spread, worship the imperial residence, recite Great Grotto ten thousand times, seven ancestors then attain the nine palaces’ immortals; now reciting Yellow Court ten times, then begging to feast at imperial residence—is this not excessive? Prolonging life and longevity, inscribing names and talismans. First begging to ascend the void, then begging for longevity; first attain high truth, then return to earth immortals? Finished, facing eyes knock teeth nine times, swallow saliva ten times. Earlier open eyes, later facing eyes; knocking and swallowing methods reversed; two methods not different, but up and down reversed; overall, all violate true rules; perhaps later students of shallow talent arbitrarily established this, unable to explain the matter, causing many errors and contradictions; passed down with differences, none can verify. Now beginners, if wanting to follow this, it is not harmful; only if my mind is not clear; if must observe with eyes, true scriptures do not discuss it. After all is done, return to usual scripture recitation.

## Separate Method of Preserving Spirit

Pure Void True Lord says: all cultivating the *Yellow Court Inner Scripture* should follow the Emperor Lord’s method of filling spirit, mixing and transforming the mysterious truth. According to Master Pei’s learning and received teachings, all include Yellow Court family matters. This says Emperor Lord fills spirit, mixes and transforms mysterious truth; this is a fake scripture in the world, secretly using the *Purple Degree Flame Light* scroll’s method; its spirit forms, lengths, blessings all the same; then again faking to establish fake, extremely erroneous. Now it is still recorded here, fearing later students and descendants will take it from other places without knowing true or false, calling it essential secret; carefully practicing preservation, then confusing and mixing, causing loss of truth; thus revealing its falsity for enlightenment. After reading, finish ceremony and blessing; sit upright facing east, facing eyes preserve the body spirit’s form, color, length, and size; call their names, then fill the original palace. Not practicing this method, even reciting ten thousand times, true spirits do not guard, no effect, also wastes qi and fatigues spirit, no benefit to life and fate. Now excerpting scripture essentials to show. The Yellow Court preface already has reciting method; if these two matters unknown, no effect; thus also explain; then discuss fear of disease and encountering filth, but not reaching this spirit lord. Lord Wang surely wishes to clearly instruct. Scripture so, principle not fully convenient; none can practice; thus no one can cultivate.

Sit upright, facing eyes, knock teeth thirty-six times, then preserve spirit; not a great exorcism blessing, but later four nines knocking teeth preserving spirit; such is not in scripture examples. The characters of spirit issuing are: Great Origin, form length two cun one fen; brain spirit essence root character mud pellet, length one cun two fen; eye spirit brightness upper character Yingxuan, length three cun; nose spirit jade ridge character Lingjian, length two cun five fen; ear spirit empty space character Youtian, length three cun one fen; tongue spirit communicating fate character Zhenglun, length seven cun; teeth spirit peak startled character Luo Qian, length one cun five fen. Above are seven spirits of the face; all wear purple clothes and flying silk skirts, infant forms; preserve carefully and arrange on one face, each filling its office. According to scripture, seven names, two eyes and two ears, actually nine; not like eight scenes, each according to its eye position. Thus scripture says: mud pellet nine truths all have chambers, one cun square within, all wear purple clothes and flying silk skirts; this is the previous nine spirits. If so, these nine officials’ nine truths, then purple clothes and silk skirts should not be wrong. Those with consciousness, seeking here, can know all true and false diseases. Also says not separate but all reside in brain; but here says arranged on one face, also arranged by hair, brain, eyes, nose, tongue, five spirits’ lengths; all secretly using upper scene method. Ear and teeth two spirits do not exist there; thus falsely establishing length numbers; who dares do so? Afterward knock teeth twenty-four times, swallow breath twelve times; these numbers contradict the seven spirits’ theory. Bless:

“Spirit origin scatters qi, binds qi into spirit, separates front and back, governs mud pellet, supports up and down, seven spirits arrayed, flowing form changing, loving and nourishing essence source, guiding eight spirits, ascending to the cave gate, guarding the body stepping the light, ascending to the imperial morning.”

This blessing also takes from the eight scenes; the eight scenes’ spirits are the middle scene method of Shangqing; now wanting to guide them below to govern the high? Next think of the heart spirit Dan Yuan character Shouling, length nine cun, red brocade flying skirt; lung spirit bright character Xucheng, length eight cun, white brocade clothes yellow belt; liver spirit dragon smoke character Hanming, length seven cun, blue brocade cape; kidney spirit mysterious dark character Yuying, length three cun six fen, blue brocade clothes; spleen spirit constant presence character Hounting, length seven cun three fen, yellow brocade clothes; gallbladder spirit dragon shining character Weiming, length three cun six fen, nine-colored brocade green skirt. These clothes all take names from the scripture; spirits’ lengths also middle scene method, but gallbladder reduced one fen, liver one cun; perhaps to show difference. The six palaces’ true spirits reside within the five viscera’s six palaces. According to this, these are the five viscera spirits; gallbladder only has one. What is called six palaces’ true spirits means residing within the five viscera palaces. Scripture says six palaces, collectively called six palaces; no spirit palaces named. Also scripture says all operate within the heart; thus cannot each be within the five viscera palaces. Scripture later clarifies six places, some spirits or children; three upper, three middle; all show clothes and belts; not all five viscera spirits. Forms like infants, colors like splendid children; preserve carefully, arrange on one form, arrange on one form; greatly contradicting all residing in the heart. Knock teeth twenty-four times, swallow breath twelve times; bless:

“Five viscera six palaces, true spirits all return, governing the red palace, following up and down, golden chamber red child, facing four doors, dark chamber mysterious gate, spirit hall knot mechanism, mixing and transforming life spirit, true qi subtle, preserving and binding the Dan Tian, shining with the sun, joining the eight scenes, uniting form and ascending to fly.”

According to twenty-four spirits, each five viscera and six palaces has spirits; now these merge the viscera palaces, called all returning; this is contradictory. Also the Bright Hall Three Elders scripture all show matters; the middle section is the Yellow Court’s master; now none preserved or blessed; how can it be used to preserve thought and ascend to void? 

Ziwei says: Long ago Meng Guang recited the Yellow Court, cultivated this dao eighteen years; Yellow Court True Lord descended; searching among immortals and men and women, none like Meng Guang; only Liang Hong took a wife, calling her Meng Guang. After ten thousand turns, the Yellow Flower Jade Maiden should tell the child’s feelings. This Yellow Court True Lord, what kind of god is it? If the lower Yuan King alone descends and appears, lightly establishing this saying, not speaking of today’s touchpoints, future children should take this as a warning; this is extremely subtle. The Yellow Court secret is all about the spirits within the form; also may be thought of from morning to evening, always think and never forget, no need to wait for scripture recitation; keep it secret.

Right, this ceremony and blessing, and two methods of preserving spirit, all passed down from the Eastern Jin but no such book. If said to be secret, looking at its words and matters, it is shallow and superficial; surely boastful and competitive people fabricated this, imitating fake scriptures, constructing this secret, just recording to mark true and false. Overall, the earlier ceremony and blessing is a small victory; this preserving spirit text is long, redundant, mediocre, very poor; suspected to mislead later students; its harm is not small. If I say it is false, I imagine you can find the true original and show it; if it must exist, I shall keep silent and never dare speak of dao again.

## Entering Stillness

Master Zhang Hui, the True One of the Orthodox Unity, Three Heavens Master, tells Lady of the Southern Mountain the formula. The Heavenly Master taught this secret at Yangluo. Lady was already studying and reciting the Grotto Scripture, practicing many wonders, and conveniently teaching the small arts of the Supreme Clarity. Folk efficacy says Lady was once a ritual leader. Though once a ritual leader, now no longer used; why mention it? This is the Heavenly Master’s charge, Lady’s teaching limit; thus making it public to instruct the Orthodox Unity officials. Also low rank cannot teach high truth; thus showing the ritual leader’s role, clarifying related matters. The True One’s meaning, every word and character, has deep meaning; only by careful and discriminating study can one know its principle; blindly reciting and worshiping without understanding is like burying gold in the earth; using analogy is fitting.

The entering stillness chapter’s petitions and healing methods are indeed the supreme classic of clarity and power; not something a mere ritual leader can overhear.

## Entering Stillness Method

This text does not clearly show entering stillness meaning; later it says according to usual dawn and dusk, may not need this; it means dawn and dusk worship or prostration, begging and kneeling, opening petitions and petitions, healing times first do this, then all matters. According to Lady Yiqian, morning and evening should preserve worship and stillness; seems to use this method; since illness makes it hard to act, so make the heart preserve worship; now mountain dwelling in the world may also practice; though noble, now following this wording; probably wishing officials today to do so, not necessarily my current hermit body. If fasting and resting, diligent and high endeavor, may not need to go in person; heart reverence also must not slacken. Later using two morning methods says first worship stillness, then do this. Lady was still alive then; cultivating martial arts, how could she have fully understood Yangluo’s meaning? If then already judged, later should not use or teach judgment; should have another morning stillness method. There are ancient texts from Hanzhong saying entering governance morning stillness method must be this; but now luckily having some, convenient to use; also using Hanzhong method; only early and late blessings and censers should be slightly altered in wording. Morning and evening entering stillness uses sunrise and sunset times; sunrise and sunset do not mean must see the sun rise or set; all are the beginning of rising and setting circle; if petitioning, should use midnight; spirit principle is subtle; thus true beings often descend not during daytime.

At first entering stillness door, gaze at incense burner, first heart bless:

“Lady of the Southern Truth says: close breath and worship stillness, making all ghosts fear; officials and officers, dragon and tiger lords may see and speak; meaning able to focus heart and practice long.”

This means at first entering, close breath and preserve thought, burn incense, open breath then close, worship and bless four directions; after each direction, open breath. Also says: entering stillness door, first right foot steps forward, then left foot; make left foot level with right; then proceed walking as usual, making person open and clear, reaching above hearing. This may not only be entering east-facing stillness; all places wishing to petition should do so; matters of entering the subtle should use right foot. Also says: when burning incense do not look back; looking back offends true qi, causing evil response. This means once entering stillness, must not turn head back. If turning and facing outward, also no fault. After two morning methods, also says: leaving stillness door must not look back; looking back offends true light, causing insincerity. Thus entering and leaving stillness door must not look back. Also says: entering stillness door must not call outsiders or speak other thoughts; entering and leaving door all say rinse mouth. The meaning is all officials in stillness are pure officials, strict and clear; if not according to law, not only no effect but causes calamity. Now carefully describing entering stillness order, established method as follows: first wash and bathe, wear east sash, comb hair, tidy clothes, clean ritual cap and shoes; hold tablet with both hands; no wrapping with paper. Upon reaching outside door, rinse mouth three times; then close breath, raise right foot to enter door, then left foot; do
