# Essential Jade Secrets of the Three Primes of Shangqing

Title of Scripture: Essential Jade Secrets of the Three Primes of Shangqing. The author is unknown, roughly dated to the early Northern and Southern Dynasties. It is a compilation drawn from early Shangqing lineage cultivation scriptures and methods. Master Liu Shipei believed this text to be the missing scroll of Tao Hongjing’s *Instructions on Ascending the True*. The original number of scrolls is uncertain; two versions survive: one, the Dunhuang manuscript P2576V; two, the *Zhengtong Daozang* collection in the Dongxuan section under Jade Secrets. Both are incomplete. Here they are combined into one.

## Essential Jade Secrets of the Three Primes of Shangqing

*(Beginning missing)*

Clad in the garment of the Primordial Seam of Color, the left hand cradles the essence of the sun, the right hand grasps the moonlight, filling my Upper Mansion, the Mud Pellet Palace within. Thrice I call upon the Supreme Treasure True Person; the Great Void supplies the Five Qi to flow essence. Tao refines my body, the Five Flavors in mouth and throat; upward I chant the incantation:

“Most High True Sovereign, Five Emperors of the Great Void, protect my Mud Pellet, the Profound Reflection of Five Forms! The Three Luminaries shine brilliantly, sun and moon illuminate the caverns, flying clouds and drifting rosy mists. Refine and pour the jade essence, temper the visage, preserve the soul and spirit, self-generating, myriad transformations, ascending to the Purple Court.” 

Thus complete, drawing the Five Qi five times, then stopping.

When the Five Directions command incantation finishes, rub the palms, wipe the eyes. Thus for five years, the face radiates golden splendor, the five internal organs bloom, the jade treasury preserves the qi, the path of the spirits and immortals is fulfilled, the Three Palaces all flow smoothly, the true numinous reveals its form, riding the void, soaring in emptiness, ascending by day to Heaven. This is only for secret cultivation; do not lightly transmit.

Those who cultivate the supreme method, reciting the Way ten thousand times, seeking true spirit and numinosity to attain immortality, must on the eight seasonal nodes present the original life mountain of Spirit Piercing to the Jade Clarity, reporting to the Three Purities. If uninterrupted for three years, then one’s name is inscribed in the Azure Palace, bound to the Jade Emperor, guarded by Jade Splendor attendants, welcomed by Golden Dawn. This jade essence true formula is the precious scripture of the Emperor Lords. Whoever obtains this formula will ascend to immortality by the appointed day. To recklessly reveal the divine text invites examination by the Nine Profound Mysteries; the body perishes, form remains, the river source seals forever. Only secret cultivation is true; the Way does not deceive.

## Precious Jade Scripture of the Queen Mother of the West’s Daily Life

Copied by Lady Ziwei

When lying down to sleep, awaken often, then quickly close both eyes, knock teeth nine times, swallow saliva thrice, curl the tongue back into the throat, then shake head and neck seven times, place the hand beside the nose, moving left, right, up, down dozens of times, softly chanting:

“Nine Heavens’ Supreme Emperor, Three Primes protect the infant, Most High moves the splendor, Jade chamber emits essence, seven gates summon spirits, nine rooms receive brightness, ears sharp, eyes clear, penetrating truth and reaching numinosity. Mountain in Heaven’s midst, harmonious qi regulates balance, proud maiden cloud demeanor, bright child brilliance, profound wisdom shining, a hundred pavilions shimmering, preserving harmony and the Supreme Origin, wandering the Golden Court, five viscera shining with splendor, ears and eyes ever alive, spirit platform standing tall, pillars and beams unshaken, seven souls refined, three spirits yellow tranquility, Supreme One holding hands, joining with me, five elders mingled, no flower to assist, myriad evils vanish, myriad wishes fulfilled, sun and moon guard the gate, heart revolves the star of light, immortal gaze reveals, myriad spirits respectfully listen.”

This is the *Most High Queen Mother of the West’s Precious Spirit Daily Life Jade Scripture* supreme method. It sharpens ears and eyes, strengthens memory. Clearing the nose balances qi, preventing mucus and filth. The four directions and eight thoroughfares, the face retains a youthful countenance, controlling soul and recording spirit, repelling myriad demons. This is the True Person’s marvelous Way of daily life. Hence it is called “daily life,” for it must be practiced daily.

The Mother says: When a person ages, the skin first sags below the eyes. Also, if one’s body qi is scant, it first sags between the two nostrils.

## Queen Mother of the West’s Immortal Birth and Deathless Jade Scripture

Copied by Lady Ziwei

The Deathless Jade Scripture says: Hands spread beside the splendor court, prolonging and harmonizing Heavenly Truth, ascending into the divine chamber, jade valley filling the Heavenly Mountains, inner source profound numinous vision, myriad demons cleanse themselves, longevity eternal without death, jade register returns to the Emperor Lord, by the mark and Heavenly Truth, according to this hidden mountain source.

Heavenly Truth lies between the two eyebrows, inside the corners of the brows; Heavenly Truth lies one fen below the ear, the upper chamber that draws the spirit.

The inner source lies beneath the nose, above the philtrum, originally beside it, small entrance into the valley of the orifice; this is the profound spirit’s gate to destroy demons.

The splendor court lies below the two eyebrows, opposite the center of the brows; it is the thoroughfare of clear vision.

At dawn rising and dusk lying down, quickly close the eyes, curl the tongue back into the throat, swallow saliva thrice, then urgently place the hand on these three places each thirty-nine times, pressing downward, do not raise the hand. Make this constant, granting long life without death, summoning spirits and clear vision, sealing and destroying myriad ghosts. When the hand placement is complete, softly chant:

“Most High Void Sovereign, open and scatter the jade court, golden chamber shining bright, emerald terrace flourishing green. I command the three paths, extinguish ghosts and living spirits.

In the time of Duke Zhuang of Chu, there was a market chief named Song Yuanfu, a kind-hearted man who constantly swept the market. After a long time, a beggar came, staying in the market for months. At dawn he begged, singing:

Before leaving, he inscribed on the market gate: “Thus.” The people of Chu’s market did not understand, but Yuanfu suddenly realized, suspecting he was an immortal, though not understanding the song’s meaning. He bowed and asked repeatedly. The beggar said: “I am truly a True Person. This is the Queen Mother of the West’s Deathless Way of Kunlun. Those who know it do not die.” He then taught Yuanfu the essential secret method, which he practiced in secret for twenty years. Yuanfu ascended by day to Heaven, now in the Profound State, ranked as Immortal Minister. The Chu market beggar was the Southern Peak True Person Chi Songzi, who divides form and casts shadow, assuming dust to travel the noisy filth, summoning and extending the dark assembly.

## True Spirit Master Pei’s Explanation of the Divine Treasure Scripture

To seek the essential dao, first make the eyes clear and ears sharp; this is the master of affairs. The ears and eyes are the ladder to seek truth, the gateway to gather spirit; gain or loss depends on them, survival or death hinges on them. Now copying the scripture to show, can be applied.

*Upper Chapter on Dispelling Demons* says: The ears desire to be massaged and pressed on both sides, showing countless times, like managing city walls, named in the imperial register. The nose also desires to be massaged on both sides, only counting the ears, like irrigating the central mountain, named in the Emperor’s record.

These two rules come from the words of Li Fu, the Spirit of the Abode, on the twelfth night of the ninth month.

The Way says: Always place the hand on the small hollow behind the eyebrows thirty-nine times, then with palm and fingers rub below the eyes, lift the ears thirty times, rubbing without fixed timing. Then reverse the hand to ride the forehead thirty-nine times, starting from the middle of the brows, ascending into the hairline, beside the mouth swallow saliva countless times. Constant practice makes the eyes clear and bright; in one year one can write by night. This can also be done secretly at the philtrum; do not speak of its appearance.

The small hollow behind the brows is the palace above the six harmonies, governing the birth of eye brilliance, harmonizing and clarifying essence and light, preserving refined eye spirit. This is the True Person’s supreme Way of sitting and rising, also called the True Person’s constant residence in the inner scripture. The True Person says: “If you wish to write by night, always cultivate constant residence.” The True Person can observe all directions, making the eight horizons bright; indeed, this is the number of constant residence.

Below the eyes, at the temples, is the decision bright preservation chamber, returning the infant to the Way. Lifting the ears is the deep art of reflection. Here the principle gates of blood disperse, skin signs do not arise, eye brilliance shines profoundly, harmonizing spirit and filling vitality. When a person ages, few do not begin with the ears and eyes. Also, signs of aging appear first at the sides of the eyes.

The True Cultivation formula says: Each morning and evening, calm the spirit and regulate breath, then with the hand ride the forehead, inwardly hold the red infant, sun and moon both bright, the three nines begin at the brows, counting finished then stop. This is called the hand facing the Three Primes to strengthen the brain and firm the hair. The four sides of the head are massaged with the hand, following the hair to the knot, only making it abundant. Thus the head’s blood flows smoothly, wind and dampness do not congeal. When all is done, press the eyes’ four corners twenty-seven times, feeling the light clear and distinct; this is the method to examine the eye spirit. Long practice grants seeing a hundred spirits.

The *Red Script Scripture* says: Constantly cover mouth and nose, gaze steadily for a long time, hand produces liquid, then rub face and eyes, constant practice makes the body fragrant.

The *Most High Heavenly Gate Jade Scripture* says: Constantly press the eyes near the nose’s two corners, hold breath while doing so; when qi flows, stop, then exhale and repeat. Constant practice makes the eyes able to see through.

These two rules come from Lady Wei of the Southern Prison.

The *Dan Script Purple Book Three Five Sequential Scripture* says: Sitting, desire to close the eyes and look inward, holding the five viscera, intestines, and stomach. Long practice leads to clear understanding.

The *Great Element Dan View Scripture* says: On one side of the face, always rub with both hands to make warm, high and low following shape, all around thoroughly, making the face radiant, wrinkles and spots not born. Practice five years, color like a young girl, called the mountain and river qi flowing, always full and never empty.

The *Dan View Scripture* says: First warm both hands by rubbing, then wipe face and eyes, then smooth hair as combing, both arms also mutually rub, making hair not white, pulse not floating or large.

The *Great Cavern True Scripture Essence View Massage Chapter* says: When rising and lying, sit with calm qi, first interlace both hands, then pass behind the neck, then face upward, competing with the neck, making the neck and hands compete, doing three or four times, making the essence harmonize and blood flow, wind qi does not enter. Long practice grants no death or illness.

Also bend and stretch the body, extend hands in four directions, open wide, pull sideways, move and shake all joints, each three times. When lying and rising, first wipe mouth and ears with a towel or thick cloth, making round warmth, then smooth hair like combing without gaps, long rubbing both hands to treat face and eyes. Long practice makes eyes bright and evil qi not harm, body clean and not greasy, removing filth. When all done, swallow saliva thirty times to guide inner liquid.

This one rule also comes from the *Great Cavern Essence View Scripture*.

## Queen Mother of the West’s Reversal of the Fetus Massage Jade Scripture

Copied by Lady Ziwei

The Way of nourishing life regards ears and eyes as chief. Excessive looking makes eyes dim, excessive worrying makes ears deaf. These two illnesses arise from within and form disease; not from external guests or false calamity. This is called difficulty hearing the Way, not difficulty hearing the Way itself, but difficulty practicing the Way, not difficulty practicing the Way itself, but difficulty completing the Way.

The reversal of the fetus massage is always done on yang days. The moon’s first day is yang. Each yang day at dawn and night, when lying down to sleep or about to rise, quickly close the eyes facing the original life direction, rub the palms together to make slight warmth, then wipe and press both eyes to the ear gates, making the palms cross and meet at the back of the neck nine times. Then perceive three colors of purple, red, and yellow clouds in each eye, descending into both ears. After a long while, chant the yin blessing:

“Eye pupils three clouds, bright eye true lord, brilliant essence injection, opening and connecting Emperor Spirit, Great Profound Cloud Ceremony, Jade Spirit spreading the text, protecting and benefiting the double gates, opening and clearing the nine gates, responding to a hundred joints, returning liquid to the Mud Pellet, body ascending to Jade Official, listed among the Shangqing.” 

Blessing complete, swallow saliva thrice, then open the eyes. Make this constant; on yang days sitting and rising, always do this. After three years, ears and eyes become clear and sharp.

---

Hair combing is always toward the original life direction. After starting to comb hair, chant:

“Great Emperor scatters spirit, five elders reverse the spirit, Mud Pellet profound splendor, preserving essence long-lasting, left restrains hidden moon, right draws sun root, six harmonies refined, a hundred spirits receive grace.” 

Complete. Always practice this to prevent headache.

The *Great Ultimate Green Splendor Scripture* says: Hair combing should face the king’s place. After starting to comb, softly chant:

“Mud Pellet profound splendor, preserving essence long-lasting, left is hidden moon, right is sun root, six harmonies refined, a hundred spirits receive grace.” 

Complete, swallow saliva thrice. Constant practice prevents hair loss and promotes growth. Count the combings carefully, comb many times without pain. The attendant may comb many times as well, so blood and vessels do not stagnate, hair roots remain firm.

These two rules come from An Jiuhua’s instructions.

---

When sitting or lying, always face the nostrils to the original life direction; eating and drinking likewise. If unable to face the original life direction, facing northeast or northwest is also good. These two places are the gateways of Heaven and Earth’s soul and spirit.

Also when lying down, always shake the body left and right dozens of times, then place both hands behind, lift the head to Heaven, shake left and right twenty-one times, then sit upright and point fingers to Heaven for a long while. Then rub palms to wipe the eyes, near the ears, for a long while, chanting the yin blessing:

“Front strike, back point, Heavenly Emperor upper guest, left glance, right look, longevity and great measure, tilt head and pant breath, Supreme One mutual extreme, reverse eyes and hidden dragons, command life with the pen, drinking and eating the fetal origin, crossing the pass of Kunlun, wandering and turning double avoidances, True Person comrades.” 

Blessing complete, briefly draw qi and close it, holding the red qi in the navel as large as a pearl, expelling it outside and entering the nose three times. Thus the massage method is complete, making all joints smooth and long life without illness.

The *Purple Crossing Flame Light Inner Viewing Method* says: Always desire to close eyes and lie down, calm the body and qi, making the appearance of lying down, so that self and others do not perceive. Then inwardly view afar—listening to the four directions, making ears and eyes focus on ten thousand miles beyond. Long practice also sees affairs ten thousand miles away. With focused heart, one sees a million miles of lying affairs. Also ears constantly hear sounds of gold and jade, strings and flutes. This is a marvelous method. The four directions mean all speech; one should first focus on one direction and inwardly watch and listen. At first it is truly without imitation; long practice the spirit naturally enters marvel.

---

The *Great Cavern True Scripture Supreme Inner Chapter* banishing evil great blessing supreme method says: Whenever passing dangerous roads, ghost temples, places of doubt or slight hesitation, when the heart has slight fear, command the traveler to reverse the tongue inward to the throat, swallow saliva thrice, then with the left hand’s second and third fingers pinch the base of the two nostrils at the philtrum, inside the nasal cavity, thirty-six times. Then press quickly, do not raise fingers to count. The nasal cavity’s base is called the Mountain Source, also Ghost Well, Spirit Pool, Evil Root, Soul Platform. After pinching, knock teeth seven times, then advance the palm to cover the nose, then gaze, and chant:

“Vermilion crow soaring to Heaven, divine might expanding within, Mountain Source four guards, Ghost Well fleeing, Spirit Pool exhaling breath, Evil Root subdued and hidden, Soul Platform four bright, jade chamber tinkling, jade true towering, seated guarding the bright hall, hand shining purple mist, head erecting divine light, holding and chanting the cavern scripture, thirty-nine chapters, containing banishment of evil dragons and tigers, cutting prisons and severing hills, fierce hunting and charging bulls, wielding knives and swallowing spears, raising mountains and seizing Heaven, divine sparrow and poisonous dragon, six heads spitting fire, devouring kings of ghosts, lightning and thunder fathers, pulling stars flowing across, owls pecking and scorching, walking against the wind, heavenly birds forming arrays, all by my side, spitting fire ten thousand feet to remove misfortune, myriad spirits open the Way, sealing the fallen mountain village, a thousand gods and a hundred spirits all bow heads, marshals holding censers, offering incense for me, wherever I go, myriad gods welcome.”

Complete, knock teeth three times, then open eyes, remove left hand. Pressing the Mountain Source closes the Ghost Well gate, pressing lightly the Spirit Pool scatters the Evil Root, pressing the Soul Platform the Jade True guards the gate. Thus the spirit root is moved, heavenly beasts come to guard, myriad spirits tremble and submit, none dare harm my truth. This is the natural principle, making it so suddenly.

---

The Mountain Source beneath the nose is the body’s flaw passage, the true and evil communication palace. The untrue breeds evil qi; the true restrains myriad evils, under my command. Thus good or ill omens arise. The Bright Hall is also the body’s Spirit Pool, the form palace of life and death, the seven souls’ origin chamber, three spirits’ dwelling. Preserving its spirit one can glimpse the inner observation; abandoning its Way leads to decay and rot. Thus I govern it, carefully guarding its defense, generating regret and sorrow.

These four rules come from the *Great Cavern True Scripture* highest chapter.

---

The True Void True Person says: Wind illness arises from hill and grave dampness, three springs blocked and stagnant. Therefore the Earth Official uses water qi to stir, often causing wind paralysis. Severe wind paralysis causes the whole body to fail, mild causes half the body to fail, or loss of hands or feet. Often dreaming of the northeast and northwest, visiting former residences, or seeing the spirit bed place, about to connect with grave qi. The northeast of the grave is absolute death, northwest is nine calamities; these are all ominous grave dispute places. Seeing the deceased there confirms it. Those who often have such dreams should lie facing straight up, knock teeth three times and chant:

“Great Origin Supreme Profound, Nine Capitals Purple Heaven, governing souls and protecting life, High Pure True Person, I wear the supreme method, receiving instruction from Great Profound, long life and clear vision, body flying and immortal, grave forever peaceful, ghost disputes sealed, soul and spirit harmonious, evil qi not smoking, demons and spirits dare not harm my spirit, Northern Emperor restrains, collects qi into the abyss, recorded by the Supreme Emperor, humbly reporting to Jade Morning.” 

Do this twice more, then knock teeth three times; no more dreams of graves or family ghosts will come. This is the Northern Emperor’s secret blessing. Those with good hearts may all practice it. If often plagued by bad dreams and misfortune, all may apply this method; thus ghost qi is destroyed, evil spirits scatter.

---

If the arm cannot lift, it is sunk in wind poison qi in the vessels, binding and obstructing bones; acupuncture is appropriate to cure. Also apply the Northern Emperor’s twisting blessing; if done a hundred times, the illness will vanish. First slowly massage the sick arm with one hand for a long while, then gaze inward, swallow saliva thrice, knock teeth three times, softly chant:

“Most High Four Profound, Five Splendors Six Courts, Three Souls Seven Spirits, Heavenly Gate Earth Essence, Spirit Palace guarding, Heavenly Fetus Supreme Bright, Four limbs and hundred spirits, Nine joints and myriad spirits, recorded by Jade Morning, carved in the Jade City, Jade Girls attending the body, Jade Boys protecting life, forever aligned with two luminaries, flying immortals Shangqing, long with sun and moon, years all after decline, soaring to ascend immortality, attaining perfect peace, flowing wind forming illness, pouring ghost five dragons, spirits and grave qi, yin qi revolving, overwhelming my four limbs, interfering with my rise and fall, Most High Heavenly Ding, dragons and tigers shining might, cutting ghosts and misfortune, wind evil immediately crushed, examining hidden disputes, hundred poisons concealed faults, restoring me to normal, sun and moon shining together, examining offenses, Northern Star collects and destroys, if offenders try, thousand bright supreme might.” 

---

The *Most High Record of Pure Dispersed Splendor Scripture* upper massage method says: Often at the time of vital qi, swallow saliva twenty-seven times, then press the painful place, facing the king, and chant:

“Left Profound, Right Profound, Three Spirits unite truth, Left Yellow, Right Yellow, Six Splendors matching, wind qi and evil illness, hidden and concealed in four directions, jade liquid flowing and moistening, upper and lower communicating, internally dispatching water and fire, dispelling misfortune, long life flying immortals, body always strong.” 

Complete, then swallow saliva twenty-seven times. Constantly so, no illness will arise. Also urgently press the painful place twenty-one times.

The Green Youth Lord’s formula says: At night encountering bad dreams, not a good sleep, immediately turn the pillow and chant:

“Great Spirit Jade Maiden, attending true guarding soul, Six Palaces Golden Boys, come guard the life gate, transform evil to good, report to the Three Primes, grant me long life, ride the light and clouds.”

The mysterious phenomena and spiritual pivot, seeing clearly where to go, heart pure and bright, void and wave divine flavor, chewing and inhaling great harmony, body and qi clear and pure. Thus jade vibrations sound, myriad sounds silently summoned. Qi is the craftsman of spirit brightness, the source of purity and turbidity. In the profound is Heaven’s clarity, in man is the body’s existence. Life and death, loss and gain, all depend on regulation and command. To master the six qi, always face dawn, the time between the first and third earthly branches, following the heavenly time to begin, always facing this direction then. The Great Glow Department shines, Dan Yang births light, spirit brightness opens dawn, vermilion essence reveals beginning. First hold the sun like an egg in the Mud Pellet, then exhale one qi, holding black qi, called corpse qi; next exhale two qi, holding white qi, called old qi; next exhale three qi, holding blue qi, called death qi. Consider that exhaling these qi takes a long time. Altogether three colors, exhaling six qi. Then slowly inhale yellow qi four times, then swallow saliva three times, completing three cycles. Then hold the sun in the Mud Pellet, exhaling from the eyes, in front of the mouth, nine inches from the face, gazing as if seeing it. Then again riding the sun, inhale red qi seven times, after seven times, swallow saliva three times and stop. Then sit up, shake the four limbs, bow and stretch, regulating pulse and circulation. All complete. Hold saliva, must be blue. At night one can also hold the moon in the Mud Pellet like the sun method. If holding the moon, best from the first to the fifteenth night; from the sixteenth to the thirtieth the moon qi declines, heavenly fetus shrinks, not suitable to hold the moon at night. This method is most marvelous; those who can practice become immortals. Thus breathing and holding the fetus, rinsing and breathing clearly, calling the five orifices, the body attains naturalness, soul returns to the scarlet mansion, spirit returns to the Mud Pellet, thus longevity. How unlike those who manipulate the yin qi of the hidden valley, seek the spirit of the running horse, step across seas to seek salvation, drive feathered carts on volcanoes. Can one not be cautious? Can one not be cautious?

This rule comes from the *Queen Mother of the West’s Preface Formula*.

On the night of the fourth day of the seventh month in the third year of Xingning, the Life Controller Eastern Minister came down, seven attendants entering the house. One held a purple silk banner, one a splendid banner, one a ten absolute spirit aunt, one carried the record scroll bag, three held white ivory boxes, inside seemed to be books, one held a flowing gold fire bell, attendants all in red robes. The Life Controller’s form was smaller than the second brother, wearing a blue embroidered skirt, purple fur scarf, lotus crown. The second brother also came to attend and stand. Commanded to sit, then sat, spoke for a long time. On the night of the sixth day of the seventh month, the Life Controller came again, after a long time, the revealed book said: If one must model the profound image, clear and rare times, then withdraw from the myriad hidden algae, fold wings and perch high, sense and taste ascend and contract, abyss stops and mountains stand, desolate jade text, playing with precious spirit life, abandoning worldly attachments, tuning and plucking the clear spirit, clarifying light in the void, five paths manifesting, colors surpassing transformation waves, desiring to merge with the faint, empty caverns and dark avenues, no seeing no hearing, you then reach the distant marvel true, again arise profound awakening, bright virtue inner circle, spirit grasp outer feet, finally able to ride cloud carriage to soar to the sky, writing the Life Controller’s red register only. If spirit scatters myriad thoughts, life unstable, qi follows dust waves, heart not truly settled, only exhausting body and spirit in forest and mountain, truly mistaken before awakening. Its Way is subtle yet easy to seek, difficult yet hard to obtain.

Complete, swallow saliva nine times. On the fifteenth, twentieth, and twenty-ninth days, repeat as above, making one open and clear, all joints fresh and smooth, face with jade light, body with golden sheen. Practice five years, the Supreme One sends a treasure carriage to welcome, ascending to the Great Firmament. Practice as often as desired, no need to do on these exact days.

Also bathe often, especially on Jiazi days, bathe; if not, bathe every month’s first day, making spirit communication smooth. Bathing number is not the concern, but whether one can do it. Wash away corpse stench, true qi enters.

This rule was commanded by the Mysterious Master Lady Wei, to be applied.

The *Most High Nine Transformations Ten Changes New Scripture* says: When treading filth and unclean places, first bathe and wash to loosen the form and remove it. The method uses ten liang of bamboo leaves, four liang of peeled white peach skin, one hu and two dou of clear water, boiled in a cauldron without boiling over, at moderate temperature. Bathe the body with this, and all filth is removed. After removing filth, it also repels dampness, paralysis, sores, and itching. Bamboo is hollow and white inside, peach repels evil and expels filth, so these two are used to remove the dregs and filth inside the form. Since the descent of Heaven and Man, this water has never failed to cleanse oneself. As for worldly talisman water and rinsing, none compare to this formula. If bathing, better yet, but do not use this water for washing hair. The essence juice for refining the corpse is best for bathing the body only. Truly marvelous and secret.

This was commanded by Lady Ziwei of the Mysterious Dragon Feather Palace.
