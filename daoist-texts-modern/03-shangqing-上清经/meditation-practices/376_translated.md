Flowing fire stretches ten thousand feet, golden nets and jade skirts, waist adorned with tiger talisman, head crowned with flowers. Grant me this hidden scripture, to traverse the Heavenly Gate, beseeching to fly as immortal, commanding myriad gods, all directions convene, blessings and virtue as vast as mountains.”

Facing the Four Extremes

“The Supreme Pole’s nine true flowing roots, flying one canopy, entering the Mud Pellet.” Knock teeth nine times in succession. Complete, ascend the heavenly rotation and exit.

The stepping method for shedding the name of death and entering the Jade Register is the same, only differing in usage.

On the right day of the six jia days, the stepper exits, then turns left to descend the platform. Hold breath, following the steps of Yu, tread the stars ascending to the Golden Star. First, left foot forward, right foot withdrawn, stepping together to the star, reaching the Golden Star. Then turn right foot forward, treading the stars returning. Back and forth nine times, stopping on the Golden Star, knock teeth three times, circulate qi, and intone:

“Upper platform is the void essence, middle platform is the six pure ones, lower platform is the curved birth. If you desire gold and jade, call to the upper platform. If you desire rank and office, call to the middle platform. If you desire fields and lands, call to the lower platform. These three matters are granted according to one’s wishes.” Then follow the steps down, disperse the walk, and return to the Five Stars.

Next, stepping the Five Stars

First, face the stepping mouth, close eyes, hold breath, knock teeth five times, swallow saliva five times, preserving the essence of the Five Stars each residing in the five viscera. The star shapes and number of rays correspond with the inner light illuminating thoroughly. Softly intone:

Riding the whirlwind, fanning the light, soaring through the vast space, entering and exiting the dark origin, wandering and feasting in the Ten Directions. Five clouds float as canopies, summoning spirits and capturing winds, commanding myriad spirits, guarding the immortal lords above.”

Also, mentally intone the names of the Five Star Sovereign Lords and their consorts according to the eight-number calling method. Synchronize breath, close eyes again, then cross the stepping mouth and tread the stars. Left foot steps on the Golden Star, right foot advances to join, facing the direction accordingly. Left hand pats the heart, saying “Flying Immortal.” Next ascend the Earth Star, turning feet to face Fire Star. Ascend Fire Star, ascend Wood Star, ascend Water Star, then descend Wood Star. For all descending returns, first raise the right foot. Thus, back and forth three times, then according to the diagram ascend Golden, Fire, Earth, facing Wood with the foot in order. Ascend Wood, ascend Water, then descend Wood. Back and forth fifteen times in total, then descend. To avoid loss, one may bend fingers to count. Turn left, face the stepping mouth and mentally intone blessings. Each time arriving at a star, bring feet together, left hand pats heart, call the star sovereign lord and consort names, mentally intoning “Flying Immortal.” When all is complete, kneel, roll up the diagram, and return. Burn incense and bow twice.

If encountering malevolent ghosts or evil persons, preserve the Dipper Star over the head, point forward with a ladle, hold breath, mentally intone:

“I am the Heavenly Eye, pursuing Heaven; essence like thunder and lightning, shining across the Eight Regions, penetrating inside and out, nothing escapes my control.”

When bathing, always preserve the six dings, making all wishes fulfilled. The six dings follow their ten-day cycles and face their directions. Count baths, not the number but the person’s ability. Cleansing and refining corpse stench, true qi enters. Every Jiazi day, bathe; if not, bathe on some month’s first day, to open spirit. If stepping on filth or unclean places, bathe and wash to release form and remove it. The method uses ten taels of bamboo leaves, four taels of peeled white peach skin, one dou and two dou of clear water, boiled to a boil, cooled to warm, bathing the form, dispelling ten thousand stench. Bathing is best but not using this water for hair washing; use regular methods. Also, worldly talisman water and rinsing water are included, near techniques none better than this formula.

The Way method does not rely on others for clothes, carriage, bed, or sleep. Sitting and lying in the chamber must be clean and pure, or one receives spirit qi; if not pure, one receives stale qi. Stale qi disordering the chamber causes failure of deeds and no establishment. One’s body must be bathed several times; otherwise, the po’s nature will cause the po to stray from truth, refining its filth, po perishes daily. Frequent bathing, always preserving the six dings, makes all wishes fulfilled. Beware of speaking of learning the dao; learning the dao invites ghost intrusion; people are not afraid, but it causes sickness, because the body is not yet true.

Whenever writing scriptures, always burn incense on left and right. Whenever focusing spirit, always burn incense on left and right. Those with restless and violent nature have body thieves and illnesses; all matters should be gentle and slow, thoroughly refining purity.

Those wishing to learn the dao should not let others know what they see or hear; in all matters, be thus.
