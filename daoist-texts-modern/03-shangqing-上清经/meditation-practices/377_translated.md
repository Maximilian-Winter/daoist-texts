# Secret Essentials of Shangqing Cultivation Practice (Draft)

Dunhuang manuscript p. 2732, original beginning and end missing, untitled. Dayuan Ren’er tentatively attributes it to the Southern Qi Daoist Gu Huan as a fragment of his *True Writings*; Rao Zongyi’s collation suggests it is a lost text from the Liang dynasty Tao Hongjing’s *Instructions for Ascending the True*. Based on its contents, the scripture is provisionally titled *Secret Essentials of Shangqing Cultivation Practice*.

*(Earlier text missing)*

Preserving life, emerging from the hidden stores of light, the Five Spirits divide and transform, merging brightness to fan the void. At times, one rides the six clouds, harmonizing and embracing the body, ascending through the Nine Heavens’ seven resonances. When complete, one knocks the teeth seven times, then opens the eyes; the matter is done. Previously it was said: the method of taking in the mist begins with this sequence: mist is the essence of mountains, marshes, water, and fire, the vital energy filling metal and stone. Yet what remains now in taking it is still the qi of my five viscera—how so? It is said that by first calling forth and expelling twenty-four breaths, these are allowed to mingle with the outer mist; when the two vapors unite, then taking the mist fifty times grants twenty-six passages through the mist qi. This dao is wondrous and mysterious; in the divine land of Xuandu many have attained this art. You may practice it yourself. Also, inform Lord Yang. With long practice, one constantly rides the clouds and mist in wandering. It is further said: with prolonged taking, one can scatter the form and enter emptiness, merging with the cloud qi. Thus spoke the Right Central Lord.

Yang Shu: The Great Diamond Sand

Du Guangping received the art of Jie Yan Xuan Bai, also called the Inner Method of the Primordial Essence of the Fetus. Each dawn and dusk, sitting or lying at will, one preserves the black qi in the mud pellet, the radiant qi. This qi flows from the bones and flesh of the arms, through the flesh, reaching up to the shoulders and armpits, while the sun remains held in the palm. Suddenly, the radiant qi transforms into fire that burns the arm, making the inner and outer passages thoroughly clear for a long time. One arm is preserved as if it were burning charcoal, crackling softly. When complete, the Yin invocation is spoken: “Four Brightnesses of the Upper Origin, the division of sun and moon qi, flowing light dazzlingly shines, pouring liquid to condense the soul, divine fire dispersing shadows, cleansing filth and refining smoke, penetrating wind and calamity, all hundred evils burning bright, enabling long life, four limbs whole and complete, banishing harmful demons and ghosts, gathering and submitting to the six resonances of the Northern Star.” When finished, one contemplates deeply, releasing the body and forgetting the self. The burning spots on the left and right sides cause a hot force to arise; after a long time, one rejoices and forgets the body. Thus it ends. Formerly, the Chief Clerk suffered from a weak arm; therefore, the young lord explained this method. Those who learn it may dispel all wind cramps and illnesses; it is applicable not only to the arms but also to the head, face, and four limbs alike. The place where the sun resides need not be grasped; only the afflicted spot is burned. It also serves to counter tomb disputes and black examinations.

The above life-preserving instructions say: “This is the secret invocation method of rubbing and dispersing.” This is indeed the so-called rubbing and dispersing to cure illness.

Often, when vital energy arises, it is said later to face the sovereign and invoke; thus one should first face the sovereign and calmly sit by the desk. Spit twice, seven times over; then rub the painful spot on the desk. It is said to rub thirty-one times. This means that where there is pain, one presses the hand swiftly to rub it, heating and opening the passage. Raise the hand slightly and rub again, altogether thirty-one times. Even if there is no clear pain, one should still first rub and press the body and invoke, but without limiting the number. Facing the sovereign and invoking, one should softly say: “Left mystery, right mystery, the three spirits united in truth; left yellow, right yellow, the six flowers correspond; wind drives away evil illness, hiding in the four directions; jade liquid flows and moistens, communicating above and below; internally dispatching water and fire, externally repelling misfortune; long life flying immortals, body always rested and strong through six resonances.” When finished, spit twice, seven times. If done constantly, there will be no illness. Then quickly rub the painful spot thirty-one times.

The above is said by Lady Wang of the Canglang Yunlin Palace, who states it comes from the *Supreme Record of the Pure Flower Scripture*’s rubbing method, also saying it repels the secondary heart qi. Formerly, when wind illnesses came, there were four types; all the many spirits instructed the Chief Clerk, speaking plainly.

Chief Clerk’s Record

Constantly press with the hand behind the small hollow between the eyebrows, three times nine. Each time, press with the third finger behind the eyebrows; the hollow itself has a small cavity, where knocking the teeth and hearing four movements is called the “Mansion of the Six Harmonies.” Then rub with the hand and fingers below the eyes at the “quan” (temple). Also, with the third finger and palm, rub horizontally above the “quan” and below the eyes in the hollow, toward the “eye gate.” Both hands follow together, also nine times two. Then rotate the hands around the ears, thirty times. Each thumb presses the tiger’s mouth, lifting the ear upward, moving the hand up to the crown, rubbing without counting or timing. When finished, reverse the hand to ride the forehead three times nine, starting from between the eyebrows, then ascending into the hairline. Then with both thumbs supporting above the ears, bring the two little fingers together, from above the eyebrows to the forehead, entering the hairline and exiting the crown. Spit beside the mouth, countless times. At the start of riding the forehead, immediately spit, continuing until finished. If done constantly, the eyes become bright and clear; within one year, one can read at night.

Pressing inside the forehead, one preserves the red child’s sun and moon dual brightness, the upper origin’s joy, three times nine beginning at the eyebrows. When the count finishes, stop. This is called the hand’s facing of the Three Origins, strengthening the brain and firming the hair. When riding the forehead, one should face the eye center, preserving the mud pellet palace of the upper origin’s red child’s name, with a harmonious and joyous countenance, and the bright hall’s left sun and right moon illuminating the head’s inner palaces. The head’s four faces are pressed with both hands, smoothing the hair knot, only increasing it. Then the head’s blood flows and disperses, wind and dampness do not congeal. After finishing riding the forehead, if pain arises, alternate pressing the hair with the hands, also gently tossing without fixed number, feeling a small heat circulating and then ceasing.

When all is done, press the eyes’ four corners twice nine, feeling the vision’s light grow clear. This tests the eye spirit’s method; with long practice, one sees a hundred spirits. Each hand uses the second and third fingers to press, causing one to see violet, blue, and red three-colored light, round and bright. All previous matters are done in order, each with care and duration, not hastily. Diligently practice so the hands never leave the face; this is best. Even perfected immortals do not abandon it. When there is leisure in cultivation, one may do it at once, not waiting for auspicious times, making it easier to maintain.

Lady Pei Qingling says: This dao comes from the *Supreme Precious Divine Scripture*. Initially, this scripture was not transmitted to the world. When true immortals appear in time, some will obtain it. The preface to pressing the desk and rubbing says the scripture is shown by copying, referring only to this matter. The Southern True says: the *Precious Divine Scripture* is a book in Lady Pei Qingling’s brocade pouch, always carried by attendants; formerly received from Lady Ziwei, I also have it thus, written in the Western Palace’s fixed edition. The *Precious Divine Scripture* has another large scroll, surely containing essential methods for governing the body, only to be received by those who have become true immortals.

Chief Clerk’s Record

At night when lying down, one often feels shifting; quickly close both eyes, several times per night feeling it, and always do it, never forgetting. Knock teeth nine times through, spit nine times, then press the sides of the nose with the hand, left, right, up, and down, several tens of times. Both hands’ second and third fingers rub and press, starting below the nose up to between the eyebrows, about three times nine. Softly invoke: “Supreme Four Brightnesses, nine gates emitting essence, ears and eyes numinously clear, reaching truth and spirit, the heavenly platform in the center, flowing boundaries harmonized, proud lady’s cloud ceremony, eye child bright and clear, splendid intelligence shining, a hundred steps distant clarity, preserving harmony of the upper origin, wandering the nine cities, five viscera rooted, ears and eyes self-born, heavenly platform lush and pure, pillars and beams unshaken, seven souls polished and refined, three spirits at peace, red child carrying brightness, always accompanying me. Whoever dares to cover my ears and eyes, the Supreme shall shatter with flowing bells, ten thousand evils extinguished, wishes surely fulfilled, sun and moon guarding gates, heart storing five stars, true emperor’s blessing, all sounds reverently listening to fourteen resonances.” When finished, spit nine times, rub and wipe face and eyes to generate slight heat, as is customary and desired. When lying down and waking, always press and invoke thus, never missing a single sleep. Though the true dao is accomplished, we still regularly practice it, but no longer lie down, naturally doing it sitting. This method is done when lying down and waking; fearing people might suspect true immortals also indulge in sleep, it is therefore said to do it sitting to clarify, so it need not be done lying down and waking.

Lady Ziwei says: These are the invocations in the *Supreme Precious Divine Scripture*, the highest way. They make ears and eyes keen, strengthen memory and clarity, regulate the nose so it does not drip fluids, four sounds and eight penetrations, face youthful and pure, controlling the soul and recording the spirit, repelling a thousand demons, seven orifices dividing the flowing colors like pure flowers—the wondrous dao of true daily conduct. It is called “daily conduct” because it is practiced constantly. This also corresponds to matters in the *Precious Divine Scripture*. Lady Pei’s explanation ends here, yet she returns to this, thus also saying these are the invocations in the *Precious Divine Scripture*. Likewise, one need not stop at lying down and waking or sitting up; it can be used constantly even during daytime rest. The preface and invocations all have excellent explanations; how could one not be diligent?

Chief Clerk’s Record

The heavenly truth lies between the eyebrows, at the eyebrow corners—these are the inner corners at both ends of the eyebrows. First, press each with the third finger. The mountain source says: the “white foot” is below the root of the philtrum, the base of the human middle, a small valley under the nose. This corresponds to the hollow within the nose’s internal cavity. Next, with both hands’ third fingertips, pinch and press the “flower court” beneath the eyebrows, the bridge of the eyes’ tears. The hollow beneath the eyebrow and above the eye socket. Next, horizontally press with the third finger. “Heavenly straight eight” is the upper chamber of spirit guidance. This phrase reiterates the meaning of the earlier eyebrow corner. Morning, noon, and evening: morning is dawn during the hours of Chou and Yin; noon is the hour of Wu; evening is the early night hours of Xu and Hai. Spit three times nine; first finish spitting, then press quickly with the hand three times nine yin passes, making it a habit. Each place is pressed in turn, three times nine passes finished before moving to the next. This brings spirit penetration and clear vision, blocking the way of myriad evils. Do this three times daily. Thus, it is not done at night. When pressing and invoking, first press then invoke. This means invoking during pressing, commanding pressing of one or two places with mouth utterances. The final pressing at the flower court is done while facing the eyes and invoking. All three places may be pressed likewise, in order. (Text fragment missing) Also using the fourth finger… (text missing)
