## Scripture of the Numinous Western Queen Mother’s Precious Spirit: The Record of Daily Movements

### Scripture of the Western Queen Mother’s Precious Spirit Record of Daily Movements

Upon waking at night or about to rise at dawn, one must frequently shift position, then swiftly close both eyes, knock the teeth nine times to open the passages, swallow saliva three times to completion, curl the tongue back toward the throat, then shake the head and move the neck seven times. With hands, press along the sides of the nostrils, left and right, up and down, several dozen times. When finished, softly intone:

*“Great Emperor of the Nine Heavens, the Three Primal Protectors of Infants, Most High in Motion and Splendor, Jade Chamber releasing essence, Seven Gates summoning spirits, Nine Chambers receiving clarity, ears sharp and eyes penetrating, true and numinous communication, Mountain of Heaven in the midst, harmonizing qi to balance, Proud Maiden of clouded grace, eyes youthful and bright, Mysterious windows shining clear, a hundred pavilions sparkling, preserving harmony of the Primordial Origin, wandering the Golden Court, Five Viscera radiate splendor, ears and eyes ever alive, Spirit Terrace stands tall, pillars and beams unyielding, Seven Souls bathed and refined, Three Spirits calm and yellow, Most High hand in hand with me, Five Elders blended, no heroes assist, all myriad calamities vanish, wishes surely fulfilled, Sun and Moon guard the gates, heart circling the bright stars, immortal sovereign’s command, myriad spirits respectfully heed.”*

Whenever waking from sleep, one should press and intone thus, never forgetting. Though the true dao is accomplished, this is why it is always practiced. This is the supreme method of the Most High Western Queen Mother’s Precious Spirit Record of Daily Movements Jade Scripture. It sharpens ears and eyes, strengthens memory and clarity, balances the nose so no foul mucus arises, perfects the Four Ministers and Eight Penetrations, the face retains a youthful glow, controls the recording of souls and spirits, repels myriad demons. This is the wondrous dao of the True Person’s daily movements. Hence it is named “Record of Daily Movements,” for it must be constantly practiced.

Next, rub the face and eyes with both hands until a slight warmth arises, making this a daily habit, counting the strokes. The Mother says: when a person ages, wrinkles first appear beneath the eyes; when the body weakens and qi diminishes, wrinkles first form between the two nostrils. These two places are the windows of wrinkle and decay, the gates of qi power. Therefore, practicing this method daily wards off wrinkles and decay, preserving qi power in health and harmony.

## Scripture of the Western Queen Mother’s Precious Birth of Deathlessness Jade

The Deathlessness Jade Scripture says:  
Place the hands upon the side of the Flowery Court, extend and harmonize the Heavenly True, ascend into the Divine Ravine Chamber, Jade Valley fills the Heavenly Mountain. Within lies the mysterious numinous source, all demons self-annihilate their bodies, longevity and eternal deathlessness arise. The Jade Register returns to the Emperor Sovereign, following the Heavenly True’s indications, pressing this hidden mountain source.

The Heavenly True dwells between the two eyebrows, at the inner corners of the brows; the Heavenly True lies one fen beneath the ears, the upper chamber guiding the spirit.

The mountain source lies beneath the nose, above the philtrum, at the root side beneath the nose, entering the small cavity of the valley. This seals and extinguishes the gates of myriad demons.

The Flowery Court lies beneath the two eyebrows, opposite the center below the brows, the bridge for clear vision.

At dawn upon rising, or at dusk preparing to lie down, quickly close both eyes, curl the tongue back toward the throat, swallow saliva three times, then press these three points with the hands nine times each, pressing downward without lifting the hands. Make this a constant practice, granting long life and deathlessness, descending spirits with clear vision, sealing and extinguishing the path of myriad ghosts. After pressing, softly intone:

*“Most High Empty Sovereign, opening and dispersing the Jade Court, golden chambers shining bright, emerald terraces lush and green, I command the Three Ways, extinguishing ghosts and animating spirits, I can be deathless, also without birth, eternal life and freedom, reversing old age to infant form, souls and spirits refined, Five Spirits at peace, turning the whirlwind chariot, northward to Jade Clarity, ascending the Great Origin, merging with the sun, thus becoming a True Person, Emperor Sovereign merging with darkness, the Three Primes announce, myriad spirits respectfully heed.”*

Long ago, in the time of Duke Zhuang of Chu, there was a market chief named Song Yuanfu, a man of good heart, who always swept the entire market. After a long time, a beggar entered the market for many years, singing loudly at dawn. The song went:

*“Heaven’s Court births golden splendor, inner source blocks yin and evil, Jade Valley joins the mysterious ministers, jade qi mutually supports the net, Heavenly True stands above the sun, flying medicine expels numinous marvels, early morning pressing the heavenly horse, circling the divine mysterious home, immortals come into the chamber, also extinguishing a hundred demons.”*

Upon leaving, he inscribed these words on the market gate. The people of Chu’s market did not understand, but Yuanfu suddenly perceived in his heart, suspecting it was an immortal, though he did not grasp the song’s meaning. He bowed and inquired repeatedly. The beggar said: “I am truly a True Person. These words are the Kunlun Western Queen Mother’s Precious Birth of Deathlessness Song. Those who know it become immortal.” He then taught Yuanfu secret essential methods to practice. After twenty years, Yuanfu ascended to Heaven by day, now residing in the Mysterious Isle, holding rank as Immortal Minister. The Chu market beggar was indeed the Southern Peak True Person, Red Pine Master. At that time, forms dispersed their shadows, temporarily dwelling in dust and filth, wandering and gazing upon the noisy filth, summoning the true assembly.

The *Scripture of the Clear and Empty True Person Lord Pei* says:  
To seek the dao, first clear the eyes and sharpen the ears, for they are the master of affairs. The ears and eyes are the ladder to seek truth, the gateway to gather the numinous. Success or failure depends on them; survival or demise is handled through them. Now this scripture is presented for application.

The *Exorcising Demons, Upper Chapter* says:  
The ears desire frequent pressing to suppress left and right, also to make them countless, called “managing the city walls,” inscribed in the Emperor’s register. The nose also desires frequent pressing left and right, only to make them countless, called “watering the central mountain,” inscribed in the Emperor’s tally.

These two lines come from Madam Li of the Platform of Spirit Manifestation, taught on the night of the twelfth day of the ninth month.

Each day, commonly press the small hollow behind the two eyebrows three times, then rub with palm and fingers beneath the eyes, at the temples. Grasp the ears and stroke thirty times, rubbing until the count has no fixed rhythm. Then, reverse the hand along the forehead three times nine, starting from the middle of the brows, ascending into the hairline. At the mouth, swallow saliva, in varying amounts without counting. Practiced regularly, the eyes become clear and bright; within one year, one may write at night. This may also be done secretly at the philtrum; do not speak of its form.

The small hollow behind the brows is the Upper Origin’s Six Harmonies residence, governing the creation of eye brilliance, harmonizing and clarifying essence and light, preserving the pearl’s clarity and youth, guarding the eye spirit. This is the True Person’s highest way of sitting and rising. Another name is the True Person’s constant abode within the scripture. The True Person says: “If you desire to write at night, you must cultivate the constant abode.” The True Person’s ability to observe all directions and illuminate the eight horizons comes from the brightness of the constant abode.

Beneath the eyes at the temples is the decisive bright chamber, preserving the infant return to the dao. Grasping the ears and stroking reveals the profound art of illumination. Here, the principle opens the blood vessels, disperses wrinkles and spots, eye radiance reflects mysteriously, harmonizing spirit and energy to fullness. When a woman ages, it often begins at the ears and eyes; the signs of aging also start at the sides of the eyes. Pressing the forehead with the hand preserves the inner infant, the twin lights of sun and moon, the Upper Origin’s joy. The three nines complete the cycle; count finished, then stop. This is the morning method to strengthen the brain and firm the hair. The head’s four sides are pressed with both hands, smoothing the hair to knots, only increasing the count. Thus, head blood flows smoothly, wind and dampness do not congeal. When finished, press the four corners of the eyes twice nine times, feeling the light become clear and distinct. This is the way to test the eye spirit; long practice grants vision of myriad spirits.

The *Scripture of Master Shijingzi* says:  
Constantly cover mouth and nose, face the eyes with subtle qi; after long time, liquid forms in the hands; then rub face and eyes. Practice always, making the body fragrant.

The *Most High Three Heavens Pass Jade Scripture* says:  
Frequently press the two corners of the eyes near the nose, closing qi to do so; when qi flows, stop and then exhale. Regular practice enables the eyes to see through all things.

The above two lines come from Madam Wei of the Southern Peak.

The *Dan Character Purple Scripture of the Three-Five Sequential Movements* says:  
When sitting, often close the eyes and look inward, preserving sight of the five viscera and intestines. Long practice brings clear and distinct understanding.

The *Taosu Danjing Scripture* says:  
On one side of the face, often rub with both hands to generate warmth of qi, following the shape up and down, making the circulation complete. The face gains luster, wrinkles and spots do not arise. After five years, the color resembles a young maiden. This is called the mountain and river qi circulation, always full and never depleted.

The *Danjing Scripture* says:  
First warm the hands by rubbing, then wipe the face and eyes. Next, rub the hair as if combing, with the arms mutually rubbing each other, to prevent white hair and floating pulses.

The *Great Cavern True Scripture of Essence and Scene Massage Chapter* says:  
Upon lying and rising, always balance qi and sit upright. First, cross the hands, then pass them behind the neck, looking upward, competing with the neck, making the neck and hands contest, repeating three or four times. This harmonizes essence and blood, prevents wind qi intrusion, and with long practice, grants immortality and health. Then bend and move the body, stretch the hands in four directions, reverse, stretch sideways, and shake a hundred joints, three times each. Before lying and rising, use a handkerchief or thick silk to wipe the neck’s four sides and behind the ears, making the area warm and gentle. Rub the hair as if combing with no tangles. After a while, rub both hands to treat the face and eyes. Long practice grants clear eyes, repels evil qi, keeps the form clean, and removes filth. Finally, swallow saliva thirty times to guide the inner fluids.

The above line is from the *Great Cavern Essence and Scene Scripture*.

## Scripture of the Western Queen Mother’s Reverse Gestation Massage Jade

The way of nourishing life focuses on the ears and eyes. Mixed vision darkens the eyes; excessive worry closes the ears. These two illnesses arise from within the body, forming diseases, not from external guests or false calamities. This is called the difficulty of hearing the dao—not the difficulty of hearing the dao, but the difficulty of practicing the dao; not the difficulty of practicing the dao, but the difficulty of completing the dao. If the ears and eyes are chaotic with distracting thoughts, not sending away hardship, even if one treads the immortal pavilion or grasps the dragon’s balcony, it is still useless.

Reverse gestation massage is practiced on yang days, counting one day as yang, two days as yin. Each yang day at dawn and night, upon waking, quickly close the eyes, facing the direction of one’s birth fate. Rub the palms together until slightly warm, then press the eyes left and right, then below the ear gates, letting both palms meet at the nape of the neck nine times. Visualize within each eye three-colored clouds of purple, red, and yellow qi, descending into the ears. After a while, softly intone:

*“Youthful eyes of three clouds, true lords of both eyes, bright and focused essence, opening and connecting the Emperor’s spirits, Great Mysterious Cloud Pattern, Jade Spirit spreading the chapters, protecting the twin gates, opening and penetrating the nine doors, all joints respond and echo, circulating the mud pellet, body ascends to the Jade Palace, ranked among the highest True Ones.”*

After the incantation, swallow saliva three times, then open the eyes. Make this a constant practice; on yang days sitting up, it can be done anytime, not necessarily morning and evening. Practiced for three years, ears and eyes become sharp and clear.

Comb the hair always facing the birth fate direction, beginning the combing while softly intoning:

*“Great Emperor disperses spirits, Five Elders reverse the gods, mud pellet’s mysterious splendor, preserving essence and long life, left holds the hidden moon, right draws the sun’s root, Six Harmonies clear and refined, myriad spirits receive grace.”*

Complete the incantation. Regular practice prevents headaches.

The *Tai Chi Scripture* says:  
When combing hair, face the Jade Pool, beginning the combing while softly intoning:

*“Mud pellet’s mysterious splendor, preserving essence and long life, left is the hidden moon, right is the sun’s root, Six Harmonies clear and refined, myriad spirits receive grace.”*

After the blessing, swallow saliva three times. Regular practice prevents hair loss and promotes growth. Count and vary the combing, taking much care but without pain. One may also have an attendant comb with many strokes. Thus, blood flows without stagnation, and hair roots remain firm.

The above two lines were revealed by Madam An Jiuhua for application.

When sitting or lying, always face the nostrils toward the birth fate direction; so too with eating and drinking. If unable to face the birth fate, facing northeast or northwest is also good. These two directions are the gates of the soul and spirit of Heaven and Earth. Also, upon lying and rising, always shake the body left and right several dozen times. Then place both hands behind the head, raise the head toward Heaven, and shake the neck left and right twenty times. Then sit upright, raise both hands to support the sky for a long time. Next, rub both palms to wipe around the eyes to the ears for a long time, softly intoning:

*“Front twists and back points, Heavenly Emperor’s honored guest, left glances and right looks, great virtue of longevity, head raised breathing deeply, Great One at the summit, reversing the moon and dragon dam, Life Controller aligned, feeding the fetal origin, crossing the gates of Kunlun, turning and reversing double knees, True Persons united.”*

After the incantation, draw in qi and close it. Store the red qi in the navel as large as a ribbon, exhale from the navel lying down, enter the nose three times thus. This completes the massage method, opening all joints, granting longevity and health.

The *Purple Degree Flame Light Inner Vision Central Method* says:  
Often close the eyes and lie down, calming the body’s subtle qi, as if in sleep, so others do not perceive. Then inwardly see and outwardly hear the Ten Directions, causing ears and eyes to focus on events ten thousand li away. Long practice brings vision of events a million li distant. One also constantly hears sounds of gold and jade, strings and flutes within the ears—this is the wondrous method.

The Ten Directions refer chiefly to the ears, which must first arise in one direction, then inwardly see and hear. Initially practicing this, truly there is no imitation; with long sincerity one enters the marvel.

The *Great Cavern True Scripture’s Supreme Inner Chapter on Suppressing Evil Great Incantation* says:  
Whenever passing the path of the dangerous eyelid, between ghost temples, where doubts and difficulties arise in the mind, and subtle hesitation occurs, the one traversing should first curl the tongue inward, swallow saliva three times, then with the left hand’s middle finger grasp the philtrum beneath the two nostrils, the inner edge of the nasal cavity, thirty-six times, pressing swiftly without lifting the finger to count. The nasal cavity’s inner edge is called the Mountain Source. The Mountain Source is also called the Ghost Well, the Spirit Pool, the Root of Evil, and the Soul Platform. After grasping, knock the teeth seven times to open the passages, then cover the nose with the palm. Facing the eyes, softly intone:

*“Vermilion Bird soars to Heaven, divine might spreads within, Mountain Source fills four directions, Ghost Well flees, Spirit Pool exhales qi, Root of Evil lies hidden, Soul Platform shines fourfold, jade chambers gleam, jade truth towers high, seated guarding the Bright Hall, hands radiate purple glow, head builds morning light, chanting the Cavern Scripture, thirty-nine chapters, containing exorcisms of evil dragons and tigers, cutting soldiers and severing cauldrons, fierce hunts of rushing bulls, biting blades and swallowing inlays, raising mountains and howling heavens, divine birds and poisonous dragons, six leaders spitting fire, devouring kings of ghosts, lightning boars and thunder fathers, pulling stars flowing across, owls pecking swift steeds, opposing winds crossing, great birds capturing and inspecting—all are by my side, spitting fire ten thousand zhang to remove misfortune, myriad spirits open the dao, sealing and falling on mountain villages, a thousand gods and a hundred spirits, all bowing hands to the forehead, marshals holding lamps, burning incense for me, wherever I go, myriad spirits welcome.”*

Afterward, knock the teeth three times, then open the eyes and slowly withdraw the left hand. Pressing the Mountain Source closes the Ghost Well’s gate; pressing the Spirit Pool scatters the Root of Evil; pressing the Soul Platform guards the Jade Truth’s gate. Thus the numinous root is stirred, heavenly beasts come to guard, myriad spirits tremble and submit, none may harm my qi—this is the natural principle, suddenly manifesting.

The Mountain Source beneath the nose is the body’s blocked passage, the true and evil’s communication residence. The false gives rise to evil qi; the true restrains myriad evils, under my control. Thus, good and ill omens arise. The Bright Hall is also the body’s pattern, the form residence of life and death, the original chamber of the seven souls, the dwelling of the three spirits. Preserving its spirit allows subtle inner observation; abandoning its dao leads to decay and rot. Therefore, by my governance, carefully maintaining its health, no regrets or blame will arise.

The above four lines come from the Great Cavern True Scripture’s supreme first chapter.

The Great Spirit True Person says:  
Wind diseases arise from dampness in burial mounds, the three springs blocked and stagnant. Thus, the Earthly Official uses water qi to agitate, often causing wind bi (wind impediment). Severe wind bi leaves the whole body unsupported; mild cases affect half the body or lose use of hands and feet. If one often dreams of the northeast or northwest, pressing the old residence, or sees the spirit bed’s place, it means the burial qi is about to connect. The northeast of a tomb is the place of severed fate; the northwest is the place of nine calamities—both are ominous burial litigation grounds. If one dreams of the dead among them, the omen is confirmed. For those who often encounter such dreams, upon waking, face upward, tap the teeth three times, and intone:

*“Great Origin Most Mysterious, Nine Capitals Purple Heaven, governing souls and protecting life, High Pure True Person, I receive the supreme method, taught by the Great Mysterious, longevity and long vision, body flying and immortal, tombs and graves forever peaceful, ghost litigations sealed, souls and spirits harmonious, evil qi does not smoke, wandering spirits and wraiths dare not harm my spirit, Northern Emperor restrains and controls, gathers qi into the abyss, receiving the tally from the Supreme Emperor, name inscribed before the Emperor.”*

After this, intone twice more, knock the teeth three times, and no longer dream of tombs or household ghosts. This is the Northern Emperor’s secret incantation; those with good intentions may all practice it. If one often suffers bad dreams and misfortune, all may press according to this method, causing ghost qi to vanish and evil ghosts to scatter.

When the arms cannot lift, it is due to deep wind poison qi in the vessels, congealing and binding the bones to cause it. Acupuncture and moxibustion are appropriate; with them, healing occurs. Also, pressing the Northern Emperor’s twisting incantation a hundred times quickly dispels the illness. First, slowly massage the painful area with one hand; after a while, lie down, look inward with the eyes, swallow saliva three times, knock teeth three times, and intone the heart’s subtle incantation:

*“Most High Four Mysteries, Five Splendors Six Courts, Three Souls Seven Spirits, Heavenly Pass Earth Essence, Spirit Mansion flourishing and guarding, Heavenly Fetus Supreme Brightness, Four Branches Hundred Spirits, Nine Joints Myriad Spirits, receiving tally Jade Morning, inscribed in Jade City, Jade Maid attends the body, Jade Youth guards life, forever aligned with two lights, flying immortals ascend to clarity, long with sun and moon, yearly receiving favor, soaring and ascending immortals, attaining perfect peace, flowing wind knots illness, binding ghosts and five dragons, wraiths and burial qi, yin qi diverging, oppressing my four limbs, harming my rise and fall, Most High Heavenly Ding, dragon and tiger shining might, cutting ghosts and misfortune, wind evil immediately dispelled, examining and annotating hidden litigation, a hundred poisons concealed and false, restoring me to normal, sun and moon shining together, examining and annotating offenses, Northern Ghosts gather and destroy, like the bright above, mighty and commanding.”*

The *Most High Inscription of Tranquil Flowing Splendor Scripture* on massage says:  
Always when life qi arises, after swallowing saliva twenty-seven times, press the painful area, then intone:

*“Left mystery right mystery, three spirits united true, left yellow right yellow, six splendors correspond, wind qi evil illness, lurking in all directions, jade liquid flows and moistens, up and down circulating, internally sending water and fire, externally repelling misfortune, longevity and divine immortality, body always rested and strong.”*

Afterward, swallow saliva twenty-seven times. Always thus, no illness arises. Also urgently press the painful area thirty-one times.

The above line was revealed on the twenty-second day of the tenth month by Madam Youying of the Canglang Yunlin Palace.

The *Exorcising Demons Upper Spirit Scripture* says:  
If the body is uneasy, curl the tongue to block the throat, rinse saliva countless times; soon, the unease will naturally vanish. At that time, one also often feels the body relaxed and soft.

The above line comes from the preface of the *Exorcising Demons Upper Spirit*.

---

Dreams false and untrue, spirits conjoined with evil qi, as if testing the heart, seeking to spy upon my spirit’s hiding place. Whenever encountering bad dreams, just face north and invoke the Most High Dao Lord, fully describing the dream’s form in four or five words, then it naturally vanishes.

The *Green Youth* incantation.

Night and day encountering bad dreams is not good. Upon waking, immediately turn the pillow, change the pillow, and intone:

*“Great Harmony Jade Maiden, attending true spirit and guarding soul, Six Palaces Golden Youths, come to guard the gate of health, transform evil into good, report to the Three Primes, make me long-lived, riding light and driving clouds.”*

Afterward, swallow saliva nine times, knock teeth seven times, then lie down. After four or five repetitions, the dreams naturally cease. This incantation also reverses bad dreams and brings auspiciousness.

The above was revealed on the thirteenth night of the eleventh month by Madam Youying.

The profound phenomena of the numinous pivot, reaching the place of observation, the heart’s center refined and empty, the wandering spirit’s taste manifest, chewing and inhaling the Great Harmony, body qi desolate and clear. Then the jade vibrates and sounds, myriad sounds silently summoned. Qi is the craftsman of spirit and brightness, the origin of purity and turbidity. In mystery it is Heaven’s clarity; in man it preserves the body. Life has no loss or gain, following the balance of governance. To master the six qi, always at dawn facing the hour of Yin and Chou, using the heavenly time to begin, must face the direction at this time. The Great Glow splits the radiance, the Red Sun births light, the numinous scene opens the morning, the Vermilion Essence begins to shine. First, store the sun as a chicken’s egg in the mud pellet. Then exhale one qi, storing it as black qi, called corpse qi. Next exhale two qi, storing white qi, called old qi. Exhale three qi, storing blue qi, called death qi. Contemplate the colors and exhale qi for a long time. All three colors exhaled combine to six qi. Then slowly inhale and draw, taking yellow qi four times, stored qi coming from the mud pellet’s sun below, four times completed, then swallow saliva three times, completing three cycles. Then again store in the mud pellet, below exiting from the ear, before the mouth, nine cun from the face, facing the eyes, as if seeing a phantom. Again inhale with the sun, taking red qi seven times, after seven times swallow saliva three times and stop. Then rise to sit, shake the four limbs, bend and stretch, regulating the pulse and vessels, all completed. The stored saliva should be blue. At night, one may also store the moon in the mud pellet as in the sun method. When storing the moon, begin at midnight on the first day of the lunar month, staying until the fifteenth day. From the sixteenth to the thirtieth day, the moon qi declines, the heavenly fetus shrinks, and one must not store the moon at night. This method is supremely wondrous; those who practice it become immortals. Thus one exhales and inhales the fetal origin, rinsing and absorbing the bright truth. At times, call and summon the five swallows to obtain nature, the soul returns to the final dwelling, the spirit returns to the mud pellet, thus achieving longevity. How could this compare to gathering yin qi from shadowy valleys, seeking the spirit of the running horse, crossing the sea to seek salvation, or driving a feathered cart on a volcano? One must be cautious, truly cautious.

The above is the Western Queen Mother’s introductory formula.

On the night of the fourth day of the seventh month in the third year of Xingning, the Lord of Life, Eastern Official, descended, accompanied by seven attendants entering the household. One held a Flowery Banner, named the Ten Absolute Spirit Banner; one bore a ringed seal pouch; three carried white ivory boxes, seemingly containing scriptures; one grasped a flowing golden fire bell. The attendants all wore vermilion robes. The Lord of Life was smaller than his second brother, wearing a blue embroidered skirt, a purple fur cape, and a lotus crown. The second brother also came to attend and stand. The Lord took a seat and spoke at length. On the night of the sixth day of the seventh month, the Lord of Life again descended and revealed a scripture, saying:

*“If one must model the mysterious pattern and uphold purity and tranquility in rare times, then withdraw from the myriad hidden algae, rest wings in high perches, sense the upper contract, the abyss calm and mountains towering, desolate jade chapters, delighting in precious spirit life, abandoning worldly attachments, tuning and playing clear spirits, clarifying the empty scene, the Five Ways manifesting, colors surpassing transformation waves, desiring to blend with the pale, emptiness sharing the dark path, no seeing no hearing, you then approach the wondrous true, reawakening profound awareness, bright virtue within round, numinous grasp without fixed.”*

Ultimately, one can harness the cloud carriage to ascend the heavens, inscribing the Lord of Life’s red tally. If the heart scatters into myriad thoughts, life becomes unstable, qi follows dust waves, the heart does not truly rest, exhausting body and spirit in forested mountains, this is truly mistaken for the coming student. Its dao is subtle yet easy to seek; its dao is difficult yet hard to obtain.

---

On the night of the fifth day of the month, store the sun image in the heart, the sun entering through the mouth. Let it illuminate the one heart within, merging light with the sun, joining and uniting. One should feel the heart warm, the rosy radiance manifesting. After a long while, intone:

*“Great Bright nurtures essence, internally refining the cinnabar heart, radiance merging and reflecting, spirit and truth come to the body.”*

Complete the incantation, swallow saliva nine times. On the fifteenth, twenty-fifth, and twenty-ninth days, repeat as above. This opens the mind’s hearing and seeing, all joints open and clear, the face grows jade light, the body has golden liquid. Practiced five years, the Great One dispatches the protective carriage to welcome one, ascending to the Great Firmament. Practice only requires counting, not necessarily these days.

The above line is from the *Exorcising Demons Scripture*, Southern Peak Red Lord’s inner method.

---

Also says:  
When approaching food, do not speak of deathly matters, do not expose food, lest myriad evil qi come.

Also says:  
Frequent bathing is essential, especially on the day of Jiazi for bathing; otherwise, bathe on some month’s day at dawn to enable spiritual communication. Bathing is not about frequency, but about the person’s ability. Wash away the corpse stench, and true qi will enter.

Madam Wei of the Mysterious Master’s lineage ordered this for practice.

---

The *Most High Nine Transformations Ten Changes Easy New Scripture* says:  
When treading on filth and unwholesome places, one should first bathe to release the form and remove it. The method uses ten liang of bamboo leaves and four liang of peeled white peach skin, boiled in one hu and two dou of clear water in a cauldron. Before boiling, when warm, bathe the body; this removes all filth. After cleansing, it also wards off damp bi, sores, and itching. Bamboo is hollow and white within; peach repels evil and breaks filth. Thus these two are used to dispel the dregs and turbidity within the form. When Heaven and Man descend and return, they always use this water to cleanse. As for worldly talisman water and incantations for external washing, none compare to this formula. Bathing is excellent, but do not use this water for washing hair. The essence of refining the corpse is best bathed with this water—a truly wondrous secret.

Madam Wang of the Mysterious Ridge Feather Palace Purple Tenuity ordered this for use.

---

At dawn, face the direction of the Lord, inscribe in vermilion, bow twice, and take the medicine, intoning:

*“Five spirits open the heart, hearing the utmost silence, three souls gather essence, guarding the cinnabar heart, making me not forget, five viscera far seeking.”*

First bow, after bowing intone, after intoning take the talisman, swallow saliva five times, knock teeth five times, do not let others see. If not using dawn, then use the first, fifteenth, and twenty-seventh days of the lunar month, three times a month, one year to see results. This is a secret talisman.

---

The *Great Void True Person’s Formula* says:  
On the spring day of Yimao, summer day of Bingwu, autumn day of Gengshen, winter day of Renzi, at the time of dark sleep, first grind cinnabar, realgar, and orpiment in equal parts, finely ground, wrapped in cotton to the size of a jujube. At bedtime, plug both ears with this. This dispels the Three Corpses and refines the Seven Souls, a wondrous secret method. Do not let others know. The next day, at midday, bathe with east flowing water. After bathing, tidy the bed and clothing, wash the old, change shoes, and bathe again. Finally, sweep and sprinkle beneath the bed, ensuring the room is clean and pure. Then place the pillow, close qi upward, grasp firmly for a long time, softly intoning:

*“Heaven’s dao is constant, changing and renewing, the Emperor’s auspicious day, bathing is true, three qi dispel corpses, cinnabar and orpiment calm the soul, precious refining of seven souls, close to me.”*

After the blessing, this dao dispels and refines corpse filth, renewing and transforming the form. Each season takes only one day for this.

The Great Void True Person says:  
The ancient masters taught: on the five arrival days, when the sun rises three or four zhang high, stand facing the sun, store the three souls and spirits correctly entering the heart with the sun’s light, steady and clear within for a long time, close qi for three breaths, swallow saliva three times, softly intone:

*“Sun disperses radiance, hanging light purple and blue, entering my body, illuminating my five forms, dispelling ghost trials, heart made steady, internally penetrating nine qi, externally connecting fetal life, flying immortal ascending clarity, jade tally already set.”*

After the incantation, wipe the eyes twenty-seven times, knock teeth twenty-seven times. All complete. This method condenses the three souls clearly, the cinnabar heart upright, myriad evils hidden and subdued, the heart’s test not moving. This is the true essential dao. Practice it often, always on the five arrival days, facing the sun to induce sneezing. If unable to sneeze, use a soft object facing the sun to guide the nose; this also causes sneezing. The sneeze incantation is:

*“Heaven’s light comes advancing, six fetuses fully connected, three souls guard the spirit, seven spirits do not perish, receiving the sun’s sneeze, sharing the sun’s form, flying immortal jade clarity, ranked as true lord.”*

After blessing, wipe the eyes twenty-seven times. This internally refines essence to join the sun’s light, the three souls manifest within, opening the mind and spirit, myriad essences circulating within the inner palace. If not on the five arrival days, this is not necessary.

---

On the five arrival days, face north, bow five times, steady the heart, call upon the Supreme True Emperor and Empress by name, three times, knock teeth five times, remove the headscarf, kneel long, respectfully petition the Five Stars, Sun, Moon, Supreme Emperor, Great True Dao Lord, the Thirty-Two Heavenly Emperors, Jade Clarity Most High Supreme Emperor, Supreme Emperor, Supreme Emperor, Supreme Emperor, Supreme Dao Holy Lord before them, then present all seven ancestors and grandparents below, and one’s own thousand sins and myriad faults since past lives, begging for release and liberation. The Three Officials report to the Heavenly Emperor, causing the charges to be lifted, black registers erased, begging to receive the true stars of the Five Planets, all rushing to the Flowery Morning, ascending to Jade Clarity, passing through the Jade Gate.

The first day of the first month at midday, the first day of the second month at dusk, the seventh day of the third month at midnight, the ninth day of the fourth month at mealtime, the fifteenth day of the fifth month at midnight, the third day of the sixth month at midday, the seventh day of the seventh month at midnight, the fourth day of the eighth month at midday, the second day of the ninth month at dawn, the first day of the tenth month at dawn, the sixth day of the eleventh month at midnight, the second day of the twelfth month at midnight.

These are the recorded auspicious five arrival days.

## Method of Taking Sun and Moon Essence

On the first day of the lunar month at dawn, when the sun rises about two zhang high, gaze at the sun, then grasp firmly, take three steps eastward in the Yu stride, and with the mouth draw in the sun’s essence twenty-seven times, swallowing fourteen times. This may be given to two people entering a warm disease household; other diseases cannot be treated. The one given should be light and always lying down, to promote longevity.

On the third day of the lunar month, when the moon rises at the Geng position, grasp firmly with both hands, walk southwest, facing the moon, take three Yu steps, and with the mouth remotely drink the moon’s essence twenty-seven times, swallowing fourteen times. The whole year will be free of disease and may also enter the death household. The sun and moon illuminate impurities and filth. These two lines—eating sun and drinking moon essence—both dispel myriad illnesses.
