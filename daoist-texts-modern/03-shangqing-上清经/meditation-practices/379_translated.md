## Scripture of the Secret Essentials Practiced and Composed by the True Person of Supreme Clarity and Great Ultimate

The *Scripture of the Elixir’s Great Simplicity* says:  
Above the one face, one always desires to rub both hands together until they become warm, moving up and down following the contours, making circles to the utmost. This causes the face to glow with radiance, wrinkles and spots do not arise. Practiced for five years, the complexion becomes like that of a young maiden. This is called the circulation of mountain and river qi, always full and never exhausted. First, one must rub both hands until warm, then wipe the face completely, and then smoothly rub the hair as if combing it. Also, mutually massage the two kidneys with the hands, so that the hair does not turn white and the pulse does not float outward.

This passage is taken from the middle scroll of the *Scripture of the Elixir’s Great Simplicity*.

The *Scripture of the Great Cavern’s True Essence and Refined Scene Massage Chapter* says:  
When rising from lying down, one should calm the qi and sit upright. First, interlock both hands, then reach back to cover the nape of the neck, then tilt the face upward to gaze at the heavens, causing the nape and hands to contest three or four times. This harmonizes essence and blood, prevents wind qi from entering, and with long practice, one neither dies nor falls ill. When finished, bend and stretch the body, extend the hands in all four directions, then stretch, pull, and shake the hundred joints, each three times. This is the secret formula. When rising from lying down, first use a handkerchief or thick silk to wipe the four sides of the nape and behind the ears, making circular motions until warm and gentle. Smoothly rub the hair and neck as if combing without measure. After a while, rub both hands to treat the face; with prolonged practice, the eyes become bright, evil qi does not afflict, the body remains clean and ungreasy, removing filth. When all is complete, swallow saliva thirty times to guide the internal fluids.

This passage is taken from the upper scroll of the *Scripture of the Great Cavern’s Refined Scene*.

The *Supreme Chapter of the Great Cavern’s True Scripture* contains the Great Spell to Restrain Evil:  
Whenever passing through dangerous roads or ghost temples, or when the mind harbors doubts and difficulties, and the heart feels subtle hesitation, where the feet tread, one must first turn the tongue inward against the palate, swallow saliva three times, then use the left hand’s second and third fingers to pinch the root beneath the nose—the philtrum, the inner edge of the nasal septum—thirty-six times. Press swiftly with the hand, without lifting the fingers to count. The place between the nasal septum is called the Mountain Source. The Mountain Source is also known as the Ghost Well, the Spirit Pool, the Root of Evil, and the Soul Platform. After pinching, knock the teeth seven times to clear, then bring the palm to cover the nose, look upward, and softly recite the spell:

> Vermilion Bird soars the heavens, divine might expanding within,  
> Mountain Source guards the four quarters, Ghost Well flees in flight,  
> Spirit Pool exhales breath, Evil Root lies concealed,  
> Soul Platform shines fourfold, jade chambers gleam and ring,  
> Jade Truth towers high, seated guarding the Bright Hall,  
> Hands wave purple mists, head wears morning light,  
> Holding the recitation of the Cavern Scripture, thirty-nine chapters,  
> Within are banishments of evil dragons and tigers,  
> Severing mountains, cutting steel, fierce beasts and charging bulls,  
> Clenching blades, swallowing gems, lifting mountains, boiling heavens,  
> Divine sparrow and poisonous dragon, six leaders breathe fire,  
> Devouring kings of ghosts, lightning essence and thunder father,  
> Pulling stars, flowing streams, owls peck and scorch,  
> Against the wind they stride, heavenly birds arrayed,  
> All stand by my side, breathing fire ten thousand zhang to dispel ill omens,  
> Multitudes of spirits open the Dao, sealing fallen mountain villages,  
> A thousand gods and a hundred spirits, all bow their foreheads,  
> Zewei and Wei hold the censer, burning incense for me,  
> Wherever I go, ten thousand gods welcome.

After finishing, knock the teeth three times, then open the eyes slowly and withdraw the left hand. Pressing the Mountain Source closes the Ghost Well’s gate; pressing the Spirit Pool scatters the Evil Root; pressing the Soul Platform causes Jade Truth to guard the pass. Thus the spiritual root is stirred, heavenly beasts come to protect, a thousand spirits tremble and submit, none may harm my qi. This is the natural principle, causing it to be so suddenly. The Mountain Source beneath the nose is the martial ford of the whole body, the communication mansion of truth and evil. If not true, evil qi arises; if true, it restrains all evil. It is under my control, hence portents of good and ill arise here. The Bright Hall is also the body’s pool, the dwelling of life and death’s form. Preserving its spirit allows one to gaze deeply within; abandoning its path leads to decay and rot. Therefore, by my governance and compliance with its method, life and death, regret and reluctance are determined.

This passage is taken from the Supreme Chapter of the Great Cavern’s True Scripture.

The *Inner Method of the True Person of the Great Void, Southern Peak Red Lord* says:  
On the fifth night of the lunar month, at midnight, hold the image of the sun in the heart, the sun entering through the mouth. Let it illuminate the one heart within, merging its light. When this union completes, one will feel the heart warm, the rosy glow reflecting and verifying. After a while, recite the spell:

> Great Brightness nurtures essence,  
> Within refines the elixir heart,  
> Radiance merges and shines,  
> Divine truth comes to seek.

Then swallow saliva nine times. On the fifteenth, twenty-fifth, and twenty-ninth days, repeat as above. This practice opens clarity and sharp perception, all joints become fresh and clear, the face glows with jade light, the body shines with golden luster. Practiced for fifteen years, the Great One sends a treasure chariot to welcome you, ascending to the Supreme Firmament. The number of days practiced need not be exact.

This passage is taken from the *Scripture of the Supreme One’s Dispelling of Demons*.

The *Upper Scripture of Dispelling Demons and Spiritual Clarity* says:  
If the body feels unrest, turn the tongue inward to block the throat, cough up saliva countless times. In a moment, the restless illness will be removed. In normal times, one should also feel the body relaxed and soft.

This passage is taken from the preface to the *Upper Scripture of Dispelling Demons and Spiritual Clarity*.

The *Upper Chapter of the Scripture of Dispelling Demons* says:  
The ears desire to be pressed and suppressed on left and right, also countless times, making one’s hearing clear and penetrating. This is called governing the city walls, recorded in the imperial registry. It also says: The nose desires to be pressed and obtained on left and right, also countless times, making one’s qi balanced. This is called irrigating the central mountain, recorded in the emperor’s ledger.

These two methods come from Lady Li of the Canglang Yunlin Palace.

The *Upper Massage Method of the Scripture of the Supreme Record of Hair Growth* says:  
Often, when vitality arises, swallow saliva twenty-seven times, then press the painful parts of the body, facing the king, and recite:

> Left mystery, right mystery, three spirits unite in truth,  
> Left yellow, right yellow, six flowers correspond,  
> Wind qi and evil illness lie hidden in the four directions,  
> Jade liquid flows and moistens, above and below communicating,  
> Within dispatching water and fire, without dispelling misfortune,  
> Long life flying immortal, body always rested and strong.

When finished, swallow saliva twenty-seven times again. Always so, no illness will arise. Also, urgently press the painful parts thirty-one times.

This passage comes from Lady Youying of the Canglang Yunlin Palace.

The *Scripture of the Three-Five Sequential Movements of the Elixir Character in Purple Script* says:  
When sitting, one often desires to close the eyes and look inward, holding the five viscera and intestines in mind. With long practice, one naturally gains clear and distinct understanding.

---

The *Scripture of the Stone Scene and Red Character* says:  
One can often cover mouth and nose with the hand, gaze softly, and after a long time, liquid forms in the hand, used to rub the face and eyes. Practiced constantly, it causes the body to emit fragrance.

The *Purple Degree Flame Light Inner Observation Method* says:  
One often desires to close the eyes and gaze inward, calming the body’s subtle qi, as if lying down, so that those nearby do not notice. Then inwardly observe and listen to the four directions, causing my ears and eyes to focus on affairs ten thousand li away. With long practice, one will see matters ten thousand li distant, and with a concentrated heart, see matters a million li away. Also, one often hears the sounds of gold and jade, the music of silk and bamboo—this is the wondrous method. The four directions mean overall speech; one should first start with one direction, then inwardly focus sight and hearing. At first, there is truly no imitation; after long time, one naturally enters the marvelous.

The *Scripture of the Three Diagrams of the Supreme Heavenly Gate* says:  
One often desires to press the eyes near the two inner corners by the nose with the hands, hold the breath while doing so. When the qi flows and stops, end and begin again. With constant practice, the eyes can see through all things.

These four passages are instructions given by the Master Xuan.

The *Scripture of the Great Ultimate Record* says:  
When combing the hair, one should face the king’s place, begin combing the hair, then softly recite:

> Mud pellet, mysterious flower,  
> Preserve essence and longevity,  
> Left is the hidden moon, right is the sun root,  
> The six harmonies refined, a hundred spirits receive favor.

After the spell, swallow saliva three times. Those who can constantly practice this will not lose hair and will see it grow daily. One should comb several times, taking much hair but without pain; it is also permissible to have an attendant comb and take much hair. Thus blood and fluids do not stagnate, and hair roots remain firm.

This passage was instructed for use by An Jiuhua.

The *Orthodox One’s Scripture of Peace* says:  
Hold the breath and bow in stillness, causing a hundred ghosts to fear and tremble; the officers and messengers, the dragon and tiger lords, may be seen and spoken with. This is said to be possible only for those who refine the heart and practice long. It also says: When burning incense, do not look back; looking back offends the true qi and causes evil responses. It also says: When entering the stillness gate, first place the right foot forward, then advance the left foot to align with the right. When finished, proceed to walk as usual, enabling one to open and communicate with the upper realms. It also says: When approaching food, do not speak of death or dying, nor expose the food, lest evil qi gather. It also says: Bathe often; on every Jiazi day one should bathe. If not, then bathe on the first day of some month, to enable spiritual communication. The number of baths is not the concern, but the person’s ability. To cleanse the corpse’s stench and allow true qi to enter, one must bathe.

This passage was instructed for use by the Primordial Master.

The *Scripture of the Nine Transformations and Ten Changes of the Supreme One* says:  
If one treads on filth or cold places, one should wash and bathe to release the form and remove it. The method uses ten liang of bamboo leaves and four liang of peeled white peach skin, boiled in one hu and two dou of clear water in a cauldron until it boils white, then cooled to a suitable temperature for bathing the body, which removes all filth and decay. This also dispels dampness, numbness, sores, and itching diseases. Bamboo is hollow and white inside; peach skin expels evil and breaks down filth. Thus these two substances are used to eliminate the dregs and turbidity within the form. Heaven and humans below, after returning, have never failed to use this water to cleanse themselves. As for worldly talisman water and incantation rinses and external washes, none compare to this method. If bathing, it is even better, but do not use this water for washing the hair. The essential elixir for refining the corpse is best used for bathing only. Truly wondrous and secret.

This passage was instructed for use by Lady Wang of Ziwei.
