### Scripture of the Precepts and Virtues of the Assembly of Perfected Ones of the Upper Clarity, Volume One

The Youth Lord Fangzhu Qingtong said:  
To be human and follow the dao is suffering; not to follow the dao is also suffering. Those who do not follow the dao suffer because from birth to old age, from old age to sickness, guarding the body until death—the suffering is boundless. The mind is vexed, sins accumulate, and until death they never cease; such suffering is hard to describe. Moreover, many do not even live out their appointed years. Those who follow the dao also suffer: they keep themselves pure and upright, preserve the numinous truth, guard the profound and spiritual thoughts, seek teachers with hardship and toil, tread trials hundreds of times, labor with diligence without laziness, and apply their will with firmness and carefulness—this too is suffering to the utmost. Only when one regards the rank of lords as passing guests, treasures of gold and jade as mere gravel, and the splendor of fine white cloth as tattered rags, can one be said to truly inquire of the dao.

The Western City Lord said:  
For a person to escape the Three Evil Paths and become human is difficult. Having become human, to be born female and then become male is difficult. Having become male, to possess the six emotions and four limbs complete is difficult. Having the six emotions complete, to be born in the Central Land is difficult. Having been born in the Central Land, to encounter parents and sovereigns who follow the dao is difficult. Having encountered a sovereign who follows the dao, to be born into a family that studies the dao and nurtures a kind and benevolent heart is difficult. Having such a benevolent heart, to believe in the dao and virtue of long life is difficult. Having believed in the dao and virtue of long life, to encounter the peaceful and prosperous era of the Renchen cycle is difficult. How can one not strive diligently? The Three Evil Paths are those where beings cannot become human, but instead become birds, beasts, insects, or livestock—these are called the Three Evil Paths.

The Most High asked a Daoist:  
“How long does human life last?”  
Someone answered: “Within a few days.”  
The Most High said: “You cannot be said to follow the dao.”  
Someone else answered: “Human life is between eating and drinking.”  
The Most High said: “You are gone; that is not called following the dao.”  
Someone else answered: “Life is between breaths.”  
The Most High said: “Well said, that can be called following the dao. I once heard this teaching and now tell it to you. If you learn the dao well, you may strive to master this breathing. Though my disciple may be tens of millions of li away, if the heart holds my precepts, they will surely attain the dao. Study the Jade Scripture and treasured books, and immortality will surely be attained. Those who dwell to my left, whose minds are set on evil deeds, will never attain the dao. Those who read scriptures for the dao and practice the dao are like eating honey: the mouth is sweet, the six internal organs are delighted, and there is a lingering flavor. Those who can act thus will attain the dao.”

The Youth Lord Fangzhu Qingtong said:  
For one who follows the dao, to be able to uproot the root of love and desire is like removing a suspended pearl, one by one; eventually, there will be an end. To gradually cast off external evils, evil will have an end; when it ends, the dao is attained. Again, consider the ox that bears a heavy load, trudging through mud, exhausted and daring not to stray left or right, longing only to leave the mud to refresh itself. The enlightened one views desires as that ox in the mud; with a straightforward mind focused on the dao, one can escape all suffering and attain the dao.

The True Man of the Great Void, the Red Lord of the Southern Peak, said:  
People have many faults, yet do not repent or immediately stop their minds; sins return to themselves like rivers flowing to the sea, daily deepening and widening. If one has the evil knowledge of wrong, but repents and turns to good, sins are extinguished and goodness accumulates—this too is attaining the dao. When people bring calamity upon me, I respond with blessings. Therefore, the breath of virtue and grace constantly arises here; the breath of harm and heavy disaster returns there. This is the conduct of those who study the dao.

He further said:  
Evil men harming the virtuous are like spitting toward the sky; the spit does not soil the sky but soils one’s own form. Dust raised against the wind does not soil the other side but soils one’s own body. The dao cannot be destroyed; calamity will surely destroy oneself.

The True Man of the Great Void said:  
Feeding a hundred ordinary people is not as good as feeding one virtuous person; feeding a thousand virtuous people is not as good as feeding one who studies the dao. Those who dwell in cold mountains and forests increase in virtue; this should be taken to heart.

Lady Ziyuan said:  
There are five great difficulties in the world: poverty and destitution make charity difficult; wealth and honor make studying the dao difficult; controlling fate to avoid death is difficult; obtaining and seeing the cavern scriptures is difficult; being born in the post-Renchen holy era is difficult. I once asked the Most High how one may know their predestined fate. The Most High answered: “The dao is formless; knowing it is of no use. One must guard the will and practice the dao, like polishing a mirror—when the grime is removed and the brightness remains, one sees one’s own form. Sever the six emotions, guard emptiness and stillness, then one sees the true dao and also knows predestined fate.” She further said: “Meditate on the dao, practice the dao, believe in the dao, thereby gaining the root of faith; its blessings are boundless.”

Lady Ziyuan said:  
Those who follow the dao are like one carrying fire into a dark chamber; the darkness is extinguished, and only the light remains. Those who study the dao preserve rectitude; ignorance is extinguished, and normality remains. Wealth and lust toward oneself are like a younger brother greedily tasting honey on a knife’s edge—its sweetness is insufficient to delight the mouth, and yet it risks cutting the tongue.

Lady Xuanqing said:  
People are bound by the troubles of wife, children, and household more than by prison or shackles. Prison and chains may have pardon, but the passions of wife and children, though like the jaws of a tiger, one still willingly throws oneself into them—such sins have no pardon. Attachment to passion is like carrying a torch against the wind. The foolish do not let go of the torch and will surely burn their hands. Greed, anger, and ignorance are poisons residing in the human body; if one does not early remove these calamities by the dao, disaster will surely come—like the foolish who hold fire and burn their hands. Those who follow the dao are like wood in water, seeking the current and flowing; they neither touch the left bank nor the right bank, are not taken by men nor blocked by spirits, nor do they decay. I guarantee they will enter the sea. Those who follow the dao are not confused by filthy desires, not deceived by many evils, diligent and without doubt—I guarantee they will attain the dao.

Lady Nanjixian said:  
From love arises worry; from worry arises fear of death. Without love, there is no worry; without worry, there is no fear. Once there was a man who chanted scriptures at night with great sorrow. His sorrow reached such depth that his heart was moved, and suddenly he felt a yearning to return home. The Most High True Man suddenly appeared as a mortal and went straight to ask him: “Do you play the qin?” He answered: “I often play it at home.” The True Man asked: “What if the strings are loose?” He answered: “They neither sound nor grieve.” He asked again: “What if the strings are tight?” He answered: “The sound breaks off and grieves.” He asked again: “What if the tension is just right?” He answered: “All sounds harmonize; the eight melodies are wondrously played.” The True Man said: “Studying the dao is the same. Adjusting the heart’s tuning is like playing the qin; then the dao can be attained. The greatest of desires is none greater than lust; its sin has no exception, its matter no pardon. If there is even one, and then a second, no one under heaven can follow the dao. Those who study the dao, their greatest practice of hidden virtue is to bestow kindness; the greatest relief from calamity is to guard the body and serve the dao. Their blessings are great, their life firm. If someone hates me, I do not accept the hatred; hatred returns to itself, bringing calamity back into the body, like a shadow following form and sound.”

Thus speaks the Assembly of Spirits’ Teachings on Precepts.

Three sightings are easily moved; the character *zai* is said to mean “await,” but actually means to erect a house on the Eastern Mountain, and one may fence it for protection. When asked why, no answer was seen. When asked the assembly of spirits: “Am I confusing you?” The meaning was not clear, so they wished to test it.

They often wander the mountains and marshes of the heart, entrusting themselves to immortal perfected ones; the numinous breath pities the child’s distant joy, the mountain spirits rejoice in the child’s turning transformation. Therefore, a hundred illnesses cannot harm, a hundred evils cannot invade. Those who frequently burn incense on either side are made straight in soul, and constantly hear the fragrant breath of wind; after a long time, they awaken. Upon awakening, they enter the dao; entering the dao, they become immortals; becoming immortals, they become perfected.

Quietly cherish Heaven and Earth, think of the flying immortals; quietly behold mountains and rivers, think of the flying immortals; quietly behold all things, think of the compassionate heart that covers and supports. Always hold the heart thus, and you will attain the dao. Life is like a phantom transformation, lodged between Heaven and Earth, but a brief moment only. If one gathers breath and nurtures spirit, labors and pours true essence, one will soon attain the dao. When the dao is accomplished, one dwells with Heaven and Earth, jointly lodged in the Great Nothingness. If one’s cavernous emptiness is without form, then one dwells with the Great Nothingness in silent stillness. The silent stillness is such that one sees not, hears not; the root of life and death is easily understood; the long years are easily sought; seeking, one obtains; understanding, one lasts.

Those who can last in their dao nurture wholeness; they may always wander with longevity and gather breath. When breath is whole, life exists; then one can nourish life. Nourishing life, one harmonizes with truth; then one can long ascend the two realms of vital breath. Look to nourish wholeness in silent stillness; see all things in mysterious yellow; all are but borrowed lodgings—how can one not be diligent? Breath whole repels ghosts and demons; nourishing wholeness repels a hundred harms. Enter an army and avoid weapons; walk the mountains and avoid tigers and rhinoceroses—this is what is meant.

The heart that studies the dao is always like recalling morning meal; none have failed to obtain it. Cherish breath always like cherishing the face; none have lost it. Yet faces can be damaged, so too breath can be lost. What people cherish most is the face and eyes, fearing defilement, next the four limbs. If one cherishes breath, it will always be the first urgency of the whole body. I have rarely seen it wither.

People follow customs and seek fame like burning incense; all hear the fragrance, but do not know that constant fumigation burns oneself. When burnt out, breath is extinguished; fame established, the body perishes. Therefore, the wise smile and keep their distance, thus becoming pure and tranquil. Life as a thing is like the sun, moon, and earth; these four images correspond exactly to birth and growth. If birth is lost, the four images also perish—not by the four images’ destruction, but by loss of birth. If one causes constant birth, the four images constantly endure—not because the four images endure, but because I can constantly give birth. Constant birth can also be born without light; how can the four images be counted enough? Disaster and calamity arise; form breaks and breath vanishes—what cause is there? It seems from much speech and failure to guard the One, many ends and hoping to barely escape. Thus, a hanging nest or broken branch falls; a hundred victories lost in one defeat. Alas, the talent to communicate with immortals—how can it be wasted on weak children causing ruin?

Thus speaks the Lady of the Southern Peak.

The great wild goose turns south, spreading wide its wings over the vast fields of tens and hundreds of li. The crows and doves think themselves sufficient. Yet the little cuckoo sighs at their narrowness, and the great roc smiles at the goose’s flight, which is but a few inches. If one rests in one’s ease, right and wrong suffice; thus the three crows do not discuss among themselves—why mock them?

Thus speaks the Great Emperor of the Purple Tenuity.

Weak and lost in nets and tears, the spirit not yet complete, leaning and lying on strange causes, the ladder to the clouds not yet climbed—though there is yearning for progress, one is not yet deep in the ultimate principle. Your talent is truly Heaven’s craft, condensing clear waves into lofty melodies, aspiring to dwell the spirit in the Great Mystery, hoping to tread the Purple Court and walk the void. The heart is open to flying and stillness; soft wings flourish in mysterious accords. Movement conforms to rules and compass, equal circles and distinct squares; quiet harmony tastes true flavor; breathing out and in stirs music. This can be called unrestrained and upright virtue, truly admirable. Yet filthy thoughts are not cleared, petty stinginess remains firm, lustful thoughts do not cease, the numinous pool is not clear—there will be no mutual discourse of inner and outer periods, only drifting at the junction of two scenes. Those who lose the opportunity must cherish the ability to change their appearance and release attachments; then no harm arises. Though temporarily filling many ears, thus harmony is achieved. The road ahead is distant and vast, this and that are not the same; tangled threads are many—one must always battle quietly. If feelings err and scatter, losing with the times, subtle words are few; how then to restrain or dismiss them?

On the night of the twenty-sixth day of the seventh month, Lady Youying of Yunlin gave a written message. See it but do not reply.

Clear sounds scatter the void, the spirit wind sprinkles the forest; the body transcends the dark crossroads, the will chants numinous sounds. The Benevolent Marquis is such a person. He wishes to show the beginning and end of Master Pei to Qi; surely harmony will be achieved. If not properly guided, the heart will also manifest inwardly. Who then is Pei?

### Scripture of the Precepts and Virtues of the Assembly of Perfected Ones of the Upper Clarity, Volume Two

The scripture says:  
Long ago there was Liu Shaoweng, who entered Mount Taihua many times, bowing and facing the mountain for twenty years. Then suddenly one day he saw the Elder of the Western Peak, who bestowed upon him the immortal dao. It also says:  
Long ago there was a man who came to the riverbank many mornings, bowing to the river water for ten years. The River Lord and River Earl then appeared to him, presenting ten pairs of white jade discs, teaching him the method of walking on water without drowning. This man was said to have attained the dao in the Central Peak. It also says:  
When Zuo Ci first came, he too diligently bowed to the Spirit Mountain for about five years, then gained entry to the inner and outer palaces of east and west. It also says:  
To study the dao one must be like the mountain, distant from the world; to leave worldly affairs one must be like the Clear and Numinous True Man; to tread the deep and secluded one must be like Zhou Ziyang—how could one not attain the dao? It also says:  
Set your will to diligence, refine your spirit to emptiness; what you do and make must be secret. It also says:  
On the east of Zhongmao Mountain is a small cavern, its mouth barely the size of a dog’s treasure, too small for a person to enter. The deeper one goes, the wider it becomes. Outside, a flat stone covers and seals the mouth of the cavern, so there is a small hole about the size of a cup, guarded by mountain spirits. This flat stone is sometimes opened; it is called the Gate of the Yin Palace’s Inner Gate. You must diligently fast and seek it; entering here is easier than the usual cave entrance. The usual cave entrance is sandy inside, with winding and remote paths; crossing water is not convenient, and the road is long. It is not as good as the small inner gate, which goes straight down three or four li and leads directly to the Eastern Mysterious Gate of the Yin Palace. Entering this cavern mouth two hundred steps, it is bright as daylight. It also says:  
The Great Mao Mountain also has a small cavern on the south side, similar to the first, called the Southern Convenient Gate, also sealed with stone. But by fasting and focusing on the Controller of Life, and often climbing the mountain for two days, inviting and praying, one naturally gains vision. I am sincere indeed—how could the Yin Palace be unworthy of viewing? Who then is Zuo Ci?

The Life Controller of Mao said:  
If one must model oneself on Fan Xuan’s grasp of images, the pure contention of rare moments, then one will uproot the many hidden weeds, fold wings and perch high, sense flavors and ascend accords, the abyss halts and mountains stand, desolate jade tablets, precious spirits born, abandoning worldly attachments, tuning and playing the clear and numinous, clarifying the bright void within, the Five Ways manifest, colors cease and waves transform, desiring to blend with the vast calm, the empty cavern and dark crossroads, no seeing nor hearing. Then you are far from the subtle perfected ones, reawakening mysterious awareness, inner virtue full, numinous markers complete. Ultimately able to harness cloud carriages to ascend the heavens, inscribing the Life Controller’s cinnabar records. If spirit scatters into ten thousand thoughts, life is unstable, breath follows dust waves, the heart is not truly at rest, this only burdens body and spirit in forested hills—indeed a mistake for those who come to learn. The dao is subtle and easy to seek, yet difficult to obtain.

The Supreme Life Controller, Lady Wei of the Southern Peak, said:  
Yesterday I went with the Life Controller of Mao to the Palace of Clear Emptiness, to examine the gains and losses of true immortals. Recently, forty-seven people were suddenly removed, and three were reinstated, also reviewing your names on the list. Now they have departed; only Xu Miao remains in the immortal records. At first I did not realize this, but now it is better. Those who cleanse their hearts and strive diligently, focusing on principle fully, their heart cinnabar and will exhausted, like walking on ice and fire—if they persist long thus, even the True Man cannot escape, nor can the immortal dao hide. But they must suppress and sever lustful thoughts, then we may see them and instruct them.

The Fixed Record says:  
Immortals are raised by the lower officials. The Most High Old Master Laozi will again be remembered. People of Jiangdong have not yet seen such diligence in the dao. Yet one should not rely on immortals and forget the dao. It also says:  
Falsehood is the sickness of virtue; vanity is the disaster of the body; stagnation is the head of loss; shame is the key to the body. Remove these four difficulties, then one may begin to inquire of the dao. Thus the numinous axle and sounding yoke have daily imitations. If the heart harbors lustful faults, do not practice the Supreme True Dao. Yesterday I saw the Palace of Clear Emptiness, precisely removing these names, and now they are again examined, to be judged by the Three Officials. Should one not be cautious?

Thus speaks Lady of the Southern Peak.

The Clear and Numinous True Man said:  
When stinginess is forgotten, gain is different; if shame is not removed, the record of life is not written. Though Registrar Xu has temporarily removed it, he will have it removed and then restored again.

Lady of the Southern Peak said:  
The Eastern Official of Life knows well the kindness and severity of Registrar Xu. A minor Heavenly King asked yesterday: “Where is this person now? What dao does he cultivate?” The Eastern Official answered: “He is a scholar from my hometown, internally clear and true, externally mixed in worldly affairs, a good talent. Now he cultivates the Supreme True Dao.” This speech praises the person’s intent, somewhat resembling an immortal’s form.

The True Man Ziyang said:  
Let Xu Yufu bathe several times, dispelling the water illness breath, dissolving the accumulated obstructions and lumps. This is also the step to reaching truth.

Lady Ziwei said:  
Bathing not enough harms the soul’s nature. Opposing the soul is the reverse; refining its turbid filth, the soul itself perishes.

Lady Youying of Yunlin said:  
Opposing stagnation is like rescuing the poor by practicing virtue—is this not excellent? Do not worry about virtue’s lack of reward; worry only that the seeds of virtue are not many. This one practice is like tilling the field of blessings. All matters are thus.

Lady Youying said:  
From ancient times until now, life and death have a crossing, manifest and hidden meetings, storing past and extinguishing wisdom—those who follow the world’s ways all practice the dao. As for the jade elixir one dose, the nine blossoms three flights, the cloud liquid drunk at dawn, the flowing yellow lingering, looking up to swallow golden nectar, chewing jade resin—immediately one controls the light and ascends the void, mysteriously rising to the Great Subtle. Since worldly affairs diverge from mystery, this work is not yet complete. One should temporarily tread the Great Yin, secretly be born in the dark village, abandon the outer body’s substance, nurture the fetus in the empty abode, refine breath and sever keys, receive essence and mysterious darkness. Thus one changes form in the three yin mansions, gains a youthful face at the nine refinements’ gate. Then one knows the marvel of spirit immortals: death but not perishing, coming and going—this matter is deeply reasoned.

The Fixed Record of Mao said:  
The phoenix nests in tall trees, dressed in pure white robes, walking the path of thought to the end, concentrating heart on emptiness and mystery. The Five Lords’ stone fat is convenient for the body; one should quickly wear it to slightly brighten the face. The three and eight orders shine clearly, next practicing mysterious truth, releasing the carriage and resting—this can be called the cave chapter. Jade blades respond in number, the refined heart perches high, hidden and silent, right qi not diminished, dispersing techniques and removing illness—this is what you should do. Next take the □ meal, along with grains, do not violate, nourish marrow and remove illness, fatten skin and fill flesh, then ascend the mountain, chant the cave and explain the subtle. The tiger of Yin and the white teeth—then you see the opportunity and thus attain immortality. After passing the Renchen cycle, rest in the flourishing wood, delight in the Zhou books, the Great Ultimate plants the slips, the golden name of Western Splendor, study whether to wear or not, rest should respond to numinous talismans, principle differs yet accords, spirit and cavern seek each other.

The Life Protector of Mao said:  
When words are encountered, they must be used; not using them is heartlessness. How can one ride sudden traces, seek the spirit in the void? Subtle sounds have meaning—use them carefully, do not take lightly. In all matters respond to spirit’s mechanism; I protect you to see peace.
