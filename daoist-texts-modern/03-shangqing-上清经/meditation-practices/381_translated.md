## Scripture of the Perfected Person of Supreme Clarity and Great Ultimate

### The Great Ultimate Perfected Person’s Prescription of the Four Extremities’ Cloud Fang Immortals

Female disciple Wei Huacun received the Pure Void Perfected Person’s formula.

The Perfected Person embraces the radiance of the five directions’ primal dawn, consumes the essence of the nine mists; thus the spirit’s light shines within, vermilion blossoms display without, the body produces jade reflections, form and qi are bright. After practicing ten years, the Elder of the Four Extremities, the Central Primal Lord, descends. Upon the disciple, he merges and mounts the cloud chariot and dragon, ascending the heavens in broad daylight.

In ancient times, the Great Ultimate Perfected Person, the Western Liang Master Ziwen, received the Supreme Patriarch’s secret formula, passed down five times over a thousand years, never to be rashly revealed. The methods of Four Brightnesses follow the hidden scriptures’ regulations: first fasting five days before transmission, then making a blood pact, dripping five pairs of gourd-shaped drops, as a solemn celestial-human oath to keep the secret, the formula sealed in five pairs of rings. Also, five taels of blue silk are used, said to be the Western Liang Perfected Person’s method; the Lady of Southern Mountain says cloud-tassel silk may also be used, but this scripture does not mention it.

At the time of cockcrow before dawn, one sits in sleep-meditation, freely resting, knocking teeth nine times until fully connected, then intones the secret invocation:

> Eastward, blue fang, purple clouds flowing mists, three pure ones wandering, mysterious frost jade gauze, consume the morning radiance, drink the dawn’s splendor.

Upon finishing the invocation, one licks the upper lip’s outer edge with the tongue, gathers saliva, and swallows thirty times. After ten years, the Elder of the East Extremity arrives, bestowing the disciple with the cinnabar and azure true talisman; merged as one, they ascend together.

Next, the secret invocation:

> Southward, vermilion cinnabar, mists shining in the Great Microcosm, nine paths of scarlet smoke, spreading radiant brilliance, consume the numinous dawn, drink from the cinnabar pool.

Upon finishing, lick the outer lower lip with the tongue, gather saliva, swallow thirty times. After ten years, the Elder of the South Extremity arrives, granting the disciple the cinnabar radiance talisman; merged as one, they ascend.

Next, the secret invocation:

> Westward, bright stone, flying mists of golden liquid, consume the Great Brightness, essence of pure spirit, drink jade nectar, spirit’s brilliance awakens the numinous, enabling me to ascend the void, rise to clear heights.

Upon finishing, lick the inner upper lip with the tongue, gather saliva, swallow thirty times. After ten years, the Elder of the West Extremity arrives, granting the disciple the pure talisman of awe-inspiring power; merged as one, they ascend.

Next, the secret invocation:

> Northward, mysterious nourishment, auspicious clouds awaken the embryo, green spirit spreads the dawn, purple canopy, azure banner, consume the moon’s splendor, drink the precious honey.

Upon finishing, lick the inner lower lip with the tongue, gather saliva, swallow thirty times. After ten years, the Elder of the North Extremity arrives, granting the disciple the mysterious register of precious covenant; merged as one, they ascend.

Another secret incantation:

> The primal forces of Wu and Ji, yellow essence of five clouds, four mists and purple observatories, eight scenes and nine dawns, two lights stir brilliance, seven luminaries, numinous reverence, harmonize essence and pour qi, consume the central origin, exquisite jade embryo, drink from the sweet spring.

Upon finishing, rinse the mouth full with the tongue, the mysterious chest inside and out, between tongue and teeth, enveloping all surfaces, gather saliva and swallow thirty times. After ten years, the Central Primal Lord and the Supreme Sovereign Mysterious Yellow Elder Lord descend, granting the disciple the yellow qi and yang essence, hidden heavenly moon escape, green radiance chapter, azure essentials, tiger script; all merge with the four elders and ascend together.

This jade scripture’s supreme formula leads to the Way of the Five Elders, cutting off grains and shedding the corpse, face blooming with youthful color, unbothered by cold or heat, unharmed by disasters, spirit and immortal clarity, extending life and advancing the calendar, increasing lifespan by ten thousand years. When one attains the nine exquisite jade liquids and eight precious flying clarities, the two radiances merge, heaven and earth correspond.

These five secret spirit invocations all require knocking teeth nine times fully connected; they may be practiced regularly, not only at cockcrow before dawn. At midnight, when the body is still and spirit clear, in leisure and quietude, one may undertake them.

Those who guard the One within the home, upon hearing this Way, affairs swiftly succeed. The clouds thin within, guarding inwardly, filling the primal saliva—this may be called true unity, seeking much blessing oneself. By guiding the spirit with six fluids and five qì, the qì and fluids are cultivated by oneself, thus it is called seeking much blessing oneself.

If one cultivates this Way, one may eat qì; if hunger arises, one may eat grain foods, gradually reducing grains, never abandoning them suddenly for a single day. This is called diminishing and diminishing again, until reaching non-action.

This Way of empty reflection is the work of nature itself, called drawing from the essence of heaven and earth afar, and drawing from the body nearby—this is what is meant. Cloud Fang is the essence qì of the Five Elders, the mists and smoke of the Great Ultimate; thus one gathers the sharpness of radiance and brilliance to fill the harmony of six fluids, opening the subtle mysterious responses, myriad spirits descend, shadow and reflection seek each other, responding without chanting. Thus the dragon’s roar fills the abyss, the radiance clouds fall to the sky; the tiger’s roar shakes the numinous mountains, the wind stirs in four directions; the yang fire blazes brightly and vermilion flames rise; the square is rare in yin, and mysterious flows overflow naturally, unnoticed and immeasurable. Moreover, the practitioner focuses the mind on mystery, diligently researching the root of the Way, clearing away filth and burdens in the chest, true unity residing in the three palaces, gathering the scattered radiance of five dawns, consuming the misty nectar of six sweet liquids, invoking the nine heavens’ wondrous treasures, emitting the secret words of wondrous spirit, the dragon’s radiance leaps forth, bright light shines sevenfold, tasting the three blossoms on white teeth, taking precious liquid at the lip’s edge, refining the six viscera within, opening clarity and insight, breathing the heavenly origin, refining soul and spirit, morning mystery dispatches the primal, reaching spiritual cultivation. After ten years, the five spirits descend—what more need be said? Though a woman and weak, she completes the supreme work, her faint voice and silent sounds not to be proclaimed. Merely recounting the marvel to enlighten those of like mind; if one’s virtue is insufficient, then one should not blame or disparage.

The above is the preface by Lady Wei of Southern Mountain.

## The Pure and Numinous Perfected Person’s Scripture of the Spirit Treasure

To fix the heart on the true Way, to imagine the numinous person, even in darkness one supervises the intent. If outer difficulties are not yet dispelled, chanting and reciting remain, truly unable to return to the years of Western Elm, again manifesting in the mysterious child. If one indulges in profound and earnest diligence, even if the teeth are carved and the face wrinkled, the neck growing pure blossoms, our Way can transform it into an infant in a moment. Just ask about the spirit’s resolve—there is no place for learning old or young; I go to that person.

## Supreme Profound True Upper Scripture

The Eastern Official of Life says: The former master Lord Wang once received the *Supreme Bright Hall Profound True Upper Scripture*, fasting and resting, storing sun and moon in the mouth, storing the sun by day, the moon by night, making them as large as a ring. The sun is red, with nine purple rays; the moon is yellow, with ten white rays. Swallowing and consuming the liquid of the rays, constantly and secretly practicing countless times. If not cultivating storage, the sun and moon return to reside in the bright hall of the face, the sun on the left, the moon on the right, making the two radiances merge with the pupils, qi communicating. This Way governs the movement to produce essence, harmonizes soul and spirit; six spirits attend, heavenly soldiers guard. This is the Way of the Supreme True. Its *Supreme Profound True Scripture* is first sworn to, then practiced; only then can one hear the Way of jade pendants and golden earrings.

In former times, Ji Wei meditated and fasted three years, sincerely exhausting single thought, thus able to receive it; then the spirit light shone on the body, and only then did he receive the scripture. This profound true Way is essential yet not complicated; I always treasure the secret, keep it in my bosom, thus showing it only to those cautious and secretive. The Bright Hall Profound True has its own scripture, but it is few and small. Generally, the formulas are just as practiced. Ji Wei did not obtain the scripture but practiced according to this and thus obtained the scripture. If you wish to obtain it, you may go to Wei to get the scripture. The jade pendant hidden scripture was not seen by Wei.

Taking immortality medicine should be aligned with one’s own life fate; after taking it, do not immediately engage in death, mourning, or misfortune, which harms the fetal spirit, merely taking original benefit. At night walking and lying down, if afraid in the heart, store the sun and moon back into the bright hall; in a moment, a hundred evils are extinguished. Mountain dwelling is always best.

Daily, one presses the small acupoint behind the two eyebrows three times nine, then rubs the palms and fingers over the cheekbones thirty times, then cups the ears, no fixed time required. Afterwards, reverse the hand pressing the forehead three times nine, starting from between the eyebrows, going upward into the hairline, swallowing saliva countless times. Practicing this constantly, the eyes become clear and bright; within a year, one may write at night. This may also be done secretly on others, but do not speak of its form.

The small acupoint behind the eyebrows is the palace of the Supreme Origin’s Six Harmonies, governing the production of eye radiance, harmonizing pure essence and light, preserving the pearl’s clarity, protecting the eye spirit—this is the Perfected Person’s Way of sitting up. Also called the Perfected Person’s Constant Abode within the Inner Scripture. The Perfected Person says: If you wish to write at night, you must cultivate the Constant Abode. The Perfected Person can observe all directions, illuminating the eight corners; truly the number of the Emperor Sovereign.

Below the eyes on the cheekbones is the decisive bright treasure chamber returning the infant to the Way. Using the hand cupping the ear is the deep method of illumination. Here principle opens blood and disperses, wrinkles do not arise, eye brilliance shines mysteriously, harmonizing spirit and filling vigor. As people age, few do not begin with ears and eyes. Signs of aging the form also begin at the edges of the eyes.

Using the hand to cup the forehead, inside is the infant, sun and moon’s twin radiance, Supreme Origin’s joy, three primals begin at the eyebrows; after counting, one stops. This is called the hand facing the three primals to strengthen the brain and firm the hair. The head’s four sides, using both hands to cup, smoothing hair into knots, only making more. Thus head blood disperses, wind and dampness do not congeal. Finally, pressing the four corners of the eyes twice nine, feeling the light clearly, this is the Way to test the eye spirit. Long practice grants seeing a hundred spirits.

The method of seeking the Way requires clear eyes and keen ears as the master of affairs. Moreover, ears and eyes are the ladder to seek truth, the gateway to gather spirit; gain or loss depends on them, survival or death must be distinguished. Now copying the scripture to show, it may also be applied.

Those who take the “□ rice” are unharmed by a hundred evils, illnesses cannot affect them, thoughts vanish, the three corpses are extinguished, ears and eyes become keen, walking light and soaring. After ten years, the spirit of blue essence commands and sends orders; sitting or standing, one can hide, transform, and escape, summoning wind and cloud. In years of misfortune with no grain, the poor who cannot obtain it, take only southern candle and tuckahoe, or with honey, southern candle mixed with pine and cypress leaves. On meeting days, they combine; not only must one have grain, but it must not be called “□ rice.” All should be combined with breathing and swallowing saliva to harmonize nourishment and defense, always thus. “□ rice” must use cloud sprouts; cloud sprouts do not require “□ rice.” When many act, using ancient scales, daily consumption is two and a half he. Taking too much is not feared, only not having enough is a concern; thus two and a half he is the limit. At first taking medicine, it is inconvenient to stop grain. This is the famous prescription of the upper immortals, the wondrous Way to abandon food.

The *Great Cavern True Scripture* is the treasure book of the Central Yellow Elder Lord; only the most famous Supreme True Daoists may see its chapters and sections. Among true immortals, many have not heard of this book. Initially limited to one copy every one hundred years, passed to those who can complete it and are cautious. Later, counting three hundred and five hundred years, again daring to transmit to one person, only three transmissions total. The years are limited by oath; those who receive it are said to be granted. Unauthorized transmission before the time, leaking and violating the oath, old or unworthy persons, and revealing heavenly patterns, all are sins leading to hell.

The *Supreme Jade Ceremony Text Binding Chapter* is the spiritual secret treasure chapter of the Supreme Jade Emperor Sovereign, stored in the Nine Heavens’ room of cinnabar and jade chamber. Only those diligent in heart and true, with records of flying mysterious heavenly immortals from past lives, may see or hear it. Its chapters may not be rashly spoken or named. Those who rashly speak and name it offend the four punishments and are unforgiven by the Three Officials of Heaven and Earth. Initially limited to one transmission every three hundred years, later one every seven hundred years, each person may only receive two transmissions. According to the oath, those who receive it are said to be granted. Unauthorized transmission before the time, leaking and violating the oath, old or unworthy persons, are merely revealing heavenly patterns. Anyone who reveals heavenly books dies as a low ghost; the three ancestors judge, encountering cruel punishment, burning, and slaughter. The profound method, Supreme Law oath, Jade Child supervises and hastens judgment. Beware calamity, calamity reaches one’s ancestors and parents. Without the full time limit, even meeting immortals, one must keep silent; those who keep silent gain distance. The *Great Cavern True Scripture* is limited to five hundred years, granted to three people, no further transmission.

The *Supreme Jade Ceremony Text Binding Chapter* is limited to seven hundred years, granted to two people; exceeding two, no further transmission. Those not meant to receive it may not rashly name persons or chapters; speaking is leaking.

The *Supreme Jade Ceremony Text Binding Chapter* leads to the spirit of sun and moon, ascending to sun and moon, connecting heavenly light, the Way of flying through the void. All ride cloud carriages and feather canopies, commanding myriad dragons, ascending to the imperial purple court.

The *Great Cavern True Scripture* leads to the Way of morning spirit, summoning gods to become perfected persons. Riding clouds, mounting dragons, leaping through mystery and void, wearing embroidered feathers, adorned with golden true jade light, wandering the great mists, ascending to the Nine Heavens. This true book is the secret essence of the Heavenly Emperor, subtle and wondrous.

The Supreme Origin Perfected Person still conceals its chapters. Merely two matters are mentioned, kept secret. How could the world know its order? Those who meet and obtain it, with utmost sincerity and good will, still must observe rituals; fasting and special instructions differ, not uniform.

Those who leak the *Great Cavern True Scripture* cause the profound method to lose one scripture, Jade Child and Jade Maiden each lose one person. Three leaks cause death, no further immortal attainment.

Those who leak the *Supreme Jade Ceremony Text Binding Chapter* cause Jade Child and Jade Maiden each to lose ten persons; the text fails and returns to heaven. If leaked again, death ensues, no further Way learning, never becoming immortal. Those who leak or rashly speak chapters face judgment by the Three Officials; the master must, at the time of death, return to the netherworld to remove corpse and erase traces. Only those granted may transmit.

Those who receive it all take oaths with blue gold and cinnabar silk, sealed in ornate boxes, then may release it. Masters report upward, with sun and moon offerings. Not following regulations is false transmission. In the northern cave of Mount Emei, in the stone chamber’s door pivot, is carved: “Ceremony leads sun essence, binds moon spirit, attaining the Way to the upper palace, titled gentleman perfected person.” Twenty characters. Lower immortals reading this carving do not understand its meaning. Many immortals have not seen its chapters.

### Purple Script Spiritual Writings: Method to Gather and Swallow Sun Qì

The Supreme Clarity Golden Palace Spiritual Writings Purple Script method to gather and consume the flying root and swallow sun qì was once received from the Great Microcosm Heavenly Emperor Sovereign. Also called the Scripture of Red Cinnabar, Golden Essence, Stone Radiance, and Water Mother. One should always imagine seeing the sun’s first rising, facing east, knocking teeth nine times fully connected, then silently invoking in the heart the sun spirit’s name and the five emperors’ characters within the sun:

> Sun spirit, pearl radiance, shining armor, green reflection, returning mists, red child, mysterious flame, whirlwind image.

After invoking these sixteen characters, close eyes firmly, imagine seeing five-colored flowing mists within the sun all coming to meet the body, reaching down to the feet. Also imagine the five qì rising to the crown. Then the sun’s light and mists of five colors all enter the mouth. Within the sun’s light and mists, there are again dozens of purple qì as large as pupils, shining brilliantly among the five lights, called flying root water mothers. Together with the five qì, they enter the mouth. Facing the sun, swallow the mists with forty-five breaths. After swallowing the breath, swallow saliva nine times, then knock teeth nine times fully connected, softly intoning:

> Red furnace cinnabar qì, complete heaven nurturing essence, firm receiving softness, fiery water yin essence, sun and stars’ primal radiance, called Great Brightness, eight and nine yang transformations, two smokes simultaneously born, condensing soul and harmonizing spirit, essence of five qì, born within five emperors, riding light governing form, gathering flight to emptiness, plucking roots to fullness, head wrapped in dragon blossoms, wearing vermilion belt and blue, bridled black flowing mysterious, mists reflecting Supreme Clarity, granting jade scrolls, engraving names in empty pavilion, consuming morning splendor, merging with true spirit, visiting immortals of Great Microcosm, ascending to the purple court.

Upon finishing the invocation, bow twice to the sun.

Among true immortals, more than ten thousand, none know the sun spirit’s name. This Way is profound and mysterious, not to be heard by those who consume blood and rotten corpses. On cloudy days without sun, one may perform it in a clean and pure room. Pure cultivators skilled in upper responses may practice without seeing the sun. If Daoists fast in mountains and forests, long fasting at the Five Mountains, severing dust of the world, deeply seeking purity and truth, daily consuming the sun root’s mists and swallowing the sun’s essence, they immediately feel the body producing jade luster, face glowing with flowing light. If still entangled in worldly affairs, unable to still the form, wandering the worldly path, heart bound and restricted, then on the first, third, fifth, seventh, ninth, thirteenth, fifteenth, seventeenth, nineteenth, and twenty-fifth days of the moon, practice accordingly—ten times within a month. These days are when the sun spirit descends, flying roots fill, water mother clusters dream. Practicing eighteen years, Supreme Clarity will refine with golden truth, shining with jade light, attaining true immortal rank, flying through the great void, riding the three pure blossoms, roaming the world.

### Purple Script Spiritual Writings: Method to Gather and Consume Moon Essence

The Supreme Clarity Golden Palace Purple Script method to gather and consume yin splendor and swallow moon essence was once received from the Great Microcosm Heavenly Emperor Sovereign. Also called the Scripture of Yellow Qi, Yang Essence, Hidden Heaven, and Moon. One should imagine seeing the moon’s first rising, facing west, knocking teeth ten times fully connected, silently invoking the moon spirit’s name and the five ladies’ characters within the moon:

> Moon spirit, warm, delicate, fragrant, beautiful, bright, empty, numinous, orchid, fragrant, splendid, binding, elegant, still, golden, clear, camp, bright, appearance, platform, standard.

After invoking these twenty-four characters, close eyes firmly, imagine seeing five-colored flowing essence within the moon all coming to meet the body, reaching down to the feet. Also imagine the five qì rising to the crown. Then the moon’s light and essence of five colors all enter the mouth. Within the moon’s light and essence, there are dozens of yellow qi as large as pupils, layered and numerous, accompanying the five-colored moon essence light, called flying yellow moon splendor essence. Together with the five qì, they enter the mouth. Facing the moon, swallow essence with fifty breaths. After swallowing breath, swallow saliva ten times, knock teeth ten times fully connected, softly intoning:

> Yellow clear mysterious radiance, primal yin upper qì, dispersing vast cold whirlwind, gathering clouds constrict stomach, empty orchid spirit, erect pure vessel, moon essence night scene, noble in mysterious palace, five lord ladies, named guardian mothers, red child flying in, infant continuing, returning yin threefold, light mysterious myriad directions, harmonizing soul and controlling spirit, five wombs flowing and communicating, riding mists flying essence, escaping void to east, head tied with numinous clouds, radiant splendor summoning wind, left wearing dragon talisman, right holding tiger emblem, phoenix feather vermilion cloak, jade pendant golden earring, soaring trees binding a, called Wood King, divine toad controlling roots, full bright essence, internally reflecting mysterious water, spitting beam granting writings, jade tablets engraving names, cloud chamber consuming, sun and moon essence splendor, merging with true spirit, flying immortal purple microcosm, ascending to the Supreme Emperor.

Upon finishing the invocation, bow twice to the moon. Store sun and moon, sitting or standing as convenient.

Among immortals, none know the moon spirit’s name; only the perfected person of that time knew. On cloudy nights without moon, one may perform indoors, practicing the key as with consuming sun light. Evening after evening consuming it, one immediately feels the body producing shining light, eyes having flying essence. The key days are the second, fourth, sixth, eighth, tenth, sixteenth, eighteenth, twentieth, twenty-second, and twenty-fourth days of the moon—ten times within a month—enough to become immortal. On these evenings, yin essence flies and merges, three qì fill and overflow, moon water crystallizes splendor, yellow spirit descends to connect. Practicing eighteen years, Supreme Clarity will refine soul and exchange spirit, reflecting jade light, riding mysterious reins of radiance, flying through the great void.

### Purple Script Spiritual Writings: Consume the Great Profound Yin-born Talisman

*(Original talisman missing)*

Upon finishing the invocation, swallow the talisman.

### Purple Script Spiritual Writings: Method to Restrain the Three Souls

On the third, thirteenth, and twenty-third evenings of the moon, at this time, the three souls are unsettled: the *Suangling*, *Tai Guang*, and *Youjing* wander. The *Suangling*, *Tai Guang*, and *Youjing* are the three soul spirits’ names. On these evenings, they all roam the body, drifting away from their chamber, sometimes seen and restrained by other souls or ghosts, sometimes caught by demons, sometimes unable to return, leaving form and releasing substance, sometimes violating outer souls, two qì battling, all restless red children, causing other thoughts, coming and going without form, heart sorrowful and mind troubled. Daoists should restrain and control them, preventing wandering.

The method of restraint: lie down properly, remove pillow, stretch feet, cross palms upward, close eyes and hold breath for three breaths, knock teeth three times fully connected, imagine red qì like a chicken egg, rising from within through the eyes, outside the red qì grows large, burning the body, enveloping the whole body, making inside and outside transparent like glowing charcoal. When finished, one feels a small heat in the body; then knock teeth three times fully connected, then silently call the three souls’ names: *Tai Guang*, *Suangling*, *Youjing*, the three spirits quickly settle. Then softly intone:

> Great Microcosm Mysterious Palace, central yellow begins blue, internally refining three souls, *Tai Guang* peaceful, spirit treasure jade chamber, born with me, do not move rashly, observer is most numinous. If wishing to fly, only permitted to go to Great Ultimate Supreme Clarity; if hungry or thirsty, only permitted to drink return water jade essence.

### Purple Script Spiritual Writings: Method to Control the Seven Spirits

On the new moon, full moon, and last moon nights, at this time, the seven spirits wander, roaming filth and impurity, sometimes connecting with blood and food, going to ghosts and demons; sometimes relating to dead corpses; sometimes lusting after red children, gathering to harm homes; sometimes reporting human sins to the Three Officials and River Lord; sometimes transforming into goblins and spirits, causing people to loathe demons; sometimes causing ghosts to enter the body, calling evil killing substances. All residual sicknesses in people are sins of the spirits; delighting in death is the spirits’ nature; desiring human ruin is the spirits’ disease. Daoists should restrain and punish them, display and transform them, govern and correct them, capture and awe them.

The first spirit is named Corpse Dog; the second, Hidden Arrow; the third, Sparrow Yin; the fourth, Swallowing Thief; the fifth, Non-Poison; the sixth, Removing Filth; the seventh, Stinking Lung.

These are the seven spirits’ names, the impure ghosts within the body. The method to restrain and inspect: lie properly, remove pillow, stretch feet, cover ears with palms, fingertips touching behind the neck, hold breath for seven breaths, imagine white qì like a small bean at the nose tip, gradually growing to crown the body ninefold, reaching feet and head. When the head is complete, the white qì suddenly transforms into heavenly beasts: two blue dragons in the eyes, two white tigers in the nostrils, all facing outward; above the heart toward the mouth, a blue turtle under the left foot, a numinous snake under the right foot. In both ears are jade maidens wearing mysterious brocade clothes, at the ear gates, each hand holding firelight. After a while, all is complete; then swallow saliva seven times, knock teeth seven times fully connected, call the seven spirits’ names, then intone:

> Pure qì nine turns, restrain spirits and remove harm, heavenly beasts guard gates, delicate maidens hold the passes, refine spirits and harmonize softness, be at peace with me, do not move rashly, observe the source of form. If hungry or thirsty, listen to drink moon yellow and sun cinnabar.

Thus the seven spirits are closed within, restrained and governed. If practiced regularly, the spirits’ impurities diminish, returning to goodness and harmonizing form, harmonizing the three palaces, merging with the primal spirit. One person’s body has three primal palace gods, the life gate has the Mysterious Gate Supreme Lady, and the three soul spirits, altogether seven gods within form, intending to grant long life, benevolent and greatly auspicious lords. The seven spirits are also born within one body but act as enemies attacking it; thus they must be restrained. Daoists only know how to seek immortality methods but not how to restrain spirits, thus do not avoid futile effort.

The three primal palaces’ locations: the upper primal palace is in the mud pellet; its god is the Red Child, named Three Primal Ancestor, also called Imperial Official; the middle primal palace is at the center of the crimson chamber; its god is the Perfected Person, named Zinan Dan, also called Middle Light Firm; the lower primal palace, the elixir field below the navel three cun, its god is the infant, named Yuanyangzi, also called Valley Below Mysterious. These three are one god. When restraining and controlling souls and spirits, first silently call their names, imagining the three gods all jade-colored gold light, with infant appearances; the upper and middle primals wear red clothes, the lower primal yellow clothes, heads like newborn infants. When practicing the Way and taking qì, one should also silently call their names.

The life gate is the navel. The Mysterious Gate is the passage of the first-born fetal intestines. Within is the birth palace, housing the great lord named Peach Child, styled Heyan, wearing a vermilion kerchief and purple crown, sitting at the life gate, with the three soul spirits attending. The great lord always holds the Heavenly Sovereign’s elephant talisman to harmonize and inject primal qì, supplement the fetus and restore the womb. At evening rest, first hold breath twenty-four breaths, then silently invoke the great lord’s name three times, swallow saliva fifty times, knock teeth three times, then intone:

> Fetal spirit great lord, imperial elephant heavenly sovereign, holding the womb talisman, head kerchief purple crown, yellow returns red turns, upper essence life gate, transform spirit and regenerate, six harmonies mutually cause, form and body shining, jade maiden dwelling.

Practicing this for eighteen years, the great lord will be able to stimulate the three fields on the left, govern the three qì on the right; the fields transform into flying chariots, the qì into mysterious dragons, commanding twenty-four gods above, summoning soul spirits below, calling the six yang officials, summoning the six yin spirits, a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, ascending to the heavens in broad daylight. This is all the effect of Lord Peach. Though the Way is small, it is also worthy of regard.

### Purple Script Spiritual Writings: Consume the Heavenly Sovereign’s Elephant Talisman

*(Original talisman missing)*

The Heavenly Sovereign’s elephant talisman is entrusted to the life official great lord Peach Child Heyan, to harmonize primal qì, govern the womb, and circulate essence. Written in vermilion on blue paper, taken at new moon or full moon midnight, facing north. Hold the talisman with the left hand, hold breath, silently invoke:

> Heavenly Emperor mysterious writing, imperial elephant spiritual talisman, to harmonize primal qì, govern essence and womb, ten thousand years infant, flying weary heavenly pivot, birth palace great lord, wearing cinnabar robe, head wearing purple crown, conspiring with me.

Upon finishing the invocation, swallow the talisman, then rise and bow twice. Take the talisman on the sleeping bed.

If Daoists practice the method of returning essence, turning yellow to red, morning essence irrigating life, pouring saliva and liquid, causing male and female to share cinnabar, face producing jade luster, they should know the great lord’s name and take the Heavenly Sovereign’s elephant talisman to attain unaging. If only practicing without knowing the god’s name, returning essence without knowing to take the talisman, not seeing the invocation or understanding the palace residence, even if granted a thousand years’ life, they return to corpse under the Great Yin, merely accumulating years of life, thus should return bones to the Three Officials.

If Daoists lie down in the evening, silently thinking of the great lord, the method of invocation is to take the talisman at new and full moon, to circulate fetal essence benefits. Thus also becoming immortal, without the troublesome male and female supplement methods. Yet controlling women to fly and soar, circulating qì to seek heavenly immortals, the dangers are greater than water and fire, killing faster than axe and knife. Unless one is disheartened and embraces unity, one may not gain but lose. If of middling talent and wanting to practice, like swallowing a sword and wanting the throat to swallow without harm, how could it be possible?

The birth palace great lord forbids eating raw blood, forbids burning six livestock hairs, forbids burning garlic, onion skins and leaves, and all kinds of meat dishes, all disrupt fetal qì, foul and harm infant spirit—beware.

Take talisman for each of the eight solar terms, sixteen days each. On the first day of the first month, take the treasure chapter talisman in blue writing.

Between the eyebrows, one cun higher, penetrating bone three fen, left is crimson platform blue chamber, right is yellow gate purple door. Penetrating seven fen is the bright hall palace; three gods all sit facing outward, wearing green brocade clothes. Penetrating one square cun is the crimson chamber palace, the self soul god, wearing red embroidered clothes. Penetrating one square cun is the mud pellet palace. The heart’s central square cun is the crimson palace. Two and a half cun below the navel is the lower cun, penetrating three cun of skin, inside the square cun is the elixir field palace.

Above are the head’s central platform gate, bright hall, bridal chamber, mud pellet palace, and heart and navel lower elixir field locations.

Daoists sitting, lying, walking, eating, drinking, joy, sorrow, and gazing—all should maintain unity. The stored gods all appear as newborn infants, all made to resemble the palaces within. The method of storage makes each platform gate have one god, clothing method within the platform gate. Next, store the three gods of the bright hall, the bridal chamber self soul form. Next, store the mud pellet, heart crimson palace, and navel lower elixir field palace; all palaces have purple, blue, and crimson three qì misty smoke. Within the mud pellet palace’s purple qì is the Northern Dipper’s seven stars covering the dipper, pointing forward with the ladle; under the dipper in the blue crimson two qì, left is the infant, right is the imperial official, both wearing embroidered splendid clothes. Also store in the heart’s three qì smoke, left is spirit pearl, right is assistant emperor, both wearing vermilion brocade clothes. Also store in the navel lower elixir field’s three qì, left is infant, right is assistant official, both wearing yellow embroidered gauze clothes. At midnight, after storing according to the month’s branch, also store the mud pellet palace purple qì, from between the eyebrows, like a large tendon, straight up piercing the sky, shining nine thousand li, imagining nine thousand ears counting. Next store the heart’s vermilion smoke, from the heart’s front hollow, like a large tendon, straight up piercing the sky, shining three thousand li qì, placed within the purple qì. Next store the navel lower elixir field’s white qì, from the navel, like a large tendon, straight up piercing the sky, shining seven thousand li qì, also placed within the vermilion smoke, the light mixing vermilion, purple, and white three qì shining distinctly. Store vermilion, purple, white three and five spreading and merging, reflecting clearly. After finishing, intone:

> Purple door blue chamber, two great gods, peaceful and calm law kings, upright heart and sharp square, holding flowing bells, body born of wind and clouds, chivalrous guarding the true Way, not listening to outside, causing me to think and feel, opening spiritual gates, entering and exiting smoothly, ascending nine gates, seeing nine truths, Supreme One’s honor.

Then calmly forget the body and lie down, close eyes and store spirit. After three months, the spirit qì descends, appearing in the disciple; the disciple should seek to fly immortal.

The method of storing truth and guarding unity: clothing and footwear must not be borrowed from others, nor share bed with others. When storing unity, one must ascend the calendar, always knowing where the heavenly dipper points.

On the eighth night of the first day of spring, sit facing east at midnight, hold breath nine breaths, swallow saliva thirty-five times, store the Northern Dipper’s seven stars descending slowly to the crown, the dipper star’s size arbitrary, faint and indistinct, the chief dipper covers the crown, ladle pointing forward, shining brilliantly. Then store the palace gods clearly and completely, only not seeing qì piercing the sky. Then intone the purple door blue chamber method. After a while, each of the three palaces’ one emperor god suddenly appears, entering my crown dipper; soon, each of the three palaces’ one official god also appears, entering the crown. The six gods in the chief dipper, in order, support each other in a flying formation, following the star order before me, moving to the front heavenly gate star, all turning toward my mouth. After a while, I exhale one breath, the two upper primal gods come with the breath into the mouth, returning to the mud pellet palace; I exhale another breath, the two middle primal gods come into the mouth, returning to the lower elixir field palace. After storing, intone:

> Five directions command dipper, gods summon seven stars, three honored condense and transform, ascending to summon purple spirit, six gods wandering, three officials’ cinnabar city, mysterious communication with Supreme Emperor, descending to the yellow peace below, heavenly truth guards, summoning and commanding six spirits, immortals all correspond, riding smoke of the three pure ones, four bodies solidly refined, five viscera self-generated.

Then calmly forget the body and lie down.

Beginning on the eighth night of spring. On the midnight of the first day of summer, sit facing south to store; on the first day of autumn midnight, sit facing west to store; on the first day of winter midnight, sit facing north to store.

The above three primals and four seasonal guard unity, each eight nights, storing and thinking methods all follow the spring storage method, only requiring focused mind and attention.

On the night of the spring equinox, sit facing east at midnight, hold breath nine breaths, swallow saliva thirty times, store the Northern Dipper’s bright star, with purple qì like a string, descending directly to irrigate my body. Then store as usual, then intone the purple door blue chamber method. Next, see the bridal chamber palace with self soul wearing color; next, see the mud pellet palace covering the dipper, the two gods under the dipper and the heart and navel two palaces, altogether six gods, plus the self soul covering the dipper, all faintly appearing before me. The three emperors in front, self soul in the center, three officials behind, altogether seven gods, all riding the mud pellet covering the dipper, each star corresponding to one god’s crown, pointing upward, from the Yangming descending purple qì, floating the dipper ascending to the heavenly bright star, faintly existing in the purple palace. The seven gods sit in order, each swallowing purple qì thirty times, the self soul also swallowing. After a while, the seven gods all ride the covering dipper, following the purple qì downward, faintly returning to their palaces. Clearly intone:

> Three honored Supreme True, Great Profound High Gods, Yangming governs spring, myriad children open gates, cinnabar origin governs summer, vermilion and purple merge smoke, yin essence governs autumn, heavenly might six arrays, North Pole governs winter, cutting evil and blocking treachery, five earths hold ren, Wu and Ji heavenly gates, all crushed and destroyed, none can resist, refining my seven spirits, harmonizing my three souls, generating my five viscera, enabling me to attain truth, ascend flying Supreme Clarity, floating radiance of seven origins, long life, careful departure, commanding a thousand gods.

Then calmly lie down and rest, storing and thinking thus.

On the summer solstice night at midnight, sit facing south, storing the cinnabar origin star purple qì descending into my body, storing the seven gods riding the dipper, ascending to the North Pole star.

The above four solar terms and earth king are the five dippers united as one, each eight nights storing and thinking. The method of thinking, invocation, and intonation all follow the spring equinox day, only requiring focused mind and attention.

On the day taking the upper branch sun, facing the moon at dawn, after storing as usual, the three palaces’ six gods suddenly appear before me; I bow thrice in the heart, intoning:

> Heavenly honored three emperors, guarding such life gate, roaming within spirit, six qì mysterious divisions, nourishing my five gods, correcting my three souls, five viscera self-generated, long life flying immortal.

After finishing, the spirit faintly returns to the three palaces, swallow saliva thirty times.

On the day taking the first day, at night looking up at the Northern Dipper’s assistant star, closing eyes, seeing the three palaces’ six gods emerge from the assistant star descending directly into my three palaces, then lying down storing and thinking, intoning:

> Supreme One heavenly rotation, five emperors’ roaming, three officials supporting and guarding, merging with truth, descending into my body, sitting peacefully, emitting essence irrigating form, harmonizing soul and spirit, enabling me to fly immortal, cloud carriage roaming.

After finishing, swallow saliva thirty-seven times.

On the day taking the first opening day, at midnight, facing east, loosening hair and combing, after combing tying it, intone:

> Upper primal three truths, truth in the middle infant, loosening hair opening smoke, ascending connecting heavenly platform, mud pellet firm condensed, simultaneous with heaven, enabling me to fly immortal, crossing and roaming the hollow platform.

After finishing, swallow saliva nineteen times, faintly lie down, storing three palaces’ six gods and bridal chamber self soul, each exhaling thirty times, filling the palace.

Every time before eating, one should close eyes, knock teeth three times fully connected, then store the three palaces’ six gods suddenly appearing. After eating and drinking, again store and return to the three palaces. Intone:

> Hundred grains enter stomach, merging with spirit and qi, qi fills blood and fluids, corpse and evil vanish and fall, flying to the Golden Palace, long life with heaven and earth, commanding six spirits, spiritual children attending and guarding.

Then eat.

Every time combing hair, one should face the king, after tying hair, knock teeth three times fully connected, intone:

> Mud pellet mysterious splendor, protecting essence long preserved, left is hidden moon, right is sun root, six harmonies refined, a hundred gods receiving grace.

After finishing, swallow saliva three times, then comb back and forth left and right several times, before and after dozens of times.

On several new moons, one should bathe, allowing several times to ride true qì. Commonly using eight taels of peach white bark and twenty taels of bamboo leaves.

Boil one hu and two dou of water, suitably warm or cold for bathing, not for washing hair. Perfected persons descending to the world, returning to heaven, also always use this for bathing.
