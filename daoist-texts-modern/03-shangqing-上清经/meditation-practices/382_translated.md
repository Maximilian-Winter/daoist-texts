## Scripture of the Primordial Truth of the Bright Hall of Shangqing

At the White Jade Tortoise Terrace, the Nine Numinous Supreme True Lord, the Queen Mother of the West, bestowed the teaching of the *Profound True Scripture of the Bright Hall*, saying:

“The Most High is profound beyond measure, the two energies illuminate the caverns, the profound truth shines within, the Bright Hall is pure without. Swallowing the breath of the two radiances, the spirit essence of long life is nourished. Above, it supplements the Director of Destinies, overseeing and commanding myriad spirits. The Six Blossoms overflow abundantly, thoroughly perceiving the Yellow Tranquility. These forty characters are the very root scripture of the Profound Truth. What follows is all the Queen Mother’s comprehensive and perfected elaboration on methods and conduct, just as in the scriptures of the Nine Truths, with the dragon as the principal symbol. These forty characters were engraved by the Most High upon the Phoenix Terrace’s southern pavilion. They are not taught to disciples outside the perfected lineage, nor transmitted except by the Director of Destinies’ chosen. The record named ‘Profound Supreme Register’ states: those who are to receive the life-giving Director of Destinies’ register must first practice this dao. Lord Yang serves as the divine Director of Wu and Yue, and as Chief Historian is to be enfeoffed with a cultivated estate; thus he too may receive it, not necessarily as a perfected disciple. This is likely a gathered exhortation to encourage the matter.”

### The Profound Truth Method

The Jade Maiden bears the titles of Supreme Profound and Upper Profound, and her name is Profound Truth—thus the name “Profound Truth,” meaning the inner radiance. Moreover, this is the highest method of true profundity; hence Dongqing says this path of true profundity is essential yet not burdensome. Preserve the sun and moon within the mouth: according to this, at first taking the Jade Maiden’s essence fluid, the sun and moon’s forms enter the mouth, the radiant mists pour in, and later return to the Bright Hall, allowing the intake through the mouth to ascend. If one does not preserve this Jade Maiden matter, one should use the later single practice formula, initially preserving the sun and moon as large as a ring within the mouth. Preserve the sun by day, the moon at midnight; one may also preserve without distinguishing day and night. One may also depict night and mutually preserve both. Generally, the way of sun and moon is not so; it does not divide into two methods of dusk and dawn. This says to preserve the sun by day, which means the whole day; to preserve the moon at midnight means the whole night—not literally noon or midnight. Hence the later formula says to depict preserving the sun and moon. If one only preserves once during day or night, one should use the time when sun and moon first appear, following the actual recorded events to preserve thereafter. If one wishes to preserve multiple times, three times each by day and night mark the divisions; during day face the sun, at night face the moon, sitting upright with eyes closed and hands joined. When the sky is overcast and one must lie down, face the direction where the moon is unseen. The sun’s color is red, the moon’s yellow; the sun has nine violet rays, the moon ten white rays. Let the sun and moon face the mouth at nine feet distance, rays directed toward the mouth, straight as strings, entering the mouth. At first, preserve the sun and moon in the heavens as the great shining lights now seen, descending slowly, their forms gradually shrinking, at nine feet from the mouth, perfectly round like pearls, bright and penetrating. The violet rays of nine beams are the nine violet rays. Each ray shines with color, all arranged as numbered, distributed around the edges of sun and moon, directed straight before me. Suppose preserving the sun: all rays on the sun’s east side and those above, below, south, and north bend inward, joining the west ray as a single east string entering my mouth, not scattered to left or right.

Within the sun and moon dwells a maiden, her head adorned with a purple kerchief, crimson embroidered cape and skirt. She calls herself the Supreme Profound, Upper Profound, Danxia Jade Maiden, named Entwined Whorl, styled Secret Truth. Upon preserving the sun and all rays, one further preserves seeing within the sun a maiden, respectfully sitting with hands joined, veiled about three feet, her form jade-beautiful, head wearing a purple lotus kerchief, crimson embroidered cape, vermilion flying skirt, green sash, facing my mouth, kneeling, saying:

“I am the Supreme Profound, Upper Profound, Danxia Jade Maiden, named Entwined Whorl, styled Secret Truth.”  
She opens her mouth to exhale red breath, filling the space between sun and moon’s rays, merging with the radiant mists, all entering my mouth.

According to the later blessing, “exiting sun entering moon” is the blessing for taking the moon, and it says the mouth exhales crimson breath. Now when taking the moon, preserving the Jade Maiden should also exhale red breath, merging with the rays and mists, all entering my mouth. The “rays and mists” here are the red light outside the crown rays, hence called Danxia Jade Maiden, though the moon’s rays also have it. I swallow it; the preserved maiden exhales accordingly. Practicing ninety swallows completes this; then one perceives the sun and moon’s images closely approaching my face. The maiden exhales once, I swallow once; the three kinds of breath first descend thirty swallows to the Palace of Life’s Gate, next thirty swallows descend to the Scarlet Official, last thirty swallows ascend to the Mud Pellet Palace, the light flowing through the four limbs, penetrating the five viscera. Thus the sun and moon’s forms gradually draw near; each swallow moves the light one inch. After ninety swallows, the light reaches the mouth’s edge, above to the nose tip, below to the chin, radiance bright and clear, distinctly warm. The Jade Maiden’s form also shrinks with the sun. She lets her mouth sip above mine, causing the vital fluids to descend and enter my mouth. The Jade Maiden always dwells within sun and moon, aligning head and mouth with mine, red breath and elixir flowing into my lips and teeth, not yet to be swallowed; only after the blessing’s end do I swallow again. I then softly recite:

“Great Firmament Purple Truth, Bright Hall’s Yin Spirit, sun and moon generate essence, Jade Maiden Entwined Whorl, first born from emptiness, styled Secret Truth, head wrapped in purple lotus, lotus spirit crown, body draped in embroidered cape, vermilion flying skirt, emerging from sun entering moon, heavenly light subtle and fragrant, mouth exhales crimson breath, irrigating my three origins, face speaks of the heavenly courtyard, gentle soul governs spirit, mysterious fluid flows, fetal essence grows complete, five viscera bloom virtues, opening youth reversing age, overseeing myriad spirits, Director of Destinies flying immortal.”

Within these eleven lines, when taking the sun, one should perhaps change the rhyme, saying “exiting moon entering sun.”

Afterwards, preserve the Jade Maiden’s mouth fluids, letting them pour into my mouth, just as before the flow pours endlessly; after blessing, again cause exhaling and swallowing. I rinse and swallow again, another ninety times. The exhaled fluid remains red; one exhale, one swallow, through the three palaces in order, as before. When finished, the Jade Maiden rises, each following sun and moon into the mouth, holding them long, then ascending back into the Bright Hall. At sun time, she dwells within the right Yellow Gate’s enclosure, concentrating thoughts here. When all is complete, quiet the mind and feel the effect; practice much, no limits remain. Thus day and night without hindrance, one may do this freely, no need to limit to three times. But since these bright counts are many, combined with other practices, thoughts may overlap. If preserving sun, do not preserve moon; if preserving moon, do not preserve sun—this is because one cannot preserve sun and moon simultaneously. One must balance their preservation. This means not to practice one method alone, but to equalize the counts of sun and moon preserved by day and night: by day preserve sun once, by night preserve moon once; by day preserve sun thrice, by night preserve moon thrice. If one cannot practice at the proper time, preserve the two images returning to the Bright Hall, sun on the left, moon on the right, letting sun and moon’s radiance merge with the pupils, mutually illuminating and flowing. This is for times not preserving or taking; one should think of sun and moon residing in the Bright Hall, the red and yellow images, violet and white rays connecting with the two pupils, shining through body and face, illuminating the nine palaces. When seated upright, always think thus. At this one time, sun and moon unite, no longer distinguishing day and night preservation. Hence, at times of practice, sun and moon cannot coexist. One may always preserve sun and moon in the Bright Hall, not waiting for the usual sun and moon images taken, but using both. This means not preserving the Jade Maiden’s sun and moon residence, but the Bright Hall itself always contains refined essence. Sit or lie, always think, as if seeing them. After five years’ practice, the Supreme Profound Jade Maiden will descend at the hour of the Rat, to rest and breathe with one. The Supreme Profound Jade Maiden can also divide her form into dozens of Jade Maidens, serving the commands of the Rat. This accumulates feeling and condenses essence, transforming into visible forms—the utmost essence, the wondrous response of feeling. The title “Supreme Profound” is the realm where sun and moon dwell; the Jade Maiden is also the daughter of the sun and moon’s consort. Their responsive forms may rest and feast together, not merely as paired counterparts. When sipping mouth fluids, if there is some heaviness in the chest, there will be no descent of the stranger. When inside and outside are even and smooth, the hairpin is firm; later dividing the body and scattering the rays, though they may be commanded, the true substance is hard to attach. The Primordial Perfected first studied the dao at Changshan, dreaming of the Supreme Profound Jade Maiden carrying a jade talisman and guiding him west to the city. This was the maiden; later he indeed received and practiced the Profound Truth, sincerely responding, deeply manifesting signs beforehand.

### The Most High True Official’s Way of the Sun’s Radiance

Drawing from the two images’ method, it enables one to penetrate numinous truth, embody jade radiance, command myriad spirits, and ascend to the imperial chambers. The Most High True Official refers to the various Directors of Destinies. In the past, the Perfected of Zhong Mountain taught the Way of Xia Yu, which is this Profound Truth method, but only in brief, without the Jade Maiden matter. According to the Sword Scripture’s preface, Xia Yu took the Lingbao and practiced the Nine Truths, and the Five Talismans record that the Perfected of Zhong Mountain taught Yu to take the sun, moon, and five stars’ methods, differing from this present teaching. The absence of the Jade Maiden matter indicates it is the later teaching from Dongqing, initially only a single method given to the two brothers. This transmission exhausts the principles of the Profound Truth; only the yin-yang two images’ inner true talisman remains in the Golden Book Scripture, not yet practiced in the world. Formerly, the Director of Destinies received the Profound Truth from the Queen Mother and the perfected formula, practicing for three years, with complexion like a maiden, sun radiating flowing light, face glowing with jade luster. Later, the Director of Destinies taught the second brother the method of preserving the scripture, with utmost sincerity and concentration. Within three years, divine light appeared, then the Jade Maiden matter was further received, thus securing the position of the fixed register and life protector.

### Dongqing Director of Destinies Says:

“My former master Lord Wang once saw the teaching of the *Most High Bright Hall Profound True Upper Scripture*, fasting and resting from food, preserving sun and moon in the mouth, by day preserving sun, by night preserving moon, making them as large as a ring. The sun is red with nine violet rays; the moon yellow with ten white rays. Preserve and swallow the light and fluid, practicing secretly countless times. If not practicing preservation, let sun and moon return to the Bright Hall on the face, sun on the left, moon on the right, letting the two images merge with the pupils, their energies communicating. This dao gathers and moves to generate essence, harmonizing soul and spirit, with the Six Ding serving, heavenly soldiers guarding. This is the supreme true dao. The Most High Profound True Scripture is first sworn to then practiced; after practice one may hear the jade pendants and golden earrings’ sounds. Ji Wei once fasted three years, with utmost sincerity and single thought, thus able to attain it. Then divine light shone upon the body, and only then did he receive the scripture. This path of Profound Truth is essential yet not burdensome. I always treasure this secret, keeping it close, thus showing it to you; be cautious and secretive. This is surely the method Xia Yu received. Now the Director of Destinies first imparts this simplified formula to Lord Yang, wishing the Chief Historian to practice it. At that time, the Chief Historian’s spirit pool was not clear, so the Jade Maiden matter was concealed, to be shown later in the transmission record, called the subsequent practice of Profound Truth. The Bright Hall Profound Truth has its own scripture, though brief, mostly mnemonic formulas, practiced accordingly. Wei Xi also lacked the scripture but practiced by this and then obtained the scripture.”

If you desire it, you may seek it from Wei; the jade pendant’s hidden writing was not seen by Wei. The scripture is as transmitted above. “If you desire it” means Lord Yang may seek the simplified version. The jade pendant and golden earrings are Dongqing’s secret, belonging to the same category as Profound Truth, all practicing the sun and moon’s way. Yet fearing Lord Yang might petition the two lords, it is thus nurtured here. At night or lying in darkness, if fearful in the heart, preserve sun and moon returning to the Bright Hall; in a moment, a hundred evils vanish. Always do so for best effect. This is the same as preserving when not practicing. In mountain solitude or hidden places, if feeling violated or tested, it is best to always preserve to repel them. This formula is separately given in the *True Decrees*, not in the above transmission. Since it is Profound Truth family business, it is taken along in transmission. Now those who can practice the Jade Maiden’s way no longer practice this; hence no further explanation is given.

### The Right Mao’s Transmission Formula

Originally four matters; now only one is taken.

## The Primordial Perfected’s Method of Serving the Immortals of the Four Extremities and Cloud Tusks

A female disciple, Wei Huacun, received the method from the Perfected of Clear Emptiness. The twelve-character original formula and annotation:

The Perfected embraces the five directions’ primordial morning radiance, consuming the nine mists’ essence, thus the divine light shines within, vermilion blossoms displayed without, the body born of jade radiance, form and qi bright. Practicing ten years, the Elder of the Four Extremities, Central Primordial Lord, descends, uniting at the hour of the Rat, riding clouds and dragons, ascending the white sun to Heaven. The Five Directions’ Elders refer to the spirits of the natural five directions, not worldly learning. The wonder of ten years, how swiftly it passes! Truly the marvelous way of emptiness and reality, the secret method of breathing and exhaling.

Long ago, the Primordial Perfected of Western Liangzi received the Most High formula, passed down five times over a thousand years, never to be rashly revealed. The Four Brightness ritual follows the secret book’s system: fasting five days before imparting, establishing a covenant with the five directions, pledging with solemn oath not to disclose. The five-day fast and five directions’ elders refer to living persons. Lord Wang once dwelled in Huayin, receiving the bright knowledge in one day; in the mountains and forests, it was a long fast, sincere and true. The Western Liang Perfected, having transmitted the method of the azure essence, also imparted this method, because its principles mutually support sun and moon, combining emptiness and reality. The five pairs correspond to the five directions, meaning conforming to the five directions’ usage. Sometimes the Perfected calls pairs “directions,” thus the formula clarifies it, the formula being five pairs of rings. Also using five taels of blue silk; this is the Western Liang Perfected’s method. This original annotation is the formula; the lady’s spoken words are Lord Wang’s. This original vermilion annotation was written by Lord Yang, orally transmitted.

### Facing East, Knock Teeth Nine Times, then the Yin Blessing:

“East’s azure tusk, purple clouds flowing mists, three whites wandering, mysterious frost jade gauze, consume morning radiance, drink the dawn’s splendor.”  
Three rhymes. After blessing, lick the upper lip’s outside with the tongue, take saliva and swallow thirty times. Each lick and swallow preserves blue fluid, sending it into the liver. Practice ten years, the East Extreme Elder arrives, bestows the son Azure Truth, uniting and ascending. Azure Truth is the scripture’s name.

---

### Next, Facing South, Knock Teeth Nine Times, then the Yin Blessing:

“South’s vermilion cinnabar, mists shining in the Supreme Subtle, nine paths of crimson smoke, spreading radiant brilliance, consume spiritual morning, drink the cinnabar pool.”  
Three rhymes. After blessing, lick the lower lip’s outside, take saliva and swallow thirty times. Preserve red fluid, sending it into the heart. Both these directions lick the outside of the chest fluid, hence the word “lick.” Practice ten years, the South Extreme Elder arrives complete, bestows the son Vermilion Radiance, uniting and ascending. Vermilion Radiance is the scripture’s name.

---

### Next, Facing West, Knock Teeth Nine Times, then the Yin Blessing:

“West’s bright stone, flying mists, golden fluid, consume the Supreme Bright, essence of pure spirit, drink jade nectar, divine brilliance awakens spirit, enabling me to ascend emptiness, rise to clear heights.”  
Four rhymes. Perhaps “divine” here means morning. After blessing, lick the inside of the upper lip, take saliva and swallow thirty times. Preserve white fluid, sending it into the lungs. Practice ten years, the West Extreme Elder arrives, bestows the son Pure Spirit Majestic God, uniting and ascending. Pure Spirit Majestic God is the name of six talismans.

---

### Next, Facing North, Knock Teeth Nine Times, then the Yin Blessing:

“North’s profound nourishment, auspicious clouds awaken the embryo, green mists spread morning, purple canopy and blue banner, consume moonlight, drink jade honey.”  
Three rhymes. After blessing, lick inside the lower lip, take saliva and swallow thirty times. Preserve black fluid, sending it into the two kidneys. Practice ten years, the North Extreme Elder arrives, bestows the son Profound Register Treasure Bright, uniting and ascending. Profound Register Treasure Bright is the scripture’s name.

---

### Next, Sit Facing South, Looking Up, Knock Teeth Nine Times, then the Yin Blessing:

“The origin of Wu and Ji, yellow essence of five clouds, four mists and purple views, eight radiances and nine mornings, two lights stirring brilliance, seven luminaries revered, harmonizing essence irrigates qi, consume the central origin, jade brilliance of dragon embryo, drink sweet spring.”  
Five rhymes. After blessing, rinse the mouth full, inside and outside chest, between teeth and tongue, all around, take saliva and swallow forty times. This is rinsing fully once then swallowing once. Preserve yellow fluid, sending it into the spleen. These forty characters originally were thirty in the true text; later added strokes, the brush marks still resembling true characters. This is the center encompassing the four directions, like the meaning of guarding the star gate’s peak. Practice ten years, the Central Primordial Lord, Supreme Yellow Elder Lord, descends, bestows the son Yellow Qi Yang Essence, hidden in Heaven’s secret moon escape register, chapter of blue essentials and tiger writings, all with the four elders uniting and ascending. This includes scriptures, talismans, and chapters of three compilations.

---

### This Jade Scripture’s Supreme Formula

Reaches the way of the Five Elders, cutting off grains and shedding corpses, face glowing youthful, unaffected by cold or heat, unharmed by calamities, spirit and immortal clarity, extending years and advancing cycles, increasing lifespan by ten thousand, at the limit of ten thousand cycles, one attains the Nine Jade Liquids and Eight Precious Flying Essences, thus uniting the two images, Heaven and Earth in accord. This chiefly speaks of the division of cloud tusks.

---

### The Five Yin Blessings

All should knock teeth nine times, practice constantly, no need to wait for cockcrow or dawn. At midnight, sitting quietly in a chamber, body clear and spirit calm, then proceed accordingly. Previously knocking teeth was only for the east; now it is clarified for all directions. The five sacred mountains are named “Bamboo Shoots,” also directions for breath closure. The family that guards unity, if hearing this dao, matters quickly succeed. Emptiness and lightness fill within, guarding the primordial swallowing fluid, called true unity. Those who seek much blessing, bring spirit with six fluids and five energies, qi naturally complete, thus said to seek blessings by oneself. Cultivating this dao, strictly avoid eating dried meat. If hungry, eat flour foods to gradually abandon grains; never abandon all at once. This is called “reduce and reduce” until reaching non-action. Those who can practice this fasting from grains are indeed virtuous in the azure essence, the highest dao of grain rejection. Yet utmost is quietness and simplicity, practicing for many years to gain benefit. If combined with miscellaneous tasks, fear the qi force cannot bear it, not matching food and hammering mutually, wrapping and increasing. Also consider the four bodies’ strength or weakness, old or young, not to finish a whole plate at once. Though the lady once received this method and praised it, she ultimately did not use it. It is a lofty and supreme undertaking, best to follow nearby traces. This path of emptiness and reflection is the way of nature, called “taking essence far from Heaven and Earth, near from the body.”

---

### Cloud Tusks

The essence qi of the Five Elders, the mists and smoke of the Great Ultimate, thus gathering the sharpness of radiance to fill the harmony of six fluids, penetrating dark feeling, myriad spirits descend, shadow and light seek each other, responding without singing. Hence the dragon roars in myriad abysses, clouds fall from the sky; the tiger roars on spiritual hills, wind rushes shaking all four directions; the sun’s fire summons brightness and vermilion flames rise; the square’s rare yin and mysterious flow overflow naturally, unnoticed by measurement. Moreover, the learner dwells heart and mind on mystery, deeply researching the root of the dao, clearing filth and accumulation in the chest, truly preserving the three palaces, gathering the five mornings’ scattered radiance, taking the six sweet mists’ rosy nectar, blessing the nine heavens’ wondrous treasures, uttering the mysterious secret words, dragons leap and emit radiance, bright light shines sevenfold, tasting the three blossoms on white teeth, taking full fluid at lip edge, refining the six bowels within, opening wisdom and clarity, breathing the heavenly origin, refining soul and spirit into form, morning mystery making no use, reaching spirit. Slowly over ten years, finally the five spirits descend. What need is there to praise more? Though a delicate woman, she completes the supreme practice, subtle sounds and silent echoes, not to be publicly proclaimed. Merely recounting its marvel to inspire like minds; if one’s virtue falls short, one should not blame or disparage it. Thus spoke the Lady of the Southern Peak.

### The Right Wang’s Transmission Formula

Its annotations are not urgent for practice and are mostly omitted here.
