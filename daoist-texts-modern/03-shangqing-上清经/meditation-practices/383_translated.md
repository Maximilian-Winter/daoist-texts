## The Supreme Clarity Cavernous Truth: Formula for Resolving Transgressions

### First: The Eight Seasonal Festivals Confession of Transgressions by the Pure Numinous Perfected Master Pei

The Pure Numinous Perfected Master Pei said: The Supreme Ultimate Perfected Master customarily, on the day of the Beginning of Spring at midday, would gather immortals in the Supreme Ultimate Palace, carving jade slips to record the names of immortals. At midnight that evening, facing true north, he would gaze up at the Northern Pole, bow twice with his forehead touching the ground, then solemnly declare the number and weight of his sins, petitioning for their resolution. Once his intent was fully expressed, he would bow twice more and then cease.

On the day of the Vernal Equinox, at midday, the Supreme Pure Perfected Master of Kunlun’s Jade Terrace, the Primordial Perfected Master, would convene the celestial officials to finalize the true scripture.

On the day of the Beginning of Summer, at midday, the Five Emperors of Supreme Clarity would assemble immortals in the Purple Tenuity Palace, meet the Four Perfected Masters, and discuss the merits and demerits of those seeking the dao.

On the day of the Summer Solstice, at midday, the Three Heavenly Officials would meet at the Offices of Fate and River Marquis, reviewing the sins and blessings of all people, adding years or subtracting reckoning.

On the day of the Beginning of Autumn, at midday, the Perfected Masters of the Five Sacred Mountains would journey to the Central Yellow Lord of the Yellow Chamber Cloud Court Mountain, convening celestial officials at noon to determine the divine charts and numinous medicines of the world.

On the day of the Autumnal Equinox, at midday, the Supreme August Emperor would ascend the Supreme Clarity Numinous Pavilion at the Taiwei Hall, gathering the Three Elder Lords, the Northern Pole Perfected Masters, the Great Gods of the Eight Seas, the Revered Spirits of the Five Sacred Mountains, and countless numinous immortal officials. Together, they would deliberate the sins and blessings of the myriad beings under Heaven, record the diligence or laxity in dao study, itemize each case, and entrust the Office of Fate.

On the day of the Beginning of Winter, at midday, the Yang Terrace Perfected Master would meet celestial officials and jade maidens to newly register those who have attained the dao and entered the immortal registers.

On the day of the Winter Solstice, at midday, the assembly of heavenly immortals would all journey to the Eastern Flower Supreme Palace, visit the Azure Youth Lord of the Eastern Sea, and engrave the names of immortals in golden books.

At each of these eight seasonal festivals, at midnight and midday, one confesses transgressions to the seven ancestral generations and parents, as well as one’s own sins, thus erasing the names of transgressions. Practiced long, immortals do not die.

On the days of the Autumnal and Vernal Equinoxes, the Most High Divine Perfected observe and deliberate among the myriad immortals; those not truly perfected should not lightly use these days to confess sins. The assembly of true immortal officials gathers at midday on each of the eight festivals, convening for three days before release. Those who wish to cultivate the dao must first fast and observe purity, not neglecting this.

Master Zizi Yuan received from Master Jiang the fifth formula: on the days of the eight festivals, one should meditate on the number and weight of sins committed since establishing oneself, sincerely confessing above, hoping the Heavenly Sovereign and all perfected ones will record and assist, enabling oneself to turn toward goodness and seek long life as a numinous immortal.

The festival of the Autumnal Equinox is when the qi dwells in pure emptiness, the day of great harmony. On this day, all perfected immortals hear lawsuits. The earthly officials and boundary spirits also gather, reporting the merits and demerits of local daoists, as well as the sins and fates of all people.

The *True Record of Immortal Taboos* says: “If one wishes to ascend to Heaven, be cautious at the Autumnal Equinox; all sins, great and small, are reported above. Seeking immortality through sin is most difficult. Thus, dao study requires a cold heart.” This is the essential teaching of Master Zhongyang of the Vermilion Fire Cinnabar Mound. The Autumnal Equinox’s qi harmonizes at midday, aligning with Heaven and Earth. The great fiery qi is crushed by the force of decay and decline; the mysterious water envelops the mouth, gestating in the palace of metal birth. The sun’s light turns toward lesser yang, nurturing Heaven and Earth. This fixes the boundary of firmness and softness, unites the sequence of the two images, illuminating flowing brightness, distinguishing yin and yang’s three lights. This is the marked day of the eight festivals, the essential ladder for seeking the dao.

At midday on this day, the Supreme August Emperor ascends the Supreme Clarity Numinous Residence on the Broad Cold Moon, the Purple Terrace of the Dan City, the Long Brocade Jade Tower. The assembly of perfected ones gathers at the Taiwei Hall, opening the gate of the Nine Heavens, inviting the True Sovereigns of the Nine Heavens, summoning the Most High Three Elder Lords, the Northern Pole perfected, the Great Gods of the Eight Seas, and commanding the Five Sacred Mountains’ immortals. The countless revered spirits convene in the Hall of Limitless Yang, jointly deliberating the sins and blessings of all under Heaven, recording the diligence or laxity of dao seekers, noting offenses by day and month, the merits and demerits of conduct, the states of life and death, each according to their jurisdiction and origin, itemized and entrusted to the Office of Fate, inscribed in the Imperial Records. The minutest sins and hidden evil, the subtle merits of secret virtue, all are carefully distinguished and known.

At midnight that evening, one must go out to the central courtyard, face true north, gaze up at the Northern Pole, remove the cap, bow twice, kneel long with the forehead touching the ground, and open to the Most High Northern Pole Heavenly Sovereign Great Emperor. Secretly confess to the seven ancestral generations and parents, and declare the number and weight of sins committed since establishing oneself. Beg for pardon and forgiveness, promising henceforth to abandon past faults and cultivate goodness. Speak truthfully, swear by the cinnabar heart, pledge before Heaven and Earth, and dare not commit evil deeds. The words must be sincere and heartfelt. Practiced long, immortals do not die.

When finished, one prays: “May the Most High August Emperor erase such-and-such sins, send the record to the Three Officials, so that my name may be inscribed on the jade slips of immortals, granting long life and enduring vision, penetrating truth and reaching numinosity.” Then one bows four times in all directions, bows twice more, and returns to the quiet chamber, deeply restraining oneself, remembering the three primordial spirits, and petitioning the Most High above. This is done three times; this is called entering the immortal registers, and the sins and faults are erased.

The Three Primordials are the three spirits of the Mud Pellet, the Crimson Palace, and the Cinnabar Field. To remember the Three Primordials and Three Spirits, petition the Heavenly Sovereign above, beseeching grace and pardon, assisting what one has declared, so that it must be heard above. Three petitions at the Autumnal Equinox fix the record of birth and erase the record of death. This method comes from the scripture of the Azure Chart, a secret method of long life.

Though common people love the dao, they have not yet left the human world, which is full of sins and faults. Those who commit them are not few, so it may not be suitable to apply the Autumnal Equinox first confession method lightly. One must enter the mountains and forests, distance from human affairs, live in solitude, not harm any beings, then one may do it.

Having sworn to reverse evil and change conduct, having spoken words already heard by the Most High, one must be careful not to commit evil or violate life again. If one commits ten times the same great crime, Heaven and Earth will not pardon; death will be the proof, and no further amendment is possible. To seek the dao by this means, nothing more is required.

Nourishing life is like the meeting of water and fire; if one obtains its benefit, one ascends to Heaven in broad daylight; if one violates the precepts and laws, one’s body perishes in the Three Springs. This day is especially important among the eight festivals, called by Zhao Boxuan the gate of life and death.

The *Three Nine Plain Words* say: “On the day of the Autumnal Judgment, all ranks gather; it is the day of life and death.” The ancients took the Autumnal Equinox as the day of the Autumnal Judgment. Because on this day, the Supreme Emperor of the Nine Heavens and Eight Earths, the myriad true immortals, and the Supreme August Sovereign all gather for three days and three nights to decide the fate of all under Heaven. The matters discussed are many, and the divine lords all assemble.

On the eight festival days, the true officials of Heaven and Earth meet in turn, each festival lasting three days and three nights, then returning to their offices. This is Master Zizi’s formula, a separate matter not mixed with the regulations of the other seven festivals.

The *Night Watch Divine Youth’s Golden Root Scripture* says: On the days of the eight festivals, the ultimate assembly of immortals and the mandates of myriad true beings all convene. One day before the festival, myriad spirits come to the palace; at midday on the festival day, ranks enter to pay respects; one day after the festival, sins and blessings are distinguished; after three days and three nights, the heavenly affairs conclude. You must be cautious of sin, strive for merit and virtue, so your name may ascend to the True Ones and be recorded in the Supreme Ultimate. I do not speak falsely; those who know are deeply secretive. Hurry to confess transgressions, keep it secret and carefully guard it. This too was told by Master Zizi, passed down to instruct Master Pei.

### Second: Master Xu’s Formula for Confession of Transgressions on the Eight Festival Days

Master Xu’s formula says: Always after midnight on the eight festival days, sit calmly facing true north, preserve form and envision the image, as if seeing a portentous body. Then, crossing both hands atop the head, knock the ground nine times with the knuckles; the sins and faults are thus removed, and form and image are separated.

---

### Third: Master Xu’s Five Passages Day Confession for Ancestral Sins

Always on the Five Passages Days, face north to confess and request pardon for the three, five, and ancestral generations’ transgressions; thus the ancestral sins are resolved. The Five Passages Days are the tenth month’s dawn and the second month’s first day. Without resolving ancestral burdens, one’s path to immortality grows distant.

---

### Fourth: Master Xu’s Five Attainments Day Confession for Ancestral and Personal Sins

On the Five Attainments Days, face north and bow five times, calling the names of the Supreme August Sovereign and his consort thrice:

“Jupiter True Sovereign, Yu Can Yu Can Yu Can,  
Consort Feiyun Feiyun Feiyun.

Mars True Sovereign, Weiting Weiting Weiting,  
Consort Huaping Huaping Huaping.

Saturn True Sovereign, Tanyan Tanyan Tanyan,  
Consort Feixian Feixian Feixian.

Venus True Sovereign, Debiao Debiao Debiao,  
Consort Ling’en Ling’en Ling’en.

Mercury True Sovereign, Jingyuan Jingyuan Jingyuan,  
Consort Long’e Long’e Long’e.”

The right five sovereign consorts’ names are secret, not recorded in earlier texts; this is the separate formula for the Manifest Spirit Consorts.

Then, knocking teeth five times to conclude, removing the cap, kneeling long, one respectfully petitions the Five Stars, the sun and moon, the Supreme August Sovereign, the High Dao Lords, the Dao Lord Consorts, the Jade Pure Most High Supreme Clarity Supreme August Emperor, and the Great Dao Sage Lords, declaring the seven ancestral generations and parents below, down to oneself, beseeching liberation from thousands of sins and myriad faults since former lives, so that the Three Officials may report to the Heavenly Emperor, causing the names of sins to be removed and erased from the cinnabar slips. Beg to join the true Five Stars, to hasten to the Splendid Morning, ascend Supreme Clarity, and enter the Jade Palace.

The auspicious dates of the Five Attainments are:

- First month, sixth day, midday  
- Second month, first day, feeding time  
- Third month, seventh day, midnight  
- Fourth month, ninth day, meal time  
- Fifth month, fifteenth day, midnight  
- Sixth month, third day, midday  
- Seventh month, seventh day, midnight  
- Eighth month, fourth day, midday  
- Ninth month, second day, dawn  
- Tenth month, first day, dawn  
- Eleventh month, sixth day, midnight  
- Twelfth month, twelfth day, midnight

These are the auspicious Five Attainments days.

The Most High conceals the Five Passages Days sealed in the Jade Bamboo of the Five Sacred Mountains, hiding the Way of Returning to the Origin, concealed in the Palace of Nine Mornings. Having cultivated the Five Passages, one should practice Returning to the Origin. The Five Passages open at the beginning of the Emperor; Returning to the Origin opens at the mysterious end. Therefore, those who cultivate the Five Passages and follow the Seven Primordials’ Returning Way neither eat blood or meat nor see corpses or filth; violators suffer the Most Mysterious Trial.

The Five Passages are the auspicious assembly days of the Most High; Returning to the Origin is the Most High’s day of renewal. Without knowledge of the Five Passages, one cannot resolve sins and remove faults; without knowledge of Returning to the Origin’s hidden Way, one cannot inscribe one’s name among the true perfected. Always on these days, think on auspicious matters, first confessing the sins in one’s body, thus resolving and escaping seven generations, freeing oneself from penal names. This is not shown to immortals within the Nine Palaces.

### Fifth: The Taiyi’s First Confession and Removal of Sins at Midnight and Midday

Taiyi said: If a being has sins and faults and wishes to first confess and seek removal, at midnight and midday, enter a room, close the door, sit upright facing north, envision the Emperor Lord residing in the Purple Chamber of the being’s body, envision the being’s form also in the Purple Chamber, prostrate before the Emperor Lord, internally confessing faults, holding breath for a long time until the entire body sweats, clothing damp with steam. Do this three times; the sins dissipate.

When sweat covers the body, then recite:

“I, [Name], have sins; all hundred spirits above hear.  
I beg to cross the seven nines, the calamities of water and fire.  
Guarding fate, Taiyi, I beseech the Emperor Lord.  
Sweat flows over the body, fear dwells in the three souls.  
By the grace of the Most High, forever remove afflictions.”

Then call the Emperor Lord’s name thrice. The Emperor Lord’s true name is Lingfan, styled Lichangling, also called Seven Spirits, also Divine Elder. He always governs the Supreme Ultimate Purple Chamber, sitting upright and serene, his visage like that of an infant. Purple qi always envelops his divine form; he wears five-colored splendid robes and a crown of sun and moon. Above his left ear is a sun nine inches in diameter; above his right ear a moon one foot in diameter. After the visualization, open the eyes.

This is called the Emperor Lord’s Way of Resolving Transgressions, internally thanking the Five Spirits. The sweating is the response.

Common folk confess by bowing and striking cheeks — this is another method. But those who cultivate the Three Ones and guard the Cavernous Chamber, serving the Emperor Lord and Taiyi, must not bow and strike cheeks. Bowing startles the three souls, disturbs the Mud Pellet, agitates the Purple Chamber, and troubles the Emperor Lord. Striking cheeks hardens the membrane and binds the sinews of the eastern soul; Taiyi grieves, the Five Spirits relocate — this is a great taboo. If one’s thoughts and actions only include bowing and striking cheeks, the inner resolution is also achieved in the heart. Immortals only bow in mind, not bending the body; this is proper.

### Sixth: Master Liu’s Confession of Family Sins on the Chen and Si Five Virtues Days

Master Liu recorded: Many have sins and faults; Heaven’s net is loose but does not let anything slip. The net of the netherworld steals one’s fate, causing short life. Though the path of life is within the body, without confessing transgressions, many illnesses and worries arise. This text comes from *Taiwei Wenchang’s Inner Chart*, chapter twenty-three.

If a family suffers decline and exhaustion, or undertakings fail, or descendants do not flourish, or officials do not advance, or livestock die, or calamities strike suddenly, it all arises from many transgressions. Those who can wash away filth and purify the heart, who do not indulge or envy, do not act unrighteously, are compassionate and kind, share others’ worries and joys as their own, do not slander or sow discord, give alms to relieve suffering, will lengthen life and always obtain their wishes.

On the Chen and Si days at dusk, cleanse the place of Heavenly Virtue — the lands of Jia, Geng, Bing, Xin, Ren — burn incense, the whole family faces north, remove caps, bow dozens of times, speak no words, only in the heart say: “May the sins and faults of the whole family be resolved.” Thus one gains peace and long life. If sins are not stopped, no matter how many confessions, it is of no use. If no sins arise, and one often cultivates this confession method, one will forever be free of worries.

The Chen and Si days are:  
Jia Chen, Bing Chen, Wu Chen, Geng Chen, Ren Chen,  
Ji Si, Xin Si, Gui Si, Yi Si, Ding Si.

These are the Five Virtues Days.

### Seventh: The Most High’s Returning to the Origin Hidden Way for Removing Sin Records and the Five Passages Day Confession

The Most High Jade True Hidden Origin Inner Observation uses the Six Ding days. At this time, the Heavenly Origin unfolds and arranges; the membranes bind firmly; the seven souls report above; the three souls record faults; the seven ancestral generations accumulate penalties in the three yin realms. Therefore, there is a method of elimination to resolve and free from afflictions.

Those who apply this Way are great seekers of immortality. They contemplate the Seven Primordials, preserve the Way of Nine Mornings, do not share bedding or clothing with others. Men and women sleeping together are recorded in the Black Profound Register of the North and suffer hellish punishment. Masters and disciples mixing are also offenses. The Five Passages are the Most High’s auspicious assembly days; Returning to the Origin is the Most High’s day of renewal. Without knowledge of the Five Passages, one cannot resolve sins and remove faults. Without knowing the Returning to the Origin hidden Way, one cannot inscribe one’s name among the true perfected.

Always on these days, think on auspicious matters, first confessing the sins in one’s body, thus resolving and escaping seven generations, freeing oneself from penal names. This is not shown to immortals within the Nine Palaces.

The Most High seals the Five Passages Days in the Jade Bamboo of the Five Sacred Mountains, hiding the Way of Returning to the Origin in the Palace of Nine Mornings. Having cultivated the Five Passages, one should practice Returning to the Origin. The Five Passages open at the beginning of the Emperor; Returning to the Origin opens at the mysterious end. Therefore, those who cultivate the Five Passages and follow the Seven Primordials’ Returning Way neither eat blood or meat nor see corpses or filth; violators suffer the Most Mysterious Trial.

Those who cultivate the Cavernous and Purple Chambers, and preserve the Nine Mornings and Seven Primordials, upon waking, at first divination, before and after meals, first offer a subtle blessing:

“Five Emperors, Five Passages,  
Six Harmonies, Purple Chamber,  
Returning to the Origin, Hidden Way,  
Unfold the Seven True Ones.  
The father who births the living soul is the Mysterious Father,  
The father transforms one into a divine being.  
The mother who births the corporeal soul is the Mysterious Mother,  
The mother transforms two into the living body.  
The one who governs my sinews and bones is the Lord,  
The one who nourishes my essence and qi is the White Origin.  
Long life and enduring vision,  
Flying immortals of the Ten Heavens.”

Finished, do not let the ears hear the blessing’s sound. This is the Most High hidden blessing, to remove evil qi, summon spirit, and cause one never to tire of darkness in life.

### Eighth: The Six Jia Cycle’s Six Ding Days at Midnight for the Seven Generations’ Parents’ Resolution of Trials

Always in the cycle of Jiazi, on the Dingmao day, at midnight, sit calmly on the bed facing north, join hands, knock teeth seven times, then gaze upon the Seven Stars, illuminating the north for a long time, then softly bless:

“First, the Great Star, Mysterious Pivot, Yang Bright Heaven Pivot, Soul Spirit Supreme Nine Lords.”

Call their names seven times, then bless:

“May the sins and faults from the seventh ancestral generation down to my present body, all be removed. May my wishes be fulfilled, all matters accordant. May I swiftly fly among the Seven Primordials, with Heaven in accord. May my name be inscribed in the Dipper’s Morning Register, extending my record by billions and thousands.”

Then envision the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper descending from Heaven, flying into my mouth, directly into my heart. Preserve the light of mind, illuminating inside and out, deeply contemplating. Then face north, bow twice, swallow saliva nine times, then rise from bowing. This is called resolving the morning knot and internal reflection on the Supreme Way.

In the Jiaxu cycle, on the Dingchou day, at midnight, sit calmly on the bed facing north, join hands, knock teeth seven times, gaze upon the Seven Stars, illuminating the north for a long time, then softly bless:

“Second, the Original Star, Northern Platform, Yin Essence, Heaven’s Grant, Soul Spirit Supreme King Nine Lords.”

Call their names seven times, then bless:

“May the sins and faults from the seventh ancestral generation down to my present body, all be removed. May the six qi be full, the four spirits united. May I fly among the Seven Primordials, my name inscribed in the Jade Register, ascending the Purple Clarity, riding the mysterious chariot, entering and exiting with auspiciousness, in accord with Heaven.”

Then envision the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper descending from Heaven, flying into my mouth, directly into my spleen, illuminating inside and out, the five organs distinct. When the star enters the mouth, let the eyes perceive light scattering, the mouth feel a slight warmth—this is the proof of the star essence’s entry. Then face north, bow twice, swallow saliva nine times, then rise from bowing.

In the Jiashen cycle, on the Dinghai day, at midnight, sit calmly on the bed facing north, join hands, knock teeth seven times, gaze upon the Seven Stars, illuminating the north for a long time, then softly bless:

“Third, the True Star, Nine Extremes, Supreme True Original Lady, Heavenly Mechanism, Corporeal Essence, Supreme Pure Nine Lords.”

Call their names seven times, then bless:

“May the sins and faults from the seventh ancestral generation down to my present body, all be removed. May hidden evil and accumulated private sins, violations of Heaven, Earth, Water, and the Three Officials, all be erased. May my eyes be clear and discerning, my vision penetrating the hidden. May I fly among the Seven Primordials, my name inscribed in Supreme Clarity, commanding myriad spirits, ascending the Jade Court, riding the light, traversing the void, in accord with Heaven.”

Then envision the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper descending from Heaven, flying into my mouth, directly into my liver, illuminating the five organs, inside and out. Then face north, bow twice, swallow saliva nine times, then rise from bowing.

In the Jiawu cycle, on the Dingyou day, at midnight, sit calmly on the bed facing north, join hands, knock teeth seven times, gaze upon the Seven Stars, illuminating the north for a long time, then softly bless:

“Fourth, the Link Star, Rotating Root, Mysterious Darkness, Heaven’s Push, Corporeal Essence, Supreme Void Nine Lords.”

Call their names seven times, then bless:

“May the sins and faults from the seventh ancestral generation down to my present body, all be removed. May all ungratefulness and lack of virtue, unkindness and unfiliality, dark evil sins numbering in the millions, all be destroyed. May I take in essence through food and drink, daily increasing merit, flying among the Seven Primordials, recorded in the Supreme Mystery, listed under the Jade Emperor, riding the swift Nine Heavens, commanding spirits and guiding souls, renewing sun and moon.”

Then envision the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper descending from Heaven, flying into my mouth, directly into my spleen, illuminating and penetrating, reflecting on the five organs. Then face north, bow twice, swallow saliva nine times, then rise from bowing.

In the Jiachen cycle, on the Dingwei day, at midnight, sit calmly on the bed facing north, join hands, knock teeth seven times, gaze upon the Seven Stars, illuminating the north for a long time, then softly bless:

“Fifth, the Main Star, Heavenly Balance, Cinnabar Origin, Jade Scale, Corporeal Spirit, Supreme Lord, Supreme Origin Nine Lords.”

Call their names seven times, then bless:

“May the sins and faults from the seventh ancestral generation down to my present body, all be removed. May all internal and external filth and sins, hidden and manifest, numbering in the billions, recorded in the dark gates, all be erased. May my body be full of qi, the Yellow Court stabilize the stomach, the upper, middle, and lower stamped, the Great Element hanging its light, marking my name in the Purple Palace, with jade maidens on the right and jade youths on the left, sun and moon shining together, my position as true king.”

Then envision the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper descending from Heaven, flying into my mouth, directly into my stomach, illuminating and penetrating, the five organs distinct. Then face north, bow twice, swallow saliva nine times, then rise from bowing.

In the Jiayin cycle, on the Dingsi day, at midnight, sit calmly on the bed facing north, join hands, knock teeth seven times, gaze upon the Seven Stars, illuminating the north for a long time, then softly bless:

“Sixth, the Chronicle Star, Life Mechanism, Northern Pole, Kaiyang Corporeal Spirit, Supreme Dan Void Emperor Nine Lords.”

Call their names seven times, then bless:

“May the sins and faults from the seventh ancestral generation down to my present body, all be removed. May all crimes and evil deeds, treacheries, rebellions, and delusions recorded in the imperial palaces, all be destroyed. May all illnesses be cured, body and qi be auspicious and pure, my name inscribed in the immortal terrace, engraved in the Golden Supreme Clarity, commanding myriad spirits, flying among the Nine Lights.”

Then envision the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper descending from Heaven, flying into my mouth, directly into my kidneys, illuminating and penetrating, the five organs distinct. Then face north, bow twice, swallow saliva nine times, then rise from bowing.

The yang day star enters the left kidney; the yin day star enters the right kidney. Odd-numbered days are yang; even-numbered days are yin. This Way especially forbids seeing blood, filth, foulness, or arrogance, or eating mixed, meat, or spicy foods; violators cause harm to seven ancestors above and disaster below, dying as low ghosts, names removed from the imperial gates.

On the evening of the month’s last day, the next day being the new moon, before the rooster crows, on the bed in the sleeping chamber, facing east, join hands, knock teeth seven times, then gaze upon the Seven Stars of the North, illuminating my left side for a long time, then softly bless:

“Seventh, the Pass Star, Mysterious Yang, Heavenly Pass, Shaking Light, Great Brightness, Most High Jade Emperor Dao Lord.”

Call their names seven times, then bless:

“May the sins and faults from the seventh ancestral generation down to my present body, all be removed. May all hidden darkness and secret sins, crimes of the five punishments, numbering in the millions, recorded in the Northern Emperor’s ghost officials, all be destroyed. May my spirit and essence be fully open and reach all directions, sitting and standing among the departed, ears sharp to silence, eyes emitting purple light, inscribed in the Jade Great Element, discerning ghostly forms, named in the Emperor Lord’s records, balanced in the two lights, flying among the Seven Primordials, resting and feasting in the Purple Court.”

Then envision the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper descending from Heaven, flying into my pupils, illuminating both eyes, causing inner and outer self-reflection, perceiving the five organs clearly. On yang days, the star enters the left pupil; on yin days, the right pupil. Then face north, bow twice, swallow saliva nine times, then rise from bowing.

On the Jiazi day at midnight, in the sleeping chamber, lying or sitting with the head facing any direction, hold firmly and close breath, calm the spirit for a long time, knock teeth nine times, then envision the Nine Stars of the Northern Dipper illuminating the crown of the head. The nine stars’ radiance reflects and shines upon this place, then softly bless:

“Eighth, the Emperor Star, Most High Jade Emperor, Divine Eight Light Primordial Lord, Ninth Supreme Star, Taiwei Jade Emperor Lord, Tai Su Seven Mornings Primordial Lord.”

Call their names nine times, then bless:

“May the sins and faults from the ninth ancestral generation down to my present body, all be removed. May all hills, rivers, sources, great and small sins and faults, hidden evil, treacheries, concealments, and deceptions, numbering in the billions, recorded on the ghostly mountain Fengshan, death penalty violations, recorded by the Northern Nine Primordials Supreme Ultimate Perfected, beseech the Nine Primordial Most High Emperor Jade Mysterious Lord to erase all matters, fly among the Seven Paths, ascend Jade Purity, roam the Great Void, ride the morning light, dwell in the northern eight elements, in accord with the sun. Always facing the Imperial Consort, governing myriad spirits.”

Then envision the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper descending from Heaven, flying into my Mud Pellet Purple Chamber, illuminating the Mud Pellet and brightening the whole body and five organs, causing inner and outer to emit purple light and cloud qi, making it lush and flourishing. Deeply contemplate. Then face north, bow twice, swallow saliva twenty-seven times.

If the Jiazi day is close to the month’s last day or the Six Ding days, the meditations are similar and may be adjusted in sequence, not necessarily frequent or close together. Each matter should be done thus, ensuring completeness in the true method.

Thus concludes the Most High’s Returning to the Origin Way of Confessing Sins.

# The Supreme Clarity Cavernous Truth: Formula for Resolving Transgressions
