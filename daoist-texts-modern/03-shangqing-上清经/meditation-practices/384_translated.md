## Scripture of the Primordial Truth of the Most High: The Eight Paths of the Destiny Register, Scroll One

### Formula for the Absolution of Sins

The Eight Paths of the Destiny Register, also called the Eight Intervals, or the Eight Passages, and alternatively the Eightfold Method for Untying, Resolving, and Apologizing for Sins to Extend Blessings—this wondrous scripture was received by the Three Primordial Lords of the Great Simplicity from the chapters of Nature itself. It was sealed within the Most High Numinous Capital’s Purple Chamber, guarded by three hundred attendants adorned with golden seals and jade blossoms, overseeing incense rites. The Eastern Sea’s Little Youth, the Four Extremities’ Perfected Ones, and the Western City’s King Lord were sealed within the western chamber of Mount Emei’s enchanting mountain. Passed down once every myriad kalpas, bearing the mysterious imperial name of the Purple Script of the Emperor’s Register, it is entrusted to the Jade Treasury of the Azure Palace. Within a thousand years, it may be heard thrice. Students of the highest learning who lack this text wander in vain through mountains and forests, never attaining the Dao.

The so-called Eight Paths correspond to the sun, moon, four seasons, and eight seasonal festivals. The sun travels the red equator; the moon travels the yellow path—these two paths, red and yellow, are the constant courses of yin and yang. At the Beginning of Spring and the Spring Equinox, the moon travels twice along the green path, emerging from the eastern yellow path. At the Beginning of Summer and the Summer Solstice, the moon travels twice along the red path, emerging from the southern yellow path. At the Beginning of Autumn and the Autumn Equinox, the moon travels twice along the white path, emerging from the western yellow path. At the Beginning of Winter and the Winter Solstice, the moon travels twice along the black path, emerging from the northern yellow path. These are the Eight Paths.

On the days when the moon travels these eight paths, transformations occur: fluttering and writhing, the flow of qi contained within, plants and trees rise and sink, responding to conditions and mutual influence, changing the old to the new, the light becoming heavy, the heavy becoming light, good and evil exchanging places—the movement of qi and its images unfolds naturally and spontaneously. The perfected ones of the highest learning, following these transformations, practice auspiciousness to remove misfortune, advance the good and expel the evil, clarify abandonment of darkness, enter righteousness to govern wickedness, refine falsehood into truth, and sharpen the foolish into sages. Their methods are profound and wondrous; this path is mysteriously thorough, hence called the Eightfold Passage, infinitely reaching the utmost.

### The First Path of the Destiny Register

On the clear morning of the Beginning of Spring, looking northward, one sees purple, green, and white clouds—these are the Three Primordial Clouds of the Three Primordial Lords of the Great Simplicity. Upon seeing them, one must kneel and press the forehead to the ground nine times, rub the cheeks nine times, with four heartfelt bows, then a deep bow. Secretly recite the incantation:

*"Great-grandchild’s name, today I am fortunate to encounter the Three Primordial Lords on their journey. I wish for longevity, to serve at the wheel’s hub. Whatever I say follows my will. For illness, I beg relief; for calamity, I beg deliverance; for disaster, I beg dissolution; for matters, I beg fulfillment."*

Upon thrice seeing the cloud chariot, the white sun ascends to immortality—no need to harbor other thoughts for hundreds or thousands of days. The practice is to perform this rite; one will surely have a record in the immortal registers. Therefore it is called the Eight Paths of the Destiny Register.

---

### The Second Path of the Destiny Register

At midnight of the Spring Equinox, looking northeast, one sees dark blue, green, and yellow clouds—these are the Three Primordial Clouds of the Heavenly Emperor of the Supreme Subtlety. Maintain reverence and recite the secret incantation as above.

---

### The Third Path of the Destiny Register

At dawn of the Beginning of Summer, looking northwest, one sees purple, blue, and yellow clouds—these are the Three Primordial Clouds of the Supreme True Lord of the Great Ultimate, the Three Primordial Inner Palace Perfected Ones. Maintain reverence and recite the secret incantation as above.

---

### The Fourth Path of the Destiny Register

At dawn of the Summer Solstice, looking southeast, one sees red, white, and blue clouds—these are the Three Primordial Clouds of the Emperor of Fusang. Maintain reverence and recite the secret incantation as above.

---

### The Fifth Path of the Destiny Register

At dawn of the Beginning of Autumn, looking due west, one sees white, red, and purple clouds—these are the Three Primordial Clouds of the Great True Perfected Lord of the Great Simplicity, the Heavenly Sovereign White Emperor. Maintain reverence and recite the secret incantation as above.

---

### The Sixth Path of the Destiny Register

At dawn of the Autumn Equinox, looking south, one sees white, red, and yellow clouds—these are the Three Primordial Clouds of the Supreme Perfected Lord of the Southern Pole, the Sovereign Red Emperor. Maintain reverence and recite the secret incantation as above.

---

### The Seventh Path of the Destiny Register

At dawn of the Beginning of Winter, looking southwest, one sees green, purple, and blue clouds—these are the Three Primordial Clouds of the Supreme Pure Perfected Lord, the Sovereign Emperor Ancestor. Maintain reverence and recite the secret incantation as above.

---

### The Eighth Path of the Destiny Register

At dawn of the Winter Solstice, looking due east, one sees vermilion, jade, and yellow clouds—these are the Three Primordial Clouds of the Jade Consort of the Great Void, the Supreme Perfected Lord of the Great Firmament. Maintain reverence and recite the secret incantation as above.

---

On these eight days, one bathes and burns incense before the sun reaches its zenith by one or two hours, then goes out to observe for about a quarter of an hour, then returns indoors. Do not observe on rainy or overcast days. If one unexpectedly sees these clouds on other days, perform the rites and incantations as above; the efficacy is thrice greater than on the appointed days.

---

If the sins of past and present lives remain unresolved, apologies are empty and ineffective, forgiveness is delayed, merit is hard to advance, demons test unknowingly, causing decline and premature aging, making ascent difficult, and once departed, the long journey into the nether is endless. Students of the highest learning, awaken to this startling truth, vow to admire and revere, deeply moved and spiritually penetrated, able to obtain the destiny register, decisively sever the root of sin, untie the knots of evil, nurture the source of goodness, dare to repel all evil, swiftly attain the true, meditate earnestly and cultivate secretly—then there will be proof.

---

For all absolutions of sin, one must first prepare a fast, strictly observing the eight appointed days, with body and mind pure and solemn. Those not of like mind must not rashly participate in the Great Dao. The holy perfected immortals, male and female, regularly gather in the Numinous Capital, maintaining long fasts and pure assemblies, directing heart and form to transform myriad beings, circulating the path to aid all living creatures. Living beings are never without need; transformations never cease; responses are never absent; there is always a master of responses. The Jade Capital’s terrace is the constant place of response.

Life is never without death; death is never without life. Birth and death are boundless and endless. Heaven and earth are countless; lands are infinite. Life and death alternate ceaselessly; arising and ceasing interrelate; being and non-being mutually complete. Life is called existence; death is called non-existence. Nothing is truly nothing; something is not always something. Constant response is always present; existence remains undying; wisdom is infinite.

Those of highest learning gather and return together, ascending by steps, entering by qi, recording spirit and qi, practicing methods to ascend the steps—this is called fasting. Fasting means alignment. Wash the heart and cleanse the body; body and mind correspond; inside and outside harmonize. With reverence, order, and strictness, from beginning to end, without unevenness, without laziness or slackening, without carelessness or arrogance, quietly and deeply embracing the Dao—thus it is called fasting.

There are many fasting methods, too numerous to record fully. The holy perfected transmit orally, teaching from mouth to mouth. The scriptures contain rites; here only a brief outline is given for careful selection and use, depending on the person. To study without fasting is futile and fruitless, like firewood without fire, like fire without a torch, like ascending to heaven without a cloud ladder, like flying without starry qi. Even with great effort, how could one fulfill the heart’s desire? The heart’s fulfillment must come through fasting; fasting and stillness must precede apology; without washing away faults, blessings will not come; without blessings, calamities will surely arrive; calamities cannot be averted without cause; no cause, no attainment of immortality or sainthood.

The holy immortals fast long and think deeply, resolving and apologizing for many offenses, cutting off misfortune and accepting good fortune, accumulating blessings and great virtue. When virtue fills and enters the Dao, one harmonizes with the spirits and enjoys eternal joy without suffering. Those with intent to reach this must cast aside worldly dust, vow to maintain pure fasting, and use the Three Primordial methods. The method centers on guarding unity; unity makes stillness its home; the home is in the human heart, where harmony and smoothness are fitting and beautiful, and highly valued by people.

To practice this and propagate it is most difficult, because past and present sins are tangled and bound, demons interfere, causing obstacles not easily overcome. Urgently one must cultivate fasting, at three and six times daily, with great and small repentance and vows, carefully exploring the supreme words and meanings. After completing the fasting rites, one must give alms to rescue the distressed and support the endangered, secretly establish yin merit, transform the heart and change conduct, diligently build yang virtue, avoid known faults, recognize faults and not repeat them; if repeated, apologize again. After three apologies, disasters dissipate and blessings arrive. If still unfulfilled, refine diligently without slackening; when the wish is fulfilled and the Dao attained, rest may be had.

After three offenses, no more apologies are allowed; apologies not forgiven—each must be cautious.

---

Before receiving the method, there are first disasters and calamities; after receiving the method, there are second disasters and calamities; since birth, there are third disasters and calamities. These three categories have many types and degrees, too numerous to record fully—here only a rough outline is given, with similar cases appended.

Past and present lives, former and current bodies, though near or far, have the same sin categories, following the source for explanation, relying on merit to complete virtue. Born to wealth or poverty, Daoist or secular, at ease in coming and going, accompanied by auspicious joy. Some serve as officials, some trade, some farm and tend silkworms, some fish and hunt. Though mundane occupations, they neither indulge nor steal, neither confuse nor rebel, neither slander nor interfere. Fathers do not weep for sons; lords do not weep for ministers; brothers do not weep for younger brothers; masters do not weep for disciples; the elderly die without illness; the young are cared for without harm. Sending off the dead and welcoming the living, mourning misfortune and celebrating fortune—this is the middle path, rare to preserve.

The heavens are joyful, no longer establishing merit; former blessings exhausted, yet still entering the ranks of misfortune. Therefore, the wise and enlightened wish to be born in the next world, follow masters in the Dao, receive teachings and complete transmission, attain immortality, live long and undying, called highest learning, superior to the middle path. The middle path may ascend; then one attains the highest learning. The method of highest learning is not for the ordinary or lowly to discuss.

### The Twenty-Four Categories of Sin and Their Remedies

**One. Frequent bereavements:** Grandfathers, masters, lords, close kin, relatives, old and young alike—if not due to proper calamity limits, the body suffers alike.

Any combination of four or six cases, totaling twenty-four matters, with thirty-eight included among them, encompassing many items, large and small doubts and disputes, is clarified here with notes. According to source fasting and apology, resolve and release. What is given and scattered, washed away with utmost sincerity, without regret or stinginess, great blessings will arrive. If not using gold and silk, then operate with heart and form, calculate strength and effort, count days and align precisely, able to give without counting, all depends on the person. Those unable, whether poor or rich, regulate to find the middle; the key is not to be stingy—stinginess is the first fault, three faults without cause.

---

The Eastern Sea’s Azure Youth Lord told the various Perfected Ones: “Your responses and transformations aid all beings. Whoever has aspiration must be encouraged. Transmit this formula, secretly and solemnly. Past generations have passed; now it is not fully revealed. Change yourself today, following this as the standard.” After fasting and apology, minor disasters vanish; great disasters remain unresolved, requiring urgent avoidance. Where to avoid depends on the cosmic chart, observing above and below, precisely and secretly without proclamation.

As the celestial texts say, great disasters will be removed; removing disasters summons blessings, beginning with this scripture. This scripture’s essential method is treasured inside and out, honored by all saints, its fame flowing to the ends of the origin.

The two lords came to keep this secret; Wei Huacun received the decree, practiced it with results, later transmitted independently and secretly. Few cultivate this text; few attain truth. The mysterious name and register must be obtained.

The highest are national masters; the middle are teachers among the people; the lower cultivate the self; the last teach others—these are the three grades.

## Scripture of the Primordial Truth of the Most High: The Eight Paths of the Destiny Register, Scroll Two

The Most High Great Dao’s qi pervades the Ten Directions. Human movement and stillness are but eightfold. Four sides and four corners, subordinate above and below, below and above, all governed by eight. The eight trigrams’ true spirits deploy the eight qi, with the Great One as master, the Three Primordials circulating.

Circulating through the human realm, within intervals lie paths; paths lead to the good, those with jade registers, practicing toward freedom, passing through eight gates, guiding to wandering feasts, reaching the Ten Directions. The holy multitudes of the Ten Directions all emerge from the eight gates. The Eight Paths of the Destiny Register record all the deeds of the holy multitudes.

Their deeds transform and aid goodness, sun yang and moon yin, yin virtue hidden and communicated, communicating divine wondrous formulas, secret to the holy perfected. Fasting and prohibitions are strict; those unable to resolve sins may not see or hear. Hearing and seeing without understanding, understanding without practice, practice without efficacy, only adds offenses.

But if one is utterly sincere, deeply thoughtful, and mysteriously moved, one will surely absolve sin, surely see this scripture, surely understand these matters, surely obtain great blessings, follow and cultivate, and attain truth.

The method of apology and fasting is practiced alone. If there are comrades, two, three, up to nine, no more. Escaping good karmic meetings is rare; often there are many wise. Beyond nine persons, form a separate fast; do not force together, lest offending the Nine Heavens, seeking blessings but gaining calamity. Each must be cautious.

---

For masters, friends, illnesses, and calamities unbearable to fast oneself, fellow students and companions may assist; even with partners, nine is the utmost. Masters lecture, supervise fasting, attend scriptures, incense, and lamps, holding registers according to method.

The eight paths, four seasons, six matters, eight festivals, Five Phases, twenty-four qi, faith, virtue, and earth merit pervade inside and out; therefore no separate seasonal fasts remain.

---

All assisted fasts must not accept the four essential items used by the fasting host. After the apology fast, the four items given are silently performed without letting others know. If asked, answer conveniently. If offerings are refused, do not force suspicion; give to others who will accept, no need to tell others, for they know acceptance or refusal.

---

The apology and fasting method universally uses the Three Primordials; the number of days varies by season: spring nine, summer three, autumn seven, winter five. Day and night follow the paths; six times and three times daily; meals in the morning include dried vegetables and fruits according to person.

Before the appointed days, sweep and cleanse inside and out, arrange ritual objects, distinguish pure and fresh, no last-minute filling or exceeding limits. Separation and prohibition must be strict; no noise or disorder.

Those fasting must not go outside; if going out, do not return; if returning, stay elsewhere; do not violate the fast place. Visitors stay at the gate to relay messages; household members translate; first rinse mouth and gargle, then rinse again; do not neglect.

Arrange altars, platforms, halls, rooms, beds, curtains, tables, incense utensils, offering seats, screens, curtains, and canopies, all clean and complete. Kitchens, tents, stoves, bathing rooms, and latrines must burn fragrant incense, not allowing foul qi to escape and pollute human dwellings.

Separate latrines must be established; sitting, lying, and relieving oneself must not mix; high and low must not mingle; all are subject to disaster and examination. To prevent calamity and seek blessings, be especially cautious.

On the eve of fasting assembly, whether eating or not, medicines differ; bathing should be the same. Even long fasts require bathing. After cleansing and settling, enter the room solemnly, following usual morning rites.

At the great repentance reading, a cantor chants names and titles; the master knocks teeth thirty-six times, kneels long, holding the text as follows:

---

*"Most Profound Capital of the Three Caverns, Master of the Great Cavern, Mr. So-and-so, Little Manifest True Person, disciple of the Three Sceneries, faithfully practicing the Great Cavern scriptures. If not receiving the Three Caverns, simply say: Most High Numinous Capital Jade Capital Purple Palace Jade Chamber Three Sceneries disciple, Great Cavern Master, Little Manifest True Person, Mr. So-and-so’s wife.

---

The petition continues naming place, clan, official titles, disciples, ages, residence, bowing and apologizing for sins, begging grace. It recounts past and present sins, vows to follow the scriptures and secret methods, hopes for forgiveness and extension of life, describes present calamities, fears and regrets, beseeches mercy and pardon, promising to wash heart and cleanse body, fast and apologize, begging for triple pardon, disaster removal, illness healing, official matters resolved, fate extended, vows not to offend, renewal, cultivation, attainment of immortal Dao seed, and grace of the present petition.

---

After the official departure, facing east, the first incense offering is made, chanting:

*"Most Profound Capital Great Cavern Three Sceneries disciple Little Manifest True Person, Mr. So-and-so, wife of Mr. So-and-so, I, your servant, now fast and practice the Dao, think spirit and recall truth, chant scriptures and open vows, soar through the Nine Heavens, thank the Three Primordials, burn incense and light lamps, hold this merit to absolve my offenses, cut off death’s root, bring down true correctness, inscribe name in the Supreme Clarity, save the Nine Mysterious Seven Ancestors, parents internal and external, cut off calamities, scatter wandering ghosts, forever leave hell, ascend to heaven, avoid five sufferings, receive blessings of the Southern Palace, turn and become true, aid and protect present, remove my thousands of foundations and countless trials, wash away old karmic ties, cleanse my sins, fulfill my matters.

Great Cavern Three Sceneries disciple Little Manifest True Person, Mr. So-and-so, wife of Mr. So-and-so, all born with bodily filth, encountering spiritual fortune, karmic blessings, cycling through the law’s gates, born into human path, honored by the high void’s residual light, enlightened from ignorance, able to smell the earthly form, reverently opening the sacred text. Masters, Daoists, male and female perfected, names recorded, on a certain year, month, day, hour, at a certain place, receiving from me, your servant, the High Mysterious Nine Heavens Dragon Book Phoenix Seal, Most High Jade Register, Three Pure Treasured Texts, volumes and talismans and formulas as many as recorded. Or ancestors received from certain masters Supreme Pure Treasured Scriptures, passed down generation to generation. Or by karmic encounter, on a certain year, month, day, hour, at a certain place, obtained. Offering, searching, reviewing repeatedly, consulting masters, explaining doubts, or seeking masters within the year but unable to meet, on a certain year, month, day, hour, at a certain place, a mysterious alliance. Vowing to follow and cultivate, fulfilling heart’s wish. Some recite scriptures and precepts, some combine elixir essence, those not yet combined say: now wishing to prepare medicines, immortal essential formulas, harmonize divine elixirs, or forbidden pills, powders, wines, and baits. Considering no beginning from the infinite past, karmic causes shallow, present merit thin, combination incomplete; also fearing past and present movement breaking precepts and violating scriptures, hidden and manifest sins daily accumulating and binding, unable to resolve, good intentions unexpressed; also fearing countless ancestors, seven generations of parents’ lifelong grudges heavy, sinking in three paths, lingering in five sufferings, not yet ascending, residual disasters flowing, delaying future lives, making true prayers hard to move, demons easily interfere, also considering past and present universal fasting and apologies, sincere but dim, not granted mercy.

The great repentance ends; facing east, knock teeth thirty-six times. Read the Five Vows—these have five days and three fasts universally applicable.

### The Five Vows

**First vow:** May I be born of the natural qi, within qi formed my body; body aligned with the Three Lights, long enjoying the root of infinity.

**Second vow:** May my body always dwell above the great void, within jade palaces and jade chambers, morning feasting with the Jade Emperor, evening roaming with the Mysterious Mother, thirst quenched with waves of jade springs and floods, hunger satisfied with dragon embryos, jade oils, scarlet trees, and red children.

**Third vow:** May my body be born with myriad marvels, seventy-two lights, strange hairs and unusual forms, flying feathered garments, riding the void and driving the air, entering and exiting imperial palaces, receiving multitudes’ celebrations, living ten thousand years without limit.

**Fourth vow:** May I live and die with qi, dying and being reborn, born as emperor, ruling the Ten Heavens, commanding all immortals.

**Fifth vow:** May all beings, born and unborn, equally protect the sun, moon, and Three Lights; those with Dao, Seven Mysterious Ancestors ascending Southern Palace; all blessings under heaven rightly bestowed; Four Directions and Five Vows all gathered in the Jade Hall.

---

The Nine Mysterious Vows support and nourish my body, soul, spirit, and true god, always dwelling in my palace, connecting above to heavenly immortals, below reaching mysterious abysses. May earth, wind, cloud, and spirit, the Five Vows united, fix my register for longevity; heaven sends purple smoke, earth guards five spirits, riding clouds and driving the void, flying carriages and green palanquins, ascending golden gates, advancing to the Jade Clarity, celebrating the Seven Ancestors, receiving rebirth. The upper vows unite five: wishing yin, yang, great void, great nothingness, great mystery, feasting in jade chambers with imperial cause, roaming birth gates, opening waves of the Nine Heavens, primordial father fixing register, mysterious mother recording years, peach health binding essence, firmly guarding the elixir field, body soaring as adamantine, name inscribed in jade texts, Seven Ancestors liberated, blessings arriving.

The lower vows also five: wishing great void, great existence, great high, great true, and immortals, moving body among Five Sacred Mountains’ ridges, soaring in Nine Skies, entering and exiting gates, escaping death’s door, wishing heaven and earth as parents, Three Lights guarding my years, myriad gods guarding nine springs’ orifices, spirits descending natural qi, using the Five Vows, raising sound to gather.

---

Vows complete, knock teeth twenty-seven times, chant:

*"Great Emperor Supreme Origin, Emperor One Mysterious Scripture, Five Clouds scatter light, pervading the Three Purities, jade youths and maidens, burning incense attending spirits, upper vows revealed, merging with me, making me immortal, ascending imperial court, northern emperor casting down death, southern guardian of life, eastern flower golden grid, receiving my name, infinite wishes, joined with me."*

Then knock teeth thirty-seven times, swallow qi five times, stopping.

---

Incantation complete, three incense twists, rekindle furnace, chant:

*"Three Primordials, Three Heavens, Five Sacred Mountains, Five Emperors, Immortal messengers, Three Qi true and correct, left and right dragons and tigers, heavenly immortals, earthly immortals, flying immortals, five spirit incense officers, commanding to summon Ten Directions’ righteous qi, natural golden liquid, elixir essence, spiritual herbs, Nine Mysterious Jade True, meeting in fasting hall, altar, spirit platform, penetrating my body, enabling me to study Dao, attain Dao, seek immortality, become immortal, fly through great void, ascend Nine Heavens, jade youths and maidens guarding incense smoke, presenting my petition before the Most High Limitless Supreme Great Dao Jade Emperor’s throne."*

---

Knock teeth nine times, swallow qi nine times, all stop. Rekindle furnace, resume circuit, chanting as before.

The six poems, one chanted each of six times; if three times alternate, cycle and repeat. After chanting, incantation and gargling as morning rites. After meals, scripture lectures at the door, also gargle mouth, knock teeth three times, store spirit as prescribed, bow heart three times, secret incantation:

*"Jade Emperor Supreme Law, heard by Three Purities, auspicious day for fasting, opening my spirit scripture, myriad trials hidden, all directions succeed, jade youths guarding, jade blossoms scattering fragrance, ascending Three Primordials, with me long life."*

Opening scripture also uses this.

---

Enter hall, face Dao, bow three times; if many people, circulate to east; if fixed place, all bow three times, or once, or mentally. After bowing, sit upright, settle, close eyes, grasp firmly, knock teeth, store head pure blue like jade, hands like cinnabar, feet like snow, soul ready on left, spirit guarding right, after a while open eyes, rub palms on table, sit up, store complete, ascend high seat, chant scripture and lecture. First bow to Dao seat nine times, three by one, ascend high seat, open scripture, first knock teeth thirty-six times, swallow qi thirty-six times, store returning wind mixing Great One, myriad true spirits, then secret incantation:

---

Read *Thirty-Nine Chapters*, *Female One*, *Great Abundance*, *Nine Truths*, *Great Elixir*, facing north, bow heart to four directions, knock teeth thirty-six times, swallow qi thirty-six times, store five viscera with five-colored light, infuse five stars’ essence, then read *Divine Land*, next *Hundred Spirits’ Inner Names*, then chant *Thirty-Nine Chapters*, heart and eyes correspond, no distractions, finish chapters without pause. Read thirty-one volumes, facing north, bow heart to four directions, knock teeth twenty-four times, swallow qi thirty-four times, store five stars, sun, moon, three essences, mysterious infusion to body, other volumes follow separate formulas.

---

Read *Wisdom Scripture* and hymns, first close eyes, knock teeth three times, swallow qi three times, store Three Primordial Lords in Golden Flower Palace, like an infant’s form, then chant. After scripture and lecture, all stand upright, bow to Three Reverences, three times, then all prostrate, knock teeth three times, secret blessing:

*"Rising Brahma, flourishing seven spirits, Great One’s duty, Five Spirits’ Yellow Peace, ascending Nine Heavens, joining emperor, begging to fly immortal, Seven Ancestors’ fetus infants, absolving offenses, cutting bonds, ascending Jade Clarity."*

---

Finish, knock teeth seven times, swallow qi thrice, stop. Rise, exit door, store spirit, morning and evening always, seven years ascend. Day and night, three and six times, incantations all same; entering altar has slight differences, mentioning halls and altars, interchangeable. Altars and halls inside and out all triple layered; upper seat great law, master enters inside, next lower seat in middle, next facing fasting outside. Hall and altar lamps, beyond seven and nine, burn as suitable; roughly following upper origin ninety, middle origin sixty, lower origin thirty-six, total one hundred eighty-six, arrayed left and right, gates, Tai Sui, monthly branches, daily stars, birth fate, and annual cycles. Tai Sui and birth fate lamps burn day and night; others only at night. If rain, burn two lamps in hall; others at doors. After practice, bow again to birth fate and Tai Sui lamps, open petitions and wishes, say as desired.

Also following *Four Extremities Bright Method*, Beginning of Spring and Spring Equinox nine lamps arranged in courtyard; Beginning of Summer and Summer Solstice eight; Beginning of Autumn and Autumn Equinox six; Beginning of Winter and Winter Solstice five; birth fate twelve lamps, eight festivals facing kings, birth fate facing Tai Sui, knock teeth twenty-four times, incantation:

*"Most High Supreme True, myriad saints and five emperors, sovereign jade officers, chief immortal supervisors, today auspicious morning, eight festivals open, yang sins and yin trials, utterly extinguish Nine Yin, now forever beginning, lifting Seven Mysterious, exempt from fiery realm, long leave knife mountains, three paths five sufferings, not burdening my body, attaining unity with heaven and earth, guarding imperial morning, five wishes eight meetings, nothing not as spoken."*

---

Finish, remove head covering, bow head one hundred twenty times, forehead touching ground, do not cause pain. Finish, restore head covering, look up to heaven, heart thoughts: “Today my body enjoys heaven’s grace, granted renewed form, reborn flying immortal.” Finish, swallow twenty-four qi, stop; three years offenses removed, body and truth united.

Altars and platforms in four directions, total one hundred eighty-six lamps; nine zhang tall, each side one hundred eighty-six, total six hundred forty-four. Additionally, one thousand eight hundred sixty lamps at gates, courtyards, alleys, attending until dawn; wind and rain stop lamps. Day limit ends; all words of merit concluded.

---

On the morning after fasting ends, after practice, do not rekindle furnace; continue chanting names and titles, all received Dao ranks, in order, greatest laws first, like Yellow Simplicity; if joining master’s register, calendar reckoning precedes.

Open to Three Primordials Supreme True Cavern Nine Mysterious Great Void Most High Jade Emperor, Thirty-Nine Emperors, Twenty-Four Truths, Ancient Mysterious Lords, Primordial Elders, Most High Jade Morning Great Dao Lord, Four Supervisors Five Emperors, Myriad Dao Primordial Supreme, Ultimate Heavenly Venerable.

We love Dao and immortality, vow to soar Nine Mysterious, ascend supreme truth, visit Most High True, on a certain year, month, day, hour, at certain place, opening fasting and uprightness, practicing Dao, chanting scriptures, thinking spirit, recalling truth, combining medicines and essence, apologizing for sins, establishing merit, washing heart, exerting fully, following law and formulas, cultivation complete, day limit ended, petitions sent to Most High Three Primordials, Three Purities, Three Treasures, immortal attendants, Five Directions Five Emperors’ spirit supervisors, fasting masters, ritual attendants, flying immortals, heavenly immortals, earthly immortals, spirit immortals of Five Sacred Mountains, Four Marshes, and Four Directions, overseeing true officials and spirit immortals, visiting true palace, promoting upper immortals, conferring ranks and imperial titles, according to rank appointing true positions.

Following Supreme True rites, let us and Nine Mysterious Seven Ancestors, internal and external ancestors, all freed from dark night, enter brightness, resolve past sins, prosper blessings. We practice Dao, attain Dao, seek immortality, become immortal, refine elixirs, make gold, think deeply and sense, commune with spirits, apologize and absolve, pray for blessings, divide forms and transformations, seventy-four directions, Three Primordials descend, summon green palanquins, fly to Supreme Clarity, ascend Nine Heavens, sun and moon shine together, Three Treasures wheel in unison. Humbly beseech Most High to witness elixir feelings. We study methods, not yet perfect in posture, fasting laws difficult and often violating wondrous tracks, not conforming to rites, advancing and retreating violating rules, held by Four Supervisors, grasped by Five Emperors, thousands of offenses and myriad sins, especially hoping for pardon, mercy for ignorance and failure, rewarding good hearts, not punishing. Our five-body true officials, seeking immortal posts, ascend Numinous Capital, receive ranks, return to our bodies, ascending with us. Humbly report, respectfully awaiting orders, trembling with awe, bow twice and thrice.

---

Finish, bow again, twist incense thrice, rekindle furnace, chant incantations and gargle as usual.

All offerings and deeds use proper fasting days, performed at will; if wind or rain obstruct, may postpone until after fasting, not exceeding nine days. Beyond this, fast again, first apologizing for deep offenses, if matters fail, now report again, begging pure heart. During fasting, auspicious or inauspicious, public or private offenses, if fasting not completed, later renew; ten times or a hundred times, continue until response, then stop.

---

Number of fasting days for four seasons must not be exceeded or reduced; all take full cycles. If physical strength insufficient, sell goods or borrow help. Offerings distributed widely, must be comrades, not mixed strangers. Remote or distant residences require strict arrangements for boats and carriages, plan effort and fasting days, complete work, no delay or procrastination. If suddenly encountering hardship or forgetting prior deeds, blessings turn to calamity; each must be cautious.

If ritual items lost or stolen, water, fire, thieves, demons, filthy creatures, all should be entrusted to treatment houses, reported, burned, and buried; not supplied to mundane or vulgar uses; all renewed and handled by law, with separate petitions and apologies.

---

If multiple disasters and sins, or all twenty-four categories present, must not be resolved all at once; take three years of full cycles, three years of twenty-four solar terms, none omitted; omission requires restarting. This is very difficult; only those with pure intent can accomplish. Failure to do so means no Dao attainment; future fate will not match today; today’s wishes require diligent, precise, and unforgotten cultivation; all will bear fruit.

Some disasters and calamities, some sins interrelated, grouped in six categories, can be resolved simultaneously; no need to resolve one matter per six times. After three years without response, then one matter at a time can be resolved; after full cycles of years, surely ascend.
