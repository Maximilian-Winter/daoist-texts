# Purple Script Instructions for Practice

Dunhuang manuscripts S・4314, S・6193, and p・2751 originally formed a single scroll. After combining them, the scroll’s beginning is damaged and untitled, while the end bears the title *Purple Script Instructions for Practice*. The first half of the manuscript contains the *Purple Script Instructions for Practice*, and the latter half the *Nine Truths and Eight Paths Instructions for Practice*. The main scripture text in large characters likely dates to the Eastern Jin dynasty, with the smaller commentarial notes probably authored by Gu Huan or Tao Hongjing of the Southern Dynasties. The text here is based on a facsimile from Da Yuan Ren’er’s *Catalogue of Dunhuang Daoist Scriptures*.

### Essential Methods on the Second, Fourth, Sixth, Eighth, Tenth, Fourteenth, Sixteenth, Eighteenth, Twentieth, Twenty-second, and Twenty-fourth Days of the Month

Performing practice on these eleven days within a single month suffices to become an immortal. At evening on these days, the yin essence takes flight and merges; the three breaths overflow abundantly; the moon’s water crystallizes into blossoms; the Yellow Spirit descends to receive them. Practicing for eighteen years on these days, one should refine the soul and transform the corporeal spirit in the Upper Purity, reflecting with jade radiance, riding the mysterious reins of light, soaring through the vastness of the heavens.

These days are all even-numbered. As for the twenty-sixth and twenty-eighth days, the month’s count has already reached the void of the cycle; the thirtieth day fluctuates between large and small months, so these are not to be taken. The twelfth day is also omitted, perhaps because the essence is then deficient; it is not necessary to be overly exact.

### Moon Talisman

The Purple Tenuity wears the moon essence with the Great Mysterious Yin Talisman. The prior method of wearing the moon’s power was also bestowed by the Supreme Subtlety, but this talisman speaks of Purple Tenuity, as mentioned in the incantations. ◇◇◇◇◇◇ Now the incantation talisman is called the Purple Tenuity Yellow Scripture, and the moon-wearing incantation is called the Flying Immortal Purple Tenuity. Though they seem to employ the yin and yang of sun and moon, their uses differ.

At midnight on the last night of the lunar month, write the Yellow Scripture on blue paper, facing east as you wear it, first announcing to the moon’s soul. At this time, first wear the Enlightening Spirit Talisman. The sun is vermilion, the moon yellow—these are their true colors. On that night, write both talismans, since they share one evening; first wear the sun talisman, then the moon talisman, not ◇◇◇◇ but write it so. At midnight on the last night, sun and moon both lie in the east, the moon following the sun’s path, so also face east when wearing.

When about to wear the moon talisman, close the breath; hold the talisman in the right hand; with heart recite: “Moon’s yin image,” hence the right hand is used; the regulation follows prior methods. The Purple Tenuity Yellow Scripture is named the Great Mysterious; it summons the moon’s radiant water, nourishes the spirit, harmonizes the soul, strictly enforces the formula within, emanates from the mysterious gate, conceals the moon in heaven, calls the Five Spirits Ladies, flies the light through the Nine Paths, reflects brightly upon the Five Rhythms of the Mud Pellet. Upon finishing the incantation, wear the talisman, rolling it with the right hand to swallow it; it may be swallowed ten times blackened, preserving it to ascend into the Mud Pellet. This shows the sun resides in the heart, the moon in the Mud Pellet—this is the meaning of wearing the talisman. Both talismans say to first announce to the sun and moon’s souls, meaning that on the following day one should wear the sun and moon talismans, first making the essence and breath ascend, summoning the two souls to prepare and receive. Since the moon’s cycle changes, the edict is renewed at each month’s end.

### Capturing the Soul

The Supreme Subtlety Spirit Scripture Purple Script details the method to capture the three souls: on the third, thirteenth, and twenty-third evenings of the lunar month. Since the soul has three parts, these three days correspond to the moon’s threes. The gods and ghosts are still yin, so all are done at evening. Even if □◇◇◇□ evening, one must lie down to perform; the earlier in the evening, the better, so one can remain sleepless all night. If dwelling in the mountains without worldly affairs, one may do this every evening, not limited to these three days.

At this time, the three souls are unsettled; the ethereal spirit floats and wanders; the fetal light releases form; the hidden essence disturbs and calls. The ethereal spirit, fetal light, and hidden essence are the three lords of the soul. The three souls originally reside in the heart; the number three is great, hence three gods; this also corresponds to the position of Zhen, the meaning of left three and right seven. Each evening, the souls abandon the body to roam, rushing forth from their chamber, sometimes seen and restrained by other souls or ghosts; sometimes captured by malevolent entities; sometimes unable to return, leaving form and releasing substance; sometimes attacked by external souls, the two breaths battling, all restless like newborn infants, causing other thoughts, coming and going without form, the heart sorrowful and the mind oppressed.

Daoists should capture and detain them to prevent wandering. The soul is called capture, the corporeal spirit called restrain—both are good in meaning. Yet the Flying Step incantation reverses this, saying capture the corporeal spirit and restrain the soul; the Five Celestial Incantations say likewise. It is unclear why the perfected ones differ in method. Wherever such is found, after attaining the Dao, I vow to petition and correct it. The soul is a benevolent spirit; its main trouble is abandoning the body and wandering elsewhere, touching malevolent entities, causing injury and disorder, not conforming to the Yellow Elder, nor serving the Great Lords, thus causing internal and external harm.

Nowadays, sometimes the essence and spirit are confused and lost; if something is lost, or the complexion is dull and habitual, or behavior confused and bewildered, these are all because the soul has departed and not returned, moving about for days before returning. If thus lost, the body remains ill, leading to ◇◇.

### Method to Capture and Detain

When lying down to sleep, face upward, place a pillow under the feet, cross the hands over the heart, restrain the corporeal spirit by removing the pillow—this means not to remove it entirely, but lower it about two inches, keeping the body level. At first lying down, first preserve the chamber’s affairs; after completing these, preserve the Three Palaces’ Great Lords; then remove the pillow from the feet, cover the two hands crossed, properly covering the heart, left hand on top. Close the eyes, seal the boundary for three breaths; tap the teeth three times in succession; then close the breath as if breathing thrice that long, then slowly open and tap teeth again. Each three taps correspond to the three souls’ intention.

Preserve the heart with a red-black orb like a chicken’s egg, emerging from within upward through the eyes, then out of the eyes; the red orb turns large, covering the body, flowing downward, reaching the head’s summit. Although the soul is in the heart, this is the liver spirit; thus the heart must not let the eyes exit to prolong it. Preserve this red breath as large as a chicken’s egg, shining and flickering as it rises from the heart through the internal orifice to the left eye, then gradually emerging and enlarging, eventually enveloping the whole body, reaching both sides of the mat, like a quilt covering the head, mingling closely with the body, only not wrapping around the back of the ears.

It transforms into fire, burning the body, making the whole body like glowing embers, inside and out thoroughly illuminated, like burning charcoal. When completed, one should feel a slight warmth within the body, preserving the red orb covering the body suddenly transforms into fire, burning the body; at first it is a blazing flame, after a while all turns to charcoal; bones, flesh, and five organs shine brightly; the three souls are also red. At this time, the self remains alive, but the body is red only. First imagine heat, then truly feel it.

Then tap teeth three times again; after finishing, call the three souls’ names, preserving the ethereal spirit at the Mysterious Gate serving the Great Lord, guarding the seven corporeal spirits; fetal light in the chamber facing the Yellow Elder, serving the Red Infant, guarding the Mud Pellet; hidden essence in the heart receiving regulation. Then call their names, each at their proper place. The three gods—ethereal spirit, fetal light, hidden essence—quickly halt; then softly recite: “Supreme Subtlety’s Mysterious Palace, Central Yellow begins blue; internally refining the three souls, fetal light at peace; divine treasure jade chamber, born with me; do not move recklessly; the observer is Most Numinous. If you wish to fly, only go to the Great Ultimate Upper Purity; if hungry or thirsty, only drink the Returning Water Jade Essence, sixty-four characters.” All complete.

Then suddenly forget the body for a long time, then again recall other thoughts. The soul transforms and ◇◇◇◇◇ wanders; the corporeal spirit remains hungry and thirsty, listening and moving about. The Returning Water, Moon Yellow, and so on are all transformations of the Langkai Elixir; these are not attainable by soul or spirit, hence the oath.

### Restraining the Corporeal Spirit

The Supreme Subtlety Spirit Scripture Purple Script restrains the seven corporeal spirits: on the new moon, full moon, and last night of the month—these three days are crucial meetings of the moon, when ghosts roam and run wild. The full moon is calculated by the calendar, sometimes the fifteenth or sixteenth day. The corporeal spirits are fierce and restless, so constant restraint is best, done every evening if possible.

At this time, the seven corporeal spirits wander, roaming filth and impurity, sometimes mingling with blood and food, visiting ghosts and demons; sometimes associating with corpses; sometimes seducing the Red Infant, gathering conspiracies and attacking homes; sometimes reporting human sins to the Three Officials and River Lord; sometimes transforming into M®, causing disgust; sometimes inviting ghosts into the body, calling the breath and substance. All residual illnesses in people come from the corporeal spirits; delight in death is their nature; desire for ruin is their disease. They constantly wish to cause death, roaming tombs and graves, enjoying village offerings, harming descendants.

Thus they cause confused thoughts and illusions, mingling life and death, sometimes mingling impurity, sometimes connecting with food and drink, wandering in improper places, causing fright and obsession. Such deceptions are manifold, causing spirit to stray, thoughts to be disturbed, worries and fears, hidden calamities and sudden illnesses—these are all harms caused by the corporeal spirits, so restraint is urgent.

Daoists should restrain and urge them, saying the incantation must not move recklessly. To refine and transform them means they never return nine times; to control and correct them means gentle harmony; to gather and awe them means heavenly hunting guards the gate.

The first corporeal spirit is named Corpse Dog; the second, Hidden Arrow; the third, Sparrow Yin; the fourth, Swallowing Thief; the fifth, Non-Poison; the sixth, Removing Filth; the seventh, Stinking Lung. These are the seven corporeal spirits’ yin names, the impure ghosts within the body. This ◇◇◇◇ filth and slander are all evil eyes. The number seven corresponds to the corporeal spirits always residing in the lungs; the lungs are the metal spirit, thus able to attack breath.

Though the soul always desires life, it is the wood spirit, so is often suppressed by the corporeal spirits, residing in the heart with a slight fire to control them. Hence people who do evil are always many. If one guards the Three Palaces and Eight Scenes, these seven ghosts naturally subside.

The method of restraint: lie properly, remove pillow from feet, cover ears with palms, fingers touching, crossed at the nape. This too is done after first cultivating preservation. Then lie properly, remove pillow, cross hands and pillow, palms covering ears, fingers touching beneath the brain’s gate. Feet cover the mat behind, stepping on the tortoise and snake. Close breath seven times, tap teeth seven times—this is like closing seven breaths.

Before, no mention of closing eyes, because one should preserve the Azure Dragon in the eyes, though one should also lightly observe. Preserve a white orb at the nose tip like a small bean, gradually growing to crown the body ninefold, from head to feet. This too is preserving the white breath portion, emerging from the feet, passing throat, exiting the right nostril, shining brightly, growing layer upon layer, starting from outside, encircling the crown, body, back ninefold; when counted, the nose tip is finished.

The soul is called the enveloping body, so must cover above; this is called crowning the body, so must encircle. Now using the white breath from the lungs exiting the nose tip is the original palace’s family matter, a small point with no room, exiting the right nostril; the Five Spirits preserve pure brightness, exiting the right hole, so this can be the standard. The red orb exits the eyes and should not suddenly exit both; thus it is made to exit the left eye. Such matters are not fully detailed in the scriptures and should be judged by intention, not done recklessly.

When finished, the white heat suddenly transforms into the Heavenly Hunt, making two Azure Dragons in the eyes. The body is within the ninefold layers; breath transforms first from within, gathering and closing the two beams in the eyes, starting from the left, each becoming an Azure Dragon, body within the pupil, head extending outward, each nine inches long. Two White Tigers in the two nostrils, both facing outward; next two black energies gather in the nostrils, also starting from the left, each becoming a White Tiger, body inside the hole, head turning outward, each seven inches long.

Though the dragon and tiger bodies are small and compressed, their forms are vivid, with teeth and claws, shining horns, fierce and awe-inspiring. The Vermilion Bird sits above the heart, facing the person ◇; next a gathering above the heart transforms into the Vermilion Bird, standing with feet on the heart, wings spread covering the sides, beak poised over ◇, reaching lips and teeth, imagined as three feet long from head to tail.

The Cang Turtle is under the left foot, the Ling She under the right. Next two ungathered energies under the feet, left transforms into Cang Turtle, five inches long; right into Ling She, also turtle-colored, five feet long. Both cover the mat; Ling She’s form coils, tail wrapping the turtle, head extended ◇◇◇◇, soles stepping on its back, serene and content.

These four spirits’ forms are as now depicted by people, except the turtle and snake are slightly different, not entwined as the Black Tortoise. In the ears are Jade Maidens, dressed in dark brocade, at the ear gates, each holding a flame in both hands. Outside are two blacks piercing the palms, stimulating the ear gates, also starting from the left, each becoming a Jade Maiden, five inches long, dressed in dark brocade, hair in flying cloud bun, hands holding flames, joining four fires. Within my palms, at the ear gates, facing forward seated. These are the ear gods, Proud Maidens, and Cloud Maidens.

Thus white and black are all complete; also preserve the seven hunts and two maidens, all present at once. After a while, all complete, swallow saliva seven times, tap teeth seven times, call the seven corporeal spirits’ names. The seven taps and swallows complete the seven corporeal spirits; some still swallow saliva because the corporeal spirits love breath, so harmonize with it.

This only says call, not preserve, meaning the seven corporeal spirits are together in one place, unlike the three souls which are separate, so preservation is needed. One should also imagine the seven forms accompanying, standing in the spleen near the life gate on the right, guarded by the first soul ethereal spirit, restrained from moving. Then call: Corpse Dog, Hidden Corpse, Sparrow Yin, Swallowing Thief, Non-Poison, Removing Filth, Stinking Lung.

Each name called three times; these souls and spirits are truly my body’s gods and ghosts; if one masters the Dao, they are easily summoned and subdued, no need for triple calling. Afterward, softly recite: “Pure breath ninefold, restrain the corporeal spirits’ evil; Heavenly Hunt guards the gate; Proud Maiden holds the pass; refine the corporeal spirits, harmonize gently, be at peace with me; do not move recklessly; watch and inspect the source of form; if you hunger or thirst, listen and drink the Moon Yellow and Sun Elixir’s two characters.” All complete.

Then suddenly forget the body for a long time, then again recall other thoughts. The seven corporeal spirits close inward, guarding and restrained. If practiced constantly, the corporeal spirits’ impurities diminish and vanish, transforming to good, the spirit harmonizes with the Three Palaces, merging with the primordial spirit. This is called constant practice, meaning on new, full, and last moon days without fail, doing it every evening is better. When the corporeal spirits are diminished and dissolved, impurity refined to goodness, spirit and Three Palaces harmonize, receiving regulation, then no longer desire human death.

### The Three Primordial Palace Spirits and the Seven Gods

A person’s body has three primordial palace spirits; at the life gate is the Mysterious Gate Great Lord and the three souls’ gods, together seven gods, all residing within the form, wishing to grant long life, benevolent and greatly auspicious. These seven gods are always present in both Daoist and secular, wise and foolish alike; if their spirits are pure, bright, and clear, one is talented and refined; if vulgar and dark, one’s nature and conduct are coarse and clumsy. When residing in the body, there is no illness; if wandering about, illness arises; when each fades and declines, the great gods depart, thus death.

The seven corporeal spirits also arise within the body, but act as enemies and robbers, so must be restrained. Daoists only know how to seek immortality methods, but not how to restrain the corporeal spirits, thus cannot avoid futility. Though soul and spirit both arise from parents, the corporeal spirit receives added yin impurity; yin impurity gathers filth, always allied with corpse worms, always seeking to trap people in error.

Good and evil principles oppose; vital breath harmonizes; this is the natural law. In all scriptures, such as the Three Races and Seven Primordials, there are wondrous and supreme matters, but none explain the names of soul and spirit; only now do we understand them. These two gods always reside within the body; common people know they exist; shamans and mediums sometimes glimpse their forms. As for their names, these are secret in ancient and modern times, hidden from the world; if seen, it is deeply concealed.

Among human scriptures, there are five-phase secret talismans to call souls and summon spirits, saying to wear the Five Phases to call souls; such separate methods also require talismans. Since scriptures are not yet practiced, one should first use this method.

But consider one point: now that soul and spirit have left the body, what form do they wear? Surely not like our appearance, but each should follow its original palace’s color and image; as for length and size, each according to its use. This must be clarified first. Shamans only see one person, which may not be true.

### The Three Ones

The three primordial palaces’ locations:

- The Upper Primordial Palace is in the Mud Pellet; its god is the Red Infant, character “Xian,” also called Emperor Minister.

- The Middle Primordial Palace is at the center of the Crimson Chamber; its god is the Perfected One, character “Zi Dan,” also called Radiant Firm.

- The Lower Primordial Dan Tian Palace is three cun below; its god is the Infant, character “Yang Zi,” also called Valley Profound.

These are the three one gods. The three palaces’ locations correspond to those prescribed in the Three Ones Scripture, though names differ and combine here; this method is subtle and profound, blending into one body, so no longer requiring paired sitting and mutual support, nor rank and position.

Since there are seven gods, each must have two. The so-called “Golden Gate Emperor Lord’s True Scripture” first chapter is likely this section.

When wishing to capture and restrain soul and spirit, first call their names; preserve the three gods, all jade-colored with golden radiance, infantile in appearance; the upper two wear red garments, the lower yellow; heads like newborn infants. Preserve the three souls’ essence and color like jade shining like gold; their attire as in the Three Ones Scripture, but omitting mention of imagined grasping of objects.

When wearing colors and forms, call in heart: “Upper Primordial Mud Pellet Palace Red Infant, character Xian, also called Emperor Minister.” Then preserve middle and lower primordial palaces likewise. After preserving the Mysterious Gate, then capture and restrain.

When practicing Dao and wearing breath, also call names. Whenever cultivating preservation, at beginning of inhalation and exhalation, do likewise. If practicing the method of replenishment, also first call this method, then can preserve and cultivate the Great Lord’s affairs.

### The Great Lord

The life gate is the Qi. From Qi to three cun below is all called the life gate, just as the head is all called the Mud Pellet. But entering three cun is the place below the life gate. The Mysterious Gate is the passage of the original birth umbilical cord. People’s lives are all tied by the Qi, like the umbilical cord; after birth it naturally falls away, becoming the source of primordial black.

Within it is the Birth Palace; inside the palace dwells the Great Lord named Peach Child, character Heyan, wearing vermilion robes, purple cap and crown, sitting facing the life gate. This Mysterious Gate Birth Palace is the one cun bright hall palace. Within one cun dwell the Three Old Lords, the Great Lord on the left. Now preserved as small near the left side, looking like a jade infant, dressed in vermilion robes, wearing purple lotus crown, right hand holding the Emperor Elephant talisman, sitting facing outward; since facing the front of the life gate, it is said to sit at the life gate.

Juanzi says: The bright hall Three Old Lords’ palace, lungs and spleen together; at dawn the lungs return to spleen, ◇□ right side. Both left and right are invited. This is just outside the spleen □◇◇. The three soul gods attend nearby. Though the three soul gods always serve the Great Lord, here they separate. Previously, the second soul was thought to reside in the chamber; if combined, it would not fit, so it returns here, only the second ethereal spirit remains.

However, the three souls’ joy is not constant; sometimes separated, sometimes united, depending on thought. Now one should preserve all three souls standing to the Great Lord’s left, also guarding the seven corporeal spirits. The Great Lord always holds the Heavenly Emperor Elephant talisman to combine and pour primordial black, supplement and reverse the fetus. This god is the origin of the umbilical Qi, essence having no fixed abode, so always holding this talisman to guide and pour, making fluids flow, supplementing brain and nourishing marrow.

At evening lying down, first close the black breath for twenty-four breaths, then heartfully recite the great gods’ names thrice, then swallow saliva fifty times, tap teeth thrice, preserve the three palaces completely, then close and preserve the Great Lord’s wearing colors and my soul as above. After counting, call in heart: “Mysterious Gate Birth Palace Great Lord Peach Child, character Heyan.” Finished, then slowly swallow saliva, preserving to pour fluids into the gate □◇◇◇.

Softly recite: “Fetal spirit great god, imperial thread heavenly lord, holding the umbilical talisman, head wrapped in purple crown, yellow turning red, ascending essence at life gate, transforming spirit to reverse birth, six harmonies mutually cause, form and body shining bright, jade maiden wedded to the five rhythms.” Finished.

If practiced constantly for eighteen years, the Great Lord will be able to excite the three fields on the left, govern the three blacks on the right; the fields transform into flying chariots, the swallow into a mysterious dragon; commanding the twenty-four gods above, overseeing souls below; calling the six yang officials of the Heavenly Stem, summoning the six yin officials of the Earthly Branch; a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders ascend to Heaven by day—all are the Great Lord Peach Child’s influence.

Though the Dao is small, it is still worthy of regard. The bright hall Three Old Lords’ method is highest; next is the middle section of the *Yellow Court Inner Scripture*; on the right is the Yellow and Red Inner Truth method. If practiced properly, one can become immortal, but pure truth is not compared by virtue, thus considered lowly and base.

Juanzi says: Heyan dwells on the left, governing true life spirit, able to excite cloud wheels on the left, gallop flying dragons on the right, commanding twenty-four gods above, overseeing souls below, a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, calling yang and summoning yin, ascending to Heaven by day; this wondrous matter comes from the *Spirit Scripture Purple Script Upper Scripture*.

Yang Tong dwells on the right, governing yin to harmonize yang, harmonizing the two forms, returning the elixir to the yellow, crossing the six harmonies, filling essence and Five Phases, also able to raise the whole body to ascend to Great Clarity; this Dao is rugged and difficult, only perfected ones can practice; its wondrous matter is detailed in the *Yellow and Red Inner Truth*.

Ling Yuan dwells in the center, governing the stomach to generate flesh, harmonizing blood and pouring fluids, dispersing hardness and dissolving firmness, condensing essence, form, and spirit; eliminating all ailments and collapse, strengthening corporeal spirit and refining the soul, ears and eyes sharp, face bright and fresh; also able to lightly rise and float in the air, ascending to the Great Firmament at dawn.

This is the matter of the bright hall Three Old Lords as explained by Zhou Ziyang quoting Juanzi. The left lord’s name is this scripture; the right is called Tao Kang, character Yang Tong; the middle is called Hun Kang, character Ling Yuan; each has its domain, differing in importance.

The *Seeking Truth Scripture*’s methods are all used by both men and women, with no partial practice. As for the gods within the body, all are male in form, with no difference in crown or clothing; only Dao One is the lord of differentiation, made manifest by the descending palace maiden, hence explicitly mentioned; the rest are male in form.

This incantation says the jade maiden is the wife of the body, not meaning wife or concubine, but wife meaning equality; that the jade maiden lies with oneself, like the mysterious Dao; the jade maiden descends and sleeps with the son; how could women not practice this? The Lady of the Tortoise Terrace is the original form. Many worldly scholars are confused about this, so it is again explained.

### Elephant Talisman

Supreme Subtlety Emperor Lord Heavenly Emperor Elephant Talisman.

The right Heavenly Emperor Elephant Talisman is given to the Birth Palace Great God Peach Child Heyan, to combine and pour primordial black, governing the umbilical cord and essence. Written in vermilion on blue paper, worn at midnight on the new and full moon nights, facing north. Hold the talisman in the left hand, close the breath; rise at midnight, bind the belt, burn incense; face north, write the talisman; after finishing, each in turn finishes, then close eyes and seal the beam, preserving the Great Lord, then recite incantation.

Heart recites: “Heavenly Emperor mysterious scripture, imperial elephant spirit talisman, to combine primordial black, govern essence, reverse the umbilical cord, ten thousand years infant, flying immortal heavenly pivot, Birth Palace Great God, spreading elixir and vermilion, head adorned with purple crown, conspiring with me in five rhythms.” Finished, then wear; after wearing, rise and bow twice.

Wear the talisman on the bed; one by one roll and wear, each preserved until reaching the Great Lord’s place; then take with left hand, still facing north, bow to Supreme Subtlety Heavenly Emperor. This is the method to return fluids and pour essence; thus it should be done at the sleeping place, no need for other quiet rooms.

### On Practicing the Method of Returning Essence

If a Daoist has the method to circulate and return essence, turning yellow to red, morning essence pouring into life, pouring fluids and moistening liquids, making men and women both attain elixir, face glowing with jade luster, then one should know the Great Lord’s name and importance; wearing the elephant talisman grants immortality.

If in the world one has not severed the conjugal Dao, still practicing inner truth, then both men and women should practice and wear; one person alone must not use it. If only practicing without knowing the gods’ names, returning essence without wearing this talisman, not seeing its incantation, not understanding the palace where it dwells, though gaining a thousand years of life, one ultimately returns to the corpse under the Great Yin, merely accumulating years of life, thus bones return to the Three Officials.

This means only able to refine essence and practice inner truth, good at understanding yang communication, but not knowing this left section’s secret incantation and the elephant talisman’s essential method; though able to extend life by hundreds or thousands, one will never become immortal. How much more so now when no one can practice and yet desires it; they bring decay and death upon themselves, as they deserve.

Daoists lying down at evening always preserve the Great Lord, reciting incantations; on new and full moons wear the talisman; next, circulate fetal essence’s benefits; thus also becoming immortals, without the bother of male-female returning and supplementing methods.

Humans have male and female yin and yang forms; their pairing corresponds to plants and insects, also natural to mind and nature. Now, being solitary in forest and marsh, severed from mates deep in rocks and clouds, no longer having intercourse, also hidden in forbidden texts, when the four qi gather and mingle, how can there be no spring feelings or autumn qi? Thus the spirit gate becomes blocked and stagnant, essence and thought condense and disperse, then malevolent spirits mingle and leave, heart matters fluctuate, inner spirit pool empties and leaks, outer appearance declines and withers.

Therefore, one should wear talismans to replace the benefits of circulation and refinement, preserve the spirit to guide and transform, so the two breaths are balanced, spirit harmonized and joined. This is truly the excellent method for the body, the utmost key to cosmic stillness.

Yet to control women to fly and soar, to circulate boundaries seeking heavenly immortals, is a severe play more than water and fire, breath attacks faster than axe and chisel; without a heart of ashes embracing unity, one is likely to lose by this. Those of middling talent practicing this, swallowing swords yet wishing the throat not be harmed, may succeed.

Inner truth matters are so harmful; only the highest talent can practice, yet despise its shallow filth. Middle and lower practitioners thus abandon such arts forever. Nowadays worldly followers all dig into the Three Officials’ pen; alas, how lamentable!

---

### Taboos

The Birth Palace Great God forbids people eating raw blood, burning six livestock’s hair, burning gourd, garlic skins and leaves, and all kinds of smelly vegetables; all disturb and disrupt the fetal beam, foul and harm the infant god—be careful.

All smoke, stench, blood, and filth must be avoided, not only these few items. This lists only the main taboos. Human hair, hunting horns, bird feathers, insect skins, and such are all hated by the body’s gods; if touching these taboos, the spirit and essence flee and scatter, accumulating for years, suddenly startled to death—how lamentable!

---

### Repentance of Faults

Dao practitioners, by the Autumn Equinox, all preserve true fasting and abstinence, not thinking of evil, heart always wishing to fly immortal. This is the usual practice of learners, not only on the Autumn Equinox day, but especially on this day.

Ancient perfected ones said: “If you wish to ascend to Heaven, be cautious on the Autumn Equinox; sins, great or small, are all reported above; seeking immortality by sin is very difficult; thus learning Dao is a cold heart.” This is the true essential teaching.

The Azure Lord says these are words of ancient first Dao attainments. In the era of Heavenly Emperor and Divine Farmer, though no exact calendar reckoning, the seasonal meetings were all known; by the time of Xuanying, the month was already watered.

If long fasting Daoists on the Autumn Equinox all repent to the seven ancestors and grandparents, down to all their sins, seeking self-change and vows. At noon on that day enter the secret chamber, face north, burn incense, open and close to the Most High Holy Lord and all teaching true assemblies, bow twice according to number, then state first and repent. The form is like the Five Communications method, also vowing not to offend again. According to people’s words, this also has special efficacy, only not identical. If not truly perfected and utterly pure, be cautious on this day to repent sins.

If not of high resolve and lofty spirit, heart firm and breath pure, do not all take this vow; Pei’s commentary says: “If one repeats sins, they cannot be resolved.” If the essence is so minded, one surely will not offend again; then according to circumstances, state repentance, but do not be careless with words.

This day’s repentance is essential, also similar to the Five Communications, but does not fully show the ritual; given briefly. Pei’s Eight Sections are the words of Master Zhi Gong, already reviewed by perfected ones, so can be used, also should consult the Autumn Equinox matter and apply.

Preserve truth. The Azure Youth Lord’s name is ◇◇◇, preserved every festival day. This name’s first character should be recorded in the Jade Register’s sound, not like the Buddha’s pronunciation. On festival days, ordinary days, noon, and midnight, enter the chamber, burn incense, bow twice, preserve notes, open and recite incantations, to request the gods and immortals to record names in the Azure Register, saying whatever comes to mind. At sunrise facing the sun, preserve cultivation according to the Dingmao method for best effect.

The Azure Lord is the prime minister, holding the register of life, observing and verifying the people, eight festivals and auspicious occasions, thus commanding prayers and preservation. Though the name is recorded, it is taken from the scripture’s own claim of a humble servant, not to be called aloud. Now not suitable for Daoists; if the heart recognizes and remembers, then no offense.

### The Purple Script Instructions Complete

### Seven: Ninth Truth and Eight Paths Instructions for Practice, Part Seven

The Ninth Truth and Eight Paths are named for their number of matters.

---

### Bathing

The Eight Paths Secret Words say: The Ninth Truth and Eight Paths are methods of preservation and cultivation, all proclaimed by the Yellow Elder, thus mutually assisting. The Ninth Truth matters are written in secret words.

Those wishing to practice the Ninth Truth method should fast and purify the room, practice the Ninth Truth path, introspect nine times a day, carefully examining essence, requiring concentration and stillness; without fasting and guarding quiet, it is difficult to practice constantly.

Often on the third day of the third month and fifth day of the fifth month, bathe in east-flowing water. Also bathe on the day of Jiazi, burning incense beside the bath, then facing the king millet, bowing twice.

Though bathing on Jiazi is distinguished later, its day’s ritual differs, so not the same phrase, not meaning to not use east-flowing water. Use hot water, bathing earlier or later according to cold or heat; by noon dry hair and bathe again. Bathing is always facing the king, burning incense at the place; after finishing, comb hair, bind belt, tidy clothes, burn incense in the quiet room, again face the king, bow and kneel.

Heart recites: “Most High Supreme Perfected, essence of nine spirits, make so-and-so flying immortal, ascend Purple Court, bathe in the flower pool, body and spirit clear and pure, essence penetrates the great void, five organs spontaneously produce four rhythms.” Judging by this incantation, it is after bathing to bow and recite, hence the word “finished.”

Also in the incantation for bathing, all say not to use separately; if meaning to burn incense then bow and recite, now at bathing one can burn incense, face the king, bow, then recite before bathing; no fault in finishing then bowing and reciting again. When in doubt, follow the more careful way; no harm in complexity.

### On the Spirit

The Most High says: Human life begins with condensed essence and accumulated breath, receiving the fetus and gathering blood, thus condensing bones and emitting fluids, dispersing and flowing liquids; suddenly standing, suddenly formed, suddenly complete, suddenly born.

Human life’s dependence on birth and gestation begins with essence; once essence condenses, yin and yang breath accumulate to form the fetus; then blood pours to form bones; gradually forming human shape; once form is full, spirit also enters, thus able to self-generate.

This subtle transformation of essence cannot be sought by reason; the root of life is none greater than this. Like a bird’s egg, when opened only a drop of liquid remains; as the fetus cell grows, feathers form and develop; whence comes this? Who carves and fashions? It is natural and spontaneous; creation’s mystery is unfathomable.

All things containing black essence not only resemble parents in form and substance, but also in nature, consciousness, will, and intention; thinking of this division of spirit entering the multitude, even to this point. When grown, some change feelings and behavior, like plants’ fruit planted in different soil, color and flavor no longer the same as origin. This is due to casting and dyeing, not to lineage change.

The body has nine spirits entering, five organs mysteriously born; once form is complete, at birth the great gods come to enter, determining lifespan, fortune, and misfortune. One god with nine names, thus called nine spirits.

Parents only know the beginning of birth, unaware of spirits entering the eight spaces. Parents also do not know this is transformation’s birth, nor understand spirits’ nature. Spirits themselves do not know, much less humans.

The human body has honored spirits, dwelling without fixed place, moving and flowing primordial fluids. These spirits come from outside, internally gathered to establish the body; unlike the three souls and seven corporeal spirits, which accumulate spirit and receive breath, born of parents.

Soul and spirit arise from parents’ fluids, transformed and connected to form. Yang clarity forms the soul; yin impurity forms the corporeal spirit; not relying on external things.

As for the great gods, they are appointed by the Lord of Fate, matched with mysterious essence; formerly remnants of broken tombs, now poured into this fetus to become human; called the prior body.

Now my body’s soul and spirit are parents’ divided spirits; form and bone made by Five Phases; hundred gods crafted by heavenly spirits; wisdom and desire governed by breath; lifespan, birth and death, wealth and rank, fortune and misfortune, sins and virtues, and reincarnation in five paths—all depend on this one great god. Everyone has it but none can know it.

The honored spirits have nine names, called Nine True Lords, dividing and transforming up and down, changing into myriad paths. If you can cultivate them, you can pass through water and fire; five organs spontaneously produce flowers; not stuck in one place, thus able to transform endlessly. If kept long and not separated, their place is constant; only awaiting return to reveal, thus transforming and returning to truth.

Fasting and seclusion preserve truth. Dao fasting means guarding stillness; Buddhist fasting means indulging in dawn. Dao stillness places hands on knees; Buddhist dawn places hands on ◇》刖. This clarifies fasting’s meaning.

Hands joined in stillness and observation make all gods clear; palms joined in meditation make body and form complete; this is Dao and Buddha’s true attainment, the correct path of two fastings.

Buddha’s Dao is one method of Dao; forgetting form and guarding spirit is also the utmost subtlety. Meditation at dawn is now called Chan contemplation.

The Jade Emperor remains in Qin; mysterious essence with form; Southern Peak Red Lord changes with teaching. The realms of the various directions, half who serve them; disciples of the Three Truths, two schools similar; this is internal and external arts, methods differing; not due to Hua and Rong separation, nor essence and crude difference.

Border countries are rough and bold, so should use broad scriptures; central China is soft and subtle, so follow its profound mysteries.

---

### One Heart

The first true method: at dawn the great god is in the heart, called Heavenly Essence Lord. The great god is still the great god; the original position of spirit, thus called great. The great god dwells in the chamber; now beginning to transform essence, coming to the heart; hence starting from the first.

On ordinary days, dawn varies with day length, no fixed name; thus cannot say the hour of Yin; Mao hour is not preserved; so choose between these two hours. The facing direction depends on the Ascending Mystery separate formula; the month chosen according to its meaning.

Place hands on knees, close breath, close eyes, look inward; face south at noon, sit upright; place hands on knees, close eyes one breath; preserve spirit, exhale all; close nine breaths; spirit shines ninefold; then open breath, tap throat and swallow saliva with incantation. Exhalation and closing should be slow and subtle; later all the same.

Preserve Heavenly Essence Lord seated in heart, spirit above and below, dressed in vermilion robes, crown of red essence lotus, left wearing spirit book, right wearing tiger pattern, as incantation says. All great gods transform nine times, appearance like newborn infants, ◇◇◇□ sitting facing outward, no fixed length or size. The seat’s ◇◇◇◇ cavity, though not fully empty, even in solid form can appear as if empty, so no sense of lack.

The藏府’s locations high and low are all recorded in the twenty-four gods, no need to reveal further. The great god sits facing the chamber at the hour of Zi; at Chou hour not preserved; still should remain till now; at Yin hour suddenly enters the heart; when preserving heart, no longer think of original place, just see it.

Later all the same. Let the great god ◇ emit purple light, circling ninefold outside the heart. The purple beam is now purple flower color. Circling ninefold is like restraining the corporeal spirit’s white crown body ninefold, each making one layer.

At first exhale breath, only near outside; later gradually each leaf divides left and right, passing crown; exhale nine gentle breaths to ninefold, each interval unrelated, only like the chicken egg’s inner shell, making a circle, feeling nine armies.

Seeing heart and spirit dwelling in the beam, dimly shining. Later all follow this.

Afterward tap teeth nine times, swallow saliva nine times; these eight acts tap and swallow nine times, all matching ninefold beam, so not each according to藏’s number.

Incantation softly: “Heavenly Essence Great Lord, come see the heart, body clad in vermilion robes, head wrapped in red crown, left wearing spirit book, right wearing tiger pattern, ◇ exhaling purple blossoms, nourishing heart and condensing soul, red藏 self-born, attaining flying immortal.” Five rhythms. Then open eyes.

---

### Two Bones

The second true method: at Chen hour the great god’s form divides and dwells in bones, called Firm Jade Lord. Since form divides entirely in bones, every bone has a god, number unknown; their forms and attire all the same.

At Chen hour, place hands on knees, close breath, close eyes, look inward; preserve Firm Jade Lord entering all hundred bones; previously at Mao hour not preserved, so still in heart.

Now face west, preserve spirit, dressed in white robes, lotus crown; left wearing dragon book, right wearing golden truth. Begin at head bones, then preserve each in turn, opening marrow and joints, making them all permeated, every bone having one.

After finishing, also preserve all bone marrow, feeling gods Q使◇ emit white and black, exhaling to circle bones ninefold. The white beam is now white jade color. Preserve thinking of all bones, making each exhale black to circle bone exterior.

Afterward preserve all tendons and bones outside, size according to form, encircling up and down, all ninefold. Though bones vary in length, each follows its joints and segments, not connected as one body head to tail.

Finished, tap teeth nine times, swallow saliva nine times; incantation: “Jade Firm Great Lord, enter bones, body clad in plain robes, head wrapped in white crown, left wearing dragon book, right wearing golden truth, ◇ exhaling white blossoms, strengthening bones and condensing tendons, white bones undying, tendons not perishing, hundred joints producing flowers, making me flying immortal.” Five rhythms. Then open eyes.

Note the first two names both say Firm Jade; this incantation says Jade Firm, perhaps an error, but repeated thus, still same category. Also preserved as “at” is an error.

---

### Three Blood Vessels

The third true method: at Si hour the great god’s form divides and flows into all essence and blood, called Primordial Life Lord. This too divides and scatters, all with form and attire alike; only essence and blood mentioned, taking the outline.

At Si hour, place hands on knees, close breath, close eyes, look inward; preserve Primordial Life Lord roaming all blood vessels and essence liquids; blood vessels and essence liquids have no holes, so cannot say entering seat, only roaming.

Face Wei direction, preserve spirit, dressed in yellow robes, purple lotus crown; left wearing tiger register, right wearing dragon book. Preserve form dividing and scattering, all entering these four places; blood, essence, and liquids all dispersed and flowing; only vessels are inner breath and blood’s path, connected to essence liquids and spleen, no palace but most tangible, able to have breath circling, so make entwined.

Make ◇ exhale yellow breath, entwining vessel exterior ninefold. The yellow beam is now female yellow. Since breath and blood essence all pass through vessels, vessels have holes; each god exhales blossoms to entwine outside, branches and strands according to size, all ninefold; cannot be unified as one.

Gods each exhale blossoms outside, so not said to circle but to entwine; this means blossoms first entwine inward, then successively outside. Vessels unlike bones have limited joints; now follow bright hall flow, taking twelve meridians plus Ren and Du meridians and spleen network, total fifteen meridians as start and end.

Finished, tap teeth nine times, swallow saliva nine times; incantation: “Primordial Life Great Lord, pouring through blood body, body clad in yellow robes, head wrapped in purple lotus, left wearing tiger register, right wearing dragon book, ◇ exhaling yellow fluids, strengthening blood and filling void, essence full and liquid overflowing, nine spirits all present, making me flying immortal, Heaven and Earth in accord.” Five rhythms. Then open eyes.

---

### Four Liver

The fourth true method: at Wu hour the great god dwells in the liver, called Azure Bright Lord. At Wu hour, place hands on knees, close breath, close eyes, look inward; preserve Azure Bright Lord entering liver; face Yin direction, preserve spirit, dressed in azure robes, crown of emerald, left wearing tiger badge, right wearing dragon pattern.

Among five organs, only the heart has a large hole; others are small; enter and sit inside, need not enter each hole, but penetrate solidly. Organs vary in size; liver and lungs are large, leaves many; exhale black all around.

Make ◇ exhale azure smoke, circling liver ninefold. The azure mat is now sky blue. Afterwards circling organs all arise outside then inside, counting finished.

Tap teeth nine times, swallow saliva nine times; incantation: “Azure Bright Great Lord, come enter my liver, body clad in azure robes, head wrapped in emerald crown, left wearing tiger badge, right wearing dragon pattern, ◇ exhaling azure smoke, nourishing liver and guiding spirit, azure藏 self-born, ascending to heavenly immortal, Great One guarding essence, embracing corporeal spirit and checking soul.” Six rhythms. Then open eyes.

---

### Five Spleen

The fifth true method: at Wei hour the great god dwells in the spleen, called Nourishing Light Lord. At Wei hour, place hands on knees, close breath, close eyes, look inward; preserve Nourishing Light Lord entering spleen; face Chen direction, preserve spirit, dressed in green robes, lotus crown, left wearing jade bell, right wearing mighty god.

Make ◇ exhale green-black, circling spleen ninefold. The green-black is now green-blue.

Finished, tap teeth nine times, swallow saliva nine times; incantation: “Nourishing Light Great God, come enter spleen, body clad in green robes, head wrapped in lotus crown, left wearing jade bell, right wearing mighty god, ◇ exhaling green blossoms, nourishing spleen and pouring spirit, yellow藏 self-born, ascending to perfected.” Five rhythms. Then open eyes.

---

### Six Lungs

The sixth true method: at Shen hour the great god dwells in lungs, called White Origin Lord. At Shen hour, place hands on knees, close breath, close eyes, look inward; preserve White Origin Lord entering lungs; face Shen direction, preserve spirit, dressed in dragon pattern robes, crown of yellow morning light, left holding mysterious book, right wearing tiger pattern.

Left hand holds imperial register, right hand holds spirit chapter. Make ◇ exhale five-colored breath, circling lungs ninefold. The five colors are azure, red, white, black, yellow, all emitted together with one exhale.

Finished, tap teeth nine times, swallow saliva nine times; incantation: “White Origin Great Lord, come sit in lungs, body clad in dragon robes, yellow morning light crown, left holding imperial register, right holding spirit chapter, left wearing mysterious book, right wearing tiger pattern, ◇ exhaling five breaths, regulating lungs and harmonizing fluids, white藏 self-born, flying immortal purple gate.” Six rhythms. Then open eyes.

---

### Seven Kidneys

The seventh true method: at You hour the great god divides and dwells, scattered form in both kidneys, called Mysterious Yang Lord. Kidneys are two; spirit divides into two forms.

At You hour, place hands on knees, close breath, close eyes, look inward; preserve Mysterious Yang Lord’s form entering both kidneys; face Zi direction, preserve spirit, dressed in purple robes, crown of supporting morning light, left wearing dragon talisman, right wearing phoenix pattern, each in one kidney facing each other.

This “entering form” character should be “dividing form”; at time of writing this scripture, still used “enter,” later forgotten to correct. Make ◇ exhale warehouse breath, circling kidneys ninefold. The warehouse heat is now pale blue water color. Each spirit exhales breath, each circling one kidney.

Finished, tap teeth nine times, swallow saliva nine times; incantation: “Mysterious Yang Great Lord, enter and sit in kidneys, body clad in purple robes, head wrapped in supporting morning crown, left wearing dragon talisman, right wearing phoenix pattern, ◇ exhaling warehouse blossoms, pouring kidney spiritual root, black藏 self-born, body flying immortal, ascending north to Mysterious Gate, roaming heavenly passes.” Six rhythms. Then open eyes.

---

### Eight Gallbladder

The eighth true method: at Xu and Hai hours the great god dwells in gallbladder, called Harmonious Bright Lord. Xu and Hai hours used here as dusk time. Day length varies, so two hours appear; if long day, use Xu hour; short day, use Hai hour; in second and eighth months between Xu and Hai.

Previously dawn used Yin and Mao hours similarly; perfected secret can do so. Place hands on knees, close breath, close eyes, look inward; preserve Harmonious Bright Lord entering gallbladder; face Mao direction, preserve spirit, dressed in green brocade robes, crown of purple lotus, left wearing spirit light, right wearing jade truth.

Make ◇ exhale five-colored breath, circling gallbladder ninefold.

Finished, tap teeth nine times, swallow saliva nine times; incantation: “Harmonious Bright Great God, come sit in gallbladder, body clad in brocade robes, head wearing purple crown, left wearing spirit light, right wearing jade truth, ◇ exhaling five blossoms, nourishing gallbladder and strengthening spirit, harmonizing essence, treasure blood, regulating fluids and strengthening body, making me ascend, attaining flying immortal.” Six rhythms. Then open eyes.

---

### Nine Head

The ninth true method: at Zi hour the great god dwells in head chamber, called No Hero Lord. No Hero Lord is originally the chamber’s left god; this name is a title, body merging and transforming, returning to truth. When in lungs called White Origin, also chamber’s right White Origin Lord; though separated and united differently, actually one god.

At Zi hour, sit upright, place hands on knees, close breath, close eyes, look inward; since midnight, fearing one lying down preserving, so uniquely said to sit upright, also to clarify true god’s original place. Face Chou direction; preserve No Hero Lord sitting in bright hall inside chamber; spirit wears phoenix patterned cloak, dragon patterned robe below, with five-colored embroidered patterns, purple collar, blue belt, crown of supporting morning light, left wearing jade brilliance, right wearing tiger pattern, holding golden essence, shining bright, near chamber’s left, facing outward.

Make ◇ exhale purple breath, circling head ninefold. The head’s empty interior is the chamber’s city; now spirit dwells in main room, exhaling blossoms passing through nine palaces; nine palaces all related, like Three Ones imagining method. Its attire, tongue, and teeth are separately in front and below, so again encircle them.

After ninefold finished, again exhale purple breath, circling both eyes inside and outside ninefold. Preserve exhaling purple light from bright hall inside, making it encircle both eyes; outer ninefold appears outside eyes. Make spirit elsewhere exhale black to circle them, like previous meridian method; first from inside then outside. Tongue and teeth likewise.

Ninefold finished, again exhale purple breath, circling tongue ninefold. Preserve exhale breath from Mud Pellet Palace lower orifice, entering throat, passing tongue base, unnoticed difficulty. Ninefold finished, again exhale purple breath, circling teeth ninefold. After circling tongue, again exhale, passing downward, emerging on tongue, encircling teeth above and below, making a circle.

Only not circling ears and nose, since ear and nose holes connect to brain, already included in breath; unlike eyes, teeth, and tongue, each with separate region. Finished; total thirty-six circles, making a circle. Not thirty-six layers, but four places combined thirty-six.

This explanation clarifies the later tapping and swallowing count. If one cannot close breath for thirty-six breaths, can do nine breaths in one place, then open, then close again, dividing into four closures.

Tap teeth thirty-six times, swallow saliva thirty-six times; incantation: “No Hero Great Lord, supreme god of three primordials, guarding chamber, palace in Mud Pellet, yellow gate golden chamber, transforming into nine truths, dragon robe phoenix cloak, purple, emerald, and blue edges, holding true essence, head wrapped in splendid crown, left wearing jade brilliance, right wearing tiger pattern, sitting below sun and moon, ◇ exhaling purple smoke, circling breath teeth and tongue, pouring to eyes and lips, exiting elixir entering void, calling corporeal spirits summoning souls, condensing essence and firming fetus, six harmonies long joy, ascending to Great Purity, attaining supplement true official.” Eleven rhythms. Then open eyes.

---

The above completes the Nine Truths and Eight Paths. Then the Mud Pellet is sealed and guarded, eyes fully clear, five organs spontaneously born, blood vessels preserving fluids. No Hero always guards the chamber; the four and nine breaths entwine and secure the head and face, also surrounding藏府, encircling bones and vessels, thus always preserving life and completeness.

When a person wishes to perish, first the five organs are damaged and wasted, blood vessels dry and congeal, brain palace empties and ceases, seven orifices darken and close; then eyes scatter and collapse, essence and light fall, spirit departs and breath exhausts; then death.

Now the Nine Truths constantly dwell and guard, all prior weariness never becoming weariness; how could death come naturally?

If the spirit enters Great Yin, body passes through Three Officials, then Nine Truths summon spirits, Great One guards corpse, Three Primordials protect springs, Most High captures soul, bones and flesh undying, five organs not perishing, able to die and live, yin and yang, exiting void and entering non-being, Heaven and Earth co-birth—this is the Daoist’s essence and stillness cultivating form, sensing and summoning the Nine Truths’ response.

The Three Primordials fly essence in fullness and emptiness; the Great One embraces my corpse and reverses substance; subtle and profound! If mysterious vigor depends on fate, practicing Three Officials, perhaps needing to refine substance and change appearance to enter Great Yin, when reporting is complete, also no different from the world; after burial, still like living people, though many years pass, skin and bones fresh; Most High captures soul, not letting Deng and Dai hold long; great gods summon spirits, not allowing wild ghosts; Three Officials truly love and protect breath, not letting it cease; Great One leads and guards form, preventing decay; when time and fate allow life, suddenly standing, entering and exiting with gods without form, no longer using coffin or tomb; then following one’s recorded fate, going to officials—all because of preserving and cultivating this Dao.

The five stones filling life mutually assist; if only taking their medicine without practicing the Nine Truths, only five organs can be born, but flesh and blood vanish. This preservation of truth causes undying, differing from corpse liberation immortals.

Now ordinary people have buried love for years, yet form and substance not destroyed; sometimes due to time and month, sometimes due to gold and jade in the body; all not responses of spirit guards. Also some survive due to fate; this only means calculation not ended; great gods still guard soul and spirit; all other gods have scattered; when time to live comes, they summon each other; though restored as humans, not from cultivation and preservation, cannot be one with gods, entering and exiting without form.

---

### Using Breath

Closing breath makes ultimate breath; exhaling breath makes subtle and wondrous; entering void and exiting non-being, making continuous without awareness. The Nine Truths close black without breath count, only within closing one blossom; preserving thought completed, because matters are few.

Now this again says exhale swallow makes subtle, seeming unlimited closing, only making exhale and closing not perceived as breathing difference.

If only like Eight Truths, one closing suffices; the ninth must circle four places; fearing escape, so made four closures preserving it.

All cultivation has closing breath; only this scroll details its method, preserving spirit and exhaling firewood, circulating藏府, flowing and moving, connecting with human breath, thus must be subtle, not causing fright, trembling, or panting.

Once breath closed, then circulate, easily causing rushing and bursting; only in slow and gentle can it be good.

This method can also be used for all scriptures’ regulation, not only Nine Truths.

---

### Separate Days

The *Ninth Truth Middle Scripture* is practiced among humans, also has ◇ formula; this text seems secret and not written; now please explain.

This formula comes after *Ascending Mystery Record*, likely after scripture division; Azure Youth Lord speaks it; wishing to clarify the meaning of Ascending Mystery’s use of days, so first speaks of the Nine Truth.

Among humans, constant practice is difficult, and cannot always find leisure; thus clarifying auspicious days, giving rules.

First true method: use fifth day of fifth month, fifteenth, twenty-fifth, twenty-seventh, twenty-ninth; five times a month, all at dawn. Heart king in fire, so especially May Wu.

Second true method: use eighth day of eighth month, eleventh, fourteenth, nineteenth, twenty-third, twenty-seventh; six times a month, all at Chen hour. Bone white metal breath, so especially August You.

Third true method: use sixth day of sixth month, seventh, seventeenth, eighteenth, twenty-fifth, twenty-sixth; six times a month, all at Si hour. Blood vessels and essence all receiving earth breath, so especially late June.

Fourth true method: use second day of first month, eighth, fourteenth, eighteenth, nineteenth, twenty-eighth; six times a month, all at Wu hour. Liver king in wood, so especially first month Yin.

Fifth true method: use third day of third month, eighth, thirteenth, twentieth, twenty-sixth; five times a month, all at Wei hour. Spleen king in earth, so especially third month Chen.

Sixth true method: use seventh day of seventh month, eleventh, fourteenth, eighteenth, twenty-third, twenty-fifth, twenty-eighth; seven times a month, all at Shen hour. Lung king in metal, so especially seventh month Shen. This lung metal and liver wood, taking two Meng.

Seventh true method: use second day of eleventh month, sixth, ninth, thirteenth, sixteenth, nineteenth, twenty-third, twenty-seventh; eight times a month, all at Shen or You hour. Kidney king in water, so especially eleventh month Zi. This heart fire kidney water, taking two Zhong. This scripture only uses You hour; lungs already use Shen, so overlapping not proper.

Eighth true method: use second day of second month, seventh, ninth, fifteenth, eighteenth, nineteenth, twenty-seventh; seven times a month, all at Xu or Hai hour. Gallbladder deputy liver wood breath, so especially second month Mao. This gallbladder wood bone metal, again taking two Zhong.

Ninth true method: use third day of twelfth month, ninth, seventeenth, nineteenth, twenty-sixth, twenty-ninth; six times a month, all at Zi hour midnight. One year complete, returning to origin, so use twelfth month Chou.

This completes the *Ninth Truth Middle Scripture* ◇ formula. These months and days are all combined truth returning order, life breath gathering essence time; good for preservation and thought, easily causing mysterious response.

Those cultivating truth matters should practice constantly; important is that the month also has auspicious days; like Purple Script wearing sun and moon, also selecting good and wondrous days, as human methods; other days assist mutually.

If dwelling high in remote mountains, hidden in clouds and rocks, severing human affairs inside and out, cutting grain food to clear intestines, placing hands properly, uniting with dawn, should practice daily, as original scripture says.

What is written now is because humans have many affairs, no leisure to practice. Discussing great gods one day, constantly moving nine mansions, preserving incantations for benefit; without preservation, no different from common people, like three families.

Now if following this formula, one year fully traverses nine gods; each god gets several times preservation and incantation; compared to sun and moon souls, greatly saving time and effort. Yet constant practice in one day leaves almost no gap, relying on few affairs.

The chief recorder says Nine Truths require utmost stillness, also surprised at its many times. Thus the list says practicing Nine Truths increases merit. Practicing fourteen years, also surpasses floating void, able to die and live, pass water and fire, ascend Upper Purity, five organs produce flowers, leaning on Heaven. All nurturing five organs, governing body and spirit, none better than Nine Truths; other methods are branches and twigs.

### Eight Paths Central Yellow Elder Lord’s Eight Paths Secret Words

The Dao has eight paths, their words high and secret.

In a quiet room, mind at ease, spacious and true, thoughts wandering wondrously, observing marvels, the mysterious person soars and bathes. If sincerely sensing the upper meeting, essence and understanding illuminate dawn.

If one can quiet the heart in a secluded room, imagining high void, wondrously observing rosy clouds, sincerely marking communication, pouring essence to understand, then the void and mystery can be seen, true radiance mirrors connect.

If one is restless and stuck in the middle chest, lustful and competitive lingering in spirit’s dwelling, though jade chariots descend, green canopies and ornate carriages, none will see it.

One will see elixir breath of cinnabar, three pure flying clouds, eight chariots vermilion palanquins, purple rosy jade wheels, Upper Purity floating glimpses, circling transforming Three Primordials, High Emperor holding the festival, spirit youths climbing the chariot, Great Primordial holding canopy, Southern Pole approaching the pavilion; then the vast light shines outside, veiling the azure dragon face, resembling candles in the great void, flowing and drifting seven views.

True spirits roam freely, riding the void boat, ascending and descending, collecting and taxing, entering and exiting without form—this is the mysterious inspection of those with will, those embracing the Dao.

Then they gather radiance, shining splendid clouds, gazing at the great void, condensing brilliance looking down, causing the enlightened to look up to the heavenly edge, the beholders afar to envy the smoke’s end.

Though true words surpass themselves, flying collar meeting afar, suddenly able thus, will turn the dragon’s plow to welcome them.

If you can see it, then by day ascend the stars, no need to condense frost and wash blossoms, mysterious fat golden elixir.

The mysterious vigor is lofty and distant, upright and true, no need to seek cinnabar and stone resources, laboring by furnace and stove, even with ninefold refining, filling life’s golden liquid, no longer esteemed.

---

### First Section Morning

The first path secret words say: On the eight festival days, at clear dawn, look north; clear dawn is early morning before sunrise; if the festival day coincides with Wu or Ji days, after clear dawn, also look according to the day’s direction; if another day, look again.

If purple, green, and white clouds appear, these three colors appear in sequence, purple on top. Clouds should fly from below upward, or arranged horizontally, fluttering. This is the Three One Wu Lord’s Three Pure Flying Clouds.

At this time, the Three Primordial Lords ride eight chariots’ wheels, ascending to the Heavenly Emperor. The Three Primordial Lords are the Great Primordial Three Primordial Lords, female perfected. The Heavenly Emperor is the Heavenly Emperor Jade Clarity Lord.

When seeing the hour, bow twice, then state petition, requesting to serve the chariot valley’s incantation, ascending to the Heavenly Emperor, thus bowing respectfully.

If the procession is slow and wandering, not immediately dispersing, then follow the stated method; fearing one cannot say more.

Other days all follow this, each according to the true vision and chariot destination, changing the words.

One to three seeing the Primordial Lords’ chariots means ascending immortals by day. The word “chariot” now said as “carriage,” carriage and chariot are similar, interchangeable.

Once seeing clouds, detailed viewing of chariots; even if not seeing chariot’s attire, still bow and petition as before; fearing only seeing clouds, not necessarily gaining immortality.

All these various times differ; true high ones see less and ascend easily; lesser immortals see more and ascend with difficulty.

---

### Second Section Night

The second path secret words say: On the eight festival days at midnight, facing north, if dark blue and yellow clouds appear, it is the Supreme Subtlety Heavenly Emperor Lord riding eight scene chariots, ascending to the High Jade Mound.

Seeing the Heavenly Emperor’s chariot four times means by day seeing dragon carriages welcoming and ascending.

---

### Third Wu and Ji Days

The third path secret words say: On the Jiazi first ten days, Wu and Ji days, at clear dawn look northwest; later said to be the month’s first ten days Jiazi.

Other Jia days follow this; Wu and Ji two days both to be observed. Clear dawn is late dawn, earlier than ordinary dawn.

If purple, blue, and yellow clouds appear, these are the Great Ultimate True Lord and Perfected One’s Three Pure Clouds.

At this time, Great Ultimate True Lord and Great Ultimate Perfected One ride mysterious green chariots, ascending this purple palace? Nine times seeing Great Ultimate chariots means ascending immortals by day.

---

### Fourth Wu Yin and Ji Mao

The fourth path secret words say: On the Jiaxu first ten days, Wu Yin and Ji Mao days, at clear dawn look southeast; red, white, and blue clouds appear, these are Fusang Great Emperor Lord’s Three Pure Clouds.

At this time Fusang Great Emperor Lord rides bright eight path carriages, ascending Supreme Subtlety Palace. Seeing seven times means by day clouds and dragons welcome and ascend.

---

### Fifth Wu Zi and Ji Chou

The fifth path secret words say: On the Jiashen first ten days, Wu Zi and Ji Chou days, at clear dawn look due west; white, red, and purple clouds appear, these are Great Primordial Perfected White Emperor Lord’s Three Pure Clouds.

At this time Great Primordial Perfected White Emperor Lord rides refined jade carriage, ascending Jade Heaven Mysterious Emperor Supreme Perfected. Seeing fourteen times means by day seeing gods and immortals.

---

### Sixth Wu Xu and Ji Hai

The sixth path secret words say: On the Jiawu first ten days, Wu Xu and Ji Hai days, at clear dawn look due south; blue, red, and yellow clouds appear, these are Southern Pole Perfected Red Emperor Lord’s Three Pure Clouds.

At this time Southern Pole Perfected Red Emperor Lord rides crimson and blue carriage, ascending Interwind Platform. Seeing ten times means by day ascending immortals.

---

### Seventh Wu Shen and Ji You

The seventh path secret words say: On the Jiachen first ten days, Wu Shen and Ji You days, at clear dawn look southwest; green, purple, and blue clouds appear, these are Supreme Purity Perfected One’s Three Pure Clouds.

At this time Supreme Purity Perfected One rides mysterious green eight light cinnabar carriage, ascending High Supreme Heavenly Emperor Lord. Seeing four times means Great One comes to welcome, ascending by day.

---

### Eighth Wu Wu and Ji Wei

The eighth path secret words say: On the Jiayin first ten days, Wu Wu and Ji Wei days, at clear dawn look east; vermilion, jade, and yellow clouds appear, these are Great Void Perfected One’s Three Pure Clouds.

This “脱” character means time; Great Void Perfected One rides wandering jade carriage, ascending Supreme Subtlety Heavenly Emperor Lord. Seeing fifteen times means by day ascending immortals.

All these true titles, ranks, and destinations have indications, but not detailed here as not practical.

---

Those seeing these should bow twice, stating the method above; all follow the first path’s method. The Three Pure Clouds each have their own color, colors bright stacking one above another as said. If on eight festival days seeing the Three Primordial Three Pure Clouds, then purple cloud on top, green next, white below, overlapping.

Be careful to observe. Though same day three pure clouds, colors stacked differently, as said. These “pure” are not white pure, but cloud position names. Thus Three Pure Lords also named purple, yellow, white; these clouds are their origin.

When observing these clouds’ three colors and directions, they must always correspond, not seeing these clouds in the wrong direction. Be careful to watch.

“First ten days” means the first ten days of the month; if Jiazi day is within ten days, it is first ten days. Other days follow Jiazi. Now Jia is five days from Wu; if within ten days of month has Jia, still first ten days, regardless of Wu and Ji entering mid-month; if within ten days has Wu or Ji, better.

---

### Other Days

If not their day or hour, but see these clouds, also bow and recite; then triple the times of seeing on their day. Meaning other ten days’ Wu or Ji, or not Wu or Ji day, or not eight festival, or not clear dawn or midnight; if direction uncertain but cloud color correct, then know which truth, where traveling, then bow and petition as before.

Since not proper ascending or descending day, the number of sightings must accumulate to cause response. If limited to three sightings, then twelve times to become immortal.
