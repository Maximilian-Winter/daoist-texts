## Secret Method of Cultivation within the Purple Court

Anyone who cultivates the dao seeking longevity and immortality must preserve the Three Primal Spirits and the Three Primal Palaces where they reside.

The Upper Primal Palace of the Mud Pellet lies three cun above the space between the eyebrows. At the second cun, carve out a square one cun wide—this is the Palace of the Elixir Field. Preserve its spirit, named the Red Child, styled Guangyuanxian, also called Emperor Minister, dressed in vermilion robes. Visualize this spirit within the palace and call its name three times.

The Middle Primal Crimson Chamber is the heart itself. One cun square within the heart is the Crimson Palace. Preserve its spirit inside, also clad in crimson robes, named the Perfected One, styled Zidan Guangjian. Call its name three times.

The Lower Primal Elixir Field Palace lies three cun below the navel, entering inward three cun beneath the navel. Preserve its spirit within, dressed in yellow robes, face white as a newborn infant, named Yuanyang, styled Guxuan. Call its name three times.

After swallowing the breath twenty-four times, call upon the Great Lord of the Birth Palace. The Life Gate is at the navel; the Mysterious Gateway is the passage where the embryonic intestines begin to form. Within it is the Birth Palace, one cun inside the navel. Within this palace dwells the Great Lord, named Taokang, styled Hejingyan, dressed in vermilion robes, wearing a purple lotus crown, seated at the Life Gate. The Three Souls stand attending on the left side. The Great Lord holds the talismanic emblem of the Heavenly Sovereign, grasping it with both hands according to the characters, to harmonize and concentrate the primordial qi, nurturing the embryo and reversing the womb. At dusk, before lying down, first preserve the Three Palaces, then sit and hold firmly, closing the eyes to look inward. First hold the breath for twenty-four counts, then visualize the Great Lord sitting outward, appearing like an infant, crowned and robed, holding the talisman clearly. Then call the Great Lord’s name three times in the heart: “Mysterious Gateway, Great Lord of the Birth Palace, named Taokang, styled Hejingyan.”

Swallow saliva fifty times, knock the teeth three times through, and softly recite:

> Spirit of the Embryo, Great Deity, Heavenly Sovereign of the Imperial Thread,  
> Holding the womb talisman, head wrapped in purple crown,  
> Yellow cycles turning red, essence above the Life Gate,  
> Transforming spirit, reversing birth,  
> Harmonizing the Six Directions,  
> Body radiant and lustrous,  
> Jade Maiden resting within.

Only when this incantation is properly closed and sealed can the binding method be effective. If one can practice this continuously for eighteen years, with a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, one will ascend to Heaven in broad daylight.

The talismanic emblem of the Supreme Emperor of the Great Dao appears as follows:

The talisman of the Heavenly Sovereign is entrusted to the Great Deity Taokang of the Birth Palace, styled Hejingyan, to harmonize the primordial upper qi, regulate the embryo, and circulate essence. Written in vermilion on blue paper, finely inscribed on the days of the new moon and full moon at midnight, facing north when worn. Hold the talisman in the right hand, hold the breath, face north, burn incense, and complete the inscription. Cut it into pieces in order and layer them, holding them while closing the eyes and breath, visualizing the Great Lord as before. Then mentally recite:

> Heavenly Emperor’s mysterious script, imperial emblem and numinous talisman,  
> Harmonizing primordial qi, circulating essence to reverse the womb,  
> Ten thousand years as an infant, soaring immortal at the Celestial Pivot,  
> Great Deity of the Birth Palace, unveiling the script and setting vermilion,  
> Wearing the purple crown, conspiring with me.

Afterward, rise and bow twice, then roll each talisman into a pill and swallow it. Preserve the Great Lord, holding the talisman in the left hand while wearing it, then face north and bow to the Supreme Heavenly Sovereign. The scripture says: preserving the Great Lord’s talisman and wearing it for eighteen years enables the Great Lord to stimulate the three fields on the left and govern the three qi on the right. The fields transform into flying chariots, the qi into mysterious dragons, commanding the twenty-four spirits above and controlling the souls below. Calling upon the Six Yang Officials and summoning the Six Yin Officers, with a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, one ascends to Heaven in broad daylight—all through the grace of Lord Tao. Though this dao is small, it is worthy of observation. The Great Deity of the Birth Palace cautions to be careful of menstrual blood and impurities, burning the hair of six domestic animals and the whiskers of the Hu Ying plant. These all attack the chaotic embryonic qi and thus harm the infant spirit.

The Three Souls leave the human body thrice each month—on the third, thirteenth, and twenty-third days. During these times, the spirits wander, dreams become unreal, and evil qi seeks to invade. At such times, one must still bind and restrain them. The method is to lie down facing upward, stretch both legs long, and place both hands heavily over the heart, left hand on top. Knock the teeth three times through, swallow the breath three times, close the eyes and visualize a single red qi flickering within the heart, shining like a chicken’s egg. It rises from the heart, splitting and emerging from both eyes, gradually expanding to encircle the entire body, reaching down to the feet and up to the head. It transforms into a great fire, burning and refining the body, resembling glowing charcoal. Suddenly, a gentle warmth is felt throughout the limbs. Knock the teeth three times again, and call the names of the Three Souls: Shuangling, Taiguang, Youjing. The three spirits hasten to their posts: Shuangling at the Mysterious Gateway, attending the Great Lord on the left, guarding the corporeal soul; Taiguang in the Cavern Chamber, facing the Yellow Lord Laozi’s Red Child, guarding the Mud Pellet; Youjing in the heart, receiving the heart’s command. Each is in its proper place. Call them and then recite the incantation:

> Supreme Mysterious Palace, center yellow turning to blue,  
> Refining the Three Souls within, Taiguang at peace,  
> Spirit treasure jade chamber, born together with me,  
> Do not move recklessly, the witness is most numinous.  
> If you wish to fly, only the Supreme Ultimate and Highest Clarity may grant it.  
> If hunger or thirst arises, only the Returning Water Jade Essence may satisfy.  

When all is complete, forget the body for a long while. First complete all lying-down preservations, then proceed with this practice, falling asleep by holding the breath.

The Seven Po leave the body thrice monthly—on the seventh, seventeenth, and twenty-seventh nights. When the Po depart, sleep becomes restless and dreams confused. Students of the dao must bind them tightly, not allowing the Po to wander. At these times, lying down, place both hands with the index fingers steady at the back of the head pillow, stretch both legs long. Visualize two white qì streams at the nostrils, first emerging from the lungs through both nostrils, as small as beans, gradually growing larger, encircling the body nine times, reaching down to the feet and up to the head. The white qi suddenly transforms into celestial beasts, first changing within: two Azure Dragons in the pupils of the eyes; two White Tigers in the nostrils, all facing outward; Vermilion Bird above the heart, facing the mouth, bowing its head to draw in qi near the lips; Azure Dragon and Tortoise beneath the left foot; Spirit Snake beneath the right foot—together forming the Mysterious Warrior, stepping as if on stilts. Also visualize two Jade Maidens in the ears, dressed in mysterious brocade robes, stationed at the Life Gate, each holding two torches, their light shining to the utmost. The left named Graceful Maiden, the right named Spiritual Ceremony, each transforming through nine layers of qi. After a long time, all is complete. Swallow saliva seven times, knock the teeth seven times through, and call the names of the Seven Po: Corpse Dog, Hidden Arrow, Sparrow Shade, Swallowing Thief, Non-Toxin, Purging Filth, Stinking Lung. First preserve the Seven Po at the Life Gate, standing to the right of the Great Lord, guarded by the First Soul Shuangling, not to move. After calling, softly recite:

> White qi cycles nine times, restraining Po’s evil and malice,  
> Celestial beasts guard the gate, Graceful Maiden holds the pass,  
> Soul and Po harmonize gently, with me in peace,  
> Do not move recklessly, watch the original form.  
> If hungry or thirsty, drink moonlight and sun elixir.

When complete, forget the body for a long while, then fall asleep.

Students of the dao should bow with sincerity, preserving truth and offering thanks. On the day of the Autumnal Equinox, cultivate thoughtfulness, fasting and abstaining from evil thoughts, wishing to ascend as an immortal. Those who fast long should on the Autumnal Equinox thank the Seven Ancestors and Grandparents, then contemplate all their own sins, seeking vows of self-reform. Those not truly severed from worldly dust should be cautious not to use the Autumnal Equinox for confession. This day’s confession frees all without exception, but must not be repeated. If one judges some matters cannot yet be removed, do not force confession. The scripture says: “If one wishes to learn the dao, be cautious on the Autumnal Equinox; all matters great and small are reported above.” At noon on this day, enter a room facing north, burn incense, kneel in long bows, remove the headcloth onto the ground, and softly recite:

> I, a humble perfected one of a certain small shrine in such and such prefecture,  
> Here open to the High Sage Most High Jade Morning Mysterious Sovereign, Most High Dao Lord,  
> Golden Gate of Peace, Jade Morning Mysterious Primordial Supreme Dao Lord,  
> Golden Gate’s Four Assistants and Twenty-Four Perfected Ones, Commanders of Fate and Spirit.  
> First thank the Seven Ancestors and Grandparents, then my whole self,  
> Sincerely bidding farewell, bowing and knocking the forehead, bowing again.  
> First wear the headcloth, then rise and bow again.

If one has auspicious dreams or visions upon waking, rub the eyes twenty-seven times, quickly close the eyes, and rub outward with both palms. Knock the teeth twenty-seven times through, softly recite:

> Most High Supreme Essence, Three Emperor’s Elixir Spirits,  
> Crimson Palace shining bright, auspicious signs informing,  
> Three Primal Gentle Souls, Heavenly Sovereign bestowing scripture,  
> All directions harmonize, flying immortals ascend to Highest Clarity,  
> Always with Jade Truth, gathering within the Purple Court.

If one repeatedly encounters evil dreams, immediately close eyes and breath, pinch the philtrum with the left hand twenty-seven times, then pinch the mountain source point with the second and third fingers, pinch the yin point dozens of times, press urgently, knock teeth twenty-seven times through, hold breath as before, knock teeth again, and softly recite:

> Great Cavern True Mystery, forging the Three Souls,  
> First soul swiftly guards the Seven Po,  
> Second soul swiftly guards the Mud Pellet,  
> Third soul receives heart’s command.  
> Above open to the Most High Three Primal Lords.  
> On such and such day, encountering inauspicious dreams,  
> The Seven Po wander as corpses, colluding with evil sources.  
> Quickly summon Taokang to protect life, report to the Emperor Lord,  
> Five Elders and Nine Perfected Ones guard the body gates,  
> Yellow Gateway Spirit Master, Purple Door General,  
> Holding axe and bell, eliminate evil spirits,  
> Turning misfortune to blessing, life and death without ties.

Upon lying down again, auspicious responses will surely come. Only after three years, by divine response and command, will dreams arise.

Whenever lying down to sleep, quickly close eyes, knock teeth and swallow breath each nine times, then press the nose left and right, up and down dozens of times, and softly recite:

> Most High Four Luminaries, Nine Gates releasing essence,  
> Ears and eyes mysteriously clear, penetrating truth and reaching spirit,  
> Heavenly Central Terrace, flowing qi balanced,  
> Graceful Maiden and Cloud Ceremony, eye pupils bright and clear,  
> Brilliant and penetrating, hundredfold subtle and pure,  
> Protecting and harmonizing the Upper Origin,  
> Wandering the Nine Cities, Five Viscera rooted,  
> Ears and eyes self-arising, Heavenly Terrace lush and pure,  
> Pillars and beams unshaken, Seven Po bathed and refined,  
> Three Souls at peace, Red Child carrying radiance,  
> Always with me together, covering my ears and eyes,  
> Most High before me, shattering with flowing bells,  
> Ten thousand evils vanish, wishes surely fulfilled,  
> Sun and moon guard the gates, heart stores the Five Stars,  
> True Emperor’s blessing, all sounds respectfully heard,  
> Auspicious with mysterious response, good omens made clear.

After the blessing, swallow saliva nine times, rub face and eyes until a slight warmth arises. Always perform this blessing upon waking, never missing a single sleep. It sharpens ears and eyes, strengthens memory and clarity, balances the nose, prevents saliva loss, preserves a youthful face, controls souls and refines Po, repelling a thousand evils and banishing ten thousand demons.

When combing hair, one should face the direction of the kingly place, avoiding combing facing north. In the eleventh month, it is best to comb facing the directions Chen and Hai. After the initial combing, recite:

> Supreme Emperor disperses spirits, Five Elders return to truth,  
> Mud Pellet’s mysterious radiance, preserving essence long-lasting,  
> Left is the sun’s concealment, right the moon’s root,  
> Six Directions purified and refined, a hundred spirits receiving grace.

Afterward, swallow saliva three times. Count the combings carefully without causing pain, so blood does not stagnate and roots remain strong.

When taking immortality medicines, always take them on one’s birth day. Do not mix with death, mourning, or misfortune, lest one harm the embryonic spirit and gain no benefit.

Before eating, do not speak of death or expose food, lest many evil qi come.

When bathing, always preserve the Six Officers, ensuring all wishes are fulfilled. Usually, preserve within sixty days the Officer Days, bathing as usual. On the day of Jiazi, always bathe; if not, wait until the next new moon for spiritual clarity. This is considered rare indeed—only the first and fifth months. Use eastern flowing water to make fragrant bathwater; a pagoda need not be used often. But do not bathe the ears, lest the corpse’s stench be stirred and true qi lost. Beware of sitting in the bath to dissolve the form, or sitting in water.

If stepping on filth or other unclean places, one must bathe and dissolve the form to remove it. The method uses ten liang of fresh bamboo leaves and four liang of peach skin, boiled in one hu of clear water until boiling. Cool to warm and bathe with it—ten thousand filths vanish.

The Northern Emperor’s method of killing ghosts: close the eyes and hold firmly, hold the breath and visualize the true spirits of the five viscera, that is, the spirits of the five organs. Seeing the five viscera, the response is divine; they may also be called the Four Spirits and the Yellow Dragon. First knock teeth thirty-six times through, then recite:

> Heavenly Peng, Heavenly Peng, yun yun...

In the world, there are low-level evil ghosts, often appearing as women to confuse and test people, but they can also transform into men’s shapes, not only women. If one sees such, immediately close the breath and think of the Central Balance Star within the Heavenly Pass, preserving the Dipper Star. Its assistant’s image guards the inch point. Using the ladle finger, fully visualize the body spirit, preserving the Hall of Light, the Three Palaces, Five Viscera, and Twenty-Four Spirits. Fix the face, steady the will, carefully observe the pearl in the center of the pattern—if it is turbid and unclear, then it is a ghost test. One may also use a mirror to look closely; if it is a ghost test, think of the Seven Stars before the face, or place them atop the head to repel, called preserving Kui and covering the head, using the ladle finger. Also recite the Heavenly Peng incantation, imagining being struck down by the Heavenly Thread. One may also recite the Ghost Killing Spell. If the pattern is square and clear, it is a perfected immortal of the dao, even if not perfectly square but clear and cold, an extraordinary person. If fire and sun shine upon them without shadow, the proof is even greater. The enlightened bow; the unenlightened fail the test. If encountering an evil ghost and calling it a perfected one, this is also a failure—be cautious.

Baopuzi says: When entering famous mountains to seek the magical herb Ganoderma, the months of March and September are when the mountain opens and divine immortal medicines emerge. Do not choose the day of mountain scars, but the day of Heavenly Assistance. The time of Heavenly Assistance, when the Three Wonders meet, is especially auspicious. See *Three Wonders Announcement Gate*. Upon arriving at the mountain, choose the Six Yin days and the time of the Hall of Light. Carry the spirit talisman, lead a white dog, hold a white chicken, with one sheng of salt and the mountain-opening talisman inscribed on a great stone. One will surely obtain Ganoderma. When gathering and consuming Ganoderma, choose days when the earthly branches and heavenly stems mutually generate each other. This Ganoderma is common on many mountains, but ordinary people with impure dao hearts, vile intentions, thin virtue, and no knowledge of mountain entry techniques, though they may obtain the map, will not recognize its form and thus never acquire it. Mountains, large or small, all have ghosts and spirits. If they do not give Ganoderma to people, even if revealed, it cannot be seen.

Baopuzi says: According to the *Nine Heavens Secret Records*, when entering mountains, one must avoid days unsuitable for the Great. For large months, avoid the third, eleventh, fifteenth, eighteenth, twenty-fourth, and thirtieth days; for small months, avoid the first, fifth, thirteenth, sixteenth, twenty-eighth, and twenty-sixth days. Entering mountains on these days angers the mountain spirits, and what is sought will not be obtained, and efforts fail. Not only daoists but ordinary people entering mountains on these days suffer misfortune, encountering tigers, wolves, and poisonous insects. Entering mountains at improper times will surely bring consequences; do not enter lightly.

Also, according to the *Jade Bell Scripture*: entering famous mountains requires knowledge of the secret arts of Dun Jia, which cannot be explained to others in detail. The *Lingbao Text* also says: when entering mountains, one should use the Protective Day and the Righteous Day. If one focuses solely on these days, it is very auspicious; days of Restraint and Attack bring death. These are not the same in all traditions. I have entered mountains a few times and thus studied Dun Jia books, which number over sixty scrolls. Their matters cannot be fully mastered, so I have gathered the essentials as a ready reference, but not passed them on in writing. Now, roughly speaking, those who wish to enter mountains should seek those who know; such people are not lacking in the world.

The *Seven Primal Scripture* says: to seek the dao, use the Heavenly Inner Day and Heavenly Inner Hour. To repel ghosts and spirits, use talismans and writings on the Heavenly Bird Day and Heavenly Bird Hour. To enter mountains and keep all evil, wolves, tigers, and thieves away, use Heavenly Treasury and Earth Gate. The six Gui correspond to Heavenly Treasury; the six Si correspond to Earth Gate.

It also says: in chaotic times, to escape the edges and enter mountains without worry, use the Upper Primal Dingmao Day, the day of Yin Virtue, and its hour to hide away. This is called the sun sinking by day, the sun and moon without light, unseen by humans or ghosts.

It also says: to seek immortality and study the dao entering famous mountains, use the six Gui Day and six Gui Hour, also called the Heavenly Heart Day, and one will surely be saved.

It also says: when going into forests and mountains, use the left hand to take a green dragon plant, break it in half and place it under the Peng Star, pass through the Hall of Light, enter the Yin, walking the Yu step, then recite:

> Commander of the Nose, General of the Taiyin,  
> Open only to great-grandson such and such,  
> Do not open to outsiders.  
> Those who see such are like bundles of firewood;  
> Those who do not see are not human.

Then break the held grass and place it at the Earth Gate. Use the left hand to take soil and transfer it to the philtrum, the right hand holding grass to cover oneself. Step forward with the left foot, walk the Yu step until reaching the six Gui, hold breath and remain still—neither humans nor ghosts will see. The six Jia correspond to the Green Dragon Peng Star, six Bing to the Hall of Light, six Ding to the Yin. The Yu step method is: stand upright with the right foot forward, left foot behind, then step forward again with the left foot, bringing it alongside the right foot—this is one step. Then step forward with the left foot, then right foot alongside the left—two steps. Then left foot again, then right foot alongside right—three steps. This is the Yu step method. All manner of strange creatures know the Yu step; it is not only for this matter.

This corresponds to the Completed Hexagram. The first and second traces are not among the nine traces, but still follow one step of seven chi, totaling two zhang one chi. Looking back, the nine-trace Yu step is dry indeed.

Baopuzi says: The Lingbao’s so-called Protective Day means the day when the heavenly stems and earthly branches generate downward. For example, Jiawu and Yisi days. Jia is Wood, Wu is Fire; Yi is also Wood, Si also Fire. Fire is born of Wood. The so-called Righteous Day means the day when the earthly branches generate upward. For example, Renshen and Guiyou days. Ren is Water, Shen is Metal; Gui is also Water, You also Metal. Water is born of Metal. The so-called Restraint Day means the day when heavenly stems restrain earthly branches. For example, Wuzi and Jihai days. Wu is Earth, Zi is Water; Ji is Earth, Hai also Water. Earth restrains Water according to the Five Phases. The so-called Attack Day means the day when earthly branches restrain heavenly stems. For example, Jia Shen and Yi You days. Jia is Wood, Shen is Metal; Yi is Wood, You also Metal. Metal restrains Wood. By extending these principles, all can be understood.

Baopuzi says: When entering famous mountains, use the Jiazi day as the opening day, hang five-colored silk strips each five cun long on a great stone, and what is sought will surely be obtained.

Baopuzi says: When entering mountains, one should know the secret incantation of the Six Jia. The incantation is:

> “Lin Bing Dou Zhe, all arrayed and advancing.”

These nine characters should always be recited secretly; nothing cannot be warded off. This is the essential dao without fuss.

The above method is thus, with minor variations.

This is the Yellow Lord’s forty-nine true talismans of the embryo from the Yellow Court. If one wishes to enter mountains and forests, on the Jiazi and Yin days, write the talisman in cinnabar on white silk, place it on the altar at night facing the Northern Dipper, offer wine and dried meat, state one’s name, bow twice, then tuck it into the collar. It wards off the mountain’s hundreds of ghosts and myriad spirits, tigers, wolves, and poisonous insects. Daoists who avoid the world and enter mountains and forests use this method.

**First Talisman**

**Second Talisman**

**Third Talisman**

These three talismans are all Yellow Lord’s mountain entry talismans. Written in cinnabar on peachwood tablets, enlarging the characters to fill the board, place them on the four corners of doors and gates, and key points along the mountain paths within fifty steps of one’s dwelling, repelling mountain spirits and ghosts with sure effect.

These two talismans are Yellow Lord’s mountain entry talismans. They may be placed on beams and pillars inside houses. Ordinary people living in mountains and forests, or temporarily entering mountains, may use these talismans, both sides inscribed with the same text.

These two talismans, inscribed on both sides with the same text, were received by the immortal Chen Anshi for repelling tigers and wolves when entering mountains. Written in cinnabar on silk, the two talismans differ. Wear them behind the elbow—men on the left, women on the right—or carry them. They may be placed on all four sides of one’s dwelling on tablets. When moving, remove the talismans.

These two talismans are the Yellow Lord’s seals for repelling snakes, tigers, and wolves. Carved on jujube wood cores two cun long, bow twice and wear them. They have divine efficacy. Common folk who believe may all wear them with great fortune.

These three talismans may also be placed beside ox and horse stables, pigpens, and all around to repel tigers and wolves.

The secret essentials within the Purple Court are the Yellow Lord Lao’s cultivation techniques. They must not be transmitted recklessly to unworthy persons, lest calamities befall one’s ancestors. One must be extremely cautious.
