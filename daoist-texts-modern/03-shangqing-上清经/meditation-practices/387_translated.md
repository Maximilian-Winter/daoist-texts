## Scripture on Essential Matters for Cultivating the Body in the Supreme Clarity

### Chapter One: The Method of Binding the Three Souls from the Numinous Writ Purple Text of the Supreme Subtle

A Daoist must first inspect and regulate the soul and spirit, banishing the corpse demons. Always on the dark moon and new moon days, as well as the days of Gengshen and Jiayin, one must observe a pure fast, enter a chamber, bathe away dust and filth, arrange the mat properly, and sit. If one can remain sleepless, so much the better. With a genuine cinnabar brush, one dots beneath the left eye’s corner; with an orpiment brush, one dots beneath the right nostril, allowing a small portion to enter inside. When finished, click the teeth three times in succession and recite the blessing:

> Two shadows entwine in flight, cinnabar and orpiment scatter like smoke,  
> Qi seizes the void’s evil, corpse filth sinks and vanishes,  
> Harmonize the soul, refine the spirit, unite the form’s great deity,  
> Grant me undying life, ten thousand longevity and wholeness,  
> Clear wisdom and piercing vision, long enjoy benefits and grace.

Then click the teeth three times again, swallow saliva three times, and with the right hand’s second finger pinch beneath the left eye’s corner seven times; with the left hand’s second finger pinch beneath the right nostril seven times. Press downward without lifting the hand—thus all is complete. These two points are the gates through which the seven spirits wander as corpse thieves, the thoroughfares of malevolent spirits and devils. Therefore, receiving the essence of cinnabar and orpiment seals the path of corpse demons, invites the fragrance of the two shadows, and extinguishes the disorderly qi. This is the supreme ultimate highest method. Regular practice ensures soul and spirit are peaceful and harmonious, corpse filth is scattered and cut off, one becomes a long-living immortal, with spiritual penetration and clear vision. Practiced for three years, all color and thought vanish. This day is called the day of corpse demon contention; men and women must not sit together—be cautious.

When refining the ultimate dao and reciting sacred scriptures, every ten or twenty words one must lick the lips and swallow saliva three times; every hundred or fifty words one must click the teeth two or three times, to summon spiritual communion and harmony of blood and qi, so that numinous fluids condense and fill, and the imperial one’s dwelling is pleased—this is called effortless qi, dim yet unspilled.

In all Daoist methods, one must not weep tears or spit, for these waste fluids and leak the vital essence, causing great exhaustion of throat and brain. Thus true Daoist immortals always practice inhaling and swallowing tastes to harmonize the six fluids.

A Daoist must always keep in mind their own form and appearance, imagining a mirror image before them, so that the face always shines with the light of sun and moon, illuminating the whole form. The sun is on the left, the moon on the right, nine inches from the face. When done, peck the teeth three times in succession and recite:

> Primordial embryo, highest truth, twin shadows and two mysteries,  
> Right embraces seven spirits, left binds three souls,  
> Let my spirit and brightness always remain with the form.

Then click the teeth three times, seven times each, swallow saliva seven times—this is called the way of the imperial lord to preserve the form, bind the souls, and restrain the spirits, making one wise, immortal, and long-living. If one cannot recite the blessing, one may simply hold the practice.

All Supreme Clarity methods of clicking teeth and swallowing saliva have their own directions and sequence; one must not confuse or mix them, lest the true spirit become muddled. Clicking teeth commands the spirit, swallowing qi harmonizes the truth, inhaling and swallowing the six fluids moves and controls the spirit. One must sound the ritual drum while performing the sequence.

When cultivating the supreme method, during ritual blessings one must first peck the teeth, clicking upper and lower teeth together—not left and right. One breath and one swallow must cause the qi and fluids to be swallowed—this is called calling the spirit and harmonizing the truth, seeking to ascend as an immortal.

On the third and thirteenth evenings of the month, the three souls are unsettled; the numinous spirits float and wander, the embryonic light releases the form, and the hidden essence disturbs and calls. These three lords—numinous spirit, embryonic light, and hidden essence—are the names of the three souls. On these nights they abandon the body to roam, rushing wildly through the chamber, sometimes seen and restrained by other souls or ghosts, sometimes captured by demons, sometimes unable to return, leaving form and releasing substance, sometimes attacking the outer souls. The two qi battle, all agitated like newborn infants, causing other thoughts, coming and going without form, hearts sorrowful and minds distressed. Students must bind and hold them so they do not wander.

The method of binding is to lie down facing upward, with the soles of the feet toward Shen, hands crossed palm over palm on the chest, eyes closed and breath held for three breaths. Click the teeth three times in succession, holding the mind with a red qi like a chick rising from inside, emerging from the eyes, passing outward. The red qi grows large, covering the body like a crown ninefold, flowing down to the feet and up to the head and neck, transforming into fire that burns the body all around, inside and out, making it thoroughly penetrated, like glowing coals. When complete, one should feel a slight heat within the body. Then click the teeth three times again, holding the breath, and call the three souls by name: numinous spirit, embryonic light, hidden essence—then they quickly settle. Then softly recite:

> Supreme Subtle Mysterious Palace, Central Yellow begins blue,  
> Internally refining the three souls, embryonic light at peace,  
> Spirit treasure jade chamber, born together with me,  
> Do not move recklessly, overseer is the Great Spirit,  
> If you wish to fly, only go to the Supreme Ultimate Supreme Clarity,  
> If hungry or thirsty, only drink the returning spring jade essence.

All complete.

### Chapter Two: The Method of Binding the Seven Spirits from the Numinous Writ Purple Text of the Supreme Subtle

On the new moon, full moon, and dark moon evenings, the seven spirits roam and wander in filth and impurity, sometimes mingling with blood and food, ghosts and spirits coming and going, sometimes joining with corpses, sometimes seducing infants to gather and conspire against the household, sometimes reporting human sins to the Three Officials and River Lord, sometimes transforming into specters to cause disgust and harm, sometimes entering the body to call forth evil and kill the essence. All residual illnesses in humans are the fault of the spirits; the death of the joyous is the nature of the spirits; the ruin of desire is the sickness of the spirits. The Daoist must restrain and suppress them, refine and transform them, subdue and stop them, gather and command them.

The first spirit is called Corpse Dog; the second, Hidden Arrow; the third, Sparrow Shade; the fourth, Swallowing Thief; the fifth, Non-Toxin; the sixth, Purging Filth; the seventh, Stinking Rot. These are the seven spirits’ yin names, the turbid ghosts within the body.

The method of control is to cross the hands at the nape, hold breath seven times, click teeth seven times, imagining white qi at the nose tip like a small bean, gradually growing to crown the body ninefold, reaching from feet to head. When complete, the white qi suddenly transforms into heavenly beasts: two azure dragons in the eyes, two white tigers in the nostrils, all facing outward; a vermilion bird on the heart facing the mouth; a blue dragon beneath the left foot; a spirit snake beneath the right foot; in both ears a jade maiden clad in dark brocade stands at the ear gates; each hand holds a flame. After a while, all is complete. Then swallow saliva seven times, click teeth seven times, call the seven spirits by name, and softly recite:

> Pure qi cycles nine times, restrain the spirits’ evil and fierce,  
> Heavenly beasts guard the gates, delicate maidens hold the passes,  
> Refine the spirits, harmonize and soften, dwell peacefully with me,  
> Do not move recklessly, watch and examine the root of form,  
> If you hunger or thirst, listen and drink the moon’s yellow and sun’s elixir.

All complete. Thus the seven spirits are sealed within, restrained and controlled. If practiced constantly, the turbid spirits dissolve downward, returning to goodness and dwelling in the form, harmonizing the three palaces, uniting with the primordial numinous.

### Chapter Three: Master Tai Su’s Method to Repel Evil Dreams for Beginners

If one frequently encounters evil dreams, there are three causes: one, spirits of the spirits; two, trials of the heart; three, corpse thieves. This is the method to dispel and consume them. Upon waking from a dream, pinch the philtrum beneath the nose with the left hand two or seven times, click teeth two or seven times, and softly recite:

> Great Cavern True Mystery, extend and refine the three souls,  
> First soul swiftly guards the seven spirits,  
> Second soul swiftly guards the mud pellet,  
> Third soul receives the heart’s command,  
> Quickly summon the Three Primordial Lords of Tai Su.  
> When encountering ominous dreams, these are the seven spirits and wandering corpses colluding, sources of myriad evils.  
> Urgently summon Peach Blossom Protection to guard life, report to the imperial lords, the Five Elders and Nine Truths, all guarding the body’s gates,  
> Yellow Gate Spirit Masters, Purple Gate Generals, holding axes and bells,  
> Destroy evil passes, reverse misfortune to good fortune, life and death have no connection.

When finished, if one lies down again, one will surely receive good responses. If evil dream qi arises, it will be sealed beneath the heavenly gate. After three years, only divine inspiration and decree will produce dreams, all dreams will clearly reveal the future without evil omens.

If one encounters good dreams at night, auspicious and pleasing to the heart, this is a good sign. Upon waking, rub the eyes two or seven times, click teeth two or seven times, and softly recite:

> Most High Supreme Spirit, Three Emperors’ Elixir Spirit,  
> Vermilion Palace shines clearly, auspicious signs report their message,  
> Three Primordial gentle spirits, Heavenly Sovereign grants the scripture,  
> All directions harmonize, flying immortals of Supreme Clarity,  
> Always with Jade Truth, together meeting in the Purple Court.

All complete. This great cavern secret method is passed to those first crossing the river of transmigration.

### Chapter Four: Master Tai Su’s Method for Receiving Auspicious Dreams

Any scholar who dreams of a woman dressed in purple gauze robes, holding a tray of food to receive, should not fear or disdain the food. All such food is true colors of the Eastern Sea or rare herbs from the Five Sacred Mountains, eating it brings longevity.

When a Daoist sleeps during the day, first press both hands on the eyes, four points, three or seven times, click teeth three or seven times, then lie down.

When a Daoist sleeps at dusk, first press the left hand on both nostrils three or seven times, click teeth three or seven times, then lie down.

### Chapter Six: Jade Clarity Method to Dispel Demons and Control Ghostly Spirits

> Thousand spirits and myriad poisons, dare to confront me,  
> Giant beasts with heavy jaws, gutting and liver-slicing,  
> Divine lords and messengers guard and defend the camp,

> Seven spirits protect life, ascending to the Three Purities,  
> Twin sovereigns drive away, frightening the armies of Boro,  
> Three hundred thousand, guarding the divine camp,  
> Giant beasts a hundred zhang tall, exuding mighty power,  
> Wielding swords to chase away evil, beheading demons and spirits,

### Chapter Eight: The Purple Writ of the Azure Waist: Refining and Blessing the Dead Corpses

Those who cultivate the Supreme Clarity Dao, when foretelling the death of parents, uncles, brothers in the world, the body’s trace has not yet vanished. For those who walk among the dead and decaying, after three days take a jar of clear water and one tael of cinnabar, throw it into the water, face south in the courtyard facing water, click teeth nine times, and recite:

> Qi transforms into spirit, corpse changes entering mystery,  
> Three transformations and five refinements, ascending to the Nine Heavens,  
> The kalpa of the Nine Heavens, again crossing the armor body,  
> Armor body transforms again, becoming a true person.

When finished, men think of three jade boys, women think of seven jade maidens, pour the jar of water over the corpse, then wash hands and face with the water, look up to the sky and rinse mouth. Then softly recite:

> Heaven’s qi is clear, human transformation is born,  
> Born to ascend Heaven, nine transformations and changed form,  
> Five sufferings and three hells severed, death’s name cut off,  
> Transcending and saving the desperate souls, returning to the Southern Court.

Thus the deceased is transformed anew, born above the Nine Heavens, after nine years ascending to the Jade Clarity palace. This method is more wondrous than the Great Cavern’s method of ferrying the Seven Ancestors, secret to the Jade Emperor, not to be transmitted to the untrue. There is a golden-named imperial chart with green characters and purple text; if one sees this text, do not lightly use or falsely tell others, lest the Seven Ancestors’ ghost officials close the gates forever, the three hells and five sufferings never to be restored. The bright science of the Four Extremities has lasted over seven hundred years; true persons listen and transmit.

When a scholar of the higher learning wanders the roads of the world and suddenly encounters a dead corpse, foul qi drying the body, one must stop after twenty-four steps, face north, click teeth nine times. Male corpses think of three jade boys, female corpses think of seven jade maidens, come to request the imperial pure water of yellow mushroom and white grass from the jade valley, to pour over the dead corpse. Soon the dead corpse transforms and is born as a person. Then softly recite:

> Once withered, now flourishing, once extinguished, now born,  
> Born to ascend Heaven, again receiving the Great Spirit,  
> The kalpa of the Nine Heavens, repeated cycles of embryo and infant,  
> Filth and burden swept away, white corpse reborn.

Then wipe the eyes two or seven times and stop. Thus the foul qi is resolved, the dead receives transformation, becoming a spirit person. After twenty-four steps, performing this refining blessing, merit complete and virtue increased, one’s name is marked in Supreme Clarity. After twenty-four years, one can ride the spiritual wheel, flying through the nine mysteries.

### Chapter Ten: Foreign Method of Divination for Mountain Dwelling’s Auspiciousness and Inauspiciousness

From the cavern depths and nine earths, thirty-six sounds inscribed within:

- First rampart: lustrous color earth, with proper sound, moving sound, wandering sound, and Brahma sound, one each.

- Third rampart: stone fat color lustrous earth, same four sounds.

If the paper is yellow and lustrous, very auspicious; if blue, there are dead spirits beneath; if white, inauspicious; if red, fear and terror; if black, there is treasure; if purple, one gains immortals. If none differ, it is correct. One may dwell for three years; beyond that, injury and harm will occur.

The person must hold the supreme dao in heart, seek aid from Taiyi, then face north, click teeth thirty times, hold breath and secretly recite. When finished, click teeth again as above, swallow saliva ten times. Thus wickedness is destroyed and crushed, demons subdued and extinguished. Seven spirits entwine, Taiyi inspects and controls, myriad spirits guard truth, external evil qi subdued. This may also be recited daily, chanting and singing, sitting or lying at will, to block all evil tests and seal evil ghosts’ harmful traces. When lying down to sleep, also often recite, making spirit peaceful and mind clear, dispelling dreams and disgust, eliminating poisons and evils, so one fears nothing all life. On days of chanting, no longer face north or hold breath secretly. The secret holding breath and reciting is because ghosts and demons have tested left and right, evil spirits have invaded the spirit chamber, so command spirit life truth to gather their evil traces only. The sleeping blessing is not the same as this method.

### Chapter Twenty-Two: Jade Clarity Method for Daoists’ Teeth Clicking and Regulation

All Supreme Clarity methods of clicking teeth and swallowing saliva have their own directions and sequences; one must not confuse or mix them, lest the true spirit become muddled. Clicking teeth commands the spirit, swallowing qi harmonizes the truth, inhaling and swallowing the six fluids moves and controls the spirit. One must sound the ritual drum while performing the sequence.

When cultivating the supreme method, during ritual blessings one must first peck the teeth, clicking upper and lower teeth together—not left and right. One breath and one swallow must cause the qi and fluids to be swallowed—this is called calling the spirit and harmonizing the truth, seeking to ascend as an immortal. The method of clicking teeth, upper and lower teeth clicking is called the heavenly drum; left teeth clicking is called the heavenly bell; right teeth clicking is called the heavenly chime. To control ghosts and summon demons, one may click the bell and chime; to walk the dao and seek truth, click the heavenly drum.

### Chapter Twenty-Three: Master Tai Shang Su Ling’s Blessing for Hearing Ear Ringing

If one hears ringing in the ears, cover the ears with crossed hands and recite:

> Infant in the palace, nine truths in the chamber,  
> All spirits obey commands, also inspecting misfortune,  
> Taiyi flowing fire, to extinguish myriad evils.

Then cover the ear gate with the hand seven times. If one feels warmth on the face, this is a good sign. If one feels coldness between head and neck, evil qi has entered. One must quickly lie down facing water, hold the mysterious elixir palace Taiyi true lord, and cast the flowing fire bell to drive out evil qi from the ears. The firelight follows behind, shining brightly to illuminate the whole body. After a while, all calms.

### Chapter Twenty-Four: Master Tai Shang Su Ling’s Method to Inspect the Auspiciousness of Ear Ringing

If suddenly one hears the sound of rushing water, thunder, or drum beating in the ears, this indicates bodily damage and heart storage extreme harm, unable to taste true essence of life, leading to licentiousness and disorder, causing six organs to lose control, soul and spirit lamenting. This portends illness and death. Thus the mud pellet’s method is loosened, nine palaces become irregular, sorrow and disturbance reverse, drums beat in disorder, about to abandon the dwelling and leave the body. Those who hear this should focus on the Great One True Lord, return from confusion, concentrate the true heart. If the sin is not deep, one may listen and change. This is why deafness occurs—loss of ear spirit.

If one suddenly hears golden and jade sounds in the ears, true qi has entered, the dao is about to be fulfilled. If one hears string music, the six soldiers and jade maidens come to guard the child’s dao. One should hide and quietly cultivate, diligently increasing the heart’s effort. True persons will gradually appear in form and vision. Without a true master, do not speak to others.

If one hears flute and horn sounds, this is a good omen of noble arrival. If one hears shouting and calling, this is a bad omen of lowly arrival. If one smells foul odors, there must be corpse filth; quickly change clothes, bathe, burn incense, and sweep the chamber to respond. This is the imperial lord’s warning and admonition.

If one hears blood qi or sees blood gathering without cause, this portends military disaster. Quickly flee the human world, guard the Three Primordial Emperors, seek aid and hide, fast for three months, and the calamity will cease. These are all imperial lords’ prior warnings of auspiciousness and misfortune, to inspire fear and sincerity about their fate. When seeing ill omens, one must practice secret virtue, engage in kindness and rescue, doing what others cannot, what travelers cannot do, thus escaping the sure death omen. You must strive, not merely maintain the usual.

### Chapter Twenty-Seven: Seven Sacred Mysterious Records’ Immortal Injuries Method

When a scholar’s mysterious record has a name and the body matches the immortal’s appearance, they should naturally unite with truth, but there are seven injuries:

1. Wearing truth but acting false, lustful desires losing spirit, soul fluid leaking, essence light drying, qi dispersing and spirit scattering, bones hollow and form trembling, spirit weeping in the dark mansion, reported to the heavenly gate, true immortals wander far, thus binding with the nine dusts, matching the earth mansion. How can one still become immortal?

2. Outer form in the dao, skin good and thinking truth, but heart embraces yin thieves, fierce and evil within, wishing for others’ ruin, jealous and envious of the worthy, beautiful words but contrary heart, smiling face but angry inside, judging form by gain and loss, falsely creating sin, slandering fellow students, attacking teacher’s root, recorded by the Three Officials as evil gate, true immortals ascend high, evil demons attack the body, running as shadow, flying and scattering body and spirit, causing crooked and twisted fate, extremely evil origin, examined and full of ash, extinguishing one’s nine springs, only having mysterious name, how to preserve naturalness?

3. Drinking wine and getting drunk, damaging qi and losing spirit, five organs attacked and broken, myriad spirits startled, soul and spirit flying apart, inside and outside decaying, empty chamber, infant crying sadly, true immortals ascend high, evil demons enter the form. Such learning only damages essence and sincerity, though having mysterious record, empty losing jade name, spirit ascending the upper palace, body ashes in darkness, wandering seeking extension, years long halted.

4. Acting without broadening things, blaming others and ancestors, heart angry and mouth harsh, cursing without constancy, anger and joy losing measure, temperament discordant, qi agitated and spirit scattered, inner truth flying up, spirit leaving soul wandering, nine orifices dusty, five organs fleeing and mourning, all due to impure nature, inauspicious practice, true immortals ascend high, external illness enters form. Such learning, what can it cover? Though having mysterious chart, cannot avoid this calamity, hoping for immortality long delayed, earth years long.

5. Or mysterious chart revealed, receiving precious scripture, or meeting spiritual master, receiving divine script, but not following proper rules, form leaks heavenly truth, not passing nine years, casting lots on famous mountains, having jade palace record, golden gate compiling chapters, then transmitting to others, spreading in the world, lightly revealing truth and treasure, examining and binding oneself, only having mysterious name, instead accumulating seven mysteries, immortal dao ascends high, body dies in dark springs, long filling ghost punishments, ten thousand kalpas no restoration.

6. Body walking corpse filth, form and shadow not fragrant, inside no purity, outside no orchid fragrance, clear spirit losing immortality, spirit not residing in chamber, qi disturbed and essence mixed, spirit origin losing light, five spirits flying apart, infant soaring, evil demons attacking, inside and outside mourning, such learning hopes to succeed but harms, true immortals ascend high, empty shadow alone walking, sinking into turbidity, how can one deceive immortality?

7. Eating all kinds of living flesh, killing beautiful mouths, foul odors filling viscera, destroying life form not one’s own, true qi disturbed at spirit gate, wandering spirits frightening infant, soul and spirit wandering in mansion, turbid stagnation entangling mouth and teeth, immortal truth ascending high in Jade Clarity, self sinking deeply in earth, only having mysterious name in imperial slips, also cannot avoid certain death.

The High Sacred Emperor Lord says: The foundation of learning the dao is to urgently avoid these seven injuries. Once one has seen and opened the cavern gate, revealed the jade chapters, not violating the seven injury prohibitions, one will await spiritual descent, rising in broad daylight. If outwardly diligent but inwardly not avoiding seven injuries, one will hope for immortality but fail, hope for life but perish, hope for good fortune but meet misfortune, hope to fly but sink, spiritual immortals vanish in the clear heights, five spirits scatter in the eight wildernesses, infants cry in the central mansion, wandering souls lament in the mysterious void. Thus immortal appearance has success and failure; higher learning has seven injuries. Those who are earnest and devoted, who can clarify their truth?

### Chapter Twenty-Eight: The Ten Failures of Immortal Appearance from the Numinous Writ Purple Text

1. Do not love lust; lust causes soul fluid to leak, essence light to dry, spirit to burn and spirit scatter, bones thin and marrow foul, souls wail in spirit mansion, reported to heavenly pavilion, three palaces contend, embryonic essence grieves and errs. This is the first failure of immortal appearance.

2. Do not be a fierce and evil yin thief; fierce and evil cause the yellow court to disorder, three corpses love killing, soul and spirit spy and scheme, spirit ghosts invade the chamber, eyes lose brightness, mouth produces harmful qi. This is the second failure.

3. Do not drink wine; drunkenness causes form and substance to decay, spirit and truth to confuse, soul forgets the chamber, spirit wanders evil houses, infants cry and fly, throat and brain burn. This is the third failure.

4. Do not be filthy, slow, and unclean; such causes clear spirit to lose truth, essence and spirit not to dwell, three palaces grow worms, infants float and wander, blood turbid and marrow foul, spirit light loses home, spirit runs evil gates, seeking death’s book. This is the fourth failure.

5. Do not eat any living flesh; this causes primordial form to be lost, root and foundation to perish, embryonic spirit wails, scarlet lord calls and mourns, three souls cruel and poisonous, spirits seek graves. This flesh entering the mouth causes life to fall into long night. This is the fifth failure.

6. Do not eat any living flesh from water; this causes form and spirit to violate truth, mud pellet destroyed, three palaces close gates, infants confused, souls and spirits flee, spirits seek coffin and box. This is the sixth failure.

7. Do not eat bird flesh; this causes qi, form, and voice to stink, essence and spirit to stagnate, brain yellow and teeth dry, spleen nurtures death qi, soul does not receive truth, spirit produces evil vigor, body sinks into long abyss, bones and marrow lost. This is the seventh failure.

8. Do not eat the five pungent vegetables; this causes five organs to stink, three flowers to ulcerate, spirit not to ascend, essence and embryo to fall, soul and spirit to separate, infants troubled and weary, flying spirits lose guard, eyes lose brightness and flow away. This is the eighth failure.

9. Do not kill insects and above; this causes battle against all things, binding corpse blood resentment, form violent and spirit fierce, soul and qi fighting, embryonic spirit fearful and frantic, infants scatter, mud pellet crazy, infants abandon and rebel, corpse form boiling pot, water boiling and fire burning. This is the ninth failure.

10. Do not face north to urinate or defecate, look up at the three lights, do not face north to cut hair, remove clothes, or spit curses, lest one violate and break the king. Breaking means the year’s downward branch; king means the place of royal qi.

Do not anger the sun, moon, or stars; do not wield power or punishment on the eight festival days; do not be angry on the new moon day.

Do not harm turtle, dragon, scale, or shell on the six jia days; do not harm pheasants on bingwu days; do not harm black beasts on bingzi days; do not have other thoughts on gengshen days; do not drink wine or eat meat on yimao days; must fast, keep pure and calm.

Do not kill on the first month; do not eat meat on the ninth day of the second month; do not eat the hearts of all herbs on the third day of the third month; do not cut grass or fell trees on the eighth day of the fourth month; do not see blood on the fifth day of the fifth month; do not break ground on the sixth day of the sixth month; do not think evil thoughts on the seventh day of the seventh month; do not buy or wear footwear with attached insects on the fourth day of the eighth month; do not rise from bed or mat on the ninth day of the ninth month; do not punish others on the fifth day of the tenth month; do not neglect bathing on the eleventh day of the eleventh month; do not fail to fast, burn incense, and recite the true on the last three days of the twelfth month.

Such taboos are great prohibitions of Heaven and Man, reported by the Three Officials, and considered grave crimes. They may cause the three souls to become ill, the seven spirits to compete and wander, the embryonic spirit to be hated, and the three palaces to suffer evil. Thus evil dreams arise in the red heart, evil leaders ride the vermilion gate, essence and fluid are violated, spirit truth confused, transformations forbidden, unknown taboos. If you can observe and cultivate, you become an immortal talent; if you do not observe Heaven’s prohibitions, you become a damaged failure.

### Chapter Thirty-One: Daoists’ Auspicious Mountain Entry Dates and Taboos

A Daoist wishing to enter a mountain should choose the seventh day of the third month as auspicious. Also, in spring do not enter east or west mountains; in summer do not enter south or north mountains; in autumn do not enter west or east mountains; in winter do not enter north or south mountains.

Good days for mountain entry are days of Bao, Yi, and Zuan; days of Zhi and Fa are inauspicious.

Days of Jiazi, Bingyin, Dingmao, Jisi, Xinwei, Renshen, Guiyou, Yihai, Gengchen, Xinchou, Gengxu, Wuwu are Yi days, auspicious.

Days of Dingchou, Bingxu, Jiawu, Gengzi, Renshen, Guiwei, Yisi, Dingwei, Wushen, Jiuyou, Xinhai, Bingchen are Bao days, auspicious.

Days of Wuchen, Jichou, Wuxu, Bingwu, Gengzi, Jiayin, Yiwei, Dingsi, Jiwei, Gengshen, Xinyou, Guihai are Zuan days, auspicious.

Days of Yichou, Jiaxu, Wuwu, Wuzi, Guisi, Jiayin, Gengyin, Xinmao, Yiwei, Bingshen, Dingyou, Jihai are Zhi days, inauspicious.

Days of Gengwu, Bingzi, Wuyin, Jimao, Xinsi, Guimei, Jiashen, Yiyou, Dinghai, Renzhen, Guichou, Ruxu are Fa days, inauspicious.

If a Daoist suddenly encounters evil and misfortune, strike the heavenly bell thirty-six times, clicking the left teeth.

If a Daoist performs a mountain exorcism and mighty blessing, strike the heavenly chime thirty-six times, clicking the right teeth.

If one cultivates thought and summons spirits, sound the heavenly drum thirty-six times, clicking upper and lower teeth.

When a Daoist lodges alone in mountain forests and is often tested by mountain spirits and evil ghosts, click teeth two or seven times, hold breath and recite:

> Yesterday I was summoned by the emperor,  
> Commanding true origin, ordering me to seal and govern the Northern Peak,  
> Crushing and cutting Feng Mountain, myriad spirits obey,  
> All gather before the emperor, seven spirits open and separate,  
> Three Primordials command truth, if any minor evil, immediately destroy,  
> Mountain spirits and marsh officials, quickly come to serve and welcome,  
> Divine masters’ orders, reported to the Three Purities,  
> Just as the Great Cavern method, no delay allowed.

When finished, click teeth two or seven times again. This is the imperial lord’s supplementary spirit blessing to strike mountain spirits and a hundred ghosts. All mountain gods, earth deities, and chamber lords hearing this blessing take up whips and come to serve, divine soldiers guarding. It is as if lodging with ten thousand people.

Those receiving the third grade supreme dao, or not yet ascending to the Three Purities to receive the immortal lord title, are often tested by heavenly demons, disturbed by myriad spirits. One should chant the exorcism blessing, stirring the spiritual sound of heaven above, summoning the mighty gods of the Three Realms below, binding myriad spirits in the heavenly bell, cutting demons in the cavern script. When performing this method, always face north, first imagine the nape born round image like the sun, with vermilion phoenix on the left, mysterious dragon on the right, purple haze covering, bright body form, immortal children and jade maidens holding five-colored banners, following myriad gods of the Three Realms, nine phoenixes crying in front, eight luan birds blowing behind, white dragon opening the way, Supreme Ultimate joining the pavilion. Then click left teeth thirty-six times, then right teeth twenty-four times, then upper and lower teeth twelve times, and recite:

> Net heaven poisonous beasts, guarding four great gates,  
> Swallowing, sinking, cutting, swearing, mountain ugly myriad groups,  
> Opening jaws, fierce heavens, wild horses running high,  
> Poison dragons clawing, golden heads swallowing sideways,  
> Mighty soldiers ten thousand, receiving talisman and checking immortals,  
> Six heavens unrestricted, gathering evil into groups,  
> Demon drums roaring, filth qi swirling,  
> Songs hollow and empty, chaotic sounds clouding,  
> Little ghosts punishing, when born at the gate,  
> Spirit kings report, no darkness unheard,  
> Above seizing six qi, below checking river sources,  
> Five mountains and four rivers, good and evil quickly divided,  
> Ten thousand thousands come before me,  
> Five emperors check and record, those meritorious forgiven,  
> Wicked demons and thousand truths, bound by imperial lord,  
> Dare not disobey commands, those executed none spared,  
> Gutting liver and cutting belly, beheading and destroying root,  
> Northern cauldron boiling soup, southern tomb fire burning,  
> Golden truth records qi, flowing bells capturing souls,  
> Evil spirits none left, thoroughly ending form’s source,  
> Wearing heavenly script, dao walking proper text,  
> Washing away nine qi, clarifying three primordials,  
> Mysterious void raising truth, ascending to nature,  
> None may interfere or move, changing reported above.

All complete. Draw in qi twelve times swallowing and stop.

This is the right wisdom exorcism blessing.

Any scholar traveling famous mountains, lodging alone among a hundred ghosts, trembling in fear, or holding infants sick, with ghosts guarding the gate, reciting this once is like melting ice in boiling cauldron, like fire melting gold, spirit and soul clear and correct, qi peaceful and body strong, eyes not receiving fate’s response, ultimately seeking death but unable to find it.
