## Scripture of Shangqing Cultivation Methods and Instructions

### Method One: Binding the Three Souls

From the Supreme Scripture *Spirit Book of Purple Writings*

The daoist must first inspect and control the soul and spirit, dispel the corpse demons, and regularly on the days of the new moon and full moon, as well as on the days of Gengshen and Jiayin, observe pure fasting and enter the chamber. Bathe to wash away dust and dirt, arrange the mat properly and sit upright. If able to remain sleepless, all the better. With a true cinnabar brush, mark below the left inner corner of the eye; with an arsenic yellow brush, mark below the right nostril, letting a small portion enter the valley and be wrapped. When the markings are completed, tap the teeth three times in succession and recite the blessing:

> Two lights fly entwined, cinnabar and yellow scatter smoke,  
> Qi seizes the void and expels evil, corpse filth sinks and vanishes,  
> Harmonize the soul and refine the spirit, unite the form with the great god,  
> Let me not die, longevity forever whole,  
> Wisdom penetrates vision, enduring prosperity, benefit, and steadfastness.

When finished, tap the teeth three times again, swallow saliva three times, then with the right hand’s second finger pinch below the left inner eye corner, and with the left hand’s second finger pinch below the right nostril, each seven times. Press downward without lifting the hand. Thus all is complete. Pressing these two spots blocks the seven spirits’ roaming gateways of the corpse, the thoroughfares of malevolent spirits and thieves. Hence the essence of cinnabar and arsenic seals the path of corpse demons, the two lights’ incense extinguishes licentious qi. This is the supreme ultimate highest method. Regular practice ensures soul and spirit are peaceful and harmonious, corpse filth dissipates utterly, one becomes a long-living immortal, spirit communication and vision are clear. After three years of practice, all colors and thoughts vanish. This day is called the day of corpse demon contention; men and women must not sit together on this day—be cautious.

In all who refine the supreme dao, when reciting the divine scriptures, after ten or twenty words, lick the lips and swallow saliva three times; after one hundred or fifty words, tap the teeth two or three times, summoning spirits and gathering numinous power, harmonizing blood and qi, causing spiritual fluids to condense and fill, the imperial residence of unity rejoices. This is called “unlabored qi of the primordial,” dull but not leaking.

Daoists must not weep tears or leak fluids, for this damages the essence and leaks the spiritual fluids, causing great exhaustion of throat and brain. Therefore, true daoist adepts always use breathing and swallowing to harmonize the six fluids.

Daoists must always hold in mind their own form and countenance, making it vividly present before them, so that the face constantly shines with the light of sun and moon, illuminating the form. Let the sun be on the left, the moon on the right, nine inches from the face. When finished, peck the teeth three times and recite:

> Primordial Supreme True One, twin lights and two mysteries,  
> Right restrains seven spirits, left restrains three souls,  
> Let my spirit and brightness always abide with the form.

Then tap the teeth three times sevenfold, swallow saliva seven times. This is called the emperor lord’s method of preserving form, binding souls, and controlling spirits, making one wise, immortal, and deathless. If one cannot recite the blessing, simply holding this thought alone suffices.

On the third and thirteenth evenings of the month, at this time the three souls are unsettled; the ethereal spirits float and wander, the fetal light releases the form, the hidden essences disturb and summon. The ethereal spirit, fetal light, and hidden essence are the three lords of the three souls. On these evenings they abandon the body to roam, rushing like a gale from the original chamber, sometimes seen and detained by other souls or external ghosts, sometimes captured by demons, sometimes unable to return, separating form and releasing substance, sometimes conflicting with outside souls, the two qi battling, all restless like newborn infants, causing other thoughts to arise, coming and going without form, hearts sorrowful and minds oppressed. Students must bind and retain them, preventing wandering.

The method to bind and retain is: lie down facing upward, place a pillow beneath the head, stretch out the feet, cross the palms on the chest, close the eyes and hold the breath for three breaths, tap the teeth three times in succession, hold the mind with red qi like a chick’s egg, from within look upward, let the red qi emerge from the eyes, from the eyes flow outward, the red qi expands, covers the body from head to foot, transforms into fire, burning the body all around, making inside and outside transparent, like glowing charcoal. When complete, one should feel a slight warmth within the body. Then tap the teeth loudly three times, and recite the names of the three souls: ethereal spirit, fetal light, hidden essence; the three souls quickly settle. Then softly bless:

> Supreme Mysterious Palace, Central Yellow Beginning Blue,  
> Inner refinement of three souls, fetal light peaceful,  
> Spirit treasure jade chamber, born together with me,  
> No reckless movement allowed, the mirror is most numinous,  
> If wishing to fly, only may go to the Supreme Ultimate Shangqing,  
> If hungry or thirsty, only may drink the returning water jade essence.

All complete.

### Method Two: Controlling the Seven Spirits

Also from the *Purple Writings Scripture*

On the evenings of the new moon, full moon, and last day of the month, at this time the seven spirits wander and roam in filth, sometimes communicating with blood and food, going to ghosts and demons, sometimes associating with dead corpses, sometimes corrupting infants, gathering to plot mischief and attack homes, sometimes accusing people’s sins before the Three Officials and River Lord, sometimes transforming into wraiths to cause disgust, sometimes bringing ghosts into the body, calling evil to kill the substance. All residual illnesses in people are the fault of the spirits; delight in death is their nature; desire for ruin is their sickness. The daoist must control and restrain them, refine and transform them, suppress and stop them, gather and awe them.

The first spirit is called Corpse Dog; the second, Hidden Arrow; the third, Sparrow Shade; the fourth, Swallowing Thief; the fifth, Rank Poison; the sixth, Removing Filth; the seventh, Stinking Lung. These are the seven spirits’ yin names, the turbid ghosts within the body.

The method of control and inspection is: cross the hands at the nape, hold breath seven times, tap teeth seven times, hold at the nose tip a white qi like a small bean, gradually growing to cover the ninefold body, from feet to head. When complete, the white qi suddenly transforms into heavenly beasts: two Azure Dragons at the eyes, two White Tigers at the nostrils, all facing outward; Vermilion Bird above the heart, facing the mouth; Cang Turtle beneath the left foot; Spirit Snake beneath the right foot; within the ears are Jade Maidens wearing dark brocade robes at the ear gates; each hand holds a flame of fire. After a while, all complete, swallow saliva seven times, tap teeth seven times, call the seven spirits’ names. Then softly bless:

> Pure qi ninefold, control spirits evil and fierce,  
> Heavenly beasts guard the gates, lovely maidens hold the watch,  
> Refine spirits to harmony and softness, be at peace with me,  
> No reckless movement allowed, watch the form’s origin,  
> If you hunger or thirst, listen to drink the moon’s yellow and sun’s elixir.

All complete. Thus the seven spirits are sealed inside, guarded and controlled. If practiced regularly, the turbid spirits dissolve downward, returning to goodness, harmonizing with the Three Officials, and merging with the primordial numinous.

### Method Three: Dispelling Evil Dreams

From the Supreme Scripture *Feminine One Five Elders Scripture*

If one often encounters evil dreams, there are three kinds: first, white demons; second, heart trials; third, corpse thieves. The method to dispel and consume them is: upon awakening from the dream, pinch the philtrum with the left hand twenty-seven times, peck the teeth twenty-one times, and softly bless:

> Great cavern true mystery, expand and refine the three souls,  
> The first soul swiftly guards the seven spirits,  
> The second soul swiftly guards the mud pellet,  
> The third soul receives the heart’s command,  
> Quickly open the Three Primal Lords of the Great Element,  
> When encountering inauspicious dreams, these seven spirits and wandering corpses conspire,  
> Source of myriad evils, urgently summon Peach and Kang to protect life,  
> Report above to the emperor lord, Five Elders and Nine Truths, all guard the body gates,  
> Yellow Gate divine masters, Purple Gate generals, hold iron and ring,  
> Annihilate evil spirits, reverse misfortune to auspiciousness, life and death without cause.

When finished, if one lies down again, good responses will be obtained. If evil dream qi arises, it will be sealed beneath the heavenly gate. After three years, only divine inspiration and true response will produce dreams; all dreams will be clear visions of the future, no longer evil or ominous.

If one encounters auspicious dreams at night, this is a good response. If upon waking the heart feels good, it is an auspicious sign. Upon waking, rub the eyes twenty-seven times, tap the teeth twenty-one times, and softly bless:

> Supreme Highest Essence, Three Emperors’ Elixir Spirits,  
> Crimson Palace bright and clear, auspicious response reports the message,  
> Three Primes guard the spirits, Heavenly Emperor grants the scripture,  
> All directions accord, flying immortals of Shangqing,  
> Always with Jade Truth, together gathering in the Purple Court.

All complete. This great cavern secret method is passed to those first crossing the ferry of the stream.

### Method Four: Receiving Auspicious Dreams

Also from the *Five Elders Scripture*

Any scholar who dreams of a woman dressed in purple silk robes, holding a tray of food and offering it, should accept and eat without fear. This food is all treasures and delicacies of the Eastern Sea, or rare true herbs from the lofty Five Sacred Mountains. Eating it brings longevity and extension of life.

Daoists resting by day should first press the four corners of the eyes with both hands twenty-one times, tap the teeth twenty-one times, then lie down.

Daoists retiring at dusk should press both nostrils with the left hand twenty-one times, tap the teeth twenty-one times, then lie down.

---

### Method Five: Blessing for Peaceful Sleep

From the Supreme Scripture *Yellow and White Forty-Four Methods Scripture*

When a daoist is about to sleep, place the hand on the heart three times, close the eyes and bless:

> Supreme Numinous Nine Palaces, Taiyi guards the chamber,  
> Hundred spirits attend their stations, soul and spirit harmonize,  
> Longevity and deathlessness, sealing and extinguishing evil and fierce.

When finished, sleep.

### Method Six: Controlling and Blessing Against Demonic Spirits

From the *Jade Clarity Scripture of Demon Dispelling*

When a daoist travels alone and lodges in places inhabited by evil spirits and demons, one should tap the left teeth thirty-six times, hold breath and softly bless:

> Supreme Emperor of Yang Origin, Fourfold net of hidden gates,  
> Thousand demons and myriad poisons dare confront me,  
> Great beasts with heavy jaws, gutting belly and liver,  
> Divine lords’ envoys guard the camp, yellow-clad divine soldiers,  
> Slay and cut down evil souls, behead and destroy a thousand demons,  
> Crush and cast down wicked traitors, annihilate their kind,  
> By the Jade Emperor’s command, cleanse the Three Primes.

When finished, tap teeth thirty-six times again. This is called the Supreme Emperor’s waving spirit internal blessing to seal and extinguish myriad demons.

---

### Method Seven: Fasting and Seeing Inauspicious Things

Also from the *Forty-Four Methods Scripture*

When a daoist fasting enters the chamber and encounters inauspicious things, one should perform the Northern Emperor’s blessing against ghosts. First tap the left teeth thirty-six times, then bless:

> Two images diverge and incline, essence of the Mysterious One,  
> Seven spirits guard life, ascend to the Three Pure Ones,  
> Twin Emperors drive away, frighten the Bo Luo soldiers,  
> Three hundred thousand, attend the divine camp,  
> Great beasts a hundred zhang tall, exhale awe and seize essence,  
> Wield swords to chase away evil, behead and cast down demon spirits,  
> Divine Bo’s blessing, a thousand demons destroyed.

When finished, tap teeth thirty-six times again.

### Method Eight: Refining and Blessing Dead Corpses

From the Supreme Scripture *Essential Green Purple Book of Golden Root*

The Purple Book states: Anyone cultivating the Shangqing dao, when the body of one’s parents, uncles, or brothers dies in the world, the body has not yet completely vanished from among the living. If the body lies dead, on the third day take a basin of clear water, one tael of true pearls, cast into the water. Facing south in the courtyard, near the water, tap teeth nine times and bless:

> Qi transforms into spirit, corpse changes and enters the mystery,  
> Three transformations and five bodies ascend to the Nine Heavens,  
> The kalpa of the Nine Heavens, passing through the armor body,  
> Armor body transforms again, becoming a true person.

When finished, for a male corpse think of three jade boys; for a female corpse think of seven jade maidens. Pour the water over the dead body, then use the water to wash hands and face, look up to heaven and spit, then softly bless:

> Heaven’s qi is now clear, human transformation is born,  
> Obtaining life in the upper heavens, nine transformations and changed form,  
> Five sufferings and three paths severed, death’s name cut off,  
> Transcending and ferrying the lost souls, returning to the southern court.

Thus the deceased is transformed again, born above the Nine Heavens, after nine years ascending to the palace of Jade Clarity. This method is wondrous, akin to the great cavern’s ferrying of the Seven Ancestors, secret of the Jade Emperor, not transmitted to the untrue. There is a golden-named imperial chart, green characters and purple script. Those who see this text must not lightly use it or recklessly tell others. The Seven Ancestors and grandparents will long close the ghost officials; the three paths and five sufferings, ten thousand kalpas without return. According to the Four Extremes Bright Methods, there are true adepts who transmit this every seven hundred years.

### Method Nine: Encountering Other Dead Corpses While Traveling the Dao

Also from the *Essential Green Scripture*

The Purple Book states: Any scholar of the upper learning, traveling the world’s roads, if suddenly encountering a dead corpse or filth on the path of the dao, one should walk twenty-four steps, stop, face north, tap teeth nine times, for male corpses think of three jade boys, for female corpses think of seven jade maidens. Then invite the king of the valley, the central imperial mushroom and pure water, to pour over the dead corpse. Soon the dead corpse transforms and is born as a living person. Then softly bless:

> Withered returns to flourishing, extinguished returns to life,  
> Obtaining life in the upper heavens, again receiving the supreme numinous,  
> The kalpa of the Nine Heavens, repeated cycles of fetus and infant,  
> Filth and burden swept away, white corpse reborn.

Then wipe the eyes twenty-one times with the hand and stop. Thus the filth qi is resolved, the dead person is transformed again, becoming a spiritual person. When encountering the twenty-four steps of walking refinement and blessing, with full merit and added virtue, one’s name is recorded in Shangqing. After twenty-four years one may ride the spirit wheel, flying through the nine mysteries.

### Method Ten: Divining the Auspiciousness of Mountain and Residence

From the Supreme Scripture *Foreign Release Scripture*

The inscription of the Nine Earths and Thirty-Six Sounds of the Cave Abyss, from the *Foreign Release Scripture*, divines the daoist’s desire to dwell in mountains or houses, determining auspiciousness or inauspiciousness.

Inscription of the Nine Earths and Thirty-Six Sounds of the Cave Abyss:

- First Layer: moist earth color, correct sound, moving sound, roaming sound, Brahman sound, each one
- Second Layer: four sounds, each one
- Third Layer: sound
- Fourth Layer: sound
- Fifth Layer: sound
- Sixth Layer: sound
- Seventh Layer: sound
- Eighth Layer: sound
- Ninth Layer: sound

To ascend a mountain to dwell or settle a home, to examine the land’s auspiciousness or inauspiciousness, on the days of Wu and Ji, write the Nine Earths and Thirty-Six Sounds from the Yellow Book on white paper, place it at the center of the dwelling, cover it with a basin, and observe for three nights. If yellow moist paper appears, great auspiciousness; if blue, there are dead spirits beneath; if white, inauspicious; if red, fear and panic; if black, there is treasure; if purple, one obtains immortals. If none of these appear, stop. One may dwell for three years safely; beyond this time, injury and harm will occur.

> Hastening to summon thousand truths, all gathering in the imperial court,  
> Taiyi looks down, twin emperors wing the form,  
> Inspecting and observing myriad evils, regulating qi and preserving life,  
> If any inauspiciousness arises, interfering with divine numinous,  
> Way of the Blue Emperor, ordering divine soldiers,

> Summoning armored steeds, martial heavenly soldiers,  
> Wind and fire battle together, slaying evil and strangling spirits,

> Nine Heavens announce commands, myriad gods respectfully listen.

When finished.

If the adept fears or trembles at night, heart shaken and mind timid, or when evil dreams occur and demons test the person, disturbing the true qi, wishing to cause illness and harm, immediately perform the Jade Emperor’s blessing for ghost guards and spirit protection. The adept must hold the supreme dao in mind, seek aid from Taiyi, face north, tap teeth thirty times, hold breath and carefully bless. When finished, tap teeth again as above, swallow saliva ten times. Thus wickedness is destroyed, demons subdued, seven gods entwined, Taiyi inspecting and guarding, myriad spirits protecting truth, outside frightening evil qi. This may be chanted daily, loudly and clearly, sitting or lying at will, to block all evil tests and seal wicked ghosts’ evil traces. When lying down to sleep, it may also be recited, making spirit peaceful and mind clear, dispelling dreams and disgust, eliminating poisons and evils, so one never fears in life. On days of chanting, no longer face north or hold breath. The holding breath secret blessing means ghosts and demons have already tested left and right, spirits have already disturbed the divine chamber, so commanding spirit life truth to gather their evil traces only. The sleeping blessing differs from this method.

### Method Twenty-Two: Daoist Teeth Tapping Regulation Method

All Shangqing teeth tapping and saliva swallowing methods have their own procedures, with order and sequence, not to be mixed or confused, lest true spirits be muddled. Tapping teeth commands the spirit, swallowing qi harmonizes truth, inhaling harmonious qi, swallowing six fluids, to circulate and control the spirit, one must sound the drum and arrange the ranks properly.

When cultivating the supreme method, during rites and blessings, always first peck the teeth, tapping upper and lower teeth together, not left and right, one breath in and one breath out, to swallow all qi and fluids. This is called calling spirit and harmonizing truth, seeking to ascend to immortality. The method of tapping teeth upper and lower together is called heavenly drum; left teeth tapping is heavenly bell; right teeth tapping is heavenly chime. To control ghosts and summon demons, one may tap bell and chime; to walk the dao and seek truth, tap heavenly drum.

---

### Method Twenty-Three: Blessing for Hearing Ear Ringing

From the Supreme Scripture *Great Possession Wonderful Scripture*

When hearing ear ringing, cover the ears with crossed hands and bless:

> Infant in the palace, nine truths in the chamber,  
> Please hear the divine command, also observe inauspiciousness,  
> Taiyi flowing fire, to extinguish myriad evils.

When finished, cover the ear gate with the hand seventeen times. When the face feels warm, this is a good sign. If cold is felt between head and neck, evil qi has entered. One should quickly lie down, close eyes, hold the mysterious elixir palace Taiyi true lord, casting flowing fire bells, dazzling and throwing them, forcing evil qi to exit the ear, firelight following behind, shining brightly illuminating the whole body, after a while calming.

---

### Method Twenty-Four: Inspecting the Auspiciousness of Ear Ringing

Also from the *Great Possession Wonderful Scripture*

If suddenly one hears the sound of rushing water, thunder and lightning, or drum ringing in the ear, it indicates bodily exhaustion, heart organ extreme damage, unable to taste true essence of life, indulgence and loss causing disorder, six organs lose control, soul and spirit wail. This portends illness and death. Hence the mud pellet disordered, nine palaces irregular, sorrow scratching and confusion, drum and bell chaotic, about to write its dwelling and abandon the body. Hearing this one must concentrate and return from confusion, focus on true heart; if the fault is not deep, one may hear and reform. Deafness is due to loss of ear spirit.

If suddenly hearing the sound of golden and jade music in the ear, true qi is entering, the dao is about to succeed. If hearing string music, six soldiers and jade maidens come to guard the dao child. One should hide and quietly cultivate the practice, diligence and sincerity increasing more than before. The true person thus gradually manifests form and vision. Unless one is a true master, do not speak of this to others.

Hearing flute and horn music is a good omen of noble arrival. Hearing shouting and crying voices is a bad omen of defeat. Hearing foul smells means there must be corpse filth. Quickly bathe, burn incense, and sweep the sleeping chamber. This is the emperor lord’s warning and admonition to people.

If hearing blood qi or seeing unexplained blood gathering, it portends military disaster. Quickly flee to the human realm, hold the Three Primes emperor lords, seek rescue, seclude and fast for three months, disaster will cease. These are all the emperor lords’ prior warnings of auspiciousness and inauspiciousness, to make people fear and guard their fortune and misfortune. When seeing ominous signs, one should practice secret virtue, engage in benevolent rescue, doing what others cannot do, what travelers cannot do, thus avoiding certain death. Take heed and do not remain ordinary.

### Method Twenty-Six: Daoist Practice of Breathing and Preserving the Three Truths

In the Upper Yuan Palace’s mud pellet, its spirit is the infant, named Yuanxian, also called Emperor Minister; in the Middle Yuan Palace’s red chamber is the heart, its spirit is the true person, named Zidan, also called Guangjian; in the Lower Yuan’s dantian palace, three cun below the navel, its spirit is infant, named Yuanyangzi, also called Guxuan. These three are the one spirit. When wishing to bind and control souls and spirits, first silently call their names, holding the three spirits all jade-colored golden light, with infant appearance; the upper two Yuan wear red, the lower Yuan wears yellow, heads like newborn infants. When walking the dao and practicing breath control, also hold their names.

### Method Twenty-Seven: Seven Injuries Forbidden by the Immortal Ban

From the Supreme Scripture *Seven Saints Mysterious Records*

Any scholar with a mysterious record and formed immortal appearance, naturally harmonizing with truth, will have:

First injury: carrying truth but acting falsely, indulging in lust loses spirit, soul and fluid leak, essence and light dry up, qi scatters and spirit flees, bones hollow and form shakes, spirit weeps in the dark palace, upper hears heavenly gate, true immortal wanders afar, thus binding with nine dusts, earth palace in accord, how can one still become immortal?

Second injury: outer form on the dao, skin good and thinking true, but heart embraces yin thief, evil and fierce within, wishing for others’ ruin, jealous and envious of the capable, mouth sweet but heart contrary, face joyful but inwardly angry, judging form and gain and loss, falsely creating crime origins, slandering fellow students, attacking teacher’s root, recorded by Three Officials as evil gate, immortal truth departs high, evil demons attack body, running as form and shadow, flying and scattering body and spirit, causing crookedness and perversity, extremely evil origin, examined to ashes, extinguishing self in nine springs, though having mysterious name, how to preserve nature?

Third injury: drinking wine and drunkenness, damaging qi and losing spirit, five organs attacked and broken, myriad gods shocked, soul and spirit scatter, inside and outside decay, original chamber empty, infant wails sadly, true immortal departs high, evil demons enter form, such learning only wastes essence and sincerity, though having mysterious record, empty chamber jade name, spirit ascends upper palace, body ashes in dark gloom, faintly seeking extension, years long halted.

Fourth injury: acting without correcting things, blaming others and revering self, heart angry and mouth shaped, cursing Jin and Wuchang, anger and joy lose measure, mind and nature deviate from norm, qi excites and spirit scatters, inner truth flies and rises, spirit leaves and soul roams, nine orifices dusty, five organs rushing to death, all from impure nature and inauspicious conduct, true immortal departs high, external illness enters form, such learning what can it cover? Though having mysterious chart, cannot escape this calamity, hoping for immortality long delayed, earth days lengthen.

Fifth injury: either mysterious chart appears, receiving precious scripture, or encountering spiritual master, opening and transmitting divine writings, but not following rules and oaths, form leaks heavenly truth, not passing nine years, casting into sharp mountains, recorded in blue palace, golden gate compiling chapters, then transmitting to others, spreading in the world, lightly revealing truth and leaking treasure, examining and binding self, only having mysterious name, instead accumulating seven mysteries, immortal dao departs high, body dies in dark springs, long filling ghost punishments, ten thousand kalpas no return.

Sixth injury: body treads corpse filth, form and shadow not fragrant, inside no purity and emptiness, outside no orchid fragrance, clear spirit loses truth, spirit does not dwell in chamber, qi disturbs essence mixture, spirit origin loses light, five spirits scatter, infant flies away, evil demons come to attack, inside and outside both lost, such learning hopes to succeed but harms instead, true immortal departs high, empty shadow walks alone, sinking into turbidness, immortality how can it be?

Seventh injury: eating all meat containing life, killing beautiful mouths, foul smells fill the organs, cutting life form not one’s own, true qi disturbs spirit gate, wandering spirits frighten infant, soul and spirit depart palace, turbid stagnation entangles mouth and teeth, immortal truth ascends Jade Clarity, self sinks heavy in earth, only having mysterious name in imperial register, also cannot escape certain death.

The High Sage Emperor Lord says: The foundation of learning is to urgently avoid the seven injuries. Once seeing the cave gate and opening the jade chapters, not violating the seven injuries’ prohibitions, one will await spirit descent, ascending by daybreak. If outwardly diligent in learning but inwardly not avoiding seven injuries, one will hope for immortality but fail, hope for life but perish, hope for auspiciousness but suffer misfortune, hope to fly but sink. Spirit immortals depart to high clarity, five spirits scatter to eight wildernesses, infant wails in the central chamber, wandering souls mourn in the mysterious void. Therefore immortal appearance has success and failure, upper learning has seven injuries. Those earnest and steadfast, who can purify their truth?

### Method Twenty-Eight: Ten Failures of Immortal Appearance

From the Supreme Scripture *Spirit Book of Purple Writings Scripture*

First failure: do not indulge in lust; lust causes soul and fluid to leak, essence and light to dry up, spirit to burn and soul to scatter, bones thin and marrow foul, soul wails in spirit palace, upper hears heavenly gate, three palaces contend, fetal essence grieves and errs. This is the first failure of immortal appearance.

Second failure: do not be a yin thief, fierce and evil; fierce and evil cause yellow court to disorder, three corpses love to kill, soul and spirit spy and plot, spirit ghosts disturb the chamber, eyes lose light and scatter, mouth produces harmful qi. This is the second failure of immortal appearance.

Third failure: do not get drunk; drunkenness causes form and substance to deteriorate, spirit and truth confused, soul forgets original chamber, spirit roams evil dwellings, infant flies and wails, throat and brain fire burns. This is the third failure of immortal appearance.

Fourth failure: do not be filthy, arrogant, and unclean; such causes clear spirit to lose truth, essence and soul do not dwell, three palaces breed worms, infant floats and wanders, blood turbid and marrow foul, spirit light lost, soul goes evil path, seeking my death book. This is the fourth failure of immortal appearance.

Fifth failure: do not eat any meat containing life; eating causes original form to lose beginning, root lost salvation, fetal spirit wails, crimson lord calls and laments, three souls painfully poisoned, spirit seeks tomb. This meat entering the mouth causes fate to fall into long night. This is the fifth failure of immortal appearance.

Sixth failure: do not eat any meat with life in water; eating causes form and spirit to violate truth, mud pellet destroyed, three palaces close gates, infants confused, souls and spirits flee, spirit seeks coffin. This is the sixth failure of immortal appearance.

Seventh failure: do not eat flying crow meat; eating causes qi and form to smell foul, essence and spirit turbid and stagnant, brain yellow and teeth dry, spleen produces death qi, soul does not receive truth, spirit generates evil vigor, body sinks into long abyss, bones buried in earth. This is the seventh failure of immortal appearance.

Eighth failure: do not eat five pungent vegetables; eating causes five organs to stink, three flowers to dissolve and disorder, spirit does not ascend, essence and fetus sink downward, soul and spirit separate, infant vexed and weary, flying spirit lost guard, eyes lose light and flee. This is the eighth failure of immortal appearance.

Ninth failure: do not kill insects and above; killing causes war against myriad things, binds corpse and blood resentment, form violent and spirit fierce, soul and qi battle, fetal spirit nearby, true child flees and scatters, mud pellet wicked and mad, infant abandons and rebels, corpse form dissolves, water boiled and fire burned. This is the ninth failure of immortal appearance.

Tenth failure: do not urinate facing north, looking up at the three lights; do not face north when cutting hair or removing clothes; do not face north when spitting or cursing, violating and destroying the king. The king means the location of king qi under the year’s branch. Do not anger the sun, moon, and stars; do not carry out punishments on the eight solar terms; do not be angry on the new moon day; do not harm turtle, dragon, scale, or shell on the six jia days; do not harm pheasants on Bingwu day; do not harm black beasts on Bingzi day; do not have other thoughts on Gengshen day, always hold thoughts of truth; do not drink wine or eat meat on Yimao day; fast and purify the mind.

Do not kill on the first month; do not eat meat on the ninth day of the second month; do not eat the hearts of all herbs on the third day of the third month; do not kill grass or cut trees on the eighth day of the fourth month; do not see blood on the fifth day of the fifth month; do not break ground on the sixth day of the sixth month; do not think evil thoughts on the seventh day of the seventh month; do not trade or wear shoes with attached insects on the fourth day of the eighth month; do not get up from bed on the ninth day of the ninth month; do not punish people on the fifth day of the tenth month; do not neglect bathing on the eleventh day of the eleventh month; do not fail to fast, burn incense, and recite truth on the last three days of the twelfth month.

Such taboos are great prohibitions of Heaven and Man, reported by the Three Officials, considered grave crimes. Sometimes causing three souls to fall ill, seven spirits to compete, or fetal spirits to hate, Three Officials receiving evil at the time. Thus evil dreams cross the cinnabar palace, demons ride the vermilion gate, essence and fluid offend, divine truth confused, transformations many and forbidden. Those who do not know taboo arts, if able to reverently cultivate, become true immortals; if not revering Heaven’s prohibitions, become injured and ruined.

### Method Thirty: Daoist Blessing for Traveling Mountains and Marshes

From the *Demon Dispelling Scripture*

When a daoist travels the Five Sacred Mountains, treading rivers and marshes, one should perform the Three Days Proper One blessing, a method to awe, summon spirits, and attract immortals. Upon first ascending a mountain, first outside the mountain tap teeth nine times, close eyes and think of five-colored clouds surging, gathering atop the mountain, with my body in the midst of the cloud qi. After a while, see the Five Prison Immortal Officials and mountain forest plants, rivers, marsh birds and beasts, all things come to pay homage. Look upward and bless:

> Supreme Emperor goes traveling, auspicious day and good hour,  
> Jade blossoms cover, Taiyi supports and commands,  
> Left wing white origin, right assists without hero,  
> Eight emperors and nine truths, rising Brahman steps prosper,  
> Guide me and send me, shine with me,  
> Treading the Five Mountains, group immortals escort,  
> Entering and exiting rivers and seas, myriad paths open,  
> Commanding and driving six soldiers, feet treading Five Phases,  
> Three heavens have command, sweeping away myriad evils,  
> Clearing and sweeping filth, flowing gold extinguishes calamity,  
> Proper law clear and open, strict as severe frost,  
> Brilliant essence shining, dragon chariot proud,  
> Flowing blue-green feathers, flying brocade robes,  
> Wherever going, nothing not auspicious and flourishing,  
> Myriads of truths come to pay homage, together ascending Jade Capital.

When finished, draw in qi thirty-six breaths and stop. Practicing this for one thousand days, one obtains the Five Mountains’ true immortals descending with cloud chariot and feather canopy, flying in the great void.

### Daoist Mountain Entry and Auspicious Day Taboos

Daoists wishing to enter mountains should choose auspicious days in March and July. Also:

- In spring, do not enter east or west mountains;  
- In summer, do not enter south or north mountains;  
- In autumn, do not enter west or east mountains;  
- In winter, do not enter north or south mountains.

Good days for mountain entry are Bao, Yi, and Zhuan days—auspicious; Zhi and Fa days are inauspicious.

- Bao days: Jiazi, Bingyin, Dingmao, Jisi, Xinwei, Renshen, Guiyou, Yihai, Gengchen, Xinchou, Gengxu, Wuwu. Auspicious.  
- Yi days: Dingchou, Bingxu, Jiawu, Gengzi, Renshen, Guimao, Yisi, Dingwei, Wushen, Ji You, Xinhai, Bingchen. Auspicious.  
- Zhuan days: Wuchen, Jichou, Wuxu, Bingwu, Guizi, Jiayin, Gengyin, Xinmao, Yiwei, Bingshen, Dingyou, Jihai. Auspicious.  
- Zhi days: Yichou, Jiaxu, Wuwu, Wuzi, Guisi, Ji Ch en, Gengyin, Xinmao, Yiwei, Bingshen, Dingyou, Jihai. Inauspicious.  
- Fa days: Gengwu, Bingzi, Wuyin, Ji Mao, Xin Si, Guimei, Ji Shen, Yi You, Dinghai, Renchen, Guichou, Renxu. Inauspicious.

If a daoist suddenly encounters evil and inauspiciousness, tap the heavenly bell thirty-six times, tapping left teeth.

If a daoist passes through mountains, performing great blessings to repel demons and awe gods, tap the heavenly chime thirty-six times, tapping right teeth.

If holding thoughts of the dao, summoning truth and spirits, tap heavenly drum thirty-six times, tapping upper and lower teeth.

Whenever a daoist lodges alone in mountain forests and is often tested by mountain spirits and evil ghosts, tap teeth twenty-seven times, hold breath and bless:

> Last night I was summoned by the emperor,  
> Commanding true origin, ordering me to seal and govern this mountain,  
> Crushing and cutting Feng Mountain, myriad spirits obey,  
> All gather before the emperor, seven gods open separation,  
> Three Primes govern truth, if any small demon arises, immediately beheaded,  
> Mountain spirits and marsh commanders, quickly come to serve and welcome,  
> Divine masters obey commands, report to Three Pure Ones,  
> As in the great cavern method, no delay allowed.

When finished, tap teeth twenty-seven times downward. This is the emperor lord’s supplementary divine blessing to strike mountain spirits and a hundred ghosts. The mountain gods, earth deities, and ancestral shrine masters hearing this blessing all hold whips and come to welcome, divine soldiers attend and guard, as if lodging with thousands.

### Additional Notes on Immortal Kings and Demon Tests

Those who receive third-grade upper dao or have not yet ascended to the Three Pure Ones, receiving the title of immortal king, are often tested by heavenly demons and disturbed by myriad spirits. They should chant the demon-dispelling blessing, raising the spirit sound of the upper heavens, summoning the awe gods of the Three Realms below, binding myriad spirits at the heavenly bell, slashing demons at the cave seal. Practicing this method, always face north, first imagine the nape as a round image like the sun, with vermilion phoenix on the left, mysterious black dragon on the right, purple haze covering, light illuminating the form, immortal boys and jade maidens holding five-colored banners, from the myriad gods of the Three Realms, nine phoenixes cry out ahead, eight luan birds blow behind, white dragons open the path, Supreme Ultimate participates in the pavilion. When finished, tap left teeth thirty-six times, then right teeth twenty-four times, then upper and lower teeth twelve times, and bless:

> Net of poisonous beasts, guarding four great gates,  
> Swallowing and sinking, cutting gall,  
> Mountain ugly myriad hordes, opening jaws and roaring to heaven,  
> Fierce horses galloping high, poisonous dragons brandishing claws,  
> Golden heads crosswise swallowing, mighty soldiers myriad,  
> Receiving talisman to check immortals, six heavens unrestrained,  
> Gathering evils into groups, demons roar and howl,  
> Filthy qi swirling, empty songs hollow, chaotic sounds in the city,  
> Little ghosts manifest forms, approaching life gates,  
> Divine kings announce, no hidden place unheard,  
> Above capturing six qi, below inspecting river sources,  
> Five mountains and four rivers, good and evil swiftly divided,  
> Ten thousand thousands come before me,  
> Five emperors record, those meritorious spared,  
> Wicked demons disturb truth, true form emperor lord, dare not disobey command,  
> Those punished without mercy, gutting liver and gutting belly, beheading and destroying root,  
> Northern cauldron boiling soup, southern hill fire rage,  
> Golden truth records qi, flowing bells capture souls,  
> Demons and spirits none escape, exhausting form’s origin,  
> Wearing heavenly book, dao practice proper text,  
> Cleansing nine qi, clear and bright three primes,  
> Mysterious void raises truth, above harmonizes with nature,  
> None dare interfere or change report above.

When finished, draw qi twelve breaths and stop.

This is the right wisdom demon-dispelling blessing.

Any scholar traveling famous mountains, lodging among myriad ghosts, trembling in fear, or infants with illness, guarded by ghosts at the gate, reciting this once will be like boiling ice in a cauldron, molten gold on fire, soul and spirit clear and correct, qi peaceful and body strong. Unless fate decrees otherwise, death will not come.
