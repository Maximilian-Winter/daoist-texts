## Scripture of the Jade Forest of the Immortal Mansion of Supreme Clarity

The scripture states: Heaven has a Mysterious One, born from the Great Sun, named Flowing Pearl, the gate to myriad marvels; if one attains and preserves it, one may gain longevity. Humans have a Three-One, residing in different places; if one can guard it together, one may become an Immortal King. One dwells in the Northern Pole’s Great Abyss, before it a Bright Hall, below a Crimson Palace, above a Floral Canopy, and a jade tower ten thousand layers high.

It further says Purple Yang Zhenren spoke: “In former times I studied the dao, receiving the True Names of the Three-One from Zhongyue Zhenren Su Zixuan. Zixuan taught me the method to guard the One, over two hundred matters in all. I faithfully practiced them and became a Supreme Clarity Zhenren; my dao is supremely true.”

It also says: “The twenty-four qi correspond to the twenty-four True Ones of the Supreme Subtlety. They have thousands of chariots and ten thousand riders, feathered canopies and cloud carriages, to unite with the Purple Palace’s Supreme Clarity Primordial Chart. If one guards it ever more firmly, with spirit responding and feeling smooth, then the Three-One may be seen; if the Three-One is seen, then the thousands of chariots and ten thousand riders appear. The feathered canopy may be ridden, the cloud carriage may be mounted, ascending to Supreme Subtlety, blending the twenty-four qi, seeing the twenty-four True Ones, flying through Supreme Clarity, inscribing names on the Primordial Chart. This is the white sun ascending to Heaven, also practicing the way of the Cavern Chamber.”

It further says: “The highest truth of the Supreme One, the utmost of the Middle One, the marvel of the Lower One. The Heavenly Sovereign attains the utmost and thus becomes the Supreme August Sovereign; the Earthly Sovereign attains the utmost and thus becomes the True One; the Human Sovereign attains the marvel and thus becomes Lord of the Myriad Marvels. The Three Sovereigns embody the True to guard the One; thus the One conceals no form. Immortals seek the True to find the One; thus the Three-One are all luminous. The One conceals no form—that is its supreme truth; the Three-One all luminous—one only needs to attain the One.”

The *Record of the Primordial Transformations of the Supreme True* says: “The August Sovereign opens the True, the nine paths unite in brightness, transforming and refining the primal void, reflecting the Supreme Clarity, dividing forms and transforming images, the four motions follow birth, the eight scenes support the wings, moving the cinnabar chariot, riding clouds and driving smoke, controlling Supreme Clarity, flying through cloud chambers, paying homage at the imperial capital.” It further says: “Whoever cultivates the way of the Nine Heavens True King, always on the winter solstice bathes and enters the chamber, facing west, bows nine times, greeting the Nine Heavens True King, naturally gaining to ride the nine-colored cloud carriage, flying through Supreme Clarity.” It also says: “The Nine Heavens’ Supreme Spirit, Primordial Beginning of Nature, and so forth. The central treasure is the Purple Origin, wrapped by three simples outside, and so forth. Entering the cavern transformation into subtlety, my dao is early divided; the eyes summon numinous brilliance, the heart unfolds five clouds, riding the staff through eight scenes, flying into the imperial dawn.” It also says: “Containing true progeny qi, form refined in the Purple Heaven, riding clouds and driving floating smoke, bathing in the light of eight smokes, and so forth. One gains to ride the celestial chariot, flying to ascend the jade dawn.” It also says: “The palace of the seven reflections of the Jade Forest.” It also says: “Inside it contains the immortal spirit, outside it refines the true visage, jade pools and floral dew, moistening the purple chambers.” It also says: “The Supreme Jade Dawn, returning light to the void brightness, dividing forms to transform and unite, nine refinements of the three truths.”

It further says: “The prayer of the Three Primal Lords of the Supreme Primordial Great Simplicity’s morning radiance: ‘The three simples return to the heavenly origin, clear skies wing the jade spirit,’ and so forth. Though the great rosy clouds spread far, the cavern reflection mirror has feeling; together they clasp the jade pact, sharing the journey of the nine heavenly chariots.” It also says: “The great simplicity moves the staff, four scenes fly in the void.” It also says: “The august clarity scatters morning radiance, numinous qi wings the void and shifts, drifting above the nine origins, softly entering the imperial dawn.” It also says: “The four elders of the middle truth scatter flowers in the cloud chambers.” It also says: “The mysterious dawn carries the high spirit, the complete truth commands the eight clarities, jade blossoms spread in the cinnabar chambers, purple phoenixes shine in the cloud camp.” It also says: “I ride the auspicious sun, reporting to the imperial spirit, seeking to ascend and fly, gaining to ride the flowing chariot.” It also says: “The Purple August Primordial, dao unites the mysterious void, three transformations and nine divisions, blending and transforming the great beginning, flying clouds and flowing auxiliaries, azure canopy and green carriage.” It also says: “The night sky is clear and bright, the secluded void opens the True, drifting clouds linger, golden flowers fourfold, the cinnabar sovereign spreads radiance, clouds fly the purple pavilion.”

The *Supreme Jade Scripture Treasure Instructions* says: “Ascending jade clarity, inviting the nine distant expanses.” It also says: “The numinous wind fans floral fragrance, splendidly opening abundant pride, the Supreme True caresses the cloud bell, myriad immortals pluck the numinous zither, elegant songs of the three heavenly scenes, scattering grace in the jade forest.” It also says: “Learning the dao through cinnabar faith, serving the master as closest kin, drawing in the radiance of the pure void, diligently following daily renewal, straightening the body to ascend Supreme Clarity, transcending the scene to roam the nine skies, preserving the origin and holding the law’s thread, wandering the mysterious to reach carefree ease, ten thousand kalpas like last night, a thousand springs like morning, the numinous banner follows the wind to scatter, abundant thoughts respond and vanish in time.”

The *Great Cavern True Scripture* says: “The great banquet surpasses the nine mysteries, the cavern scene entrusts divine power, the Jade Emperor rides the vermilion sky, green clouds shine on golden ramparts, the upper pavilion within cloud pearls, gazing upward to the Primordial Blade Peak.” It also says: “The flowing pearl halts the radiance, purple clouds leap in smoke, sevenfold circuit, three lights reflect the True.”

The *Supreme Simple Spirit Cavern Profound Great Abundance Scripture* says: “Reveling in the numinous cavern, feasting on the seven dawns’ scene, clear and pure in the floral garden, resting in the nine mysteries, transforming the scene into jade void, leading all heavens.” It also says: “The Supreme True Yin Spirit, called the Female Spirit, transforms the nine mysteries’ scene, riding the True’s hidden darkness, moving to bring flying rosy clouds, ascending to the imperial court.”

The scripture further says: “The nine mysteries and nine heavens are said to be above the Three Realms.” It also says: “Playing on the nine mystery terraces, resting at the western feather river.” It also says: “The eight scenes move the heavenly chariot.”

The *Great Cavern True Scripture* says: “Crimson clouds block the bright radiance, eight scenes fly in the great void.” It also says: “The eight wishes’ mysterious mother journeys with me between the three mysteries, then loosens reins in the great desert, turning the chariot through the three mysteries, five spirits support the back, the Queen Mother stands shoulder to shoulder, dancing the wheel on the divine hill, pausing the carriage in the nine heavens.”

The *Cavern Chamber Inner Scripture* says: “The boundless high True, morning in the vermilion court, dragon robes and tiger belts, reading the Great Cavern True Scripture, roaming the nine heavens, grand assembly of the seven voids. Riding the void’s flowing chariot, reins of the great sky’s round carriage.” It also says: “I blend the five qi within, jointly transforming to ride the sun chariot, feasting beyond the cloud heights, breathing the seven spirits’ essence, coiling the cypress in the nine mysteries, sitting up born on the rosy clouds.” Text from the *Five Elders Female One Scripture*.

The *Three Primal True One Scripture* says: “Left spurs the cloud wheel, right drives the flying dragon, looking up to serve the twenty-four gods, thousands of chariots and ten thousand riders, calling yang and summoning yin, white sun ascending to Heaven.”

The *Turtle Mountain Primordial Register* says: “At dawn soaring to the sun observatory, at dusk resting hidden in the Lang Wind. It also says: Immortals play amid cloud scenes, cinnabar blossoms spread spring sun, the august carriage pauses among cloud companions, drifting freely soaring, gazing beyond the eight extremes, who can fathom the length of its movement? It also says: The Three Primal Lords each follow the four seasons’ changing forms, thus returning to their primordial qi, receiving refinement to restore form.”

The *Great Cavern True Scripture* says: “Northern ridge dense with cloud mists, crimson trees bear purple blossoms, green medicines fall in the phoenix forest, jade cliffs and elegant rock caves, numinous palaces soar in the great void, jade chambers join the great rosy clouds, and so forth. Dragons blow entwined five clouds, and so forth. Rosy clouds flourish the morning sky.”

The *Jade Pendant and Golden Earrings Scripture* says: “Golden earrings above the nine heavens, named Rainbow Reflection, also called the Supreme Clarity’s pavilion, within the great sky, gathering white smoke qi, numinous reflections in the nine heavens, and so forth. Color like white clouds, form like jade mountains, with the palace of the Jade Forest. It also says: The nine heavens’ imperial lords reside within the sun gate’s golden court. It also says: The jade pendant contains the nine heavens’ soul essence, above the nine heavens named Morning Lamp, and so forth. Gathering the azure yang qi, numinous reflections in the nine heavens, and so forth. Color like blue jade, form like a full moon, within is empty mystery, jade platform and purple palace. It also says: Sun radiance and moon essence, sun rosy clouds and moon reflections, left turns the jade pendant, right holds the golden earring, the two scenes entwined, double souls at peace, ascending the Great Ultimate above, descending to the Ten Directions below.”

The *Purple Book Golden Root Scripture* says: “The Azure Essential Sovereign commands all nine heavens, summoning the five emperors’ spirits, drifting back the blended winds, condensing nine revolutions in the mysterious essence.” It also says: “The Supreme Lord and Lady wear nine mysterious jade essence piled clouds on their heads, dwelling atop Supreme Clarity’s nine mysteries. This is also a platform, within the nine heavens’ cavern primordial supreme true palace.”

The *Great Cavern True Scripture* says: “Drifting over the three rosy ridges, circling the seven primordial canopies, eight scenes enter the great void, flying and scattering beyond the nine heavens. Jade doors give birth to scene clouds, numinous smoke cuts through secluded mists, the western palace chants the cavern profound, clear songs support the Fusang horizon.” It also says: “Seven gates shine flowing rosy clouds, jade chambers birth dragon clouds, left reins the three simples, right strokes the eight scenes’ wheel.” It also says: “Left holds the jade floral canopy, flying scenes ascend the seven primordials.”

The *Supreme Flying Jade Scripture* says: “Ascending the heavenly lodges, flying among the nine stars, left holds the hidden book, right grasps the feather scripture, paying homage to the imperial sovereign, receiving the emperor’s name, gaining to surpass the floral canopy, soaring to the purple court.” It also says: “Driving scene purple smoke, flying steps through the nine primordials.” It also says: “The five imperial consorts’ inner hidden names, Supreme Hidden in the mysterious Dipper’s purple canopy palace, these five consorts all turn heaven and earth, expanding and contracting the three lights, transforming mountains and rivers, changing the Five Phases, moving myriad things, hiding the netherworld; those who know their dao no longer pass through the earth’s gate, their souls cross Mount Tai.” It also says: “Dao qi has no light, vast and boundless, primordial chaos’s original form, void and natural, Supreme has no root, dark silence and mysterious communication.” It also says: “At the great kalpa’s turning, the highest true sovereign gods and wondrous acting zhenren descend to tour the Five Peaks, directly observing the world’s highest learners, the great flood filling the sky, all greeted by five dragons, ascending to blessed lands, gaining to roam with the Primordial Beginning.”

The *Lingbao Scripture* says: “Wondrous Acting Zhenren, countless in number, gather at once, the land all molten gold irrigating the earth, the four borders’ steps all jade and lapis lazuli treasures, the four circuits arranged strictly, brightness penetrating thoroughly.” It also says: “Primordial Heavenly Sovereign at the blue void sings over the great floating Li country, seated atop the blue mist, the earth all jade, the four borders’ steps all gold, silver, and treasures, various marvels.” It also says: “Chanli world, red bright country, southern garden Danhuo’s nook, three primal cavern chambers, Heavenly Sovereign seated on crimson clouds, utmost true great god, great cinnabar jade maiden, all gather at Danhuo’s nook, their land always producing red qi, like crimson clouds.”

The method of guarding the One is to always drink little and eat lightly, avoiding pork, fish, and foul foods; all food and drink should follow the four seasons’ warmth and coolness, never against the times.

The method of guarding the One cautions: be careful not to drink turbid wine. Turbid wine damages one’s essence and the five viscera’s life qi; essence and qi do not flow, blood vessels do not connect.

The *Scripture of the Purple Sovereign of the Supreme Emperor* says: “Divine Land lies north of the Heavenly Pass, the sun and moon revolve, to its south seven stars revolve within.”

The *Supreme Clarity Scripture* says: “Meditate on the Three Primal within the Mud Pellet, guard the Nine Truths within the form’s dwelling, exhale and inhale the five blossoms, breathe the jade liquid, morning and evening seek immortality in the void cavern, sleeping and resting sense spirits in the great desert.” It also says: “Those who serve it ascend the three dawns, roam the great sky.” It also says: “The Great Cavern Scripture is the wondrous secret of the Nine Heavens, the chief scripture of the Supreme Primordial Lord’s golden writings. In ancient times the Central Yellow Old Lord concealed this book, the time’s origin knew it, only the Supreme Mysterious had golden towers, jade names, jade slips, and purple slips. Reading this chapter ten thousand times, one may ascend the white sun to Heaven, ascend Supreme Clarity, receive the Great Ultimate book, and be appointed High Supreme Minister. But those who have this book yet do not read it, the Supreme Subtle Heavenly Emperor Lord draws out death slips, carves and sets the true register, counts the Great Ultimate, engraves the name East Splendor, seals and reports to the Supreme, records and seals the Turtle Terrace, myriad spirits and thousand gods call themselves the Nine Mysteries’ Grand Masters, their rank equal to Supreme Clarity’s Immortal Elders.”

The *Great Cinnabar Hidden Profound Five Dawn Golden Radiance Jade Scripture* says: “The Mysterious Mother’s Eight Gates chapter says: ‘May the Mysterious Mother be born with me amid the life qi, exist with me between sun and moon, protect with me among the nine heavens, dwell with me in nature, drink with me by the gourd river, rest with me among the jade truths, sleep with me in the immortal hall, roam with me between the three mysteries.’” It also says: “The Nine Heavens’ imperial lords’ twelve great vows, the Nine Spirits’ Mysterious Mother’s eight gates’ spirits, great return to the origin’s five communications, quiet in the secret chamber, scattering incense and stove smoke, while reading the Great Cavern Golden Radiance Scripture.”

The *Advanced Cavern Chamber Inner Scripture* says: “Kunlun is high yet does not incline, where immortals dwell, golden halls and jade cities, nine qi separate and unite, cloud and rain obscure and dark, yellow towers and purple gates, utmost mysterious essence, rising to pierce the rosy clouds, shining down on the nine spirits, left connects the azure palace, right guards the bright clarity, golden terrace and eight simples, roaming and transforming myriad forms, jade nectar pure liquid, jade liquid self-born, six harmonies’ secluded gate, eight pavilions meet the scripture, within is the Supreme True, utmost unnamable, subtle without center, called No Flower.”

It also says: “In former times Chang’an’s Li Zhong knew no other dao, nor the practice of the Great Cinnabar’s affairs, the Three Primal’s method. Only a corner attained this hidden morning dao, guarded and practiced for thirty years, gaining to ride clouds and drive swiftly, ascending into the mysterious isles. Immortals such as King Wang Lü Bing, Zhao Shuangcheng, Fan Shuyou, Guan Pinghe, Li Mingxian, An Sheng and their like all attained this dao and ascended to Kunlun’s chambers, or dwell in the three mysteries’ palace in the mysterious isles.”

It also says: “The Great Simplicity Three Primal Lord is a single true woman, wearing purple qi floating cloud brocade cape, nine-colored dragon brocade feather skirt, building a precious jade staff morning feather crown, waist flowing gold and fire bells, tiger tally and dragon script, sitting in the void, beneath her knees always the cinnabar green blue three simples’ clouds, luxuriantly crowning her form. The Great Simplicity Three Primal Lord often chants: ‘Great Origin links jade clarity, three caverns shine brightly, eight scenes return morning wind, scattering clouds hover flying spirits, round wheel cast in the void cavern, gold reflects the crown’s heavenly essence, jade blossoms bind the five elders, purple smoke shines the rosy chariot, riding qi stirring the mysterious chamber, golden form shining nine rosy clouds.’ This is the Supreme Jade Palace’s song.”

The *Jade Dawn Bright Mirror Scripture* says: “The White Simple Right Primal Lord is the mother of the White Primal Cavern Yang Lord, child of the Great Simplicity Three Primal Lord, named Qiming Xiao Ren, styled Golden Gate Superior, always exhaling white qi from the mouth, named Jade Dawn White Treasure’s living soul qi, to fumigate my body, making one immortal and undying.”

The Yellow Simple Central Primal Lord is the mother of the Central Yellow Old Lord, child of the Great Simplicity Three Lords, named Yuanhua Huang Ren, styled Great Zhang Superior, titled Sun Yellow Simple High Primal Lord, having golden essence, exhaling yellow qi from the mouth, named Jade Dawn Yellow Treasure Great Spirit’s five viscera qi, to fumigate my body, enabling one to fly as an immortal ascending to Heaven.

The Purple Simple Left Primal Lord is the mother of the Elemental Lord, child of the Great Simplicity Three Primal Lords, named Yi Chuan Wu Ren, styled An Lai Superior, spirit mirror of eight directions, appearing as a young infant, exhaling purple qi from the mouth, named Jade Dawn Purple Treasure Life Fetus Flowing Cloud’s scene smoke, to fumigate my body, enabling one to ascend the white sun morning, reaching the Supreme Jade Palace. This is a sectional excerpt; the full text is contained in the scripture.

It also says: “Each of the Three Simple Primal Lords’ necks bears a precious radiance, sun qi nine-colored, round light shining through the golden flower cavern chamber’s single room. Each of the Three Simple Primal Lords exhales qi as above; the three qi merge, entwining and binding, transforming into one sun image nine cun in size, within the golden flower cavern chamber.”

It also says: “Supreme Jade Dawn, nine subtle guides of smoke, five elders scatter scenes, eight spirits give birth to gates, three simple precious qi, Supreme Mysterious Jade Dawn, golden flower female one, within is the purple origin, blending and transforming seven and nine, ascending clouds and so forth, three above three qi, entering void and exiting cinnabar, always with the purple simple, together listed among jade immortals.”

The *Great Cavern Female One Great Ultimate Five Elder Emperor Lord Scripture of Guarding Life’s Five Viscera* says: “The Great Ultimate Golden Flower Zhenren carved this scripture text on the eastern wall window of the Heavenly Emperor’s Purple Tenuity Palace’s Mysterious Jade Hall. Its text says: ‘Five qi in different directions, ferrying light to form shape, having an end and death, having a beginning and birth, myriad kinds return to root, thousand strands return to darkness, qi floats as smoke, blood rushes flowing clear, alas the destined body.’ After this, it is taken as the cinnabar formula for taking elixirs.”

It also says: “Yunnan Mountain Zhenren said: ‘I once had an inner disciple immortal Zhao Chengzi, who first received my Scripture of Guarding Life’s Five Viscera, then wrote it down. Later Chengzi wished to return to the Great Yin, seeking to change form and shape, but died in Youzhou Shanggu’s Mysterious Hill beneath a stone chamber. Five years after death, a mountain traveler saw white bones in the chamber, exposed skeleton in the dark chamber, also saw the five viscera in the belly, self-generated and unrotting as before, five-colored flowers shining within. The mountain traveler sighed: ‘Once heard the five viscera can nourish to the point of imperishability; now seeing white bones with flowers in the chest, this person surely had the dao but did not complete it, failed the midway trial.’ The traveler touched it, seeing each of the five viscera held a white stone, guarding life’s five-colored flowers, their forms present. The traveler said: ‘The reason your five viscera do not decay is because of these five stones producing flowers; you have already attained the dao, we can share it.’ Then took and swallowed them. Four or five years later, Chengzi’s corpse was about to revive; the traveler first took the stones, and on Chengzi’s revival dawn, the five stones all flew out of the mouth like cicadas, faint thunder sounds, five-colored illuminating the sun, directly returning to the corpse’s viscera. Thus Chengzi changed form and rose, as if waking from a night’s drunken sleep. The traveler’s heart was fearful and confused, falling ill severely, then entered the mountain to see where the corpse lay. Before the stone chamber, he saw Chengzi reclining and howling in the cave, face shining with jade light, and asked: ‘Who are you?’ Suddenly five elder immortals appeared, wearing brocade belts and talismans, riding feather staffs, heads crowned in purple, saying to Chengzi: ‘The one who stole and swallowed the master’s five viscera precious stones is this person.’ After speaking, the traveler’s face grew ugly with leprosy, lost speech, and upon returning home, the leprosy spread all over; the whole family, young and old, died together, and the clan was destroyed.”

It also says: “Those who regularly take the sun and moon’s essence desire to often eat bamboo shoots; bamboo shoots are the sun’s radiance fetus, also called Great Bright. They also desire to often eat wild goose meat; wild goose is the moon fetus’s feathered crow, also called moon heron. To take sun and moon, one must eat these things, qi responds and connects.”

The Great Void Zhenren said: “The term ‘wild goose’ is the general name for the feathered clan; magpies, geese, swans, and thrushes are all called wild geese and herons.”

An ancient song says: “Wild geese and herons live a thousand years, as delicacies to attain heavenly truth, the Five Emperors hold moon radiance in their mouths, seated as guests in the void.” This is the ancient fisherman’s song.

The *Jade Dawn Bright Mirror Scripture* says: “It also stores the five gods’ names, each seated in their palace. The five gods all exhale purple qi, entwining my body, inside and outside merging in darkness, hands and feet unseen until stopping. It also stores the sun and moon emerging from my cheeks, left sun right moon, two lights piercing through, then the purple qi suddenly clears, and slowly the sun enters my mouth, which immediately tastes sweet, nine swallowing stops. It also stores the moon entering my navel, at the life gate, shining down on the yin chamber. Between this, it stores my hand holding the handle of the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper, wearing it while walking, entering the purple chamber of Supreme Subtlety, seeing the imperial lord who says: ‘Your attainment of immortality, I give you the azure jade talisman, written with the nine heavens.’”

Coiling within the nine mysteries, rising and sitting born on rosy clouds, five talismans given to the imperial son, ascending to return to the floral infant. It also says: “Three and five oppose, heaven covers earth’s beginning, I have five talismans, ascending to the imperial son, three never remain long, within the chamber.” Above is from the *Five Elders Female One Scripture*.

The *Profound Mysterious Inner Chapter* says: “The Supreme says: The Primordial Dao originally arises without precedence, ancestor of myriad qi, origin of myriad dao, above the void, before non-being, without form or image, neither existence nor non-existence, honored beyond existence, precious beyond measure.”

The *Jade Dawn Bright Mirror Scripture* says: “The Supreme One Emperor Lord’s cavern true mysterious scripture stores the five gods’ methods, also stores the gods Taiyi, Wuying, Baiyuan, Siming, Taojun and others, in all five female gods and nine male gods, named the three five nine seven. Upon reaching the mysterious gate, their forms all resemble newborn infants, five females and nine males each exhale white qi from their mouths, mutually fumigating the destined body. Then the five females and nine males merge into one body, blending into one unity, all becoming one white qi round shape, like the sun’s light in a round cluster. In a moment the round light white qi transforms into two small children, one male and one female, both like newborn infants. The male is called the True of the Nine Origins, the female called the Soul of the August One; the male named Juzhi, styled Three Yang, the female named Shanggui, styled Imperial Son. In a moment again appear the boy Juzhi and girl Shanggui, both standing in the sun and moon, the boy in the sun, the girl in the moon, sun and moon suspended in the August Heaven, sun in the east, moon in the west. At that time one feels one’s body has merged into the white qi. Also heard the boy Juzhi in the sun chanting: ‘Juzhi Three Yang, True of Nine Origins, this is my name, the sun binds my body, talisman record of jade clarity, close to heaven, blending male and female, immortals entwined.’ Also heard the girl Shanggui in the moon chanting: ‘Shanggui Imperial Son, Soul of August One, this is my name, moon binds my essence, master of talisman record, already in great brightness, close to mystery, lifespan ten thousand billion years, blending male and female, naked and splendid.’”

The *Han Wu Inner Transmission* says: “The Queen Mother of the West bestowed the Emperor the *True Shape Chart of the Five Mountains’ Numinous Radiance Birth Scripture*, the August Lady bestowed the Emperor the *Six Jia Spirit Flying Summoning Truth* twelve matters, and so forth. Sometimes riding the void stepping the mysterious technique, all essential wondrous words, the Emperor personally compiled into one scroll, and all received matters were sealed in a golden box, enclosed in a white jade case, with coral as bed, purple brocade as pouch, placed on the beam platform, repeatedly worshiped, incense burned, sprinkled and swept. The Emperor and Empress’s will was mistaken, not observing the highest precepts, always disobeying the Queen Mother’s words, so the Queen Mother no longer came. At the beginning of time, heavenly fire burned the beam platform, and the twelve received matters were thus lost.”

The *Transformation Form Hidden Scene Ascending and Preserving Immortality Supreme Scripture* says: “Storing the Nine Dawn Emperor Lord’s Hidden Consort’s nine yin inner name, form, color, and clothing, all made bright, coming from the Northern Dipper, descending the fiery flow’s reflection, shining brilliantly in the void, turning spirit and mysterious reflection, entering my body. The Nine Dawn are the nine stars’ essence.” The *Purple Degree Fiery Radiance Scripture* says the same.

The *True Decrees* say: “The Lady of the Southern Mountain says the *Treasure Spirit Scripture* is in Pei Qingling’s brocade pouch, always carried by the attendant; Pei formerly received this scripture from the Purple Tenuity Lady. I also have it, written thus in the Western Palace’s fixed edition.” Asked where the Western Palace is, the answer was: “It is the Northern Altar of the Mysterious Garden, on the Western Jade Terrace; the Heavenly True treasure writings are all stored within.” Pei Zhenren also said this is the same as the Hidden and Secret peers’ essential matters, and can be used immediately, also called the Seven Hidden Mysterious Scripture.

The *True Decrees* say: “On the night of the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month, the Purple Tenuity King’s Lady descended, then came to earth to ask the True Spirit and so forth, daring to consult here, wishing to enlighten the ignorant. The Lady then ordered to sit again, immediately seeing the command order book, replying: ‘The vast scene is void and mysterious, no path to seek, words issuing from the void, nothing to pursue,’ and so forth. Therefore, releasing the primordial ferry, riding the wind and beating the oar, existing on the void boat and traveling, thus the void within the real, having the image within the void. As for the book’s traces, they are brushed on paper slips and so forth. The exposed skeletal things can advance and retreat with the world, above blemishing the immortal’s chant, below lacking the forbidden barrier, also not practiced by us, nor allowed by numinous law. Please present the origin of the book. After creation began, the five colors first sprouted, the literary forms all settled in their excellence, people’s interactions separated, yin and yang divided, there are the Three Primal Eight Assemblies flying heavenly books, also the eight dragon spirit seals shining bright chapters. Later, reaching the Three Sovereigns’ era, the Eight Assemblies’ text evolved into dragon and phoenix chapters, condensing and simplifying seal script traces, taken as the proper form of Brahmi script, dividing and breaking the two paths, destroying truth from ease, matching separate branches, thus becoming the sixty-four kinds of books, spreading through the thirty-six heavens, ten directions, above and below, and so forth. Checking and discussing, the Eight Assemblies’ books are the utmost truth of the scriptures, the origin of literary form. Now the Three Primal Eight Assemblies books are used by the Jade Emperor, Great Ultimate High True Immortals, the cloud seal bright chapters, are the characters of the divine spirit talisman books now seen.”

The *True Decrees* say: “The Lady of the Southern Mountain tells disciples: ‘Tomorrow I will go to Wangwu Mountain’s Clear Void Palace, letting you know where I go.’”

The *True Decrees* say: “The Purple Clear True Consort sat long without speaking, holding three dates in her hand, colored like dried dates but elongated, with no pit inside, also without date flavor, somewhat like pear taste. The consort first gave one, then gave one to the Purple Tenuity Lady, keeping one herself, ordering each to eat it fully. The True Consort asked the years, Deng answered, and so forth. The True Consort further said: ‘The Lord Master Southern True Lady governs fate and holds power, the dao is high and wondrously complete, truly the root of good virtue.’”

The *True Decrees* say: “On the night of the twenty-sixth day of the sixth month, eight zhenren descended: Purple Tenuity Left Lady, Purple Clear Upper Palace Nine Splendor True Consort two, Supreme True Fate Southern Mountain Lady three, Purple Yang Zhenren four, Clear Spirit Zhenren five, Mao Zhong Jun six, Mao Xiao Jun seven. Also one god, very little arranged, wearing a lotus crown, red clothes with sword, never seen before, suspected to be Prince Qiao of Mysterious Paulownia Mountain Zhenren. Much discussion of Golden Court Mountain matters, many unexplained words, respectfully the Purple Tenuity Supreme True Nine Splendor Consort all bowed and greeted. The official Supreme True said: ‘Yesterday with Uncle Shen went to Clear Void Palace, checking the true immortals’ gains and losses only. Recently removed forty-seven people, all restored to three persons, also rechecked your names and lists, now good, permitting so-and-so to be in the official register, so-and-so is the chief historian’s name.’ The sun is the fruit of the rosy clouds, the clouds are the sun’s essence. Though you have heard of taking the sun’s fruit method, you have not seen knowing to eat the clouds’ essence. The scripture of eating clouds is very secret, the way to attain clouds is very easy, this is called embodying jade light, cloud reflecting Supreme Clarity’s method. The eyes are the body’s mirror, the ears the body’s window; too much seeing dims the mirror, too much hearing darkens the window. I have the stone to polish the mirror, the method to clear the window, then one can thoroughly penetrate all spirits, see faintly and hear absolutely, is it possible?”

The *True Decrees* say: “Langye is the prefecture of Lang Wind. Above Kunlun are nine prefectures, called nine palaces; the Great Ultimate is the Great Palace. All immortals are but officials of the nine offices; as for zhenren, they are the nobles of the nine palaces. Immortal officials have ranks above and below, each with orders and ranks; immortals have left and right offices, with left and right dukes, left and right ministers, left and right inspectors. The Ming Great Cavern are immortal ministers, taking golden cinnabar are dukes, taking ganoderma are inspectors; if one attains the Great Ultimate hidden ganoderma, then one becomes left immortal lord and zhenren.”

Zhenren said: “People follow customs to seek splendid names, like burning incense, all hear its fragrance but do not know the smoke; they think once the flame is spent the qi is gone, once the name is established the body perishes. Therefore, the high ones laugh and keep distance, thus becoming pure and quiet.” Also said: “It is like riding an ice chariot in the fiery state, drifting a fire boat to wave on the drowning ford. Without true reality, one loses ten thousand times.”

The *True Decrees* say: “Zhang Jiangzi and others first entered the second rank, also beginning to enter the easy transition only. The easy transition child’s first and second palaces are the male and female dao halls, quiet inside, the Eastern Sea Azure Lord visits twice a year, inspecting these palaces, observing and seeing the multitudes.”

Zhao Sutai, in the easy transition for already four hundred years, unwilling to move, claiming no place in the world is more joyful. Sutai is Zhao Xi’s daughter; Xi was Youzhou governor in Han times, helping the poor in the river, saving Yu Hui and others from clan execution, performing dozens of acts of hidden virtue, thus her body attained to Zhu Ling; her sons now all dwell in the cavern heavens. Xi often came and went in the fixed register office.

In the easy transition are lofty yet desolate ones: Dou Qiongying, Han Taihua, Liu Chunlong, Wang Jinxiang, Li Xizi, Guo Shuxiang. These several all have heavenly talent and elegant refinement, clear and lofty, talents reaching surpassing, bearing startling the multitudes; these are the masters of the high, immortal officials’ talents.
