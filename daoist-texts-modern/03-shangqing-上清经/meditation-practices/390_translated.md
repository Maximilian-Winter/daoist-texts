## The Great Clarity Perfected Person’s Binding Life Formula

The Yellow Elder said: The soul is not merely the soul; it is our ghost. The ghost is what precedes the person. Where there is qi, there is soul. The soul as ghost guards our soul¹. The corporeal soul is our form; the person is our corporeal soul. When a person dies, the soul departs, the corporeal soul remains alone in the form; the corporeal soul returns to the earth, the soul ascends to Heaven. Therefore, it is said the corporeal soul is the inner country, the soul is the outer country. Those who follow the dao must understand the correspondence of inner and outer, thus they connect with numinous clarity. Those who do not know inner and outer fail outright. Those unaware of the outer country’s people wander among the five viscera and six entrails, restless day and night. The soul and corporeal soul are the sun and moon—how so?

The Yellow Elder said: Heaven has sun and moon, Heaven’s soul and corporeal soul. To walk the dao is likewise; how then should one walk? In Heaven, they are sun and moon; in humans, they are soul and corporeal soul. The will aspires to this—how then to attain the true dao, to stand alongside Heaven? From where does one begin in the inner country? The outer country is the soul; the inner country is the corporeal soul. At night one guards the outer country; hence it is said to guard the soul. By day one guards the inner country; hence it is said to guard the corporeal soul. The sage says: One yin, one yang—this is the couple, named the dao. By day one guards yang—how is this said? At dawn when the sun rises, the soul governs itself; one must guard the corporeal soul with the soul. When the sun sets and the soul returns to itself, one then guards the soul with the corporeal soul. The two mutually obtain and follow each other, rejoicing in yin and yang’s harmonious governance—how could there be another? Therefore, it is said one yin, one yang, clearly united in form and appearance. The sun travels by day, the moon by night; the sun is the person—how is this said? The sun and moon, soul and corporeal soul, are Heaven and Earth’s unique spirits, yet unaware of themselves, corresponding with Heaven and Earth, perfectly unified. The kidney is said to be the moon, the heart the sun, the liver the soul, the lung the corporeal soul—this is mistaken. Heaven illuminates the sun, moon, and stars; the enlightened see life and death. The moon also has life and death. The sun is one state, the moon two, the form three. Thus the Old Lord said: One gives birth to two, two gives birth to three, three gives birth to all things, yet they do not know it; thus they fail the dao and fail to give birth to all things. The moon comes as the White Tiger, the sun as the Azure Dragon; to walk the dao is thus—one must be cautious and not neglect this.

The Yellow Elder said: The soul governs the corporeal soul and form, communicating light with sun and moon. The spirit remains yet does not know the five viscera and six entrails. Where is the foremost place? This is not about transcending the world, but about strengthening the form. The ghost is not ghost; it is called the person’s soul. The corporeal soul is our form.

The *Immortal Spirit Diagram* says: “I am the dao.” Divided into yin and yang three spirits, residing in the mud pellet, signaling and preserving thought, this can be the heavenly treasure. Long ago, the dao asked the spirit: Heaven sent a child to dwell with humans, to preserve and guard the body and form, so that spirit and essence would not be lost, the five viscera peaceful and balanced, soul and corporeal soul always present. Departing from wandering, unwilling to assist the numinous, going far and not returning, sometimes ascending to Heaven, the body dies and fate ends. Daily one hears cries, blood and vessels decay, bones enter the spring. Each should know how to treat illness to heal, sitting up and rising to tend the kitchen. Like a great palace, a thousand miles without grain, all serve at the sides. The pure master left great grace; one may exert all effort.

The Master said: To undertake the dao’s method, one must first confess and bear one’s faults, then petition for pardon and removal, repent and correct oneself, abandon evil and follow good. Only then may one respectfully visit the heavenly officials, whose ranks number in the myriad stones, whose salary is from Heaven’s granary, honored by the Supreme Emperor, esteemed by kings and nobles. How could one again commit evil? First preserve the five beasts. The five beasts are the Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Black Tortoise, and Yellow Dragon. Second, traverse the stores from head to foot, preserve their spirits, nourish their roots, circulate their qi, and call their names. Third, guard the one of the earth, named the cinnabar field, bright white as snow, five colors of profound yellow, the mother of the dao’s dwelling, within the weak water womb. Fourth, guard the one of the person, named the scarlet palace, the Great One of the Southern Pole, the red child and little boy, flanked by sun and moon, soul and corporeal soul united. Fifth, guard the one of Heaven, the purple palace, as large as a chicken’s egg, five colors mixed yellow, governed by the double dipper, stars recording the calendar. Sixth, feed the cinnabar field, governing birth in three, five, seven, nine, and the mid-month Jiawu day as auspicious. Seventh, feed the golden fluid, essence of profound water, to be used at the fifteenth hour plus midnight. Eighth, feed the accumulated five-colored gold yellow, morning meal, evening meal, midday, and midnight. Ninth, feed the great ultimate purple cloud, narrow beyond Heaven, rising above and below, chaos without form. If you wish to unify the three departments as one, know that the formed guards the formless. If you wish to preserve the upper department as one, yellow as an orange, also preserve the middle department as one, red as blood, guard the lower department as one, white as snow. Among these divine beings, one wears red garments, nine inches tall, crowned with the nine virtues’ crown, wearing a green jade hairpin, named Xu Xu. Constantly envisioning this makes one’s ears and eyes sharp, brightens the eyes’ essence, removes flowing confusion, and cures blindness and deficiency. If one overthinks, or the lord long gazes at documents and the eyes grow dim, the heart confused, blame this.

The liver is wood, located beneath the left ribs, color true blue, like a male wild goose’s crest. Its six-leaf gallbladder hangs in the middle, color like a swollen blood sac. Within the liver dwells a divine person, clad in blue, eight inches tall, named Lan Lan. Within the gallbladder dwells a divine person, three inches tall, clad in white, named Hu Hu. Constantly envisioning them causes no fright, fear, anger, or joy. If the heart is startled, the gallbladder spirit is harmed; envisioning the liver and gallbladder’s state restores it. If illness causes joy, anger, killing, fear, or dread, blame this too. The spleen lies beneath the right ribs, attached above the stomach’s upright end, color like gold. Within dwells a divine person, clad in yellow, six inches tall, named Bi Bi. Constantly envisioning this brings joy and no harm; men become discerning, women peaceful. If sorrow and thought arise, the spleen spirit is harmed; envisioning the spleen’s state restores it. If sorrow and pain arise, also recall this to return the spirit. Three inches below the liver in the chest lies the stomach, yellow in color, governing the fullness of the five flavors. Within dwells a divine person, clad in red, five inches tall, named Dan Dan. When food and drink cause bloating, first lie on the right side, stretch hands and feet, the belly extremely swollen. Exhale qi through the mouth, call the spirit’s name, press two inches below with the hand, and soon it is cured. This is said to be the spirit driving out the food qi. The kidney lies above the waist, flanking the spine, shaped like a crouching rat, veined with yellow-white fat, often appearing like large soybeans, black and shiny like lacquer on top. Within the kidney dwells a white person, four inches tall, named Piao Piao. Constantly envisioning this harmonizes yin and yang, prevents deafness. If hearing is impaired for long, the kidney spirit is harmed; constantly envision the kidney’s state to restore it. If the ear hears nothing, blame this.

Passing on to later learners: exert effort. You live in perilous times; you must cultivate my dao. Light lies in the red conduct, envisioning wrapped in ninety-nine, the five jade bright central palaces, guarding one can endure long. Learning the dao has no early or late, only cultivation is needed. Attaining the dao is vast and boundless, truly like having a treasure hidden in the belly, accumulating gold above and below. Think of the three palaces, sit up, remember without forgetting, and long endure. The key to learning the dao is to heed these words. The unworthy are like sages; each must be for oneself. The self contains harmony and nature; nothing cannot be stumbled upon. High and low each serve the other; beware jealousy of numinous clarity. Immediately record faults; later losses come from a hair’s breadth, differing by tens of thousands of miles. The Three Corpses report human faults at month’s end; all come from your husband and wife. It depends on your feelings and heart’s unkindness.

The spirit said: I dwell with humans, but it is not always possible. I live with humans, hoping to benefit them, but humans neglect themselves, do not cherish their bodies, push me away, harm me, insult me, restrain me with women, exhaust me with lust, disturb me, abandon me, deceive me, and do not preserve me by the dao; I also abandon them. Each is in themselves; how could it be in me?

The dao asked the spirit: When humans are born, without male or female, all contain yin and yang king qi, and if they wish to nourish their nature, preserve spirit and essence long and undying, looking upon the world, how should they do? The spirit replied: Humans dwell receiving supreme qi; the four limbs and five viscera each have their spirit; the heart is red, the lungs white, connected through. Those who oppose this die; those who follow live. Gather the five viscera in thought, call their names, below to remove illness, above to become immortal. Truly this is the whole dao; later it can be transmitted.

The spirit said: Constantly think of the left eye as the scarlet palace, the right eye as the jade hall, within which dwells a red person, making the eyes sharp and bright, night vision like day. Eyes facing the wind cause eye diseases; walking at dusk, resting peacefully, closing the eyes and thinking of this, inner vision heals itself. At night one can see fish; by day one can read books.

The spirit said: Constantly think of one person on the forehead’s hairline, five inches tall, wearing five-colored garments. Occasionally think three inches before the forehead, color pure yellow, a round disk, causing the forehead to hold refined thought; evil spirits dare not approach.

The spirit said: Constantly think of one person emerging two inches below the nose, clad in yellow, sitting upright in a bright pavilion, allowing one to know fragrance and odor, no longer suffering from any obstructive illness.

The spirit said: Constantly think of the bright child born, making the five viscera peaceful and stable, blood vessels harmonious and flowing, women’s complexion beautiful, men strong and upright.

The spirit said: Constantly think of blue light to the left, white light to the right, red light in front, black light behind, all coming to rest on oneself. Seeing this light never ceases; thus it is said to constantly generate bright children.

The spirit said: At rooster’s crow, think of the east as true blue, fix your mind and think of your body as true blue; at the hour of Chen until Si, think of the south as true red, fix your mind and think of your body as true red; at Wei until Shen, think of the west as true white, fix your mind and think of your body as true white; at Xu until Hai, think of the north as true black, fix your mind and think of your body as true black; at Wu and Ji, think of true yellow, fix your mind and think of your body as true yellow. Do not forget through the four seasons; suddenly you will rise. Women who think thus fix their minds, milk flows easily, and at monthly times no yang illnesses occur.

The spirit said: The five viscera—constantly think of the names of the five viscera within the intestines, their fullness. Each viscera has its fullness: liver is blue, governing the soul, within is a blue person; lungs are white, governing the corporeal soul, within is a white person; heart is red, governing the spirit, within is a red person; kidney is black, governing the will, within is a black person; spleen is yellow, governing thought, within is a yellow person. Therefore they are called the five viscera. Constantly thinking of their spirits causes no blood diseases to remain in the abdomen, no accumulated qi, large muscles, fat, and intestines, regulating and benefiting the organs. If one asks for the living who have lost spirit, think here to restore it.

The spirit said: Constantly think of yourself as the five jades. The five jades method: on Jia and Yi days think of yourself as blue jade; on Bing and Ding days as red jade; on Wu and Ji days as yellow jade; on Geng and Xin days as white jade; on Ren and Gui days as black jade. Thus, everywhere settle and think of this, close your eyes inwardly, but do not shake hands, feet, or limbs. After a while, suddenly you say you are formless. Spirit is settled, no longer wandering afar, lying down no evil dreams or demons, for demons fear the five jades.

The spirit said: To calm the spirit, think of the six dragons. What are the six dragons? Liver is the Azure Dragon, lungs the White Tiger, heart the Vermilion Bird, kidney the Black Tortoise, spleen the Yellow Dragon, gallbladder the Flying Snake. The scripture says: Dragon and snake combine essence, firmly guard without desire, wandering with intention.

The spirit said: All human faces, limbs, five viscera, hands, and feet all have spirit, each named according to their place. Suppose the nose spirit is named Nose; heart spirit is named Heart; this is Heaven’s dao. Within one day, think to preserve all spirits; then bones and joints become strong, qi and strength vigorous. Not knowing their names, soul and corporeal soul do not know entry and exit. If one wishes to cauterize or prick, first pat with the hand saying: “Spirit all moved, needle and fire in proper place,” then proceed or avoid people.

The spirit said: The throat extends from the tongue’s root down to the heart, one foot long, entering the heart’s middle section, like a linked jade ring, countless in number. In the middle is a red garment, with two divine persons guarding left and right. Constantly envisioning this causes forgetfulness of self, no cough or reverse illness. If one likes forgetfulness, blame this.

The liver causes its color to be white silk wrapped in true blue, with jade leaves before, covering the upper half of the heart, three leaves behind, embracing the heart. Within the lungs dwells a divine person, pure white, seven inches tall, holding a jade halberd, resting among the leaves, named Chui. Envisioning this causes no illness, no nausea, face like jade’s luster. If one sees death, bleeding, foul rats, or ugly forms, the spirit is harmed; often think of the lung spirit’s state to restore it. Ugly forms are what the human heart normally rejects. The heart is fire, red and bright like a flower, the great root small below, above the diaphragm straight to the breast.

Above is the floral canopy; below one is at the dipper’s door; below that is where the sun and moon travel. The three as one in the person, bright like a luminous pearl—diligently guard it and what more to seek? To preserve the earth one, dwell where the sun and moon travel; to preserve the person one, dwell at the dipper’s door; to preserve the heaven one, dwell beneath the floral canopy. Primordial qi flutters and draws together; within is a divine turtle, upright and lofty. If you wish to know the one, ask me where I dwell. Not only is there a male one², but also a female one, formless and very difficult to know. If you do not know the one, ten thousand matters are lost. It is as large as a pellet, yellow as an orange, the Li Lou Qi door’s pearl jade chamber, emerging as two halves, entering as one, flowing and illuminating the world red as the sun. If you guard it, all matters are complete.

The lower cinnabar field is two inches below the navel, three inches wide and long, white above and black below, blue to the left, yellow to the right, the central red child like a yellow chicken egg. The middle cinnabar field is the heart, large above and small below, central red as fire, within is the Great One Lord, eight inches tall, wearing a red cap. The Wu Ji hall spirit is at the heart’s upper border, red, white, and crimson. The upper cinnabar field is beneath the floral canopy, between the eyebrows, left half sun, right half moon, one inch deep, only the center is the red child Yellow Elder Lord, flanked by two jade youths of the kidneys, attending the Elder Lord’s cap and sash. As large as a pellet, yellow as an orange, the Li Lou Qi door’s pearl jade chamber, emerging as two halves, entering as one, flowing and illuminating the world red as the sun. You must know this and guard it carefully, do not lose it. The stars are expelled, three stars beneath the floral canopy cover the Elder Lord, head round like Heaven, hair blue-black and long, two males square and upright, eyebrows like strong crossbows, ears spread to the four directions, wearing jade pendants. Left eye is sun, right eye is moon.

From the left kidney emerges the Supreme Spiritual General, seventy-two zhang tall, wearing a red cap and great crown, crimson robe and cinnabar clothes, holding a golden talisman in the right hand, commanding three hundred thousand soldiers, emerging in red clothes, dwelling to my left. From the right kidney emerges the Deputy General, seventy-one zhang tall, wearing a red cap and great crown, crimson robe and single garment, holding a jade halberd in the left hand, commanding three hundred thousand soldiers, emerging in red clothes, dwelling to my right. From the spleen emerges the Self General, eighty-one zhang tall, wearing a red cap and great crown, crimson robe and single garment, holding a baton in the left hand, commanding three hundred thousand soldiers, all emerging in red clothes, dwelling before me³.
