## The Supreme Scripture of the Inner Truth: The Golden Chamber’s Destiny-Passing Green Script for Returning the Years and the Three Radiant Treasures

The Supreme Registrar of the Southern Pole, the High True Lord of the Forbidden, respectfully records: In the first year of the reign of the First Emperor, the year of Renwu, on the seventh day of the seventh month at midday, within the supreme and excellent Celestial Land of Boundless Life, the Jade Kingdom, beneath the Seven Treasures’ Void Cavern, the Phoenix Capital, the Purple Terrace, and the Jade Forest, I dare to bow my head before the Jade Pavilion and humbly petition the Jade Emperor, the Venerable Sovereign of the Void Heaven:

“Though I am but a humble scion of imperial lineage, my destiny rooted in ancient origins, cycling through nine transformations, forming the fetus of the Jade Ferry, the Three Elixirs’ elegant radiance, auspiciously opening with the dawn, inheriting the imperial robe, yearning for the Nine Mysteries, cultivating and studying the numinous classics, contemplating truth and meditating on spirit, fasting long in the Jade Palace, never wasting a moment, enduring the kalpa’s teachings, inscribing the imperial chapters, ascending to the highest office, overseeing myriad immortals—yet I have not been granted the method to pass destiny. The cycles advance, time is fleeting; I beseech you to bestow the treasured formula to guide future worthy ones.”

Then the Dao Lord of the Void Heaven spoke to the Supreme Registrar of the Southern Pole, the High True Lord of the Forbidden:

“The secret of the Golden Chamber’s method for passing destiny and returning the years lies beyond the Nine Heavens, in the Palace of Great Abundance, within the Golden Terrace and Jade Chamber’s nine winding rooms. Attending are three thousand Jade Maidens. This dao is profound and subtle, beyond the comprehension of ordinary truth practitioners. The ancient method is transmitted once every myriad kalpas. Those who attain to practice this method share the same root as the Nine Qi, harmonizing the Three Radiances. Heaven and Earth endure forever. Cultivate it once and the stomach’s storehouse opens to the passages; ten times and clarity shines forth, conversing with the spirit; a hundred times and one passes destiny, transforming inwardly into the fetal immortal; a thousand times and one rides the void, soaring to the Supreme Clarity; ten thousand times and the dao is perfected, rank rising to Immortal Minister, riding smoke and driving the void, ascending to the imperial sovereigns. Now I reveal this to you—proceed with caution.”

He then commanded the Five Elders Immortals of the Southern Capital, the Supreme Registrar of the Upper Palace, the Celestial Officer Sima Dingxian, to confer *The Supreme Scripture of the Inner Truth: The Golden Chamber’s Destiny-Passing Green Script for Returning the Years and the Three Radiant Treasures* upon the Lord. They took an oath before the Land of Boundless Life.

By the first year of the Central Sovereign, the scripture passed through the hands of the Southern Pole’s Upper Origin Lord, the Ten Thousand Beginnings Master, the Yellow Youth True Lord, the Golden Radiance Immortal, the Great Harmony Jade Maiden, the Three Primordial Lords of the Great Simplicity, the Golden Gateway Emperor, and the Prime Minister Azure Youth Lord. Now one copy is sealed within Mount Emei. Should there be a mysterious chart or imperial document, green script of Supreme Clarity, golden bones and jade treasury, one will obtain this text.

Yet as the Three Dao circulate and the Nine Yang respond in due time, the True Primordial Sovereign shall implement the genuine dao. Those with immortal registers from past lives will surely obtain this text. Those who receive it hold a precious secret—do not rashly proclaim it.

Within the Spirit Capital Palace of the Great Emperor dwell two hundred and forty thousand High True Immortals, all casting golden slips, carving silver bindings, writing with purple brushes. Their voices unite in perfect harmony, chanting this chapter. The jade resonance is clear and far-reaching, its sound reaching the Nine Heavens, communicating with spirits and summoning numinous power, reversing the years and returning the cycles, traveling in ritual song, marvelously crowning the Inner Truth. Thus it can pass destiny; Heaven and Earth share the same root. Those who obtain this dao can become Supreme Immortals.

This scripture is the exalted jade chapter, the spirit chapter of the Great Emperor, weaving one form and opening a hundred gates of principle. Recite it once and the subtle principle naturally shines; ten times and the face regains youthful glow; a hundred times and one transforms inwardly into the fetal immortal; a thousand times and one sits, stands, and forgets death; ten thousand times and the dao is perfected, ascending at dawn. Fasting long in silent places, untouched by wind or dust, the dao descends everywhere, counting days to ascend immortality.

If one is devoted but unable to escape the body, dwelling among humans, one can still separate a chamber, fast purely, burn incense, worship morning and evening, and chant the numinous chapter. One may then avert calamities, ward off myriad afflictions, dispel misfortune from the Upper Palace, erase sins of the Nine Yins. With ten thousand accumulations of merit, the body ascends the cloud chamber.

### The Method of Passing Destiny

When practicing the method of passing destiny, one must use the day of one’s own destiny and the day of the Grand Duke (Tai Sui), as well as the days of the Jiazi cycle and the Eight Solar Terms. Enter a chamber facing east, ingesting the nine swallows of qi, holding the Great Emperor Lord in mind, then bow twice. Turn south, ingest nine swallows of qi, holding the Southern Pole Supreme True Lord in mind, bow twice again. Turn west, ingest nine swallows of qi, holding the Three Heavens’ Lord of Longevity in mind, bow twice again. Turn north, ingest nine swallows of qi, holding the Exalted Void Sovereign Lord in mind, bow twice again.

Alternatively, one may face east entirely, bowing mentally to the Four Directions while ingesting qi. When finished, face one’s own destiny direction, knock the teeth thirty-six times, swallowing qi thirty-six times, stopping thereafter. Facing the Grand Duke, draw in qi twenty-four times, swallowing and stopping. Return facing north to recite the scripture. Ten recitations count as one cycle. Upon completion, ingest one Golden Chamber Destiny-Protection talisman. Ten recitations equal ten talismans, limited by the number of cycles.

This summons spirits and attunes truth, sitting one sees the eight directions, regulating the hundred gates, step by step receiving spirits. When ten thousand qi converge, one attains longevity, living as long as Heaven and Earth, sharing the same year as the Three Radiances.

Holding the scripture facing north, knock the teeth thirty-six times, envisioning five-colored purple clouds filling the chamber, inside and out dim and mysterious. Whisper the incantation:

> “Profound, profound, ninefold qi,  
> The supreme dao births the Upper Origin,  
> Three wheels empty as jade,  
> Five turns pass destiny clouds,  
> Returning years among the nine lords,  
> Ten thousand cycles the dao divides,  
> Vast desert, how boundless,  
> Truly abiding is the One Sovereign,  
> Blended within the Golden Chamber,  
> Fetal breath quiets the hundred gates.”

Then begin reciting the scripture.

## The Supreme Scripture of the Inner Truth: The Golden Chamber’s Destiny-Passing Green Script for Returning the Years and the Three Radiant Treasures

Within the Golden Chamber dwell true beings, transforming in the Jade Kingdom, born among treasured neighbors. Purple clouds swirl, thick with the Nine Mysteries, forming naturally the Jade Terrace’s body. Jade towers and golden gateways face each other on both sides, flowing rosy clouds and cinnabar skies winging the numinous truth. Vast green radiance shines over the central fields. Above rise the towering Ninefold Heavens; below lie ten-thousand-zhang deep valleys and springs. The cavern gates gather cloud roots. Jade Maidens and Immortal Children, each three thousand, hold scarves, attend incense, and raise purple smoke. Thousands upon thousands, all are gathered immortals, arrayed in ritual robes, chanting the numinous chapter. The Golden Chamber cycles to return the years; the Three Radiant Treasures shine brightly. Ten recitations make one cycle to the Upper Origin. Swallowing the numinous talisman completes the return.

Contemplating quietly the five viscera and regulating the hundred gates, within each gate dwells a spirit. The Supreme Youth attends the Emperor’s truth, calming and stabilizing the tongue’s root and the liquid source. The Great One’s plan governs essential words, nearly filling the Jade Pillow beneath the Mud Pellet. The Emperor Lord’s banner of Brahma’s life sways between the two brows’ central parting. The Primordial Heroic Son is a steadfast numinous immortal, forming the left armpit behind the liver’s back gate. The Yang cavity’s numinous presence is the White Origin, filling the right armpit’s four proper members.

The Central Registrar, the Elder Lord, clearly holds the register to pass the fate body, preserving the Red Palace’s longevity. The Peach Lord of Dao’s health harmonizes essence and prolongs life, evenly filling the palace gates and nourishing the numinous root. The Heavenly Emperor’s red child is the Three Primordials’ ancestor, within the Mud Pellet’s nine apertures in front.

The Elixir Emperor moves the pearl, a spirit of the Red Palace, filling the nape beside the great hammer. The Primordial King begins the bright original nature, filling the four boundaries connected to the mouth. The Eight Truths combine radiance, joining the Nine Mysteries. Below, the backbones gather in the central field. The Seven Truths of Mysterious Yang pass the destiny year, filling the right kidney at the Jade Gate.

Communicating spirit and passing destiny through the hundred liquid passages, the Six Truths of the Upper Origin connect with purple smoke, filling the head’s exterior and interior entwining. The Five Truths nurture radiance through the Three Origins, filling the throat and holding the wondrous chapter. The Four Truths’ azure clarity restores youthful visage, filling the stomach canal with myriad spirits’ joy.

The Three Truths’ yellow serenity glows like cinnabar, filling the two nostrils and the secret pass. The Two Truths’ firm jade qi scents orchid, filling the Great Granary without hardship. The One Truth’s heavenly spirit is calm and peaceful, filling the chest and governing the life officer.

All wear brocade robes and fly azure skirts, sealing the destiny’s dead gate. Carefully preserve the mouth, chanting the numinous text. Ten readings make one cycle, dividing meaning and principle, not only for longevity but ascending the Nine Mysteries.

The Nine-Nine Truths’ secret restrictions fill the left ear with divine wisdom, secretly entering boundless realms. Palaces and mansions flourish in the immortal sovereign’s seat, teaching to pass destiny with matching talismans. The One Emperor’s soul returns above, filling the right ear with myriad mechanisms, hearing sounds and distinguishing subtle tones.

Three combine into one, shining together. The Purple and White Primordial Lords’ names are Veiled Obscurity, filling the head’s bright face. Breathing the Five Dawns swallows sun and moon, the numinous ganoderma flourishes without hunger or thirst.

The Yellow Primordial Lord named Perfect Radiance fills the chest and abdomen, weaving cloud nets, controlling the Northern Emperor and checking heavenly demons, truly preserving the Red Palace of the Void Heaven.

The White Primordial Lord named Enlightenment fills the lower pass, securing the Great Spirit, connecting the nine apertures with fresh radiance, restraining souls and spirits to ensure constant life.

At midday, the Registrar of Fate named Life Reception fills the left hand’s four great lights, the Five Radiances preserving truth and setting cloud camps, drawing sun and moon, swallowing primal essence, passing destiny and returning years, exhausting heavenly lifespan.

The Peach Lord of the Moon named Square Fullness fills the right hand, moving the Dipper stars, holding the mysterious thread and governing the Five Spirits, traversing the Four-Seven, naming the heavenly court, cycling thrice through the cavern’s clarity.

The Left Eye Child named Flying Spirit fills the left eye with yang brightness, clearly seeing the primal limit and beholding the Jade Clarity, brilliant as heavenly might releasing shooting stars.

The Right Eye Child named Morning Infant fills the right eye with yin inner essence, observing the heavenly pass and supervising the imperial court, clear as three dawns riding fate’s journey.

The Lung Child named Pure Brightness fills the lung’s gate inside and out, dispersing wandering souls and spirits to Yellow Serenity, inspecting the imperial chambers without loss or gain.

Within the fetus dwells the One Origin, the Mysterious Son of the Great One’s essence and soul, filling the five viscera and knotting the throat, preserving spirit and solidifying qi to prevent death.

The Central Qi Lord extends longevity, with no lord to protect the essence soul guarding the valley child, filling the five viscera and the great stomach palace, receiving fluids and infant mists.

Crimson hero and jade ganoderma freely fill, the black qi born in the joints, the Emperor’s true essence soul named Mysterious Terrace fills the nine intestines and governs the four dimensions.

Understanding this truth grants endless life. Within the womb, yellow qi is the ancestral bright chariot, co-governing with the emperor in the same chamber. The essence soul’s pattern is hidden in the secret book—why not alone contemplate the profound void?

Ten thousand cycles suffice to ascend the cloud carriage. Within the blood, red qi mingles with departing essence, the Registrar’s essence soul emits the binding essence. Two spirits jointly fill the hundred gates, harmonizing qi and liquid to guard the form.

Understanding this dao means never dying, living ten thousand years is but the beginning. The Upper Origin’s Primordial Father and the High Common Birth, the Lower Mysterious Mother and the Uncle Fire King, fill the womb’s lower bright hall.

The Great One’s double darkness governs the mysterious thread. The Emperor’s reverent true form is matched. The Great Emperor’s essence soul named Yang Terrace, the eight voids return the dao, winging bright radiance.

The emperor’s soul is without obstruction, sharing one chamber, filling original destiny’s Great Hidden Palace. The Seven Spirits combine the contract and govern the bright beam, cycling and passing destiny eternally.

The Three Primal Lords named Firm and Expansive refine and transform the Eight Paths to pass the great village. The Left Immortal Zhongcheng governs the center; the Right Immortal Quwen stands beside.

The Three Spirits combine in the human body. The Mysterious One Laozi dwells in the forest of emptiness; the Mysterious Pass sighs cool and clear.

The Black Emperor preserves the bladder; the White Emperor calms the scrotum; the Red Emperor awakens in the mouth’s square; the Blue Emperor carves the five viscera palace.

The Five Emperors, Two Elders, and Two Immortal Kings guard and attend the destiny body, ascending the cloud thread. The Imperial Ministers of the Upper Origin diligently cultivate essence.

The Red Palace’s inner spirit shines firm; the lower courtyard’s spirit returns to the bright above. The Three-One True Lords guard the destiny form, each filling a palace with their qi essence.

Carefully preserving them grants longevity, not only deathlessness but ascending to Jade Clarity.

The One True Lord’s father is Peaceful Residence; the mother’s two spirits await the destiny record, filling the death gate inside the form.

Above and below are arrayed in service, never leaving the palace, always present. The destiny always recites and sees the red child.

---

Ten thousand qi blend and form truth, each heavenly soldier fills the destiny body. Carefully preserving them naturally divides. Fasting long and accumulating merit, one sees the true being, granted the Golden Chamber’s Returning Years chapter, recorded in the imperial register as a destined affinity—all due to diligent yearning, not natural chance.

Ten recitations make one cycle, all spirits rejoice. Within three years, the dao appears before the path, seeing the purple chamber and speaking with destiny, descending the green palanquin and flying cloud pavilion, roaming and feasting on the Five Mountains, visiting the imperial dawn, paying homage and worshiping the Great Void Jade Emperor, bowing and receiving immortality.

---

After reciting the scripture, one should preserve the chamber’s natural purple qi, lush and overlapping, entering the destiny body through nose, mouth, and ears, feeling the body grow warm. The mouth draws in thirty-nine swallows, whispering the incantation:

> “Ten thousand qi blend to form the spirit abode,  
> Each palace and chamber’s qi pure and void,  
> Thirty-nine apertures remove death and fate,  
> Named in golden slips and green script,  
> Ten thousand blessings abundant and overflowing,  
> Spirits ascend the Golden Gateway, mounting cloud carriages.”

---

Those who possess the golden imperial slips, purple script of Supreme Clarity, and receive this text are all destined to be outstanding immortals. The Azure Palace records their names, assigning thirty-six Jade Boys and Jade Maidens each, attending the jade scripture, guarding those who have the scripture.

Practicing this dao forbids treading in filth or entering impurity, eating the five pungent and fishy odors, offending the hidden spirit, harming the true essence, or entering immortality improperly.

## The Method of Cultivating the Passing Destiny and Returning Years Dao

On the day of the six Gui, take one hu of water from the Northern Spring. On the day of one’s own destiny, take one jin each of white angelica, peach peel, and [illegible] leaves, combine and boil to a boil, then bathe centrally.

At the moment of bathing, facing one’s own destiny, knock the teeth nine times, imagining three Jade Boys holding scarves on the left, two Jade Maidens bearing incense on the right, purple clouds and floral canopies covering front and back.

Whisper the subtle prayer:

> “Heaven and Earth open and clear,  
> Washing away filth and dust,  
> Refining and transforming the Eight Paths,  
> Reversing form to Supreme Truth,  
> Hundred gates receive spirit,  
> Step by step receiving renewal,  
> Clear void supervises and reflects,  
> Inside and outside arranged,  
> Auspicious day and good hour,  
> Passing destiny and returning years,  
> Jade Boys and Jade Maidens,  
> Hold scarves for me,  
> Mysterious clouds and purple canopy,  
> Crown and gird my body,  
> Grant me longevity,  
> Heaven and Earth share root.”

Then bathe and finish, return to the chamber, lie facing east, take powder to adorn, anoint the whole body, rub palms until warm, wipe the face twenty-seven times, whisper the subtle prayer:

> “Heaven’s mysterious qi is pure,  
> My body now refined,  
> Dust and filth removed,  
> Ninety-nine receive spirit,  
> Make me transform,  
> Return to youthful form.”

[Complete.] Then draw in qi thirty-six times and stop.

---

Practicing this dao for three years, the old skin and flesh shed, splendid bones regenerate, the body shines with jade light, the face radiates golden splendor.

This is the wondrous method of all the daos, not transmitted to the untrue.

Lightly revealing it brings the seven ancestors’ punishment, long lost to the ghost officials. Those who secretly cultivate shall attain gods and immortals.

To receive the method of passing destiny and returning years, one must follow the rules. Master and disciple each fast nine days, or three days, or five days, providing an alliance banner of one chi length yearly, a golden figure weighing two taels and four zhu, one form, swearing to pass destiny in the Nine Heavens, a pledge of substitution.

Without oath, cultivation will not bring response; thought will not open spirit. Violating rules and breaking prohibitions summons the right officials’ investigation. Practitioners should be clearly cautious.

The True Being of the Western City at the Yangluo Palace bestowed it to Wei Huacun, now sealed in one copy within the Yangluo Mountains.
