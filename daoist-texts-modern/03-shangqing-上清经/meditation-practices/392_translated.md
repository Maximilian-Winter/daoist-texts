## Scripture of the Cavernous Truth, Most High Three Primordial Flowing Pearls

The Three Primordial Flowing Pearls Scripture governs the workings of the Director of Destinies. Its dao is wondrous and vast, the most revered among the Five Classics. To receive it, one uses pure white pearls, perfectly round and luminous, each as large as a paulownia seed, three hundred and sixty-five in number—corresponding to the measure of the stars and the meeting times of sun and moon. Two silks, crimson and yellow, each twenty-four feet long, are dedicated in oath to the Yin and Yang Numinous Officials, invoking the dao of extended flourishing and harmony. They embody twenty-four vital breaths, sealed in alliance by pure fasting, opened and entrusted. Passed down once every three hundred years, limited to five transmissions, never to be revealed again. This is the dao of the Supreme Ultimate Lords and Ministers of Fate.

Between the two eyebrows of ordinary people, near the top, one inch inward is the Bright Hall; two inches, the Cavernous Chamber; three inches, the Elixir Field; four inches, the Flowing Pearl. Within the Flowing Pearl Palace dwells the Lord Supreme Unity, seated on a radiant jewel throne, crowned with a purple canopy. He governs the coming and going of fate, consulting and reporting the records of destiny. Should there be faults, life is reduced and death decreed; should there be merit, death is lifted and life extended. Those who live and live again, carefully following this method, establishing merit without fault, the Director of Destinies petitions the Lord Supreme Unity to add years and extend life. Though not yet reaching the subtlety of the Four Palaces and One Female, it truly is the height of the Five Officials and One Male.

All who cultivate the *Taiwei Yellow Scripture* in eight volumes, precise and effective, will see the Flowing Pearl. Those who do not see it sink into eight lifetimes of suffering, wandering back and forth in toil, with no way to ascend to the mysterious. The key to mysterious ascent lies in the Flowing Pearl—its pearl shines in the upper palace, flowing light through the nine mansions, penetrating inside and out without obstruction or restraint, roaming freely above the Nine Heavens, feasting and reveling within the Three Pure Ones.

### Nine Terrace Talismans

*Secret Formula of the Perfected Man Feng of the Upper Clarity*

The path for students begins with healing disease, so that no emptiness or evil dwells in the body, nor blood be scant nor brain diminished, nor fluids foul and stagnant. Without first curing these, even taking food and practicing breathwork benefits not the body. Once there was a Daoist named Wang Zhongfu, who from youth delighted in matters of gods and immortals, often drawing in the Three Luminaries and feasting on the rosy clouds. For over forty years he perceived no gain; his son also studied, taking the method for eighteen years, and one day ascended to Heaven in broad daylight. Later, a Perfected Man of Southern Mountain suddenly descended to Zhongfu and taught him: “Son, the reason you have not ascended is that your body harbors great illness, your brain palace is deficient, tendons and fluids do not flow, spiritual nectar does not overflow. Though you again receive the Three Luminaries and feast on clouds, it benefits not your body.” Zhongfu then took medicine to heal and cultivated this matter further for another eighteen years, also ascending to Heaven in broad daylight. Now he dwells in the Mysterious Continent, receiving scripture as the Perfected Man of the Central Mountain, overseeing the Nine Mysteries—he is present even now.

A student of the Way must cherish breath and nourish spirit, take food and cure disease, so that the brain palace fills and the mysterious essence does not leak. Only then may one preserve spirit and take the numinous, chewing and inhaling the Three Luminaries alone. If one frequently mingles and leaks, spilling and draining, then breath becomes foul and spirit lost, essence exhausted and withered. Even if one again holds the mysterious jade tally or the golden scripture of the Supreme Ultimate, what use is it against non-life? Our ancient master often warned us of this: “A student, upon one contact, loses a year’s worth of medicinal power; upon two contacts, two years’ worth; beyond three, all medicinal power is lost to the body.” Thus, true immortals are always cautious, regarding this as the greatest taboo of life and living.

Those who study the dao only desire to cherish breath and nourish spirit, closing breath to its utmost, exhaling breath to its finest, and must not speak much or shout loudly, which causes spirit to labor and breath to be damaged. Such study is not nourishing life. Those who preserve spirit and breath and practice true immortality must not borrow clothes or wear others’ belongings, nor take what is not theirs. All such coarse garments, shoes, and sandals must be kept fresh and pure. The three souls and seven spirits may dwell therein, also becoming the breath of the five spirits’ constant taboo, polluted and sullied by their miasma. On the eight festival days, one must always fast and purify, plan good deeds, and cultivate the dao’s methods. One must be careful not to quarrel, rejoice, or rage on those days, nor carry out punishments or threats—these are abhorred by Heaven and humans alike, a grave sin.

Those who refine the supreme dao and recite the divine scriptures, in every ten or twenty words, must lick lips and swallow saliva once or twice; in every hundred or fifty words, tap teeth two or three times, to summon spirit, gather numinous power, fill and harmonize blood and breath, and make spiritual nectar full. The Emperor’s One Dwelling, called “breath unlabored, opened but not leaked.” The student’s method forbids weeping or excessive spitting and draining, for these all damage fluids and leak nectar, exhausting the brain’s great reservoir. Hence the Perfected Daoists always practice exhaling, inhaling, and swallowing flavors to harmonize the six fluids.

On the days of Jia Yin and Geng Shen, the days when corpses and ghosts riot and spirits become restless and foul, one must not share a seat with spouse nor speak face to face. One must always fast, not sleep, and remain alert on these days, sending away all desires.

On every Wu Mao day, one must fast and purify before entering the chamber, facing east with heartfelt bows, preserving spirit and focusing breath, seeking to invoke divine illumination—this is also what the heart desires. Those who do so regularly are attended by the Jade Maiden.

On one’s own birth day, facing that direction, tap teeth three times, bow twice in heart, and softly chant:

> Supreme Unity fills life, three breaths merge true,  
> Womb chamber’s upper light, mother mysterious, father primordial,  
> Born are my five viscera, gathering my spirit and essence,  
> Flowing down the jade liquid, ascending to the mud pellet,  
> Evening refines seven spirits, morning harmonizes three souls,  
> Right commands jade splendor, left whistles golden dawn,  
> Let my spirit become immortal, serve the numinous and true,  
> Always preserve beneficial nectar, flying through the ten heavens.

When the chant finishes, again bow to the four directions, tap teeth three times, swallow saliva thrice. This is called the Supreme Incantation of Life Concealed, the path of the Womb’s Primordial Court. Those who can perform it preserve their soul and spirit, living long as immortals.

Whenever entering the chamber to burn incense, one must face the seat, bow in heart, tap teeth with a yin incantation, and speak what the heart desires—only by concentrating the essence can one surely receive numinous response.

One must always keep in mind one’s own form and visage, making it vividly appear before oneself, so that the face always shines with sun and moonlight, illuminating one’s form. Let the sun be on the left, moon on the right, nine inches from the face. When finished, tap teeth three times and softly chant:

> Primordial womb’s true light, twin luminaries and two mysteries,  
> Right embraces seven spirits, left holds three souls,  
> Let my spirit and brightness always abide with form.

When the chant finishes, tap teeth three times seven, swallow saliva seven times. This is called the Emperor’s Method of Recording Form, Embracing Soul and Controlling Spirit, making one wise and immortal without death. If one cannot receive the chant, one may simply keep the thought. Also, those who study the dao must first examine and regulate soul and spirit, eliminating corpses and ghosts.

On the days of new and dark moon, and on Geng Shen and Jia Yin days, one must fast and purify before entering the chamber, bathe to cleanse dust and filth, sit properly on the seat, and if able, remain sleepless—it is even better. Then, with a true cinnabar brush, dot beneath the left eye’s corner; with a realcinnabar brush, dot beneath the right nostril, letting a small amount enter the valley. When done, first tap teeth three times, softly chant:

> Two luminaries fly entwined, cinnabar and realcinnabar disperse bonds,  
> Breath seizes and expels evil, corpse filth sinks and vanishes,  
> Harmonize soul and refine spirit, unite form and great god,  
> Let me not die, ten thousand years fully intact,  
> Wisdom penetrates and vision clears, long flourishing and beneficial nectar.

When the chant finishes, tap teeth three times, swallow saliva three times, then use the right hand’s second finger to pinch below the left eye’s corner seven times, and the left hand’s second finger to pinch below the right nostril seven times. Press downward without raising the hand. Thus all is complete. These two spots are the gateways where seven spirits wander as corpses, where residual essence and evil breath steal nectar. Hence, receiving the essence of cinnabar and realcinnabar seals the path of corpses and ghosts, extinguishing the miasma of the two luminaries and the chaotic breath of lust. This is the Supreme Ultimate highest method. Those who regularly perform it find their souls harmonized and spirits softened, corpse filth scattered and ended, living long as immortals, their vision penetrating and clear. After three years of practice, all lustful thoughts vanish.

All Upper Clarity methods of tapping teeth and swallowing saliva have their own forms, with proper order and sequence, never to be mixed or confused, lest true spirits be muddled and mistaken. Tapping teeth commands the spirit; swallowing breath harmonizes the true. Inhaling and harmonizing the six fluids guides their circulation inward. To control spirit, one must beat the drum and proceed in ranks. Whenever preserving and cultivating the highest methods, during rites and incantations, one first taps teeth, upper and lower teeth striking each other, never left and right. One breath and one exhale should yield three taps for best effect. After the rite and incantation finish, one taps teeth again before swallowing all breath and fluids. This is called calling spirit and harmonizing truth, seeking to ascend as an immortal. I have often seen false and vulgar people confuse the scriptures, mixing order and sequence, rendering them useless—truly lamentable.
