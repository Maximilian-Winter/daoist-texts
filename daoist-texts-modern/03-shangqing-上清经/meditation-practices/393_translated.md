## The Bright Hall Palace: First in the Path of the Upper Way

From the bone at the juncture between the two eyebrows, measure three inches inward. To the left lies the Crimson Terrace and Azure Chamber; to the right, the Yellow Gate and Purple Portal. The Crimson Terrace is a platform of red jade, the chamber made of blue jade. Within sits a great deity, clad in blue brocade robes, holding a flowing golden fire bell, named Upright Heart, styled Exact Method. The Yellow Gate is a platform of yellow jade, the chamber of purple jade. There sits a great deity, robed in yellow brocade, wielding a flowing golden fire bell, named Tranquil Peace, styled Law King. From their mouths issue clouds of azure, yellow, and purple qi, seated within, they suppress all evil and malevolent qi.

If one hears the sound of golden chimes and jade vibrations within the ears, it signals external matters entering the palace. The two deities sound golden bells and jade chimes to alert the Nine Palaces. Quickly rub both hands until warm, cover the ear gates, knock the teeth nine times, hold the breath, and recite the heart incantation:

*“The infant dwells in the palace, the Nine Palaces in the chambers, please heed the numinous command, to repel misfortune. Great Unity’s flowing fire, dispel calamity and remove disaster.”*

Upon finishing the incantation, the face feels warm—evil qi has arrived. Quickly preserve the two deities and cast the flowing golden fire bells out from the brow junction. After a while, rub both hands until warm again, cover the ears; if the head and face feel gently warm, the evil qi has departed. If it feels chilling and oppressive, the evil qi remains; knock the teeth nine times again, recite the heart incantation thrice, cast the bells again, pervading the mud pellet; the evil will immediately vanish. Then recline briefly; after a short time, rise refreshed.

At one inch within the brow lies the Bright Hall Palace proper. To the left is the Sun Image, nine fen in diameter, radiating nine purple rays. To the right is the Moon Image, one inch in diameter, radiating ten yellow rays. In the center sits the Bright Mirror Divine Lord, appearing as a newborn infant, clad in green brocade robes, wearing a flowing golden fire bell, holding a red jade mirror emitting red light. This is the divided spirit of the Great Emperor of Longevity, titled the Bright Hall True Lord, named Four Brightnesses, styled Illumination Essence.

To the left is the Bright Youth True Lord, resembling the emperor’s image, the divided spirit of Elder Han, named Mysterious Yang, styled Young Clarity. To the right is the Bright Maiden True Lord, also resembling the emperor’s image, named Mysterious Yin, styled Young Origin.

Invoke their names thrice, knock the teeth nine times, and recite the heart incantation:

*“Purple Portal, Azure Chamber, within dwell great deities, Exact Method and Law King. Next enter the Bright Hall: Mysterious Brightness, Primal Clarity, Four Brightnesses, Illumination Essence. They sit guarding the Bright Hall, holding the jade mirror, cutting off misfortune. Flowing golden fire bells dispel evil and remove calamity.”*

Like traveling a dark road at night, secretly keep the three lords illuminating the path with the red jade mirror as if it were light. After a while, the way brightens. Upon encountering evil persons or malevolent ghosts, passing through evil temples or places of brigands, keep the three lords shaking the red jade mirror, sounding like thunder; soldiers, bandits, and evil ghosts all tremble and fall. If afflicted by pestilence, evil qi, chills, heat, or bodily dryness, keep the three lords shaking the jade mirror forty-nine times, transforming into a great fire that burns the afflicted body. After a while, sweat emerges warmly, and the illness is immediately cured.

If traveling and lacking food or drink, keep the three lords shaking the red jade mirror thirty-six times. The red qi in the mirror transforms into red liquid, which is placed on the tongue’s roof, filling the mouth with saliva without swallowing. After a short time, a gentle warmth arises, swallowed in three parts, three times used, hunger and thirst vanish instantly.

Whenever hearing the sound of combs striking, waves rising, or drums beating in the ears, it signifies bodily fatigue and impending illness. Quickly burn incense, lie supine in a quiet chamber, keep the three lords shaking the jade mirror twenty-four times. Red qi spreads throughout the body, transforming into a great fire, refining the form to red. After some time, the illness is immediately cured.

If suddenly seeing blood gathering or smelling the stench of blood, it foretells violent calamities, wars, and misfortunes. Quickly observe fasting, enter a chamber, avoid human affairs, and seek aid from the Three Primal Emperors and the Bright Hall Three Lords for one month, until misfortune turns to blessing.

If encountering evil dreams, turn the pillow and quilt, place the left hand on the heart, knock the teeth twenty-four times, and secretly recite:

*“Great Cavern True Mystery, refining the three souls, receiving heart command, swiftly open the Most High Three Primal Palaces. When facing ill-omened dreams, it is the seven souls wandering as corpses, joining evil sources. Quickly summon the Peachwood Protector to guard life, report to the Emperor Lords, the Five Elders, and the Nine True Ones, all guarding the body’s gates. The Yellow Gate Divine Master, the Purple Portal General, wield axes and shake bells, dissipate evil spirits, reverse misfortune to blessing, sever life and death ties.”*

After three recitations, after a while, release the Four Greats, recline briefly, and auspicious signs will surely appear. Practice this for three years, and no ill dreams will occur. Dreams then become visions of future fortune or misfortune.

## The Cavern Chamber Palace: Second in the Path of the Upper Way

Upon entering the chamber, burn incense and knock the teeth. Sit upright, calm the mind, and cease all thoughts. Within dwells the Yellow Elder Emperor Lord, who exhales purple qi, drawing breath through the nose, swallowing it thirty-five times. This cures the Three Realms’ water and fire calamities, human myriad disasters, extends lifespan, reverses death to life—like the Great Cavern’s turning wind and mingling dao.

Visualize oneself beside the Yellow Elder Emperor Lord, silently reciting nine chapters, eighty-one chapters counted nine times, forming one cycle. Then the Three Realms’ names rise, the Five Emperors take their places, arranged as perfected beings, with myriad spirits complete in one body. Then exhale and inhale purple qi, irrigating the entire body.

## The Elixir Field Palace: Third in the Path of the Upper Way

Upon entering the chamber, burn incense and knock the teeth. Sit upright, calm the mind, and cease all thoughts. Within dwells the Heavenly Emperor Lord, appearing as a newborn infant, robed in red brocade, seated at midday sun. Recite the Three Heavenly Names; this is the divided spirit of the Primordial Supreme.

To the left is the Upper Origin Red Infant Emperor Lord, also newborn in form, clad in red embroidered splendid robes, named Condensing Heaven, styled Primal Origin, holding the Divine Tiger Talisman. To the right is the Imperial Minister, likewise newborn in form, clad in red alluring splendid robes, named Initiating Essence, styled Mysterious Birth, holding the *Great Cavern True Scripture*. Seven stars hover above, pointing forward with the handle. Purple qi fills the palace, soaring nine hundred thousand li.

## The Flowing Pearl Palace: Fourth in the Path of the Upper Way

Upon entering the chamber, burn incense and knock the teeth. Sit upright, calm the mind, and cease all thoughts. Within dwells the Flowing Pearl True God, a divided spirit of the Most High Dao Lord. He can oversee myriad affairs and is also the palace where the Grass Immortal resides.

## The Profound Elixir Palace: Fifth in the Path of the Upper Way

Upon entering the chamber, burn incense and pray to open the Purple Tenuity Profound Elixir Palace, the Great Unity Central Emperor Lord, named Juegui Ying, styled White Transformation Origin. His golden bed and jade canopy, purple alluring brocade skirt, waist adorned with fire bells, cutting off evil and destroying treachery, holding star essence, with a round light emanating from his neck, sitting upright exhaling breath, extinguishing traces of demonic smoke, feasting with spirits and primordial elixir, harmonizing soul and refining spirit, ensuring flight as an immortal. Now your servant sincerely pays respects; myriad transformations arise.

Next, burn incense and visualize a purple qi rope descending from the Northern Dipper, entering the Profound Elixir Palace through the brow center. Then visualize the sun image descending from the Dipper’s mouth, entering the palace directly through the brow junction. Soon it spreads like purple mist, filling the brain like a fiery pearl.

After a while, suddenly see the Profound Elixir Lord descending from the Dipper’s mouth, entering through the brow junction, sitting at midday sun, wearing purple embroidered jade robes, purple embroidered splendid skirts, a purple jade morning crown on his head. In his left hand he holds the Dipper handle—this is the Star of the Demon. In his right hand he holds the Xuan root, facing the Purple Tenuity Enclosure Dipper mouth, arranging six stars in a horizontal row of light, the sixth star. From his mouth issues purple qi mist; his waist is girded with fire bells.

Next, visualize yourself, shaped like a lotus seed, wearing blue robes and crown, holding a tablet before the Profound Elixir Lord, bowing nine times, and silently praying:

*“Juegui Ying Transformation Origin.”*

Call thrice, knock the teeth nine times. After a while, the Profound Elixir Lord and you ride the crimson qi together, entering the golden platform and jade palace of the Dipper, with exquisite treasure canopies, golden beds, jade desks. You and the Profound Elixir Lord bow thrice, kneel, and swallow purple qi eighty-one times. The Profound Elixir Lord rides purple qi with you, returning to the Profound Elixir Palace to sit. You rest before the Profound Elixir Lord, concentrating for a long time, then receive a marvelous response. After waiting a moment, you calm your breath and exit the chamber. This is the usual procedure.

Next, at the start of spring and the spring equinox, ride purple qi into the Dipper, arriving at the Venus Star, each drinks nine sips of azure qi. At the start of summer and the summer solstice, arrive at the Red Origin Star, drinking three sips of red qi. At the start of autumn and the autumn equinox, arrive at the Yin Essence Star, each drinks seven sips of white qi. At the start of winter and the winter solstice, arrive at the Profound Darkness Star, each drinks five sips of black qi. The four seasons arrive at the Heavenly Pass Star, drinking twelve sips of yellow qi. When complete, Great Unity returns with you to your own Profound Elixir Palace, and you withdraw into your heart.

Practice this for eighteen years, and you will be like a thousand riders and ten thousand chariots, welcoming the white sun rising at dawn. Its功 is most wondrous, repelling myriad demons, too vast to fully recount. If you practice this path, there is no need to further practice the Three-One method.

## The Four Female Palaces’ True One Inner Spirit Treasure: The Jade Secret

Anyone who studies the Way of the Supreme Truth but does not know the inner names of the Four Female True Ones will never become an immortal. The learner receives the master’s secret formula and then faithfully practices.

The Jade Pure Spirit Mother, surname Lian, named Xian, styled Huangyan, nine inches and nine fen tall, wears a dark yellow simple spirit sash, her head adorned with a headdress of seven layers of pearl and jade, crowned with the Infinite Worthy Crown, dwelling in the supreme Great Ultimate Pearl Palace, the treasury of seven treasures and five spirits, in the mysterious origin village, governing the body’s Jade Emperor Palace.

The Supreme Clarity True Maiden, surname Jue, named Hui, styled Bilie, six inches and six fen tall, wears a sash of blue treasures and divine light brocade with nine colors of cloud and mist, her head adorned with a jade treasure flying cloud headdress, crowned with the dark yellow Worthy Crown, dwelling in the supreme Upper Supreme Kunlun Great Hidden Palace, Bright Hall Mansion, Nine Light Village, Great Transformation neighborhood, governing the body’s Heavenly Court Palace.

The Great Ultimate Imperial Consort, surname Xuan, named Xusheng, styled Bowu, seven inches and seven fen tall, wears a sash of dark gauze flowing light with five-colored phoenix patterns, her head adorned with a seven-treasure dark cloud headdress, crowned with the Infinite Worthy Crown, dwelling above the Original Scenery in the Supreme Clarity Extreme Profound Palace, Jade Chamber Mansion, Three Elixir Village, Elixir Origin neighborhood, governing the body’s Ultimate Truth Palace.

The Most High Lord and Lady, surname Qian, named Hanhai, styled Hexiansheng, three inches and three fen tall, wears a sash of seven treasures flying essence, dark light cloud brocade, frost gauze with nine-colored patterns, her head adorned with a nine-mysterious jade essence falling cloud headdress, crowned with the dark yellow Infinite Three Treasures Jade Crown, dwelling above the Supreme Clarity Nine Mysteries in the Cavern Floating Ultimate Truth Palace, Elixir Essence Mansion, Cloud Light Village, Mysterious Mysterious neighborhood, governing the body’s Great Sovereign Palace.

Those who walk the Way of the Profound Elixir, guarding the Three-One secret, must preserve the Four Female True One spirits, their clothing, form, name, style, and dwelling place. This treasured scripture’s upper chapter is transmitted only to those who have become perfected beings; beginners cannot grasp its essentials. The simple spirit’s secret is not practiced in the world. Whoever receives the Supreme Truth method and the Three Treasures Divine Scripture, though they penetrate numinous subtlety, if they do not know the Four Female True One method, they will achieve nothing.

Therefore, the Most High marks it with stern prohibition, punishing light disclosure, not recorded on paper or ink. Those who have it should carefully examine their inner heart before receiving it. On every New Year’s Day, the first day of the month, and the day of the Tai Sui or one’s birth, bathe and observe purity, enter a chamber facing the proper direction, visualize the Four Female True One spirits, their dwelling names, clothing colors, lengths, as above. After finishing, knock the teeth thirty-six times and recite the incantation:

*“Supreme True Yin Spirit, titled the Female Spirit, transforming the Nine Mysteries, riding the True Hidden Darkness, daily reporting to Heaven’s Mystery, reporting fasting to Supreme Clarity, heart focused, eyes watching, penetrating spirit form, returning to palace guarding the abode, jade blossoms fragrant and full, five colors changing, flowing yellow, purple, blue, directing flying clouds, ascending to the Imperial Court.”*

Upon finishing the incantation, swallow breath thirty-six times and stop. After nine years thus, the face blossoms jade radiance, golden truth reflects light, the spirit sees the body form, and converses with you. Once you have seen the spirit and know yourself, be careful not to spread it recklessly.

These Four Female True One spirits are the Yin officials born from Heaven’s primal beginning, titled Imperial Consorts. Their primordial qi is not yet established, the five administrations not opened, light and shadow not connected, infinite and void, without up or down, without outside or inside, without left or right, without front or back. They are the Most High’s primordial essence, the Profound Beginning’s wondrous truth, preceding the extreme void, condensing qi and coagulating, mixing and transforming myriad things, the foundation of Heaven and Earth’s existence—all arising from the Four True Ones. Those who have the will and heart to contemplate them will live a thousand years unaware, for within the primordial Heaven, myriad spirits share longevity.
