### The Secret Method of the Three Elixir Fields of the Nine Purple Palaces

As for the path of retreating within, one withdraws from the south and moves toward the north behind the nape of the neck. Above the space between the two eyebrows, one retreats upward three fen (a traditional measurement), to guard the twin fields of the inch; retreating one inch is the Palace of the Bright Hall; two inches, the Palace of the Cavernous Chamber; three inches, the Palace of the Elixir Field; four inches, the Palace of the Flowing Pearl; and five inches, the Palace of the Jade Emperor. One inch above the Bright Hall is the Palace of the Heavenly Court; one inch above the Cavernous Chamber is the Palace of Utmost Reality; one inch above the Elixir Field is the Palace of the Mysterious Elixir; one inch above the Flowing Pearl is the Palace of the Supreme Sovereign. Altogether, the head contains nine palaces.

The Elixir Field above the space between the eyebrows, the Elixir Field in the crimson palace of the heart, and the Elixir Field three inches below the navel together form the Three Elixir Fields. The infant dwells in the upper Elixir Field; the perfected person resides in the middle Elixir Field; the infant emperor dwells in the lower Elixir Field. Within the Elixir Fields dwells the Primordial True One Emperor, who governs together with two others, jointly overseeing the Elixir Field Palace, guarding the dao of the Three Primordial True Ones.

Guarding the twin fields of the inch is the enclosure of the Yellow Gate and Purple Door, the Crimson Terrace and Azure Chamber, together forming the left and right ears within the guarded inch. On the left side of the guarded inch is the Crimson Terrace; on the right side, the Yellow Gate. The perfected person enters and exits their palace through the path between the Yellow Gate and Crimson Terrace. Thus, placing terraces and gates on the left and right of the dao serves to oversee the extraordinary qi, watching for the comings and goings of the perfected person. Within the guarded twin fields dwell two great spirits.

Within the Palace of the Bright Hall, on the left is the Bright Child True Lord; on the right, the Bright Maiden True Official; in the center, the Bright Mirror Spirit Lord. These three lords jointly govern the palace, dressed in colorful brocade robes, belts adorned with four red bells, their mouths holding red mirrors, bells and red jade alike. Their appearance is like that of infants; seated, they all face outward, or sometimes face one another.

Within the Palace of the Cavernous Chamber dwell three true beings: on the left, the Noble Youth Without Brilliance; on the right, the White Primordial Lord; in the center, the Yellow Elder Lord. These three jointly govern the palace; this is the dao of the flying perfected.

The Palace of the Elixir Field measures exactly one inch on each of its four sides.

The Palace of the Flowing Pearl is the dwelling of the Director of Destiny, who wonderfully carries out the dao.

The Palace of the Jade Emperor is where the Divine Mother of Jade Clarity resides.

The Palace of the Heavenly Court is where the True Maiden of Supreme Clarity dwells.

The Palace of Utmost Reality is the residence of the Empress of the Great Ultimate.

The Palace of the Mysterious Elixir measures one inch square, the Purple Chamber with Green Room, filled within with vermilion smoke. Inside dwells the True Lord of the Mud Pellet, the Great One of Oneness, whose appearance is like that of a newborn infant. Seated upon a golden bed beneath a jade canopy, dressed in purple embroidered brocade robes, belt jingling with bells of flowing fire. These bells of flowing fire have no substance but emit red light; when moved, their sound carries ten thousand li. This is the treasured bell of the Perfected True One Huang Taiyi of Supreme Clarity. Seated precisely in the Palace of the Mysterious Elixir, with no attendants to left or right, hence named the True Lord Taiyi.

The triad of ones is the spiritual ancestor of the one body, the root of life for all spirits and gods, the mountain source of fluids and essences, the jade chamber of soul and spirit. Thus, the stomach pool is square to receive things; the brain palace is round and empty to suit the true; myriad hairs stand erect, a thousand pores emit smoke; virtue completes Heaven and Earth, the cavern is one with the Great Mysteryâ€”hence it is called the Mud Pellet. The Mud Pellet is the spirit of the physical form.

The Palace of the Supreme Sovereign is where the Most High Lord and Lady reside.
