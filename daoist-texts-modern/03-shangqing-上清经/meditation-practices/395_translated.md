## Scripture of the Supreme Clarity’s Returning Spirit Soaring to the Heavens to Summon the Five Stars’ Highest Method

### Returning Spirit, Soaring to the Heavens, Summoning the Five Stars’ Highest Method

The method of returning the spirit, nourishing and drinking in, summoning the Five Stars, and ascending into the heavens: The upper flow reaches the Seven Mysteries, the lower dissolves the myriad forms, blending the ten thousand transformations, establishing the profound thread, bathing in orchid fragrance, entering the chamber with pure fasting. Cultivate this method: the five viscera shine clearly, the seven orifices radiate brightly, the spirit guards the crimson mansion, the form ascends the five dawns—thus reaching the utmost wondrous method, passed only to the true. The so-called Dao of knowing is easy; the cultivation of the method is difficult. The difficult Dao of cultivation—should it not be kept secret?

One must always, on the days of Jiazi, Jiawu, Yiyou, Yimao, Jichou, Jiwei, Wuchen, and Wuxu, bathe and fast purely, enter the chamber, sit or lie at ease, gaze inward, hold the hand over the heart, and imagine reverently the Eastern Azure Emperor. His true name is Tongming, styled Gaijing; he wears a blue kerchief, blue robe, blue crown and shoes, girded with the emblem of radiant yang clouds. He enters my body. Also, think of the four true spirits in the liver, named the Azure Bright Lord, styled Minglun Boy, who constantly guards my liver, watches the gate of the stomach tube, beneath the membranes and fats, firmly sealing the path of death’s breath, bestowing upon me the azure essence, moon water, and jade ganoderma. Thus preserving the light essence of the planet Jupiter, drawing down through the mouth and throat ninety times, filling the qi to the utmost in the liver’s mansion. Practice this for nine years, commanding nine jade maidens of the Eastern Azure Waist to attend at the side.

Next, think of the Southern Red Emperor, named Taiyang, styled Huanlin; he wears a red kerchief, red robe, red crown and shoes, girded with the emblem of four bright vermilion and jade. He enters the subtle body. Also think of the One-Yuan Dan Emperor in the Crimson Palace, named Shenyunzhu, styled Zinan Dan, also called Sheng Shangbo, and by history known as Ju. He constantly guards my crimson palace, watches the gate of the nape bone and head, cutting off the path of death’s breath, bestowing upon me the cinnabar essence, red water, and jade ganoderma. Thus preserving the light essence of the planet Mars, drawing down through the mouth and throat eighty times, filling the red qi throughout the crimson palace. Practice for nine years, commanding eight jade maidens of the Southern Red Jade Tablet to attend at the side.

Next, think of the Western White Emperor, named Tongyin, styled Yuanqi; he wears a white kerchief, plain robe, white crown and shoes, girded with the emblem of bright spirit and gentle hope. He enters the subtle body. Also think of the six true spirits in the lungs, named the Supreme White Lord, styled Liangnanzhong Boy, who constantly guards my lungs, watches the twelve gates, cutting off the path of death’s breath, bestowing upon me the white ganoderma, moon water, and jade essence cinnabar. Thus preserving the light essence of the planet Venus, drawing down through the mouth and throat sixty times, filling the star qi throughout the lungs. Practice for nine years, commanding six jade maidens of the Supreme White to attend at the side.

Next, think of the Northern Black Emperor, named Tongshen, styled Zigui; he wears a dark green kerchief, black robe, dark green crown and shoes, girded with the emblem of luxuriant true flute and phoenix. He enters the subtle body. Also think of the seven true lords in the kidneys, named Xuanyang Lord, styled Mingguang Xiansheng, who constantly guards my two kidneys, watches the gate of the back bone and earth gate, blocking the path of death’s breath, bestowing upon me the mysterious yin cinnabar ganoderma and nine-liquid water. Thus preserving the light essence of the planet Mercury, drawing down through the mouth and throat fifty times, filling the star qi throughout both kidneys. Practice for nine years, commanding five jade maidens of the Supreme Mysterious to attend at the side.

Next, think of the Central Yellow Emperor, named Wanfú, styled Taicang; he wears a yellow kerchief, yellow robe, yellow crown and shoes, girded with the emblem of the Central Origin’s Eightfold Jade Gate. He enters the subtle body. Also think of the five true lords in the spleen, named Yangguang Lord, styled Taichangzi, who constantly guards my spleen, watches the gate of the root extremity, cutting off the path of death’s breath, bestowing upon me yellow water, moonlight, jade fetus, and ganoderma cinnabar. Thus preserving the light essence of the Central Controlling Star, drawing down through the mouth and throat twelve times, filling the qi throughout the spleen. Practice for nine years, commanding twelve jade maidens of the Yellow Plain to attend at the side.

Next, think of the Supreme Mysterious Primordial Father Lord, named Gaotongsheng, styled Left Returning Bright; and the Lower Primordial Mysterious Mother, named Shuhuowang, styled Right Returning Light. These two spirits guard the root of my original life, sealing the source of death’s breath, bestowing upon me yang ganoderma and yin essence, nourishing and feeding my body. Preserving the light of the sun and moon’s two images, illuminating one form, drawing down the light and color thirty-six times through the mouth and throat, filling the light qi abundantly in the palace of the lower elixir field beneath the navel. Practice for nine years, the face grows golden, eyes emit flowing light, commanding the six Jia, summoning and controlling the six Ding, at will as desired.

The perfected one approaches the chamber, preserves and contemplates the five emperors and two images of true spirits. When the matter is complete, he utters the blessing:

“The Five Stars entwine, their light flowing within bright; the Two Images fly like rosy clouds, irrigating the Five Essences. True spirits guard the treasury, long preserving yellow tranquility. The Great Unity strives, transforming fetus and returning infant. Liver and lungs conjoin their blossoms, heart and kidneys glow full. The spleen preserves the Central Origin; the Five Ganoderma receive life. The sun and moon’s precious light merge with the emperor, soaring through the void, ascending to the Jade Clarity.”

Cultivating the returning spirit, nourishing and summoning the Five Stars to soar into the sky—when the work is done here, practice for nine years, preserving the blessing without loss, the numinous spirit shining within. The Three Origins come to the chamber, severing death’s breath in the nine chambers, crossing the register of life in the Southern Palace, receiving the profound instruction of the Five Spirits, swallowing the Two Images for longevity, the five viscera blossom without decay, soul and spirit guarded and settled, extending years.

## Calming the Spirit and Nourishing Life: Inner Reflection and Flying Immortal Highest Method

The Heavenly Emperor of the Supreme Subtlety commands calming the spirit, inner reflection, dissolving cellular knots, solidifying the soul and condensing the spirit, blending transformation into the profound truth. Opening the six palaces, the five senses receive numinous power, swallowing qi and reflecting truth, fragrant ganoderma arises spontaneously, the stomach tube knots and connects, spirit clears and body purifies, the jade chariot stands ready, ascending the white sun at dawn.

One must always fast purely, bathe, burn incense, enter the chamber, pacify the heart, abandon weariness and cast off dust, suddenly free and unblocked, focusing attention without sleep. Then the true form can be seen, the wandering spirit can return. Each dawn, facing east, sitting calmly, eyes closed, inwardly preserving the form’s bright color, calling its true name to return and guard the original palace, knocking teeth thirty-six times to open. Then preserve and send forth the spirit names:

- The spirit of the head named Canghua, styled Taiyuan, form two inches and one fen long;
- The brain spirit named Jinggen, styled Niyuan, form one inch and one fen long;
- The eye spirit named Mingshang, styled Yingxuan, form three inches long;
- The nose spirit named Yulong, styled Lingjian, form two inches and five fen long;
- The ear spirit named Kongjian, styled Youtian, form three inches and one fen long;
- The tongue spirit named Tongming, styled Zhenglun, form seven inches long;
- The teeth spirit named Wufeng, styled Luoqian, form one inch and five fen long.

The seven spirits of the face, all dressed in flying gauze skirts, appearing as infants. Preserve these with care and precision, arrayed in one face, each guarding its palace. When finished, knock teeth twenty-four times, swallow qi twelve times, and recite the incantation:

“Spirit source scatters qi, qi condenses into spirit, distinguishing front and back, governing the mud pellet, supporting above and below. The seven spirits spread and array, flowing forms escape and change, lovingly nurturing the splendid origin, guiding and leading the eight spirits, ascending through the cavern gate, guarding the body and capturing the light, rising to the imperial dawn.”

When complete, next think of the spirits of the heart named Danyuan, styled Shouling, form nine inches long; lung spirit named Haohua, styled Xucheng, form eight inches long; liver spirit named Longyan, styled Hechangming, form seven inches long; kidney spirit named Xuanming, styled Yuying, form three inches and six fen long; spleen spirit named Changzai, styled Huntíng, form seven inches and three fen long; gallbladder spirit named Longyao, styled Weiming, form three inches and six fen long. The six palaces’ true spirits, all dressed in cinnabar brocade flying skirts, reside within the five viscera, the six palaces. Their forms resemble infants, their color like splendid children. Preserve these carefully and array their forms. From dawn to dusk, think and do not forget, knock teeth twenty-four times, swallow qi twelve times, and utter the blessing:

“The five viscera and six entrails, true spirits all return, governing the crimson palace, following above and below. The golden chamber’s red children face the four gates, the hidden chamber’s mysterious palace, the spirit hall’s pivot and mechanism. Blending transformation to birth spirit, true qi subtle and refined, preserving and refining the elixir field, shining as bright as the sun, obtaining the eight images, merging form and ascending to fly.”

When complete, next think of the three true essences of the jing and blood, named Yuansheng Lord, styled Huangningzi, who constantly guards the source beneath my two orifices; the two true lords of joints and bones, named Jianyu Lord, styled Ningyuzhu, guarding my Taicang mansion and the mouth of the five intestines; the one true spirit in the heart, named Tianjing Jinye Lord, styled Feisheng Shangying, guarding the four extremities’ mouth in my chest; the true male of the nine origins, named Ju Zhi, styled Sanyang, guarding my left ear’s hidden morning gate; the sovereign female of the imperial one, named Shanggui, styled Dizǐ, guarding my right ear’s hidden morning gate; the purple plain left yuan lord, named Yiyu Wuren, styled Anlaishang, guarding the border of my head and face; the yellow plain middle lord, named Yuanhua Huangren, styled Taizhangshang, guarding the border of my chest and abdomen; the white plain right yuan lord, named Qiming Xiaoren, styled Jinmenshang, guarding the border of my lower gate; the life director at midday, named Jiesheng, guarding my left hand center; the peach lord at midnight, named Fangying, guarding my right hand; the one yuan white qi lord in the fetus, named Wuxuanzi, styled Yushangsheng; the Taiyi jinghun, named Xuanguizi, styled Shengchang, two spirits guarding the upper connections of my five viscera, the root of the throat; the blue qi lord in the knot, named Anyanchang, styled Heheying; the yuan lord jinghun, named Baogutong, styled Mingfu, two spirits guarding the lower connections of my five viscera, above the great stomach; the black qi lord in the joints, named Binlaisheng, styled Jingshangmen; the imperial true jinghun, named Youtaisheng, styled Guanshangsheng, two spirits guarding the mouth of my nine intestines, beneath the hidden source; the yellow qi lord in the womb, named Zumingche, styled Shenwuji; the heavenly emperor jinghun, named Liweicang, styled Fazhu, two spirits guarding my lower abdomen, the root of the two orifices; the red qi lord in the blood, named Hunlizi, styled Shubaojian; the life director jinghun, named Fazhuizi, styled Qingxuan, two spirits guarding my hundred gates and the blood’s severing joints; the Supreme Mysterious Primordial Father Lord, named Gaotongsheng, styled Left Returning Bright; the Lower Primordial Mysterious Mother, named Shuhuowang, styled Right Returning Light; the imperial sovereign Taiyi, named Chongmingkong, styled Youliaowu; the nine emperor venerables, named Mingzhen, styled Zhongdisheng; the supreme emperor jinghun, named Youyangtangyu, styled Baling; the nine gate souls, named Lvhui Dao, styled Jueming; the heavenly record emperor soul, named Zhaowua, styled Guangshen. The seven spirits guard the root of my original life, sealing the gates of death’s path. Preserve and bless all true spirits from head to navel, all shining brightly. Then let the golden liquid flow in circles, jade blossoms reflect the soul, spirit overflow in the deepest intestines, imperial qi fill the nine gates, the seven ancestors spread and release in the three apprentices, receiving rebirth in the Southern Palace, guarding the living spirit in one body, spreading true qi to secure the years. When complete, knock teeth thirty-nine times, and bless:

“Qi is born from non-being, qi condenses into spirit, yang qi is pure outside, yin qi completes inside, the two images intertwine, interweaving the primordial spirit. Inner truth guards and defends, nine orifices receive life, preserving soul and solidifying spirit, myriad spirits rest in peace, guarding my three gates, ganoderma blossoms full, ascending with me, together soaring to the Jade Clarity.”

When complete, swallow qi thirty-nine times. To guard the thirty-nine gates, qi moistens and flows throughout the body. If one can abandon weariness, not cling to worldly dust, calm the heart and pacify the mind, clearly see the empty chamber, glance inward and observe, guard the spirit and solidify the soul, sever death’s breath at the nine gates, guard the living palace at the upper gate, circulate and preserve the blessing, speaking as if face to face, day and night for three years, the true spirit reveals form, brilliant light returns to root, decayed teeth and bones grow anew, the five viscera knot and connect, internally replenished and full, commanding and summoning the six Jia, driving and urging the six Ding, inviting the guests of the nine heavens to the chamber, spirits descend on the three pure palanquins, spirits fly and forms rise, ascending the white sun at dawn.

The name of the supreme true spirit’s precious treasure is the Inner Character, which guards within the human body, operates with the qi of the Nine Heavens, and secures the mechanisms of the six palaces. All myriad essences transform and arise from spirit; when spirit guards, life is born; when spirit departs, one perishes. With diligent heart and accumulated feeling, one can raise the human form and ascend to the mysterious palace. The Dao of seeking immortality does not know the inner names of form and spirit, nor how to fill and seal the gates of death—how then can life be hoped for? Those who cultivate this Dao must not wear filthy shoes, nor eat the five pungent spices, wine, or meat, lest they offend the correct qi and the spirit depart. People know rich dishes please the palate, and rank and salary honor the body, yet they do not wish for sweet food, which is the axe that harms life; rank and luxury consume the source of truth. Therefore, the spiritual person loves seclusion and quiet, does not dwell in the body, nor reveal form in the mundane dust. Those who cultivate life should be cautious indeed.
