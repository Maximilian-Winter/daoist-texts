## Scripture of the Supreme Clarity on Transforming Forms, Concealing Visions, Ascending, and Preserving Immortality — Supreme Scripture

At the center stands the Yellow Lord of the Dao and Longevity, who receives from the Great Emperor of the Supreme Subtle Heaven the transformed form and concealed vision to ascend the Jade Clarity Supreme Scripture. He preserves the Eight Visions to move the body, contemplates the Five Clouds to raise the form, commands the Purple Degree to summon the void, wields the Flame Light to call forth the numinous, circles the Three Dawns to pour in mystery, draws the primordial essence of the Seven Dippers, sets the Moon Mechanism within the sleeping chamber, and accumulates divine resonance in the silent courtyard. Since the Golden Script of the Eastern Flower, the profound pattern and jade name, none have been able to open and read the chapters of the High Emperor.

Those who cultivate the dao of concealing vision, at every one of the Eight Seasonal Nodes—when the Eight Emperors gather in assembly—bathe in orchid fragrance, observe pure fasting in secluded chambers, enter the room and sit in stillness, fix their gaze and contemplate the Subtle Azure Emperor Lord, named Fengzi. He wears the Golden Splendor Crown of the Supreme Mystery, dons a cloud-radiant brocade robe, girds the talisman of Nine Radiances that connects the light and the yang mists, rides the chariot of one vision borne on eight pure purple clouds, and grants me the Great Radiance Morning Concealment Talisman. With cloud qi covering my crown, my body feels itself rising with the vision; I knock my teeth twenty-four times through the passages, swallow breath eight times, then stop.

Next, I contemplate the Middle Subtle Red Emperor Lord, named Ding Guangyan. He wears the Two-Pure Treasure-One Crown, dons a cloud-radiant brocade robe, girds the talisman of the Primal Morning’s Four Bright Vermilion and Jade, rides the chariot of two visions borne on seven pure scarlet clouds, and grants me the Cloud-Viewing Primal Morning Concealment Talisman. With cloud qi covering my crown, my body feels itself rising with the vision; I knock my teeth nine times through the passages, swallow breath nine times, then stop.

Next, I contemplate the Purple Subtle White Emperor Lord, named Liang Yuanshi. He wears the Hibiscus Crown, dons a mysterious spirit brocade robe, girds the talisman of the General Morning’s Bright Spirit Supporting Hope, rides the chariot of three visions borne on six pure red clouds, and grants me the General Morning Nine-Poles Concealment Talisman. With cloud qi covering my crown, my body feels itself rising with the vision; I knock my teeth eleven times through the passages, swallow breath six times, then stop.

Next, I contemplate the Dark Subtle Black Emperor Lord, named Qi Yuanxuan. He wears the Nine-Primal Guest Crown, dons a mysterious cloud brocade robe, girds the talisman of Overlapping Radiance, Spirit Truth, Xiao, and Phoenix, rides the chariot of four visions borne on five pure blue clouds, and grants me the Overlapping Radiance Rotating Root Concealment Talisman. With cloud qi covering my crown, my body feels itself rising with the vision; I knock my teeth nine times through the passages, swallow breath five times, then stop.

Next, I contemplate the Beginning Subtle Supreme Emperor Lord, named Jie Kongzi. He wears the Mysterious Light Guest Crown, dons a cloud-radiant brocade robe, girds the talisman of Mysterious Vision, Mid-Primal, Eight-Directions Jade Gate, rides the chariot of five visions borne on four pure yellow clouds, and grants me the Mysterious Vision Morning Peace Concealment Talisman. With cloud qi covering my crown, my body feels itself ascending with the vision; I knock my teeth twelve times through the passages, swallow breath four times, then stop.

Next, I contemplate the Spiritual Subtle Middle Emperor Lord, named Kang Ewen. He wears the Far-Traveling Crown, dons a green brocade patterned robe, girds the talisman of Harmonious Radiance and Mysterious Mists, rides the chariot of six visions borne on three pure green clouds, and grants me the Harmonious Radiance Morning Life Concealment Talisman. With cloud qi covering my crown, my body feels itself ascending with the vision; I knock my teeth twelve times through the passages, swallow breath three times, then stop.

Next, I contemplate the Proclaiming Subtle Lower Emperor Lord, named Hong Fuzi. He wears the Three-Treasure Divine Crown, dons a single brocade patterned robe, girds the talisman of Uniform Radiance, Preserving Brightness, and Spirit, rides the chariot of seven visions borne on two pure purple clouds, and grants me the Uniform Radiance Morning Mysterious Concealment Talisman. With cloud qi covering my crown, my body feels itself ascending with the vision; I knock my teeth nine times through the passages, swallow breath two times, then stop.

Next, I contemplate the Cavernous Subtle True Emperor Lord, named Si Dengshu. He wears the Flying Cloud Purple Splendor Crown, dons a mysterious spirit brocade robe, girds the talisman of Primal Life, Preserving Form, and Mysterious Radiance, rides the chariot of eight visions borne on one pure spirit cloud, and grants me the Most High Dragon Smoke Concealment Talisman. With cloud qi covering my crown, my body feels itself ascending with the vision; I knock my teeth thirty-six times through the passages, swallow breath once, then stop.

Next, I contemplate the Nine Subtle Inner Emperor Lord, named Shen Mingxian. He wears the Purple Primal Three-Treasure Crown, dons a mysterious cloud brocade robe, girds the talisman of Morning Dawn, Eight Transformations, and Flying Palace, rides the jade chariot of cavernous vision borne on the Great Rosy Clouds and Purple Smoke, comes to grant me the Clear High Supreme Primal Limitless Supreme Dao Constant Concealment Talisman. With the cavernous vision chariot coming to welcome my body, I ascend to the Jade Clarity chamber. All completed, I knock my teeth thirty-six times through the passages, and recite:

> Eight Visions of Mysterious Smoke, dispersing qi in the void courtyard,  
> Veiling my body with Nine Mists, concealing visions in the profound darkness,  
> Treasure talisman descends mysteriously, riding the green palanquin,  
> Circling the Nine Dawns, abiding in my form,  
> Ascending to the Jade Chamber, paying homage to the Purple Court.  
> Complete. Swallow breath thirty-six times, then stop.

Next, I contemplate the First Star Emperor Lord of the Dipper, transformed and concealed as the Peach-Origin Inner Consort, named Taiyi Fatan, styled Xingzhengfu, wearing a yellow brocade cape and vermilion-blue flying skirt, with a disheveled cloud bun.

The Second Star Emperor Lord protects the fetus and transforms form as the Inner Concubine, named Taiyi Sanpeng, styled Luo Zhuying, wearing a blue brocade cape and green feather flying skirt, with a disheveled cloud bun.

The Third Star Emperor Lord is the Six-Escape Seven-Star Upper Primal Elixir Mother, named Taiyi Yunyi, styled Chong Shuangzhao, wearing a blue brocade cape embroidered with feathers and splendid skirt, with a disheveled cloud bun.

The Fourth Star Emperor Lord conceals vision and hides light as the Mid-Primal Inner Consort, named Taiyi Qilie, styled Qiu Hengying, wearing a purple brocade cape and yellow feathered skirt, with a disheveled cloud bun.

The Fifth Star Emperor Lord transforms body and changes vision as the Great Daughter of the Dipper, named Taiyi Yushu, styled Chou Qiulan, wearing a vermilion brocade cape and purple-blue flying skirt, with a disheveled cloud bun.

The Sixth Star Emperor Lord conceals traces and scatters images as the Middle Daughter of the Dipper, named Taiyi Qijing, styled Baodingling, wearing a vermilion brocade cape and blue embroidered flying skirt, with a disheveled cloud bun.

The Seventh Star Emperor Lord divides visions into myriad forms as the Young Maiden of the Dipper, named Taiyi Duyi, styled Tian Fanshu, wearing a cinnabar brocade cape and blue splendid feathered skirt, with a disheveled cloud bun.

The Eighth Star Emperor Lord transforms sun, moon, water, and fire as the Left High Empress of the Dipper, named Taiyi Shiqizhu, styled Luo Maohua, wearing a purple brocade cape embroidered with feathers and flying skirt, with a disheveled cloud bun.

The Ninth Star Emperor Lord transforms metal, stone, mountains, and rivers as the Right High Empress of the Dipper, named Taiyi Aitiao, styled Yun Yuxuan, wearing a green brocade cape and emerald feather flying skirt, with a disheveled cloud bun.

I preserve the Nine Star Emperor Lords’ concealed consorts of the Nine Yin Inner Names; their forms, colors, and garments all shine brightly. They come down from the Northern Dipper, their flame light streaming and radiant, dazzling the void. Circling spirits reflect mysteriously, entering within my body, dwelling in the Hall of Light, within the Purple Chamber, flanking the sun and moon’s two images, the Nine Dawns’ radiance arrayed. They successively transform into infants, the true forms of the Nine Emperors, named the Impermanent Children, resting in the portentous body, penetrating inside and out, their flame light and mysterious reflections heating throughout the body. I then knock my teeth nine times through the passages, and recite:

> Nine Dawns circle the summit, concealing and transforming the primal square,  
> Cavernous heaven’s nine origins, true children of the Dipper,  
> Flame light and mysterious reflections, filling the purple chamber,  
> A thousand transformations and myriad changes,  
> Changing visions as infant ignorance,  
> Going wherever the will directs,  
> Exiting without entering,  
> Gaining the ride of the Eight Visions,  
> Ascending to pay homage to the Emperor Sovereign.  
> Complete. Swallow breath nine times, then stop.

This supreme scripture of the Emperor Lords’ Nine Yin transforming forms and concealing visions, the Central Yellow Lord of the Dao and Longevity, the Southern Red Essence Lord, the Eastern Azure Youth Lord, the Northern Most High Lord, and the Western Supreme Simplicity Lord, all circle the Nine Yin to scatter forms, move the Nine Dawns to hide the body, cast flying wheels to ascend the void, ride the mysterious firmament to roam freely, releasing myriad transformations of vision, following the world’s rise and fall, as if moving in portent, where the Three Lights rest together.
