## Supreme Clarity Golden Primordial Jade True Emperor Sovereign Flying Immortal Supreme Scripture

The dao of the Supreme Clarity Golden Primordial Jade True Emperor Sovereign is the wondrous numinous method of the Qionghua Jade Consort of the Scarlet Terrace, nurtured with sweet nectar. This secret is kept within the palace of the Scarlet Terrace’s Supreme Pole in Supreme Clarity, carved upon jade books, and bestowed upon the worthy perfected persons. To walk this dao, one must purify the body and keep far from the peaks, cleanse the heart in distant forests, unify spirit and qi in profound oneness, and observe a pure fast for thirty days—only then to proceed. For fifteen years thus, the dao is perfected, and one becomes a Supreme Clarity perfected person.

One must also fashion golden vessels and scarlet implements to honor the scripture master, revealing the unspoken covenant. Then, according to the method, one refines and cultivates until the purple qi descends, the Jade Consort ascends the chamber, the five viscera shine brilliantly, the hundred bodies become as solid as metal, wrapped in scarlet clouds, receiving the jade writings of the Jade Emperor, and flying through Supreme Clarity.

Each dawn, at sunrise, one steps forth into the courtyard, burns incense, and sets out offerings. One knocks the teeth twenty-four times, then bows nine times to take position. Pressing hands upon the knees, awaiting breath to calm and mind to settle, one intensely contemplates the sun at its zenith, where flowing light and drifting rosy clouds stretch nine million zhang. From the sun’s descent, this light penetrates the body. After a long while, one draws in the rosy essence through forty-nine swallows into the abdomen, perceiving the five internal organs melting and reflecting, the surface wrapped in radiant light, the spirit observing the purple glow, connecting endlessly to Heaven. Then one knocks the teeth nine times and mentally utters:

> Primordial Essence, Great Spirit,  
> Purple haze richly born,  
> Golden light entwining,  
> Pouring to refine my form,  
> Dust of the corpse dissolves,  
> United with the dao and spirit,  
> Grant me insight profound,  
> Great Luo of Supreme Clarity.

Next, one envisions beneath the sun’s purple haze flowing light a female figure shaped like an infant, her head adorned with a triangular cloud bun, wearing a scarlet kerchief, dressed in brocade and splendid garments, bearing a pendant of pale jade. In her hand she holds the talisman of the Sun Emperor Jade True Purple Haze. She steps lightly upon the clouds and approaches before me, commanding utmost focus, forbidding distraction. Secretly one utters:

> Supreme Clarity Golden Primordial Scarlet Terrace Wondrous Numinous Qionghua Jade Consort,  
> Named Yu Dongzhu, styled Jing Mingying.

Three times thus repeated, one prays:

> Let my body command the purple haze,  
> Ascend to the sun’s palace,  
> Drink the jade clarity,  
> And live in harmony with the dao’s span.

Then one envisions the Jade Consort supporting my left hand with her right, lifting my form, flying upon the purple haze flowing light, rushing to the sun’s midst. After a while, feeling a slight warmth, I see my form within the sun’s gathered light, then behold the Supreme Clarity Golden Primordial Jade True Emperor Sovereign seated upon purple clouds at the sun’s center. His form is that of an infant, clad in red brocade and jade garments, a belt adorned with five bright moon pearls, the mouth holding a crimson sun. The sun emits nine rays, each ray tinged purple, each purple ray adorned with a jade essence, shaped like a chicken’s egg, as large as a pellet. The radiance descends, about nine inches long. The jade essences are nine-colored—purple, scarlet, blue, white, yellow, green, indigo, dark blue, and cyan. The jade essences rotate and the light and qi swirl.

Next, one envisions the Jade Consort to the emperor’s right, my form kneeling before, bowing nine times with heart, praying:

> Supreme Clarity Golden Primordial Jade True Emperor Sovereign,  
> Supreme True Dao Lord,  
> Named Long Jingteng, styled Scarlet Dawn.

Three times thus repeated. Then one envisions taking the jade essence into the mouth, beginning with pale jade, receiving the jade essence into the mouth, feeling slight warmth, then swallowing it into the lower elixir field.

Next, one envisions the indigo jade essence entering the elixir field, then the green jade essence settling in the bright hall, then the blue jade essence entering the inner chamber. These four jade essences suspend and fix in place, shining brightly like the sun. Then purple enters the left kidney, female the right kidney, scarlet enters the heart, blue the liver, white the lungs, yellow the spleen. They enter my five viscera, jade light intermingling, form and spirit united. One knocks the teeth nine times, envisions the form before the emperor, and prays:

> Numinous rays, mysterious transformation,  
> Nine jade divine essences,  
> Sun True Emperor Sovereign,  
> King of the supreme dao,  
> Purple haze surging and pouring,  
> Bright hall and inner chamber,  
> Refine my five viscera,  
> Self-generate jade pendants,  
> Precious marrow and elixir fluid,  
> Clouds soaring high in flight.

Suddenly forgetting the form, merging as one within the sun, after a long time the matter completes. One finds oneself unaware, seated as before, still as the sun’s shape. At the sun’s zenith, facing south in the chamber, pressing hands on knees, one contemplates the scarlet haze nine hundred feet long at the sun’s edge, flowing downward to connect with my body, shining brilliantly. One envisions the Qionghua Jade Consort holding a purple jade jar, stepping lightly upon the clouds, descending before me, and utters the secret name and style as before, thrice repeated.

Next, one sees the Jade Consort place the jade jar to my mouth, perceiving within the jar a yellow jade nectar. Drinking it, nine sips suffice. The heart holds the jade nectar, swelling like clouds, spreading through the five viscera, the whole body radiating red light. Then one prays:

> Qionghua Most True,  
> Spirit of the Sun Emperor,  
> Wielding wondrous transformation,  
> Guiding and harnessing the sun god,  
> Jade jar with yellow nectar,  
> Tasting the sun’s spirit,  
> Blossoming through the five viscera,  
> Long life renewed by the jar,  
> Form dwelling in the Scarlet Terrace,  
> Forever with qi in harmony.

Next, one envisions the Jade Consort bowing and taking my form, rising together to walk upon the scarlet haze, journeying to the sun’s center. There one clearly sees a scarlet jade terrace, towering a thousand leagues, within which lies a golden bed. One lies upon it, the Jade Consort facing south with head bowed, my form facing north. Then forgetting form, one dwells within the Scarlet Terrace.

At midnight, rising from the bed, facing the moon’s place, one bows five times with heart. One envisions within the moon a white glowing haze seven million zhang long, flowing downward to connect with my body. Within the haze is a female, head adorned with a crown of blue lotus petals, wearing yellow brocade, holding a golden plate containing a divine pearl like the bright moon. She slowly descends and stands before me. One knocks the teeth six times and prays:

> Within the moon, golden truth,  
> Supreme Clarity Divine Mother,  
> Named Yue Wu Ting, styled Wei Ni Yan.

Three times thus repeated. One takes the pearl and swallows it into the heart, causing light and qi to penetrate all four directions. One prays:

> Golden essence, primordial simplicity,  
> Divine pearl, utmost truth,  
> Essence and light densely shining,  
> Sweeping away heart’s dust,  
> Hundred spirits transformed and refined,  
> My qi united with brightness,  
> Wishing to dwell with the Most High,  
> Resting form in Supreme Clarity.

Next, one envisions the Golden True Divine Mother vanishing, merging with light and haze as one. I too forget form, vast and boundless, without grasp.

The Sun Emperor Jade True Purple Haze talisman, written in vermilion on blue silk, kept in a scarlet pouch and worn. Also made are small talismans inscribed on blue foil, to be worn on the first, third, fifth, seventh, ninth, thirteenth, fifteenth, seventeenth, nineteenth, twenty-third, twenty-fifth, twenty-seventh, and twenty-ninth days of the month. Facing east, one bows twice before wearing, and washes down with mysterious spring water.

## Text of Jade Clarity’s Naturalness

The Daoist who walks this dao must avoid filth, decay, and impurity. Diligently practicing for fifteen years, receiving the writings to become a Supreme Clarity perfected person, one gains mastery over flying dragons, emerging and entering the Great Ultimate with a thousand jade youths. Walking the path of the Jade True Emperor Sovereign’s consumption of the sun’s jade essence, the Jade Consort drinks the sun’s yellow nectar and golden truth.

Taking the method of consuming the divine pearl, the dao is fulfilled. The nine jade sun essences transform into nine elixirs, generating primordial spirit qi. After fifteen years, the nine jade essences transform into nine-colored divine dragons, the essence of the divine pearl transforms into a chariot of divine light, lifting the primordial body to ascend Supreme Clarity. Lord Wang of the Western City transmits the Great Profound Perfected Lord Mao, and Lord Cai of Wenshui secretly guards within the palace of the Scarlet Terrace’s Supreme Pole in Supreme Clarity. The Emperor and Jade Consort govern the regulation of immortal refinement.
