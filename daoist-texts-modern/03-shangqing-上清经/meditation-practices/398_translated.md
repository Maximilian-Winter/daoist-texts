## The Supreme Clarity Secret Dao of Nine Essences Returning Radiance to Unite the Spirit, Supreme True Jade Scripture

Beneath the Azure Profound Mansion, the Spirit Director of the Directorate of Fate, the Senior Minister of the Cavern of Spirit, having been bestowed the Strategy of the Directorate of Fate, the Golden Tower’s Supreme Guardian and Inspector of Immortals, Lord Yang of the Directorate of Fate, commanded the Eastern Flower’s Registrar and Keeper of Pure Ease, Master Li, to transmit the Supreme Clarity Secret Dao of Nine Essences Returning Radiance to Unite the Spirit, Supreme True Jade Formula.  

In the year of the Yin-Mao, Master Li, through the Supreme True Golden Flower Lady Jiang of the Northern Dipper Capital Directorate, descended and conferred the Spirit Director in the Southern Ridge, further transmitting the Supreme Guardian’s proclamation:  

*“The Supreme Clarity Secret Dao of Nine Essences Returning Radiance to Unite the Spirit, Supreme True Jade Formula, is the highest achievement of the Directorate of Fate. It is not taught to the lower True Ones of the world. It is neither jade slips nor golden inscriptions. Only those of vast talent and immense virtue, worthy of the Directorate of Fate, may hear of it. Practiced for nine years, it governs the palace’s golden chambers, the multitude of True Ones of the Directorate of Fate. Preserving it twice over, one returns to the Jade True. In time, the eyes emit purple lightning, the head shakes with ninefold radiance, coughing and howling with wind and cloud, harmonizing transformation with Heaven. Whispered words bring the Water Official’s drumstick to beat; revealed writings cause the nine essences to shift away. Recipients pledge on bended knee before the Eastern Flower. Before the功 is complete, it is firmly not taught to later disciples. The Jade prohibition is most weighty—therefore, honor it reverently.”*

### The Formula Says:

Before the Mid-Autumn Festival, observe fasting and purification by bathing. On the evening of Mid-Autumn, don new robes and headwear, and arrange precious incense in the courtyard. The precious incense is said to be a mixture of amber, incense from Anxi’s descending spirits, and aloeswood.  

With focused spirit and clear observation, fix your gaze upon the shooting stars. If you perceive unusual colors or radiant qi in the heavens, and feel a difference within yourself on the left side, then with intention draw it in, inhaling it into the left pupil’s core. Do the same with the right. If only one is attained, wait for the next year to complete it; if both left and right are attained, the path is fulfilled.  

Having gathered and drawn into both pupils, swiftly return to your chamber, sit facing south, join your hands in focused thought, preserving the two pupils as the image of sun and moon, suddenly ascending to the Bright Hall within. Between the eyebrows, one inch inward, lies the Bright Hall. The sun and moon’s radiance mingle and couple within the Bright Hall, revolving three hundred and sixty-five degrees. Your intention should feel stirred, as if enveloped in fragrant incense, sensing the sun and moon’s midst a flowing essence like molten sap descending into the Bright Hall, five colors lush and vigorous, warmly and gently heated. You should trust that a flowing essence is present. Then return it to the sun and moon pupils.  

Burn the precious incense and intone the spell:

> *“Summon the light, absorb the shadow,  
> Marvelous to utmost spirit,  
> The numinous child opens the chart,  
> The Great True, the One True,  
> Transforming and giving birth to the Most High,  
> The Supreme One, Honored Spirit,  
> Star cords stepping the leader,  
> Returning radiance to nine essences,  
> Refining and merging my vital breath,  
> Hundred blessings only renewed,  
> Strategy slips of the Directorate of Fate,  
> Ascend to the imperial palace.”*

After the spell, rest in peace. On the coming evening, no longer preserve thought but sleep. Repeat thus for nine nights. On the ninth night, at midnight, burn the precious incense and preserve the Bright Hall within. Without intention, one will see five-colored flowing essence, nurturing a jade infant, as large as the heart of a lotus seed, named the Supreme True Mysterious. Clearly behold it, click the teeth nine times, cover both ears with hands, and recite:

> *“Morning pivot, rosy dawn,  
> The Supreme One’s wandering chamber,  
> My mystery, my mystery,  
> Rise and sit in the Bright Hall,  
> Heaven and Earth begin true,  
> Five-colored jade light,  
> Wandering with breath and motion,  
> Open and expand with me,  
> Governing fate’s lower truth,  
> Directorate of Fate’s golden bed,  
> Long years without end,  
> Dao and virtue flow fragrant.”*

When the spell is complete, place both hands on the knees, preserve the nine stars of the Northern Dipper shining brilliantly in the heavens. Next, preserve the Bright Hall, from which purple qi issues, rising like a rainbow and mist, connecting to the Dipper’s star of the leader. Next appear two pupils: the left named Supreme True, the right One True. Ascend the Bright Hall, support the Supreme One’s jade infant, ascend upon the purple qi. Then preserve the consort and two pupils, guiding the Supreme One first to the celestial court’s Jade True abode. The infant bows to the Supreme One, begging for long life and the multitude of True Ones of the Directorate of Fate. One should then feel a slight itch in the celestial court, as if something is pointing between the eyebrows.  

Next, preserve and guide the Supreme One, ascending from the purple qi to the leader star. An emperor deity greets the Supreme One, recording the infant’s birth name and inscribing the death register. The Supreme One, the infant, and the two pupils walk the nine stars again. The Supreme One sits in the imperial star, the two pupils and infant stand guard. Suddenly, they ride the nine stars of the Dipper, cast down through empty space, red light and purple mist reflecting and merging with the infant’s body.  

The left breast chamber is called Ascend Morning Pivot, the right breast chamber Rise Rosy Dawn, the right arm chamber Real Person’s Abode, the left arm chamber Purple Origin Room, above the jaw chamber Suspended Rainbow Steps, between the philtrum and mountain source, within the nasal cavity, called Valley Quiet Rest, the celestial center chamber called Pay Homage to the Emperor Lord, the left eye chamber of the honored star Jade True called Green Field, the right eye chamber of the emperor star called Golden Cave.  

The star cords’ red light intertwines and flows, the purple qi and flowing mist merge and permeate the hundred veins, the nine stars solemnly take their fixed places. Next, preserve the Supreme One and the two pupils, riding the star cords’ red light, wandering and feasting among the nine palaces, then returning to the Jade True abode.  

Next, push the Ten Celestial Stems to return to the Supreme One’s resting court. They say: Jia is at Ascend Morning Pivot, Yi at Rise Rosy Dawn, Bing at Real Person’s Abode, Ding at Purple Origin Room, Wu at Suspended Rainbow Steps, Ji at Valley Quiet Rest, Geng at Pay Homage to the Emperor Lord, Xin at Jade True Abode, Ren at Green Field, Gui at Golden Cave.  

When finished, rub the red residence, pull the ears, lick the lips, touch the heart and say:

> *“The Supreme One, Most True,  
> Supports and connects the two pupils,  
> Nine stars, the supreme emperors,  
> Hear the command of the jade palace,  
> Overflowing, revolving one form,  
> Equal with Heaven and Earth,  
> Thus command the small infant,  
> Mount the flying dragon,  
> Red crow in imperial robes,  
> Beat drums and strike bells,  
> Coexisting in formlessness,  
> Long abiding without end.”*

After the spell, forget the form. Practice this once every nine days. After nine years, the path is greatly fulfilled. The Supreme Court’s Azure Lord bestows the Strategy of the Directorate of Fate, appointing it among the heavens. Practiced for one hundred days, one dreams of five colors or pheasant-like birds—these are the Supreme One’s palace and emperor descending upon the infant’s body.  

Avoid fish, spicy dried meat, wild goose, and bamboo shoots. Otherwise, food is unrestricted. If not severed from the One Source, one surely violates the Jade prohibition. If one fasts and practices,功 is tenfold increased.

### The Youthful Lord’s Fasting Recipe

Still suitable for this dao: take one stone of chicken heads, remove the shells, soak with five taels of fragrant green wood root, boil in one stone of clear spring water. During the hottest days, add three jin of narrow reed powder and ten taels of cinnabar powder, mix evenly, steam in a wooden steamer for one heat period, dry in the sun, store in a green pouch for preservation. Each time before eating, congeal with honey water, cook as a drink, take three times daily, and hunger will not arise. Though this recipe is not a talisman, taking it as food can also repel old age and grant long life.
