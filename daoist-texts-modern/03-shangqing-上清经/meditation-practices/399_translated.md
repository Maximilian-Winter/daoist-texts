## The Supreme Clarity Hua Morning Three-Run Jade Secret

The Most High Dao Lord said:  
“If you desire longevity, you must preserve the Nine Stars.  
If you desire to ascend to the true, you must know the Jade Morning.  
If you desire to soar and fly, you must diligently practice the Three Runs.  

Beneath the Floral Canopy lies the Northern Dipper, the pivot and aide.  
The Two Principles nurture the embryo; myriad transformations remain unopened.  
The Three Stars conceal their brilliance; the Three Qi swirl and blend.  
They gather crystal and contain light, condensing into the Three Stars.  
The arranged luminaries cannot join their function; the sun and moon cannot interfere with their governance.  

The Three Qi are the mysterious root, the return point of all spirits.  
Above lies the foundation of the Three Realms, the great sacred and precious imperial capital.  
Below spreads the pivot and handle of the Three Stars.  
In the middle is the Bright Hall, the Cavern Chamber, the true Jade Elixir—  
From which arise the Three-One Perfected, the divine children of the Red Infant and Yellow Court.  
By it, life and death are governed, concealment and dissolution, transformation and communication, flight and swift running, and everlasting existence—none do not proceed from this.  

At the base of the Floral Canopy’s lower end shines the bright and radiant star, the immovable Northern Star.  
This is the essence portion of the Jade Palace Mysterious Sovereign, the Most High Dao Lord, the true star of the Jade Emperor.  
Beneath the Floral Canopy, riding the Dipper chariot, roaming the Nine Heavens, attending the Nine Sages, serving a thousand perfected beings, dwelling on the Mysterious Terrace, holding the rank of Supreme Clarity.  

The aide star is the spirit of the High Supreme Jade Emperor, the Most High August Sovereign.  
The assistant star is the numinous spirit of the Jade Venerable of the Great Subtle Heaven.  
The aide is called the Eight Scenes; the assistant, the Seven Mornings.  
These are the great spirits of the Northern Dipper’s Nine Stars,  
Above assisting the Jade Emperor, below nurturing the primal origins,  
The pathfinders of myriad qi, the forerunners of the Way.  
They are the true essence of the Supreme Clarity Jade Emperor,  
Endowed with the seven primal scattered lights and the flowing golden fire bells,  
Riding the chariot of the Eight Scenes, ascending court to the Jade Palace.

The method is: when the stars rise, set a mat facing north, burn incense, bow nine times with heart reverence, sit calmly and receive the hand, close the eyes and contemplate the Three Stars each emitting purple light of jade hue, flowing down to the destined body like the sky clearing after rain, clouds returning in all directions, winds and mists withdrawing from the mountains, the whole body shining together, nothing not reaching the utmost.  
Within, penetrating the five viscera, flowing upward to the mud pellet, the eyes, pupils, and tongue root divided in sections, the purple qi light swirling, encircling ninefold.  
Swallow the qi liquid three times nine passes, knock teeth nine times to open, recite the yin incantation and blessing:

> Jade Emperor, High True One,  
> Three Mysteries gazing upward and dividing,  
> Left aide and right assistant,  
> Central pole of the purple palace,  
> Flowing essence in mysterious void,  
> Cavern empty nine returns,  
> Refining and purging the form and vessel,  
> Golden bones and green sinews,  
> The Three Emperors descend and connect,  
> Merging form to run as one,  
> Accumulating emerald precious robes,  
> Spirit-spirit flying skirts,  
> Wearing the scattered lights,  
> Waist adorned with flowing bells,  
> Sun and moon as chivalrous guards,  
> Dragon and tiger as winged wheels,  
> Eight Scenes bright chariot,  
> Constructing the seven mornings,  
> Supreme Jade light,  
> Ministers of the Jade Emperor.

Preserve the purple light of jade hue within the Three Stars, illuminating without limit, the stars and myriad things blending as one.  
Contemplate the Three Stars as large as the red sun, purple rays reaching eight directions.  
The Left Aide’s hanging light contains an infant, crowned with the Morning Treasure Crown of Heaven, wearing purple embroidered splendid robes, riding the qi and soaring down, appearing before the destined face.  
Knock teeth nine times to open, call out the yin name:  
“Left Aide Divine Palace, Jade Emperor Honored Spirit,  
Golden Palace Rear Sage, Peaceful Emperor Lord.”  
Heart contemplates the character *Nie* twice, incantation says:

> Imperial Star, primal essence,  
> Hall of the Rear Sage,  
> Peaceful Emperor Lord,  
> King of Supreme Clarity,  
> Master of myriad perfected beings,  
> Softly calling yin and yang,  
> Granting minister the Dao secret,  
> Begging minister the wondrous method,  
> Heavenly tassel, jade robes,  
> Crowned with mysterious light,  
> Below assisting with sincere wishes,  
> Allowed to dwell in the purple chamber.

Preserve the Right Assistant Divine Palace, the cinnabar jade chamber, Jade Emperor Honored Spirit,  
Taiwei Jade Emperor Lord, form and dress as before, knock teeth and call yin,  
Heart contemplates the character *Si* thrice, incantation says:

> Honored Sage Taiwei,  
> Commander of the pivot,  
> Assisting and aiding the mysterious constant,  
> Myriad spirits scatter and open,  
> Flowing essence to the mud pellet,  
> Refining and condensing the hundred bones,  
> Severing the womb and cutting roots,  
> Seven ancestral immortals fly,  
> Corpse knots severed and broken,  
> Bestowing minister feathered ceremonial dress,  
> Imperial robes embroidered,  
> Eternal kalpas returning together.

Contemplate the aide and assistant imperial true spirits floating on either side of the destiny, standing in light, towering above the head.  
Next, contemplate beneath the Floral Canopy the Jade Palace Honored Star’s purple qi flowing light, descending into the two emperors and the destined body.  
Looking upward, see the Jade Emperor’s limitless precious crown, red brocade jade robes, form like an infant, hand holding the jade seal, nine-colored round light illuminating heaven and earth.  
Knock teeth and call yin:  
“Jade Capital Golden Palace Most Holy Most True Jade Palace Purple Chamber Jade Emperor Supreme Sovereign.”  
Heart contemplates the character *Qi* thrice, incantation says:

> Opening and closing through myriad kalpas,  
> The Jade Emperor’s honor,  
> Dragon robes and phoenix seal,  
> Daring none to disobey,  
> Supreme true nameless,  
> Highest sage natural,  
> Below connecting the small destiny,  
> Three scenes floating chariot,  
> Riding with the emperor’s carriage,  
> Jade Palace’s heaven,  
> Pulling ministers from life and death,  
> Opening salvation of the nine mysteries,  
> Imperial grace and minister’s heart,  
> No before or after,  
> Flying form Jade Clarity,  
> Commanding the heavenly origin.

Contemplate the Three Emperors rising from destiny, floating and moving in nine-colored light through empty space.  
Suddenly see the precious jade emerald rosy clouds and the Eight Scenes chariot, driving nine dragons, ascending with destiny, attending within the emperor’s carriage, countless chariots and myriad riders, directly ascending to the Supreme Jade Palace.  
Thus forgetting the form.  
Diligently practice for five years, the Rear Sage descends the true.  
Seven years together riding the Jade Palace, roaming and galloping through myriad heavens.

The Most High Dao Lord said:  
“The Three Qi were not yet divided, chaos without form, residing in the obscure dark, unknowable by thought—one empty void.  
Emptiness is by nature stillness; stillness at its extreme is brightness.  
Brightness does not arise from birth; it is unknown how it comes to be.  
What is called brightness is the present knowing of the mysterious; brightness establishes form, darkness mutually contends.  
Brightness prevailing is yang; darkness prevailing is yin.  
Steaming becomes water; slackness becomes earth; congealing becomes metal; urgency becomes fire; surging becomes wood; dispersing becomes myriad things; flowing becomes transformation; condensing becomes region.  
Heaven and earth’s hundred treasures are what you can possess yourself.  
You are what you do; movement connects with feeling, humans and beasts each have knowledge; stillness connects with form, myriad things each have image.  
Movement and stillness never separate; people and things mutually embody and function.  

Therefore, life has nature; nature can know.  
Originally no knowing, but because of it called knowing.  
Form returns to nature’s constancy, neither ending nor beginning.  
Heaven, earth, and myriad things are alike, each by root and seed receiving their non-nature.  
People and beasts differ; wood and stone differ; five flavors unchanged since antiquity; one qi constantly transforms today.  
The sage penetrates the Dao, thus does not walk yet arrives, does not see yet is bright.  
The masses are ignorant of the Dao, thus drifting and flowing without return, taking the true as the thief.  
Not knowing that myriad things are one thing, Heaven and humanity one qi, only by forming shape to fix root and distinction.  
The Dao has no birth or death; splitting firewood and scattering brightness is like planting grain—one nourishes ten thousand.  
This year’s grain is not last year’s grain, yet it is not not grain.  
People are likewise; today’s eyes see ancient eyes, seeing only seeing, not ancient seeing coming to today’s eyes.  
Their seed is firm, their kind fixed, qi and flavor do not cross, yet their brightness is constant.  
What is called constant brightness is that brightness’s essence is brightness itself, not one brightness unchanging.  

Therefore, all have memory and forgetfulness, death and life; ordinary and sage are suspended and separated.  
Ultimate principle is manifest; transformation is seen.  
One who can obtain the true and forget feelings, repeatedly die and live without changing their own nature, then creation and transformation become one’s own gain.  
Though together with heaven and earth, where can one escape?  
When one is of the same body as the Dao, people and beasts, self and other, fortune and misfortune, no longer debated.  
The sage transcends the Dao’s domain, the true reaches the spirit’s homeland, mysterious and obscure without contention, shining with utmost virtue.  
Know my words on the Three Runs of the Way; once raised, it is accomplished, passed down by those true perfected beings of mysterious vigor.  
Fragile are the three rings of cinnabar and jade, one brocade of mysterious clouds, pledged as the Supreme Clarity’s standard.

The Great Most High Dao Lord said:  
“Other paths cultivated do not reach the Jade Emperor.  
Reaching the Emperor is the utmost.  
The Jade Emperor is the parent of heaven, earth, and myriad spirits.  
Now preserve the true of my primal birth, the spirit of the fetal origin, the root and foundation returning to the beginning of life—still possible to attain the Dao.  
How much more so when one’s strength embraces heaven and earth, skillfully carving myriad forms, employing yin and yang to walk the dao and virtue.  
Only the Jade Emperor’s Three Runs are the Most High’s Way.  
The Jade Emperor flows essence to the lord of the Bright Hall,  
The Rear Sage connects the spirit of the Cavern Chamber,  
Taiwei sits on the golden bed at the heart of the Mysterious Elixir,  
Above the gate of the Jade Palace Supreme Ultimate Jade Gate Purple Chamber’s truth.”
