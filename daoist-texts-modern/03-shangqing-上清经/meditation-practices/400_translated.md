## The Most High’s Flying Steps on the Southern Dipper and Taiwei Jade Scripture

In the southern heights of the great void, the True King of the Southern Peak, the Red Lord Songzi, when first learning the dao, came riding dragons and phoenixes, ascending the jade and crystal chambers of Taiwei. He rested beneath vermilion light, seated in the shade of bitter trees, dissipating qi into emptiness, concealing spirit within non-being. The profound essence does not open except through the dao; it is grasped firmly by Heaven for me.

The Supreme Clarity’s Elixir Blossom, the Purple Numinous True Maiden, shines forth the radiance of the celestial net beyond the luminous sky, flying up the jade meridian, circling the vermilion thread, summoning the true yang of the caverns, holding the scepter of the Southern Star, roaming freely in Taiwei, sounding the transcendent notes of the Nine Purities. Clouds swirl and lightning fills the air; the body merges with the obscure darkness, gazing downward upon the world.

With the Red Lord’s golden countenance and pure endowment, virtue complete and conduct perfect, a heart empty and free of dust, like the midnight moon, thoughts severed from worldly ties, like a lotus in water. Below, he teaches the Red Lord the highest, most exalted dao: the flying steps on the Southern Dipper’s six stars, the method of the elixir heavens, treading the Southern Star and Taiwei Jade Scripture.

The dao speaks of emptiness and caverns, planting roots on the threshold of being and non-being. Two luminaries suspend their essence between the great void; tendrils of brilliance stretch between the two poles. The red radiance flows forth; the six stars shine upon Heaven. Thus the great image has form; the primal chaos issues forth. It must begin from the Southern Dipper, where shaping and refining are accomplished.

Hence the six directions form the city walls, the six rites the cauldron vessel; the two principles are water and fire; expansion and contraction are advance and retreat. The Supreme One presides over the furnace; the emperor sovereign weighs the measures. The flying elixir endures nine hundred million years; the three stars array their brilliance; the host of stars mark the order.

Therefore, Heaven is the canopy, Earth the chariot, Sun and Moon the wheels, the four seasons the steeds. The Southern Dipper is the crown; the Northern Dipper the pendant; the imperial pole is established, creating all things. This is the subtle meaning of Taiwei, the profound secret words of the exalted true ones.

At Southern Prosperity’s Elixir Mound, the six stars are noble. Those who tread upon them first know the true names, then wear the true forms, first stepping upon their souls, then upon their spirits. Then they ascend the stars, traversing three circuits, the six stars reflecting their forms.

Practice for five years to become a True One of Supreme Clarity; nine years to behold the Six True Ones; reveal your utmost sincerity and be of one accord with the signs. At fifteen years, bind the vermilion net with your hands, sit as master of myriad spirits, ride the six flying dragons to ascend to Jade Clarity.

## Names of the Five-Star Souls

Jade Ring, Treasure, Amber, Exquisite, Luminous

The soul of the five stars begins at the Jade Ring, stepping forth; both feet reach the Luminous star, going back and forth three times. Preserve my being as I ascend the stars. Five true beings appear, dressed in vermilion robes, wearing jade crowns, shaped like infants, walking with me. They lower both hands, each twirling the tiger’s mouth with two fingers, knocking teeth five times, and ascend, saying:

> Lofty and clear in the cavern, southern soul of the five stars,  
> Circling the heavenly thread, descending the upper spirit,  
> Wearing elixir robes and jade countenance, harmonizing to carry me upward,  
> Divine masters and emperor’s friends, separation and union without form,  
> Sitting, shouting to immortals and saints, Supreme Ultimate and Supreme Clarity,  
> Body flying swiftly, four and one united in brightness.

Step around nine feet on the blue ground, marking stars with blue dots, using yellow as the thread.

## Names of the Seven-Star Spirits

Sharp, Carved, Mirror, Resounding, Strong, Pick, Storehouse

The spirit of the seven stars begins at Sharp, stepping forth; only one foot reaches Storehouse, going back and forth three times. Preserve my being as I ascend the stars. Seven jade maidens appear, wearing yellow robes, coiffed with precious buns, shaped like infants, walking with me. They raise both hands, twisting the root pattern of the three fingers with the thumb, knocking teeth seven times, and ascend, saying:

> Spinning vermilion threading the rosy clouds,  
> Pregnant with light and elixir spirit,  
> Seven jade maidens fair, enchanting the heavenly essence,  
> Clouds weave and scatter threads, yellow robes of great gods,  
> Sitting on divine grass of obscurity, containing and drawing forth mist,  
> Joining with my dao pivot, spirit stepping beyond dust,  
> Golden chariot, great carriage, dragon robes covering the body,  
> Sitting upright in the bright hall, guarding myriad spirits,  
> Supporting ascent to seven reflections, regulating Jade Clarity.

Step around nine feet on the blue ground, marking stars with yellow dots, using vermilion as the thread. At each step of soul and spirit, recite one star’s name, preserving one deity; thereafter, likewise. Burn incense on both sides.

The flying steps on the six stars of the Southern Dipper follow the method of stepping and obstacles. Each double-foot step must not reach the star directly; instead, follow the thread as a nail thread to reach the star with both feet. If double-foot stepping cannot reach the star, again follow the thread with both feet, allowing one foot to rest on the thread. One foot steps, two feet walk; stepping the thread. Treading the star thread in emptiness is the position of the Immortal King.

The Supreme Clarity’s Elixir Blossom Purple Numinous True Maiden first learned from the Red Lord; the Red Lord taught me within the elixir jade crystal palace, crimson terrace, and phoenix pavilion.

Those who neglect this may not become immortals; the Three Officials examine the soul.

This is the essence of the supreme dao, the mother of true mystery.
