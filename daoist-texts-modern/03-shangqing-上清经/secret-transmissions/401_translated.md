## The Great Register of the Jade Emperor’s Six Stars of Flight and Fate of the Three Qi of the Upper Clarity Elixir Heaven

The exalted perfected one of purple numinosity, radiant in the southern elixir, sits within the chamber of the azure dome and crimson palace, weaving lofty imaginings, climbing the tendrils of clouds, shining with the cave’s scarlet essence. The Southern Dipper blazes bright, dazzling the myriad heavens, summoning forth the Six Perfected Jade Emperor Dao Lords to emerge. They circle and spiral, soaring along the vermilion thread’s path, instructing the perfected ones to open Heaven and close Earth, to call the sun and draw the moon, to command a thousand spirits, true masters of fate, whose wondrous qi gives birth to all beings.

Holding the mysterious Jade Clarity scripture, grasping it to ascend the stars, they proclaim the mandate to the Six Perfected, born from the Southern Dipper, whose way of life endures eternally. One person receives the scripture, leaf by leaf, bearing the names of immortals, seated between life and death, treading waves and passing through fire, untouched by calamity or disaster. By practicing its essential way, one becomes an immortal king, emperor, or noble lord, refining form and spirit, crossing kalpas without end.

Engraved within the hall of the Elixir Heaven Phoenix Treasure, sworn to the highest perfected ones, the text reveals the exposed writings of walking corpses, examining bones and misfortunes, entering the gates of the Five Paths. Those who receive the elixir scripture carry it in a brocade pouch, wearing it close to the body, practicing according to the rules. They shall take the name “Eastern Splendor,” serving the imperial dawn. With a red coral bead, golden orchid, ascending the mysterious terrace, facing Heaven with solemn sincerity.

The initial subordinate perfected one, whose dao and virtue are not yet complete, must measure the breath with the Yellow Register, and further must swear blood and cut hair, observe long fasts, refine essence, bow the head in reverence, and then transmit it.

The dao desires to enact the way of the Elixir Heaven’s Six Stars, the method of flying and stepping upon the stars ascending. First, one must place the talisman of treading the void beneath the feet. The earth harbors hidden corpses, filth, poisons, and myriad spirits; by this one flees and drives them afar. Then the star essence descends to earth, yet the earth is not defiled by yellow dust; the earth deity unlocks the prison, the earth sinks and empties, spreading the diagram to ascend, reaching down to the cavernous source, flowing without blockage, floating without sinking, bright without darkness.

Step upon the stars above; star light enters the form, form and dao become one. Star qi is ever changing, responding to what is felt.

Use the Yellow Register with the thin purple ink above, placing it beneath the feet. Inside the scroll, besides the spoken words, all are written in vermilion.

**Talisman of treading the void and backing the earth, place beneath the right foot.**

**Talisman of treading the void and backing the earth, place beneath the left foot.**

The dao desires to become true: the form and vessel are already laid out, but the heart and soul are not yet refined. One must keep the Southern Dipper stars within the head: one star placed between the eyebrows, one star at the crown of the head, the remaining stars arranged from the jade pillow to the great vertebra. Day and night, think upon them, so that the star rays pierce through the spine; fiery heat arises, bones wither, form decays and declines. Then again think upon the six stars, slowly swallowing their qi, to grant long life. When lying down or sitting, bathing and eating, do not face south. Also, make images of the Six Perfected Lords from cinnabar, hanging on the left elbow for males, right elbow for females. Blessings and curses, thoughts on food and drink, all greatly prevail.

The dao desires to become true: one must think of the six stars in the hands, feet, heart, and brain. After long time, the Six Perfected descend their essence, refining the form, flying the spirit to Jade Clarity. The human form becomes like a perfected one, wearing brocade robes of red stars.

When the dao desires to rest at dusk, one must think of the stars filling the canopy like blazing fire, and recite:

> Elixir of mystery in the jade chamber,  
> Illuminating the gate of life,  
> Six Perfected Sovereigns above,  
> Guarding the southern pavilion,  
> I wield wondrous qi,  
> Entering and shining upon the imperial terrace,  
> Extracting and refining the nine ancestors,  
> Crossing the vermilion tomb to ferry the soul,  
> Purple brush and red script,  
> Opening the way and generating source,  
> Banishing evil dreams and misfortune,  
> Swiftly entrust to the imperial lord.

**Talisman for the crown of the head**

**Talisman for the elbow**

**Preserving the six hearts’ mansions**

**Talisman for the sleeping canopy**

The dao studies the Southern Dipper’s method, flying to ascend the tower of the Southern Heaven’s crimson capital. On the sixth day of the sixth month, the day of one’s birth, one must offer sacrifice, always with fresh fragrant offerings. Offer what one loves most, and at midday when the sacrifice is complete, step forth—great auspiciousness follows.

## The Left Scroll of Ascending the Southern Dipper for Long Life

The mysterious chart of the Golden Palace Fate Officer of the Upper Jade Clarity Great Jade Emperor, bestowed upon the immortals who fly and step the Southern Dipper’s vermilion threads. Possessing this scripture, one stores it in a special box, placing it before the Southern Dipper image. Wearing it during rites or taking it when traveling, even without stepping, one attains long life and immortality. Yet it is not granted to those of lower learning.

The Southern Tomb’s emissaries, along with the sixty thousand soldiers of the Three Qi of the Upper Clarity Elixir Heaven, guard the registers and preserve the truth within the Zi governance. Those without green bone script in their minds may not hear it. Those who obtain this scripture should be true officials of the Golden Palace, but not worldly greedy ones of the Earthly Official.

When the dao desires to bestow the scripture, it swears the oath according to the Upper Clarity’s rites, forbidding violation as law. In the year of the minister so-and-so, bearing precious cloth, he came to the master to request the Great Register of the Elixir Heaven Fate Officers, to fly and ascend the Six Stars, to rise to Jade Clarity, to announce and inform the Nine Heavens, to enable the portent to communicate the profound long life, and to serve the myriad distant fate officers of the imperial court.
