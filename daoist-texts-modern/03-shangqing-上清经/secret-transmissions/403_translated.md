## The Mysterious Scripture of the Supreme Clarity’s Golden Cabinet Jade Mirror for Cultivating Reality

The Most High Dao Lord, seated within the Purple Mist Forest of the Jade Void Cavern in Supreme Clarity, gathered with the celestial immortals and the true officials of the Three Realms. Together they convened, and the Lord spoke of this Mysterious Scripture for Cultivating Reality, saying to the assembly of immortals:

“Behold, the beings of the lower realms know not the true dao; they commit countless offenses, sinking endlessly into suffering. Those who sin do not know how to cleanse themselves; those who cultivate stray far from the true dao. Thus the evil paths overflow the roads, the gates of birth are sealed shut. Now I shall declare to you the essential words, directly unveiling the purpose of the Profound Origin, entrusting it to the pure and faithful lineage. Cultivate the body and preserve life; bring peace to the nation and tranquility to the family; fulfill your practice and achieve success; transcend the Three Realms; ascend and elevate your root ancestors; bless and prolong your descendants. This secret classic, this numinous chapter, you should listen to with utmost care.”

The Dao Lord said: “Heaven and Earth are bound and entwined; all things transform into their pure essence. They inherit their past karma, arising from causes and conditions in their appointed time. Father and mother unite harmoniously; man receives his life from them. When the fetus is complete and the qi is full, the spirit descends from the void. The Great One dwells in the brain, to stabilize the mud pellet. The steward of fate resides in the heart, to receive the source of life. On the left is the place of the ethereal soul; on the right, the white primordial spirit is formed. The Three Truths and Nine Palaces are arrayed in full order. The liver houses the soul, the lungs the corporeal spirit; the spleen holds the will, the kidneys the essence. The heart governs the abode of the spirit; the cinnabar field guards the numinous. The laws of Heaven resemble the forms of Earth, bearing yin and embracing yang. They divide and interweave the Five Phases, responding to the four seasons. The eyes are the sun and moon; the hair, the stars. The eyebrows are called the Flowery Canopy; the head is none other than Kunlun. Each has its palace and gate, where the spirit is securely placed. Among all things, man is the most precious and numinous. Life is born of the Dao; nature is endowed by the One. When things come into being, the spirit is clear and tranquil. It is like the uncarved wood dispersing, chasing away delusions and wasting the true. Impurity, stench, and filth disorder form and spirit. Quietly observe the self and the world: what is distant, what is close? Guard the dao and preserve life; do good and protect the true. The foolish are enslaved by things, suffering in vain. I now unfold the correct teaching, urging the worthy and heroic: diligently seek the essential meaning, daily refining and carefully cooking. Those who can remove sin and filth may extend their lifespan, ascend beyond the Three Realms, and rescue the underworld. Recite, uphold, observe rites and mindfulness, never retreat on your path. When your practice is complete and your conduct fulfilled, you will surely attain longevity.”

The Dao said: “The heart is the master of the form, the spirit’s dwelling place. Qi, fluids, blood, and essence—when the heart is at peace, all governs itself. When the government is dull, the people are simple; when the government is clear, the people are lacking. The way to nourish the heart is to be cautious of distractions; pride must not grow, desires must not be followed, ambition must not be filled, joy must not be excessive. No sin is greater than craving; no calamity greater than insatiability. If one can settle their portion and halt greed, empty the heart and dismiss desires, then the true source will be clear and deep, the numinous light will shine by itself, without thought or action, gradually uniting with the true dao.”

The Dao said: “Qi carries the form; the form is filled by qi. When the form is complete, qi remains; when qi is harmonious, the form is preserved. Heaven and Earth are made of clarity and turbidity; without qi, yin and yang cannot move. The sun and moon divide form by brightness and darkness; without qi, soul and spirit cannot interact. Many plants wither and decay, but only the pine and cypress remain evergreen—this is because their qi is strong. Fish perish in drought and silence; only the turtle and crane do not wither—this is because their qi abides. The form is the house that holds qi; qi is the talisman that protects the form. If you wish to preserve the form and remain in the world, you must first nourish qi, making it vast and firm, filling the space between Heaven and Earth. Qi gathers the numinous qi, roaming beyond wind and dust. Thus, know that qi is within man, and man is within qi; all things in Heaven and Earth are born through qi. Those who cultivate qi well nourish the body internally and repel evil externally. The common people use it daily without knowing. Those who understand cultivation silently accomplish it; it can save from hunger and cold, ward off evil and disease, repel venomous creatures and poisons. Qi can restrain them all; among myriad methods and countless defenses, qi is the ancestor. The way to nourish qi lies in careful speech and regulated diet, restraining anger and blocking desires, sealing the outlet, closing the gate, continuous as if always present, used without fatigue. The way to nourish the form lies in dulling sharpness and harmonizing brightness, managing disorder before it arises, being peaceful without strain, laboring without loss of strength, quiet without disturbance, disturbed without disordering qi. External supplements and internal benefits—nourish the form and preserve qi, and all is complete.”

The Dao said: “When form and qi are both established, one must protect the spirit. The mechanism of creation lies here. When essence is full, the spirit is king; when essence is depleted, the spirit declines. Gather essence to preserve spirit; employ spirit to stabilize form. The kidneys are the storehouse of essence; overuse exhausts it, so be frugal and sparing. The heart is the abode of spirit; overuse fatigues it, so be calm and nurture it. Only quietude and focus can be guarded within. Thus it is said: the true ultimate dao is deep and dark; the utmost dao is dim and silent, without seeing or hearing. Embrace the spirit in stillness; the form will correct itself. Be still and clear; do not strain your form; do not shake your essence. Reduce selfishness and desires, and then you may attain longevity.”

The Dao said: “The law is originally lawless; principle returns to nature. The heart is disturbed by circumstances; the law arises from the heart. The purpose of establishing law is to remedy what is lost and prevent what has not yet arisen. If a person violates the Three Wonders, first repair and treat them; when the repair is complete, then advance in practice. Advancing without completion is futile and fruitless. The method of repair is explained in the profound teaching of the Primordial Unity; the method of cultivating功 is fully expounded in the Lingbao scriptures. Previous功 verified, one may advance to the next功. When功 is full and true, high and low follow accordingly.功 without practice invites demonic obstruction; practice with功 lifts immortals and perfected beings. Good功, when perfected, brings auspicious blessings. Cultivate both nature and practice, clearly distinguishing ranks. Those who seek celestial immortals must establish one thousand three hundred good deeds; those who seek earthly immortals must establish three hundred good deeds. The dao thus advances; deviation retreats. Do not tread evil paths; do not deceive in the dark. Accumulate deeds and功; be compassionate to all beings; be loyal, filial, friendly, and harmonious; correct yourself and transform others; care for orphans and the widowed; respect elders and cherish the young; do not harm insects, plants, or grass. Such are called good people, respected by all, blessed by Heaven’s dao, accompanied by fortune and prosperity, kept far from all evil, their deeds surely fulfilled, and immortals may be hoped for.”

The Dao said: “Those who wish to cultivate the dao must first cease and eliminate. Ceasing means nothing arises; eliminating means all attachments cease. Then gather the sea of spirit and qi, conceal the breath in the cinnabar field, complete nature and preserve the true, remaining calm and settled. If this is maintained long, one naturally becomes oneself.”

The Primordial Heavenly Venerable sat in serene silence upon the empty mysterious throne, with thirty-six thousand spirits all paying homage within the precious pearl. Thus, the two lights combine with qi, spirits mingle in the cauldron of ten blossoms, man and woman incline their hearts, conjoin essence in the furnace of five qi, until the essence moves and the breath changes with the sound of the booming drum, exhaling and expanding at the mysterious gateway. Focused qi embraces spirit, cooking and refining in the vessels of male and female. Naturally, white returns to black; teeth fall and are reborn; youth returns to infancy; longevity and long vision are attained; life is fully preserved, harmonizing with the dao, becoming as firm and enduring as Heaven and Earth, lasting forever.”

The Dao said: “Those who study the dao establish virtue and功, refine qi and sit in forgetfulness, cultivate reality and master control, proclaim scriptures and expound teachings, assist the nation and save the people—these are their practices. Though功 and conduct may be complete, and fruit and result fulfilled, they must first deliver the Nine Mysteries and Seven Ancestors, the departed parents and spirits, transferring them to birth in Heaven, erasing all records of ghosts. Only then can the body truly attain the dao. Moreover, the common people of the world create evil and accumulate offenses, harming their root ancestors. I now, with compassion, declare essential words for recommending and delivering wandering souls, relying on功 and virtue. One may place beside the images of the Three Purities the clothing and effigies of the deceased, inscribing the Nine True Mysterious Seals according to the method. Let those departed roll and carry it, then perform rites with this scripture and repent three times daily. If one cannot repent, daily recite and hold in mind the Savior from Suffering Heavenly Venerable three thousand times. After all recitations, perform nine bows, then say: ‘I vow to deliver the soul and spirit of so-and-so, that they may quickly leave the underworld, ascend to the heavenly realm.’ The lightly guilty are delivered within three days; the heavily guilty ascend within nine days. Filial sons and daughters should earnestly and sincerely perform this rite.”

With devoted heart, respectfully bow to the Void and Nature Primordial Heavenly Venerable.  
With devoted heart, respectfully bow to the Most High Great Dao Jade Morning Dao Lord.  
With devoted heart, respectfully bow to the Most High Profound Origin Holy Patriarch Laozi.  
With devoted heart, respectfully bow to the Spirit Treasure Heavenly Venerable who unites heart and dao.  
With devoted heart, respectfully bow to the Spirit Treasure Heavenly Venerable who purifies and cultivates reality.  
With devoted heart, respectfully bow to the Spirit Treasure Heavenly Venerable who removes evil traces.  
With devoted heart, respectfully bow to the Spirit Treasure Heavenly Venerable who frees from sin and obstruction.  
With devoted heart, respectfully bow to the Spirit Treasure Heavenly Venerable who extracts suffering and dispels obstacles.  
With devoted heart, respectfully bow to the Spirit Treasure Heavenly Venerable who rescues the underworld.  
With devoted heart, respectfully bow to the Spirit Treasure Heavenly Venerable who extinguishes the wheel of suffering.  
With devoted heart, respectfully bow to the Spirit Treasure Heavenly Venerable who rescues from the nine hells.  
With devoted heart, respectfully bow to the Spirit Treasure Heavenly Venerable who ascends beyond the five paths.  
With devoted heart, respectfully bow to the Great Compassionate and Merciful True Person who saves from suffering.  
With devoted heart, respectfully bow to the Great Compassionate and Merciful Great Benefactor True Person.  
With devoted heart, respectfully bow to the Great Compassionate and Merciful True Person who removes sin.  
With devoted heart, respectfully bow to the Great Compassionate and Merciful True Person who universally saves.

After the rites, with utmost sincerity and reverence, the disciple and servant so-and-so humbly confesses: “I consider myself a mistaken being in the human world, fortunate to encounter the correct transformation, moved by the grace of Heaven and Earth’s covering and support, bearing the virtue of the sun and moon’s illumination. I reflect upon my parents, root and clan, their generation, nurture, and upbringing, recalling their great toil, truly deserving of my offering and repayment. Now, before the holy true ones, I incline my heart and earnestly pray, humbly beseeching the countless ancestors and departed spirits, that all past offenses accumulated through kalpas be fully pardoned; that those who have sunk and drifted in suffering may all seek freedom, instantly releasing grievances and darkness, following the light of wisdom to ascend and be delivered, swiftly reaching the mysterious shore, receiving the talismanic mandate to attend the true; forever leaving the cycle of reincarnation, jointly living in eternal joy. May Heaven’s qi return to the body, always under the dao’s shade. I have no words to express my deepest sorrow and earnest prayer.”

The Dao said: “Pure and faithful men and women, recommending the departed and blessing the living, requesting fortune and dispelling calamities, must be solemn and careful: incense, soup, fasting, and bathing; focused mind and devoted heart; rites and recitations of the true scripture; praising the holy names with utmost sincerity and completeness. Surely, one will gain response and communication, saving and delivering the living and the dead, dispelling calamities and bringing blessings. If one is not respectful or careful, with confused nature and doubting heart, indulging in foul smells, meat, and lust, one cannot open the scripture. Babbling and grinding lips, defiling the sacred text, is all in vain and brings calamity in return. Thus it is said: cultivating blessings is not as good as avoiding sin. If one can write and seal this scripture, distribute it to learners, circulate it for rites and recitations, the departed souls will be delivered, hell will be peaceful, blessings and goodness will be the foundation. Those who possess treasures, clothing, and adornments, who have in the past given wealth widely to the cold and poor, aiding the needy—these功 and virtue are equal to the above. Their black register is erased; the earth officials remove their names; spirits ascend and contend for land; according to wishes, they are reborn; benefiting and protecting descendants; cutting off calamities and misfortunes; vast blessings and goodness beyond measure. Therefore, one should diligently and earnestly receive, proclaim, and perform rites and recitations, universally delivering endlessly, following the teaching and upholding it, and again respectfully bowing to all Heavenly Venerables.”

With devoted heart, respectfully bow to the Void and Nature Primordial Heavenly Venerable.  
With devoted heart, respectfully bow to the Most High Great Dao Jade Morning Dao Lord.  
With devoted heart, respectfully bow to the Most High Profound Origin Holy Patriarch Laozi.  
With devoted heart, respectfully bow to the Heavenly Venerable who always kindly saves beings.  
With devoted heart, respectfully bow to the Heavenly Venerable of boundless deliverance.  
With devoted heart, respectfully bow to the Heavenly Venerable who rescues the lost and removes stagnation.  
With devoted heart, respectfully bow to the Heavenly Venerable of mysterious transformation benefiting life.  
With devoted heart, respectfully bow to the Heavenly Venerable of the Golden Palace who aids deliverance.  
With devoted heart, respectfully bow to the Heavenly Venerable of unobstructed freedom.  
With devoted heart, respectfully bow to the Heavenly Venerable who pities life and benefits beings.

With devoted heart, respectfully bow to the Heavenly Venerable who expounds the Profound Origin and reveals the teaching.  
With devoted heart, respectfully bow to the Heavenly Venerable who delivers beings through dao and virtue.  
With devoted heart, respectfully bow to the Heavenly Venerable who dispels calamities and extends life.  
With devoted heart, respectfully bow to the True Person who pardons blessings and renews life.  
With devoted heart, respectfully bow to the True Person of true stillness and perfect功.  
With devoted heart, respectfully bow to the True Person who cultivates reality and attains the dao.

After the rites, with utmost sincerity and reverence, the disciple and servant so-and-so humbly expresses thanks: “I hear that once practice is complete, filial piety is foremost; within the teaching and law, fasting is the root. To repay the kindness of compassionate parents, one must consider the rites of offering and prayer to repay boundless grace. Generally, in the human world, all are pressed by fame and profit as their goal. Once scheming for gain and loss, how can one avoid the blame of greed and ignorance? When life’s mission ends, the soul wanders the nine underworlds. Dare one rely on the cause of supreme goodness to lift them from drifting suffering? Thus the heart holds sorrow and earnestness, intending to recommend the departed. Proclaim the numinous chapter of the Golden Cabinet, looking up to the true saints, respectfully calling the exalted titles of the Void, humbly responding to the root clan. I earnestly pray to receive this dao power, broadly saving those sunk in suffering, erasing countless sins and offenses, equally opening the long night, granting the great pardon of Heaven, universally benefiting all beings. May countless ancestors all attain swift ascent; may accumulated debts and layered grievances be pardoned. Yet I hope my household, elders and young, kin and relations, always enjoy auspicious prayers, seeking the shelter of the Void and Nature. I, your servant, undertake to gaze to Heaven and await the holy, with utmost urgency and sincerity.”

The Dao said: “The profound scripture is complete and may be transmitted to teach the world, widely extending salvation and deliverance. At that time, the assembly hearing this method, understanding non-action, will together ascend to the fruit of the dao. The prisons of Feng and You, with countless sinful souls, will all receive good功 and be freed in due time. The celestial immortals rejoice and respectfully serve, perform rites, then withdraw.”
