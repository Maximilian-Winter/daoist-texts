## Scripture of the Cavern-True Great Subtle Yellow Writ of the Heavenly Emperor Lord of Stone Scenery’s Golden Yang Essence

### The Great Emperor’s Summoning of the Multitude of Souls

The *Golden Yang Essence Scripture* says:  
If one desires to live long as a spirit-immortal, one ought to know the dao of embryo breathing—this is the precious treasure for seeking life. It returns the years and restores whiteness, extending longevity without aging. Always, after midnight, when the vital breath is born, sit upright facing east, close your eyes in darkness, and hold your breath. When the breath reaches its limit, stop. If you can do this constantly, a hundred illnesses and myriad harms will not touch you; all spirits, goblins, and demons dare not come near to test you.

At dawn, when the sun first rises, face it squarely, gently draw the sun’s essence through your nose and take it in. After a while, stop. This will grant you the visage of a young child, a radiant face, forever free from wrinkles or spots.

Taking in breath makes one not hungry; taking in the sun’s essence makes one ageless. Holding breath in embryo breathing extends years without end. Always preserve the twenty-four divine tokens of the soul, and you will be free from illness. If sickness sneaks in, call upon the names of the gods and recite blessings; in a moment, you will be cured.

The *Golden Yang Scripture* says:  
Constantly think within your heart of the rising red breath, ascending through the throat. With your mind, close it at the cinnabar field; do this without ceasing. The three corpses depart by themselves; you live long and see far. The Director of Life carves your name and sets upon you the purple talisman of immortality.

If you wish to ascend as a dragon into the Dipper, always wear the talisman of the Nine Terraces, and then you will meet the Great One. If you do not wear the talisman of the Nine Terraces, the Heavenly Gate will remain closed and will not open. Wearing it, myriad gods and heavenly immortals all come to descend into your chamber; by day you fly up to the palace of Great Subtlety, where you may command the officials of immortality.

The Great Emperor of Great Subtlety said:  
The eighteen talismans of the Upper Clarity’s Stone Scenery, and the Great Emperor’s single chapter for summoning souls, are secret writings of the Upper Clarity, originally from the jade pavilion of the Upper Clarity, later sealed within the Kunlun Mountains, inside the Golden Hall and Jade Gate, opening but once in ten thousand years. Long ago, the Great Emperor of Great Subtlety received them from the Immortal Elder of the Mysterious Garden, thereby gaining the power to fly to the Upper Clarity and was bestowed the position of Heavenly Emperor. Whatever he wished, he obtained; he paid homage at the Golden Palace and rode the cloud dragons. Those who desire to learn the dao but do not obtain these talismans will surely fail; they toil in mountains and marshes only to be finally defeated by demonic trials.  

Those who wish to take them should write the talismans with orpiment ink, never with cinnabar red. Write them on paper, burn and swallow the ashes; this is also effective. They may also be made into a twelve-inch phoenix tree tube, with characters inside and out; this surely hastens ascent to Heaven. Do not recklessly reveal them; only the worthy may receive them. I now present them: to command the myriad spirits, call yin and summon yang, whatever you desire will be immediately attained. If leaked or disobeyed, calamity will strike seven generations—how can one not be cautious? How can one not be cautious?

Wearing the talisman of the Eastern Peak opens the divine script of the Upper Clarity; the cloud chariot welcomes you, and you know all affairs in reverse. The Five Peaks share the same method; begin with the Eastern Peak, then wear the others in order. As for the eighteen audience talisman seals, write them all on purple silk, first store them in a tube, and offer them to the famous mountains in the first month. After the offering, place them between great stones, letting no one know. You make mud with seven sheng of yellow earth and cover it. Then recite this blessing:

"Wearing the talisman of Great Subtlety’s Stone Scenery Yellow Script, I now carefully write this single scroll to return to the Immortal Lord, that I may ascend the void, ride the unbound clouds, with immortal spirits as attendants, truly among the multitudes." Finished.

The Five Peaks all follow this method, so the famous mountains and stone chambers become the writings of gods and immortals, revealing themselves to you; divine mushrooms and wondrous herbs appear naturally.

If you wish to make the Golden Yang talisman, prepare the seal and burn the script. Swallow the ashes of the seal and script together, and suddenly you will gain divine powers. The method of taking the seal is to write it in ink; swallow one seal, following the prescribed measure, sealing the talisman with the seal. When you wear the talisman, always eat and take it first. When the talisman enters, cold and heat become clearer to the eyes. In a moment, a white-robed jade youth or a scholar will stand before you. Do not be alarmed; in a moment, they vanish. Keep it for thirty days, and your body will naturally become light and buoyant. The superior adept may soar into the pure void, feasting and wandering in the Upper Clarity; the middle adept may raise their form a hundred zhang; the lower adept ten zhang.

When you wear the eighteen talismans, you will see the seal-wearing figures. This means you are sincere and steadfast; the jade youths and jade maidens guarding the talisman appear in true form. Before wearing talismans, abstain from the five pungent meats, blood food, and sexual relations; avoid stepping on filth. For one hundred days, dwell in a secluded chamber with no visitors; do not mingle with worldly people or noisy crowds. Thus your dao will be accomplished.

Those who wear the Stone Scenery Golden Yang talisman must especially avoid filth, arrogance, and evil deeds. Cultivate the self and remember the dao; fasting, quietude, purity, and concentration come first. If you can cultivate this dao, you may ascend as an immortal, befriend the Heavenly True Ones, and communicate with the multitudes of immortals. Then you may command and summon spirits, bring down golden elixirs and divine herbs, sit and summon the traveling kitchen, the dragon chariot and feathered canopy, spirit youths and jade maidens, and all the myriad spirits of the world; all come to serve and run errands, knowing all without question, granting all without denial.

The separate talismans of Heaven and Earth can repel armies for ten thousand li. Any bandits or conspirators who plot against you will suffer their own calamity. Anyone who raises five weapons against you will only harm themselves. These talismans may be sealed, burned and taken, or placed within a bamboo staff. The talisman tube is twelve inches long, made of phoenix wood, nine cun tall and four cun wide, placed inside the talisman tube and tied to the arm—men on the left, women on the right. Keep it secret, secret indeed. Only those recorded in the Great Ultimate Jade Registers may meet with it. Those who carry it may roam the four directions, avoid ten thousand disasters; those who wear it enjoy blessings and extended years, their descendants flourish. Daoists who have it fly to the Upper Clarity; those who possess it receive blessings, those who cultivate it ascend to the void.

If you wish to ascend into Great Subtlety, wear the supreme spiritual talisman, and you will enter the Great One, Primordial Sovereign. If you wish to pay homage to the Heavenly Emperor and ascend the Purple Palace, wear the Most High spiritual talisman.

If you wish to see the Most High Dao Lord, wear the Bright Hall talisman.

If you wish to enter the Five Peaks and have the mountain gods and all immortals come to serve and guard you, wear each peak’s talisman accordingly.

If you wish to enter the Primordial Pass, wear the Primordial Ancestor talisman and you will see the Primordial Ancestor Lord.

If you wish to obey the immortal officials and see the one hundred and twenty gods, wear the Myriad Gods talisman and you will see the various immortal lords.

If you wish to descend and see the Nine Divine Persons of the Great Clarity, wear the Heavenly Gate talisman and you will see the Great Clarity Lord.

If you wish to ascend to Heaven and enter the abyss, flying through the eight essences, roaming, hiding, and appearing wherever your mind wills, wear the Great Subtle Heavenly Emperor’s Stone Scenery special talisman; then Heaven, Earth, ghosts, and spirits will not detain you.

The Great Emperor of Great Subtlety said:  
The Heavenly Gate talisman is the fourth from above. If you cultivate and wear it, first burn incense on the left and right; forty jade youths and jade maidens guard it. Those who have the scripture worship and revere it, richly wrapped in yellow brocade. Do not let the jade youths and maidens find fault with you. Can you not be diligent? Those who receive this writing use forty feet of yellow brocade and seven taels of gold. Before bestowal, master and disciple fast together for seven days, or four days, then swear an oath. Those who carry and preserve this writing all receive the great blessing of the Golden Yang Stone Scenery.

The *Golden Yang Scripture* says:  
Whenever you keep, wear, or carry it, click your teeth thirty-six times, swallow saliva thirty-six times, look forward and softly recite this blessing:

"Great Emperor of Great Subtlety, Purple Palace Spiritual Venerable, Mysterious Void Great Truth, Preceding the Emperor, your dao is vast, your transformation natural, true principle deeply connected, flowing without interruption. Essence enters the Bright Hall, protects the embryo and nourishes the soul. The Vermilion Mountain reopens, welcoming the spiritual origin. On the left, gather the sun’s brilliance; on the right, pluck the moon’s root. Flowing fire reaches ten thousand zhang, golden net and jade skirt, belt of heavenly records, headscarf and splendid crown. Grant so-and-so to ascend the void, fly to the Upper Clarity, pray to ascend as immortal, command the myriad gods, heavenly spirits and earthly deities; none dare disobey. All directions gather, blessings and virtue mount like mountains, jade chimes sound afar, evil demons vanish like smoke."

The Great Emperor’s soul-summoning talisman, when burned and swallowed facing north at cockcrow, captures the soul and spirit. After taking the talisman, softly recite:

"Great Emperor shines bright, harmoniously gathering the soul court. Three souls and seven spirits guard the old form; spirit rests and body is whole. Thus one attains long life; all ailments disperse; the five viscera are healthy and peaceful. Let me fly as immortal, riding the cloud chariot, with red children and attendants, receiving the essence of qi, covering me with the purple canopy, guiding me with the grass spirits."  

Then click teeth three times and swallow saliva three times. After taking the talisman, always keep this blessing in your heart; it contains the secret to not losing any of the myriad gods. Keep it secret and practice it.

According to the True Concubine of Nine Blossoms:  
The Great Subtle Yellow Writ originally had eight scrolls. The Perfected One once, in the Red City Mountains, gave the *Eight Talismans Interwoven True Text* to Xu Yuanyou, the enlightened ruler who possessed it. The reason you have not yet soared to the Upper Clarity, nor ridden the cloud dragons, is precisely because you have not seen the Stone Scenery’s eight elemental chapters. Now I pass them on to you; all eighteen talismans and the scripture preface. Study and cultivate them; harness the dragon’s stride through the mystery, gradually raising your form step by step. Keep it secret and treasure it. The Great Subtle Stone Scenery Yellow Script is not a petty art of yellow and red; it has been repeatedly warned and admonished.

If your chest and heart are not stirred, your original conduct already shines forth, and your jade body is marked for high fortune; savor the mystery, chew the truth, call and draw the radiant light, condense and quiet the six spirits, search and distinguish the eight clarities, entrust and obey the spiritual root, preserve and refine the three degrees, nourish the fluids and harmonize the soul. Even if the chaotic winds rage fiercely, they cannot harm your true nature. Cut off clamor and tumult; how can you turn away from your pure and simple self? Then you chant alone in the void, with an empty heart awaiting the spirits, managing the hundred extremes, resting in clarity and utmost truth. Thus your worries and burdens will not disturb your mysterious abode, your mournful thoughts will not trouble the crimson ford.

With detachment and subtle observation, you gaze upon the radiance and share joy. Then supreme delight rings clearly in both ears, like cloud jade and tiger strings played in the empty pavilion. Your mouth drinks the fragrant wind, your eyes meet the three clouds, wearing the Golden Yang talisman, commanding the multitudes of demons, bowing and looking to the four seasons, naturally becoming true. What you see with your dim eyes is already united with spirit.

The Perfected One’s attainment of truth always comes from this; to force truth without it is to stumble and fall. Otherwise, illness fills the records, worries and grief block the chest, constant toil burdens, hiding and regretting the small dao, harmonizing and pleasing the crowd, seeking a heart at ease in old age, suddenly bursting into sorrowful sounds. Night after night, mourning death, grieving the passing heart, essence and spirit distressed, three souls fallen, qi scattered, evil moves in space, spirits report to goblins and demons, abandoning me in emptiness, encountering a hundred calamities. How can one grasp the dao of life only to rush to the house of death? Having molded the spiritual wind, now stepping into the death chamber, casting away auspicious omens, throwing oneself into filth and defilement?

Though famed for high virtue, still hesitant; often seeing clear laws yet not releasing doubt. Thus one spreads filthy petitions, letting foul morning writings hide, beating drums at the four corners, the Three Officials seeking spears, swearing how to forget the Great Beginning? Then the divine tiger claws fiercely, the venomous dragon bares fangs, the eight directions are vast and wide—where can one flee? After giving thanks, one finally realizes the pure and clear is enviable, the speaker’s words are not false, yet the mournful voice disturbs the true, harming the correct qi. Why does the enlightened ruler not always dwell in the land of blessing, shaking his robes and returning home?

Now I entrust you with the Stone Scenery Golden Yang script, so you may fully see the beginning of the eight scrolls.
