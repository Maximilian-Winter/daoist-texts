## The Cavern of Truth: Supreme Subtle Yellow Scripture of the Nine Heavens and Eight Registers of True Writ

### The Mysterious Capital Interlaced Formula

The Supreme Subtle Eight Assemblies Heavenly Emperor’s Scripture begins with the inscription of the characters of Flying Mystery and Purple Qi. Reciting its text subdues myriad evils; wearing its characters allows one to roam the Nine Heavens, command the six realms, and be guarded by myriad spirits who pay reverence. Those predestined to receive this dao may traverse the Five Sacred Mountains, enter the Three Pure Ones, and repel all ill omens.

Within the Supreme Subtle dwells the Three Sovereigns and One Emperor. The Sovereigns are the sovereign’s chief ministers: first, the Sovereign Lord; second, the Sovereign Heaven; third, the Sovereign Elder. These are the three primordial qi, the true essence of chaos, entering and exiting the palaces of Supreme Clarity, Great Origin, and Great Harmony.

The Heavenly True Three Sovereigns conceal the Eight Assemblies’ texts within feathered scrolls; the Supreme Subtle Heavenly Emperor conceals a single unified Turtle Mountain, engraved in a blue stone chamber. The Mysterious Capital Immortal King once received it from the Supreme Subtle Three Elder Sovereigns, confided it secretly to immortals, and thus named it *The Interlaced True Writ*. All disciples receive this dao from their masters, paying five taels of gold and presenting a ceremonial robe. They bind the belt as a pledge of trust, revering the dao and keeping its text secret.

The Western City Lord once received it from the Turtle Mountain Queen Mother, hence named *The Supreme Subtle Yellow Scripture*, or sometimes *The Nine Heavens Eight Registers*. If transmitted by unworthy persons, the Three Ancestors’ bodies perish, bringing calamity upon descendants.

Those who possess the Interlaced True Writ have already been born anew within the Supreme Subtle Palace; the characters form in all directions, both ascending and descending, forward and backward. Entering mountains, roaming the Five Sacred Peaks, or sleeping at night, one constantly recites it aloud; fierce beasts, thousands of demons, and myriad evils dare not approach. Wearing it on the left elbow, one may traverse the six realms, govern the world, and repel ten thousand armies. The characters align in rows in all four directions above and below, written with yellow brush on blue silk ground. Wearing it on the left elbow, one may behold the Peaceful Golden Palace Sovereign Lord.

If one wishes to command ghosts and spirits, one must submit to the five characters, starting from top to bottom. After five years, one may command ghosts and spirits at will.

### The Eight Volumes of the Supreme Subtle Yellow Scripture

1. The Supreme Subtle Heavenly Emperor’s Transmission to the Most High  
2. The Supreme Subtle Eight Enclosures and Four Gates High Scripture  
3. The Supreme Subtle Nine Spirits Central China Purple Origin Scripture  
4. The Supreme Subtle Jade Void Precious Manifest Scripture  
5. The Supreme Subtle Jade Chamber Precious Cloud Central Radiance

8. The Supreme Subtle Stone Scene Golden Sun Origin Scripture  
9. The Supreme Subtle Nine Heavens Eight Registers True Writ Interlaced Script

The above eight volumes of the Supreme Subtle Yellow Scripture: the first four do not circulate in the world; the fifth, sixth, and seventh are transmitted only to perfected beings; the eighth is this very text. It should be transmitted only to those predestined and trustworthy. Those who do not cherish profound study or the dao of immortality must not transmit it recklessly, lest the Three Ancestors suffer punishment by the Water Official.

If signs and responses arise, transmission is appropriate. Entrust it with key words, and those who have it become divine immortals.

### The Ritual of Receiving

One must fast for three days before receiving. The recipient must pay homage to the Supreme Subtle Emperor nine times a year. The ritual begins at the new moon dawn, facing north in a quiet chamber. Wearing a bound belt and fasting robes, one bows four times. After bowing, one knocks teeth thrice and kneels to pray:

> Supreme Subtle Highest Truth, Heavenly Emperor and Great Supreme Sovereign, your humble servant so-and-so petitions with words:  
> The Supreme Emperor and Four Sovereigns, the Controller of Destiny Supreme Subtle, the Purple Mysterious Elixir Spirit, shining with sun and moon alike, the Golden Essence Treasure Fear, the Sovereign Heaven’s Eight Powers,  
> I wish to attain longevity, to return with Heaven and Earth in harmony, to command ghosts and spirits as servants, to open with metal and stone, to govern the six realms, to control ten thousand armies,  
> [words lost to thunderclap], to enjoy endless years, blessings towering high, to benefit from purity and enter truth, to have a light and flying countenance, clear eyes and keen ears,  
> the four limbs unwearied, jade maidens attending, riding the radiance of Supreme Subtle.

After finishing, rise, bow again twice, and kneel.

### The Nine Characters Practice

Recite the nine characters and wear the talisman; naturally, the characters of the four directions and eight lines will be understood, later extending to the thirty-six realms’ sounds.

The Yellow Emperor obtained this text, dominating the world, commanding ten thousand armies, and employing ghosts and spirits, becoming naturally divine, wise, and sage. He Yu obtained these three lines and thus commanded ghosts and spirits; Du You and Fei Ci obtained thirteen lines and commanded all the world’s spirits; Xu Guang obtained five lines, wore them for three years, commanding fourteen ghosts to seize the world’s treasures.

A perfected being in the Red City Mountains taught Xuanyuan to roam afar; Xuanyuan transmitted it to his disciple Sixuan and his second son Daoxiang.
