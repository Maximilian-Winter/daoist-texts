## The Cavern of Truth: The Most High Primordial Jade Register

The Primordial Jade Register was cultivated by the Jade Morning Lord, a divine envoy of the Five Emperors, secretly preserved within the chamber of Great Abundance in the Primordial Spiritual Upper Palace. Those who obtain it may soar through the vastness of the heavens, able to vanish and conceal at will. Each disciple is granted two jade boys and two jade girls; with secret cultivation, the efficacy is immediate. But if revealed, calamity ensues—therefore, utmost caution and careful remembrance of the master's words are essential.

The Primordial Lord is the Original Old Master, the soul of Heaven, governing within the midst of the Supreme Clarity, in the Inner Section of the Central Array. He constantly attends the Emperor Lord, presiding over the vital breath of True Origin, bearing the title Primordial Lord. He stands opposite the Supreme Harmony Lord, who is the August Original Old Master, the corporeal spirit of Heaven, overseeing the vital breath of the Fetal Origin. The Primordial Lord always guards the left and right; the Supreme Harmony Lord always accompanies the Emperor Lord in and out. When the Heavenly Emperor enters the Purple Tenuity, he resides at Kunlun’s Yellow Gate in the Purple Chamber with the Supreme One Lord. These three lords and their three breaths are originally one primordial chaos, the root of all transformation. Together with Heaven and Earth, they form the four; with the primordial body, they become five. Those who can preserve the five harmonize truly with the Dao.

Regularly, on the second and third days of the lunar month, at midnight during the hour of the Rat, one lies down peacefully and closes the eyes. One preserves the primordial body’s head in the Supreme Clarity Supreme Ultimate Palace before the Emperor Lord. Then one contemplates the left eye—the Primordial Lord, clad in blue robes, crowned with a nine-flower crown, holding a blue ganoderma in the left hand and a blue banner in the right. Next, one contemplates the right eye—the Supreme Harmony Lord, clad in white robes, crowned with a five-flower crown, holding golden nectar and jade wine in the left hand and a white banner in the right, standing at the Emperor Lord’s sides. The Supreme Ultimate has nine names: first, Supreme Clarity; second, Supreme Ultimate; third, Supreme Subtlety; fourth, Purple Chamber; fifth, Mysterious Chamber; sixth, Emperor’s Hall; seventh, Heavenly Treasury; eighth, Imperial Office; ninth, Celestial Capital of the Mysterious Metropolis. In brief, from the crown of the head straight down one inch is the Supreme Ultimate Palace, one inch square, located above the Six Harmonies Palace. The Six Harmonies Palace is where the Divine Emperor of the Supreme One constantly dwells.

One always preserves the Three Truths completed, then preserves one’s own soul, a person in one’s own image, ascending into the Supreme Ultimate Palace. The Two Elders then bestow the blue ganoderma and golden nectar, giving them to me. I eat the ganoderma, which resembles a lotus flower, and drink the nectar, which tastes like fine wine. After eating and drinking, I perform a double kowtow before the Emperor Lord and say: “Today I humbly petition; the Emperor Lord is in the courtyard, bestowing the divine ganoderma and golden nectar. The Two Elders have registered my name; the Supreme One receives this petition, granting longevity and enduring vision, life unending.” The Emperor replies: “Fortunate indeed! Return again on the second and third days of the month.” Then I lie down again, destined for long life and immortality; in time, a divine immortal.

The Supreme One is the essence of the fetal embryo, the master of transformation. The soul and spirit are born from the fetal spirit, summoned by Yang to establish the utmost. If one leaks or fails to follow the prescribed regulations, disaster will befall seven generations—how can one not be cautious? How can one not be cautious?

By wearing the talisman of the Eastern Peak, the divine script unfolds from Supreme Clarity; the Cloud Chariot welcomes the disciple, foreknowing myriad affairs. The Five Peaks share the same method; begin with the Eastern Peak, then proceed in order. The eighteen visitation talismans and seals are all inscribed on purple silk, placed in a tube, and presented to the sacred mountains in the first month. After the offering, they are placed among great stones, hidden from all eyes. The disciple uses seven sheng of yellow earth to make mud, smooths it, and then recites:

“Wearing the adornment of Supreme Subtlety, Stone Scene, and Yellow Script, I now carefully inscribe this scroll to return to the Immortal Lord, enabling me to ascend the void, command the primal chariot of clouds, with immortal spirits attending as guards, united with the True Ones as a company.” Thus ends.

The Five Peaks all follow this method; their sacred mountain stone chambers hold the immortal script. When the disciple reveals it, divine ganoderma and wondrous herbs naturally appear.

If the disciple wishes to forge the Golden Yang seal and burn the script, the disciple must burn and swallow the seal together. Suddenly, divine powers spontaneously arise. The method of wearing the seal is to write it in ink, swallow one seal as a measure, and seal the talisman with it. When the disciple wears the talisman, first ingest it. Once the talisman enters, one’s perception sharpens in cold and heat. Within moments, a white-robed jade boy or a scholar appears before the disciple—do not be alarmed—they vanish shortly thereafter. Preserve this for thirty days; the body naturally becomes light and buoyant. The superior adept can soar into the Pure Void, feasting and wandering in Supreme Clarity; the middle adept can raise their form a hundred zhang; the lower adept ten zhang.

When the disciple wears the eighteen talismans, all see white-robed figures. This shows the disciple’s sincerity; the jade boys and girls guarding the talisman reveal their true forms. Before wearing talismans, one must abstain from the five incense offerings, blood foods, and sexual relations, avoid walking on filth for one hundred days, and dwell in a secluded, uninhabited chamber, avoiding noisy company. Only then will the dao be realized.

Those who wear the Stone Scene Golden Yang talisman must especially avoid impurity, arrogance, and evil conduct. One must cultivate the body, focus on the dao, fast, remain tranquil, and concentrate as a priority. Those who can cultivate this dao may ascend as immortals and commune with the Celestial True Ones, gaining intercourse with the assembly of immortals. Then they may summon divine spirits, causing golden elixirs and ganoderma herbs to descend; they may sit to summon the traveling kitchen, dragon chariots, feathered canopies, spirit boys and girls, and myriad spirits of the world—all come to serve and dispatch, knowing all without question, granting all requests.

The separate talismans of Heaven and Earth can repel armies for ten thousand li. If thieves or conspirators plot, they will suffer their own calamity. Those who raise five weapons against the talisman will be harmed themselves. Also, the refined jade horse talisman’s spiritual script on the body enables swift flight through empty realms, free movement without obstruction, coming and going at will. Evil forces dare not offend; the assembly of gods reveres and protects. The established rules have forms; the secret is in the mouth. The master carefully assesses the person and grants instruction accordingly.

## The Mysterious Metropolis Intertwined Register: The Cavern of Truth’s Hidden Stone Essence Jade Covenant

Received from the Supreme Ultimate True Person, the Later Sage Lord, the Most High Hidden Register of Walking the Heavenly Rope and Treading the Flight Record was entrusted to the Blue Youth Lord. The Lord transmitted it to Lord Wang, who was to pass it to those with resolute integrity destined to become immortals. Lord Wang, in the eleventh year of the Yonghe era of the Jin dynasty, on the ninth day of the seventh month of the Yimao year, at Linhai’s Red King, granted permission for distant wandering.

Through fasting, abstinence, and offerings of golden dragons and jade fish, ascending the altar to swear oaths, dividing and breaking contracts, one cultivates for seven years, riding the void into non-being, divine transformation without bounds, acting according to will—this is the path.

To the right is the Most High Hidden Register of Flight Walking the Nine Star Covenant, written in vermilion on silk.

It records the year, the year’s lord, the first day of the month, the hour of the Rat, the names of male and female Daoists of the prefecture, county, district, and village, and their ages.

The title and method proceed as above.

The title and method proceed as above.

Pearls gather brilliance, veiled green resembles the sun, returning clouds shine brightly, the red child holds the spirit, mysterious flames scatter light, the whirlwind image is lush and clear. This is the day’s momentum, the spirit’s accomplishment.

The true text has sixteen characters: The Golden Gate Holy Lord gathers and wears the flying root of the upper path. The Supreme Origin True Person received it from the Supreme Subtle Heavenly Emperor. Also called the Golden Essence Stone Scene Water Mother Scripture, it is the midday Five Emperors’ secret characters, eight primordial intertwined true texts, totaling two hundred characters. These are the Nine Heavens’ kings’ images and the true divine names of the Five Directions. Those who wear this text receive the midday Five Emperors’ characters, sealing their characters, wearing it on the left elbow. It naturally grants intelligence and sacred wisdom, understanding affairs of the Five Directions, roaming the Five Peaks, sealing mountains and summoning seas, commanding ten thousand soldiers, controlling ghosts and spirits, heavenly and earthly deities, spirit boys and jade girls attending. Ten thousand trials cannot harm it. The path to immortality is complete. It must not be transmitted to the world. When a resolute Daoist meets a true master and receives it, they ascend the altar and swear an oath with golden dragons and jade fish never to reveal it. Then the master takes the golden dragon and jade fish and gives them to the recipient, inscribed in yellow on a blue ground.
