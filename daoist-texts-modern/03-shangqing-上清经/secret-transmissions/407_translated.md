## The True Text Method of Binding the Belt by the Supreme Clarity Great Emperor of the Grand Subtlety

Also called the “Interlacing Belt Text,” it originates from the *Scripture of the Supreme Ultimate Interlacing Belt*.

This comes from the Fourth Division of the Cavern Immortals, Volume Thirty-One, with Master Lu’s authentic edition fully preserved, its colors and numbers as follows.

This method requires a thirty-day fast, accompanied by nine pairs of talismans shaped like falcons, reeds, mulberries, and buttons. According to this method, the Great Emperor of the Grand Subtlety purifies and fasts in the Jade Heaven, receiving the rite from the Most High Jade Emperor. He divides the spiritual covenant among the Nine Gates, binds the central belt at the Heavenly Gate, and casts the oath of faith into the Vast Void. He proclaims the mandate to the Nine Mysterious Ones, gathers the Five Spirits under the jade character, and summons ten thousand riders upon the Dao of Uninterrupted Passage—also called the text of interlacing descent.

### The Upper Section: Nine Talismans

These are the Most High Jade Emperor’s unmanifest signs within the Nine Voids; they bind the essence of nature itself, emerging from the womb of the Mysterious Mother. They refine the jade embryo until it transforms into the talismans of the Nine Emperors. Written with a yellow brush, worn facing north, they grant transformation and shape-shifting, enabling one to behold the Great Emperor of the Grand Subtlety, who rides upon flying rosy clouds and feathered canopies, roaming freely through the Mysterious Capital.

### The Middle Section: Nine Talismans

These are formed from the pure qi condensed in the Nine Heavens, binding the natural pattern. They pass through the Mysterious Mother of the Nine Mysteries, giving birth to the spiritual script. Written with a blue brush, worn facing north, they allow one to see the Great Emperor of the Grand Subtlety, who soars through the void, ascending the Nine Heavens.

### The Lower Section: Five Talismans

These represent the primal unity before the Five Emperors divided, binding the essence of the void within emptiness. They refine the Mysterious Mother of the Nine Mysteries to generate the script. Written with a vermilion brush, worn facing west, they emit five-colored radiant light, enabling one to ride the void and ascend to Supreme Clarity.

Men use white patterns; women use purple patterns. They must be nine cun wide and nine chi long, inscribed in order. The subsequent text states: “The Seven Ancestors bear full responsibility, through myriad kalpas unaltered, all as with the Most High Purple Plain Covenant Text.” This means, in accordance with the Most High’s will, one has become a perfected person, harmonizing with the Purple Plain Text. Hence, the preface states this is to be transmitted to those sages who attain the Dao in later ages.
