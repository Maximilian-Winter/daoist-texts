## The Inner Scripture of the Cavern of Truth, Most High Supreme Clarity

The Supreme Clarity High Perfected Primordial Heavenly King, at that time together with the Five Elders Supreme Emperors, the True Kings of the Nine Heavens, the Great Holy Assemblies of the Ten Directions, and the Lords of Infinite Ultimate Truth, all gathered in the Red Bright World’s Ling She abode, seated within the Fragrant Garden beneath the Great Mulberry Tree. The Heavenly King returned his chariot; the myriad heavens lowered their seats.

At that moment, clouds and mists surged thickly, the four scenes merged in darkness; for nine days and nine nights, profound yin did not dissipate, Heaven and Earth were without light, as if before the Dragon River, gloomy and shadowed. The Five Elders Supreme Perfected advanced and bowed, addressing the Heavenly Venerable: “Today’s assembly, never before experienced, the Heavenly Venerable journeys forth, the myriad heavens incline their seats, the High Emperors and Perfected Ones, divine immortals and jade maidens, sun, moon, and stars, the Celestial Pivot and Jade Balance, the officials of the Three Realms, the mountain gods of the Five Sacred Peaks, the river and sea water emperors, all spirits and deities, none but stand alert and solemn, guarding the heavenly truth.”

At that time, the sky was clear and bright, the wind did not stir the branches, the earth bore no flying dust, rivers and seas lay silent, mountains concealed their mists. The season was harmonious, the vital breath settled, causing birth and death to rejoice together, yet the heavenly light was closed, daylight became shadow, heaven and humans trembled in fear, all seats uneasy. The cause was unknown. “Please graciously instruct, so the assembly may understand clearly, enrich all beings, and universally attain safety.”

The Heavenly King, Supreme Perfected Primordial Heavenly Venerable, spoke: “Today’s gathering, joy is rare; Heaven sends auspicious responses, naturally the jade characters and golden writings blaze brilliantly, blocking the heavenly light, the beginning of the unopened, causing the day to darken as night. The sun and celebration coincide—rarely ever seen. Now I shall open the wondrous truths of Heaven to the four assemblies, the true names and true titles of the Nine Heavens, so that those who respond to the Perfected may obtain the body of the Dao. Let all with one heart recite the truth, close their eyes and bow to the ground.”

Then the Great Holy High Immortals, the myriad true beings of the Ten Directions, countless beyond number, all simultaneously prostrated themselves to hear the command. In an instant, the heavenly breath cleared away, the darkness vanished, five-colored radiance penetrated the Ten Directions. Suddenly, a heavenly scripture naturally appeared in the void, characters one zhang square, manifesting spontaneously above the empty space, within the mysterious void’s five-colored light, shining brilliantly, eight-cornered rays hanging down, the essence light dazzling the eyes, impossible to gaze upon.

The Primordial Heavenly Venerable broadly announced to the assembly of the Ten Directions and Infinite Ultimate beings: “This is the numinous scripture of the true names of the Nine Heavens, the harmonized qi, born of emptiness and nature, the profound sayings of the Nine Heavens, difficult to seek or explain. I once entrusted this to the perfected in secret, hidden within the golden flower palace of the cavern chamber. Now I reveal it to you, so that those who can unite with the Perfected and the Dao may do so, whether morning or evening. Be clear and cautious, keep your mouth closed, cultivate and practice accordingly.”

The Primordial then instructed the Most High Dao Lord: “The wondrous dao must be clarified; you may now take up the brush and explain its correct pronunciation, so that the august dao may flow freely, benefiting the Ten Directions, traversing the Eight Extremes and the Six Harmonies within and beyond. When the auspicious spirit moves, the predestined karmic ties bear fruit, those who unite with the truth should be informed by the Most High Immortals, addressing the Heavenly Venerable.”

The Primordial Heavenly King said: “I have always followed the currents, riding the wind and raising banners, accompanying the turning wheel of fate. For countless kalpas, I have often attended assemblies, teaching all beings. At first, it was not like today; now, encountering the sacred dao, opening all dharma gates, seeing the heavenly scripture, naturally reaching the ultimate truth, the bone and form corresponding to the chart, harmonizing the Five Harmonies’ sounds—this is beyond foolish sentiment or shallow thought to comprehend. Now seated here, I respectfully gaze upon the mystery, daring not conceal my feelings. I shall follow the model, traverse the Eight Extremes and Six Harmonies inside and out, according to the scriptures seen and transmitted, hoping that even one in ten thousand may unite. Humbly I bow and obey the command, composing this hymn:”

> Primordial opens the great abundance,  
> The myriad heavens shine brilliantly.  
> Wondrous is the Dragon River’s dao,  
> The eight assemblies form the scripture.  
> Blazing within the flying void,  
> Flowing light in the courts of the Three Realms.  
> Spirits and truths awaken the numinous assembly,  
> Jade characters respond to the auspicious time.  
> Heavenly truth penetrates wondrous meaning,  
> Five harmonies compose the chapters.  
> Clear jade tones resound,  
> Floating together into Supreme Clarity.  
> Opening the path without beginning or end,  
> The nine abysses receive the light.  
> Lofty is the great gate of dharma,  
> Teaching all living beings.  
> This merit cannot be surpassed,  
> Joyfully celebrating ten thousand years.

The above Supreme Clarity Purple Plain Origin Lord True Perfected composed this true text as a palindrome. The Supreme High Origin Lord uses this true text to pass through the Thirty-two Heavens’ Purple Tenuity Upper Palace, where there are mysterious named imperial tablets, to select those who should supplement the upper immortals. Not transmitted to middle immortals, earth immortals may not hear or participate. Without planting blessings for countless kalpas, blessings flowing to this body, one will never see it. If one obtains it, they may become upper immortals, with body and flesh both flying.

This true formula is essential, transmitted only to the Supreme Clarity Purple Terrace Mysterious Gate with imperial tablets of gold and jade. Those who receive the text but do not study it must become immortals by themselves. Also called the Great True Yin-Yang Spirit Talisman, or the Nine Stream True Scripture. This true formula repels all and removes all. To learn the path of upper immortals, one must receive and wear it, not recklessly revealing it, lest one face the trial of the wind blade, in accordance with the regulations of the Four Extremes and the clear rites.
