## Transmission of the Purple Register of the Supreme Cavern of Truth

The Supreme True Elder’s treasured possession, the original transmission text of the Primordial Master. Also known as the Five Concealments, Six Marvels, Three Nines, Supreme Unity Secret Instructions Scripture.

The Supreme Pure High True Great Sage Mysterious Spirit, the Unoriginated Heavenly Venerable, together with the Five Elders, the Sovereigns, and countless saints who have attained the dao from the Ten Directions, gathered in the Northeast, within the Primordial Azure Heaven, atop the Mountain of Jade Capital in the Great Floating Li Kingdom. There stood the Seven Treasures, the Jade Forest, the Palace of Pure Countenance. Celestial music wove through the air, incense and blossoms scattered in profusion, divine creatures and wondrous beasts of immense strangeness assembled in grand spectacle beyond words. The Heavenly Venerable smiled warmly, and all were filled with joy.

Then the Supreme Dao Lord mounted the Wheel of Nature, attended by the Boundless True Sages, immortal youths and jade maidens beyond count. They emerged from the Mysterious Capital to approach the Heavenly Venerable. After paying respects, they spoke. The Venerable’s smile deepened, and the assembly rejoiced, though none yet understood the cause of this gladness—yet a mysterious favor was at hand.

The Heavenly Venerable bade them take their seats and discoursed on the pure and subtle. Words and laughter mingled with delight; all voices sang praises rare and wondrous, yet none dared to petition.

At that moment, the Primordial Heavenly King rose from his seat, knelt long, and addressed the Heavenly Venerable:  
“Supreme Dao Lord, through countless kalpas you have accumulated merit and virtue, attaining majestic and divine marvels. To gather thus today is a joy beyond measure, thoughts unfathomable over myriad affairs, compassion embracing all beings. Often you wish to speak but find no audience; desire to teach yet none able to receive. On this great day of celebration, may we hear the essential words: by what dao may all be broadly aided? By what method may joy endure forever?”

The Heavenly Venerable replied:  
“Excellent, excellent! What a grand question! I possess a marvelous dao, unfathomable to the utmost; profound and mysterious essence beyond words. Though its depths and secrets are vast, I shall roughly present them now: the Five Concealments, Six Marvels, Three Nines, Supreme Unity Secret Instructions. I entrust these to the Supreme Dao Lord, that together you may illuminate them, deliver all beings, and reveal the path of eternal abiding and lasting joy.”

Then the Primordial Heavenly King, the Supreme Dao Lord, and innumerable holy sages, all the assembly, joyfully accepted the command, bowed, and withdrew. The Supreme Dao Lord and Primordial Heavenly King returned together to the Palace of Great Abundance, feasting and wandering through wondrous courts. Purple clouds condensed, Seven Treasures surged forth, vermilion clouds spread. They arranged the terraces; myriad flowers dazzled, shining like the jade void, illuminating all heavens. Incense filled the Ten Directions, brilliant and fragrant beyond description.

Then they gathered the Boundless Numinous Spirits, the Most True Great Deities, the assembly of immortals and saints. They struck cloud chimes, played the heavenly scales, lion dancers frolicked, pure white cranes danced gracefully, vermilion phoenixes soared. The eight-tone music rang clear, nine colors blazed bright. Flutes, pipes, bells, and drums performed myriad wonders, countless voices and appearances sang the pure marvels. Heaven’s gods, humans, ghosts, and even creeping creatures all responded in harmony, none failing to rejoice.

At that time, the Great Deity who had attained the dao, called the White Jade Queen Mother, rode the Nine Canopies Splendid Chariot, surrounded by true attendants and guards. Cloud dragons flanked her wings; immortal youths led the way, jade maidens followed behind. Umbrellas and flowers crossed left, banners and incense embraced right. Dancers played music and respectfully approached the Dao Lord, kowtowing and reporting. Then she asked:

“I have heard that the Primordial Heavenly Venerable told the Primordial Heavenly King that the Six Marvelous Secret Instructions would be entrusted to the Dao Lord. May this secret be heard?”  
The Dao Lord answered: “The Heavenly Venerable’s secret instructions have been practiced in utmost secrecy for countless kalpas. The truly worthy are rare, thus it has not been proclaimed. Now that you ask to witness them, you must seek the Unoriginated Heavenly King.”

So the Queen Mother descended from her seat, prostrated herself, and respectfully asked the King:  
“The Heavenly Venerable’s secret instructions, the Supreme Lord’s teachings, I submit myself to hear them. Please grant your gracious revelation.”  
The King said:  
“These instructions are subtle and wondrous, beyond thought. The refined and devoted will naturally perceive and comprehend them. The Most True receive them orally; the essential formula flows and spreads. Those who are but walking corpses, lost in dust and kalpas, will not encounter them. Those who do will attain long life, spiritual penetration, unity with the dao, infinite transformations, and boundless joy. Those who do not will wander the infant wheel, suffering in vain—truly sorrowful.

“You, Mother, are compassionate to all and intent on broad salvation. Your merit accords with the Heavenly Venerable’s grace. How could you not consider practicing these secret instructions? Please return to your seat and briefly explain them. Your divine wisdom will surely clarify.”

“I once heard the Heavenly Venerable say to the Dao Lord: ‘Neither Heaven nor Earth, neither Yin nor Yang, neither Sun nor Moon, neither soft nor hard, neither nonexistence nor existence—these profound secrets must not be revealed. Mother, will you explain them?’”

The Queen Mother pondered deeply, then answered:  
“Neither Heaven nor Earth means the supreme primordial mixture; neither Yin nor Yang means the mysterious passage of the central palace; neither Sun nor Moon means the two halves forming one; neither soft nor hard means the union of mountains and rivers; neither existence nor nonexistence means the ultimate transformations of the Five and Nine; profound secrets must be kept silent, practiced with care, not recklessly transmitted.”

The King said:  
“Indeed so, Mother, you have understood. The Heavenly Venerable’s great compassion and grace embrace all; how could such secrets be withheld? Yet many are false and shallow, unable to grasp the ultimate principle. Their roots of sin and doubt are deep; if they hear the subtle marvels, they may slander, scorn, and disbelieve, falling into evil paths, enduring the wind blades and bitter poisons, unable to escape kalpas of suffering.

“The Heavenly Venerable’s great mercy and boundless compassion thus conceal these marvelous instructions, awaiting the truly worthy. The truly worthy are rare, their path seldom heard. Yet all ranks cannot be without teaching. Therefore, I broadly explain the causes, the rules, the dignified ceremonies, the prohibitions and precepts, various analogies, created according to the times, the lineage branching and dividing, too many to record fully. May you roughly enter the marvels and eventually encounter these instructions.

“These instructions are subtle and wondrous, the root of all principles. Thus the Five Elder Sovereigns, the Thirty-Two Heavens, and countless saints all honor them. When unspoken, this dao lies hidden; when spoken, these instructions come first, highest, and unmatched. Therefore the Heavenly Venerable esteems them; sages treasure this secret alone. Other scriptures, though weighty, follow after these instructions.

“Through kalpas of diligent study, refined and unyielding, merit and virtue turn like a wheel, and one will surely encounter them. Those not destined to attain the dao will never meet them; those who have not attained will not know whom to transmit them to.

“Now the Queen Mother embodies the dao and unites with spirit, illuminating and penetrating, discerning existence and nonexistence, exhausting principle and nature, reflecting all beings, recognizing great and small alike. She rescues all, distinguishes true and false, rewards good and admonishes evil, liberates without restraint. To understand these instructions is great merit, majestic and grand beyond words.

“But these instructions are the Heavenly Venerable’s supreme teaching, encompassing all marvels’ origins. All nurturing teachings center on these alone. They may be clearly transmitted to worthy and superior practitioners; do not show them to the middling or low.”

The Queen Mother replied:  
“Grateful for the Heavenly Venerable’s secret instructions, I will carry out the six degrees of the highest affairs, practice the four ranks, through countless kalpas without end. I speak fully to thank this grace and will diligently cultivate in silence, only following the command.”

The King said:  
“Respectful indeed, proceed without hindrance.”

At that time, the Queen Mother said to the Dao Lord:  
“Through countless kalpas of affinity, one obtains these instructions, thus to transform and save all, blessing and fortune immeasurable. Only I fear the truly worthy are rare, lamentable indeed.

“From now on, if great-aspiring superior practitioners deeply delight in this dao, renounce wealth and body, entrust their lives to seek and receive these secret instructions, regardless of amount or kalpa, encountering auspicious times and clear mornings, they may fast and transmit them. Is this permissible?”

The Dao Lord answered:  
“Not lightly at all, not lightly at all. Select carefully those who accord with Mother’s heart; then they may be entrusted. The principle must not be forgotten; words must not cease. One must be solemn and cautious, sworn to secrecy, diligently cultivating in silence, understanding numbers and sensing the workings, until reaching true dao.”

The Queen Mother kowtowed and returned to the Jade Palace of Turtle Mountain, dwelling in the Palace of Azure Forest, in the vermilion and purple chamber, surrounded by pearl and jewel curtains, immortal youths and jade maidens, myriad wondrous musicians, various attendants, profound and pure.

At that time, the Supreme Harmony True Youth and Supreme Mystery Jade Maiden awaited to serve the feast and music, watching the Queen Mother’s serene peace. They carefully bound body and mind, purified through fasting for many days, mutually pledging vows, inside and out complete, pouring out wealth and possessions. They gathered the Seven Treasures Splendid Hall’s three sections, jade beds, golden screens, pearl curtains, treasure canopies—five sets; nine-fold divine incense; ten supreme floral banners; one boy and one girl each; one golden jade dragon carriage each; hundreds of flavors and sweets supplied for a thousand days; brocade and silk nets with a thousand strands; purple and yellow gold each weighing ten thousand catties—held aloft on jade tables. Together they played before the Queen Mother, bowed and kowtowed, and addressed her:

“Fortunate to meet in this kalpa, to serve at your side, truly joyous and comforted, infinitely grateful. Though our practice is shallow and the great dao not yet attained, we delight and only advance. For the dao we have not reached, we beseech your pity and forgiveness. Now we exhaust our hearts and wills, pouring out sincerity and all possessions, leaving nothing beyond ourselves. Our forms cast to the ground, entrusting substance to the Most High, returning body and spirit, submitting our lives utterly. We humbly request to hear the supreme marvel of the primordial mixture of Five and Nine. We earnestly pray for your great compassion to grant instruction.”

The Queen Mother pondered long, looking up and down, sighing repeatedly, but did not immediately answer. Then the True Youth and Jade Maiden, with utmost sincerity, prostrated themselves, striking the ground with their five limbs, knocking and pleading without cease. Their marrow and brains flowed with tears and blood, their vital breath collapsed to the earth.

After a long while, the Queen Mother composed her countenance and spoke properly. She commanded left immortals and right sages to support them and raise them up. The two sages revived. The Mother bestowed jade elixir; each took a dose, their divine bodies restored as before.

Then the Mother said:  
“You who can practice the Three Wonders must surely cultivate the Six Marvels. Through countless kalpas of virtue, you have attained this true immortal reward. Now, with utmost diligence to this degree, you will achieve the supreme dao.

“I solemnly transmit the Primordial Venerable’s secret instructions, entrusting them to you. Guard these secret methods carefully. What you have long known may be briefly forgotten; I will not burden you further.”

The two sages rejoiced beyond measure, kowtowing and offering thanks, vowing to faithfully carry them out.

The Mother said:  
“To transmit these secret instructions, one must hold a pure fasting assembly, summon honored spirits, close and guard all saints, offer to the Most True, and extend blessings without limit.

“Since you have renounced all possessions and cast yourself into the Mysterious Void, I now petition for you the Unoriginated Heavenly Venerable, the Supreme Dao Lord, the Primordial Heavenly King, the Five Elder Sovereigns, the Thirty-Two Heavenly Emperors, the Imperial Heaven Fusang Great Emperor, the Nine True Kings, the Immortal Lords of the Ten Directions, the Five Luo Host of Saints, the Three Realms’ Spiritual Officials, the Boundless Numinous Spirits, and all proper deities to praise your virtue.”

The two sages respectfully declined, saying:  
“We do not dare hope, only humbly listen to your compassionate will.”

Then the Queen Mother ordered the left guard immortal youths to prepare cloud reins, the right jade maidens to solemnly ready the wind chariot, and summoned the flying phoenix messengers and dragon riders to announce and open the way. Everywhere was prepared.

On the first day of the first month of the fifth year of the Supreme Emperor’s reign, a grand assembly was held in the Vermilion Palace of the Jade Palace. The Purple Supreme Spirit Youth and Great Elixir Jade Maiden, along with the Central Palace Yellow Youth, led the True Mountain Immortal Officials to open the treasure gates, sweep the doors and windows, countless chambers and palaces, innumerable halls and rooms, foundations, altars, steps, beams, pillars, flying eaves connected, corridors linked—all naturally covered with the light of Seven Treasures, brilliant without a speck of darkness, inside and out perfectly pure, illuminating the Boundless.

Their beds, curtains, and screens were all adorned with pearls and jade, coral and amber, agate and carnelian, glass and crystal, various decorations, banners, incense, and musical instruments.

On this fasting day, at clear dawn, the saints from all directions gathered simultaneously.

At that moment, the Heavenly Venerable appeared in golden form, a round halo around his neck, wearing embroidered robes and a crown, riding the flying jade wheel, covered by a treasure canopy soaring through clouds, led by true attendants, surrounded by incense and flowers, guarded by musicians and attendants, a scene beyond words.

The Supreme Dao Lord led the Heavenly King Emperors and the Queen Mother’s assembly in unanimous praise, circling three times, bowing and worshiping. Then, each returned to their seats in order. Everyone asked questions; the Heavenly Venerable answered, and all understood.

At midday, the Queen Mother prepared a feast of delicacies and fruits, the rarest and most exquisite. Sounds and fragrances were sweet and pleasant, countless varieties beyond description. Seven Treasure vessels and tables were naturally filled. The assembly all partook together, but each person’s meal changed color and form according to their virtue, each differing in order, beyond comprehension.

After the meal was finished and the place purified, they circled the Unoriginated Heavenly Venerable again, discoursing on the subtle and coarse, debating existence and nonexistence. All rejoiced, fully understanding. They sang marvelous melodies and danced to heavenly music, all joyfully clapping and continuing the good chant.

Only the two sages knelt and humbly spoke:  
The Queen Mother knelt long and addressed the Heavenly Venerable:  
“These two have accumulated merit through kalpas, their virtue concentrated. They have long been devoted, diligent without retreat. They cannot contain what they have seen and wish to be perfected. We venture to petition the Heavenly Venerable: the Six Marvelous Secret Instructions are the supreme dao; these two sons will be perfected. Please entrust them. We do not dare act alone but humbly await your command.”

The Heavenly Venerable said:  
“These two are diligent and truly capable of perfection. Those destined will be perfected; those to be delivered will be delivered. I entrust them to the Dao Lord’s care. You may inform the Dao Lord and proclaim to the assembly. There is no need for me to intervene further.”

The Queen Mother kowtowed and obeyed the command. She then addressed the Dao Lord, proclaiming to the assembly:  
“Now the secret instructions are entrusted to the two sages. Their dao is perfected. May all the saints and sages clearly recognize this and acknowledge the two sages’ merit. They have attained the dao today.”

The Supreme Dao Lord answered:  
“Excellent, excellent!” The entire assembly sang, “Well said!”

Then the Queen Mother revealed the supreme primordial mixture jade pendant formula and the Central Palace mysterious passage Three Scenes formula; these two formulas govern the Three Plus Nine chapters of the Cavern of Truth. The Two Halves Forming One subtle formula, the Mountains and Rivers Uniting Human and Bird formula; these two govern the ten volumes of the Cavern Profound Scripture. The Five and Nine Ultimate Primordial formula. This is the great mysterious character of the Cavern Spirit, the master of five thousand writings.

The Queen Mother again instructed the two sages:  
“The Dao Lord calls these the Supreme Pure High True Primordial Heavenly Venerable’s secret instructions, saying: True One gives birth to Mysterious Two, Mysterious Two gives birth to Spirit Three, Spirit Three contains the Great Five, the Great Five contain the Three Dao, which together form the Six Marvels. The true principles number five, five relate to three, three to nine, nine revolve and transform, transforming back to one. The Supreme Unity Dao must be thoroughly realized. Those who grasp these instructions will surely attain the true dao.

“The supreme dao is not complex; thus a few words can complete the dao. The dao’s attainment has many paths, depending on one’s encounter. Though passing through countless kalpas, it never exceeds these five. The thousand arts and hundred methods must all return to these six.

“Though through countless kalpas one delights in the true dao, without these instructions one cannot attain the supreme true dao. Through accumulated merit over kalpas, one will meet these instructions and receive them. Only then may one transmit them.

“The Mysterious Primordial is originally one; forming shape becomes two; uniting one returns to one. The secret lies in guarding the true fluids, true fluids being the Mysterious Primordial’s original one. Uniting two to preserve one is to communicate with spirit. The spirit talisman is true and mysterious, the five constants endless. Communicating spirit and acting transformation is the Three combined. The Three unite to form virtue, the power of returning to one, containing the Six Marvels’ rites, operating the Nine Extremes to transform, spirit transformations without measure, the true dao’s completion.

“To penetrate these instructions, carefully guard the true fluids, the difficulty of true fluids remaining, like wind passing through a window. It is like a feather cart entering a fiery hill, or a rotten rope controlling a galloping horse, governed by numbers above, naturally guarded within, harmonized and recorded below.

“Those who do not understand the Three Wonders are not of the dao. Dao practitioners carefully observe these Three Wonders, thus their merit is vast, their salvation endless.

“The One is led by Two, forming Three, using Five, encompassing Six, completing Nine, including Two and Four, interspersed with Seven and Eight. This is the natural number, the endless cycle of reincarnation. Three can form Five, Six can encompass Nine. Completion unites truth; encompassing unites the dao.

“Knowing the utmost Three Wonders and understanding the Six Marvels’ rites, one will surely attain true realization now, no longer a later-born ascending the dao.”

The two sages said:  
“We have long heard the wise words: to know the Three Wonders and Six Rites, what use is there for us? To know the One is to complete all affairs. We have always said the Three-One secret and Six Jia mystery are this; is this not mistaken?”

The Mother said:  
“Alchemy and escaping the Jia are the end; these instructions are the root. Root and end are mysterious, mysterious, mysterious indeed. Though root and end depend on each other, the refined and coarse are visible.”

The two sages said:  
“Please grant your compassionate grace and explain the ultimate secret.”

The Queen Mother opened her mouth and spoke, handing it to the two sages. The script was the natural true qi, formed into characters shining like green jade, clear and radiant, illuminating the purple void. The text read:

*“On the day of the Jiazi cycle, the day of removal, the time of vital breath, body and spirit harmonize leaves, not expecting old or young, precious is sincerity. Yang dwells at nine, Yin leads at seven, qi harmonizes heart and communication, mutually resolving as one. Beat the drum seven times; the secret incantation is: Separate Formula. This is the number’s governance. Pure, gentle, harmonious two, three, nine; thousands, hundreds, many more bring longevity. Regardless of season, precious is balanced regulation. Refine qi, fly elixir, surely communicate spirit. Separate formula. This is natural guarding.

“Gathering things, qi assists birth; though forms differ, Primordial is one, inconceivable, called spirit. If reverently combined and taken, the dao is formed. Separate formula. This is the medicine record.”*

The Mother said:  
“Diligently practice these three, preserve communication of five and six, true attainment is assured, no more than seven or nine. The dao values emptiness and non-action above all; why need persons or things?

“To study the dao deeply is to unite with the dao. Thus one can renounce all possessions, open wide and return to nothingness, reaching body and mind, vast and serene, empty as space, thereby uniting with the true dao.

“You now renounce these treasures, silent and unheeding, this is the proof of truth, the test of dao attainment. Those not yet able all await something. The dao needs no possessions; you may grant those with needs so that all find their place and arise in supreme vows.”

The two sages immediately obeyed and widely distributed. Those bearing grace clasped hands and praised:  
“Excellent are the two true sages; their merit is truly rare. Majestic they ascend the dao field; their compassionate virtue flows without end. All directions admire them; the Heavenly Venerable will surely perfect this. May we in the future attain the same aspirations.”

The two sages replied:  
“You all diligently seek teachers, wholeheartedly offer broad compassion, establish great fields of blessing, long cultivate pure fasting and cleanliness, cautiously and secretly practice without ceasing, never letting precepts be lacking. Gladly deliver beings, let grace flow to all. Dao and virtue thus shine bright. Knowing your past awakenings and wisdom, the Primordial Venerable cherishes and protects you. Surely you will meet these secret instructions; those who receive them will surely attain truth. Truth attained is true and imperishable, freely surviving and perishing as wished, flowing with transformations, merging the cavern and void, mysterious beyond mystery, joining mystery’s rhythm, eternal joy and boundless delight.

“This dao cannot be spoken of; only sincere seeking suffices. Do not lose the sacred accord. I now earnestly and solemnly entrust these instructions. Originally to ease slackness and wandering suffering. The marvelous truth is not a mere tale. May all strive diligently.”

Then the assembly all together solemnly intoned, “Well said!” and respectfully saluted the Heavenly Venerable before departing.

The True Youth said:  
“My surname is Zhou, given name Lingji, style Daotong. The Supreme Mystery Jade Maiden’s surname is Ji, given name Yuxuan, style Mingzan. Both came from the Primordial, through countless kalpas, studying the dao and cycling through rebirths, beyond description. Sometimes as emperors, kings, lords, ministers, sometimes generals, Confucian scholars, national teachers, Daoists, consorts, ladies, royal tutors, following the flow of life and death, always as husband and wife, accumulating blessings and fortune.

“In the first year of the Vermilion Spirit Era, born in the Primordial Azure Heaven, in the land of Floating Li, diligent and courageous, reverent and earnest. By the third year of the Red Bright Era, became Supreme Office True Person, assisting the Dao Lord, supporting the Great Emperor, their merit touching the Primordial Venerable, sincere and simple before the Queen Mother.

“In the fifth year of the Supreme Emperor, we encountered the secret instructions, received the divine formula, and attained the supreme true dao. By the ninth year of the Supreme Emperor, seeing the Queen’s refined thought and distant longing for the true dao, pursuing the hidden and remote, meeting masters and friends beyond count, researching subtle and deep, through countless kalpas, traversing mountains and waters, entering and exiting the human world, with heart embracing all things, intent on universal aid, spreading virtue widely, compassion embracing all, their influence reaching above and below, destined to attain truth.

“Now, with the Heavenly Venerable’s secret instructions and formula entrusted to us, the day of transmission is no different from before. We are ordered to temporarily rest in the Western City, roam the Five Sacred Mountains, oversee the Three Realms, supervise all, select and appoint the worthy, titled General Truth, assisting and praising the Supreme Lord Fusang Great Emperor, proclaiming the Primordial’s myriad marvelous formulas. From the Supreme Pure High True, Purple Void, Jade Void, Supreme Nothing, Supreme Highest, Supreme Void, Supreme Mystery, Supreme Element, Supreme Clarity, Supreme Peace, Boundless Heavens’ divine saints and true immortals all relate to the Queen, who delights in the dao of the Upper Earth. Diligently seek her.”
