### Scroll One of The True Scripture of the Supreme Cavernal One on Wisdom and the Dispelling of Demons

**The Exalted Numinous Grade of the True Elixir’s Mysterious Essence**

In the era of the Supreme Dao Lord, the Great Wisdom Text of the Upper Clarity, the True Elixir of Dispelling Demons and the Mysterious Essence of High Numinous Power was spoken. The Jade Palace Emperor once sat nearby and heard it, then told the Azure Youth Lord: “This is what is spoken in the *Upper Clarity Scripture of Dispelling Demons and Wisdom*. It can drive away evil and quell illness, expel spirits and remove harm, scatter the ghostly energies of the Six Heavens, and restrain the invasions of myriad demons. Reciting this chapter is truly like the branch and root of the Divine Tiger; the true qi is employed in secret. The Prime Minister Tuo may inform Daoist adepts who have a true name from their former destiny, those who before learning were ridden by many evils, or those sickened by ghostly beings in their chambers: if they recite it by day in their rooms and keep it in their hearts by night, all evil will be far away, and their spirits will open and brighten.” The Azure Youth Lord bowed and accepted these words, recording them in the chapters of divine talismans.

The name of the medicine of Jade Clarity and Upper Clarity and Supreme Ultimate is enough to repel a hundred ghosts; how much more so to consume its substance! The immortals of the Nine Palaces have never seen the chapters of this scripture; even the Supreme Ultimate’s highest truth does not transmit this great scripture of wisdom. This scripture is given only to disciples who understand emptiness, not to those with earthly true names; one must attain the Dao and ascend the Supreme Ultimate before it is passed on to worthy recipients. Now, the Supreme One has spoken only one ten-thousandth of the wisdom scripture; even if one has a true name on earth but has not studied the Dao, they have no fate to fully hear it. Thus, this scripture cannot be fully heard. Hearing its title alone reveals its medicinal name, for it is the jade script of the true name of Upper Clarity.

The Azure Youth Lord humbly accepted these words and later told Master Red Pine. Before Red Pine had attained the Dao, he suddenly fell ill in the Golden Flower Mountain, suffering deeply for sixteen years. Though he strove to preserve his true essence, his suffering did not heal. At that time, Pine calmed his heart to seek the Dao, refined his spirit and maintained stillness, initially not grieving his illness, nor fearing life and death. It is said that the spirits of the Six Heavens cause illness to disturb the true; sometimes the superior teaches to use illness, but the will is to break the true heart, seeing right and wrong like treading on water and fire, thus the illness is a test. Pine, having purified himself and supported his illness, recited the wisdom and dispelling demon chapters three thousand times, and all his ailments healed; his heart opened and spirit brightened, even better than before sickness. For illness serves four causes: first, to test sincerity of heart; second, to purge corpse-like filth; third, to dispel the unwholesome; fourth, to refine dust and defilement. If one’s heart is calm and steadfast, emotions rise and fall, seeking the Dao and guarding the spirit, hoping for the profound teaching, then illness can dissolve in an instant; if confused by illness and disturbed in heart, diligent but unsteady, emotions wandering and mixed, sincerity barely present, then illness may last all morning and exhaust one. Later Pine attained the Dao in Great Huo Mountain, ascended to the Golden Palace, received the scripture and became the True Man of Supreme Void, thus having a true name in Upper Clarity.

The *Wisdom Scripture* is also called the *Supreme Elemental Cavern Scripture* or the *Transmission of Pure Wisdom*. It consists of seven scrolls, stored in the Jade Clarity Palace, within the chamber of the Supreme Void Emperor’s Elixir. Constantly three thousand pure spirit jade maidens attend these seven scrolls. Hence it is sometimes called the *Supreme Elemental Cavern Scripture*. The wise know the Sun at its zenith is the Supreme Emperor; wisdom should urgently foster life. The character for wisdom contains two lives together, both riding one urgency.

Those who paint records refer to the *Wisdom Scripture*; those without painted records are the two images spoken by the Supreme Dao Lord. One should recite them in order, completing three thousand passes. If the count is insufficient and one pauses, begin again from the start. If fasting in the main chamber of the long fast, focusing the mind, upon finishing recitation, one must sever all external things and not pause mid-breath; pausing mid-breath brings torment from the body, and the Jade Youth Lord and the Three Officials report to the Golden Palace—one must be cautious. Practitioners must recite fully, dispelling evil and brightening the spirit, opening the heart and scattering foolishness, removing demons and pacifying qi, allowing true essence to enter the body. After fasting fifty days, one should recite it, folding hands in blessing, letting the voice flow from the mouth, neither neglecting nor rushing. After thoroughness, one attains the mystery; at that time, a spiritual being may descend to inform, able to understand its meaning and also fly through the Supreme Void. This is the True Man of Supreme Void. Reciting ten thousand times is best; upon completion, the cloud chariot will arrive. This Dao surpasses the thirty-nine scrolls of the Cavern Scripture, yet is still a reduced portion—only one ten-thousandth of wisdom’s essence. How much more so the full seven scrolls of profound enclosure! Yet the Four Poles rituals and methods must not be transmitted to earthly Dao learners who have not ascended to heaven. If fasting days permit, reciting this single scroll fully is best; the poor cannot do so. In the mundane world, one may open the divine text and listen to reading, not bound by the fasting or focused mind count. It is also proper to first briefly review, becoming familiar with the rules, then fast and recite. Three thousand passes make one completion; two or three thousand passes make one arrival; three thousand passes make one entry; four thousand passes make one brightening. The red script of the solemn ritual is the fourth brightening, scattering in accord with the occasion. Do not preview in advance; once familiar and reciting, do not neglect or pass over—this is the great taboo of the Azure Youth’s Eastern Ritual, lest one’s eyes lose their guarding light. Always focus steadily on the characters, reciting slowly and softly; if interrupted or mistaken, return and re-read, stopping to return thirty characters, burn incense quietly, rinse mouth facing east, beginning at dawn as if tying the yellow banner, the so-called warming of the supreme Dao at dawn.

While reciting the scripture, eat and rest at the three times: the hour of the dragon, the hour of the horse, and the hour of the rooster, until night departs and dawn arrives. If one completes a cycle but has not yet fasted to recite again, one may delay or hasten as one wishes, no need to interfere. If wishing to recite again after completion, one must fast again as at the start. Within the Cavern Platform, carved on the steep northern stone of the Western Mountain, the text reads: “Invitation to the gathering of pure delight, adding lectures on the essence of the supreme Dao’s bright wisdom, warming the wisdom scripture.” Much of the text lightly expresses the meaning of reciting scriptures.

The Great Wisdom Text of Upper Clarity, the True Elixir of Dispelling Demons and the Mysterious Essence of High Numinous Power, was received by the Supreme Dao Lord, also enabling one to fly the wheel through the void, cutting off the qi of the Six Heavens. This scripture has seven scrolls, treasured and secret by the Supreme Dao Lord. Now the Azure Youth Lord has copied one ten-thousandth of the dispelling demon chapter, placed among the divine talismans before and after.

The Supreme Old Lord, as Supreme Dao Lord, commands the Divine Tiger Great Talisman, the Golden Tiger True Talisman, and the Wisdom Plain Scripture, instructing the King Lord to transmit it to those who know the truth, and the Azure Youth to transmit it to those who accomplish the truth. The knower of truth is one who is truly wise and attains truth; the accomplisher of truth is one who diligently seeks and obtains truth. This book is only to be transmitted by these two lords to those with mysterious jade names; other True Men must not rashly transmit it. Therefore, the Supreme One told the Later Sage Jade Palace Emperor, who entrusted it to the Prime Minister and the Chief Steward. Within seven hundred years, three transmissions are permitted, first by oath and alliance; once completed, act accordingly; if no alliance, then after seven generations one is held accountable by the Three Yin Water Officials.

The Three Yin are the Three Officials of the Five Emperors, governing the death and life of sinners. The first left official governs the sins of the living; the second right official governs the sins of the dead; the third female official governs the sins of women. Also, the Water and Fire Left and Right Officials: the left Water Official governs those who speak falsely of Heaven and Earth, who divulge celestial patterns, who insult the two images, and who offend the three stars; the right Fire Official governs great rebellion, killing and harming life, attacking masters, plotting against parents—sins as great as Mount Qiu. The Five Palaces lie beneath Mount Tai, the shadow of Mount Tai, the small heaven of the hollow cave. The small heaven circles four thousand li, all placed under the Three Officials. Within the mysterious center are three great voids: Jade Clarity Great Void, Upper Clarity Great Void, Supreme Ultimate Great Void; within the mysterious center are three voids, and so too are the caverns. The Great Void lies beneath Mount Tai, above the hollow cave. The hollow cave lies beneath the Great Void, above the True Man’s official chamber. The Nine Palaces of Supreme Clarity also have three great voids. The great void lies beneath the Supreme Ultimate hollow cave, in the void of the Five Sacred Mountains.

**The Supreme One Speaks of Wisdom:**

The Supreme Old Lord attends the Supreme Dao Lord on his left; the Dao Lord leisurely dwells in the chamber of the Harmonious Morning Spirit View on the mountain peak, beneath the Nine Mysterious Purple Radiances; on his right guard stand six lion-like great beasts. Then the Supreme Protector True Man, Simple Birth, and the Jade Clarity Spirit Maidens, plain and pure, hold the incense of Vermilion Mound’s flying qi blossoms, clutching the essential mysterious secret chapters as they stand. The Supreme Dao Lord rinses with blue water, exhales crimson qi, with empty heart and quiet body, calming spirit and focusing the mysterious, wearing the Divine Tiger on the left and the Golden Truth on the right, reciting and chanting the Wisdom Upper Scripture, the Spirit Medicine Dispelling Demon Upper Chapter, and the Eight Mysteries, Nine Truths, Seven Gates, and Three Candles.

He says: “Empty, void; the text is mysterious and dense. A thousand truths halt their wheels, myriad spirits stop their steps. The numinous sound rises, intentions paint blessings, special sounds and rare melodies, cavernous gold and clear jade, overseeing hidden depths, illuminating concealed traps, mysterious patterns flow and shine, spirit views are sharp and swift, the Dao assembly is boundless, rare rhymes and subtle awakenings, whirlwind qi extends the void, dust and debris accumulate in realms. Thus the mysterious pearl shines with a melancholy light, the clear mirror records quiet stillness. The great Dao is far and complete, flying light distant and bright, moving steps on the spirit stream, startling waves of pure ease, sinking and rising in the nine underworlds, hard to comprehend or follow, transformations unexpected and lush, places not stained with ink, transformations soaring in the bright sun, rare dwelling of virtue and radiance, serene and joyful at the double gates, returning to grasp the principle’s hinge, calming the primal great image, shaking the vast rivers, dark caverns and mysterious passages, principle subtle and connected, wandering and playing with the divine blade, floating on the clear great mass, stirring the hundred yang to birth lightning, beating the thousand yin to exhale power, the Six Heavens lose their qi, the Nine Demons are destroyed and crushed. Holding the sun’s broad glow, myriad mists enter the embrace, stillness contracts with Heaven and Earth, movement matches the seven lights in brightness, resting yet unresting, dwelling in danger yet undangerous, reflecting through waves and mists, restraining truth and releasing rest, harmonious morning then two extremes separate and unite, a glance opens myriad darknesses. Thus feet step through the seven degrees, hands grasp heavenly secrets, the summit covers the mysterious stars, uniting the two instruments, rivers and mountains collapse and break, four qi flow and shift, countless hard bright stones, ears swift and clear, circulating spiritual degrees, expanding one mysterious return. Then the spirit completes the empty envoy, the subtle rhyme flies mysteriously, able to move the Great Void without turning, birth myriad winds in hidden cleverness, raise the eight lights above to ascend, hold the flying reins in clear command, ride the phoenix chariot for high viewing, release the cloud carriage to roam freely, rejoice in the nine distant reaches for broad clarity, soar the purple heavens and pause at the vermilion light, delight in the seven sources to connect qi, crown the azure ford and pour into the crimson well, whirlwind smoke, waves, and lightning, with wondrous body rising, clear sky spirit revered, spirit ladder cut off forever. Vermilion light already shines, branching into the mysterious river, folding wings to observe transformation, soaring still in empty net, myriad differences all reflected, flying wheels of jade peaks, phoenix cries and dragon leaps, tiger roars and phoenix sings, myriad sounds scatter like jade, countless jade blossoms in disorder, jade forest shakes the wind, crimson wood leaps in bloom.

Then stirring and harmonizing myriad sounds, flying chirps of a thousand rhythms, the numinous pattern unfolds, clouds neighbor and reveal substance, vast transformation flows in the morning, wondrous techniques emerge at dusk, loosening belts to wander spirits, embracing knees in pure stillness, observing transformation without embellishment, leveling mystery without flourish, standing at the pass of empty flow, pure and bright gathering, seven bright eternities, neither leaving nor valuing, roaming cold spirits, without pair or match, reverently entrusted to divine laws, singing and walking in dark grace. Grasping the heavens to prepare the liver, lion guards the chest, scorching fire guards the soul, copper head aligns the spirit, long teeth and flared ears leap in defiance, thunder father stirs qi with double lotus, raising teeth and drawing feet, thunder lord strikes and presses, six eyes camp fully, five tigers blow boiling, holding blades to chase evil, fierce beasts drive away filth, rushing qi and thunder essence, protecting life never to fall.

Yet this numinous bird first moves by human action, the Dao also aids life, soaring peaks condense spirit, shaking and revealing grandeur, nine calamities send away hardships, no thought no feeling, all harmonize the eight images, tool of mysterious qi light, high heavens seven glances, hanging fragrant blossoms, vermilion yellow flame gathering, not smoke but shining spirit, molding and moving true union, sprinkling simplicity and scattering names, rinsing taste with numinous brush, spirit qi calm and clear, riding waves of two heavens, high fragrant incense in darkness, jade maiden holds incense, purple consort embraces the censer, watering the sky pond, scattering blossoms in the jade court, issuing orders to armor riders, clans gathering heavenly soldiers, poisonous dragons spitting yin, divine tiger leading troops, outside entwining mysterious qi, inside preparing seven cities, Dao not yet descended and united, relying on might to be born, true accomplishment in equal virtue, primordial qi and mystery combined.

Therefore Jade Clarity’s true sky has no empty shore, high perching beyond darkness, embracing elixir clouds and mountain streams, reaching the highest Daoist scholars, shining with concealed brilliance, up to the highest virtue scholars, tasting solitary darkness, mystery not seeking truth, mark not opening radiance, soaring and contending with the great Dao, beside the Hao River, surging up at the proper time, rare subtle constant rhyme, flying strings distant and free, sounds without need of plucking, nine harmonies mysterious sounds, empty together at the supreme feast. Thus able to sever the heart beyond heaven, subtle and united in one view.

From here on, all are dragon radiance and four marshes, issuing essence of hidden immortals, roaming dreams of Jade Clarity, entrusting scenes above leisure, waves reflecting ascending void, hands pushing eight thousand, body shaking purple banners, red crown and lotus hat, shining over seven valleys, flying fragrance rinsing smoke, essence penetrating the Supreme Void, virtue and merit in the Nine Heavens, wearing sun and moon, peacefully dwelling in vast scrolls, flying wheels of the northern hill, loosening belts in the flowery garden, Western Mother commanding reins, joining riding at Turtle Mountain, four great benefactions, wondrous chants of the Supreme Mystery, six yin beautiful pride, coming to repair former connections, from virtue reaching without distance.

Those whose hearts have not awakened to truth are all adorned with jade teeth and dense blossoms, seven suns embracing the infant, nine jade liquids, eight precious essences, four purple juices, five pearls born of crimson, three blossoms flying steel, twin pearls moon bright, orchid wine gold, sweet dew jade vase, green constructed delicate gauze, drifting mushroom flowing spirit, divine channels elixir powder, mysterious branches linked and entwined, jade roots morning knot, Western Emperor’s pure fullness, able to leap into vermilion skies, fly the void of Jade Clarity, call and breathe it to reach true spirit, rinse and transform it to enter the purple court, also able to use the water of the Eastern Extreme Weaver Girl, also able to use the West’s utmost Venus Yu Qian, also able to reach the root of Southern Yang Light, also able to measure the Northern Moon’s Night City.

Thus the vermilion summer condenses yang, the bright whirlwind soars afar, the Supreme Void extracts essence, the two images circle light, the eight paths harmonize, riding the solemn movement of fragrance, transforming principle in nine absolutes, virtue flowing through the Jade Emperor, the three passes deep and quiet, spirit pavilion four sheets, auspicious clouds build the sky, six degrees of restful good fortune, spirit wind scatters demons, ritual drums summon troops, roaming the ford and washing the ford, cleansing the blue waves, refining soul and transforming spirit, all gathering the Dao field, picking purity and holding the flute, harmonizing qi and protecting longevity,服启华颖，惠赞外融，下挹玄流，仰排空同矣。DE未学，少玩道宗，昔因德举，位为仙皇，飞落脱世，上游空同，鳞游冥津，振地天江，朝夕众仙，下几存亡，耳忽闻玉清之上道，穷真之玄岸，志慕首仰，坐以待旦，我独何辜，耽此小宴，何可长染风尘，终为上皇所抃粲者乎？於是乃置弃仙章，解冠曩世，虽复体和纷林，然心栖象外，仿髴高秀，希音玉籁，尔乃遂辞荣散华，振策崇岭，咀嚼无炁，吸引二景，抗翅鸿征，极神测挺，寂胃虚中，敛炁倾鼎，殊荏守玄，弥春闭静，淡身自丧，尸不束整，放形存空，无执无秉矣。遂启洞门於希林，寻灵迹於丹穴，发九天之朱匮，望上清之琼札，玄书既刻於玉章，绛名始刊於虚阙，周游五岳，万岩毕至，百岫千峰，莫不履比，一瞻玉陛於紫清之云，再睹神文於锦云之笈，四遇三元於玄台，六造五老於灵室，为太帝携持有九，厕高上同辇者七，於是天扉廓散，素彻朗幽，延轮回轩，高会上朝，羽忮帔，流铃鸣箫，龙冠凤裙，随云逍遥，冥漠齐晨，心洞体辽，乃觉我往，医足虬藏，今起似鸾飙，是时实自足自娱，长宴紫宇矣。通玄测极，向空尤难，然后知道妙灵观，有累千之涂矣。足生齐全，玄心壁往，然后知求心之定，足生之幸矣。是故宗之者众，极之者寡矣。然正用无坚之心，以上向玉真之感，又须无难之往，以上求至生之固，亦必获玉映以齐照，终成帝皇之延容也。荡则万万而不冀，专则有冀而万来矣。诸有外情之徒，欲栖生之夫，闻道而膝行，道寂则俱亡，向山而两足酸寒，涉川而三血波战，五体交攻於未坠之谷，一身惊剧於死生之岸者，适足尽天年之劳苦，为声名之外规耳。要皆由心散不一，情荡不固，渐竞日滋，浑不自觉，坏正丧志，迷梦道林故矣，安可以告至道哉。

### Scroll Two of The True Scripture of the Supreme Cavernal One on Wisdom and the Dispelling of Demons

**The Chapter on Entering Meditation**

The Supreme Eight Techniques of Wisdom to Extinguish Demons and the Hidden Text of the Divine Tiger: those who obtain it enter meditation, living and living without death. The Prime Minister Azure Youth compiled and combined the chapters. If one is resolute and destined to meet this text, receiving it requires fasting and abstinence, bearing the Golden Dragon and Jade Fish oath. These are the names of myriad spirits and the secret names of thousands of demons and myriad monsters. Thus composed into text, the Supreme One Emperor of Great Unity often guards it with ghostly troops; do not lightly transmit it.

The Supreme Dao Lord then played the dragon cloud chime, the soaring sound of the heavens, myriad sounds entwined and stirred, flowing brilliance vigorous, purple haze circling, mysterious wind eightfold issuing. Then the Jade Phoenix stretches its neck, the Golden Luan arranges its qi, dragons roar over blue waves, tigers leap across the divine continent, nine howls harmonize, mysterious balance opens the void, beasts crouch and roll up sleeves, fierce horses open throats, mountains rise and forests cross, swords held to seize evil, myriad sounds in confusion, a hundred wolves and jackals and demons.

Then he commands the Jade Clarity Upper Palace maidens An Faying, Tian Sifei, Zhao Dingzhu, Cun Yunmen, and others to join in singing the poem of spirit waving, the melody of dispelling essence and scattering spirits. The words say:

“Floating the reins of the great rosy clouds, eight floats create cloud camps, the spirit clan governs the spiritual bosom, dragon feathers adorn the jade capital,  
Golden gates entwine the azure expanse, nine chambers illuminate purple jade, high carriage crosses the northern origin, rustling enters the unborn,  
Vermilion tiger guides the spirit master, green chariot ascends Upper Clarity, four mysteries brighten the morning ban, embracing blossoms returning to the phoenix city,  
Seven hardships still in Brahma green, aiming at the nine origin crossroads, proclaiming the treasure of great radiance, whirlwind subtle leaps and spreads,  
Orderly control opens the plain village, river spirits already advance, shadow clouds carry night and sun, candle and moon suddenly intersect at dawn,  
Forming brightness before the born spirit, leading and guiding to return to nothingness, myriad sources pour into the northern valley, riding the void to return as shooting stars,  
Extinguishing light and raising floating wanderers, towering peaks from sky waves, lingering joyful music lodges, subtle and wondrous rising to the void,  
Elegant dwelling of elixir and mystery, Supreme Void Dao red smoothness, dark and bright holding spirit talisman, secretly pushing without loss,  
Falling mystery displays the assembly, life begins like a long dream, virtue hidden within the inner traces, utmost stillness not perceived,  
Spirit essence responds to the great element, smoke reflects where it dwells, mysterious sounds play beyond grandeur, subtle threads how could doubt,  
Harmonious morning beats the long fan, glow and rosy clouds arise here, severing the cavernous vast flow, soaring wings on six command platforms,  
Spirit kings enter the jade void, reaching no invasion of vermilion troops, nine nets meet the vast expanse, wondrous assembly also pacified,  
Dao canon golden extreme chapter, plucking and tuning bright glory, thousand dragons spit clear water, nine rivers overturn and pour,  
Vast haze covers the absolute mansion, spirit waves four canopy courts, united heads at the mountain peak, none examine form or name,  
Leading and drawing in primordial harmony, elegant and free holding principle, containing essence burning cloud chamber, pure and clear zero records,  
Spirit Dao hastens to orchid palace, mysterious and mysterious immediately rise, myriad peaks all wondrous sights, clouds above hold jade seeds,  
Final kalpa harmonizes jade splendor, unaware the place begins, source spirit equal cavern transformation, sinking and forgetting fixed campaigns,  
River marquis forms the upper view, bright pearls and jade courts, principle without two void surfaces, condensed clarity how could lack fullness,  
Sun and moon intersect heavy yin, turning and brushing preserving fallen darkness, jointly bearing six senses outside, spirit chants in one voice,  
Operating the pivot and celestial path, shining and moving splendid jade, myriad spirits ride vermilion horses, thousand demons have no time to live,  
Demons extinguished in water and fire palaces, true body treasured supreme chastity.

Four fates at northern cliff, principle spirit steady reins, calling and summoning earth deities, earth essence concealing qi,  
Mountains and rivers hiding clouds, nine sources utterly extinguished, checking and judging thousand spirits, holding heads thunder shakes,  
Northern emperor opens the Dao, four lights serve the reins, crushing and destroying myriad evils, binding and cutting Feng Mountain,  
Nine ghosts share the head, thousand demons one body, five emperors wield axes, spirit lords spit smoke,  
Purple brightness refines the view, vermilion qi coils and entangles, spirit runs night platform, essence hides long and continuous,  
Poisonous beasts ten thousand feet, slaughtering none kin, what small demons gathered in hundreds and thousands,  
Exchanging qi all gaze, man opens life gate, divine tiger unleashes might, cutting jackals, owls, and remnants,  
Supreme wondrous Dao, to the spirit’s discernment, you now receive it, always wear it on your body,  
Ten thousand trials not fail, thousand demons not harm, jade splendor arrives at chamber, heavenly truth revolves,  
Chanting clear spirit sounds, attending the three origins.”

When the song ends, the Supreme Dao Lord commands the left mysterious jade attendant Yu Lang Yuli Xuan, holding the purple-gold feather baton, to summon the Supreme Emperor of the Supreme Microcosm. The Supreme Microcosm Emperor condenses and transforms essence qi, wields the true scepter of emptiness, roars and commands myriad spirits, governs the primordial net, holding golden truth in hand, gazing lightly at the supreme origin. Suddenly hearing the command to set out, mounts the imperial feathered spirit carriage, the Vermilion Emperor opens the Dao, carriage armored with heavenly soldiers, ten thousand tigers drive away, golden dragons command troops, jade baton casts light, flying blossoms enter darkness, flowing impurities illuminate the formation, moving to open.

Sun essence beats the blue drum’s vast waves, strikes the jade bell’s booming sound, then mysterious balance harmonizes, broad music restrains the rear, nine phoenixes stretch necks and sing, hundred dragons hold ford and blow together, golden essence leaps sound, eight luan birds soar and dance, purple banner raised to the sky, embroidered banners circle the fields, green canopies array shade, curved morning suddenly raised, flowing bells intermingled, moonlight penetrates sound, jade gems display truth, circling and pausing five images, incense flowers scatter smoke, misty blossoms three lights, light sky receives radiance, thin rosy clouds carry light, ringing reins seven paths, eight carriages float in the void, empty carriage nine thousand, guarded by poisonous dragons, running clouds rushing to mystery, gathering qi seizing wind, dawn bright and flourishing, eight lights hazy, true maiden rides right, left commands spirit youth, suddenly thousands of billions, already arriving at the upper palace, halting carriage at Jade Clarity, body surpassing imperial walls, circling purple gates, bowing head awaiting passage.

After a long while, the Supreme Dao Lord commands the four morning attendants to lead forward, enter the pearl medicine gate, enter the seven reflections inner chamber. The Supreme Microcosm Emperor names himself: “Your humble servant now arrives, please hear the great command.”

The Supreme Dao Lord says: “Li Shanyuan’s virtue unites the seven saints, master of the Golden Palace, now to visit the Ten Heavens, governing fate of myriad beings, fixing the middle origin in mysterious principle, regulating yin and yang to align heads, raising truth and selecting leaders, sealing rivers and summoning seas, deciding life and death, wielding heavenly might, beheading the Six Heavens, commanding the Three Officials, arranging the Northern Emperor, bright lord attending the pavilion, the Dao also high and eminent, virtue vast and far-reaching, responsibility weighty, power equal. I have already spoken to him wisdom, and again recorded dispelling demons. Wisdom can drive spirits, dispelling demons can destroy evil. I further grant him the Divine Tiger True Talisman, to wield might over the Six Heavens, chanting the high chapter of spirit waving, also aiding in scattering filth and removing affliction. Moreover, the Supreme Microcosm Emperor treasures the Golden Tiger True Talisman to control Heaven and Earth’s spirits, commanding it to act swiftly to destroy a thousand essences. Wearing it, one goes forth and ten thousand ghosts vanish in form, myriad demons rashly invade and immediately die, hordes of monsters spy upon it and their eyes darken. Thus it can all be granted to Shanyuan to fulfill his duty.”

Then the Supreme Microcosm Emperor bows and complies, opens the cloud box, releases the jade casket, seven lights shine on white, flowing sun opens truth, nine radiances halt brightness, flying incense entwines. Holding the talisman but not yet granting, he turns to command the Supreme Microcosm maidens Ji Linhua, Yan Caiyun, Zhu Tiaoyan, Han Fangyao, and others to join in singing the golden truth poem, the melody of walking emptiness. The words say:

“Great darkness severs four mysteries, cavernous light entrusts divine powers, jade terrace spreads vermilion sky, green haze has golden ramparts,  
Raising cloud pearl ridge, gazing at blade-less peak, spirit mirror shines purple knot, haze foam brightness pierces void,  
Dark transformation entwines mysterious jade, raising rhythm carrying purple youth, round path without condensed dust, splendid haze again has layers,  
South disperses vermilion mound gate, west crosses grand missing window, form delicate ten thousand ford waves, spirit born treads ten directions,  
Mysterious return to silent carriage, upper sound rides heavenly dragon,  
Darkness spreads flying light carriage, waving bells seven paths roam, light and clear cloud dust ford, suddenly arriving at jade state,  
Left holds jade reflection wife, right commands golden truth husband, upper connects flying sky worthy, lower supports spirit wondrous fields,  
Extending and entwining vast cold universe, spreading brocade into spirit hill, phoenix brain solidifies kalpa age, nectar of blossoms reverses decay,  
Supreme One feasts on longevity, commands fate ten thousand final steps, three awakenings bear mysterious numbers, freely rejoicing flashing teeth turns,  
Whirlwind brilliance halts jade splendor, purple cassia where to rest, jade fruits ring in nine skies, jade baton summons Supreme Microcosm,  
Yellow plan restrains virtue blade, how rare the True Man’s radiance, abandoning plainness entering no form, all images begin to vanish,  
Bright yang elixir qi essence, dazzling vermilion clouds fly, matching contract jade reflection stillness, dazzling suspended Upper Clarity domain,  
Spirit responds to dark numbers, following feelings summoning destined generations, vast ford waves flourish, mingling radiances join descendants,  
Lofty golden palace son, desolate entering cloud border, looking down and up at myriad changes, will follow true essence contract,  
Mysterious dwelling severed silent platform, clear chanting wisdom and insight, dispelling demons extinguishing myriad blades, waving poems to chase filth,  
Golden tiger inherits heavenly might, crushing spirits to conceal qi, sweeping demons ten thousand acres, ten thousand miles without evil speck.”

Here the great god cuts blood, a hundred essences lose eyes, golden tiger brandishes might, spewing power and poison, gathering ghosts without interval, slicing open belly, Six Heavens share the head, spirits instantly confined, birds and beasts hide sound, forests and grasses lie down. Supreme origin wondrous and free, spirit script clear and dense, wearing it and advancing, able to attend the Jade Emperor, revering him in the jade chamber, myriad truths arrive at his room. If the Divine Tiger text leaks, disaster strikes the nine clans. If the Golden Tiger True Talisman leaks, calamity reaches the seven ancestral elders. Shanyuan hides it, the Daoist virtue’s elite.

When the song ends, the Supreme Microcosm Emperor grants Li Lord the Golden Tiger True Talisman; after a solemn year they each depart separately. Li Lord having received the two talismans and heard the Supreme One speak the two scriptures of wisdom and dispelling demons, informs the Prime Minister Azure Youth, who with the Chief Steward and four assistants compiles and assembles the text, ordering it to be constantly used to transmit to those destined to be True Men, allowing three transmissions within seven hundred years.

This poem is subtle and strange in sound, mostly the names of Heaven and Earth’s myriad spirits, secret names of thousands of demons and poisonous monsters. The Supreme One chants their names to reveal their transformations, to narrate their affairs, to pledge their talismans. Spirit reflects eight views, spirit cave wondrous falls, mighty spirit secret talisman, dispelling demons and monsters, thus forming the Divine Tiger, headed on top, Golden Tiger next in order, wisdom flourishing in the text, dispelling demons displayed between the characters. If afraid at night, just chant these two poems, and a thousand essences scatter and hide, as if sharing a bed with ten thousand. Mountains and rivers hearing this chant, their gods all grasp whips and face the sound to bow respectfully. How much more so wearing the divine gold to shine through the Six Heavens, how could they not gather and submit? If there are Dao aspirants roaming the Five Sacred Mountains, wishing to ascend immortality and transcendence, but lacking the Supreme Microcosm Emperor and Supreme One Lord’s secret names and Golden Tiger True Talisman, their name cannot enter the Immortal Mansion. Wearing this talisman and chanting the dispelling demon text, a thousand essences advance and hide, as if sharing a bed with ten thousand. Mountains and rivers hearing this chant, their great gods all grasp whips and face the sound to bow respectfully. If wearing the Supreme Microcosm Emperor’s secret and Supreme One Lord’s characters, one must bear the oath of faith and request the master’s secret formula, not to experience defilement; this is the secret subtlety of the eight earthly hidden arts. Do not lightly leak it; transmitting to unworthy persons brings calamity for a hundred generations. Those who cannot receive it now may have it sealed back to the sacred mountains.

### Scroll Three of The True Scripture of the Supreme Cavernal One on Wisdom and the Dispelling of Demons

**The Chapter on Guarding the One**

The Supreme One said to the Jade Palace Emperor: “Ordinary people are brave and fierce, able to follow precepts and restraints, subdue heart and form, accumulate merit and virtue, and forever become great sages; all depends on guarding the One. The One is without form, yet can respond and sense; when sensing, it must take form, following cause to see effect. One has and one has not, endless and boundless, without toil or loss, without decrease or increase, without fault or burden, without death or birth, without birth yet always born, always born without death, deathless birth, birth giving rise to all, all receiving birth, relying on this deathlessness, deathlessness able to give birth, generating countless forms. Those who guard it have wisdom; those who abandon it are foolish and ignorant. Foolishness leads to death, wisdom preserves life. Life and birth are precious, all things delight in it; delighting in life hates death, qi contained together, yet those seeking life do not live, those fearing death hasten death. Death and life do not follow the path; thus they deviate from what is hoped. Not deviating depends on wisdom; wisdom first arises, arising knowing there is One. The One is birth qi, qi births mutual generation; must not forget or lose it, must not block or restrain it. Blocking qi seeking life, life qi cut off, cut off means death; death does not come from life. Dark and long suffering, the wise awaken to it; awakening not early is called ignorance. Ignorance falls into foolishness, foolishness hard to transform; transformed but unaware, aware but not diligent, diligent but cannot last, lasting but not refined, refined but leaking, this is called no break. No break falls into ignorance, ignorance severe and unchanging, not wisdom. Wisdom is changing confusion into Dao, abandoning evil returning to right. Guarding one’s life qi, qi births mutual generation, life qi transforms and changes, separates and unites forming three: one called primal origin, two called original cavern, three called mysterious void. Below is mysterious qi, mysterious qi governs void, cures illness and dispels disaster, riding void is possible. Middle is original qi, original qi governs cavern, prolongs life and prevents death, removing obstacles is possible. Above is primal qi, primal qi governs origin, mutual generation unceasing, wondrous existence is possible. Wondrous existence combines three: original, cavern, void. Some cannot combine all; practicing void practices virtue, increasing longevity; alone suppressing thought, occasionally not acting, preserving body as root, engaging things as branch; root and branch together is called wisdom. Practicing cavern establishes merit, teaching and transforming to save and nourish, occasionally acting for others, alone being sincere, aiding things first, perfecting body later; later and former are two, called intelligence. Practicing origin cultivates virtue and merit, one moving one still, things and self both aided, later and former one before another, following time without loss, one condensing one releasing, giving birth to self and child, giving birth to body and person, person and spirit communicating smoothly, called wisdom. Wisdom’s qi is qi at the source of Dao, source originally nameless, forcibly called primal; primal qi’s priority is life, life urgent; urgent life births things, and I always live; living continuously unceasing is the seed of Dao, illness healed and disaster dispelled, grace bestowed without end, favor unbounded. Therefore one qi is most wondrous; learners not knowing this are not wise. Knowing this One is primal One, able to combine three matters, thus called original One; next called mysterious One, collectively called three Ones. Among three Ones, three matters differ; differing and acting, merit and virtue have depth and shallowness; mixed and united, name and title supreme source; source One’s wonder neither increases nor decreases, neither dies nor lives, yet life is endless; thus highest and most honored, standing alone unchanging.

Those born and living must pair yin and yang, one qi truly recognizing mutual generation, two halves forming one, one giving birth to three, diligently passing on endlessly, called aspiration. Aspiring to this one source, must not be blocked, indulging color and displaying emotion, abandoning ugliness and pursuing beauty, vanity and losing simplicity, jealousy, contention, and strife—this is not wisdom. Wisdom is little selfishness and few desires; desires pure but unattached, desires to act but not contend; if desiring exclusivity and slighting others, desiring this and hating that, desiring harmony and competing for precedence, desiring to be first and seeking honor, desiring to have and wishing others none, desiring beauty and wishing others ugly, desiring swift gain and allowing others delay, stubborn and unchanging, clinging and not letting go, mad with thought of self, violating scriptures and breaking laws, disregarding human and spirit responsibilities, ignoring consequences to come, this is not wisdom. Wisdom guards the One, truly sets the heart’s source; the heart’s source is habitual; setting the Dao is difficult to expand; first one must wear talismans; precision brings efficacy.

The sixteen talismans on the right begin on the eighth solar term day, written in vermilion on bamboo slips, facing north at dawn, swallowed with two bows; after bowing, recite wishes as desired, stopping after sixteen days. Also vermilion on white plain paper, sealed in brocade pouch, worn on the head for five years, true and one appear together.

The three talismans on the right, vermilion on plain paper, worn on left elbow for females and right for males. After eight years, the three and one appear together. Also on the first day of the first month, a blue-written talisman on white paper, facing north, bow twice and swallow. Later carved in gold, nine inches long, four inches wide, three fen thick, to seal the evil spirits of mountains and rivers, governing the true essences of the Five Mountains. After wearing the talisman, truly preserve the three and one.

Between the eyebrows, one inch upward is the Bright Hall; two inches is the Cavern Chamber; three inches is the Upper Elixir Field, called the Mud Pellet Palace, one inch square, purple qi rushing to heaven, within is the sun image, nine inches round, shining nine hundred thousand li. My form changes, size fleeting, forgetting body, preserved in thought. The Upper Origin Red Child dwells beneath the Mud Pellet Palace’s canopy, named Mysterious Condensation Heaven, titled Three Origins First, also called Elder Supreme, also Elder Historian Hua, position Mud Pellet Heavenly Emperor. To the right is the imperial minister, named Zhaole Jing, titled Middle Mystery, also called Rising Not, also Constant Support. Both naked, appearing as infants.

The heart is the Middle Elixir Field, called the Crimson Palace, one inch square, vermilion smoke ascending to heaven, within is the sun image, seven inches diameter, shining seventy thousand li. My form changes, the Middle Origin True Man, named Spirit Movement Pearl, titled Southern Elixir Son, also called Birth Elder, also Historian Yunju, position Crimson Palace Elixir Emperor. To the right is the assistant imperial minister, named Zhong Guangjian, titled Four Transformations Spirit, also called Quiet Cart Elder, also Heavy Historian Hua. Both naked, infant-like, sitting facing each other.

Three inches below the navel is the Life Gate Elixir Field Palace, one inch square, white qi rushing to heaven, within is the sun image, five inches round, shining fifty thousand li. My form changes, the Lower Origin Infant, named Beginning Bright Essence, titled Original Yang Prosperity, also Infant Fetus, also Elder Historian Yuan, position Yellow Court Original King. To the right is the protector minister, named Returning Upper Bright, titled Valley Lower Mystery, also Serving Elder Elder, also Receiving Light Life. Both naked, infant-like, sitting facing each other.

Preserving and remembering the three and one, accumulating long to see it, seeing it brings spirit power, completing wisdom and insight. Those who learn wisdom and insight preserve the One but not refined, One not descended and manifested, spirit not fully permeated, still with disaster and affliction, affairs unclear. Though possessing the method, not preserving life, yet self-knowing and self-sufficient, despising others, others’ abilities, foolish people’s understanding, call it no wonder and do not pay attention. Once intention is not preserved, cannot understand; understanding is not essential, essential is also to use; using it harmoniously with light, foolish is hard, wise is easy; abandoning and refusing is not doing; doing but not right, insufficient to mingle with dust, cannot help others, not wisdom. All arts and crafts, games and entertainments, men and women, ghosts and spirits, beauty and ugliness, mixed methods, body, mouth, heart affairs, sound, color, touch, dryness, movement, stillness, hidden and manifest, transformation, floating and sinking, existence and nonexistence, power and reality, right and wrong, all clouded; if one does not understand one, not wisdom.

Those learning wisdom and insight embrace the One without leaving it; leaving the One loses wisdom and insight, all due to the Three Peng. The Upper Peng enslaves the soul and spirit, greed and lust cause aging; Middle Peng enslaves the consciousness spirit, thus anger causes illness; Lower Peng enslaves essence and will, thus foolishness causes death. Death returns to ghost ranks, called corpse; the suffering of corpse ghosts is the Three Peng; thus called Three Peng, wild and unruly, hard to subdue. Unable to subdue them, body and spirit troubled, harmed, torn, destroyed, sinking into wind blades, torment and pain, long night sorrowful, dust kalpas endless, how not to fear! The wise first treat the three ghosts, forbid greed and lust, must not be stuck in contention, suppress and endure anger, not reaching litigation and fighting; fighting stops contention, sin does not reach death. Death comes from stagnation; stagnation is ignorance; contention and fighting touch, extreme heart showing force, not knowing to stop or retreat, until death calamity severe and cruel, regret with nowhere to pursue. Therefore cultivation and learning must first embrace the One, embrace the One and preserve spirit, no stagnation in affairs, acting without acting, daily reducing and completing virtue. Greed and lust may temporarily arise; if able to repent, anger arises, immediately suppress it, suppress and change it, finally avoiding stagnation, avoiding stagnation means no death and long life. Temporary greed and lust are easy to catch but hard to remove; loosening greed is easy, lust and anger are more difficult. All containing consciousness wish to win; they come to add to me, intention unbearable; if unbearable then retribution, contention and fighting arise, easy to start hard to stop, thus causing death and defeat. Swear to respect the Dao, guard the One without leaving it; if oneself does not offend others it is easy; not letting others offend oneself is hard; offended and not retaliating, intention not to repay enmity; repaying enmity with Dao further opens liberation, explains and dissolves hatred, enters true truth, never raising hatred, forever united in source One. Those who deviate from this method are not wise.

The wise superior person leads others by self; Supreme Above and Below know; words form teachings; teachings are chanted; seven chapters as follows:

One: Knowing One but not guarding, guarding but not firm, firm but not lasting, not wisdom.

Two: Knowing Three but not curing, curing but not strict, strict but not eternal, not wisdom.

Three: Knowing misfortune but not avoiding, avoiding but not secret, secret but not constant, not wisdom.

Four: Knowing words not close, close but not praising, praising but not completing, not wisdom.

Five: Knowing customs can be cured, cured but not fixed, fixed but not flourishing, not wisdom.

Six: Knowing Dao can be practiced, practiced but not clear, clear but not abundant, not wisdom.

Seven: Knowing ignorance has knowledge, knowledge but not refined, refined but not precise, not wisdom.

These seven awakenings and seven chants are natural words. Formerly the Supreme One, and now my body, and future ascension, all chant these words, dispelling demons and tests, extinguishing myriad evil doubts, doubts removed and confusion cleared, returning ends to roots, roots hard to reach, ends all conspire, one effort one breath, merits and faults shift, coming and going, meeting and following immediately arriving, must respond and feel, feeling moves it, opening and enlightening darkness, darkness gains light, light returns to right awakening, awakening all is nothing, nothing contains wonder, wondrous qi transforms, refining false into true, true by five virtues, virtues meet six penetrations, penetration supports seven awakenings, awakening depends on this chant, chant responds to that feeling, feeling reveals life and name, naming is response, bearing cause entering effect, having proof and sign, no difference no error, seven five middle six, six changes form and complete, that feeling still signs, moving it makes it manifest, trace by my feeling, I have feeling name, name differs but essence same, sign manifest as difference, differing from stillness and movement, opposite shores first divide, divide one into two, three births six completes, completes six six traces, six traces one heart, heart source originally one, flowing schools endless, great divisions six, coming and going related, acting it goes beyond Three Realms, abandoning it enters Nine Underworlds, wisdom and insight practice six, able to transcend Three Realms, cross Nine Underworld sufferings, thus called Six Degrees, six six thirty-six heavens, all jointly cultivate six degrees.

One is diligence, practicing good without slack; two is faith, steadfast on Dao without forgetting; three is softness, guarding One using gentleness; four is perseverance, like beginning without failure; five is admonishing and correcting, stopping evil without offense, things and self both complete; six is abandoning wine and lust, harmonizing light and communicating spirit, mingling with dust and planting Dao, no darkness no stagnation, this is wisdom. This wisdom is clarity as constant, offering wine without drunkenness, no darkness no stagnation, communicating spirit aiding multitudes, binding Dao seed people, having but not disorder, thus called abandonment. Abandonment is no stagnation, stagnation is violating precepts; violating precepts causes confusion and stupor, not wisdom. Those who learn and practice preserve spirit and admire virtue, not yet without dependence, observe austerity and show honesty, follow and respect daily reduction, manifest honesty and spirit clarity, offer and nourish worthy virtue, express utmost sincerity, follow and abide by laws, must not be lax.

Wine is essence of grains, good at promoting qi and fluids; restrainers connect spirit and benefit nature; indulgents disturb spirit and harm life; intoxication leads to non-being, not wisdom. Source One is natural, mysterious Two forms images, two qi flow and moisten, harmonizing Three Three, Three One spreads all, saints universally same age, great virtue full, two halves give birth, two halves form one, one one endless. Abandoning virtue and liking lust, ignoring seed people, indulging desires and showing emotion, not wisdom. Wisdom’s flow knows sun setting and moon, revered by imperial spirit, life urgent, self-expanding and extending to things, transmitting transformation endlessly, carefully not to deviate.

Two qi lose harmony, or yin with yin conjoin, or yang with yang entwine, or men gather women, or women assemble men, noble and base mixed, Dao and common tangled, jealousy and anger, separation as height, causing seed to break and lineage to end, degeneration and barrenness, seeking return not yet due, regret too late. Or men lust after beauties, women love handsome men, unions not of wife and concubine, matches not of groom and husband, illicit and disorderly, life and death contrary to truth, unable to change and awaken, not wisdom. Wisdom is clear and bright, not evil not disorderly, thus ascending Three Purities, Jade Capital and Purple Tenuity, source of supreme Dao, reached by clarity.

All qi contained, no ability no desire, desire has depth and shallowness, affairs have weight and lightness, light ones touch, if not stopped then heavy. Self not offending others, others offend must bear, bearing brings resentment, words cannot resolve, not wisdom. If respecting rank inside and outside, having mutual offense, with gentle smiling and pleasant speech, using analogy and explanation, flowing tears and sorrow, scolding and threatening, various methods to cause stopping. Thinking weighing reality, one pull one suppress, not causing anger, small becomes big, then not stopping, old fate deeply evil, sages unknown, compassionate thoughts not blaming, secret shame unable to stop it. Careful not to speak openly and reveal spirit, wisdom and insight have helplessness, precisely such, also must not be overly ashamed or hateful, abandoning what no longer exists, or not guarding and seeing failure, letting others run wild, no compassionate saving merit, not wisdom. Wisdom guards stillness and preserves spirit, forgetting form and settling qi, qi communicating without contention, contention can be stopped. Forgetting form and spirit preserved, admonitions often followed; if forgetting spirit and preserving form, benefiting self and cutting others, others do not believe or follow, instead adding resentment and hatred, long after causing disaster, not wisdom.

All actions, acting for Dao is beginning, myriad affairs all rough and coarse, rough and coarse can be abandoned, subtle beginning hard to deviate, deviating subtle chasing rough, not wisdom. Wisdom arises heart and moves mouth, moves and stills body, acting Dao is beginning, beginning good and ending good, end not violating beginning, refining heart daily essence, good acts refined and advanced, merit only new; unable is not wisdom.

All establishing body and mind, same mouth thinking Dao, embracing One uniting all, practicing weakness respecting softness, rivers and seas are tolerant, thus called river king, able to endure insult, receiving filth becoming master, unable to bear hardship, not discerning good or bad, not bearing vexation, not wisdom. Wisdom has no broken two images, things and self are one, right and wrong insufficient to discuss, discussing not carelessly holding, suffering and joy need not distinguish, distinguishing not used to argue, acting good not self-praising, receiving slander not self-pleading, heart different from this, not wisdom.

All life receives life, life is most precious, valuing Dao and venerating scriptures, respecting masters and relations, these are three treasures, treasures true and priceless, three cannot be biased, biased then stuck and sluggish, complete then round and thorough, thorough then aids multitudes, aiding multitudes depends on three honors, honored body becomes one, one three respond and feel, hidden and manifest, silent and speaking, mingling and saying. Dao treasure is formless, hidden as transformation root, scripture has words, manifest as teaching beginning, master has form and words, origin and departure are method, words and silence follow time, long lasting is best. Most important instruction is to save limitless people, respect and believe three treasures, preserve steadfast without forgetting, fasting and offering to summon spirits, holding precepts and acting Dao, cautious and not failing, complete and without breach. Breach and failure is first, change past and cultivate future, not repeating is sure to save the world, not believing not holding, not changing not repenting, cannot save world, not wisdom.

All hearing the great Dao swear to diligently act, act good without rest, diminish self and aid things. Those with literary and martial talent use knowledge and understanding to help others; those with courage and qi strength use labor to help others; those with power, position, and wealth use honor and salary to help others. Without these three, use good heart to help others, seeing others’ good deeds, assist in joy and delight, seeing others avoid affairs, assist in sorrow and worry; though no immediate benefit, affinity and feeling long relate; others have good people’s blessings, self receives good heart’s corresponding reward, reward same as giving, increasing without rest, accumulating without loss. Naturally have talent, power, and position. Without these four kinds of giving, not wisdom.

Wisdom acts these four things first among six degrees; learning emptiness not emptiness is saintly proof’s peak; peak not empty empty, not empty not empty, empty void no more. No have have, have have not have, no no not no, no no refined coarse, have have good evil, have no good evil, no have refined coarse, have no mutual generation, refined coarse mutual form, cannot exhaust, not wisdom.

Clear and bright, bright but not dazzling, use action abandon concealment, all cannot measure, correct heart and govern body, check mouth and guard silence, three karmas no violation, Dao sufficient spirit complete, sinking and floating free, high raising six penetrations, called Brahma conduct, conduct higher than common, leaving earth ascending heaven. Six degrees crown Brahma conduct, seven awakenings ascend Great Luo, not for lower saints and middle truths to tread, next immortals and sages, how can they reach? As for small wisdom great confusion, small insight great delusion, holding no attachment to have, harming each other, evil comes to interfere and test, not crossing and not knowing, thus falling back, not wisdom. Wise and virtuous, diligent in merit, merit surpassing special, also attaining above harmony, harmony then demons vanish, should be brave and fierce, later body first reach, you truly declare. Jade Palace Emperor bows and complies.

### Scroll Four of The True Scripture of the Supreme Cavernal One on Wisdom and the Dispelling of Demons

**The Chapter on Attaining Sagehood**

The Supreme One said to the Azure Youth Lord: “All sages accumulate merit, causes and conditions bring results, results fully attained, wondrous forms peerless, saving and delivering the Thirty-Six Heavens, thus gaining Thirty-Six appearances, generating eighty-one grades, thus gaining eighty-one excellences. All great responses jointly see complete forms, small responses chapters correspond, each manifesting more or less, less appearing more hidden, all unable to perceive. Therefore all sages’ true bodies are without fixed form, substance fixed and constant, no increase no decrease. Knowing this is rare, thus uniquely honored. Yet aspiring scholars, though illumination not yet complete, regarding what is seen, according to recognition meet wonders. Those recognizing eyebrows and eyes see special eyebrows and eyes; those recognizing nose and mouth perceive nose and mouth surpassing; thus thirty-six, each according to recognition and brightness, brightness extreme recognition complete, then fully clear. All contain qi, same but differing in more or less, more innumerable, less extreme to one, one not yet attainable. This same path distant, must cultivate and refine, refining more returns to less, less not yet one, still has thirty-six steps, steps are one heaven, one great difference, great difference is one, heaven’s extreme. Thirty-six extremes gather one source. Therefore gathering method, each establishes rituals and techniques, laws and traces uneven, sometimes same sometimes different. Differences and sameness root in goodness; goodness is root, one divides response, forming thirty-six. Three qi three realms all contained therein, color connects outside, outside gains forgetting words, gaining thirty-six, thirty-six heavens, each has its one, supreme victorious appearance, Supreme One fully possesses. Various heavenly beings, true men, immortals, sages, spirits, each with more or less. All worldly people, emperors, lords, down to commoners, also each with more or less. Wealthy and short-lived, poor and long-lived, no home or mansion, yet have masters and lords, have palaces and dwellings but no resources, some with much treasure not caring for clothes and hats, some richly adorned not managing houses, even under trees in grass huts, famous and high, some with splendid halls and elegant gardens to spread fragrant wind. Also jade terraces without Dao, stone doors with virtue, uneven countless threads, victories and defeats myriad ends. Above have lower affairs, below have upper karma, causes and conditions differ, cultivation and practice vary, must not mutually blame; blame harms recognition, spirit fully permeated, permeation in five virtues, five virtues fully complete, all traces can be forgotten, forgetting traces but traces remain, natural appearances complete. Having thirty-six, then noble, wealthy, talented, bright, majestic and radiant, surpassing all, palaces and cities, precious canopies and beds, incense flowers, music and entertainment, attendants and guards numerous, civil and martial wings, banners and drums grand, wind and cloud clear and harmonious, movement and stillness attached, sun and moon fiery light, myriad colors of robes and crowns, hundred harmonies of flavors, body and mouth abundant. Necessary and unnecessary, fitting and free, supreme True Men, Supreme One Original Lord, accumulate learning and goodness, ultimately attain this; those not attaining revolve in birth and death, death and life suffering and joy, one has and one has not, recognition cannot connect, stagnation loses order, order lost falls to evil, no return period, return to good. Now learners each carefully measure, what has and what has not, seek what is not, not stuck in what is, able to nourish things, lacking then self-attain.

Those with wealth but no talent or understanding should practice giving, not generating stinginess, lightly valuing wealth and honoring Dao, talent and understanding daily renewed. Those with houses but no peace should accept worthy sages, abandon and dwell with true immortals, heart without regret, worries and troubles vanish. Those with clothes and food but no longevity should reduce body and mouth, offer to bright masters, seek wondrous formulas, practice wondrous techniques, heart not lax, surely preserve and extend life. Those with talent and wisdom but no sustenance should hide bright inner observation, secretly transform later born, guide all, not naming their merit, humble and retreat hiding traces, heart without doubt, spirit bright protected, humans and ghosts revered, self gain wide domain, heavenly palace and blessed hall, clothes and food miraculous, attendants splendid. All such types, pushing all affairs, affairs naturally manifest, no need to record fully. The wise gain it, abandoning having to seek nothing, nothing not necessarily attained, attaining nothing without stagnation, stagnation not being restraint. Those seeking then given, no clinging; this is no stagnation, not abandonment. Though not seeking, having labor and worry, abandoning and avoiding others, this is called abandonment, not no stagnation. Abandoning this and that, stagnating this nothing, still not Dao. Also seeking and giving, I though not clinging, they get disaster; this roughly no stagnation, also not Dao. Dao does not stagnate the wondrous; wondrous is illumination; I abandon without loss, they gain benefit; this is Dao, wise person.

Giving to many, suitable and unsuitable, those suitable are wisdom, those unsuitable are foolish ignorance; ignorance in giving is contrary to wisdom.

Also things come seeking me, carefully weighing real and false; false tests me, real relies on me; relying has good and evil, testing has refined and coarse; coarse testing breaks and crushes, refined testing declines and thanks; declining is saintly master. Good spirits test me with affairs; I have no wondrous virtue, virtue not yet full, causing test now to come; refined recognition and intention, already known and finished, no more confused heart; with this decline it, this is wisdom. Crushing are five demons and three poisons, transforming to test, not yet understanding my method, not yet believing my might, thus treating them, punishing and subduing, making them surrender. Able to overcome demon grudges, this is wisdom. Being tested frightens and confuses, wandering and lost, this is not crossing, not wise person. Not wise person falls into demon faction; able to awaken evil crowd, self-extract and emerge, exit evil and return right, right heart vow and will, firm without retreat, praise comes not joyful, slander comes not worried, solution has method, dispelling has law, placing insult and praise aside, no dust in heart, practicing correct method, Dao and virtue without laxity, slander and praise naturally cease, this is wisdom. They come to offend, offense not counted, can speak rightly, if not then stop. Secretly knowing spirit Dao, secretly abandoning offense, offense ceases by itself, no arising retribution heart, heart not harboring retribution, Dao and virtue daily flourish. Evil people hate it, cannot harm, instead suffer themselves, then pity them, mourn foolish stubbornness, not achieving pleasure; mind like this, is wisdom. All evil people, rebellious and unruly, questioning Dao and mocking virtue, cursing Heaven and insulting Earth, slandering parents, defaming masters, envying friends, slandering good people; able to tolerate, endure wrongs without anger, understand and explain without ceasing, respectful and obedient without contention, whole Dao in heart, this is wisdom. If angry and clear, speaking straight and correcting wrong, harming others to benefit self, or killing self for fame, or disregarding self, each venting anger, dying without regret, or increasing resentment and knots, not wisdom.

All evil people, fierce birds, poisonous beasts, insects, birds, stings and bites, all must be guarded against; guarding without method, shallow method not repelling; first facing deep, now merit shallow, retribution will surely come; coming not forgetting Dao, knowing is past sin, what is caused not blamed; today’s suffering, thoughts meet hatred, explain cause and condition, not generating malice, violent added; yet at first coming, light and heavy unknown, first set method, explain and wish, various releases, striving to avoid mutual harm; even if knives and sticks threaten to make retreat, must not kill or harm, greatly increasing hatred; strongly set methods, unable to repel, dividing to suffer damage, repaying past hatred, not raising retribution heart, preserving Dao seeking later eternal exemption, this is wisdom.

All clever and poor, dark and rich, kind and short-lived, slanderous and long-lived, innocent and suffering disaster, with conflict and wandering, all correspond and repay, exactly without difference; bright and clear understand, dim and stuck doubt, doubt cannot dispel, dispel cannot seek, not wisdom. Wisdom has no doubt; no doubt has recognition; recognition of thirty-six heavens and earth, bright thirty-six wondrous practices, chanting thirty-six true sounds, all demons extinguished clearly.

Three corpses extremely fierce, called three poisons, poison harming human life, urgent to remove; guarding One with focused essence, three corpses self-extinguish. One without form or image, no desire no action, hard to seek, easy to lose; loss due to dark recognition, unable to advance brightness, greed and desire stagnate heart, causing decline and aging, gaining joy losing anger, causing illness, confused not changing, causing death, death and anger and aging, three corpses prolong. Treatment and rescue preservation only first guard One, without One no help, without One no success; guarding One calm and peaceful, even heart silent seeking, reducing desire suppressing virtue, reversing confusion entering right, vast and effortless, united with One as One; this is supreme person, first body active cause. Middle and above, first good not accumulated, accumulated not extreme, all due to gradual rise; must preserve three origins, truly recognize spirit qi, form and name, entering and exiting existence and nonexistence, governing and guarding three palaces, three corpses must fall, three origins also wondrous, not to be immediately expanded, must diligently do good, five virtues fully cultivate, myriad good daily accumulate, thousand demons dare not interfere, corpse poison gone, refining dark into bright, wisdom and spirit power, long life and no death.

Holy true immortals, according to cause receive effect, ascend mysterious transformation world, follow fate come and go, self-measuring and measuring others, observing body and things, all have proof and verification, carefully examining, if wrong then repent, if right then firmly act, fasting and quiet preserving thought, wearing and carrying medicine and talismans, chapters expressing repentance and vows, doubt true no false, no greed no desire, not declining not aging, old returns to infant, body and spirit shining, no joy no anger, no illness no calamity, calamity passed illness removed, qi power strong, no confusion no jealousy, not dying not perishing, perishing not perishing, right view no evil, self-communicating with all, united with Dao as One, One united as One, called holy true immortals.

Desires cannot be few, decline cannot be removed, anger cannot be dispelled, illness cannot be lessened, foolishness cannot be moved, death cannot be escaped, empty claims of learning Dao all false. False and vain people ultimately fall into demon faction, causing worldly conditions, falsely claiming names, sometimes calling Supreme One, sometimes naming holy true, falsely assuming gods and immortals, confusing all; if not true learning, who can correct? Transform evil and preserve right, guard One and illuminate three, act five and complete six, six penetrations people, no falsehood, movement and stillness all true, though having expedient transformation, ultimately use true Dao.

True Dao’s work, no sorrow no illness, no death long life, teaching tirelessly, ancient and modern classics, glance and understand, illuminating truth and falsehood, clarifying excess and deficiency, penetrating refined and coarse, governing and explaining, clear and resolving doubt, applying scripture, solemn and efficacious, speaking without flaw, writing without burden, clear talk moves heaven, spreading text bright and shining, pen falling forming chapters, preface praising mysterious extreme, sometimes scripture or transmission, sometimes precept or rule, sometimes lament or hymn, sometimes decree or petition, sometimes words or document, sometimes chapter or memorial, sometimes repentance or vow, sometimes secret or talisman, sometimes record or register, sometimes few or many, sometimes complex or simple, sometimes plain or ornate, sometimes literary or plain, sometimes shallow or deep, teaching according to place, acting and hiding different, appearing and disappearing distinct. Sometimes first separate then unite, sometimes first unite then separate, separating evil and uniting good, good is Dao’s foundation. Words appearing in chapters, having separation and change, having overflow and benefit, each appropriate.

One who penetrates all, hundred words not cured; two penetrations, thousand words not changed; three penetrations, ten thousand words not mysterious; four penetrations, hundred thousand not easy; five penetrations, million not bound; six penetrations, ten million not pointed; beyond this, responses endless. Not these six people, cannot compose or compile, cannot emulate and narrate ancient sages, all must be verified and cited, former sages’ instructions and admonitions, careful not to act rashly, speaking from chest and mind, speaking heart not reaching, not entering correct law, all called evil text, soon self-extinguishing, soon spreading, only these six people, flowing and spreading endlessly, sometimes hidden sometimes manifest, never perishing. Later learners carefully study this meaning, realizing not yet same as six, do not forcibly write, wasting heart and strength, mocked by humans and ghosts, offending mysterious spirits, then suffering severe torment, wind blades and pain, enduring kalpas without origin. Do not seek vain fame, lightly shedding false works, false makers are fierce, all must be cautious.

All beneficial and non-beneficial actions, advantageous and disadvantageous actions, action and non-action, action and non-self, self is not self, self is for things, action is for things, having action not action, non-action’s action, action of non-action, no arising slander, slander not harming self, they invite disaster, disaster adds to them, pain and sorrow, thoughts and blessings, neither joyful nor indulgent, not indulgent nor joyful, saving to the utmost, utmost cannot save, saving not them capable, this is always auspicious, they fall into misfortune, misfortune not this, this auspicious not sought, not sought self-arrives, self-arrives not misfortune, naturally auspicious, not knowing this auspicious, not wise person.

Others angry at me, I angry at them, though not repaying anger, not guarding carefully, sitting with deep sin, bringing heavy disaster, heavy disaster comes, comes unaware, dark allowing passage, disaster prolonged unmeasured, not able to avoid, not wise. Able to teach others, teaching benefits others, self benefits and others benefit, do not benefit uselessly, benefiting nothing is loss, loss false benefit true. True men teach others, not selfishly keeping to self, self good helps others, others good same as self, self and others same good, good practiced enters truth, true Dao accomplished, slander and insult do not come, come not harm, judging no doubt, doubt not wisdom. Rumors and slanders, not turning or reversing, skillful explanation, joyful and not angry, they and I happily, doubts and reproaches disperse, letting nature be, not caring to remove others, though meeting in middle straight, not able to embrace and expand, biased beauty harms, not wisdom. Not wise people, demons test daily, no way to obtain thirty-six mushrooms, no fate for thirty-six appearances, cannot produce eighty-one excellences, demons not dispelled, might and spirit not complete, Dao field not rashly entered, entering Dao dispelling demons, first set wisdom. Azure Youth bows and complies.

### Scroll Five of The True Scripture of the Supreme Cavernal One on Wisdom and the Dispelling of Demons

**The Chapter on Transformation**

The Supreme One said to the Jade Palace Emperor: “Myriad beings have feelings, feelings must have responses. Evil is originally present, present but not extreme; though there is slight good, good is not wondrous good. Thinking evil, evil responds; originally present with mutual attraction. Good is originally absent, absent but not yet; abandoning coarse evil, thinking this wondrous good, wondrous good responds; originally absent now arising. Originally absent is Dao, Dao responds only good; good has great and small, all not evil. Originally present is vulgar, vulgar responds only evil; evil has great and small, all not good. Therefore for evil, though Dao saves it, severely confused do not return; not returning thus falling into evil, not wisdom can do anything. For good, though vulgar attacks it, firm and upright do not harbor, not harboring thus becoming good; this wisdom can cultivate and establish. Cultivating and establishing with One, One births yin and yang, great harmony spreads qi, containing essence nourishing spirit, spirit qi most wondrous, without beginning or end, without limit or shore, without top or bottom, without middle, without place, everywhere has, cannot know, knowing is wisdom, supreme person. Supreme person embodies this wondrous wisdom, clearly guards One, uses without fullness, deep and vast master, traces respond with portion, following gain and loss, thus have great and small wisdom.

Why?
