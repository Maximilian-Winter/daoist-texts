## Scripture of the Primordial Emergence of the Azure Teeth, Most High of the Cavern of Truth

### The Treasure Chart of Cultivating the Five Births

The Azure Teeth Primordial Emergence was cultivated by the Queen Mother of the West and transmitted to Master Gu Xi, the Yellow Child True Man of the Great Valley. The Supreme Ultimate True Man sealed One Passage upon Mount Dai, passing down through three transmissions over seven thousand years. There is a mysterious name, the Purple Tablet. Whoever obtains this text within a hundred years, also may receive the three transmissions. Cultivate for five years: the Three Corpses are extinguished, the Five Spirits are peacefully settled, the Five Emperors commune, and one roams freely among the Three Purities.

### The Five Directions of the Azure Teeth

**East Azure Teeth**: The primordial image is the Blue Heaven; at its center is the Year Star; its flow is the Wood Essence; below lies Mount Tai, guardian of the human Liver Palace. Its qi begins to arise like the first sprouts of spring grass; its light bursts forth like the sun’s radiant beams. Two beings jointly swallow it, becoming one with the spirit.

**South Vermilion Teeth**: The primordial image is the Red Heaven; at its center is the Blazing Star; its flow is the Fire Essence; below stands Mount Henghuo, guardian of the human Heart Palace. Its qi begins to arise, like crimson clouds enveloping the white sun; its light shines forth like black jade reflecting a scarlet abyss. Two beings jointly swallow it, becoming one with the spirit.

**Center Yellow Teeth**: The primordial image is the Yellow Heaven; at its center is the Stabilizing Star; its flow is the Earth Essence; below towers Mount Songgao, guardian of the human Spleen Palace. Its qi is like yellow gauze wrapping red clouds; its light like purple smoke enveloping the setting sun. Two beings jointly swallow it, becoming one with the spirit.

**West White Teeth**: The primordial image is the White Heaven; at its center is the Great White Star; its flow is the Metal Essence; below rises Mount Hua, guardian of the human Lung Palace. Its qi is like bright clouds entwining the full moon; its light like a luminous pearl seen in the dark night. Two beings jointly swallow it, becoming one with the spirit.

**North Black Teeth**: The primordial image is the Black Heaven; at its center is the Celestial Star; its flow is the Water Essence; below stands Mount Heng, guardian of the human Kidney Palace. Its qi is like white smoke curling around jade trees; its light like a shooting star rushing across vast waves. Two beings jointly swallow it, becoming one with the spirit.

### On the Timing of the Primordial Emergence

Boys and girls under the age of twelve may know of it but should not yet practice it. Above twelve years, knowing and practicing it without illicit union is called the Primordial Emergence. Above fifteen years, all are considered late. Late knowledge often means damage has already been done; repairing and restoring is exceedingly difficult. Even if one does not engage in illicit union, late knowledge of the path is still late. Late emergence may still be extended, but cannot be called the Primordial Emergence.

If one has engaged in illicit union before knowing the path of emergence, one must first fast and offer thanks, following the prescribed rites and timing. Without knowing the method of thanks, one may not receive or partake of the Scripture of Primordial Emergence. Those who receive it shall not die; those who truly obtain it shall live. The living ones jointly swallow the Five Qi, the Five Viscera bloom with splendor, the Five Spirits rejoice, the Five Stars flow and spread, the Five Elders descend in numinous power, journeying together among the Five Sacred Mountains, feasting above the Five Heavens—long life without death, preserving the perfected immortals.

Those whose essence is damaged may not receive the Scripture of Primordial Emergence, may not swallow the Azure Teeth Qi, nor absorb the Five-Colored Fluids. Though they practice many methods, they will never repair themselves. Repairing is not yet possible; whence then shall the Way be summoned?

### To the Like-Minded

Those who share this spirit, diligently cultivating the Five Virtues and faithfully ingesting the Five Teeth every dawn without fail, may indeed proceed toward the Five Kings. Within no more than five years, their rank ascends to Immortal Sage. The Five Emperors serve as their mission, feathered steeds and cloud chariots arriving day and night to welcome them. They roam at ease, their fate not yet ascending to the mysterious, their traces not yet sunk into obscurity. They walk and transform the world, entering and exiting without hindrance. Slanderers suffer their own calamity; offenders incur their own guilt. Evil men and fierce demons cannot destroy them; the more they are insulted, the purer they become; the more they are concealed, the brighter they shine. Their grace and virtue flow forth, Heaven and humanity look up and revere them.
