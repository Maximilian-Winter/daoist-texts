## Scripture of the Numinous Truth of the Most High’s Elixir Vision Dao Essence

Master Gu of Tai Valley, the Yellow Child Perfected, Gu Xizi transmitted this to me. I received it and faithfully practiced it, establishing a lineage within Mount Dai, distinct yet akin to the famed Eight Techniques of the Hidden Earth. The Eight Techniques, eight names, are stored within a jade casket, sealed with a golden seal, attended by jade youths, guarded by jade maidens—each numbering eight hundred. The Jade Morning was bestowed upon the Nine Profound Ones, passed down through seven thousand years before reaching me. This Elixir Vision, too, bears two names: one, the Scripture of the Most High’s Elixir Vision Dao Essence; the other, the *Tai Su San Yuan Qu Su Jue Ci Yu Jing Nei Zhen Jin Zhang*—“Great Primordial Three Origins Curved Elemental Formula Words of the Jade Radiance’s Inner True Golden Seal,” also known as *You Le Hui Ci*, sharing the name but differing in reality. Within seven thousand years, only three transmissions are permitted; within a hundred years, those who possess it may also receive three transmissions, each granted two jade youths and two jade maidens.

Yet the *Curved Elemental Formula Words of the Inner True Golden Seal* is the ultimate chapter of the Emperor of Void, the treasured words of the Great Primordial Three Origins Sovereign. Smoke arises weaving patterns, jade waves shimmer in emptiness, wandering true caverns within curved discourse, elemental formulas glowing within the golden chamber. Thus it can dispel the six heavens at the origin of the three transformations, summon the five spirits amid the seven revolutions, command one array of three principles so that numinous immortals descend to rest, turn seven transformations and five principles to respond to summons without measure, revere the two honored ones in the quiet pavilion, and awaken elemental wisdom within the cold spirit. Hereupon, mountain and marshes pay homage to the essence, water sources lie subdued and extinguished, a thousand demons are simultaneously executed, nine devils fall and vanish, five hundred are opened within the golden seal, Fenghua is summoned to the imperial throne. Then the jade radiance rests in its chamber, the Five Elders chant in unison, divine troops bind demons, evil smoke is utterly silenced, the Seven Ancestors are drawn from the Southern Palace, receive their form and embryo at dawn’s first light, pay homage to the Most High at the floral palace, visit the Great Primordial at the western court, transcend the five ranks within the imperial household, exhaust the two polarities without withering. Thus this supreme truth’s exalted chapter is the place where demons are summoned and subdued. Following the system of the Four Poles’ luminous regulations, it is allowed to be transmitted twice within five hundred years.

Those who can recite the *Curved Elemental Formula Words* within the quiet chamber of rest shall see the Five Elders’ guests at the morning court, the Jade Radiance’s maidens descend at evening, guarded by the literary and martial attendants to ward off misfortune. The spirits of source and marsh all come to pay homage, the true numinous of the Five Mountains bow their heads and advance. If one wishes to command or summon, one must perform the seven turns and five transformations. First, correct the heart facing north, preserve reverence for the Great Primordial Three Origins Sovereign in the golden flower palace, then also pay homage to the Most High Jade Morning Sovereign in the chamber of seven reflections. These two honored sovereigns, jade and elegant in their ethereal clarity, golden in form and shining like the sacred spirit fungus, their round radiance flourishing in the splendid chamber, dazzling and flashing through the eight mysteries. Once reverence is complete, knock the teeth twelve times to open the twelve passages, first recite the Golden Truth blessing three times, then read the highest grade’s fourth chapter, next the second chapter, then the sixth chapter, then the third chapter, then the fifth chapter, and finally the seventh chapter. The upper and middle two grades combined make fourteen chapters—all completed. Then focus the mind on the summoned, and according to the heart’s will, they will arrive. Request the summoning of the Five Mountains’ divine spirits, as well as the Controllers of Fate and Records, the Northern Emperor and the Three Officials, commanding them to erase the record of sins, carve the name of the living, strike down the smoke and qi of evil demons, sever and block the root source of testing and observation. When the commands are finished, dispatch them carefully—do not detain them long. Within one month, perform this dao three times. If one only wishes to drive away misfortune and suppress demons and monsters, one must not proceed lightly or hastily. First read the middle grade’s third chapter, then the highest grade’s second chapter, then the middle grade’s seventh chapter, then the middle grade’s fourth chapter, then the highest grade’s sixth chapter, and again recite the Golden Truth spell three times. This is called the Way of the Five Transformations, to summon and subdue demons and ghosts. When performed alone, no further reverence is needed. If one wishes to redeem the sins of the Seven Ancestors and extract the birth palace at the imperial sovereign, one must first preserve reverence as above, then proceed from the scripture’s highest grade first chapter, turning it three times, each time followed by a reading of the Golden Truth blessing. Within one day, perform this three times, up to five hundred times, to complete one grade; continue to five hundred grades, and the Seven Ancestors’ embryonic immortals ascend to the Three Heavens. When reciting the scripture, take care not to err in the chapter words; ten errors require a penalty of one grade.

Those who wish to undertake great grade passages must first fast for three hundred days, bathe in five fragrant herbs, wear pure and clean garments, sever worldly ties, and calm the mind without concern or thought—only then may they proceed with practice.
