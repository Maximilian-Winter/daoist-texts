## Hymns and Verses of the Supreme Clarity’s Perfected Ones

### Supreme Clarity’s Steps of Emptiness Three Contracts Hymn

Before beginning, the cavernous void without origin,  
Three black essences guard the upper gate.  
Purple wings blaze within the vastness of the Great Void,  
Four luminaries plant the roots of spirit.

Marvelous transformations arise in the Eastern Jade,  
Three conveniences open the Western Kun.  
Brightly shining, the Nine Profound Essences glow,  
Five blossoms adorn the brocade clouds.

The netted veil kindles the divine lamp,  
Seven stars radiate the Northern Primordial.  
Drifting upward to the sacred domain of the Dao,  
Flapping wings honor the sole august Sovereign.

Lofty and serene, the exalted hymn resounds,  
Feathered youths flutter in a lively throng.  
Flowing fragrance, originally colorless,  
Suddenly enters the myriad immortal hosts.

Leftward turns the three streams of kalpas,  
Rightward spins the ten thousand-arrow pass.  
Cloud blossoms tassel the fivefold clouds,  
Eight phoenixes dance the empty wheel.

The four seasons never cease their machinery,  
Blue and white divide the early dawn.  
Ninety-nine times the kalpa’s cycle changes,  
Three threes make one final reckoning.

Heaven and Earth have their destined meeting,  
The turning point returns to the banner.  
Cavernous clarity holds the orthodox One method,  
Solemnly concluding the six heavenly patterns.

Great Peace returns to emptiness,  
Serving the winged Later Sage Sovereign.  
Spiritual winds rise at the Western Gate,  
Brocade clouds are born in the Eastern Jade.

Two energies blaze upon the Jade Isle,  
Flowing fragrance rides the light smoke.  
Five blossoms scatter upon the wind,  
Suddenly brightening the Nine Pure Realms.

The soaring forest shines with the vermilion sun,  
Yellow blossoms chase the rising moon.  
Within dwells the child gathering spirit herbs,  
Clad in feathers, bearing flying azure.

Scenery of myriad mountain peaks,  
Carefree feasting in the green pavilion.  
Mastering the transport of the Nine Voids,  
Opening the path without measure or limit.

Left commands the three heavenly patterns,  
Right controls the six heavenly soldiers.  
Inspecting the energies and cavernous hollows,  
Heaven’s measure responds as fate tips.

Kalpa cycles have their appointed meetings,  
Who can sway defeat or success?  
Vast waves engulf the cloud’s threads,  
The six directions leave no form behind.

White corpses drift in the long flow,  
Lonely souls again scatter and vanish.  
Sorrowful at this coming and going,  
Only then does the orthodox method shine clear.

Supreme learning adds refined cultivation,  
Eastern Blossoms bind the jade name.  
Joyful are those with white bamboo slips,  
Together delighting in Great Peace.

Cavern gates turn the heavenly threads,  
Royal aura spins the three subtle realms.  
Purple portals emit jade slips,  
Golden gates receive divine radiance.

Eight assemblies mingle true winds,  
Bright and clear, the double darkness opens.  
Beyond the heavens and Nine Purities,  
Lofty and serene, the morning returns.

Three colors return to emptiness,  
Four seasons respond to the jade domain.  
The river awaits the drum’s beat,  
The Five Phases secretly push and pull.

Six degrees without final kalpa,  
The cycle’s peak rides the energy home.  
Ten thousand demons spread across heaven,  
Hostile fiends compete in their might.

Countless people bear calamities and shocks,  
Accumulated corpses bring sorrow to hearts.  
Marvelous indeed is the orthodox text,  
Treading the kalpa, bright and unwaning.

At the appointed time, mutually receiving,  
Contracts lie at the Nine Heavens’ gates.  
With you we await Great Peace,  
Releasing the body to fly without wings.

### Supreme Clarity’s Whirling Praise

The Great Dao’s cavernous profundity is subtle,  
The high void encompasses the three wheels.  
Golden immortals open the spiritual gates,  
Radiant as if a fragment of the Nine Heavens.

Great Splendor scatters the purple void,  
Eight perfected beings reflect the pure clouds.  
Mysterious Mother forms the supreme vow,  
The Eight Gates of the journey’s simplicity.

Myriad celebrations join the spiritual assembly,  
Raising smoke, chanting the Origin Below.  
Marvelous chanting stirs the void,  
Binding the assembly of high immortals.

Whirling and circling, worship the empty cavern,  
Bowing heads to salute the august Sovereign.

### Steps of Emptiness Wisdom and Joy Incantation

Bind my natural breath,  
Condense and transform the Purple Phoenix City.  
High terraces surpass the Nine Ranges,  
Lofty and splendid, forming flying jade.

Radiant descending upon the layered void,  
Winding through the Eight Pure Caverns.  
Purple canopy shines upon the cloud palace,  
Flowing brilliance veils the five spirits.

Reaching the boundless wilds,  
Eight energies revolve in perfect brightness.  
Riding the soaring wind through the Great Void,  
Seven scenes turn the heavenly classic.

The coming cycle seems without form,  
The departing time follows transformation’s fall.  
Nine circles intersect within the measure,  
Two images mutually contest.

The One Sovereign firmly holds the central origin,  
Four threads do not collapse the spirit.  
South gathers the flying imperial treasure,  
North arrays the vast cold court.

Mysterious chamber joins the true assembly,  
Empty songs arise naturally.  
Five Emperors command spiritual banners,  
Demonic flags march against myriad essences.

Demons howl from the void,  
The Dao world’s joy never ends.  
Thus arises the winding plain chant,  
Celebrating the gods, rejoicing in Great Peace.

Together, what contract do we hold?  
Ten thousand kalpas are but one lifespan.  
Turning through ninety thousand kalpas,  
Together roaming the Purple Phoenix Pavilion.

The void births the Purple Phoenix Platform,  
Jade palaces join the Great Subtle.  
Spiritual winds pierce the Eight Assemblies,  
Northern windows open the palace gates.

Above, the howling singing child,  
Always chanting of decline and loss.  
At dawn rides the scene in joy,  
At dusk attaches to the scene’s return.

Two scenes united as one body,  
Always fearing the loss of radiant light.  
Nine energies do not dwell constantly,  
Heaven and Earth face perilous tipping.

Great kalpa ends in one reckoning,  
One hundred and six cycles return.  
Flood springs surge through the Nine Ranges,  
Great Crow soars, skyward hanging.

Ten thousand creatures drift in the long flow,  
Turning to mountains with no place to rest.  
Wailing without boundary,  
How can one not grieve in heart?

Sages and saints diligently chant scriptures,  
Thus able to ride the scene and fly.  
At the appointed time mutually receiving,  
Together gathering at the Nine Heavens’ gates.

Numbers end at the Golden Horse time,  
Ten thousand terrors cross and race.  
No sight of those learning immortality,  
Only able to weep over the dead.

Alas, this foolish mortal nature,  
Holding life with pain and sorrow.

### Cavernous Truth’s Returning Whirl Verse

The Most High unfolds the mysterious essence,  
Radiant and splendid, the numberless true texts.  
Lofty and scattered, the heavenly reality,  
Respected by all in the Ten Directions.

No beginning nor end,  
No brightness nor darkness.  
Looking up, ascending the Jade Capital Platform,  
Carefree resting on Kunlun.

Transcending the spring’s winding path,  
The demon king leads the desires to hear.  
Seven ancestors receive transformation and birth,  
Resolving my past life’s grievances.

Entering to control the flying mysterious light,  
Emerging to ride the floating purple clouds.

Double brilliance shines on the Jade Morning,  
Mysterious light opens the perfect brightness.  
Distant and profound is the Cavernous Truth Hall,  
Shining with the essence of seven treasures.

One thought crosses the eight hardships,  
Forever alongside the Most High.  
Spinning and offering the yellow light,  
Sunlight born within the void.

The world knows the mixed mundane ways,  
But none hear the scripture of wisdom.  
Great indeed is the true admonition,  
Mysterious awe moves the demon king sincerely.

Ten thousand springs are but one breath,  
How could they strike a thousand hundred million kalpas?

The Most High’s essence is originally none,  
Scattering form to transcend weakness and loss.  
Striving to proclaim the mysterious arts,  
Heavenly Venerables together praise and extol.

Those with affinity reveal the text,  
No cause to hide it in scriptures.  
If one can obtain this dao,  
First will be born the perfect light.

The body squeezes without awaiting a ferry,  
Taking office in the immortal hall.

No nothing, no end, no eternity,  
Having, having, peacefully entering the marvelous.  
Heavenly writings flourish unsurpassed,  
The mysterious lineage has its essentials.

Turning the three treasure wheels,  
The Ten Directions universally tremble and shine.  
The Most High views the Jade Capital,  
The demon king laughs in the void.

Heavenly Emperor clasps hands and sings,  
All perfected beings ride the void and howl.  
Scattering blossoms is my true thought,  
Eight vows naturally transcend.

Spiritual immortals ride the celebratory dawn,  
Driving dragons treading the mysterious waves.  
Joining truth to express auspicious signs,  
Washing feet at the human-heaven border.

Blessings come unbidden,  
Thus releasing the heavenly net.  
Dao and virtue crown the Three Realms,  
The earthly threads have also passed.

Encountering the cloud of perfected assembly,  
Pure wisdom scriptures like lotus flowers.

Supreme awakening of the four ranks,  
Vast beyond the Nine Heavens.  
Hidden and manifest surely have cause,  
No hidden means no darkness.

Swiftly turning the mysterious wheel,  
True immortals favor the azure expanse.  
Wandering in the vastness,  
Heaven and humans have no boundary.

Spiritual marvels entrusted to proclamation,  
Heaven and humans have ferry shores.  
Boating the unfathomable abyss,  
Always fearing wind and waves’ change.

Its cause has wondrous methods,  
Who can calculate wisdom’s power?  
Slowly drifting in the mysterious blue,  
Clearly the dark cause is judged.

Outstandingly responding to the true child,  
Spirit zithers play in the void.  
Sincere thoughts respectfully face the Ten Directions,  
Mysterious dwelling does not envy me.

The Most High spreads the cavernous text,  
Virtuous ones return to original affinity.  
Desolate is the Three Treasures’ enclosure,  
Flourishing is my cause.

Elder historians enter the essence,  
Pure substance births golden body.  
End kalpa returns to beginning kalpa,  
Spirit face feels ever new.

Rare to cross the supreme ritual,  
Treasure texts descend to the true.  
Dao forest flourishes in the heavenly capital,  
Illuminating all earthly immortals.

Calmly scattering spiritual might,  
Vastly proclaiming the great method.

The Most High views the Ten Directions,  
Dark and solemn, blending wind and reverence.  
Perfect light reflects the three stars,  
True beings don heavenly robes.

Demon king clasps hands standing,  
Governing the market beside Feng Capital.  
Sun and moon veil their shining,  
Seven treasures blaze infinitely.

All prepare at this time,  
Disasters vanish, hells cease.  
Vast and trustworthy is the sky without form,  
Honored ones no one can measure.

Three treasures flourish in the Ten Directions,  
Busy and clear in the void.  
Winding and turning following transformation’s principle,  
One feeling transmits the dharma’s ascent.

Vast and obscure in the dark space,  
The four great elements rise with time.  
Void and existence, none not present,  
Towering are many mountain cliffs.

The Most High has no lingering thought,  
Extinguishing thought returns to the great vehicle.

### Ten Directions Returning Mysterious Worship Hymns

Beginning with the North, then Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, Above, and Below.  
One hymn, one bow each.  
Those who recite the Returning Mysterious Hymns rise naturally and spontaneously, standing empty for over nine thousand kalpas, their text then revealed.  
The Primordial Heavenly King studied the Dao from the Most High; after the Dao was established, the Most High commanded the Primordial Heavenly King to compile this grand admonition.  
On one’s life day, recite the three hundred divisions of the admonition and then chant this hymn.  
If at noon or midnight, first purify, then practice the Dao.  
If one does not know one’s life day, use the sexagenary cycle day.  
After ten years, one may correct to the first day of the first month to practice the Dao.

### Twelve Golden Chapters

Feasting at the Great Rosy Clouds Palace,  
Golden gates shine with purple clarity.  
Immortal chambers reflect the Great Simplicity,  
Four pavilions all adorned with vermilion jade.

Casting wheels at the empty cavern ferry,  
Reining steeds dance the green pavilion.  
Jade blossoms fly the cloud canopy,  
Western consorts carry brocade banners.

Suddenly beyond dust and filth,  
Swiftly entering the beautiful courtyard.  
Past karmic responses summon arrival,  
What is gained already lies in the dark.

Riding the wind imagining the Nine Heavens,  
Together reveling in the elixir infant.  
Turning from the world’s things,  
How could one know the spirit within the void?

North ascends the Mysterious Darkness Gate,  
Hand in hand passing the high net.  
Fragrant smoke scatters the eight scenes,  
Mysterious winds drum the crimson waves.

Looking up to the resounding ferry,  
Looking down at the winding mountain’s nook.  
Howling songs rise above the clouds,  
Phoenix cries pierce the Nine Rosy Clouds.

Riding the energy floating in the Great Void,  
Why ascend the mountain’s nook?  
Golden tokens command feathered spirits,  
Leading soldiers to crush ten thousand demons.

Rinsing breath in the perfect morning light,  
Ten thousand springs just budding.  
In a whirl of competition,  
Not understanding what to do.

Northern ridges lush with sky mists,  
Crimson trees bear purple blossoms.  
Blue stamens fall in the phoenix forest,  
Jade leaves adorn the elegant mountain nook.

Spirit palaces soar in the Great Void,  
Jade chambers join the Great Rosy Clouds.  
Clouds rise within the winding chamber,  
Eight winds fly the dark sands.

Nine mysteries play the emperor’s pond,  
Dragons roar singing the rhythmic harmony.  
Fan winds sweep the Five Mountain ridges,  
Grasping tokens to conquer ten thousand demons.

Gazing in a moment’s instant,  
Suddenly springs have passed.  
Alas, those born at dawn,  
How know the length of their days?

Corner scenes spread the forest palace,  
The cycle’s axle rushes through the dark wilderness.  
Highest views reflect the six courts,  
Great and small all roam carefree.

Dragon’s breath entwines the canopy clouds,  
Tiger’s roar startles ten thousand branches.  
Three plain colors open the high map,  
Rosy clouds flourish in the morning sky.

Feathered banners cross the spirit ferry,  
Purple pavilion flies with splendid peaks.  
Reining steeds beyond the Nine Heavens,  
Looking up and down in vast solitude.

Dust punishment binds noisy filth,  
Spirit lost, energy also withers.  
Why not seek far away protection,  
Eight thousand years make one morning.

At dawn crossing the blue sea waves,  
Flying wheels leave the green chamber.  
Singing loudly with companions,  
Covering the vast Canglang waters.

Three contracts with jade heaven guests,  
Five periods with Eastern Blossom youths.  
Feathered winds rise at the imperial dawn,  
Feasting here in the Vast Cold Palace.

Eight sounds played in the void,  
Purple phoenix sings the spiritual wind.  
Crimson clouds block the bright light,  
Eight scenes fly through the Great Void.

Chewing the jade spring ferry,  
Vast elegance returns to the infant’s veil.  
Supreme joy returns to the five spirits,  
Years accumulate, kalpa blades rise.

Shedding shoes, what difficulty?  
Labor and sorrow lost in the heavens.

### Morning Journey at Dawn’s Radiance

Loose reins, issuing purple clarity,  
Floating wheels gallop the Great Rosy Clouds,  
Raising canopies in the Vast Cold Court.

High perfected beings guard the emperor’s chamber,  
Palace walls lead the four spirits.  
Ten perfections dance the empty cavern,  
Flying smoke circles the brocade screen.

Tiger fans the divine wind’s celebration,  
Purple clouds return with dragon pairs.  
Swiftly looking to the eight directions,  
One glance and the kalpa has tipped.

Desolate are the mysterious competitors,  
Why not seek the Great Birth?

Spirit gardens flourish with hidden spirit herbs,  
Kun pond irrigates the watching fields.  
Looking up at the Jade Pure Gate,  
Lofty and towering over the crimson ferry.

Purple clouds reflect the winding seat,  
Five clouds shine the Nine Profound.  
Eight winds rise in the utmost cosmos,  
Dark mists between the green pavilion.

Three origins dwell in the Western Palace,  
Eastern Blossom has beautiful maidens.  
Northern Darkness chants seven howls,  
Bright Concubine sings the Southern True.

Playing the jade bell and crimson strings,  
Jade tokens raise the six strings.  
Harmonizing contracts, not a false movement,  
Together sounding atop the broad phoenix peak.

Simultaneously commanding ten thousand demons,  
Dwelling here with the black thousand.  
Transcending, coming is no difficulty,  
Thus opening the endless years.

Riding energy through the cavernous hollow,  
Riding the scene, resting in the Nine Heavens.  
Cavernous gloom spreads broad brilliance,  
Mysterious canopy born without interval.

Eight smokes whirl the lonely wheel,  
Tracks halt, not allowing years.  
Playing the jade bell in eight voids,  
My horse also has no ferry.

Grasping tokens entering Eastern Blossom,  
Evening feasting on the mysterious garden peak.  
Tying belts and carrying five spirits,  
Loosening collars, raising fine companions.

Dark feelings suit the appointed time,  
Floating freely also has affinity.  
Together bearing swift wings,  
One fan stirs billions.

Crimson scenes float the mysterious dawn,  
Purple pavilions ride clouds to journey.  
Looking up beyond the Golden Gate,  
Looking down at the Western Blossom city.

Eastern Blossom opens the five radiances,  
Divine light shines the seven spirits.  
Veiling and reflecting three spreading candles,  
Flowing freely, naturally equal in darkness.

Wind drums the empty cavernous cosmos,  
Fragrant smoke scatters the jade court.  
Hand in hand with the Weaver Maiden dance,  
Twin collars fall upon brocade blue.

Original returning joins feathered banners,  
Brocade canopies tilt with clouds.  
Feasting and resting beyond the nine degrees,  
Right and wrong do not concern me.

Embracing emptiness within the mud pellet,  
Heavenly form grows more infantile each day.  
How could it be compared with cavernous faults and filth,  
Where misery and boredom are born?

Supporting mulberry’s emerald sky peak,  
Vermilion cloud blossoms faintly bright.  
Wave terraces have the void above,  
Four views reflect clear heights.

Flying scenes control the purple wheel,  
Three plain colors rein the vermilion pavilion.  
Resting in the Great Emperor’s hall,  
Lofty and towering is the mother’s courtyard.

Washing feet in the blue stream waves,  
Holding contracts with jade sweet wine jars.  
Morning chants ride the wind’s fan,  
Drifting and tilting with the times.

Temporarily dwelling in the forest’s mists,  
Turning reins to the good true.  
Mysterious assemblies mutually essential,  
Wandering freely in the dark.

Only then knowing honor and disgrace are bitter,  
Only then realizing the urgency of life.

### The Chamber of Song for Quietude

Nourishing spirit waiting for the day’s completion,  
Why speak of the muddy path?  
Hundreds of ailments arise from here.

Heaven’s court births golden blossoms,  
Within to manifest yin and evil.  
Jade valley joins the mysterious village,  
Jade energy mutually supports the net.

Heavenly truth stands in the distant sun,  
Flying medicines spit spiritual sands.  
Clear morning inspects the heavenly horse,  
Turning reins to the mysterious divine home.

Immortals come entering the chamber,  
Also to extinguish a hundred evils.

The Dao begins with purification,  
Diligently practicing to ascend the Golden Gate.  
Thus establishing the great dharma bridge,  
Universally ferrying all beings.

Repaying past life’s grace and virtue,  
Dao heart transcends naturally.  
Six purifications honor the empty cavern,  
Ten straight spirits’ responses penetrate.

Five elders carve immortal names,  
Cloud chariots welcome and pay homage.  
Bodies fly ascending the mysterious capital,  
Seven ancestors all attain liberation.
