## The High Jade Palace’s Ode to Sorrow and Joy

Bind my natural breath, condense and transform the Purple Phoenix City.  
A lofty terrace soars beyond the Nine Ridges,  
Jagged peaks rise like flying jade.  
Radiance descends upon the heavy void above,  
Winding paths delve into the Eight Purities.  
The Purple Canopy shines over the Cloud Palace,  
Flowing brilliance veils the Five Spirits.  
Four directions reach into boundless wilds,  
Eight airs revolve in perfect clarity.  
Soaring whirlwinds traverse the vast emptiness,  
Seven lights turn the celestial scriptures.  
When fate comes, it seems without form,  
When time departs, it follows transformation’s tilt.  
Within the nine enclosures’ crossing,  
Two images mutually contest and respond.  
The One Emperor firmly holds the Central Origin,  
The Four Principles do not falter in their potency.  
From the south, the Flying Sovereign’s treasures are gathered,  
To the north, the Vast Cold Court is arrayed.  
The Mysterious Chamber joins the True Assembly,  
Empty songs arise naturally.  
The Five Emperors command the numinous banners,  
The demon flags summon myriad spirits.  
Demons howl from the empty sky,  
Yet the Dao world’s joy never ends.  
Thus arises the *Qu Su* verses,  
Celebrating the gods’ delight in great peace.  
Together we covenant how long?  
Ten thousand kalpas count as but one lifespan.  
Turning through ninety thousand kalpas,  
We journey together on the Purple Phoenix’s palanquin.

The void births the Purple Phoenix Terrace,  
Jade towers join the Great Subtlety.  
The numinous wind pierces the Eight Assemblies,  
The northern window of the Jade Gate opens wide.  
Above, a howling singing boy,  
Always chanting of fate’s decline and decay.  
At dawn, he rides the light in roaming,  
At dusk, he clings to the light’s return.  
Two lights unite as one body,  
Always fearing the loss of their radiant glow.  
The nine breaths do not dwell constantly,  
Heaven and earth face perilous tipping.  
The great kalpa ends a single cycle,  
One hundred and sixty rotations of fate return.  
The vast spring surges through the Nine Ridges,  
A great crow soars, hanging from the sky.  
Countless creatures drift in endless flow,  
Turning to the mountains but finding no refuge.  
Wailing without limit’s edge,  
How can one not grieve in the heart?  
The sages and sages diligently chant the scriptures,  
Thus able to ride the light and fly.  
When the time comes, they receive and welcome,  
Gathering at the Nine Heavens’ gates.  
The stars of the Golden Horse run their course,  
Ten thousand plagues rush wildly.  
No awakened immortals appear,  
Only the crying of corpses is heard.  
Alas, this ignorant commoner’s nature,  
Bearing fate, pain is truly lamentable.

Disperse sorrow on the Nine Mysterious Terraces,  
Gather joy together with the vast emptiness.  
Holding covenant with the Ten Celestial Spirits,  
Laughing with the Eastern Sea’s child.  
Four directions reach the Eight Assemblies’ airs,  
Mysterious currents blow the Lang Terrace wind.  
Eyes bright in the Western Splendor Hall,  
Intent united with the Vast Cold Palace.  
Dancing beneath the Purple Phoenix,  
Desolate are the Nine Ridge peaks.  
Flowing light stretches over boundless wilds,  
Looking up, the kalpa’s blade is at hand.  
Clear songs harmonize palace tones,  
Sorrow and joy accompany each other naturally.  
Two paths harmonize in one covenant,  
Though reason opposes, they return united.  
Together delighting without end,  
Holding beginning and holding end.  
Drunkenly drinking jade pool’s sweet wine,  
Looking up, drinking the flying splendor’s nectar.  
Spirit melons feast by the river,  
Tasting like the light of sun and moon.  
Seven luminaries flow fragrant radiance,  
Such joy, how could one forget?  
The great kalpa has its final fate,  
Fate shifts and the two images topple.  
The Dragon Gate severs the Heavenly River,  
Three and five oppose and contest.  
The Red Town guards the Eastern Well,  
The Floral Canopy hides the Morning Star.  
The dark dusk dims the Eight Desolations,  
Foul airs veil the heavenly essence.  
The Three Officials hasten their control,  
The Five Mountains lose their numinous firmness.  
Ten thousand plagues rush wildly,  
The Northern Emperor leads brave demon troops.  
The Eight Principles net beyond the heavens,  
Only the holy sovereign can purify.  
Thus bind the natural breath,  
Lofty and jagged, the Ninefold City.  
High watch compassion for myriad beings,  
Sorrow and joy arise from this.  
Mysterious songs scatter the divine robes,  
Mistaken joy turns to tears falling.  
Alas, these stubborn commoners,  
Miserly with wealth, greedy for lust and fame.  
Eagerly awaiting fate’s arrival,  
Ignoring disaster as it creeps close.  
The wise and intelligent come from afar,  
Morning and night diligently chanting scriptures.  
Respecting emptiness, contemplating the profound void,  
To pass beyond endless lifespans.  
If one can seek the source of the Dao,  
The eight sections will tune the jade name.  
Will dispel the nine luminaries’ disasters,  
Granting you to see great peace.

Jade phoenix weaves the morning mists,  
The Purple Terrace shines with jade forests.  
Flowing light brushes the heavy mystery,  
Steep peaks rise over the Nine Yin.  
Purple radiance scatters cinnabar clouds,  
Flying smoke seeks each other in turn.  
Seven treasures shake jade branches,  
Spirit beasts race the cloud ridges.  
Ten thousand immortals ride the void singing,  
Divine immortals raise wondrous sounds.  
Above is the High Morning Master,  
In reverent stillness, howling and chanting.  
The Eight Assemblies naturally accommodate,  
Empty descents all fragrant with orchid and gold.  
Jade bites the endless kalpa dawn,  
Jade nectar scatters and fills the heart.  
Bright pearls sing numinous songs,  
Law’s form harmonizes with the clear zither.  
Jade verses reach the Dao’s ancestral root,  
Sorrow and joy unravel human vexations.  
Release me from endless lifespan,  
What deep delight is this?  
Natural high immortal melodies,  
How could they be matched by this humble reverence?  
Morning play in the Eastern Splendor Palace,  
Evening roam in the Western Splendor Hall.  
Taking delight in the two splendid halls,  
Yet never meeting joy itself.  
Only hear the mysterious songster,  
Whose sorrowful voice wounds the heavenly child.  
Mournful echoes flow through the cold court,  
Lamenting the world’s fate exhausted.  
Heavenly horses leap the Nine Rivers,  
Crow mother rides the flying dragon.  
Mysterious ford lacks bridge or causeway,  
Two airs separated, unable to connect.  
Climb my lofty terrace,  
Look up at the Nine Difficulties.  
Foul airs fill the Three Spirits,  
Ten thousand beings bear the disaster’s weight.  
No people remain in the Eight Regions,  
Great and small mountains collapse.  
Thinking of these who do not learn,  
Hearing scriptures as if deaf and blind.  
Together they let fate arise,  
Suddenly receiving their appointed end.  
How cruel the disaster’s time,  
Thinking of you wounds my breast.

The Purple Phoenix rides the void and flies,  
Jagged and lofty, the Nine Mysterious Peaks.  
When breath condenses, shadows appear,  
When breath disperses, spirits vanish.  
Drifting boundlessly without limit,  
Heavenly music suits my delight.  
How to compare with the Eight Assemblies’ singing,  
Matching my high immortal comrades?  
Holding covenant with the Ten Celestial Spirits,  
Feasting in my nine phoenix body.  
Ascending the Jade Capital’s towers,  
Descending to play in the Lang Wind state.  
Feathered steeds swiftly spin jade wheels,  
Purple smoke supports in empty air.  
From extreme dawn to waiting dusk,  
Together we delight without end or rest.  
Flowing light freely shifts and moves,  
A hundred million cycles complete one turn.  
Rejoice in my natural robes,  
Scatter my worldly worries.  
Without numinous spiritual treasures,  
Who can share this journey?  
Alas, within the empty cavern,  
Joy arises again, sorrow returns.  
At dawn, depart from the Boundless Ridge,  
At dusk, gaze upon the Western Hill.  
No sight of the Nine Spirit Mothers,  
Northern True Dao companions roam.  
Asking the great image’s measure,  
Two airs suddenly circle the clouds.  
Nine dragons move the Eastern Well,  
Heavenly horses rush the Western corner.  
Northern Emperor releases heavenly troops,  
Five Mountains’ mysteries align.  
Ten thousand demons already bound,  
Five Phases early in counsel.  
War and disaster spread across the heavens,  
Ten thousand beings already restrained.  
Above and below all receive the gathering,  
Eradicated without trace or stay.  
Alas, amid the five calamities,  
Fate arrives with no kinship or favor.  
Ascending the Eight Assemblies’ palace,  
Bind my companions in the dark.  
Surveying those who reach learning,  
Blessed lands mutually support.  
Abandoning home to seek my dao,  
Able to transcend your body.  
Diligently cultivate the supreme scriptures,  
When the Dao forms, it must be mutual.  
Leisurely gaze upon the Phoenix Terrace,  
Is this not a joyful journey?

Great joy gathers at the Central Origin,  
Central Origin assembles the Joy Court.  
Above are the Eight Assemblies’ airs,  
Dancing, the Purple Phoenix is born.  
Golden branches cling to jade roots,  
Seven treasures form splendid bells.  
Dragons soar the extreme peaks,  
Phoenix cries startle myriad leagues.  
No guests depart or roam,  
Only hear phoenix clouds arise.  
Palace tones harmonize naturally,  
Sounds and echoes form spontaneously.  
Mysterious songs sing wondrous melodies,  
Sorrow and joy weave into scripture.  
I and you seek each other,  
Who knows the True One’s spirit?  
Brocade clouds belt the night moon,  
Purple radiance veils flying jade.  
Three mornings stir the great brilliance,  
Seven empties shine five stars.  
Spirit banners shine with mighty light,  
Flowing smoke veils purple clarity.  
Claiming Western Splendor’s marvels,  
Yet not like the Purple Phoenix City.  
Above is the one who loosens the collar,  
One face rejoicing ten thousand lifespans.  
Together delight without final kalpa,  
Because of awakening, heaven and earth tilt.  
Spirit fate has its own limit,  
Numbers end, freedom returns to mystery.  
Coming and going follow fate’s return,  
Why bind oneself with sorrow?  
Disperse sorrow beyond the Eight Desolations,  
The great image is not crooked truth.  
Leisurely joy in the delight court,  
Who would befriend sorrow?  
The five calamities are a constant meeting,  
What harms is self-inflicted.  
Though palace tones do not harmonize,  
Ultimately reason balances all.  
Thus arises the sorrow and joy melody,  
To pass and awaken the Dao body.  
Bitter practice refines the numinous script,  
Wondrous meaning naturally fresh.  
But wearing the *Qu Su* chapter,  
One can enter the shore of no sorrow.  
Riding the void, ascending the Phoenix Terrace,  
Lofty views receive the Tang years.  
What joy will this joy bring?  
Knowing sorrow, where can it be heard?

The High Jade Palace’s Ode to Sorrow and Joy, born from the void on the Phoenix Terrace,  
Numinous brilliance shines in the Five Directions,  
Golden sounds soar clear in the Ten Heavens,  
Jade Capital’s nine melodies of the upper true ones,  
All cast in gold as slips,  
Written with purple brush,  
Voices united in singing the mysterious song of sorrow and joy.  
Its words are profound and deep,  
Wondrous and penetrating the abyss.  
None but the high and exalted peers  
Can fully comprehend its chapters.  
There is a golden name, Eastern Splendor,  
A jade title, Phoenix Gate,  
Only then can one behold this text.  
Wearing the phoenix breath’s mysterious hill true book, commanding demon spirit banners,  
Reciting the Ode to Sorrow and Joy,  
The Five Emperors guard the truth,  
Heavenly demons respectfully protect,  
Supporting the upper immortals,  
Receiving and welcoming the holy sovereign in the Shangqing Palace,  
Roaming the halls of the Phoenix Terrace.

Whoever receives this text,  
On the day of their birth, the year’s lord, the eight seasonal nodes,  
And on the fifth, fifteenth, and twenty-fifth days of each month,  
Bathing and fasting, entering the chamber,  
First facing east, recite the two chapters of the Green Emperor, then bow to jade truth,  
Turn south, recite the Red Chapter, then bow to jade truth,  
Turn west, recite the White Emperor Chapter, then bow to jade truth,  
Turn north, recite the Black Emperor Chapter, then bow to jade truth,  
Face the year’s lord, recite the Yellow Emperor Chapter, then bow to jade truth.  
When all five directions are completed, return facing north, perform nine bows,  
Face the High Jade Morning Lord, swallow breath nine times and stop.  
Thus, five offerings of the Five Emperor banners are set in the chamber’s five directions.  
From the *Shangqing High Jade Morning Phoenix Terrace Qu Su Upper Scripture*.
