## The Most High Cavernous True Profound Turning Chapter

The Most High unfolds the profound mystery,  
Radiantly spreading the true script.  
Majestic and lofty, dispersing Heaven’s treasures,  
Revered throughout the Ten Directions.  

Neither beginning nor end,  
Neither bright nor dim.  
Looking upward, ascending the Jade Capital Terrace,  
At ease, resting upon Kunlun’s heights.  

Transcending the winding springs and streams,  
The Demon King longs to hear.  
Seven Patriarchs receive transformation and birth,  
Resolving my grudges from past lives.  

Entering the control of the flying mysterious light,  
Emerging to ride the floating purple clouds.  

---

The double brilliance shines upon the jade dawn,  
The mysterious light opens the perfect clarity.  
Far, far away lies the Cavernous True Hall,  
Shimmering with the essence of seven treasures.  

With one thought, crossing the eight hardships,  
Forever alongside the Most High.  
Spinning and offering the yellow radiance,  
The sun’s brilliance born within the void.  

The world knows mixed and mundane paths,  
But none have heard the scripture of wisdom and grace.  
Great indeed is the Cavernous True precept,  
The mysterious response moves even the Demon King’s heart.  

Ten thousand pillars as one breath,  
How could they be bound to a thousand million ages?  

---

The Most High’s essence is originally non-being,  
Scattering form, transcending weakness and loss.  
Striving to proclaim the profound art,  
The Heavenly Venerable likewise praises and extols.  

Those with affinity reveal the text themselves,  
Not hiding it as a scripture to be buried.  
If one can obtain this dao,  
At once is born the primordial light.  

The body crosses without needing a ferry,  
Floating and drifting into the immortal hall.  

---

No non-being, no end, no eternity,  
Being is at peace entering the subtle.  
Heavenly wings flourish beyond the highest,  
The mysterious lineage has its own essentials.  

Turning the three treasure wheels,  
The Ten Directions universally quake and shine.  
The Most High views the Jade Capital,  
The Demon King laughs in empty space.  

The Heavenly Emperor clasps hands and chants,  
All the true ones ride the void and whistle.  
Scattering flowers is my very thought,  
The eight vows naturally transcend.  

---

The numinous immortal rides the joyous dawn,  
Driving dragons treading the mysterious waves.  
Harmonizing truth to manifest auspiciousness,  
Ascending the eight heavens’ heights.  

Blessings respond beyond my expectation,  
Therefore the celestial net is released.  
The dao crowns the Three Realms,  
The earthly bonds are also surpassed.  

The true assembly moves with feeling,  
The Pure Wisdom Scripture blooms like a lotus.  

---

The unsurpassed awakening of the four generations,  
Vast and boundless beyond the great square.  
Hidden and manifest surely have cause,  
Without hidden, thus no darkness.  

Swiftly turning the mysterious wheel,  
True immortals rejoice in the azure expanse.  
At times wandering the vast indistinct,  
Heaven and humans have no bounds to meet.  

---

The numinous marvels proclaim and communicate,  
Heaven and humans have crossing shores.  
Floating a boat on the unfathomable abyss,  
Always fearing the scattering wind and waves.  

Its affinity has wondrous power,  
Who can reckon the force of wisdom?  
Slowly following the mysterious pivot,  
Clearly discerning the dark cause and effect.  

Upright and sharp, responding to the true child,  
The numinous zither plays in empty space.  
Who competes to revere the Ten Directions?  
The profound remains, I do not envy.  

---

The Most High spreads the cavernous text,  
The worthy return to original affinity.  
Desolate are the three treasure enclosures,  
Flourishing and splendid is my cause.  

The elder historian enters the essence,  
Pure in substance, giving birth to the golden body.  
Ending and beginning the kalpa anew,  
Increasingly feeling the numinous visage fresh.  

Rarely crossing to pay homage to the Most High,  
The precious text descends to the true.  
The Dao Forest flourishes in the heavenly capital,  
Illuminating all the earth’s immortals.  

Freely scattering numinous power,  
Vastly proclaiming the great dharma.  

---

The Most High views the Ten Directions,  
Dark and dense, blending phoenix and solemnity.  
Perfect light reflects the three stars,  
True beings don heavenly robes.  

The Demon King clasps hands standing,  
Governing the market beside Feng Capital.  
The sun and moon veil their radiance,  
Seven treasures shine without limit.  

All engage at this moment,  
Disasters vanish, hells cease.  
The vast floating sky without form,  
The honored cannot fathom.  

---

The three treasures flourish in the Ten Directions,  
Diligently clearing the void in midair.  
Winding and turning following transformation’s principle,  
One feeling, the dharma wheel rises.  

Vast and dim between brightness and obscurity,  
The four great elements rise with time.  
Empty and being, none is not,  
Mountains teem with ghosts and spirits.  

The Most High has no lingering thought,  
Extinguishing thought returns to the great vehicle.  

---

The Ten Directions’ Turning Profound Hymns,  
First the North, then Northeast, East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, Above, and Below.  
One hymn, one bow each.  

The Turning Profound grade arises from spontaneous naturalness,  
Standing empty for over nine thousand kalpas,  
Only then is its text revealed.  

The Primordial Heavenly King bestowed the dao upon the Most High,  
Later the dao was perfected,  
The Most High followed the Primordial Heavenly King’s command to select it,  
To correspond with the great precepts.  

One should on their birth day recite the three hundred precepts,  
Then chant this text.  
If practiced at noon or midnight,  
First fast, then proceed with the dao.  

If unaware of one’s birth day, use the Jiazi day.  
If ten years have passed, one may practice on the first day of the first month.
