## The Twelve Chapters of the Golden Decrees of Shangqing

Feasting beneath the grand pavilion of the Great Rosy Clouds,  
The Golden Palace gleams with purple clarity.  
In the Immortal Chambers, a banquet of Primordial Simplicity,  
Four verandas all adorned with vermilion and jade.  

Casting the wheel across the empty, profound ford,  
Reining the reins, dancing the green chariot.  
Jade blossoms flutter beneath clouded canopies,  
The Western Consort waves her brocade banner.  

Suddenly beyond the dust and filth,  
A splendid courtyard of fair maidens appears.  
Old karmic ties draw them here at appointed times,  
What is gained already lies in the dark.  

Riding the wind, imagining the Nine Heavens,  
Together we revel in the peace of the elixir’s brilliance.  
Turning to thank the worldly things left behind,  
How could they know the numinous within the void?

---

Ascending north to the Gate of Profound Darkness,  
Hand in hand, passing through lofty nets.  
Incense smoke disperses among the eight scenes,  
Mysterious winds drum the crimson waves.  

Looking up beyond the resounding ford,  
Gazing down upon the winding mountain crags.  
Whistling songs rise to the clouds,  
Phoenix cries echo through the nine caverns of rosy light.  

Riding the breath, floating in the vast void,  
Why should one tread the mountain’s heights?  
The golden tally commands the feathered spirits,  
Summoning troops to crush ten thousand demons.  

Rinsing and drawing the full morning radiance,  
Gathering spring to cradle the tender buds.  
In the midst of the bustling contest,  
One does not understand what to do.

---

On the northern ridge, thick mists rise,  
Crimson trees bear purple blossoms.  
Green herbs fall in the Phoenix Forest,  
Jade-green cliffs flourish in hidden recesses.  

The numinous pavilion soars into the vast void,  
Jade chambers join with the Great Rosy Clouds.  
Clouds rise within the winding chamber,  
Eight winds scatter the dark sands.  

The nine strings pluck the imperial ramparts,  
Dragons roar in harmony with the tally’s beat.  
Fanning tempests over the Five Great Mountains,  
Grasping the tally to command ten thousand demons.  

Gazing for but a moment,  
Suddenly a lifetime has passed.  
Alas, those born at dawn,  
How can they know the length of their days?

---

In the secluded corner of the rare Forest Palace,  
The spirit moves through the vast and silent desert.  
Arriving at the observatory reflecting six courts,  
Great and small all roam freely.  

Dragons blow, entwining clouds in their covers,  
Tigers roar, startling myriad branches.  
Three simples open the high chart,  
Rosy clouds flourish in the morning sky.  

Feathered banners stretch across the numinous ford,  
Purple chariots fly with radiant splendor.  
Reining the reins beyond the Nine Heavens,  
Looking up and down, all is vast and empty.  

Dust and foam gather the clamorous filth,  
Spirit lost, breath withers away.  
Why not seek the distant chariot,  
For eight thousand years is but one morning?

---

At dawn crossing the azure sea waves,  
Flying wheels depart the green chamber.  
Singing aloud the songs of companions,  
Covering the Canglang in their midst.  

Three contracts bind the jade heavens’ guests,  
Five appointments with the Eastern Blossom children.  
Feathered tempests rise with the imperial dawn,  
Feasting here in the vast Cold Palace.  

Eight notes played in the void,  
Purple phoenixes sing the numinous wind.  
Crimson clouds block the bright radiance,  
Eight scenes fly through the vast void.  

Chewing the jade spring ford,  
Vast and elegant, returning to infancy’s mist.  
Ultimate joy returns to the five spirits,  
Years accumulate, kalpas sharpen.  

Removing the sandals—what difficulty is there?  
Labor and worry lost in Heaven’s vastness.

---

At dawn harnessing the morning radiance,  
Reins loosened, issuing forth purple clarity.  
Floating clouds race through the Great Rosy Clouds,  
Raising canopies in the Cold Palace courtyard.  

High perfected ones guard the imperial chamber,  
Palace ponds draw in the Western spirits.  
Ten perfections and five empty caverns,  
Flying smoke winds around brocade screens.  

Tiger fans celebrate the divine wind,  
Purple clouds circle the dragon chariot.  
Suddenly reaching the ends of the eight directions,  
One glance, and a lifetime has passed.  

The flute sounds afar, the mysterious contest begins,  
Why not seek the Great Life?

---

The divine garden blooms with hidden orchids,  
Kun pond waters the glancing fields.  
Looking up at the Jade Clarity gates,  
Lofty and towering over the crimson ford.  

Purple clouds reflect the winding mat,  
Five clouds shine upon the nine mysteries.  
Eight winds rise through the utmost void,  
Dark mists gather between the green pavilions.  

The Three Primes dwell in the Western Palace,  
Eastern Blossom holds a fair maiden.  
The Northern Darkness sings seven cries,  
The Bright Concubine chants the Southern Truth.  

Striking the jade drum to the vermilion rhythm,  
Raising the jade tally to the six strings.  
In perfect accord, not by fate,  
All ascend to the vast Phoenix peak.  

Together commanding ten thousand demons,  
Dwelling here with a thousand black ones.  
To transcend and come is no hardship,  
Thus begins the unending years.

---

Riding breath, gazing into the empty cavern,  
Mounting the radiance, resting in the Nine Heavens.  
Moving the dense, vast radiance wings,  
The mysterious canopy arises without interval.  

Eight smokes whirl the sparse wheel,  
The path lingers, not allowing years.  
Striking the jade drum echoes through eight voids,  
My horse too has no ford.  

Grasping the tally entering Eastern Blossom,  
Evening feasts atop the mysterious garden peak.  
Binding the belt, carrying five spirits,  
Loosening and lifting the fine person.  

Dark karmic feelings move with ease,  
Floating freely, there is also fate.  
Together they bear soaring wings,  
One fan stirs billions.  

Descending radiance floats the mysterious light,  
Purple pavilion rides clouds to journey.  
Looking up beyond the Golden Palace,  
Gazing down upon the Western Blossom city.

---

Eastern Blossom opens the five radiances,  
Divine light shines with seven spirits.  
Shadows veil the three forks of candles,  
Flowing freely, all equal in the dark.  

Winds drum the empty cavern universe,  
Incense smoke scatters in the jade court.  
Hand in hand with the Weaver Maiden’s compassion,  
Twin collars fall in brocade blue.  

Primordial cycles cross feathered banners,  
Radiant canopies tilt with the clouds.  
Feasting and resting beyond the nine degrees,  
Right and wrong do not trouble me.  

Embracing emptiness within the mud pellet,  
Heavenly form grows ever more infantile by the day.  
How could one speak of caverns’ faults and filth,  
Where the center is bleak and lifeless?

---

Supporting the mulberry and桑 green sky peaks,  
Vermilion clouds bloom faintly bright.  
Waves and terraces soothe the void above,  
Four observatories reflect clear heights.  

Flying radiance reins the purple wheel,  
Three simples rein the cinnabar chariot.  
Lying down in the Great Emperor’s hall,  
Lofty and towering, the Mother’s courtyard.  

Washing feet in the jade-clear waves,  
Lifting the contract, the jade nectar urn.  
Winding morning rides the wind fan,  
Fluttering, sometimes descending and tilting.  

Briefly resting amid the earthly mists,  
Turning the chariot toward the good and true.  
Mysterious meetings naturally call to each other,  
Wandering freely in the dark and obscure.  

Only then knowing honor and disgrace, fortune and misfortune,  
Only then realizing the hastening of life.

---

The winding chamber is fit for pure stillness,  
Wishing the spirit to await the day’s completion.  
Why speak of the muddy road,  
Where a hundred ailments arise from this?  

Heaven’s court births golden splendor,  
Within it reveals the yin and evil.  
Jade valleys join the mysterious ministers,  
Jade breath mutually supports the net.  

Heavenly truth establishes the distant sun,  
Flying medicines spit forth numinous sands.  
At dawn, setting the heavenly horse,  
Turning the chariot toward the mysterious divine home.  

Immortals come to enter the chamber,  
Again to extinguish a hundred evils.

---

The Dao begins with fasting,  
Diligent practice ascends the Golden Palace.  
Thus the great Dharma bridge is set,  
Universally ferrying all beings.  

Repaying karmic grace from past lives,  
The daoist heart transcends and arises.  
Six fasts honor the empty caverns,  
Ten straight days, divine feelings penetrate.  

The Five Elders carve immortal names,  
Cloud carriages welcome and pay respects.  
The body flies to the mysterious capital,  
Seven ancestors all attain liberation.

Thus ends the Twelve Chapters of the Golden Decrees of Shangqing.
