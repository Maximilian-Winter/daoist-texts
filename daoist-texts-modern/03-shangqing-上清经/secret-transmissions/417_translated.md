## The Golden Truth Hymns of the Supreme Clarity Worthies, Recited Upon Bestowal of the Scripture

Feasting and gazing at the Grand Radiance Palace,  
The Golden Gate shines with purple clarity.  
The fasting gate reflects the Great Primordial,  
Four pavilions all adorned with vermilion jade.

Casting the wheel across the empty, cavernous ford,  
Reining the reins, dancing the green canopy.  
Jade blossoms flutter beneath clouded canopies,  
The Western Consort waves brocade banners.

Suddenly beyond dust and turbidity,  
A splendid figure appears in the courtyard.  
Old karmic ties respond in time,  
What is gained already dwells in the dark.

Riding the wind, imagining the Nine Heavens,  
Sweetly intoxicated with the infant elixir’s bloom.  
Turning to thank the worldly children,  
How could they know the spirit within the void?

Northward ascending the Mysterious Darkness Gate,  
Hand in hand, weaving the lofty net.  
Incense smoke scatters the eight vistas,  
Mysterious winds drum the crimson waves.

Looking up beyond the resounding ford,  
Gazing down upon the winding mountain recesses.  
Jade flutes sing above the clouds,  
Phoenix cries echo in the grotto of nine mists.

Riding the qi, roaming the vast void,  
Why linger on the Winged Mountain’s ridge?  
Golden tally commands the feathered spirits,  
Summoning troops to crush ten thousand demons.

Washing and drawing in the round morning radiance,  
Accumulating longevity, the infant teeth emerge.  
In the midst of the bustling throng,  
They do not understand—what can be done?

Northern ridges lush with heavenly haze,  
Crimson trees bear purple blossoms.  
Green herbs fall in the phoenix grove,  
Jade-green cliffs flourish in the mountain recess.

The numinous palace soars in the vast void,  
Jade chambers join the Great Radiance.  
Clouds rise within the winding chamber,  
Eight winds scatter the dark sands.

Nine strings pluck the emperor’s window,  
Dragon roars sing in harmony with the tally.  
Fan the gale over the Five Mountain ridges,  
Grasp the tally to command ten thousand demons.

Glancing briefly, in a moment’s time,  
Suddenly longevity has passed.  
Alas, those born at dawn,  
How can they know the measure of their days?

Remote vistas scarce find forest palaces,  
Spirit journeys through the boundless wilderness.  
Supreme vision reflects the six voids,  
Great and small all roam freely.

Dragon blows entwine five clouds,  
Tiger roars terrify myriad branches.  
Three primes form the lofty chart,  
Scarlet clouds flourish in the morning sky.

Feathered banners stretch across the numinous ford,  
Purple canopies fly with splendid plumes.  
Reining the steeds beyond the Nine Heavens,  
Looking up and down, all is vast and empty.

Dust and filth congeal in the noisy mire,  
Spirit lost, qi also withers.  
Why not seek the distant carriage?  
Eight thousand is but one morning.

At dawn crossing the blue sea waves,  
Flying wheels bid farewell to the green chamber.  
Singing aloud with friends of the dark,  
Fans and canopies surpass the vast waves.

Three contracts bring jade guests to the firmament,  
Five appointments summon Eastern Flower youths.  
Feathered gales ascend the imperial dawn,  
Feasting here in the Broad Cold Palace.

Eight palaces play in the void,  
Purple phoenix sings the numinous wind.  
Scarlet clouds block the bright radiance,  
Eight vistas fly through the vast void.

Chewing the jade spring ford,  
Vast and elegant, returning to infancy’s veil.  
Utmost joy nourishes the five spirits,  
Years accumulate like kalpas, lofty and grand.

Removing shoes—how easy it is!  
Yet toil and trouble lose the heavenly vigor.

At dawn harnessing the morning radiance,  
Loose reins unleash the purple clarity.  
Floating wheels race the Great Radiance,  
Raising canopies in the Broad Cold courtyard.

High worthies gather in the imperial chamber,  
City walls and palaces array the Western spirits.  
Scholars cease their dances in the empty hall,  
Flying smoke curls around brocade banners.

Tiger flags fan the divine winds,  
Auspicious clouds circle the dragon canopy.  
Suddenly gazing in all directions,  
One glance and longevity has already tipped.

Rustling, the mysterious mirror child,  
Why not seek the Supreme Life?

The divine garden flourishes with hidden ganoderma,  
Kun pool waters the jade fields.  
Gazing upon the Jade Clarity Gate,  
Steep cliffs overlook the crimson ford.

Purple clouds reflect the imperial seat,  
Five clouds shine upon the Nine Mysterious.  
Eight winds transcend the universe,  
Dark haze between green pavilions.

Three primes dwell in the Western Palace,  
Eastern Flower holds a fair maiden.  
Northern Darkness chants seven whistles,  
Bright Concubine sings the Southern Truth.

Caressing the bell, playing the vermilion tune,  
Jade tally freely strums eight strings.  
In harmonious accord, not by fate,  
Together sounding like the broad phoenix union.

Simultaneously commanding ten thousand demons,  
Dwelling here with myriad burdens.  
Transcending all, how difficult is it?  
Thus begins the unending years.

Harnessing qi, gazing at the empty hall,  
Riding the radiance, resting in the Nine Heavens.  
Dragon flags flourish in the broad glow,  
Feathered canopies birth eight clouds.

Gales blow without tracks or hindrance,  
My horse also has no ford.  
Grasping the tally, entering Eastern Flower,  
Evening feast atop the Mysterious Threshold.

Tied belts carry five spirits,  
Loosening collars, the fair one smiles.  
Dark karmic feelings fit their course,  
Silent yet fated.

All bear sharp wings,  
One fan stirs billions.  
Scarlet light floats the mysterious dawn,  
Purple pavilion rides the clouds to war.

Looking up beyond the Golden Gate,  
Gazing down upon the Western Flower city.

Eastern glow opens the five radiances,  
Divine origins shine the seven spirits.  
Shadows record the three candles,  
Flowing fate aligns with the dark.

Winds drum the empty hall and cosmos,  
Incense smoke scatters the jade court.  
Hand in hand, weaving the Weaver Maiden’s dance,  
Twin collars entwined with brocade blue.

Turning left, crossing feathered banners,  
Splendid canopies tilt with the clouds.  
Feasting and resting beyond the nine degrees,  
Right and wrong do not concern me.

Embracing the void within the mud pellet,  
Heavenly form grows brighter daily.  
How could it be like the defiled and filthy,  
Miserable and listless in life?

Supporting the green empty peak of Fusang,  
Vermilion clouds bloom faintly bright.  
Wave terraces rise above the sky’s void,  
Four views reflect the clear heights.

Flying radiance reins the purple wheel,  
Three primes rein the cinnabar canopy.  
Reclining in the Great Emperor’s hall,  
Noisy cries in the Mother’s courtyard.

Washing feet in the blue torrent waves,  
Lifting the jade nectar jar.  
Winding morning rides the wind’s fan,  
Fluttering, sometimes tilting downward.

Briefly resting amid the dark haze,  
Turning the carriage to the pure and true.  
Mysterious meetings mutually essential,  
Wandering freely in the dark.

Only then knowing honor and disgrace are bitter,  
Only then realizing the haste of life.

The winding chamber can be pure and still,  
Nourishing truth awaits the sincere sun.  
Why speak of the muddy path?  
A hundred illnesses arise from this.

Heaven’s court produces golden blossoms,  
Within they block yin and evil.  
Jade valleys join mysterious echoes,  
Jade qi mutually supports the net.

Heavenly truth stands above the sun,  
Flying medicines spit numinous sands.  
True morning brightens the heavenly horse,  
Turning the carriage to the mysterious divine home.

Immortals come entering the chamber,  
Their writings destroy a hundred demons.
