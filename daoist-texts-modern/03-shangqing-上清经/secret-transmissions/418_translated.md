## Supreme Clarity’s Unsurpassed Golden Origin Jade Clarity Golden Truth Flying Origin Stepping Void Jade Chapter

### First Hymn

I bow my head in reverence to the Heavenly Venerable,  
Burn incense, returning homage to the Ten Directions.  
Twin lights revolve with tenfold brilliance,  
The flying Brahman Dharma wheel’s thread unwinds.  
All the heavens share this celebration,  
Together they rein the reins of life and death.

Flowing gold radiates the Great Nothingness,  
The subtle, utmost True King appears.  
Three cycles ascend the Jade Realm,  
Majestic and serene, freely soaring through the void.  
In the profound heights of the Great Net above,  
The Golden Origin Hall stands lush and resplendent.

### Second Hymn

Golden spirit’s wondrous form,  
Jade’s elegance naturally flows.  
Riding the bright circle of light,  
The Ten Directions shine with golden countenance.  
High, high atop the myriad heavens,  
All myriad paths align in harmony.

Scattering blossoms of sun and moon’s essence,  
Primordial begins to celebrate the golden wind.  
Returning through endless kalpas,  
Ever joyful on the Jade Clarity peak.  
Twisting incense to greet the Dao Sovereign,  
I roam freely within the golden mystery.

### Third Hymn

Silken clouds caress the rising smoke,  
Within lies the Jade Emperor’s court.  
Adorned with seven treasures’ splendor,  
Radiance reflects Supreme Clarity.  
Wondrous awakening, profound truth connects,  
Wandering through the flowing golden city.

The summons calls from the Divine Sky,  
Floating, chanting the cavern scriptures.

### Fourth Hymn

The myriad marvels of Jade Clarity’s capital,  
Towering at the edge of the celestial net.  
The Unsurpassed Primordial King,  
Respected among the Ten Directions’ heavens.  
Flying blossoms scatter the Great Nothingness,  
A jeweled canopy shelters the golden wheel.

Eight garrisons guard the profound clarity above,  
Brilliantly shining the golden nothingness.  
Glowing splendidly in the seven-treasure forest,  
Phoenix songs echo, singing the flying luan.  
On the left, the heavenly treasure youth guards,  
On the right, the Jade True Lord attends.

The cavern’s twin images shine clear,  
Illuminating the golden splendor gate.

### Fifth Hymn

The Unsurpassed Golden Mysterious Palace,  
Rises lofty on the Jade Heavenly Terrace.  
The Mysterious True One rides the void,  
Majestically circling the empty expanse.  
Spiritual cypress and beasts dance in union,  
The Dharma drum vibrates, summoning heaven’s arrival.

Ten supreme wonders blaze and sparkle,  
Profound sounds harmonize without discord,  
Pure fragrance and elegant music,  
Safeguard and open the ten thousand ages.

### Sixth Hymn

Golden Truth’s tenfold wondrous views,  
Subtle and rare, entering the formless.  
Bowing to command the Golden Morning Youth,  
Reining together with the high spirits.  
Incense and blossoms scatter with the wind,  
Mysterious chants arise in natural voice.

Seated on the carriage, summoning Heavenly Balance,  
Flying Truth performs on the jade harp.  
In the radiant great light,  
All ten sages gather united.

### Seventh Hymn

Deep tranquility, the great vehicle’s merit,  
The Ten Directions’ heavenly sovereign.  
Mara’s Dharma wheels turn,  
True images blaze brilliantly.  
Six degrees, kalpa-high peaks,  
Adorned with the Golden Spirit chapter.

Auspicious responses arise without limit,  
Flowing radiance fills myriad bright scenes.  
Seven treasures naturally grow,  
Palaces govern the vast void.  
All heavens rejoice together,  
Banners and blossoms scatter pure fragrance.

### Eighth Hymn

The great dao has no boundaries,  
Universal salvation as the bridge and ford.  
Where the Heavenly Venerable descends in radiance,  
Ten blossoms form a neighborhood.  
The utmost true great saintly host,  
Scatters blossoms, unfolding threefold ease.

Bowing and looking, the dharma’s admonitions and merit,  
Forever close to the Jade Emperor’s person.  
Constantly feasting on jade smoke and mist,  
Principle and body both free of dust.  
Form received, long-lasting appearance,  
Dao practice naturally renewed.

Seated, summoned by all heavens’ courts,  
Eternal kalpas sever cold causes.

### Ninth Hymn

Far, far away lies the Jade Mysterious Capital,  
Lofty is the Golden Spirit Mansion.  
Void Emperor’s dragon smoke banners,  
Eight assemblies hold firm the true origin.  
Leading the Nine Heavens’ kings,  
Gazing upon the Golden Immortal ancestors.

Carefree in the mysterious radiance’s embrace,  
Transcending, all obtain deliverance.  
Countenance wondrous, marvelously fine,  
Chanting and flying the mysterious steps.  
If not companions of the Jade Emperor,  
How could one share this path?

### Tenth Hymn

Soaring light and jade chariot together,  
Chanting the long-lasting scroll.  
Golden feathers patrol the empty sky,  
Hand holding the jade bright lotus.  
Suddenly releasing the three nets,  
Preserving the kalpa’s destined years.

Golden youth strikes the jade chime,  
Jade bells ring through all heavens.  
Gathering the great myriad hosts,  
Jade void scatters dragon smoke.  
Flying blossoms drift the Ten Directions,  
Joyful before the Heavenly Venerable.

Wondrous beyond all wonders,  
Entering the mirror’s marvel, forever profound.

### Eleventh Hymn

Void origin, utmost truth,  
Profound void naturally so.  
Mist-filled caverns clear and pure,  
Condensing the simple golden truth.  
Primordial supreme talisman commands,  
Protecting Heaven’s eternal existence.

Primordial form, dao threefold,  
Light shines through the cavern.  
Flowing, irrigating Heaven and Earth,  
Three images share the same radiance.  
Supreme Clarity rides,  
Supporting and winging my body.

Vast spiritual descents gather,  
Majestic light flows bright.  
Subtle and profound entering mystery,  
Together ascending Jade Clarity.

### Twelfth Hymn

Lush and elegant Unsurpassed Palace,  
Highest peak of the heavenly treasure court.  
Profound and peerless twins,  
Radiance shines upon all heavens.

My body born of seven treasures,  
Brahman light enters the formless.  
Profound mystery, utmost true virtue,  
Flying heavenward offering green canopy.

Releasing the seven generations’ trials,  
The Jade Emperor comes to welcome.  
Bright wheels shine the Ten Directions’ light,  
Carefree ascending Jade Clarity.

### Thirteenth Hymn

Burning incense, cavern smoke,  
Feeling the assembly of the Supreme True.  
Celebrating the three disciples,  
Sharing the five sufferings in joy.  
Golden Morning youth,  
Guards and attends my body.

Eight lights’ jade carriage,  
Escorts me to the morning.  
Golden youth and mysterious maiden,  
Scatter blossoms to remove confusion.  
Blessings flow from the imperial lords,  
Heavens protect and affirm.

Lofty Jade Clarity,  
Vast array of the great myriad.  
All true ones descend in time,  
Majestic Supreme Clarity.  
Bowing heads, praising goodness,  
Paying homage to the Heavenly Venerable.

### Fourteenth Hymn

Profound mystery, mystery upon mystery,  
Radiant and shining Jade Clarity.  
Golden truth scatters blossoms,  
Flowing, irrigating all heavens.  
Offering sincerity beyond thought,  
Preserving remembrance of the scripture.

Cultivating fasts and burning incense,  
Heavenly treasure guards the spirit.  
Seven ancestors celebrate together,  
Ascending into the formless.  
All heavens sing praises,  
The Dao King responds in accord.

Lush and elegant, radiant power,  
Cavern reflections illuminate Supreme Clarity.  
Protecting and ferrying the Three Realms,  
Riding the light, flying in journey.  
Heavenly demons cross hands,  
Jade True ones welcome.

The five sufferings are resolved in time,  
Carefree ascending the capital.  
Bowing to the three reverents,  
Descending forms in the Ten Directions.  
Transcending, transcending through the cavern’s clarity,  
Purple voids intertwine and shine.

High perfected ones rejoice together,  
Speeding their bodies to the jade court.
