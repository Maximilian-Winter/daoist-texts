## Hymns of the Many True Ones

### Hymn of the Great Mysterious Scripture Praised by the Sovereign of the Supreme Subtle Heaven

The elixir’s radiance reflects the cloud court,  
Purple smoke gleams within the jade forest.  
Seven treasures blossom in resplendent bloom,  
Brilliant is the numinous music of precious jade.

Palace tones harmonize themselves,  
Wondrous spirits open the human collar.  
Profound chants sow fields of blessing,  
Broadly ferrying hearts without boundary.

---

### Hymn of the Great Mysterious Scripture Praised by the Heavenly Sovereign

The mysterious transformation originally leaves no trace,  
Yet from traces arises the dao’s lineage.  
Roaming the edges of the Nine Heavens,  
Resting the chariot at the Six Palaces.

The dao flows freely within the vast void,  
Spiritual songs issue forth from the great expanse.  
Forms sense the utmost silent court,  
Thoughts chant rare subtle connections.

---

### Hymn of the Great Mysterious Scripture Praised by the Supreme Emperor

Dim and veiled, the primordial transformation begins,  
Faint and distant, the morning glow disperses.  
Above the great silent void and mystery,  
The two instruments of yin and yang are clearly divided.

Condensing essence embraces the empty embryo,  
Forming and transforming, nurturing the spiritual vision.  
Containing the true, nourishing the spirit within,  
Suddenly dawn breaks open the darkened morning.

At first awakening, one laments the hastening years,  
Fate turns against the heavenly river.

---

### Hymn from the Scripture of the Original Life by the Venerable Lord Lao

The root limit of all beings,  
Silent, without arising or ceasing.  
Weakness lost, confused about its root,  
Separated from the true source.

Foolishly creating causes of good and evil,  
Disasters and blessings repay without end.  
If one desires to overturn the sea of suffering,  
One must let the river of attachment run dry.

Guarding the One firmly, specializing in softness,  
Holding this without flaw or defect.  
Right wisdom connects all beings,  
Wondrous insight shatters all knots.

All myriad practices mixed and unified,  
The three vehicles extinguish their separate paths.  
True stillness departs from worldly filth,  
Pure coolness without vexing heat.

---

### Hymn of the Supreme Wisdom Returning to Mystery

The numinous immortals ride the joyous clouds,  
Driving dragons, treading the mysterious waves.  
Affirming truth, manifesting auspicious signs,  
Washing feet in the Eight Heavenly Rivers.

Blessings respond without my expectation,  
Thus able to release the heavenly net.  
Dao and virtue crown the Three Realms,  
Even the earth’s net is surpassed.

Touched by encounters with numinous true ones,  
Pure wisdom is the lotus flower of scripture.

---

### Hymn of the Supreme Wisdom Scripture Praise

Learning immortality, abandoning worldly thoughts,  
Moment by moment they accumulate in sequence.  
Coming and going disturb my spirit,  
The spirit restless, no place untouched.

Extinguish thought, stop in empty leisure,  
Rustling, entering the silent void.  
Requesting scripture as if starving and thirsty,  
Holding resolve like gold and stone.

Protect the child flying the mysterious path,  
Five spirits ferry through talismanic registers.

---

### Hymn of the Great Vow and Great Precepts Scripture

To learn immortality, conduct is urgent,  
Observing precepts restrains passions and mind.  
Vast and serene, upright qi dwells,  
Immortals and sages naturally seek each other.

If one does not believe the dharma words,  
Why dwell in mountains and forests?

---

### Jade Emperor’s Sudden Bestowal of the Great Cave’s Thirty-Nine Chapters and Song of Ascending the Dragon Terrace

Whirling fiercely, the Three Rosy Clouds lead,  
Turning resolutely, the Seven Without Cover.  
Eight scenes enter the Great Origin,  
Flying and scattering beyond the Nine Heavens.

Jade gates birth radiant clouds,  
Numinous smoke cuts off the deep gloom.  
The Western Palace chants the Profound Cave,  
Clear songs support the Fusang horizon.

Guarding the feminine forested peaks,  
Mysterious chants at the Five Elders’ assembly.  
Suddenly a heart is born,  
Binding you with the central belt.

---

### Second Hymn

The Gourd River shakes the vast expanse,  
The Heavenly Ford drums ten thousand streams.  
Eight winds drive the divine sky,  
Vastly roaming the void.

Chanting the cave’s divine brightness,  
The sound is your mysterious casting.  
Suddenly life must proceed,  
Elbow bent, hastening amid dust.

A bitter heart indeed,  
I will tell you what you seek.

---

### Hymn of the Queen Mother of the West Bestowing the Purple Degree Flame-Light Divine Transformation Scripture

Whistling songs at the Nine Mysterious Terraces,  
Cliffs and ridges condense a desolate solemnity.  
Within the mind, six senses flow freely,  
Eyes abandon the dust and filth.

Flowing rosy clouds shine on the golden chamber,  
The empty hall scatters layers of mystery.  
Accumulated feelings bring down the numinous descent,  
Form alone, the dao also divides.

Cultivating suddenly through myriad kalpas,  
How could one perceive the cycles of youth?

---

### Second Hymn

The elegant garden flourishes the divine steps,  
Vermilion gates, jade forest courtyard.  
Flowing winds drum the empty cavern,  
Jade sounds ride the void’s breath.

Purple smoke entwines the curved door,  
Elixir radiance reflects the green canopy.  
Flying banners flourish the mysterious canopy,  
Feathered joints shine with purple clarity.

Ascending the nine heavens’ horizon,  
Roaming and playing in the phoenix city.  
Looking upon the beloved secluded child,  
One joy arises with the morning’s birth.

---

### Third Hymn

Reining the reins, controlling the bright radiance,  
Feasting in the cave’s wild outskirts.  
Wandering, seeking the numinous person,  
Merging forms, celebrating the joyous sky.

Hands part the vermilion mound’s door,  
Bright as the divine surge of peace.  
Golden palace towers majestic,  
Pure radiance without dust or filth.

Loosening the collar at the mysterious Lang Terrace,  
Fulfilling my good wish’s assembly.  
Removing shoes from the Three Paths’ hardships,  
Preserving refinement firmly in old age.

---

### Hymn of the Numinous Treasure True Unity Natural Supreme Mysterious Unity Perfected Person

All wonders emerge from the cave of truth,  
Radiantly shining, illuminating the Great Clarity.  
Those who serve are called immortals,  
Their bodies without eternal longevity.

Freely wandering, playing in the mysterious void,  
Palaces arrayed without form.  
Splendidly brilliant, the seven treasure forest,  
Shining bright with sun and moon essence.

Dragons and qilin gallop across,  
Phoenixes soar with mournful cries.  
The Supreme One governs the Purple Terrace,  
Many true ones chant the cave scriptures.

Twisting incense, bowing in reverence,  
Circling the palace city.  
Three circuits return to the high seat,  
The Dao King answers the summons.

Human rulers propagate the supreme dao,  
All under heaven universally peaceful.

---

### Hymn of the Supreme Propagation of the Dao

The Supreme Mysterious Void lineage,  
Propagates the dao, revering its scripture.  
Looking up and down, immortality attained,  
Enduring kalpas countless in number.

Majestic is the supreme true virtue,  
Silent and still, arising from non-being.  
Heavenly sights form empty branches,  
Riding the void, naturally journeying.

Sun and moon shine brilliantly,  
Peaceful harmony and endless joy.

---

### Song of the Eastern Splendor Chamber’s Spirit Consort by Fang Zhu

Purple cassia planted in the jade garden,  
Vermilion blossoms sound mournfully.  
The moon palace births the medicinal abyss,  
At midday lies the jade pool.

Left plucks the circular spirit radiance,  
Right pulls the cinnabar rosy glow.  
Flowing gold illuminates the crimson court,  
Eight scenes surpass the smoke’s return.

Green canopy floats bright and clear,  
Controlling rhythm commands the Supreme Subtle.  
Phoenix essence, youthful radiant face,  
Jade richness fills great hunger.

Controlling dawn, drawing from the Great Element,  
Riding suddenly, soaring the jade steps.  
Breathing in and out the six void energies,  
The jade concubine draws her scarf along.

Plucking the southern cloud fan’s strings,  
Fragrant winds drum the brocade cloak.  
Knocking on the Shang tone, beasts dance,  
Six heavens capture divine might.

Suddenly countless kalpas,  
Longevity records towering high.  
Young fish not yet cooked in the cauldron,  
Speak my sorrow beneath the cliff.

---

### Chant of the Great Lord Qing Tong

To plant the root of extinction and liberation,  
One must uproot birth and death’s self.  
Sinking in thought, falling to the nine springs,  
Only sitting, pitying the body’s frame.

---

### Constant Chant of the True Person of the Great Void

Observing spirit carrying form,  
Is like a chariot following a horse.  
When the chariot breaks, the horse runs away,  
Entangled for a time in falsity.

Sorrow for the world is only this knowledge,  
Only pity for wind and fire.  
Sowing sins on Heaven’s net,  
Receiving poison beneath Earth’s hell.

---

### Constant Chant of the True Person of the Western City, Lord Wang

Form is the ferrying boat of spirit,  
Docking the shore when it must part.  
Form is not spirit’s permanent abode,  
Spirit is not form’s constant vessel.

Wandering the cycle of birth and death,  
Only suffering the heart’s hesitation.

---

### Constant Chant of the Lesser Perfected Person, Lord Wang

Losing the dao, crossing the death ford,  
Three souls confused about the path of life.  
Each birth day grows distant,  
Each death day comes too soon.

Alas, the bitter guest of pain,  
Root and flower already reversed.  
Rising only to scatter in dust,  
The horse knows to return, withered and old.

---

The above four poems were chanted at the Jade Terrace assembly on the day of the autumn equinox last month,  
The four lords chanted these words, harmonizing with the string sounds of Xuan Jun and Guang Shao.  
This was recounted by Lady You.

---

### Song of Guo Si Chao, Often Riding a Small Boat Playing in the Pond, Knocking on the Boat and Singing

Clear pool girded by numinous peaks,  
Long forests lush and verdant.  
Mysterious crows fly the secluded wilds,  
Words of awakening flow with ease.

Beating the drum, riding the divine waves,  
Bowing heads hoping for the morning breeze.  
Yet not having attained liberation,  
Freely wandering among hills and woods.

---

### Second Song

The wave spirit beyond the Nine Terraces,  
Refining the dao to complete truth.  
Tucking away these numinous phoenix feathers,  
Hiding my splendid dragon scales.

Raising the square inch object high,  
Ten thousand winds are all filth and dust.  
Looking sadly at the morning-born bride,  
Who can exhaust your chariot wheels?

---

### Third Song

Roaming the void, falling not as a gale,  
Spirit steps without form or place.  
Round scenes shine with bright rosy clouds,  
Nine phoenixes sing the morning sun.

Flapping wings fan the Heavenly Ford,  
Dark clouds celebrate the soaring clouds.  
Thus constructing the Supreme Subtle cosmos,  
Drawing this golden pear nectar.

Freely wandering atop the mysterious terrace,  
Neither existing nor not existing.

---

### Fourth Song

Riding suddenly, dancing the divine sky,  
Wearing clouds, girded by nine suns.  
The High Emperor aligns the dragon wheels,  
Thus constructing the Northern Splendor chamber.

Divine tiger guards the jade forest,  
Wind and cloud merge into one.  
Opening and closing the dark gates,  
Spiritual transformations, mysterious traces vanish.

---

### Immortal Lord of Life Preservation Informs Xu Huya and Du Guangping’s Usual Joyful Song

Pure radiance veils the vast forest,  
Warm sun ascends the eastern glow.  
Morning winds dance the six smokes,  
Surging, the eight paths soar.

Why must the Five Mountains be lofty?  
Famous peaks suffice to rise.  
Delicate hands grasp the cave’s mound,  
Resting the heart, secretly flourishing.

Breathing in and out the embryo’s essence qi,  
Who among the mysterious white can surpass?

---

### Queen Mother of the West’s Banquet for Emperor Han Wudi’s Lady Shangyuan, Playing the Yunlin Invitation Song and Stepping the Void Melody

Once traversing the mysterious true dao,  
Leaping steps ascend the great rosy clouds.  
Carrying the book, arriving at Heaven’s Pass,  
Asking after the Most High’s household.

Suddenly passing the Purple Tenuity Enclosure,  
True persons arrayed like hemp.  
Clear light and pure breeze rise,  
Cloud covers reflect vermilion blossoms.

Orchid palace opens pearl fans,  
Azure sky unveils jade sand.  
Elixir terrace forms empty branches,  
Eyes gleam, generating radiant light.

Flying phoenixes follow the ridge,  
Torch dragons lean on the winding serpent.  
Jade embryo births crimson ganoderma,  
Nine colors scatter, grasping each other.

Drawing in the light, refining the immortal body,  
Countless kalpas just like a child’s teeth.  
Who has longevity before the end?  
Fusang is not to be examined.

---

### Queen Mother of the West Commands Attendant Lady Tian Sifei to Respond with Song

Morning ascends the Supreme Spirit Palace,  
Drawing in the eight king’s orchids.  
Evening enters the Mysterious Origin Gate,  
Plucking blossoms, shaking the agate.

Fearing the foot at the Gourd River,  
The Weaver Girl stands at the ford’s tray.  
Breathing in and out, embracing the radiant clouds,  
Tasting it as a single meal.

Purple Tenuity so vast and dense,  
Jade wheels wear vermilion cinnabar.  
At dawn departing the vast mansion,  
At dusk lodging in the Juchen walls.

Paths differ in their way,  
Each body finds its own rest.  
The two instruments still exist,  
Why doubt the countless kalpas?

Do not speak this to worldly people,  
Corpse-words make this difficult.

---

### Queen Mother’s Gift to Lady Wei Song

Riding my eight-scene carriage,  
Suddenly entering the Jade Clarity.  
Dragon skirts brush the heavenly river,  
Tiger banners capture vermilion troops.

Freely wandering the mysterious ford’s border,  
Ten thousand streams without pause.  
Sorrowing this coming and going meeting,  
When kalpas end, Heaven and Earth collapse.

One must exhaust the non-middle scene,  
Neither death nor birth exists.  
Body is that natural dao,  
Silent observation merges with the great dark.

---

### Southern Peak Upright True Pen, Jade Reflecting Radiant Essence

Having duties without fixed time,  
Empty heart naturally receives spirit.

Joyous assembly within the Crimson River,  
Together delighting in endless joy.

---

### Double Bowing Pearl Plays the Yun Ao and Responds with Song

Jade Clarity emerges from the Nine Heavens,  
Divine ties fly beyond the rosy clouds.  
Sky terraces shine towering,  
Spirit summer flourishes lushly.

Five clouds rise with emerald splendor,  
Eight winds fan green qi.  
Looking up chanting to dispel demons,  
Looking down refining wisdom and insight.

Myriad true ones open the morning scene,  
Singing to meet in the crimson chamber.  
Upright virtue, the sound of the son,  
Spirit reflected, then brushed by rain.

Heavenly peak soars the empty branch,  
Along the terrace, deep and profound.  
Roaming the sea, understanding narrow wells,  
Treading truth, awakening the world’s filth.

Dancing wheels feast in the heavy void,  
Fish traps naturally abandoned.  
Returning to my great kalpa net,  
Forever thanking the morning-born world.

---

### High Immortal’s Expectation of Wandering the Cave Spirit Melody

Jade chamber shines with eastern rosy clouds,  
Purple chariot floats the crimson dawn.  
Splendid terrace, what eyes anticipate?  
Northern banquet flies the heavenly void.

Pure and quiet, the great void’s midst,  
Faintly treading the shifting light.  
Chanting the great cave’s chapters,  
Singing these three nine pieces.

The melody sleeps within the vast desert,  
Spirit kings dwell in the square inch.  
Silent chamber contemplates spiritual radiance,  
What cause for suffering in forested mountains?

In an instant, changing to a decrepit old man,  
Returning to the face of a child.

---

### Four Perfected Ones Descend to Lady Wei with Song

Elixir bright shines the Upper Clarity,  
Eight winds drum the great rosy clouds.  
Returning my divine sky chariot,  
Thus constructing the jade ridge’s summit.

Alas, beyond Heaven and Earth,  
The nine enclosures are all my home.  
Gathering sun’s essence above,  
Drinking yellow moon’s radiance below.

Spiritual vision in empty non-being,  
Roc’s path without evil interval.  
Looking upon Wei Xian’an,  
Turbid qi harms your harmony.

Diligently study the mysterious inner thought,  
When dao is formed, surpass one another.

---

### Song of Fang Zhu’s Qing Tong

Great rosy clouds fan the morning radiance,  
Nine energies without fixed form.  
Mysterious reins fly beyond the heavens,  
Eight scenes ride the clear brightness.

Hands grasp the Jade Emperor’s robe,  
Carry me born in the morning.  
Looking upon the seven luminaries’ chamber,  
Bright and clear, also dark and deep.

Surpassing is Wei’s son,  
Having heart and also feeling.  
Mysterious uprightness naturally meets,  
Golden script bears the Eastern Splendor name.

Xian’an secretly studies,  
Promising to meet at Yang Valley.

---

### Song of the Fusang Spirit King

Morning opens the Supreme Emperor’s chamber,  
Surpassing the Gourd River waters.  
Blue sea flies with emerald waves,  
Connecting peaks, red mountains stand tall.

Floating wheels ride cloud waves,  
Nine dragons rise together in harness.  
Tiger banners flourish at rosy ford,  
Spirit winds suddenly turn and govern.

Splendor remains, long rejoicing in the dao,  
Thus reaching high spirits’ likeness.  
Uprooting and moving beyond the three bonds,  
Touched by meeting, only now beginning.

Promising to meet the Yang Luo official,  
Dao formed, carrying Wei’s son.

---

### Song of the Clear Void True Person

Riding suddenly, controlling the clear void,  
Wandering the Western Splendor pavilion.  
Jade forest already divine treetops,  
Tiger banners chase smoke and scatter.

Wisdom winds shake the cinnabar banners,  
Bright candles illuminate the eight radiances.  
Loosening collar, wrapping the ordinary chamber,  
Spirit bells ring, shining brightly.

Resting in the scene like forest branches,  
Nine strings play the mysterious center.  
Leaving me accumulated worldly worries,  
Releasing this thousand-year sigh.

Joyful anticipation without limit,  
All night again waiting for dawn.

---

### Second Hymn

Purple haze pities the mysterious void,  
Spirit winds without reins or guidance.  
Suddenly filling the eight districts,  
Blessing you to open the empty stillness.

Eight windows ever changing in brightness,  
Some dark, some shining.  
Cave vision of the three cinnabar fields,  
Silent, giving birth to form and radiance.

Concentrating spirit, uprightly meeting,  
Cloud forms tall, brilliant and neat.  
Ashamed not to move the Ying stone,  
Covering that natural brilliance.

Diligently and closely guarding the path of life,  
Leaking and replacing knots and disasters.  
Spirit’s appointment has its own time,  
Taking sleeves, then ascending together.

---

### Song of the Sorrowful World

Heaven above, human below,  
Meetings sparse and rare.  
Sun sets behind the western mountain,  
Evening crows return flying.

A hundred years but a moment,  
Will and wish diverge.  
Heaven’s palace just a hand’s breadth,  
Regret not following.

---

### Ba Ballad

Immortals who attain, first thatch formed,  
Riding dragons ascending into Great Clarity.  
At this time, mysterious isles play at the Red City,  
Succession and passing lie in my fullness.

Emperor studies it in the Jia Ping year.

---

### Poem by Shi Anqing

Spirit mountain creates great rosy clouds,  
Solid rocks pierce the sky peaks.  
Purple smoke scatters over the divine land,  
Riding the gale, driving the white dragon.

Together with four honored guests,  
Eastward to pay homage to Lord Sanglin.  
Though Guangxiu’s years are long past,  
How is the vigorous spirit so dim?

Truly not yielding to the lower path,  
Promoting years to exalt one another.

---

### Poem by Zhang Youshi

Northward journey beyond the great desert,  
Coming to ascend the Penglai gate.  
Purple clouds build the spirit palace,  
Fragrant smoke so dense.

Beautiful is Luo Guangxiu,  
Long dwelling in the dao’s rank.  
Row upon row at the True Person’s seat,  
Watching the white dragon stride.

Using the four of Li Shi,  
When will we all untie the belt?  
Longing to open the robe, friends,  
Joyful is the high morning meeting.

---

### Poem by Xu Yufu

Roaming and viewing strange mountain peaks,  
Rinsing in the clear blue flow.  
From afar glimpsing among Penglai,  
Lofty, piercing the sky’s darkness.

Five ganoderma cover the crimson cliff,  
Four steps of jade chess and jade.  
Scattered numinous blossoms spread,  
Shining bright, illuminating the divine court.

Calmly beyond the seven senses,  
Allowing me to grasp the heavenly birth.  
Self-sufficient in the square inch,  
What need is there for the white dragon’s glory?

---

### Poem by Ding Weining

Mysterious mountain constructs the vast waves,  
Golden chambers reflect the spirit pavilion.  
Luo Gong stands tall and noble,  
Calmly with no interval.

Form sinks into the northern cold cosmos,  
Three spirits connect with the Nine Heavens.  
Together with colleagues, all go,  
Promoting my high victorious years.

Young Shi Qing’an,  
Unwilling to exalt the worthy.  
Mocking Lord Penglai,  
Calling this Guangxiu’s predecessor.

What will the bright lord do,  
To counter this youthful pen?

---

### Letter of King Wu Fuchai

Mysterious ford flows crimson waves,  
Kunbi reflects the agate mountain.  
Morning sun controls morning radiance,  
Gathering splendor, how graceful the dragonfly.

Wandering clouds fall on the sun,  
Gale scenes soar above the three heavens.  
Numinous treasure shines in the nine voids,  
Dark and light gather between the mountains.

Xia Yu ascends the Eight Windows,  
Scattering qi, sounding the golden orchid.  
Shaking branches, stirring jade twigs,  
Following waves to seek the great source.

Supporting essence stands the spirit pole,  
Drooping leaves to form abundance.  
Vast and distant, dragon and phoenix traces,  
Radiantly shining the Nine Heavens’ script.

Looking up to draw in the Three Stars’ essence,  
Protecting the body, seeking long peace.  
Looking down washing the five flower liquid,  
Returning again to the childlike face.

Soaring spirit in the warm cool palace,  
How could it know heat and cold?  
A thousand autumns like clear dawn,  
Ten thousand years still half the day.

Beating wings rise to the void,  
Calling me the numinous treasure official.  
Burning incense, five emperors’ chariots,  
All meet at the radiant desert’s end.

Asking about hunger and thirst,  
Mysterious springs abundantly flow cinnabar.  
Seeking immortality within the square inch,  
Eight directions have no ease or difficulty.

Hearing the stench of vermilion gates,  
The middle path holds hardship.  
Engraved tablets labor in shadowed cliffs,  
Caverns and grottos can be verified.

---

### Poem of Xin Xianzi

Once entering the dark village,  
Following the chariot responding to the spirit’s call.  
Spirit disperses with empty non-being,  
Qi vanishes with joyous clouds.

Form is not bright jade substance,  
How can the mysterious craftsman carve?  
Butterfly feet chant secret songs,  
Raising hands playing the wailing strings.

Forest chamber holds rare joy,  
Cut off from the pavilion’s exterior.  
Leaving radiance attached to the round brightness,  
Fine sounds how sparse.

---

### Second Poem

Silent communication sends feelings,  
Mysterious qi captures moving sound.  
High wheels though uneven,  
Ten thousand fathoms always sought.

Rustling, refining the daoist,  
Uniting spirit, agreeing with the numinous heart.  
Abandoning and following the world’s transformations,  
Mind wandering in the deep secluded forest.

Together roaming beyond principle,  
Meeting quietly at the eastern peak.

---

### Third Poem

Life’s chariot crosses the vast Feng’a,  
Wandering traces in the dark village.  
In the void there are things,  
Within there is also impermanence.

Awakening words have no boundary,  
Together meeting at the Hao Bridge.  
Eyes witness mysterious understanding,  
Ghosts and spirits’ principles forgotten.

---

### Song of the Supreme Mysterious Clarity Left Lady

Lush and dense, not a true ruin,  
The Great Origin is my pavilion.  
Mysterious Lord how could there be ruin,  
Mist swirling, solitary difficulty.

Falling phoenix controls purple haze,  
Delicate reins ascend the morning ridge.  
Silent without boundary,  
Radiant in the empty sky’s view.

Hidden ganoderma adorns the phoenix hill,  
Lingering by the jade forest’s edge.  
Dragon embryo nurtures your form,  
Eight jades circle the pure dawn.

Jade brilliance fills the jade palace,  
Forming blossoms shining on cliffs.  
Roc fans surpass ten thousand peaks,  
Flapping wings support the soaring pen.

Western courtyard commands long song,  
Cloud bells abandon empty playing.  
Eight winds entwine the green cosmos,  
Clusters of smoke suddenly scatter.

Spirit child throws flowing gold,  
Faint fire opens the written desk.  
Three origins bend the waist in dance,  
Purple emperor waves sleeves in praise.

Brightly fanning the scene’s radiance,  
Glowing long with the brilliant planet.  
Surpassing steps raise bright blades,  
Looking down makes me lament.

Sorrowing earthly immortals,  
Why dwell in forested ravines?

---

### Song of the Spirit Phoenix

Dim and distant, the spirit phoenix,  
Endlessly returning,  
My thoughts stretch on,  
Forever at odds with my wishes.

Countless kalpas without end,  
When will it come flying?  
Thus the king slew the phoenix,  
Yet it rose in sorrow,

Embracing the daughter, flying together,  
Straight into the clouds.

---

### Female Immortal Zhang Liying’s Stone Drum Song

Stone drum, stone drum,  
Alas, the lower earth!  
Since I came to observe,  
The people’s lives are truly bitter.

Alas, the world’s affairs,  
My thoughts stretch endlessly,  
My thoughts cannot be insulted,  
The king’s power cannot be taken.

My will has phoenix and dragon,  
I sing and dance myself,  
Soaring through clouds and rivers,  
Far surpassing worldly nets.

Children of the world, how can they compare to me?  
Briefly coming to meet,  
Fate diverges immediately.

Father, mother,  
My heart is deeply wounded.

---

### Han Early Childhood Ballad

Wearing a blue skirt,  
Entering the Heavenly Gate,  
Saluting the Golden Mother,  
Bowing to the Wood Lord.

At that time, all people did not know,  
Only Zhang Zifang knew,  
Then went to pay homage, saying:  
“This is the Jade Child of the Eastern King Father.  
It is said immortals who attain dao ascend to heaven,  
Saluting the Golden Mother and bowing to the Wood Lord.  
None but the child who has entered the void and attained truth knows this ford.”

---

### Poem by E Lühua to Yang Quan

The divine mountain pierces the sky,  
Flying peaks rise a thousand fathoms.  
Vastly enclosing the spirit valley void,  
Jade forests flourish lush and dense.

Yang was born marked by beauty and grace,  
At weak adulthood flowing clear sound.  
Dwelling feelings at the solemn ferry,  
Surpassing form and image at Wei forest.

Raising colors within the vermilion gates,  
Inside and out surpassing the worldly mind.

---

### Second Poem

I and the master’s clan,  
Share the same deep pool source.  
Great lineage divides upper tasks,  
Now each is a different branch.

Orchid and gold because of fondness,  
Three benefits just now felt more.

---

### Third Poem

Quietly seeking joy in this meeting,  
Elegantly weaving longevity’s mulberry.  
Who says the hidden mirror is hard?  
To obtain it is to hold it in the square inch.

Longing beyond the cage,  
All become mountain and rock scholars.  
Do not let soaring wings rise,  
Following the startled wind.

Though transformation is by human will,  
The fenced sheep are not easily matched.  
What is hoped for is not morning splendor,  
But year’s end with my son.

---

### Poem by Jiuhua Lady An to Yang Siming

Cloud gates firm above the empty sky,  
Jade terraces towering and lush.  
Purple palace rides green light,  
Spirit pavilion dense and lofty.

Jade pavilion within vermilion rooms,  
Highest virtue shines crimson haze.  
Looking down washing the spirit bottle ferry,  
Looking up gathering azure flowers.

Washing feet in the jade heavenly pool,  
Beating and planting the Cowherd River.  
Thus steering the radiant clouds’ chariot,  
Lowering dragon reins at the mysterious ridge.

Shaking clothes at the edge of dust,  
Lifting skirts stepping the muddy waves.  
Wishing to form bonds with mountains and marshes,  
Firmly yielding to softness and harmony.

Together carrying double clarity within,  
Upright true dao not crooked.  
Purple Tenuity gathers good counsel,  
Singing to accept and enjoy abundant blessings.

---

### Second Hymn

Riding suddenly from Western Splendor,  
No waiting, yet waiting in between.  
Sometimes gazing at the Five Mountain peaks,  
Sometimes washing at the Heavenly River ford.

Releasing wheels, seeking the void boat,  
Wherever all is entangled.  
From mustard seed to ten thousand acres,  
Within is Kunlun Mountain.

Small and large are no different,  
Near and far share the same cause.  
That which is to come depends on waiting,  
I am the original waiting kin.

---

### Poem of Lady Zhonghou Wang

Dragon banners dance the great void,  
Flying wheels over the Five Mountain ridges.  
Everywhere all is carefree,  
With feelings stirring dark songs.

No waiting is like waiting,  
Meeting thus gains harmony.  
Vast waves are not enough to roam,  
The mysterious well is not too many.

Dense and lofty seeking steps,  
All gather the four seas net.  
How is it better than beyond brightness,  
Only after three kalpas is one passed.

---

### Second Poem

Eight roads meet without root,  
Riding fate observing the noisy net.  
Transforming floating dust’s midst,  
Loosening collar with the daoist family.

Gazing at smoke suddenly not toppling,  
Carrying truth to the spirit ridge.  
Empty scenes coil the jade pavilion,  
Mysterious Jun composes phoenix songs.

The path has no tracks or hindrance,  
Divine sounds dance on cloud waves.  
Together virtue shows jade radiance,  
Why need the world’s abundance?

---

### Third Poem

Only observe the simple heavenly truth,  
Leaving burdens, letting go of passions.  
Body silent, abandoning contrivances,  
Exalting being, thus preserving life.

How to reach the equalizing son,  
Entrusting fate, following what passes.

---

### Fourth Poem

Ascending steps, departing Eastern Splendor,  
Fanning gale, dancing the great mystery.  
Flying reins soar ninety thousand,  
Eight falls also balanced.

Briefly gazing at mountain and water bounds,  
Graceful among the spirit peaks.  
Together wind harmonizes qi,  
Dao’s reason is thus.

Dragon ganoderma seeks distant longevity,  
Inner observation holds heavenly truth.  
Eastern peak may long remain still,  
Why be entangled by things?

---

### Poem by Lady Fangzhang Yizhao Ling Li

Cloud walls gird the heavenly branches,  
Seven qi shine the divine support.  
Jade gates open morning calls,  
Nine sounds at the crimson pivot.

Purple haze and vermilion gates,  
Fragrant smoke arises at green windows.  
Four chariots dance tiger banners,  
Blue car flings the mysterious void.

Splendid canopy follows clouds in array,  
Falling phoenix controls six dragons.  
Steering the radiant Five Mountain ridges,  
Three pure glance at the lord’s chamber.

Just now hearing the agitated filthy qi,  
Ten thousand turbid pollute my chest.  
Foul things smoke the spirit,  
Noisy dust clashes mutually.

Bright jade all splendid,  
Why alone can I flourish?  
Bowing deeply, bitter for not earlier,  
Sitting on the ground, worms arise.

---

### Second Poem

Drinking wine watching myriad wisdom,  
Suddenly drinking the four fall cycles.  
Unaware of the reason why,  
Truly not wandering with waiting.

Meeting all is joy,  
Not meeting also no worry.  
Casting shadows in the mysterious void,  
Two meetings naturally aligned.

---

### Third Poem

Flying wheels at the high morning terrace,  
Controlling reins at the mysterious ridge corner.  
Hands hold the purple emperor’s robe,  
Suddenly the eight winds drive.

Jade splendor wings green curtains,  
Blue skirt fans the emerald skirt.  
Crowned pavilion shines with ghostly brilliance,  
Wearing tinkling moon beads.

Thinly entering wind and dust,  
Blocking nose escaping the impure.  
Foul and fishy wither my qi,  
Hundreds of evils make the heart’s root.

Why not rise like a gale,  
Rustling stepping the great void?

---

### Poem by Lady of the Southern Pole King Bestowing to Yang Xi

Controlling gale fanning the great void,  
Eight scenes fly the clear brightness.  
Looking up floating beyond the purple dawn,  
Looking down at the absolute fall of the Qi.

Mysterious heart empty in the same space,  
Up and down neither flowing nor stopping.  
No waiting between the two extremes,  
Waiting has no place to act.

Bodyless thus able to die,  
Bodyful thus preserves life.  
Eastern guest joins the high song,  
Two waitings are not worth contesting.

---

### Second Poem

Commanding the jade brocade wheel,  
Dancing reins, looking up and wandering.  
Morning roaming the vermilion fire palace,  
Evening feasting at the night light pool.

Floating scenes clear at rosy cloud’s edge,  
Eight dragons just uneven.  
I roam without waiting,  
Waiting always follows.

High assembly beautiful people rest,  
Two waitings mutually right and wrong.  
Being and non-being are not fixed,  
Waiting and waiting each returns.

---

### Third Poem

Forest shakes, must resemble feeling,  
Clouds dense awaiting dragon’s roar.  
Mysterious numbers seek each other,  
Touching rhythms all have sound.

Flying chariot leaves Western Splendor,  
Total reins suddenly come seeking.  
Eight directions not without joy,  
Together chanting principle with respect.

Mourning within these four dimensions,  
Hundred worries always in heart.  
All roam the Northern Cold Terrace,  
Spirit winds open your chest.

---

### Poem of Lady of the Purple Tenuity King

Riding gale to welcome the Nine Heavens,  
Resting reins at the Three Elegant Peaks.  
Waiting wandering and looking,  
No waiting firmly still.

Vast waves why labor,  
Who surpasses the mysterious well?

---

### Another Chant

Turtle gate towering high,  
Wall terrace drops moon pearls.  
Seated in the nine spirit chambers,  
Knocking bells, chanting the great void.

Jade flute harmonizes my spirit,  
Golden nectar releases my sorrow.

---

### Another Chant

Feasting deeply within Eastern Splendor,  
Presenting Jun’s thousand hundred sounds.  
Blue lord calls me to rise,  
Bowing low hoping for the forest courtyard.

Feathered robe fans emerald radiance,  
Jade pendants clang and ring.  
All point to the high morning hall,  
Promising to meet in the dark image.

---

### Another Account of the Mysterious Ridge’s Roaming Chant

Surpassing steps the crimson clouds,  
Flying gale to the northern ridge courtyard.  
Divine splendor reflects the immortal terrace,  
Round brightness tilts with the wind.

Opening radiance embracing cinnabar origin,  
Gate scene feasting on moon essence.  
Intertwined in cloud forest cosmos,  
Vast chariot returns to childlike infancy.

Rustling sending to no abode,  
Right and wrong how can they scheme?  
World’s net troubles itself in competition,  
How can one speak of nurturing life?

---

### On the Evening of the Sixth Day of the Ninth Month, at Yunlin, Another Command Descended to Yang Junran to Compose a Chant

Loosening wheels above the great rosy clouds,  
Drawing reins to the purple hill.  
Hands grasp the eight qi,  
Leaping body floats in the void.

One glance at the dao’s net,  
Again seeking the high fields.  
Dao’s essentials already this,  
Able to dissolve a thousand worries.

Seeking truth, gaining good friends,  
Not leaving, what more to seek?

---

### Chant to Show to Chief Clerk Xu and Xi Fang, Then Another Chant

Purple void bright mysterious scene,  
Mysterious palace girded by the crimson river.  
Crowded and splendid Upper Clarity rooms,  
Spirit platform shining towering.

Eight carriages build the vermilion pool,  
Feathered canopy tilts sky branches.  
Thunder winds turn the three mornings,  
Golden bells scatter jade splendor.

Seven reins descend the nine terraces,  
Feasting and gazing, no need for home.  
May I ask the seeker of the dao,  
Why sit amid the dust waves?

How can one dwell in Eastern Splendor,  
Nourishing truth, gathering great harmony?

---

### Also Commanded to Show to Xu and Xi on the Eighteenth Day of the Tenth Month, Then Descended to Yang Jun to Write

Left holding the jade canopy,  
Flying scene treads the seven origins.  
Three mornings shine with purple radiance,  
Refining gaze, stroking the bright truth.

Changing leaps expected in a moment,  
All four sides already divine.  
Spirit issues without boundary,  
Diligently pondering Upper Clarity’s text.

Why sit on the crooked path,  
Causing you to be touched but not focused?  
Yin illness loses mysterious mechanism,  
Unaware years and months divide.

---

Xu said to Yang:  
“Those who are diligent diligently do their work,  
Approaching its mysterious subtlety alone.  
The cautious also touch categories and create.  
The difficulty of learning the dao cannot be written.  
Those with shame and contempt for it,  
Are also far from the dao.  
Only after irrigation and grasping is it precious.  
The worthy raise their eyes and begin anew,  
Now is the time to forget within.”

Thus chanting:

Mysterious clarity faintly watching,  
Falling radiance arises in the east.

May I gain dustless friends,  
Rustling, rare in worldly affairs.

---

### Chanting This Again and Again, Then Saying

Numinous person hides on the mysterious peak,  
True person cloaks clouds and comes.  
Mysterious chant is not without time,  
Wondrous response naturally has waiting.

Who expected the empty void’s silence,  
Ultimate rhyme surely always present.  
Taking sleeves, ascending the feathered palace,  
Together feasting within the vast cold.

May I ask who the companions are,  
Those remaining only the jade maiden.

---

### Ending Chant

The swift cloud of Xu’s steed,  
Spreading wings above Kongtong peak,  
This person, is it not long drawing southward,  
Seeking to thank the thousand chariots?

---

### Chant on the Thirtieth Day of the Second Month

Armored robes cross the green river,  
Thus meeting Lord Fusang.  
High assembly at the great forest ruin,  
Enjoying feasts in the mysterious splendid palace.

If the dao is pure and sincere,  
Why not dwell on the Eastern Peak?

---

### On the Fourteenth Day of the Fourth Month, Seven Verses Composed

Controlling the scene, beginning to wave the ford,  
Flying gale ascending Upper Clarity.  
Cloud terraces towering high,  
Palace gates elegant jade city.

Morning winds drum cinnabar clouds,  
Vermilion smoke sprinkles the golden court.  
Green leaves gather on the mysterious peak,  
Purple ganoderma grows beneath the cliff.

Celebratory clouds entwine the cinnabar furnace,  
Refining jade flying eight jades.  
Feasting and gazing in the vast cold palace,  
Countless kalpas increasingly childlike.

Dragon banners open the spirit lightning,  
Tiger banners summon vermilion troops.  
High true ones return the nine luminaries,  
Cave vision equally hidden and bright.

Who can step the hidden path,  
Seeking my endless longevity?

---

### Second Verse

Dim and dense the Purple Tenuity pavilion,  
Lofty terrace scatters scene gales.  
Phoenix sings among splendid canopies,  
Phoenix bells guide the dragon court.

Eight wolves carry crimson banners,  
White tiger blows horn and flute.  
Clouds surge painting the spirit palace,  
Coming to meet the dust’s clamor.

Loosening reins where the beautiful one stands,  
Like spirits naturally calling each other.  
Seeking the lineage in a moment,  
Ten thousand years is but one morning.

Kalpa’s time meets and fades,  
Passing kalpas how can they be vast?  
True ones truly watch each other,  
Do not let the heart wander astray.

Empty blade swings to the void,  
Despising stagnation, five spirits grieve.

---

### Third Verse

Morning opens Eastern dawn,  
Flying chariot crosses the vast sea.  
Mountain waves shake the blue shore,  
Eight winds fan mysterious smoke.

Returning paths easily change,  
Longing for true feelings.  
Three golds can roam the tray,  
Eastern peak suitable for eternal refinement.

Scattered on the way,  
Who can step the birth ford?

---

### Fourth Verse

Floating and drifting the eight rosy ridges,  
Wandering, flying the morning canopy.  
Purple chariot soars the great void,  
Sun shining beyond the nine voids.

Jade flute strikes the scene clouds,  
Spirit smoke cuts off the deep gloom.  
High immortals feast in the great truth,  
Clear chants without boundary.

Coming and going among mountain and courtyard,  
What cause for treatment?

---

### Fifth Verse

Divine jade shines the spirit ford,  
Seven origins illuminate the divine gate.  
Empty moving within the square inch,  
One leap ascends the Supreme Subtle.

Wondrous sounds ride harmonious chants,  
High assembly also has opportunity.  
Together these heavenly and human glances,  
Coordinating those morning scenes flying.

Total reins beyond the six directions,  
How could there be collapse or danger?

---

### Sixth Verse

Thinly feasting on the dusty gale ridge,  
Changing and returning, fate also returns.  
How to know the spirit kalpa’s time,  
Looking back makes one sad.

---

### Seventh Verse

Cloud grass shades the mysterious square,  
Looking up feeling the revolving radiance.  
Flourishing and abundant sprouts,  
Great virtue surely prospers.
