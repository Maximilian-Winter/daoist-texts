## The Numinous Hymn of the Assembly of Immortals

### The Azure Radiance Hymn of Deliverance from Suffering

#### Early Morning Court

The Heavenly Venerable issues a vow of great compassion,  
To rescue suffering beings across myriad directions, transforming causes into goodness.  
The Five Sacred Mountains and Four Offices all receive the mandate,  
While Fengdu’s northern palace halts all punishments.  

True talismans descend, granting universal pardon,  
Child attendants proclaim salvation for sinners.  
The Primordial transforms into a wondrous true form,  
Delivering countless souls, the dao of liberation fulfilled.

#### Noon Court

The Heavenly Venerable swears to ferry all living beings,  
Preaching the dharma adorned, seated in the jeweled forest.  
The lion’s nine heads divide auspicious signs,  
A beam of wisdom illuminates and clears the shadowed depths.  

Mountains of blades and trees of swords all shatter,  
Flames, winds, thunder—all cease and still.  
Infinite great compassion comes to rescue and ferry,  
Fengdu’s hells all gaze and listen in reverence.

#### Evening Court

The Heavenly Venerable’s wisdom power rescues the enfolded spirits,  
Seeking suffering, breaking the iron fortress.  
Broad salvation at the primal border follows vows,  
Radiance universally shines, reaching shadowed shoulders.  

The fan of wisdom blows away fiery smoke,  
Dharma rain moistens, bringing decay to bloom.  
Infinite mercy rescues all without exception,  
Lost souls all receive the face of the Compassionate One.

### The Farewell of Lady Taizhen to Master Ma Mingsheng

Temporarily resting within the city walls,  
I command my carriage to the sacred Mount Dai.  
Looking up to the palace of Great Clarity,  
Cloud towers rise, majestic and rugged.  

Within the void dwells a true person,  
Coming and going amid myriad blossoms.  
Refining the form to preserve the natural,  
Bowing and raising, drawing from the Great Harmony.  

Every morning the Nine Heavenly Kings,  
Return each evening to the Western Splendor.  
Essence flows, able to soar and ascend,  
Breathing in and out to nurture the azure teeth.  

The supreme elixir is not metal or stone,  
The wind sings naturally its own song.  
Ascending and descending beyond the bright firmament,  
Feathered robes dance with graceful ease.  

The Five Sacred Mountains are no mere concubines,  
The Mysterious Capital is my true home.  
Looking down on the bustling sons of glory,  
They are as earnest as frogs and toads.  

Glancing at the dusty turbid world,  
Worries and troubles entangle themselves.  
If one has not awakened to the subtle meaning,  
What use is carving and polishing?  

Calamities gather from the Dao’s leak,  
But careful caution brings abundant blessings.  

In ancient times, born in the Kunling Palace,  
We jointly discussed the extension of heavenly years.  
Though golden liquid may be distant,  
It cannot compare to the immortals of Great Harmony.  

Looking up, I ascend the Mysterious Immortal Terrace,  
In empty thought, chanting the numinous ones.  
Suddenly I meet the King of Fusang,  
The nine elders of the immortal capital, true and pure.  

Driving a purple dragon carriage,  
Their numinous faces so fresh and bright.  
They open the way for my long and gentle journey,  
Inviting me to the natural ferry.  

They teach the art of vast flight,  
Grant the jade embryo scripture.  
Jade ointment condenses the mysterious breath,  
The White Maiden arranges it for me.  

Bowing, I draw in the phoenix’s essence,  
Looking up, I ascend the Three Heavens.  
The cloud strands guide my steps,  
The Five Sacred Mountains I may briefly circle.  

The Mysterious Capital is not far,  
Penglai lies beneath my feet.  
Passing on and receiving with mutual love,  
Binding friends as heavenly beings.  

Replacing wandering punishment with confrontation,  
Calamity surely spares the wise and foolish alike.  
If secret, one enjoys without loss,  
If leaked, body and life overturn.  

— Lady Youying of the Cloud Forest

### The Farewell of Master Xu to Immortal Yang

Suddenly mounting, I roam the Eight Voids,  
Returning to feast in the Eastern Splendor chamber.  
The Mother of the Altar extends the pavilion,  
I shout aloud, treading the numinous wind.  

I come because there is awaiting,  
Thus I cross the Canglang waters.  
Leaping and soaring through cloud vistas,  
Floating to gaze upon the rosy sky above.  

The sky chariots dance in all directions,  
Purple canopies bear the numinous square.  
Crimson smoke entwines banners and standards,  
Feathered robes fan the fragrant breeze.  

Thunder roars like fierce beasts,  
Lightning chants, stirring the mysterious dragon.  
Harmonious music echoes in the Kun Court,  
Golden bells ring the divine chimes.  

Gathering the spirit herb of Canglang,  
Plucking flowers on the Eight Pure Peaks.  
Crimson countenance renews daily,  
Calamities past now become a child again.  

Nurturing the form in quiet Eastern heights,  
The seven spirits communicate among themselves.  
Dust and sorrow bring worries and grief,  
Falling upon my white-haired elder.  

Long darkness leaves distant sighs,  
Regret for not escaping earlier.  
Halting my carriage, I watch the moving moon,  
Turning wheels, returning to Canglang.  

At last I see such a person roam,  
Wondering how to find health and peace.  
Good causes await youthful spring,  
To recount the heart’s forgetting.  

Controlling the light, floating purple smoke,  
Viewing the eight scenes along the Fen River.  
Feathered youths hold jade nectar,  
Jade blossoms send off the precious essence.  

We agree to meet at White Water’s edge,  
Raising my drooping pearls.

### The Eastern Chamber Glows with Dawn

Purple clouds form floating crimson morning,  
Twin virtues uphold the Dao’s ancestry,  
Establishing the true elder’s domain.  

The Eight Terraces await the eye,  
Looking north where the flying noose lies.  
Pure and tranquil, viewing from the clouds,  
Dimly treading the shifting light.  

Breathing in the cavern’s mountain beauty,  
Hiding radiance in the Eastern Hills.  
Long peace above human affairs,  
Not a moment wasted each day.  

How unlike the easy yielding of matter,  
Instead this is the child’s countenance.  

---

### Morning Palace of Great Dawn

Jade chambers rise into the clear sky,  
Reciting briefly the three wondrous sights,  
Floating scenes soar beyond the dark.  

Elixir blossoms in empty air,  
Gold reflects nurturing essence.  
The eight winds drum brocade robes,  
Jade trees shine with four spirits.  

The floral canopy shades orchid light,  
Purple reins guide the green chariot.  
Binding trust to divine friendship,  
Touching correspondences, leading heavenly sincerity.  

Why be moved by outward forms?  
One must behold the jade and gem.  

---

### The Three Scenes Bloom Profoundly

The sky reflects bright in eight directions,  
Red clouds float above the high palace,  
Carefree, riding the numinous wind.  

Beating wings ride the white gale,  
Gazing upward from the jade terrace.  
Green canopy enters the morning harmony,  
Blue chariot casts itself through the void.  

Bowing to the Eastern Forest Emperor,  
Attending court to the Vast Void Sovereign.  
Jade attendants split phoenix brains,  
Drunkenly flying the medicinal nectar.  

Cloud music swirls in winding chambers,  
Thousands of tones ring clear and bright.  
Brocade banners summon fierce beasts,  
Floral flags dip and rise.  

The fragrant mother bends waist to sing,  
Purple smoke fills beams and rafters.  
Reins held high at the clear palace,  
Unbinding the carriage at the lovely chamber.  

---

### In Former Days, My Flight Was Yet Unborn

Numinous transformations follow the breath,  
The heart senses the mysterious horizon,  
Years accumulate as the cypress grows tall.  

Form’s dirt and bitter stench,  
Movement and stillness lose the Canglang.  
My friends are truly not so,  
Yesterday’s glory and shame already forgotten.  

Crimson scenes float in the mysterious dawn,  
Purple pavilions ride smoky journeys.  
Looking up beyond the green palace,  
Looking down upon the vermilion fire city.  

Eastern dawn opens broad radiance,  
Divine light shines with seven spirits.  
Shadows flicker, three candles glow,  
Flowing freely, all equal in the dark.  

Winds entwine the empty void,  
Fragrant sounds strike rhythm.  
Hands hold the Weaver Maiden’s dance,  
Together in the gourd vine courtyard.  

Turning left, the azure feathered banner,  
Floral canopy tilts with the clouds.  
Feasting and resting nine times above,  
Right and wrong do not concern me.  

Drawing true rest in great stillness,  
Golden form grows ever young.  
How unlike the foul and filthy midst,  
Bleak and lonely, without joy.  

Four banners shine bright in the sky,  
Vermilion pavilions fly to numinous hills.  
Jade canopies respond to seven scenes,  
Beating wings float high in the sky.  

Nine tones ring clear in purple space,  
Jade bowls echo the great void.  
Feasting and chanting in the Three Morning Palaces,  
Singing and calling my fellows.  

Unaware the cypress has already come,  
How could I know the two scenes flow?  
Though the lovely ones forget me too,  
They have not yet released all a hundred worries.  

The long forest truly can be still,  
Within the rocks there is much delight.

### Ascending the Mysterious True Palace in the North

Hand in hand, binding the lofty net,  
Fragrant smoke disperses in eight scenes,  
Mysterious winds drum the crimson waves.  

Looking up beyond the Lang Garden ferry,  
Looking down upon the sky ridge pass.  
Jade flute plays above the clouds,  
Phoenix cries stir the nine distant realms.  

Riding qi, floating in the vast sky,  
Why tread the mountain pass?  
Golden baton commands feathered spirits,  
Leading troops to break ten thousand demons.  

Together drawing in the two morning lights,  
A thousand springs just budding teeth.  
Losing truth, thrown into the competing chamber,  
Unaware what to do.  

Looking up to the Great Dawn Palace,  
Golden pavilions shine purple and clear.  
Floral chambers reflect the Great Origin,  
Four pavilions all vermilion jade.  

Casting wheels at the cavern ferry,  
Holding reins, dancing the green chariot.  
Jade blossoms fly the cloud canopy,  
Western consorts wield brocade banners.  

Suddenly the dusty turbid shore,  
Swiftly to the lovely ones’ courtyard.  
Past feelings respond truly descending,  
Those summoned are already in the dark.  

Riding wind, playing the morning sky,  
Together reveling in the cinnabar forest urn.  
Dukes and marquises are mere shadows,  
How could they know the numinous true?  

At dawn drawing in the crimson glow,  
Gathering qi to roam the sky.  
Turning the chariot, treading winding waves,  
At last seeing the world’s worries.  

The farewell words arise lush and grand,  
Not dispersing the three splendid ants.  
How about patrolling the mysterious village,  
Playing the jade bowl for your delight?  

Your heart’s peace has no bounds,  
My wish is to have no middle or end.

### Reins of Light Ascend the Morning Sky

Roaming and feasting at the Canglang official’s place,  
Colorful clouds circle the cinnabar dawn,  
Numinous aura disperses into the void.  

The Supreme True chants in the jade chamber,  
High immortals sing in the jade room.  
Nine phoenixes sing vermilion notes,  
Empty rhythms clash with feathered bells.  

Resting together in the golden court,  
Binding friends in the dark.  
Together drawing jade nectar at the ferry,  
Suddenly becoming a child again.  

How could the road crouch and halt?  
Calamities rise daily.  

Morning roaming the Great Origin Palace,  
Controlling the chariot to view the Jade River,  
Evening feasting in the lush supreme cosmos,  
Morning gathering the round scene flowers.  

Plucking jade bowls at the Northern Cold Terrace,  
Seven spirits shine purple clouds.  
Gathered high immortals rise,  
Swarming amid the dust.  

Lingering in the noisy splendor,  
Calamities and burdens should not be many.  

Riding qi, galloping the cloud chariot,  
Morning ascending the Great Calm Hill.  
Crimson ferry links peaks and shakes,  
Clear waves drum the deep flow.  

Stepping the void to view nine latitudes,  
Eight principles all traversed.  
Briefly feasting on three golden blossoms,  
Coming to see the companions of ambition.  

Diligent and unhidden,  
Thus accumulating a hundred worries.  

Crossing waves, surpassing Canglang,  
Suddenly arriving at the Golden Mountain.  
Looking around, roaming all day,  
Rarely meeting my cloud people.  

Purple palace built in the void above,  
Mysterious pavilion piercing the fierce gale.  
Jade and gems spread the numinous garden,  
Flowers born, forming jade and precious stones.  

Galloping the chariot at Canglang ferry,  
Eight winds stir the cloud music.  
Spreading feathers, fanning northern shadows,  
Grasping baton, sounding golden flute.  

Phoenix music harmonizes a thousand bells,  
Western youths sing morning songs.  
Heart open beyond emptiness,  
Spirit robe how bright and vast.  

Turning dance on the sky ridge,  
Six qi moves deep and dark.  
My path how could it be sought,  
So you never wither.  

Mysterious waves stir the vast tides,  
Great ferry drums ten thousand flows.  
Riding light, looking to six voids,  
Thinking to roam with lovely ones.  

Wondrous songs do not answer me,  
Clear sounds whom can I cast?  
In clouds riding jade wheels,  
Why rush in the dust?  

Pine □ grows on the mysterious ridge,  
Dense like cold forest’s ruggedness.  
Flourishing blossoms adorn the ice,  
Unwilling to fear the white snow.  

In chaotic times, hidden deep valleys,  
Roaming life’s dao always pure.  
Flying this free rein wheel,  
Casting to that distant person’s track.  

Dukes and marquises come and go,  
Why cannot they sever?  

---

### Pure Struggle Wishes for Eastern Mountain

Shading light, resting in numinous cave,  
Quiet and peaceful in the empty courtyard,  
Shading dense blue-green forest.  

Round brightness reflects the southern pavilion,  
Vermilion winds fan the secluded chamber.  
Bowing within the idle room,  
We agree to open subtle arts.  

Clear and distant thoughts of mystery,  
Desolate spirit heart at ease.  

Letting heart roam the empty ferry,  
Refining reins, guiding the vermilion chariot.  
Lovely ones come, why so late?  
First virtue, when will it be fulfilled?  

Parables surely can be used,  
Not using them is heartless.  
How to suddenly mount the carriage,  
Seeking this void’s numinous?  

Subtle sounds truly have meaning,  
Use them carefully, do not lightly.  
Matters respond to divine opportunity,  
Protecting you to see great peace.

### Reins of Light Descend at Canglang

Leaping at the Blue Sea ferry,  
Crimson smoke stirs the sun,  
Feathered canopy tilts the nine heavens.  

Cloud chariot floats through the void,  
Suddenly between Canglang waters.  
Coming to seek true friends,  
Together attending the Emperor’s morning.  

Jade sons harmonize bright virtue,  
Joining heads to summon jade worthies.  
Looking down on the Eight Rivers Palace,  
Lying down atop the Hope Forest peak.  

Rinsing this purple jade essence,  
Then knowing the bitterness of the filthy path.  
Where will the lovely ones be?  
Diligence alone brings closeness.  

Crimson palace spreads wide in the sky,  
Unfolding cinnabar, ascending the scene chamber.  
Purple flags shake cloud and mist,  
Feathered morning dances the eight winds.  

Stopping the canopy, raising the blue creek,  
Gathering blossoms on the Moon Branch peak.  
Chewing the three spirit flowers,  
Breathing out the nine divine rays.  

Cypress numbers without end,  
Joining sun to accumulate childhood.  
Joining sleeves at the True Pavilion,  
Looking up to the Supreme Sovereign.  

Northern balance sings feathered ones,  
Jade mystery shines among the worthy crowd.  
Sound ends. How can the wave and void,  
Gain or lose be my bell?  

Raising neck within the noisy courtyard,  
Opening heart to the filthy rush.  
Practicing in the domain of honor and shame,  
Rarely treading the Hope Forest palace.  

One stillness is enough hardship,  
Try leaving to see Canglang.  

---

### Worldly Treasures and Fragrant Blossoms Intertwined

The Dao’s ancestry meets the mysterious firmament,  
Shaking robes to seek the true field,  
Turning the carriage at the wind and dust boundary.  

Good virtue reflects mysterious radiance,  
Outstandingly gathering splendid flowers.  
Secret words repay much blessing,  
Stillness and emptiness value truth.  

Always follow the two images in order,  
Hand in hand, sharing the collar and belt.  
Why in human affairs,  
Daily arise harm and calamity?  

There is one who promises the axe-bearer,  
Saying he will gather the five spirit herbs.  
Spirit grasses need not be obtained,  
You also cannot come.  

If you come, you should obtain,  
Spirit grasses and your food.

### The Scripture of Wisdom by the Supreme Ultimate True Person

To learn immortality, abandon worldly thoughts,  
Moment by moment they accumulate in sequence.  
Coming and going disturb my spirit,  
The spirit restless, nothing escapes.  

Extinguish thought, stop in emptiness,  
Quietly entering the empty stillness.  
Please read the scripture as if hungry and thirsty,  
Hold your will like gold and stone.  

Protect your child flying the mysterious path,  
Five spirits ferry the talismanic records.  

Aid me in the six perfections,  
Thus able to unravel the three snares.  
Pure fasting honors the Great Origin,  
Breathing in and out nurtures the cloud teeth.  

Carefree within the Golden Palace,  
Jade Capital is my home.  
Naturally born are the seven treasures,  
Everyone sits on lotus flowers.  

Looking up, chewing the Mysterious Capital K,  
Looking down, containing the empty cavern reed.  
Countenance shines ten suns,  
Why count the many kalpas?  

The dharma drum summons heavenly immortals,  
The wailing bell calls the great demons.  

The numinous wind fans fragrant flowers,  
Splendidly opening the abundant robes.  
The Supreme True caresses the proud clouds,  
All immortals pluck the numinous zither.  

Elegant songs rise from the Three Heavens above,  
Scattering wisdom in the jade flower forest.  
The Seven Ancestors ascend the hall of blessings,  
From here stepping into the mysterious sound.  

Past lives’ virtue was insufficient,  
This scripture is distant and hard to find.  
Faith in the dao is never complete,  
Planning flight only sinks again.  

The Most High’s nonaction dao,  
Is widely spread in the seedling heart.  

Learning the dao through elixir faith,  
Serving the master like one’s closest kin.  
Bowing to the light, occasionally in pure emptiness,  
Diligently following daily renewal.  

If all have not attained liberation,  
They will never liberate me.  
Great vows have heavy rewards,  
Mysterious virtue fully believed.  

Yin evil sins reach deep,  
Facing the future like turning wheels.  

Learning the dao is very bitter,  
Morning and evening building fields of blessing.  
Plant virtue as planting trees,  
Deep roots bear abundant fruit.  

If you can indulge in the mysterious stillness,  
You will float up to the clear heavens.  
Cultivate this nonaction dao,  
And be sure to bind good affinities.  

The Most High widely spreads the supreme dao,  
Scriptures of wisdom chapters.  
Uprooting suffering through great talent,  
Surpassing the mundane to attain truth.  

Numinous form is rare in the world,  
Shining like a lotus in a deep abyss.  

People’s paths each have roots,  
All due to past life merit.  
Establish virtue in timely fashion,  
Make vows and never refuse.  

Good and evil both await response,  
Relying on principle is hard to exhaust.  
The worthy serve the dharma’s words,  
Dao and virtue lie in forgetting both.  

Understanding this is great wisdom,  
Above is the Supreme Ultimate Lord.  
The jeweled canopy links the jade carriage,  
Commanding the carriage to drive the nine dragons.  

Golden blossoms hold the cavern scripture,  
Offering incense, all are immortal youths.  
Whistling songs penetrate the Mysterious Capital,  
Striking jade, knocking the precious bell.

### The True Hymn by Wu Zi

I, humble Wu Zi,  
Know fate and entrust the true,  
Aspiring to the mysterious and simple,  
My heart delights in clear poverty.  

I roam the mountains,  
Alone as a fish in the water,  
My learning not yet clear on the dao,  
My form only preserves the spirit.  

Mountains and waters are my home,  
My form and shadow my neighbors.  
Wearing rough pelts and grass belts,  
Deer antlers and gauze scarves.  

Feeding on pine, drinking spring water,  
Passing through Shu and Qin,  
The Great Dao is vast and dark,  
Who is my master?  

Gazing downward on the lower earth,  
Thinking of those exalted guests,  
Endlessly without rest,  
No images, only kinship.  

All day in my thatched hut at leisure,  
The clear wind comes and goes.  
Ears free from worldly disturbances,  
Heart amused by idle clouds.  

Facing wine, I think only of the moon,  
Eating pine, never tiring of the mountains.  
Often chanting inner scenes,  
Naturally maintaining youthful countenance.  

This life, this thing, should be my way,  
White stones and green pines are my home.  

Lying beneath the moon and clouds like a wild deer,  
Often buying wine to drunkenly enjoy the rosy clouds.  

Solitary and quiet in my roaming,  
Alone and standing like a fish in water,  
Drinking the falling dew of magnolia,  
Wearing the fallen feathers of the crow.  

Seeking no profit in the human world,  
Renouncing fame in all under heaven,  
This is the way of a mountain-dwelling daoist.  

After writing, shaking my robes and arranging my staff,  
No one knows where I go.

### The Farewell of the Immortal to Bai Yongnian

In clear autumn with nothing to do,  
I ride the mist out to distant heavens.  
Relying on the woodcutter’s words,  
We agree to meet, Bai Yongnian.  

---

### Li Gong’s Poem to the Immortal Servant

I have a pearl in my robe,  
Not caring for dust on my clothes.  
I have the principle of longevity,  
Not weary of having a living body.  

The southern immortal cave,  
I shall blend with its truth.  
Not caring for marketplace ties,  
Coming to save the people of the world.  

Su Zi’s traces have passed,  
Zhuan Meng’s affairs are dear.  
Do not say the Eastern Sea changes,  
Heaven and earth have eternal spring.  

---

### Farewell Words of Ju Haoran and Le Yun

When traveling, clouds accompany me,  
Sitting, wine is my companion.  
My belly is filled with non-transformation,  
My clothes patched with clouds and rosy hues.  

Zhou’s cruelty and Yao’s benevolence,  
Alas, all are rotten and decayed.  

The boat needs no borrowing,  
Transcendent and true like a duckweed raft.  
Morning floats with the sun’s brilliance,  
Evening shades with the clear moonlight.  

Busy with worldly achievements,  
Rotten bones turn to mud and sand.  

Drinking Ju Gong’s wine,  
Again boarding Ju Gong’s boat,  
Thus gaining a pure spirit body,  
Transcending far, vast, and without worry.

### The Numinous Sound Hymn

This sound is not a valley echo,  
The heart knows it is a numinous immortal.  
Never leaving the ear’s enclosure,  
High and low like autumn cicadas.  

At night the sound urges,  
By day it is faint.  
Spirits repel all evil,  
With me they make a wind-like majesty.  

Wondrous sounds have no fixed time,  
Day and night constantly revolve.  
This is no chance event,  
A special envoy from the upper realm comes.  

How to discern numinous response?  
One must have the proper medium.  
Since the numinous sound descends,  
It is as if a true person arrives.  

Holding thought long in the heart,  
Turning and never ceasing sound.  
Pity the clear and cool night,  
Quietly listening to the autumn cicada’s chant.

### The Assembly of Immortals Steps into the Void

Floating and drifting on the cloud road,  
Dimly entering the long firmament.  
The star palaces recede daily,  
Time and kalpas stretch far.  

Looking up to the golden face hidden,  
Leaning thoughts waiting on the divine gale.  
Wishing to catch the rosy feather,  
Burning incense, bowing in court.  

Mysterious winds turn the flying canopy,  
Purple qi spreads the immortal chariot.  
Floating in the void without waiting for reins,  
Suddenly ascending into emptiness.  

Lingering mournfully over the lower realm,  
Looking back with compassion on all beings.  
The three origins’ true transformations complete,  
Swiftly entering the Great Void.  

Myriad qi float high in the void,  
A thousand lights join the Great Subtle.  
Between the skies, gazing at the floral canopy,  
The void’s weight looks upon the rosy robes.  

True rites enter the cloud road,  
Round brightness chases the wind’s flight.  
Wishing to gather the three origins,  
Golden visage rides the fate home.  

Auspicious light soars with purple qi,  
Sky roads escape to the cinnabar heavens.  
Banners wave, fragrant winds turn,  
Canopies move, surpassing floating smoke.  

The dao returns to the dao,  
The mystery returns to mystery.  
True light knows no boundary,  
The Great Dao ultimately has no form.  

The dharma wheel constantly turns,  
Rare sounds cannot be heard.  
In emptiness waiting for the Three Treasures,  
In the void hearing the Cavern Scripture.  

Seven transformations, wandering souls return,  
Myriad qi settle the declining years.  

Fragrant winds drift the feathered canopy,  
Wandering qi turns the whirlwind chariot,  
Clear and ringing up the cloud road,  
Dim and deep entering the long void.  

Looking with compassion on the dusty children,  
Following fate to reveal the numinous book.  
Wondrous fruits harmonize today,  
Dark contracts naturally sealed.  

---

### The Great Lord Qing Tong Often Chants

If you wish to plant the root of extinction and liberation,  
You must uproot the tree of birth and death.  
Sinking in thought, falling to the Nine Springs,  
Only sitting, pitying the form and frame.  

---

### Lady of the Southern Peak’s Composition to Master Xu

The numinous valley’s graceful waves entwine,  
Hiding the body, resting in the rock capital.  
Donning rough cloth like embroidered dragons,  
Wearing white like jade whistles.  

The form coils in the secluded vastness,  
Casting spirit in the Great Dawn courtyard.  
Above are worthy steps,  
In the void are true voices.  

Looking up, I fly the curved morning,  
Setting this green pavilion chariot.  
Looking down within the eight degrees,  
Sighing at the entangling dust and wind.  

Free from waves and billows,  
Ascending this distant body.  
Worries exhaust the three ferries,  
Galloping, cutting your years.  

---

### Lady of the Southern Peak’s Composition

Beyond mysterious feelings and wondrous images,  
Harmonious sounds summon themselves.  
Cloud writings cluster in purple dawn,  
Orchid winds fan the green chariot.  

The Supreme True feasts on the jade terrace,  
Far above the earthly immortal’s mark.  
What is hoped for is noble and transcendent,  
Thus able to shine outstandingly.  

Playing with the eight pure feathers,  
The dao completes the first six vastnesses.  
How can human affairs be anticipated,  
Causing your form and qi to vanish?
