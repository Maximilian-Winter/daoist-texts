## Supreme Clarity’s Radiant Flight of Sun and Moon Essence, Upper Scripture

Great indeed is the Palace of Seven Treasures, where lotus blossoms arise by nature’s grace.  
Its brilliance ignites the night’s radiance, faintly shimmering within the divine abode.  

Looking upward to the Mysterious True Terrace, clouded pavilions rise steep and grand.  
Flowing light dazzles the profound void, dispatching celestial troops to crush ten thousand demons.  

From the depths of suffering and guilt, fragrant buds accumulate and bloom.  
Praises chanted cross the seven ancestors, gathering blessings where virtue harmonizes.  

Most wondrously emerges the divine radiance, formless, silent, without shadow.  
Its borders sweep beyond all bounds, suddenly spreading universal salvation forth.  

Raising and delivering the seven profound sufferings, vast and clear, serene and enduring.  
Crossing the ferry of five agonies, one responds and ascends upon the clouds.  

The Lamp King shines through the Ten Directions, darkness vanquished, all made bright.  
Majestic is the Mysterious True Terrace, splendidly reflecting the Ten Directions.  

Boundless cold passes are released, difficult for many bodies to penetrate.  
The seven ancestors unravel the three paths, no longer trapped in worry and torment.  

Bowing in reverence to the Lamp King, I take refuge in the Eastern Brilliant Palace.  

I am the master of the sea vessel, thus able to ferry the three returns.  
Nightlight penetrates the hidden valleys, cleansing and opening body and mind.  

Vapor disperses to the Eight Extremes, shining brightly into the Supreme Subtle.  
I honor and chant the unsurpassed teaching; blessings and fortune tower high.  

Whirling winds bind and release, silent and full across the Eight Hills.  
Three pure ones give birth to shadowy clouds, empty light illuminating the Great Void.  

Cavernous vision reaches the utmost Ten Directions, carefree scattering of sorrow and worry.  

The flying wheel veils the vast heavens, formless and without trace.  
Its tracks fall as it wills, rustling softly into profound silence.  

Clad in humble robes, I chant the nightlight; the myriad heavens descend their gifts.  

Sin and blessing arise without fixed cause, near to the free human body.  
Accumulated merit and suffering are not many; morning and evening build fields of blessing.  

I return my life to the Way of Non-action, ultimately embodying the utmost truth.  
Radiant brilliance shines forth, clear and unbounded by shadowy edges.  

Glorious and dazzling beyond the dark realm, blessings descend and misfortunes shift.  
Schools and academies observe the Ten Directions, universally aiding all people.  

Strictly I hold the Mysterious True reins, hand in hand bearing the jade talisman.  
The bright lamp strikes the jade bell; the response echoes, entering the void.  

One gaze into the cavern of the Three Treasures, releasing my accumulated worldly obscurities.  

Lingering in the Palace of Seven Treasures, the revolving wheel curves the mountain’s embrace.  
Resting beneath the karmic canopy of the house, who knows how many years have passed?  

Mouth rinses with golden liquid essence, accumulating longevity to birth the lotus bloom.  
Those below vie in glory; yet they do not understand what to do.  

Mysterious radiance reflects the winding valley, clear and bright through abyssal springs.  
Light flows and thickens, weaving around the Jade Capital Mountain.  

The seven ancestors reverse birth in the womb, transcending and ascending into the seamless void.  

Luxuriant and shining, the pavilion beams, flourishing into the Supreme Clarity.  
Heavenly hunters flank left and right, the revolving wheel returns, tilting southward.  

Faintly beyond nine years, temporarily rising without awakening spirit.  
The seven ancestors attain fetal immortality, the Southern Palace receives rebirth anew.  

The flying wheel veils the empty cavern, gazing over thousands of fathoms.  

Principle and realization unify in response, five vapors inhale and scatter.  
The body is light and effortless, four lights respond to the scene’s judgment.  

The three evil paths of hell all find escape from their cages, difficult though it be.  

Whistling songs on the Nine Mysterious Terraces, cliffs and ridges wash the rushing ford.  
The heart awakens, six senses flow freely; the sun abandons dusty turbid confusion.  

Flowing rosy clouds shine on the golden chamber, the empty hall disperses numinous incense.  
Essence and feeling summon spiritual descent; form alone and the Way also divide.  

Suddenly gazing over myriad kalpas, how could one sense the cycles of countless longevity?  

The elegant garden flourishes on the divine steps, vermilion jade shines in the purple court.  
Flowing winds drum the empty cavern, jade horns veil the void’s ringing.  

Purple smoke entwines the curved eaves, cinnabar brilliance circles the green canopy.  
Flying essence thickens the mysterious canopy, feathered joints shine in Supreme Clarity.  

Clear vistas reach the Nine Harmonies’ border, roaming and playing in the wind city.  

Turning and floating over the Five Mountain ridges, reins loosen near the city walls’ embrace.  
Looking up to the Mysterious True Gate, clouded pavilions rise steep and grand.  

Fragrance returns, winding around the palace; bright lamps praise the numinous song.  

The neck bears the light of sun and moon, returning life to the Lamp King’s scripture.  
It bursts open and penetrates the Eight Extremes; lotus blossoms arise from this.  

The Dragon King holds the sea’s water, thus able to rinse the fragrant vase.  
The Brahmin receives this hymn, thereby ascending to heavenly birth.  

The human king receives this scripture, lifespan equal to ten thousand billion ages.  
Blessings extend to the seven ancestors, no longer troubled by worry or infantile pain.  

Future generations hold boundless causes, revering the worthy and pure in every age.

## Three Separate Hymns

### Hymn from the Southern Pole’s Purple Primordial Lady

Mysterious waves shake the vast blue tides, great ferries drum the myriad streams.  
Riding the light, gazing through the six voids, longing to roam with the true person.  

Wondrous chants do not answer me, clear tones find no one to cast them to.  
In the clouds I race the jade wheel; who is a companion in the dust below?  

White clouds merge with the numinous light, thick shadows enter the Supreme Subtle.  
Green reins bind the feathered wheel, emerald canopy chases the turning wind.  

Golden palaces open jade chambers, whirlwind terraces and jade pavilions arrayed.  
Extending my dragon carriage’s room, ascending the steps of the Void Sovereign.  

Though the body cycles through worldly transformations, the soul and spirit never briefly perish.  

Accumulated blessings and heavy karma, past vows now fully realized.  
Wondrous indeed is the empty wisdom; the true person contains the true emergence.  

Heavenly dragons cross fragrant ferries, washing and refining my fetal substance.  
Wondrous words—who will believe them? The spiritual appointment and mysterious summons complete.  

The Way-heart transcends the Three Realms, mingling to manifest the primal unity.  
Alone I realize the original formlessness, roaming freely in the great vehicle’s ease.
