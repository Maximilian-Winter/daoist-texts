## Supreme Clarity Cavernous Mystery Bright Lamp Supreme Scripture

The Great Subtlety is wondrously profound, shining through the farthest depths. It continues the mysterious radiance of the sun, unfolding the precious chapters of the bright lamp. It begins with Nature itself, receiving the essence of sun and moon’s brilliance. The clear light mingles with the faint twilight, scattering its radiance across the vast sky. There is no Heaven it does not pervade, no hidden place it does not illuminate, no boundary it does not mystify. Without the gathering of numinous excellence, the accumulation of merit over seven generations, this text cannot be glimpsed. Those who encounter it are treasured and encouraged.

Those who receive this scripture must bear the solemn oath of bright gold, blue, and jade, and it is conferred upon the sheer cliffs. If one lacks faith in the covenant or fails to practice accordingly, wandering souls should not rashly proclaim it. Those who earnestly desire to receive it must first announce their fast, only granting transmission upon signs of ethereal auspiciousness and spiritual response.

The Most High Patriarch of the Great Ultimate ascended the jade terraces of the Nine Heavens, bowed beneath the windowed pavilion, and respectfully asked the Venerable of the Purple Palace to open the gates of enlightenment and wisdom. With elbow steps and knee strides, as time passed by moments and hours, he then declared: “What you inquire is wondrous indeed. Now, by illuminating the seven mysteries to discern good and evil, I unfold the precious chapters of rites and recitations, revealing the scripture’s intent. Ascend the lofty heavenly ordinances, truly serene as the rosy clouds, raise it step by step, always veiled by mysterious clouds, guarded by flying dragons, with celestial soldiers and feathered cavalry ceaselessly on watch day and night. Adorned with lapis lazuli, pearls, and jade, radiantly shining—none but the Most High True One may glance upon these palace walls. To savor the void and mystery, to chew upon the flying roots, to open and expound the precious chapters, none surpass the fasting and thanksgiving rites. Among these, none excel the Supreme Clarity Cavernous Mystery: burning incense, kindling lamps, and reciting rites. The lamp method spaces the lamps one zhang and five chi apart, placing ten lamps upon a pole, orally declaring their meaning. The numinous thread of all lamps arrays a thousand lamps like solemn ceremony, expressing the measure of sincerity. The bright lamp symbolizes the stars, then the seven ancestors follow; their wondrous traces are hard to proclaim. Cultivate this for three years, and by day you shall ascend to Heaven.

The method of honoring lamps begins facing east, then west, then south, then north. Then, looking up to Heaven with heart in mind, one honors the center, following the true text’s recitation.

Those fasting together sing praises; behind the altar, incense and fire are strictly tended, clouds of smoke rising forward without ceasing. This method widely spreads, lifting souls from the suffering of dark nights, pardoning disasters of birth and death. Devout disciples, faithful adherents, whose families are afflicted by examinations or illnesses and desire to establish fasts to save themselves, should offer fragrant incense and pure oil, in any weight, measure, or quantity as they wish, diligently cultivating and striving. Those who fall short must use the incense and oil brought by the master to cover penalties and make up for shortcomings. Aspirants who cultivate the Dao, though days near and hopes swift, respond slowly and say the Dao is vast and unreal, “What of fate?” Since they cannot transcend the borders and peaks, how can the seven ancestors descend blessings? Retreating, they cannot extend at home to like-minded fasting lectures, always spinning wheels and racing swiftly, amusing themselves with wine’s clamor, opposing the profound teaching above, falling short of the ancestors below. They slaughter the three sacrifices to show filial piety—alas, how sorrowful! It makes my heart ache. When blessings vanish and calamities multiply, they blame the gods and the directions, praying in vain. This is like digging a well when thirsty—what use is it? The suffering of dead infants, the misery of descendants, even the hunger and sickness of children and grandchildren all arise from failing to practice merit and virtue in this life, entrusting transformation to thoughtlessness, indulging in reckless poison. Foolish and stubborn men hear the gentle admonitions like the wind’s cry to Heaven, the flight calls of pheasants and geese, yet laugh like dogs—how pitiful! They give but do not believe.

Those who desire longevity and preservation, to dispel disasters and cure illnesses, to cultivate great virtue, must reach the True, explain the seven mysteries, and know the Supreme Clarity’s great precepts on the reward and punishment for good and evil deeds, combined with rites and recitations; then disasters may be dispelled and the radiant Han may ascend.

The lamp ritual is essentially a rite of incantation alone; it is especially meant to bitterly and severely rescue those in distress, nothing is forbidden.

The Most High Patriarch said: When honoring the lamp king and performing the lamp ritual, the hymn is as follows:

---

Great indeed is the Seven Treasures Palace,  
Naturally born lotus blossoms,  
Brilliantly opening the night’s light,  
Suddenly ascending the grand rosy clouds.  

Looking up at the mysterious true gates,  
Cloudy towers rise rugged and lofty,  
Flowing brilliance shines in the mysterious sky,  
Summoning troops to conquer myriad demons.  

Extracting suffering from the net of hardship,  
Accumulated kalpas just budding teeth,  
Fasting lectures ferry the seven ancestors,  
Accumulated blessings nourish the aspirants’ homes.  

Supremely wondrous emerges divine radiance,  
Formless, silent, without shadow,  
Beyond borders and realms,  
Suddenly universally aiding all who go forth.  

Raising and ferrying the seven mysteries’ sufferings,  
Vast and clear to behold the serene stillness,  
Extracting and ferrying the five difficult hindrances,  
Responding to signs, riding clouds to ascend.  

The bright lamp penetrates the Ten Directions,  
Darkness and gloom are all illuminated,  
Radiant is the mysterious true hall,  
Glorious it reflects the Ten Directions.  

Vast and open, clearing blockages,  
Profoundly releasing all difficult bodies,  
The seven ancestors resolve the three realms,  
No more worries, vexations, or troubles.  

Green canopies reflect the Ten Directions,  
Flying and spreading through cloud waves,  
Divine lamps glow in the Nine Darknesses,  
Their light embraces mountain hollows.  

Brahmanic bodies in six assembly palaces,  
Generations upon generations become immortal homes,  
Void smoke all lodging causes,  
Blessings descend, dispelling myriad demons.  

Suffering souls respond and scatter,  
Ice parts from shifting sands.  
Accumulated calamities unknown to end,  
Is it but a single day’s fault?  

The seven ancestors bear this calamity,  
Long dwelling between rivers and seas,  
The Most High True One pities this suffering,  
With empty heart at the ninefold gates,  

Bowing and honoring the mysterious lamp,  
Ferrying names to the Eastern Flower Palace.

After the lamp king’s rite concludes, proceed with the nineteen hymns of the lamp ritual, as follows:

---

A thousand true ones bow before the jade gates,  
Brightly penetrating the cavernous void,  
Looking up to the uncreated honored one,  
Flying rosy clouds play among the clouds.  

Pure and serene without hindrance or difficulty,  
The body born with seven treasures’ light.  
I am the master of the sea vessel,  
Thus able to release the three nets.  

Night light reaches the hidden valleys,  
Suffering bodies are cleansed and opened,  
Void smoke disperses the eight extremes,  
Brightly shining into the Great Subtlety.  

Honoring and reciting the unsurpassed teaching,  
Blessings and fortunes truly majestic.  
Floating and falling, passing through,  
Silent and full over the eight hills.  

Three Qin birth cloud shadows,  
Void and nothingness twin great origins,  
Cavernous observation reaches the Ten Directions,  
Carefree scattering suffering bodies.  

Flying wheels fill the great sky,  
Formless and without trace,  
Letting the wheels fly at will,  
Rustling, surpassing beyond realms.  

Wearing rough cloth chanting night light,  
All heavens excel the great.  
Sin and blessing not by others,  
Measure freedom by your own body.  

If merit is not early accumulated,  
Morning and night build blessing fields,  
Return to the path of non-action,  
At last you shall see the true reality.  

Radiant brilliant light beams,  
Brightly penetrating without hidden corners,  
Glorious beyond the dark extremes,  
Blessings descend, accumulating and shifting.  

Schools and observatories watch the Ten Directions,  
Universally aiding all people.  
Strict is my mysterious true bridle,  
Hand in hand holding the jade tally.  

Bright lamp strikes the jade bell,  
Responding sounds obtained without fail,  
One day seeing the three attainments,  
Releasing my accumulated worldly worries.  

Advancing to the Seven Treasure officials,  
Returning wheels curve mountain hollows,  
Resting the carriage in the green canopy chamber,  
Who knows how many years have passed?  

Rinsing and inhaling golden liquid essence,  
Ten thousand kalpas just budding records,  
Looking down on glory and competition,  
Not understanding what to do.  

Mysterious radiance shines in curved valleys,  
Brightly penetrating deep springs,  
Freely shining through flowing lushness,  
Entwining and filling Feng Mountain.  

The seven ancestors rebirth from the womb,  
Chang’an’s five-colored palace.  
Luxuriant pavilion sky shines,  
Vigorous entering the Great Clarity.  

Heavenly hunters and left-right attendants,  
Wheels return to the southern tilt,  
Vague beyond nine years,  
Temporarily transcending stone to awaken spirit.  

The seven ancestors obtain fetal immortality,  
Southern palace again receives birth.  
Flying wheels fill the empty cavern,  
Gazing over thousands of fathoms.  

Principle and understanding harmonize in one sweep,  
Gathering smoke, inhaling and dispersing,  
Body light, form effortless,  
Four bright responses shine.  

Hell’s three evil paths,  
All freed from cages and bonds.  
Whistling songs on the Nine Mysterious Terraces,  
Lofty ridges condense chill.  

Heart and mind’s six senses flow freely,  
Abandoning dusty tangled ties,  
Flowing rosy clouds shine on golden chambers,  
Void halls scatter mysterious radiance.  

Accumulated feelings bring down spirits,  
Form alone, the Dao also divides,  
Suddenly glimpsing myriad kalpas,  
How could one perceive a hundred million springs?  

Beautiful gardens flourish on divine steps,  
Vermilion jade interwoven with jade flows,  
Wind drums empty like jade,  
Perching shadows, void phoenix cries.  

Purple smoke entwines curved buildings,  
Red radiance encircles green canopies.  
Flying banners flourish under mysterious covers,  
Feathered joints shine purple and clear.  

Clear scenery reaches the Nine Heavens’ border,  
Roaming and playing in the phoenix city,  
Looking back at glory and competition,  
One joy born together at court.  

Reining the carriage, controlling mysterious radiance,  
Evening scenery beyond the cavernous wilds,  
Wandering seeking spiritual people,  
Merging forms celebrating the firmament.  

Hands part the vermilion jade gates,  
Bright as divine surge of peace.  
Golden gates rise rugged and lofty,  
Clear shadows without dust or filth.  

Lowering banners on the mysterious Lang Terrace,  
Fitting my good wish meeting,  
Escaping and migrating the three realm hardships,  
Protecting refinement to strengthen old age.  

Wisdom arises from original nothingness,  
Brightly surpassing the Ten Directions,  
Binding emptiness, standing on mysterious clouds,  
All heavens draw fragrant flow.  

Its marvel is hard to think or imagine,  
Void feelings truly connect,  
Being and non-being all exist,  
Non-existence contains all.  

Wisdom constantly observes the body,  
The first step in learning the Dao,  
Faintly entering the mysterious market,  
Naturally recording my spirit.  

Heavenly Venerables always protect,  
Demon kings serve as guards,  
Shimmering Vajra body,  
Surpassing the Most High Immortal.  

Wisdom gives rise to roots of precepts,  
True Dao’s precepts as master,  
The Three Treasures thus arise,  
Revered and bestowed by the highest sages.  

Crossing this immortal boat,  
Suddenly ferrying great abundance,  
When speaking of precepts,  
All immortals come to bow.

## Hymn of the Great Subtle Heavenly Emperor Receiving Precepts

When seeing the bright lamp, all should recite this text, not only when receiving precepts and lighting lamps. Click the teeth softly to sound it, not letting others hear, all by mouth, teeth, and ears.

The Most High scatters the Ten Directions,  
Brilliant lamps connect pure sincerity,  
All heavens shine brightly,  
All lands are fully illuminated.  

My body also shines through,  
Five viscera born with radiant glory,  
Blazing light shines on the Great Void,  
Far thoughts multiply jade clarity.  

Elixir essence wondrous in Great Void,  
Mysterious yang echoes in the sky,  
Containing form, extinguishing roots of suffering,  
Profound and utmost true thought.  

Drooping blossoms do not show treasure,  
Due to conditions no shining image,  
My body is likewise,  
Riding transformation, entrusted to flowing light.  

Night light manifests yang elixir,  
Far shining into spiritual chamber,  
All heavens widely shine,  
All yin immediately extinguished.  

My spirit also is bright and clever,  
Always playing with wisdom and insight,  
Carefree fitting the Dao’s movement,  
Changing and yielding to Heaven’s force,  

Raising form, stepping the empty cavern,  
Night candles shine with flowing gathering.

---

The Great Subtle Heavenly Emperor said: Simply lighting lamps without knowing this recitation, the great demon palaces of the six heavens are but human death fate; the eight directions’ heavens will not send jade boys and jade girls; flying celestial beings will not descend upon you; the Ten Directions and Three Realms will not ferry your name to the Eastern Flower Southern Palace, nor accept your seven ancestors and grandparents’ transformation and birth Dao.

## Incantation for Offering Food to All Beings

Diligently cultivate the great Dao method,  
Pure sincerity moves the Great Darkness,  
True power descends, demons scatter,  
All monsters vanish in form.  

The seven ancestors ferry the Southern Palace,  
The aspirant’s body ascends Supreme Clarity,  
Blessings everywhere,  
The method of offering food to all beings.
