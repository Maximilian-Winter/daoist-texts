### Chapter One: Scripture on the Method of the Bright Mirror

The method to see one’s form in the mirror: one must slightly open the door, sit in darkness facing brightness, close the eyes briefly, and in thought behold one’s face and form. At first, the vision is vague, nothing clearly seen. After midnight, gradually it becomes clear and distant; one sees one’s face, headcloth, and the eyes in the heart open bright. At dawn and at sunset, this is best. If the sun is at its height, one should slightly close the door and peer into the mirror amid dazzling light—then nothing will be seen.

When gazing into the mirror by firelight, keep the fire at a distance; do not approach it too near. To open the eyes and look, see one’s form in the blazing brightness without discomfort. If one wishes to close the eyes and think to see the face, sit in darkness facing brightness, then one sees the ears.

The great essentials of mirror gazing: lie down calmly, think with pure sincerity. Before lying down, the body is straight and supple; in a brief moment, one will see red and yellow light issuing from the forehead, illuminating the entire chamber. Then, as if in a trance, between waking and sleeping, one sees one’s face in the light, mutually gazing for a moment, then it vanishes. After waking from sleep, one again gazes into the mirror; when ready to sleep, do so, thinking as before. Each evening one sees oneself. Sometimes, two faces appear facing each other; sometimes one sees two of oneself sitting side by side; sometimes, between sleep and waking, one sees beautiful divine youths and jade maidens, aged fifteen or sixteen, finely dressed, their foreheads clearly visible, who repeatedly bow. Sometimes voices are heard by the ears, foretelling all auspicious and inauspicious events of the world. Sometimes one sees the east wall on the west, or dreams of mirror gazing at dusk, or looks inward at the five viscera within the light. Mirror gazing begins with the Jia (甲) day.

The method of setting the rules: use a bright mirror nine inches in diameter, without blemish or flaw on its surface, perfectly clear; place one mirror on each side, one foot five inches from the person, level with the eyes. Wash with zinc and well water, and apply underneath. At night, use hemp oil lamps. Seeing one’s form clearly in the mirror, then bow deeply twice to the ground, saying: “I and you share one body; may you multiply into myriad forms; I beg you always to accompany me, body and form never fading, for ten thousand years to follow.” When receiving the bright mirror, first see one’s form and all things, hear human speech.

In practicing the bright mirror, three boys and nine girls attend. The three boys are six feet tall; the nine girls are five feet tall. The blue-waisted wear blue clothes; the central wears purple; the inner wears black; the plain maiden wears white; the imperial maiden wears yellow; the one above the canopy wears pale yellow; the Dao maiden wears yellow; the infant girl wears red; the elder girl wears crimson.

The bright mirror lord commands a retinue of one hundred and twenty, governing the Palace of Open Yang. The masters are two boy attendants of the eyes, whose pure light mutually gazes and perceives omens, knowing auspiciousness and calamity.

### Chapter Two: Scripture of the True Man Daoist Polishing the Mirror

Once there was a Daoist who polished mirrors, wandering among the people, hired by common folk to polish mirrors, regardless of size, charging six or seven coins. He did not polish with other things, only applying medicine to the face and wiping it, yet the mirror’s brightness was unstable. A well-meaning man named Yuan Zhongyang, knowing he had the Dao, requested him to stay overnight. As a favor, the host bowed and inquired. The Daoist told Zhongyang: “The way of the bright mirror can divide forms and transform them, turning one into ten thousand; it can also sharpen one’s wisdom, foreknow coming events, and enable one to see the gods and immortals of Heaven. If one practices the Dao properly, all the gods and immortals of Heaven will come. The Daoist who sees his own body becomes long-lived and ageless, returning to youth. The Daoist enters the mountains to meditate; mountain spirits and ancient demons often come to test him, sometimes taking human form. Therefore, the Daoist always hangs a nine-inch bright mirror behind him in the stone chamber to ward off evil. Though hundreds of ghosts and old monsters can change shape, they cannot alter their reflection in the mirror. When their forms appear in the mirror, they vanish and flee, daring not to harm. Thus the Daoist has a medicine for polishing mirrors, a formula from Master Baizi Gao.”

The formula uses four taels of tin, heated fiercely in a cauldron until the cauldron glows red, the same color as the fire, then tin is added inside. Three taels of white lead powder are mixed in. A piece of raw white poplar wood is carved into a human figure one foot long, two inches wide, one inch thick; its handle length corresponds to the ear. This is stirred by hand without rest, until the figure is reduced to seven inches. Then four taels of real cinnabar and one tael of white lead powder are mixed and stirred until the figure is two inches. Four taels of polishing tin are added and stirred until well combined. When using, take a piece the size of a broad bean, mix with saliva until it becomes a kind of grease, which is best. Also, take a grain-sized piece, blow on the front teeth, then smear with saliva to polish oneself until bright as sun and moon. Before making the medicine, fast and purify for seven days. Prepare in a clean, secret place, not to be seen by others. The fire must be fierce. Keep secret, do not spread to unworthy persons.

The Jiazi ten-day period faces Mao; the Jiaxu ten-day period faces Chou; the Jiashen ten-day period faces Hai; the Jiawu ten-day period faces You; the Jiachen ten-day period faces Wei; the Jiayin ten-day period faces Si.

Those who wish to summon the Six Dings and Jade Maidens must always face the direction of the ten-day period and urinate accordingly, repeating the cycle; the divine maidens will then arrive, and all harm will be removed.

### Chapter Three: Laozi’s Hundred-Flower Powder to Ward Off Armies and Save the World

This formula can repel three armies, drive away many evils, resolve calamities and difficulties, prolong life and fate; those who obtain it live long.

Ingredients: realgar, cinnabar, coltsfoot flower, distant resolve (Polygala).

Each of the four items two fen, treated differently, combined with one sheng of July’s hundred grass flowers, ground into powder two sheng, mixed well. In years of disaster and epidemic, take half a qian spoon. Take first, abstain from smoked vegetables and meat of the six domestic animals. If officials urgently summon, or soldiers and bandits surround, or on a boat encountering wind, mix one dou of water with one liang of medicine to wash face and bathe body. One sheng suffices for three people; also prepare a small amount for emergencies. If bathing is impossible, take two pills the size of small beans; calamities will be resolved. If disciples or others have ill fate, giving them the medicine will save them. Keep secret in the Golden Cabinet; do not spread to unworthy persons.

### Chapter Four: Immortal Divine Wine Formula

Half a sheng each of Sichuan pepper, cassia bark, licorice; five pieces of aconite; half a sheng each of fine malt, dried ginger, and sophora root; half a sheng of fine jujubes.

Combine these eight ingredients, sift finely, soak in one hu of fine wine, sun-dry, then soak again, repeating until the wine is fully infused. Store in an oilskin bag, tightly tied to prevent leakage. When wishing to make wine, take one dou of water, add a small spoon of the formula, stir, and the wine is made. It can also be formed into honey pills. In winter, soak in warm water. Immortals travel ten thousand li without lacking wine, precisely because of this.

### Chapter Five: Divine Immortal Pillow Medicine to Cure All Diseases

An old man beneath Mount Tai, unnamed, was seen by Emperor Wu during his eastern tour, hoeing by the roadside. A white light rose several feet high. The emperor, surprised, asked: “What is your method?” The old man replied: “When I was eighty-five, old and near death, with white hair and lost teeth, a Daoist taught me to eat jujubes, drink no water or grains, and make a divine pillow containing thirty-two substances. These thirty-two correspond to the twenty-four qi and the eight poisons correspond to the eight winds. Practicing this, my black hair regrew, lost teeth returned, and I walked three hundred li daily. Now at one hundred eighty, I cannot abandon the world to enter the mountains, still attached to my grandchildren, and have eaten grains for over twenty years, yet still retain the pillow’s power, staying youthful. Emperor Wu saw the old man’s face looked about fifty; neighbors confirmed this. The emperor accepted the formula and made the pillow but could not follow the fasting.”

The formula uses the fifth day of the fifth month or the seventh day of the seventh month. Take wooden boards from the mountains and forests, one foot two inches long, four inches high, hollowed to hold one dou two sheng, with a red heart cover four fen thick, well sealed but able to open and close. Drill three rows of forty holes each, one hundred twenty holes total, each hole the size of a millet grain. The medicine uses:

Chuanxiong, angelica, white angelica, magnolia flower, duhuang, white atractylodes, dried root, magnolia bark, Sichuan pepper, cassia, dried ginger, fangfeng, ginseng, platycodon, feikang, [illegible], white hesperis, qinjiao, jingshi, one text says strong jingshi, cistanche, coix seed, coltsfoot flower, lianwu. Twenty-four substances correspond to the twenty-four qi. Added poisons: aconite, prepared aconite, euphorbia, soap pod, mangcao, alum, pinellia, asarum. Thirty-two substances total, one tael each.

All crushed finely, poisons placed on top, packed into a cloth bag, aged one hundred days. The face gains radiance. Within a year, all internal illnesses and wind diseases are cured, and the body is fragrant. After four years, white hair turns black, lost teeth regrow, ears and eyes sharpen. The formula is divine and secret, not to be passed to unworthy.

Hao ben is the old chuanxiong mother.

Emperor Wu asked, Dongfang Shuo answered: “In olden times, Lady Lian passed this formula to Yu Qing, who passed it to Guangchengzi, who passed it to the Yellow Emperor. Recently, the Daoist Chunyu Gong of Gucheng used this pillow medicine, living over one hundred years with black hair. All diseases come from the yang pulse of humans; now with this pillow, wind evils cannot invade. Even though wrapped in cloth, it should be further wrapped in leather; only remove before lying down.”

The emperor offered bolts of silk to the old man, who refused, saying: “My relation to the sovereign is like a son to his father. The son knowing the Dao does not accept gifts from the father. I do not sell the Dao; I offer this because Your Majesty loves goodness and believes in the Dao.” The emperor stopped and gave him more medicines.

### Chapter Six: Laozi’s Pillow Talismans and Medicine Formula

Those living in unrest, weakened and ill, if the head of the household wears this, the entire family will be safe and happy. If someone dies suddenly and the body is not cold, swallowing two pills the size of large beans of this medicine will revive them. If someone is too weak to swallow, open their mouth with a stick and give the medicine; they will live. In years of epidemic and pestilence, or when traveling far to foreign lands with unfamiliar water and soil, take one pill the size of a large bean on the first morning of the month, and wear it as prescribed. When mixing and wearing the medicine, first bathe and fast. Wearing it wards off myriad diseases, dispels hundreds of ghosts, eliminates five armies, is suitable for officials, protects descendants, avoids calamity, and brings all good fortune. After wearing, old clothes worn on the body must not be lent to others. This medicine and talisman are very secret, not to be passed to unworthy.

Ingredients:

Walnut, heavenly male (?), peach resin, realgar, croton seed, Sichuan pepper, real pearl, dog gall, tiger palm, tiger tooth, female green, white quartz, yinchenhao.

These thirteen substances, one tael and a half each, combined with the talisman make fourteen items. Pound finely, sift, add two jin of finely cut fresh ginger, squeeze juice, mix with the medicine, then pound six hundred times with pestle. If ginger juice is insufficient, add white honey. Then make three sparrow-egg-sized pills, wrap in a three-inch crimson silk pouch lined with white silk. First write the primary talisman in cinnabar on the silk, then tie the crimson pouch. Men wear on the left, women on the right. When pounding the medicine, face northwest and recite the yin incantation:

“Five Phases push one another, Heaven and Earth unfold rightly, feet tread Wen Chang, heart entrusts Great Clarity, yin and yang harmonize qi, merge with me, Kui, Lou, Wei, Mao, facing northwest, Southern Dipper governs life, body wears sun and moon, going to the Heavenly Court, everywhere hearing faults, urgent as the Dao’s command.”

If troubled by evil dreams or waking visions, place three pills under the pillow.

### Chapter Seven: Laozi’s Scripture of Planting Ganoderma in the Jade Box — Secrets of the Immortals

Inside the stone chamber:

Laozi said: “O you myriad beings, all know that life is joy and death is grief, yet none know how to sustain life. Thousands of arts and myriad medicines enter the body, rightly to gain old age and longevity; a thousand years or more, yet still cannot make one fly and ascend to immortality, to attend the Heavenly Sovereign. The best wood medicine is pine resin. This tree grows Poria with rich resin. Its leaves and fruit are all edible. The best herbs are gloriosa, polygonatum, asparagus, and mountain thistle. They must be taken long-term without a single day’s lapse to gain five hundred years, but still cannot match Heaven and Earth. Later alchemists added to this teaching, misleading learners; I deeply pity them. The eight-stone pill and cinnabar jade nectar, taken, require abstaining from sexual relations, blood, food, and meat; lying in a famous mountain stone chamber for a year to meet ghosts and spirits, not dying, but still cannot make one fly lightly on clouds. Have you heard that immortals take ganoderma? This is no empty talk. The yin and yang of famous mountains, the essence of spring water, ancient trees below, all produce ganoderma, but their essence is from mountain, water, soil, and wood, not enough to make one immortal, only surpassing common herbs. Ganoderma growing atop cinnabar, gold, verdigris, and realgar are all born of these substances. Without utmost virtue to move the spirits, one meets but does not see it, nor can eat it. Ganoderma that can make one immortal receives the utmost essence of these four substances, contains the harmonious qi of Heaven and Earth yin and yang, steamed and infused with their fluids to generate life; its taste is divine beyond the essence of these four substances. Now, merely taking these four substances, grinding and taking them is beneficial; if combined with spiritual response and gathered in furnace and cauldron, its essence flies upward; inhaling and taking it is a hundred times more potent than herbs alone. Must obtain the pure qi of Heaven and Earth, connect with the essence fluids of these four substances, and let them generate new life above, surely a hundredfold increase over placing them in an earthen cauldron. I am about to depart, but I consider the myriad beings who will become dust and ashes—alas! Now I compose this celestial ganoderma text; those with destined bones shall obtain my writing. Those whose ancestors have sins and bodies are not destined for longevity shall not have my book. Hide it in famous mountain stone boxes beneath ninefold layers; do not spread recklessly. Be cautious, be cautious.”

On the day of the Beginning of Spring, dig a pit on the eastern Tiger ground of the household, inside and outside the dwelling none present. Must find good soil, not ash earth. Dig a pit three feet deep, three feet square. Take one jin of verdigris, grind to powder, wrap in goat skin, soak with one sheng of green madder, cover with soil, build a mound. After seven days, blue clouds should cover it; after seventy days, blue qi arises, connecting to the blue clouds above. After one hundred days, ganoderma grows, shaped as pictured. On the days of Yin and Mao, from sunrise, holding three feet of blue silk and a bone knife, walk the Yu step and carefully harvest it without looking back. Return, dry in shade for one hundred days, grind to powder. Take one knife-shaped piece with well water, three times daily. When finished, the three corpses, nine worms, seven diseases, wild dog lung abscesses, and all ailments transform into turbid blood and discharge from nose and mouth; wash with well water; then one can walk on water, fire does not burn, fasting from grains and water is possible. Those who die must not enter rooms; fasting from blood and food, dragon chariots and myriad immortals come to welcome them. To prevent the common folk, do not plant this ganoderma.

On the day of the Beginning of Summer, dig a pit on the southern mountain’s sunny side, eight feet deep, eight feet square. Bury two jin of cinnabar, ground to powder, wrapped in red realgar, crushed and refined to remove stones, add cinnabar powder inside, soak with two sheng of scrophularia, cover with soil, build mound. After eight days, red clouds cover it; after eighty days, red qi rises like smoke, connecting to red clouds. After one hundred days, red ganoderma grows, shaped as pictured. On the days of Si and Wu, from sunrise, walk the Yu step with eight feet of crimson and scarlet silk, harvest with wooden knife, bow twice and leave without looking back. Dry in shade for one hundred days, take a small spoon daily with well water at dawn when the sun is one zhang high. When finished, the three corpses, nine worms, seven diseases, wild dog lung abscesses, and all ailments transform and discharge; wash with well water; then one can walk on water, fire does not burn, fasting from grains and water is possible. Those who die must not enter rooms; fasting from blood and food, dragon chariots and myriad immortals come to welcome them. To prevent the common folk, do not plant this ganoderma.

On the day of the Beginning of Autumn, dig a pit on the western mountain’s shady side, six feet deep, six feet square. Bury one jin of gold, melted and poured into the pit; pour one sheng of Ling Mountain crane’s knee grass, one hu of clear wine, one hu of duckweed; cover with soil, build mound. After six days, white clouds cover it; after sixty days, yellow qi rises like steam, connecting to white clouds. After one hundred days, yellow ganoderma grows, shaped as pictured. On the days of Shen and You, at Shen and You hours, from sunrise, walk the Yu step with six feet of white silk, harvest with golden knife, bow twice and leave without looking back. Dry in shade for one hundred days, take three fingers’ width daily. When finished, the old become younger, the young bloom with color, white hair turns black, lost teeth regrow.

On the day of the Beginning of Winter, dig a pit on the northern mountain’s shady side, five feet deep, five feet square. Bury three jin of realgar, ground and prepared, placed in a mature copper vessel, pour two sheng of hemp oil, cover with one jin of realgar powder, cover with soil, build mound. After five days, black clouds cover it; after fifty days, purple qi rises, connecting to black clouds. After one hundred days, purple ganoderma grows, shaped as pictured; at night it shines a mile around, on cloudy nights one can see hairs. On Ren and Gui days, from sunrise, walk the Yu step with five feet of black silk, harvest with horn knife, bow and leave without looking back. Dry in shade for one hundred days, take five fen daily, at midnight facing north. When finished, the old transform into children. Women can also take this ganoderma; the Sovereign of Fate Taiyi sends immortal officials to welcome them; their lifespan equals Heaven’s, immune to cuts and stabs, fire and burning, water and wetness; five poisons kept away, evil ghosts avoid them; hunger and thirst unknown.

Taking these four ganodermas grants eternal life without death; wherever one goes, the Heavenly Official’s kitchen is present; one can go without eating; wherever one travels, mountains and marshes provide mounts of dragons and tigers; ghosts and spirits pay homage and receive orders. Keep secret.

The commentators say: “From this we see the numbers of Heaven and Earth yin and yang can transform and generate myriad things; one cannot say they do not exist. Like the fire drill of yang and the water drill of yin, cutting bamboo to make fire—how can this be said not to have response? With a cinnabar cauldron turning into mercury, moved by the sun’s essence, what cannot be transformed? What is transformed and not completed? Using material forms, transforming and generating, hidden in the Golden Cabinet, be careful not to leak. Those with destined bones meet your form; diligently cultivate goodness; the Sovereign of Fate removes their death record; Heaven and Earth together; roaming the Nine Heavens above, traversing the Six Directions below, spirit powers penetrating, enjoying eternity. The blue image is like emerald feathers, unchanged in color for one hundred days.”
