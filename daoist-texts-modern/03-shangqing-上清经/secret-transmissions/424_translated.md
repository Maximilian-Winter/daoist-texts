## The Most High True Scripture of the Bright Mirror

Laozi said:  
Within the golden water lies the inner landscape; from yin arises yang. One who masters this dao can divide the body and scatter the form, transforming the one into myriad. Establishing the six armies, from a thousand billion li afar, breathing in and out, riding clouds and treading water, entering and exiting without gap—Heavenly spirits and earthly deities, evil ghosts and ancient demons, all hidden and concealed kinds, can all be seen.  
Carefully examine the essence and thought; when you see them coming against the current, if you can guard it, you become an immortal king.

Laozi said:  
If you desire to walk the Bright Mirror path, do not enter the homes of the bereaved or places of childbirth and nursing. Wear pure garments scented with incense, bathe in the five fragrances, and drink the nectar of orchid and cinnamon. Do not eat pungent or spicy foods; completely abandon fishy and restless flavors. Avoid proximity to women. In a quiet and serene place, in a secluded chamber, where no sound of carriages or horses, no clang of metal drums, no clamor of birds or beasts is heard, only then can you proceed.  
The greatest taboo of this dao is fright; once startled, there is no return, once broken, no restoration.  
At such a time, the heart must no longer desire to hold anything, the ears no longer wish to hear anything. Fix your mind and steady your gaze, as if in deep contemplation, with utmost refinement and no slackening—only then can success be attained.

Laozi said:  
One must obtain a Bright Mirror nine cun in diameter, without any flaw, damage, or blemish on its surface. Strive for clarity, completeness, and perfect roundness, without losing the human visage—that is best.  
In ancient times, my venerable master used a mirror one chi two cun wide, with one on each front, back, left, and right, called the Four Compasses. Those who walk this dao find it exceedingly difficult to quickly complete or easily obtain. If startled, great calamity ensues—only a few can endure it.  
Wenzi and Haocheng each used a single one chi mirror placed before them, also to see spirits, yet they could not attain longevity.

Laozi said:  
Use one nine-cun mirror on each side, called the Sun and Moon, also to extend life.  
If you wish to divide the body and scatter the form, sitting or standing, ascending the Yellow Court, achieving long life and immortality, commanding a hundred spirits, entering water and fire, entering metal and stone, entering wood and earth, flying and roaming at will, you must use my Four Compasses dao.  
If you only wish to reverse-know fortune and misfortune, the Sun and Moon suffice.

Laozi said:  
The method of setting the compasses is to measure one chi five cun from yourself, aligning with the eyebrows, each suspended with purple-green cords, below which hangs splendid water—make sure it is level.  
Do not close your eyes day or night to gain efficacy.  
If you close your eyes, fear that at the moment you should close them, the numinous spirit suddenly appears but you fail to see it immediately, or you lose the spirit entirely, or suddenly open your eyes and see it, which gradually causes fright and ruin.

Laozi said:  
The dao of the Four Compasses must reveal the honored spirits. Those not of the highest true adept should not be shown this.  
My dao is most secret; the world has no such person, better to see the dao gate.  
Those who wish to practice the Four Compasses must place them one chi five cun from themselves, three chi tall.  
The East Compass reveals two immortals, wearing cinnabar silk crowns, faces narrow and small, ears tall above their heads, bodies covered with black hair—see them without fear.  
The West Compass reveals the Queen Mother of the West, attended by jade maidens.  
The South Compass reveals the Primordial Lord of Central Harmony and Limitlessness, with one body and eleven heads, crowned with the natural crown, wearing red garments.  
The North Compass reveals the Heavenly Sovereign Lord with thirteen heads, crowned and robed as in his time.

Lingyangzi Ming, having obtained this method, said:  
Sometimes one sees two persons in yellow garments and yellow crowns; the white-bearded elder is the Lord of Longevity, the younger is the Lord of Fate.  
Sometimes two persons in red garments and red caps; the younger is the Lord of Mandate, the elder the Lord of Life.  
Sometimes two persons in feathered garments with yellow-black crowns; the Lord of Inspection.  
Sometimes three persons in feathered garments with red and blue crowns; the Lord of Hearing Sounds.  
Sometimes one person with a great crown and vermilion robes, holding a brush and tally; the Lord of Judgment.  
Sometimes one person in yellow robes and crown, covering their face; the Lord of Added Years.  
Sometimes two persons in red skirts; the Lord of Form Viewing.  
Sometimes a jade maiden in blue robes, named Graceful Essence Jade Maiden.  
Sometimes a jade maiden in black robes, named Supreme Mysterious Jade Maiden.  
Sometimes a jade maiden in red robes, named Red Jade Maiden.  
Sometimes a jade maiden in yellow robes, named Ever-Yang Jade Maiden.  
Sometimes three boys in blue robes with purple hems come together; one named Ever-Present, one named Severed Cavern, one named Five Virtues.  
Sometimes nine jade maidens in multicolored garments come together; named Above, Tiger, Support, Spirit Gate, Hole Forest, Feng, Residence, Many, and [missing name].  
Sometimes one person with eyes three cun wide beneath, in yellow robes with blue hems; the Lord of the Same Eye.  
Sometimes a child two or three chi tall, smiling at people; these are the Nine Capital Boys.  
Sometimes a boy five or six chi tall, standing and smiling, with a natural canopy above; the Noon Boy. Without the canopy, the Midnight Boy.  
Sometimes a person with a human head and bird body, five-colored black and yellow; the Supreme Great One, Dao Father.  
Sometimes nine persons, all in blue robes with white hair; the Great Primordial Lord of Limitlessness.  
Sometimes one person six chi five cun tall, crowned with horns, white robes with red collars, sometimes tiger patterns or phoenix designs; surname Li, named Er, styled Boyang; always seen at dawn.  
Sometimes one person six chi seven cun tall, crowned with heavy flowers, white robes with blue patterns; named Li Tan, styled Boyang; always seen at sunrise.  
Sometimes one person six chi nine cun tall, crowned with heavy flowers, five-colored robes; named Li [missing], styled Boyguang; always seen at mealtime.  
Sometimes one person seven chi two cun tall, crowned with a Pi Xie, robed in silk, shaped like dragon and snake; named Li Shi, styled Menggong; always seen in the center of the wilderness.  
Sometimes one person seven chi three cun tall, crowned with a flying dragon, robed in vermilion; named Li Chongquan, styled Ziwen; always seen at noon.  
Sometimes one person seven chi five cun tall, crowned with Three Heroes, robed in vermilion and jade; named Li Ding, styled Wuyang; always seen at sunset.  
Sometimes one person eight chi tall, crowned with fur, robed in black; named Li Yuan, styled Boshi; always seen at dusk.  
Sometimes one person eight chi five cun tall, crowned naturally, robed in dragon and snake; named Li Yuan, styled Yuansheng; always seen at sunset.  
Sometimes one person nine chi five cun tall, crowned naturally, robed in blue-purple; named Li Yuan, styled Bowen; always seen at twilight.

Laozi said:  
The superior adept completes it in seven days, the middle adept in ten days, the inferior adept in one month.

Laozi said:  
Purple and green form the interior, combined to nine cun; the compass measures one chi two cun.

Laozi said:  
The superior adept first sees their own form, next the ghosts and spirits in their dwelling, then the heavenly spirits.  
Ghosts and spirits may appear in one body or not all at once, usually no more than six or seven spirits come.  
But carefully gaze within the compass, not at the spirits seen. Speak not, bow not; quickly compose yourself without fear.

Laozi said:  
Those who practice this dao do not fell trees in spring, do not extinguish fire with water in summer, do not dig earth in any month of the four seasons, do not melt metal in autumn, do not dam water or bore wells in winter.

Laozi said:  
Those who practice this dao do not eat liver in spring, heart in summer, spleen in any month of the four seasons, lung in autumn, or kidney in winter.  
The spirits of the five viscera when angered cause one to lose clarity and lifespan.

Laozi said:  
Those who practice this dao must not slacken for seven days; those who attain it should apply it every seventy days as on the first day.  
This dao can reverse years and turn back old age.  
Lingyangzi Ming said: Calm and even, already at peace.

Laozi said:  
After seeing the spirits, apply it again; if you ask the essentials of long life, all will be fully revealed.

Laozi said:  
Once the dao of the Four Compasses is complete, one may grasp the dao of a single compass and use it, no longer needing all four.  
Perform the double fasting of the Hidden Gate, wear a green cap, ascend to the North Pole, descend into the Mysterious Traces, and mirror the matter.  
For this dao, always place a vermilion bird three chi tall above, a black tortoise five chi tall below, a blue dragon nine chi tall on the left, and a white tiger seven chi tall on the right, also treading the Sun and Moon.

Laozi said:  
Not only oneself, but also command the vermilion crow to hold a nine-cun mirror, the black tortoise to bear a one chi two cun mirror, the blue dragon to hold the sun, the white tiger to hold the moon, and one’s own form to resemble dragon and snake.  
One must be able to divide the form, sitting and seeing beyond the four seas, then stop.  
Stopping means the true being arrives.  
At night, use lamps, candles, or hemp oil as fire—very good.  
To treat the sick or enter great mountains fearing mountain spirits and a hundred ghosts testing one, place one compass above the door, one vessel of splendid water below, draw a sword across the water with the blade facing outward—hundred ghosts will not advance.  
If an old demon enters the door, it cannot cross the water and dies, its blood in the water.  
Keep this secret; do not show common folk.

Laozi said:  
To repel five weapons and a hundred evils, use a three-cun compass, cast with the Round Heaven Talisman, worn on the chest.  
On yin days on the right, on yang days on the left, entering the masses, it prevails; all fear it.  
My dao is secret indeed.

On a certain year, month, day, a certain state, commandery, county, village, Daoist named so-and-so taught the essential Bright Mirror Four Compasses technique of Laozi to a student from a certain state, commandery, county, village, with an oath of forty feet of white silk, one dou of rice, one bundle of firewood, and five sheng of salt.  
Neither party dared conceal the essentials; the student vowed not to enter the Yellow Springs (death).  
Together with the venerable master, the mysterious lord Zhang Baiyu, and the golden master so-and-so, they drew one as a token of trust, valid for three years.  
Transmission is forbidden to unworthy persons; one must thank Heaven, Earth, Water, and the Three Officials, obtain immortality, and not betray the original words.

Laozi said:  
The Return Heaven Talisman, also called the Round Heaven Talisman or Cover Heaven Talisman, is secretly kept by the Left Origin. Written in vermilion.

*(Original talisman missing)*

Laozi said:  
The Round Heaven Talisman wards off calamities and disasters, granting long life and enduring vision, preserving in accord with Heaven.  
Tigers and wolves break their teeth and shatter their jaws; a hundred weapons dare not approach.  
Upon seeing it, they prostrate and dare not rise.  
One wearing this talisman, who can know?  
Left She and Right Ji, one shall receive Heaven’s blessing, a thousand autumns and ten thousand years, endless longevity.  
Urgent, urgent, as the law commands.

In former times, the Yellow Court Perfected One Daoist respectfully asked:  
“The qi of Heaven, Earth, and the Five Phases is precious to humans, yet some live long and some do not—why is this so?”

Laozi said:  
Humans receive the qi of Heaven and Earth, all living to one hundred and twenty years, but joy, anger, greed, lust, craving for delicacies, sweet and rich flavors, inability to restrain eating, discomfort in emptiness, dwelling daily among the mundane, unable to contemplate the dao—all these are accompanied by evil ghosts, causing short life.

Daoist said:  
“If one can restrain eating, not delight in sweet, rich flavors or lust, can one then self-measure and not age?”

Laozi said:  
If you love the dao, carefully guard body and mind, and faithfully preserve the one body, you can attain agelessness.  
The human head models Heaven, the feet model Earth, the five viscera model the Five Phases, the four limbs model the four seasons, the nine palaces model the nine provinces, the eyes model the Sun and Moon, the hair models the stars—thus you should follow the heavenly foundation.  
Among all things, humans are most precious.

Heaven has a divine herb called “Approaching the Balance,” spread throughout the world, growing in damp and moist places.  
Its leaves shine like long roosters, growing robustly along the dao.  
In autumn, the eighth month, male and female roots unite and form knots, branches and leaves intertwine; dragons and snakes obtain it, carrying and hiding it.  
In the third month of spring, when thunder roars, it emerges.  
Those who eat it and hide it in stone chambers treasure it.  
When Yao faced the great flood and people hungered and thirsted, he ordered the people to gather it, all revived and lived.  
Carefully ingesting it grants immortality; sages who take it close their mouths and speak no more.  
Now I tell you, you may save your body.  
Wait for the mist to gather and gather it at the time when male and female unite in late autumn—it is very good.  
Hang it in the north of the dwelling to dry in shade, pound it a thousand times, place it in a large dish, mix with honey and form pills the size of parasol tree seeds, taking three pills daily.  
The days number three sevens, twenty-one days, and the dao is complete.  
Taking one pill, one ascends to the Mud Pillar, descending to Kunlun.  
Taking two pills, one roams and rests in the Jade Hall.  
Taking three pills, one passes through the Jade Gate.  
Taking four pills, one parts the Flowery Canopy, resting in the Scarlet Palace.  
Taking five pills, one skirts Flowery Mountain—excellent—various spirits accompany to ascend Jade Heaven and the Jade Hall.  
After twenty-one days, men, women, young and old each attain their place.  
Can one not strive?  
Transmit this to the worthy.

The Grass-Carrying Diagram says:  
Born in the second month by the roadside, its color is blue, with nine nodes.  
The third node below has twelve leaves, the fourth node twelve leaves, the sixth node again twelve leaves—thirty-six leaves in all.  
The lower root resembles a seated person, about three cun long, centrally white, bark yellow.  
Its taste is sweet and pungent.

The Scripture of the Seventy-Six Spirit Elixir combines medicine and talisman, with four separate talismans for the four directions, the combined medicine is numinous.

North: Heaven Harmony Talisman  
West: Great General Talisman  
South: Red Hook Princess Talisman  
East: Blue Tooth Youth Talisman

Written in black placed in the north: Collecting Day Talisman  
Written in white placed in the west: Establishing Day Talisman  
Written in vermilion placed in the south: Full Day Talisman  
Written in blue placed in the east: Completion Day Talisman

Yellow Boy and Jade Maiden govern the essence of medicine, able to combine medicine and daily talismans of the four directions, fearless of all losses.

Laozi said:  
When the form descends, corpses resemble worms; Daoists who take it, when the worm descends, their eyes brighten instantly.  
When this evil corpse descends, just look for the bright breaking day, to sweep away the form and body, then drink pure clear water.  
All who do not retain it for seven breaks, the subdued corpse worm descends no more than seven breaks; the seven breaks for the old are even fewer—then one must quietly withdraw.  
Also two talismans come from Laozi’s Thirty-Nine True Talismans, the eighth talisman, originally two scrolls; the talismans differ, so repeated here.  
Breaking and subduing corpses also has two talismans.  
When descending corpses, do not pre-warn others; though the Three Corpses have no ears or eyes, they secretly know when people know.  
Combine medicine in quiet places, entering mountains at proper seasons:  
First month, first day; second month, twenty-fifth day; third month, twenty-fourth day; fourth month, sixteenth day; fifth month, eleventh day; sixth month, sixth day; seventh month, second day; eighth month, twenty-fifth day; ninth month, twenty-first day; tenth month, sixteenth day.  
These are the days the Heavenly Granary opens, auspicious for traveling to famous mountains.  
The twelve earthly branches: first month Rat, second month Ox, third month Tiger, fourth month Rabbit, fifth month Dragon, sixth month Snake, seventh month Horse, eighth month Goat, ninth month Monkey, tenth month Rooster, eleventh month Dog, twelfth month Pig—these days are Heaven and Earth’s opening days, best for entering mountains, allowing long residence, bringing peace and no harm.

Laozi said:  
The mountain-entry talisman is written in cinnabar on white silk strips, traveling horizontally across the world.

Laozi said:  
The nameless name is the dwelling of my being; the named name loses my pouch.  
The unpossessed possession completes my virtue; the possessed possession loses my thief.  
No sin is greater than lust, no calamity greater than greed, no fault greater than desire.  
With these three calamities, called the chariot of disaster, small ones endanger the body, great ones ruin the family.  
Yet in fasting the heart, think of three spirits:  
One named Spirit Vermilion Lord, two named Spirit Bright Lord, three named Spirit Yellow Lord.  
Constantly think of them, in walking, standing, sitting, lying, call their names thrice daily, and you may survive the year of calamity.  
Keep this secret; do not transmit.

The first spirit wears scarlet robes and yellow skirts,  
The second spirit wears yellow robes and yellow skirts,  
The third spirit wears scarlet robes and yellow skirts.
