## The Supreme Clarity Treasure Mirror of Longevity

**Inscription on the Mirror says:**

“Forged from a hundredfold refined divine gold, nine inches in perfect roundness,  
Guarded by winged beasts and birds,  
Animated by the seven luminaries’ numinous power,  
This mirror enfolds Heaven and Earth,  
Its awe subdues demons and spirits,  
An immortal pendant from sacred mountains,  
Spinning upon the wheel of Supreme Clarity.”
