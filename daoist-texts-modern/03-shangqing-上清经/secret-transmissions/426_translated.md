## The Supreme Clarity Mirror of Contained Images and Sword Diagram

*Recorded by Sima Chengzhen of the White Clouds on Mount Tiantai*

The method of the Four Regulations rests solely upon divine arts; marvels of a thousand years seek only the shadow of the crow. Containing light and capturing form, though one may behold its appearance, the image yet communicates with spirit—rarely does its pattern endure. The wonder lies in the mirror: its pure essence condenses within, serene and silent; its clear radiance shines without, translucent and bright. Gazing upon it, one thus attains understanding. It responds without concealment; the heart of the perfected person shines ever more clearly. Illuminating and tracing shadows, the shape of subtle transformations reappears. This is the so-called Way of steadfast clarity, the true power of numinous spirit.

This treasured plaything—none surpass this vessel. It can reveal oneself, and also reflect things beyond. This mirror is round outside and square within, taking its image from Heaven and Earth. At its center lie the trigrams and hexagrams, fully displaying yin and yang. The essence of the sun, Li, represents the sun itself; the essence of the moon, Kan, represents the moon. The stars align with the Five Phases and connect with the Seven Luminaries. Thunder and lightning rest at Mao; Zhen is thunder. The celestial abyss lies at You; Dui is marsh. Clouds divide the eight trigrams, marking the cycles of the four seasons—this expresses the patterns of Heaven.

Its square and round flow like water, pouring through the four dark quarters. Within is placed the Continuous Mountains, signaling the Five Sacred Peaks. Mountains and marshes share their vital breath; myriad beings abide within. This is the pattern of Earth established. The inscription’s four lines correspond to the Three Powers; by analogy and extension, one may grasp their meaning. These words convey the writings of sages. Hence it is called the Mirror of Contained Images, summing its meaning. Carved and inscribed upon its case, one may carefully observe the mirror’s symbolic form.

### Golden Tortoise on Green Earth

**Preface to the Jingzhen Sword**

The essence of yang manifests in Jing; the qi of yin unfolds in Zhen. Thus it is named Jingzhen, fully embodying the meaning of essence and qi. Know then that pure essence and qi correspond; the phenomena communicate. The mechanism of operation responds with awe-inspiring potency. The meaning of spirit replacing form is already seen in the true regulations; the principle of gathering ghosts and crushing demons is unheard of in strange methods. This is why the sword’s surface unites yin and yang, carving images in accord with Heaven and Earth. Qian uses the chief stars of Kui and Gang as its tip; Kun places thunder and lightning at its edge. Whatever the heavenly stars add, nothing resists; whatever the thunder and lightning rage, nothing withstands. Wearing it upon the body grants protection inside and out; applying it to things follows the use of spirits and ghosts by humans.

### Imperial Edict and Poem by Emperor Ming of Tang

Having received the bright and illuminating treasure sword submitted, containing the radiance of the two luminaries and bearing the images of the eight trigrams, it suffices to extend light to benevolence and longevity, to erase shadows of abundant cities. Wearing and revering it stirs many feelings, humbling this humble one’s four rhymes.

The treasure’s radiance contains Heaven and Earth; the divine sword unites yin and yang. Sun and moon shine with splendid light; stars and constellations carve their writings. Depicting mirror and form, wearing it guards the body. From now on, one may admire and cherish it; eternal virtue preserves long life.

### Memorial Presenting the Supreme Clarity Mirror of Contained Images by Minister Sima, Heavenly Master

I have heard that when rivers and mountains meet their time, auspicious signs may still appear; when grass and trees respond to their season, they sometimes present omens. How much more so that I, born in a flourishing dynasty and dwelling among the common folk, if possessing a wondrous object, should present it before the imperial court.

I first received the Supreme Clarity Mirror of Contained Images forged by Tang’s Heavenly Master Sima for the august emperor. It has been handed down through generations, kept secret for many years. This mirror is round outside, symbolizing Heaven; square inside, symbolizing Earth. It pairs Kan and Li with the sun and moon, spreads cloud qi over mountains and rivers. On the right it fixes position at the celestial abyss; on the left it expresses power in thunder and lightning. The eight trigrams are all arrayed; the four dark quarters complete the cycle. It enfolds the Way within Qian and Kun; it shakes its efficacy against evil spirits. Hence it is named Contained Images, responding to the Most High. Its diagram is secret in the profound arts; its matters clearly preserved in the Daoist Canon.

I humbly reflect that I am but a lowly woodsman and fisherman, a dull block and rough timber, unworthy of the refined ways of the learned. Yet by chance I have encountered the transformation of the Tao of Yao and Tang. Thus the mirror is difficult to conceal or hide; it must be presented clearly and openly. I respectfully follow the circumstances to submit this memorial, late and clumsy though it be, relying on Heaven’s wisdom. I await imperial command.

Presented on a day in the tenth month of the second year of Jingde by your servant Wu Ji.

### Methods of Forging Sword Mirrors and Alchemical Preparations

In all sword and mirror forging, one must obtain true iron refined through one hundred cycles of tempering. When iron is refined to perfection, without cinnabar or silver additions, it is not called a true sword. Therefore, the ancient sword gods and mirrors, from Emperor Xuanyuan Huangdi receiving the divine Xu Gong method, later passed down to Zuo Qiuzi, the swordsmith Gan Jiang, and the extraordinary master of Wu and Yue, all mastered the divine mirror and numinous sword method. Later generations, unable to add cinnabar or silver to refine iron, found it difficult to forge true swords.

Now first cinnabar is fire-refined into silver; next iron is forged and mixed with additions. Taking the year, month, day, and hour, the sword mirror is made following the earlier diagram, with separate dimensional patterns, each size having its own rule.

### Method to Refine Cinnabar into Silver

Half a catty each of colored mountain marsh silver, cinnabar, lead powder, and mercury.

These items are pounded evenly and placed in a porcelain container, wrapped with a layer three fingers thick. The container is set in a sand steamer and steamed for seven days. After cooling, the refined silver is taken out. It is then combined with clay to form a solid mass, placed into an ash pit, and nurtured by fire for fourteen days. Each day the fire is maintained at five catties of strength, then removed and covered with salt, bellows applied, and thus the supreme treasure is formed.
