## Supreme Clarity’s Talismanic Script Qingjuan Technique

**Record of the Primordial Inspection of Earth, the True Scripture of the Nine Heavens**

The Three Primes’ Mysterious Platform Jade Inspection Purple Script, also called the Record of the Primordial Inspection of Earth of the Nine Heavens, also known as the Three Primes Tiger Script, also the Flying Heaven Supreme Truth to Inform the Spirits of the Six Heavens—this script governs mountains and rivers, inspects the spirits of the nine earths, and commands talismanic texts to marshal ninety Jade Maidens. In peaceful times, it welcomes the Holy Sovereign at the Supreme Clarity Palace.  
The recipient must inscribe it with yellow ink upon blue silk, offer it in sacrifice to their natal mountain, then wear it for nine years. If one has not ascended to Heaven, one must write another copy, burn it, scatter the ashes into the azure smoke of the skies; write yet another copy and bury it deep in the natal mountain, tread the river’s source, command the earth spirits, so that myriad gods, after nine years, will grant passage on the sedan chair of the Three Primes, ascending to the palace of the Three Primes. One must not enter defilement or death; one must touch the innate Heaven-truth, lightly report and declare; the Seven Ancestors will hold one accountable; death means loss of immortality.
