## The Seven Primordial Talismans of Supreme Clarity’s Radiant Manifestation

Herein lies a single line, inscribed in seal script for personal wearing. Originally, the seven primordial forces were represented by the sun, moon, and the five planets; beyond these, there are six additional talismans, likely those found in the *Scripture of Dispelling Demons*. Yet, the *Scripture of Dispelling Demons* contains a total of forty-nine talismans, many of which are left blank or incomplete in the text, varying widely in size and scope. Presently, only a few of these are shown here; the rest have been lost to time. There is also one yellow talisman, traditionally said to originate from the *True Decree*.

The talisman of the Supreme Ultimate Perfected One commanding the Northern Emperor of Fengdu appears in the *Jade Horse Scripture* above, though whether this is the same remains uncertain.

The Seven Primordial Talismans, according to the worldly scriptures, have rough methods of application. Now, as these are for wearing, no further explanation is given. It is said that one should follow the *True Decree*, inscribing them in variegated inks upon multicolored silk, then receive and wear them. The talisman commanding Fengdu, the *True Decree* instructs, should be placed in a pouch of deep purple and worn upon the head.
