The Supreme Clarity Eight Scenes Jade Register Morning Chart Hidden Talismans, received by the Most High Dao Sovereign, treasured by the Jade Clarity Most High Sovereign as a secret. These are golden slips and jade inscriptions, named the Imperial Register. Only those who have heard and seen it, and who recite the Great Cavern of Truth Scripture’s thirty-nine chapters, the Three Treasures Divine Truths, the Female One Eight Intervals Twelve Supreme Vows, and who summon the rosy clouds, wear the refined crimson radiance, speed the moon, and bind the exquisite path of the lapis lazuli, may be adorned with the Eight Scenes Morning Chart Profound Hidden Talismans. Those who possess the talisman’s seed shall, in eight years, be able to ride the chariot of the Eight Scenes.

This text is secret and unheard of in the world. The Jade Clarity Most High often keeps it in the Golden Orchid Jade Chest of Seven Reflections, sealed with a cinnabar bud box, entrusted to the Left Duke of the Immortal Capital, commanding twenty-four Jade Morning Jade Youths and thirty-six Jade Blossoms and Jade Maidens to guard the hidden talismans. The record of merits and virtues is clear; the Profound Truth descends to teach. For seven thousand years, the three transmissions have been heard, yet no one has possessed it. It is sealed on sacred mountains and must not be lightly revealed or treasures leaked. If master or disciple errs, the Seventh Patriarch uses the Mountain of Fate’s stone to fill the Night River, and the body and former masters alike become servants of the underworld, enduring ten sufferings and eight hardships in endless toil.

Now, this compilation gathers its text, clarifying the purpose of caution. Those who receive the talisman from the Most High Dao Sovereign must burn incense in a separate chamber, bowing morning and evening, never mixing shoes or filth, lest they offend the true breath. The Jade Youths and Jade Maidens report offenses to the Most High, who punishes with trials of water and fire. The Heavenly Truth is secret and weighty—how could one not be cautious?

Those who receive the talisman, on each of the eight seasonal festivals and on their natal day, shall bathe and enter the chamber at midnight, facing due north, with a bowed heart and closed eyes. They shall hold the three plain breaths, imagining clouds descending from the northwest of Heaven, filling the chamber, sealing it inside and out. After a long while, they cover ears and mouth with both hands, drawing in the cloud breath thirty times, swallowing each breath. Upon completion, the cloud breath clears away, and two small children appear, like infants, each holding a brocade pouch—one pouch requests the Eight Scenes Jade Register Hidden Text, the other requests the Three Treasures Divine Scripture. These are granted to the destined body. The two children then transform into two august emperors and enter the destined body.

Then the incantation is spoken:

> Entering the Profound, passing into Clarity,  
> Returning to the Morning Splendor Chamber,  
> Teach me, grant me,  
> Without hero or white origin,  
> Female One nourishes,  
> Five Registers of the Cavern Profound,  
> Thirty-nine chapters,  
> Ten thousand recitations of fetal birth,  
> Protect the soul, summon the spirit,  
> Reveal the Cavern Gate,  
> The jade talisman complete,  
> The body rides the purple clouds,  
> Ascends to pay homage to the Northern Emperor,  
> Bowing before Jade Clarity.

Upon completion, the teeth are knocked nine times, and saliva swallowed thirty times. Thus, after eight years, one may have the Eight Heavens Jade Radiance Profound Clouds Green Chariot come to summon the destined body, ascending to the Jade Clarity Palace. Cultivation must not slacken; diligently focus on the Profound. This is the treasure of the Most High, the revered of the Most High Dao Sovereign, reliant solely on sincerity and reverence.

**The Supreme Clarity Great Limit Most High Dao Sovereign Hidden Talisman:**  
Worn by the Most High Dao Sovereign of the Jade Clarity Upper Heaven, the Jade Clarity Purple Radiance Most High Jade Emperor of the Great Limit. On one’s natal day, it is worn in vermilion on blue paper, bound with female yellow on plain silk. This talisman commands and subdues all spirits and great hidden demons of the world, harmonizing the numinous and true. Reciting it without discordant sounds, wearing the talisman and reciting scripture ten thousand times, one shall surely have the Three Primordials dispatch the Eight Scenes Chariot to welcome the destined body, ascending to the Jade Clarity Palace.

The Morning Chart Hidden Talismans emerge from the Palace of the Eight Primordial Void Births, condensing breath into script. The Jade Clarity Purple Dao Void Sovereign bestowed them upon the Most High Dao Sovereign, who wears the Palace of the Eight Heavens Without Shackles. After accumulating seven thousand kalpas, they were entrusted to the Supreme Minister Lord Qing Tong, to pass to those destined to become immortals in later ages. The world has no other text; without the golden slips and jade register, one may not partake in hearing or seeing it.

This dao is profound and subtle, not writable on plain paper nor speakable by mouth. It tracks the cycle of one hundred and sixty, selecting sages and helpers among the Three Dynasties, to be transmitted to later generations. The method of transmission must follow the Profound Way; within seven thousand years, three transmissions. Those with an immortal bone shall establish an oath, presenting eight taels of purple gold and eighty feet of purple brocade, to receive it. The master’s trust must be applied on the cold and desolate path, caring for the poor and distressed, never for selfish gain. The bright method must not be violated; deeply examine and be cautious. Should one break the oath, one faces the trial of the wind blades, becoming a servant of the underworld in endless toil. Transmit carefully, measure well, and receive with reverence.

In ancient times, during the reign of King You of Zhou, there was a man named Jin Guzi, originally surnamed Wang, styled Xuandu, an ordinary mortal. Once, passing the Northern Peak, he found a jade box. Opening it, he saw the Eight Scenes Hidden Talismans. Xuandu did not understand the writing but sensed it was divine script. Wearing it, yet without cultivation, the three plain clouds constantly covered his body. Thereupon, he called himself Jin Guzi. After eight years, he rode the clouds and ascended. Now he is appointed as the Outer Immortal of the Nine Palaces, sitting without concern for affairs, not entering the Jade Emperor’s court. This is the legacy passed down by that sovereign lord.
