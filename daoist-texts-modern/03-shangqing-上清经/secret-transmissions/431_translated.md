#### The Most High Emperor Lord Golden Tiger Talisman Register

Ranked First in the Jade Clarity Division

In the year of so-and-so, during the month and day of the Tai Sui, at the hour of the Rat, in such and such prefecture, county, township, the male or female named so-and-so, aged so many years, born on such month, day, and hour, now bearing this credential, comes to the Three Caverns master, the venerable so-and-so, to request reception of the *Most High Emperor Lord Golden Tiger Talisman Register*. After receiving and wearing it, one must dutifully cultivate according to the prescribed methods, never lightly revealing or defiling the true script. Should one violate even once, they shall bear the consequences and endless kalpas of unforgiveness. If practiced properly, life and death alike shall be transcended, just as the solemn covenant and laws decree.

The Golden Tiger Jade Essence True Talisman of the Most High Celestial Emperor is the inner sound of the Great Origin Supreme Radiance Natural Golden Seal. It commands the Golden Immortals, seals mountains, summons spirits, shakes the six heavens with awe, decapitates ten thousand demons. The Most High constantly commands four spirits, six armor, and seven hundred thousand men to guard the talisman in the Qiong Palace of Supreme Radiance. Those who wear this talisman wield authority over Heaven and Earth, command the host of spirits, control the scenic dragons, and hold the rank of high immortals. When the jade sound resounds, the jade blossoms attend on either side, golden true guards stand by; a thousand Zoroastrians tremble in fear, ten thousand ghosts vanish, nine demons bow their heads, the six heavens collapse and fall. The Dao’s marvel is utmost truth; the spirit gathers the five numinous; on the left whistles the Mysterious Youth, on the right seizes the Golden Morning. Great indeed is this precious script, the true power of the Most High Emperor! It is not merely to repel poison or banish Zoroastrians, but to seek the wondrous grade of immortality and attain the true title. Twenty-seven jade maidens attend, overseeing those who hold the scripture, serving the talisman and its honored regulations, ascending to the Three Pure Ones’ palace. If one disrespects or passes it to unworthy persons, their body shall enter wind and fire, never to be forgiven through kalpas. The talisman is written in vermilion on white silk, worn on the head. Also, with orpiment and green ribbon, it is tied at the middle of the waist on the right side. All as the Most High covenant and laws decree.

All talismans within the scroll are written in vermilion.

The Great Origin Supreme Radiance Golden Elixir True Talisman, powerful spirit internal blessing, summons divine troops to sever and destroy evil souls. When entering a room, burn incense, tap teeth thirty-six times, sit or lie at ease, then recite the blessing:

“Repel the Dry Poison King, shake the Shiluo banner, the Eight Immortals wield halberds, the Emperor’s five spirits, the Great Mysterious descending radiance, seven mornings guarding the court, the Yellow True Shining Talisman, blazing fire bells cast forth, the divine tiger rouses its might, poison blades disorderly present, purple flourishing ritual, four leaps resound upwards, four heavens shining brightly, able to know ghost names, external traverse of mysterious qi, internal guarding of master troops, left commands, right watches, wind strikes, fire conquers, shout and sever ten thousand Zoroastrians, crush and behead a thousand spirits, golden truth shakes power, nine demons seize form, northern Feng collapses and falls, all destroyed are overturned. I wear this true talisman, commanding ten thousand spirits, the Three Origins report truth, mysterious union with imperial sincerity, the Most High Supreme Emperor, ascending to the Three Pure Ones.”

The Great Origin Supreme Radiance powerful spirit internal blessing method is all from the Supreme Clarity’s forbidden scriptures. The Dry Poison King is the inner name of the six heavens’ great ghosts. The Shiluo banner is the euphemism for the Northern Emperor demon king. The four heavens shining brightly are the soul names of the northern Feng ghosts. Those who know the three ghost names cause a thousand Zoroastrians to flee, ten thousand ghosts to hide forms, nine demons cannot stir to test, a hundred evils cannot harm. Whether dwelling alone in mountains and forests or among ghosts and spirits in temples and mansions, one can act with authority without incense or entering a room. If fasting and entering a room for morning and evening banquets of the Eight Origins, and controlling demons and summoning spirits, then wear and act with the talisman.

#### The Most High Divine Tiger Talisman

The Most High Celestial Emperor commands the Prime Minister Azure Youth Lord and the Western City Queen Mother: “The *Supreme Clarity Wisdom Text for Dispelling Demons True Scripture* is the jade chapter of the Great Ultimate, the highest true secret, the Divine Tiger True Talisman, the precious seal treasured by the Nine Heavens Supreme Truth. Wisdom can chase away filth, dispelling demons can bind evil, the true talisman can control demons and extinguish Zoroastrians. Those who possess the jade slip with purple name, and cultivate the highest methods, shall not be ridden by the host of Zoroastrians nor tested by ten thousand demons. It can be said that ten thousand harms cannot touch them; this is the spirit power of the Divine Tiger, the wondrous use of the true scripture. Now entrusted to you, to pass on to later learners who should become true persons. They must follow the Supreme Truth’s regulations, allowed to transmit thrice within seven hundred years. They must not show unworthy persons or lightly reveal the true script, lest their body be cut by the wind blade’s trial. Those who delight in the Dao’s truth, diligently focus on the mysterious, not stingy with wealth, valuing the method over riches, the Dao will not fail to exist. Only such persons may be spoken to. Those who love wealth within, but outwardly are fickle and fond, the Dao is already illuminated, but closed within the jade box, sealed with golden gates, after ascending and crossing, it is hidden in famous mountains.”

The right side contains the Most High Jade Capital Nine Heavens Golden Firmament Powerful Spirit Jade Blessing, the Most High Original Scripture Most Divine Tiger Talisman.

The right side shows the Divine Tiger’s great characters and the incantation to summon the spirit. The Most High stores it in the Primordial Chamber, not transmitting it to the world; only those of the highest truth may see it. According to the Great Ultimate’s forbidden method, on the day of ascent, only one person may be transmitted to; after the time passes, it may not be issued again. The transmission ritual is as per the above method. When the above text is given, the disciple must handwrite a copy to the master; after one hundred days, the master sinks it into the Eastern Flowing Water, letting no one see it. This text is called the Way to Transcend the Mortal Path, solemnly pledging the Three Officials’ covenant.

#### The Most High Moving Divine Tiger Great Talisman Formula and Blessing Method

All who receive the Most High Jade Spirit Tiger Great Talisman formula, having completed the oath and reception, the disciple clasps hands and draws a path to give to the master. After receiving the scripture, one hundred days must pass. The master then purifies for three days, using the disciple’s drawn text, along with the oath and blessing, sealing it with iron checks, sinking it into the Eastern Sea’s deep waters. Then, looking up to Heaven, the master blesses:

“Most High True Talisman, Jade Spirit Tiger, the wearer’s name is inscribed in the Immortal Register, erasing punishments and trials, surely making true, dispersing worries and suffering. Do not reveal or leak it; a moment in ten thousand years, solemnly pledging the Water Official, swiftly swearing to the Earth Lord.” After blessing, return directly, and do not look back. This is called the Completion of the Oath. The Three Officials’ Highest Official’s Immortal Register begins here. If after receiving one does not act accordingly, they shall never wear the Divine Tiger script, nor inscribe their name in Supreme Clarity. After three years, the body will also perish, under the long trial of the Water Official.

After the solemn oath, on the day of the Wushen (Earth Monkey) in each season’s month, use vermilion brush to write the text on white silk, making it three feet two inches long, in the style of Bai Wang. Tap teeth seven times, blessing:

“The spirit of the Most High Divine Tiger binds the qi in purple script, contains the shining jade essence, subdues mighty demons, commands ten thousand spirits, the Divine Youth attends guard, jade maidens support the form. I wear this text, commanding golden troops, becoming an immortal king, ascending Supreme Clarity.” Completed, tap teeth seven times, swallow saliva thrice. On that day, place it in a purple silk pouch or plain brocade pouch, to wear on the body.

According to the Four Extremes’ regulations, this talisman is weighty and must not be worn on the human world’s ground. There was once an immortal named Jade Ting who heard and saw it. On the day of receiving the talisman, it must be written in vermilion on white silk, rolled to any size, placed in a pouch, not exposed to dirt or impurity, and may be worn on the form. All matters must be kept secret, not mixed with other scriptures, nor publicly revealed. This is forbidden by the Great Ultimate; be cautious.

The Great Origin Upper Talisman’s spirit essence forms seven-headed Divine Tiger, constantly guarding the body, subduing and destroying evil demons, dispelling misfortune. After receiving the Divine Tiger, one must not speak to others, saying “I have the Heavenly Talisman,” nor reveal the text. If spoken to one person, one tiger departs; to two persons, two tigers; three persons, seven tigers all depart; then the body loses its guarding troops, and evil demons, wicked ghosts, and the Three Officials and Northern Emperor all come to test defeat. If not yet immortal, keep it deeply secret. The Four Oaths’ regulations, be cautious, be cautious.
