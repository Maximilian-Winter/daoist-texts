## The Grand Scripture of the Supreme Clarity’s Great Cavern, Three Scenes, and Jade Clarity’s Hidden Writings and Secret Registers

The Primordial Heavenly King fasted in pure austerity for one thousand days within the Jade Clarity Palace. There, he solemnly made covenant with the Ten Heavens—silent, colorless, formless, nameless, without ancestor or clan, without limit, the cavernous numinous Jade Clarity of nine profound mysteries, natural and countless kalpas. The Dao bestowed upon him the *Great Cavern Three Scenes Three Origins Jade Clarity Golden Tiger and Phoenix Script*. The Jade Boy and Jade Maiden of the Three Heavens entrusted it to later disciples, who bear immortal names, destined to be Jade Clarity Perfected Ones. It was named the Mysterious Terrace Golden Treasury, with inscribed texts and exquisite rites to reverently welcome the true numinous spirits, to fly through Jade Clarity, to gaze upon the cavernous spirits, to be naturally reborn, to serve and guard the Supreme True, to verify immortal titles, to subdue demons and command spirits, descending to the Golden Terrace’s cloud chariot and jade litter.

On the day of the *zi* hour, in the month of the Grand Cycle of a certain year of the Tai Sui, in a certain province, prefecture, county, and village, the names and birthdates of men and women, aged so many years, born in such month, day, and hour, are recorded. From youth they severed attachments, devotedly upheld the Mysterious Writings, diligently morning and night, burning incense and cultivating without cease. They dare to offer incense and faith, solemnly covenanting with the cinnabar elixir, coming before the Master of the Three Caverns, the honored teacher, requesting to receive the *Supreme Clarity Great Cavern Three Scenes Jade Clarity Hidden Writings and Secret Registers*. With utmost respect, they follow the instructions of the former master, purify and make covenant.

Now, bearing this letter, they come before the Master of the Three Caverns. I, your humble servant, in the altar, report to the myriad spirits above, and to the Five Sacred Mountains, the Three Rivers, and the Nine Sources below, all who know and hear. I now, according to the Dao, transmit and bestow the method. After receiving the method, should one violate the covenant and betray faith, the seven ancestors, parents, and the recipient’s body shall long suffer the scrutiny of the attendant officials on left and right, tread the mountain of knives, swallow fire and eat charcoal, endure the twenty-four prisons, the three punishments and five sufferings, and bear endless kalpas without regret. Only beseech to open and bestow, to descend to the true numinous spirits, the Jade Boy and Jade Maiden, the divine officers, generals, and attendants, to support and protect the recipient’s body, to erase and remove guilt records, to register the immortal name in the Nine Heavens’ Jade Calendar, to gaze long upon longevity, and for the seven ancestors and parents to be granted birth in the heavenly paradise and swiftly attain transcendence. May imperial fortune flourish, and the Nine Temples ascend to truth, just as the covenant’s heavenly official’s decrees command.

According to the law, transmit and bestow. The emperor measures the qi’s course; qi comes from the center of Heaven. Heaven transcends the corpse, Heaven births the fetus, Heaven nourishes the qi, Heaven attends the soul. The emperor registers in the joyous cinnabar covenant. According to the law, bestow the incomparable *Jade Clarity Hidden Writings Secret Methods*, solemnly vowing to diligently cultivate, aspiring to become divine immortals, to roam and travel the Jade Clarity’s ultimate blissful abode.

One thousand two hundred Perfected Immortal Officers, Jade Boys and Jade Maidens, clerks, soldiers, generals, strongmen, and envoys, countless myriads of myriads, serve and protect the recipient’s body, swiftly granting transcendence. The nine ancestors and parents are granted birth in the heavenly paradise. May imperial fortune be the foundation, flourishing and blazing eternally. The Nine Temples ascend to truth, the Nine Underworlds are all abandoned, the long night’s darkness is dispersed, evil roots are cut off, and the Three Paths are severed.

Should one violate and betray, be broken midway, the nine ancestors sink and fall, the body dissolves into the Three Luminaries, and no blame or fault shall befall the Daoist master, just as the covenant’s heavenly official’s decrees command.
