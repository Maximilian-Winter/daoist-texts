## The Great Register of the Jade Inspection of the Most High Primordial

In the first year of Pure Emptiness, the year of the Gengyin, on the ninth day of the ninth month, at the hour of the Jia and the direct Chen, the Primordial Heavenly King performed a long fast in the Palace of Supreme Clarity. There he made a solemn pact with the Unsurpassed, the Unpeaked, the Formless, the Shadowless, the Shapeless, the Nameless, the Without Ancestor, the Without Limit—clear and profound, the Most High, eternal by countless kalpas.

The Dao was received from the *Three Primal Jade Inspection Scriptures* by the Three Heavens’ Jade Youths, entrusted to later disciples. Its mysterious name should be the Perfected of Supreme Clarity. It was fixed in the Golden Treasury Jade Tablet of the Elixir Platform, inscribed with purple script and jade-like notices, to honor and welcome the Holy Sovereign, who flies to the Palace of Supreme Clarity, gazing down and looking up, revealing the natural titles of the Cavernous Clarity. Attending the Most True, inspecting Heaven, Earth, and Humanity, summoning immortals, controlling demons, commanding spirits, descending the cloud chariot, receiving the body of the Dharma, as in the solemn pact of the Nine Truths’ Mysterious Rituals.
