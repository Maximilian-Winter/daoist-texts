## Register of the Eight Great Scenes of the Supreme Mystery

On the second day of the ninth month in the first year of the Supreme Sovereign’s reign, the Later Sage Lord Li journeyed westward along the river, surveying the eight directions. At that moment, the Primordial Heavenly King rode forth in his jade chariot of the Eight Great Scenes, mounted upon a nine-colored mysterious dragon, accompanied by three pure flying clouds, leading a host of immortals. He held a splendid banner in hand, flanked by lions and white cranes, their howls and songs resonating harmoniously as they floated through the air, gathering above the western river.

Lord Li bowed deeply and inquired of the Heavenly King: “In former times, I was granted the celestial script—the jade characters of the twenty-four diagrams. Though I attained their text, I have not yet fathomed their wondrous verses. Though there are illustrated praises, no true images accompany them. Cultivating within the hermitage’s mist, the profound principles elude clear explanation. Now, encountering Your Heavenly Reverence, my joy is beyond words. I humbly beseech you to bestow completion and perfect the utmost Dao truth.”

Thus, Lord Li undertook a thousand-day pure fast, incense of five fragrances perfuming his body, facing eastward to wear the talismans. The childlike forms and spirits fully appeared; naturally, all doubts were instantly resolved. Lord Li bowed again, reverently receiving the sacred instructions, faithfully following the celestial rites, maintaining the thousand-day fast, facing eastward to wear the talismans. The three divisions and Eight Great Scene spirits all manifested within his body. The golden script and jade characters of the twenty-four diagrams shone brightly in the void, their writings radiant and vivid, penetrating endlessly, their threads unfolding naturally.

At that time, the master diagram was commanded to be immortalized, and the diagrams were painted accordingly. Golden script, purple characters, jade text, and cinnabar seals took form in sound here. From the Supreme Sovereign of the Southern Pole’s Upper Origin, the Nine Radiances, the Great True King’s Consort, the Eastern and Western Blossoms, the True Lords of South and North, the Five Mountain Immortals, and the Pure Void Perfected Ones—all received the true writings, and these are the images painted by the Later Sage, each connected accordingly.
