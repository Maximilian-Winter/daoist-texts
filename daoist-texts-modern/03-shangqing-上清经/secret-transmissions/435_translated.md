## Record of the Supreme Clarity Primordial Origin: The Great True Jade Secret

**Also called:** The Method of Releasing Form, Escaping Transformation, Flowing Radiance, and Jade Light.

### The Three Evil Gates

The first gate is called the Gate of Color and Desire, also named the Way of the Upper Corpse, or the Realm of Heavenly Followers.

The second gate is called the Gate of Love and Desire, also named the Way of the Middle Corpse, or the Realm of Human Followers.

The third gate is called the Gate of Food Desire, also named the Way of the Lower Corpse, or the Realm of Earthly Followers.

These three evil gates, also called the Way of the Three Corpses or the Realm of the Three Followers, dwell constantly within the human body. They block the mouth of the Three Passes, sever the root of the Three Lives, obstruct the path of those who seek immortality, and suppress the soaring soul of flight. They are the root cause of learning, and if one does not cast off the corpses upon the Three Ways, or abandon desire at the gates of the Three Realms, how can the True descend? How can the Dao be accomplished? Those who pursue the highest method must first dispatch all desires, extinguish the root of the corpses, and then the Dao will naturally descend, immortality will naturally be achieved, and one will be able to soar upward, ascending to the Three Purities.

### The Five Gates of Suffering

The first gate is called the Gate of Color’s Accumulated Suffering of the Heart, also named the Way of Mount Tai’s Hellish Suffering.

The second gate is called the Gate of Love’s Accumulated Suffering of the Spirit, also named the Way of the Wind-Blade’s Suffering.

The third gate is called the Gate of Greed’s Accumulated Suffering of the Form, also named the Way of Bearing Mountains and Carrying Stones’ Suffering.

The fourth gate is called the Gate of Contentious Suffering of the Essence, also named the Way of Rivers and Streams’ Suffering.

The fifth gate is called the Gate of the Body’s Accumulated Multitude of Sufferings, also named the Way of Swallowing Fire, Eating Coal, and Boiling Cauldrons’ Suffering.

These five gates of suffering and five ways dwell constantly within the human body, binding the root of life, obstructing the path to summon the True, and severing the gate to cultivate immortality. They are the root of learning, and if one does not release form upon the Five Ways, nor extinguish traces beneath the Five Sufferings, the accumulated burdens will not cease, sinking into the gates of sin. How then can one escape, transform the body, and flow with radiance and jade light? Those who wish to ascend in learning must first sever all burdens, utterly extinguish the ways of suffering, then the True will naturally descend, the spirits and immortals will naturally form, one will master transformation of form, and roam freely among the heavens.

### The Method to Dispel the Upper Corpse

Use the Azure Script of the Upper Origin to extinguish desire, sever the corpse, transform the flowing radiance, and jade talisman. Place it upon the head. Facing north at the Gate of Color and Desire, holding a blade in the mouth, request a cup of clear water, facing the water. The master stands behind the disciple, knocks teeth nine times, and chants the incantation:

> Upper Corpse, Azure Desire, self-named Peng Ju,  
> Transforming in nine forms, bird’s head, serpent’s body,  
> Chaos without mind, sometimes sinking, sometimes floating,  
> Greed and desire nourish beauty, adorned in splendid hues,  
> Running as human soul and spirit, secretly governing faults,  
> Severing the root of life, dispersing qi, wandering spirit,  
> Wandering the Three Palaces, small insects without toil.  
> True Person A and B, wearing talismans and seals,  
> Desire severed, death’s path removed,  
> Primordial Origin commands, please sever the corpse’s head,  
> The Three Terraces oversee form, swiftly depart without delay,  
> Extinguish root, cut off lineage, leave no remnants.  
> A and B refine the True, Three Palaces pure and void,  
> Five Emperors oversee, Great Unity records,  
> Northern Origin bathes, crowned and robed,  
> Flying beyond boundaries, flowing radiance jade chariot,  
> Transforming and escaping Supreme Clarity,  
> Riding the void to roam.

Upon completion, take the blade from the mouth, the master ties nine knots around the disciple’s head, then buries the rolled jade talisman beneath the Gate of Color and Desire, pouring the cup of water above it. Following this method, the upper corpse is extinguished, color desire naturally removed, the body passes beyond the realm of Heavenly Followers, and form and soul no longer suffer affliction. The Great True Supreme Way must be guarded carefully and not lightly transmitted.

> Sinking and floating, transforming, form without fixed shape,

> Desire’s nature loses spirit, sin caused by small insects.  
> True Person A and B, the Emperor has summoned,  
> Wearing jade talisman, cinnabar script and golden seal,  
> Listed in the Primordial Chart, the Three Desires are gone,  
> Primordial talisman commands, sever and extinguish corpse form,

> Lower Corpse Peng Jiao, greed desire flourishes,  
> White chaos, form without constant shape,  
> Dwelling on both feet, stirring human feelings,  
> Speaking of gains and losses, running as soul and spirit,  
> Disturbing the Three Palaces, the red child unrests,

Upon completion of receiving the matter, begin at the east side with one list, then bow twice, stating the name Wang Jia, now using living mouth to replace form and change name, crossing the gates of the Three Evils and Five Ways. Without a substitute form, the Three Officials and Nine Courts will not listen to one crossing the Three Realms. Therefore, one substitutes oneself, opening the Three Officials of the Supreme Heaven, receiving the Five Emperors’ leadership and name, and the body immediately leaves the gates of the Three Evils and the Five Sufferings. The Earthly Office does not restrain, form and soul ascend as immortals. Those who substitute form may later also take the office of the Chief Registrar of the Three Officials, and according to the calendar of two hundred and forty years per cycle, if meritorious, may also attain the office of the Supreme True. Therefore, those who substitute form must not be ordinary, ugly, or base persons, but must be fine-boned, beautiful, gentle, and careful persons. Only then are they mutually lawful and able to achieve immortality.
