## Record of the Nine Heavens of the Most High Primordial Jade Emperor of Supreme Clarity

Herein is a proclamation to the Nine Heavens, boundless and endless, without ancestor or clan, without form or name, without beginning or end, without sound or silence, within the vast purple void, the mysterious cavern, the abyssal dark, the hidden gloom, the primordial light—an origin before all, the True Void Sovereign of the Dao.

By the swift movement of the Three Numinous Ones, the profound lineage unfolds at dawn; the Dao transforms the imperial foundation, inscribing true nature, weaving subtle spiritual threads. The Nine Emperors advance and retire; the High Emperor is vast and remote, the Primordial Ruler overseeing Heaven’s vault, shrouded in ancient mystery.

Time does not wait for us—daring to report to the Primordial Supreme Reality of the Nine Heavens, universally opening the myriad dimensions, ascending the Spirit Mountain of the Covenant. The Four Directions and the Five Emperors all supervise the covenantal text.

The venerable master Wang Jia, having received the breath and united with the immortals, purified in the mysterious peak, reverently received the Jade Script, the secret ineffable words of the Emperor Sovereign, the most wondrous formulae.

According to the prohibitions and admonitions, none dare betray the covenantal text, violate the statutes, lest the body perish in the River Source, long to dwell in the dark night, burdened by fire and treading the mountains, suffering the Three Paths and Five Pains, never daring to offend the origin.

All the lesser ones have awakened, taking the present as new. The Four Officers and Five Emperors array their memorials naming certain ones, reporting above to the Nine Heavens, below to the myriad spirits, swiftly gaining numinous response.

The perfected ones descend to the chamber, soaring to the light canopy, clad in emerald feathers and azure skirts, coming to greet a certain person, ascending to the imperial dawn, soaring through the Nine Skies, feasting in the radiance of the Three Primes.

On the day of reporting, the Eight Vows are fully opened; all commands delivered are without exception fulfilled as spoken.
