## Record of the Dao’s Traces and the Numinous Immortals

### The Six Palaces Named First

Mount Luofeng stands in the north, at the guǐ position, its height two thousand six hundred li, its circumference thirty thousand li. Beneath this mountain lies a cavernous Heaven, circling fifteen thousand li below, with ghostly and divine palaces both above and below. On the mountain stand six palaces, and within the cavern are again six palaces, each palace encircling a thousand li. These are the six celestial palaces of the ghosts and spirits. The palaces on the mountain are the outer palaces; those within the cavern are the inner palaces, all arranged by the same system.

The first palace is named the Palace of Absolute Yin Severance of Zhou; the second, the Palace of Supreme Killing and Upright Affairs; the third, the Palace of Clear Dawn Enduring the Violent City; the fourth, the Palace of Serene Illumination and Sinful Qi; the fifth, the Palace of Ancestral Spirit and the Seven Offenses; the sixth, the Palace of Daring to Govern the Linked and Repeated. These six celestial palaces govern the six heavens of ghosts and spirits. The six palaces within the cavern bear the same names and images, called the six inner and outer celestial palaces. If one knows the names of the six palace gates of Fengdu, a hundred ghosts dare not harm them. Before lying down, one first faces north and chants thrice softly, the subtle sound as follows:

“I am the disciple of the Most High, commanding the six heavens below. The palaces of the six heavens are under my charge—not only mine, but under the Most High’s governance. I know the names of the six heavenly gates; therefore, I live long. If anyone dares offend, the Most High will behead you.”

The first palace is called the Palace of Absolute Yin Severance of Zhou. From there, eastward lies the second palace, and so on until the sixth palace ends. Then one clicks the teeth six times downward before lying down, to repel the qi of all ghosts and demons. When a person first dies, they first go to the Palace of Absolute Yin Severance of Zhou to receive their affairs. Some may first visit famous mountains or Mount Tai and rivers, but they need not go directly to the first heaven. On the day of receiving affairs, when sins are examined and auspices judged, they must come to this first heavenly palace alone.

The Palace of Supreme Killing governs the killing ghosts; it is the second heaven, where sudden deaths and violent ends also pass through. Worthy and sage persons, upon death, first pass through the Palace of Clear Dawn, the third heaven, to receive their affairs. Blessings, misfortunes, auspices, fate, and sins are handled by the Palace of Serene Illumination, the fourth heaven. The ghost official of the Northern Dipper governs this palace. The ghost official’s Northern Dipper is not the same as the Northern Dipper in Heaven; the ghost official has a separate Northern Dipper lord who governs life and death. The ghost official’s Great Emperor is the Northern Emperor Lord, who governs the first palace and supervises all six heavenly palaces. The other four palaces each have a bright lord governing within. For the second palace, one official is appointed; for the six heavens, there are three officials in total. These three officials correspond to the present-day offices of punishment, overseeing trials and exiles, and are always subordinate to the true immortals who govern fate, commanding and controlling all. They also govern the immortal mansions, jointly managing the duties of death and life; all major judgments and decrees are by the immortal officials.

The ghost official of the Northern Dipper is the Daoist examiner of the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper. This ghost official is subordinate to the essence of the Nine Stars, under the Jade Lord of the Northern Pole. Xiang Liangcheng composed the *Ode to Fengdu*, which says:

“Absolute Yin marks the Emperor’s dawn, Upright affairs meet heavy obstacles. Fiery as smoke in the firmament, Flourishing like splendid radiance. The Violent City girds the Divine Peak, Serene Illumination swallows the Blue River. The gates face the Red Well, Cloud Gate towers majestic. The Seven Offenses link the wondrous canopy, The Linked and Repeated also spread demons. The six heavens stretch across the northern path; This is the home of ghosts and spirits.”

The ode contains twenty thousand words; here only the inscriptions of the six heavenly palaces are briefly presented. Reading it softly at night also wards off evil ghosts.

On Mount Fengdu, trees, waters, and marshes resemble those of the human world, but the grains of rice are as large as pomegranate seeds, tasting like water chestnuts. The other four grains are likewise so, but only named rice and heavy thought. Du Qiong wrote the *Rhapsody on Heavy Thought*:

“Spring mists flourish, verdant is the heavy thought. Numinous qi intermingles, fine grains respond in season. The four festivals are enjoyed, priests offer sacrifices. Divine grain flourishes in the vast capital, Great ears hang across my dark terrace. Here are bright omens, the Emperor shines with radiance—thus it is said.”

The Fengdu rice named Heavy Thought has grains like pomegranate seeds, large and distinct, colored and flavored like water chestnuts, also presented as offerings to the immortal officials.

### The Ghosts and Spirits Govern Second

Yan Qingjia was the ancient Flame Emperor; now he is the Northern Great Emperor Lord, master of all ghosts and spirits under Heaven.

King Wu is now the ghost official of the Northern Dipper. Xia Qi is the Eastern Bright Lord, commanding the Dipper Lord’s army. King Wen is the Western Bright Lord, commanding the Northern Emperor’s army. Duke Shao Shi is the Southern Bright Lord. Wu Ji Zha is the Northern Bright Lord. These four bright lords each have four guests and friends. Yet these four lords will all later receive the way of transformation and ascend the immortal ranks. The four bright lords govern the ghosts of the four directions; the sixteen bright lords command the blood offerings of all the world’s ancestral temples.

Zhou Zhuan is the ghost official commanding fate; now Deng Yue and Cheng Xia replace him due to many affairs.

The Western Bright Capital’s gatekeeper Jia Yi was once in charge of Ma Rong’s affairs but was dismissed and assigned to guard Mount Tai; the Mount Tai lord recently petitioned for him to become a military officer.

The Southern gate’s pavilion chief now uses Zhou Fu to replace Qi Jian. The Heavenly Gate has two pavilion chiefs; each pavilion chief commands four gate attendants, so the Heavenly Gate has eight attendants in total. The gate attendants serve under the pavilion chiefs; this is the Northern Emperor’s gate. The Northern Dipper lord’s pavilion chief is now Zang Hong, who replaced Wei Xiao; another is Wang Boxin, newly appointed.

Ji Zhan was originally the river pacification general’s military officer; now he is a Northern Heavenly gate attendant, replacing Tian Yin Zhan and Yu Tan, guarding the Heavenly Gate daily.

Wei Zhao commands the Marquis of Mount Lu.

Gu He returned from garrisoning Liaodong; after his affairs dispersed, the Northern Emperor Lord appointed him as a cover officer; the cover officer Fan Ming was promoted to Marquis of the Registry.

Yin Hao served Emperor Chen, debating with He Yan.

Wen Taizhen is the overseer of the Sea Opening Count, governing the Eastern Sea; recently he took Du Yu as his chief historian, a position equal to grand general’s chief historian.

He Cidao first served as an internal censor under the Northern Emperor, then received transformation at the Vermilion Fire Palace, because he had previously done many benevolent deeds.

Wei Wudi is the Northern Young Grand Tutor. Many others cannot be fully recalled. These are the affairs of ghosts and spirits, not fit for worldly display, as Xun Gong said.

### The Method of Lying Down Third

When a person lies down, the bed should be high; if too high, earth qi cannot reach, and ghosts’ breath cannot dry. The invasion of ghost qi always follows the earth and rises against the person.

The bedroom must be clean; cleanliness invites numinous qi, uncleanness invites stale qi. Stale qi disordering the room causes failure in all undertakings. The body is the same; one must frequently wash, bathe, and cleanse; otherwise, there is no hope.

Do not say “learning the Dao” or “Dao learning the Dao”—ghosts invade people, affairs fail, causing illness; this means the body is not yet true. The mountains and generations long received Master Meng’s method: before sleeping at dusk, first read once through the *Yellow Court Inner Scripture*, then sleep. This causes the soul and spirit to self-refine and regulate. After twenty-one years of this practice, one becomes immortal—this is the sum of myriad faults. Three or four readings at night are best. The Lady of Northern Peak Jiang said: “Reading this also makes one free of illness; this is the way of not dying.”

### At Night, Clicking the Teeth Fourth

When traveling at night, one often clicks the teeth, an unlimited number of times. Killing ghosts and evil ghosts fear the sound of teeth clicking, so they dare not harm people. If combined with rinsing liquid and incantations, it is even better.

Once there was a man named Bao Zhu, from Jibei, who neither learned the Dao nor knew magic. At over forty years old, he suddenly suffered facial paralysis; his mouth and eyes distorted, wind qi entering his mouth causing his upper and lower teeth to constantly click and strike, making loud noises day and night without ceasing. He lived to one hundred and twenty-seven years. Later, he encountered a great cold crossing a river, fell into the River of Longevity, and died. The Northern Emperor also dispatched killing ghosts and day-roaming calamity messengers to seize him, but these killing ghosts dared not approach. When the ghost official asked why, the heavenly killing ghosts replied: “This man used many arts to control us, always clicking his teeth and beating the heavenly drum to warn the spirit within; the spirit does not scatter, ghost qi cannot enter, so no cause arises to kill him.” By this reasoning, if he had not crossed the river, he might have lived a thousand years without reproach. When he encountered the great cold, walking on water, his mouth was sealed and could no longer click teeth, so ghosts caused his drowning. Those who suffer wind illness and whose teeth click by themselves still avoid death and kill ghosts; how much more so a Daoist who truly clicks teeth and beats the heavenly drum to protect the spirit. The immortal prescriptions say: “Constantly swallowing saliva and clicking teeth makes one grow younger.”

### The Great Emperor’s Officials Belong Fifth

The Emperor Chen has eight attendants: Xu Shu, Pang De, Yuan Yu, Li Guang, Wang Jia, He Yan, Xie Jie, Yin Hao, all residing there, like worldly palace attendants.

The Four Bright Lords and the Northern Dipper Lord each have five attendants to Emperor Chen. The previous eight attendants are officials under the Northern Great Emperor; their selection and use are the same.

There are also four middle-ranking officials, like worldly secretaries: Dai Yuan, Gongsun Du, Liu Feng, Guo Jia; all currently in office. Feng is the adopted son of Xuande, who is now the Marquis of Northern River, opposing Han Sui, and commands the immortal officials.

There are two great palace attendants, like grand secretaries; now Han Guangwu and Sun Wentai occupy these posts.

There are middle palace attendants, like secretaries, with two supervisors: Yan Huai and Yang Biao. Huai’s courtesy name is Siji; Biao’s is Wenxian.

Xu Changshi’s father is now Marquis of Southern Danfang. There are two Danfang marquises, each commanding south and north. Xu Changshi’s father is Southern Danfang Marquis, with Liu Zan as military officer; Bao Xun is Northern Danfang Marquis, with Wei Zun as military officer, each guarding south and north gate keys. Xu commands one thousand southern troops; Bao Xun commands one thousand northern troops, mainly guarding gates and arrests, like the Feathered Forest Guards in the world. Southern and Northern troops resemble Daoist heavenly soldiers and armored warriors.

Sun Ce is a guest friend of the Eastern Bright Lord; Han Gao is a guest friend of the Southern Bright Lord; Jin Xuan is a guest friend of the Western Bright Lord; Xun Huo is a guest friend of the Northern Bright Lord. Among them, those with virtuous deeds in past lives sometimes receive direct appointments as heavenly officials, or enter the southern palace to receive transformation, regardless of rank. The amount of sin and blessing in the living world is measured and adjudicated accordingly. Generally, those who practice virtuous deeds in secret help the poor and distressed, and thus quickly enter the southern palace to become immortals.

Yu Yuan Gui is the Northern Great Emperor’s former central guard general, taking Guo Changxiang as chief historian and Hua Shao as military officer; this is the so-called military lord, commanding thousands of ghost soldiers.

Kong Wenju is the rear central guard general, with Zhang Xiu as military officer and Tang Gu as chief historian.

Tao Kan is the Marquis of Western River, commanding thousands of troops; recently sought Teng Han to replace him, but not yet permitted; Xu Ning is chief historian, dismissed for not capturing the rebel at the northern gate; Cai Mo will replace Ning.

The four garrisons each command ten thousand ghost soldiers. The central officials command only thousands. The four garrisons have Mount Tai Lord, Lulong Duke, Eastern Yue Grand General, Southern Ba Marquis—each commanding ten thousand troops.

He Zeng is Southern Ba Marquis; Cao Ren is Lulong Duke; Liu Tao is Eastern Yue Grand General; Xun Lei is Mount Tai Lord. They command ten thousand troops in their garrisons, with hundreds of posts; those commanding thousands also have hundreds of posts, all mutually subordinate. Each has chief historians and military officers. Zhuan took Gu Zhong as Mount Tai general, using Cao Hong as military officer, Huan Fan as chief historian.

Wang Yishao has been imprisoned for five years, saying affairs have dispersed.

Jiang Ji is Southern Mountain Count, commanding two thousand troops.

Wang Yu is a ghost general. Those with positions are roughly known by name; those without cannot be fully enumerated. Such scattered ones are countless, including Chinese and border peoples alike.

Xu Zhao is now right commander of the Eastern Bright Lord’s attendants; attendants serve like secretaries in the world.

Shao Shi is Eastern Bright Lord, said to have ascended to the Nine Palaces as Right Protector.

The underground masters are again divided into three ranks. The titles of ghost commanders also have three ranks, all based on merit and accumulated virtue. Some seek longevity by Daoist means; some have virtuous children and descendants; some recite and understand the Profound Cavern, transforming and flowing among ancestors. Those who seek are not one, but those who attain have many paths. The key is to accumulate secret virtue in the world, then ascend this broad life.

The ghost commanders of martial and civil divisions are the beginnings of immortality, also called Eastern Flower, a simplified title for the Supreme Emperor, not subordinate to Fengdu officials, nor subject to the three officials’ system. The first rank of underground masters scatter outside the mansions, idle and unemployed, not subject to the Nine Palaces’ teachings, nor hearing of transformation work. Though all dwell in the cavernous Heaven, they are subordinate to the masters. According to the Four Bright Lords’ law, it takes one hundred and forty years by regulation to advance; only then can one begin to ascend the immortal ranks and receive immortal commands.

The second rank of underground masters can directly ascend the immortal ranks and receive immortal commands; after forty years, they advance to management and supervision posts, akin to scattered officials in the world. This rank is the middle tier of the lower masters; Li Dong and others now belong to the first rank.

The third rank of underground masters are the highest masters, able to enter and leave immortal halls and chambers, roam the Divine States and regions, change residences and offices, enter the two palaces of youth and childhood, attend banquets on the Eastern Flower’s upper terrace, receive teachings on transformation, refine their essence and qi. After twelve years, qi gathers the spirit and soul; after fifteen years, spirit returns and hides the corporeal soul; after thirty years, bones return in the coffin, attached to divine spirit and qi; after forty years, restored and reborn, roaming the human world again; after fifty years, promoted to immortal official; after sixty years, able to roam the Broad Cold Palace; after one hundred years, entering the Palace of Kun and Ying. This is the highest rank of masters, indulged by immortals. Zhang Jiangzi and others first entered the third rank, only then entering the palace of change. The ranks of ghost commanders follow the same order. On the twenty-fourth night of the seventh month, the Life Preservation Lord reported.

### The Spirit Man Xin Xuanzi’s Self-Introduction and Sixth Poem

Xin Xuanzi, courtesy name Yanchi, was a native of Dinggu in Longxi. During Emperor Ming of Han’s reign, he was a remonstrating official and governor of three commanderies: Shangluo, Yunzhong, and Zhao. He was the son of Xin Yin. From youth he loved learning the Dao, revering precepts and laws, sincerely practicing austerities. At midday he ate only vegetables, refined his form and guarded his essence, avoiding external things. He refused all invitations from prefectures and commanderies. Sometimes he roamed mountains and forests, abandoning worldly customs and dust. He wished to meet Master Zijin at Weicen, journeying to Junyang to walk the mysterious path, thus changing his name to Xuanzi and self-styled Yanchi. Unaware that many faults of ancestors brought disaster to descendants, he engraved these on the imperial bamboo slips, fate extending to future generations, his life not long, and thus died at the ferry of Changliang.

The Queen Mother of the West saw his austerities; the Fengdu Great Emperor pitied his Daoist heart, petitioned the Fate Office, summoned the Three Officials, who took his form and soul, returning his spirit to true form, making his position a numinous spirit for over two hundred years. Recently he received the degree name of Southern Palace, set his plan at Zhu Ling, storing essence and awaiting the time, now listed as immortal. The Great Emperor now appoints him as commander of the Eastern Sea Marquis, replacing Yu Sheng, and appoints him as middle palace attendant general, governing Wu and Yue ghosts and spirits, supervising affairs diligently—this is also laborious.

As for wearing the crown and blue sash, the desolate feathered sleeves, the ringing immortal steps, turning the jade carriage in the crystal chamber—though truly sincere, the day has not yet come. He regrets not yet joining the ranks of the truly numinous, feasting together on Kunlang’s ramparts, discerning the lost notes of the Jun and Shao, plucking jade ganoderma on the hidden peaks, shaking emerald robes in the Nine Heavens, dancing cloud wings in the Ten Directions.

Now he commands the multitude of ghosts, governing right and wrong, dwelling amid filth, hearing the noise of evil demons’ confusion. His affairs diverge from Dao and virtue; his eyes twice glance and truth grows distant; he is more familiar with the stillness of the Profound Realm, roaming freely in the Great Beginning.

Those of the same voice gather together; things also sort by kind; hearing each other is distant. The pattern is entrusted and accumulated; thus the scripture is named Supreme Clarity, the cinnabar register the mysterious steps. The qi of the Dao combines with numinous virtue, entrusting the body to high radiance, thus they come together. Now three poems are presented, to express the utmost feelings. Their words say:

> “In former days I entered the dark realm,  
> Following the chariot responding to numinous summons.  
> Spirit followed the chamber without dispersing,  
> Qi and auspicious clouds dissolved together.  
> The form is not bright jade essence,  
> How can the mysterious craftsman carve it?  
> Treading lightly, singing in the dark,  
> Raising hands to play the wailing strings.  
> In forest chambers there is rare joy,  
> Beyond this pavilion and outer court.  
> Lingering light attaches to the round brilliance,  
> Fine sounds how sparse and few.”

> “Silent communication entrusts feelings and responses,  
> Mysterious qi gathers and moves with sound.  
> High wheels though uneven,  
> Ten thousand fathoms come seeking.  
> The Daoist refines and polishes,  
> Harmonizing spirit and joining numinous collar.  
> Yielding to the world’s transformations,  
> Heart marks the secluded forest.  
> Together they roam beyond principle,  
> Quietly journeying eastward.”

> “Commanding the chariot to vast Feng’e,  
> Wandering beyond the dark realm.  
> In emptiness there are things,  
> Within which also lacks permanence.  
> Enlightened words have no bounds,  
> Together meeting at Hao Bridge.  
> Eyes witness the mysterious interpreter,  
> Ghosts and spirits’ principles forgotten.”

Xuanzi says: “During Wei, Xin Pi, courtesy name Zuozhi, was my seventh generation ancestor. In the second year of Jianwu of Han, he moved from Longxi to Yangdi county of Yingchuan. Pi served Wei as envoy with the title General Holding the Seal, military commander, and Marquis of the Guard. Pi’s son was named Chang, governor of Henei and Minister of Ceremonies.”

Xuanzi says: “Yu Sheng was the Jin Grand Marshal Yu. The Northern Emperor appointed him as Eastern Pacifying General, later promoted to Eastern Sea Marquis, now serving Fengtai as attendant to Emperor Chen, like a court attendant. The right censor is like the world’s right guard general, highly honored. The left censor is Xie Youyu, with Fengyue as military officer.”

Qi Nanchang Gong was formerly the Southern Zhu Yang Great Gate Spirit Pass Marquis under the Northern Emperor, later promoted to High Bright Supervisor. Once dismissed for disputes with Liu Qingsun, now about to resume office. The High Bright Supervisor is like the world’s secretary deputy.

He Cidao is now in the Southern Palace’s Chenghua Terrace, having received the scripture, now advancing to Southern Peak. He did many benevolent deeds in life, thus early received return form.

Zhou Boren was recently appointed Western Bright Lord’s Central Protector, like the world’s Grand Tutor. Dismissed for selecting Deng You unfairly, demoted to Central Protector, equivalent to Junior Tutor. The right side is what Xin Xuanzi spoke of; many affairs exist in the dark realm, here briefly recorded, no more fully detailed.

### Pei Junshuo’s Seventh Year Record of Daoists

In Mount Huo, there were Daoist learners Deng Boyuan and Wang Xuanfu, who took the method of eating green essence stone rice, swallowing the sun elixir’s radiance, refining the inner chamber for thirty-four years. They saw their five viscera internally, wrote scriptures at night in the dark. On the fifth day of the fifth month this year, the Great Emperor sent a feathered chariot to welcome them. Boyuan and Xuanfu then rode clouds and dragons, ascending to Heaven in broad daylight, now at the Northern Mysterious Garden Terrace, receiving the rank of Middle Perfected Person.

In Mount Huayang, learners Yin Qianzi, Zhang Shisheng, and Li Fanghui, all from Jin Wu Emperor’s time, received the immortal master Guan Chengzi’s steaming elixir and wood method, all taking it to extend life and daily vigor. They also received Su Men’s Zhou Shouling’s method of taking the rosy clouds’ way. For fifty years they refined their hearts and inward vision, no longer eating or drinking, their bodies light and agile, colored like children. On the twelfth day of the second month this year, the Great Unity sent to welcome them; on that day they rode clouds and ascended to Heaven, now at Mysterious State, receiving the rank of High Immortal. Shisheng is the Eastern Source Count.

In Mount Heng, learners Zhang Lizheng and Li Mingqi, Lizheng took Huangjing during the late Han in the mountains, his color vigorous and strong, always like forty years old. Mingqi entered the mountains at the end of Wei, took Ze Xie and Wushi pills, dwelling together in a cliff chamber. Later both received the Western City Lord’s Rainbow Spirit Elixir formula, taking this elixir for forty-three years. They suffered the elixir sand difficulty, but both emerged to Guangzhou as travelers during Teng Han’s governorship. They thoroughly penetrated inside and out, eyes bright and body light, traveling five hundred li daily, also guarding one, for thirty years. On the first day of the third month, the Eastern Flower sent to welcome them; on that day they rode clouds and ascended to Heaven, now at the Chamber of Whirling Winds, receiving the rank of Upper Immortal.

In Mount Lujiangqian, learners Zheng Jingshi and Zhang Zhonghua, both receiving immortal master Meng Deran’s secret formula early Jin, entering mountains to guard five viscera and contain the sun method, also taking hemp seed and the mysterious elixir, long without eating or drinking, their bodies light and strong, reversing old forms. On the nineteenth day of the fourth month this year, the Northern Mysterious Great Unity welcomed them with cloud carriages, ascending in broad daylight, now at Mysterious State.

In Mount Kuocang, learner Ping Zhongjie, from Hedong, came during the great barbarian chaos crossing the river into Kuocang Mountain, studying Song Jun’s Heart Mirror Way, mastering a hundred spirits, practicing the inner chamber affairs, accumulating forty-five years. His essence and form grew thinner, his body possessed true qi. On the first day of the fifth month this year, the Central Huang Lao sent to welcome him; on that day he rode clouds and dragons, ascending in broad daylight, now at the Canglang Cloud Terrace.

In Mount Shanxiaobai, learner Zhao Guangxin, from Yangcheng, crossed the river into this mountain at the end of Wei, received Li Facheng’s qi method, also studied Zuo Jun’s guarding the mysterious way, internally seeing the five viscera and penetrating vision method. For eighteen years he traveled counties and states, sometimes selling medicine, unknown to many. He often came to the county market to make cinnabar into the Nine Flowers Elixir, one dose. On the seventeenth day of the sixth month, the Great Unity Dao Lord sent to welcome him, staying three days, bidding farewell to mountain comrades, then riding clouds and dragons, ascending in broad daylight, now in the Eastern Flower Sea.

In Mount Langwu, learner Yu Wengsheng, from Kuaiji, once received immortal master Jie Jun’s method of eating sun essence, coming to hide in this mountain during Wu times, also practicing cloud qi returning form method, refining and accumulating long, his form thinner like a child. On the twenty-third day of the seventh month this year, the Eastern Flower Great Emperor sent to welcome him; on that day he rode clouds and ascended to Heaven, now in Tanggu Mountain.

In Mount Chishui, learner Zhu Ruzi, entering this mountain in late Wu, took chrysanthemum flowers and wood bait. Later he met Western Returner, who taught him the essential words, entering the chamber to store the mud pellet method. After thirty years, he could cause clouds and rain in the chamber. On the fifth day of the eighth month this year, the Queen Mother of the West sent to welcome him; on that day he rode a five-colored cloud carriage and ascended to Heaven, now in the Accumulated Stone Chamber.

Among the famous mountains and Five Peaks, there are hundreds of thousands of Daoist learners. This year, many attained the Dao and ascended to Heaven, their names too many to list. Year after year, month after month, many depart thus; they cannot all be recorded. Some do not wish to ascend but remain long in the Five Peaks and famous mountains; their number is also countless. Some are appointed immortal officials to oversee famous mountains; their number reaches thousands. On the twentieth night of the ninth month, the Clear Spirit Record was issued.

### Eastern Minister Dao Master Ji’s Rank Eighth

Military officer Ji Master later entered the great palace of Weiyu Mountain’s stone chamber, receiving the stone essence, golden light, hidden radiance, and transformation methods from the Western Mysterious Lady Capital. The Western Mysterious Lady Capital is the Great Profound Immortal Maiden. At the same time, those now in the Great Chamber include Guangyu Bao Shuyang, Taiyuan Wang Yangbo, Yingchuan Liu Weihui, Daijun Duan Jizheng—all disciples receiving the Way from the Western Mysterious Lady Capital.

Before departing, Ji Master entrusted his form and pillow as the image of Wu and Ji. His tomb lies south of Shengpan Mountain in Shujun Chengdu. Zhuge Wuhou once built a stele and inscription before Ji Master’s tomb, the inscription praising:

“Profound vastness and great stillness,  
Mixing and blending yin and yang.  
Heaven and Earth float and mingle,  
Ten thousand things flourish and manifest.  
The Master’s principles stand clear,  
Distinguishing softness and hardness.  
Ghosts and spirits observe,  
The six degrees shine bright.”

Guangyu Bao Shuyang was a minister to Zhao King Zhang Er and Zhang Ao during Han Gaozu’s time, fond of nourishing life and taking cinnamon, but died amid laughter and speech. His tomb is north of Liao Ji City’s mountain.

Taiyuan Wang Yangbo served as an attendant during Empress Lü’s regency, with middle attendant Wang Cai. As a youth he took Ze Xie, gathering herbs with Marquis Liu Zhang Liang on Zhongnan Mountain, but Yangbo did not return, studying under Ji Master.

Yingchuan Liu Weihui was public carriage military officer Liu Feng during Han Jingdi’s time. Later he served Ji Master, took sun and moon qi, became an inner disciple, and attained the Dao. Returning late to his hometown, he entrusted his form to a staff and shoes, died beneath a mulberry tree. His tomb is west of Ancheng County, Runan.

Daijun Duan Jizheng was a recluse, not known to have taken elixirs. Later he studied under Ji Master, traveled Qin Chuan, both attained corpse liberation, and were buried by the river in southern Zheng, Qin Chuan. He was also Ji Master’s inner disciple.

Ji Master had one son and one daughter who both attained the Dao; the son named Fayu, the daughter Jihua, both now in Weiyu Mountain. Jihua today is reading the *Thirty-Nine Chapters*, not yet finished.

Ji Master read the Jade Scripture, took the bright elixir’s essence, drew upon the morning’s radiance; now his color is like a twenty-year-old woman, with a three-foot-long beard, black as ink. Yesterday, the Eastern Minister Dao Lord said, “Such matters are truly strange; I do not know what to make of this.” Ji Master entrusted his form, hiding his radiance, secretly wandering Weiyu. The *Ziyang Transmission* fully records his story. Last night the Eastern Minister came, briefly asking Ji Master about beginnings and ends; Eastern Minister saw and answered. This record is separately presented above; please do not blame it, review and then consign to fire. Afterwards, the sage Lord Li Ji also, mostly similar to the former, but Eastern Minister also added nearly ten thousand words of commentary, a great marvel. Recently many have discussed divine transformations; here only Ji Master is mentioned. Last month I also received the *Divine Tiger Scripture’s Commentary*, unheard of in the world, and did not appreciate its meaning. If I hear more like Ji Master’s, I will report in secret.

Record of the Dao’s Traces and the Numinous Immortals
