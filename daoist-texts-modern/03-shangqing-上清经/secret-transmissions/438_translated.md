## Record of the Many Immortals of the Primordial Supreme Truth

### Ge Hong’s *Book Within the Pillow*

Hong once observed the treasure troves of Heaven and Earth, the palatial mansions of the Highest Sage, the supreme and honored divine immortals’ pictorial records, yet still did not grasp the root of the utmost mystery. On the night of the yichou day of the previous month, at midnight, while in quiet fasting at Mount Luofu, suddenly a fierce wind arose, fragrant scents scattered wildly, dragons roared and tigers howled, pacing restlessly in the empty air. In a brief moment, purple clouds covered the forest, and suddenly appeared a True Person, whose eyes were square pupils, neck bore a round halo, countenance celestial beyond compare. He rode a chariot drawn by a white qilin, bearing the banner of nine pennants, his waist girded with brocade embroidered with jade patterns and phoenixes, head crowned with a six-penetration coronet, appearing about twenty years old. Attendants held night-glowing flames, and a thousand jade-feathered guards stood by. He called himself the Supreme True King of the Mysterious Capital and asked: “Are you Ge Hong? Why do you seek long-lasting existence?” Hong bowed deeply, knelt long, and respectfully presented himself. The divine being said to me: “You are recorded in the auspicious records of the Nine Heavens, riding the fortune of the times, and after another thousand years, will bear the name Immortal Elder of Supreme Clarity. Now you must depart far from the mortal world, choose a dwelling in the Western Village, and together ascend Mount Taihua, within the Elixir Palace. For now, return to court, substituting your body with a dragon’s abyss, silently and secretly passing away, so none will recognize your true self. You are keen to study the ancient texts, bright and outstanding beyond the common crowd, able to untangle stagnation and awaken from confusion—truly a marvelous talent. Yet you do not know the palatial mansions of the true immortals, nor the abodes of the Highest Sage. I now depart; I tell you these plans so you may cooperate—no delay shall there be.” Hong then prostrated and kowtowed. At this, the true god commanded attendants to hold brush and paper, and orally transmitted wondrous words. When finished, he handed the paper to Hong with his left hand, saying: “I go now to the Immortal Official of the One Hundred Square, and will surely visit again. You must strive diligently.” Then he mounted and rose slowly, disappearing from sight.

### *True Record* says:

In ancient times, before the division of the Two Forms, when chaos and vast darkness reigned, no shape had yet formed. Heaven, Earth, Sun, and Moon were not yet complete, resembling a chicken’s egg, muddled and dark yellow. Already existed the True Person Pangu, the essence of Heaven and Earth, who called himself the Primordial Heavenly King and roamed within it. The vast chaos endured four kalpas; Heaven’s form was like a giant canopy, with nothing above to tether it, nothing below to root it. Beyond Heaven and Earth stretched boundless vastness, mysterious and profound emptiness, without sound or voice. The primordial qi was immense, flowing like water. Below were no mountains, above no stars. The accumulated qi was firm and strong, yet soft and supple, Heaven and Earth floated within it, turning and shifting without fixed direction. Without this qi, Heaven and Earth could not be born. Heaven was like a dragon, circling within the clouds.

After another four kalpas, the Two Forms began to separate, moving apart thirty-six thousand li. Cliffs and stones bled, forming waters; waters gave birth to primordial worms; primordial worms gave birth to the binqian; binqian gave birth to the gangxu; gangxu gave birth to dragons. The Primordial Heavenly King dwelled atop the central Heaven, called Jade Capital Mountain, where palaces adorned with gold and jade stood. He constantly inhaled the qi of Heaven and drank the springs of Earth. After two more kalpas, suddenly appeared the Great Origin Jade Maiden, born from pooled blood in a rocky ravine. She emerged able to speak, possessing a complete human form, with celestial beauty beyond compare. She often roamed thick Earth, inhaling the primal Heaven’s qi, called the Great Origin Holy Mother. The Primordial Lord of Heaven descended to meet her, joining qi and refining essence, summoning her back to the Upper Palace.

At this time, the two qi were entangled, enveloping all breath. Yin and yang harmonized, neither hot nor cold. Heaven obtained unity and clarity; Earth obtained unity and tranquility. Neither breathed, qi diffused and merged, naturally full and ripe. The rise of the Great Dao was unsurpassed at this moment. The solid accumulation was firm and enduring, thus imperishable. Gold, jade, and pearls were the essence of Heaven and Earth; taking them completed one’s harmony with Heaven and Earth.

The Primordial Lord passed one kalpa, then begot the Great Origin Mother, who gave birth to the Heavenly Sovereign with thirteen heads, ruling thirty-six thousand years, recorded as Emperor Fusang, Great Emperor of the East, called Primordial Yang Father. Also born was the Nine-Light Mysterious Maiden, called the Supreme True Queen Mother of the West, the Lady of the Western Han. The Heavenly Sovereign with thirteen heads then begot the Earthly Sovereign with eleven heads; the Earthly Sovereign begot the Human Sovereign with nine heads, each ruling thirty-six thousand years. The holy immortals emerged, receiving the Dao and celestial patterns, spontaneously establishing the beginning. The mixed and formed celestial duties, the Three Sovereigns’ celestial patterns now transmitted, were proclaimed here. Thus they could summon the great saints of Heaven and the spirits below, commanding all without exception. Hence the Heavenly True Sovereign People, the Three Heavenly True Kings, ride in chariots drawn by nine dragons.

Next came the Eight Emperors: the Da Ting clan, Fu Xi, Shennong, Zhu Rong, the Five Dragon clans, and others, their descendants, now governing the Five Sacred Mountains. Therefore, in the flourishing age of the Dao, the Three Kings declined. The Three Kings were Xia Yu, Yin Tang, and Zhou Wu. Thus, when the pure winds had faded, change and ritual arose; ritual became the head of chaos. At the end of Zhou, yang weakened and yin strengthened; the country had many widows; the Western Rong and Jin soldiers rose, and strange laws flourished. Soon the Nine Provinces were submerged, the imperial enterprise desolate—this is the truth. Later events unfolded accordingly. In the flourishing age of the Dao, people were chaotic, strange laws thrived, and the populace was cunning and deceitful.

Hong said: “These matters are profound and distant, not known to ordinary learning. I, a mediocre talent, am fortunate to have caught the gaze of the Highest Sage, discoursing on the hidden treasures of Heaven and Earth, freely revealing the source of utmost wonder, and thus recording these teachings on plain paper as a final thought. Those without a heart to divide should not be told of this Primordial Origin. Hence I leave these traces to show the wise of the world.”

### *True Record* continues:

The Mysterious Capital Jade Capital Seven Treasures Mountain encircles ninety thousand li, above the Great Luo. On the city walls stand Seven Treasures Palaces, within which are Seven Treasures Terraces, divided into upper, middle, and lower palaces, like one city palace, with two hundred and forty gates on one side. In the four directions grow eight rows of precious forests, green leaves and vermilion fruits, five-colored magical herbs. Above are twelve thousand kinds of magical herbs, and in the marshes lotus flowers ten zhang in diameter. The Upper Palace is governed by the True Person Pangu, Primordial Heavenly King, and Great Origin Holy Mother. The Middle Palace is governed by the Most High True Person, Golden Gate Lord Laozi. The Lower Palace is governed by the Nine Heavens True Sovereign and the Three Heavenly True Kings. The Jade Capital has eight hundred and ten thousand heavenly roads, connecting eight hundred and ten thousand mountains, caves, and chambers. Those who attain the Dao, great saints, are all granted palatial mansions, all Seven Treasures Palaces and towers, some on the Five Sacred Mountains, some on famous mountains, where mountain and grass immortals dwell, totaling eight hundred and ten thousand places.

Ancient and modern say: ninety-nine times ninety-one equals eight thousand one hundred, the ultimate heavenly road of Jade Capital Mountain. The upper immortals who receive heavenly duties have three daily audiences with the Supreme True Person of the Mysterious Capital. Though the distance may be billions of li, coming and going is but a single step—how could common folk know this? Many immortals have daily audiences with the Fusang Emperor or thrice daily with the Queen Mother of the West. The Jade Capital Golden Gate is governed by the Most High True Person, with monthly audiences to the Primordial Heavenly King and Most High True Person. The disciples of the Primordial are like emperors with ministers and chancellors. Laozi of the Golden Gate is a disciple of the Most High. The Fusang Emperor governs the eastern direction with the yang qi of the Primordial. Hence earthly emperors’ sons correspond to the Eastern Palace.

The Western Han Nine-Light Lady governs the yin qi, ruling the West. Hence called Wood Duke and Metal Mother, revered gods of Heaven and Earth, refining primordial qi, generating all things, harmonizing yin and yang, illuminating sun and moon—all derive from them. Spirit endures long; life has no end. Embracing the One without separation, thus longevity is possible. Heaven losing yin and yang causes irregular floods and droughts; humans losing yin and yang exhaust spirit roots and life. People fail to preserve the One and guard the Three, cultivating life but meeting death—this is fitting, who can complain? I will, within a thousand years, summon my disciple to ascend the Most High Golden Gate and feast at the Jade Capital. This momentary flash is not long-lasting; for now, one may roam the Five Sacred Mountains, gather spiritual herbs, seek friends among hidden immortals, wandering carefree and effortless. My words are trustworthy and hopeful.

The Fusang Emperor dwells within the Blue Sea, his domain four sides, square thirty thousand li, above which stands the Supreme True Palace, a jade-green city ten thousand li wide, abundant with forests whose leaves resemble mulberry. There are also mulberry trees thousands of zhang tall, twenty girths around, growing in pairs from the same root, leaning on each other, called Fusang. The palatial mansions resemble the Jade Capital. Countless immortals dwell here on the Mysterious Continent, those not yet ascending to Heaven reside here, six ten-thousand li from the shore of Kuaiji, governed by the Immortal Elder of Supreme Clarity, the Most High Elder. Mount Penglai faces the northeast shore of the Eastern Great Sea, the mountain encircles five thousand li, waves crash sky-high in the dark sea, governed by the Nine Qi Elder.

Kunlun Mysterious Garden is a golden pond city, a thousand li square, with five golden terraces on the city walls, twelve jade towers, houses of jade blossoms, chambers of purple, emerald, and cinnabar, piled with seven treasures, gold, and jade reaching to the heavens. Gigantic beasts ten thousand zhang tall, spiritual incense countless, governed by the Queen Mother of the West’s Nine Lights, with countless immortals.

Elder Guangcheng, now the True Person of Zhong Mountain, is a Nine Heavens Immortal King. During the Han, the Four Elders—Anqi, Pengzu—now all assist here.

Wuchengzi and Limozi are True Persons of Mount Min. Now Xuanzhi and Yuzi are Lords of Mount Min.

The Taihao clan is the Blue Emperor, ruling Mount Dai. Zhuanxu is the Black Emperor, ruling Mount Taiheng. Zhu Rong is the Red Emperor, ruling Mount Henghuo. Xuanyuan is the Yellow Emperor, ruling Mount Songgao. Jintian is the White Emperor, ruling Mount Huayin.

These five clans are the Five Emperors.

Yao ruled Mount Xiong’er, Shun ruled Mount Jishi, Yu ruled Mount Gaizhu, Tang ruled Mount Xuanji, Qingwu ruled Mount Chang, and Fengxiu ruled Mount Chang.

These five assisted the Five Emperors, managing their affairs; when one kalpa ends, assistants replace the Five Emperors.

Xuyou and Chaofu are now attendants of the Nine Heavens, Lords of Mount Ji. Xia Qi and Zhou Fa received titles as Bright Lords of the Four Extremes. Some dwell at Luofeng, some in the Cavern Heavens. The three great Zhou are True Persons of Jiangling; two reside on Mount Jinhua. Han Gaozu and Guangwu are guests of the Four Brights. Zhou Lingwang is now attendant of the Great Void, governing Mount Bolong. Yuezi and his entire family attained immortality but have not ascended to Heaven, residing in the rooms of the Square, the Divine Continent receiving the Great Mysterious Life Register, with five magical herbs as food. Guo Jingchun is Chief Recorder of Fate, governing the Void Terrace. Zuo Yuanfang is now True Person of the Heavenly Pillar, supervising Immortal Lords. Ge Xuan received orders from the Golden Gate Lord, serving as Left Immortal Duke of the Supreme Ultimate, governing Mount Gaizhu and also Mount Nüji, often riding tigers. Xu Yingshi first was Immortal of Huo Forest. Xu Mu established a dwelling in Huayang Cavern Heaven, as True Person. Xu Yufu is north of Tongchu, titled True Person, but has no office. Bao Liang is Lord of the Underworld, True Person of Daiqian Mountain, and after five hundred years will serve as Deputy Commander of Kunbing. Zheng Siyuan dwells in South Huo, often riding tigers, leopards, and white deer, without official duties. Cai Yulei is the Eastern Ghost Emperor, governing Mount Taoqiu. Zhang Heng and Yang Yun are Northern Ghost Emperors, governing Mount Luofeng. Du Ziren is Southern Ghost Emperor, governing Mount Luofu, commanding Qiang and Man ghosts. Zhou Qi and Ji Kang are Central Ghost Emperors, governing Mount Baodu. Zhao Wenhe and Wang Zhenren are Western Ghost Emperors, governing Mount Bozhong.

Earthly immortals roam the Five Sacred Mountains, each morning paying homage to the Queen Mother of the West, each evening resting on Zhong Mountain. Though not yet ascending to Heaven, this joy is hard to express. At the Office of Tongchu, the palace of easy migration, this is the only delight. Among famous mountains, each year immortals depart unseen by the world; people do not believe in immortals—how pitiful! Those who study without regard for body and life, with pure and clear heart and will, I have never seen go in vain. Some cultivate but not diligently; diligent but do not remove the pleasures of greed; the three karmas and ten evils remain unchanged—still clutching a stone while crossing the Long Ford.

Wu, Yue, Liang, and Yi have pure and upright airs, thus many immortals. Therefore, the region of Chengdu, the domain of Danyang, southeast of Kuaiji, is where heavenly roads converge, well suited for cultivation and reverence. All these immortals, and the vast multitudes who receive fate and registers, cannot be fully recorded. Those dwelling in the small mountains are also briefly enumerated.

Master Guigu is the Supreme Mysterious Teacher, governing Mount Qingcheng. Prince Qiao is attendant of the Golden Gate, governing Mount Tong□. Chisong is Immortal Elder of Kunlin, governing Mount Nan. Prince Deng is a Minor Heavenly King, governing Mount Wangwu. Guzhu, Boyi, Shuqie, and others are all Nine Heavens Vice Ministers, governing Mount Tiantai. Confucius is the Great Supreme True Lord, governing Mount Jiuyi. Yan Hui received the register, first serving as attendant of Bright Spring, later as True Master of the Three Heavens. Seventy-two disciples received names on the Mysterious Continent, with three thousand followers, not passing through the North Feng gate. Xiang Yi Mountain is Commandant of Penglai. Duke Zhou Dan is teacher of the Northern Emperor, governing Mount Jingge. Zhuang Zhou is Doctor of the Supreme Mysterious, residing on Mount Jing. Sun Quan received office, also governing Mount Jing. Zhang Daoling is Master of the Three Heavens Dharma, commanding the Six Voids, frequently attending the Golden Gate, the Most High’s chief aide, governing Mount Lu, where the three masters reside together. Wang Fangping is now Prime Minister, governing Wushan of the Yue people. Mo Di is Supreme Ultimate Immortal Minister, governing Mount Majian. Xu Laile is Supreme Ultimate True Person, governing Mount Kuocang, with a small palace on Mount Tiantai. Chen Anshi governs Mount Xiaotai. Yan Junping now governs Mount Emei. Qu Yuan is Sea Lord, commanding the Eight Seas. Wang Bi is overseer of the Northern Sea. Guo Shengzi is True Person of Langfeng. Lady Wei governs Mount Nan. Pei Qingling governs Mount Siming. Ma Mingsheng now dwells on Zhong Mountain. Yin Changsheng is Earth Lungs True Person.

Sun Deng is True Person of Wenqiu. The True Consort of Mount Jiuhua governs Mount Xiagai, sometimes on Mount Long. Wang Chang and Zhao Sheng received registers as Central Protectors of Lu Mountain’s Orthodox One of the Three Heavens. Han Zhong is now True Person of Huo Forest. Langya Yuji is Left Clerk Attendant of the Great Void.

The Three Mao are Keepers of Life and Fate Registers, supervising the non-monitoring office, governing the northern residence in Huayang Cavern, resting on Mount Bao with several thousand small mountains, none less than one hundred—these are all sacred mountains. Now briefly confirming the number of immortals is enough to strengthen your heart’s reverence. Keep this secret and do not proclaim it. If the noble mind yearns beyond the ridges, at the time of your passing, you may seal and show it. If one’s practice is not established, virtue not benevolent, one will never see the heavenly orders. Among the green ridges’ folds and the thousand mountain passes, immortals are countless, standing shoulder to shoulder with the world yet unknown. Those with cause and condition may wander lost in the mountains, entering immortal households, detained by immortal maidens of the caves, requesting prior merit. Beginners need not enter mountains; close doors and diligently cultivate, avoiding worldly persons, fasting long and holding to resolve, or with pure incense and sweeping, can also summon the true. Lady Wei and the Xu clan are of this lineage. One must long study the true books of the arts and methods, transmitting and influencing roughly, then one may vanish utterly. If entering and leaving the human world, temporarily leaving mountains and valleys, attending to clothing and food, no need to mingle with the world—there will be difference. Outwardly harmonizing light with dust, inwardly guarding one’s true unity—this is the subtlety of the words.
