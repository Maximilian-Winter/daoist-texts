## Record of the Three Honored Ones of Shangqing

### Record of the Three Honored Ones, the Supreme Elders of the Nine Heavens

The Perfected One said: Since the times of Shangqing, Lingbao, the Three Sovereigns, the Five Sacred Mountains, and the Five Thousand Texts, all have cultivated and honored these Three Honored Ones. This is indeed the original gate of the Jinming’s first response. The celestial beings of the Ten Directions who have teachers of Jinming’s way are thus illumined together with me in the Jade Realm. From here, one may cease and simply transcribe the divine true diagrams and talismans. Do not hastily write what came before, lest one incur guilt.

## Preface to the Jinming Mysterious Response Chapter

The Perfected One of Emptiness and Nothingness said: My teacher Jinming, in times past, responded to the Red Bright cycle, alongside the High Supreme Nine Heavens Supreme Sovereign Yuan Jun,  

The Perfected One said: Yuan Jun is the title of the Nine Heavens Supreme Jade Void True King Dao Lord, who governs upon the Bright True Platform of the Nine Heavens.  

The Nine Heavens Supreme Sovereign Old Lord,  

The Perfected One said: The Old Lord is the High Supreme Jade Void Supreme Old Lord, also called the High Supreme Jade Emperor, or sometimes the One Sovereign of Dongzhen, governing upon the Nine Heavens Platform of Shangqing.  

Together they ride the sun and moon jade wheel chariots, roaming above the Great Origin Bright Firmament and Broad Han, surveying beyond the Eight Vastnesses, traversing the smoke transformations of the Nine Origins. They return to ascend the Dongluofu Broadly Connected Brahma Heaven,  

The Perfected One said: This heaven is the true name of the Jade Void Southern Pole Flying Heaven Upper Nine Vermilion Heavens, the domain governed by the Jade Qing Wing Sun Void Sovereign Dao Lord.  

The Jinming Jade Nation,  

The Perfected One said: This is the general name of a domain among the various heavens. Only the Eight Extremes Void Sovereign Emperor roams here, within which lie the Three Radiances Flowing Bright Golden Morning Treasure Palaces, wrapped in thirty thousand layers of natural jade patterns. The treasure palace is surrounded on all four sides by flying morning jade brilliance, shining with light. This palace is also called the residence of the Void Sovereign Lord, the dwelling place of the Jade True Golden Immortals.  

The Dongming Jade Platform,  

The Perfected One said: This platform is the name of the Jade Void Southern Upper Vermilion Mound Platform. The platform rises ten thousand ren high, its midst filled with flowing essence treasure radiance and mysterious brilliance, bright pearls and jade light. It stands condensed and firm, this is the spiritual platform. The platform naturally shines with radiant clarity, illuminating the void and reflecting the southern Yuanliang heavens. It is also the residence of the Jade Qing Supreme Bright Supreme Jade Emperor.  

The Spirit Capital Cavern within.  

The Perfected One said: The Spirit Capital is the upper capital of the Vermilion Heaven Supreme Origin Void Sovereign Dao Lord, within which are the Three Yuan Cavern Heavens: the upper cavern of great silence, the lower connecting to the boundless domain, and the middle where the Three Yuan Primordial Qi Elders govern. Within the cavern heaven flows natural shining jade essence, vermilion clouds, phoenix hues, sun and moon brilliance, flying dawn smoke, constantly blazing within the Three Yuan, resembling the flourishing fire. Here the Primordial One once refined the great true texts, and to this day this supreme spiritual treasury remains. Hence it is called the Cavern Ear.  

Those who attain the Dao and ascend as perfected ones invariably first visit the Southern Vermilion Cavern Heaven to refine their physical corpse qi, further receiving bright images, their golden visage shining, treasure-bright and solemn, their wondrous form complete, their body akin to the flourishing brightness of the vermilion sun. Only then may they ride the void and float upward, ascending the supreme silence above, their radiance majestic and awe-inspiring, splendid throughout the Ten Directions. Truly, their body enjoys eternal preservation here.

In the first year of the Mysterious Origin, in the month of Jiawu, on the first day at noon, together with the Great Radiance Primordial Three Honored Ones, they received the *Dongxuan Lingbao Yuanshi Wulao Chishu Zhenwen* (Cavern Profound Spirit Treasure Primordial Five Elders Red Scripture True Text).  

The Perfected One said: This year’s title is Sun and Moon, all within the Red Bright kalpa era. The Great Radiance Primordial Three Honored Ones are the Primordial High Void Sovereign. By the time of the Supreme Sovereign’s first year, five kalpas had already passed.  

At that time, the Three Honored Ones descended and ascended the Jade Treasure Ever-Bright Altar.  

The Perfected One said: The Jade Treasure is the center of the Vermilion Heaven, naturally flowing with gold, jade essence, sun and moon brilliance, condensed and truly formed into this altar. The altar is ninefold, corresponding to the number of the Nine Heavens, rising nine thousand ren high, shining upon the Ten Directions. This is where Jinming ascends, the Mysterious Response receives affairs from the Primordial Heavenly Venerable.  

The True Sovereigns of the Nine Heavens, the Supreme Three Heavenly True Kings, and the Primordial Five Elders supervise and swear an oath, with Heaven, Earth, and Water Officials as witnesses. Only the true are yearned for.  

The Perfected One said: “Only the true are yearned for” means the mysterious holy response, the wondrous transformation just beginning, the great vehicle guiding and receiving, universally beneficent without end, pervading the Six Paths, great compassion and mercy, broadly aiding the Ten Directions, the dharma treasury pure and void, free from dust and desire, pure as a wondrous mirror. It is not a matter of companionship or common practice, but a direct oath at the dharma summit’s bright height, clear within the Four Symbols, condensed and serene, beyond ordinary reason, and not within the scope of human intelligence or images.  

The Ten Directions all shine,  

The Perfected One said: At that time, the heavens and earth of the Ten Directions all felt auspicious responses, jewels fell like rain, celestial beings of the Ten Directions received blessings, hidden and manifest alike rejoiced for over nine thousand years, the sun and moon ceased their wheels.  

The Nine Heavens all attested,  

The Perfected One said: The True Sovereigns and True Kings thus proved it.  

To those who approximate the true,  

The Perfected One said: This means the cycle has not yet begun, so the way and dharma are simplified to correspond to people. If not of golden bone and jade treasury, one cannot receive it. If not the named scripture, imperial edict, or mysterious diagram, it cannot be transmitted.  

Opening deliverance without measure, long filling the blessed bridge of the Ten Directions.  

The Perfected One said: Without the Nine Heavens’ cycle texts, Lingbao would descend teachings to save the world at the kalpa’s end. Thus universally aiding the Ten Directions, all are spared the disasters of water and fire, deliverance without limit. Hence it does not choose good or evil; all who return to the dharma vehicle are delivered to the blessed shore, bequeathing seeds for future generations. Without Lingbao’s merit, how could this be? It is said the virtuous kalpa is met, Lingbao descends teachings, all mixed false dharmas and pseudo-ways self-extinguish, only this dharma flourishes. Thus one knows the countless deliverances, universally benefitting myriad beings. Therefore, the compassionate dharma enriches the Ten Directions, always with great compassion, moistening the Three Realms, widely benefiting without obstruction, illuminating beings with wisdom, able to accomplish all heavenly and human dharma practices, settling the mind to attain stillness, guiding all to practice serene joy, severing the karma of ignorance, moment by moment returning to emptiness.  

Hence it reveals the honored scriptures’ thirty-six divisions of wondrous chants, encompassing all emptiness and form, various causes and conditions, manifesting signs of vexation, knots of delusion, showing beings the suffering they face, unresolved and incomplete retributions, the fundamental karma of birth and death. Thus it opens the gate of wondrous good great practice, enabling sentient beings to rightly see the difference between guilt and merit, to cultivate the Ten Precepts, to rely on the Ten Virtues as supreme power and twelve paths to follow, to depend on and practice clear laws, to gather and receive the confused masses, to awaken to that great silent supreme realm, to transcend the three evil paths, even enemies and friends alike. Without Lingbao’s merit, how could this be?  

The Perfected One of Emptiness and Nothingness said: The true dharma is to respond to true awakening with true teaching, to awaken the confused masses to the true path. The wondrous principle is profound and mysterious, truly beyond human intelligence to discuss, how dare one frame it within body and mind? Moreover, the Three Honored Ones respond according to the cycle, pervading all without exception. They appear or remain according to the kalpa’s needs; the source of wondrous transformation, if not for this response, who else could bear it? Thus the divine marvel of wondrousness reaches the holy wisdom, truly the spirit of Jade Heaven draws near, to reveal the source depths of the Great Dao. The dharma nature is profound and subtle, transcending the Nine Pure Ones, comprehending myriad ways in the unformed heaven, thus responding. Its power shines upon the Four Symbols’ red radiance, opening darkness in the mingled chaos, the Two Modes follow to gain control. Thus the spiritual diagrams glow wondrously in eight assemblies, responding within the Great Abyss, so all directions awaken clearly here.  

Once the hidden darkness is illuminated, the deep sleep universally awakened, it is because of this tree of words, words that expound principle. Yet there are established teachings of supreme sages, whose radiance bursts forth like clouds, truly transformation masters. They respond to what is felt, uniquely able to be unhindered among myriad things, thus leading wisdom’s power to follow transformation’s merit. This is called the Dao, the utmost wondrous respect of ultimate transformation, wondrous beyond compare, called the great treasury’s master. If one points to its source and purpose, the abyssal sea has no equal, thus it cannot be grasped by words or images. The empty heart is vast and faint, not of the Three Realms’ discourse, merit surpassing the ends of numbers, truly standing beyond mind and cognition. It is naturally non-action, nameless yet doing all, not the emptiness of emptiness, formless yet manifesting all forms. Thus all dharmas gather, and no image is not responded to, not the emptiness of great stillness, no spirit is not responded to, no ancestor or lineage, emptiness without nonexistence, the response of emptiness.  

It pervades the profound Ten Directions, spread throughout the void, all matters entrusted, nothing not entrusted, united in one purpose. Thus it can govern all beings, widely flourishing above myriad images, standing alone beyond myriad mechanisms, through countless kalpas and thousandfold blessings, always the supreme true dwelling place of spirit’s silent realm. The Great Dao’s limitless vastness, how could it be pointed to by form or spoken of in its wondrous domain? Yet all beings have long been asleep, not responding would mean no awakening, not transforming would mean no understanding. Therefore, my teacher Jinming came from the divine heavens to descend, preserving this kalpa’s assembly, the true Dao descending teachings, like the light of a morning lamp, like the wondrous mirror of Jade True’s first response. It enables divine true wondrous awakening, illuminating the Ten Directions, flowing light through the Three Realms, also opening the Six Paths, expanding the heavens, shining brightly among the saints. Not only the eternal vow of wondrous treasure’s preciousness, but also forever the mother of myriad dharmas. Thus it attains eternal deliverance from suffering seas at the kalpa’s end, entrusting sentient beings’ utmost sincere reliance, their blessings firmly established. It may be said the Six Perfections, Four Classes, and Three Lights all illuminate the directions, all reach divine wisdom, thoroughly penetrating hidden and manifest, with no barriers or crossings. The Three Treasures’ magnificence is thus exalted. The Jin Standard and Jinming’s recipients are the destined numbers of Red Bright. If one takes their wondrous essence, there is ultimately no duality. Truly observing nature’s thusness, what master or friend is there besides oneself? Returning is one, responding is many; not my wisdom can fathom the wondrous mysteries of the ancestral school. Having been commanded by Jinming to compose the Record of the Three Honored Ones, how dare I offer but a glimpse through a bamboo tube to annotate it? Thus I record it to show the future cycle’s later students and comrades.

The Golden Supreme Heavenly Treasure Jade Emperor said: At this time, the Supreme Void Jade Heaven High Ancestor Void Sovereign Dao Lord, the Limitless Jade Qing Void Perfected One, and the Limitless Nine Heavens Elders,  

The Golden True said: These Three True Ones are all disciples of Jinming’s Supreme Wondrous Entrance into Stillness Scripture.  

Each was sent by Jinming to transmit the Three Honored Ones’ jade lineage records, establishing the wondrous chapter of golden seals and upper scroll jade scripture, presented before the Primordial One of the Original Heaven. At that time, the Heavenly Venerable entrusted the Three Treasures Jade Emperor with the record, storing it in the Supreme Void Jade Heaven Treasure Purple Radiance Golden Brilliance Flowing Light Great Radiance Treasure Emperor Upper Palace, attended by the jade children of the Jade Heaven’s Ten Directions and Golden Morning, each thirty-six in number. The Perfected One constantly burns natural incense of a hundred harmonies reversing birth, scattering blossoms of five-colored flowing clouds and hundred treasures, guarding the Three Honored Ones’ record jade scripture. The cultivators of the Ten Directions who reach the supreme Dao and meet the bright cycle, if they obtain the Three Honored Ones’ record scripture, shall be on the same platform with the Three Treasures and treasure the record. This is the supreme true wondrous true’s true work.  

The Golden True said: Those who receive the jade scripture must keep it with the Three Caverns’ wondrous scriptures, offering respect and worship. Do not be negligent or defile the Three Honored Ones. The jade children attending the scripture will report your offenses to the heavenly treasure, and the wind blade will suddenly arise upon your body.  

Jinming said: Celestial beings who obtain my Dao may, according to their dharma’s order and level, write down the Three Honored Ones’ record jade scripture. Place the scripture in a brocade and colorful pouch, keep it with the Three Caverns’ scriptures as an offering. If you have no place to keep the Three Caverns’ scriptures, you may set up a separate chamber, as if offering the Three Caverns’ scriptures, burning incense and worshipping morning and evening. At that time, practice with respect and reverence, never departing from the dharma rules, must maintain worship without leaving even for a moment. The Three Honored Ones’ Dao eye will long be a mysterious mirror, your heart will thus be moved to the Ten Directions, penetrating the utmost truth, communicating wondrous stillness, descending the flying truth, ascending the Jade Realm, entering the formless, receiving eternal preservation, embodying golden spirit. Beside you the jade children attend, and the Dao’s truth is fulfilled.  

The Golden True said: If you can preserve respect and reverence for the jade scripture, then the great saints and heavenly gods of the Ten Directions, as well as the officials and attendants of the Three Realms, will all come to guard your gate, constantly bowing to its text. The celestial true also descends thrice monthly to worship the Three Honored Ones’ record. How much more so the ghosts and spirits who guard and the celestial beings who attend? How could one not revere and honor them?  

Jinming said: The Three Honored Ones are the Three Treasures. The Dao’s supreme wondrousness, their honor is limitless and supreme, boundless and immeasurable, without high or low, truly limitless. Be most cautious, most cautious. I now sincerely and earnestly entrust you to achieve truth here. If you have no mysterious response of the Three Honored Ones, who then shall deliver you in the great silence of emptiness?  

The Golden True said: This scripture of Jinming has come from countless kalpas past, to deliver the heavens of the Ten Directions, the supreme true great saintly honored gods. If it were not for the turning of the dharma wheel, none would encounter this.
