## The Supreme Three Origins Spirit Talisman for Securing the Residence

The Supreme, Supreme, Supreme Origin, Primordial Most High Jade Emperor, Sovereign of the Limitless Great Dao, on the fifteenth day of the tenth month in the year of Ren-Shen, at the hour of Yin, the Dao Sovereign descended upon the layered city palace atop Mount Kunlun. At that moment, the Perfected Ones arrayed in the void, their majestic radiance splendid and vast, condensed above the celestial expanse, proclaimed a luminous decree to the Seven Perfected of Golden Radiance:

“You shall become the masters of the true dharma of the Ten Directions’ celestial and human realms in the coming era. Those who aspire to genuine realization must first urgently save the world, thus should widely accumulate merit and virtue, opening the path to salvation for Heaven and Humanity. Such merit is unsurpassed; when accomplishment is fulfilled and virtue universal, one naturally attains the Dao.”

At that time, the Seven Perfected, embodying true essence, fully manifested the Ten Observances. The Golden Origin soared into stillness; the Mysterious Celestial Venerable, in the supreme silence beyond all nothingness, bowed deeply and respectfully, then inquired of the Celestial Venerable:

“Since recent times, the Three Realms have collapsed and sunk; between Heaven and Earth, the air is thick with the strife of humans, ghosts, and soldiers, clamoring day and night. In this age of the final kalpa, how can the Seven Perfected, humble and ignorant, know how to aid? We humbly beseech your enlightened instruction, so that the Seven Perfected here may ascend to true awakening, becoming a bridge of salvation—not only to receive grace in this life but also to aid future generations, broadly extending deliverance. We earnestly hope the Celestial Venerable will grant us vision, pitying the Seven Perfected’s shortcomings.”

Then the Celestial Venerable declared to the Seven Perfected of Golden Radiance:

“You are destined to receive the prophecy: you shall become the great saints and masters of the true dharma of the Ten Directions, turning the golden true dharma wheel. The power of this dharma wheel is the supreme, most wondrous true dharma, the king within the great vehicle. Its merit and virtue are majestic and vast, encompassing all phenomena; truly, it possesses immeasurable merit incomparable to any other. Only those of the highest nobility and supreme nature can establish such merit and plant this foundation of blessing. Yet the sentient beings of the Three Realms are drowning in the sea of suffering; the dead’s remains sink in dark nights; souls endure torment; the living are unfortunate. In this final kalpa, amid the workings of the Three Calamities and Five Impurities, with evil reaching its peak and disasters and soldiers running rampant, how can one not grieve? Yet this great vehicle’s highest merit and virtue are not the constant practice of all under Heaven. Therefore, I now bestow the Supreme Origin Heavenly Official’s Spirit Inspection Divine Talisman for capturing ghosts, subduing demons, and gathering essence—the Great Talisman—called the *Supreme Three Origins Residence Pacification Talisman*. It serves to uphold and assist the righteous qi of Heaven and Earth, to aid the nation and support the times, to command the Three Origins by talismanic decree, thereby enabling salvation of the world. It is sealed with the seal of the Most High Three Origins, placed above the gates of the celestial-human hall, to expel and drive away demons, spirits, plagues, pestilences, and calamities from the Ten Directions and Five Directions of Heaven and Earth; to suppress all poisons, harms, and inauspicious qi; to control the transformations of malevolent spirits and monsters, ensuring none escape; thus forever preserving the household’s effortless peace. Those who possess it shall be protected from the Three Calamities and great disasters amid the Five Impurities. If a ruler of the Way governs the land, their blessing shall be peace; if sovereign and ministers walk the Way, the state and altar shall endure forever.”  

The Seven Perfected bowed twice and respectfully requested to receive the spirit talisman.

Then the Celestial Venerable said to the Seven Perfected:

“Now I shall proclaim to Heaven and Earth, so all may bear witness and swear the covenant. The head talisman of this pacification talisman shall inspect and capture all improper qi, bringing it into the true dharma. The Seven Perfected respectfully accept and vow to diligently practice according to the dharma.”  

Having completed the transmission, the Celestial Venerable ascended into the void, vanishing from sight.

## Preface by the Seven Perfected of Golden Radiance

The true dharma is the true dao. Thus, it can awaken to great enlightenment, ascend to true awakening, enter wondrous awakening—truly profound and wondrous indeed. The subtlety of the subtle, the highest wonder, how can it be captured by words or images? Except for the Mysterious Sage, who dares point beyond images and lead within images? The spirit talisman originally comes from the Supreme, Supreme, Supreme Origin, Primordial Most High Jade Emperor, transmitted from endless kalpas, always practiced in the final kalpa. It emerges to save the world, to relieve suffering in the Yin Nine and protect the Hundred Six without harm. Thus, the Dao Sovereign’s compassionate transformation is not for self alone. The true teaching is like a loving mother, always mindful of her infants, like a skilled physician curing illness, wishing efficacy. This is the vehicle of salvation; those who follow it are likewise. Yet sentient beings in the Three Realms, amid vexation, heat, and suffering, their lives like flickering lamps, how can they know their pain, mistaking it for joy? I observe the confused, truly not joyful. Lifespan is but a flash of lightning, ending in the eight sufferings, long kalpas, the five poisons, ten sufferings of the dark path—what joy is there? Before the body dissolves, they see the world’s clamor, disasters unnoticed, much less the sinking remains. It may be called the compassionate true teaching descending, illuminating the dark path, clarifying the Nine Nights’ darkness, opening the gate of the mirror of wisdom to shine upon the unawakened masses, enabling them to penetrate the six wisdoms, clearly without obstruction. Thus, the living household enjoys auspiciousness, the deceased ascend to heavenly transformation, wandering spirits roam freely, benefiting future generations’ peaceful existence. This is the true teaching of the spirit talisman, ensuring the household’s transcendence of the Five Impurities and protection from the Three Calamities and Six Harms. Its function governs the movements of Heaven and Earth, much less ghosts and spirits, yet does not extinguish souls. The Supreme Three Heavenly Jade Officials’ true dharma troops are such mighty spirits by nature. The soldiers likewise are trustworthy; how can the masses comprehend?
