## The Primordial Register of the Three Hundred and Sixty-Five Divisions of the True Numinous of the Nine Heavens of the Supreme Purity, Golden Verity, Jade Emperor of the Upper Origin

Golden Verity said: On the day of the Guǐhài year, the fifth month, fifth day, at noon, the Seven Perfected Ones received from the Most High Jade Morning Lord the Upper Origin Spiritual Register. Now nine years have passed. The precious register of the Seven Perfected Ones enfolds the divine spirit and breath, never once failing the sacred script. Again, on the fifth month, first day, noon, of the fifth year of the present Supreme Purity era, the exalted Heavenly Treasure Jade Emperor descended in truth within the Qiong Palace of the Belt Ridge, and once more the Seven Perfected Ones composed and fixed the Upper Origin Mysterious Register of the True Numinous of the Nine Heavens, establishing the ranks and titles of officials and generals therein.

Golden Verity said: At that time, the exalted Heavenly Treasure Jade Emperor spoke the Golden Secret Words to the Seven Perfected Ones, saying: “This Upper Origin Three Hundred and Sixty-Five Divisions of the True Numinous Generals and the Mysterious Register of the Heavenly Officials were not created by later disciples. Their essence is the Upper Origin Flying Condensed Pure True Vitality, responding to the natural bright movement, thus becoming true beings. They wear naturally the five-colored flying feather robes; their forms are all Vajra-like, their bodies extending over three thousand zhang. Their subordinate officers and generals wear naturally the three-colored flying azure feather immortal robes, constantly stationed in the Nine Heavens of the Upper Origin, assisting the Thirty-Six True Emperors in governance. Therefore, their methods correspond to the Four Symbols of Heaven and Earth, the Jade Pass and the difficult mysteries of the Three Hundred and Sixty-Five Correct Degrees. They also correspond to the governance of the Nine Mornings, Three Lights, Seven Luminaries, and the Twenty-Eight Constellations, the Nine Palaces, Eight Trigrams, and the Three Hundred and Sixty-Five Degrees of Correct Position. They also correspond to the Three Hundred and Sixty-Five Qi of the Four Seasons of Heaven and Earth. At the core, they govern the turning of the forms of Heaven and Man, the Three Hundred and Sixty-Five joints and viscera. Above, they preside over the movement of the correct qi of Heaven and Earth; in the middle, they support the life of the Heavenly Emperor’s foundation, the bright destiny of sovereigns, the regulation of the Three Origins, and the transformation in the virtuous kalpa; below, they rescue the Three Realms’ myriad beings, open the gate of true dharma in great light, ferry Heaven and Man across the bridge of blessings, aid the eight hardships in the sea of suffering, extract souls from the three paths of the Six Paths, heal the world’s diseases with the mysterious register, guard against heavenly calamities with the spiritual officials, ferry the nine breaths with divine功, protect the destined body with heavenly soldiers, preserve blessings through kalpas, exorcise the ten evils in the heavenly court, restrain poisonous ghosts with divine generals, control myriad demons with heavenly truth, repel myriad disasters with spiritual officers, subdue myriad spirits with heavenly might, pierce hordes of monsters with divine power, extinguish water and fire with divine wisdom, dissipate foul qi with azure waters, sweep away noisy dust with golden winds, protect the destined form with wondrous qi, cure a hundred diseases with heavenly physicians, and stabilize the destined joints with true精. Thus, their功 is all-encompassing, without exception, their法 embodying the measure of Heaven, Earth, and Man. They constantly follow the bright運 to descend and teach, ferrying beings through the final kalpa. They preserve the state of non-action in the future. Their法 shall flourish in the era of the Spiritual Dragon. At that time, sovereigns practice the dao and cultivate virtue—that is their運. The imperial throne enjoys peace—that is their功. The life of Heaven and Man is unscathed—that is their福. The Most High has said: When this盛 arises, it is the culmination of myriad dao, the awakening of the mysterious model, the great vehicle in motion, thus preserving the destined heavenly years and attaining parity with the Three Origins. Truly, this is功 of nature, opening the度 without difficulty. Hence this preface is composed to clarify功. Later sages, perfected beings, and those who trust and esteem it, must reverently observe and practice it.”

Golden Verity said: The Seven Perfected Ones received the exalted mysterious register, the Golden Secret Words, establishing the ritual and assigning the register regulations, all compiled into this one scroll. The mysterious register’s運 constantly follows the natural運 of the Seven Perfected Ones, assisting the Thirty-Six True Emperors’ governance, reigning in the virtuous kalpa. The Ten Directions’ Heaven and Man, if ignorant of the completion of myriad dao, only see false regulations and discard them, then the Three Caverns shine forth, the true scriptures are clear and bright, illuminating the pure and peaceful, shining like a Dharma mirror. The orthodox dao is in motion, the法乘運功 is in effect, thus the洞經 arises, the法教 flourishes, myriad demons are subdued. At that time, Heaven accepts no sacrifices, spirits accept no worship, ghosts accept no offerings, demons hide, evils vanish, the Six Heavens are correct, wild dao is subdued. At that time, true celebration arises; how could the Ten Directions’ Heaven and Man not rejoice? Now this afterword is roughly stated to confirm. Transmit to later sages, do not dissect this scroll to distinguish external matters, but make another scroll. Whoever offends shall suffer the wind blade’s punishment—be cautious. If one wishes to transmit, simply seek this text, not exceeding the lineage. Take care and guard oneself. The Jade Emperor’s true will must not be violated; the Seven Perfected Ones’ scripture body truly dares not fail the sacred teaching.
