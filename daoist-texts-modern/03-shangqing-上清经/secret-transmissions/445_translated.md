## Chart of the True Numinous Positions and Offices of the Cavernous Profundities and Numinous Treasures

### Preface to the Chart of the True Numinous Positions and Offices of the Cavernous Profundities and Numinous Treasures

To gaze upward into the mirror of mysterious essence, to speak of the vast and the minute shining forth; to look downward over the level plains, to behold the towering depths of the rocky seas. To search for the threads of humanity, to investigate the ranks and orders of the morning spots; to study and synthesize the celestial scriptures, to measure the gradations and offices of the true numinous. Yet names and ranks, hidden and manifest, titles advancing and retreating, within the Four Palaces, resemble and intersect in doubt. Now is the time to properly compare and classify the scriptures, to carefully collate robes and insignia, to match their heights and lows, to distinguish their palatial domains. Moreover, there are appointed units and offices: the Supreme Emperor of the Dao, the Five Emperors, the Seven Elders—such are the comparisons and classifications. Briefly stating names, the example of Mo Yu and Meng Zhuo is given. Sometimes the same rank is held by different persons, as with the Four Emperors of the Golden Palace, the Four Primes of the Supreme Ultimate, and the examples from the lower teachings. When offices are equal but traces differ, these are the examples of the various steps and hierarchies. For example, the Realized One Xilin is the Right Duke of the Supreme Subtlety and leads the Nine Palaces’ chief ministers, yet is not appointed as the Northern Banquet Supreme Clarity; this is known to those intimately acquainted. Such cases are difficult to verify absolutely. It is said that those who succeed to what they lead, following the higher domains, roughly sorting and distinguishing all matters, will be briefly explained in the following chapters. If one, with shallow knowledge, belittles the ranks of the highest sages, confuses ascent and descent, reverses the order of steps, and thereby causes offense to the Profound Mansion and entangles the dark bureaus, this is a grave fault. With utmost sincerity and clarity, I present this in the hope of illumination and reflection. If anything is surely improper, I beseech admonition and warning. What is here expounded truly draws from the secret intent of the annotations, preserving the essential points of the tradition. I pray and humbly request that the ranks and orders be properly entrusted according to their dignity and precedence; when confronting true and differing matters, one must thoroughly investigate the weight and lightness encountered. Therefore, the Three Lords jointly disclaim, first expressing regret for those who have not yet grasped the learning; those of lower rank dwelling above, wisdom may fail to reach. Though all bear the title Realized One, the true grades number many; all are called immortals, yet immortals themselves have ranks numbering in the thousands of millions. Without careful and detailed leadership, those with only slight knowledge of the origin are like rustic men entering the court, seeing officials in vermilion robes and calling all of them generals—how could they understand the distinctions of noble and commoner, or discern the differences and similarities of ranks and titles? — Tao Hongjing, Preface.
