## The Chart of the Seven Domains of Cultivating Truth and Attaining Realization

In the leisure of his abode, the Yellow Emperor ascended the Terrace of the Morning Star, where six sages stood attending him. They were Tianlao, Limu, Dahong, Taishan, Qixi, and Pengzhang. They spoke among themselves of the dao of non-action and the essentials of long life and cultivating truth. The Yellow Emperor said: “If I were to pay homage to the Lord of the Purple Mansion in the Azure Hills, to Master Ning in the Green City, to the Lord of Supreme Harmony in the Fiery Continent, to the Heavenly True Sovereign on Mount Emei, and inquire about the profound principles of the Five Teeth and the Three Ones, the wondrous methods of soaring to immortality and long life—though I practice, I have yet to fully comprehend. Moreover, human beings receive life with form, flesh, and blood as their substance; yet the function of the dao is emptiness, void, and serene detachment without form. How can one, hindered by tangible substance, verify the formless dao?“

Tianlao replied: “Heaven and Earth and all things follow the transformation of the dao. From non-being arises being. Human affairs, flying and running, attain the use of the dao; from being they return to non-being, as easily as turning the palm of the hand. If one can cultivate and grasp the essentials of the dao, from essence one becomes spirit, from spirit one becomes qi; when qi unites with the dao, though hindered by form, flesh, and bones, by mountains, rivers, and seas, one can soar and lift them, transform and transmute them—nothing is impossible, nothing cannot be done.”

Tianlao said to the Yellow Emperor: “The people of the world are children of the dao, born of qi, divided into form to govern their life. Heaven provides spirit, Earth provides essence, the dao provides qi; these three harmonize, and thus man is born. Having obtained the body, one must preserve the qi, cherish the essence, and maintain the spirit; only when these three are in harmony can one achieve long life. Yet people do not know that the body is born from the dao; they abandon the root and pursue the branches, seeking death instead—how deeply lost they are! The method of cultivating the dao ranges from the mundane to the sage, ascending and descending through the seven domains. In one domain alone, there are fourteen thousand methods of cultivation; throughout the seven domains, ninety-eight thousand gateways to the dao, and paths to ascend to truth—all lie in diligence and perseverance. Thus one may attain ascent to Heaven.”

The Most High Dao Lord’s *Silent Dao* says: “Those who study the dao face nine afflictions, all great illnesses of man. If one clearly knows these afflictions, immortality can be attained. The nine afflictions are: one, having the will but lacking the time; two, having the time but lacking companions; three, having companions but lacking the will; four, having the will but lacking a teacher; five, having a teacher but not studying; six, able to study but not diligent; seven, diligent but unable to hold to the dao; eight, able to hold the dao but the will is not firm; nine, able to firm the will but unable to endure long. Therefore it is said: among a thousand ordinary people, there is one who knows the dao; among a thousand who know the dao, there is one who cultivates the dao; among a thousand who cultivate the dao, there is one who specializes; among a thousand specialists, there is one who is diligent and perseveres. Cultivate with diligence and perseverance, and the dao can be hoped for. If from youth one loves the dao, with a single unwavering will, neither water nor fire can frighten the heart, neither glory nor wealth can confuse the will; cultivating truth and embracing simplicity, in time one will meet a teacher, and need not worry about lacking one. Thus one need not rely on companions to succeed, nor be moved by external influences. This is the broad essential teaching for those who study immortality. Those who cultivate the dao should ponder and be diligent. The ranks and rewards of cultivating the dao are arranged as follows:”

The Dao Lord said: “The marvels of the immortal dao all have their methods. To fully master this dao is to become a True Person of the Nine Palaces—not merely to ascend as an immortal. Yet the dao has many methods; when all are complete, one may understand. Born into the world, those who do not know the dao are no different from grass and trees, no different from birds and beasts; they are called mundane people. Among mundane people, those who awaken clearly, know there is a Great Dao, and arise in heart to cultivate and learn, seeking to save the world, are called Daoists, also called travelers on the path.”

## Postscript

The Heavenly Venerables cherish life exceedingly; the Dao Lords’ teachings are vast; Lord Lao’s salvation of people is profound. The Three Saints revolve and transform, rescuing the bewildered and confused, all desiring to preserve the form of flesh and blood, equal to the eternity of gold and stone, extending the life of morning mushrooms to match the years of the great tree. From the mundane to ascend as immortals, from immortals to ascend as true beings, from true beings to realize sainthood—riding dragon chariots, roaming the great void, lifting the Nine Ancestors from the nether darkness, enjoying longevity through countless kalpas. Yet the people of the world, receiving the dao’s qi and born from the dao, disdain the pure, void, serene, and detached origin, pursue toil and the realm of splendor and bustle, like oxen and horses drawn to heavy mud, unable to free themselves, sinking ever deeper—how painful indeed! The wish is that the superior practitioners diligently cultivate and seek abundant blessings for themselves.
