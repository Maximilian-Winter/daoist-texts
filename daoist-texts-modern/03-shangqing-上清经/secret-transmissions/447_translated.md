## The Supreme Clarity Cavernous Truth Wisdom Body-Contemplation Great Precept Scripture

The *Wisdom Body-Contemplation Great Precept* has drifted through scattered radiance, illuminating the vast emptiness, accumulating over more than thirty kalpas. This text was received by the Primordial Heavenly King from the Most High Lofty Sage Dao Lord. Together they ascended the hall of Cavernous Truth, spoke and chanted it, passing it orally to the Great Emperor of Supreme Subtlety and the Primordial Supreme Immortal Heavenly King—spoken from mouth to mouth, never inscribed in writing.

When the Great Emperor of Supreme Subtlety received the precepts, he intoned:

> Wisdom arises from the rootless source,  
> Bright and clear beyond the Ten Directions.  
> Binding emptiness, towering in mysterious skies,  
> All heavens embrace the flowing fragrance.  
> Its marvel is hard to fathom or conceive,  
> The void perceives the real and communicates.  
> Being and non-being, all are not without,  
> Non-being and being, all are contained.  
> Wisdom constantly contemplates the body—  
> The first step in learning the dao.  
> Subtle and profound, let the mystery roam free,  
> Naturally recording my spirit.  
> The Heavenly Venerable always guards,  
> The Demon King serves as protector’s word.  
> Shining, the adamantine body,  
> Transcends before the Most High.  
> Wisdom gives birth to the root of precepts,  
> True dao’s precepts are the master.  
> The Three Treasures arise from this,  
> Revered and received by the Lofty Sage.  
> Crossing this immortal boat,  
> Swiftly ferrying the great abundance.

When these precepts are spoken, all heavens come bowing in homage.

### Words of the Primordial Heavenly King:

“The *Supreme Cavernous Truth Wisdom Scripture* is not revealed to worldly scholars. It is widely transmitted and has already become true. People see it and find it difficult; seeing it, they cannot fully grasp it. Therefore it is rarely seen in the world. These precepts are solemn and cannot be spoken of lightly. They contemplate the myriad spirits and three hundred joints of the human body; the true spirit must not rashly depart, and demons cannot violate it. Those who receive and recite these precepts without breaking their prohibitions may not need to study further yet will emerge as clouds and mist; the azure chariot will naturally welcome them; the white sun will ascend to heaven; their floating body will ride the empty waves; they will radiate round light in all directions, shining upon the Great Void; leading the host of heavenly saints, none dare fail to revere them. The Great Demon King of the six heavens then raises the precept-receiving disciple to the Eastern Splendor Palace, which is called the Great Brahma Heaven Palace; the Great Brahma Heaven Palace is called the Jade Capital Golden Gate. This is the highest grade of the upper immortals.”

The Primordial Heavenly King said: “Reciting the *Great Cavernous Truth Scripture* ten thousand times summons cloud chariots to welcome you. The *Lingbao Dongxuan Scripture* contains the text of kalpa crossing; some who cultivate it do not become immortals, nor do their Golden Elixir or numinous fluids succeed. Why? Because they do not observe and uphold the *Wisdom Body-Contemplation Precepts*. These precepts are the marvel of marvels, supremely powerful and revered. Nine hundred Golden Flower immortals stand to serve and burn incense. This is the true secret dao, not transmitted in writing, only to be recited and practiced. Those who study the dao without receiving these precepts will never become immortals. Some create karma, following sounds and colors; some begin diligently but end slackly; some enter mountains or homes but are tested and defeated by demons; some generate strange thoughts and doubt the true scriptures; some return to the mundane and lose the dao heart; some slight teachers and friends, insult fellow students; some suddenly go mad or foolish, their nature and temperament reversed; some covet wealth and lust, thus slighting the Three Treasures; some family paths are troubled, resentment and opposition arise; some have nightmares and chaotic thoughts, their spirit depressed and sorrowful. All these arise from lacking the great precepts to govern heart and spirit. The three poisons float like corpses, cunning and deceitful; the five viscera know this is the trouble. The Demon King does not erase the record of life and death; the Three Realms are but immortal grades.”

The Primordial Heavenly King said: “These precepts appeared through numinous immortals, causing all heavens, earths, famous mountains, and immortals to uphold and practice them. On each new and full moon, the eight festivals, one’s birth star and original spirit, the heavens’ fasting days, fellow students and teachers enter chambers to recite the precepts once around. First, they bow to the Ten Directions, one bow to each direction. When the heavens hear the precepts recited, they all make their own reverent bows. Disciples who wish to uphold the precepts should offer five taels of superior gold as the trust of the Five Emperors, and ten zhang of cinnabar brocade as the tribute of the Ten Directions. The alliance of the fallen hairpin must not leak the precepts, to serve the teacher who holds the precepts. They fast three days, contemplating the precept’s meaning. That night, ten lamps are lit to offer light to the Ten Directions’ Great Saints, expressing the disciple’s heart. If at that time wind, rain, thunder, or lightning are fierce, one must not receive the precepts. One must fast again, redouble respect and solemnity, for the spirit may scatter and the mind disperse. Upholding the precepts for nine years, the spirit candle shines clearly; the sun and moon radiate cinnabar; the golden visage shines within; the youthful face fills the skin; spiritual powers reach all directions, matching the high immortals in virtue. Going in and out without hindrance, those who uphold these great and strict precepts may wash in the flowing pools of Miluo, be lifted to the Seven Treasures’ terrace, roam and observe the floral pools’ shade, return to fragrant forests, brilliant with golden light, flourishing from kalpa to kalpa, forever enjoying the true dao. If one’s birth star is exactly midnight, recite the *Most High Returning Mysterious Great Chapter* facing north, to enter the Supreme Ten Directions.”

The Great Emperor of Supreme Subtlety said: “These precepts are named the *Wisdom Body-Contemplation Precepts*, also called the Immortal Spirit Protection Text, also called the Supreme Cavernous Truth Life-Saving Numinous Elixir. Without accumulated merits and blessings from past lives, one will never be allowed to see this precious secret. Eastern Splendor has no gold slips or jade names, nor will it allow meeting this teacher. Those who can uphold it, their fate is to become immortals. Having scriptures but no precepts is like wanting to cross the sea without boat or oar, like having a mouth but no tongue—how can one ferry the body? Those who study but do not seek scriptures, or seek scriptures but not precepts, have not grasped the root of true essentials; they dream long without awakening, which is truly painful. All should measure their own ability to uphold and accept it. Those who receive it orally take nine hundred years to pass it to one person, no more than one. If passed to more, it is leaking the precepts. The guilt of leaking reaches seven generations, parents descend to dark hells; the body suffers the three paths, five sufferings, eight hardships; through kalpas it repeats; turning the wheel of evil paths, the day of immortality recedes; enemies and debtors meet at the appointed time. All must guard themselves carefully.”

The Great Emperor of Supreme Subtlety said: “Dare any eavesdrop on the precepts, they will be seized by great demons, surely meeting calamity without doubt. If a disciple upholds the precepts, dwelling alone in mountains or fearful places, sounding the twelve heavenly drums, keeping the precept spirit in mind, the precept spirit guards them threefold; demons, ghosts, and spirits dare not approach; blessings and virtues follow them; all heavens’ good spirits each protect them. Former enemies and debtors all become compassionate.”

The Great Emperor of Supreme Subtlety said: “When I first began study, I only knew to request scriptures, not to seek precepts, and so passed through kalpas of birth and death. The Most High pitied my dao heart; the Lofty Sage grieved my unyieldingness, and told me: ‘You study diligently but do not uphold the *Body-Contemplation Great Precepts*, how can you become immortal?’ I bowed beneath the Golden Gate for three thousand days; the Most High appeared and granted the essential precepts. Upholding and cultivating them, within nine years cloud chariots came to welcome me; True Persons of the Three Realms and Ten Directions gathered in mysterious void. Therefore, dao study must place precepts first; the dao family’s honored root. The dharma should be practiced and recited orally; ancient sages kept it secret and fully recorded it. Now to uphold it is the same; do not let the text fall to the mundane.”

### The Most High Bright Lamp Chant:

“Before seeing such lamps, all should recite this text, not only when receiving precepts. Click teeth three times, subtly, so others do not hear the sound; all tooth clicks are thus.”

The Most High scatters lamps to the Ten Directions; radiant lamps connect with true sincerity.  
All heavens do likewise; all earths are bright and clear.  
My body also shines through; the five viscera birth radiant splendor.  
The blazing light shines upon the Great Void; distant thoughts flourish in Jade Clarity.  
Elixir essence dwells in the Great Void; mysterious yang points to the empty midst.  
Containing form, extinguishing roots of suffering; profound subtlety reaches true thought.  
Drooping blossoms do not manifest reality; conditions show light and image.  
My body is likewise so, riding transformation, entrusted to flowing radiance.  
Night light reveals the yang cinnabar, far shining upon the spirit chamber.  
All heavens universally shine bright; all darkness is extinguished.  
My spirit is also intelligent, always playing with wisdom and insight.  
Free and easy, adapting to the dao’s movement, changing and yielding, following Heaven’s will.  
Raising form, leaping through empty caverns, night candles blaze and gather radiance.”

The Great Emperor of Supreme Subtlety said: “Merely lighting lamps without knowing this chant, the six heavens’ demon palaces are but places of death and fate; the eight directions’ heavens do not send jade boys and jade maidens, flying True Persons to descend upon you. The Ten Directions and Three Realms will not ferry your immortal name to the Eastern Splendor Southern Palace, nor accept your seven generations of ancestors’ path of transformation.”

The Great Emperor of Supreme Subtlety said: “Dao practitioners who recite scriptures ten thousand times but do not uphold the *Body-Contemplation Precepts*, even if secluded in mountains and forests, their ascent to immortality is unlikely. If one can perfect the precepts within and harmonize light without, one may approach the shore of numinous standards. The dao is not difficult; upholding precepts is difficult. If you can perfect the precepts, I, the Most High of the Ten Directions, will surely protect your ascent to immortality. Perfect precepts and recite the precious scriptures, wear the great talisman; if still not immortal, then the world’s original path to immortality is lost. I lament that in this age, people seek fame in vanity, rarely seeing true dao virtue; thus the Three Treasures are dimmed and sages hidden. Is this not the failure to propagate the dao? If one fully receives the precepts, the Ten Directions’ great saints will naturally appear to you; immortality is achieved without study. This is no falsehood—what else to say? It is true compassion for the world’s aspiring ones. When conditions meet, there will be those to teach. You must strive and be diligent; once the immortal dao is attained, what joy is greater than roaming freely in the Most High Jade Capital, letting go in the realm of nature? This is the joy before the Most High, unending through kalpas. This cannot be conveyed by mere writing.”

### The True Person of the Great Ultimate said:

“I once heard from the Most High: reciting the Three Treasures’ Cavern Scripture without the great precepts, how can the myriad marvels of the immortal dao be accomplished? Therefore it is passed mouth to mouth only, not written, to remain secluded in the Three Treasures’ garden enclosure. Those without the appearance of the supreme immortals will never see it. Only by the accumulated blessings of seven generations, flourishing branches, conditions and leaves, and profound effort through kalpas, can one know the joy of the *Most High Body-Contemplation Precepts*. Those who uphold this become the Most High Great Dharma Masters, the root of the Three Treasures. The Ten Directions all revere you in the Milky Way; the host of immortals will lead you to Eastern Splendor, summoning the heavenly demons. The Demon King raises the talismanic command over the Three Realms and Six Heavens’ life and death registers; the Lord of Mount Tai, the Earthly Official, no longer has records of death and response; the Blue Palace immortal name is fixed here. You will become the Jade Capital’s high immortal, the Most High’s True Person.”

The True Person of the Great Ultimate said: “The dao’s essence lies in practice in accord with profound methods, accumulating inner goodness and sufficiency; only then can one begin to cross the great dao’s boundary. Those unable to do so are but laboring in wind and dust, no benefit to life’s cultivation or lifespan. The dao is within me, not outside; only compassion and love, patience and endurance—if one can practice these four, one dwells near the dao. If one can be diligent and faithful, begin and end well, accept admonition, abandon lust and wine—these six perfections are also companions of the true. If one can accept wrong without complaint, yield to others, desire nothing, tolerate injustice without contention, dwell far from the dao in secluded places, not violate the heart, not betray scriptures or precepts, not break the oral precepts—these eight abilities are also good friends of goodness.”

The True Person of the Great Ultimate said: “The precepts as dao are majestic and mysterious; fearing people cannot wholeheartedly accept them, they are kept secret and unwritten. Thus the wisdom scriptures cannot be fully revealed to late learners. Passed mouth to mouth, how could they be leaked? When the precepts are spoken, the Ten Directions’ heavenly beings cross hands in respect and listen; ghosts and spirits all pay reverence. How could what is heard be treated lightly?”

The True Person of the Great Ultimate said: “Ancient people’s dao was profound and silent; quieting spirit and thinking truth, naturally unmoving, sitting in forgetfulness of the true dao, already perfected, the cloud chariot stands to welcome. Some ride wind to soar in the air, drive dragons to roam the void, raise their bodies leaping without support, fly to the Great Ultimate, embodying the empty cavern without waiting. Thus their traces cannot be seen; the world does not know me; those who know me are rare; thus I am precious—this is said. The accords are matched. If teachers or friends rely on deceitful words to be stubborn, this is not the ancient method, nor the late learner’s rule. If scholars wish to request the precious scriptures, carefully examine the person; if their mind is enlightened, then present the scripture before the Most High, explain and entrust it, so they may follow the text and revere it. This accords with the Most High’s profound methods and great dharma. If lacking the talent to propagate the dao, how could the seven ancestors certify the Ten Directions, and yet violate this? One should first deeply reflect whether one can uphold it. The three paths, hells, ten sufferings, and eight hardships—how can they be taken lightly? Seeing this chills the heart. For the wise, good, cautious, and clear precepts, blessings naturally arise. For those who turn their hearts away, calamity naturally follows. Suffering is close and sharp; the moment is not to be missed. Why prolong death through kalpas?”

The True Person of the Great Ultimate said: “Even through kalpas and beginnings, these precepts are the unchanging dao. The ancients said: ‘Upon receiving and practicing, the dao is accomplished; sometimes it manifests outwardly, sometimes not; the world cannot measure what is cultivated.’ The ancients gained the dao by donning robes and sitting in forgetfulness; Xuanyuan forged cauldrons and dragons came to welcome; thus they could contemplate the Ten Directions and transcend the Three Realms. Wang Qiao and Chi Song rode purple smoke to soar to the heavenly court—all of this kind. It cannot be fully told or recorded. Is this not what is called ‘not studying yet achieving immortal dao’?”
