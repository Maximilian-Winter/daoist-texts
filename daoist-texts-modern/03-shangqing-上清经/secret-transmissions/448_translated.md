The Great True Text’s nine articles of method serve to examine those who uphold the Supreme True and practice Immortality.  
A minor test spans three years of life, facing myriad sufferings;  
A middle test is self-extinction, losing the rank of Immortal;  
A great test lasts nine years, the wind-blade kalpa, losing human path.  
Minor merit reveals worldly brightness,  
The Three Realms attend and protect,  
No hardship is in vain;  
Middle merit commands myriad spirits,  
Summons naturally the Five Emperors,  
Associates with perfected beings;  
Great merit achieves the Dao,  
Ascends by daylight to Heaven,  
Climbs the Heavenly Gates,  
Roams freely in Supreme Clarity.  
Merits and faults are itemized as in the Great True Methods.

Within the scroll are talismans and red inscriptions.
