## Scripture of the Supreme True Jade Emperor’s Illumination of the Four Extremes

### Scroll One of the Scripture of the Supreme True Jade Emperor’s Illumination of the Four Extremes

At that time, the Most High Great Dao Lord bestowed upon the Venerable Supreme True Jade Emperor the *Illumination of the Four Extremes*—a code of one hundred and twenty statutes for the Five-Colored Divine Officials. The upper section inspects the Heavenly True Ones, the middle governs the Flying Immortals, and the lower administers the punishment of sinners. Such jade writings all emanate from the Venerable Supreme, annotated by the Supreme Administrator, and stored within the Sevenfold Reflections of the Jade Void’s Purple Chamber. The jade brilliance of statutes, the fragrant dispersal of golden immortals, the five emperors’ divine troops numbering five hundred million, their swift feathered steeds, all serve as spiritual guards. Through countless kalpas without end, presiding over the five changes of fate, the nine-fives shifting the Mandate, the Realized Ones verify and assist the unified sacred governance. There exist golden bones and jade repositories, mysterious charts and purple slips, titled under the Shangqing tradition, transmitted according to the code and solemn oath.

The Most High addressed the Golden Palace Emperor Lord, dispatching the Nine-Spirits Jade Consort to cast golden slips bound with silver, having the Turtle Mother press the brush, the Supreme True one sweep the mat, the Purple Dawn scatter incense, the Supreme Splendor hold the cloth, and the Pure Fast within the Purple Chamber to compile the jade scrolls. They requested that the cloud brocade pouch be sealed with cinnabar seals. Thus, the Most High Great Dao Lord summoned the Twenty-Four Emperors of the Supreme Jade Void and the Thirty-Nine Perfected Ones, ascending to the Highest of the Highest, the Unreflected Qi of the Purple Jade Official, the Golden Radiance Jade Hall, the Nine-Twists Chamber. They commanded the Five Emperors’ divine troops, the Ten Billion Officials of the Four Extremes, the poisonous dragons and giant beasts, all guarding the Ten Heavens. At that moment, there appeared drifting rosy clouds and feathered canopies, a thousand perfected beings in mulberry groves, the nine-colored festival, winged auxiliaries at the spiritual passes, divine phoenixes chanting mysteriously, purple phoenixes circling, jade flutes stirring music, jade forest spirits wailing, golden brilliance scattering incense, jade consorts raising smoke, flying to the four assemblies of the heavens, the eight directions of cavern purity, the three lights halting their radiance, night lamps shining bright, flowing gold exhaling majesty, blazing fire bells, five dawns aligned with the sun, seven primal energies subdued, countless chariots and ten thousand mounts, flourishing purple courts. The Venerable Jade Emperor commanded the Upper Palace Jade Maidens Xu Farong, Xiao Yizhong, Tian Sifei, Li Yunmen, and others to play the cloud-hung zither, harmonizing voices in unison, singing the great cavern’s pure and profound chapter, the poem of the threefold paths’ bitter dew. The jade wisdom flute sounded clear, heavenly rhythms revealed subtlety, divine jade resonated with stirring echoes, golden tones soared into the void, dharma transformed countless beings, overseeing myriad affairs from the start. Their words read:

> The great cavern encompasses the three wheels,  
> Primordial transformation has no form.  
> Silent as rootless teaching,  
> Solemn as possessing potent spirit.  
> Alas, within the three paths,  
> Sorrow and suffering arise from this.  
> To the utmost study, diligently observe precepts,  
> Accumulate virtue to exhaust kalpa lifespans.  
> When kalpas end, transform and be born as heavenly bricks,  
> Body alongside sun and moon.  
> The ignorant follow worldly desires,  
> Floating learning seeks fame.  
> Proclaiming transformation without order,  
> Lightly leaking heavenly treasure scriptures.  
> Recklessly entering death’s gate,  
> The Four Extremes bind your name.  
> Souls tread the nine hardships,  
> Five sufferings long embrace you.  
> Eating fire, treading knife mountains,  
> Hardship without respite.  
> Lament this source of misfortune and blessing,  
> Clear amid the vastness.

The Most High left stern precepts,  
Misfortune and blessing cause human lament.  
The immortal path originates from fate,  
In darkness it is already determined.  
Without fate, it does not open,  
Once awakened, constant suffering is clear.  
If one can honor the profound code,  
Naturally transcending the skies.  
If one clings to greed and desire,  
Why boast arrogantly in play?  
Dwelling in sin, binding the four lights,  
Life and death tread the eight hardships.  
Dragging through the court of five sufferings,  
The three paths bind without release.  
Sinking spirits plunder the nine depths,  
Countless kalpas without dawn.  
Sorrowful is this primordial teaching,  
Can it not make men resentful?

Vast and lofty are the nine mysteries above,  
Dim and obscure the beginning of transformation.  
No form nor shadow,  
No depth nor measure.  
The two agencies open fate’s display,  
Binding qi to form dregs.  
Three dawns illuminate the mysterious chamber,  
Five and nine hold order and discipline.  
Misfortune and blessing come from human life,  
Good and evil, which prevails?  
If one can awaken to profound awareness,  
Transcending doubts and heights.  
If one wields the axe of fate,  
Accumulating offenses filling the heart’s folds.  
Sinking in sin, binding the four lights,  
Past punishments surely have end.  
Bearing life’s body on knife mountains,  
Five sufferings ultimately resolved.  
Seven mysteries fill the dark night,  
Countless kalpas mark one cycle.  
Lingering in the three paths,  
Unawakened to life and death.

Then the Venerable Supreme True Jade Emperor, the Great Master Gaochen leading the Immortal Jade Attendants, holding the Ascending Immortal Feather Banner and the Jade Script Imperial Seal, proclaimed to the Five Spirits, the Jade Officials assuming their positions, ten thousand emperors arriving at the throne, the Bright Sovereign opening the oath, bestowing the Illumination Code upon the Most High Great Dao Lord. The Dao Lord received the profound precepts, at that time entrusting the Later Sage Nine-Mystery Golden Palace Emperor Lord to govern the upper Shangqing, the middle Ten Heavens, and the lower myriad beings, overseeing all immortals, universally proclaiming to all perfected ones, verifying the Azure Palace’s mysterious charts and purple slips, named under the Jade Emperor, granted to later disciples, so all may know precepts and cultivate according to the code. The Later Sage Emperor Lord received the *Illumination of the Four Extremes* from the Most High Great Dao Lord, sealed within the Golden Palace Purple Terrace Jade Reflection Seven Treasures Palace. After one thousand seven hundred years, it was transmitted to the Upper Minister Azure Youth Lord, who passed it to the Supreme Ultimate Realized One, Southern Mountain Red Lord, Western City King Lord, Mysterious Continent Immortal Elder, Nine-Spirit Princes, and twenty-four perfected ones. The King Lord sealed one copy within the Jade Chamber northwest of Wangwu Mountain, to be transmitted through countless kalpas to future worthy cultivators. Whoever possesses the mysterious chart and jade name, golden bones and purple repository, shall obtain this text, and the bearer shall become a divine immortal, ascending to Heaven in broad daylight. Thirty-six Jade Boys and thirty-six Jade Girls attend, guarding those who have the code, recording merits and manifest goodness. Carefully observe and faithfully practice, abiding by the solemn oath and secret treasures, never lightly transmitting. Should the spiritual text be leaked, the Nine Ancestors and Forebears shall be consigned to endless toil, bearing mountains and stones, filling the river of night, devouring fire and charcoal, suffering countless kalpas without reprieve, dying in the shadowy springs, repenting before the Three Officials.

The Most High Pure Subtle Heaven’s Mysterious Three Officials, the Jade Emperor supervising the Immortal Lords, command the Five Emperors’ divine troops of fifty thousand. The first Left Official governs offenses of neglect against the Supreme True Jade Emperor; the second Right Official corrects leaks of heavenly treasure offenses; the third Yin Official governs offenses of the Primordial Lord violating precepts and prohibitions. The Three Officials of Yu Yu Tian govern the upper truth, overseeing offenses of the Jade Attendants, commanding five hundred thousand divine troops. The first Left Official governs yang offenses: punishments, killings, rebellions, theft of heavenly treasures, revealing spiritual texts, speech curses and oaths; the second Right Official governs yin offenses: harboring plots and unrighteous schemes, harming the worthy, unorthodox thoughts; the third Chief Official governs doubts and disbelief in Heavenly Truth, disrespect and slander of heavenly treasures, vacillating thoughts, lightly treating Dao scriptures, defiling sacred texts. The Three Officials of the Great Red Heaven oversee spiritual envoys and messengers, commanding five hundred thousand divine troops. The first Left Official governs offenses of the living; the second Right Official governs offenses of the dead; the third Yin Official governs offenses of women. Additionally, there are Water and Fire Officials on left and right. The Left Water Official governs false speech, slander, quarrelsome tongues, jealousy and harm to the worthy, disbelief in Heavenly Truth, doubting talismans, disparaging treasured texts, falsely speaking of Heaven and Earth, revealing secret chapters, defaming the two images, offending the Three Stars; the Right Fire Official governs great rebellion, killing life, harming masters and lords, plotting against parents, malicious hands and hearts, unorthodox wishes. The Great Hill Mountain has Wind and Knife Officials on left and right. The Left Wind Examiner governs offenses of receiving scriptures, talismans, and secret formulas without oath and cultivation, loving wealth and despising Dao, damaging heavenly precepts; the Right Knife Examiner governs offenses of violating oaths and alliances, betraying masters and friends, shifting allegiance, judging good and evil, attacking fundamental roots, irreconcilable offenses. Within the Mysterious Center are Three Great Voids, governed by the Three Officials. The Upper Three Officials govern the Supreme Mysterious Upper Jade Void; the Middle Three Officials govern the Shangqing Void; the Lower Three Officials govern the Supreme Ultimate Void. All dwell within the mysterious emptiness, above the void, separately housed in nine palaces within the Five Sacred Mountains’ mysterious cavern chambers. Good and evil, guilt and punishment, all fall under the jurisdiction of the Three Officials and Nine Palaces.

The Knife Mountain lies north of Mount Tai, above the Lesser Heaven Void, circling seven thousand li, housing one hundred and twenty bureaus, one thousand two hundred clerks, wielding fifty thousand divine soldiers enforcing punishments. Those guilty before the Three Officials have their dead souls sent to ascend the mountain for retribution; one kalpa is one sweep, the tormented souls suffer grievously, after three sweeps they reach the Land of Flowing Fire. The Land of Flowing Fire lies south of Mount Huo, within the Great Yang Dongting, circling five thousand li; guilty souls are consigned to the fire land, eating fire and charcoal, their souls withered and pained, one kalpa is one sweep, after three sweeps they fulfill the threefold path’s toil, bearing soil from Meng Mountain, filling the river of night; after three sweeps they may return to the path of non-human life. The threefold paths are all governed by the Supreme Mysterious Lady of the Azure Upper Palace Fengdu Mountain, in the northern Gui land. On the mountain are eight prisons: First, the Heavenly Prison; Second, the Balanced Heaven Prison; Third, the Void Prison; Fourth, the Natural Prison; Fifth, the Nine Balance Prison; Sixth, the Clear Edict Prison; Seventh, the Mysterious Heaven Prison; Eighth, the Primordial Correct Prison, all governed by the Upper Three Officials. In the mountain’s center are eight prisons: First, the Mysterious Sand Northern Prison; Second, the Imperial Heaven Prison; Third, the Forbidden Punishment Prison; Fourth, the Mysterious Subtle Prison; Fifth, the Punishment Correct Prison; Sixth, the Law and Order Prison; Seventh, the Nine Heavens Prison; Eighth, the Clear Bell Prison, governed by the Middle Three Officials. At the mountain’s base are eight prisons: First, the Boundless Prison; Second, the Supreme True Prison; Third, the Mysterious Capital Prison; Fourth, the Thirty-Six Heavens Great Prison; Fifth, the Heavenly One Northern Prison; Sixth, the River God Prison; Seventh, the Accumulated Kalpa Prison; Eighth, the Female Azure Prison, governed by the Lower Three Officials. Altogether twenty-four prisons stand north of Dengdu Mountain, staffed by twelve clerks, two thousand four hundred golden-headed iron-faced giant heavenly strongmen wielding golden hammers and iron staffs. All souls guilty of the mysterious code are assigned to their respective prisons, their bodies examined by the strongmen’s iron staffs; one kalpa is one sweep, three sweeps then allow return to fulfill the threefold path’s duties.

The Most High addressed the Golden Palace Emperor Lord: "All who live within Heaven and Earth, within the Six Directions, yet do not know life and death, fate and retribution’s root, how grievous indeed! Good and evil causes and conditions, none escapes retribution. In life, perform merit and spread virtue, save all beings; after death, transform and be born in the blessed halls, surpassing the eight hardships, receiving human celebration, Heaven’s reward naturally. In life, cherish learning, aspire to immortality, revere the profound code, honor spiritual texts, contemplate goodness and reform evil, establish conduct and enter truth; after death, transform and be born, receiving imperial reception, name inscribed on purple slips, ascending to the Jade Dawn. In life, delight in the Dao, unafraid of cold and hardship, follow the master’s tasks, labor foremost, endure hunger and thirst without complaint; after death, transform and be born, gaining the flying chariot, roaming the Five Sacred Mountains, riding the void and descending through smoke. In life, be upright and pure, neither lustful nor deceitful, neither greedy nor desirous, seeing beauty without joy, heart like dead ashes, firmly grasping the Dao source; after death, transform and be born, receiving spiritual people, transcending the three paths, avoiding the five sufferings. In life, perform good deeds, wishing Heaven’s universal blessings, all to ascend together, leaving behind the eight hardships; many bodies pass not, but self is uneasy; cut off one’s own garments to rescue the poor and cold, reduce provisions for crows, leave possessions in empty mountains; the four officials praise goodness, moving the Jade Emperor, inscribing names on purple slips, enrolling among the upper immortals. In life, be loyal and filial, respectfully serving elders, revering those superior, honoring ancestral rites and masters, harmonizing eyes and belly as one body, heart without arrogance, mouth without frivolity, inner and outer in accord, movement and stillness aligned with truth; after death, transform and be born, receiving spiritual people, not suffering the three paths, surpassing the eight hardships. Goodness begets goodness, blessing begets blessing; such is the reward, how could the Dao fail man? In life, be wicked and deceitful, attacking masters, destroying sacred texts, disrespecting spiritual chapters, doubting Heavenly Truth, outwardly fickle, falsely seeking glory, mouth saying one thing, heart another, acting against the Dao source, stealing scriptures, revealing secrets without oath, leaking mysteries, exiled as non-truth; violating codes and taboos, body entering the gate of sin, seven ancestors suffering calamity, punishment reaching the tormented soul, death bearing retribution, eating fire and treading mountains, three paths and five sufferings, countless kalpas without reprieve, tormented in dark nights, pain piercing the body. Such is the source of calamity and blessing; who can fully speak of it?"

Those with golden names in the imperial charts, jade characters on purple slips, receiving the *Illumination of the Four Extremes*’ one hundred and twenty statutes, are all destined to respond as immortals. Yet they must cultivate and serve according to the code, honor goodness and obey the law, hoping for spiritual efficacy and the mysterious Jade Emperor’s special favor. The Four Realms’ officials welcome and escort, near and far all bow in reverence, serving the destined body. The destined must sever yin-yang ties, not mingle with worldly people, avoiding the filth of life and death, offending true spirits, consuming the five smokes, qi filling stomach and bowels, damaging essence and losing spirit, exposing the three lights, slighting the Jade Dawn, thus bringing their own calamity, ruin of the destined body. Therefore, this is told in detail for faithful practice. Those who possess the code body must not rashly discuss scriptures with common learners, nor debate ancient mysteries, nor spread teachings improperly, nor reveal the Dao source, nor falsely show to the world, lest harm befall the seven ancestors’ dead souls, long supplementing the river source, their forms enslaved in the nine depths, suffering unspeakable pain.

Receiving the supreme dharma, revering cultivation of the illumination code, all should on the eight seasonal festivals and their birth day fast and burn incense, repent before the Emperor Lord, remove nine yin offenses, and dissolve the seven mysteries. Always on the Beginning of Spring and Spring Equinox, light nine lamps in the central courtyard; on Beginning of Summer and Summer Solstice, light three lamps; on Beginning of Autumn and Autumn Equinox, light seven lamps; on Beginning of Winter and Winter Solstice, light five lamps; on birth day, light twelve lamps. At midnight, expose lamps beneath, facing east on Beginning of Spring and Spring Equinox, south on Beginning of Summer and Summer Solstice, west on Beginning of Autumn and Autumn Equinox, north on Beginning of Winter and Winter Solstice, and on birth day face the Tai Sui above. Knock teeth twenty-four times, softly chanting:

> Most High Supreme True,  
> Ten Thousand Holy Emperor Sovereigns,  
> Five Emperors’ Jade Officials,  
> Chief Immortal Overseers,  
> Today’s auspicious day, the eight festivals,  
> Presenting yang offenses and yin examinations,  
> Severing nine yin,  
> Forever removing seven mysteries,  
> Escaping the fire land,  
> Forever leaving the knife mountain,  
> Three paths and five sufferings,  
> Not burdening my body,  
> Joining Heaven and Earth,  
> Long preserving the imperial dawn,  
> Five wishes and eight assemblies,  
> Nothing unmet.

Then remove the cloth, bow one hundred and twenty times, forehead touching the earth, but do not cause pain. Afterward, replace the cloth, gaze upward, heart mindful: "Today my body receives Heaven’s grace, bestowed form and frame, born to fly as immortal." Then swallow the twenty-four breaths. Thus for three years, past offenses are removed, body and truth united, not treading the five sufferings, escaping the fire land, able to attain the Realized One’s banquet chamber—truly a wondrous secret, never lightly transmitted.

The Four Extremes are governed by the Four Directions’ Five Emperor Jade Officials, universally overseeing the Four Extremes, neither high nor low, neither deep nor shallow, circling through endless kalpas, all inspecting good and evil, misfortune and blessing tied to the Jade Officials. The Four Directions and Eight Regions have countless officials, all called Jade Officials and Touring Officials.
