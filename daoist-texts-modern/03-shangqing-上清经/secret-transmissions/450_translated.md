## The Supreme Record of the Cavern of True Reality, Primordial Warehouse

The Record of the Primordial Warehouse, also called the Inner Text of Supreme Clarity, also known as the Jade Mirror Precious Chapter, also the Golden Chart and Jade Characters, also the Breaking-Drowning Cavern Talisman, also the Mysterious Inspection Precious Record, also the Scripture of Renwu Mountain, also the Golden Birth Strategy Text, also the Mighty Taiyi Mandate Supporter. It was cultivated by Lord Jade Dawn, the Secret and Pure Spirit of the Upper Palace. Having attained it and faithfully practiced it, one can soar and sink, conceal and reveal, holding the rank of a True Person.

The primordial qi flows and transforms, condensing above into Heaven, spreading hues of emerald and azure—thus called the Primordial Warehouse. Its luminous clarity governs fate, abhorring killing and cherishing life, warning of calamity and blessing; the learner uses it as a mirror. By divining good and evil, one knows to seek auspiciousness and avoid misfortune; in coming and going, one finds the right place; in movement and stillness, one preserves wholeness; through transformation and guidance,功功立 (merit and dao are established); accumulating virtue, the dao is fulfilled. Without knowing this secret, one labors in vain, chasing after trivial gains yet cannot escape great disasters. Even ascending beyond the Twenty-Eight Heavens, one still cannot avoid falling among the lowly grass and insects. Therefore, this supreme treasure secret is especially profound; when the child’s fate meets it, close your mouth and cultivate it. All qi is contained within, born from the Primordial Warehouse; unaware and unawakened, one only increases good karma by chance. Indulging the nature recklessly, losing the primordial qi, the death of all beings arises from wanton evil destroying the body. Fleeting joy is short-lived; the infant suffers long nights beyond measure. The time will come when the Supreme Sage takes pity, unfolds the wondrous qi of bewilderment, inscribes the natural numinous script, and engraves the essential laws of cultivating goodness. Wearing it, reciting it, preserving it, and practicing it according to the prescribed methods, without ceasing for nine years, one will surely ascend to the Three Purities.

Vast and boundless, impossible to fully describe, it is collectively called Nature, and expressed by the name Primordial Qi. Primordial Qi responds well, transforming into form; forms and images have names—roughly called Heaven and Earth. Heaven and Earth cover and support, containing and nurturing the warehouse of life. Life-energy is abundant, myriad colors come first. Looking up at the shape of Heaven, carefully distinguishing its hues, preserving its spirit, one then obtains its qi. Qi descends throughout the body, penetrating inside and out, granting long life and immortality, transformations without end. As for humans, some are sharp, dull, or average; Heaven has large, medium, and small; small within large. The heavens are arrayed in ranks, primordial numbers piled one upon another; the earths likewise are countless without measure. Each heaven has three lights and seven numinous ones without limit; each earth has five sacred mountains, eight assemblies, Kunlun, and Sumeru—sizes differing. Depending on one’s response and reception, existence or nonexistence, each according to their dwelling’s benefit or harm, receiving karmic fruits accordingly. Some dwell in impurity yet are clear; some in clarity yet are turbid; some are wise yet lowly in rank; some foolish yet noble in title; some realms vast yet desolate; some domains small yet abundant; some live in honor yet sorrowful; some in lowliness yet joyful and healthy; some male yet weak; some female yet strong; some outwardly bright yet inwardly dark; some inwardly illuminated yet outwardly obscured. Some first low then high; some first empty then full; some head upright then tail crooked; some front crooked then end upright; some solitary; some in groups; some alike; some different; myriad forms uneven, countless beyond measure. Countless heavens share these traits, only the Great Luo Three Heavens are pure and singular, one qi complete, nothing lacking. When sensing, they respond; their traces number in the millions and thousands, some coarse, some subtle, some shallow, some deep. Though differing in weight, all are pure and clear, differentiated in form yet from one source. According to their cause and condition, they manifest traces. There are those who see qi and signs and awaken—these are the first kind of person; those who see light and sound and awaken—the second; those who see talismans and charts and awaken—the third; those who see writing and awaken—the fourth; those who see forms and awaken—the fifth; those who hear words and awaken—the sixth; those who see shadows and images and awaken—the seventh; those who see splendor and awaken—the eighth; those who see plainness and awaken—the ninth; those who see openness and communication and awaken—the tenth; those who see concealment and blockage and awaken—the eleventh; those who see the middle and awaken—the twelfth. The great twelve categories divide into three ranks: upper, middle, and lower, each with four. Practices differ; causes and effects vary. On earth there are twelve; ascending to the boundless Three Purities’ Heaven, above all heavens. The superior study roams among the twelve, refining and feasting within the Three Purities; feasting within the Three Purities, no longer acting. Acting is for things, not what I require. Before ascending the Three Purities, one can act for things; acting for things as self, mixing conduct. Sometimes acting for self less, for things more; sometimes for things shallow, for self deep. Exploring the shallow with differences, thus forming twelve, neither shallow nor deep, then ascending the three above. The upper three are originally one, responding and connecting to the three ranks; initially coming but not yet arrived, three names not yet united; later united, no longer three names. The lower knows existence, forcibly calling it one; one is not a name, but the lord of myriad names. The lord cannot be without a name, so it is marked as one. One unifies countless splendid names, arranging birth, mysterious origin, and beginnings. The Most High Revered Spirits are all what the learner must preserve and call lord, not true names, names do not depart.

The companions of superior study thoroughly understand cause and condition, embodying it without doubt. Cultivating it must be focused; focusing must be effective; the will must be fulfilled; fulfillment comes from following the fa. The fa has three vehicles, riding twelve matters; matters are in the scripture, upper, middle, and lower grades, the Three Caverns responding and operating, issuing one after another. Sometimes appearing simultaneously, encompassing all texts; all texts and charts belong to the Three Caverns. The Three Caverns and Three Purities are the three vehicles; the three vehicles’ scriptures and precepts each have twelve, combined into thirty-six divisions, to save limitless heavens and humans. Human conditions vary in thickness; acquisition differs, sometimes more or less, shallow or deep. Without utmost virtue, names appear in the Jade Chart, Blue Record, and White Slip, not fully heard, seen, understood, or practiced. Each follows what is obtained, gradually ascending ranks; only the fully complete ascend the Three Purities. The Three Purities are Jade Clarity, Supreme Clarity, and Great Clarity. The Three Caverns are Cavern of True Reality, Cavern of Profound Mystery, and Cavern of Spirit. The Three Scriptures are Cavern of True Reality Supreme Clarity, Cavern of Profound Mystery Numinous Treasure, and Cavern of Spirit Three Sovereigns. The twelve matters explain all dharma, heart and trace without action, being not acting for things; things rely on it, originally not for self; self also completes itself by it. Like the gate of heart and trace, heart and trace are not here; not seeing begging and giving; not seeing giving and granting; not seeing yet seeing; seeing the wondrous always present, inconceivable. Turning evil to make right, responding accordingly, yet not my desire; desire gone, what trouble remains? No-trouble traces, the Dao’s response and form, revered and practiced by sages, true spirits, and immortals. Practicing it in accord with the dao is the first matter. Heart not acting, trace acting, forgetting self to act for things, for things’ virtue is high—the second matter. Heart acting, trace not acting, idle dwelling with little affairs, simplifying complexity, reaching serenity, guarding stillness and non-action, yet heart thinking and imagining; thought is guarding against wrong, seeking good and avoiding evil—the third matter. Leaving home to dwell among humans, abandoning attachments to kin, mingling with the world, cultivating virtue and establishing功功, less selfish and desires—the fourth matter. Bringing family to dwell in mountains and marshes, deeply hiding to avoid desires, supervising rank and file, dispelling noise for quiet, wearing tattered clothes and coarse food, probing existence and nonexistence, resting head on stone, rinsing mouth with stream, eating clouds and nourishing qi, hearing without arising thought—the fifth matter. Leaving the world, severed from others, no longer caring for ruler or kin, all severed, solitary and lonely, cultivating the master’s instructions—the sixth matter. In the world, blending light with dust, marriage and office undistinguished, qi fluctuating between dark and bright, alone seeing splendor and plainness, not biased, self-studying, teaching others to communicate and block, adapting and moving, firm will unchanging—the seventh matter. Severing desire clearly, cutting off wife and grain, desire stirs then reproaches self, poor dwelling with constant rites, repentance, and wishes to sever—the eighth matter. Not severing but self-severing, essence preserved without stagnation, wives and concubines arrayed, singing courtesans arranged, rank and joy harmonious, balanced without indulgence, only following fa; rites of noble and low not transgressed; celebrations gathered in pure breeze, no stagnation returning to mysterious qi, careful to end as to begin—the ninth matter. Roaming in the void, the middle is the will, not attached below, not meddling above, delighting nature and nourishing spirit, harming no beings, in leisure aiding the masses, not harming self, accumulating gradually to ascend—the tenth matter. Dwelling underground, residing in caverns, guarding stillness earnestly, thinking of divine powers, hidden and immersed without vexation—the eleventh matter. Residing in the heavens, dwelling in manifest splendor, flowing grace and favor, aiding warehouse life, drawing primordial qi, preserving longevity, dignity not diminished—the twelfth matter. These twelve matters are complete in the three vehicles; each vehicle has its people, many ranks and names, vehicles become titles. Upper cavern is great vehicle, middle cavern middle vehicle, lower cavern small vehicle. Roughly enumerated, named by the most numerous matters. Like a brocade, named by the most colorful. Each of these twelve matters also has twelve matters: one, natural writing; two, named talisman and strategy; three, called annotation and secret; four, called charts and images; five, called registers and records; six, called precepts and rules; seven, called dignity and conduct; eight, called methods; nine, called protective numbers; ten, called records and transmissions; eleven, called praises; twelve, called memorials and reports. Practicing the twelve matters, each has these twelve; ranks in the three caverns, caverns interpenetrate, mysteries vary slightly, arranged according to cause and guidance. Thoroughly understanding and cultivating, response and verification are swift; not understanding, seeking aimlessly, effect is slow to respond; confused and imprecise, practice has no sign; deviating in expectation of result, leading to examination and arrival. Superior study’s aspirants must be strict, detailed, and cautious.

## The Breaking-Drowning Talisman as follows:

All living beings have realms; little clarity, much turbidity; filth and obstruction entangle; doing good does not establish; evil qi invades; fierce demons and mysterious trials. Those who study above, turbidity moves slowly to clarity; pure fasting preserves thought; forbidding and isolating from noisy dust. Those not of this kind, intruding and departing, family members in other rooms may have milk; relatives inside and outside may have mourning and misfortune; prisons and lawsuits; six domestic animals frightened and fleeing; black sinking and joining; sorrow, weeping, blood and injury; and such are inauspicious signs. All are filth and turbidity born of drowning and gloom, obstruction knotting without release, dark confusion disturbing the spirit. One must urgently bathe and preserve thought to dissipate it. But pure thought is hard to refine; pure guarding has methods; one must also choose the day and hour of the king and minister, pure fasting and opening announcement, receiving and wearing the Breaking-Drowning Talisman. The qi of the Nine Heavens transforms into nine phoenixes, each head with one body flying through the Three Realms, guiding the wondrous qi of the Three Purities, sweeping away the noisy dust of the Nine Earths. Wearing it on the body, entering and exiting, movement and stillness always clear, all turbidity cannot boast, all dust dares not interfere, all calamities are crossed over, extending life without decline, soul and spirit both pacified, together ascending Jade Clarity.
