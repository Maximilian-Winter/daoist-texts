## The Cavern of Truth: The Most High Supreme Sovereign’s Register of the People and the Definitive Jade Talisman of Authenticity

The Azure Youth Lord inquired of the Most High Dao Lord, saying:  
“To govern the heart and enter the dao, with myriad arts and methods interwoven, each claiming subtle secrets—yet all arise from conditions. I have not yet discerned which command is the utmost, which path is supreme?”

The Most High replied:  
“Though many principles are victorious, there is one supreme among them. The essential in governing the heart lies in *shame and remorse*. When the heart stirs, when the eyes lift, when the body turns and settles, one must constantly harbor shame and remorse, never forgetting even a moment. Only then do heart and spirit become settled; when settled, one enters the dao. This is the utmost command.”

The Azure Youth said:  
“Of what should one feel shame and remorse, so as to enter the dao?”

The Most High said:  
“The heart holds the numinous consciousness; consciousness can recognize the dao and thus reverence it. Reverence arises from non-action, yet I act; in action lies burden. The aspiration is non-action, free from burden, but this is not easily attained. Striving with effort is slow and painful; burdens accumulate—thus one feels shame and remorse, never leaving the heart.  

“Moreover, one should reflect: I was born through life, life through father and mother; father and mother nurtured me with hardship and toil. Yet my learning is shallow, my methods lack marvel and wonder; I cannot prolong their lives, cannot grant them immortality, nor can we together attain the divine immortals. This aspiration remains unfulfilled; my offerings are lacking; public and private faults abound; parents worry deeply; thoughts are scattered; merit and practice decline. For this, I feel shame and remorse, never leaving the heart.  

“Again, parents love and cherish me, urging me to be outstanding; I follow teachers to learn, wisdom opening to the divine; I seek immortals and sages, becoming a seed person of the dao. Teachers and friends exhort me, providing means to restrain and uplift, gentle guidance and good reception. Yet after refining and tempering, I let desires run wild, violating the teacher’s instructions; sometimes I am about to succeed but then stop; I rebel against the correct and enter error; I attack and slander teachers and friends; I break the dao and tear the scriptures; my crimes extend to the honored above; calamity will destroy my body; disaster approaches, yet I do not know to reform.  

“Or I fail to awaken myself, mistaking falsehood for truth, suffering bitterly and repenting, but regrets cannot be pursued. For this, I feel shame and remorse, never leaving the heart.  

“Again, the sovereign rewards virtue, seeking the worthy and beautiful, elevating their clans and selecting the elite; titles and emoluments shine bright; banquets and gatherings are splendid. Yet I cannot exhaust all means to be loyal, to praise and proclaim the sacred transformation; I crave honor and admire power; I flatter with my face and follow; I advance with deceit and sycophancy; I suppress the lofty and bright; I envy and harm those superior; I form factions and alliances of enmity; disaster, misfortune, and harm spread, poison reaching without my knowledge. Knowing this, I cannot escape; harm reaches kin and friends. For this, I feel shame and remorse, never leaving the heart.  

“Again, I revere the dao without forgetting, serve parents with filial piety, serve sovereigns with loyalty, not betraying hidden or manifest. Yet past lives’ karmic obstacles, illness and misfortune entwine; public and private slanders arise; lawsuits and imprisonments occur; unintended calamities befall; or I hold to diligence and caution, upright and distinct from the crowd, hated by sovereigns, resented by evil ones; or I serve teachers and respect friends, yet come and go with body and spirit, encountering misfortune and ugliness; evil ghosts and evil men join forces to seize and plunder; fear and harm threaten; or good deeds turn to evil; giving wealth causes resentment; utmost propriety becomes flattery; utmost sincerity becomes treachery; or I build halls and lodges, copy scriptures and diagrams; though halls stand, peace is not constant; though volumes are many, they cannot be read; public and private obstacles arise; wind and fire take them away; misery, disease, hunger, and cold afflict me; I do not follow my original aspiration; days pass empty; pure wishes remain unfulfilled; once lost, the path to the dao is dark and obscure; suffering and vexation are deep; the return time is unknown. Now I wish to save myself but have not obtained the essential secret. For this, I feel shame and remorse, never leaving the heart.  

“The heart holds the numinous; if one does not know shame and remorse, then it races and rushes, never gaining stillness. Stillness arises from shame and remorse; once shame and remorse are established, they always dwell in the heart. The heart with shame and remorse bows and raises, thinking of the dao; thinking of the dao without forgetting even a moment; then the spirit and brightness settle within. When the inner settles, sins depart; when sins depart, blessings come; when blessings come, truth is achieved; when truth is achieved, one enters the dao. Entry into the dao arises from shame and remorse; shame and remorse thus enter the numinous.”

The Azure Youth said:  
“Shame and remorse dwell in the heart; I carefully receive this command. May I ask, if shame and remorse are near, can their form be described?”

The Most High said:  
“Well said, well said! This is a question of utmost importance. Where there is form, there is heart; where there is heart, there are affairs; where there are affairs, there are traces; where there are traces, there is form; where there is form, there is speech; where there is speech, there is method; where there is method, there is dao; the dao’s method can be expounded. The scholar who governs the heart has shame and remorse within; the traces of shame and remorse appear without. They are like one cautiously crossing a river in winter, or like one fearful of the neighbors all around. This is their form.  

“Guard speech carefully, fearing incitement; moderate food and drink, considering greed and gluttony; wear coarse but clean clothes, embodying simplicity and purity; dwell in humble seclusion, guarding quietude and steadfastness; show reverence to all, avoiding insult and disgrace; dare not take precedence, avoiding envy and slander; begin and end with integrity and faith, subtly transforming and guiding; advance and retreat with harmony and light, secretly carrying out teachings; blunt sharpness and resolve disputes, knowing the dao’s timing; come and go with change, revealing the numinous and responding to conditions. Each has its method, yet all are forms of shame and remorse.”

The Azure Youth said:  
“Their form is thus; I carefully receive this command. May I ask about the method of regulation?”

The Most High said:  
“The methods are many, each with its own scripture and proclamation. I will speak briefly, that hearing one may know ten.  

“Anyone who wishes to settle the heart must follow and honor the Three Venerables. The Dao Venerable and the Scripture Venerable are fully contained in my teacher. The teacher’s methods reveal the manifest and hidden; one must bow and follow without defiance. Defiance leads to loss of stillness. Guarding stillness without loss means serving the teacher and venerable, watching and listening to voice and color, humbly and diligently without rest, fearing no toil, refusing no hardship, focusing single-mindedly without opposition, setting death as the term. Those who can do this have born stillness in their heart.  

“But if one turns away from the teacher and acts on one’s own, violating the dao and surpassing the scriptures, harboring resentment, suspicion, deceiving manifest and hidden, this heart is not settled; it fears death and loses life. Once gone, it is hard to retrieve—truly worthy of lament.  

“Anyone who wishes to settle the heart, depending on conditions, selects a teacher, guards the dao, holds the scriptures, and preserves the teacher without replacement. The heart harbors shame and remorse; one must not follow a teacher who has ascended to Heaven, for I cannot serve them; or who wanders and transforms in other realms, whom I cannot follow; or who entrusts their end to fate, which I cannot fathom; or who drifts in hardship and disgrace, hunger and cold in remote lands; or who suffers public and private calamities, imprisonment and confinement; or who lies ill amidst mountains and waters, cut off from human relations; or who falls under the five calamities, dying and perishing; or who is harmed by poisonous insects and fierce beasts, or injured by forests and trees; or who suffers from robbers and traitors, trapped among conspirators and weeds, unable to save themselves—all these circumstances call for shame and remorse.  

“Shame and remorse dwell in the heart, sorrow and torment are near; one dares not indulge in pleasure, nor rest in peace, nor sing or laugh, nor seek glory and splendor. One must purify and solemnize the hall and chamber, forbid the intrusion of common folk, burn incense and light lamps, perform morning and evening rites, recite and chant the teacher’s scriptures, contemplate and practice the teacher’s methods, with solemn awe and trembling fear, careful and vigilant. One nourishes food and breath, wears worn cloth garments, moves and acts with head lowered, repents sins and preserves the numinous, practices good deeds and requests blessings, establishes virtue and accomplishes merit, opens the path for all, teaches and transforms the ignorant, diligently without weariness, cautiously without rest.  

“One does not speak words not from the teacher; one does not wear garments not from the teacher; one does not hold intentions not from the teacher; one does not dwell in places not from the teacher. Those who can do this attain the method of shame and remorse.  

“Anyone who wishes to settle the heart must receive the *Supreme Sovereign’s Register of the People and the Definitive Jade Talisman of Authenticity*. This talisman is of utmost importance, the beginning of learning. Only by first settling the heart can the immortal name be fixed. The immortal name is fixed by this talisman. It is worn by the Three Heavens’ Zhengyi Masters to fix and obtain the immortal name, transmitted to the Jade Emperor, the Thirty-Nine Truths, the Queen Mother of the West, the Lady of the Upper Origin, the Pure and Numinous Perfected, and the Five Sacred Mountain Immortals—each receiving one copy. Each copy is passed down for one thousand years, allowed to be transmitted to three persons. If one has a golden name and jade character petition to the Azure Palace, three transmissions may be obtained within one hundred years. The covenant uses one golden person and one jade dragon, each one piece, and thirty-two feet of blue cloth, to swear to the Northern Emperor. The master and disciples each fast for nine days, facing north to declare the covenant and transmit the talisman.  

“If one does not receive this talisman, the immortal name is not fixed; even if one studies all scriptures, merit and virtue do not accrue; one is tested by demons and cannot attain immortality. Those who attain immortality all first receive this talisman. It is carried in a blue-patterned pouch worn beneath the elbow—men on the left, women on the right—always on the body, only removed for bathing; otherwise, never taken off. When worn out, it is repaired and replaced, with notification and approval. Loss or damage incurs penalty; fasting and repentance for three years and thirty months, until the day’s limit is fulfilled, then one may notify and wear it. If lost three times previously, one may not receive it again, increasing shame and remorse, hoping future generations will have the affinity.  

“The *Definitive Jade Talisman of Authenticity* is the writing of nature, arising from the boundless beginning and ending in the boundless end. The great kalpa changes once; those who attain the dao’s truth, accumulating merit and virtue, must wear this writing. The name enters within it; the body receives its qi—this is true truth, indestructible. The great kalpa is not yet complete; within it are lesser kalpas. Those whose merit and virtue are lax will lose both body and name, surely losing this writing and not worth immortality. Those whose merit advances and virtue refines will obtain the writing without loss, preserved as seed people, neither retreating nor diminishing. If merit, virtue, and wisdom differ in weight, outside the two hundred forty thousand, there are another one hundred twenty thousand, totaling three hundred sixty thousand—this is what a kalpa accomplishes. Those with slight merit and virtue do not enter the three hundred sixty thousand, awaiting the next kalpa. Those of this kalpa, diligent and courageous, may enter this limit of three hundred sixty thousand. It is also called the *White Slip and Azure Register of the Imperial People*, white gold as slip, azure jade as characters.”
