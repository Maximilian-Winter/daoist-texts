### Yellow Emperor’s Inquiry on the Southern Lord’s Secret, Chapter One

The Yellow Emperor Xuanyuan, long planted in the immortal ford, responded to the divine essence, born with a spirit both rare and exquisite. His rank succeeded the Heavenly Emperor; again he sought the dao of truth, purified his fast, and ascended the mysterious palace. Crossing Mount Yuntai, he worshipped and consulted Lord Yu, then asked of the Three Caverns:

“I inherit the vast lineage, though I govern myriad affairs, whenever I request the true essentials, I receive the profound decree. Yet my heart is restless, my form agitated; the sacred dao is subtle and deep, the hidden principle empty and condensed—I have not yet truly fathomed it. The Cavernous Mystery and Numinous Treasure, the five treatises of universal generation; the Cavernous Divine Immortal Scripture, widely spreading color and form; the Great Cavernous Sacred Teachings, meaning threading through emptiness and nothingness, entrusting substance to connect with void. The Three Treasures are all received, yet mundane feelings bewilder and obstruct; the supreme dao is hard to clarify. Are the Three Caverns’ universal generations one and the same?”

Lord Ning answered: “The mysterious primordial breath is the root of the Three Caverns; the Three Pure Ones and Three Realms universally extend their responses and forms. The immortal, true, and sacred ranks number nine grades on the mysterious ladder. The Three Caverns interpenetrate and mix; their responses and transformations differ. Through kalpas they manifest and transform; the Three Treasures arrive together; the highest sages descend; the lower saints receive. The Most High transmits the dao, speaking beyond words; the Middle True transmits virtue, entrusting words to universal principle; the Lower Realm transmits scripture, using words to cultivate practice. The three orders thus differ.”

The Yellow Emperor bowed twice, kneeling to ask: “May I dare inquire: how do the three grades differ? Please reveal their essentials, so there is no doubt.”

Lord Ning said: “The three realms and three worlds differ in obstruction and perception; the highest saints descend, awakening with varying depths. The caverns interpenetrate without hindrance, thus called the Three Caverns. The Three Caverns’ universal generation varies in response and reward.

“Regarding the Most High’s transmission of the dao: at the Dragon Han kalpa, the supreme jade emperor appeared as the Great Cavernous Heavenly Lord, born in the Twelve Holy Heavens of Jade Clarity, transmitting the sacred dao. Alongside him were the Yudan Heavenly Emperor, the Nine Heavens Elder; the Chan Shan Heavenly Emperor, the Nine Heavens True Sovereign; and the Xu Yan Heavenly Emperor, the Primordial Heavenly King—each teaching the Three Heavens’ nine grades of sacred dao.

“At the Chi Ming kalpa, the Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure True Lord appeared, next born in the Twelve True Heavens of Supreme Clarity, transmitting the true dao. Alongside him were the Ji Ran Heavenly Emperor, the Primordial Elder; the Bu Jiao Le Heavenly Emperor, the High Supreme Sovereign; and the Ying Sheng Heavenly Emperor, the Void Sovereign Jade Emperor—each teaching the Three Heavens’ nine grades of true dao.

“At the Shang Huang kalpa, the Divine Treasure Cavernous Divine Immortal Lord appeared, next born in the Twelve Immortal Heavens of Supreme Purity, transmitting the immortal dao. Alongside him were the Fan Fu Heavenly Emperor, the Ten Thousand Beginnings Elder; the Qing Ming Heavenly Emperor, the Purple Void Sovereign; and the Wu Ai Heavenly Emperor, the Supreme Five Sovereigns—each teaching the Three Heavens’ nine grades of immortal dao.

“This is the Most High transmitting the dao.

“Regarding the Middle True’s transmission of virtue: during the Great Ultimate era, it was bestowed by the Great Emperor Lord; at the Great Beginning, by the Heavenly Emperor Lord Lingyangzi; at the Great Origin, by the Great Micro Emperor Lord; at the Great Pole, by the Great Micro Heavenly Emperor Lord; at the Great Simplicity, by the Golden Gate Later Sage Lord Li Zhenjun, the Prime Minister Su Tongjun, the Prime Minister Qing Tongjun, and the Nine Mysterious Emperor Lord. This is the Middle True transmitting virtue.

“Regarding the Lower Realm’s transmission of scripture: it should transform the twelve matters of the dharma gate: one, this text, proclaimed by the Three Caverns; two, divine talismans, for proclamation and trust; three, jade formulas, revealing no doubts or difficulties; four, numinous diagrams, depicting features and likenesses; five, genealogies, recording generations of transmission; six, precepts, forbidding wrong and evil; seven, dignified conduct, rules of schools and order; eight, methods, for cultivation and discipline; nine, arts and numbers, concealing forms and revealing noble shapes; ten, records and transmissions, instructing learners; eleven, praises and hymns, chanting sacred virtue; twelve, petitions and memorials, formal requests and reports.

“The Three Caverns’ universal reach and response correspond to the Three Vehicles. Accumulating merit and attaining fruition differ. Depending on merit’s height, one ascends various heavens; the heavens’ rewards correspond to the vehicles and scriptures. Thirty-six divisions attest to birth in heaven; thirty-six heavens follow scripture and cultivation grades; scripture attests to heavenly grades; cultivation attests to fruition. Because of arising cultivation, liberation has causes; natural true nature is so.”

The Yellow Emperor bowed twice again, reopening his inquiry: “The thirty-six divisions, the three grades’ responses and causes, the thirty-six heavens, following scripture and cultivation grades, scripture attesting heavenly grades, cultivation producing heaven—do the attestations and grades correspond?”

Lord Yu said: “The Three Caverns’ scriptures and dharma, the celestial lords’ appearances and gates, respond and generate universally, all established from appearances. The body’s light shines through, illuminating the vast space; the realms of heaven and humans all receive their planting. The Three Treasures’ responses and images, the nine emperors’ winged forms, the subtle being’s universal nourishment—all begin the divine consciousness. The spirit is clear and bright; the will reflects wisdom; the breath is turbid and the spirit dim—darkness arises thus. The body pervades the great dao; the realm penetrates mystery; quiet contemplation of body and spirit, the Three Pure Ones’ caverns unite. The eight scenes protect and recommend, setting the cloud chariot; the nine heavens’ winged forms ascend to the pure realm. The thirty-six divisions illuminate the body; the thirty-six heavens, thought follows the heart’s mastery. Listen carefully to my words; I now explain to you.”

Lord Ning said to the Yellow Emperor: “The supreme dao has no image, no form, no name; from the root it descends in traces, gradually revealing three bodies. From the arising of three bodies, the Three Caverns unfold; three realms and three worlds, mundane and sacred differ in appearance; nine heavens and nine persons, their images interpenetrate. The Three Treasures gradually unfold; the Three Vehicles connect births; all arise as dharma bodies, with body light and good appearance. The three bodies’ good appearances, the realm’s shapes descend; responses from heaven and humans mutually nourish and form images; all arise from good appearance, planting their spirits; above they receive mysterious essence, beginning wondrous function.

“The first dharma body is profound and subtle, true unity and wondrous wisdom, pure and unobstructed. Above it reveals the dharma body’s thirty-six gates, manifesting the Three Caverns’ thirty-six images, upper and lower combining in seventy-two images.

“The second responsive body shows form and image, three realms and three worlds, upper and lower perfectly clear. Descending breath births spirit and forms numinous consciousness, with boundless merit and virtue, blessings complete for humans and heavens. Responses depend on karmic conditions; following merit one attests to dwelling. Above it reveals the three realms’ thirty-six heavens; below corresponds to the three worlds’ thirty-six emperors; upper and lower mutually respond in seventy-two images.

“The third transformation body opens and transforms human and spirit, all containing the Three Caverns. The nine breaths generate and nurture, imitating heaven’s image and earth’s form, combining into conscious spirit. Within it reveals the transformation body’s thirty-six images; outside it shows birth in humans’ thirty-six images; inside and outside combine in seventy-two images. The thirty-six divisions are the source of no form, speaking from principle, allowing measurement of principle, responding to born realms, blessings complete in all directions. Returning to root and origin, establishing grades and ranks, attesting fruition and advancing position, transcending and ascending the Great Luo, embodying and understanding the great dao, entering true reality, perfectly clear and upright, benefiting the common people, skillfully opening expedient means, showing the conditioned dharma, universally generating wondrous function, and thus arising consciousness and spirit, myriad transformations and responses, one image empty and tranquil.”

Lord Ning said to the Yellow Emperor: “The profound and silent dharma body gives birth to the empty cavern; within the empty cavern is born the Great Source; the Great Source’s transformation births the three breaths. The upper breath is called Beginning; the middle breath is called Origin; the lower breath is called Mystery. The mysterious breath is born from the origin; the origin breath is born from the beginning. This breath’s root precedes the Symbol Emperor, thus called the Mysterious Primordial Breath. The Mysterious Primordial Breath is the root of the three realms, corresponding above to the three realms, establishing the three sovereigns; the middle gives birth to the three worlds; the Three Vehicles guide and connect, universally as three origins, giving birth to the three officials. Therefore these three breaths give birth in grades; the three births generate myriad existences, the root and origin of all beginnings.”

Lord Ning said to the Yellow Emperor: “Within the Three Pure Heavens, the Mysterious Primordial Breath, combined with three and five, transforms into the Eight Scene Spirits, each giving birth to the eight directions, becoming the Twenty-Four Emperors. Above are the Three Pure Ones’ Twenty-Four Palaces, the Purple Void Immortal Mansion; descending are the Four Brahmas, the Four Eight Transformations, each governing the Three Realms’ Twenty-Four Palaces, universally one heaven’s twenty-four breaths giving birth to the human body’s twenty-four organs. Therefore the Three Origins, Three Divisions, Eight Scenes, and Twenty-Four Emperors—each emperor has three origins, each origin five spirits—combine into Three Hundred and Sixty Spirits. Sixty-six clans combine breath to birth spirits; above are the Three Pure Ones’ Sixty-Four Brahma Breaths; two sixes combine into thirty-two; thirty-two years, the heavenly cycle. Thus are the thirty-two heavens of the three realms.

“The Three Pure Ones’ nine breaths, upper and lower, communicate with spirits, aligning with the Northern Dipper; the four seasons shine clearly. The Three Caverns’ calendar counts years as three origins, six positions of yang days, six fasting months. The Eight Scenes circulate, the Eight Festivals cultivate gates, the Ten Directs attend the honored, cultivating the Ten Virtues. Burning incense and making vows, merit responds among the heavens; lamps continue shining, rescuing the living and dead; incense, flowers, and precious canopies offer to the heavens. Reciting the honored scriptures enables wisdom and understanding; above, repentance for seven ancestral generations’ past calamities; below, containing spirits, jointly nourishing dharma’s grace. The Three Pure Ones’ assembly of saints looks down upon sincere elixirs; the three realms’ palaces and officials jointly supervise and illuminate. The Three Palaces are pure and clear, the Nine Doors perfectly bright; the Five Viscera dawn clearly; the Six Fu communicate wisdom. The Eighty-One Good Qualities shine forth the eighty-one gates’ mechanisms; the thirty-two images illuminate the three hundred and sixty bones; the thirty-two emperors manifest the mysterious void; the thirty-six heavens reveal the summit image. The Eight Scenes fully guard; the Nine Heavens’ winged forms ride the scenes and drive the dragon, ascending to Jade Clarity.”

Lord Ning said to the Yellow Emperor: “The great dao births and transforms; nothing is not permeated; all-encompassing with no outside; subtle and entering the gapless; nothing does not receive; primordial things not born; nothing not measured; nothing not completed. Opening the vast space, divided into ten grades, from the upper Great Luo down to the Three Pure Ones, forming seven divisions; above and beside all equipped with vast space as the dao’s realm. Thus on the Mountain of the Mysterious Capital Jade Capital, there are seven awakening breaths.

“Below Great Luo arise the Three Realms, combined into seven divisions; beside them vast space, communicating as sacred realms. Furthermore, the Three Pure Ones and eight directions each have a division beneath, giving birth to countless earthly realms—five hundred billion, fifty trillion, five trillion, five hundred billion, fifty billion, five hundred million, and so forth. The limitless Three Realms all receive the five breaths and five movements, thus communicating the fifty-five numbers of heaven and earth.

“The Three Origins, upper and lower, all combine the Three Caverns and Nine Emperors, Twelve Heavens, summing the Three Origins’ Thirty-Six Emperors. The central and eight directions universally receive the Three Pure Ones, only responding to the four seasons’ thirty-two heavens and three hundred and sixty degrees, forming the Twenty-Eight Constellations. The Five Movements generate and transform; though responding to the dao’s root, they divide and correspond to the mundane, from the upper eighth division. Furthermore, beneath the limitless Three Realms, another division arises as the Nine Fortresses’ Thirty-Six Earth Emperors. All receive the Three Realms, connecting to the Three Pure Ones; each year’s eight festivals and four seasons’ days record human good and evil, reporting upward to the Three Pure Ones. Good and evil, sin and blessing, are counted above and below; this corresponds to the upper ninth division.

“Beneath the Nine Fortresses are the Eight Gates and Nine Dark Hells; above is Yang’s trial, below Yin’s punishment; above and below each nine, also called the Eighteen Great Hells. Beneath these hells is the great wind marsh’s breath—like wind but not wind, like water but not water. Consciousness suffers, nature is dim, cannot distinguish. Holding the earth’s wheel, it does not topple; this is the upper tenth division.”

Lord Ning said to the Yellow Emperor: “The Three Caverns’ universal transformation, the nine breaths’ mixed birth, heaven has thirty-six lords, earth has thirty-six offices. The three realms descend; nine breaths universally generate; the Nine Fortresses rise; the Three Realms respond mutually. One heaven’s realm, two scenes combine clearly; three lights simultaneously arrive; four threads all complete; the celestial pivot mixed and combined, governing the myriad, widely covering living spirits, maturing response breath.

“The celestial cycle’s calendar and transport pass through mysterious gates; the Nine Fortresses’ earth gods each govern earthly realms. The Grand Duke, the Great Yin, and the Great General, the Yearly Virtue, establish and break gods. If practitioners cultivate the Three Caverns’ Three Pure Ones’ supreme scriptures, they should diligently respect the Nine Earthly Spirits below, not causing harm.

“Therefore the first earth is named Primordial Virtue; its breath is upper blue and middle yellow, governed by the Primordial Earth Minister, with all earthly officials governing within. The second earth is Imperial Virtue; its breath is connected black, governed by the Primordial Court Earth Deputy, with all earthly officials governing within. The third earth is Emperor Virtue; its breath is connected azure, governed by the Tiger Mouth Earth Dragon, with all earthly officials governing within. The fourth earth is King Virtue; its breath is connected yellow, governed by the Primordial Heart Earth Great General. The fifth earth is Human Virtue; its breath is connected red, governed by the Primordial Blessing Earth Magistrate. The sixth earth is Earth Virtue; its breath is connected white, governed by the Primordial Bone Earth Chief. The seventh earth is Village Virtue; its breath is connected purple, governed by the First Jia Six Parents. The eighth earth is Restored Virtue; its breath is connected blue, governed by the First Worthy Earth Patriarch. The ninth earth is Prosperous Virtue; its breath is connected green, governed by the Xuanshi Earth with Two Thousand Stones beneath. The Nine Earthly Earth Officials each govern earth mansions, connecting upward to the Twelve Divine Officials of the earthly realms.”

### Universal Generation of the Three Caverns, Chapter Two

At that time, the Yellow Emperor bowed to Lord Ning, asking about the Three Caverns’ revered scriptures, the three grades of transmission of the dao. Having received explanation, he bowed again and respectfully requested the secret: “The Three Caverns’ revered scriptures give birth to the three realms and thirty-six heavens. The thirty-six divisions are born; each realm has thirty-six heavens. Are the thirty-six heavens also the thirty-six divisions?”

Lord Ning answered: “The Mysterious Primordial Breath is the root of the three realms; the thirty-six divisions give birth to heavenly dharma dwellings. The Three Caverns’ descending virtues are the lords of birth for heaven and humans. The nine saints universally transform as the mysterious root of the Symbol Emperor; the thirty-six divisions are the birth gates of realms; the thirty-six heavens are the grades and ranks of entering the dao.

“Therefore the scripture opens the way, clarifying phenomena and images to connect with scripture; opening the path to attest the dao’s homeland; relying on attestation and cultivation to ascend the sage’s fruition; purifying body and spirit to connect with the dao’s realm; cultivating covenants to dispel delusion and passion. The thirty-six divisions’ cavernous observations all arrive; the thirty-six heavens respond and move according to the heart; the Three Pure Ones’ upper realms correspond to the lower realms’ causes; the Three Realms ascend and descend, laboring in the heart’s head. Grades differ; thus realms are named according to root and response. There are five kinds; listen carefully, I now explain.”

Lord Ning said to the Yellow Emperor: “I once received from the Dao Lord, the King of Transformation and Dharma, the supreme lord of heaven, all fully received. Initially descending the wondrous unity, the sacred transformation began, first born in the origin; the origin connects to the true dao; the origin is born in mystery; mystery governs the immortal teaching. The immortal, true, and sacred ranks, the Three Caverns’ mysterious lords, the Three Treasures’ established ranks, and the three titles also differ.

“Therefore at Dragon Han’s beginning, Yuanshi opened the chart, appearing as the Jade Clarity Heavenly Treasure Holy Lord, titled the Great Cavernous Formless Heavenly Lord, speaking the Great Cavern’s twelve divisions of scripture, teaching the Twelve Holy Heavens of Jade Clarity. Next, at Chi Ming kalpa, appearing as the Supreme Clarity Numinous Treasure True Lord, titled the Cavernous Mystery Nameless Heavenly Lord, speaking the Cavernous Mystery’s twelve divisions of scripture, teaching the Twelve True Heavens of Supreme Clarity. Next, at Shang Huang kalpa, appearing as the Supreme Origin Heavenly Lord, titled the Cavernous Divine Primordial Heavenly Lord, speaking the Cavernous Divine’s twelve divisions of scripture, teaching the Twelve Immortal Heavens of Supreme Purity. The thirty-six divisions of scripture are born among the heavens; heaven and humans perceive and receive, thus named the Three Realms. The Three Vehicles gradually unfold, guiding and connecting the path, opening salvation for the worthy. Responsive bodies descend and receive; generations teach and transform; the heavenly lords universally reveal the Three Caverns’ treasured scriptures, manifesting function according to place.”

Lord Ning said to the Yellow Emperor: “The Primordial Responsive Body’s seventy-two images, above giving birth to the three realms, below giving birth to the three worlds, all receive the Three Caverns, grades and ranks forming shapes, born in the primordial heaven, thus called Heavenly Lord. The thirty-six divisions’ heavenly lords transform the three worlds’ interior; the Three Treasures connect births; responses differ, thus forming the origins of form, color, and desire realms. Also, beings’ root natures differ; though all one heaven, five kinds exist:

“One, the Three Caverns’ Three Realms;

“Two, the responsive transformation of the Three Realms;

“Three, the reverse exit from the Three Realms;

“Four, the flowing into the Three Realms;

“Five, the wheel of rebirth in the Three Realms.

“Anciently, the two caverns and three realms: the thirty-six divisions above give birth to the three realms’ thirty-six heavens; the middle gives birth to the three worlds’ thirty-six emperors; below are the nine fortresses’ thirty-six earth sovereigns. Heaven and humans mutually communicate; the Three Vehicles guide and connect; essence and breath interweave; all receive the Three Caverns, aiding good birth.

“Second, the responsive transformation of the Three Realms: the three divisions and eight scenes correspond to yin and yang, the four seasons’ changes, manifesting birth and aging.

“Third, the reverse exit from the Three Realms: the supreme dao’s wondrous breath nourishes spirit; though dwelling in attachment, it is not defiled; it arises beyond the mundane, leaving the conditioned gate, escaping worldly dust, uniquely transcending the supreme dao.

“Fourth, the flowing into the Three Realms: from the dao’s wondrous root, relying on yin and yang, form is stained by six emotions, manifesting attachment and grasping; good follows good, evil follows evil; revolving and manifesting retribution, entering the gates of good and evil.

“Fifth, the wheel of rebirth in the Three Realms: attachment and grasping cause falling into the three paths, revolving in evil paths, unable to escape, eternally sinking in the sea of suffering, long immersed in love and desire.”

Lord Ning said to the Yellow Emperor: “The Primordial Responsive Body unfolds the Three Caverns’ revered scriptures, completing realms, guiding grades. There is no conditioned or unconditioned; opening and transforming heaven and humans, enabling ascent to the primordial form, entering empty understanding; above revealing the three realms, the Three Caverns’ universal method; below giving birth to the three worlds, responding in three kinds:

“One, the vast empty space;

“Two, obstructing substance, form, and color;

“Three, the dependent and thinking mind-body.

“Regarding the first, vast empty space: the empty cavern’s dao breath, mixed and transformed in the great void, responding in image and establishing non-being, thus forming realms—mountains, rivers, stones, cliffs, rugged and deep, upright, beautiful, and ugly—considered attachments and obstructions. Heaven, humans, and the six paths perceive the original; thus it is called the vast empty space.

“Regarding the second, obstructing substance, form, and color: transforming the three worlds’ thirty-two heavens, born in yin and yang, thus forming substance. From the dao’s wondrous unity, nurturing birth, entrusting the womb, worldly parents, two halves united, grasping form, complete with all roots—this is the color aggregate. Once roots complete, six kinds of consciousness arise, producing discrimination—this is the consciousness aggregate. Once delusions gather dust, discriminations and false appearances arise, producing attachment—this is the perception aggregate. When false perception arises, delusions produce hatred and love, giving rise to greed and anger—this is the volition aggregate. Once aggregates combine, false thoughts solidify, grasping ignorance arises, producing evil deeds, sinking into the three paths, unable to escape—thus called obstructing substance, form, and color.

“Regarding the third, dependent and thinking mind-body: the body is the fruit, born from karmic causes; the wise return to the dao and source; the foolish and ignorant wander in defilement and disgrace, flowing into evil paths. According to their retribution and response, they see birth in the six desires and four minds, thus forming boundaries—thus called dependent and thinking mind-body.

“Therefore, the three realms’ responses differ; retributions vary; five kinds exist:

“One, those not yet entering the three realms’ bondage, though born in their domain, are not caused by the three realms, arising from birth and death, above born in the Four Human Heavens.

“Two, those responding to birth in the formless karma, above arising from the color and desire realms, like four light dusts abandoning consciousness, increasing cultivation of false forms and spirits’ purity.

“Three, those responding to birth in the color realm’s karma, deeply colored, gradually abandoning the six dusts and three times, heavily abandoning the eighteen heavens’ retribution.

“Four, those responding to birth in the desire realm’s karma, six desires’ attachment, thus responding to the six heavens.

“Five, those responding to birth in the three evil paths’ karma, attached to the six desires, three poisons arise, falling into beasts, hungry ghosts, and hell paths.”

### Universal Generation of Officials, Chapter Three

Lord Ning said to the Yellow Emperor: “The Primordial Heavenly Lord once appeared in the Great Luo’s Bright Mist Pavilion, manifesting realms and unfolding the Three Caverns’ thirty-six divisions. The Great Cavern’s upper twelve divisions of scripture possess the Three Caverns’ thirty-six divisions’ merit. Why so? The Great Cavern’s sacred teaching universally births true immortals, encompassing all scriptures’ officials; thus there are the Cavernous Mystery and Cavernous Divine, the thirty-six divisions’ upper grade merit.

“The Cavernous Mystery division does not fully encompass the upper, only connecting below and including the Cavernous Divine; thus there are twenty-four divisions’ true immortals’ power. The Cavernous Divine Immortal Scripture does not reach above, only having the Cavernous Divine’s twelve divisions’ immortal birth merit. The Three Caverns’ responsive transformations universally arise from the root of birth; the Three Treasures connect and guide, subtle and coarse differing.

“From the dao’s wondrous breath, descending traces give birth to spirits; no conditioned is conditioned; having and non-having; embodying and understanding the great dao; awakening the unsurpassed mind; liberation from non-action; always joyful, self-true.

“The Cavernous Mystery true teaching, middle vehicle’s cause, descends from sage to true, entering mystery; thus speaking of responsive transformation, opening the gate of expedience, knowing being and non-being, arising cultivation, free from love and defilement, leaving the conditioned realm, cultivating right observation, abiding in the middle path.

“The Cavernous Divine Immortal teaching, entrusting cause and green, thus establishing realms’ heavenly officials, opening and transforming human and spirit, establishing dharma. The Three Treasures universally transform; immortals are birth gates; from birth arise cultivation, entering the formless body.

“Therefore manifesting responsive transformation, immortal yang gives birth to the head; from birth to immortal, immortal to true, true to sacred, sacred to dao. The Three Caverns’ wondrous existence takes breath as root; root born from beginning; beginning born from origin; origin born from mystery.

“The beginning breath corresponds to the sacred, above giving birth to Jade Clarity; the origin breath governs truth, middle giving birth to Supreme Clarity; the mystery governs immortal teaching, below giving birth to Supreme Purity. The Three Pure Ones’ images, the Three Treasures’ universal arrival, the thirty-six divisions, responding to heaven’s teaching, the thirty-six heavens, the Three Caverns’ roots, the Three Realms’ breath, responding to realms’ cultivation grades, seventy-two images, realms’ shapes descend, eighty-one excellences, manifesting great existence.

“Therefore at Dragon Han kalpa, titled Formless Heavenly Lord, appearing as Jade Clarity Heavenly Treasure Holy Lord, the Great Cavern’s sovereign Jade Emperor, giving birth to ninety-nine trillion nine hundred ninety billion breaths; each breath gives birth to ninety-nine trillion nine hundred ninety billion li; each breath gives birth to ninety-nine trillion nine hundred ninety billion years; years and li count end; calendar divisions combine, descending to the Three Realms, called the Great Kalpa.

“Next at Chi Ming kalpa, titled Nameless Heavenly Lord, appearing as Supreme Clarity Numinous Treasure True Lord, the Cavernous Mystery sovereign lord, giving birth to ninety-nine million nine hundred ninety-nine thousand breaths; each breath gives birth to ninety-nine thousand nine hundred ninety li; each breath gives birth to ninety-nine thousand nine hundred ninety years; years and li count end; calendar divisions combine, descending to the Three Realms, called the Middle Kalpa.

“Next at Shang Huang kalpa, titled Primordial Heavenly Lord, the Cavernous Divine sovereign lord, giving birth to ninety-nine million nine hundred ninety thousand breaths; each breath gives birth to ninety-nine thousand nine hundred ninety li; each breath gives birth to ninety-nine thousand nine hundred ninety years; years and li count end; calendar divisions combine, descending to the Three Realms, called the Small Kalpa.

“The Heavenly Lord said: ‘Now I respond in form; realms pervade the body; above manifesting heavens; below responding to myriad images; through kalpas transforming and saving myriad people. Those with dao descend as masters to teach; or born in lower realms, mingling with things in darkness, entrusting substance to connect with the mundane, sinking and floating indistinguishable; communicating and transforming with the dao, responding and connecting by cause and condition; receiving this scripture to open wisdom and understanding, secretly cultivating salvation, not relying on grace, mind pure and spirit clear, to proclaim this dharma.’”

Lord Ning again said to the Yellow Emperor: “The Three Pure Ones and Nine Emperors, Eight Scenes and universal directions, give birth to the three realms, universally guiding and connecting, descending to the Three Worlds, forms and beings complete, opening heaven and humans, all receiving officials. Therefore the Mysterious Primordial Breath each gives birth to eight scenes, becoming the Twenty-Four Emperors; the Nine Heavens each give birth to eight scenes, becoming the Seventy-Two Officials.

“The Twenty-Four Emperors transform into Twenty-Four Spirits; the Twenty-Four Spirits transform into Twenty-Four Breaths; breaths also become spirits; spirits also become breaths; dispersing as clouds and mist; gathering as form and shadow; issuing forth as creation; entering as true unity; above connecting the Three Origins; speaking of connecting myriad things. The true spirits’ transformations have no fixed name; among the hundred spirits, all form virtue from three combinations.

“Heaven and earth’s extreme upper realm’s Twenty-Four Emperors correspond exactly to the lower Twenty-Four Breaths. The Twenty-Four Emperors, each with three origins, each origin with five spirits, combine to give birth to Three Hundred and Sixty Spirits, mixing through the Three Realms’ Three Hundred and Sixty Spirits. Each gives birth to one heaven’s Three Hundred and Sixty Palaces; each gives birth to one year’s Three Hundred and Sixty days; each gives birth to one month’s Three Hundred and Sixty hours; each gives birth to one human’s Three Hundred and Sixty bones; universally giving birth to one earth’s Three Hundred and Sixty named mountains. Below connecting to heavenly breath, the Eight Scenes all arrive; above pouring forth birth fluid; combined breath planted together.

“The limitless Three Realms universally receive this root; heaven and humans mutually communicate; myriad realms interpenetrate. The Eight Scenes open and transform, responding and imaging the root. The Twenty-Four Emperors above give birth to Three Hundred and Sixty Spirits, six ranks forming, combined as Sixty-Four Brahma Breaths. Six ranks combine into Thirty-Two; Thirty-Two years, one heavenly cycle. Thus clarifying the Three Realms’ Thirty-Two Heavens.

“The Three Pure Ones’ nine breaths, upper and lower, communicate with spirits, passing through the celestial pivot; the four seasons shine clearly. The Three Caverns’ calendar counts years as three origins; six positions of yang days; six fasting months. The Eight Scenes circulate; the Eight Festivals cultivate gates; the Ten Directs attend the honored; cultivating the Ten Virtues. Burning incense and making vows, merit responds among the heavens; lamps continue shining, rescuing the living and dead; incense, flowers, and precious canopies offer to the heavens. Reciting the honored scriptures enables wisdom and understanding; above, repentance for seven ancestral generations’ past calamities; below, containing spirits, jointly nourishing dharma’s grace. The Three Pure Ones’ assembly of saints looks down upon sincere elixirs; the three realms’ palaces and officials jointly supervise and illuminate. The Three Palaces are pure and clear; the Nine Doors perfectly bright; the Five Viscera dawn clearly; the Six Fu communicate wisdom. The Eighty-One Good Qualities shine forth the eighty-one gates’ mechanisms; the thirty-two images illuminate the three hundred and sixty bones; the thirty-two emperors manifest the mysterious void; the thirty-six heavens reveal the summit image. The Eight Scenes fully guard; the Nine Heavens’ winged forms ride the scenes and drive the dragon, ascending to Jade Clarity.”

Lord Ning said to the Yellow Emperor: “The great dao births and transforms; nothing is not permeated; all-encompassing with no outside; subtle and entering the gapless; nothing does not receive; primordial things not born; nothing not measured; nothing not completed. Opening the vast space, divided into ten grades, from the upper Great Luo down to the Three Pure Ones, forming seven divisions; above and beside all equipped with vast space as the dao’s realm. Thus on the Mountain of the Mysterious Capital Jade Capital, there are seven awakening breaths.

“Below Great Luo arise the Three Realms, combined into seven divisions; beside them vast space, communicating as sacred realms. Furthermore, the Three Pure Ones and eight directions each have a division beneath, giving birth to countless earthly realms—five hundred billion, fifty trillion, five trillion, five hundred billion, fifty billion, five hundred million, and so forth. The limitless Three Realms all receive the five breaths and five movements, thus communicating the fifty-five numbers of heaven and earth.

“The Three Origins, upper and lower, all combine the Three Caverns and Nine Emperors, Twelve Heavens, summing the Three Origins’ Thirty-Six Emperors. The central and eight directions universally receive the Three Pure Ones, only responding to the four seasons’ thirty-two heavens and three hundred and sixty degrees, forming the Twenty-Eight Constellations. The Five Movements generate and transform; though responding to the dao’s root, they divide and correspond to the mundane, from the upper eighth division. Furthermore, beneath the limitless Three Realms, another division arises as the Nine Fortresses’ Thirty-Six Earth Emperors. All receive the Three Realms, connecting to the Three Pure Ones; each year’s eight festivals and four seasons’ days record human good and evil, reporting upward to the Three Pure Ones. Good and evil, sin and blessing, are counted above and below; this corresponds to the upper ninth division.

“Beneath the Nine Fortresses are the Eight Gates and Nine Dark Hells; above is Yang’s trial, below Yin’s punishment; above and below each nine, also called the Eighteen Great Hells. Beneath these hells is the great wind marsh’s breath—like wind but not wind, like water but not water. Consciousness suffers, nature is dim, cannot distinguish. Holding the earth’s wheel, it does not topple; this is the upper tenth division.”

Lord Ning said to the Yellow Emperor: “The Three Caverns’ universal transformation, the nine breaths’ mixed birth, heaven has thirty-six lords, earth has thirty-six offices. The three realms descend; nine breaths universally generate; the Nine Fortresses rise; the Three Realms respond mutually. One heaven’s realm, two scenes combine clearly; three lights simultaneously arrive; four threads all complete; the celestial pivot mixed and combined, governing the myriad, widely covering living spirits, maturing response breath.

“The celestial cycle’s calendar and transport pass through mysterious gates; the Nine Fortresses’ earth gods each govern earthly realms. The Grand Duke, the Great Yin, and the Great General, the Yearly Virtue, establish and break gods. If practitioners cultivate the Three Caverns’ Three Pure Ones’ supreme scriptures, they should diligently respect the Nine Earthly Spirits below, not causing harm.

### The Supreme Dao’s Dharma Body’s Responsive Birth of Good Appearance, Chapter Four

At that time the Yellow Emperor crossed Mount Yuntai, worshipping Lord Xiao, asking about the Three Caverns’ three grades opening salvation, responding to heaven and humans; next asking about the Three Treasures’ universal generation of realms; then asking about realms’ universal generation of heaven and humans; humans connecting to dao giving birth; birth connecting to dao’s body; dao connecting without outside; universally complete in form and spirit; the supreme dao selfless—how do responses and transformations differ?

Lord Ning said to the Yellow Emperor: “The Three Caverns’ Nine Emperors, the Nine Heavens’ birth gates, the immortal, true, and sacred ranks, each has nine grades and twenty-seven positions. The Three Caverns’ grades, migrating from mundane to immortal, eighty-one ranks, originally the Three Realms’ confusion and darkness, unevenly mixed; thus the Three Vehicles were established as grades.

“The supreme dao’s jade emperor, merits complete in the Ten Directions, thus establishing the Three Treasures; the Three Lords differ, manifesting three bodies, three forms each distinct. Therefore at Dragon Han kalpa, the sacred teaching was titled Formless Heavenly Lord; at Chi Ming kalpa, the true teaching titled Nameless Heavenly Lord; at Shang Huang kalpa, the immortal teaching titled Primordial Heavenly Lord.

“The Three Treasures’ responsive teachings, the Three Vehicles differ; responsive transformation of dharma body, original and trace also differ. Formerly at Dragon Han’s beginning, opening the chart in Great Luo’s Bright Mist Pavilion, unfolding the Three Caverns’ thirty-six divisions, giving birth to realms, each with thirty-six heavens, internally unfolding ten titles, the chaotic heavenly origin.

“The Mysterious Primordial Breath corresponds to mysterious image, bright light shining through, nine colors overlapping radiance, the Eight Scenes perfectly clear, giving birth to good appearance, giving birth to realms, transformation body becoming human, humans and heavens’ fruits and retributions, mundane and sacred differ; three bodies’ good appearances differ above, middle, and below, establishing human and spirit, all receiving transformation bodies.”

Lord Ning said to the Yellow Emperor: “Formerly at the beginning of kalpa, the supreme dao’s jade emperor, the Formless Heavenly Lord, in Great Luo’s Bright Mist Pavilion, expounded the Three Caverns’ responsive ten titles, arranged the Nine Emperors and established the Nine Heavens; the immortal, true, and sacred ranks are the Three Treasures’ mysterious ford; the twenty-seven positions are the realms’ cultivation grades; the thirty-six divisions’ upper are the three realms’ mysterious roots; below are the three worlds’ thirty-six heavens’ responsive dwellings; seventy-two images, realms’ shapes descend; eighty-one excellences, humans and heavens’ birth origin.

“Changes and transformations pervade the great thousand worlds, inhaling and exhaling responsive bodies, universally giving birth to five hundred million. The limitless Three Realms, beside and vast without boundary, realms communicating with spirits, above and below both receiving. Each kalpa manifests, names differ; generations transform, honored names differ.

“The first title is Source; source is root and origin. The second title is Mixed; mixed is indistinguishable. The third title is Chaotic; chaotic is primal and great. The fourth title is Dark; dark is vast and deep. The fifth title is Whirling; whirling is boundless. The sixth title is Mist; mist is like fine fog. The seventh title is Hollow; hollow is like surging flood. The eighth title is Beginning; beginning breath condenses in Great Luo. The ninth title is Origin; origin is the leader of goodness. The tenth title is Mystery; mystery governs the upper heaven.

“Mystery beyond mystery, the heavenly supreme lord, titled Your Majesty, above fully prepared the birth root. Therefore the Nameless Heavenly Lord, descending from Great Luo’s eight titles’ beginning breath, first born in Jade Clarity, teaching sacred dao, Great Cavern’s dharma gate; next from Jade Clarity’s nine titles origin breath, descending to Supreme Clarity, teaching true dao, Cavernous Mystery’s dharma gate; next from Supreme Clarity’s ten titles mystery breath, descending to Supreme Purity, teaching immortal dao, Cavernous Divine’s dharma gate.

“Furthermore, the three realms below give birth to three worlds; realms mutually respond; the Three Vehicles differ; the Three Realms guide and connect; the Three Worlds also differ. Jade Clarity’s sacred realm connects downward to the formless; Supreme Clarity’s true realm connects downward to the color realm; Supreme Purity’s immortal realm connects downward to the desire realm.

“Furthermore, the Three Caverns universally give birth to humans and spirits; heaven and humans mutually communicate; nine doors equally peaceful. Jade Clarity’s sacred realm gives birth to humans’ upper one, the Mud Pillar Upper Palace; Supreme Clarity’s true realm gives birth to humans’ middle one, the True Crimson Palace; Supreme Purity’s immortal realm gives birth to humans’ lower one, the Yellow Court Immortal Palace. Therefore humans’ lower Yellow Court Primordial King is the lord of birth spirits, containing breath and life’s master. The immortal dao governs birth, relying on birth for cultivation. The immortal’s words of migration: migrating and ascending to Supreme Clarity; migrating immortal into true, ascending to Supreme Clarity; migrating true into sacred, ascending to Jade Clarity; migrating sacred into dao, ascending to Great Luo, the supreme dao’s realm, vast and silent, condensed and obscure.”

### Primordial Transformation of Responsive Bodies and Establishment of the Three Pure Ones’ Thirty-Six Images, Chapter Eleven

Lord Ning said to the Yellow Emperor: “Formerly I received from the Heavenly Lord, at Great Luo Heaven, expounding the *Supreme Clarity Opening Heaven’s Primordial Establishment Scripture*, responsive bodies giving birth to images, realms’ shapes descending.

“The upper part’s nine transformations, three realms communicating form; the middle part’s nine orifices, nine-one universal transformation; the lower part’s nine names, nine earths communicating spirits.

“The brain’s nine palaces: first, the Supreme Emperor Palace, where the Supreme Lord resides; second, the Jade Emperor Palace, where Jade Clarity’s divine lord resides; third, the Heavenly Court Palace, where Supreme Clarity’s divine lord resides; fourth, the Ultimate True Palace, where the Great Pole divine lord resides; fifth, the Mysterious Elixir Palace, where the True Lord resides; sixth, the Flowing Pearl Palace, where the divine immortals reside; seventh, the Elixir Field Palace, where the Upper Origin Red Child True Man Emperor Lord’s minister resides; eighth, the Cavern Room Palace, with the Left No Hero Young Master, Right White Origin Lord, and center Yellow Old Three Souls residing; ninth, the Bright Hall Palace, with the Left Bright Boy True Officer, Right Bright Girl True Officer, and center Bright Mirror True Officer residing.

“The middle one, the Crimson Palace Heart, has nine orifices, connecting to the nine truths; the Middle Origin True Man resides in this palace; the Elixir Emperor Lord and Minister assist and govern the Crimson Palace, guarding the nine truths’ dao.

“Communing with things, mingling with the mundane, is the Perfected Person; manifesting without fixed form, is the Sage; truly pure and wondrously transforming, is the True Man; universally saving and migrating, is the Immortal; spirit and power unobstructed, is the Divine Person; reaching having and connecting with non-being, is the Spiritual Person; wondrously eloquent and penetrating subtlety, is the Worthy Person; embracing dao and cherishing virtue, is the Daoist; merit and practice both complete, is the Practitioner.

“The heart’s nine orifices give birth to nine persons, nine kinds communicating directions, completing the central one image.

“The lower origin infant guards the Primordial Yang Palace, positioned as the Yellow Court Primordial King; on the right is the Protector Minister, jointly guarding the Lower Yellow Court Palace. Tao Kang Life Lord comprehends mysterious images and purple mist, three coils of yellow clouds, four entwining wombs, the life gate’s birth spirit master.

“Connecting above to the nine heavens, below to the nine earths, internally giving birth to one body as nine spirits; above are nine persons, three threes forming positions. On the left is Han Zhong; on the right Fan Li; in the center Da Chengzi; left kidney is Minister of Works; right kidney is Minister of Construction; center is the Great One Lord; left has Jade Maiden of Azure Waist; right has Jade Maiden of White Purity; center has Jade Maiden of Mysterious Light.

“The Jade Maiden of Mysterious Light is the dao’s primordial breath, mother of generation, descending breath to the lower womb’s mansion; the Three Pure Ones’ wondrous transformation; nine breaths descending spirits, giving birth to humans’ three palaces and twenty-seven positions, internally combining nine spirits and thirty-six images.”
