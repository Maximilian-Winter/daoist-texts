## The Most High Profound Cavern Numinous Treasure True Unity Admonishing Dharma Wheel Sublime Scripture

The Most High, Lofty and Profound, Supreme Ultimate, Three Officials, Dharma Master, Perfected True Unity Person spoke the *Most High Profound Cavern Numinous Treasure True Unity Sincere Admonishing Dharma Wheel Sublime Scripture*. The ancient text was preserved in the Most High Six Harmonies Profound Platform. The canonical scripture was transmitted by the Dragon Blossom Jade Maiden and the Golden Dawn Jade Youth, scattering blossoms and burning incense, guarded by numinous script attendants, passed down once every forty thousand kalpas according to ritual. By imperial command, it was entrusted to the Supreme Ultimate Left Immortal Lord.

The Supreme Ultimate Left Immortal Lord, in quiet fasting on Mount Tiantai, purged sins, burned incense, and repented with sincerity, contemplating the true and meditating on the dao. Within one hundred days, the divine numinous manifested, resembling a phantom, above the void profound, clouds and light dazzling and resplendent, sometimes present, sometimes absent, sometimes dispersed, sometimes gathered, weaving reflections through the fasting hall. The Immortal Lord felt a profound suffering that reached the farthest heavens, touching the primordial truth. Thereupon he pondered the mysterious work, his resolve exceedingly diligent. Before the year of fasting was complete, he was graced with a response from the supreme sage descending, bending into the secluded chamber. On the night of the primal month, the day of Gengyin, suddenly appeared flying clouds and cinnabar skies, eight wondrous jade chariots, treasure canopies shining within caverns, streaming brilliance of the Great Nothingness. Incense was burned and blossoms scattered as they floated in the air. A thousand chariots, ten thousand riders, numinous beings blazing with radiance beyond measure. Dragons soared, phoenixes sang in graceful flight, lions and white cranes roared and called, celestial children and jade maidens numbered in the tens of millions, each holding the scepter of life and demon suppression, ten peerless floral banners, harnessed steeds with scaled mounts, luxuriant numinous pavilions—all at once the numinous beings descended.

The first proclaimed himself the Most High True Unity First Perfected Person, Yuluo Qiao; the second, the Most High True Unity Second Perfected Person, Guang Miaoyin; the third, the Most High True Unity Third Perfected Person, Zhen Dingguang. The Three Perfected assembled together, each wearing a round halo illuminating the Ten Directions, all seated on golden brocade mats, attendants on left and right holding floral banners, burning a hundred fragrant blends, holding aloft azure-blue altars, wearing eight-colored scarves. They requested the *True Unity Admonishing Dharma Wheel Sublime Scripture*, flying texts in brocade tents, seven-treasure tassels, the profound-covered scripture above, numinous truth blazing brilliantly in the boundless void. Then the Immortal Lord kowtowed and bowed in reverence. The celestial venerables were immensely august; he dared not speak of himself, only his heart rejoiced and spirit soared, humbly listening to the words of admonition.

The Most High True Unity Perfected Person Yuluo Qiao said to the Supreme Ultimate Left Immortal Lord:  
“You have accumulated kalpas in thought and deed, sacrificing body to save beings, opening the path to liberation, extending grace even to grass and trees. Entrusting your body to forests and hills, guarding feelings and enduring appearances, revering teachers and ancestors without weariness, your bitter resolve is steadfast. Thus you have attained supreme virtue, inscribed in the Purple Orchid Terrace, Golden Gate, Supreme Clarity Palace, with jade scripts in purple characters—your merit is majestic, your conduct accords with the upper immortals. The Most High commands the Supreme Ultimate Perfected Person Xu to come and enroll you, securing your place as Great Dharma Master of the Three Caverns. Now I am commanded to be your first degree master. You may sit again; I will reveal to you the Dharma Wheel of liberation, the essential admonishing secrets, so you may know of past karmic destiny, prior sins and blessings, and the present retribution. Do you wish to hear? Those who can accept it should listen quietly.”

The Most High True Unity Second Perfected Person Guang Miaoyin said to the Left Immortal Lord:  
“You turn the wheel of birth and death, forming bonds with goodness, accumulating ripened merit through kalpas, generation after generation without rest. Forsaking glory and official rank, casting yourself into secluded hills, enduring hunger and cold in barren places, thinking of the dao without speech, revering the teacher’s treasure, always facing the divine, compassionate and gentle in heart, sitting and rising with joy, fasting long and pondering bitterly without pause, your spirit refined and far-reaching—thus your name is marked in Supreme Clarity. The Most High commands me to be your second degree master, to fully reveal to you the three paths and five pains, the root of life and death, the admonishing secrets, so you may understand the suffering of soul and spirit and whence it comes. Do you desire to hear? I shall speak it for you; you must accept it.”

The Most High True Unity Third Perfected Person Zhen Dingguang said to the Left Immortal Lord:  
“You have blessings from seven lifetimes, cutting your mouth to save the poor, kindness extending even to birds and beasts, blessings flowing to descendants, moistening and sprinkling your body. You have also accumulated diligence, personally serving the teacher’s treasure, cold without thinking of furs, hungry without neglecting food, enduring hardship in forest caves, focusing your mind without wavering, the purple treasury receiving truth, a wondrous light born at your nape. This has brought the highest exalted descent, conferring the title of Immortal Lord, to repay past virtue—how majestic indeed! The Most High now commands me to be your third degree master. I shall now reveal to you the boundless sublime penetration, spirit-entering meditation, the admonishing secrets. Will you take it as your lineage? I shall speak it; you close your mouth and cultivate it.”

The Most High True Unity Perfected Person said:  
“When Heaven and Earth were established, the primordial beginning divided and distinguished, yin and yang opened and transformed, the Five Phases took their places. There was neither above nor below, no Heaven nor Earth, no great nor small, within no color, beyond no form—all received the empty cavity, taking qi as their root. The root was born at the beginning, the beginning born from the primordial, the primordial born from the profound; the three gave birth to myriad things, none without succession. The framework spans the eight extremes, ensuring Heaven and Earth endure long. The myriad numinous high immortals, those who have attained the dao in the Ten Directions, the Four Corners, the boundless worlds of dust and sand, have all come from countless kalpas, none without a teacher. All have received the Supreme Clarity Three Caverns Treasure Scriptures from their masters, thereby becoming high immortals, supreme sages, and teachers of the Ten Directions. The master is the treasure. To learn without a master, the dao cannot be established; without a master, one cannot walk the path; without a master, one cannot be born; without a master, one cannot be liberated; without a master, one cannot become immortal. Therefore, the master is my father. If you do not love your master, the dao will not descend, demons will ruin your body, the eight wondrous dragon chariots cannot be controlled, the Supreme Ultimate Jade Gate cannot be ascended. The Confucian teaching has the Three Tombs and Five Classics, Eight Ropes and Nine Hills, all instructing scholars by masters’ teachings, still transmitting master to achieve clarity. How much more so you now study the Supreme Clarity dao, hoping to ascend and forever enjoy boundless blessing? To slight the master and practice the dao seeking mere fleshly flight, thinking to cast yourself into night’s light, you lose your single chance. Yet you have accumulated kalpas of diligence, turning and unwearied, your merit full and virtue accomplished, jade scripts and purple characters inscribed on the Profound Platform, your rank ascending to the Supreme Ultimate Immortal Lord’s post. But if the three masters are incomplete, the admonition not full, you will not be ready to ascend the Supreme Ultimate Palace. The Most High, seeing your past merits high and weighty, commands us to be your three masters, to transmit the essential admonishing secrets, to complete your dao, so you swiftly attain flight through the Three Realms, roam Supreme Clarity, your body arriving at the Golden Gate, receiving the title Immortal Lord.”  

The Immortal Lord replied humbly, “Yes, yes,” receiving the command with folded hands. He prayed the Heavenly Venerable would pity and have compassion, and now he would listen and obey.

The Most High True Unity Perfected Person said:  
“The *Most High True Unity Sincere Admonishing Dharma Wheel Sublime Scripture* is by command of the Nine Heavens, appearing once every forty thousand kalpas. The Most High Void Sovereign once transmitted it to the Most High Great Dao Lord; the Great Dao Lord transmitted it to the Great Emperor of the Supreme Subtle Heaven; the Heavenly Emperor transmitted it to the Later Sage, the Golden Gate Supreme Emperor, commanding it be entrusted to Immortal Lords, Immortal Officials, and Immortal Kings who have already become perfected persons, but not transmitted to middle immortals nor the Five Sacred Mountains’ immortals. Without the profound name and imperial chart, the recorded characters of the Three Pure Ones’ Supreme Ultimate Jade Script, none but the Immortal Lords in essence may consult or hear it. This scripture is lofty and subtle, greatly valued by the Most High, stored within the Six Harmonies Purple Chamber, guarded in secret by immortal children and maidens. Those who glimpse its titles celebrate the Seven Ancestors, the dead souls ascend to Heaven, blessings cover a whole lineage, the gates flourish, and the world produces sages and wise ones. Cultivating it leads to riding cloud chariots and dragon steeds, flying by daylight. Carelessness, sloth, or slandering the sacred text will be judged and punished in your body; rewards and punishments correspond. Be mindful and cautious.”

The Most High True Unity Perfected Person told the Immortal Lord:  
“In the past, I received the Most High Limitless Great Dao Lord’s *True Unity Admonishing Dharma Wheel Sublime Scripture*. Cultivating and serving the master, six times a day I burn incense, bowing and circling in the morning. Always first paying homage to my master, with heart and eyes fixed, seeing the master as in the scripture; without the master, no scripture is seen. Once the scripture is obtained, the master is right before me. Enduring hunger and thirst, following the master east and west, I received the master’s instruction, urging me to complete the scripture. The pain was like knife cuts, the endurance like poison needles; bowing and serving, I never dared neglect, pain I dared not refuse, poison I dared not speak of. Thus I endured for four hundred million years, attaining the true dao, rising to the rank of Most High True Unity Perfected Person. Now again commanded by the master, I am to be your threefold degree master. Can you be like me? If you can, I shall reveal the scripture to you.”

The Immortal Lord kowtowed and thanked, reporting to the Most High True Unity Perfected Person, the threefold degree master:  
“I am fortunate to gaze upon the heavenly visage, further instructed by the master, again taught the essentials. The boundless divisions are not mere trifles. Reflecting on my karmic roots, I was born into the dharma gate, somewhat fond of the dao above, revering the divine immortals, fasting long in secluded hills, my heart imagining the supreme sage, yet not awakening to the Heavenly Venerable, peering into the hidden valley, receiving the true dao’s teaching. I consider myself dim and obscure, ashamed beyond bearing. Yet looking forward, I vow by the Three Lights, personally following the master’s teaching, never daring to fall short, weaving through myriad kalpas, my feelings never turning back, revering and serving the dharma, only following the master. Forever I wish for pity and compassion, to awaken what I have not yet understood, to open deep instructions, to expound the dharma and admonition, to see deliverance and salvation. Humbly I listen to the command, vowing to obey.”
