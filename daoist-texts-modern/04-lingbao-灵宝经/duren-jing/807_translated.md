# The Supreme Cavernous Mysterious Numinous Treasure Primordial Infinite Salvation of Beings Highest Grade Sublime Scripture (Dunhuang Manuscript)

The Dao speaks:

In ancient times, amid the Primordial Azure Heaven, beneath the Celestial Vault’s silent song, lay the vast floating land of myriad peoples. Receiving the Primordial Salvation of Beings, the Infinite Highest Grade, the Primordial Heavenly Venerable then spoke this scripture. Ten cycles of repetition summoned the Ten Directions, and thus all were to come forth to their seats. The Celestial Primal Spirits, the Supreme Saints, the Lofty Venerables, the Sublime Practitioners of Reality, countless in number beyond reckoning, rode the void to arrive. They flew on clouds through vermilion skies, in green chariots and jade wheels, beneath feathered canopies that cast gentle shade. Streams of essence and jade light flowed, five colors vibrant and flourishing, illuminating the vast emptiness. For seven days and seven nights, the heavens’ sun and moon, the constellations and the pivoting stars, the jade balance suspended in orbit, the divine winds hushed and still, mountains and seas veiled in clouds, the sky free of drifting shadows, the four airs bright and clear. One nation’s land, mountains, rivers, forests, and trees, all leveled as one, no high or low remained; the earth was all fashioned of turquoise jade, without any differing hues. The assembly of numinous beings attended their seats; the Primordial Heavenly Venerable hung his throne suspended in the void atop a five-colored lion.

When the scripture was spoken once, the great saints of the heavens all simultaneously praised its goodness; at that moment, the deaf and sick of one nation had their ears opened and hearing restored. When spoken twice, the blind regained their sight. When thrice repeated, the mute found voice. When four times, the lame and the sick, long afflicted, all rose and walked. When five times, chronic illnesses vanished, restoring the body instantly. When six times, white hair turned black again, fallen teeth regrew. When seven times, the aged became vigorous, the young all strong. When eight times, women conceived, beasts bore young, both born and unborn gained life. When nine times, earth’s treasures poured forth, golden jade dew took form. When ten times, dry bones revived, all arose as adults.

At that time, all men and women of one nation, without exception, inclined their hearts, receiving protection and salvation, all attaining longevity.

The Dao speaks:

At that time, the Primordial Heavenly Venerable, after speaking the scripture once, summoned from the East the Infinite Limitless Highest Grade True Great Spirits, countless in number, who floated down from the void. After twice, from the South came the Infinite Limitless Highest Grade True Great Spirits, countless in number, floating down. Thrice, from the West came the Infinite Limitless Highest Grade True Great Spirits, countless in number, floating down. Four times, from the North came the Infinite Limitless Highest Grade True Great Spirits, countless in number, floating down. Five times, from the Northeast came the Infinite Limitless Highest Grade True Great Spirits, countless in number, floating down. Six times, from the Southeast came the Infinite Limitless Highest Grade True Great Spirits, countless in number, floating down. Seven times, from the Southwest came the Infinite Limitless Highest Grade True Great Spirits, countless in number, floating down. Eight times, from the Northwest came the Infinite Limitless Highest Grade True Great Spirits, countless in number, floating down. Nine times, from Above came the Infinite Limitless Highest Grade True Great Spirits, countless in number, floating down. Ten times, from Below came the Infinite Limitless Highest Grade True Great Spirits, countless in number, floating down. When the ten cycles were complete, the Infinite Limitless Celestial True Great Spirits of the Ten Directions all arrived simultaneously.

The men and women of one nation, their hearts wholly inclined in reverence, received the visitors like fine rain and dense mist. The countless hosts, half of the nation’s land sank and tilted, impossible to restrain. Then the Primordial Venerable suspended a precious pearl, as large as a grain of millet, in the mysterious void, five zhang above the earth. The Primordial ascended, leading the Celestial Primal Spirits, Supreme Saints, Sublime Practitioners of Reality, the Infinite Limitless Highest Grade True Great Spirits, and the countless hosts—all entered within the pearl. The celestial beings looked up and saw only a vibrant surge entering the pearl’s mouth; once inside, none knew where they were. The people dispersed, the land returned to level and even, no longer tilted or sunken. Within the pearl, the Primordial then completed the scripture’s recitation, the numinous beings overseeing salvation, entrusting it to me. At this moment, joy and celebration were beyond words; the rites were roughly complete, the heavens restored to their places, and in an instant, all was silent without echo. At that time, the celestial beings encountered the scripture’s law and universally attained salvation. Their original years remained intact, without harm or injury. The entire land turned in reverence, all practiced kindness of heart: no killing or harming, no jealousy or envy, no lust or theft, no greed or desire, no hatred or discord; their words lacked flowery artifice, their mouths no evil sounds, all equally compassionate and loving, different bones becoming kin, the nation peaceful and the people prosperous, rejoicing in great peace.

When the scripture first emerged, it taught one nation the dao; those with prior resolve and heart of aspiration, who honored and reverenced it, all attained salvation in the world.

The Dao speaks:

What the Primordial Heavenly Venerable spoke within the scripture are all the inner names and hidden rhymes of the celestial emperors of the heavens, also the secret taboo names of the demon kings and the hidden names of myriad spirits—not the common words of the world. The Supreme Saint, having perfected reality and penetrated mystery, can fully comprehend its chapters.

When recited ten times, the heavens chant from afar, myriad emperors perform rites, rivers and seas fall silent, mountains and peaks hide in clouds, the sun and moon pause their light, the pivoting stars cease their movement, demons lose their forms, ghosts and spirits vanish, corpses revive from death, white bones become human again.

Those who study deeply, reciting ten times, are attended by the five emperors’ guards, the Three Realms bow in homage, demon spirits lose their sight, ghosts and monsters vanish, salvation descends to the dying, death is cut off and life restored.

Therefore, scholars, if your defilements have not vanished, your body has not yet penetrated truth, you summon and command the Ten Directions, but your power has not yet subdued Heaven, your virtue and governance can only restrain Earth, binding demon spirits—but death cannot be reversed. If you lightly recite this chapter, your body will suffer calamity; but if you offer respectful worship and rites, your gates will flourish, your generations prosper, you will be bound to good causes, and countless disasters will not touch you; divine beings will guard your gates. This scripture is revered and sublime, unrivaled in the Jade Capital, saving infinite beings, the ancestor of myriad daos, majestic and vast, virtue difficult to surpass.

The Dao speaks:

Whoever recites this scripture ten times, the heavens all arrive together, countless ancestors of myriad generations, the suffering souls of the netherworld, all immediately receive salvation and ascend to the Vermilion Palace. They undergo nine years of discipline, receive transformation and rebirth, and become noble persons. Those who love study and reach completion of merit and virtue all become divine immortals, soaring to the Golden Pavilion, feasting and wandering in the Jade Capital. Advanced students who cultivate and recite this scripture all receive salvation and ascend to the Southern Palace. Those of the world who recite it extend their years and longevity, and later all attain the dao of corpse liberation; their soul and spirit temporarily vanish, bypassing hell, immediately regaining form, traveling the vast emptiness.

This scripture is subtle and wondrous, universally saving without end; all celestial beings receive its blessing, immeasurable fortune, life and death covered by grace, treasured by Heaven, not passed down to the world below, only transmitted by the highest scholars who fast with gold and treasure, pledging their hearts in covenant with Heaven. To leak or treat it lightly brings calamity to nine ancestors, long servitude to ghost officials.

Attending the scripture are the five emperors, jade boys and jade maidens, each twenty-four in number, arranging and guarding the divine script, protecting the bodies of those who receive the scripture.

The Dao speaks:

In the first month, observe a long fast and recite this scripture. For the departed souls of past generations, severing earthly bonds and servitude, ascending to the Southern Palace. In the seventh month, observe a long fast and recite this scripture; the body attains immortality, the heavens record the names, yellow registers and white slips erase death and grant life. In the tenth month, observe a long fast and recite this scripture for kings and emperors, rulers, ministers, fathers and sons; securing the nation’s fate, preserving Heaven’s permanence, unbroken through generations; always becoming human lords, stabilizing their realms, the people acclaiming great peace. On the eight festival days, recite this scripture and become a True Person of the Nine Palaces. On one’s birth day, recite this scripture; the soul and spirit become pure and correct, the myriad energies endure long. Without suffering or distress, the body shines with light. The Three Realms attend and guard, the five emperors oversee the welcome, myriad gods pay homage, names are recorded in Heaven; when merit is full and virtue complete, one ascends to the Supreme Clarity.

The Dao speaks:

On the day of practicing the dao, one must bathe in fragrant water, fast and enter the chamber, face east and knock teeth thirty-two times, hearing the thirty-two heavens above, heart bowing thirty-two times, closing eyes and meditating: the body sits amid clouds of blue, yellow, and white qi, inside and out enveloped in mystery, with Azure Dragon and White Tiger, Vermilion Bird and Dark Warrior, Lion and White Crane arrayed on left and right; the sun and moon illuminate, the chamber shines brilliantly, the neck forms a round image, light reflects in all ten directions, all clearly so.

A secret incantation says: Supreme Mysterious Origin, Most High Dao Lord, summon from my body the three and five merit officers, the left and right officials, the fragrant jade boys, the passing jade maidens, the five emperors holding the talisman, the day’s incense officials, each thirty-two in number, to dispel and open what is spoken, today’s auspicious celebration, long fasting in the pure hall, cultivating and practicing the scripture, infinitely saving beings, may what is opened reach through, directly to the Most High Thirty-Two Heavens Primordial Supreme Emperor’s august presence.

Then, drawing qi thirty-two times, face east and recite the scripture.

### First: The Sound of the Desire Realm Flying Through the Void

The human path is vast and distant. The immortal path is wild and vast. The ghost path is joyous, when entering the gate of birth. The immortal path values life. The ghost path values the end. The immortal path is always auspicious. The ghost path is always ominous. High Supreme Clarity numinous brightness, sorrowful songs resound through the vast emptiness. Only wishing the immortal path to succeed, not wishing the human path to fail. Northern Capital Spring Curve Mansion, within are myriad ghost hordes, only desiring to obstruct human calculations, severing human life gates. The Ah Ren Song cavernous chapter, to bind Northern Luo Feng, restraining and reciting evil demon spirits, cutting off six ghost blades. The heavens are vast and vast, my dao daily flourishes.

### Second: The Sound Chapter of the Form Realm Demon King

Lofty and grand, bright qi fourfold, Brahma practice of the heavens, circling the ten directions, innumerable great gods, all come from my body. I possess cavernous chapters, ten thousand times becoming immortal. The immortal path values salvation. The ghost path is connected. Heaven and earth vast and wild, defilements thick and dense. The Three Realms rejoice, passing on long existence. The body crosses my realm, the form enters nature. This moment is joyous, all by my grace. Dragon River vast and vast, how can one distinguish truth? My realm is hard to cross, thus I make cavernous writings, transforming and flying through the void, to test your body. Success or failure, laxity or retreat, how many are saved? Laughing at your failure to save, thus the song’s beginning.

### Third: The Demon King Song of the Form Realm

Above the Three Realms, vast Great Luo, above no color root, cloud layers towering. Only the Primordial exists, house of great kalpa, commanding my realm, governing the mysterious capital. Passing beyond my realm, penetrating Jade Void, my position is Supreme King, restraining myriad demons. Ten thousand transformations in the void, defilements like scattered blossoms, few protect truth, many are confused. The immortal path is hard to secure, the ghost path easy to corrupt. The human path is the heart, surely not by others. The immortal path values reality, the human path values splendor. You do not delight in the immortal path, how can the Three Realms be crossed? If desires turn the Five Paths, how shall I respond? This is above the Three Realms, the demon king’s song in the flying void, its sound referencing cavernous chapters. Recite it one hundred times, named salvation of the Southern Palace; one thousand times, demon king guards and welcomes; ten thousand times, the dao is complete, ascending the vast emptiness, crossing and saving the Three Realms, attaining the rank of Immortal Duke, hearing the numinous sound, demon king reveres form, commanding and restraining Earth, guarding and escorting, pulling open Earth’s gates, the Five Pains and Eight Hardships, seven ancestors ascending and transforming, forever leaving ghost officials, souls saved in the Vermilion Mound, receiving refinement and rebirth, this is called infinite, universally saving without end. There is a secret supreme heavenly text, revered by all heavens; leak it lightly and fall to hell, calamity reaching seven ancestors and elders.

The Dao speaks:

These two chapters are the hidden sounds of the celestial emperors and the numinous demon kings, all words of the great Brahma, not common worldly phrases, words without rhyme or beauty, tunes without ornament or grace, thus called profound and mysterious, hard to seek and explain. Treasured by Heaven, secret in the mysterious capital, Purple Tenuity Upper Palace, transmitted by mysterious methods every forty thousand kalpas; if there be a true person, fasting with gold and treasure, heart abiding by the ancient pattern, swearing covenant with the Ten Heavens, then it is entrusted.

The Dao speaks:

The operations and fate of Heaven and Earth also have their end and renewal; the sun, moon, and five stars also wax and wane; the most sacred divine beings also rest and cease; the last learners also suffer illness and injury. Wherever there is such calamity, all of the same breath should unite their hearts, cultivate fasting, perform incense offerings six times a day, recite the scripture ten times, and blessings and virtue will descend, dispelling all misfortune, infinite texts universally saving without end.

The Dao speaks:

If the last learners’ dao is shallow, or their immortal grade incomplete, when fate approaches extinction, the body passes through the Great Yin, at the time of passing, fellow learners and true persons come to perform incense offerings, recite scripture ten times, to save the corpse form according to law, soul and spirit directly ascend to the Southern Palace, following their cultivation merit, counting days to rebirth, the wheel turning unceasing, then attaining immortality.

The Dao speaks:

When Heaven and Earth’s operations end, one should also cultivate fasting, perform incense offerings and recite scripture; when stars and constellations err in their course, sun and moon lose their dusk, also cultivate fasting, incense, and scripture; when the four seasons lose their order, yin and yang unbalanced, also cultivate fasting, incense, and scripture; when the ruler suffers calamity, war and strife arise, also cultivate fasting, incense, and scripture; when pestilence spreads, people die and suffer, also cultivate fasting, incense, and scripture; when teachers and friends pass away, also cultivate fasting, incense, and scripture. Fasting, abstinence, and scripture recitation hold great merit, ascending to dispel heavenly disasters, protecting and stabilizing emperors and kings, warding off poisons and harms below, saving the multitudes, life and death rely on it, its blessings hard to surpass, thus called infinite, universally saving heavens and beings.

The Dao speaks:

Whoever possesses this scripture, can serve Heaven and Earth, emperors and kings, and the multitudes, performing these merits and virtues. On days of calamity, arise with heart to cultivate fasting, burn incense, recite scripture ten times; all heavens record the name, myriad gods attend and guard, the right separate true persons, able to become holy ministers of the Golden Pavilion. The heavens record one’s merits and faults, not missing a hair’s breadth; the demon kings of Heaven also protect and recommend your body to attain the dao—thus the profound supreme words.
