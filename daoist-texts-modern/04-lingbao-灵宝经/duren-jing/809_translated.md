## The Boundless Sounds of the Great Brahman Among the Celestial Hosts

### First Explanation: The Great Brahman Among the Celestial Hosts

The first topic concerns the “Great Brahman Among the Celestial Hosts.” There are thirty-two heavens, each with eight characters, arrayed across the eight directions within the celestial realms. The “Great Brahman” is the primordial breath (qi) of the Original Beginning’s Great Brahman, whose union of separation and union forms sound itself.

In ancient times, the Celestial True Sovereign inscribed this text, unfolding its profound chapters and extending its explanations through four principles:

1. To name things with Brahman sounds;  
2. To mark Brahman names with Brahman sounds;  
3. To regard one deity as two deities;  
4. To merge two matters into one.

For example, the Brahman sound “Tianlou” (Heavenly Tower) is not the sound of a tower or temple on earth, but now, following the earthly temples named “Louguan Yin,” it denotes the Tower Temple of the Mysterious Capital. Brahman sounds mark Brahman names, such as the Brahman sound naming the King of Heaven as “Yimiao,” which here still means “King” as “Yimiao.” One deity as two deities: “Xuyuan” was originally one deity, but now is understood as “Xuyuan” and “Yuanyin,” two titles. Two matters as one: “Brahman conduct” and “Great Brahman” were originally two matters, now combined as one Great Brahman. Other cases follow this pattern.

**Question:** The sounds of the Western Regions and India often match Brahman sounds, yet Chinese sounds differ. Why is this?  
**Answer:** Sounds are truly the original script’s sounds. The Dao transforms them through sound to influence those lands and through culture to transform here.  
**Further Question:** Sounds are speech; script is writing. Writing cannot express all speech, so writing is inferior?  
**Answer:** Not so. Writing’s limitation is worldly writing. True script is the root of the Three Powers; speech and teaching are at the end of dissemination. The root surpasses the end.

### Second Explanation: Hidden Speech

The second topic is “Hidden Speech.” The two characters “Hidden Speech” are Brahman sounds, differing from earthly sounds, with uses and disuses, thus giving rise to concealment and revelation.

“Hidden” means secret, not manifest outside. Within this too, there is concealment and revelation. Now, “Hidden Speech” has two meanings:

1. The script is Brahman writing, the sound Brahman sound, yet used according to earthly customs. Earthly sounds reveal the outside, Great Brahman sounds hide within. This thing covers Brahman sounds; Brahman sounds lie dormant, hidden inside. Hence it is called “Hidden Speech,” to clarify the matter of responding and transforming.

2. Now, one character contains many meanings. If one seeks meaning directly from one character, it cannot be seen. Without understanding the key, its essence is not revealed. Thus it is called “Hidden Speech,” to illuminate profound and mysterious principles.

Within Hidden Speech there are four kinds: hidden names, hidden taboos, hidden matters, hidden meanings. Why say “Hidden Speech” instead of names, taboos, matters, meanings? “Speech” means awakening. The character “吾” (I) means “my speech.” Using “my speech” to show speech, it opens the awakened heart. Thus it is called “speech.”

---

### Third Explanation: Boundless Sounds

The third topic is “Boundless Sounds,” which has two meanings:

1. Boundless transformation and communication;  
2. Boundless teaching and transformation.

Boundless transformation means: within the inner sound, the Celestial True Sovereign, although only interpreted as the correct Chinese sound, this sound’s use penetrates boundless lands and foreign regions, different places and peoples, each naming things and each understanding them. The sound communicates primordial measure, thus called “boundless.”

Boundless teaching means: since different places and peoples name their things, all form good speech, universally obtaining subtle meaning, without limit or end, without evil words, pervading boundlessly, with sounds complete in five scripts. Hence called “boundless sounds.”

## Explanation from the Dao Lord on the Middle Chapter of the Primordial Numinous Scripture

The above title comes from this middle chapter of the Numinous Scripture. This scripture has two hundred and fifty-six characters, each character one zhang square, eight-sided and brilliantly shining.

This middle chapter has three uses preserved:

1. To distribute the thirty-two heavens, each with eight characters, to avert misfortune and accomplish salvation for all;  
2. To record the Mysterious Capital and the palaces, gates, doors, towers, and temples of the celestial heavens. If one cultivates and serves these characters clearly, then according to one’s practice, riding the breath, one ascends to their place;  
3. To gather, summon, command, and restrain, governing the Ten Directions.

## Postscript: One Topic

This topic is the Dao Lord’s repeated preface to the scripture. It clarifies the beginning and end of hidden speech, the fruit of merit and achievement. One zhang is ten feet, encompassing the Ten Directions. Using “zhang” means length, the length of myriad virtues.

The “correct” sound is the Chinese sound. The Celestial True Sovereign once wrote this text as the correct sound, naming earthly things with Brahman sounds, still regarding them as the correct Chinese sounds. Discussing sounds in heaven, they are the correct sounds of heaven, named the Most High’s wondrous things, also universally used in other lands. They name foreign things, without partiality or obstruction. This is the same correct sound, only the names differ. Just as foreign lands use five tones and four tones, China also uses five tones and four tones, things named differently but sounds are the same. All myriad things are so.

The Celestial True Sovereign today’s explanation is only for China’s correct sound, not for borderlands or foreign realms. Within the correct sound, there are similarities and differences. Similarities: as heaven says “Ana,” this question also says “Ana,” no difference from foreign lands; calling “bo” as “bo,” “sulao” as “sulao,” here still naming. Differences: heaven calls bodhi “dao,” here called “upper truth.” Foreign lands name “wen” as Confucian; here plainly called “wen.” Though the sounds differ, all form good speech, not evil words, thus uniquely true, wondrous, boundless sounds.

Now using “bodhi” as “upper truth,” then “dao” sound hides, “wen” as “wen,” then Confucian sound disappears, thus called “hidden speech.” The celestial hosts are the numinous treasures, the great dao emperors and myriad saints. “Merit” means great merit turning; great means demon kings recommending. The superior immortal dao is complete, merits and conduct all around. Roaming the Three Realms means not dwelling in the Three Realms. The Golden Gate is the Golden Gate of the Nine Palaces of Great Mist, in the Western Pass division, the Great Element heaven, above the mysterious profound. Inside the gate is the Qian tree; above is the golden-winged bird; below is the refining pool; the pool has stone scenery, golden marrow, jade ointment. All students who become immortals ascend heaven and undergo corpse transformation, all pass through the Golden Gate for refinement; the golden-winged bird weaves its feathers into immortal robes to ascend the upper palace clouds.

### This Sound Is Nothing But the Most Profound Profundity

This is the old preface in the middle chapter of the Primordial Numinous Scripture, summarizing the great virtue of the previous hidden speech.

This text comes from inner sound, titled Great Brahman Hidden Speech Primordial Measure Sound. The scripture says this is called boundless, universally delivering endlessly, not “great measure.”
