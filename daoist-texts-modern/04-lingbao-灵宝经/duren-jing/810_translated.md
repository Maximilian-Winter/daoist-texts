## The Mysterious Profound Numinous Treasure Scripture of Boundless Salvation: Mantra and Pronunciation Guide

Whenever one holds the Supreme Most High Mysterious Profound Numinous Treasure Scripture of Boundless Ten Revered Volumes, one faces east and performs three bows; then faces north, stands, turns left, then turns east again, knocking the teeth thirty-six times to open the passage. One envisions the five-colored clouds filling the entire chamber, with the Azure Dragon and White Tiger, the Lion and Dark Warrior, the Vermilion Bird and Phoenix, all standing guard before and behind. The Jade Maidens and Immortal Youths, the Five Emperors’ Divine Officials, and the celestial armies numbering nine hundred million multitudes, all arrayed in defense on left and right. Then, one shakes the body three times and recites the scripture to completion. Afterwards, one bows facing south and lowers the lungs, performing the ritual as at the start.

This is excerpted from the Golden Record’s Brief Scripture Text.

Whenever one opens the numinous treasury and recites the scripture, one must burn incense, don complete ritual robes, perform the scripture ritual properly, and chant the incantation:

> Silent and utterly without origin,  
> The void stands like a kalpa’s blade.  
> The Mysterious Profound text bursts forth—  
> Who can fathom this remote and hidden place?  
>
> Entering the great vehicle’s path,  
> Who counts the years and kalpas?  
> Neither birth nor extinction,  
> Desire arises from the lotus blossom.  
>
> Surpassing the throngs of the Three Realms,  
> Compassion loosens the worldly net.  
> The perfected person holds supreme virtue,  
> Generation after generation becoming immortals.

This is excerpted from the Supreme Ultimate Jade Mantra. Holding the Scripture on the Birth Spirit follows the same incantation and method.

The *Most High Mysterious Profound Numinous Treasure Scripture of Boundless Salvation, Supreme Grade, Sublime Scripture* is the dual manifestation of human and Daoist methods, encompassing both the general and the particular. It is the supreme law king of the Most High generation, the Dao Lord’s proclaimed scripture and transformative masterwork. The Mysterious Profound Numinous Treasure is the collective title of the ten volumes; Boundless Salvation is the distinct axis of one volume. “Supreme” is a name of utmost grandeur. “Most High” is a title of ultimate exaltation. To be most high is to dwell without summit; to be supreme is to surpass all things. To reveal the noble virtue and precious worth of the sage’s body, to exhaust principle and fathom the subtle, to turn and return beyond calculation, beyond conception—thus it is called Most High.

“Mysterious” means to penetrate the void without obstruction, to be open and effortless, to survey the clear and distant, to manifest and extend far and wide. “Profound” means subtle, deep, and remote; wondrously silent and pure; principle reaching into the obscure, the hidden source vast and boundless. “Numinous” means refined and radiant, wisdom illuminating perfectly, responding to transformation and fulfilling nature’s needs, truly wise in all myriad workings. “Treasure” means precious, rare, outstanding, honored and glorified; when expressed in form, heaven and earth take shape; when lending qi, life and transformation are contained and nurtured.

“Boundless Salvation” means “boundless” in the sense of immeasurable number, “salvation” meaning to aid and ferry across, “man” as the category of beings. This is to ferry and save heaven and humans, infinitely countless. All who ascend and advance enter the wondrous gate, perfect the mind, and return to the formless.

“Supreme Grade Sublime Scripture” means this scripture begins without beginning, spoken first of all, placed above all other scriptures, the primordial ancestral constant and pure—thus called the Sublime Scripture.

Following this purpose, its meaning contains boundlessness, clarifying boundlessness, naturally possessing five meanings:

One, the body is boundless;  
Two, the virtue is boundless;  
Three, the power is boundless;  
Four, the ranks are boundless;  
Five, the sound is boundless.

Body boundless means the celestial honored ancestral source is ancient beyond knowing, originally unknowable. Sometimes the true and response bodies are two, the provisional and actual are two wisdoms. Hence the names Dragon Han, the Formless Sun, the title Kaihuang, and the designation Yuanshi. Teaching is set according to circumstances, giving medicine according to illness, responding fully without end. The primordial non-being is the first body and original measure.

Virtue boundless means the body dwells in primordial yang, serene and tranquil, mouth containing five colors, light illuminating the great thousandfold worlds, enabling those who receive the dharma pearl and hear the scripture of the Most High. This is the second boundless virtue.

Power boundless means the sage embraces sun and moon, determines yin and yang, turns mountains and stops streams, harmonizes qi sequences, commanding thousands of severed heads, subduing heretical demons, cutting off myriad forms, evil cannot disturb the right. This is the third boundless power.

Ranks boundless means that all mundane things have ranks and grades, high and low, few and many. Now the sage responds to things according to conditions, neither high nor low, following opportunity and convenience, neither less nor more. It is difficult to measure by high or low, or by few or many. Therefore, there are no ranks, ranks are boundless. This is the fourth original rank measure.

Sound boundless means the sage speaks with wordless speech, speech without end; sounds without voice, sounds without cessation, enabling beings through kalpas to awaken and understand, humans and heavens to hear clearly. Hence called the great Brahman secret speech, the boundless sound, also called the sound within heaven. This is the fifth boundless sound.

This is a brief outline; the meaning is thus.

## Preface to the Ten Volumes of the Mysterious Profound Numinous Treasure

The *Four Extremes Bright Ritual* says: Whenever reciting scripture, one must make heart and eyes correspond; the eyes must not look foolishly; the heart must not harbor strange thoughts. Always complete the reading of the scroll’s words and phrases; do not pause midway; do not skip the heavenly sounds. Three violations are utterly forbidden for immortals; five or more violations lead to death and filling the three paths of hell with five sufferings for ten thousand kalpas.

The *Hidden Notes* say: For every five hundred words read, knock the teeth three times, lick the upper and lower lips with the tongue, swallow saliva three times, so that one does not exhaust oneself and the voice becomes clear over time. Without this method, one damages qi and tires the spirit.

## Preface to the Inner Ritual and Mental Work of the Mysterious Profound Numinous Treasure

Among humans, many recite the *Mysterious Profound Numinous Treasure Scripture of Primordial Measure and Salvation*. Though there are incantation formulas, few understand the regulations. Now, it is fully explained so that one may understand.

From the title downward, it descends from the Primordial Yuanshi’s orthodox scripture. Since it is the Dao Lord’s own commendation, it should follow the ten volumes of the Mysterious Profound. To preserve and recall the inner sounds, one must follow this method.

Now it is fully listed as follows:

When reading the Dao words, next follow the text below, preserving thought and chanting the ministers and A and B. If for oneself, one should not say this; if for others, one should not say this; because the minister’s heart cannot encompass both. If for oneself and others, one should follow this text.

Upon completion, draw in qi thirty-two times, slowly drawing qi from the thirty-two heavens, then recite the scripture according to the method. This is the true method of the Primordial Yuanshi’s boundless salvation and preservation of thought.

In the Dao practice chapter, knock the teeth thirty-two times, hearing the thirty-two heavens above, the heart bows thirty-two times. One must secretly recite the names of the heavens by mouth, hear the heavens by heart, bow one by one in heart. The heart bows, though the body does not move, follows the heart’s bending and prostration as if in physical ritual. All must first be practiced thoroughly, knowing the location of the heavens, so that when the time comes, one is not late or out of order. All preservation of thought and chanting follows this method.

## Pronunciation Guide and Meaning

The ancient Most High Dao Lord composed the preface to this scripture; hence it is all called Dao words. The beginning is the northeast heaven of the Azure Heaven. Floating the sound of Li earth is “du.” The measure is “liang.” “Wu yang” is pronounced “yang,” meaning heaven’s boundary. “Yu bo” is like the character. The mute sound “yin” means illness not spoken, signifying yin. “Bo bo” is “fu,” meaning foot illness. “E” is “jiu,” meaning illness “a.” “Gu” is deep, indicating long illness and distance. “Fan fu” is “yuan.” “Bo bo” is “fu.” “Kuo san” is “si gan.” “Jian du” is “jian.” “Cu xi” is “zu gu.” “Shu” is “shu.” “Xua xu” is “xu.” “Zhong shang” is “zhong.” “Zeng zi” is “neng.” “@” is “ji.” The scripture’s beginning to teach is sometimes said to be from Yuanshi, which is mistaken. “Cang” is “si lang.” “Xuan ji” is “xuan” and “ji,” the first star of the Northern Dipper. “Bu xing” is “heng.” “Shi” sometimes means death. “Sang xi” is “yi.” “Wei” is not yet controlling heaven’s sentence end. “Yi” is “zeng.” “Shang” is “chang.” “Shi jie” means to release and conceal form, internal merchant body becoming immortal. “Chang yi” is “ying zhi.” “Duan di” is “tu guan.” “Chang” is “wei.” “Wei” is the emperor’s correct month position. “Weng ming” is “wu kong.” “Shi zhe” is “shi shi.” “Da fan” is the sun and moon above the eight heavens. “Miao miao” is “jie ren.” “San hua” is level tone. “Li bian” means convenient. “Sen” is “suo cen.” “Jing yi” is “hong.” “Da xing” is “heng.” “Du e” is “e.” “Can” is “can.” “Jian zhen” is “jian.” “Ying du” is “xiang.” “Yu lan” is “lan.” “Tian mo” is “tian.” “Huang jia” is “jia.” “Wan li” is “yuan.” “Huang jia” is “jia.” “Wan li” is “yuan.” “Huang jia” is “jia.” “Wan li” is “yuan.” “Huang jia” is “jia.” “Wan li” is “yuan.” “Huang jia” is “jia.” “Wan li” is “yuan.” “Huang jia” is “jia.” “Wan li” is “yuan.” “Huang jia” is “jia.” “Wan li” is “yuan.” “Huang jia” is “jia.” “Wan li” is “yuan.”

The scripture was received by the Most High Great Dao Lord from the Primordial Heavenly Honored One and transmitted to the world. The Dao Lord composed the front, middle, and rear prefaces, three in all. The front preface begins with the Dao words of facing east and reciting scripture; the middle preface begins after the song of the Three Realms; these two chapters are the clearest and most profound words. The rear preface begins from the midst of the heavens to the vast boundless profound words. The scripture has two chapters, from the Primordial Mysterious Profound to the listing of the Supreme Clarity; the latter chapter from the Primordial Cave Jade Calendar to the calamities and the seven ancestors. The great Brahman secret speech is not numbered as two chapters; some consider the scripture as chapters and the secret as two chapters, which is mistaken.

The middle preface says: Recite the scripture ten thousand times to attain the Dao. The Mysterious Profound words are secret and profound, not included in the two chapters of scripture text, as can be known.

Those who read and recite should have faith without doubt; when merit is full and the Dao complete, one will naturally understand thoroughly, humans and heavens sharing blessings, benefiting in life and death. Can one not be inspired? Can one not strive?

Records of numinous efficacy at the mysterious gate, collections of Daoist efficacy, holding this scripture brings recorded efficacy, all transmitted and preserved. Those who are true and complete, diligently practice it.
