## Preface to the Collected Commentaries on the Scripture of Salvation of Beings

Written by Master Chen Jingyuan, Registrar of the Right Street Daoist Records of the True Stillness

In the vast void, where floating light yet remains undivided, the Great Dao is about to transform; thus the profound script emerges in the central Heaven. The sudden condensation of emptiness and non-being forms a wondrous black knot in the azure expanse. The characters each measure one zhang wide, their force descending in eight-pointed rays, brilliant and dazzling, radiating resplendent light. At that time, the Primordial One descended to the Cypress Mound; the Five Elders surrounded him, seated upon clouds, swiftly commanding the Celestial True Beings to plan and bend the design, modeling images that surpass reality, composing secret writings of the heavens, compiling the spiritual patterns of the five directions. They recorded the vessel of the Primal Chaos and Dragon Han, concealed within the palace of Yuluo and Ziwei, unfolding into thirty-six revered scriptures, divided into twelve thousand celestial charts. The heavenly script, cloud seal, the book of the Eight Assemblies—all trace their origin here.

In ancient times, within the Primordial Azure Heaven and the precious pearl, the teachings of the Lingbao were expounded, rescuing the ranks of Heaven and Man. The Jade Morning Lord inscribed the beginning and end, secreted in the Upper Pavilion, to be transmitted once every forty thousand kalpas, vowing not to lightly reveal it in the lower world. Yet the Golden Mother of the Turtle Terrace, moved by the calamities of nine, one hundred, and six, personally visited the Jade Capital, earnestly petitioning for its dissemination. Then when the Yellow Emperor of Xuanyuan inquired of the Way beneath Mount Emei’s shade, he bowed to the Celestial True Beings, carrying forth the treasured instructions. Later, in Wu, the enigmatic Ge Xuan sought the Way in Kuaiji Commandery, prayed atop Mount Shangyu, encountered the emissary of the Great Ultimate’s proclamation, and received the volumes of the Lingbao scriptures—this became the Supreme Grade, the earliest to be transmitted.

Afterward, practitioners reciting and cultivating this scripture spread throughout the world, its hidden rhythms and secret sounds beyond the comprehension of the age. Yan Dong of Qi was the first to annotate and explain, looking upward to the revolving Brahmanic energy, gazing downward to the springs of Fengdu, distributing the various volumes, wrapping them in radiant brilliance. Without profound elucidation of subtlety, how could the doctrine’s purpose be clearly expressed? Thus, the wandering guest of the past pierced through blockages and opened the gaps, revealing insight according to nature. Then came the Tang Daoist Xue Youxi, who donned the robe of Qingcheng, nurtured truth at Mount Heng, truly understood the sequence and expounded clearly on preservation and cultivation. Following him were the Supreme Purity attendants Li Shaowei and Western Flower Dharma Master Cheng Xuanying, each composing commentaries and explanations, drawing upon inner sounds to fill in omissions and complete the doctrines, covering all matters thoroughly. Chen Jingyuan, a youth admiring the Way, studied the Jade Scripture, undeterred by obscurity, daring to compile and weave together. Now, from the four families’ teachings, duplicates have been removed, the secret meanings carefully selected, and compiled into four scrolls—thus sparing many confusions. Written in the fourth year of Zhiping, in the year of Dingwei, on the full moon of mid-autumn.

The Dao says:

Youxi said: The “Supreme” is the name of the utmost greatness; “Upper” is the title of reverence. “Profound” means penetration; “Mysterious” means subtlety. “Spiritual” is sacred transformation; “Treasure” is precious esteem. “Infinite” means countless; “Salvation of Beings” means from the mundane to the sage. To clarify this scripture, open the path to ascendancy and immortality without restriction. The *Dongxuan Lingbao* is the name of the rank; *Infinite Salvation of Beings* is the title of one scroll. Since the rank is high and honored, it is called “Upper Grade”; since its function is subtle and wondrous, it is called “Wondrous Scripture.”

Shaowei said: “Supreme” is the ultimate realm of the Dao. “Profound and Mysterious” is the wisdom that penetrates it. The august Primordial One, honored above myriad emperors, vast and boundless beyond measure, transcending the Three Heavens. Having arrived, vast without outside, lofty beyond reckoning. Hence it is called Supreme, Profound, and Mysterious. Seeking the subtle and probing the bright, hooking the deep and reaching afar, penetrating the ultimate principles of Heaven and Earth, exploring the wondrous numbers of myriad things—thus it is called Profound and Mysterious. Transformations without pattern are called spiritual; reverence and preciousness are called treasure. The true script flourishes, the Five Emperors pay homage to the imperial pavilion, jade characters extend rays, the celestial patterns of the heavens. Thus the scripture was engraved on golden slips and circulated. The treasured spiritual script is called Lingbao. The Primordial Heavenly Venerable manifests according to kalpa, journeys through the Three Realms, issues the method to save beings, attains the Dao and becomes true, like rain and mist, immeasurable in count—thus called Infinite Salvation of Beings. The scriptures of the Three Caverns and the essential hymns of the Lingbao, all their功行 begin with salvation, forming the ladder to true position, the root of seed people—thus called the Supreme Grade Wondrous Scripture.

The Dao says:

Youxi said: This is the speech of the Supreme Jade Morning High Sage Great Dao Lord. The Dao Lord is the disciple of the Primordial Heavenly Venerable and the master of the Taiwei Heavenly Emperor. Residing in the Upper Purity Upper Origin Jade Morning Office, the realm of Upper Purity, the honored position of Supreme Purity. Having received this scripture, he composed its preface, thus marking its beginning.

Xuanying said: According to the *Benxing Jing*, the Dao Lord is a person from the Western Na Jade Country. The Purple Morning flows with fragrance, a descendant of the august sovereign, able to reverently inherit the Lingbao Primordial, enfeoffed as the Heavenly Emperor of Yuyue Nalinchang Yutai. His position reaches the High Sage, governing the Mysterious Capital. The *Yujing Great Cavern Scripture* says: The Upper Purity High Sage Great Dao Lord is also called Jade Morning Lord, governing the Medicine Pearl Jade Pavilion Seven Ying Purple Chamber, serving the Void Emperor. The Void Emperor is the Primordial Heavenly Venerable.

In ancient times, within the Primordial Azure Heaven, in the blue expanse, the great floating Li land sang in emptiness, receiving the Primordial Infinite Salvation of Beings Supreme Grade.

Youxi said: “Ancient” means past. The Primordial Azure Heaven is the Eastern Nine Qi Azure Heaven, above the Yuanluo, emerging beyond the Eastern Pole. “Primordial” is the name of the five directions’ beginning; “Azure” is the color of the Eastern Nine Qi. Hence the true script calls it Eastern Nine Qi Primordial Azure Heaven. With the sky blue and qi azure, the blue mists spread wide, thus called Blue Expanse. The spiritual phoenix and jade trees, drums and songs in the void, thus called Void Song. The Great Floating Li Land is the name of the Floating Li Great Country. The Dao Lord said: I formerly, in this heavenly country, received the Primordial Infinite Salvation of Beings scripture.

Shaowei said: The Primordial Azure Heaven is the Northeast Yulong Heaven. This heaven is veiled in blue mists, spiritual music and divine winds, purple characters ringing in the forest, naturally forming songs. This country’s land’s emperor is the Floating Li Heavenly Venerable, descending to the Ten Directions, gathering at the time of salvation, receiving this scripture. The *Ling Shu* says: The Eastern Pole Great Floating Li Country’s land is all green jade, always producing blue mists. There are also blue forest trees whose leaves naturally bear purple script. When the wind blows the trees, the sounds form wondrous chapters, brilliant and dazzling, resonating through the vast sky, hence called Blue Expanse Void Song.

Xuanying said: The Great Floating Li Land is a name meaning vast and broad; Floating Li is its emperor’s name; land means the country’s territory.

The Primordial Heavenly Venerable was about to speak this scripture, circling ten times to summon the Ten Directions. Then he was to take his seat.

Youxi said: “Primordial” means origin; “Beginning” means first. The Primordial Heavenly Venerable established the beginning of myriad transformations, the head of all ways, residing in the Upper Purity Upper Origin realm, governing the domain of the Great Luo Mysterious Capital. He planted the root of Heaven and Earth, gave birth to the mother of myriad things. Desiring to transmit the scripture and expound the Dharma, he first summoned the Ten Directions’ Celestial True Beings, each circling once, ten times in total, different from the ten times circling the Ten Directions. After the summoning, he then ascended and took his seat.

Shaowei said: The Primordial Heavenly Venerable is the Void Emperor’s responsive title. From the true origin, he is called: the Perfected Cultivator. His subtle thought and profound source are uniquely his own nature. Hence the *Dongshen Jing* says: The wondrous image is formless; the response and manifestation have form. The true essence’s qi transforms into form. At that time, he circled the scripture ten times; the Ten Directions gathered without distance, all responded and came to his seat. “To come” means “to go to.”

The Celestial True Great Gods, High Sages, Perfected Ones of Wondrous Practice, and countless innumerable beings came riding the void.

Shaowei said: “Yang” means to stop. The true holy and venerable gods and their retinues overflow, a thousand chariots, ten thousand riders, all the heavens gather. By this measure, how innumerable are they?

Flying clouds and cinnabar sky, green chariots and jade wheels, feathered canopies shading, flowing essence and jade light, five colors flourishing, brilliantly illuminating the vast sky.

Youxi said: “Yang” means center; the ancient character sometimes uses “yang” to mean center. Center means fullness, completion. Thus “innumerable beings” still preserve thought. Shaowei said: From the Primordial Profound below is the scripture. They are immeasurable, all shaded by feathered canopies, riding green chariots, flying clouds in cinnabar skies, holding jade hubs, the Celestial True Beings all gathered, the High Sages united, radiating essence and shining jade light in the void. Flowing essence means the five-colored flowing essence within the jade light. Jade light means the perfected one’s body light. The vast sky is above Supreme Purity. Shaowei said: Flying clouds and cinnabar sky form garments; green chariots and jade wheels are the carriages and mounts, all brilliant with essence light, colorful and radiant, the heavenly robes of the Venerable. The *Ke* says: From Brahma and above, flying clouds and flowing skies naturally form wondrous qi garments.

Xuanying said: “Chariot” means the carriage’s compartment. They wear flowing clouds as clothes, ride green chariots, with phoenix feathers as canopy covers, accompanied by nine-colored dragons and phoenixes, shading and reflecting each other, hence “feathered canopies shading,” “flowing essence and jade light,” “carriage robes resplendent,” “five colors.” The five colors flourishing is called “luxuriant.” A hundred million chariots and ten thousand riders float in the void, filling the vast emptiness, all going to Floating Li to listen to the Dharma, hence “illuminating the vast sky.”

Seven days and seven nights, the heavens’ sun, moon, stars, the Northern Dipper and Jade Balance, all paused their wheels. Divine winds were still and silent, mountains and seas concealed clouds, the sky was clear without floating shadows, the four qi were bright and pure.

Youxi said: The “heavens” means the thirty-two heavens. Each heaven has its sun and moon; their essence and light are the root of this realm. The Northern Dipper and Jade Balance are the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper. The four qi bright and pure are the qi of Heaven, Earth, Sun, and Moon. The true transmitters of truth, the sages who transmit sages, thus obtain the three lights’ breath and wheels to pause and shine; mountains and seas absorb qi and swallow smoke; the Wind Elder dares not sound his pipes; clouds arrange without shadow or shade. Thus Heaven and Earth are bright and clear, the sun and moon shining, seven days and seven nights, the Dharma ceremony is about to conclude. Since the wheels pause, how can there be night? It is measured by normal time, the span of seven days and seven nights.

Shaowei said: These three are heavenly auspices. The *Tianwen Zhi* says: The Northern Dipper’s Seven Stars are called the Jade Balance and the Northern Dipper. The four stars of Kui are the Jade Balance; the three stars of the ladle are the Jade Balance. The sun, moon, stars, and celestial palaces listen to the Dharma, so the wheels pause.

One country’s land, mountains, rivers, forests, and trees, all level and equal, no high or low, the earth all made of green jade, no different colors.

Youxi said: One country means the great country of Floating Li. The mountains have tall forests and jade trees; rivers have divine streams and spiritual springs; all level and even, no high or low opposing. Since all the earth is green jade, how could there be mixed colors? This is the divine transformation and spiritual change of the time, naturally causing the sun and moon to pause their wheels, the mountains and rivers to be level.

Shaowei said: These two are the earth’s response. Mountains, rivers, and earth dwellings are the earth’s residence; responding to emptiness, they transform into green jade.

The assembly of Celestial True Beings sat; the Primordial Heavenly Venerable sat mysteriously floating atop a five-colored lion.

Youxi said: The lion is in the void; the mysterious seat is placed atop the lion. The lion is king among beasts, subduing all others; one roar and all evil spirits submit. The Heavenly Venerable’s divine virtue subdues demons, again seated upon the lion’s throne. The Venerable ascends and speaks the scripture; the Celestial True Beings array themselves to listen.

Shaowei said: This is the Heavenly Venerable’s Daoist appearance.

After one reading of the scripture, all the great saints of the heavens simultaneously praised “Excellent!” At that time, the deaf and sick in the country, men and women alike, all had their ears opened and made clear.

Youxi said: At first hearing the Heavenly Venerable’s spiritual voice, the profound principles of the utmost sage were revealed, hence all voices united in praise, “Greatest goodness!” Thus in the great country of Floating Li, men and women, hearing it, the deaf and sick all became clear—this is the proof of one reading.

Xuanying said: At that time, men and women in the country listening to the Dharma, hearing the scripture once, their ears heard and their hearts understood, called “opening the ears.” The country here means the body. Hearing the Dharma is awakening, entering the heart palace, thus opening the ears.

After two readings, the blind regained sight.

Youxi said: First the ears heard the wondrous meaning; next the eyes beheld the Heavenly Venerable—this is the proof of two readings.

Xuanying said: After two readings, one gradually recognizes the characters; thus “eyes open.” If considered attentively, this is not a physical illness.

After three readings, the mute could speak.

Youxi said: Having the eyes behold the holy form, the mouth could then speak the scripture—this is the proof of three readings.

Xuanying said: After three readings, the heart’s understanding and comprehension allow one to transmit and speak the wondrous Dharma; hence “able to speak.”

After four readings, the lame, sick, and accumulated illnesses all could rise and walk.

Youxi said: Having the mouth able to speak the scripture, the feet could then walk the Way—this is the proof of four readings.

Xuanying said: Though after three readings one could speak, not yet fully understanding the truth, only after four readings does one seek teachers and inquire of meaning; hence “able to walk.” Accumulated illnesses are those passed down through generations, transmitted and linked.

After five readings, long-term chronic illnesses were instantly restored.

Youxi said: Having the whole body cultivated, then the entire form could be refined—this is the proof of five readings.

Xuanying said: After five readings, the heart fully understands,功 grows and blessings nourish, able to eliminate long-term chronic illnesses, instantly restoring the form, as if never ill.

After six readings, white hair turned black again, lost teeth regrew.

Youxi said: Having the whole body cultivated, the body was covered by true efficacy—this is the proof of six readings.

Xuanying said: After six readings,功 is abundant and blessings deep, able to turn white hair black again, lost teeth regrow.

After seven readings, the elderly became strong again, the young all robust.

Youxi said: First showing spiritual efficacy from the beginning, then the whole body bathed in holy grace—this is the proof of seven readings.

Xuanying said: After seven readings, the elderly become young again; the strong and young become even healthier and stronger.

After eight readings, pregnant women, birds, and beasts carrying offspring, both born and unborn, all obtained generation.

Youxi said: Those already born returned to youth and reversed aging; those unborn obtained birth—this is the proof of eight readings.

Xuanying said: Seven readings include the seven consciousnesses, transforming and benefiting the three talents; eight readings nourish the four births, containing spirit and bestowing celebration. Those born of womb do not perish; those born of eggs do not fail; all receive nurturing—hence “all obtain generation.”

After nine readings, the earth treasury manifested, gold and jade revealed their forms.

Youxi said: Having obtained the life of nature, again sensing the earth treasury’s opening and revelation, the country’s people all gained treasures of gold and jade—this is the proof of nine readings.

Xuanying said: Previously explained the transformation of the four births; this is the secret sensing of celebration. Manifesting the earth treasury, revealing forms of gold and jade; filling mountains and rivers, people gain sufficient use—hence “gold and jade reveal form.”

After ten readings, dry bones came to life, all rose as adults.

Youxi said: Having obtained the secret treasured, next transforming rotten decay into miraculous power—this is the proof of ten readings.

Xuanying said: After nine readings connecting to the earth, ten readings then affect the heavens; thus obtaining the Taiyi returning skeletal spirit talisman, raising the dead, dry bones, and again rising as adults.

At that time, in one country, men and women alike, all wholeheartedly received protection and salvation, all attained longevity.

Youxi said: At this time, in the country of Floating Li, men and women, neither old nor young, all received holy grace, universally obtaining salvation. The living do not die; the dead are reborn—thus all attain longevity.

Xuanying said: “Wholehearted” means completely. When the Heavenly Venerable spoke the scripture, all men and women of Floating Li sat beside him, hearing the wondrous Dharma, each fully attentive—thus “none do not wholeheartedly listen.” The people of one country receive this wondrous method of salvation, thus “all receive protection and salvation.” Those who attain the Dao of true reality are said to “all obtain longevity.” Among all heavenly beings, diseases vary in severity; the method of cultivation depends on功 depth. If the illness is light, fewer readings suffice; if heavy, more功 are needed to heal. Thus knowing that reciting the scripture ten times reaches the heavens, raises the dead, and grants longevity.

Shaowei said: When the dragon and tiger roar, wind and clouds arise; when sages act, the three talents respond. This is the natural number, the destined symbol. Thus ten readings of the scripture cure a hundred illnesses. If not the great saint Primordial One, who else can compare? Yet the old school’s method regards mind and intelligence as illness, not the body—this is a grave error.

Some say: According to the four heavens of seed people, severing all habitual attachments, all people are spiritual and clear, not receiving birth. Today the Venerable speaks the scripture in the Blue Expanse, the third heaven of seed people. Why then does one country’s diseases resemble the common world? Now we do not accept this, but by the power of authority, the “one country” means the realm under control. If lords regard their domain as a country, emperors regard the four seas as their country, and the thirty-two emperors each govern thirty-two heavens as their country; then the Venerable’s dao is all-encompassing, transformation everywhere. Thus the eight-circled world is one country. If so, who is not the Venerable’s country? Men and women have diseases; why be surprised? The *Kongdong Lingzhang* says: Wind moves the eight circles, returning floating brightness, clear and vast. The old saying is: The eight directions, the heavens, are called the eight circles. The Mysterious Capital is the central palace; each direction has five hundred million five hundred fifty-five thousand five hundred fifty-five layers. Such multitudes of heavens are the realm of one transformation by the Primordial One.

The Dao says: At that time, the Primordial Heavenly Venerable spoke the scripture once; the Eastern Infinite, Infinite Grade Supreme True Great Gods, innumerable in number, floated forth.

Youxi said: That time means the beginning of the scripture’s first reading. At the first reading, the Eastern host poured forth like a city. Since ranks and grades vary, many levels exist; thus it is called Infinite and Infinite Grade. Like dust in a crack, uncountable; thus innumerable in number. All ride the void, driving the floating chariots from the void. “Yang” means center, as explained above. This is the first reading, when the deaf and sick have their ears opened and cleared.

Xuanying said: This passage repeats the Venerable’s circling reading to summon the Ten Directions. The previous text summoned the Ten Directions generally, not specifying which directions. This passage reemphasizes so that students deeply understand the Venerable’s summoning of the heavens is not random. Thus at the first reading, the Eastern Infinite Infinite Grade Supreme True Great Gods, innumerable in number, float forth. “Yang” means stop. The true holy heart has no fixed attachment; upon sensing, it responds. Hearing the scripture once, the summoned hosts are vast, reaching the infinite. The true holy is limitless; thus all come to witness the Dharma and receive salvation.

The scripture’s second reading summons the Southern Infinite Infinite Grade Supreme True Great Gods, innumerable in number, floating forth.

Youxi said: All meanings of the Ten Directions are the same as the first reading’s second reading, when the blind regain sight.

The third reading summons the Western Infinite Infinite Grade Supreme True Great Gods, innumerable in number, floating forth.

Youxi said: This is the first reading’s third reading, when the mute can speak.

The fourth reading summons the Northern Infinite Infinite Grade Supreme True Great Gods, innumerable in number, floating forth.

Youxi said: This is the first reading’s fourth reading, when the lame, sick, and accumulated illnesses all can rise and walk.

The fifth reading summons the Northeastern Infinite Infinite Grade Supreme True Great Gods, innumerable in number, floating forth.

Youxi said: This is the first reading’s fifth reading, when long-term chronic illnesses are instantly restored.

The sixth reading summons the Southeastern Infinite Infinite Grade Supreme True Great Gods, innumerable in number, floating forth.

Youxi said: This is the first reading’s sixth reading, when white hair turns black again, lost teeth regrow.

The seventh reading summons the Southwestern Infinite Infinite Grade Supreme True Great Gods, innumerable in number, floating forth.

Youxi said: This is the first reading’s seventh reading, when the elderly become strong again, the young all robust.

The eighth reading summons the Northwestern Infinite Infinite Grade Supreme True Great Gods, innumerable in number, floating forth.

Youxi said: This is the first reading’s eighth reading, when pregnant women, birds, and beasts carrying offspring, both born and unborn, all obtain generation.

The ninth reading summons the Upper Infinite Infinite Grade Supreme True Great Gods, innumerable in number, floating forth.

Youxi said: This is the first reading’s ninth reading, when the earth treasury manifests, gold and jade reveal their forms.

The tenth reading summons the Lower Infinite Infinite Grade Supreme True Great Gods, innumerable in number, floating forth.

Youxi said: This is the first reading’s tenth reading, when dry bones come to life, all rise as adults.

Youxi said: One reading summons one direction; after ten readings, all ten directions come, that is, the thirty-two heavens and the four poles above and below, called the Ten Directions.

Shaowei said: This again sequences the circling reading to summon the Ten Directions. The Venerable is most divine; to carefully and respectfully read the scripture ten times to summon the Ten Directions is necessary to awaken understanding.

One country’s men and women wholeheartedly revere; those who come are like fine rain and dense mist, innumerable in number, filling half the country; the earth is uneven, not to be stopped.

Youxi said: “Zhe” means full and overflowing. Repeating that the country’s people return their hearts to the spiritual pattern, turning to true transformation, coming like fine rain flying in the void, gathering like dense mist converging. Being full and widespread causes the ranks to sink unevenly; this only shows the great number at the time. Reasoning says it should not be uneven; gentle and following the wind, how can it be stopped? Thus the sage has no mind, allowing things to follow their nature.

Shaowei said: This country is the great country of Floating Li. “Zhe country half” means the gathering place occupies half the country’s territory. “Zhe” means to occupy.

Then the Primordial One suspended a precious pearl, as large as a millet grain, in the mysterious void, five zhang above the earth. The Primordial ascended, leading the Celestial True Great Gods, High Sages, Perfected Ones of Wondrous Practice, the Ten Directions’ Infinite Supreme True Great Gods, innumerable in number, all entering the pearl.

Youxi said: The precious pearl symbolizes the Dao. Suspended in the mysterious void, it is like the mysterious pearl’s meaning. As large as millet, the first of grains, the root of human life. To receive the scripture is like receiving the life’s essence grain. To enter the pearl to transmit the Lingbao scripture is a treasure within treasure, mystery within mystery; truth within truth, Dao within Dao. Then leading the hosts of the Ten Directions, gathering into one pearl. This shows the divine transformation without form, beyond physical measure. Five zhang above the earth means to leave the five turbidities of the world, escape the use of the Five Phases. Once the five turbidities are left, no more calamities; once the Five Phases are unused, forever free from mutual cutting and the breath of change. Thus the Five Phases do not cut each other; all things can be preserved; naturally long life and longevity, attaining the Dao and becoming true.

The heavenly beings looked up, only seeing a vast multitude entering the pearl’s mouth.

Xuanying said: “Bobo” means countless multitudes, like rain and mist, entering the pearl’s mouth, also showing the true wisdom’s infinity.

Having entered the pearl’s mouth, their location was unknown. The country’s people dispersed, the earth returned to levelness, no longer tilted.

Youxi said: The heavenly beings are those in the Primordial Azure Heaven. The country’s people are those of the great country of Floating Li. Since they are not Celestial True Great Gods or High Sages, they do not follow into the pearl’s mouth. This example shows they do not join the grand event of supervision and salvation. So below they only look up, seeing only the vast multitudes entering, entering without obstruction. The pearl’s smallness cannot prevent many people. Small and large accommodate each other, so their location is unknown. Previously said “tilted,” now “tilted” means leaning. High places lean low; initially blocking half the country, seeming tilted; once dispersed, it returns to levelness.

Shaowei said: The old saying uses the pearl to symbolize the pure void’s perfect body; millet symbolizes the fragrant grain’s chief. Accommodating people into the pearl shows the wondrous Dao’s inclusiveness; residing in the void, not burdened by existence; five zhang above the earth means leaving the five desires. The earth returns level, showing the Great Dao’s evenness; the pearl’s tilt shows the true nature’s restoration. All this is reading beyond the text, fabricating heresy, shocking common sense, claiming no such thing. Let us reason: The Primordial One opens the chart; the Dharma and teaching are not one. Sometimes non-action and stillness show things returning to the root; sometimes transformations and power awe and subdue people. Divine power is free; true responses are infinite. If the pearl accommodates heavenly beings, why not? Even minor immortals hide and appear in a bottle; how could the Great Sage obstruct hiding in a pearl?

The Primordial One then, inside the pearl, completed the scripture’s recitation.

Xuanying said: “Completion” means finished, done. The one who attains the Dao has ascended into the pearl’s mystery. The Heavenly Venerable finished speaking the scripture, then inside the pearl transmitted this true scripture to the Supreme Dao Lord, as follows.

The assembly of Celestial True Beings supervised and transmitted it to me.

Xuanying said: This shows the Dao Lord receiving the scripture. The assembly of Celestial True Beings are the officials supervising salvation. After the Primordial One finished speaking, he ordered these supervising beings to transmit the scripture to the Dao Lord, who received it—thus “transmitted to me.”

At that time, joy and celebration were beyond words; the Dharma ceremony was roughly complete; the heavens returned to their seats.

Xuanying said: The Dao Lord self-claimed to have received the true scripture and roughly understood it. Since the Dharma ceremony was understood, the heavenly hosts and saints returned to their original positions, resuming their usual places.

In a flash, silence reigned with no lingering sound.

Youxi said: “I” means the Dao Lord self-claimed. Having transmitted the treasure inside the pearl, the saints conferred truth, a thousand truths jointly supervising, ten thousand saints together saving. The celebration of this assembly is beyond words. The Dharma ceremony completed, the heavenly assembly about to disperse, at the moment of joy, deep silence without sound.

Shaowei said: The sage has no mind; true responses arise with the moment; when conditions cease, they stop.

At that time, the heavenly beings encountered the scripture’s Dharma, universally obtaining salvation, completing their lifespan.

Xuanying said: Having heard this wondrous scripture, the great assembly all received salvation, preserving their blessings, thus completing their natural lifespan.

No harm befell them; the whole country wholeheartedly revered, all practiced kindness.

Youxi said: At that time, the heavenly beings and country’s people, men and women alike, hearing the scripture and seeing the Dharma, none but exhausted their sincere hearts, crossing streams of calamity without premature death. The three karmas were quieted; the six roots did not arise; all evils vanished; myriad virtues arose together.

No killing or harming; no jealousy or envy; no sexual misconduct or theft; no greed or desire; no hatred or slander; words without flowery decoration, mouths without evil sounds.

Youxi said: “No killing or harming” means eliminating bodily karma sins; “no jealousy or envy” means eliminating mental karma sins; “no sexual misconduct or theft” means eliminating bodily karma sins; “no greed or desire” means eliminating mental karma sins; “no hatred or slander” means further eliminating mental karma sins. “Flowery decoration” means false and vain words; “evil sounds” means foul curses and poisonous speech. All these twelve evil acts are cast away, then great harmony arises.

Equal in compassion, different bones become kin.

Xuanying said: When all ten evils do not arise, actions accord with the true constant principle; thus equal compassion arises, different bones become kin. The ancients did not only cherish their own parents or children; Yao and Shun’s abdication united the world’s hearts; how much more when the Heavenly Venerable speaks the scripture, one country reveres him, naturally different bones become kin.

The country is peaceful and the people abundant, rejoicing in great peace.

Youxi said: Equal compassion is like one class; myriad things are like one. They preserve the country’s abundance and rejoice in lasting peace.

Shaowei said: Cutting off life is killing; injuring is harming. Envying others is jealousy; hating equals envy. Men and women not interacting with propriety is sexual misconduct; stealing is theft; insatiability is greed; craving is desire; hating others is hatred; suspicion is slander. Different bones become kin; myriad actions harmonize, so voices have no discord. Naturally no epidemics arise; people have no premature death; years’ grains mature; the country is peaceful and prosperous.

Xuanying said: Equal compassion means the country must be peaceful. No harm within, people naturally have abundance. The five grains mature; disasters do not arise. With these many virtues’功, thus joy in peace.

The scripture first issued its teaching; one country, by the Dao, with utmost sincerity, reverently worshiping, all obtain salvation.

Youxi said: Then the Primordial Heavenly Venerable saw the country’s faith and goodness, issued the true pattern to guide them. If one cultivates with utmost sincerity, surely one ascends and saves the world.

Shaowei said: This means one region transforms and all regions benefit; nearby people follow, distant people submit.

The Dao says: The Primordial Heavenly Venerable spoke in the scripture,

Xuanying said: This refers to the mixed void red script and the primordial void jade calendar, called the *Lingbao Original Chapter*.

They are the inner names and secret sounds of the various heavenly emperors,

Youxi said: The scripture’s words refer to the thirty-two heavens’ secret names, the thirty-two heavenly emperors’ inner titles—all Brahmanic words, not casually to be questioned, hence called secret sounds.

They are also the inner names of the demon kings, the secret names of the myriad spirits, not common worldly words.

Youxi said: The demon kings’ inner names are the five emperors’ great demons’ secret characters. The myriad spirits’ secret names are the names of Wuying and Baiyuan. Since all are secret names and inner titles, they are not common worldly words.

The Supreme Sage has already become a true person, penetrating the profound and investigating the subtle, able to fully understand its chapters.

Shaowei said: The *Zilin* says: “Fully” means thoroughly.

Youxi said: Since the inner names are secret sounds, not common worldly words, only among true persons with the talent to penetrate the profound and the insight to investigate the subtle can one understand its meaning.

Reciting it ten times, the heavens sing from afar, myriad emperors set up rites, rivers and seas are still, mountains and peaks conceal clouds, the sun and moon stop their light, the Northern Dipper ceases to move.

Youxi said: When the Supreme Sage has become a true person, penetrating the profound and investigating the subtle, reciting it ten times, then the Dao accords with the heavens. Thus voices sing together from afar; virtue equals myriad emperors, so rites are set and guests arrive. Rivers and seas cease their waves; mountains and peaks gather clouds and smoke without rising; the three lights pause their rays; the seven luminaries condense their brilliance; Heaven and Earth are pure and bright, illuminating day and night.

The demons bind their forms, spirits vanish, corpses return to life, white bones become human.

Youxi said: When the true Dao proceeds smoothly, evil demons vanish; thus decayed corpses return to transcendence, white bones regain flesh and soul. Since the dead can be reborn, the living should not die—this is the true person’s pattern.

Those who study deeply, reciting it ten times, the five emperors guard, the Three Realms bow, demon spirits lose their eyes. Ghosts and demons vanish, salvation descends on the dying, they cut off and gain life.

Youxi said: The deep student is one whose heart is firm as iron and stone, whose will is fierce as water and fire, whom Heaven and Earth cannot surpass, ghosts and gods cannot confuse, who can do what others cannot, seeming to have and yet not have. Thus above the Great Ultimate, those with true names, reciting it ten times, have the five emperors escorting on left and right, the Three Realms bowing and paying respects, evil demons losing their eyes, the dying naturally gaining life. The five emperors are the five directions’ heavenly emperors; the Three Realms are the Three Realms’ demon kings.

Shaowei said: The Supreme Sage’s great Dao has power to control Heaven; the deep student’s power is slight, able only to control Earth. Controlling Heaven can pause the three luminaries’ wheels, restore white bones to life; controlling Earth can make the Three Realms bow, the dying regain life. The boundary between great and small cannot be crossed.

Because the student’s defiled qi is not yet eliminated, the body not yet penetrated true reality, summoning and controlling the Ten Directions, the power has not subdued Heaven’s governance.

Shaowei said: Heaven’s governance means the sun, moon, and five stars, the seven heavenly officials.

Virtue can subdue and control only Earth, binding demon spirits, but only repelling death, unable to restore life.

Youxi said: That is so. The deep student has name and conduct established in true pattern,功 and use still slight, so cannot summon and control the Ten Directions, the heavens cannot be stirred to power. They can only subdue evil demons, repel death, but cannot restore decayed bones to flesh and life—this is the pattern of the deep student.

Shaowei said: The student is the highest deep student. Divine power not vast,功 incomplete, cannot control heavenly phenomena, only able to subdue earthly spirits. Power can repel death, but not restore bones.

Lightly reciting this chapter brings disaster upon the body.

Shaowei said: The five emperors’ powerful gods guard the *Lingbao*, inspecting for lightness and neglect—truly dangerous.

Reverently serve and honor, the gate prospers, generations flourish, with good causes, ten thousand calamities do not harm, divine beings protect the gate.

Youxi said: “Lightly reciting” means not properly cleaning body and clothes, not following ritual procedures; or reciting carelessly while walking, standing, sitting, or lying down. Not only does one’s own body suffer trial, but also ancestors above. If only reverently honoring and worshiping, then the gate prospers, one’s body receives blessing, descendants flourish, evil roots do not arise, always meeting good. With a thousand gods protecting, what ten thousand calamities can harm? Thus reciting without savoring is worse than not reciting but revering. Those who hold the scripture should examine carefully.

This scripture is honored and wondrous, uniquely walking the Jade Capital.

Shaowei said: Only by this wondrous Dao can one fly to the Jade Capital. The *Benxiang Jing* says: Above the Great Luo Heaven is the Jade Capital Mountain, born without root, resting in the void. Within are the Purple Tenuity Upper Palace, spanning three hundred thousand li. Golden towers and jade terraces, adorned with seven treasures. Above the jade chamber are thirty-six places, eight thousand li in circumference, with true script large characters filling it.

Salvation of beings infinite, the ancestor of myriad ways, majestic great pattern, virtue hard to surpass.

Shaowei said: The *Erya* says: “Pattern” means law. Since it is revered by the heavens, not transmitted to the lower world, residing in the Purple Tenuity’s secret treasury, in the Mysterious Capital’s special use; it is the supreme salvation, marking the head of all ways. The majestic holy pattern is like Kunlun’s crown in the firmament; the measure of virtue is hard to surpass, as vast as the unfathomable ocean. This is the wondrous Dao.

The Dao says: Whoever recites this scripture ten times, the heavens all arrive. Hundreds of millions of ancestors, ethereal and corporeal souls, all immediately receive salvation, ascending to the Vermilion Palace.

Youxi said: This means whoever recites, regardless of rank, able to faithfully recite ten times, then the heavenly hosts and saints descend to the temple, broadcasting the ancestors’ ethereal souls and the suffering spirits of the clan. Descending from the Northern Mansion, ascending to the Southern Palace. The Vermilion Palace is the Southern Palace.

The pattern is nine years; receiving transformation and rebirth, becoming noble persons. Those who love study and reach the scripture,功 full and virtue complete, all become immortals, ascending the Golden Pavilion, roaming the Jade Capital.

Youxi said: The pattern of nine years means the nine-year pattern, the number of the three fires, three threes make nine. The Vermilion Palace is the southern direction, belonging to fire. Using fire to refine the form, hence three fires. After nine years of refining and transformation, one is reborn noble. Once born, one cultivates this scripture; past practice remains;功 of ten thousand turns fulfilled; virtue of three thousand complete; then transcending, ascending, attaining immortality; entering the Golden Pavilion to pay homage to the Holy Lord, roaming the Jade Capital to visit the Primordial One—this is the tenfold pattern.

Shaowei said: This shows the ability to save ancestors. According to the *Sanyuan Pinjie*, the Vermilion salvation pattern has three grades: nine years for middle blessing; three years for great blessing; twenty-four years for small blessing. All are reborn in the lower realm, becoming nobles. By prior affinity, those who love study can become immortals without passing through birth and death.

The highest students, cultivating and reciting this scripture, all immediately receive salvation, ascending to the Southern Palace.

Youxi said: The highest students are those who hear the Dao and diligently practice, seeing the Dharma and surely learning, never ceasing through cold and heat. These are immortals named below the nine palaces of Supreme Purity. Having cultivated this scripture, their bodies attain the Dao, ascending to the immortal realm, receiving refinement in the Southern Palace. The soul and spirit ascend to immortality, thus fire refines the ghostly substance; the living body attains the Dao, thus fire refines impurities. Hence all first enter the Southern Palace, then ascend their original position—this is the pattern of the highest students.

Common people who recite extend their lifespan and years; later all obtain the method of corpse liberation. The soul and spirit temporarily extinguish, without passing through hell, immediately regaining form, roaming the vast sky.

Youxi said: Common people mean those on the ordinary path, not outstanding persons. Because of shallow ancestral blessings and slight功, they enjoy long life before death; after death, their form dissolves temporarily. Yet they do not follow the Three Officials’ system, nor undergo the nine palaces’ hardships; after a set term, the spirit returns to the form. Having changed form in the Three Officials’ halls, renewed youthful face in the nine refinements of the corpse, they do not enter the Southern Palace, but roam the vast sky. The vast sky is above Supreme Purity’s three realms. This is the pattern of common people. From true to mundane there are five ranks, thus levels differ.

Shaowei said: This also shows common people can self-salvate. Their virtue is thin,功 incomplete; though unable to fly with flesh and bones, they can liberate the corpse and attain salvation. The *Benxiang Jing* says: Without prior功, the corpse cannot become immortal; thus corpse liberation leads to Dao. According to the scripture, there are four kinds of corpse liberation: one is military liberation, like Ji Kang entrusting his body to the market, Huainan entrusting his form to prison; two is literary liberation, like Ci Qing exchanging form with shoes, the eldest son liberating form in bamboo; three is water-fire refining, like Feng Yi drowning in the great river, Fengzi burning in the fire tree; four is great yin refining substance, seeing the dead whose feet are not blue, skin not wrinkled, eyes not destroyed, bending and stretching like a person—this is also corpse liberation. The flesh does not decay for a hundred years, again rising as a person. The *Zhenyu* says: Pei Jun said: Corpse liberation immortals cannot ride the canopy, fly dragons, ascend the Great Ultimate, or roam the nine palaces; they only do not die. Using bow and sword is military liberation; bamboo staff is literary liberation; combined water-fire and great yin are the four kinds of liberation.

This scripture is subtle and wondrous, universally saving without end; all heavenly beings receive blessing. Infinite blessings, life and death receive grace.

Youxi said: The scripture’s功 and efficacy are profound and difficult to fathom; ten turns bring myriad qi to immortality; five levels save infinite beings. Heavenly beings bathe in liberation’s blessing; life and death rely on salvation’s grace.

Treasured by the heavens, not transmitted to the lower world.

Shaowei said: When the Heavenly Venerable spoke the scripture, it was not transmitted to the lower world; the Queen Mother requested to permit it to flow during the Jia Shen calamity, thus it spread in the human realm. Song Jun said: This scripture saves beings in four ways: one, ascending to Heaven in the body; two, corpse liberation transforming and saving; three, death without decay, later rising again; four, soul and spirit temporarily extinguishing, ascending to the Southern Palace to receive refinement. Karma varies in weight; thus retribution differs. Also saving ancestors; thus life and death receive grace.

The deep student carries the golden treasure, pledges the heart, swears to Heaven and then transmits. Light leakage and neglect bring disaster to nine ancestors, long servitude to ghost officials.

Youxi said: Since it is secreted in the Mysterious Capital, it should not be transmitted to the lower world. Now due to the Supreme One’s dissemination, it is again bestowed to the human realm. Thus the deep student carries the golden treasure to pledge the heart and make a solemn oath; breaking the pledge brings ancestral examination, treasure secrecy brings the merit of countless ancestors.

Shaowei said: The spiritual script is secret and weighty; bestowing and receiving are difficult; how can one lightly transmit, causing disaster to nine ancestors?

The five emperors guard the scripture, jade boys and jade girls, each twenty-four, managing and protecting the scripture holder’s body.

Youxi said: The five emperors’ jade boys and jade girls come to serve—not the five emperors with the jade boys and girls together. The five emperors are the Five Elder Emperor Lords, not the five directions’ emperors. The boys and girls total forty-eight, always guarding the spiritual scripture and protecting the reciter. They recommend and raise sincere功, inspect for leakage and neglect. Those who receive the scripture should be cautious. When going out or roaming, they should carry the scripture to protect the body, avoiding calamity and worry.

The Dao says: On the first month’s long fast, recite this scripture to sever the earth’s calamities for the departed ancestors, saving them to the Upper Southern Palace.

Youxi said: The first month is the Upper Origin’s great celebration month. Thus it can bless ancestors and spirits, sever the ghosts’ and gods’ endless servitude, receiving the immortal officials’ salvation blessing. “Fast” means the body has no distractions, the mind no external thoughts, inside and outside pure and empty, embracing the origin and guarding the one, throughout the month. Hence “long fast.”

On the seventh month’s long fast, recite this scripture; the body attains immortality; the heavens’ book names, yellow registers and white slips, erase death and raise life.

Youxi said: The seventh month is the Middle Origin’s great celebration month. Thus it benefits oneself and the heavens above; names recorded on white slips, Feng and Dai remove death; registered in black ledgers, the body attains immortality, position ascending to the heavenly mansion. Yellow registers and white slips are written in gold and white jade. This does not mention the tenth month’s Lower Origin, which is for the Lower Origin’s ancestors and descendants. Since the highest students are foremost, the tenth month’s Lower Origin is omitted. The scripture also does not discuss Lower Origin功 and faults. Highest students study this carefully.

Shaowei said: The Heavenly Official’s examination time is for ancestors; the Earthly Official’s monthly review is for oneself. This is the difference of precedence and rank. Yellow registers and white slips record immortals’ registers. The *Luzi Hui Nian Jing* says: Name registers and imperial registers depend on prior affinity, all due to diligent seeking, not natural. Xuanying said: According to the *Sanyuan Pinjie*, the first month’s three yang qi arise, the time of the Upper Origin’s heavenly officials’ review, suitable for ancestors’ salvation. The seventh month is the Middle Origin’s review month, the Earthly Official’s examination time, suitable for oneself. This is the difference of precedence and rank. The cultivation method universally saves without end, aids life and death, moistens plants and animals; above for royal ancestral temples, below for the five sufferings’ spirits. How could it only transcend seven ancestors? This is to encourage filial piety, hence for the departed ancestors.

The tenth month’s long fast, recite this scripture for emperors, kings, lords, ministers, fathers, and sons, to secure the nation’s mandate, protect Heaven’s enduring presence, generation after generation unbroken, long as human rulers, peacefully securing their domains. On the eight festival days, reciting this scripture grants becoming a true person of the Nine Palaces.

Youxi said: The four beginnings, two divisions, two solstices make the eight festival days. These are the heavens’ great celebrations and auspicious assemblies, the days to examine功 and faults. If on these days one can fast and recite, one becomes a true person of the Nine Palaces. This is because the Nine Palaces, excluding the central supreme position, cycle around eight palaces to correspond to the eight festivals. Matching the days, reciting grants ascent to this realm.

Shaowei said: One yuan has three palaces; three yuan have nine palaces. Also: the eight festival days correspond to the eight history gods who watch over human good and evil, so the eight festivals must be observed with recitation. Why are the eight festival days for the Nine Palaces true persons? Because the eight festivals are the eight trigrams; combining left three and right seven, with the central palace as head and foot, matching the nine palaces, hence called Nine Palaces true persons.

On one’s birth day, recite this scripture; the soul and spirit become clear and correct; myriad qi endure; no suffering or distress; the body shines with light.

Youxi said: The birth day is the annual day, only examining one’s功 and faults. Thus on that day one fasts and recites. People regard qi as root, spirit as base. Qi preserved means spirit correct; base firm means root deep. Inner spirit and qi harmonize; outer light shines naturally. Thus myriad worries do not arise; how could distress enter? Since one recites on one’s own birth day, one preserves one’s spirit and qi. The sage’s acts all have reason; from this, the cultivation principle is clear.

Shaowei said: When spirit is harmonious and qi smooth, one hears spiritual sound and becomes clear and correct, sensing the void and brightness, shining with light.

Commentary says: On birth day, the life officer examines one’s good and evil, so one must also cultivate this scripture. If one is evil, evil qi enters the body; if good, correct qi returns; thus preserving long life without suffering.

The Three Realms’ guards, the Five Emperors’ escorts, myriad gods pay homage, names recorded in Heaven.功 complete, virtue fulfilled, ascending Supreme Purity.

Youxi said: The Three Realms’ guards are the Three Realms’ demon kings’ attendants. The Five Emperors’ escorts are the five directions’ heavenly emperors’ coming and going. Then sitting in court with myriad spirits, names recorded in imperial registers.功 complete, virtue fulfilled, ascending the white day to Supreme Purity, flying to the heavens.

Shaowei said: Lu said: Supreme Purity is the central capital. According to the *Longqiao Jing*, above the four Brahmas are the Three Purities. The Supreme Purity has twelve heavens, where nine immortals reside; above that is the Upper Purity with twelve heavens, where nine true ones reside; above that is the Jade Purity with twelve heavens, where nine saints reside. These thirty-six heavens are all indestructible realms. The *Dongshen Jing* says: The Three Purities’ heavens are naturally transformed, standing in the void, seven treasure palaces, neither born nor destroyed, with myriad spirits attending.

The Dao says: On the day of practice, one should bathe with fragrant water, fast, enter the room facing east.

Youxi said: The day of practice means the day one recites this scripture. To prevent people from not holding it long, it says “day of practice,” also the auspicious days mentioned before. Always bathe with fragrant water, then enter a separate room to fast, purify the mind and self, pure and unperturbed. If living in the mountains with little strength, one may also stay in one’s sleeping room, always keeping it clean and orderly, first putting on clothes and washing, placing the scripture on the table, then burning incense in the scripture hall, bowing and inviting, kneeling and opening. Now the cultivation and recitation’s purpose is to take the scripture in the room, sitting facing east. Burning incense and reading, focusing the mind and eyes, softly chanting. If simply reciting, many errors occur; thus read the first thirty characters carefully, not hastily. If greedy for the number of recitations,功 is lost, greatly misleading. Adjust tone and chant to harmonize spirit and soul, always keeping fragrant qi continuous in the room. At this chapter, then follow the method of bowing.

Knock teeth thirty-two times to communicate. Above hear the thirty-two heavens, the heart bows thirty-two times.

Shaowei said: The *Zhenyu* says: Knocking teeth gathers spirit; swallowing saliva harmonizes truth. The *Yi* says: The emperor emerges from Zhen. Zhen is the direction of long life, the revered heaven of the heavens; thus facing east. First imagine the august ancestors and bow, then each heavenly emperor in turn, each imagined and bowed to, thus completing the thirty-two times.

Close the eyes and meditate, sitting amid blue, yellow, and white three-colored cloud qi.

Shaowei said: Mysterious qi is blue; primordial qi is yellow; initial qi is white. Imagine these three qi.

Inside and outside are deep and dark; blue dragon, white tiger, vermilion bird, mysterious tortoise, lion, white crane array left and right; sun and moon shine. Illuminating the room, the neck produces a round image, light shining in all directions, clear and distinct. Secret incantation says:

Youxi said: Burn incense again and half-open the eyes. Hands rest on the knees, knocking teeth thirty-two times. Each knock corresponds to one heaven. Then imagine rising to bow to the thirty-two heavenly emperors, starting from the east and north, circling the four directions, each bow corresponds to one emperor. After bowing, close the eyes and imagine. Sitting down, naturally blue, yellow, and white three-colored cloud qi fills the room, lush and dense. Left is the blue dragon, right the white tiger; front the vermilion bird, back the mysterious tortoise; lions on left and right in two rows, facing each other. White cranes accompany lions. The sun is in front, the moon behind, illuminating the room; the neck produces light images shining through all directions. After imagining all, review clearly as if seeing. The secret incantation means moving the mouth without sound.

The Supreme Mysterious Primordial Dao Lord summons from the servant body the three-five功曹, left and right officials and messengers, incense attendants jade boys, message transmitters jade girls, Five Emperors’ direct talismans, direct day incense officials, each thirty-two persons, closing and opening what is said: “Today is auspicious, long fast and pure hall, cultivating the supreme scripture, infinite salvation of beings. I and the甲乙 turn scripture life, wish the opening above to reach through, directly governing the supreme thirty-two heavens, Primordial Supreme Emperor’s august seat.”

Shaowei said: The Primordial Supreme Emperor is another title of the Heavenly Venerable.

Finished. Drawing in qi thirty-two times.

Shaowei said: Drawing in qi means inhaling by mouth, not drawing out. Still imagine the thirty-two heavens’ original qi colors, inhaling in order, starting from the august ancestors.

Facing east, recite the scripture.

Youxi said: Having begun the incense blessing, no need to fully annotate; briefly mentioning essentials. The direct day incense officials are the thirty-two heavens’ officials. They come to inspect and report. “Today auspicious” means the auspicious days of the Three Origins and Eight Festivals. Each time says: “Today is auspicious,” so fasting is necessary. “I and甲乙” refers to later the sun, moon, heaven, earth, stars, country lord, and people. In ordinary times, it means “I and ancestors.” The Primordial Supreme Emperor is not the Primordial Heavenly Venerable. The Supreme Emperor is also high and equal to the Primordial, so called thus. Knowing the Primordial title is not a single title. After the blessing, inhale the three-colored cloud qi through the nose, swallowing it. After thirty-two times, thoroughly enter one form, then recite the scripture for a long time. Burning incense and reciting scripture. The first reading from the preface, then each reading from the Primordial Profound title, each time imagining, ten times is best. If urgent, one may rise temporarily; if the scripture time is long, one must return to the previous, start from the preface, and again imagine. Shaowei said: From Primordial Profound below is the scripture.
