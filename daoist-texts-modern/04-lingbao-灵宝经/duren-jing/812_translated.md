### Thirty-Five Divisions of the Primordial Qi of the Supreme Origin

The Seven Primary Stars of the Northern Dipper, together with the Twenty-Eight Constellations of the Four Directions, make up the Thirty-Five Divisions. The Primordial Qi of the Supreme Origin resides in the upper heavens, governing creation and transformation. The Northern Dipper is the central Dipper. The *Records of the Grand Historian, Treatise on Heavenly Officials* states: "The Dipper is the imperial chariot, moving at the center, overseeing the four quarters. It divides yin and yang, establishes the four seasons, balances the Five Phases, shifts the solar terms, and sets the various calendars—all are connected to the Dipper." Now this diagram is drawn to observe the celestial phenomena. Humbly, I arrange this chapter according to the constellation charts.

*Reverently gaze upon the Thirty-Five Divisions of the Primordial Qi of the Supreme Origin.*

### Summary of the Thirty-Two Heavens’ Hidden Mysteries

The Great Yellow Sovereign once reached the Supreme Brightness of the Seven Luminaries and the Six Heavens of Mayi, which belong to the Desire Realm;  
The Void Beyond the Balance extends to the Infinite Tan Shi’s Eighteen Heavens, belonging to the Form Realm;  
The Bright Court’s Night Crossing reaches the Supreme Tai Su, the Four Heavens of Elegant Music, belonging to the Formless Realm.  
These are called the Three Realms. The Supreme Void is the highest eternal fusion. The Four Heavens of Ping Yu Jia Yi at the Great Ultimate are the seed people.  
Now, examining this scripture, it is divided into ten matters:  
One, the names of the heavens, fixed at the beginning of kalpas;  
Two, the imperial titles, commanded by the Primordial Origin;  
Three, the imperial secret names, the names of the heavenly emperors;  
Four, the offices the heavenly emperors preside over, the duties of the constant dao;  
Five, the qi linked to the constellations, descending and connecting the Twenty-Eight Mansions’ qi;  
Six, the names of the qi, the one continuous soft reception of it;  
Seven, the qi colors, the hues dividing the directions of the Primordial Beam;  
Eight, the Great Brahma’s secret language, the inner sound composed by the Dao Lord—details are explained in the lower scroll’s chapter on the origin of inner sounds;  
Nine, the division of realms, the ascending and descending above and below;  
Ten, the lifespans of the heavenly people, the numbers of short and long lives.  
This diagram is the most precious essence of the treasure scripture; those who recite and uphold it should carefully practice it. Humbly, I combine Chen Jingyuan’s meanings, the Xuan Ying commentary, Li Shaowei, Xue Youqi, and Yan Dong’s annotations, mixed with the Hunyuan Diagram Wings and the Dongdong Lingzhang Scripture. The inner sound Jade Character Scripture fixes this chapter.

### Explanation of the Qi Linked to the Constellations

The Twenty-Eight Heavens of the Four Directions each correspond to the qi of one mansion. The Four Pillars’ Four Heavens each link to the Brahma qi between two mansions. They descend equally, intersecting; the northeast heaven corresponds again to the northwest mansion, for the ascending life qi turns like a ram’s horn as it rises. The flow of redemption, though deeply understood in its meaning, is perplexed by the directions and pillars; therefore, this diagram is made to clarify it.

### Dividing the Scripture’s Beginning and End

The Heavenly Venerable spoke the scripture in two chapters, with preface and conclusion. The Great Brahma’s secret language also has preface and conclusion, all composed by the Dao Lord. Details are explained in the lower scroll’s chapters *Revealing the Treasure Scripture’s Sealing and Descent* and *Origin of the Inner Sound*. Now, separating the beginning and end, dividing the chapters, and fixing the number of characters according to the canonical text, with titles, the total is four thousand five hundred seventy-four characters. Humbly, I combine Chen Jingyuan’s meanings and Zhang Wanfujue’s formulas to fix this chapter.

**Chapter Titles:**

- Primordial Heavenly Venerable’s Treasure Scripture Front Chapter  
- Primordial Heavenly Venerable’s Treasure Scripture Rear Chapter

*Master Shouyi of the Taiqing Chuqing Palace*  
*Bestowed to Purple Daoist Liu Yuandao for Compilation and Arrangement*  
*Recitation of the Two Chapters of the Correct Scripture Formula*

Whenever encountering the day to recite the scripture, set up the scripture table and sitting implements in the pure chamber facing east. Then enter the chamber, turn your back to the seat facing east, and perform three bows. After the bows, withdraw facing north to the seat. If no fixed posture, gradually turn left, facing east, sitting evenly. Chant the incantation:

> Silent, silent, reaching the rootless source,  
> Void stands like the kalpa blade Ah.  
> Radiant and vast, the profound script unfolds,  
> Who can fathom this distant mystery?  
> Once entering the Great Vehicle path,  
> Who counts the years and kalpas?  
> Neither birth nor extinction,  
> Desire to be born from the lotus.  
> Transcending the Three Realms’ path,  
> Compassionate heart unbinds worldly nets.  
> The perfected one’s supreme virtue,  
> Generation upon generation as immortal family.

After the incantation, place hands on the knees, knock teeth thirty-two times. Close eyes and hold the Thirty-Two Heavens in mind, each heaven manifesting one emperor. Reflect on one heaven’s name, heartfully bow to one heavenly emperor. Beginning with the Sovereign Ancestor Heaven, following the sun’s rotation, circling the four directions, gradually ascending to the Jia Yi Heaven. A total of thirty-two bows. Though the body does not move, the mind bows and submits. After bowing, imagine the body surrounded by azure, yellow, and white clouds of qi, the chamber instantly filled with lush vitality. To the left is the Azure Dragon, to the right the White Tiger, in front the Vermilion Bird, behind the Black Tortoise. Two rows of lions, twenty-eight in number, sit facing each other in front; the number of white cranes is the same, also outside the lions. The sun is in front, the moon behind, shining brightly within the chamber. A nine-colored round symbol forms at the nape, illuminating all heavens. Surveying what is held, all appears vividly before the eyes. Silently chant:

> Supreme Mysterious Primordial Most High Dao Lord,  
> Summon forth from my body the three-five merit officers,  
> Left and right officials and envoys, incense attendants and jade youths,  
> Jade maidens who transmit words, the Five Emperors’ direct talismans,  
> The incense officers of the direct days, each thirty-two in number,  
> To open and close what is spoken.  
> What is spoken are the heavens and earth, sun and moon, stars and constellations,  
> Kings and lords, teachers and friends, ancestors, self, and multitudes’ prayers.  
> When chanting the opening and closing words, one should respond accordingly.  
> Today is auspicious and joyful, long fasting in the pure hall,  
> Cultivating practice to the scripture, infinite deliverance of beings.  
> I and the A and B, A and B shall respond to the same wishes above,  
> Saying “I and so-and-so” or “I and such matter.”  
> Turning the scripture to receive life, may the opened wishes reach the Supreme,  
> Directly approaching the Most High Primordial Heavenly Emperor’s supreme throne.

After the incantation, slowly among the Thirty-Two Heavens, one heaven leads the boundary and one mouth swallows it. According to the former method, stop, then open eyes and recite the two chapters. After reciting, face south, leave the seat, bow again, and withdraw. Humbly, I combine Chen Jingyuan’s meanings and Zhang Wanfujue’s formulas to fix this chapter.

### Recitation of the Two Chapters of the Correct Scripture

In the first month’s long fast, reciting this scripture delivers the souls of the upper world’s departed from the earth’s bonds, delivering them to the Southern Palace;  
In the seventh month’s long fast, reciting this scripture grants the body to become divine immortals, with the heavens recording their names;  
The Yellow Empress’s white slips erase death and grant birth;  
In the tenth month’s long fast, reciting this scripture benefits kings, emperors, lords, ministers, fathers, and sons, stabilizing the nation’s mandate, preserving Heaven’s longevity;  
Generation upon generation unbroken, long to be human rulers;  
Stabilizing their domains, the people call it great peace.  
On the eight seasonal festival days, reciting this scripture grants one to become a True Person of the Nine Palaces;  
On one’s birth day, reciting this scripture purifies soul and spirit, all qi long enduring, free from suffering and vexation, the body shining with light;  
The Three Realms guard and serve, the Five Emperors oversee reception, myriad spirits pay homage, names registered in Heaven;  
Merit fulfilled and virtue attained, ascending to Shangqing.  
Recite it ten times, the heavens record merit;  
Recite it one hundred times, the name is delivered to the Southern Palace;  
Recite it one thousand times, demon kings protect and welcome;  
Recite it ten thousand times, the dao is complete, ascending to the great void.

If one can meet this moment and hold to the formula of recitation, above all heavenly disasters are dispelled, emperors and kings are protected below, poisons and harms are removed, multitudes are delivered; ancestors are lifted in the middle, and oneself attains the dao. Truly one may be called the majestic Great Brahma, uniquely striding the Jade Capital.

### Verification of Reciting the Inner Sounds

**Eastern Great Brahma’s sound:** recite for nine years. Each of the eight heavens sends down eight azure-waisted jade maidens and eight azure radiant jade youths as attendants, bringing down the essence of azure teeth, body born in light, penetrating the void. Ten thousand recitations complete the dao, flying to Shangqing, sharing blessings with the Seven Ancestors, all ascending to the Southern Palace.

**Southern Great Brahma’s sound:** recite for three years. Each of the eight heavens sends down eight great cinnabar jade maidens and eight sun jade youths as attendants, bringing down the essence of vermilion cinnabar’s three qi, returning white and retaining form. Ten thousand kalpas unshaken, Seven Ancestors transcend and ascend, entering the blessed hall, returning to the womb immortal family, thus gaining rebirth.

**Western Great Brahma’s sound:** recite for seven years. Each of the eight heavens sends down eight pure spirit jade youths as attendants, bringing down the essence of Tai Su’s seven illuminations, halting years and retaining appearance, ten thousand kalpas with youthful face. Celebrating with the Seven Ancestors, ascending and delivering to the Southern Palace, returning to the womb for rebirth, generation upon generation immortals.

**Northern Great Brahma’s sound:** recite for five years. Each of the eight heavens sends down eight Tai Yuan jade youths as attendants, bringing down the essence of primordial nourishment’s five qi, returning years and retaining radiance, preserving life of the Three Pure Ones, blessing the Nine Mysterious Ones, generation upon generation flying to ascend.

If one can follow the formula and recite the inner sounds of the four directions, nothing is not dispelled, nothing is not removed, nothing is not delivered, nothing is not accomplished. Flying to the Heavenly Observatory, the Emperor sings from afar, myriad spirits pay homage, the Three Realms attend the pavilion. Stirring and subduing the host of spirits, purifying the Ten Directions, the dao is complete and merit accomplished, serving the Three Realms. Humbly, I fix this chapter with Zhang Wanfujue’s formula.

### Revealing the Treasure Scripture’s Sealing and Descent

The Heavenly Venerable expounded this scripture in the Beginning Blue Heaven to grant to the Dao Lord. Again, in the Great Cinnabar Heaven, bestowed the Great Brahma’s sound. After the Dao Lord composed the preface, Heaven treasured it, secretly storing it in the Mysterious Capital Jade Capital Purple Tenuity Upper Palace. Sealed and stored with utmost weight, only the sage may transmit it. Later, the Queen Mother of the West petitioned the Heavenly Emperor to descend and protect against the calamity of Jia Shen year, entrusting it to the cultivators of truth; thus it spread among humans. This scripture also contains the secret songs of the various heavenly emperors and the most numinous demon kings, internally discussing the kalpa’s fate, myriad spirits’ names and titles, the interplay of yin and yang, the primal black’s generation and transformation; its meaning cannot be fully comprehended, its principle cannot be fully understood. Those who attain enlightenment can naturally penetrate it. Heaven transmits once every forty thousand kalpas; humans receive it every forty years. Careless leakage brings disaster to the Nine Ancestors, long bondage in the nether darkness. Can one not be cautious? Can one not be cautious? Humbly, I fix this chapter with Li Shaowei’s annotations.

### Origin of the Inner Sound

The Heavenly Venerable, seated at Bailingshe in the Red Bright World, at that time clouds and mist thickened, three days and three nights, the nether darkness unresolved. The Five Elders, Heavenly Emperors, reported to the Heavenly Venerable: “Today at the seat, what has never been seen before.” The Heavenly Venerable expounded the teaching, causing the mountains and seas to fall silent, heaven and earth to be purified. Now the white day is darkened, heaven and humans fearful, we have doubts and do not understand why. The Heavenly Venerable said: “Today the heavens issue auspicious signs, numinous responses naturally arise, the jade characters shine brilliantly, obscuring the birth of light. All are ordered to close their eyes and wait. Suddenly, heavenly qi bursts open, darkness vanishes, five-colored light shines illuminating the Ten Directions. Each has a numinous book, characters one zhang square, appearing in the void. The text glows radiantly, eight corners hanging rays, essence light dazzling the eyes, impossible to gaze upon. The Heavenly Venerable universally informs the myriad spirits: ‘These numinous books are eight assemblies, characters have no fixed form, their meaning is profound and mysterious, you all cannot seek to fully understand.’ Then he commands the Heavenly True Sovereign to note the characters and explain their sounds, to bestow to the Dao Lord, totaling two hundred fifty-six characters. The Dao Lord arranged and completed the text. This is called the Great Brahma’s Secret Language. Following the preface is the attached Yi Zao. The Sovereign was once descended in the time of the Yellow Emperor to Mount Emei, bestowed the method of three one five teeth, then ascended again to Heaven. Humbly, I fix this chapter combining the *Inner Sound Scripture* and *Biographies of the Immortals*.
