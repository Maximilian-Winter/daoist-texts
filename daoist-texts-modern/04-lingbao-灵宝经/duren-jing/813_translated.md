# The Most High Profound Cavern Numinous Treasure Infinite Salvation of Beings Supreme Scripture and Method

**Title:** The Most High Profound Cavern Numinous Treasure Infinite Salvation of Beings Supreme Scripture and Method. Collected and annotated by Chen Chunrong of the Southern Song. Five scrolls. Source edition: *Orthodox Daoist Canon*, Cavern of Truth division, Jade Secrets category.

---

With careful attention to the *Numinous Treasure Scripture and Method*: There are nine grades of hidden merit, for dispelling calamities, and for personal use in praying for blessings, crossing dangers, and performing merit to preserve the body. The Primordial Heavenly Worthy sits aloft, floating upon a five-colored lion, dwelling within the sunlight. He is the Parent of Heaven and Earth, the King of Nations, and the Celestial Phenomena; thus, one may recite the divine words.

For the upper elixir field, recite four thousand times with the divine chant. For disasters and others, recite mentally. For the middle elixir field, recite three thousand times with the heart chant. For all departed and wandering souls, recite three thousand times with the qi chant of the lower elixir field. Each single meditation requires ten recitations. Ten recitations make one cycle; one hundred recitations make ten cycles. For every mistaken word, return thirty words prior and recite again; for every extra word, cover fifty words back and recite again. Recite with a lowered voice; chant with clear intonation, letting the sound and phrase complete fully—do not rush merely to increase counts. Always keep the spirit and soul joyful and free, the fragrant qi continuous, never ceasing within the chamber. If one uses a beautiful voice but hastens the counts, there will be no spiritual response; empty corpse recitations, wishing to fly or sink, are not only useless but invite the fault of light recitation.

*Written by the Immortal at the Jade Altar*

Before the great chaos was divided, within the midst was the spirit of unity; when the great mass separated, it embraced the treasure of the three births. Scattered, it becomes qi; gathered, it forms patterns, weaving through the empty cavern and encompassing the mysterious void. The primordial thread flows and unfolds, establishing the essence root of Heaven and Earth; myriad forms open and spread, distributing the blood vessels of yin and yang. The five patterns universally plant, the three lights shine together, opening the thirty-two layers of Heaven, binding hundreds of millions of qi pathways, thereby preserving and regulating kalpa cycles, assisting and endorsing the imperial plan. It creates the secret mystery of rebirth and resurrection, the essential marvel for entering the sage and transcending the mundane. It unfolds the three caverns, all speak of creation; it teaches one nation, fully reaching non-action. It stores the numinous treasure in the field of the body, accepts the millet pearl in the nature-earth. With a single thought, one enters the great floating land; opens the multi-storied towers, ascends the Yu Luo Xiao platform. Always intimately attending one’s own empty emperor, suddenly awakening to the Primordial of the mind alone. All myriad beings become immortal true spirits; all restless spirits proclaim themselves great saints of longevity.

## Scroll One of the Most High Profound Cavern Numinous Treasure Infinite Salvation of Beings Supreme Scripture and Method

Collected and annotated by disciple Chen Chunrong of the Three-Five Capital Merit Office

All the myriad saints revere, all the true ones admire, the supreme beyond supreme, profound beyond profound. “Profound Cavern Numinous Treasure” is the name of the rank; “Infinite Salvation of Beings” is the title of the scroll. The foundation of all scriptures, thus called supreme; its function subtle and wondrous, hence the marvelous scripture.

### Chapter of Profound Introduction

The Dao says: “You script.”

This is the speech of the Most High Jade Morning Great Dao Lord and the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy. The Dao Lord prefaces the scripture, so the Dao speech leads. The Profound Master says: wherever there is Dao speech, it is the Jade Morning Great Dao Lord’s own preface, not the head of a second chapter.

Once in the Beginning Azure Heaven,

The Beginning Azure Heavenly King rises triumphant.

In the blue void, the empty song of the Mao script, the great floating land of separation,

Floating land is the secret name of the Jade Lofty Heavenly Emperor.

Receiving the Primordial’s infinite supreme salvation.

The Jade Morning Great Dao Lord is the master of the Numinous Treasure teaching, disciple of the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, and teacher of the Supreme Lofty Heavenly Emperor. He receives the supreme method of salvation of beings of the Numinous Treasure.

### Chapter of Initiation and Movement

Primordial Heavenly Worthy

Note: The Primordial Heavenly Worthy is the title of the Empty Emperor. From true beginning response, it is called realization and cultivation, marvelous thought and mysterious source, uniquely inherent in one’s nature. The *Cavern Spirit Scripture* says: marvelous image without form, responsive with body, true essence qi, transforming into appearance.

When speaking this scripture, circle ten cycles to summon the Ten Directions.

The Primordial Heavenly Worthy is the master of Dao and Dharma. At this kalpa’s turning, he opens the chart and issues teaching, expounds the Dharma, transmits the scripture. First he summons the Ten Directions’ heavenly spirits, then ascends the seat. The method says: the Primordial Heavenly Worthy is the original self, the original spirit, master of the one body.

### Chapter of True Response

First one should approach the seat, from the Zi to Wu script to choose.

The seat is the empty profound seat. It means one should first approach the seat.

Heavenly spirits great gods, Supreme Clear script.

Highest origin true, nine grades of truth.

Imperial note: these come from the Three Realms, without cultivation or realization, without position or karma, the highest true.

Highest sage exalted, Jade Clear script.

Middle origin sage, nine grades of sage.

Imperial note: these have cultivation and realization, position and karma, the highest sage.

Marvelous conduct true person, Supreme Clear script.

Lower origin immortal true, nine grades of true person.

Imperial note: these are true persons who act as original for original, all within the Jade Clear realm, transcending the Three Realms’ heavens. These three titles of heavenly spirits correspond to the upper eight scenic spirit qi of the one body.

Countless multitudes, riding the void, flying clouds and cinnabar skies, green chariots and jade wheels, feathered canopies shading, flowing essence and jade light. Hai script.

Flowing essence jade light is the nine-colored round image. Also called sun and moon qi, heaven’s numinous treasure. It can be gathered and refined, to nourish and become true.

Five colors flourishing, You script,

Radiant in the vast emptiness.

Chapter of fixed pole, fixed observation method. Great cavern realm.

Seven days and seven nights, the heavens’ sun, moon, and stars, the celestial pivot and jade balance, all pause their wheels at once.

The Profound Master says: since the sun and moon stop their wheels, how can the count of seven days and seven nights be distinguished? It is the marvelous use and divine power of the Heavenly Worthy, transforming the mechanism and stirring response. This subtle sacred response is the Heavenly Worthy’s external manifestation; the sun and moon do not move, the stars do not rotate, the celestial pivot and jade balance pause their wheels, so day and night do not appear. Yet internally the operation and mastery of function never cease. Thus the Jade Morning clarifies the count of seven days and seven nights, not as earthly days and nights. In internal speech, it is the great fixed divine light, calmly seeing the Jade Clear realm, having the power of seven days and seven nights. The sun and moon stop their wheels, the eyes do not blink. It is neither closed eyes, nor inner vision, nor focused vision; it is the long gaze of seven days and seven nights, stopping eye blinks, illuminating the three parts, inside and outside thoroughly. The one body’s qi and blood circulate through the hundred joints and meridians, yin and yang, Ying and Wei, all linked to the three parts’ pulse and breath. The breath is the person’s one body celestial pivot and jade balance. The four extremities are the celestial pivot, the three parts are the jade balance. Since the celestial pivot does not move, the sun and moon stay fixed, the stars pause their wheels, the four extremities do not arrive, the three parts do not breathe, the one body’s qi and blood all cease circulation.

Imperial note: calm and peaceful, united with spirit qi.

The four stars are the celestial pivot, the three stars are the jade balance.

Diagram of Celestial Pivot and Jade Balance

One breath and one exhale make four extremities, together six cun. One breath two extremities, one exhale two extremities, each three cun. One extremity is fifteen fen. Meridian and latitude are fifteen, thus the Emperor entrusted the Yellow River chart to the Yellow Emperor.

The *Numinous Treasure Inner Image Elixir Instructions* say: a person’s qi flows in and out by breathing. A person breathes in and out, making one breath. In one breath, yin and yang divide: breathing out is brightness, yang, day; breathing in is darkness, yin, night. The seven orifices’ breath is seven days; the seven orifices’ inhale is seven nights. The heavenly mechanism does not move, spirit condenses and eyes fix, pulse settles and heart stops, thus the sun, seven days and seven nights, sun, moon, stars, celestial pivot, jade balance, all pause their wheels at once.

Spirit wind is quiet and silent,

No blowing or sighing breath in or out.

Mountains and seas hide clouds, Zi script.

No obscuring false thoughts or karma.

The sky has no floating shadows,

Clear and serene.

Four black bright clear. Mao script.

Natural warmth, coolness, cold, and heat.

One nation’s land,

Is like one body.

Mountains, rivers, forests, and trees,

Are like four limbs, a hundred vessels, hair, pores, Ying and Wei, bones and joints.

All equal and level, no high or low. The earth all becomes jade, no differing colors.

Entering the Dao’s fixed realm, calmly embodying nature, inside and outside the body all like jade, without a speck of dust.

The Profound Master says: fixed observation of seven days, unaware of day or night, observing mind without mind, this is the true original mind; observing form without form, this is recognizing the original true form. Both mind and form vanish, entering the formless Dao, this is great fixed state, spirit light calm and clear, seeing the Jade Clear realm, having the power of seven days and seven nights.

All true ones attend the seat. Jade Clear script.

The Heavenly Worthy, by great method, summons, and the ten directions’ heavenly spirits respond, like gathering the sea of spirit qi and storing breath in the elixir field. Then thirty-six thousand divine officers serve at the sides.

### Chapter of Returning to Origin

The Primordial Heavenly Worthy sits profoundly floating upon the five-colored lion, Wu script.

The Profound Master says: the Heavenly Worthy floats in emptiness, his original spirit dwelling in the Jade Clear palace. The profound seat is the seat the Dharma body rides. The lion is the Primordial’s majestic spirit. These five qi face the Scarlet Palace, the marvelous transformation of spirit forming the lion. The Heavenly Worthy rides it down into the elixir field: left blue, right white, front red, back black, center yellow, thus the image of the five-colored lion, embodying the Five Phases.

Reciting the scripture once, all the great saints of the heavens simultaneously acclaim “excellent.” At this time, all the nation’s men and women who are deaf and ill have their ears opened and hear clearly.

Heaven is the origin of water, the qi of Kan nurtured in Qian metal. The great saints of the heavens acclaim simultaneously, all spirits at once are unblocked. The nation’s men and women are the yin and yang qi of the Dharma body. Deafness belongs to Kan, the ear, hence related. The Profound Master says: in the ultimate Dao speech, confusion of sound is not knowing the true disease beyond sound. Not hearing the sound, even great hearing is deafness.

Imperial note: what is deafness? It is the ear lacking the virtue of hearing goodness. Upon hearing the Heavenly Worthy’s Dharma speech, the heavenly ear opens and hears, the Dharma sound flows and resonates, clear and unobstructed. Others agree with this explanation.

Reciting twice, the blind have their eyes opened.

Earth is the origin of fire, the qi of Li nurtured in Xun wood. Li is the eye, the eye corresponds to the heart; when the heart is dim to things, it is dark as blindness. Following the Dao, the heart opens and the mind awakens, nothing can obscure.

Reciting thrice, the mute regain speech.

Heaven is the origin of wood, the qi of Zhen nurtured in Gen water. Gen is the mountain; mountains are high and earth thick, waters spring forth.

Reciting four times, the lame, sick, and accumulated ailments all can rise and walk.

Earth is the origin of metal, the qi of Dui nurtured in Kun earth. Rising and walking is the state of planting and standing, with wood nature present.

Reciting five times, chronic and stubborn illnesses instantly restore form.

Heaven is the origin of earth, the qi of Li relying on Wu, with earth qi nurtured in Li.

Reciting six times, white hair returns to black, fallen teeth regrow.

Heaven is the origin of water, completed by Earth six.

Reciting seven times, the old return to vigor, the young all become strong.

Earth is the origin of fire, completed by Heaven seven.

Reciting eight times, women conceive, birds and beasts bear offspring, both born and unborn all obtain generation.

Heaven is the origin of wood, completed by Earth eight. Returning east to Zhen, the sand is formed by Gen and Zhen combining, and wood is formed in water. Sand is mercury sensing lead qi and crystallizing.

Reciting nine times, the Earth Treasury emits and leaks, gold and jade reveal form.

Earth is the origin of metal, completed by Heaven nine. Returning west to Dui, the metal is formed by Kun and Dui combining, metal returns to the earth cauldron and becomes treasure.

Reciting ten times, dry bones revive, all rise as humans. At this time, all the nation’s men and women incline their hearts, all receive protection and salvation, all obtain longevity.

Heaven is the origin of earth, completed by Earth ten.

The Profound Master says: the Heavenly Worthy recites the scripture ten times, the method of Five Phases generation. First the Five Phases give birth numbers, then the Five Phases complete numbers, the tenfold turning returning spirit method. Understanding this Dao leads to longevity; using this Dao leads to realizing these ten auspicious great merits.

### Chapter of Profound Repetition

The Dao says: At this time the Primordial Heavenly Worthy

Reiterates the Heavenly Worthy’s tenfold scripture recitation to summon the Ten Directions. Repeatedly clarifies the order of directions.

Reciting once, Zhen script, Eastern bound, Infinite Limit Infinite Grade Supreme True Great, countless multitudes, float through the air.

Tai’an Hall, village of good acceptance world.

Reciting twice, Li script, Southern bound, Infinite Limit Infinite Grade Supreme True Great, countless multitudes, float through the air.

Reciting ten times, Chen above Si below, Lower bound, Infinite Limit Infinite Grade Supreme True Great God, countless multitudes, float through the air.

Cavern abyss nine ramparts, proper conduct roaming Brahma four sounds, thirty-six palaces, great earth official offices, northern Feng various palaces.

After ten cycles complete, the Ten Directions’ Infinite Limit Heavenly True Great Gods all arrive simultaneously. The nation’s men and women incline their hearts in reverence. Those who come are like fine rain and dense mist. Countless multitudes, half the nation’s soil is tilted and sunken, not to be stopped. Then the Primordial suspends a precious pearl, hands clasping Jade Clear script. As large as millet grain, suspended in the empty profound, five zhang above the earth.

The Profound Master says: the Heavenly Worthy performs marvelous great transformation, suspending a precious pearl in the empty profound, its tether unfathomable. Millet grain is the essence of fragrant five grains. Five zhang above the earth means removed from the five desires, five dusts, five aggregates, five colors, five fragrances, five sounds, beyond the five turbid worlds, thus able to enter the marvelous empty profound.

Xue Youqi annotation: The precious pearl symbolizes the Dao, also the same as the profound pearl. Millet grain is the essence of five grains, the root of living beings, meaning that one obtains the scripture as the vital grain of life. Having left the five turbid, no longer breathing the multitude; not using the Five Phases, forever free from mutual carving. Naturally long life and lasting vision, attaining the Dao and becoming true.

The Primordial then summons the Heavenly True Great Gods, Highest Sage Exalted, Marvelous Conduct True Person, Ten Directions Infinite Limit Supreme True Great Gods, countless multitudes, all enter the precious pearl. The heavenly beings look up, only seeing the vigorous entering the pearl’s mouth; once inside, their location is unknown.

The Heavenly True, Highest Sage, Marvelous Conduct Supreme, their qi unites with the Dao’s marvel, their essence unites with the Dao’s truth, thus able to follow the Heavenly Worthy into the empty profound millet pearl. The heavenly beings’ bodies have not united with truth, cannot enter together, only looking up. Moreover, lower rank small immortals have the marvel of a mustard seed containing Mount Sumeru, suspending the world in a gourd, how much more the great saintly Heavenly Worthy, spreading the great teaching, manifesting divine transformations. According to ultimate Dao speech, one nation is compared to one body. The tilting and sunken means the Dao is tilted and sunken, not fully one body, difficult to call profound and weighty marvel. Heavenly beings are myriad spirits. The Heavenly True Great Gods, Highest Sage Exalted, Marvelous Conduct True Persons are the three primordial gods. The Heavenly Worthy is the original spirit, master of the one body. In internal scene marvelous Dao speech, this is the Jade Clear precious pearl immortal embryo transformation secret.

The nation disperses widely, the earth returns to level and upright, no more tilting or sunken. The Primordial then within the precious pearl finishes the scripture recitation, all true ones supervise and grant to me.

The Primordial recites scripture within the precious pearl, all saints enter. At this time only the Dao Lord is saved. The Dao Lord alone receives this scripture, thus it says granted to me. I am the Dao Lord’s self-designation.

At this time, joy and celebration are beyond words. The ritual is roughly complete, the heavens return to their places. In a flash, silence without lingering sound. At this time, heavenly beings encounter the scripture and method, universally obtaining salvation, fulfilling their original years, without injury. The tilting earth inclines in reverence, all act with good hearts. No killing or harming,

Removing bodily karma sins.

No envy or jealousy,

Removing mental karma sins.

No lust or theft,

Removing bodily karma sins.

No greed or desire,

Removing mental karma sins.

No hatred or anger. Meaning no ornate speech, no evil voices.

Again removing mental karma sins. These twelve great precepts must be first received and held by all who cultivate and recite this scripture.

Unified in compassion and love, different bones become kin, the nation is peaceful and the people abundant, rejoicing in great peace.

### Chapter of Brahma Recitation

The scripture first issues teaching, one nation with Dao, having utmost sincerity, honoring rites and respect, all obtain worldly salvation. Both hands holding Jade Clear script release here.

### Chapter of Secret Declaration

The Dao says: what the Primordial Heavenly Worthy speaks within the scripture are all the various Heavenly Emperors. Their inner names are the hidden rhyme sounds, also the secret names of demon kings, the hidden names of myriad spirits, not common worldly words.

### Chapter of Highest Sage

The highest sage has attained,

The highest sage profoundly unites with the Dao’s marvel, merits and virtues complete.

The true person penetrates the profound and subtle, able to fully understand its chapters, reciting ten cycles.

Ten cycles make one pass, one hundred cycles make ten passes; scripture recitation should follow the method of ten passes.

The heavens chant from afar, myriad emperors set rites, rivers and seas are silent, mountains and peaks hide clouds.

No breathing in or out.

Sun and moon halt their light,

Eyes do not blink.

The celestial pivot does not move,

Pulse does not breathe. This is also the method of great fixed state.

The demons bind their forms, ghost spirits vanish. Jade Clear script.

The Profound Master says: within Fengdu’s six caverns, inside and outside the twelve palaces, demon kings are demon spirits, also called the host of demons. These demons ruin human good nature, attach to human evil deeds, test practitioners. The world has beasts and birds, Five Phases refined creatures, transforming into ghosts and demons. These groups differ in form and kind, spirits akin to humans. There are also external path demons and spirits, and bitter ghost spirits, transforming into Heavenly Worthy gods and true persons, confusing good Daoist practitioners. Be clear and careful not to lose your way, lest you fall into this stream.

Raising the corpse and resurrecting, white bones become human.

The Profound Master says: true persons can penetrate the profound and subtle, understand the great cavern secrets within the scripture, obtain ten grades of responsive merit, this is the true person’s rank.

### Chapter of Ultimate Learning

The ultimate learner,

Heart firm as metal and stone, conduct fierce as water and fire, Heaven and Earth cannot surpass, ghosts and spirits cannot confuse, walking where others cannot, having and not having, this is the name of immortals below the Supreme Ultimate.

Reciting ten cycles, the five emperors guard and serve, the three realms bow, demon spirits lose their eyes, ghosts and monsters vanish. Jade Clear script. Saving and crossing the dying, severing and obtaining life.

The Profound Master says: ultimate learners recite and obtain six grades of merit.

The reason is, learners’ impure qi is not yet consumed, their body not yet fully true, they summon and control the ten directions’ Jade Clear script, their power not yet commanding heavenly governance.

Heavenly governance means the sun, moon, five planets, and seven celestial administrations.

Virtue can subdue and control earth spirits, bind demon spirits, Jade Clear script. But only removes death, cannot grant rebirth.

Learners’ bones and body are not true, impure qi remains, cannot command celestial phenomena, only obtain three grades of merit, this is the ultimate learner’s rank.

### Chapter of Encouragement to the Dao

Light recitation of this chapter brings calamity to the body.

Those who do not fast, purify, bathe, burn incense, and recite gain the sin of calamity.

Offering and respectful rites gain five grades of good fruit.

### Chapter of Praise of the Profound

This scripture is revered and marvelous, unmatched in Jade Capital, infinitely saving beings, the root of myriad Dao, majestic great pattern, virtue hard to surpass.

### Chapter of Cultivation and Recitation

The three primordial grades and precepts, the Vermilion Mound salvation rank, have five levels. Nine years is the middle blessing rank. Great blessing is three years, small blessing twenty-four years.

Receiving transformation and rebirth, becoming noble persons. Those who love learning the supreme scripture, with full merit and virtue, all become gods and immortals, flying to the Golden Pavilion, feasting in Jade Capital.

The Profound Master says: those who receive the scripture but do not cultivate, only recite ten cycles, attain this marvelous response. This speaks of one’s own merit and fruit, saving countless ancestors and bitter ghosts ascending the Vermilion Official, according to Vermilion Mound rank, nine years receiving transformation, rebirth becoming noble persons. If the prior spirit is clear and not obscured, and loves learning the supreme scripture, one’s own merit fills the day, flying to the Supreme Clear heaven, feasting in the Great Luo Jade Capital. This is the rank of reciting ten cycles.

### Chapter of Upper Learning

Upper learners,

Upon hearing Dao, move to action; seeing Dharma, study secret learning; from beginning to end never ceasing, cold and heat without loss; these are immortals named below the Supreme Clear Nine Palaces.

Internally cultivate the Dao, externally recite the scripture.

All immediately receive salvation, flying to the Southern Palace.

The Profound Master says: upper learners both cultivate and recite, cannot save countless ancestors, only obtain their own salvation, this is the upper learner’s rank.

### Chapter of Common People

Common people are ordinary path folk, not extraordinary persons.

They extend life and longevity, later all obtain the method of corpse liberation. Soul and spirit temporarily extinguish, do not pass through hell, immediately return to form, roaming the great void.

Previously, light recitation harms the body; later, light leakage harms the nine ancestors. The Profound Master says: if one lightly leaks or neglects, leaks the profound method, recklessly leaks without following the years, or follows the years but does not fast, or swears and leaks secret prohibitions, causing lightness and disbelief in the profound text, all enter the middle fault. Calamity reaches the nine ancestors, long servitude to ghost officials, the underworld’s officials who command ghosts. The Five Mountains sweep the mountains, Fengdu officials and servants, rivers and mountains govern repeatedly, these are the ghost officials’ servants. Also there are thunder drivers and lightning servants, heavenly officials’ servants; sand carrying and stone bearing, earthly officials’ servants; wave drawing and sea washing, water officials’ servants; these three officials’ servants.

Store the sun from the left sun exiting the left eye, sun purple red qi nine rays. Store the moon from the right moon exiting the right eye, moon yellow white qi ten rays. This is one’s own sun and moon.

Illuminating the chamber, the nape produces a round image, light shining ten directions,

Store sun and moon each nine cun from the face, shining within the chamber, light pouring into nose and mouth, entering the brain’s jade pillow palace, emitting nine-colored round image, exiting behind the nape like a rainbow, light penetrating the ten directions.
