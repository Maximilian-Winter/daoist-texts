# The Numinous Treasure Scripture of Boundless Salvation for the Highest Grade

The Primordial Boundless Salvation for the Highest Grade Sublime Scripture

The Dao speaks:

In ancient times, within the primordial azure Heaven, beneath the vast azure vault, over the great floating land of myriad beings, the Primordial Boundless Salvation was received. The Primordial Heavenly Venerable, the Most High, then began to expound this scripture. Circling ten times, summoning the Ten Directions, all were called to the seat.

The Celestial Numinous Great Deity, the Supreme Holy Exalted One, the Sublime Practitioner of Marvelous Conduct, countless hosts without number, rode the void and came forth. Flying clouds soared to the cinnabar firmament, carriages green as jade, wheels of precious jade, feathered canopies casting shade. Flowing essence and jade light, five colors flourishing richly, illuminating the vast emptiness. For seven days and seven nights.

The myriad heavens’ sun and moon, the starry constellations and the pivoting celestial spheres, the jade balance halted its turning, divine winds hushed in silence, mountains and seas concealed in clouds, the heavens free of floating shadows, the four airs clear and bright. One realm of land and soil, mountains, rivers, forests, and trees, all equal and level, no height or depth remained; the earth was all made of jade, without differing hues.

The myriad true beings attended the seat; the Primordial Heavenly Venerable’s suspended throne floated upon five-colored lions.

When the scripture was recited once, all the great saints of the heavens simultaneously praised, and at that time, all the deaf men and women of the realm had their ears opened and became hearing.

When recited twice, the blind regained sight.

When recited thrice, the mute found voice.

When recited four times, the lame and the sick, even those long afflicted, all rose to walk.

When recited five times, chronic illnesses and stubborn diseases were instantly restored.

When recited six times, white hair turned black again, fallen teeth regrew.

When recited seven times, the old became strong anew, the young all vigorous.

When recited eight times, pregnant women, birds, and beasts with unborn young, all, whether born or yet to be born, were granted generation.

When recited nine times, the earth’s treasures poured forth, manifesting as golden and jade dew.

When recited ten times, withered bones were revived, all rising as adults.

At that time, no man or woman in the realm did not wholeheartedly incline their hearts, all receiving protection and salvation, universally attaining longevity.

The Dao speaks:

At that time, the Primordial Heavenly Venerable,

Upon reciting the scripture once, the boundless and limitless supreme true great deities of the Eastern Limit, countless hosts without number, floated down from the void.

Upon reciting twice, the boundless and limitless supreme true great deities of the Southern Limit, countless hosts without number, floated down.

Upon reciting thrice, the boundless and limitless supreme true great deities of the Western Limit, countless hosts without number, floated down.

Upon reciting four times, the boundless and limitless supreme true great deities of the Northern Limit, countless hosts without number, floated down.

Upon reciting five times, the boundless and limitless supreme true great deities of the Northeast Limit, countless hosts without number, floated down.

Upon reciting six times, the boundless and limitless supreme true great deities of the Southeast Limit, countless hosts without number, floated down.

Upon reciting seven times, the boundless and limitless supreme true great deities of the Southwest Limit, countless hosts without number, floated down.

Upon reciting eight times, the boundless and limitless supreme true great deities of the Northwest Limit, countless hosts without number, floated down.

Upon reciting nine times, the boundless and limitless supreme true great deities of the Upper Limit, countless hosts without number, floated down.

Upon reciting ten times, the boundless and limitless supreme true great deities of the Lower Limit, countless hosts without number, floated down.

When the ten recitations were complete, the supreme true great deities of the Ten Directions all arrived simultaneously.

The men and women of the realm, with hearts inclined in reverence, came like fine rain and dense mist. The countless hosts, half of the realm’s soil sank and tilted, which could not be prevented. Then the Primordial Venerable suspended a precious pearl, as large as a grain of millet, in the mysterious void, five zhang above the earth.

The Primordial Venerable ascended and led the Celestial Numinous Great Deities, the Supreme Holy Exalted Ones, the Sublime Practitioners of Marvelous Conduct, the supreme true great deities of the Ten Directions, and the countless hosts—all entered into the pearl.

The celestial beings looked up and saw only a vigorous flow entering the pearl’s mouth; once inside, no one knew their whereabouts.

The people of the realm dispersed, the earth returned to level and upright, no longer tilted or sunken.

Within the pearl, the Primordial then finished reciting the scripture; the myriad true beings supervised the salvation and conferred it upon me.

At that time, joy and celebration were beyond words; the ritual was roughly completed, the heavens restored to their places, and in a flash, all was silent without a trace.

At that moment, the celestial beings encountered the scripture’s dharma and universally received salvation.

They completed their years whole and unharmed, the entire realm inclined in reverence, all practicing benevolent hearts: no killing or harming, no envy or jealousy, no licentiousness or theft, no greed or desire, no hatred or slander.

Their words lacked flowery embellishment, their speech bore no harsh tones; all were united in compassion and love, different bones became kin, the realm was peaceful, the people prosperous, rejoicing in great peace.

When the scripture first emerged, it taught a realm in the dao; those with prior aspiration and sincere hearts, who honored and revered it as their lineage, all attained salvation for the world.

The Dao speaks:

At that time, the Primordial Heavenly Venerable,

The words spoken in the scripture are the inner names and hidden rhymes of the celestial emperors above, also the secret taboo names of the demon kings and the hidden names of myriad spirits—not the ordinary words of the world.

The Supreme Holy One, having become a perfected person, comprehends the profound and subtle, able to fully grasp its chapters.

When recited ten times, the heavens chant from afar, myriad emperors arrange rites, rivers and seas fall silent, mountains and peaks hide in clouds, the sun and moon halt their light, the celestial spheres cease their turning, demon shapes are bound, ghostly spirits vanish, the dead rise, white bones become human.

Those who study it, reciting ten times, are guarded by the Five Emperors, the Three Realms bow in homage, demon spirits lose their sight, ghosts and monsters lose their vigor, salvation descends to the dying, death is cut off and life restored.

Therefore, scholars, if your defilements are not yet cleansed, your body not yet penetrated to truth, summoning and commanding the Ten Directions, your power not yet controlling Heaven, your moral virtue able to subdue earthly spirits and bind demon spirits, but yet you die and cannot be reborn—lightly reciting this chapter will bring calamity upon your body.

Yet offering respectful worship and honoring the scripture will cause your gate to flourish, your generations to prosper, your good affinities to grow, no calamities to harm you, the spirits guarding your door.

This scripture is revered and sublime, unrivaled in the Jade Capital, saving countless beings, the ancestor of myriad dao.

The Dao speaks:

Anyone who recites this scripture ten times, the heavens all arrive together, hundreds of millions of ancestors, suffering souls and spirits, all immediately receive salvation and ascend to the Vermilion Palace.

They undergo nine years of transformation, receiving change and rebirth, becoming noble persons.

Those who love to study the scripture, when their功 is fulfilled and virtue complete, all become divine immortals, flying up to the Golden Pavilion, feasting and wandering in the Jade Capital.

Those who cultivate and recite this scripture immediately receive salvation, flying up to the Southern Palace.

Those who recite it in the world extend their lifespan and years; later they all attain the path of corpse liberation, their soul and spirit temporarily extinguished, bypassing hell, immediately regaining form, roaming the vast emptiness.

This scripture is subtle and marvelous, universally saving without end; all celestial beings receive its blessings, immeasurable fortune, life and death covered by grace, treasured by Heaven, not passed down to later generations except to the highest scholars who fast with gold and treasures, pledging their hearts and swearing to Heaven before transmission.

Careless leakage or arrogance brings disaster to nine ancestors, long servitude to ghostly officials.

Attending the scripture are the Five Emperors, Jade Boys and Jade Maidens, each twenty-four in number, arranging and guarding the divine texts, protecting the bodies of those who receive the scripture.

The Dao speaks:

In the first month, during the long fast, recite this scripture.

For the departed souls of past generations, severing earthly bonds and servitude, ascending to the Southern Palace.

In the seventh month, during the long fast, recite this scripture.

The body attains divinity and immortality; the heavens record the name in yellow registers and white slips, erasing death and granting life.

In the tenth month, during the long fast, recite this scripture.

For kings and emperors, lords and ministers, fathers and sons, securing the nation’s longevity, preserving Heaven’s permanence, unbroken through generations, always as rulers, stabilizing their realms, the people acclaiming great peace.

On the eight festival days, recite this scripture.

One attains the status of the Nine Palaces’ True Person.

On one’s birth day, recite this scripture.

The soul and spirit become pure and correct, myriad energies endure long.

Without passing through suffering, the body shines with light.

The Three Realms’ attendants, the Five Emperors’ officers, myriad gods bow in homage, names recorded in Heaven,功 fulfilled and virtue complete, ascending to the Upper Clarity.

The Dao speaks:

On the day of practicing the dao, one must bathe with fragrant water, fast and enter the chamber, facing east, knocking the teeth thirty-two times to communicate with the thirty-two heavens above, bowing the heart thirty-two times, closing the eyes in quiet contemplation:

Sitting amidst clouds of blue, yellow, and white, inside and out enveloped in deep stillness, with the Azure Dragon and White Tiger, Vermilion Bird and Dark Warrior, Lion and White Crane arrayed on left and right, the sun and moon illuminating brightly, the chamber shining with clarity, the neck forming a perfect circle, light reflecting in all Ten Directions, so clear and distinct.

The secret incantation is:

“Supreme Profound Origin, Most High Dao Lord, summon forth from my body the three and five功 officers, the left and right officials, attending Jade Boys and Jade Maidens, the Five Emperors with their talismans, the incense officers of the day, each thirty-two in number, to open and dispel what is spoken.

Today is auspicious and joyous, the long fast cleanses the hall, cultivating the highest scripture, saving countless beings.

May what is opened ascend through the supreme thirty-two heavens to the Primordial Highest Emperor, Most Supreme, before the throne.”

Then, drawing breath thirty-two times, facing east, recite the scripture.

---

### First: The Desire Realm Flying Void Sound

The human path is vast and distant. The immortal path is vast and wild. The ghost path is joyful.

When a person passes the gate of life, the immortal path esteems life, the ghost path esteems the end.

The immortal path is always auspicious. The ghost path is always ominous.

High Upper Clarity spiritual vigor, sad songs resound in the vast emptiness.

Only wishing the immortal path to succeed, not wishing the human path to end.

The Northern Capital Spring Curve Mansion houses myriad ghost hordes, only desiring to obstruct human calculations, severing and cutting off the gate of human life.

---

I have cavern chapters, ten thousand times becoming immortal, the immortal path esteems salvation, the ghost path connects.

The Three Realms joyful, surpassing long enduring, body saved in my realm, form entering nature.

At this time, joy arises, all due to my grace.

Dragon Han vast and expansive, how can one separate truth? My realm is hard to save, thus making cavern texts, transforming flying void, to test your body.

Success or failure, slackness or retreat, how many are saved? Laughing at your failure to save, thus making the song’s beginning.

---

### Third: The Form Realm Demon King’s Song

Above the Three Realms, vast Great Luo, above no color root, cloud layers towering.

Only the Primordial, home of great kalpa.

I govern my realm, commanding the mysterious capital.

Beyond my realm, penetrating the Jade Void.

My position is Supreme King, rectifying and guarding myriad demons.

In the void, myriad changes, defilements scattered like flowers.

Few preserve truth, many are confused.

The immortal path is hard to secure, the ghost path easily errant.

The human path is of the heart, truly not by others.

The immortal path esteems reality, the human path esteems splendor.

If you do not delight in the immortal path, how can the Three Realms be surpassed?

If you desire to turn the Five Paths, how shall I respond?

This is the song and sound of the Demon King above the Three Realms, flying in the void, the sound referencing cavern chapters.

Recite it a hundred times, named salvation in the Southern Palace;

Recite a thousand times, the Demon King protects and welcomes;

Ten thousand times, the dao is complete, flying up to the void,

Surpassing and saving the Three Realms, attaining the rank of Immortal Duke.

Hearing the numinous sound, the Demon King reveres form, commanding earthly deities, attending guards and escorts, pulling open the earth gates, enduring the Five Pains and Eight Hardships, the Seven Ancestors ascending and transferring, forever leaving ghostly officials.

Souls saved in the Vermilion Mound, undergoing refining and rebirth, this is called boundless, universal salvation without end.

There is secret supreme heavenly script, revered by all heavens.

Leaking or arrogance falls to hell, calamity reaching seven ancestor elders.

---

The Dao speaks:

These two chapters are the hidden sounds of the celestial emperors and the numinous demon kings, all words of the Great Brahma, not ordinary worldly words.

The words lack rhyme and beauty, the melodies lack ornamentation and grace, thus called profound and mysterious, hard to seek or detail.

Treasured by Heaven, secret in the mysterious capital, the Purple Tenuity Upper Palace, transmitted once every forty thousand kalpas according to the mysterious method.

If a perfected person fasts with gold and treasures, their heart abiding by the old standard, reporting and pledging to the Ten Heavens, then and only then is it entrusted.

---

The Dao speaks:

Heaven and earth’s cycles also have beginnings and ends; the sun, moon, and five stars also wax and wane; the most holy divine persons also rest and cease; the late learners also suffer illness and injury.

When such calamities arise, all of the same qi should unite their hearts, cultivate fasting, perform incense offerings at the six times, recite the scripture ten times, blessings and virtue immediately descend, dispelling all misfortune.

---

The Dao speaks:

For late learners whose dao is shallow, or whose immortal grade is not yet full, when their destiny is ending, their body passing the Great Yin, at the time of passing, fellow students and perfected persons perform incense offerings and recite the scripture ten times to save the corpse form according to the method.

The soul and spirit directly ascend to the Southern Palace, following their功, counted by days to receive rebirth, the wheel turning unceasingly, thus attaining divinity and immortality.

---

The Dao speaks:

When Heaven and Earth’s cycles end, one must also fast, perform incense, and recite scripture;

When stars and constellations err in their cycles, the sun and moon lose their dusk, one must fast, perform incense, and recite scripture;

When the four seasons lose their order, yin and yang are unbalanced, one must fast, perform incense, and recite scripture;

When the ruler suffers calamity, war and rebellion arise, one must fast, perform incense, and recite scripture;

When epidemics spread, the people die and are injured, one must fast, perform incense, and recite scripture;

When teachers and friends pass away, one must fast, perform incense, and recite scripture.

The功 and virtue of fasting and reciting scripture are exceedingly great, dispelling heavenly disasters above, protecting and stabilizing emperors below, warding off poisons and harms, saving the multitudes, life and death depending on it, blessings hard to surpass.

Therefore it is called boundless, universally saving heaven and man.

---

The Dao speaks:

Whoever has this scripture can act for Heaven and Earth, emperors and multitudes.

On days of calamity, arise with heart to fast, burn incense, recite scripture ten times, all recorded by the heavens, myriad gods attending and guarding, rightfully distinguished among perfected persons, able to become ministers of the Golden Pavilion.

The heavens record one’s功 and faults, not missing a hair’s breadth.

The celestial demon kings also protect and recommend those who attain the dao, this is the profound and clear supreme words.

---

The heavens’ great Brahma hidden language, boundless sounds, composed by the Dao Lord.
