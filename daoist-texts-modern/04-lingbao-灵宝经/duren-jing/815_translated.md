## Preface to the Supreme Wondrous Scripture of Salvation of Beings

I humbly hold that just as fine jade mixed with dust must rely on the skill of grinding and polishing, so too must the profound words hidden within a scripture depend on the art of embellishment and elucidation. Hence, the classics and their transmissions can fully reveal their meaning, as the *Yijing* says: “All images are exhausted.” The numinous mechanism of insight awakens, and the profound principle is thus illuminated.

Reverently considering the *Most High Cavern Profound Numinous Treasure Boundless Salvation of Beings Supreme Wondrous Scripture*, it is a flight of mystery weaving the vital breath, cloud-script forming the text, the root of myriad dharmas, the crown of the Three Caverns. Deep and hidden, it is difficult to seek in detail. Were it not already established in the subtle and profound, who would dare to disorderly expound it in annotations? Moreover, the common folk rarely glimpse its chapters; the arcane teachings strictly forbid false transmission. Though one may recite diligently, none grasp its essence—like ascending a treasure trove, hands empty, circling ink strokes, yet gaining nothing.

Therefore, the Eastern Sea’s Qingyuan Zhenren, moved by this ignorance, greatly proclaimed the grand voice, refuted doubts old and new, established the essential treatise, divided into eight matters, and thoroughly explained two chapters. First clarifying the cause of principle and nature, finally revealing the secret root of fate; opening the blind and explaining the deaf, unfolding the dao to ascend truth, breaking the side-view of attachment, connecting to the highest learning of probing the origin.

Sometimes subtly drawing analogies, sometimes weaving intricate discourse on the profound, akin to the compassionate reverence of the Great Kalpa, the golden mouth speaks no differently. Occasionally including what is yet unexplained, I composed a eulogy to praise its meaning, so that those who recite may delve deeply. Then earth trembles and light bursts forth, everywhere millet pearls appear; through words awakening principle, all diseases of dharma are instantly removed.

This is the source of religion and the fundamental purpose of salvation of beings, hence named Boundless Salvation. Transformed into myriad Daoist disciples, carved and printed widely to benefit the unenlightened—is this not a great remedy for the world?  
Eulogy by the Elder of Qinghe.

### The Most High Cavern Profound Numinous Treasure Boundless Salvation of Beings Supreme Wondrous Scripture

The marvel of the words “Most High” cannot be fully expressed. The undifferentiated whole yet unseparated, this single vital breath is contained within the vague and fleeting, nameless and formless, embodying the numinous unity of the true One—that is its image. “Most” means great, a title of utmost greatness. “High” means honored, dwelling in the supreme position.

In ancient times before Heaven and Earth parted, first arose the Five Greats: the Great Void, Great Origin, Great Simplicity, Great Substance, and Great Ultimate. Once these Five Greats separated, then the Three Talents were established, Heaven and Earth arranged their ranks. The Dao is great, Heaven is great, Earth is great, the sovereign is also great. The Dao attains unity and thus becomes great, hence “Most Great.” The “High” gathers the essence of the Three Talents, thus becoming “High.” The Most High is the ancestor of Dao and virtue, the root of Heaven and Earth, thus marking the head of the scripture.

“Cavern Profound” is the grade of the Three Caverns: Cavern of Truth, Cavern of Profound, Cavern of Spirit. “Cavern” means thorough, penetrating; “Profound” means hidden, wondrous. It refers to the Primordial Origin’s thorough penetration of the non-dual Dao to govern the Numinous Treasure.

The Numinous Treasure is the palace of the Jade Palace Dao Sovereign, who received the vital breath of the Primordial Origin’s Profound Unity, transforming into the Red Bright Kalpa, stationed in the palace of Numinous Treasure. This scripture is the teaching the Dao Sovereign received from the Primordial Origin.

“Numinous” contains and nurtures all things, transformations without end. “Treasure” is bright and translucent, precious to all. This Numinous Treasure is the origin of all transformations, the root of divine light, encompassing the heavens, generating all existence, none not by it.

“Boundless Salvation of Beings” means the Primordial Supreme Sage has, since the Great Kalpa, widely transformed sentient beings, transcending the mundane into the sacred, beyond calculation, from ancient to present, the primordial boundary. The foolish regard it as wise; the dull regard it as intelligent—thus called Boundless Salvation.

“Supreme Grade” refers to the thirty-six divisions within the Three Caverns, governing the Heavenly Dharma Treasury, totaling over three million nine hundred thousand, all taking this scripture as foremost. At the end and beginning of kalpas, it uniquely stands in the Jade Capital, hence Supreme Grade.

“Wondrous” means subtle and marvelous; “Scripture” means the thread and pattern. Also, scripture means path—path for humans and heavens to cultivate, enter the Dao, and leave the mundane, ascending immortality.

---

### Eulogy:

The Great Dao unfolds and weaves the Cavern Profound,  
Saving beings, benefiting all, boundless and vast.  
Mortal bodies wish to become ascenders;  
For me, clear your heart and read the wondrous chapters.

---

### The Dao Speaks:

To see it yet not see is called Dao; to hear it yet not hear is called speech. The Dao as Dao is clear, tranquil, void, and silent, beyond naming or form. Even the Most High does not know it; forced to name it, how can words express it? Only the Most High Dao Sovereign thoroughly understands the subtlety of the Primordial Origin, deeply cultivates the path of Numinous Treasure, using appearances and transformations so that sentient beings may realize the Numinous Treasure, provisionally named speech.

Speech of the Dao is like seeking fish or rabbit by using traps and snares; once fish or rabbit is caught, the trap is forgotten. The Dao is the fish or rabbit of the void and mystery; speech is the trap and snare of the Great Dao. Dao is originally wordless, but because of speech it reveals its use; hence Dao and speech.

---

### Eulogy:

Dao is originally silent—how can there be speech?  
The sage establishes laws and forcibly proclaims.  
To seek fish one must use the trap’s power;  
Once fish is caught, why use the trap?

---

### Collation Commentary:

The *Dao De Jing* says: “There is a thing mixed and formed, born before Heaven and Earth, called Dao.” The Dao is truly the same as Heaven, Earth, and humans; its root lies in the human heart, in the heart is nature. Nature is Dao, Dao is nature. To exhaust nature to destiny is to harmonize form and spirit, uniting with Dao’s truth. The Confucians say: speech is sound. The Dao is the substance of the heart; speech is the function of the heart. The Dao Sovereign expounds the Primordial Origin’s teaching, using the human heart to save beings, hence Dao and speech.

---

### Once, in the Beginning’s Azure Heaven, the Celestial Song of the Vast Floating Terra Resounded, Receiving the *Primordial Boundless Salvation Supreme Grade*.

In the past, countless kalpas were called “past.” The Most High Dao Sovereign said: “In the past at the Primordial Origin, I received this Supreme Grade.” The Beginning Azure is one of the Nine Heavens of the Eastern Great Brahma. The Azure Heaven’s Brahma treasure condensed into this heaven. East is the beginning of all directions. The Celestial Venerable spoke of the Numinous Treasure’s salvation of beings, over one hundred assemblies, first presiding over this heaven, manifesting for all, honoring the meaning of Supreme Grade.

The vital breath of this heaven is blue and green, transforming into azure clouds, spreading far and wide, hence called Azure Fall. The azure breath is stirred by the divine wind, forming the celestial song of emptiness, expressing the subtlety of no emptiness and no color, hence called Celestial Song. This heaven’s country name is Vast Floating Terra. Floating means void; Terra means beautiful. Its breath floats and spreads, solemn and incomparable, thus called Floating Terra. Terra has purity and impurity, but this great country Azure Fall Celestial Song is void, primordial, solemn and beautiful, the foremost pure realm, incomparable to the Three Realms.

The Celestial Venerable said the merit of salvation in this scripture is boundless, hence named *Primordial Boundless Salvation Supreme Grade*.

---

### Eulogy:

Primordial Origin first opens Supreme Grade,  
One sound first issued, all know and hear.  
The lamp of Dharma self-perpetuates through time,  
Not only the Celestial Venerable and Dao Sovereign.

---

### The Primordial Celestial Venerable

“Primordial” means profound. The profound unity, non-dual, profound beyond profound, is the gate of myriad marvels. “Origin” means beginning. The Primordial Origin receives the profound unity of Dao at the very start of the Primordial Origin, before Heaven and Earth, the root of myriad marvels and the beginning of birth, hence called Primordial Origin. “Heaven” is the highest vital breath; “Venerable” is the deepest of all dharmas. When its mist is yet unformed, it stands alone, clear and pure, Heaven and Earth rely on it and it occupies the highest and greatest position, thus named Primordial Celestial Venerable.

---

### Eulogy:

Great mass first divides, one breath mingled,  
Before Heaven and Earth, alone supreme.  
All beings, do not regard as mere emperor,  
This essence has existed since the Great Kalpa.

---

### When the Celestial Venerable was about to expound this scripture, he circled ten times, summoning the Ten Directions, then took his seat.

In the past, when the Celestial Venerable was to speak this scripture, by law he circled ten times, universally summoning the Ten Directions, then took his seat. Ten is the utmost number. By the method of utmost numbers, he summons the spirits of the utmost directions; how could they not come? The vital breath transforms and responds, and so the summons is answered. “Circle” means to pervade and announce; “Return” means to proclaim in reverse and forward order—the principle of summoning and informing is clear. The law responds universally; the Dao is not falsely transmitted. All are the Primordial Origin’s summons of true spirits and souls.

If one guards the lord of the embryo and follows the method of circling ten times, then the thirty-six thousand divine breaths all gather and respond.

---

### Eulogy:

The Celestial Venerable wishes to reveal the profound mystery,  
Law summons all directions to make them know.  
Only for the master to gain steadiness,  
Naturally moving, making people follow.

---

### The Celestial True Great God, the Supreme Sage High Venerable, the Wondrous Practice Perfected Person, countless multitudes of the Boundless.

The Celestial True Great God has transcended the Three Realms, needing no cultivation or proof. The Supreme Sage High Venerable cultivates from beginning to attainment, from attainment to truth. The Wondrous Practice Perfected Person accumulates wonders to become true, naturally united with Dao. “Countless” means their multitudes; all are Primordial Origin’s flying spirits, coming and going unhindered, hence “riding the void.” The Celestial Venerable will expound this scripture, first dividing into three grades: the high truth to encourage, cultivation of truth lies in humans, namely essence, breath, and spirit. If one’s embryonic origin is fixed, myriad breaths are dark and still, nearly no different from the countless multitudes.

---

### Flying clouds in the cinnabar sky, green chariots and jade carriages, feathered canopies shading, flowing essence and jade light, five colors flourishing, illuminating the vast space, seven days and seven nights.

Flying clouds in the cinnabar sky, essence shining in five colors, all are the spirits of the Supreme Sage. When gathered, they form clouds; when dispersed, they become breath. The pure yang is clouds and mist; the pure yin is wheels and canopies. As for flowing essence shining with colors, flourishing and vigorous, illuminating the vast space, all are the marvels of transformation and union. In humans, these are the flowers of the five viscera; refined according to the method, yin and yang numbers suffice, the Numinous Treasure emits light, pouring into the whole body, penetrating the empty scene. Three is yang, four is yin; combined they make seven. The sage’s light and scene revolve; though billions of kalpas pass, they do not extinguish—what need for only seven days and nights? The meaning is the law of yin and yang.

---

### The heavens’ sun, moon, and stars shine clearly; the celestial pivot and jade balance remain still for a time.

From the Great Luo Heaven downward, all heavens have sun, moon, and stars, the mechanism of primordial transformation. The celestial pivot is the Dipper, the jade balance its handle; waxing and waning, growth and decline, day and night proceed without cease, wheels turning endlessly. Now, as the Celestial Venerable speaks the Dharma in stillness, all heavenly creatures temporarily cease movement, manifesting wondrous use. In humans, the heart is the celestial pivot, the eyes are sun and moon; heart and eyes both settled, myriad transformations cease motion.  
*Collation commentary:* The scripture says the sun, moon, celestial pivot, and jade balance stop turning. This is also a provisional teaching by means of appearance. Qingyuan’s annotation says that when the human heart and eyes are both settled, all transformations cease—this is truly the gateway to initial meditation practice. According to *The Holy Chronicle of Laozi*: “Constantly practice stopping and observing to examine the heart”—this is the meaning.

---

### Divine wind is silent, mountains hide clouds, the sky is free of floating haze, the four breaths are bright and clear.

The Celestial Venerable is in stillness; all realms are void and primordial. Yin and yang harmonize; wind, clouds, and weather naturally clear and pure. By wisdom observing the body, if conditions do not move, then inhalations and exhalations are peaceful and steady—what breath would not be clear?

---

### Eulogy:

Divine wind silent, sea without cloud,  
Heaven and Earth clear, four breaths pure.  
If a single condition were to move in vain,  
The celestial pivot would again not cease turning.

---

### Collation commentary:

The four breaths are not detailed in the scripture’s annotation. The scholar Guotang in *Record of the Great Brightness of the Buddha Dharma* discusses the four truths, citing this passage. The clarity of the four breaths is the four truths: true permanence, true self, true bliss, true purity—to reveal the subtle fusion of nature and life, hence attached here.

---

### A country’s land, mountains, rivers, forests, and trees are all evenly balanced, no high or low; the earth is all jade, without differing colors. The myriad truths attend the seat.

Symbolically, a country’s land is the Floating Terra. From the Daoist view, all heaven and earth are the Primordial Origin’s one country. Mountains, rivers, forests, and trees are uneven, with flourishing and withering, and earth is pure or impure. Now, in the midst of teaching, all is equal, pure jade form, no distinction. The myriad truths arrayed attending the seat—just observe this effect, what a scene! In humans, mountains, rivers, forests, and trees are all present; with fixed power and one observation, all dust ceases, all equal and balanced like flawless jade—how could there be high or low? It depends only on the heart. If the heart is not balanced, then heaps and mounds arise.

---

### Eulogy:

One country’s mountains and rivers dwell within the self,  
In fixed observation, all is calm and even.  
Pure jade color, originally no difference,  
High and low arise only from false wrapping.

---

### Collation commentary:

The scripture says “evenly balanced, no high or low” and “no differing colors”—these are provisional appearances and teachings. The *Diamond Sutra* says: “This Dharma is equal, no high or low.” Master Huangbo explains: “If the heart is equal, not distinguishing high or low, then it is equal to all beings, Buddhas, worlds, mountains, rivers, forms and formless, throughout the Ten Directions, no self-other distinction; this is the original pure heart, always perfectly bright and illuminating.” The meaning is the same, hence attached here.

---

### The Primordial Celestial Venerable suspends himself sitting on a five-colored lion floating in the void.

First, by Dao and Dharma, he summons the myriad truths; next, by fixed power, he equalizes the false and true. When true and false cease, one ultimately ascends the Profound. This is the meaning of suspending and sitting in the void. “Suspending” means unfathomable; “floating” means boundless. Suspended means profound; void means empty. Profound and void while sitting, not attached to true form.

The lion is king among beasts, signifying the master of the Dharma. Subduing all beasts, it represents the Celestial Venerable’s fearless transformation of beings, subduing all demons, enabling ascent to the Dao realm. The five colors signify the five senses of heaven and humans: eye, ear, nose, tongue, body; color, sound, fragrance, taste, touch—the root of illusion. Cultivators must first subdue these and sit upon them.

Though the Celestial Venerable ascends this seat, his body floats in the void, intending to make people empty their hearts and externalize their form; only then does the Dao respond, becoming the root of transcendence.

---

### Eulogy:

The Dharma body is tranquil, originally true and constant,  
Seeking color and form is madness at heart.  
An empty heart is the floating seat,  
Right intention is called the king of beasts.

---

### Upon one recitation, all great saints of the heavens simultaneously acclaim “Good!” At the second recitation, the deaf in the country have their ears opened and become hearing. At the third, the blind have their eyes enlightened. At the fourth, the mute can speak. At the fifth, the lame and sick can all rise and walk. At the sixth, chronic diseases are suddenly healed. At the seventh, the elderly regain youth, the young become strong. At the eighth, women conceive, birds and beasts bear offspring, both born and unborn obtain generation. At the ninth, the earth storehouse manifests golden jade dew forms. At the tenth, dry bones regenerate, all rise as adults. At that time, all men and women of the country wholeheartedly receive protection and salvation, all attaining longevity.

The Celestial Venerable’s recitation is not merely a single recitation with mental focus, but a grand proclamation of the great Dharma. Thus, after one recitation, all great saints of the heavens arrive according to their grades and attain rebirth. From fear and joy arise praises, all voices simultaneously issuing forth, hence called “Good.” The meaning of ten recitations corresponds to the hexagrams and transformations.

For example, the first recitation summons the Eastern Boundless Boundless Grade Supreme Great God and countless multitudes; the hexagram corresponds to the East with Zhen trigram, shaking a hundred miles, so deaf ears open. The second summons the South, corresponding to Li trigram; Li means brightness of all things, so blind eyes open. The third summons the West, corresponding to Dui trigram; Dui means speech, so the mute can speak. The fourth summons the North, corresponding to Kan trigram; Kan means stopping things. Though not a complete stop, stopping yet moving, so lame and sick can walk. The fifth summons the Northeast, corresponding to Gen trigram; Gen means end and beginning, so chronic diseases are healed. The sixth summons the Southeast, corresponding to Xun trigram; Xun means purity, so white hair returns black, fallen teeth regrow. The seventh summons the Southwest, corresponding to Kun trigram; Kun governs nurturing, so the old regain strength, the young become strong. The eighth summons the Northwest, corresponding to Qian trigram; Qian governs correct nature and life, preserving harmony; so women conceive, birds and beasts bear offspring, both born and unborn obtain generation. The ninth summons the earth storehouse to manifest golden jade dew forms. The ninth yang arises spontaneously, manifesting form complete; having obtained life, it again touches the earth storehouse to open and manifest, all obtain precious golden jade, transforming foul decay into marvel. The tenth recitation’s number is utmost, reversing the old decayed nature, regenerating adults.

If beings have ear diseases, they cannot hear the Dao; eye diseases, cannot see the Dao; tongue diseases, cannot proclaim the Dao; foot diseases, cannot walk the Dao; chronic diseases, cannot advance cultivation. Therefore, the Celestial Venerable recites four times to pacify their roots. By the tenth recitation, they return to the origin and primordial. The merit of salvation is thus complete. When merit is full and Dao attained, all diseases of Dharma are instantly removed, hence all attain longevity, wholeheartedly devoted to the realm of supreme Dao.

The scripture’s commentary explains the nine recitations; thus, this is appended with Xue Youqi’s annotations.

---

### Eulogy:

The body must rely on six roots,  
When root and nature are confused, illness invades.  
Just from the ear’s first understanding,  
Instantly no disease, attaining longevity.

---

### The Dao says: At the first recitation, the Primordial Celestial Venerable speaks, summoning the Eastern Boundless Boundless Grade Supreme Great God and multitudes, floating to the scene. At the second, the South, at the third, the West, at the fourth, the North, at the fifth, the Northeast, at the sixth, the Southeast, at the seventh, the Southwest, at the eighth, the Northwest, at the ninth, the Upper, and at the tenth, the Lower Boundless Boundless Grade Supreme Great God and multitudes, all floating to the scene.

The Celestial Venerable speaks the Dharma, circling ten times, summoning true spirits and souls, carrying and saving beings. Though the words repeat, this scripture’s essence is salvation of beings, first manifesting efficacy, then showing the special appearances of confusion and response. The Dao Sovereign’s great intention is thus; it is not two separate ten recitations.

The Ten Directions’ worlds, all heavens and all countries, all myriad truths, all Boundless Boundless Grades, all receive the supreme true breath, dwelling in the utmost great realm. Spirits dwell within, their transformed bodies boundless, floating to the Celestial Venerable’s place, also the Primordial Origin’s natural breath responding and transforming with fixed names.

The Eastern and Northeast highest Chan goodness, Boundless Longevity Heaven, Great Bright Jade Complete Heaven, etc., up to the nine lands, the Zhen Palace Mao position, are the multitudes. The South and Southeast are Brahma Monitor Xu Yan Heaven to the Red Bright and Harmonious Yang Heaven, Li Palace Wu position. The West and Southwest are Spirit Transformation Brahma Assistant Heaven, Yuan Zai Kong Sheng Heaven to the nine lands and nine waters, Dui Palace You position. The North and Northwest are High Void Clear Bright Heaven, Hao Ting Xiao Du Heaven to the Kan Palace Zi position. The Upper and Lower directions have many winds and waters, multitudes beyond count; now briefly mentioned.

At the beginning, the Primordial Origin spoke Dharma in the Clear Subtle Heavenly Palace; the Jade Emperor arrived before the assembly, displaying six supernatural powers, emitting great light, illuminating the Boundless Brahma realms, then divided his body to show the heavenly palaces. Now each palace manifests the Jade Capital golden gate, bright treasure throne. Each treasure throne has a transformed Jade Emperor; each Jade Emperor expounds the path of liberation in their direction. These heavens do not each have a Jade Emperor; this is a teaching to show the division of true and transformed, the descent of true manifestations.

---

### Eulogy:

Since there have been countless spirits,  
Like echoes in empty valleys.  
The Ten Directions’ sun, moon, and sky appear,  
Only if one’s Dao eye opens.

---

### After the ten recitations, all the Boundless Heavens gather simultaneously. Men and women of a country incline their hearts in reverence; the coming is like fine rain and dense mist. The multitudes of the Boundless, half the country’s land is uneven, not to be restrained.

After the ten recitations, the Ten Directions all assemble. Then the celestial beings and men and women feel this divine transformation, incline their hearts in devotion, reverence and come, like fine rain flying in the sky, dense mist enclosing all around. Hence half the country is uneven and many. Because Floating Terra is a limited land, and the Celestial Venerable manifests the multitudes of the Boundless, approaching the limited land of Ze, the principle is incompatible, hence the phrase “uneven and sunken.” “Uneven and sunken” means the celestial beings have not heard the ultimate principle; their hearts are narrow, confused without limit, unable to stop their restlessness.

---

### Then the Primordial Origin suspends a treasure pearl, as large as a millet grain, in the void, five zhang above the earth.

“Treasure” is what people love; “pearl” is pure, round, and bright; “millet grain” is the smallest thing with the widest use. This symbolizes the Numinous Treasure’s body is tiny but its use vast, pure and bright, loved by all. Also, millet is the chief grain, the source of human life, not to be lacking even briefly, showing humans cannot be without the Dao. To be apart from this is like a person without food—not a body.

Suspended in the void, five zhang above the earth, shows the Numinous Treasure’s marvel, not bound by the five movements, hidden in the Great Profound, showing humans and heavens transcend the five impurities, entrusting marvels to the numinous void.

---

### Eulogy:

One pearl like millet grain,  
Everyone has it but not the Primordial Origin.  
Neither high nor low, suspended in the void,  
Who can grasp the Celestial Venerable’s meaning?

---

### The Primordial Origin ascends, leading the Celestial True Great God, Supreme Sage High Venerable, Wondrous Practice Perfected Person, the Ten Directions’ Boundless Supreme Great Gods and multitudes, all enter the pearl.

Heavenly beings look up, only seeing vibrant sounds entering the pearl’s mouth; once inside, their location is unknown. The country’s people disperse and vanish, the land returns to level, no longer tilted or sunken.

To see but not see is called “flat”; to hear but not hear is called “rare”; to grasp but not grasp is called “subtle.” These three cannot be questioned, returning to non-being. The Dao’s subtlety is based on void and the celestial true body—how could there be obstruction? But because celestial beings and saints gather mixed, the land is uneven and sunken, impossible to restrain. Thus, to embody transformation and human change, suspending the pearl responds to change, returning the formless to non-being.

Ascending means rising and climbing; leading means pointing and guiding. The multitudes of the Boundless have united with the Dao’s truth, thus able to follow the Celestial Venerable into the pearl. But celestial beings have burdens and cannot accompany. Then true and false bodies, cultivation and proof differences become visible. The Dao again hides; traces cannot be pursued. The land disperses and levels, no longer tilted or sunken. This all is the Primordial Origin’s divine manifestation, from non-being to being, from being to non-being, mixing myriad gods’ Dao, incomparable to mere technique.

---

### Eulogy:

The sage’s Dharma nature is originally void,  
Gather and disperse with no difference of same or other.  
All realms return to the true still realm,  
Where else can one seek remaining traces?

---

### The Primordial Origin then within the pearl, after completing the scripture, the myriad truths supervise salvation and bestow it upon me.

At this time, joy and celebration are unspeakable. The Dharma rites are roughly complete; the heavens return to their places, suddenly the sound ceases, the silent primordial echo remains.

The Celestial Venerable having led the myriad truths to ascend and enter the marvel within the pearl, transmits the Dao and Dharma to the Most High Dao Sovereign. The myriad truths all come to supervise salvation. The Dao Sovereign receives the Dharma; joy and celebration are beyond words. The Dharma rites mean the giving and receiving of the Dharma. Though the matter is roughly complete, before its end, all heavens return to their places. Why? Because the path of Numinous Treasure is not in complexity but in obtaining essentials; saints transmit to saints, one hearing awakens a thousand insights, this meaning is inexhaustible. Whenever there is a brief moment, silent and without sound, it shows the supreme Dao returns to the ordinary.

---

### Eulogy:

This numinous root is fundamentally free,  
The Celestial Venerable personally entrusts it to whom?  
Like finding a treasure in the Dragon Palace,  
Lock it in the golden chest, do not let it be lost.

---

### Collation Commentary:

The metaphor of the pearl five zhang above the earth is for those who have realized destiny and cultivation, to show the mysterious pass within the body. Five zhang means a zhang as a ruler, a ruler as a foot; this explanation is apt. The annotation uses this metaphor for the marvelous pearl of nature, its meaning profound.

Above, the Primordial Origin ascends, leading the Celestial True Great God and the Boundless multitudes into the pearl, while celestial beings only look up, unable to accompany, distinguishing true and false bodies, cultivation and proof differences. Only those truly seeing and witnessing the Dao can enter the pearl’s pure bright realm—this is especially relevant to realization of nature.

Five zhang symbolizes transcendence of the five impurities, not bound by the five movements. This explanation also applies.

At the end, in a moment, silent with no lingering sound, it shows proof of self-completion, returning to oneness and non-being.

The Confucian *Doctrine of the Mean* speaks of the utmost of no sound and no smell; Buddhist scriptures speak of emptiness of person and dharma, emptiness of emptiness, all this meaning. Thus appended here.

---

### At this time, celestial beings and humans encounter the Dharma and universally receive salvation, completing their original lifespan without injury.

“Heaven” means heaven; “human” means worldly people. These terms interchange to connect to the common folk. Whether encountered or met, all universally receive salvation, completing their original lifespan without premature death or harm.

Moreover, human birth all receives the marvelous Dao, precious beyond words, without distinction of high or low, all living a hundred years. Whether by past causes or future karma, some prematurely shorten their lifespan, unable to reach their original years—not due to Heaven’s partiality.

Ordinary human lifespan above ninety is called “upper longevity”; below seventy is “midlife”; below fifty is “premature death.” In Nanchang there are those who accumulate good deeds and gain upper longevity; upon death they first receive refinement and salvation; otherwise, their bodies sink awaiting.

---

### All the people incline their hearts in reverence, all practice good hearts: no killing, no harm; no jealousy, no envy; no lust, no theft; no greed, no desire; no hatred, no grasping; no vanity or show; no evil speech; all equal in compassion and love, different bones becoming kin. The country is peaceful, the people abundant, joyful and at peace.

Thoughts, sights, and sounds are all killing; falling into injustice and harming all things is harm; destroying others’ success is jealousy; seeing others’ prosperity with crooked heart is envy; deluded attachment to appearances is lust; taking unjustly is theft; endless love and pleasure is greed; arising false thoughts is desire; biting and spitting cleverness or clumsiness is hatred; speaking without regulation, shallow learning harming others is evil speech.

Now the country’s men and women have received protection and salvation, thus incline their hearts in reverence and act oppositely—also called the twelve good deeds.

No killing, no harm, no lust, no theft remove bodily sins. No jealousy, no envy, no greed, no desire, no hatred, no biting remove mental sins. No vanity, no evil speech remove verbal sins. Previously, ears hear and eyes see; now three karmas are instantly removed, thus forming acts of compassion and love.

Compassion means gentle and harmonious, not quarrelsome. Love means mutual tolerance, benefiting self and others. The greatness of compassion and love is that though bones differ, they become kin; then the country is peaceful, the people abundant, forgetting self and other in the land of Dao and virtue, rejoicing in the age of peace.

Pure stillness and constant joy is called “great”; quiet and desireless is called “peace.” The country symbolizes the body; the people symbolize the vital breath.

---

### When the scripture first issued its teaching, a country with a determined heart reverently upheld rites and all were saved.

This means the Dao Sovereign first received this scripture, teaching a country with prior resolve, all reverently upholding rites. “Upholding” means revering this scripture as boat and oar, bridge and beam, relying on it to seek salvation. “Respecting” means honoring this scripture as if the Celestial Venerable personally taught me, I personally heard its meaning, intending to recite its words and practice its deeds. “Rites” means ritual affairs for this scripture, like father, mother, teacher, elder—between fear and love, fearing neglect. “Reverence” means holding this scripture like gold and treasure, pearl and jade, cherishing it without end, fearing loss.

Having fulfilled these four hearts, all attain salvation and longevity.

---

### Eulogy:

Circling ink strokes vainly toil the form,  
One must practice good deeds and act by precepts.  
Longevity and salvation need no other,  
Only cultivate and hold one sincere heart.

---

### The Dao says: What the Primordial Celestial Venerable says in the scripture are the hidden sounds of the heavens’ supreme deities, also the secret names of demon kings, the hidden names of myriad spirits—not common worldly words. The Supreme Sage has become a perfected person, penetrating the profound subtlety, able to understand all chapters.

Reciting it ten times, the heavens sing afar, myriad emperors arrange rites, rivers and seas are silent, mountains hide clouds, sun and moon stop their course, the celestial pivot does not turn, demon spirits are bound, ghosts vanish, corpses rise from death, white bones become flesh.

The thirty-two heavenly emperors are the hidden names. The Azure Emperor protects souls to the flowing bell’s eight shocks, the demon king’s secret name. The immortal gods below, to Tao Kang and He Yan, are all hidden names of myriad spirits.

The Numinous Treasure is the ancestor breath of Dao’s vital breath, salvation is the first of all dharmas. The Primordial Origin contains the marvelous Dao, issuing the Dharma to save beings, dispersing words, forming sounds and rhythms, incomparable to later writings. Lower and middle immortals cannot glimpse its chapters; only the Supreme Sage perfected in the Dao’s marvel can penetrate the subtlety.

The sounds and rhythms mean harmonious tones. Also, the heavens, myriad emperors, sun, moon, mountains, rivers all arise from the ancestor breath’s dispersion into form and substance. Now the Celestial Venerable speaks Dharma, thus the ancestor breath’s sound gathers the dispersed breath’s substance, how could it not respond? Hence clouds hide and conceal, three lights stop and rest, demons vanish and spirits perish, returning to origin and root—all arise from fixed stillness. Like the summoning of yin and yang by musical notes, this is inevitable principle.

---

### Eulogy:

Penetrate the profound subtlety, recognize the Dao’s root,  
Mountains, rivers, sun, and moon are one family’s wind.  
Not boasting the Numinous Treasure,  
Truly the perfected person’s fixed realm.

---

### The highest learners recite it ten times; then the five emperors guard, the Three Realms bow, demon spirits lose eyes, ghosts vanish, salvation descends to the dying, severing death to gain life.

Because scholars’ defilements are not yet eliminated, their bodies not yet penetrate truth, summoning the Ten Directions, their might not yet control heavenly governance, virtue can subdue earth spirits, bind demon spirits, but only repel death, cannot regenerate.

Diligent and unrelenting effort is called highest learning. Thus reciting the scripture ten times, the five emperors of the five directions come to guard, the Three Realms’ spirits bow and submit, all demons lose eyes and vanish.

Now the scholar’s cultivation reaches utmost, body refined, breath quiet, all spirits guard the body, never departing—the so-called spirit-consciousness self-guarding. The Three Realms symbolize three corpses; the five emperors symbolize the five viscera. If myriad conditions arise, these are inner demons; if suffering presses, these are outer demons. The severe suffering is called essence, thus demon essence. The seven emotions and six desires are called ghosts; agitation and confusion obstruct Dao and virtue, called demons.

With highest learning and scripture recitation, all are not invaded. Even at great end, able to repel killing ghosts and demons, can stay this life, but only repel earth spirits, cannot change this body to longevity.

Though reciting scripture for millions of kalpas, ultimately belongs to emptiness. Because perfected persons unite with Dao; highest learners have not exhausted dust emotions, so reciting scripture differs by grade.

Thus, due to illusion and falsehood, ultimately not true, small kalpas can be escaped, but at kalpa’s end all is destroyed. Because Dao is incomplete, not possessing true permanence, defilements not eliminated. The body is temporarily firm, unable to penetrate true realm, so no power, unable to summon the Ten Directions. “Governance” means the seven planetary governors.

---

### Eulogy:

Escaping impermanence, lifespan extended,  
Calculations show not leaving illusion’s immortal.  
Shallow-rooted scholars, do not lightly be fooled,  
Refining the body aims to ascend the Nine Heavens.

---

### Light recitation of this chapter harms the body; offering respect and rites brings flourishing, prosperity for generations, and protection from myriad calamities by divine spirits.

This scripture is revered and wondrous, uniquely standing in the Jade Capital, boundless salvation, root of myriad Dao. Lofty and vast, its virtue is hard to surpass.

If one recites or encounters it without strict purity; or merely toys with it; or with distracted mind; or lectures improperly; or indiscriminately grants it—these are all light offenses. This scripture is treasured by myriad heavens, most urgent for salvation, hidden and sacred, born of life and death, dispelling disasters and averting calamities, protecting and stabilizing nations and families, all by it. If lightly recited, the body suffers harm. “Harm” means continuous and unending—should one not beware?

Also, establishing offering, respect, and rites to connect to the common folk, bringing flourishing and prosperity, with good causes green, myriad calamities not touching, divine spirits guarding the gate—these are the common person’s universal merits from the scripture.

This scripture’s wondrousness is formed by Brahma breath, gathering and dispersing; though great kalpas intersect, Heaven and Earth collapse, this text alone endures, majestic and true, the great Dharma of myriad heavens, its virtue beyond words. The Jade Capital is the Jade Capital Mountain, above the Great Luo Heaven, with golden towers and jade halls. True texts and secret scripts pervade it; this scripture stands alone.

---

### Eulogy:

Immortals pass down mouth to mouth,  
Do not lightly doubt or treat as trivial.  
All things change with mulberry seas,  
This text alone stands supreme in Great Luo.

---

### The Dao says: Whoever recites this scripture ten times, all heavens arrive, countless ancestors, suffering souls and spirits all receive salvation, ascending to the Vermilion Palace. The grade is nine years; receiving transformation and rebirth, becoming noble persons.

“Whoever” does not distinguish high or low. Countless ancestors since beginningless time, gathering bodies and births, parents, ancestors, and forebears. When people recite the scripture, all heavenly emperors arrive before them, responding to countless lingering souls and spirits, long detained and suffering, all receiving salvation, ascending to the Vermilion Official.

In the Southern Red Heaven world is Nanchang Upper Palace, with the Vermilion Mound’s mansion, the court of flowing fire, the place of refining and salvation of immortals. Those ascending pass through this palace, receive the three fires’ great refinement, burn away the five impurities and filthy form, refine their breath and body with the jade eye’s light; next wash the corpse with yellow flower water; then govern and nurture the spirit truth, according to their karmic transformation, thus reborn.

There are three grades of refining and salvation: upper learning three years to receive salvation; middle wisdom nine years; lower learning twenty-four years. Now by the power of scripture recitation, countless ancestors all receive middle grade transformation, reborn as noble persons, then from noble middle cultivate learning, thus obtaining ascent and salvation.

Those who love and cherish learning the scripture, when merit is full and virtue complete, all become immortals, ascending the golden towers, roaming and feasting in the Jade Capital. Upper learning scholars who cultivate and recite this scripture all receive salvation, ascending to the Southern Palace.

To love and not abandon, to remember and not forget, is called loving learning. Loving learning this scripture means cultivating the Numinous Treasure heart, practicing salvation of beings. When merit is full and virtue complete, they ascend together with ancestors who have attained the immortal Dao, hence all. Ascending the golden towers, paying homage to the Most High, roaming and feasting in the Jade Capital realm. Upper learning means refined cultivation of supreme Dao, reaching marvels beyond the crowd.

Cultivating means practice; reciting means chanting scripture. Both together, merit high and virtue weighty, thus not limited by grade, directly ascending to Southern Red and receiving refinement.

---

### Eulogy:

Cultivate the Numinous Treasure, heart firm,  
Recite the scripture, intent focused.  
Cultivate and recite both, great merit,  
Instantly lightly rise as immortal.

---

### Worldly people who receive and recite extend lifespan and years; later all attain the path of corpse liberation. The soul and spirit temporarily extinguish, not passing through hell, immediately returning to form, roaming the vast space.

By past merits and good causes, they are born into human or heavenly realms. When the orthodox teaching flourishes, those who encounter this scripture, receive and recite it, immediately gain long years, enjoy worldly lifespan, yet cannot avoid death and decay of the body. Though dead, the spirit does not perish, called corpse liberation. Like Yang Wangsun, Ji Kang, Guo Pu—all gave up the body to return to truth.

Thus, those who practice corpse liberation have bright eyes and light bones, or essence and blood unchanged. Their corpses cast into famous mountains and great rivers can produce pearls and jade. Those who recite the scripture, cultivate the Numinous Treasure heart, hold salvation of beings, will surely extend years, later attain corpse liberation. The soul and spirit temporarily extinguish, no longer passing through hell, immediately returning to form in the vast space. If shallow learning and slight merit, cannot fly with flesh and bones, inevitably corpse liberation returns only the spirit.

---

### Eulogy:

A hundred years, a house cannot remain new,  
Things transform, time changes owners.  
Dao and virtue cultivated over a thousand days,  
Right and wrong return to a pile of dust.

---

### This scripture is subtle and wondrous, universally saving without end; all heavens and humans receive celebration and boundless blessings, life and death both receive grace.

Disasters above are dispelled, calamities below removed; boundless blessings pervade, death and life all benefit.

Treasured by the heavens, not transmitted to later generations. The highest ones bear golden treasures, pledging heart and oath to Heaven to transmit. Careless leakage and negligence brings harm to nine ancestors, long servitude to ghost officials.

The highest perfected ones report to court and come and go, always chanting this scripture, most treasured, not transmitted to later generations. Because later sages earnestly begged to transmit it to preserve against the great flood of Jia Shen year, thus saints transmit it, not to common folk. Only those with resolve, bearing golden treasures, pledging heart and oath to the heavens, may be transmitted.

Why? People love only gold and treasure, also firm and strong things. The Most High sets this to make people abandon what they love, break stingy hearts. By this renouncing heart turning to the Great Dao, then transmission is heard and practiced. Also shows the heart is firm as gold and stone. If careless or leaking, then harm reaches nine ancestors, long bound to ghost officials, like pushing tides and beating waves, carrying stones to fill rivers.

---

### Eulogy:

Primordial Origin speaks subtle meaning,  
Raising laws to save heavenly folk.  
The human heart itself is a prison,  
Learn to lock and guard one scripture.

---

### The Five Emperors attending the scripture, twenty-four jade boys and girls each, arrange and guard the sacred text, protecting the recipient’s body.

The five emperors of the five directions each command twenty-four jade boys and girls, totaling one hundred and twenty, who arrange and guard this text, protecting the person’s body.

---

### The Dao says: On the first month’s long fast, reciting this scripture cuts off the earth’s binding, liberates the upper Southern Palace’s departed souls. On the seventh month’s long fast, reciting this scripture grants the body immortality; the heavens record names; golden and white registers erase death and grant life. On the tenth month’s long fast, reciting this scripture is for kings, emperors, lords, ministers, fathers and sons, to stabilize the nation’s fortune, preserve Heaven’s longevity, unbroken through generations, always rulers, stabilizing their domains, people call it peace.

All beings who do all good deeds, blessings reach nine ancestors; if already born human or heavenly, increase blessings; if not yet born heavenly, ascend according to breath. If all evil deeds, disasters reach seven ancestors, calamities link descendants; such people die in the underworld; due to accumulated sins, linked to birth and repeated calamities.

The first month is the head of the four seasons, Heaven and Earth in harmony, all things reborn. At this long fast reciting scripture, riding the Heavenly Official’s examination, can save departed souls of the upper world, cutting off the earth’s binding suffering, ascending to the Southern Palace’s office.

The seventh month is the time of all things’ completion; at this long fast reciting scripture, riding the middle yuan’s merit of raising good, the body attains immortality; heavens record names in golden and white registers, erasing death’s register, separately noting the living name—this is the immortal.

The North and South two officials must first erase death and raise life, then ascent and salvation are possible; without this, no success.

The tenth month is the time of Heaven and Earth’s calm and rest; at this long fast reciting scripture, riding the lower yuan’s merit of release and fall, thus suitable for nation and people, praying for blessings and averting disasters.

As the True One Perfected says: One must serve nation and family, promote benefit and remove harm, then serve the Three Realms without shame.

This is called the boundless salvation’s root.

To remember constantly without forgetting for a long time is called “long.” To guard the heart with quiet thought, cautious and unstained, is called “fasting,” hence “long fast.”

---

### Eulogy:

On auspicious days and good times, recite well,  
Do not let worldly worries entangle the heart.  
Saving beings and benefiting all, merit completed,  
Golden registers and jade books record the name.

---

### On the eight seasonal days, reciting this scripture grants becoming a Nine Palaces Perfected Person. On one’s birth day, reciting this scripture purifies soul and spirit, all breath endures, no suffering, body shines, Three Realms guard, Five Emperors escort, myriad gods pay homage, name inscribed in Heaven, merit full, virtue complete, ascending Upper Purity.

The eight days are: Beginning of Spring, Spring Equinox, Beginning of Summer, Summer Solstice, Beginning of Autumn, Autumn Equinox, Beginning of Winter, Winter Solstice. On these days, the Heavenly Venerable of Great Unity commands officials to record all people’s sins, merits, and deeds; merits are raised, faults punished.

Reciting scripture on these days rides the protection and promotion merit, thus becoming a Nine Palaces Perfected Person.

One’s birth day, the whole spirit is clear and correct, aligned with one’s star official, recording merits and faults, reporting to the Northern Dipper’s sun.

Reciting scripture on this day purifies soul and spirit, all breath endures. When breath endures, suffering ceases; when suffering ceases, spirit light naturally shines. When thoughts move, demons arise; when breath is clear, demons rest. Thus Three Realms’ demon kings guard, not for external affairs.

When reciting scripture and maintaining mindfulness, officials and gods emerge from the crown of the head; after the matter, return through myriad gates. Hence Five Emperors escort and receive. Myriad gods assemble to pay homage, inscribing names in Heaven; when merit is full, spirit ascends to Upper Purity.

---

### Eulogy:

If one says reciting makes a perfected person,  
Each will doubt and not necessarily believe.  
Not knowing that when breath endures and spirit is correct,  
Within the body is boundless light.

---

### Collation Commentary:

*Numinous Treasure Pure Bright Salvation Scripture Dharma*, transmitted by Master Xu Zhenjun of the Nine Provinces, Grand Historian and Great Envoy. “Myriad spirits do not disperse” means numinous; “one breath facing the origin” means treasure; “fine dust not soiled” means pure; “no darkness unilluminated” means bright. Receiving the Dharma means loyal and filial disciples.

There are ten precepts:  
One, never forget the Eight Extremes. Loyalty is reverence’s extreme; filial piety is obedience’s extreme; integrity is purity’s extreme; caution is vigilance’s extreme; generosity is broadness’s extreme; abundance is joy’s extreme; tolerance is harmony’s extreme; patience is wisdom’s extreme.  
Two, never forget the mirror water. Mirror means heart; water means nature. When heart is bright, all dharmas are reflected; when nature is pure, the five impurities do not return.  
Three, never forget the daily record. The daily record is for examining good and evil. Now using the daily record to note deeds, anything not to be written is one’s own fault; correcting it is precious.  
Four, never forget to pursue salvation and stabilization. Pursuing means reciting scripture and performing talismans for ancestors and six relatives past, to aid the underworld path. Salvation means reciting scripture and talismans for ancestors and six relatives living, to aid blessings and calculations. Stabilization means reciting scripture and talismans, blessing kings, emperors, and saints, stabilizing the four directions.  
Five, never forget healing. Healing arts begin with compassion. For the sick, recite scripture and perform talismans sincerely to dispel, as for one’s own parents; all men and women have methods, various benefits, all with full heart.  
Six, never forget taking medicine and refining. The art of taking medicine and refining follows Heaven and Earth, imitating yin and yang; every thought is true and genuine, always complete, thus naturally transcending and transforming without limit.  
Seven, never forget firmness and purity. Firmness means guarding, not acting improperly; purity means avoiding pollution, not greedy or improper eating; no lust means no damage to spirit; avoiding improper food means not killing life.  
Eight, never forget frugality. All clothing and food should be known as born from the Primordial Ancestor’s breath; wash away impurities with ash water; do not decorate; eat millet and wheat to fill hunger, not delicacies.  
Nine, never forget vows and restrictions. Vows are the heart set at the beginning of the Dao; restrictions are the oaths set by beginners. Heaven, Earth, and spirits govern them; do not easily change; the Cavern Spirit has rules, must be cautious.  
Ten, never forget teachers and friends. Teachers teach; friends encourage. Those who teach are like fathers; those who encourage are like brothers. Who among father and brothers can be disrespected and abandoned?  

Also says: Those who obtain this Dharma, upper ones ascend; next save the world; or attain corpse liberation. The key is observing the heart; no heart then see true heart; observing form; no form then see true form. Heart and form both without eyes; the formless Dao is great stillness, spirit light clear, seeing the Jade Pure realm—this is the method of ascent.

Also according to *Chapter on Ascending Truth and Knowing Spirit*: Learning Dao to transcend truth, riding clouds to ascend, heavenly books descend, immortal officials receive and escort. Who are the immortal officials? The perfected persons, twin dragons pulling carriages, strong men holding banners, front shouting and back guarding, mighty heavenly soldiers, jade boys and girls holding ribbons and seals, small officials transmitting imperial commands. Here no fear, no alarm, naturally soul and spirit are refined in the Vermilion Mound.

The Vermilion Mound’s great general is the flowing golden fire bell, entering Heaven’s realm. Heaven has four gates: East Flower Gate, gate official in charge; inside is the master judge, the Yuan Lord of the Day; inside are two recorders, revered spirits; inside are three gatekeepers, Vajra strongmen, three true immortals, who ask your name, examine your sins and merits, without error; only then may you enter.

Two recorders lead you upward; Southern and Northern Dipper each have true lords; after recorders withdraw, true lords escort you, successively reporting to the Purple Tenuity court. At this time, the immortal path is formed, bowing to the Great Luo Primordial Jade Pure Vast Heaven Jade Emperor’s Three Realms.

The Celestial Venerable cannot be seen, only auspicious clouds; jade boys transmit orders, as if audible; bestowing elixirs, golden pendants, and pearl tassels. If you obtain them, bow, dance, and you will have true immortals teaching you to pay homage.

This scripture is truly wondrous, so its outline is spoken; the heart should keep it in mind, carefully not err. Constantly reciting the true scripture, you receive heavenly rank.

Also, *Chapter on Shallow Practice and Corpse Liberation* says: Shallow learning of Dao, corpse liberation and ascent. Before death, there must be good affinities. When kalpas end, Eastern Peak loses records, Western Peak loses registers; Du Ling Spirit Lord, with two envoys, pursues and summons souls and spirits. At this time, always remember your causes; when seeing the underworld court, with prisons and punishments, fearful and alarming, be without fear, speak your case; tell your causes, no concealment, true sincerity; evil registers have no name, good registers have names.

Among them is the Eastern Extreme Savior from Suffering Perfected Person, hearing your good words, joyfully welcoming you, ascending the jade carriage, four-wheeled chariot. Gods on left and right, like ascending truth, recognize your surname and name, escort your spirit and soul, refined in the Vermilion Mound, successively ranked, roaming Upper Purity, entering Purple Tenuity court.

Sometimes there are elixirs, sometimes true scriptures, jade boys transmit reports, like ascending. Your bones remain as a cast-off form, like cicada’s shell, foul and not fragrant. Sons and grandsons bury with utmost sincerity; sects receive protection, also ascending the immortal ladder. The immortal ladder is in sight, but people do not know; hence appended here.

---

### I also humbly comment: Master Xu Zhenjun of the capital immortal transmitted this Supreme Wondrous Scripture and expounded the Numinous Treasure Pure Bright Dharma. The words “Pure Bright” are not adequately symbolized by the sun and moon of the Great Void.

*Collected Works of Master Chao Wenyuan* says: Confucian texts say purity and brightness lie in the self; aspiration and spirit are like gods. *Zhuangzi* says: Water is pure and thus bright; how much more so spirit—saints’ hearts are pure. Universal Light Buddha spoke of the Pure Bright Samadhi, free from all vexations, nature like the void, unstained, originally nothing, the body of primordial emptiness, the utmost purity.

Silent illumination contains void; emptiness ultimately reveals function, brightness utmost. Like the Great Void is pure, sun and moon are bright; if pure bright heart is not seen, this principle reaches the utmost, so no single Dharma can be obtained. Illuminating darkness is like lighting a candle; emptying oneself is like a clear palace. These words are all the three teachings’ sages’ revelation of the marvel of these two words, matching the scripture’s “evenly balanced, no high or low, no differing colors” and the “suspended pearl, silent with no lingering sound” chapters, all the same meaning, thus appended here.

---

### The Dao says: On days of practice, one should bathe with fragrant water, fast and abstain, enter a room facing east, knock teeth thirty-two times, hear the thirty-two heavens, and with heart bow thirty-two times. Close eyes and meditate, sitting amid blue, yellow, and white three-colored cloud breath, inside and outside dense and dim, with Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Black Tortoise, Lion, and White Crane arrayed left and right; sun and moon illuminate, the room shines clearly, the neck produces a round image, light reflecting the Ten Directions—thus clearly.

Secret mantra:

Gan Luo Yu Luo, talisman no Sutra.  
Great Surge, Great Ultimate, yin and yang harmonize.  
Out goes in comes, ghosts and spirits unfathomable.  
Out of death into life, transformation natural.  
Primordial mixed breath, profound within profound.  
Above hangs the peak, below penetrates the great abyss.  
Recite once, ailments heal.  
Refine soul and nurture spirit, true yang self-complete.  
Fast, bow, recite, myriad faults fly to immortals.  
Supreme secret mantra, myriad spirits continuous.  
Heart center mantra, repeated and proclaimed.  
Gan Luo clear and bright, united with true Dao.  
Jade Pure Upper Extreme, Brahma breath mingling.  
Distribute spirit and breath, descend and pour into servant body.  
Form and spirit both marvelous, transformation flying ascent.  
One as command and rule, governing myriad spirits.

Urgent urgent one as Primordial Supreme Emperor’s profound edict.

---

### The Most High Profound Supreme Dao Sovereign summons from the body the three-five merit officers, left and right officials, incense attendants, jade boys and girls who transmit words, five emperors direct talismans and incense officials, each thirty-two, to open and close as commanded.

Today is auspicious, long fast and pure hall, cultivating to scripture. I now report a certain vow to be fulfilled, directly ascending to the Most High Supreme Primordial Emperor’s supreme seat.

---

### There are two ways to practice Dao: burning incense and reciting scripture, walking in void and praising—also called practicing Dao; refining body and mind, practicing Dao and virtue—also called practicing Dao.

Bathing means washing hair; bathing means washing body. Also two methods: using five fragrant waters with mantras to wash body, and other bathing; great practice of Brahma breath, circling ten directions, reaching the central principle of five breaths, mixing myriad spirits—this is inner bathing.

Fasting is not only abstaining from meat and fish and impurities, avoiding greed and lust, but also harmonizing the heart to prevent harm, guarding nature to cut off wrong. Entering the room means entering stillness and dustlessness, body and mind focused, able to communicate with spirits. Facing east is the direction of longevity, summoning true breath, life as foundation.

Knocking teeth: left is heavenly bell, right is heavenly chime, summoning immortals. Center is heavenly drum, facing the Most High. Heart bow means body still, focused on reverence. Closing eyes means inward observation, breath condenses and stills.

Blue is profound unity breath, yellow is original unity breath, white is beginning unity breath. The meaning of three colors is taken from the Three Pure Ones. Sitting and preserving these, spirit and light naturally manifest.

Thus inner realm is clear, outer realm is clear, dense and dimly united, hence called azure dim.

Next, preserve Azure Dragon issuing from liver, on left; White Tiger issuing from lungs, on right; Vermilion Bird issuing from heart, in front; Black Tortoise issuing from kidneys, behind. Lion and White Crane each preserved by six numbers, issuing from six bowels, arrayed left, right, front, back.

Left eye transforms into sun wheel, showing ninefold purple-red light; right eye transforms into moon wheel, showing tenfold yellow-white light; nine feet away from body, light brilliant, shining into nose, passing brain back, entering Golden Flower Palace, forming round light as large as a cartwheel.

Previously blue, yellow, white had intervals, called nine-colored round image; by this light pervading Ten Directions worlds, then subtle sounds successively preserve spirit officials emerging from the crown, arrayed before.

Recite vows and blessings, then preserve and swallow breath of thirty-two heavens, each taking breath and swallowing it to finish.

---

### Eulogy:

Close eyes and carefully observe the body,  
In stillness another universe appears.  
Round light emerges, immortals gather,  
Ask you who is the Primordial Venerable.

# Commentary on the Supreme Wondrous Scripture of the Primordial Origin’s Boundless Salvation of Beings, Scroll Two

---

### The Supreme Wondrous Scripture of the Primordial Origin’s Boundless Salvation of Beings

Primordial is the root of all things, standing at the head of the great image, vast and luminous, transforming endlessly. If one can deepen its root, strengthen its base, one will long unite with Heaven.

---

### Eulogy:

To know one’s root and lineage to realize truth,  
Iron shoes worn through, laboring the form in vain.  
Foolish children dwell for a thousand years,  
Today at last can recognize the master.

---

### Beginning is the number of vagueness, at the very start of the tiniest hair, before transformation; all things arise from the beginning, return to the end, then return to the Primordial Origin. The meaning of beginning is clear and supreme, then transformation takes shape and form.

---

### Eulogy:

At that time, foolish and dull, not knowing the wise,  
Drawn by you into worldly entanglements.  
A man of resolve finally sees through,  
Coming and going freely, no clinging.

---

### Non-being is being, being is non-being. Being and non-being are the root of Dao. Welcoming it, one sees no beginning; following it, one sees no end; silently and quietly it exists.

---

### Eulogy:

In vagueness the marvelous function is distinct,  
Within it the origin of form is established.  
No need to seek outside in vain,  
Mixed and misty, who else is it?

---

### Measure is the use of Dao, utmost and inexhaustible. Heaven’s number is one, Earth’s number two, myriad things’ number three. One, two, three, the ultimate categories of myriad things, all return to one; this measure is boundless.

---

### Eulogy:

Looking from high places, how many li?  
Boundless and infinite, deeply obscure.  
Looking up and down, unaware of Heaven and Earth’s vastness,  
One must encompass the true unity.

---

### Salvation means Dao has no form, containing light and establishing beings; rootless, transforming falsehood into truth. Primordial unity transforms into spirit; spirit transforms into truth; truth transforms into Dao. Things take form by things; humans take truth to become Dao. Knowing things and guarding truth, this is salvation.

---

### Eulogy:

Earth and wood form the body, all belong to emptiness,  
Ignorance and shadow wrapped in chaos.  
Must rely on extraordinary methods beyond things,  
Only then can one fly and transcend the worldly cage.

---

### Humans are the profound and subtle question; humans are within it. Vaguely and dimly, fire births spirit; dark and obscure, water births essence. Fire flames rise, seven transformations become spirit; water flows down, six changes become essence. Seven and six transformations, up and down complement; spirit and essence come and go, marvelous body containing truth, each true its truth—this is called perfected person.

---

### Eulogy:

This body is originally precious beyond compare,  
Originally tranquil, connecting Heaven and Earth.  
Creation relies only on yin and yang,  
Earth, water, fire, wind are all impurities.

---

### “Above” is the marvel of Dao. Swallowing red, receiving yellow, absorbing blue, wearing white, gathering origin in the origin palace, giving birth to spirit and image. Then abandoning all things, leaving all transformations, solely obtaining the profound—this is called supreme above all.

---

### Eulogy:

Three hundred achievements and myriad wondrous deeds,  
In dust snatch the embroidered banner home.  
The jade platform already inscribed with titles,  
Shows the man’s ambition is not humble.

---

### Grade means to recognize the many and unify the one, guard the one and embrace the one, return to my utmost one—this is called grade. Dao originally has no form; how can there be grades? For expedient teaching, there are grades.

---

### Eulogy:

Three thousand six hundred Dharma gates abound,  
Only need to clearly recognize the right one.  
The Great Dao does not expect a thousand days’ completion,  
Do not let years slip by in vain.

---

### Marvelous means root of myriad dharmas; thus Heaven and Earth are void and wondrous and clear; yin and yang are wondrous and pure; sun and moon combine wondrously and bright; Five Phases contain marvel and essence; myriad things all marvel and true.

Marvelous vision sees the image without form; marvelous hearing hears the sound without voice. Cannot be seen, cannot be heard, cannot be or not be—this is true marvel.

---

### Eulogy:

Neither non-being nor being, fundamentally pure and true,  
Neither color nor sound, beyond comparison.  
To copy form and shape is hard everywhere,  
Profound within position and image very clear.

---

### Scripture means the weaving and pattern of Heaven and Earth; sun and moon run, day and night without rest, ending and beginning, transforming without end. Ancient people looked up and down, must rely on Dao, not transgressing rules, not losing constancy, not losing essence due to external things—this is the scripture’s foundation.

---

### Eulogy:

Counting teachers and masters, wishing and compassion,  
Not wasting precious pearls and jade.  
Clearly pointing to the path of flying immortals,  
Mountain and river’s profound grace repay without loss.

---

### Collation Commentary:

Praise of the words “Primordial Origin”: “Before the great image, forcibly named origin, ancestor of Heaven and Earth, source of myriad things. After the Three Talents separate, there is a beginning, people know to return, finally returning to root. True emptiness and silent illumination before the Great Kalpa. Boundless” means when form did not yet exist, Dao truly was here, unknown by name, called “boundless”; cannot be questioned, who can measure or glimpse? This is measure, measure cannot be pushed. Profound beyond profound, the enlightened all return.

Praise of “Salvation of Beings”: When form exists, transformation arises; what else but Dao transforms? False salvation is true; decay salvation is wondrous. Among all people, why alone different? Shedding the mundane to enter the sacred, equal and rarefied.

Praise of “Supreme Grade”: Unknown how high, hence called supreme grade; there is a thing mixed and formed, before Heaven and Earth. From below looking up, who is before it? This is grade, words cannot be proclaimed! Among equals, transcending and surpassing.

Praise of “Wondrous Scripture”: The morning sun rises in the east, the night moon hangs in the sky; jade emerges from stone, pearls appear from shells. The most precious is Dao; marvel cannot be exhausted. Spread as scripture, truth and permanence the same; Heaven and Earth have kalpas, wondrous scripture has no end.

---

### Chapter on the Primordial Origin’s Expounding of Dao, Opening and Universal Salvation

Expounding Dao and virtue, enlightening humans and heavens, governing the Three Realms, this is called universal.

---

### Collation Commentary:

The scripture says “Dao speaks,” these two chapters’ titles; Qingyuan Zhenren’s commentary uses this to mark the first of the two chapters.

---

### Establishing images and beginning cultivation, four hundred and fifty-seven words.

Ordinary people’s nature is dim, turning away from root and losing truth; thus first establishing image and method, opening the path, the root of Dao.

---

### Collation Commentary:

The Elder of Qinghe’s preface to Qingyuan’s commentary says: dividing into eight matters, this is one of the eight.

---

### Primordial Origin Cavern Profound, Numinous Treasure Root Chapter, Supreme Grade Marvelous Head, tenfold salvation of beings, hundred demons’ hidden names, separation and union natural.

This is the celestial true sovereign’s confused scripture’s original intent, saying the Celestial Venerable contains and expands the marvelous Dao, embracing nature, covering myriad grades, most honored and precious, penetrating the profound unity, transforming and saving humans and heavens, hence called Primordial Origin Cavern Profound. Able to illuminate the Ten Directions worlds with great wisdom and light. Called Numinous in Heaven, Treasure in the world, hence Numinous Treasure. All spoken by golden mouth, hence called root chapter, fully containing cultivation of truth and union with Dao, its grade supreme, the head of myriad marvels, secretly hiding demon truths. Condensed with Brahma breath, dispersed as breath, united as text, the Dao of transformation and message, incomparable to ink marks, the ancestor of myriad dharmas, the honored of the Three Caverns. The wise recognize it, cultivate and become treasure.

*Huangting Jing* says: “The path of governing life is not complicated; ancestor cultivation is Cavern Profound and Jade chapters.” This is it.

If you desire to know the Primordial Origin’s method of salvation,  
Numinous Treasure originally named root chapter.  
Hidden are the hundred demons, who can understand?  
If one can separate and unite with natural light.

### Mixed cavern red text, unsurpassed truth, Primordial Origin ancestral kalpa, transforming and generating heavens. Illuminating the three lights, this is Heaven’s root; above no ancestor, only Dao as body, five texts open and expand, universally planting spirits.

“Mixed cavern” means the image before Heaven and Earth separated. Before Primordial Origin, its breath was pure and red, wind and moisture mixed, called great cavern. First forming text, only the Celestial Venerable condensed and stood alone, in the utmost of non-being, obtaining the utmost truth within truth, hence called unsurpassed truth.

Primordial Origin ancestral kalpa is the Dragon Han minor kalpa called Yan Kang. Initially from one breath arose three breaths, forming the Three Pure Ones’ upper realm; three breaths gave birth to nine breaths, completing the Nine Heavens; beyond the Nine Heavens, thirty-two heavens were arranged, transforming and generating the heavens.

Then the sun, moon, stars were set, governing all things, opening the three lights’ illumination, the image of Heaven and Earth, yet not escaping the operation of transformation. The Celestial Venerable thus contains the mixed cavern beginning, producing the Five Phases’ true breath, condensed into talismans and scripts to stabilize Heaven and Earth, generate and transform spirits, govern the Three Realms, presiding over myriad dharmas, thus suspended without falling, lasting without decay.

By these five texts, five thousand characters are formed, fully containing the marvelous original spirit true Dao root, corresponding to the Five Phases, the head of transformation.

Like a person not yet formed, where is spirit and consciousness? In the chaotic and turbid, dense and dim, no division or distinction, no being or non-being, non-being called Dao. Dao is the root of humans. This scattered Dao becomes its raw form; raw form scatters into breath; breath condenses to produce spirit; spirit complete then has form. This is the human’s original root, originally so.

Then distributing three fields, opening nine orifices, five viscera and six entrails, the image of transforming and generating heavens. Three fields are the gathering of essence and blood, the root of myriad breaths. Opening the three lights, forming one body’s yin and yang, the root of guarding and protecting.

Moreover, though humans are born from the womb, their origin arises from the Primordial Origin’s beginning; who is ancestor and root, receiving Dao breath as substance, essence and blood as form, and transformations therein.

The five spirits arrayed; then thirty-six thousand joints, original root born spirit at once—are they not the universal planting of spirits?

Thus knowing Dao is not far from humans; humans awaken and cultivate, can ascend immortality. Foolish people cling and cannot honor their breath, value their root, protect their life, strengthen their form, bringing death and decay, departing from their original truth, thus far from Dao.
