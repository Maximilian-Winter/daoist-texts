## Preface to the Profound Inner Meaning of the Supreme Grade Sublime Scripture of the Primordial Infinite Salvation of Beings

Your servant Yingsou says: With careful reference to the *Lingbao Salvation of Beings Sublime Scripture*, I have composed this exposition of its inner meaning, carved in woodblocks and passed down. The Primordial Ancestral Kalpa is called the Pre-Heaven; the Lingbao original chapter, hence it is called the Supreme Grade. The creation and transformation of the solitary returning elixir—who but the Great Brahma can encompass such a realm? Having thus published it, I dare not forget to proclaim it clearly. Your servant is truly reverent and fearful, kowtowing with deep bows.

I privately reflect that the pure and vast One Truth embraces Heaven and Earth as one body; the myriad transformations arise from the same root of birth and death. Though said to contain spirits and consciousness differing in kind, all are fundamentally harmonized in the wondrous unity of emptiness and non-being. What then are fame and profit, ambition and temper, but delusions? From one source they flow in divisions; nature is near, habits are far. All arise from grasping illusions—how can there be knowledge of constancy? The five colors confuse the eyes—who will turn back the light? The myriad changes scatter like flowers—who can reverse the transformations? It is said the boat is safely hidden in the valley, yet the sun’s chariot does not linger. Rather than mourn an untimely death while craving life, better to cultivate truth and cherish life.

Thus, our Void Sovereign Holy Lord unfolded the wondrous Dao before the kalpa of emptiness; the Jade Morning Supreme received the true explanation within the millet pearl. Saving beings without measure, bestowing blessings without end. Yet the Great Dao is nothing but the perfect center; later generations, however, twist and dispute, viewing the wondrous as a golden lock, confused at the source as fish in a basin. They talk of emptiness and purity, yet drown in bitter void; they discuss mercury, lead, and silver, yet cling to fixed existence. Without the bright ancestral qi of creation, how could one verify the subtlety of the Great Brahma?

According to the true scripture as the root, the profound mystery is freely revealed without hiding its purpose. In old times, a crow became a horse—inevitably there was dispute; today, one cannot see the whole ox, yet touches and knows to restrain. Pull back the cart of confusion and return to the homeland of the south-pointing needle; block the wild waves and follow the downward current. Universally command the common folk to ascend to benevolence and longevity.

Respectfully considering the Most High Vast Heaven Supreme Jade Emperor, Great August Sovereign of the Jade Throne, majestic and immeasurable, vast and ineffable, impartial and selfless, subtle and inscrutable, always benefiting and saving all beings without abandonment. Thus, even the smallest talents dare to offer these humble writings. If they help even a fraction, I pray they will be kindly received; if not, I beg forgiveness for my arrogance.

All the inner meanings are divided into two scrolls, carved and printed, submitted to the capital’s bureau, humbly requesting imperial favor to distribute and report. Offending Heaven’s majesty, your servant is truly reverent and fearful, kowtowing with deep bows. Humbly spoken.

On the seventh day of the first month, seventh year of the Bingxu cycle, second year of the Baoqing era, presented by the Great Dongxuan Master of the Three Sceneries of the Supreme Clarity, servant Xiao Yingsou.

## Scripture’s Purpose

The Most High is the Supreme Limitless One, the Beginning of the Primordial. Before father and mother were born, a single point of true yang essence stirred; the two qi mutually influenced and gave birth to the two kidneys. Once the kidneys are born, the two eyes arise. Then the five viscera cluster, their forms complete, and only then does the body exist. This is called the cavity. The cavity is the body with all limbs complete; upon descending into human birth, one sees the body itself.

The mysterious is the essence of the mysterious One. Once the body exists, the essence guards the gate of origin; once essence guards the gate, qi circulates; once qi circulates, the spirit is whole. When the spirit is whole, the hundred orifices open and close, and all things respond. The eyes receive light and can see all things; the nose opens and can smell fragrances; the ears open and can hear sounds; the mouth connects to the heart and can taste all flavors. When these four are complete, the being is numinous. Among all things, only humans are most numinous—this is what is meant.

Yet human numinosity is not awakened. The reason humans live long and do not age is that one can keep the single spirit from leaking outward. Let the eyes not see colors, so the soul guards the liver, solidifying wood qi without leakage; let the nose not smell fragrance, so the corporeal soul guards the lungs, solidifying metal qi without leakage; let the ears not hear sounds, so the essence guards the kidneys, solidifying water qi without leakage; let the mouth not speak, so the spirit guards the heart, solidifying fire qi without leakage; let the whole body sit upright, the five elements unmoving, so the intention guards the spleen, solidifying earth qi without leakage. When the five directions are firmly established, spirit, qi, and essence blend as one, returning to the root and restoring life. Then all spirits gather and transform into an infant, discarding the illusory shell, entering and exiting without connection to creation, harmonizing with the Dao—this is the treasure.

When a person obtains this treasure in the body, they move freely, soaring at will, eternally youthful and unaging, resting in harmony with Heaven. By spreading true qi, one can transform earth and stone into treasure; by spreading true qi, one can raise withered bones to life; by spreading true qi, one can cure all diseases, which then heal themselves; by spreading true qi, one can repel demons and evil, which then vanish; by spreading true qi, one can stir wind and thunder, which then tremble on their own; by spreading true qi, one can support all things, which then flourish; by spreading true qi, one can lift the hidden souls, which then liberate themselves—this is the infinite salvation of beings.

The supreme grade is the great vehicle’s method; the wondrous is the profound shortcut; the scripture is the path of cultivating truth. If one can recite its text and realize its depths in the heart, then at every thought there is mysterious response. As for cultivating truth, learning the Dao, saving lives, and delivering the dead, all are contained herein. Practice it secretly, and only then can one attain the Dao.

The *Lingbao Sublime Scripture* is vast in meaning and profound in principle; it is not obscure or hidden but penetrates the mystery and exhausts the subtlety. Foolish ones say otherwise. Hence the scripture says: If you grasp but one point, all matters are complete. Would the Heavenly Venerable make things difficult to confuse people? The daily conduct of ordinary people is all this scripture. The wise, like the wealthy who discern precious vessels among goblets and cups, know the gold within. Why is it difficult? Those who cannot discern follow the vessel’s turning and are not confused. This scripture is the Dao itself; its wondrous talk of profound principle, its subtle unfolding of great names, is nothing but the division of Brahma qi, the exposition of true emptiness and transformation. People create scenes and gatherings, scattered and hard to enter. To understand this scripture, none is better than to measure oneself with creation—others are so, I am so—carefully observing and pondering, surely there will be accord. Not only this scripture but the entire great Buddhist canon is likewise.

Laoquan and Master Su said: Why would Heaven associate with me by chance? The reason Heaven associates with me must be to use me. If I know but do not act, and do not tell others, Heaven surely uses me while I set it aside—this is called abandoning Heaven. To humble oneself and seek favor is to speak thus; to belittle Heaven is also my fault. I always take this as a warning, trusting Heaven’s favor, friends’ polishing, and secretly seeing the root of Lingbao. This too is Heaven’s association with me. Having obtained it, I strive to act and dare not abandon Heaven. I speak in detail and keep it secret, daring not to blaspheme Heaven. Neither abandoning nor blaspheming, I wander here, rest here, cultivate here, and keep here—this is my wish.

If comrades know it, let them share with the crowd; I fear blaspheming Heaven and thus decline. They say: Have you not heard the story of Li Guangxuan? Once Guangxuan diligently sought the Dao for many years. One day on Mount Shaoshi he met a strange man who said: You now seek the Dao—should you only uplift the world? Or only realize yourself? If only for oneself, even the immortals will not accept you. Have you not heard of the fool Song? Once Song obtained a swallow stone and treasured it. A visitor from Zhou came to see it and laughed, saying: This is only a swallow stone, no different from tiles and bricks. The fool Song was angered and guarded it more firmly. If your words are true, then you are of the same kind as Li Guangxuan; if not, you tread the path of the fool Song. If shared with the crowd, great masters might correct your errors, open your mind, and not only benefit people but Heaven might truly gain from you—how shallow that would be!

Though I am not clever, I respectfully accept these words, and also take the annotations of the four schools of Yan, Xue, Cheng, and Li, selecting the clear parts, along with friends’ sayings, appended below the text in small characters to clarify the scripture’s purpose. As for meanings explained by images and images clarified by meaning, the scripture and alchemical Dao are consistent without difference, and their image explanations are appended at the end. Though my view is but a glimpse and my measure but a ladle, though I cannot exhaust even a drop, this is my extent. Alas! Confucius said: Those who know me, is it not only the *Spring and Autumn Annals*? Those who blame me, is it not only the *Spring and Autumn Annals*?

In the second year of Baoqing, in the year of Bingxu, on the seventh day of the first month, recorded by the Daoist Guanfuzi Xiao Yingsou.

## Diagram of the Mysterious Transformation of the Supreme Ultimate Spiritual Essence in the Mixed Cavity Red Script

The Mixed Cavity Red Script is the unsurpassed truth of non-being; this is what is called the Limitless and the Supreme Ultimate. The Primordial Ancestral Kalpa transformed and gave birth to the myriad heavens, opening and illuminating the Three Sceneries—this is the root of Heaven. Above there is no further ancestor; only the Dao is the body—this is called the Supreme Ultimate moving and giving birth to yang. When movement reaches its extreme, it becomes still; when still, it gives birth to yin; when stillness reaches its extreme, it returns to movement. One movement and one stillness mutually root each other, dividing yin and yang, and thus the two agents stand.

The five characters expand and open; this is called yang transforming and yin combining to give birth to water, fire, wood, metal, and earth. The five qi spread in order, the four seasons proceed. The Five Phases are one yin and yang; yin and yang are one Supreme Ultimate. The Supreme Ultimate is originally limitless; each of the Five Phases has its own nature. They universally plant spiritual beings; no character lacks light, clarity, establishment, completion, measure, or life. This is called the true of the limitless, the essence of two and five, wondrously combined and condensed. The Qian Dao forms the male, the Kun Dao forms the female; the two qi mutually influence and transform to give birth to myriad things. The myriad things endlessly generate and transform. Students should investigate the words and seek the meaning, then the Pre-Heaven Dao will be grasped without effort, and the mystery of creation can be glimpsed.

Therefore, the Confucians understand the cause of light and darkness, pervading all things, tracing origins and returning to ends, exhausting principle and reaching nature, and thereby mastering the mystery of life and death without fear. Laozi says: Deep roots and firm foundation, long life and broad vision. Each has its own root and source. How to achieve this? The scripture says: Know the masculine, keep the feminine, return to the infant. Know the white, keep the black, return to the limitless. This is the way of the golden liquid returning to the elixir, thus able to deeply root and firmly establish, living long and seeing far.

## Diagram of the Body’s Image of Yin and Yang Rising and Falling

**Parable**

This body is the furnace of Heaven and Earth; the central palace is the cauldron; outside the body is the great void. The Qian official is the marrow sea; the Kun palace is the essence chamber; the spirit chamber is the cinnabar cauldron, called the Three Palaces. Qian and Kun are the framework of Heaven and Earth. Yin and yang operate within. Heaven and Earth are the great smelting furnace; yin and yang are the transformative mechanism; one qi is the medicine. All alchemy relies on the qi of Qian and Kun, female and male, circulating and nurturing the stars to form the cauldron vessel; the Golden Mother dwells in the center, with the wondrous transforming qi of generation, reciprocally influencing and stimulating—this is called cultivation and refinement. Yang essence burns daily; true spirits transform and give birth, called the sacred embryo. Yin strips away yang purity, called the infant. This is the Great One containing truth, harmonizing with emptiness and non-being, returning to the limitless.

The spirit chamber is the place and mechanism of nurturing and operation; if there is leakage or fault, oaths and transmissions are given. For the teacher, clearly instruct to avoid misleading the aspirants and causing them to fall into confusion.

### The Eight Rings

1. The first ring is the Eight Trigrams, representing Earth. The trigrams form images and are used reciprocally.

2. The second ring is the Twenty-Eight Mansions, representing Heaven. They clearly use the circumpolar rotation to measure great numbers and begin the heavenly origin.

3. The third ring is the thirty lunar phases, the fire numbers of the month, corresponding to the sixty hexagrams, used reciprocally.

4. The fourth ring is one hundred white and black dots, the yin talisman and yang fire marking the water clock, corresponding to the heavenly talisman’s movement and stillness.

5. The fifth ring is the twelve trigrams, the advancing and retreating images of lines, the rising and falling of dragons and tigers.

6. The sixth ring is the twelve earthly branches, the fire seasons rising and falling, clustering the heavenly talisman.

7. The seventh ring displays the great number of the circumpolar rotation, responding to the four seasons and Five Phases, corresponding to the inner image.

8. The eighth ring arrays yin and yang, Five Phases, myriad images into the cauldron, assisting the golden fire dragons and tigers, Li female and Kan male, yin-yang spouses, mating to generate true sand and true mercury, forming the divine elixir.

This diagram of the Great Returning Heart Mirror’s fire seasons was composed by the True One disciple Peng Xiao to clarify the hidden language of the Great Brahma.

## Recitation Instructions

There are five prohibitions and ten fruitless words.

The secret to reciting the scripture must be known: purification, bathing, casting away worldly thoughts, desiring inner and outer reflection—this is good. I once saw the method of the Supreme Ultimate Master Ge reciting scripture, with five prohibitions and ten fruitless words. The noble ones who seek goodness and can follow these words will gain boundless benefit. Not only will their own bodies ascend and be saved, but blessings will flow to descendants.

The five prohibitions are:

1. Do not recite with the mouth while the heart is contrary.

2. Do not lightly disdain the words and principles.

3. Do not create thoughts of self and others.

4. Must be humble and ask the teacher.

5. Be kind and welcoming, mutually enlightening.

The ten fruitless words are:

Not loyal to ruler, not filial to parents, not compassionate to things; clinging to ignorance, comparing self and others; jealousy of the virtuous, envy of those superior; slandering the good, insulting the poor and solitary; evil speech and double tongues; deceiving heart and harming things; craving wine and meat, loving illicit sex; giving rise to greed, anger, hatred, and love.

If one can observe these, what disaster will not be extinguished, what sin will not be erased? The heavens record names, the demon kings endorse. Otherwise, even if recited all life, seeking blessing and wisdom is impossible. The noble and accomplished should carefully heed this.

All who recite the scripture, regardless of Daoist or lay, male or female, must keep a pure fast without distracting thoughts inside, and abstain from rich and fatty foods outside. Enter the quiet chamber—meaning a pure and clean room. Arrange ritual garments; robes and jackets are acceptable but must be clean. Tap the teeth, align the teeth, sound the ritual drum daily, gathering body and spirit. Burn incense, rich and fiery fragrance, to reach sincere heart. Bow the heart to the four directions east, south, west, north; then bow to the northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest, above, and below—each one bow. Bowing the body is less than bowing the heart. Facing east is the order of ascending to Heaven, from east, west, and above. The flat seat is the proper seat. One may sit cross-legged or with feet down, initially without restriction. Then tap the teeth, recite the purification heart-mouth spell and purification body spell, guarding adornments of body and spirit. Then tap the teeth and recite the purification heaven-earth spell, opening the scripture’s profound mysteries.

After reciting these spells, then open the scroll and recite the scripture. The other instructions are detailed later.

## Scroll One of the Profound Inner Meaning of the Supreme Grade Sublime Scripture of the Primordial Infinite Salvation of Beings

Guanfuzi Xiao Yingsou’s Study

Carefully referencing the *Lingbao Great Dharma*, clarifying the seven matters in the *Salvation Scripture*, roughly outlined: The primordial ancestral qi of the Primordial is formless and prior; what can it be compared to? Descending to substance and forming qi, transforming and giving birth to myriad treasures—what form is it in this world? Then refining this qi into treasure, nourishing it to ascend to truth. I secretly observe the ancient True Supreme Saints revealing this one path, truly the supreme opportunity over birth and death, the great essence of nature and life. If not the way of the golden liquid returning to the elixir, how could one understand the mystery of the primordial ancestral qi? Exhausting the subtlety, seeking the profound, dredging the divine grace, irrigating the field of immortality.

### The Supreme Clarity Mysterious Treasure Infinite Salvation Supreme Grade Sublime Scripture

This scripture is revered by myriad saints, admired by all true beings, unsurpassed above all, profound beyond profound. The term Dongxuan Lingbao is the general title of this grade; Infinite Salvation of Beings is the chapter title. It is the root of all scriptures, hence called Supreme Grade; by this the Dao is clarified, hence called the Sublime Scripture.

Our dynasty’s True Sect imperial preface says: The Great Yi (Change) bestowed teachings before the Supreme Spirit; the Mixed Origin wrote the book based on the wondrous Dao. It accords with the unfathomable yin and yang, marks the silent and nameless void. It expounds the non-action of non-being, depicts the formless image, encompassing the hidden and praising the manifest, nurturing people and things. Though ancient and modern differ in method, the true instruction leads all to the same return. As for the secret texts in the treasury, the bright platform’s secret writings, the intricate jade collections, overflowing alchemical boxes—turtles’ gates and ramparts, from the highest truth descending and transmitting; the red bright dragon river, flowing with the kalpa’s fate—these transcend hearing and seeing, precede spoken words, assist in perfect governance, gradually irrigate all beings. First arising among the nine streams, enduring through a hundred generations, amid war and chaos, how could one neglect their use? Like fish and insects at the appointed time, who can pick them up? The *Salvation Scripture* is the wondrous word of the Primordial, the precious edict of the Jade Morning. The floating realm of true reality records its initial reception; the Purple Tenuity Upper Palace reveals its concealed traces. Truly the hidden rhyme of the heavens, the immortal chapter of the Great Brahma. The eight corners hang their rays, originally from the divine brush; the myriad deities arrayed guard and universally save human spirits. Those who cultivate the essence and round square, receive harmony of Heaven and Earth, reduce selfishness and desires, abandon falsehood and return to truth, purify thought and fast, wash the heart and complete recitation, concentrate externally and accumulate purely internally, can hide themselves to shine, illuminate all darkness. Like the birth of white in the empty chamber, like the warm spring washing away evil, ascending the spring terrace, climbing the domain of longevity. When utmost sincerity is reached, how boundless is the blessing!

Ah, how magnificent! The Lingbao is said: Ling means sacred transformation; Bao means precious and esteemed. Some say Ling is the common name for myriad saints; Bao is what the saints treasure. Others say transformation is boundless and called Ling; reverence and preciousness are Bao. Some say Ling is in Heaven, Bao on Earth. Some say spirits descend as Ling, qi gathers as Bao. The benevolent see it as spirit; the wise see it as knowledge; common people use it daily without knowing, so forcibly give it form to respond, transform, teach, govern, and benefit life. Qi refined to essence reaches formlessness, vast beyond measure. If taken far from things or near to the body, then great as Heaven and Earth, subtle never departing the tiny. Brightly it is sun and moon; hidden it is yin and yang; in Confucianism it is benevolence and righteousness; in Buddhism, knowledge and wisdom; in humans, spirit qi; in alchemy, mercury and lead. All things are embodied as nature and feeling; all primordial qi is creation. In truth, all is Dao. Only the enlightened can unify it. Yet grasping illusions and confusing truth, following emotions and chasing things, causes the spiritual source to scatter, the wondrous root to split, unable to return to youth and child, leading to decay.

Hence the *Chapter on Generating Spirit* says: When a person returns to life in the human path, washing the form with the sun, startling Heaven and Earth, even the precious are hard to bear. Heaven’s truth, Earth’s spirit, the Three Realms all come; they do not lightly treat it; when time to be born, they do not make it lowly. But people get life and cannot honor their qi, value their form, treasure their fate, or love their spirit, thus bringing death and decay, departing from their original truth.

The *Western Ascension Scripture* says: Born of emptiness, placed in non-being; born by spirit, killed by heart; accumulating qi and gathering blood, forming my body. The body is the vehicle of spirit, the dwelling of spirit, the master of spirit. When calm, the spirit dwells therein; when restless, the spirit departs.

The *Yellow Court Scripture* says: Long life requires utmost caution in the chamber; why die to make the spirit weep? An inch of field, a foot of house can govern life; if the sea is cut off, a hundred rivers collapse. Leaves fall, trees wither losing green; qi gone, fluids leaked, not yet form.

Zhuangzi says: My life has limits, but knowledge is limitless; to follow the limited with the limitless is perilous. Also: Life is the gathering of qi; gathering is life, dispersing is death. The form labors without rest and is worn out; essence used without ceasing is exhausted.

The Grand Historian said: People are born with spirit; their form is the vessel. If spirit is overused, it is exhausted; if form is overworked, it is worn. When form and spirit separate, death occurs; death is irreversible; separation is irreversible; hence sages cherish them.

Carefully observing these words, all know to return to root and source. Therefore, the natural Lingbao Dao, the great return of the golden liquid, has always been sought by the enlightened, never lacking people. The Most High opened the method of guiding and called upon people: Always observe the wondrous with desirelessness, always observe the subtle with desire. Buddhism also says: People are turned by things; if one can turn things, one is like the Tathāgata. Thus Daoism and Buddhism each have their transcendence over life and death. Buddhism takes nature as the root and cultivates meditation; Daoism takes spirit as the master and refines the golden elixir. The extreme of meditation is stillness in yin; the extreme of the golden elixir returns to yang. These two arise together but differ in use, both from the root of birth to achieve true reality, not relying on external things to create.

Spirit and nature can be grasped by intuition but not by reason. Reason divides into confusion, right and wrong, self and other; intuition harmonizes differences and similarities, no distinction of this or that. This is the unsurpassed true wondrous Dao; hence all dharmas and myriad gates are nothing but Lingbao.

The *Record of the Mixed Origin* says: Since Laozi’s Dragon River, the incarnations teach and transform, issuing true texts in the Great Fortune Hall of the Central Heaven, the Red Bright Country of the Southern Pole, the Floating Realm of the Eastern Pole, the Sina Country of the Western Pole, and the Yudan Country of the Northern Pole. All these receive the Lingbao teaching. In the Xia era, Lingbao Five Talismans and True Texts were given to Yu. Also transformed the barbarian king, saying: I am always in China, using Dao methods to enlighten people. The king asked: What is Dao method? Laozi said: Dao method is the Supreme Lingbao, born before Heaven and Earth, encompassing the great and including the subtle. Heaven without this cannot shine; Earth without this cannot show form; spirit without this cannot enter the dark; people without this cannot be born. Therefore, myriad things arise and flourish rooted in Dao. The snake becomes dragon, birds become phoenix, beasts become qilin; all who obtain it become immortals. Those who can cultivate it roam freely in the great void, transform the five viscera, change appearance, command ghosts and spirits, hide and reveal at will—this is the way of the upper immortals.

The king said: The Lingbao you speak of is indeed rare. From this we see what it means to obtain and cultivate it. Thus we know Lingbao and the golden elixir arise together but have different names. The *Lingbao Scripture* was given by the Heavenly True Man on Mount Emei to the Yellow Emperor Xuanyuan. The Heavenly True Man gave it to Emperor Ku at the Mu De Terrace; Xia Yu descended at Zhong Mountain; Helü secretly glimpsed at Gouqu. Afterwards, there were people like Ge Xiaoxian and disciples of Zheng Siyuan, masters and students in succession without end—thus the scripture’s purpose was revealed.

## The Dao Says:

The Most High Jade Morning Dao Lord, the Lingbao Heavenly Venerable speaks. Long ago, receiving the scripture from the Void Sovereign Primordial Heavenly Venerable, recording and compiling it, storing it in the Purple Tenuity Upper Palace of the Mysterious Capital, the Dao Lord transmitted it to the True One Immortal and it spread.

Long ago, in the Beginning Azure Heaven,

The nine qi of the east, the Azure Heaven. Beginning is the name of the five directions’ origin; azure is the color of the east.

The Blue Vault’s empty song and the great Floating Realm land,

This heavenly qi is azure blue, with rosy clouds falling, hence called Blue Vault. The spiritual wind and jade trees, drums and songs in the void, hence called Empty Song. The great Floating Realm land is the Eastern Extreme’s great Floating Realm country.

Receiving the Primordial Infinite Salvation Supreme Grade.

The Dao Lord said: In former times, I was in this heaven, this country, receiving the wondrous scripture of the Void Sovereign Heavenly Venerable, widely saving beings in Heaven and Earth, merits beyond measure—this is the supreme true explanation.

The *Inner Meaning* says: Heaven and Earth’s vastness and the tiny subtlety, all forms and numbers are nothing but the body of creation and transformation. The Lingbao Heavenly Venerable begins the scripture saying: In the Beginning Azure Heaven, Blue Vault Empty Song Great Floating Realm land, shows the origin of creation. Things are born from earth and return to earth; hence the *Yinfu Scripture* says: Fire is born from wood; calamity arises and must be overcome. Knowing this in cultivation is called the sage. Within wood is fire; if fire is unleashed without control, it turns to ash and smoke, losing its nature. Those who can control it, though fire burns wood to ashes, gather it to form earth; once earth, the nature remains.

The Beginning Azure Heaven is the direction of grain; Blue Vault Empty Song is the image of fire. The Eastern Extreme Great Floating Realm land is all jade, always producing blue mist. There are also green forest trees; the wind blowing through the trees sounds like hollow chants, brilliant and clear through the void. The Floating Realm country belongs to the northeastern Yulong heaven. Northeast at the Yin position is the place of fire birth. The green forest trees blown by the wind—green is the color of wood, the character for forest has two woods. Guan Yin said: Two woods rubbing produce fire; the tree is also wood. Wood wind is Xun. The hemp-clad Daoist says: The earth produces fire, the qi of Li is nurtured in Xun wood. Brilliant and clear through the void is the image of fire’s brightness. Blue mist spreading is the fire’s nature of emptiness and clarity, like sound in the air. Hence called Blue Vault Empty Song. The Great Floating Realm land is the root of earth. Earth is the base of the returning elixir. The returning elixir is the way of returning to root and source.

The scripture says: Reach the utmost emptiness, keep firm stillness; myriad things arise together, I observe their return. All things flourish and return to root. Returning to root is stillness; stillness is returning life—this is the principle of return. The *Book of Changes*’ hexagram of Return is this. Return is the way of yin and yang returning. Hence it says: Return to see the heart of Heaven and Earth. Heaven and Earth are the body of yin and yang; the heart is the clarity of its use. Heaven moves, Earth is still; yang moves, yin is still; when Heaven moves to the extreme, yin is born; when Earth is still to the extreme, yang is born. It peels above and returns below; movement and stillness rise and fall—this is how we see its heart. Humans are the same.

The hexagram of Return has one yang under the king yin; its body is Zhen below and Kun above. Zhen wood is the Beginning Azure Heaven. Wood gives birth to fire, Blue Vault Empty Song. Fire gives birth to earth; hence Kun earth is the Great Floating Realm earth. Blue Vault Empty Song, in scripture terms, is qi and sound, from non-being into being. In alchemy terms, Zhen wood and Kun earth each have substance, within which the image of fire appears. From this we see the scripture’s purpose, the alchemical Dao is natural, creation and transformation harmonize.

Earth is the basis of creation; hence earth gives birth to metal, called empty qi. The metal embryo is the primordial ancestral qi; hence it says receiving the Primordial Infinite Salvation Supreme Grade. Primordial is the ancestral qi. It is the indestructible primordial spirit from former kalpas, called true lead, the mother of the elixir. The *Dragon Tiger Scripture* says: Metal and fire are true lead. Alchemical texts clarify that nothing is greater than metal and fire. Zhang Ziyang’s *Awakening to Truth* says: Fire born in wood, wood contains the blade; without understanding and research, do not attack recklessly. Calamity arises from this harm; one must subdue and seek the Metal Lord.

It also says: If Li and Kan lack Wu and Ji, though containing the four images, the elixir cannot form; all because each embraces true earth, so the golden elixir can return. From this we see the alchemical Dao, which can indeed be realized. Master Zhaozhou said: The golden Buddha does not pass through the furnace, the wooden Buddha does not pass through fire, the clay Buddha does not pass through water—how then to save me? Unless I save myself. Thus this Dao is to return my spirit, restore my nature, and save my body. One saves oneself; none is unsaved. The beginning is infinite; this is the supreme vehicle. Hence it is called Infinite Salvation Supreme Grade.

## The Primordial Heavenly Venerable

This is the title of the Void Sovereign; from true arising response, it is called realization and cultivation. Wondrous thought from the mysterious source is uniquely inherent in nature. The *Scripture of the Mysterious Spirit* says: The wondrous image is formless, the response and sensation have form.

Now to speak of this scripture:

Scripture means path; it is the path by which one can make the Dao. The *Inner Meaning* says: The Primordial Heavenly Venerable is the ancestral qi of the Dharma body, the so-called original face, the indestructible primordial spirit named true lead. Speaking of this scripture clarifies the ancestral qi as the elixir’s body. Laozi said to Master Yin: If you can know one, all things are complete; close off desires and enter the inner chamber; refining gold and eating qi is foremost; if you can know and guard it, do not lose it. Also said: Red lead and black tin are the great elixir head; from red into black is true cultivation; from black extract essence, from red extract marrow; the medicine of red and black is incomparable. Use red into black to preserve longevity; use black into red for heavenly immortality. Also said: One is lead as ruler; two is mercury as minister. If lead is not true, mercury is hard to approach; if lead is true, it does not lose its minister. The green-waist messenger, the red-blood general; harmonizing two surnames, differing yet same clan. White mercury forms the brain, yellow bud the root. Transform lead into powder, refine mercury into dust. Yin dwells in yang’s position; yang numbers yin’s balance. The moon waxes and the sun wanes; cold and heat are distinguished. Opening and establishing the law’s image, bright and patterned. Only our Dao, Heaven and Earth long endure.

If asked why the scripture only speaks of cultivation, recitation, saving lives, and delivering the dead, never mentioning dragon, tiger, kan, li, mercury, lead, silver—answer: The Great Dao has no fixed form, embodying things to reveal principle. Like the *Book of Changes* as a book, beginning with one qi, dividing yin and yang, intertwining hardness and softness, endlessly transforming. Fuxi drew it to clarify the Dao; Shennong modeled it to make tools. Yao used it southward as ruler; Shun faced north as minister. King Wen expounded it, exhausting creation’s wonder; Confucius clarified it, exploring Heaven and Earth’s essence. Boyang narrated alchemical principles; Ma Yi entrusted the words of transformation. Tu Nan divided images and numbers; Ting explained nature and life; Kang Jie studied Pre-Heaven; Lian Han created the Supreme Ultimate. Some exhaust physical principle; some pursue divination. The universal mechanism of myriad transformations is not limited to one end. Is this scripture’s Dao different? The transmission says: Knowing ritual but not spirit is not the person of long life. Transcending principle into spirit, blending into qi, non-action yet nothing is not done—this is our true sect’s Dao. Hence Master Yin said: Those who are good in our Dao know all spirits in one thing, create profound destiny; losing it is to perish in difference, gaining it is to accord in sameness, truly intending different names.

## Circling Ten Times, Summoning the Ten Directions

The *Inner Meaning* says: Speaking the scripture ten times around summons the true saints and high venerables of Heaven and Earth. Cultivating the elixir ten months completes the operation of yin and yang essence and creation. Circling ten times is the birth of number five, completing number five. Heaven one is water; Earth two is fire; Heaven three is wood; Earth four is metal; Heaven five is earth. Earth six is lead; Heaven seven is mercury; Earth eight is sand; Heaven nine is silver; Earth ten is elixir. Summoning the Ten Directions means odd numbers one, three, five, seven, nine are heavenly; even numbers two, four, six, eight, ten are earthly. This is the wondrous use of the returning elixir. The subtle creation is detailed later.

## The Void Sovereign Heavenly Venerable Ascends the Seat

The Void Sovereign Heavenly Venerable ascends the seat.

The Heavenly True Great Spirit, Supreme Saint High Venerable, Wondrous Conduct True Man, and countless innumerable hosts,

Are five hundred million heavens, eight circular worlds, three origins and nine saints,

Nine true and nine immortals, sun, moon, stars, and constellations, the true heavens and earth spirits.

They ride the void, flying clouds and cinnabar skies,

Three pure clouds, crimson rosy qi.

Green carriage and jade wheels, feathered canopy shading.

Long ago, the Queen Mother of the West gave the scripture to Emperor Wu; all garments, vessels, and writings follow the Han system; knowing the present and ancient, thus not detailed here.

Flowing essence and jade light, five colors flourishing, illuminating the vast void,

Flowing essence is the brilliance of sun, moon, and stars; jade light is the immortal true round image; five colors interlace, illuminating the great void.

The *Inner Meaning* says: Ascending the seat means the Golden Mother entering the chamber. The Golden Mother in the chamber pursues the two voids in the yellow path, unites the three natures in the primordial palace, clusters the Five Phases, harmonizes the Four Images—this is the Heavenly True Great Spirit, Supreme Saint High True, Wondrous Conduct True Man, and countless innumerable hosts riding the void. With spirit controlling qi and qi refining spirit, lead and mercury mutually attract, yin and yang play together, the Golden Mother shines in the spirit chamber, silver essence emits brilliance in the elixir chamber. The empty chamber births white, the spirit universe is calm; thus flying clouds and cinnabar skies, green carriage and jade wheels, feathered canopy shading, flowing essence and jade light, five colors flourishing, illuminating the vast void.

## Seven Days and Seven Nights

The heavens’ sun, moon, stars, the Northern Dipper and Jade Balance, all stop their wheels at once. The divine wind is silent; mountains and seas hide clouds. The sky has no floating haze; the four qi are clear and bright. The country’s land, mountains, rivers, forests, and trees are all equal, no longer high or low.

All the heavens are the thirty-two heavens. Each heaven has its own sun and moon. Their essence and light are the original division of this realm. The Jade Balance is the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper. The four qi are the qi of Heaven, Earth, Sun, and Moon. The true is the true transmission; the saint is the saint’s giving saint; thus receiving the three lights and stopping the wheels, mountains and seas absorb qi, the Wind Lord dares not sound the pipes, clouds cover and hide no shadows; Heaven and Earth open and bright, sun and moon clear—no night remains. This is measured by constant time, the span of seven days and seven nights. The Mysterious Master says: This is great stillness; divine light is profound; one sees the Jade Pure realm.

The *Inner Meaning* says: The *Book of Changes*’ Great Commentary says: Hardness and softness are the images of day and night. It is said that day is yang hardness, night is yin softness. Yichuan says: Hardness and softness are the coming and going of one qi. A person’s one qi coming and going is breathing. One breath out and one breath in make one breath; between one breath yin and yang divide. Breathing out is bright yang, day; breathing in is dark yin, night. The seven orifices breathe for seven days; the seven orifices inhale for seven nights. The Golden Mother’s work is unmoving heavenly mechanism; spirit is concentrated, eyes steady, pulse stops, heart rests; hence seven days and seven nights, the heavens’ sun, moon, stars, Jade Balance, and Northern Dipper stop their wheels. The divine wind is silent, breath does not enter or exit. Mountains and seas hide clouds, qi does not rise or fall. The sky has no floating haze; false thoughts and delusions do not arise. The four qi are bright and clear; movement and stillness, existence and non-existence all sent away. Thus forgetting motion and thought, all is empty, no self and no other, the nature is profound. Hence one country, land, mountains, rivers, forests, and trees are all equal, no high or low.

The earth all becomes jade, no different color. Before is heavenly omen; this is the earth’s response.

The *Inner Meaning* says: Earth is pure nature. Nature is empty and transforming, giving birth to spirit, residing in the chamber called Wu earth. Qi responds and excites with feeling, gathered in the cauldron called Ji earth. Spirit is joyful, qi quiet; nature returns to feeling’s obscurity, like flawless blue color, like pure jade without impurity; hence all earth becomes jade, no different color.

The myriad true beings attend the seat.

The *Inner Meaning* says: Using intention without division, it condenses into spirit.

The Primordial Heavenly Venerable’s mysterious seat floats above the five-colored lion,

This one is the heavenly venerable’s Dao image.

The *Inner Meaning* says: The Primordial Heavenly Venerable is the primordial spirit. The mysterious seat is the spirit chamber. Floating in emptiness is the Dharma body. The five colors are wondrous transforming qi. The lion is the heart’s knowledge. The primordial spirit in the chamber moves the heart and controls qi; the Dharma body is empty and still; the heart’s knowledge is the bright wondrous spirit controlling qi; the heart images the master—could this not be the heavenly venerable’s Dao image?

## Reciting the Scripture Once, the Great Saints of the Heavens All Praise

At this time, a whole country’s men and women, deaf and sick, all have their ears opened and become clear.

The *Inner Meaning* says: Reciting once is the birth of Heaven One water. It is the qi of Kan nurtured in Qian metal. The great saints of the heavens all praise together, all spirits flow smoothly at once. The country’s men and women represent the Dharma body’s yin and yang qi. Deafness belongs to Kan, which corresponds to the ears. When spirit and qi nourish each other, if spirit is dim, qi stagnates; if qi is disturbed, spirit is turbid—like deafness and muteness. When practice is smooth, qi calm and spirit clear, one perceives what was not perceived; hence it is said ears are opened. This is the initial stage of entering the Dao. As for bodily diseases, when encountering the scripture and method, they heal; no need for explanation.

Reciting twice, the blind see clearly.

The *Inner Meaning* says: Reciting twice is Earth Two giving birth to fire. It is the qi of Li nurtured in Xun wood. Li corresponds to the eyes; the eyes respond to the heart. When the heart is darkened by things, it is like blindness. Following the Dao, the heart opens and the mind awakens; nothing can hide, right and wrong are known, like eyes becoming clear and following the path.

Reciting thrice, the mute speak.

The *Inner Meaning* says: Reciting thrice is Heaven Three giving birth to wood. It is the qi of Zhen nurtured in Gen water. Gen is mountain; mountains are high and earth thick, springs flow there. This is the teaching of Ma Hui. Speech is sound; metal nature has it. Heaven Three gives birth to wood, and reciting thrice, mute speak—why? This shows the image of metal in wood. Metal ends in Shen and is born in You; though metal overcomes wood, wood in turn is born in the metal’s home. Metal gives birth to water; water gives birth to wood; thus metal is wood’s ancestor. Heaven Three gives birth to wood, metal’s third transmission and wood’s appearance, like the sea metal of Jiazi and Yichou. Metal is in the sea; water gives birth to Yichou; water gives birth to wood, Jia and Yi. Yang is born in Zi; three yang grow from earth. Hence Zhuangzi says: Brightly it issues from earth. From below to above, symbolizing Zhen and Dui, showing metal in wood.

Reciting four times, the lame, sick, and chronic all can rise and walk.

Chronic diseases are said to be transmitted and spread. The *Inner Meaning* says: Reciting four times is Earth Four giving birth to metal. It is the qi of Dui nurtured in Kun earth. Rising and walking is the image of planting and standing; wood nature is present. Earth Four gives birth to metal, and reciting four times, the lame, sick, and chronic all can rise and walk—why? This shows the image of wood in metal. Metal ends in Yin and is born in Mao; metal is the ghost of wood, born in the wood’s home. Wood gives birth to fire; fire gives birth to earth; earth gives birth to metal; thus wood is metal’s origin. Earth Four gives birth to metal and wood’s fourth transmission and metal’s appearance, like the sand metal of Jiawu and Yiwei. Jia and Yi are wood, giving birth to fire; Wu and Wei are fire, giving birth to earth; sand and stone are earth, giving birth to metal. Yin is born in Wu; three yin descend from Heaven. Hence Zhuangzi says: Solemnly it issues from Heaven. From above descending below, symbolizing Dui and Zhen, showing metal in wood. From this we see the principle of metal and wood’s alternation. Yet creation and transformation are subtle, not to be fully grasped by mere writing.

Reciting five times, chronic and stubborn diseases instantly recover the form.

The *Inner Meaning* says: Reciting five times is Heaven Five giving birth to earth. It is Li residing in Wu, and earth qi nurtured in Li. All things are born from earth and return to earth, as above are the five phases’ birth numbers. Chronic and stubborn diseases, according to the *Daozang*, say: Humans are the spirits of things. Life is originally forty-three thousand two hundred and some days; their spirit is thirty-six thousand primordial yang true qi. The body weighs three hundred eighty-four zhu, corresponding to Qian. Not knowing to preserve and governing its dispersion, the middle way is cut short. Qian contains six yang but does not know to move, act, or release. Knowing this cultivation is to be a spirit-immortal. From fifteen to twenty-five years, if release does not stop, true qi loses forty-eight zhu, corresponding to Gou two. Excessive desires add ten years, losing another forty-eight zhu, corresponding to Dun. Not knowing to nurture, adding ten years, losing another forty-eight zhu, corresponding to Fou. At this point is the qi of Heaven and Earth’s center; still not knowing to nurture, adding ten years, losing seventy-two zhu, corresponding to Guan. Not knowing to nurture, adding five years, losing ninety-six zhu, corresponding to Bo. Not knowing to nurture, eighty-eight sixty-four hexagrams, primordial qi is exhausted, corresponding to Kun. Kun is pure yin; only by storing valley qi does life endure. When a person reaches this, death is near; no longer able to cultivate elixir; some are worse and do not reach this end. The depletion of primordial qi is indeed chronic and stubborn disease. Instantly recovering the form means, having cultivated this Dao, true spirit grows daily, primordial qi flourishes daily, returning life and root, peaceful and long-lived—this is what is meant.

Reciting six times, white hair returns to black, teeth fall out and regrow.

The *Inner Meaning* says: Reciting six times is Heaven One giving birth to water, Earth Six completing it. Residing in the north accumulating Kan yin true qi is lead, the combination of Qian and Kan forming water in metal. Lead is the mother of metal, black lead and white metal, called white hair returning to root and source. Teeth falling and regrowing means withered returning to flourishing.

Reciting seven times, the old return to vigor, the young all become strong.

The *Inner Meaning* says: Reciting seven times is Earth Two giving birth to fire, Heaven Seven completing it. Returning south to the Li palace is mercury, the combination of Xun and Li forming fire in wood. Mercury is drawn from sand. The south is fire; mercury is also fire. Fire and fire, the image of blazing unceasing flame. The scripture says: When things are vigorous, they age; this is called not Dao. Not Dao long ago; if one does not know the way of return, then fire blazes and smoke flies, no longer preserving the old; how can one be vigorous without aging? Having reached the way of return, turning and exhausting the use, returning and restoring the source, reaching the root—thus the old become vigorous, the young become strong.

Reciting eight times, women conceive, birds and beasts bear embryos; both born and unborn obtain generation.

The *Inner Meaning* says: Reciting eight times is Heaven Three giving birth to wood, Earth Eight completing it. Returning east to Zhen is sand, the combination of Gen and Zhen forming wood in water. Sand is mercury condensed by lead qi. Sand contains mercury essence, symbolizing pregnancy. Mercury meets lead and condenses; qi meets spirit and mixes. This qi is not the postnatal yin qi in the body, but the wondrous transforming qi of prenatal generation. Students must not neglect this. The condensed qi grows stronger daily; the arising spirit qi again mixes and condenses, not following material transformation, nurturing the sacred embryo; hence both born and unborn obtain generation.

Reciting nine times, Earth Store discharges, golden jade dew forms.

The *Inner Meaning* says: Reciting nine times is Earth Four giving birth to metal, Heaven Nine completing it. Returning west to Dui is metal, the combination of Kun and Dui forming metal in earth. Mercury returns to the earth cauldron and becomes treasure. The *Cantong Qi* says: When metal returns to nature initially, it is called the returning elixir, the so-called one qi returning to origin. Heaven One’s water is born from empty qi metal embryo, not yet showing metal substance. Earth Four giving birth to metal is still a transforming mechanism; at this point it returns to origin and restores nature, residing in the central palace, the elixir body with mysterious image. The central palace is earth. Earth is the land; the Golden Mother dwells within; hence Earth Store discharges, golden jade dew forms.

Reciting ten times, withered bones revive, all rise as adults.

The *Inner Meaning* says: Reciting ten times is Heaven Five giving birth to earth, Earth Ten completing it. It is Li residing in Ji, earth formed in fire, residing in the center as the basis of myriad things’ generation and the elixir body. The Dao scripture says: The unity of qi is harmony. The harmony in qi allows all things to be born. Heaven Five’s earth is the yang earth; Earth Ten’s earth is yin earth; the two earths alternate, metal dwells within. Hence the returning elixir is called the knife and jade. The wonder of the returning elixir is returning old to young, transcending the mundane to the sacred. People who expect death, when raised and examined, are all walking corpses. Having obtained this Dao and cultivating it, one lives long, not as a spirit of spring and soil; is this not withered bones revived, all rising as adults? This is the completion number of the Five Phases. The Han Celestial Master’s preface to the *Golden Liquid Divine Elixir Scripture* says: The path of immortals is wondrous words, the ultimate reason, the great truth. Already recorded in the profound lineage, not a hair’s breadth is omitted. The Most High also expounds this wondrous empty Dao.

At this time, the whole country, men and women alike, all wholeheartedly receive protection and salvation, all attain longevity.

Those who clearly obtain the Dao live long and do not die. At this time, the country’s men and women, neither old nor young, all receive the sacred grace and universally attain salvation. The living do not die; the dead are reborn.

The *Inner Meaning* says: One country is like one body; men and women are yin and yang. Wholehearted means affinity. Protection and salvation mean proper nourishment. Yin and yang mutually attract; spirit and qi are nourished; the body is peaceful and the Dao flourishes; this is the principle of longevity.

## Scroll Two of the Profound Inner Meaning of the Supreme Grade Sublime Scripture of the Primordial Infinite Salvation of Beings

Guanfuzi Xiao Yingsou’s Study

The Dao says: At this time, the Primordial Heavenly Venerable

Recites the scripture once, the eastern limitless infinite grade supreme true great spirits innumerable arrive floating in the void.

Recites twice, the southern limitless infinite grade supreme true great spirits innumerable arrive floating in the void.

Recites thrice, the western limitless infinite grade supreme true great spirits innumerable arrive floating in the void.

Recites four times, the northern limitless infinite grade supreme true great spirits innumerable arrive floating in the void.

Recites five times, the northeast limitless infinite grade supreme true great spirits innumerable arrive floating in the void.

Recites six times, the southeast limitless infinite grade supreme true great spirits innumerable arrive floating in the void.

Recites seven times, the southwest limitless infinite grade supreme true great spirits innumerable arrive floating in the void.

Recites eight times, the northwest limitless infinite grade supreme true great spirits innumerable arrive floating in the void.

Recites nine times, the upper limitless infinite grade supreme true great spirits innumerable arrive floating in the void.

Recites ten times, the lower limitless infinite grade supreme true great spirits innumerable arrive floating in the void.

The *Inner Meaning* says: In scripture terms, the Heavenly Venerable reciting ten times summons the great spirits of the Ten Directions, including the Three Origins and Nine Saints, Nine True and Nine Immortals, High True and Supreme Saint, heavenly gods and earth spirits, all gathering in the Beginning Azure Heaven Floating Realm to hear the Dharma. In alchemy terms, the Primordial’s recitation is the true lead as the medicine ancestor, mysterious essence as the elixir base. Ten times is the number of Heaven and Earth’s generation. The Ten Directions are the number of the Five Phases’ coordination. Odd numbers one, three, five, seven, nine are heavenly numbers, twenty-five in total, yang essence. Even numbers two, four, six, eight, ten are earthly numbers, thirty in total, yin blossoms. One to five correspond to the four cardinal upper directions; six to ten correspond to the four intercardinal lower directions. The five birth numbers of yang are the root of the Five Phases. The ten completion numbers of yin are the root of myriad transformations. One and nine, four and six combine to ten, metal and water share origin; two and eight, three and seven combine to ten, wood and fire share body. In sum, fifty-five divided among five directions. One and six in the north; two and seven in the south; three and eight in the east; four and nine in the west; five and ten in the center. Dividing by law, the five directions remove one through five, leaving water, fire, wood, metal, earth’s origin. Removing one through five leaves the Five Phases’ root. Outside the five directions remain five numbers, twenty-five in total, the body of true yang Wu earth. Dividing root numbers twenty-five by the Five Phases’ base, north one, south two, east three, west four, center five. Thus north leaves four numbers symbolizing metal; metal gives birth to water. Metal in turn is born of water, like lead born from silver qi; lead contains silver, like child bearing mother. Metal is the tiger. Metal in water is the tiger born in water. South leaves three numbers symbolizing wood; wood gives birth to fire; wood in turn is born of fire, like mercury condensing lead qi to form sand; sand comes from mercury, child bearing mother. Wood is the dragon. The dragon emerges wrapped in fire. East leaves two numbers symbolizing fire; fire born of wood; mercury drawn from sand; this is the sevenfold return of cinnabar returning to root. West leaves one number symbolizing water; water born of metal; one qi returns to origin; this is the ninefold return of golden liquid returning to truth. The center is emptiness; the four images combine to form ten, showing true yin Ji earth’s natural wondrous use. Hence Zhang Ziyang said: The dragon of Zhen emerges from the fire’s home; the tiger of Dui lead is born in Kan’s place. These two arise from child bearing mother; the Five Phases all enter the center. He also said: The red dragon and black tiger face west and east; the four images intersect in Wu and Ji. From this, Gou can operate; who says the golden elixir does not succeed? The Great One True Man said: The Five Phases reversed, the dragon emerges from fire. The Five Phases not in order, the tiger is born in water—this is it.

The innumerable great spirits arriving take the true pure traces of Qian and Kun’s hidden operation as law images, dividing three hundred eighty-four lines, cycling fire within, operating the five stars and twenty-eight mansions, arrayed around the cauldron, compressing three thousand six hundred true qi, revolving seventy-two seasonal nodes, driving sixty-four hexagrams’ yin talismans, beating twenty-four qi’s yang fire. Subtle and detailed, seen in the hidden language of the Heart Mirror. Hence Heaven and Earth cannot hide creation’s mechanism; yin and yang cannot conceal the nurturing root. From this, spirit transformations are boundless, pure and complete, all within grasp, mixed in the empty cavity.

Someone asked Master Cheng Yichuan: The sage does not study immortals; their methods differ. Can the sage do such things? He said: This is a thief in Heaven and Earth; if not stealing creation’s mechanism, how could one extend life? Hence the *Yinfu Scripture* says: Humans are thieves of all things. Stealing creation and robbing all things means all in Heaven and Earth belong to me; taking without restriction, using without exhaustion.

After ten recitations, the true great spirits of the Ten Directions arrive together. The country’s men and women wholeheartedly revere; those arriving are like fine rain and dense mist. The innumerable hosts fill half the country; the earth is all uneven, not to be restrained.

The Heavenly Venerable opens the country; myriad saints all gather; majesty and virtue are exalted, heavily bearing beyond measure; thus the earth is uneven. Extraordinary events bring extraordinary responses. Master Niutou Fazong lecturing on the *Great Prajñā Sutra*, at the chapter of perfect stillness, caused the earth to tremble—how much more the Void Sovereign’s transformation!

The *Inner Meaning* says: After ten recitations, the ten directions’ true great spirits arrive together means spirit rests and concentrates; qi returns to the chamber. The country’s men and women wholeheartedly revere means the body’s yin and yang qi mix and refine. The gathering of spirit and qi is dense and fragrant. The *Cantong Qi* says: Sand and mercury enter the five viscera; the mist scatters like wind and rain. Metal is the utmost essence of Heaven and Earth, the spirit. Sand is the pure essence of yin and yang, the qi. Hence it says: Those arriving are like fine rain and dense mist. The innumerable hosts reach the golden essence behind the elbow; true qi passes the Yang Pass; nature and feeling mingle; heavenly mechanism silently operates; yin and yang excite each other; true spirits transform. Though the body is natural and the operation spontaneous, still there are changes of agitation overcoming cold, stillness overcoming heat. This is due to holding and filling; nature and feeling are not yet clear. Nature and feeling belong to earth; hence it says the country is half full, the earth is all uneven, not to be restrained.

## The Primordial Suspended Treasure Pearl

A pearl as large as a millet grain, suspended in the empty mystery, five zhang above the earth.

The pearl symbolizes the Dao, suspended in the empty mystery, also the meaning of the mysterious pearl. Within the scripture transmission, the treasure within treasure, mystery within mystery, true within true, Dao within Dao. Five zhang above the earth means removing the five turbidities of the world, escaping the use of the Five Phases. When the five turbidities all vanish, no more troubles arise; when the Five Phases are unused, they forever cease mutual conflict. Therefore, the Five Phases do not conflict; all things can be preserved; naturally one lives long and sees far, attaining the Dao and becoming true. The Mysterious Master says: This is the Jade Pure treasure pearl, the path of spirit transformation and immortal embryo.

The *Inner Meaning* says: The Primordial suspended pearl is spirit and Dao together. Previously the scripture said the lion above is the spirit condensed in the chamber, creating something from nothing. Now this pearl suspended in the empty mystery is beyond spirit and form, beyond existence and non-existence. The Heavenly Venerable considers later generations’ ignorance, who do not understand this principle and only cling to stubborn emptiness, so he reveals wondrous transformation, showing that within utmost non-being, there is utmost truth and essence. The scripture says: Dim and dark, within there is essence; the essence is very true; within there is faith. In principle, this is spirit’s dark nature returning, perfectly round and bright, clear without cover, empty without base. Bright and joyful, dim and silent, not the number of the Five Phases, not the realm of the five turbidities. Master Chuan said: Having form and seeking both are delusion; formless and unseen fall into partial decay. Vast and dense, never separated; one Dao’s cold light shines through the great void.

The Primordial ascends and summons the Heavenly True Great Spirit, Supreme Saint High Venerable, Wondrous Conduct True Man, the limitless true great spirits of the Ten Directions, and innumerable hosts, all enter the treasure pearl. The heavens and humans look up, only seeing a rushing stream enter the pearl’s mouth; once inside, their location is unknown.

The Heavenly Venerable performs wondrous great transformation; the suspended pearl in the empty mystery is beyond measure in its connection. He ascends and leads the Three Origins and Nine Saints, Nine True and Nine Immortals, all enter within. All the heavens and humans, except the true saints and immortals, find it difficult to follow the non-action transformation and cannot enter the mystery of empty mystery; they only look up and see the rushing stream enter the pearl’s mouth; once inside, their location is unknown. Like a lower-level immortal having the subtlety of holding the mustard seed and the greatness of the universe in a gourd, how much more the great saintly Heavenly Venerable expounding great transformation and manifesting spirit changes.

The pearl said to be as large as a millet grain is already subtle; suspended five zhang above, seeing the pearl in the empty mystery is beyond heavens and humans; none but the wise can see it. Moreover, seeing its mouth is the Heavenly Venerable ascending and leading the saints into the wondrous realm of existence and non-existence. At that time, following the Heavenly Venerable into the pearl, the heavens and humans looking up see those entering the pearl but cannot see the pearl’s inner mystery.

The *Inner Meaning* says: When the true spirit is dark, qi is also quiet; harmonizing emptiness and non-being, ascending to mystery and entering wonder. It is said: Gathering myriad things into one breath, dispersing one breath into myriad things. Welcoming it, one sees no head; following it, one sees no tail. It comes from nowhere, goes to nowhere.

## The People’s Confusion Disperses, the Earth Returns to Level Stillness; No More Unevenness

The *Inner Meaning* says: Movement and stillness both forgotten; existence and non-existence both sent away.

The Primordial then speaks within the pearl, the scripture fully completed.

The *Inner Meaning* says: Primordial is spirit pearl, that is nature. Speaking scripture means clarifying ancestral qi as the elixir’s body. Completion means spirit and nature are perfectly bright, nothing left.

The myriad true beings supervise salvation and give it to me.

The *Inner Meaning* says: The myriad true beings are the wondrous transforming qi. I am the Dao Lord.

At this time, joy and celebration are beyond words. The ritual is roughly completed; the heavens return to their places. In a flash, silence without echo.

The *Inner Meaning* says: At the time of practice, wondrous responses are hard to describe. Like drinking water, cold or warm is known by oneself. When the work is complete, myriad spirits return to origin; in the midst of confusion, the light fades.

At this time, heavenly beings encountering the scripture and method universally receive salvation, complete their original lifespan, with no harm.

The *Inner Meaning* says: Examining the past and present, the principle is not far. Scripture, method, and alchemy share one principle. The Sixth Patriarch said: I now speak the Dharma like timely rain, moistening the great earth. Your Buddha nature is like seeds; encountering this moisture, all sprout. This is the principle of encountering scripture and method, universally receiving salvation. The inner image forms the body—this is the meaning. Those who obtain it know their spirit and love it, understand their qi and treasure it, can complete their original lifespan without harm. Original lifespan means not encountering sudden calamity. When a step is taken upward, progress must be made.

## The Earth Inclines in Reverence; All Practice Benevolent Hearts

No killing or harming; no jealousy or envy; no illicit sex or theft; no greed or desire; no hatred or harsh words; no flowery speech; no evil voice. All equal in compassion and love; different bones become kin.

The *Duanming* says: Killing and injuring is harm; hating others’ success is jealousy; hating peers is envy; men and women not observing rites is illicit sex; stealing others’ goods is theft; insatiable is greed; craving is desire; hating others is hatred; suspicion is envy. When the ten evils are extinguished, different bones become kin; myriad practices harmonize; voices have no harshness. The illicit sex section means men and women not observing rites, to correct human relations. Cultivators must cut it off; hence the *Taiwei Lingshu* lists lust as the chief of ten defeats. Once the Purple Void Sovereign and Lord Mao examined the true immortals’ gains and losses, forty-seven were instantly lost, only two restored, all due to harboring lustful thoughts. Practicing the upper truth is not only instant loss but also subject to the Three Officials’ examination. Those seeking longevity should not harbor such thoughts. The theft section is not only stealing others’ goods but also taking without Dao. The desire section is not only craving but selfishness. The Most High said: No sin is greater than desire; no fault greater than craving. When desire arises, all the above evils arise. Thus causing disorder in the state and chaos among beings. Should one not beware?

The *Inner Meaning* says: Human hearts are all good; none are not good. But because of worldly desires, they are obscured, forgetting their original nature. Once hearing the Dao essentials, all evils melt away; self and others are one; kinship and estrangement vanish. The above matters are detailed in the *Ganying Pian*, the daily errors of the world. Scholar Li Changling of Shu explained cause and effect in over one hundred thousand words; reading it chills the spine. No private thought dares arise; it benefits the world’s teaching. Carefully observing the scripture’s purpose, all practicing benevolent hearts, no killing or harming, etc., means no evil thoughts at all. If even a tiny evil thought lurks in the heart, it cannot be called good. Why? Jade with a slight flaw is still called good jade? Good and evil do not wait to be seen in deeds; once a thought arises, spirit and clarity already record it. Once Wei Zhongda was a hall officer, taken to the Underworld. The Underworld officials showed him two records of good and evil. Upon comparison, the evil record filled the hall, the good record was like a thin strip. The official’s face changed and weighed them; the small scale tipped evil records, shaking the earth. The official rejoiced: You may leave. Wei said: I am not yet forty; how could I have so much evil? The official said: No; but your thoughts were not right, so it was recorded without your committing. Wei said: Then what did the small scale record? The official said: The court once undertook great works, building the Three Mountains and Stone Bridge; you advised against it, this is the memorial. Wei said: Though I said it, the court did not listen; what use is it? How could it have such power? The official said: Though the court did not listen, your thoughts were on the court; this is already. Had they listened, your good power would be even greater. You will see by this you gain salvation; how could the official detain you? Alas, too many evil thoughts halve your power; no longer can you hope for great ascent. Alas! Empty thoughts still reduce blessings; how much more if truly committing! Good and evil cause and effect are hard to fully record; but reading Fan Wenzheng’s account of Dou Jianyi’s *Yinde Lu* suffices to know goodness is possible. Some say: Though I treat others well, they repay me badly; how can it be fair? No; if you know the words of the Southern Pole Red Lord, then qi naturally balances. The Southern Pole Red Lord said: If a person meets me with calamity, just repay with blessing; then the qi of blessing always grows in me; the qi of harm and heavy disaster arises in them. This is the great practice of the Dao. Would the Southern Pole Red Lord deceive people?

## The Country is Peaceful and the People Flourish, Rejoicing in Great Peace

This is the result of all practicing benevolent hearts.

The *Inner Meaning* says: According to Laozi’s teaching to Master Ganji on the way of peace: When a person is born, Heaven entrusts spirit, Earth entrusts essence, Harmony entrusts qi. If one can preserve essence, love spirit, and protect qi, internally the body is preserved and lives long; externally the country is peaceful. Also: Ministers should love their ruler, wishing their longevity. Sons should remember parents, fearing their death, transforming their minds to enter the Dao, always seeking rare methods and special techniques to serve ruler and parents. Disciples should remember their masters’ grace. People are born from parents, cultivate virtue and morality from masters, gain honor from rulers. Always thinking of ruler, parents, and masters, when old with no return, or studying anew, wise ones seek rare methods and special techniques to benefit. This is responding to the Most Ancient Supreme Sovereign’s best loyal ministers, filial sons, and obedient disciples. If all do so, the world will be peaceful. What is internal must have external; good deeds manifest as blessing, spirit clarity as wisdom. Blessing and wisdom cultivate together, internal and external benefit. The country is like the body; the people like qi. The country has a ruler; the body has a heart. When the ruler governs, the people are peaceful; when the heart is right, qi is harmonious. The scripture says: I do nothing and the people transform themselves; I love stillness and the people correct themselves; I have no affairs and the people become rich; I have no desires and the people become simple. Governing the country and cultivating the heart are one and the same.

## The Scripture First Teaches One Country; Those with Sincere Hearts Embrace It, Revering Ritual and Respect, All Attain Salvation

The *Inner Meaning* says: The scripture is given and established; people follow the Dao; “pre” means beforehand, prior. People are born with Dao qi; is the heart not peaceful? Because of attachment to illusions and delusions, confusion and darkness, once encountering scripture and method, the heart brightens again. This means now pointing out the elixir body, which is everyone’s original possession, not something absent before hearing scripture or Dao. Though obtained after hearing scripture and Dao, it existed before hearing. Hence it says: “Pre-existing sincere heart.” “Zong” means to trace the Dao; “Feng” means to revere the text; “Li” means to honor the method; “Jing” means to respect virtue. Hence the *Benqi Scripture* says: Those who cultivate the Dao should know the Dao, virtue, scripture, and practice methods. Dao means path; Dao virtue means good merit; scripture means path; practice means walking steps; method means accomplishment. The Dao scripture can be cultivated to attain Dao; there is a path to follow. If people can follow this, all will attain salvation.

## The Dao Says: The Names Spoken by the Primordial Heavenly Venerable in the Scripture Are the Hidden Rhymes of the Heavenly Emperors, the Inner Sounds of the Jade Characters, Also the Secret Names of Demon Kings and Hundred Spirits, Not Common Words of the World

The *Inner Meaning* says: The so-called hidden rhymes of the Heavenly Emperor, secret names of demon kings, hidden names of hundred spirits, are like the *Alchemy Scripture* saying: Sun soul, moon corporeal soul; Geng tiger, Jia dragon; mercury and cinnabar; red lead and black tin; yellow bud and white snow; beautiful maid and infant; old woman and golden lord; furnace, stove, cauldron, vessel, etc. Though names differ, all are the primordial one qi, not other mixed yin things.

## The Supreme Saint Has Become a True Man, Penetrating the Profound and Subtle

The *Inner Meaning* says: The Supreme Saint cultivates the wondrous Dao, having attained success. The True Man understands the secret purpose, recognizing the profound subtlety. It is practical, not clinging to empty words. Like the Mixed Cavity Red Script, the Primordial Ancestral Kalpa opening the Three Sceneries, great operation of Brahma qi—knowing their essence, grasping the key mechanism, then the mystery of Heaven and Earth’s creation, life and death, existence and non-existence, is right before the eyes, not far outside the body.

## Recite It Ten Times

The *Inner Meaning* says: Having penetrated the profound and subtle, one can know the Dao; the effect of ten recitations equals the Primordial. In alchemy terms, ten recitations mean the work of ten months entering the chamber, the principle of nine cycles.

The heavens chant from afar, praising its merit. Myriad emperors set rites, honoring the scripture. Rivers and seas are silent.

Duke Zhou governs; seas do not raise waves. The True Man recites scripture; rivers clear and seas calm. Different matters, one principle; different merits, same virtue.

Mountains and rivers hide clouds.

Clouds gather for rain, nourishing myriad things.

The sun and moon stop shining; the Jade Balance does not move.

The effect of ten recitations equals the Primordial, this is what is meant.

Demons bind forms; ghosts and spirits perish.

The scripture says binding means sending away demons and spirits, cutting off the six ghosts’ blades.

Reviving corpses and raising the dead; withered bones become adults.

Laozi raised Xu Jia’s withered bones.

The *Inner Meaning* says: The heavens chant from afar; myriad emperors set rites—this is what Zhuangzi called serene and limitless, with all beauty following; Heaven and Earth’s virtue, the sage’s Dao. Rivers and seas are silent, the bitter rivers and seas. All are illusions of the human heart; love arises from emotion; suffering arises from cognition. When virtue matches Heaven and Earth, Dao matches saintly truth, then the river of love calms, the sea of suffering is silent. Mountains and rivers hide clouds; the *Yellow Court Scripture* says: The clouds of the Five Mountains are the clouds of the five viscera. The True Man’s breath is deep, the five viscera’s qi full, like mountains gathering clouds. The sun and moon are the two eyes; brightness is spirit. The True Man’s spirit does not wander outside; though eyes see things, they are still and unmoving; hence it says stopping the light. The Jade Balance is the Northern Dipper. The human heart is like the pole; turning but not moving; watching and inspecting, seeming unmoving. The True Man lets nature be; though the heart responds to things, it is always serene and still; hence it says not moving. The demons are myriad and confusing, disturbing the heart. Letting nature be, responding as if nothing, this is called binding forms. Ghost spirits are the three corpses. The three corpses must go; without them, Dao cannot be accomplished. Those who embody purity and simplicity, the three corpses vanish; the five viscera’s spirits each settle their posts; hence they are called attendants. The Three Realms are the three corpses. They are the three parts of the body’s yin turbid and dark evil qi, belonging to the three disciples’ realm. The upper corpse Peng Ju dwells in the head; the middle corpse Peng Zhi dwells in the intestines; the lower corpse Peng Qiao dwells in the feet. Human desires and lusts, various evils, are all caused by the corpses and ghosts. On the Gengshen day, they go to the heavenly bureau and report all sins without omission, wishing the person to die soon, rejoicing. Hence Ge Zhichuan said: Can you sever the three Peng enemies? The three Peng are the three corpses. There are many methods to remove them, all recorded in the *Daozang*’s Gengshen section. Yet none is better than the golden elixir. An ancient poem says: Exhausting the infinite methods of the world, except the elixir kills the three corpses. Zhang Zhenren said: Since the Gengjia Shen decree, killing the three corpses, the Dao is achievable. This is forging evil into virtue, transforming stubbornness into goodness, being subdued and controlled; hence it says kowtowing. Demon spirits and ghosts are the nine worms and six thieves. The three corpses are the ringleaders; the worms and thieves are followers. Destroy the ringleaders and the followers collapse; hence it says losing eyes and extinguishing brightness. If so, one can extend the years of near death, continue the lost life; spirit and qi grow strong; students strive and practice; the merit is obvious.

## Why? Because the scholar’s defilements are not yet eliminated, the body not yet fully true; summoning the Ten Directions, power not yet commanding Heaven’s governance. Virtue can subdue earth spirits, bind demons, but only repel death, cannot revive.

The *Inner Meaning* says: The scholar’s desires not cut off, nature and principle unclear, though exploring refinement diligently, the mystery is not attained; only able to preserve spirit and conserve qi, subdue yin demons, prolong life, repel disease. The way of longevity is not yet to be hoped for.

Lightly reciting this chapter brings harm to the body.

Meaning not properly arranging garments, not following ritual, standing, sitting, sleeping, merely reciting casually. If reciting without reverence, better not to recite than to recite disrespectfully.

The *Inner Meaning* says: Light recitation means light practice of the Dao. The essence of the golden elixir is harmony and adjustment; first movement in gathering, then caution in fullness. Awaiting the cauldron’s completion, the medicine is complete; then operate talismans and add fire, mercury and lead, timing and season matching, no error. When yin and yang qi are sufficient, the pearl of Li and Kan is round; spirit transforms and becomes true; living long and seeing far. If the mind is restless and lazy, acting recklessly, seasons differ, talisman and timing do not respond, then in midwinter or midsummer, extreme frost or heat, the beautiful maid flees, the red dragon runs wild. Spirit and essence lost, golden liquid hard to find, qi weakens the body, form declines and the body dies.

## Offering Respectful Rituals, Gates Flourish

Generations prosper, with good causes. Ten thousand disasters do not affect; spirits protect the gates.

The *Inner Meaning* says: If cultivation is sincere and reverent, externally the dwelling flourishes and prospers; internally body and mind are peaceful and calm. Daily renewing virtue, moving with auspicious meetings, disasters do not invade; spirits guard and protect.

## This Scripture Is Supreme and Wondrous, Alone Walking the Jade Capital

Infinite salvation of beings, the root of myriad paths. Majestic and vast, virtue hard to surpass.

The *Inner Meaning* says: The *Seven Signs Scripture Teaching Section* says: The Three Caverns are the wondrous essence of the one vehicle, the profound words of the three realms. Those who understand can ascend to Supreme Saint; those who awaken can rise to High True. Dragon scripts and phoenix seals reveal the excellent explanation of ultimate principle; jade slips and golden books guide and return to the root’s essential technique. This scripture is supreme and wondrous, alone walking the Jade Capital, the crown of the Three Caverns. From ancient to now, no immortal or true saint has not cultivated and verified by it. Records and books are complete, unknown how many. All dharmas and myriad gates arise from it. Majestic and vast, beyond name and thought.

The Dao says: Whoever recites this scripture ten times, all heavens arrive together; countless ancestors and spirits of suffering immediately receive salvation, ascending to the Vermilion Palace.

Those who recite are not limited by rank; if able to recite with precision and heart ten times, all heavens arrive together, saints descend and gather in the hall and temple, extracting ancestral spirits from obscurity and suffering spirits from bitterness, descending from the Northern Mansion and ascending to the Southern Palace.

The term “rank” means nine years. Receiving transformation and rebirth, becoming noble persons; those diligent in study, upon completing the scripture’s merit and virtue, all become spirits and immortals, ascending the Golden Pavilion, roaming and feasting in the Jade Capital.

Rank of nine years means the nine-year rank, the number of the three fires, three times three equals nine. The Vermilion Palace belongs to the south, associated with fire refining the form; hence three fires. After nine years of refinement and transformation, rebirth as nobility. After birth, cultivate this scripture. Formerly, those who needed to practice it still exist. After countless merits and full virtue, they transcend and ascend, directly attaining immortality, serving the saintly lord, roaming the Jade Capital and visiting the Primordial.

According to the *Three Origins Admonitions*, the Vermilion salvation ranks have three levels: great fortune three years, middle fortune nine years, small fortune twenty-four years. Nine years approximates the middle fortune rank.

The *Inner Meaning* says: Ten recitations correspond to the month’s principle. All heavens arriving together means myriad spirits returning to unity. Countless ancestors are the temporary union of parents; spirits of suffering are the turbid qi after having a body, all receive salvation. Ascending to the Vermilion Palace means refining and transforming the temporary turbid qi, transcending into the realm of bright spirit. Rank of nine years means receiving transformation and rebirth. Becoming noble means melting and refining the temporary turbid qi, all transforming to yang spirit, reborn true qi, myriad spirits becoming one spirit, myriad qi becoming one qi, nurturing the sacred embryo. When scholars reach this level, they have obtained spirit, complete qi, extended life and long years. The so-called immortals are not yet spoken of. Hence it says: Those diligent in study, upon completing scripture merit and virtue, all become spirits and immortals; yet further cultivation is needed. Internal work accomplished, virtue and conduct may be hoped for. Internal work is the way of fire seasons, detaching the fetus and spirit transformation. The cultivation method is detailed later. Virtue and conduct must benefit beings and help people, like the Han Celestial Master distinguishing humans and ghosts, Ge Xianweng universally saving spirits, Xu Zhenjun exterminating and cutting dragons and snakes. The scripture says: Even if scholars guard the Dao but do not create merit and virtue, they cannot attain the Dao. Formerly, the Han Celestial Master’s elixir was completed but not taken; he said to Master Wang: When the divine elixir is completed and taken, surely one will soar to Heaven and become a True Man. Yet I have no great virtue; one must serve country and people, remove harm and promote benefit, then take the elixir lightly and ascend. I have no shame in serving the Three Realms. Only thus can one ascend the Golden Pavilion and roam the Jade Capital.

## Advanced Scholars Cultivating and Reciting This Scripture Immediately Receive Salvation, Flying Up to the Southern Palace

Advanced scholars hear the Dao and diligently practice; seeing the Dharma, they must study; from beginning to end without interruption, cold or heat without loss. These are the immortals named below the Nine Palaces of Supreme Clarity. Having cultivated and recited this scripture, the body attains the Dao and ascends to the immortal realm, receiving refinement in the Southern Palace Vermilion Mansion. When soul and spirit ascend to immortality, fire refines ghostly essence; when the living boat attains the Dao, fire refines filth. Hence all enter the Southern Palace; then ascend to the true original place.

## Ordinary People Receiving Recitation Extend Life and Longevity; Later All Obtain the Way of Corpse Liberation; Soul and Spirit Temporarily Extinguish, Skipping Hell, Immediately Returning to Form, Roaming the Great Void

Ordinary people are the common flow, not extraordinary ones. Because their ancestral blessings are shallow and their body’s merit slight, they enjoy long life before death; after death, their form dissolves and temporarily extinguishes. Yet they do not abide by the Three Officials’ system, nor accept the hardships of the Nine Mansions. Their terms are limited; they ascend and descend; then spirit returns to form. Having changed appearance in the Three Palaces’ halls, changed youthful face in the Nine Refinements’ chambers, they do not enter the Southern Upper Palace but roam the great void.

Corpse liberation has four types:

1. Military liberation, like Ji Kang’s death in the market, Huainan’s shape in prison.

2. Literary liberation, like Ci Qing’s change of form in shoes, Chang Fang’s borrowed form in bamboo.

3. Water-fire refining of form, like Feng Yi drowning in the great river, Fengzi burning in fire trees
