#### Preface to the Commentary on the Supreme Cavernous Profound Numinous Treasure Primordial Infinite Deliverance Scripture of the Highest Grade

The Great Unity contains the True Qi, truly the wondrous Dao and immortal lineage. The *Numinous Treasure Deliverance Scripture* is called the Cavernous Profound Highest Grade. It gives birth to Heaven and Earth, closes and opens yin and yang, enabling the operation of creation and transformation, relying on primordial merit that is vast and expansive. It illuminates the sun and moon, turns the stars, universally nurtures the spirits, and transforms and births the myriad kinds.

In the *Dao De Jing*, it is said that non-action (wu wei) comes first, and action (you wei) second. The highest virtue is non-action; the lower virtue is action. The highest benevolence is non-action; the highest righteousness is action. But this *Deliverance Scripture* places action first and non-action last. The mysterious throne floating in emptiness is action; the profound wisdom and clear insight is non-action. The celestial pivot and jade balance, stopping the wheels at a moment, is action; the ten directions purified, rivers and seas silent and still, is non-action.

Therefore, the scripture is recited ten times in full, and withered bones become human again. Those with merit diligently report upward to the heavens, and myriad gods pay homage. The thirty-two heavens and thirty-two emperors reveal the transformations of ancestral kalpas and the birth of the heavens’ secret names. These secret names of the heavens are hidden to prevent arrogance among heavenly beings and humans. If arrogance leaks, calamity reaches the seven ancestors; if diligent practice is maintained, one attains the rank of immortal elder.

This scripture is never transmitted through kalpas; it is treasured by Heaven. Why is it called the Numinous Treasure? Qi is called numinous; essence is called treasure. Still and unmoving, responding and thus communicating, it is called numinous. Above there is no ancestor, only the Dao as body, it is called treasure. When qi unites and essence gathers, it is called the highest grade. When spirit communicates and Dao unites, it is called deliverance of people. Thus, one knows that the numinous treasure is essence and qi. Essence and qi are mercury and lead. Mercury and lead are yin and yang. Yin and yang are Li and Kan. Without obtaining the dao of action, and yet achieving completion, how then could they condense and form a pearl the size of millet?

When a person is first born, the non-being unites with being, stealing the true one qi of Heaven and Earth, binding and wrapping it to endow the form. Gestating ten months, shedding the fetal stalk, taking daily nectar and nightly milk, then the form is complete and the spirit king perfect, spirit complete and essence pure, essence full and the harmonious qi abundant and sealed. The ancient sages say: when qi is complete, one does not think of food; when spirit is complete, one does not think of sleep; when essence is complete, one does not think of desire. At this time, it is called Pure Yang. Pure Yang is Qian.

The superior person practices the highest virtue of non-action here, cultivating inwardly and working outwardly; then even the demon king reveres the form, and one attains spirit immortality. Those with shallow learning of the Dao do not delight in the immortal path; thus, few preserve the true, many are confused. They dwell in the realm of drunken life and dream death, burning in the sea of desires and river of love, so the qi they originally received from Heaven and Earth secretly flees and lodges in Kun (Earth).

Following this, Kun rides on one Yang of Qian and becomes Kan; Qian, because Kun breaks and loses one Yang, becomes Li. Carefully examine: desire arises from love; love follows emotion; emotion follows circumstance and becomes chaotic. How much more so with joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure; worry, sighing, change, and distress, day and night alternating before one, clashing and wearing with things? How could one know that things come without end, but the heart has boundaries?

Therefore, the immortal path is difficult to establish, the ghostly path easily leads astray. When fate responds to extinction and deliverance, the body undergoes Taiyin, endlessly cycling without return. How great the sorrow and compassion! The perfected person and immortal child, upon encountering a true master, suddenly awaken to the human path, their heart sincere and not led by others. Yet at the moment when the one qi secretly wanes, they early practice the numinous treasure deliverance dao to restore it.

What is restoration? It is the lower virtue dao of action, the highest righteousness dao of doing, the primordial suspended pearl dao, the flowing Wu to Ji dao, the dragon-subduing and tiger-suppressing dao, the refining of lead and drying of mercury dao, the golden liquid returning to truth, the wondrous form and spirit dao. When one comprehends this, one then believes in the subtlety of Earth Store’s release, the merit of golden jade dew form. Completing one’s original year, all obtain longevity, surpass the Three Realms, ascend the vast space — all matters within one’s own.

Carefully examining this scripture, the Primordial Heavenly Venerable at the dawn of the Dragon Han, when Heaven and Earth first divided and the jade characters appeared, composed this scripture. At that time, he wrote with a purple brush in the empty blue forest; the characters were all broad and long, one zhang in size, to present to Jade Morning Dao Lord. Jade Morning passed it to Mysterious One Perfected, Mysterious One to Heavenly True Sovereign. The Sovereign carefully wrote the text as correct pronunciation and secretly stored it.

In the time of Xuanyuan, the Sovereign met with the Three Immortals of Supreme Clarity on Mount Emei; the Yellow Emperor bowed twice and asked about the Dao. The Sovereign granted him the text of the Five Teeth and Three Ones, along with the upper scroll of the *Deliverance Scripture*. The Yellow Emperor cultivated it to become a supreme immortal. Later, Emperor Ku at the Mu De Terrace received from the Sovereign the *Original Chapter* and *Jade Calendar Chapter*. During the Yuanfeng era of the Western Han, the Queen Mother of the West presented the upper scroll and two chapters to Emperor Wu, completing the full scripture.

In the Eastern Han, the Supreme One descended to grant Gan Ji the *Spiritual Book Upper Volume* and the *Great Peace Scripture* of one hundred and fifty scrolls. During Emperor Huan’s time, Laozi descended to Shu, granting the Celestial Master the *Deliverance* and *Northern Dipper* scriptures, recording over one thousand scrolls. In the Hao era, the Supreme Ultimate Perfected on Mount Kuaiji’s Shangyu Mountain granted the Supreme Ultimate Left Palace Immortal Elder Ge Xuan the *Deliverance Scripture*, adding the *Spiritual Book Middle Volume*. Zheng Perfected Thought Far passed the *Baopuzi* version to Ge Hong, adding the *Spiritual Book Upper and Lower Volumes* and the *Later Preface of the Supreme Ultimate Perfected*, which is the complete current version.

During the Jin dynasty, King Zuan met the Dao Lord and was granted this scripture along with dozens of others. In the Yuan-Wei period, Kou Qianzhi cultivated on Mount Song and was inspired by the Supreme One to grant this scripture and over sixty other scriptures. As the scripture circulated, people knew to recite and analyze it, but did not know the method of long-term inner alchemy it contained. Since the Zhenghe imperial commentary, followed by annotations by Xue Youqi, Yan Dongqi, Cheng Xuanying, Li Shaowei, and others, and again at the start of the Baoqing era, Xiao Guan recompiled the *Inner Meaning and Elixir Instructions of Deliverance*. These are all the diligent and ultimate scholars.

I, due to fate meeting the true master, was granted the secret of the Golden Liquid Great Return Fire Talisman, wishing to let the world fully understand this Dao. Therefore, I annotated the *Dao De Jing* and *Diamond Sutra*, expounded the *Great Essentials of the Golden Elixir*, then combined Daoist worldly methods to annotate this scripture. I also cited the good teachings of former sages to verify it. May those who regulate misfortune and blessing know to diligently recite and turn to goodness; may those who transcend creation know to cultivate and ascend to truth.

Alas! All people know to love life and hate death; knowing to hate death, they must think how to escape it. Yet now it is not so. Knowing to hate death, they bury themselves in the fields of fame, profit, craving, and desire, without knowing repentance — this hastens their death. Knowing to love life, they must think how to seek the way of longevity and lasting vision. Yet now it is not so. Knowing to love life, they do not seek a true master to instruct the principle of returning to life and longevity, but blindly wander side doors and walk evil paths — this hastens their life.

In the mountains and forests, in cities and towns, wise people know to recite this scripture and should seek within it the shortcut to the Golden Elixir and eternal vision. The Supreme One uses the Dao of Numinous Treasure to deliver people, truly wishing the world to walk this Dao. If one can advance cultivation and diligent practice, then one will ascend to the colorless realm of Supreme Clarity above, and surely practice the Brahman conduct.

In the mid-autumn of the Yuan Bingzi year, at the northern Purple Cloud Scarlet Palace of Jinluo Mountain, the Supreme Yang Son Chen Guanwu composed this preface.

#### Commentary on the Supreme Cavernous Profound Numinous Treasure Primordial Infinite Deliverance Scripture of the Highest Grade — Upper Scroll

Supreme Yang Son Chen Guanwu’s Commentary

The Supreme Yang Son says: “Supreme” means the Dao is greatest; “Highest” means Heaven and Earth alone are honored. “Cavernous” means nothing is not penetrated; “Profound” means its mystery is hard to describe. “Numinous” means transformations are unfathomable, responding and thus communicating. “Treasure” means rare and precious things, cherished by people. “Infinite” cannot be guessed or measured; “Deliverance of people” means from the mundane into the sage. “Highest grade” is unmatched under Heaven; “Wondrous” contains numinous and nurtures the essence. “Scripture” is the raft and ladder of Heaven.

Summing up, it means: most honored and exalted, permeating numinous transformations, the true path of primordial unity to form the elixir. This is spoken to the great-rooted superior person; it is called the Dao’s use. The scripture has Dao use and worldly method. Dao use is to rely on it for cultivation and ascend to immortality; worldly method is to diligently recite and seek blessings.

If explained by worldly method, “Supreme” is a lofty and exalted title. “Cavernous Profound” is the three cave ranks: Cave Truth, Cavernous Profound, Cave Spirit — meaning the Primordial Dao reaching true profound unity. “Numinous Treasure” is the title of Jade Morning Dao Lord, who received the primordial unity qi and transformed, honored as Numinous Treasure. “Infinite Deliverance of People” means since the great kalpa, the Primordial has transformed the heavens and generated all beings; people are delivered by it beyond calculation. “Highest grade” means among the thirty-six divisions, eighteen thousand scrolls of the Daoist canon, and four hundred thousand alleys, this scripture is foremost. “Wondrous” means ineffable; “Scripture” is the correct path of the Dao.

This is the worldly method explanation. For great cultivators, Dao use and worldly method go hand in hand: with Dao use hiding worldly method, and worldly method perfecting Dao use — this is cultivation of both nature and life. The world says Buddhism cultivates nature, Daoism cultivates life; though wise and intelligent, they hold this view. Who knows this scripture blends nature and life, form and spirit both wondrous! Supreme Yang Son can only reveal the heavenly secret, presenting the nature-life essence and function of this scripture.

“Supreme” is the essence’s body and life’s response, the creator and master of life’s body; nature’s function can transform and birth the heavens. “Cavernous” is where true nature is shared; “Profound” is the hidden subtle function. “Numinous” is the transformation of nature; “Treasure” is what life produces. “Infinite” is not casually known. “Deliverance of people” requires people to deliver people. “Highest grade” means there is no other Dao under Heaven, and similar types easily apply the功 (merit). “Wondrous” is when the first Yang moves, and all things are spring. “Scripture” is something with substance, thus a path of cultivation.

Exposing this plainly, is it not direct?

The *Record of the Mixed Origin* says: Laozi, during the Dragon Han kalpa, split his body to teach, issuing true texts in the Central Heaven Great Blessing Hall Country, Southern Pole Red Bright Country, Eastern Pole Floating Dawn Country, Western Pole Sina Country, Northern Pole Yudan Country — within these five countries, all receive the teaching of the Numinous Treasure. The Westernized Hu king asked: What is the Dao? Laozi said: It is the Supreme Numinous Treasure, born before Heaven and Earth, embracing all great and small, encompassing all subtle. Heaven obtains it as clarity; Earth obtains it as peace; spirits obtain it as numinous; things obtain it as life; people obtain it as form. If one cultivates it, one attains spirit immortality, flying swiftly to the Jade Capital; hence it is called Supreme.

The *Cavernous Profound Numinous Treasure Infinite Deliverance Scripture* says:

Supreme dwells before the Supreme Ultimate, originally before father and mother were born. Deliverance requires the true scripture to deliver; if you ask what the true scripture is, it is lead.

The Dao says: Long ago, in the primordial blue Heaven, in the azure empty song of the great Floating Dawn land, received the *Primordial Infinite Deliverance Highest Grade*. The Primordial Heavenly Venerable spoke this scripture, recited it ten times around, summoning the Ten Directions. At first, the seat was approached. The Heavenly True Great Gods, the Supreme Saints, the Wondrous Practice Perfected, the countless Unrestrained, rode the void, flying clouds and cinnabar skies, green chariots and jade wheels, feathered canopies shading, flowing essence and jade light, five colors flourishing, illuminating the vast space for seven days and nights.

The sun, moon, stars, constellations, celestial pivot and jade balance, stopped the wheels for a moment. The divine wind was silent, mountains and seas hid clouds, Heaven had no floating shadows, the four qi were bright and clear. One country’s land, mountains, rivers, forests, all equal, no high or low. The earth was all like jade, without difference in color; all the perfected attended the seat.

Supreme Yang Son says: From the worldly method perspective, this is the narration of the scripture’s origin; from the Dao use perspective, it is all about the primordial unity great elixir’s wondrous Dao. The *Laozi* says: There is a thing mixed and formed, born before Heaven and Earth; I do not know its name, so I call it Dao. The Dao originally has no words, words are used to reveal the Dao’s function. Hence it says: The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao.

Explained by worldly method, the Dao Lord expounds the scripture’s meaning, simply called Dao words. Explained by Dao use, the Dao itself formed the Supreme Ultimate before the great chaos; the Supreme Ultimate divides yin and yang in the secret darkness; yin and yang form shape, becoming nature and life; nature and life at the moment of transcendence become the sun’s spirit qi. Spirit qi, due to the breaking of chaos, is called lead and mercury. Lead and mercury pass through the Wu and Ji gates, called the mysterious feminine gate. Hence the mysterious feminine gate is the root of Heaven and Earth; this is called Dao. Following Dao and using it is called speech.

Therefore, the scripture begins directly: The Dao says. Long ago, in the primordial blue Heaven. “Long ago” is before the Supreme Ultimate; “primordial blue Heaven” is the beginning of all things. “Azure empty song” is the start of creation; “great Floating Dawn land” is where things are born. Receiving the *Primordial Infinite Deliverance Highest Grade*, practicing this profound unity great elixir.

This is Dao use explanation. If worldly method meaning, “long ago” is the beginning of the primordial blue Heaven, the first heaven of the East, in the seed people’s Heaven. Above is the azure mist filling the sky, called the azure Heaven. Qi stirs as divine wind sounds like an empty song; below is a country called Great Floating Dawn. The *Inner Meaning* says: Great Floating Dawn land shows the beginning of creation; things are born from earth and return to earth. The *Yin Conjuration Scripture* says: Fire is born from wood; calamity arises and must be overcome. Knowing cultivation is called sage. Wood contains fire; if fire is unleashed without control, it burns to ashes and loses its nature. Those who can control it, though fire burns wood to ashes, can gather ashes to form earth, thus nature is preserved.

Primordial blue Heaven is the wood direction. Azure empty song is the fire image. Great Floating Dawn land is the root of earth. Earth is the basis of the returning elixir. The returning elixir is the Dao of returning to origin and returning to the primordial. The scripture says: “Reach the utmost emptiness, keep still and firm; all things arise together, I observe their return.” All things flourish, each returns to its root; returning to the root is stillness, stillness is returning life. This is the principle of return.

In the *Book of Changes*, the Return hexagram says: Return to see the heart of Heaven and Earth. Heaven and Earth are the body of yin and yang; heart means clarifying its function. Heaven moves, Earth is still; yang moves, yin is still. Heaven moves to the extreme and yin is born; Earth is still to the extreme and yang is born. Peeling above and returning below, movement and stillness, disappearance and growth, thus one sees the heart. Humans are likewise.

The Return hexagram has one Yang under five Yin; its body is Zhen below and Kun above. Zhen, wood, is the primordial blue Heaven; wood produces fire, the azure empty song. Fire produces earth; Kun earth is Great Floating Dawn land. Earth is the root of creation; earth produces metal, called the empty qi metal embryo, truly the primordial ancestor qi. The Primordial Heavenly Venerable: “Primordial means profound; beginning one.” Heaven is the highest qi, the supreme name of all existence. Dao use is the ancestral qi of the dharma body, also called the original face, the indestructible primordial spirit.

Hence the *Elixir Scripture* says: Primordial Heavenly Venerable is myself, speak this scripture. At the appointed time, speak it; Dao use is scripture, truly lead. Laozi said to Master Wen: “If you can know the one, all affairs are complete.” He also said: “One is lead, lead is lord; two is mercury, mercury is minister. If lead is not true, mercury is hard to approach; if lead is close, it does not lose its minister.” Recited ten times around, summoning the Ten Directions.

Worldly method: the Heavenly Venerable speaks the scripture, summoning true spirits. “Around” means announcing everywhere; “around” means universally summoning. Summoning means managing the Ten Directions. Approaching the seat means the golden elixir arriving at the chamber. Great cultivators enter the chamber to work, pursuing the two qi on the Yellow Path, uniting the three natures at the primordial official, circulating seventy-two crucial nodes, gathering three thousand six hundred correct qi — is this not the Heavenly True Supreme Saint, countless Unrestrained, gathering into the elixir cauldron, converging the golden embryo? Is it not riding the void, uniting spirit and qi, refining qi? Is the form not flying clouds and cinnabar skies, feathered canopies shading, golden radiance shining, silver essence emitting brilliance? Is it not flowing essence and jade light, five colors flourishing, illuminating the vast space?

From the worldly method, the Heavenly Venerable’s divine power and response are beyond this! Seven days and nights — Heaven and Earth’s great transformation; ten months pure yin without yang; at the eleventh month belongs to Zi (Rat). Though Zi has yang, it has not yet returned; after seven days, yang begins to revive. This is the yin and yang of Heaven and Earth.

The moon is full at the fifteenth day; at the twenty-seventh night, the moon is black without yang. At the beginning of the next month, at the third day and Shen hour, the moon’s one yang revives at Geng. This is the yin and yang of the moon. All return in sevens. Heaven One produces water; Earth Six completes it — this is the seven number of the Five Phases.

The golden elixir Dao gathers numbers; at one time there are six phases, each phase governs five days. When gathering herbs, only one and a half phases are used — also seven days and seven nights. The *Book of Changes* says: “Hard and soft are the image of night.” The ancient sages say: “Hard and soft are the coming and going of one qi.” Human breathing is the coming and going of one qi. One inhale and one exhale is one breath; between one breath, yin and yang divide. Exhale is bright, yang; inhale is dim, yin. The seven orifices’ exhalation is seven days; inhalation is seven nights. The golden mother’s work proceeds; the heavenly mechanism does not move; spirit is doubtful, eyes steady, pulse stops, heart halts — hence seven days and seven nights.

The sun, moon, stars, constellations, celestial pivot and jade balance stop the wheels for a moment; breath neither enters nor leaves; the divine phoenix is silent; qi neither rises nor falls; mountains and seas hide clouds. All false conditions are purified; as Heaven has no floating shadows, the six roots are greatly settled, called the four qi bright and clear.

Dao use reaches this, then one sees the wondrous blending of nature and life. One country’s land is the worldly method’s Floating Dawn land; Dao use is the one body. People regard the body as country, essence as the people, qi as the lord, spirit as the commander. Mountains, rivers, forests, and trees are all within the body. True stillness is deep and clear, all equal, no high or low. Nature is as pure and bright as jade; what difference in color is there?

The *Inner Meaning* says: Earth is nature and feeling. Nature is empty and transforms to birth spirit, residing in the chamber called Wu Earth. Qi is stimulated and has feeling, gathered in the cauldron, called Ji Earth. After Wu and Ji interact, spirit is joyful and qi silent; nature returns to feeling and obscurity, like the green qi spots of color, like jade’s true unmixed purity — hence it is said all earth is like jade, without difference in color.

The heart and eyes observe true qi; three souls return to the body, seven spirits return to truth; the heart lord is at peace, myriad spirits obey commands — hence all perfected attend the seat. This is all Dao use’s action.

Explained by worldly method, the Heavenly Venerable’s power influences heavenly gods, earthly spirits, sun, moon, stars, responding to conditions — such is the scene.

The verse says:

Azure empty song, most wondrous sound,  
Great Floating Dawn land seeks Kun (Earth).  
Flowing essence, illuminating spirit wind silent,  
Deep stillness, subtle yang refines five yin.

The Primordial Heavenly Venerable, on the mysterious throne floating above the five-colored lion, spoke the scripture once; all the great saints of the heavens simultaneously praised it. At that time, one country’s men and women deaf and sick had their ears opened and hearing restored. Recited twice, the blind regained sight. Thrice, the mute could speak. Four times, the lame and sick could all rise and walk. Five times, long-term illnesses and chronic diseases instantly restored form. Six times, white hair returned black, lost teeth regrew. Seven times, the old became young, the young all strong. Eight times, women conceived, birds and beasts bore young; born and unborn all obtained generation. Nine times, Earth Store’s release, golden jade dew form. Ten times, withered bones revived, all rose as humans. At that time, one country, male or female, none did not incline heart, all received protection and deliverance, all obtained longevity.

Supreme Yang Son says: From Dao use perspective, the Primordial Heavenly Venerable is the primordial spirit. Purple Clear White Perfected says: This spirit is not the thinking spirit; it can be compared shoulder to shoulder with the Primordial. The *Inner Meaning* says: The mysterious throne is the spirit chamber; floating in emptiness is the dharma body. The five colors are the wondrous transforming qi; the lion is the mind’s knowing. The primordial spirit is in the chamber, operating heart and gathering qi; the dharma body is empty and silent, the mind knowing and wondrous. The spirit’s governing qi uses the mind as its master; is this not the Dao image of the Heavenly Venerable? Is it not our true nature? Thus the mysterious throne floating in emptiness is deep stillness and true quiet, always responding and always still.

The hardest to subdue in humans is the heart and nature. The scripture says: The human spirit likes clarity but the heart disturbs it; the heart likes stillness but desire pulls it. Spirit is true nature; when the heart is still, spirit is naturally clear. Entering the chamber work is to subdue the heart like taming a fierce beast. Ancient sages compared lead and mercury to tiger and dragon, meaning their difficulty to control. Pure Yang says: Warm lead cauldron, light shines through the curtain. Creation races, tiger and dragon mate; advancing fire work is like an ox and a fight; how much more so the lion king of beasts, floating and sitting above it? Slight negligence is very dangerous.

The Azure Origin Perfected says: One must first subdue and sit upon it, emptying the heart and extending the form; only then can the Dao respond — this is the root of transcendence. Speaking the scripture once, all the great saints of Heaven simultaneously praise it. Cultivators of the profound unity true numinous treasure great returning elixir are respected by myriad saints, revered by the heavens, protected by demon kings, admired by ghosts and spirits. How much more so when one attains the scripture seat? Is this not praise?

From Dao use perspective, reciting once clears the spirit within the body. One country’s men and women deaf have ears opened; twice, the blind gain sight; thrice, the mute speak. This seems shallow from worldly method, but from Dao use, the principle is most precise. Why? Because ordinary people cannot quietly listen and nourish qi, gather vision and preserve spirit; thus ears are confused by sound, eyes disturbed by color, mouth enslaved by taste, long without awakening, ending blind, deaf, mute, and dumb.

The *Laozi* says: Five tones make the ear deaf; five colors make the eye blind. Great cultivators listen to silence, growing ever keener; see the formless, growing ever clearer; mouth does not mix tastes, growing ever fresh. How much more so at the chamber’s moment! How can the five senses not be cautious and guarded?

Wei Perfected says: The three treasures of ear, eye, and mouth must be closed and not opened; the perfected person secretly dwells in the abyss, floating and guarding the rule. Four times, the lame and sick can all rise and walk. Compared to worldly people who do not know cultivation, like the lame who cannot walk; illness means entanglement, accumulation, and reaching. Because the lower foolish are entangled in worldly defilement and accumulated habits, thus it is so. Now, those who can rise and walk can rise in will and cultivate.

Five times, long-term illnesses and chronic diseases instantly restore form. Some who believe in the Dao have hearts not firm; those who do not believe have hearts hard as metal and stone; a hundred plans cannot turn their hearts to believe. This is long-term illness and chronic disease. Suddenly one day, believing in the Dao and practicing without doubt, this is called instant restoration of form.

Some say Kan is the ear and opens hearing; Li is the eye and opens sight. Others say Zhen Jing opens hearing; Li Li opens sight. Why not transcend? The scripture’s circulation truly contains the Dao. Without true practice and realization, how can one speak of this?

Six times, white hair returns black, teeth fall and regrow. Blood abundance makes hair flourish; essence abundance makes teeth strong. Seven times, the old become young, the young all strong. When the primordial unity qi returns, the old become infants and then strong; when the true qi is complete, the young all strong. The *Laozi* says: Like a newborn, bones weak and muscles soft but grip firm, not knowing the union of yin and yang, male and female. Is this not the meaning of all young being strong?

Eight times, women conceive, birds and beasts bear young; born and unborn all obtain generation. Nine times, Earth Store’s release, golden jade dew form. Ten times, withered bones revive, all rise as humans. This is Dao use and worldly method both present.

Worldly method follows the scripture’s words, not repeated here. Dao use is for cultivators of golden liquid returning elixir; without primordial unity qi, the whole body is yin. If separated from the middle void, is it not called woman? Purple Yang Perfected says: The sun resides at Li position, turning into female Kan, paired with the moon official; yet it is male. Having obtained the golden liquid woman’s cauldron, above and below guarded by Vermilion Bird and Black Tortoise, left and right guarded by White Tiger and Azure Dragon, is this not birds and beasts bearing young? All obtain generation; the golden cauldron’s embryo is complete and qi sufficient.

Earth Store’s release and golden jade dew form mean form and spirit both wondrous. Withered bones revive and all rise as humans; perfected persons appear, body outside body, hundreds of billions of transformations. The *Inner Meaning* says: Birds and beasts bearing young means sand containing mercury essence, forms bearing embryo. Mercury meets lead and condenses; qi meets form and mixes; the condensed qi grows daily; the generated qi again condenses, not dispersing with things, nurturing the sacred embryo; hence born and unborn all obtain generation.

Nine times, Earth produces metal, Heaven completes it ninefold. Returning to the west, the Dui direction is metal; Kun and Dui combine and metal forms in earth. Lead returns to the earth cauldron and becomes treasure. The *Cantong Qi* says: Metal returns to nature first, then is called returning elixir; this is the one qi returning to origin.

The Primordial Heavenly Venerable. Yuan means profound; beginning one. Heaven is the highest qi, the supreme name of all existence. Dao use is the ancestral qi of the dharma body, also called the original face, the indestructible primordial spirit.

Hence the *Elixir Scripture* says: Primordial Heavenly Venerable is myself, speak this scripture. At the appointed time, speak it; Dao use is scripture, truly lead. Laozi said to Master Wen: “If you can know the one, all affairs are complete.” He also said: “One is lead, lead is lord; two is mercury, mercury is minister. If lead is not true, mercury is hard to approach; if lead is close, it does not lose its minister.” Recited ten times around, summoning the Ten Directions.

Worldly method: the Heavenly Venerable speaks the scripture, summoning true spirits. “Around” means announcing everywhere; “around” means universally summoning. Summoning means managing the Ten Directions. Approaching the seat means the golden elixir arriving at the chamber. Great cultivators enter the chamber to work, pursuing the two qi on the Yellow Path, uniting the three natures at the primordial official, circulating seventy-two crucial nodes, gathering three thousand six hundred correct qi — is this not the Heavenly True Supreme Saint, countless Unrestrained, gathering into the elixir cauldron, converging the golden embryo? Is it not riding the void, uniting spirit and qi, refining qi? Is the form not flying clouds and cinnabar skies, feathered canopies shading, golden radiance shining, silver essence emitting brilliance? Is it not flowing essence and jade light, five colors flourishing, illuminating the vast space?

From the worldly method, the Heavenly Venerable’s divine power and response are beyond this! Seven days and nights — Heaven and Earth’s great transformation; ten months pure yin without yang; at the eleventh month belongs to Zi (Rat). Though Zi has yang, it has not yet returned; after seven days, yang begins to revive. This is the yin and yang of Heaven and Earth.

The moon is full at the fifteenth day; at the twenty-seventh night, the moon is black without yang. At the beginning of the next month, at the third day and Shen hour, the moon’s one yang revives at Geng. This is the yin and yang of the moon. All return in sevens.

Qi is stimulated and has feeling, gathered in the cauldron, called Ji Earth.

The heart and eyes observe true qi; three souls return to the body, seven spirits return to truth; the heart lord is at peace, myriad spirits obey commands — hence all perfected attend the seat. This is all Dao use’s action.

Explained by worldly method, the Heavenly Venerable’s power influences heavenly gods, earthly spirits, sun, moon, stars, responding to conditions — such is the scene.

At that time, one country’s men and women deaf and sick had their ears opened and hearing restored. Recited twice, the blind regained sight. Thrice, the mute could speak. Four times, the lame and sick could all rise and walk. Five times, long-term illnesses and chronic diseases instantly restored form. Six times, white hair returned black, lost teeth regrew. Seven times, the old became young, the young all strong. Eight times, women conceived, birds and beasts bore young; born and unborn all obtained generation. Nine times, Earth Store’s release, golden jade dew form. Ten times, withered bones revived, all rose as humans. At that time, one country, male or female, none did not incline heart, all received protection and deliverance, all obtained longevity.

Supreme Yang Son says: From Dao use perspective, the Primordial Heavenly Venerable is the primordial spirit. Purple Clear White Perfected says: This spirit is not the thinking spirit; it can be compared shoulder to shoulder with the Primordial. The *Inner Meaning* says: The mysterious throne is the spirit chamber; floating in emptiness is the dharma body. The five colors are the wondrous transforming qi; the lion is the mind’s knowing. The primordial spirit is in the chamber, operating heart and gathering qi; the dharma body is empty and silent, the mind knowing and wondrous. The spirit’s governing qi uses the mind as its master; is this not the Dao image of the Heavenly Venerable? Is it not our true nature? Thus the mysterious throne floating in emptiness is deep stillness and true quiet, always responding and always still.

The hardest to subdue in humans is the heart and nature. The scripture says: The human spirit likes clarity but the heart disturbs it; the heart likes stillness but desire pulls it. Spirit is true nature; when the heart is still, spirit is naturally clear. Entering the chamber work is to subdue the heart like taming a fierce beast. Ancient sages compared lead and mercury to tiger and dragon, meaning their difficulty to control. Pure Yang says: Warm lead cauldron, light shines through the curtain. Creation races, tiger and dragon mate; advancing fire work is like an ox and a fight; how much more so the lion king of beasts, floating and sitting above it? Slight negligence is very dangerous.

The Azure Origin Perfected says: One must first subdue and sit upon it, emptying the heart and extending the form; only then can the Dao respond — this is the root of transcendence. Speaking the scripture once, all the great saints of Heaven simultaneously praise it. Cultivators of the profound unity true numinous treasure great returning elixir are respected by myriad saints, revered by the heavens, protected by demon kings, admired by ghosts and spirits. How much more so when one attains the scripture seat? Is this not praise?

From Dao use perspective, reciting once clears the spirit within the body. One country’s men and women deaf have ears opened; twice, the blind gain sight; thrice, the mute speak. This seems shallow from worldly method, but from Dao use, the principle is most precise. Why? Because ordinary people cannot quietly listen and nourish qi, gather vision and preserve spirit; thus ears are confused by sound, eyes disturbed by color, mouth enslaved by taste, long without awakening, ending blind, deaf, mute, and dumb.

The *Laozi* says: Five tones make the ear deaf; five colors make the eye blind. Great cultivators listen to silence, growing ever keener; see the formless, growing ever clearer; mouth does not mix tastes, growing ever fresh. How much more so at the chamber’s moment! How can the five senses not be cautious and guarded?

Wei Perfected says: The three treasures of ear, eye, and mouth must be closed and not opened; the perfected person secretly dwells in the abyss, floating and guarding the rule. Four times, the lame and sick can all rise and walk. Compared to worldly people who do not know cultivation, like the lame who cannot walk; illness means entanglement, accumulation, and reaching. Because the lower foolish are entangled in worldly defilement and accumulated habits, thus it is so. Now, those who can rise and walk can rise in will and cultivate.

Five times, long-term illnesses and chronic diseases instantly restore form. Some who believe in the Dao have hearts not firm; those who do not believe have hearts hard as metal and stone; a hundred plans cannot turn their hearts to believe. This is long-term illness and chronic disease. Suddenly one day, believing in the Dao and practicing without doubt, this is called instant restoration of form.

Some say Kan is the ear and opens hearing; Li is the eye and opens sight. Others say Zhen Jing opens hearing; Li Li opens sight. Why not transcend? The scripture’s circulation truly contains the Dao. Without true practice and realization, how can one speak of this?

Six times, white hair returns black, teeth fall and regrow. Blood abundance makes hair flourish; essence abundance makes teeth strong. Seven times, the old become young, the young all strong. When the primordial unity qi returns, the old become infants and then strong; when the true qi is complete, the young all strong. The *Laozi* says: Like a newborn, bones weak and muscles soft but grip firm, not knowing the union of yin and yang, male and female. Is this not the meaning of all young being strong?

Eight times, women conceive, birds and beasts bear young; born and unborn all obtain generation. Nine times, Earth Store’s release, golden jade dew form. Ten times, withered bones revive, all rise as humans. This is Dao use and worldly method both present.

Worldly method follows the scripture’s words, not repeated here. Dao use is for cultivators of golden liquid returning elixir; without primordial unity qi, the whole body is yin. If separated from the middle void, is it not called woman? Purple Yang Perfected says: The sun resides at Li position, turning into female Kan, paired with the moon official; yet it is male. Having obtained the golden liquid woman’s cauldron, above and below guarded by Vermilion Bird and Black Tortoise, left and right guarded by White Tiger and Azure Dragon, is this not birds and beasts bearing young? All obtain generation; the golden cauldron’s embryo is complete and qi sufficient.

Earth Store’s release and golden jade dew form mean form and spirit both wondrous. Withered bones revive and all rise as humans; perfected persons appear, body outside body, hundreds of billions of transformations. The *Inner Meaning* says: Birds and beasts bearing young means sand containing mercury essence, forms bearing embryo. Mercury meets lead and condenses; qi meets form and mixes; the condensed qi grows daily; the generated qi again condenses, not dispersing with things, nurturing the sacred embryo; hence born and unborn all obtain generation.

Nine times, Earth produces metal, Heaven completes it ninefold. Returning to the west, the Dui direction is metal; Kun and Dui combine and metal forms in earth. Lead returns to the earth cauldron and becomes treasure. The *Cantong Qi* says: Metal returns to nature first, then is called returning elixir; this is the one qi returning to origin.

The Primordial Heavenly Venerable. Yuan means profound; beginning one. Heaven is the highest qi, the supreme name of all existence. Dao use is the ancestral qi of the dharma body, also called the original face, the indestructible primordial spirit.

Hence the *Elixir Scripture* says: Primordial Heavenly Venerable is myself, speak this scripture. At the appointed time, speak it; Dao use is scripture, truly lead. Laozi said to Master Wen: “If you can know the one, all affairs are complete.” He also said: “One is lead, lead is lord; two is mercury, mercury is minister. If lead is not true, mercury is hard to approach; if lead is close, it does not lose its minister.” Recited ten times around, summoning the Ten Directions.

Worldly method: the Heavenly Venerable speaks the scripture, summoning true spirits. “Around” means announcing everywhere; “around” means universally summoning. Summoning means managing the Ten Directions. Approaching the seat means the golden elixir arriving at the chamber. Great cultivators enter the chamber to work, pursuing the two qi on the Yellow Path, uniting the three natures at the primordial official, circulating seventy-two crucial nodes, gathering three thousand six hundred correct qi — is this not the Heavenly True Supreme Saint, countless Unrestrained, gathering into the elixir cauldron, converging the golden embryo? Is it not riding the void, uniting spirit and qi, refining qi? Is the form not flying clouds and cinnabar skies, feathered canopies shading, golden radiance shining, silver essence emitting brilliance? Is it not flowing essence and jade light, five colors flourishing, illuminating the vast space?

From the worldly method, the Heavenly Venerable’s divine power and response are beyond this! Seven days and nights — Heaven and Earth’s great transformation; ten months pure yin without yang; at the eleventh month belongs to Zi (Rat). Though Zi has yang, it has not yet returned; after seven days, yang begins to revive. This is the yin and yang of Heaven and Earth.

The moon is full at the fifteenth day; at the twenty-seventh night, the moon is black without yang. At the beginning of the next month, at the third day and Shen hour, the moon’s one yang revives at Geng. This is the yin and yang of the moon. All return in sevens. Heaven One produces water; Earth Six completes it — this is the seven number of the Five Phases.

The golden elixir Dao gathers numbers; at one time there are six phases, each phase governs five days. When gathering herbs, only one and a half phases are used — also seven days and seven nights. The *Book of Changes* says: “Hard and soft are the image of night.” The ancient sages say: “Hard and soft are the coming and going of one qi.” Human breathing is the coming and going of one qi. One inhale and one exhale is one breath; between one breath, yin and yang divide. Exhale is bright, yang; inhale is dim, yin. The seven orifices’ exhalation is seven days; inhalation is seven nights. The golden mother’s work proceeds; the heavenly mechanism does not move; spirit is doubtful, eyes steady, pulse stops, heart halts — hence seven days and seven nights.

The sun, moon, stars, constellations, celestial pivot and jade balance stop the wheels for a moment; breath neither enters nor leaves; the divine phoenix is silent; qi neither rises nor falls; mountains and seas hide clouds. All false conditions are purified; as Heaven has no floating shadows, the six roots are greatly settled, called the four qi bright and clear.

Dao use reaches this, then one sees the wondrous blending of nature and life. One country’s land is the worldly method’s Floating Dawn land; Dao use is the one body. People regard the body as country, essence as the people, qi as the lord, spirit as the commander. Mountains, rivers, forests, and trees are all within the body. True stillness is deep and clear, all equal, no high or low. Nature is as pure and bright as jade; what difference in color is there?

The *Inner Meaning* says: Earth is nature and feeling. Nature is empty and transforms to birth spirit, residing in the chamber called Wu Earth. Qi is stimulated and has feeling, gathered in the cauldron, called Ji Earth. After Wu and Ji interact, spirit is joyful and qi silent; nature returns to feeling and obscurity, like the green qi spots of color, like jade’s true unmixed purity — hence it is said all earth is like jade, without difference in color.

The heart and eyes observe true qi; three souls return to the body, seven spirits return to truth; the heart lord is at peace, myriad spirits obey commands — hence all perfected attend the seat. This is all Dao use’s action.

Explained by worldly method, the Heavenly Venerable’s power influences heavenly gods, earthly spirits, sun, moon, stars, responding to conditions — such is the scene.

The verse says:

Azure empty song, most wondrous sound,  
Great Floating Dawn land seeks Kun (Earth).  
Flowing essence, illuminating spirit wind silent,  
Deep stillness, subtle yang refines five yin.
