## Preface to the Scripture

Your humble servant, Xue Jizhao of the Minor Omen, with utmost reverence and trembling heart, bows deeply and twice prostrates, respectfully presenting these words.

I have heard that the millet-sized pearl of creation, by the Primordial Origin, unfolds the profound mystery; the Scripture of the Numinous Treasure, thanks to the Dao Lord’s unfolding and transformation. Heaven does not cherish the Dao, yet the world is granted to behold this Scripture, truly a chaotic red script, named the Supreme Wondrous Beginning. The primal thread unfolds into thirty-two emperors; the divine text marshals twenty-four attendants. Above, it dispels heavenly calamities; below, it wards off poisons and harms. Therefore, those who lightly leak or disdain it shall suffer hell’s torments; those who offer reverence and honor shall ascend to the ranks of immortals and lords.

Yet though many recite this Scripture, few truly comprehend its essence. The sages before us did not lack annotations, but many delve into the profound and mysterious; the humble learner finds it difficult to harmonize, deepening doubts. The mind is dim, the sounds clear yet hollow.

I, Jizhao, an ordinary man, eager to explore the mysterious gateways, receiving the master’s secret seal, leading the manifest Thunder Altar, ashamed to have no inch of merit to dispel the three evils, have aided in explaining the phrases of the Six Classics, consulted the profound talks of the ancients, gathered into one school, and broadly opened many eyes. I dare not present this to the supreme Dao, only to guide those of lesser roots. Following the text, I clarify meanings, dissect chapter by chapter, only wishing to illuminate the sage words by sun and moon. How can I avoid sin and blame among hills and graves? I pray for the Emperor’s grace and forgive my presumption.

With utmost reverence and trembling, I bow deeply and twice prostrate.

Respectfully mindful of the Supreme Great Luo’s Three Realms, the Golden Pavilion, Jade Emperor, Great August Sovereign, Jade Majesty, who opens the Three Sceneries and transforms and births the myriad heavens. The mysterious throne speaks the Scripture, all acclaim its goodness. Life and death rely upon it, blessings hard to surpass. The profound can be detailed, salvation boundless.

I humbly hope the Emperor pities my unclean breath, considers my earnest study of the Scripture, penetrating the profound and subtle, roughly grasping its chapters; burning incense and reciting the Scripture, wishing to fulfill this aspiration. Looking up to the Emperor’s protection, I obtain good cause, completing a heart long unfinished, opening eyes long closed since former lives. Benefiting all under the Six Heavens, whether male or female, all attain longevity. Perhaps within a single day, neither wise nor foolish, all may enter the Dao. Both sides free from false thoughts, ancestors only wish for ascension.

I again beseech protection and long transmission.

In former times, the heavens recorded human merits and faults, not missing a hair’s breadth; now a whole nation wholeheartedly turns in reverence, rejoicing beyond words. Your servant’s feelings cannot be contained as I gaze to Heaven and venerate the sage; risking death, I bow and pray for forgiveness with utmost sincerity.

Respectfully submitted.

In the seventh year of the Great Virtue era, on the day of the Jiachen cycle of the First Full Moon, your humble servant Xue Jizhao submits this memorial.

By Xue Jizhao, Manifest Elder of the Ice Lake Wilderness of Nine Rivers

### The Supreme Cavernous Numinous Treasure Scripture of Boundless Salvation of Beings

The Most High refers to the Jade Morning Supreme Great Dao Lord. Disciple of the Primordial Heavenly Venerable, teacher of the Supreme Emperor of the Great Subtle Heaven, residing in the Upper Clear, Upper Origin Jade Palace. Having been granted the Scripture, he thus properly titles it with the character *Cavern*—the Three Caverns being Cavern Truth, Cavern Mystery, and Cavern Spirit. Mystery means wondrous; when scattered, it becomes Scripture; when gathered, it becomes Dao. The Numinous Treasure is one chapter of the Three Treasures.

According to the *Scripture of the Birth of Spirits*: The Dragon Han opens the chart, transforming and giving birth to the Numinous Treasure Lord; in the first year of the Red Brightness era, the Scripture was issued to save beings, then called Upper Clear. The Mysterious Capital Jade Capital, the Seven Treasures Purple Tenuity Palace, is the heaven where the Dao Lord dwells.

This *Scripture of Salvation* is the collection of the Most High Dao Lord, the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Venerable; hence it is called Numinous Treasure. Boundless means immeasurable, indicating its vastness. Salvation of beings means opening the salvation of all sentient beings. Supreme grade means the highest and finest salvation. Wondrous Scripture means wondrous, that is, mysterious; Scripture means path. This Scripture is the wondrous and swift path to salvation.

### The Dao Speaks: In the ancient beginning, within the Primordial Azure Heaven,

This Scripture was granted by the Primordial Origin to the Dao Lord. Whenever the phrase “the Dao speaks” appears, it is the Dao Lord narrating. The Dao Lord says: In the distant past, during countless kalpas, in the Primordial Azure Heaven, this heaven is one among the Northern Eight Heavens, called the Blue Vault Floating Li Sky Song Treasure Heaven.

The *Daozang* says: The Desire Realm’s six heavens, from the first Supreme Emperor Heaven in the East to the sixth Upper Bright Heaven, belong to the Desire Realm; these heavens face the kalpa of great fire burning and boiling. The Form Realm’s eighteen heavens, from the seventh Void Heaven in the East to the eighth Limitless Heaven in the West, belong to the Form Realm; these heavens face the kalpa of great water flooding and drifting. The Formless Realm’s four heavens, from the first Bright Court Heaven in the North to the fourth Supreme Element Heaven, belong to the Formless Realm; these heavens face the kalpa of great wind dispersing. Moreover, from the fifth to the eighth heavens in the North are the Four Kinds of People Heavens. Though collectively called Formless Realm, this kalpa is long-lasting, and water, fire, wind cannot reach it. When the Three Realms are destroyed by kalpa, this heaven’s sages again open the human seed. The Primordial Azure Heaven is one of the Four Kinds of People Heavens. It presides over the kalpa’s transformations and births.

### The Blue Vault Floating Li Great Land,

Within the Primordial Azure Heaven, the azure pure Brahma qi spreads boundlessly; among them, the heavenly beings sing hollow songs, echoing and responding to each other. Floating Li is the hidden name of the Primordial Azure Heaven’s king.

### Receiving the Primordial Origin’s Boundless Supreme Salvation.

The Dao Lord says: I, in the Primordial Azure Heaven, received this supreme highest Scripture. This is the Dao Lord’s preface to the Heavenly Venerable’s Scripture.

The Primordial Heavenly Venerable was to speak this Scripture, circling ten times to summon the Ten Directions, then took his seat.

The Dao Lord says: The Heavenly Venerable first spoke the Scripture, circling ten times, universally summoning the Ten Directions, then sat down. “Circling” means traversing everywhere. The Ten Directions are East, South, West, North, Northeast, Southeast, Southwest, Northwest, Up, and Down. Beginning at one and ending at ten, ten traversals complete the full circuit.

The Heavenly True Great God, Supreme Sage High Lord, Wondrous Practice Perfected Person, countless in number, come riding the void.

This refers to those who have attained the Dao, perfected and true, all coming to hear the Heavenly Venerable’s teaching. “Countless” means innumerable. Riding the void means harnessing qi to ride the empty space to the place of teaching.

Flying clouds and cinnabar skies, green chariots and jade wheels, feathered canopies casting shade.

This describes the splendid attire of those who come to hear the Dharma at that moment.

Flowing essence and jade light, five colors flourishing, illuminating the vast emptiness, seven days and seven nights.

This describes the immortals refined into truth, nourishing their five organs within, their radiance manifesting five colors outside, shining brightly in the void, lasting without dispersing. “Flourishing” means thriving; “illuminating” means light penetrating. The heavens’ day and night differ from the human world. The Dao Lord reveals all heavenly beings coming to hear the Dharma.

The heavens’ sun, moon, stars, the Dipper’s handle and bowl: the wheels pause.

Every heaven has three lights; for the sake of hearing the Scripture, their rotation halts. The Dipper’s bowl is the constellation; the handle is the Dipper’s handle.

Divine winds are still and silent, mountains and seas conceal clouds, the sky has no floating haze, the four directions add clarity and brightness.

All attachments cease in silence; not a speck remains.

A nation’s land, mountains, rivers, forests, all equal and level, no high or low.

Refers to the Great Floating Li Land, all equally level, no distinctions of height.

The earth all turns to jade, no differing colors. The myriad true beings attend seated.

“No differing colors” means the earth is like jade in appearance. The Scripture says: Where the Dharma is spoken, palaces are all made of seven treasures. The Dao Lord reveals the Heavenly Venerable’s Dao power manifesting.

The Primordial Heavenly Venerable’s mysterious throne floats above the five-colored lion.

The Heavenly Venerable suspends in the void, ascending the seat, riding the black and floating in space, neither attaching to form nor formlessness. The lion is king of beasts, symbolizing the Heavenly Venerable’s dominion above, surpassing all heavens. Five colors are the Dharma’s luminous manifestations.

Upon one circuit of Scripture, all great saints of heaven simultaneously acclaim its goodness.

At the completion of one circuit, all heavenly beings, according to their root capacities, each attain understanding and praise its excellence.

At that time, a nation’s men and women deaf and ill, their ears all open and clear; after two circuits, the blind regain sight; after three, the mute speak; after four, the lame and chronically ill all rise and walk; after five, long-term illnesses vanish instantly; after six, white hair turns black, lost teeth regrow; after seven, the elderly regain youth, the young grow strong; after eight, women conceive, birds and beasts bear young, both born and unborn attain form; after nine, earth’s hidden treasures emerge, gold and jade dew manifest; after ten, dry bones regenerate, all rise as humans.

At one circuit, summons the deaf in the East to hear; two circuits, summons the blind in the South to see; three circuits, summons the mute in the West to speak; four circuits, summons the lame in the North to walk; five circuits, summons the chronically ill in the Northeast to be healed; six circuits, summons those with white hair in the Southeast to regain black hair and teeth; seven circuits, summons the aged in the Southwest to regain strength, the weak to courage; eight circuits, summons all born and unborn in the Northwest to attain form; nine circuits, summons the hidden below to shine forth; ten circuits, summons dry bones below to rise from death. At this time, all men and women in the nation wholeheartedly turn in reverence, all receive protection and salvation, all attain longevity.

During the Scripture’s recitation, no distinction of male or female, all share the blessing’s power. Those already born in heaven are protected by the Scripture; those yet undelivered in the world attain longevity by it. This is the Dao Lord’s preface to the Heavenly Venerable’s Scripture’s efficacy.

### The Dao Speaks: At the first circuit of the Primordial Heavenly Venerable’s Scripture, the Eastern Limitless Boundless Supreme True Great Gods, countless in number, float to the scene.

At the second circuit, the Southern Limitless Boundless Supreme True Great Gods, countless in number, float to the scene.

At the third circuit, the Western Limitless Boundless Supreme True Great Gods, countless in number, float to the scene.

At the fourth circuit, the Northern Limitless Boundless Supreme True Great Gods, countless in number, float to the scene.

At the fifth circuit, the Northeast Limitless Boundless Supreme True Great Gods, countless in number, float to the scene.

At the sixth circuit, the Southeast Limitless Boundless Supreme True Great Gods, countless in number, float to the scene.

At the seventh circuit, the Southwest Limitless Boundless Supreme True Great Gods, countless in number, float to the scene.

At the eighth circuit, the Northwest Limitless Boundless Supreme True Great Gods, countless in number, float to the scene.

At the ninth circuit, the Upper Limitless Boundless Supreme True Great Gods, countless in number, float to the scene.

At the tenth circuit, the Lower Limitless Boundless Supreme True Great Gods, countless in number, float to the scene.

The *Daozang* says: The Eastern is the An Tai Hall Village, the World of Accepting Goodness; the Southern is the Wan Li City Realm, the World of Abandoning Worthlessness; the Western is the Fu Tang Continent, the World of Universal Practice; the Northern is the Yu Dan Wilderness, the Pure World; the Northeast is the Fu Ji Village, the World of Eternal Peace; the Southeast is the Yuan Fu Field, the World of Worthy Use; the Southwest is the Yan Fu Village, the World of Benevolent Tranquility; the Northwest is the Fu De Village, the World of Extended Worthiness. The Upper is the Thirty-two Heavens, Mysterious Capital Jade Capital Purple Tenuity; the Lower is the Five Great Mountains and Nine Fortresses, Cavern Abyss Water Palace, Northern Capital Luo Zheng Thirty-six Palaces, the underground true spirits.

After ten circuits complete, the Limitless True Great Gods of the Ten Directions all arrive simultaneously. The nation’s men and women wholeheartedly turn in reverence. Those who come are as numerous as fine rain and dense mist, countless in number, filling half the nation. The earth tilts and sinks; it cannot be stopped.

All ten directions come, unbidden yet in unison. “Fine rain and dense mist” signifies their multitude. “Tilting” means leaning as if the land is narrow and unaccommodating. This is the Dao Lord’s preface to the Heavenly Venerable’s tenfold Scripture recitation, and the ten directions’ turning toward it.

### Then the Primordial Origin Suspended a Treasure Pearl,

The Heavenly Venerable displayed the image of the treasure pearl, skillfully opening salvation, manifesting the sacred to distinguish the mundane.

As large as a millet grain, suspended in the mysterious void, five zhang above the earth.

Millet, the smallest of grains, is the pearl’s size. The Heavenly Venerable manifested this pearl, the spatial distance from earth’s appearance being five zhang. Such wondrous principle cannot be described by brush. The Primordial millet pearl is possessed by every person’s nature; only the five desires obstruct, filling and expanding without leaving, thus it is suspended afar. If one can depart from the five desires, then a single point of spiritual light shines upon heaven and earth, no different from the Primordial millet pearl.

The Primordial Origin ascended and led the Heavenly True Great Gods, Supreme Sage High Lords, Wondrous Practice Perfected Persons, the Limitless Supreme True Great Gods of the Ten Directions, countless in number, all entering the treasure pearl.

The Heavenly Venerable compassionately suspended the pearl to show people, first ascending inside the pearl, guiding the myriad true beings. The Dao Lord reveals the Heavenly Venerable’s skillful display of the pearl.

The heavenly beings look up,

The Floating Li heavenly beings still have burdens, only able to gaze upon the pearl, unable to enter from form into formlessness.

They only see the multitude entering the pearl’s mouth; once inside, their whereabouts are unknown.

The heavenly beings only see the crowd entering the pearl’s mouth; no trace is visible.

The nation disperses, the earth returns to level, no longer tilted.

The Dao is once again concealed, the earth returns to its origin.

Within the pearl, the Primordial Origin completes the Scripture, the myriad true beings supervise salvation, then entrust it to me.

The Heavenly Venerable having led the myriad true beings to ascend into the mystery and wonder, then transmitted the Dao and spoke the Dharma inside the pearl. The Most High Dao Lord personally received this mandate. Completion means perfection. Supervising salvation means overseeing the opening of salvation.

At this time, joy and celebration are beyond words, all ritual matters completed, the heavens return to their places, gathered in stillness without lingering echoes. “Slight” means brief; “all” means detailed. The Great Dao needs no brief or thorough route, only to awaken to the true mystery; thus joy arises. Returning to place means each returns to original position. Silence means no sound can be heard. The Dao Lord reveals the difference between heavenly beings and mundane beings. At this time, heavenly and earthly beings encountering the Scripture’s Dharma universally receive salvation, fulfilling their year without harm.

At that time, in the Floating Li land, heavenly beings were trapped in form; though unable to enter the pearl, they met the Heavenly Venerable, and by this cause, all received salvation without suffering midway calamities. Heavenly years mean understanding and realizing the true constant, then certifying entry into the wondrous void Dao. The nation turns in reverence, all act with good hearts.

Throughout the entire nation, none do not turn toward it. They cultivate the twelve good deeds below.

Do not kill or harm; do not envy or resent; do not lie or steal; do not covet or desire; do not hate or quarrel; speak no flowery words, utter no evil sounds. These are the twelve good deeds. To kill is to sever all life; to harm is to trap all things; to envy is to destroy another’s success; to resent is to begrudge another’s victory; to stain without color is to defile; to take unjustly is to steal; to desire endlessly is to covet; to arise false thoughts is to lust; to detest others is to hate; to deceive others is to increase; flowery words are called ornate speech; harsh words are called evil sounds. All equally cherish love, differing bones become kin.

Having removed the three karmas, the six roots are pure; the body is seen as one, with no great or small affections.

The nation is peaceful and prosperous, joy and harmony abound.

Good causes mature, evil thoughts dissolve. The nation is peaceful and without trouble; the people enjoy peace. If one’s mind is pure throughout the twelve hours, equanimous toward all, without resentment or hatred, this is also one’s own mind’s great peace.

The Scripture first emerges to teach a nation; with the Dao, those with sincere hearts, honoring rites and respect, all receive salvation.

The Dao Lord says: I first received the Scripture from the Heavenly Venerable, then issued it to a nation, universally teaching heavenly and earthly beings. Those with prior cultivation, rare forms, esteemed and faithful, can advance from mundane to sacred. Salvation of the world means transcending the mundane world. This is the Dao Lord encouraging cultivation of the twelve good deeds.

Above is the Dao Lord’s preface to receiving the Scripture’s beginning and end.

### The Dao Speaks: What the Primordial Heavenly Venerable says in the Scripture are all the hidden resonant names within the heavenly emperors, also the secret taboo names within the demon kings, the hidden names of the myriad spirits, not common worldly words.

Hidden resonant names mean, for example, Emperor Yu, Successor Jade Bright, Great Choice Dharma Gate. Demon king taboo names mean, for example, Ba Yuan Chou Bo, Flowing Bell Eight Clashes. The myriad spirits’ hidden names mean, for example, the immortal who saves beings from death, to Tao Kang, He Yan. These are all not common worldly phrases. This is the Dao Lord’s detailed explanation of what the Scripture says.

The Supreme Sage has already become a perfected person, penetrating the profound and subtle, able to understand all chapters. Reciting it ten times, the heavens chant from afar, myriad emperors set rites, rivers and seas fall silent, mountains and hills hide clouds, sun and moon pause, the Dipper does not move, demons bind forms, ghosts and spirits vanish, corpses return to life, white bones become humans.

The highest heavens’ sages all descend from the Primordial Ancestral qi’s true division, thus able to penetrate mysteries, exhaust subtleties, fully understand its meaning. The Heavenly Venerable recites it ten times; the heavens hear from afar and chant; myriad emperors approach and bow; river and sea gods fall silent; mountain gods hide clouds; the seven luminaries stop moving and pause their light; demon spirits bind forms and vanish; the dead can return to life; white bones can become humans. The Dao Lord’s preface to the middle-grade people reciting the Scripture’s cause and effect.

The diligent scholar, reciting it ten times, is attended by the Five Emperors’ guards, the Three Realms bow. Demon spirits lose their eyes, ghost spirits vanish, the dying are saved, death is cut off and life attained.

The sincere scholar of the Dao, likewise reciting the Scripture ten times, is protected by the Five Directions’ Five Emperors and myriad spirits, all honoring him; demons and ghosts can be subdued; death cut off can return to life. The Dao Lord’s preface to the lower-grade people reciting the Scripture’s cause and effect.

Why? Because the scholar’s defilements are not yet dispelled, the body not yet fully penetrated to truth, summoning the Ten Directions, authority not yet controlling heavenly governance, virtue able to subdue earthly spirits, binding demons, but only able to repel death, not regenerate life. This is the near. Recent scholars’ hearts, though unstained by the six dusts, have not yet exhausted defilements; the body not yet penetrated to true mystery, yet the Ten Directions already heed summons; authority not yet able to govern the seven heavenly policies, yet virtue can subdue earthly gods. Though the body cannot transcend and regenerate, such a person can escape impermanence and repel death. The Dao Lord’s preface to the lower-grade people reciting the Scripture’s cause and effect.

Light recitation of this chapter brings calamity; reverent recitation brings flourishing. In life, the household prospers; in death, descendants multiply. Not only does one avoid disaster, but divine beings guard the door.

Light recitation brings evil retribution; respectful recitation brings good reward. In life, the household flourishes; after death, offspring are many. Not only oneself is free of disaster, but divine beings attend. The Dao Lord explains the sins and merits of disrespect and neglect.

This Scripture is honored and wondrous, uniquely surpassing the Jade Capital, boundless in salvation, the ancestor of myriad Daoist paths. Lofty and vast, its virtue is hard to surpass.

The Jade Capital is the capital atop the Jade Mountain. The Great Brahma is the true source of Brahma. This Scripture’s Brahma black eight gatherings form the merit of salvation; how can it be surpassed? Hence it alone surpasses the Jade Capital. The Dao Lord summarizes this Scripture’s merit as inconceivable.

---

### The Dao Speaks: Whoever recites this Scripture ten times, all heavens arrive together. Hundreds of millions of ancestors, suffering ghosts and spirits, all immediately receive salvation, ascending the Vermilion Palace grid. All receive transformation within nine years, reborn as noble persons. Generally, those who recite the Scripture in the Ten Directions, all heavens come to witness; kin of countless kalpas all obtain liberation, entering noble ranks through refining and salvation.

The Vermilion Palace is the Vermilion Mound Fire Mansion in the Southern World. The mansion has the court of flowing fire.

Generally, those who save the world are refined from the Vermilion Palace’s dense defilements to form immortal bones. The ranks have three grades: upper is three years, middle nine years, lower twenty-four years. This refers to the middle rank refining and salvation. The Dao Lord’s preface to those reciting the Scripture, souls of the dead have salvation ranks.

Those who love the Scripture, their merit full and virtue complete, all become divine immortals, ascending the Golden Pavilion, roaming and feasting in the Jade Capital.

The love of the heart means those who cultivate with the Numinous Treasure’s heart. When merit and practice are complete, the seven ancestors ascend together. The Purple-Golden Pavilion and White Jade Capital are all realms of the Great Luo Jade Clarity. The Dao Lord’s preface to those who love the Scripture surpasses those who merely recite.

Advanced scholars, cultivating and reciting this Scripture, immediately receive salvation, ascending to the Southern Palace.

Those of the highest rank, having recited and cultivated, are not bound by the Southern Palace’s limits, and can directly transcend and ascend. The Dao Lord’s preface to those who both cultivate and recite surpasses those who merely love the Scripture.

---

### Those in the world who receive and recite the Scripture shall extend life and longevity, and later attain the Dao of corpse liberation. The soul and spirit temporarily extinguish, not passing through hell, immediately returning to form, roaming the vast void.

Men and women in the world who receive the Scripture and recite it shall surely live long years; after death, not passing through the underworld, but returning to form and corpse liberation; their spirit flies through the great void. Corpse liberation means the body dies but the spirit does not perish. The Dao Lord encourages the world to receive and recite with such cause and effect.

This Scripture is subtle and wondrous, universally saving without end; all heavenly and earthly beings receive blessings. Boundless blessings, life and death receive favor.

This Scripture of salvation has boundless merit. Above, all heavens; below, all people, living and dead, all rely on it. The Dao Lord summarizes all cultivation, recitation, and holding of the Scripture as surely bringing blessings.

Treasured by the heavens, not passed to the next world. Those of utmost virtue bear golden treasures, sincerely pledging to Heaven before transmission.

Those who sincerely cultivate the Dao, wishing to obtain this Scripture, must bring faith and trust, solemnly establish vows, and report to Heaven before passing it on. This shows the Scripture’s rarity. The Dao Lord states the Scripture must not be lightly transmitted.

Light leakage and neglect bring disaster to nine ancestors, long servitude to ghost officials.

Light neglect, leakage, and disdain, those without reverence and faith, accumulate to harm nine ancestors; after death, they serve ghost officials, like pushing sand and rolling stones, filling mountains and seas, riding thunder chariots, shaking lightning and fire, suffering such pains without end—this is called long servitude to ghost officials. The Dao Lord warns Scripture recipients not to be negligent.

---

### Attending the Scripture are the Five Emperors, each commanding twenty-four jade youths and jade maidens, divine attendants protecting the Scripture recipients’ bodies.

Upon opening the Scripture’s scroll, divine guards immediately appear. The Five Directions’ Five Emperors each command twenty-four jade youths and maidens to guard. Jade youths and maidens are those refined pure and free of defilement. Five groups total five times twenty-four equals one hundred twenty. The body refers to the Scripture recipient’s body. The Dao Lord describes that upon opening the Scripture and reciting, divine beings come to guard.

---

### The Dao Speaks: On the first month’s long fast, reciting this Scripture frees the departed souls of former generations from the underworld’s long servitude, saving them to the Southern Palace.

On the first full moon, the Heavenly Official bestows blessings. Fasting and reciting this month can cut off the long-enduring suffering of ancestors in the underworld. Their souls ascend to the Red Bright Heaven Palace, receiving refining and salvation in the Southern Prosperity.

On the seventh month’s long fast, reciting this Scripture grants the body immortality; the heavens record names in yellow and white registers, erasing death and granting birth.

The seventh month is the Middle Origin; the Earthly Official pardons sins. Fasting and reciting this month can enter the immortal ranks. Heavenly beings record names, inscribing those who merit; the Northern Dipper erases death records; the Southern Dipper adds birth names.

On the tenth month’s long fast, reciting this Scripture brings peace and stability to kings, emperors, lords, ministers, and fathers and sons, ensuring the nation’s longevity, eternal heaven, rulers’ peace, and people’s harmony.

The tenth month is the Lower Origin; the Water Official relieves calamities. Fasting and reciting this month protects the kalpa’s cycle; rulers and people receive blessings.

On the eight seasonal days, reciting this Scripture grants the status of the Nine Palaces Perfected Persons.

The eight seasonal days are: Beginning of Spring, Spring Equinox, Beginning of Summer, Summer Solstice, Beginning of Autumn, Autumn Equinox, Beginning of Winter, Winter Solstice. The *Treatise on Response and Retribution* says: On these days, the Three Officials and Nine Offices record sins and merits. Fasting and reciting on these days increase good fruit. After death, spirits are born in the Nine Heavens. The Nine Palaces are the Nine Heavens’ palaces of spirit birth.

On one’s birth day, reciting this Scripture clarifies soul and spirit, all qi endures. No suffering is experienced; the body shines. The Three Realms guard; the Five Emperors escort. Myriad gods pay homage; names are recorded in heaven. Merit full, virtue complete, ascending to Upper Clear.

One’s birth day is one’s own natal day. On this day, the original spirit within flies to report sins and merits. If the scholar can fast and recite, life gains good power, death no evil retribution. Sitting, the Three Realms attend and protect; walking, the Five Emperors watch and welcome. Many feel this; ancient people say: The Dharma acts as the primordial one qi; using one’s original spirit, one can realize by mind. This describes the Three Origins, Eight Seasonal Days, and Birth Day auspicious dates, and the cause and effect of cultivation and recitation. The Dao Lord’s preface to scholars’ cultivation and recitation utility.

---

### The Dao Speaks: On days of Dao practice, one should bathe with fragrant water, fast and abstain, enter the room, face east, knock teeth thirty-two times, hear the thirty-two heavens, and bow the heart thirty-two times.

From here on, all is the method of cultivation and recitation. No need to read aloud, but to imagine accordingly. The practitioner will expound the Scripture. Washing hair and bathing the body, fasting the heart and holding precepts, all to connect the true qi of heaven and humans. Enter a pure room facing east to greet the life qi and sit. Knocking teeth gathers the body’s spirits to summon myriad spirits. Each knock corresponds to one heaven’s response, imagining oneself bowing to the thirty-two heavenly emperors. From the Supreme Ancestor Heaven downward, each heaven’s name is secretly recited, imagining the heavenly palace, pavilions, emperors and attendants, solemnly bowing as if personally paying homage.

Close eyes and meditate, sitting among blue, yellow, and white clouds of qi.

Gather light and look inward, without distracting thoughts. The three-colored clouds are the three realms’ mysterious primordial Brahma qi. Imagine beneath you three-colored blue, yellow, and white qi.

Inside and outside are lush and dim, with Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Black Tortoise, Lion, White Crane arrayed on left and right.

Inside penetrates the five organs; outside fills a chamber, lush and dense, always surrounding the Scripture table. Imagine blue qi from the liver exiting the eyes, transforming into Azure Dragon, residing on the left. White qi from the lungs exiting the nose, transforming into White Tiger, residing on the right. Red qi from the heart exiting the mouth, transforming into Vermilion Bird, residing in front. Black qi from the kidneys exiting the ears, transforming into Black Tortoise, residing behind. Next, imagine the lion, fierce beast, and white crane, pure bird, arranged on left and right.

Sun and moon illuminate, shining through the chamber.

The small cavities behind the eyebrows are the palace of the Six Harmonies; imagine sun and moon emerging from within. The sun rises from the left, purple-red light with nine rays; the great moon rises from the right, yellow-white light with ten rays. One cloud: the left eye is sun, the right eye is moon; within the chamber, golden-purple light shines brilliantly.

A round image arises from the nape, shining in all ten directions, clear and distinct.

Imagine sun and moon’s radiance pouring into your nose, entering four cun behind the brain’s golden flower palace. The round image emerges behind the nape, as large as a cartwheel, shining inside and outside, each part clear as if seen by one’s own eyes.

Secret mantra says: According to the following text, summon all spirits within the body.

Most Supreme Mysterious Primordial Great Dao Lord summons the three or five merit officers within my body, left and right officials and messengers, incense-attending jade youths, message-transmitting jade maidens, Five Emperors’ direct talismans, direct day incense officials, each thirty-two persons to emerge.

Silently imagine all emerging from within, each adorned, arrayed densely on left, right, front, and rear.

Opening and closing as spoken, today is auspicious, long fasting in the pure hall, cultivating to the Scripture, boundless salvation.

Those receiving the Dharma are those with position. If not yet received the Dharma mirror, one says: “Disciple of the Dao so-and-so, wholeheartedly speak as desired”; also a noble title is appropriate. If one knows the Three Caverns’ covenant Dao, seeing and acting accordingly, then say cultivating to the Scripture. If not such a person, do not speak. Only say pure hall Scripture recitation; if for all the Ten Directions’ ghosts and spirits, say boundless salvation. If reciting for a single matter, say reciting Scripture for a certain matter.

I and A and B, turning the Scripture and receiving life, wish the opening above to reach the Most Supreme Thirty-two Heavens Primordial Origin Supreme Emperor’s throne.

“I and A and B” means if for oneself or others, say “I and so-and-so.” If reciting for others, say “I for so-and-so,” as the heart cannot be two. Precious is sincerity, ascending before the heavenly emperors.

After blessing, draw qi thirty-two times, face east and recite the Scripture.

Beginning from the Supreme Ancestor Heaven, each name is praised; each heaven’s true qi is imagined, like jade mist’s radiance, flowing into my body, drawn by nose and inhaled by mouth, flowing into the five organs. Inside and outside become void white, then face east to greet life essence and hold recitation. The right side of the main Scripture’s preface above is the Dao Lord’s demonstration of scholars’ cultivation and recitation method.

# Commentary on Volume Two of the Supreme Wondrous Scripture of the Primordial Origin’s Boundless Salvation of Beings  
By Xue Jizhao, Manifest Elder of the Ice Lake Wilderness of Nine Rivers

---

This main Scripture was spoken by the Primordial Origin, hence directly called the Primordial Origin’s Boundless Salvation of Beings, indicating the Primordial Origin’s salvation of boundless beings through this Scripture.

The Primordial Origin’s Cavern Mystery, Numinous Treasure original chapter,

The Primordial Heavenly Venerable spoke this Scripture to reveal the Three Caverns’ profound Dao. The Dao Lord received the Primordial Cavern Mystery’s mandate, making it the foundation of Numinous Treasure cultivation of truth, elaborated into chapters. This refers to the Scripture’s upper and lower chapters.

The Supreme Wondrous Beginning, tenfold salvation, hundred demons’ hidden resonance, separation and union by nature.

The two chapters are the supreme wondrous beginning, the first of all wonders, the meaning of the Primordial Origin’s tenfold Scripture recitation. What is spoken are the secret meanings of the hundred demons; gathered, they are the original text; scattered, they are the Scripture. Separation and union are all natural. This is the Scripture’s small preface.

Chaotic cavern red script, no supreme truth.

Below all speak of the ancestral kalpa’s opening and transformation.

At chaos’s beginning, the cavernous qi, after many kalpas of fire refining, formed the red script. The Heavenly Venerable, in the void of non-being, took this red script as the foundation for all supreme high truths to save beings. The Primordial Ancestral Kalpa transformed and gave birth to the heavens.

Dragon Han, Red Brightness, Supreme Emperor, Extended Peace, Opening Emperor are all kalpa names. The ancestral kalpa is the first kalpa. Transforming and giving birth to the heavens means by Dragon Han’s Primordial qi opening transformation.

The Opening of the Three Sceneries is the root of heaven.

The ancestral kalpa’s Jade Clarity one black gave birth to two and became Upper Clear; two blacks gave birth to three and became Supreme Clear; three qi gave birth to nine blacks and gave birth to nine heavens. Above the nine heavens are thirty-two heavens, each with a sun, moon, and star—these are the Three Sceneries. Opening means to unfold; brightness means light; root of heaven means the Primordial Ancestral qi is the root of heaven’s transformation and birth.

Above there is no further ancestor, only Dao as body.

From the Primordial Origin upward, no further original ancestor exists; only this Dao is the body. This means all myriad dharmas arise from the Primordial Origin’s own ancestor.

Five writings open and expand, universally planting spirits.

After the chaotic cavern red script formed by kalpa fire, it evolved into the five heavens’ qi, transforming into five qi writings. From non-being arose all existence, the Three Realms’ spirits universally planted by this red script.

No writing without light, no writing without brightness, no writing without establishment, no writing without completion, no writing without salvation, no writing without birth. Without this red script, heaven and earth’s myriad things would not shine, be bright, be established, be accomplished, be saved, or be born. Former heavenly true beings said: Without the chaotic cavern red script, one cannot encompass and transform the nine Yang Bright heavens, nor save and form heavenly realms.

This is the great Brahma heaven’s heaven.

Above all speaks of the ancestral kalpa’s matters, the great Brahma’s calamity, merging and solidifying red script, opening and transforming the heavens. This Jade Clarity heaven is the highest of all heavens.

The Yu Luo Xiao Terrace, Jade Mountain Capital.

Below this heaven is Jade Capital Mountain, facing Kunlun Mountain, circling over eight hundred li, with the Yu Luo Xiao Terrace realm.

Highest supreme, Great Luo Jade Clarity.

All these are Brahma calamities formed into the highest, supreme, limitless Great Luo Jade Clarity realm.

Diminutive kalpa heights, seeming lost and seeming present.

The Jade Clarity upper realm surpasses all heavens, subtle and hard to see, enduring kalpas without destruction. Not measurable by zhang or chi, nor exhaustible by eyesight, seeming both existent and nonexistent.

The Three Flowers, Li Bian, Great Wondrous Court.

The Three Flowers Hall, Li Bian Palace, Great You Palace, Wondrous Court Palace are all places where the Primordial Origin governs the Mysterious Capital’s banquets and rest.

Golden Pavilion Jade Chamber, myriad pure frost, great Brahma circulation, circling the Ten Directions.

There are also Golden Pavilion, White Jade Chamber, Myriad Above Halls, Pure Pools, vast and flowing, all Jade Clarity Brahma calamities circulating and revolving, moving through the Ten Directions without ceasing. Above all speak of the Jade Clarity realm.

Within are the immortal gods who save beings from death, and the Southern Pole Lord of Longevity.

The Jade Clarity Primordial Origin, ancestor of kalpas, at each kalpa’s end issues the Dharma to save beings. The Primordial Origin in this kalpa opens the Red Bright chart. With this red script, the chaotic cavern is opened; the chaotic cavern opens to Myriad, thus within the Great Elixir Heaven are Brahma treasure elixirs, the Red Emperor refining true Yang essence, opening boundless salvation of beings. Called longevity, called immortality, all titles of the Fire Mansion’s honored gods.

Within are the Great Sima God who governs world salvation, and the Good Life Lord Han Jun Elder.

Sima Lord governs extinguishing evil and trials. Good Life Lord is another name for Azure Splendor. Han Jun Elder, named Ke Han, governs the Five Emperors.

Within are the Southern Upper Life Registrar, extending longevity, increasing calculation, saving calamities honored gods.

Southern Upper is the Fire Mansion, Southern Mound Upper Palace. Below the Life Registrar, all belong to the Fire Mansion’s governance, tasked with granting and removing merits and faults, disasters and blessings upon people.

Returning corpses to life, boundless salvation.

Like those in the world who perform corpse liberation, their bodies passing through the Great Yin, all are boundless in salvation.

Today’s audit and record, the heavens approach the throne.

Today the Heavenly Venerable at the Red Bright kalpa’s beginning, within the Floating Li country, opens the chart to audit and record. The heavens ride the Heavenly Venerable’s Dao power, all come to the throne’s steps. Audit means weighing sins and merits; record means noting merits and faults’ depth.

These are the Ten Directions’ Saviors’ Heavenly Venerable manifestations.

The Ten Directions’ Supreme Flying Heavenly God Kings, Lords of Longevity, Boundless Great Gods of World Salvation.

In former times, the Ten Directions’ Heavenly Venerables, since the Red Bright kalpa, came to the Floating Li country, opening audit and record days, receiving the Primordial Origin’s decree, governing the Ten Directions’ Three Realms, measuring merits and virtues, opening boundless salvation.

They ride flying clouds, cinnabar chariots, green carriages, feathered canopies and jade wheels, swiftly driving vermilion phoenixes, five-colored mysterious dragons, establishing nine-colored banners, ten supreme spiritual broadcasts.

The Ten Directions’ lands come to hear the Dharma, their mounts are wheels, carriages, canopies; their guides are dragons and phoenixes.

In front, nine phoenixes whistle in harmony; behind, eight luan birds blow in unison. Lions and white cranes whistle and sing melodiously.

Those who blow and sing are phoenixes, luan birds, lions, and cranes. “Yong yong” means harmonious sound.

The Five Elders open the path; myriad immortals support the carriage.

Opening the path are the Five Elders of the True Supreme Ancestral Mysterious Origin; supporting the carriage are myriad immortals and true beings of the Ten Directions.

Countless chariots and mounts float in the void.

Ten thousand make a myriad; ten myriad make countless; immortals and true beings ride and float in the void, harnessing the black, arriving before the Dao.

Light inclines and returns the carriage, supervising true salvation of life.

Pouring the round image, revolving the Dharma carriage, supervising the myriad true beings, opening salvation for all.

The heavens’ prime ministers, Southern Prosperity Upper Palace.

The Thirty-two Heavens each have a prime minister; Southern Prosperity is the Elixir Heaven world; Upper Palace is the Southern Mound Fire Mansion. Scholars becoming immortals must pass through this palace to refine the body.

Han Registrar, supervising great salvation.

Han Registrar is the Elder in the palace, governing the record and refining salvation texts. Supervisor of life governs the forging of souls and spirits, another name for rebirth.

Holding records and registers, all arrive before the emperor.

The Ten Directions’ Supreme True Great Gods all hold and calculate the salvation records, gathering before the emperor to be promoted.

According to who should be saved, strictly auditing the heavens.

According to the scholar’s merits, those to be saved are entrusted to the heavens for strict auditing. Above all, the palaces examine scholars’ merits and faults and the world’s sins and blessings.

Universally announcing to the Three Realms, the Limitless Spirit Village.

Then universally announcing to the lower realms of earth, water palaces, and the three palaces. Limitless means the home of all gods in the Three Realms, all are made to know and hear.

Spring and stream palaces, Northern Capital Luo Deng.

Spring and stream are at the northern sea’s lowest. Northern Capital is the northern underworld capital, heavy with yin qi, condensed into mountains called Zhengdu Mountain. Above it is the Great Luo’s Lower Extreme Wind Spring Mountain, nine hundred ninety-nine million nine hundred ninety-nine thousand nine hundred zhang high, circling ninety thousand li. Black vapor seeps, collecting sinful souls, all within this mountain.

Three Officials and Nine Offices, Twelve River Sources.

The mountain has three palaces: Upper Origin Palace near heaven’s edge, governed by the Heavenly Official; Middle Origin Palace to the mountain’s left, governed by the Earthly Official; Lower Origin Palace to the right, near Wind Fortress, governed by the Water Official. Each palace has three offices, with one hundred twenty underworld divisions, all the Zhengdu officials examining sinful souls. The Nine Offices are the nine islands, nine fortresses, and nine earth lords’ commands. The Twelve River Sources are the twelve water gods’ palaces. Water’s origin is called source; wherever a river source is, there is an official dividing governance.

Above, releasing ancestral examinations, countless kalpa kin.

Today the Heavenly Venerable, at kalpa’s end, announces to the Three Realms, first gathering all salvation scholars, from the Primordial Origin’s beginning to today, all ancestral kin through lifetimes, all to be universally saved and then refined. Illnesses removed, sin records erased, evil roots destroyed; none detained or mixed among ghosts.

The Heavenly Venerable’s command below is to swiftly remove sin records, cut off evil roots, not allowing detention or delay, or mingling among imprisoned ghosts.

The Primordial Origin’s talisman command, timely ascending and promotion.

Only then can one respond to the Primordial Origin’s illuminating talisman command, attaining timely ascent to the Upper Clear.

Northern Capital Cold Pond, guarding forms and souls.

The Northern Extreme Capital of Shuo Dan Yu Jue is the Zhengdu underworld’s realm. The mountain is extremely cold, with a cold ice pond, governed by the Northern Yin Heavenly Emperor. The Heavenly Venerable commands the Northern Capital, ordering its ghosts and gods to guard and protect the forms and souls, preventing dispersal and decay. Controlling demons and protecting promotion, salvation ranks Southern Palace.

Controlling subordinate demons, each ordered to protect and promote; scholars follow Southern Prosperity’s refining ranks, all nine-year grades, ascending to the Southern Palace.

Dead souls refined, immortalized into humans.

Dead souls whose ghostly nature is not exhausted must undergo great refining in the Southern Palace, then dispel defilements, feather and become immortals.

Living bodies receive salvation, kalpas endure long; following kalpa cycles, years equal heaven.

Living bodies are formed from parents’ essence and blood. Their souls, once refined in the Southern Palace, are no longer illusory forms but endure for countless kalpas. Kalpas end and begin; bodies follow cycles, matching heavenly kalpa years.

Eternal salvation from the Three Trainees, Five Sufferings, Eight Difficulties, transcending the Three Realms, roaming the Upper Clear.

The three trainees are the three evil gates: one, the gate of lust, the upper corpse path heaven trainee realm; two, the gate of attachment, the middle corpse path water trainee realm; three, the gate of greed, the lower corpse path earth trainee realm. These are the three evil gates, also called three corpse paths or three trainee realms. They delight in evil deeds within the human body, severing life roots, blocking the path to immortality, restraining the soul’s flight.

The five sufferings are also called five path gates: first, the suffering of form binding the mind gate, also called Mount Tai hell suffering path; second, attachment binding the spirit gate, also called wind knife suffering path; third, greed binding the form gate, also called carrying stone and bearing mountain suffering path; fourth, flower competition suffering the essence gate, also called filling sea and making river suffering path; fifth, body binding the soul gate, also called swallowing fire, eating coal, piercing soup suffering path. These five sufferings and five paths restrain the human body’s true path, severing the door to cultivation and immortality.

The eight difficulties are the three trainees and five sufferings combined. Also called three trainees: one, long night trainee; two, cold pond trainee; three, flogging stone trainee. The five sufferings are: one, knife mountain suffering; two, sword tree suffering; three, piercing soup suffering; four, furnace coal suffering; five, punishment suffering. Also, the three trainees are the Three Officials’ servitude: one, Heavenly Official’s servitude, running thunder and lightning; two, Earthly Official’s servitude, carrying mountains and stones; three, Water Official’s servitude, flogging and drawing ocean waves. The five sufferings are climbing knife mountain, treading sword tree, entering piercing soup, embracing copper pillar, swallowing fire and eating coal. The eight difficulties are the eight gates of the underworld’s vastness. Those who study the supreme Dao must first sever all burdens, utterly extinguish sufferings, then true calamities naturally descend, immortals naturally form, and one can transcend the Three Realms, roaming the Upper Clear. This speaks of scholars’ ancestral examinations undergoing refining and their own salvation.

Upper Clear Heaven, Heavenly Emperor Jade True, Formless Realm Brahma Practice.

Upper Clear Heaven is governed by the Dao Lord; among them, heavenly beings cultivate and perfect truth, pure as jade. The Formless Realm is governed by the Primordial Origin; the heaven’s center is pure Brahma calamity flow. Scholars ascending here merge with the Dao.
