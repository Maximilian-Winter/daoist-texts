### The Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate’s Marvelous Transformation, Divine Spirit, and the Mixed Cavern’s Crimson Script

### The Diagram of the River Chart and Image Numbers

Heaven One, Earth Two; Heaven Three, Earth Four; Heaven Five, Earth Six; Heaven Seven, Earth Eight; Heaven Nine, Earth Ten. Heaven’s numbers are five; Earth’s numbers are five; the five positions mutually accord and each has its union. Heaven’s numbers total twenty-five; Earth’s numbers total thirty. All the numbers of Heaven and Earth add up to fifty-five. This is the reason transformations come to be and spirits and ghosts move. The five directions, excluding the three original numbers of generation, thus the dragon emerges from fire, the tiger is born toward water; the mother conceals the child’s embryo, the child returns to the mother’s womb. All are the seven returns of the Golden Elixir, the nine returns of cinnabar, the marvel of the golden fluid. Therefore, this accords perfectly with the fourteen meanings within the scripture.

### The Diagram of the Thunderbolt Aperture

*Baopuzi* says: The mysterious female gateway, the one family, is not the heart, kidney, nose, mouth, liver, lung, grain passage, bladder, or the mud pellet. Knowing this one thoroughly, then at the winter solstice’s fire season, with medicines and bathing, the shedding and forming of the embryo all reside here. This aperture is the thunderbolt aperture; to obtain it is to capture the mechanism of thunder’s dew, no need to seek outside. The perfected person’s rising and plunging all rely on this. The dao’s methods resonate and communicate; the rest are mere details.

### The Diagram of the Mutual Use of Thunderbolt Mechanisms

Thunder is the pivot of Heaven; its nature is good, its lord is life, its body is yang, its image is yin. Thus, Jia, Bing, Geng, Ren are yang thunder.

The thunderbolt is the mechanism of Earth; its nature is evil, its lord is death, its body is yin, its image is yang. Thus, Yi, Ji, Ding, Xin are yin thunderbolts.

Thunder and thunderbolt mutually use each other.

Heaven and Earth share one body, the sun and moon join as a jewel. Movement brings thunder and lightning.

### The Diagram of the Vast and Profound Mystery

Heaven has no mist or filth; Earth no demons or dust.

Dark wisdom, cavernous clarity, vast and profound mystery.

The true book of the limitless, sincerity in the midst of no delusion. Within truth is the origin, outside sincerity there is no spirit. The mixed nature of Heaven and Earth, whipping and driving the body of wind and thunder. The one who is nature and body is the person of utmost truth and utmost sincerity.

### The Image of Heaven Round, Earth Square, and the Practice Thereof

This diagram accords with the pre-Heaven hexagram of round and square. Each eye in the center is the character *one* from the spiritual book’s formation, and when viewed alongside the previous two diagrams, the marvel of Heaven and Earth becomes apparent—beyond words.

### The Supreme Cavernous Profound Spiritual Treasure Infinite Salvation of Beings Supreme Scripture

“Supreme” means great. “Highest” means honored. The highest of the highest is the utmost honor. “Cavernous Profound” is a rank designation. The scripture has three caverns: the Cavern of the Perfected, presided over by the Primordial; the Cavern of the Profound, presided over by the Spiritual Treasure; and the Cavern of the Divine, presided over by the Dao and Virtue. This scripture was originally proclaimed by the Primordial, recorded by the Dao Lord, hence titled *Cavernous Profound Spiritual Treasure*. The proper scripture is simply called *The Supreme Scripture of the Primordial Infinite Salvation of Beings*, distinguishing it from earlier and later prefaces. The “Dao words” are the words of the Dao Lord. Combined, it is named *The Supreme Cavernous Profound Spiritual Treasure*, as the Dao Lord inherits the Primordial’s mandate. Infinite salvation of beings is the title of this one scroll. Among the three caverns’ thirty-six sections, this scripture is foremost, hence called supreme. “Marvelous” means most refined, most subtle, profound and unfathomable. Scripture means the path, the daily-use method of cultivating truth, the shared dao. Cultivation within is called the Elixir, the primordial true unity’s ancestral qi. There is no further ancestor above; only the Dao is supreme. “Cavernous” means hollow and clear; “Profound” means deep and subtle. Spirit is the true nature’s eternal existence; treasure is the primordial life force’s flow. One who cultivates it in the body can save beings; those saved are countless, beyond measure. To verify the highest path is to not depart from one’s own heart. This heart is the Dao, is the scripture; thus it is empty, spiritual, unobstructed, and saves beings without limit.

### Dao Words: In the past, within the Primordial Azure Heaven, in the Blue Firmament’s empty song, the Great Floating Li Land, received the Primordial’s Infinite Supreme Salvation.

“Dao words” are the words of the Most High Jade Dawn Dao Lord. The previous preface’s title is the Dao Lord recounting how he once received the scripture, recording the beginning and end, the cause of its compilation. The “Primordial Azure” is the Eastern nine qi Azure Heaven, one of the Nine Heavens of the Divine Firmament. This heaven condenses Brahman qi, with azure mists vast and clear, hence called Blue Firmament. The azure mist’s qi condenses into jade forests and precious trees; the spiritual wind stirs, forming a song of emptiness, called the Empty Song. The Great Floating Li Land is the name of the Eastern Extreme Country. The Dao Lord says: “In the past, within the Primordial Azure Heaven’s Floating Li Land, I received the Primordial Heavenly Venerable’s marvelous scripture, widely saving Heaven and Earth beings, called Infinite Supreme.” Earth is the central palace; the profound is the gate. Its number is five, the origin of all things in Heaven and Earth. Thus all flourishing arises from earth and returns to earth. This is our profound gate, the precious pearl. The primordial spirit is the Primordial itself. All myriad beings arise and transform endlessly from this. The Primordial Azure is the symbol of wood; fire is the dragon. The number three of thunder, Qian’s beginning, seeks and gives birth to the eldest son, like spring leading the four seasons, all things arise from it. Yet water is first born; water gives birth to wood; then wood gives birth to fire; fire is born of wood. This cycle of the Five Phases, endlessly generating, is clearly established.

### The Primordial Heavenly Venerable Should Speak This Scripture, Circling Ten Times, Summoning the Ten Directions, Then Taking His Seat.

“Primordial” is also Qian Origin and Kun Origin. Before Heaven and Earth, Heaven and Earth are born from it. It is the beginning of myriad transformations, the ancestor of myriad convergences, the response title of the Void Sovereign Heavenly Venerable, the supreme of all heavens. At this time, he expounds the scripture of salvation, circling ten times to summon the ten directions’ highest sages and venerables, convening in the midst of millet and pearls, spreading marvelous essence, then taking his seat to speak the scripture. The Primordial is the ancestral qi of the Dharma body, the primordial spirit; the so-called indestructible true void, originally from the true nature. When speaking this scripture, the ancestral qi is the body of the Elixir; the primordial spirit is undimmed, so the heavenly mandate flows endlessly, circulating through the six voids, movement and stillness without end, coming and going without cease—this is the circling ten times. Ten times means the five of birth and the five of completion; ten is the number of Heaven and Earth’s completion. The Elixir is cultivated over ten months to succeed. The ten directions are the odd numbers one, three, five, seven, nine—yang; and two, four, six, eight, ten—yin. This is the marvelous use of the returning Elixir. Within the profound gate, the true yin and true yang qi are already balanced; then the whole body’s hundred vessels play like rivers flowing, as if the ten directions’ true sages gather without summons.

### The Heavenly True Gods, Highest Sages, Marvelous Practicing Perfected, and Countless Uncounted Multitudes Ride the Void, Flying on Red Clouds to the Elixir Sky, Green Chariots and Jade Wheels, Feathered Canopies Shading, Flowing Essence and Jade Light, Five Colors Flourishing, Illuminating the Vast Void.

All the countless perfected immortals of the uncounted multitudes are five hundred million heavenly sun, moon, and stars; heavenly truths and earthly spirits; Heaven, Earth, Water palaces; Three Realms and Ten Directions’ immortals, sages, and saints—beyond counting. At once, all ride the void, commanding the void, stepping the Brahman, arriving without walking. Flying clouds and red skies, riding the three pure clouds, riding the crimson mist qi. Wheels, chariots, feathered canopies—all are divine transformations of the true saints, myriad forms and countless appearances, numinous and unpredictable. Flowing essence and jade light, five colors flourishing, flowing crystal three lights’ brilliance, intermingling with jade light, the perfected immortals’ perfect image and clarity. Thus the five colors interweave in the vast void, shining and penetrating. Within cultivation, when the Golden Mother returns to the spirit chamber, she uses spirit to capture qi, and qi to refine spirit; lead and mercury are captured and controlled; yin and yang gather in clans—this is the gathering of a thousand true and ten thousand saints. In a moment, golden fire shines in the spirit chamber, inside and out bright and clear, flowing essence dazzling with colors, five colors glowing brilliantly in the vast void.

### Seven Days and Seven Nights, the Heavens’ Sun, Moon, Stars, the Jade Pivot and Jade Balance, All Pause Their Wheels. Divine Wind is Silent, Mountains and Seas Hide Clouds. Heaven Has No Floating Shadows, the Four Qi Are Clear and Bright. One Country’s Land, Mountains, Rivers, Forests, All Equal, No More High or Low. All Become Jade, Without Differing Colors.

Seven is the number of fire, meaning the seven returns. The *Yijing* says: “Seven days come again.” All numbers meet seven and fork again. The ancient scholars say: Yang is born at the Rat hour, Yin is born at the Horse hour. From Horse to Rat is seven, then must return; this is the principle of Qian and Kun’s waxing and waning. Speaking in one day: from Horse hour to midnight, returning to Rat hour. In one year: from the fifth month when Yin is born, to the eleventh month returning to Rat month. In one month: from Horse day about seven days, returning to Rat day. This is the fixed number of the heavenly dao’s movement. The heavens are the thirty-two heavens. The sun, moon, stars, the Jade Pivot and Jade Balance are the celestial stars and the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper. At one moment the wheels stop turning; the celestial bodies merge, moving in cycles without a moment’s rest. At this time, the wheels stop turning and rest, returning to their root, the central path alone returns. Because it is still and returns, breath does not enter or exit; thus divine wind is silent, thoughts vanish, qi has no up or down, like mountains and rivers’ great clouds all hidden, the heavens’ floating shadows also removed, then the four qi are clear and bright. One country’s land is the Floating Li Land. Mountains, rivers, forests, all equal, no more high or low. When the scripture is spoken, the spirit’s gaze is fixed, pulse steady, heart at rest, nature returns, feelings darken, all affairs vanish, then all are equal. One’s nature is like the clarity of jade, without differing colors. If the student can forget form and sever thought, all phenomena are empty, the essence is clear, one truth alone revealed, then the body’s image, all vessels stop, true lead shows color. This is called all earth becoming jade. The Profound Master says: This is great stillness, spirit light shining, seeing the realm of Jade Clarity.

### All the True Ones Attend the Seat; the Primordial Venerable Sits on the Profound Seat Floating in the Void upon the Five-Color Lion.

The Primordial is the primordial spirit. The profound seat is the spirit chamber. Thus floating five zhang above the ground, not attached to form. The five colors are the marvelous transforming qi. The lion is the heart’s knowledge. All true ones attend the seat left and right; the Primordial’s Dharma body profound seat floats in the void; the five qi face the crimson palace. The five colors are bright and clear; the primordial spirit dwells in the spirit chamber, dark heart capturing qi, the Three Realms mixed and fused, heart knowledge bright and marvelous, illuminating the great nothingness; thus the five directions’ colors interreflect in the central yellow palace.

### After One Complete Recitation of the Scripture, All the Great Saints of Heaven Simultaneously Praise “Good.” At This Time, Deaf and Sick Men and Women of One Country All Have Their Ears Opened and Hearing Restored.

After the second recitation, the blind have their eyes opened.

After the third recitation, the mute can speak.

After the fourth recitation, the lame and sick can all rise and walk.

After the seventh recitation, the old return to youth, the young all become strong.

After the eighth recitation, pregnant women conceive, birds and beasts carry embryos; those born and unborn all receive generation.

After the ninth recitation, the Earth Treasury manifests and discharges, golden jade dew appears.

After the tenth recitation, withered bones come to life, all rise as adults.

At this time, all men and women of one country wholeheartedly receive protection and salvation, all attain longevity.

### The Nine Returns of the Golden Elixir’s Work Takes Ten Months as the Embryo Completes Divine Transformation. The River Chart’s Numbers Generate from One to Ten, Endless Generation. The Luo Book’s Changes and Uses, Except for Ten’s Vertical and Horizontal, One-Five-One-Ten, Are the Fixed Numbers of Heaven and Earth’s Five Phases.

How could all things and matters go against this? Thus, after the first recitation of the scripture, Heaven One gives birth to water. Water is gestated in Qian metal; thus the child resides in the mother’s womb, called the empty qi metal embryo. All things in Heaven and Earth arise from this; water is the beginning of numbers. The great saints of Heaven simultaneously praise “good,” all heavens rejoice. They enable the one qi to circulate, all spirits to flow smoothly. Men and women of one country are like one body’s yin-yang qi. When the qi is relaxed, the deaf become hearing. Kan is the ear; when the number completes its cycle, the deaf become unblocked. After the second recitation, Earth Two gives birth to fire. Fire is gestated in Xun wood; thus the mother conceals the child’s embryo, called the wood-fire same position. Li is the eye; when the number completes, Li shines brilliantly, no eye is not clear. After the third recitation, Heaven Three gives birth to wood. Zhen wood is gestated in Gen water; sound belongs to metal. Metal originally restrains wood but paradoxically gestates in the metal homeland. Wood ceases at Shen but gestates at You; this is the image of wood containing metal. Metal and wood are restrained, so sound arises; thus the mute can also speak. After the fourth recitation, Earth Four gives birth to metal. Dui metal is gestated in Kun earth; thus earth can give birth to metal. The foot belongs to wood, and after the fourth recitation, the lame and sick rise and walk. Metal ceases at Yin but gestates at Mao; metal once gestated in wood, showing metal contains wood. After the fifth recitation, Heaven Five gives birth to earth. Wu earth gestates qi in Li fire, receiving Heaven and Earth’s correctness. Flowing Wu meets Yi, two earths form a jade tablet. Thus Kan’s Wu month essence and Li’s Yi day light, sun and moon join as a jewel. If one can know cultivation, restrain anger and block desire, preserve the heart and nourish nature, diligently refining oneself without ceasing, then the Great One contains truth, the mysterious pearl forms image, uniting with Heaven and Earth, longevity and long sight are not difficult. Why worry about long-term chronic diseases? People’s distress in illness arises from ignorance of the marvelous return. After the sixth recitation, Earth Six completes it. Heaven One gives birth to water; Kan is in the north, yang within with true yin. Thus Qian metal gives birth to Kan water forming true lead. Lead is metal’s mother, lead is black and metal is white; thus white hair returns to black, teeth fall and regrow—all are responses to returning to origin. After the seventh recitation, Heaven Seven completes it. Earth Two gives birth to fire; Li is in the south, yin within with true yang. Thus Xun wood gives birth to Li fire forming true mercury, the seven returns. Li mercury is controlled by metal and lead; thus metal and fire warm and refine. Qian metal is old yang; Li fire is young yin. Thus old return to youth, young all become strong. After the eighth recitation, Earth Eight completes it. Heaven Three gives birth to wood; Zhen is in the east. Gen and Zhen combine to form water; mercury responds to lead qi and forms sand. Sand contains mercury’s essence symbolizing pregnancy; all are the primordial true unity’s qi, condensed within the rule, generating myriad convergences, cycling day and night, nourishing the sacred embryo. Not by the qi of post-Heaven yin dregs can it be nurtured. Thus pregnant women conceive, birds and beasts carry embryos; those born and unborn all receive generation. After the ninth recitation, Heaven Nine completes it. Earth Four gives birth to metal; Dui is in the west. Dui metal combines with Kun earth; Kan water conceals in the mother’s womb, the nine returns. Thus mercury returns to the earth cauldron forming treasure, the one qi returning to the source. Born from empty qi metal embryo without visible metal essence, now metal occupies the original nature, returning to the central palace as the Elixir body. The center is earth; earth is land, thus the Earth Treasury manifests and discharges, golden jade dew appears. The Golden Mother dwells in the central palace. After the tenth recitation, Earth Ten completes it. Heaven Five gives birth to earth; earth is in the center. Earth is the root of all things’ generation. Heaven Five’s earth is yang earth; Earth Ten’s earth is yin earth. Two earths overlap forming a jade tablet; thus the returning Elixir is called the blade tablet. Metal dwells within, Qian metal counteracts Li fire within Kun earth, the so-called inversion of the Five Phases. If one can cultivate it, one returns from old to young, transcending the mundane into the sacred, thus able to raise the dead and restore life, like the Supreme One’s governance of Xu Jia. Therefore, withered bones come to life, all rise as adults. At this time, all men and women of one country wholeheartedly listen; all receive protection and salvation, all attain the way of longevity. The country is like the body; men and women are yin and yang qi. “Wholehearted” means yin and yang attract their kind. When yin-yang qi harmonizes, Taiyi returns to truth, giving birth to the body and receiving salvation; death’s soul receives refinement—this is called longevity.

This is the Dao Lord’s preface recording the scripture’s beginning and end. Ten times saving beings, ten turns returning spirit—this scripture and preface’s original meaning. The Heavenly Venerable speaks the scripture, summoning the ten directions’ infinite true multitudes, all floating in the air and arriving. Eastern Brahma Monitor Xu Yan Tian and others of the Zhen Palace Mao position are the uncounted multitudes. Southern Yudan Infinite Heaven and others of the Li Palace Wu position are the uncounted multitudes. Western Linghua Brahma Assistant Heaven and others of the Dui Palace You position are the uncounted multitudes. Northern Dongyuan Transformation Responding Voice Heaven and others of the Kan Palace Zi position are the uncounted multitudes. Northeast Gao Xu Clear Bright Heaven and others of the Gen Palace Yin position are the uncounted multitudes. Southeast Polonimi Bu Jiao Le Heaven and others of the Xun Palace Si position are the uncounted multitudes. Southwest Jiran Dou Shu Heaven and others of the Kun Palace Shen position are the uncounted multitudes. Northwest Shang Shang Chan Shan Infinite Longevity Heaven and others of the Qian Palace Hai position are the uncounted multitudes. Upper Nine Heavens Upper Clear Jade True Thirty-Six Heavens and others are the uncounted multitudes. Lower Colorless Realm, Form Realm, Desire Realm Thirty-Two Heavens and others, up to the Three Origins and Nine Earths uncounted multitudes, all gather within the Primordial Azure Heaven’s Floating Li Land, hearing the scripture and listening to the dharma. Cultivating within, true lead is the medicine, the ancestral profound gate is the Elixir base—this is the Primordial speaking the scripture. Earth dwells in the central palace, forming the ten numbers; the center is the profound gate. Ten recitations are the numbers of Heaven and Earth’s generation. The ten directions are the Five Phases’ matchings: one, three, five, seven, nine are the heavenly numbers, twenty-five, yang essence; two, four, six, eight, ten are the earthly numbers, yin flower. Yang’s generating number is five, the root of the Five Phases; yin’s completing number is ten, the root of myriad transformations. One and nine, four and six combine to ten, metal and water share the same clan; two and eight, three and seven combine to ten, wood and fire share the same body. Altogether fifty-five, divided among the five directions. When the Five Phases invert, the dragon emerges from fire, the tiger is born toward water; fire born of wood, then mercury is extracted from sand, the seven returns; cinnabar returns to origin. Water born of metal, silver controls lead within, the nine returns; golden fluid returns to truth. The *Yijing* says: Heaven and Earth intertwine, myriad things blend and mature; this is the infinite, limitless supreme true gods all arriving. Thus the Elixir base’s law and image divide into three hundred eighty-four lines, cycling fire seasons, internally moving the Five Stars, the Twenty-Eight Constellations arrayed, the cauldron hastens the three thousand six hundred true qi, revolving the seventy-two seasons’ key passes, driving the sixty-four hexagrams’ yin talismans, stirring the twenty-four qi’s yang fire; then the three souls guard the form, the seven spirits return to the body. Within the body are twelve thousand gods, all obeying commands at once; this is called the ten turns returning spirit, myriad qi harmonizing into immortality.

---

### After the Ten Recitations’ Completion, the Ten Directions’ Infinite Heavenly True Gods All Arrive at Once. Men and Women of One Country Wholeheartedly Bow in Devotion; Those Who Come Are Like Fine Rain and Dense Mist. The Uncounted Multitudes Fill Half the Country, the Earth Sinks, Not to Be Stopped.

When the scripture reaches the end of the ten recitations, the ten directions’ heavenly true gods all gather at once. Men and women all bow in devotion, like fine rain and dense mist. Half the country is filled, the earth sinks unevenly, not to be stopped. The Primordial’s virtue and power are exalted; the earth cannot bear it, thus it sinks unevenly, but no one can stop it. The body’s ten turns’ work is complete, then the mind and breath condense, nature returns, life restores; true lead returns to the chamber. The body’s yin and yang qi blend, steaming the four limbs like rain and mist’s moistening, circulating through six voids, up and down without fixed position, coming and going endlessly. The uncounted multitudes fill and overflow; though the country’s earth sinks, it cannot be stopped.

### Then, the Primordial Suspends a Precious Pearl, as Large as a Grain of Millet, in the Empty Void, Five Zhang Above the Earth.

Master Xin says: The Primordial is the self’s primordial spirit. The precious pearl is the heart. Confucians say Supreme Ultimate; Buddhists say Perfect Awakening; all are one principle. Dao also calls it the Profound Pearl, Heart Pearl, Millet Pearl—this is the thing itself. “Precious” means utmost refinement and truth, thus called spiritual treasure. As large as millet, because its vastness contains the cosmos, and its minuteness enters the hair’s tip; so great without outside, so small without inside, transformations unfathomable. Thus it is in the empty void, not to be sought by trace. Five is the earth number, belonging to the Five Phases’ center. Like the numbers of Five Phases’ generation, in the void it symbolizes the Supreme Ultimate; the heart’s emptiness is where the primordial spirit dwells—this is the empty void. Is this not the empty qi metal embryo? Thus the Profound Master says: This is the Jade Clarity Pearl, the path of spirit transformation and immortal embryo. According to Xiao Guanfu: The Primordial suspending the pearl is spirit and Dao together. Previously, the scripture’s lion atop is the spirit condensed in the chamber, from nothing to something. Now this suspended pearl in the empty void transcends spirit and form, beyond existence and nonexistence. This is the Heavenly Venerable manifesting marvelous transformation’s mechanism, revealing the utmost refinement and subtlety, containing the most marvelous dao.

### The Primordial Leads the Heavenly True Gods, Highest Sages, Marvelous Practicing Perfected, Ten Directions’ Infinite Supreme True Gods and Uncounted Multitudes, All Enter the Pearl. The Celestial Beings Look Up, Only Seeing a Flurry Entering the Pearl’s Mouth; Once Entered, Their Location Is Unknown. The Country’s People Disperse, the Earth Returns to Level, No More Sinking.

The Heavenly Venerable suspends the precious pearl in the empty void, leading the Three Origins and Nine Sages, Five Elders and Nine True Ones, Heavenly True Gods, and uncounted multitudes, all entering the pearl. The celestial beings look upward, all within the empty void, within the five lights, among billions of rays. Only seeing a flurry entering the pearl’s mouth, then no longer seeing the empty void’s realm. Thus their location is unknown. The country’s people all disperse, silent and unmoving; the earth also levels, no longer sinking. Those not of the Heavenly True Highest Sages cannot enter the empty void’s marvel, only looking upward. The ten directions’ infinite supreme true gods and uncounted multitudes all enter. Are they not celestial beings? Their own heart pearl is bright and clear, qi united with spirit, gathering all into one; thus the uncounted multitudes all enter our pearl’s mouth. Then the six roots are quiet, one truth alone revealed; how could there be uneven sinking or leveling?

---

### Within the Pearl, the Primordial Completes the Scripture; All the True Ones Oversee Salvation, Bestowing It Upon Me. At This Time, Joy and Celebration Are Beyond Words. The Dharma Ceremony Is Roughly Completed; the Heavens Return to Their Positions; In an Instant, All Is Silent Without Echo.

Within the pearl, the Primordial completes the scripture; all true ones oversee salvation, bestowing it upon the Dao Lord. At this time, joy and celebration are beyond words, indescribable. The ritual affairs are roughly completed; all heavenly truths return to their posts. Suddenly, all is tranquil, silent without echo. Within, the primordial spirit dwells, centered in one qi, blending nine apertures, illuminating the Golden Mother, controlling sand and mercury, returning to the cauldron. Upon reaching this stage of practice, joy is indescribable. In a moment’s work complete, myriad gods return to origin. Faint and dim, dark and silent, the pearl’s image no longer returns to the limitless.

---

### At This Time, Celestial Beings Encounter the Scripture and Dharma, Universally Receiving Salvation, Completing Their Years Without Harm. The Whole Country Bows in Devotion, All Act with Kind Hearts: No Killing, No Harm, No Jealousy, No Envy, No Lust, No Theft, No Greed, No Desire, No Hatred, No Malice. Words Are Without Flowery Ornament, Mouths Without Evil Speech, All Equal in Compassion and Love, Different Bones Become Kin. The Country Is Peaceful, the People Prosper, Rejoicing in Great Peace.

After the Heavenly Venerable finishes speaking the scripture and the heavens return to their positions, upon hearing the scripture and dharma, all universally receive salvation, completing their heavenly years without premature death. All bow in devotion to the scripture and dharma, suddenly acting with kind hearts. All killing, harming, jealousy, envy, lust, theft, greed, desire, hatred, and malice are all cleansed. This is compassion as one body, different bones becoming kin; thus the country is peaceful, the people prosperous, only rejoicing in the image of great peace. Human nature is not without goodness; its unkindness is all obscured by material desires and drowned in habitual tendencies. Thus, straying into perverse extravagance and forgetting the way, one surely harms one’s heavenly years. Only by restraining the hearts of killing, jealousy, lust, theft, and greed, knowing that all people are our compatriots and all things our kin, and meeting them with compassion and love, can one bring about national peace, abundant people, and joyful great peace. This is the caution for those who cultivate and nurture. Having heard the scripture and dharma, one gathers the heart and condenses the spirit, refining oneself and saving others as the foundation. Over time, returning to root and restoring life, feelings darken, nature quiets, then one may hope for longevity and long sight. Moreover, restraining anger and blocking desire, governing emptiness and guarding stillness, reducing again and again, moving, stillness, speech, silence, all without fault, then surely one can avoid killing and harming, avoid lust and theft. What need is there for flowery ornament or evil speech? At this point, all moving creatures, flying and crawling, are objects of compassion; there is no distinction of kinship or estrangement. The country is like the body; if one can harmonize qi, all things are nurtured. Though assisting transformation and nurture, the yin supports the imperial mandate—all comes from within. This is why the country governs peace, securing the people’s abundance and joy.

### The Scripture First Emerges to Teach One Country; Those with Sincere Hearts Precede the Dao, Revering and Respecting the Rites, All Are Saved in the World.

This speaks of the Heavenly Venerable first speaking the scripture. The people of one country all follow the Dao and act accordingly; thus the teaching is established. The heart is the spiritual brightness from countless kalpas ago; even before the scripture and dharma emerged, this heart was already present, awaiting the day. Only deep immersion in illusion and confusion causes it to be abandoned and lost. Now, through the scripture and dharma’s salvation, sudden awakening and release occur; nature returns, life restores; once following the Dao, all illusions return to truth. “Revering” means the root or source. Like water’s source is the sea, all return to their source. “Rites and respect” mean sincere faith. Thus all obtain salvation. If one forgets the root and chases the branches, abandons the source and seeks the flow, how can one save the world? The scripture is the path of the Dao; the heart is the root of the Dao. If one can rely on the scripture and gather the heart, then one attains the scripture’s marvel.

---

### Dao Words: What the Primordial Heavenly Venerable Speaks in the Scripture Are the Hidden Sounds of the Heavenly Emperors’ Inner Names, Also the Taboos of the Demon Kings, the Hidden Names of the Hundred Spirits, Not the Common Words of the World.

The inner names of the Heavenly Emperors are the names of the thirty-two heavens. The taboo names are the inner sounds of the Heavenly Emperor’s jade characters. The hidden rhymes are the so-called hidden rhymes of the heavens, the natural spiritual notes of the heavens’ sound. The demon kings’ taboos are the five heavenly demon kings’ taboos Ba, Yuan, Chou, Bo. The hundred spirits’ hidden names are Wu Ying, Bai Yuan, Tao Kang, He Yan. All are proclaimed by the Heavenly Venerable, recorded by the Dao Lord, not known by the common world. Seeking within, like the alchemical scripture’s so-called sun soul and moon spirit, metal tiger and wood dragon, mercury and cinnabar, red lead and black tin, yellow sprout and white snow, the beautiful girl and infant, yellow granny and golden lord, yang fire and yin talisman, profound gate and earth cauldron, furnace cauldron and hexagram images, and so forth. Though many different names and titles, all are the primordial true unity’s qi, the ancestor of the Elixir. Without a teacher’s pointing, how could ordinary fools know?

### The Highest Sage Has Already Become a Perfected Person, Penetrating the Profound and Investigating the Subtle, Able to Fully Understand Its Chapters. Reciting It Ten Times, the Heavens Sing from Afar, the Myriad Emperors Set Rituals. Rivers and Seas Become Silent, Mountains and Valleys Hide Clouds. The Sun and Moon Stop Their Light, the Jade Pivot Does Not Move. Demons Are Bound, Ghosts Are Extinguished. Returning the Corpse to Life, White Bones Become Human.

This speaks of the perfected person’s recitation’s efficacy. The Highest Sage has already become perfected, like the Heavenly Emperor’s high true host cultivating marvelous practice; the sacred work is complete, no need for further practice. The perfected person, through refined heart and arduous practice, refines spirit and nourishes qi, then the body conforms to nature, neither stuck in existence nor nonexistence, forever escaping birth and death. This is all penetrating the profound subtlety, fully understanding the hidden mysteries; thus able to fully grasp its secret chapters, such as the five chapters of the mixed cavern crimson script. Fully understanding, then reciting ten times, the heavens descend, myriad emperors observe, all sing jade tones, set rituals for inner taboos, all respect the scripture’s intent, praise the scripture’s power. Then rivers and seas stop waves, mountains and valleys withdraw clouds, sun and moon stop wheels, stars halt shining, demons are confined, ghosts hide, all are effects of recitation, bringing great response. Even able to return corpses to life, white bones become human; though souls sink and spirits vanish, all ride the scripture’s power to be reborn. The effect of ten recitations, in alchemy, is the ten-month embryo completion and divine transformation. The heavens are the true lead’s internal fusion, myriad gods harmonizing; rivers, seas, mountains, and valleys are the seas of love and suffering. If one can reveal one truth alone, myriad illusions are empty; then the seas of love cease, the waves of suffering clear. The sun, moon, and jade pivot are great stillness’s spirit light, illuminating the eight consciousnesses; then external demons are subdued, internal demons extinguished. At this point, the body is born and receives salvation, the death soul receives refinement; how could there be no power to return the bones to life?

### The Most Dedicated Students Reciting Ten Times Are Attended by the Five Emperors, the Three Realms Bow, Demonic Spirits Lose Their Eyes, Ghostly Fiends Are Extinguished, Salvation Descends to the Dying, Death Is Cut Off and Life Is Gained.

This speaks of the most dedicated students’ recitation’s efficacy. The most dedicated are those who cultivate with iron-like heart and fierce endurance of water and fire, whom Heaven and Earth cannot surpass, demons cannot confuse, and ordinary people cannot follow; all are the power of diligent practice. Thus reciting the scripture ten times, the five qi’s gods attend, obeying the three realms; demon kings also bow and recommend. This is because the most dedicated students have accumulated merit; controlling demons, the demon spirits are terrified and subdued, dare not look directly, thus lose their eyes. Since demon kings have recommended, ghosts and fiends are bound and extinguished. By this, salvation descends to the dying and those cut off are given life again. Seeking within, the five emperors are the five viscera’s gods. The three realms’ three corpses are the six thieves; demon spirits and ghostly fiends are the seven emotions and six desires. If one can dispel desires and purify the heart, think little and desire little, then the heart is calm and spirit clear, essence complete and qi solid; then the five viscera are peaceful, the three corpses diminish, the six roots are pure, myriad thoughts empty. When internal demons cease, external demons are naturally removed. With one’s refined cultivation, saving the dying’s illness, wherever true qi reaches, even the cut off can live again; this is the body’s ten recitations, the Elixir base gradually formed’s response.

### Therefore, Those of Ordinary Learning Whose Defilements Are Not Yet Removed, Whose Body Has Not Yet Penetrated Truth, Summoning the Ten Directions, Whose Power Cannot Control Heaven’s Governance, Virtue Can Subdue Earthly Spirits, Binding Demon Spirits, But Only Able to Repel Death, Cannot Regenerate.

This speaks of ordinary learners whose recitation’s power is not yet complete. Heavenly governance means sun, moon, and five stars; in Heaven called the seven governors. Earth spirits are the mountains, rivers, and shrines, the gods of soil and grain. Ordinary learners cannot reduce desires and purify the heart; thus their defilements are not removed, their nature and principle still obscure, so the body nature cannot penetrate truth. Therefore, they cannot do as above. Though they summon the ten directions’ gods, their power cannot control the movement of heavenly governance; their virtue can only subdue and bind earth spirits and demon spirits, sufficient only to repel death and extend life, but cannot hope for the way of longevity. Because spirit is confused, qi turbid, essence defiled, thoughts confused, even if they protect against erosion, exorcise five directions, cut demon stars, rescue drought and boiling, slay dragons and clams, bring rain and snow, retreat tides, all matters concerning heavenly governance cannot be controlled. The earth spirits’ gods cannot verify their heavenly grade, so their merits only suffice to subdue. If the learner’s recitation is earnest, one thought not born, myriad conditions cease, directly reaching the pearl’s realm, is this not penetrating truth?

### Lightly Reciting This Chapter Brings Disaster to the Body. Offering Respectful Rites Brings Prosperity to the Gate, Flourishing Generations, Good Causes and Conditions, Ten Thousand Disasters Do Not Touch, Divine Protection Guards the Gate.

This warns the common and lower learners of the merits and faults. Lightly reciting this chapter—since the scripture is formed of three days’ Brahman qi, cloud script and dragon script, not common words—if carelessly recited, the offense of disrespect surely brings disaster. Though the three caverns’ scriptures must be gathered with heart and spirit, recited without negligence, how much more this scripture! Thus Xue Youqi said: Not straightening the body, not following ritual, acting outside standing, sitting, and lying, merely reciting casually, is disrespect. If reciting without respect, better not recite but respect. Master Xin’s admonition: At the start of reciting scripture, gather myriad thoughts into one, that is the Primordial summoning the ten directions. Properly reciting the scripture is the Primordial speaking the scripture. Emotions, thoughts, and spirit not wandering recklessly is the ten directions listening to the scripture. All illusions returning to truth is the Heaven and Earth receiving salvation. This teaching is supreme. Lower learners who can cultivate earnestly, offer respectful rites, fold palms and show utmost respect, externally the home flourishes, internally body and mind are peaceful, generations prosper without end; accumulating supreme goodness, moving with auspicious meetings, disasters do not invade, evil retreats, bells respond to divine protection.

### This Scripture Is Supreme and Marvelous, Alone Walking the Jade Capital. Saving Beings Without Limit, It Is the Ancestral Root of Ten Thousand Dao. Lofty and Grand, Its Virtue Is Hard to Fully Bear. The Sound Rises.

Master Xin says: Great indeed is the *Spiritual Treasure Scripture of Salvation*. It is not composed by mere words. Scriptures are destroyed by kalpas and must be destroyed; only this text remains in the Jade Capital. From ancient times to now, all highest sages, immortals, and Buddhas who attain the Dao have not failed to honor the *Scripture of Salvation*. Among all scriptures, the *Primordial Salvation* is the supreme scripture. Since the Primordial Ancestral Kalpa’s transformation and birth of the heavens, its mixed cavern crimson script, empty cavern spiritual chapter, thus opening the three scenes, circling the ten directions, five writings expanding, myriad models unfolding, giving birth to Heaven and Earth, nurturing myriad things—all come from this, the root of Heaven and Earth. It can summon hundreds of millions of heavenly truths, uncounted multitudes, all within one millet; this is the root of ten thousand Dao, called infinite, universally saving without end. Thus supreme and marvelous, uniquely the supreme scripture of the Jade Capital. Its lofty merits cannot be fully borne. This scripture is where thousands of true and ten thousand saints cultivate, myriad dharmas and thousand lineages emerge; thus enduring ancient and modern without decay, pre-Heaven and lasting long. Spread wide it fills the six voids; gathered it does not fill a handful. The Buddhist so-called “endless sands of the river” and countless marvelous meanings are all contained in one hair’s tip. This is nothing other than the original true nature from before kalpas. Is it not supreme and marvelous? Thus infinite and boundless, its great model and virtue cannot be measured or fully borne. If one can cultivate it, is it not alone walking the Jade Capital? Master Xin says: The scripture is transmitted by the heart, comprehended by the heart; students should have eyes to investigate thoroughly.

### Dao Words: Whoever Recites This Scripture Ten Times, All the Heavens Arrive Together; Hundreds of Millions of Ancestors’ Dark Souls, Suffering and Refreshing, All Immediately Receive Salvation, Ascending to the Vermilion Palace. The Grades Are Nine Years, Receiving Transformation and Rebirth, Becoming Nobles. Those Who Love Learning the Scripture, When Their Merit Is Full and Virtue Complete, All Become Divine Immortals, Flying Up to the Golden Gate, Banqueting in the Jade Capital.

This means no matter one’s rank or virtue, reciting ten times can aid one’s ancestral mysterious dark souls to receive salvation’s power. Hundreds of millions of ancestors mean since the Primordial, countless generations of parents and ancestors. Dark souls suffering and refreshing are all souls and spirits in the dark long night not yet saved. The Vermilion Palace is the Southern Prosperous Upper Palace. The grades of refining and salvation are three: highest learning three years to receive salvation, middle wisdom nine years, lower learning twenty-four years. All cultivation and recitation’s power, regardless of person’s rank, wise or foolish, as long as one gathers mind and holds heart, chanting ten times, the scripture’s power reaches, then all heavens descend, myriad gods arrive. One’s hundreds of millions of ancestors and outside dark souls suffering and refreshing all obtain salvation, ascending to the Vermilion Palace, instantly riding the scripture’s power to transform and be born. They all receive middle grade salvation and rebirth, becoming nobles. Born noble, not falling low. Having obtained rebirth, their innate talents and spiritual wisdom still rely on refining and cultivation, accumulating merit and virtue before truly attaining the immortal Dao, then ascending the three divine realms. Thus those who love learning the scripture and cultivate diligently, accumulating day by day, merit full and virtue complete, then jade talisman protects spirit, golden fluid refines form; over time form and spirit both marvelously refined, then serve the Golden Gate and Jade Capital.

---

### Highest Students Reciting This Scripture Immediately Receive Salvation, Flying Up to the Southern Palace.

The Supreme One says: The highest students hearing the Dao diligently practice it. Highest students have planted good roots in past lives; their cultivation and recitation never slacken from beginning to end, thus their diligence never ceases, merit and virtue deep and heavy, then birth and salvation, preserving life and root, regardless of rank, directly ascending the Southern Palace. Youlou says: When soul and spirit ascend to immortality, fire refines ghost essence; birth and salvation mean fire refines filth. Thus diligent practitioners whose names are recorded in the immortal register all fly their spirits to the Southern Palace, then ascend to truth; this is not difficult to believe.

### Ordinary People Reciting Gain Longevity and Long Life; Later All Obtain the Way of Corpse Liberation; Soul and Spirit Temporarily Extinguish, Not Passing Through Hell, Immediately Returning to Form, Wandering the Vast Void.

This speaks of ordinary people’s recitation’s efficacy. The common folk, reciting long and silently understanding the scripture’s meaning, can prolong life and extend years. After the body’s passing, they also obtain the way of corpse liberation. Though soul and spirit temporarily extinguish, good causes prevail, so they do not pass through hell’s suffering, immediately return to form in the vast void. The soul and spirit also receive salvation in the Vermilion Palace. This is because of past good roots and blessings. Though human beings can carefully recite, not understanding cultivation’s essence, they only gain examination of lifespan. When heavenly numbers are exhausted, they return to birth and death; the form obtains corpse liberation, spirit does not revolve, not bound by the dark realm or underworld. Their shedding form and casting traces can also return to true nature within yin qi; spirit transcends the void, then wanders the vast void’s realm.

### This Scripture Is Subtle and Marvelous, Universally Saving Without End. All Heavens and Humans Receive Blessings. Infinite Blessings, Life and Death Both Receive Grace.

The foregoing words are supreme and marvelous, deeply praising its subtlety. The Dao Lord earnestly shows compassion; thus there is the power of universal salvation without end. Therefore, those who cultivate earnestly, wherever the scripture’s power reaches, all heavens and humans receive blessings; even ancestral mysterious dark souls all receive salvation. Its infinite blessings cannot be measured. Viewing it as birth and life, having received salvation; and death’s souls also all receive refinement. Thus birth and death both receive the Heavenly Venerable’s grace. Yet the scripture’s subtlety is possessed by all; without cultivating it in the body, verifying the ten turns of refining oneself, how could it universally save without end? If one can comprehend the scripture’s dharma in the heart, attain the subtlety of golden fluid, over time ten turns return spirit, summoning the ten directions, then ancestors and departed souls all receive liberation, also ascending to divine transformation. Is this not grace for life and death?

### Treasured by the Highest Heaven, Not Passed Down to the Mortal World. The Most Devoted Bring Gold Treasures, Swear Heaven, and Transmit. Careless Leakage Brings Disaster to Nine Ancestors, Long Servitude to Ghost Officials.

Observing the Dao Lord’s strict prohibitions, one knows this scripture’s treasure is secret in the Highest Heaven. Xiao Guanfu says: The three caverns’ true scriptures are listed in the Golden Register, secret in the Profound Capital, opened once in ten thousand kalpas. In former kalpas when fate was difficult and the world’s path blocked, the Western Platform’s Turtle Mother requested from the Jade Capital, thus the Jade Dawn Dao Lord entrusted it to the Profound One True Man; the Profound One True Man entrusted it to the Supreme Ultimate Xu True Man; the Supreme Ultimate True Man entrusted it to Master Ge Xian Gong, spreading it in the world. Thus the treasure secret of the Highest Heaven is not for the lower world to know. The most devoted, indeed the highest students, must bring gold treasures, sincerely swear heaven, then transmit. The treasures of Heaven are all inner names and taboos, crimson script and cavernous chapters. The most devoted bring gold treasures to break stinginess, increase preciousness, so they regard the scripture as precious as gold treasure. If one carelessly leaks or is disrespectful, how could it not bring disaster to ancestral mysteries and be tested by ghost officials? The immortal master says: “Careless” means giving to unworthy people; “leakage” means acting without secrecy; “loose” means not guarding firmly; “disrespect” means not reverently honoring. If any one of these four occurs, the body suffers disaster. Ghost officials are heavenly servants driving thunder and commanding lightning, earthly servants carrying sand and stone, water servants stirring waves and tides; these are the officials punishing dead souls.

### The Five Emperors Attend the Scripture, Jade Boys and Jade Girls, Each Twenty-Four, Guarding the Divine Text, Protecting the Body of the Scripture Receiver.

This speaks of the protection of those who cultivate and recite by the Heavenly Emperors and immortal spirits. Shaowei says: The Five Emperors are the Five Elders’ Emperors. The Five Emperors attend the scripture, flying throughout the world’s observatories, commanding one hundred and twenty jade boys and girls, guarding the scripture text, protecting the bodies of those who wear and recite it. Those who cultivate the truth often face obstruction by external demons, easily falling back; thus many slacken midway.

The Dao Lord having spoken of the consequences of leakage and disrespect, sternly warns again, entrusting divine spirits to guard and protect scripture receivers, so as to dispel demons and prevent calamities. The Heavenly Venerable’s compassion is truly thorough. Cultivators should not fail to heed this teaching, believe and uphold it, avoiding the faults of leakage and disrespect.

### Dao Words: In the First Month’s Long Fast, Reciting This Scripture Frees the Departed Souls of Past Generations from Earthly Bonds and Servitude, Delivering Them to the Upper Southern Palace. In the Seventh Month’s Long Fast, Reciting This Scripture the Body Gains Immortality; the Heavenly Registers Record Names in Yellow and White Scrolls, Removing Death and Granting Life. In the Tenth Month’s Long Fast, Reciting This Scripture Blesses Kings, Emperors, Lords, Ministers, Fathers, and Sons, Securing the Nation’s Mandate, Preserving Heaven’s Longevity. Generation after Generation Unbroken, Long Reigning as Human Sovereigns. Securing Their Domain, the People Praise Great Peace.

This speaks of the student’s duty to cultivate and recite on the Three Origins, Eight Festivals, and Birthdays. The first month’s Upper Origin is the great celebration month, the head of the four beginnings, building Yin, the ghost path; thus one should recite to save the departed souls of past generations, severing the earth officials’ bonds and the ghost officials’ servitude, delivering them to the Southern Palace. The seventh month’s Middle Origin is the great celebration month, building Shen, the human path; thus one should recite to save oneself, the heavens record names, ascending and descending death, names inscribed on yellow and white scrolls. Shaowei says: This is the record of immortals’ register. The tenth month’s Lower Origin, great celebration month, building Hai, the heavenly gate; thus one should recite to bless kings, emperors, lords, ministers, fathers, and sons, securing the nation’s land, extending its mandate, reigning generation after generation, securing all directions, no disease or harm, people all praise the great peace. The Three Origins govern the Three Palaces, Nine Offices, and One Hundred and Twenty Departments, examining and recording sins and merits, all under their jurisdiction. Thus first for the nation’s mandate, next for ancestors, next for oneself, all should long fast and recite scripture in these months, praying for blessings and salvation; surely Heaven and Earth receive celebration, life and death receive grace, gaining infinite blessings.

### On the Eight Festivals’ Days, Reciting This Scripture Gains the Status of the Nine Palaces’ Perfected. On One’s Birthday, Reciting This Scripture Purifies Soul and Spirit, All Qi Endures, No Suffering or Distress, the Body Has Brightness. The Three Realms Guard and Serve, the Five Emperors Escort, Myriad Gods Pay Homage, Names Recorded in Heaven, Merit Full and Virtue Complete, Flying Up to the Upper Clear.

The Eight Festivals’ days mark the four beginnings of the four seasons, the two divisions and two solstices mark yin and yang’s meeting. Thus the Three Realms’ examination of sins and merits depends on the immortal scripture. It says: The Primordial Heavenly Venerable on these days dispatches heavenly emperors, heavenly lords, heavenly gods, true immortals, and divine armies to teach and transform the human world, opening salvation for all beings. The Northern Dipper, Southern Register, Four Officers, and Five Emperors also descend, recording sins and merits. The flow of qi changes on these days, moving, crawling, flying, sinking, responding to conditions, changing old to new, light to heavy, heavy to light, good and evil switching, the qi’s movement naturally. Highest students should on these days keep sincerity and pray and thank, following changes and transformations, entering right and expelling evil, refining false into true, opening salvation for all beings, generating myriad convergences. Thus they should recite and hold with respect, striving to practice good and remove evil, advance goodness and screen out evil, pursue light and abandon darkness, resolve to seek truth, accumulate true功, and practice externally; then surely no punishment or reward will come. The Eight Festivals correspond to the Eight Trigrams and Nine Palaces, thus reciting scripture on the Eight Festivals gains the status of the Nine Palaces’ perfected. One’s birthday is the six solar terms’ six descents each year. The three souls dwell in the liver, belonging to wood, number three, thus called three souls. The seven spirits dwell in the lungs, belonging to metal, number seven, thus called seven spirits. One’s three souls: one soul dwells in the direct original mansion, one soul dwells in the underworld, one soul dwells within the form. The seven spirits always leave but do not scatter. On one’s birthday, soul and spirit descend into the body and join the cycle, returning without end; then life is stable, no disaster or illness arises. If on that day the body and heart are pure and clean, abstaining from wine and lust, wearing new and clean clothes, burning incense and practicing goodness, sleeping briefly, then soul and spirit unite, yin and yang balance, dao qi rises, life root is firm. If addicted to wine and lust, confused and disordered in form, then when soul returns, it leaves the body three steps away, cannot unite; impure qi fills the body; soul returns again, three times confused and disordered. If not united with spirit, yang declines and yin rises, soul communicates with yin ghosts, causing sleepwalking and many evils, indulging in sleep and confusion, disasters and illnesses all arise. If one can cultivate fasting and recite scripture on one’s birthday, then the above responses occur, merit full and virtue complete, the Three Realms guard and serve, the Five Emperors escort, then promotion and elevation occur. Qingyuan says: If one does all evil, the soul is angry and spirit leaves the body, knowing it enters the evil path. If one does all good, the soul rejoices and myriad gods gather, knowing it enters the right path. Cultivators should not be careless.

### Dao Words: On the Day of Practicing the Dao, One Should Bathe in Fragrant Water, Fast, Enter the Room, Face East, Knock Teeth Thirty-Two Times, Hear the Thirty-Two Heavens, Bow to Thirty-Two Passages. Close Eyes and Meditate, Sitting Amidst the Blue, Yellow, and White Clouds of Qi, Inside and Outside Dense and Dark, With Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Black Tortoise, Lion, and White Crane Arrayed Left and Right, Sun and Moon Illuminating, Chamber Bright and Clear, Top Bearing a Round Image, Light Reflecting the Ten Directions, All Clearly Visible.

On the day of reciting the scripture, first put on clothes and wash, purify the heart and cleanse thoughts, enter the room facing east, sit properly, recite with focused mind and measured voice, striving for spirit and soul’s harmony, qi steady and breath regulated; then knock teeth to gather spirit inside and penetrate heavenly heart outside. Bow to the thirty-two heavens, close eyes and meditate deeply, sitting amid the profound primordial three qi. Inside and outside illuminate clearly; liver’s blue qi emerges from the eyes, transforming into the Azure Dragon on the left; lung’s white qi emerges from the nose, transforming into the White Tiger on the right; heart’s red qi emerges from the mouth, transforming into the Vermilion Bird in front; kidney’s black qi emerges from the ears, transforming into the Black Tortoise behind; all arrayed left and right. Left eye aligns with the sun, right eye with the moon; the sun and moon’s light brightens the chamber. The nape bears a diagram of nine colors hanging rays, light spreading above the ten directions.

---

### Secret Incantation:

“Secret” means low voice; “incantation” means blessing. Mo’an says: From the following text *No Supreme Profound Origin* to the segment before *Supreme Almost*, these are low-voiced prayers and blessings, no need to separately recite incantations. The Gan Luo Yu Luo are later additions, not to be recited. Also, do not recite too fast; if greedy for many recitations, qi becomes turbid and voice noisy, turning into disrespect.

### The Supreme Profound Origin Supreme Dao Lord Summons the Three and Five Merit Officers Within the Body, Left and Right Officials, Incense Attendants, Jade Boys and Girls, Five Emperors’ Direct Talismans, Day Incense Officials, Thirty-Two Each, to Come Out, Open the Gates, Announcing: Today Is Auspicious, Long Fast in Pure Hall, Cultivating Practice to the Scripture, Infinite Salvation of Beings. I and the A and B Turn Scriptures Receive Life, Wish the Above to Be Fully Open, Directly Approaching the Supreme Thirty-Two Heavens’ Primordial Highest Emperor’s Supreme Throne.

Then, Qi Is Drawn Thirty-Two Passages, Reciting the Scripture Facing East.

The Supreme Profound Origin is the general name of the three realms. Reciting and holding the scripture should first summon the Primordial, thus opening the Dao Lord, residing in one’s own body’s head mud pellet palace. The three and five merit officers and other gods within the body appear, arrayed left and right, front and back, each one going to a heaven, thirty-two each, all opening gates and announcing the matter, silently reporting their positions, proceeding according to the prayer’s intent, sincerely stating the matter. Today is auspicious and a long fast. If not fasting, only say holding fast. Pure hall cultivating practice to the scripture, if not understanding the three caverns’ covenant dao, ordinarily not practicing, then only say pure hall reciting scripture. Infinite salvation of beings is the ten directions’ hidden and manifest words; or for one matter, then only say reciting scripture for such matter. I and A and B do not speak for self or others. I directly approach the supreme thirty-two heavens’ Primordial Highest Emperor’s supreme throne, that is the thirty-two heavenly emperors and the Primordial Emperor’s throne. Drawing qi thirty-two passages means drawing one qi each day. Facing east means the beginning of generating qi. Inside and outside the three qi illuminate clearly, reciting according to the law.

### The Supreme Scripture of the Primordial Infinite Salvation of Beings

This is the title of the proper scripture. The proper scripture is spoken by the Primordial, hence only titled *The Supreme Scripture of the Primordial Infinite Salvation of Beings*. This is the Dao Lord’s marking of the scripture’s head. “Primordial” clarifies this scripture is spoken by the Primordial Heavenly Venerable. “Infinite Salvation of Beings” summarizes the scripture’s main intent. This scripture ranks first among grades, hence called supreme marvelous scripture.

---

### The Primordial Profound, Spiritual Treasure’s Original Chapter

The Primordial is the origin of one qi, the beginning of myriad transformations; this is the title of the Void Sovereign Heavenly Venerable’s incarnation. This chapter is headed with “Primordial” to clarify all words are those of the Primordial Heavenly Venerable. “Profound” is one of the three caverns, a scripture grade name. “Spiritual Treasure” is the Dao Lord’s title. The Dao Lord’s name is Jingbao, since all scriptures are spoken by the Dao Lord. Dao treasure, scripture treasure, master treasure—all before Heaven and Earth, all born from the three Brahman primordial qi; thus this scripture is also formed from Brahman clear, bright, and pure three qi, forming cloud script heavenly chapters, then the Heavenly True Emperor writes the scripture text. The Primordial dwells in the empty cavern’s profound mystery, speaking this scripture, the root of the Spiritual Treasure scriptures, foremost among scriptures, hence called the original chapter. Cultivating within is the golden fluid great Elixir’s alternate name. Condensing spirit is spirit; gathering qi is treasure; thus the root dust penetrates my primordial spirit, enduring ancient and modern without decay, the root of the primordial true unity.

### Supreme Marvelous Head, Ten Times Saving Beings, Hundred Demons’ Hidden Rhymes, Separation and Union Natural.

Mo’an says: This is the small preface of the proper scripture. Supreme marvelous head, the highest scripture grade, the head of all marvels. Ten times saving beings, ten is the number of Five Phases’ generation; all things possess this principle. To save beings and ghosts, one must circle ten times, ending and beginning anew, then ten turns return spirit. Hundred demons’ virtue and rhyme: Shaowei says: “Demon” is not the demon or ghost demon. Like the Five Emperors’ great demons, the Southern Pole’s Longevity Salvation Sima and other gods. Thus in the Spiritual Treasure spells, True Kings, Vermilion Mound, Azure Splendor are all ranked with the Five Heavenly Great Demons. Hidden rhyme means hidden names and taboos. Separation and union natural means with the hidden rhyme’s sound, one separates and one unites, naturally and without fixed trace. Since the primordial one qi transforms myriad convergences, one root with myriad differences is union; myriad differences with one root is separation; endless cycles, infinite circulation, one cannot glimpse the maker’s trace. Alchemy uses ten months for embryo completion then divine transformation, in accord with Heaven and Earth’s path and mechanism, all use ten as the full number. The difficulty in cultivation is the body’s six roots and eight consciousnesses, three souls and seven spirits, three parts and eight scenes’ gods, moving as demon tests, confusing the heart lord, their separation and union in turmoil, unable to rest. Knowing the ten turns’ work, then hundred demons are subdued, returning to nature.

### Mixed Cavern Crimson Script, No Supreme True, Primordial Ancestral Kalpa, Transforming and Giving Birth to the Heavens, Opening the Three Scenes, This Is the Heavenly Root. Above There Is No Further Ancestor, Only Dao Is the Body.

Shaowei says: “Nature” before this is the Dao Lord’s small preface; after “Mixed Cavern” is the Heavenly Venerable’s original chapter. “Mixed” means undifferentiated; “Cavern” means empty and without form. It is the primordial chaos before division, one qi embryo mixed in the empty cavern. Crimson script: The *Crimson Book True Text Scripture* says: cavern yang qi is red, thus called crimson script. All are pre-Heaven qi, utmost yang essence, manifesting images. The Five Elders’ Emperors say: The Primordial Profound Spiritual Treasure Crimson Book was born before the Primordial, in the empty cavern, dark and deep, no ancestor or clan, qi condensed floating in the void, responding to the opportunity. “No supreme true” means one qi arising from the beginning of great nothingness. The scripture says: “No no also no,” meaning no supreme is the highest, truth within the truest, the so-called pre-Heaven birth. Ancestor means ancestral qi. Kalpa means one cycle of Heaven and Earth’s formation and destruction; ancestral kalpa is the beginning of Heaven and Earth’s world, not yet corrupted. The profound primordial qi is the ancestor of all things; myriad heavens are born from ancestral qi. The scripture says: “Dao is the mother of all things.” Xiao Guanfu says: From one qi arises three realms; from three realms arise nine heavens; below each are three heavens, totaling thirty-six heavens. Below are four kinds of mortal heavens; then divided into Three Realms and Twenty-Eight Heavens; then eight Brahma heavens; up to five hundred million heavens, all rooted in ancestral qi. Opening the three scenes: the three realms are Qingwei, Yu Yu, and Great Crimson three heavens. The three scenes also mean sun, moon, and star three lights. Heaven, Earth, and Man are three poles, three talents, three realms. The Supreme One says: Dao produces one, that is one qi. One produces two, that is the two forms. Three produces myriad things, that is the three scenes. The three qi unite to produce nine qi; the three qi are Heaven and Earth’s root, myriad things’ root, all born from ancestral kalpa’s transformation, then opening Heaven and Earth, giving birth; this is the heavenly root. Above there is no further ancestor; only Dao is the body. Dao uses emptiness and nothingness as root, not to be sought by image; this is a strong name, thus no form, no name, no sound, no smell, encompassing Heaven and Earth, containing the cosmos. Above it has no ancestor; it is Dao. Confucians call it the Supreme Ultimate; Buddhists call it True Void; Dao calls it Supreme Emptiness; their principle is one. Cultivators gather ancestral qi from pre-Heaven’s beginning, forming the Golden Mother, circulating six voids, all two qi intertwined, opening and closing without ceasing. Over time, pursuing two qi on the yellow path, meeting three natures in the origin palace, then the subtlety of two and five’s essence combines and condenses, endlessly generating, forming the Dharma body, that is the primordial heavenly root.

### Five Writings Open Wide, Universally Planting Spirits. No Writing Without Light, No Writing Without Clarity, No Writing Without Establishment, No Writing Without Completion, No Writing Without Salvation, No Writing Without Birth. This Is the Heaven Among the Great Brahma Heavens.

The five writings are the five true writings, the five chapters of spreading and unfolding. They give birth to heaven and establish earth; flying, diving, moving, and growing; all things with form and qi are born and transformed by them. Since yin and yang separated and divided, their writings opened wide, universally planting myriad kinds. The five writings in heaven are the five stars; on earth, the five great mountains; in man, the Five Phases; in things, the five qi. The greatest and smallest things are all contained within. Without one writing, there is no light or clarity, no establishment or completion, no salvation or birth; Heaven and Earth’s myriad things have no mechanism for transformation. The human body is a small cosmos, its spirit among myriad things. The pre-Heaven one qi is the Elixir base; the Five Phases array in the cauldron; metal and wood combined, water and fire meeting, two earths forming a jade tablet, inverted within after yin and yang are balanced. When feelings return to nature, mercury is cast into lead, medicine obtains fire then sand produces silver; all are rooted in the Golden Mother, flowing Wu meeting Yi, seeing earth and forming the Elixir. When the Elixir completes, its spirit and numinous transformations are unfathomable, all the Five Phases together. Its brightness is like the sun and moon; its establishment like Heaven and Earth’s establishment; the one who can save and give birth is the Primordial. This is the heaven among the Great Brahma Heavens, concluding the previous scripture text’s intent. Great Brahma is the great moving Brahman qi. Heaven among heavens, among the thirty-two heavens, all are Brahman qi flowing endlessly, like the body’s one qi circulating, all heavenly mandates flowing, hundred vessels and nine apertures, nowhere not returning, this is Brahman qi’s universal spread.

### The Yulu Platform, Jade Mountain Upper Capital, Supreme and Unmatched, Great Luo Jade Clarity, Vast and Boundless as Kalpas, Seeming to Vanish and Seemingly Present.

Above the Great Luo Heaven is Jade Capital Mountain, with jade as the capital, hence called Jade Mountain Upper Capital. The Yulu Platform is above the Jade Capital, reaching the utmost height, supreme above the supreme. This is the Great Luo Heaven. Jade Clarity Golden Gate dwells within; its vastness is boundless, encompassing myriad worlds, thus vast as kalpas, impossible to exhaust. Brahman qi condenses the void, originally not to be sought by form or image; thus seeming to vanish and seemingly present. Heaven and Earth form and decay; one kalpa is one cycle. The Great Luo realm is foreshadowed before countless kalpas, enduring kalpas without destruction. Ren is immeasurable, not to be measured. Its vastness and dimness are one with Supreme Emptiness, no form, no name, not to be sought by trace. The Yulu Platform in the body is the brain’s edge; Jade Mountain Upper Capital is the mud pellet. The mud pellet is the heavenly gate, the palace of myriad gods; this is the Great Luo’s image, Jade Clarity dwells within, vast as kalpas, seeming to vanish and seemingly present. One’s true nature is vast and without trace, dim and vague within, enduring kalpas to last long, called the indestructible primordial spirit, thus dwelling above the Three Realms.

### Three Blossoms Separate Conveniently, Great Marvelous Court, Golden Gate Jade Chamber, Arrayed and Pure, Great Moving Brahman Qi, Circling Ten Directions.

Youqi says: The Three Blossoms are the Jade Clarity’s three origin palaces. Upper Origin Jade Blossom, Middle Origin Golden Blossom, Lower Origin Nine Blossoms. The Three Origins’ Supreme Emperor Dao Lords dwell there, the Jade Clarity’s separated palace convenient hall. Great Marvelous is the High Supreme Great Marvelous Jade Clarity Palace’s Heavenly Venerable’s seat, hence called Marvelous Court. The three are the southern fire number, belonging to Li, that is the mud pellet brain edge. Golden Gate Jade Chamber is the Yellow Court Crimson Palace. Arrayed are the stars of the celestial sphere. Pure Pool is the two pools’ clarity, that is the body’s Kan and Li. Great Moving Brahman Qi circling ten directions is the Great Luo Jade Clarity’s image, Brahman qi flowing, spreading through the ten directions’ infinite realm, all convergences moistened, Primordial One Qi transforming infinitely. The alchemical scripture says: The three palaces mix, meeting three natures in the origin palace. The body’s spirit, qi, and essence are the three blossoms. The primordial spirit dwells in the spirit platform, that is the Great Marvelous Court. Our golden tower and jade chamber are Heaven’s Golden Gate Jade Chamber. The Five Stars and constellations shine brilliantly in the pure pool’s water, that is the celestial sphere’s fire seasons, constellations and myriad stars, circling within Kan and Li, water and fire rising and falling. When the Qian Kun cauldron is balanced, the nine returns of the golden fluid’s way are completed. The pre-Heaven true unity’s qi cycles day and night, revolving and repeating, all receiving Kan’s Wu month essence and Li’s Yi day light, the talisman fire advancing and retreating, intermingling and warming, forming the metal embryo. Circling through the sixty-four hexagrams’ completion, then all vessels return to origin, nine apertures illuminate clearly—is this not Brahman qi’s circulation, ten directions all reached, all images of the pure pool?

### Ten Directions’ Supreme True Flying Heavenly Kings, Longevity World-Saving Infinite Great Gods, All Ride Flying Clouds; Red Chariots and Green Carriages, Feathered Canopies and Jade Wheels, Driving Red Phoenixes, Five-Color Mysterious Dragons, Establishing Nine-Color Festivals, Ten Supreme Spirit Banners. Before, Nine Phoenixes Cry in Unison, Behind, Eight Luan Birds Sing Together, Lions and White Cranes, Crying and Singing Harmoniously.

This summarizes the previous ten directions’ flying heavenly kings and infinite great gods, all heavenly supreme truths. Qingyuan says: Chariots, carriages, wheels, and canopies are all formed from yang essence qi; phoenixes, dragons, lions, and cranes are all formed from yin essence qi. The Highest Sage possesses the true constant Dao; breath and absorption harmonize, appearing as desired. Yin and yang qi harmonize, forming songs and melodies, all by qi, not external things. When alchemical work succeeds, yin demons also transform; yang spirits and primordial qi call once, myriad gods all listen; five viscera spirits each appear in their direction’s color. Chariots, banners, and guards come to welcome the hundred bones; myriad gods lead front and follow behind, ascending and paying homage to the origin, no different from meeting the heavenly true great saints.

### The Five Elders Lead the Way, Immortal Crowds Escort the Chariot, Hundreds of Millions of Carriages and Horses, Floating in the Air Arrive. Light Inclines and Carriages Turn, Supervising True Salvation.

The Ten Directions’ Great Saints, with exalted Dao rank, are moved by the Five Emperors’ lead; immortal crowds ride chariots and horses, floating in the air arriving. The Five Elders are: Eastern Azure Spirit Senior, surname Guan, named Kai, styled Lingwei Yang; Southern Dan Spirit True Elder, surname Dongfu, named Jiyan, styled Chi Bo Nu; Central Primordial Spirit Senior, surname Tongban, named Yuanshi, styled Han Shuniu; Western Bright Spirit Emperor Elder, surname Shangjin, named Changkai, styled Yao Po Bao; Northern Five Spirits Mysterious Elder, surname Heijie, named Linghui, styled Yin Hou Ju. The Five Emperors are natural gods of heavenly truth, formed by ancestral qi’s marvelous transformation into the Five Phases, the five qi. Thus called Primordial Five Elders, not those who become true by accumulated learning, but those who receive commands and descend with talismans, each guarding a direction; at great kalpas’ turning, their positions change. Thus East belongs to wood, governing spring, commanding all things to grow; South belongs to fire, governing summer, commanding all things to flourish; Center belongs to earth, flourishing in all seasons, harmonizing all things; West belongs to metal, governing autumn, commanding all things to complete; North belongs to water, governing winter, commanding all things to store. This is the orderly distribution of the five qi. The Five Phases are the Dharma body’s true qi; fire dragon and water tiger invert and flow within the cauldron. Myriad gods cluster in the nine palaces; then the five qi face the origin, myriad spirits guard the body, like thousands of carriages and ten thousand horses floating in the air arriving. Light inclines are flowing essence and jade light. Turning carriages are flying clouds and red skies. The Ten Directions’ Great Saints pay homage to the emperor; wheels spin, the Heavenly Venerable’s Dharma seat supervises and leads all true ones, examining and saving myriad beings. Internally, one’s true light turns, illuminating the spiritual mansion; then Kan and Li are balanced, lead and mercury meet, spirit does not stray, all reins rest. Then yang light inclines downward, yin dregs rise upward; true spirit transforms and gives birth, naturally able to supervise true salvation, circling the ten directions.

The heavenly recorders strictly examine according to merit and grade; according to high or low, they receive promotion and salvation.

### Universally Creating the Three Realms, Infinite Divine Village, Spring and Autumn Mansion, Northern Capital Luo Feng, Three Officials’ Nine Offices, Twelve River Sources.

The Three Realms are Desire Realm, Form Realm, and Formless Realm. Infinite Divine Village is the ten directions’ infinite world. Spring and Autumn Mansion is the Nine Nether’s long night mansion. Northern Capital Luo Feng is a great sea in the lower origin’s true north, foul and evil, boundless in extent; in the middle is a mountain reaching the Blue Firmament above and the Wind Spring below, all dark qi coiled and formed, called Northern Capital Luo Feng Mountain. There is a great cavern called Yin Scene Heavenly Palace. Within are thirty-six prisons, governed by the Taiyin Heavenly Lord. Inside are six caverns, six great demon kings, each governing one office. One is called Zhou Jue Yin Heavenly Palace; two, Tai Sha Liang Shi Zong Heavenly Palace; three, Ming Chen Nai Fan Wu Cheng Heavenly Palace; four, Tian Zhao Zui Qi Heavenly Palace; five, Zong Ling Qi Fei Heavenly Palace; six, Gan Si Lian Wan Lu Heavenly Palace. Those who can hold the names of these six caverns with constant reverence and awe, the demon kings recommend, erasing sin names, receiving life and death’s reliance, gaining infinite blessings. The Three Officials’ Nine Offices are the Heavenly, Earthly, and Water Officials governing the Three Origins’ examination and recording offices. The Upper Origin’s Heavenly Official belongs to Jade Clarity realm, setting three palaces, nine offices, thirty-six departments; the Middle Origin’s Earthly Official belongs to Upper Clarity realm, setting three palaces, nine offices, forty-two departments; the Lower Origin’s Water Official belongs to Supreme Clarity realm, setting three palaces, nine offices, forty-two departments. Among these, the Middle and Lower Origin officials are souls with merits after death, receiving salvation and appointment, advancing to heavenly offices when merit is full; if merit is not full, returning to human life. The Nine Offices are also called the Nine Fortresses of Earth Sovereign and Nine Commanders’ offices. The Twelve River Sources: the moon is Taiyin’s essence, mother of all waters; the Eastern Well is the heavenly river’s source, where all waters meet. Taiyin’s one month is one celestial cycle; thus the twelve months all pass the Eastern Well, watering the yellow flower’s sweet dew to wash and refine dead souls, also relying on this to cleanse form, then deliver to the Southern Palace. The human body’s heart is the Southern Prosperous, that is Vermilion Mound Mansion. The scripture says: Spiritual Treasure’s infinite light, illuminating the fiery pond’s vexation. When the heart is empty, spirit light illuminates. Below the kidney are all the dark yin Spring and Autumn Mansions, that is Northern Capital Luo Feng. With our true light bright and clear, illuminating darkness, moving Taiyin’s true water at the Eastern Well to cleanse dark souls, then saving with the sun’s Southern Li true fire to destroy and refine. Though the infinite divine village’s souls and spirits, all are universally informed and saved.

### Ancestors Are Released, Hundreds of Millions of Generations of Parents, Illnesses Removed, Sin Registers Erased, Evil Roots Destroyed, No Longer Detained, No Longer Forced to Join Ghost Groups.

One’s ancestors, if descendants cannot cultivate goodness and accumulate virtue, surely disaster befalls nine ancestors, all fall and sink, no escape. Those who know to cultivate and honor scripture and teaching, transfer goodness and distribute blessings, then the ancestors’ sin formation is released, and distant generations also obtain salvation. Guanfu says: Each time the Three Officials examine and record, if descendants have great merit, the Jade Emperor commands immediate salvation of nine mysterious seven ancestors. One’s body is saved, then nine ancestors receive grace. Thus illnesses are removed from sin registers, evil roots also fall away. Evil roots mean evil thought root nature. Sin registers are records of the underworld, light and heavy sin registers. Receiving mercy and salvation, greatly forgiving their karma, evil roots vanish, names and registers removed; even the underworld cannot detain them, forcing them to join ghost groups. All hundreds of millions of generations of parents universally receive salvation. Those who know cultivation do not let vanity disturb them, nor desires confuse; nature is clear, fully penetrating and marvelous; then the three corpses and six thieves cannot muddy and pollute. Cultivating long, myriad qi face the birth gate, hundred gods guard the death gate, not sinking into suffering, hundreds of millions of ancestors all ascend.

### Primordial Talisman Orders, Timely Ascension and Promotion. Northern Capital Cold Pool, Guarding Form and Soul, Controlling Demons and Recommending, Saving to Southern Palace. Dead Souls Receive Refinement, Immortal Transformation into Human. Living Body Receives Salvation, Kalpa after Kalpa Lasting. Following Kalpa Rotation, Equal to Heaven’s Years, Eternally Saving the Three Paths, the Five Sufferings and Eight Hardships, Transcending the Three Realms, Free and Easy in Upper Clear.

Shaowei says: This means students’ ancestors receive refinement, their own bodies receive salvation. Primordial talisman orders are like the Spiritual Treasure Dharma’s “Birth Heaven Treasure Talisman,” “Nine Dragons Saving Suffering Talisman Orders,” true talismans and slips, all decreed by the Primordial Heavenly Venerable, issued to the Nine Heavens’ Nine Offices, decreeing the Three Realms and Ten Directions to act. Thus timely ascension and promotion. Northern Capital Cold Pool is Luo Feng Spring and Autumn Mansion. Guarding form and soul means when a person dies, the form separates and soul scatters; the Northern Emperor receives orders to guard the dead soul, preventing scattering. Controlling and commanding demon kings to recommend, then saving to the Vermilion Southern Palace. Dead souls receive refinement, dwelling in the dark extreme yin mansion, receiving the Heavenly Venerable’s compassionate light, one candle of true yang, refined within, darkness sees light, yin pure and yang clear, immortal transforming into human. Those who cultivate scripture and teaching, purify and refine form and spirit, then living body receives salvation, kalpa after kalpa not losing human body, true nature enduring. Following kalpa rotation, equal to Heaven’s years means kalpa numbers end with destruction; those limited to form and qi have rotation; only those who attain immortality, one spirit and marvel, endure kalpas without destruction, lasting as long as Heaven and Earth. Eternally saving the three paths, five sufferings, and eight hardships: the three paths are the first desire path, upper corpse path, heavenly realm; second love desire path, middle corpse path, human realm; third greed desire path, lower corpse path, earthly realm; also called three evils, hindering people’s cultivation of immortality. The five sufferings are form
