## Scroll One of the Scripture of the Primordial Five Elders’ Scarlet Writ Jade Chapters, True Text of the Celestial Scripture

To the East dwells the Treasure-Stabilizing Azure Forest’s Blue Spirit Primordial Elder, titled the *Chapter of the True Cavernous Profound Treasure of the Spirit of Life*.  
To the South reigns the Brahma Treasure Flourishing Sun’s Dan Spirit True Elder, titled the *Southern Cloud’s Celestial-Communicating Treasure of the Spirit’s Collar*.  
At the Center stands the Jade Treasure Primordial Spirit Elder, titled the *Treasure Kalpa’s Cavernous Clarity Nine Heavens Spirit Scripture*.  
To the West rules the Seven Treasures Golden Gate Bright Spirit Sovereign Elder, titled the *Golden True Treasure Radiance Cavernous Subtle Chapters*.  
To the North abides the Cavernous Yin Shuo Dan Yu Supreme Five Spirits Mysterious Elder, titled the *Primordial Spirit Life True Treasure Radiant Text*.

The Five Elders’ Jade Chapters are all scriptures born of the empty cavern of Nature itself, secreted within the Nine Heavens’ Numinous Capital, the Purple Tenuity Palace’s Seven Treasures Mysterious Terrace, guarded by the divine officials of the Five Emperors, emerging once every forty thousand kalpas according to the profound methods.

The *Primordial Cavernous Numinous Treasure Scarlet Writ Jade Chapters True Text* was born before the Primordial, within the empty cavern. Heaven and Earth had no root, sun and moon no light; all was dim and obscure, without ancestor or lineage. The numinous script was dense and misty, appearing and vanishing suddenly. The Two Instruments awaited division, the Great Sun awaited illumination. The numinous chart shifted its course, the mysterious phenomena moved onward, seizing the opportunity to respond and thus it came to be. Heaven and Earth took it and divided; the Three Luminaries took it and shone forth. The numinous script flourished and blossomed, reflecting the Supreme Clarity, issuing from the sky of primal blue, its hues without fixed direction. The script’s force twisted and turned, impossible to trace in detail.

Primordial refined it in the Cavernous Yang Pavilion, smelted it in the Flowing Fire Court; its true text fresh and bright, radiating light and brilliance; the Cavernous Yang qi was red, hence named the Scarlet Writ. The numinous chart thus illuminated, ten thousand emperors bowed to the truth, soaring through empty space, circling the Upper Palace, burning incense and scattering blossoms, chanting the numinous chapters aloud. At that time Heaven sent down twelve mysterious auspices, Earth produced twenty-four responses; above, celebrating the Nine Heavens’ numinous mysteries; below, praising the Three Heavens’ treasured texts. The divine winds stirred, the august Way flourished; Primordial ascended to issue commands, the Most True took up the brush, the Jade Consort swept the mat; casting gold into slips, carving the scripture’s jade chapters. The Five Elders took charge of the records, secreted in the Nine Heavens’ Numinous Capital Palace. The Jade Maidens tended incense, the Great Flower held the banner, Jade Youths guarded the sides, the Jade Steps faced the pavilion; the Nine Heavens’ upper scriptures were unheard of by ghosts or gods. Heaven’s treasure brought forth floating grace, Earth’s secret brought forth peace; the Five Emperors held it to gain stability; the Three Luminaries rode it to reach brilliance; the Supreme Sages revered it to attain truth; the Five Mountains followed it to gain numinosity; the Son of Heaven obtained it to bring governance; the nation’s fate enjoyed it to bring great peace.

Indeed, the wondrous virtue of the numinous script is the mysterious root of Heaven and Earth. Its majestic potency vast and boundless, universally extending without end; the great transformation rolls on, the ancestor of divine radiance. Its measure is beyond reckoning, towering in the great void.

The *Primordial Five Elders’ Scarlet Writ Jade Chapters* emerge from the empty cavern of Nature, giving birth to Heaven, establishing Earth, opening and transforming the divine radiance. Above it is called Spirit, bestowing stability on the Five Mountains, securing the nation’s enduring existence; below it is called Treasure, the numinous treasure’s profound mystery, the reverence of all things. Primordial opened the chart, above revealing twelve numinous auspices, below issuing twenty-four responses.

One: At that time there was no Heaven nor Earth, all was dim and obscure; the numinous script was dense and misty, without ancestor or lineage; the movement came forth spontaneously, the root of all qi; the empty cavern formed the true, the qi was clear, lofty, and pure, forming Heaven’s vast covering, suddenly emerging from the mysterious.

Two: At that time the Two Phenomena divided the Instruments, qi flowed downward and condensed, opening and expanding to bear weight; all at once forms took shape.

Three: At that time thirty-six thousand sun and moon and one time shone together, illuminating all heavens, penetrating all darkness.

Four: At that time the Supreme Sage Great God, the Wonderful Walking True Person, countless in number, attended the Jade Court, circling the Great Void, praising and reciting the numinous script.

Five: Heaven sent forth natural music and dance, millions of kinds simultaneously performed, stirring the cloud palaces, celebrating the divine truth.

Six: The numinous winds chanted a hundred songs, arising from the empty to the Ten Directions, officials and merchants harmonized, all forming cavernous chapters.

Seven: The celestial pivot stopped its gates, stars and constellations ceased movement, Heaven had no day or night, the four seasons dawned together.

Eight: Purple clouds emitted radiance, flowing and sprinkling through the heavens; all things universally received the light.

Nine: Spring, autumn, winter, and summer, neither heat nor frost; the four qi gentle and harmonious, withered things all revived.

Ten: The Five Towns stood firm, talismanic charts and scriptures simultaneously unfolded, manifesting the profound void, universally teaching without end.

Eleven: At that time seven treasures of divine marvels hung suspended, scattered over the earth, nourishing all beings.

Twelve: The seven treasures’ wondrous forest spontaneously produced light, shading and covering the Ten Heavens.

These twelve numinous auspices arose naturally from the empty, the mysterious chart began its movement, manifesting the numinous script.

Earth produced twenty-four responses, above celebrating the divine truth.

One: At that time the heavenly qi was chaotic and dark, no light yet; the morning cock crowed to announce dawn, the four scenes brightened and cleared; Heaven was mysterious, Earth expanded, forming the birth of the Five Phases.

Two: Thirty-six thousand sun and moon shone together above and below, illuminating the endless dark night.

Three: The Blue Bird carried the scripture to inform the Five Emperors, correcting Heaven’s divisions and measures.

Four: The White Tiger spat gold, stabilizing the Five Spirits.

Five: The Azure Dragon bore the talisman to inform the Water Emperor, regulating meetings and urging movement, opening rivers and seas.

Six: The Jade Dragon carried the imperial seal to present to the emperor, securing the nation and preserving its fate, the Five Towns enduring.

Seven: The Luan cried and the Phoenix sang, flying and calling melodiously.

Eight: Flocks of birds soared and danced, lifting the sky’s edge.

Nine: The Flood Dragon leaped and splashed, stirring the ocean depths.

Ten: The Yellow River’s waters ceased flowing, fish scales intertwined.

Eleven: Sweet dew spontaneously arose, and fragrant herbs poured down abundantly.

Twelve: Winter brought no ice or frost, withered trees flourished.

Thirteen: Forests, trees, and crops blossomed in winter and summer, bearing fruit abundantly without withering.

Fourteen: The four qi harmonized, disasters and epidemics did not occur; Heaven and humans rejoiced, no premature death.

Fifteen: Poisonous stings closed their teeth, no harm was born.

Sixteen: Lions and fierce beasts dwelled peacefully alongside humans.

Seventeen: All men and women of the world, blind, deaf, lame, and sick, suddenly regained form, without injury or illness, all attained health and strength.

Eighteen: The old grew young again, the young did not age; splendid countenance, radiant brilliance.

Nineteen: Birds, beasts, and livestock, whether conceived or born, all received life without harm.

Twenty: Women pregnant throughout the world bore sons.

Twenty-one: Earth’s treasures poured forth, gold and jade dew formed, scattering along roads without concealment.

Twenty-two: Heaven trembled and Earth cracked; dry bones revived; sunken corpses and flying souls all rose as humans; the world sang in joy, celebrating peace.

Twenty-three: Earth produced lotus flowers; Heaven and humans praised; all rejoiced.

Twenty-four: The Five Mountains opened their caves; talismanic scriptures emerged; teaching Heaven and humans; all learners ascended to immortality.

These twenty-four responses above praised the Primordial’s numinous chart, rejoiced in the Five Elders’ enlightenment. The numinous script thus revived, the dao then flourished. Heaven and Earth expanded, the true law prospered, divine winds spread afar, myriad qi rose in abundance. The Five Emperors assisted and supported, driving and guiding the celestial immortals, commanding and directing divine officials, steering yin and yang. They fixed the Three Luminaries at the mysterious root, preserving Heaven and Earth for long existence, guarding the Five Mountains in the numinous pavilion, regulating kalpa movements at the Three Passes, establishing national fate in accord with the chart, guiding the Five Qi to nurture the people, widely spreading the primordial Heaven, universally teaching the Ten Directions, majestic potency vast and broad, no darkness unopened, divine marvels grand and august, difficult to fully express.

At that time the Supreme Sage Most High Dao Lord, the Most High Jade Emperor, and the Ten Directions’ Utmost Truths all rode five-colored jade wheels, jade carriages of lapis lazuli, nine-colored mysterious dragons, ten peerless feathered canopies, and three pure flowing clouds; the great saints of the heavens, the Wonderful Walking True Persons, all rode the blue mist of nine spirits flowing luminous flying cloud jade carriages. Celebrating the four meetings of the firmament, three dawns exhaled fragrance, flying incense gathered in eights, streaming lightning raised signal fires, floral essence drenched the sun; the Three Luminaries united in brightness, divine clouds shone brilliantly, streaming radiance to the utmost void.

Following the Five Emperors’ divine immortals, the thousand true ones of the mulberry forest, lions, white cranes, tigers, leopards, dragons, and qilin. The numinous consorts scattered blossoms, golden youths raised smoke; the Five Ways opened their paths, the Three Realms connected their crossings, wandering the cloud roads, howling commands to the Ten Heavens. Ascending to the Supreme Clarity’s Great Mysterious Jade Capital Cold Spirit Dan Hall, Purple Tenuity Upper Palace, donning celestial treasure feathered robes, proceeding to the Primordial Heavenly Venerable’s Golden Palace below, requesting to receive the *Primordial Numinous Treasure Scarlet Writ Jade Chapters True Text*.

Then the Heavenly Venerable commanded the assembly of true ones into the Great Void’s Golden Terrace Jade Treasure Hall of Nine Radiances. Spirit youths and jade maidens guarded left and right, ninety million strong. Flying dragons and poisonous beasts guarded the eight gates; rushing serpents struck swords, long fangs struck bells; divine tigers howled upward, lions roared downward; qilin danced and phoenixes sang, howling songs resounded. The heavenly balance sounded its banners and canopies, jade voices stirred the cloud court.

The Supreme Sage Five Elders and Most High Dao Lord bowed and spoke:  
“We humbly hear that Primordial reforms the movement, the mysterious phenomena open the chart, the numinous script flourishes, manifesting the five directions. Heaven and Earth ride it to divide and judge, the Three Luminaries follow it to illuminate. This is the great ancestral undertaking; may it be briefly revealed within the numinous treasury.

“I have passed beyond the pre-Heaven, amid the great kalpa, cultivating truth in the Nine Spirits’ mansion, drawing essence from the Five Blossoms’ passes, receiving life within the mysterious womb, glimpsing the sun in the dark soul’s response, ascending the Great Void, striding the long ferry, shining in the Three Assemblies, washing in the upper mystery, flowing radiance in the city of darkness, holding firm the eight circles, honored to receive the office of enlightenment, favored by the mysterious master’s lineage. Reflecting on all beings, mourning the flux of fate, the august Way now smooth, truth also moves mysteriously. My private heart truly wishes to spread clouds over the eight directions, winds scatter orchid groves, cold branches look up hoping for the flourishing of Hua Yang, decayed bones receive the numinous grace’s ferry.

“I do not know if the *Numinous Treasure Five Chapters Jade Text* can be granted for transmission, to teach those who have not yet heard.”

Primordial Heavenly Venerable then concentrated in true distant thought, stroking the high table, commanding the summoning of the Five Emperors, discussing and determining yin and yang, calculating kalpa meetings, relocating river sources, inspecting celestial degrees, selecting seed people, pointing and counting the Great Void, howling clearly the Nine Mysteries, forever no opening to hearsay, thus closing the gate to the path of truth.

The Most High Dao Lord asked repeatedly; Primordial after long time lowered his gaze and sighed:  
“Profound indeed and deep! What you now grasp, is it not far away? This is the Primordial’s mysterious root, the text of empty cavern nature, preserving kalpa movements in Heaven’s mechanism, stabilizing the Five Spirits to establish truth. Now the Three Heavens arrange their movements, the Six Heavens’ dao proceeds; mixed methods open transformation, there must be thirty-six thousand kinds of dao to explain the hearts of those to come. When this method’s operation ends, after the Three Dragons, in the year of Gengzi, mixed qi will all dissipate, and our true dao will proceed.

“Now it may be entrusted to you, to record in the Upper Pavilion, not yet to be practiced in the later world, teaching beginners. The mysterious method has prohibitions; do not transmit casually. You may go to the Numinous Capital Purple Tenuity Upper Palace, observe the heavenly sounds in the golden frame, take the bowing and looking from the divine kings. Then you shall be given complete celestial charts to govern the Primordial’s Heaven.”

Thus the Most High Dao Lord and the assembly of true ones retired to fasting for three months, proceeded to the Numinous Capital Palace, received the bowing and looking charts. Then they knew the celestial truth’s preciousness, difficult to hear lightly; returned and again went to Primordial Heavenly Venerable, consulted on the rites of prohibition, humbly declined beyond merit; the heavenly countenance took pity and discussed; the numinous gates opened wide; the Five Elders Supreme Truth received the command, unfolding the nine radiances and eight colors’ cloud brocade pouch, issuing the *Primordial Scarlet Writ Jade Chapters True Text Numinous Treasure Upper Scripture*, entrusting it to the Most High Dao Lord, the Most High Jade Emperor, the Ten Directions’ Utmost Truths, the great saints of the heavens, and the Wonderful Walking True Persons, to transmit according to the mysterious method, the six heavens’ qi dissipating in forty thousand kalpas, transmitted by law.
