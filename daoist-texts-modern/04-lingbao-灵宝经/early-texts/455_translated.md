## The Sublime Cavernous Profound Numinous Treasure Scarlet Script Jade Secret Marvelous Scripture, Scroll One

At that time, the Primordial Celestial Honored One, the Most High Great Dao Sovereign, the Five Elders Supreme Emperors, and the Great Gods of the Ten Directions gathered at the Upper Pavilion of the Southern Cinnabar Cavern, seated upon a radiant pearl seven-colored jeweled throne. Present were the Five Emperor Great Sages, the Mysterious Harmonious Jade Maiden, and fifty-two thousand five hundred assembled beings paying homage to the seat. Heaven showered fragrant blossoms; divine dragons and celestial musicians performed; countless spirits without number; purple clouds spread in four directions; the three luminaries shone together; Heaven’s origin rejoiced in union; all perfected beings rode in harmony.

At that moment, the diligent scholar Wang Longci attended the seat and requested to receive the Dharma precepts.

The Dao spoke to Longci: “For seven million kalpas, I have devoted myself to cultivating the Numinous Treasure, establishing vows to bestow, upholding precepts and fasting, laboring tirelessly without retreat, cycling through birth and death, enduring humiliation with diligence, severing alien thoughts, embracing emptiness without thought, accumulating profound stillness, and thus becoming the Dao Venerable among all sages. Constantly employing compassionate thought, I desire to broadly save all beings, whether male or female, all who aspire to transcendence, so that all may behold the wondrous methods of the Numinous Treasure. You possess a good heart and have come to return to the Dharma gate. Because in your past lives across ten thousand kalpas you have served the Ultimate Truth, your merit is full and virtue sufficient, causing you to be born into the Dao world and encounter the flourishing Dharma. Now I shall explain to you the ten condensed marvelous scriptures, so that you may rescue and save the peoples of the Ten Directions. Be diligent in your efforts; do not let demonic words prevail.”

The Dao said: “The causes and conditions of birth and death, the revolving wheel of blessings and vows, all depend upon the body. The human body is hard to obtain; the Dao world is hard to meet; scriptures and Dharma are hard to encounter; secret words are hard to hear. Why then do I unfold the profound intent and explain the essential words? Because I feel compassion for the heavenly and human beings of the Ten Directions who take birth but cannot preserve their bodies, who dwell long in suffering and distress, willingly enduring punishment, cycling through the Five Paths without awakening. Therefore, I widely illuminate the Dharma teachings, open the way for the ignorant, so that all heavenly and human beings may enter the supreme, correct, and true gate, universally saving all sentient beings born in this world. Truly, according to past affinities, all perfected beings may be delivered. I have received the Primordial True Texts and ancient scriptures, speaking the scriptures to save the world through ten thousand kalpas, destined to return to the supreme Wanli Heaven. After passing from this world of the Five Turbidities, fate does not reach; whether male or female, they do not see the bright teaching, always dwelling in evil paths, born and living without opportunity, full of worry and distress, suffering many wrongs, self-generated birth and death, revolving through the Five Paths, falling into the Three Paths and Eight Hardships, calamities chasing one another without end. Birth and death separate, with no distinction of noble or lowly—truly a painful heartache. Now I explain these essentials to save those who can be saved. You should sincerely accept my words.”

Thus the secret instructions were noted; Longci bowed his head and humbly received the teaching.

The Dao said: “You who receive the great Numinous Treasure precepts shall rise facing north, bow your head and body to the ground, pay respects to the Ten Directions, face east and humbly listen to the Ten Precepts:

One: The heart shall not harbor evil jealousy, nor give rise to yin thieves; guard the mouth and be cautious of faults; keep thoughts fixed on the Dharma.

Two: Uphold benevolence and do not kill; pity and aid all beings; extend compassion broadly to save all.

Three: Maintain chastity, humility, and righteousness; neither lust nor steal; always practice good thoughts; diminish self to aid others.

Four: Abstain from lust and desire; keep the heart free from recklessness; guard purity and caution; act without blemish.

Five: The mouth shall utter no evil words; speech shall not be ornate or flowery; inward and outward be loyal and upright; avoid verbal faults.

Six: Abstain from alcohol; regulate conduct; harmonize qi and nature; do not harm the spirit; avoid all evils.

Seven: Do not envy others’ superiority; avoid contention for fame; in all matters be modest and yielding; withdraw to save others.

Eight: Do not criticize scriptures or teachings; do not slander sacred texts; personally uphold the Dharma; always act as if before the divine.

Nine: Do not quarrel with words; do not debate the Four Classes; heavenly and human beings will resent; harm to spirit and qi results.

Ten: In all actions and deeds, maintain equality and one heart; harmony among people and spirits; act as is proper.

Cultivate and uphold pure precepts, always conforming to Heaven’s heart. Constantly practice great compassion, wishing to universally save all in this troubled world. Respect the teaching fully; do not be negligent. Better to die maintaining goodness than to live committing evil. By not retreating, you may be delivered from the Five Paths, avoid the Three Evils, be protected by the heavens, revered by myriad spirits, uphold long fasting and precepts, and naturally attain world deliverance.”

The Dao said: “The Numinous Treasure opens the Dharma to save beings; there are twelve ways to be delivered by following it. You should follow them to attain uprightness and ultimately enter Non-action.

One: See the true scriptures issuing the Dharma, opening deliverance for all; then arise the Dao intention, the heart’s vow for future generations, to ascend as a Great Sage.

Two: Constantly practice compassion, wishing all to universally see the Dharma, broadly opening deliverance without obstruction.

Three: Delight in scriptures and teachings, deeply and widely peruse them; with firm and clear will, enlighten the ignorant and dark.

Four: Respect and receive the teacher’s instructions, widely open exhortations, leading into the Dharma gate, distancing from blind paths.

Five: Have faith in the profound mysteries; revere scriptures and secrets; recite morning and evening without weariness.

Six: Do not pursue glory and wealth; sever worldly ties; focus heart and resolve; all endeavors in the Dharma.

Seven: Diligently recite great scriptures; wish all beings well; broadly open bridges; create conditions for future lives.

Eight: Always generate good heart; be neither evil nor false; no envy or harm; no evil or jealousy.

Nine: Wherever born, always meet sacred eras; encounter the Numinous Treasure Dharma teachings without interruption.

Ten: Keep the body pure and precepts firm; cultivate fasting and build merit; broadly save all beings; all attain liberation.

Eleven: Study widely; proclaim scriptures and Dharma; prepare heavenly and human beings; universally open deliverance.

Twelve: Always meet enlightened teachers generation after generation; receive instruction and propagate; save countless beings.

These are the twelve marvelous secrets. Those who practice these good thoughts shall in every generation behold the sacred texts, bind themselves to the Dao, be friends with the heavens, walk alone through the Three Realms without hindrance, long depart the Three Evils, Five Paths, and Eight Hardships. Spirits and numinous beings revere and protect; earth deities guard; gates are pure and solemn; myriad disasters do not touch. All wishes and vows, reading and reciting this scripture, shall be fulfilled.

Good men and good women who wholeheartedly respect and uphold it belong to the Great Sages of the Ten Directions, penetrate the natural, their bodies born of water and fire, transforming form and shadow, flying and ascending to Supreme Clarity. If merit is not yet full, upon scripture extinction they shall be welcomed by the Five Emperors, directly ascending the heavenly palace, bypassing Mount Tai, transforming and giving birth to noble gates, meeting the scripture and Dao, truly attaining world deliverance.”

The Dao told Longci: “Diligently practice and sincerely accept; do not slacken.” Longci bowed and humbly accepted the precepts.

The Dao said: “The true texts and incantations speak of the highest Dharma deliverance; the ancient texts of Wanli are profound and obscure, impossible to seek in detail; later practitioners find them hard to apply. Therefore, the Most High inscribes notes to clarify the knots. The Jade Secret’s true essentials unfold ancient texts, subtle words profound and mysterious, revered by the heavens. Recite the jade chapters; the Ten Directions chant afar; Heaven sets up rites; spirits and demons are subdued; ghosts and monsters perish. Attending the texts are fifty jade boys and fifty jade maidens, who from no past life of ten thousand kalpas may see this jade text of the Great Profound. When fate and meeting coincide, one may become a deity or immortal, blessings extending to nine ancestors, nourishing and flowing to mysterious descendants, all delivered from the Three Evils, Five Paths, and Eight Hardships. This text is honored and wondrous beyond measure.”

## Primordial Five Elders Exorcising Great Kalpa Floods, Summoning Flood Dragons and Water Officials to Deliver Disaster True Text Jade Secret

The Dao said: “At the turning of the great kalpa of Heaven and Earth, floods surge forth, washing away filth and removing evil, leaving none behind. At this time, Heaven and Earth darken and unite; people drift helplessly, no longer knowing good or evil. Only those with the will to study may obtain the Numinous Treasure true texts, the great and small kalpa talismans, and thus ride flying feathers to gaze from high, ascend the Numinous Mountain and float and soar. At this time, spirits and immortals naturally cause flood dragons to open the path, clear water routes to ferry the body, river gods await and escort, no need for ferries or bridges. This is the marvel of the numinous text; it is not confined to the turning of the great kalpa. When encountering such times, apply the text accordingly, facing north knock teeth five times, hold breath for twenty-five breaths.

## The Sublime Cavernous Profound Numinous Treasure Scarlet Script Jade Secret Marvelous Scripture, Scroll One, Complete

*Note: Scarlet Script was originally mistaken as Scarlet Emperor; corrected according to context.*

## The Sublime Cavernous Profound Numinous Treasure Scarlet Script Jade Secret Marvelous Scripture, Scroll Two

The Primordial Supreme Emperor, Numinous Treasure Revered Gods, Great Saints of the Ten Directions, and Marvelous Practicing Perfected Ones annually thrice visit the Southern Emperor’s Cavernous Yang Official, checking the Heavenly Origin, calculating kalpa assemblies, illuminating the Scarlet Script Five Elders’ true texts, sealing and titling jade tablets to entrust to the Five Emperors. The Primordial Five Qi often at cockcrow ascend to meet at the Numinous Treasure Jade Capital Mysterious Metropolis Upper Palace; sunlight begins to brighten, scattering the Primordial radiance, flowing through the heavens; its qi dense and thick; its radiance fragrant and warm; essence like a moon pearl; light like purple clouds; five qi revolve like wheels; reigning above the Nine Heavens’ palace; firmly holding the Five Emperors’ Numinous Mountains below; instructing scholars in the five teeth roots. The Upper Palace’s many saints and great wise perfected beings all at that time feast on its radiance, inhale its essence, connect with Heaven, attaining infinity. The Most High Dao Sovereign requests annotation of these texts to transmit the Ultimate Truth. According to Numinous Treasure mysterious method, once every forty thousand kalpas a transmission occurs. Thus the Numinous Treasure manifests clearly, issuing Dharma to save beings. Great Saints and Revered Gods of the Ten Directions, Marvelous Practicing Perfected Ones, together meet at the Southern Garden Cinnabar Hollow of the Three Origins cavern chamber, seal and title jade tablets, all perfected beings attending the seat, incense, blossoms, musicians, fifty million beings. True texts shining bright, illuminating profoundly, five qi observing radiance, reflecting inside and out, cloud scenes clear and bright, like the moon among stars, wondrous appearances and many excellences, beyond measure.

At that time, in the northern chamber was a diligent worthy named Wang Fudu. He had a daughter named A Qiu Zeng, aged sixteen. While bathing in a fragrant bath, she saw golden radiance shining curvedly, suspecting something unusual. She went out of the house, climbed the wall, facing south, saw the Dao Truth, spirit essence dazzling, appearance radiant like the sun. The girl’s heart rejoiced, clasped hands in respect, and from afar said: “Named Qiu Zeng, now fortunate to meet, body beholds the Celestial Honored One, returns to the Ten Directions’ Heaven of Heavens, wishes to receive precepts and vows, follow and uphold Dharma texts, uproot all evil roots, early attain the turning wheel, transform into male form, after ten thousand kalpas, hope to become flying immortal.”

The Five Emperor Demon Kings saw the girl’s great vow and feared she would surpass their realm; thus transformed into Five Elder old men, went to tell the girl: “I have received the Ten Directions’ reverent gods’ mission to speak to you of the Numinous Treasure Dharma canon. Our Dao is now spreading; the Dharma is benevolent and loving; filial piety is the root. Hearing that your father intends to give birth to a daughter, you have already heard words and cannot go against them. You should first follow this; once human path is complete, rites and teachings sufficient, then you may cast off the body. Heaven monitors your heart; if you do not obey your father, immortality has no way to deliver you.”

The girl replied to the demon: “In my past lives I was unfortunate, lacking affinity; merit and virtue not yet full, causing birth as a female. Morning and evening I repent, vow to keep one heart, with firm intention, arising naturally. Born of father and mother, fate belongs to the Ten Heavens; truly to disobey father’s teaching is not as you say.” The demon saw the girl’s steadfast heart and uprightness, could not interfere, and so withdrew.

Qiu Zeng said to herself: “The Dao is lofty and distant; without affinity I cannot freely express; still I gather firewood, climb the wall, burn my body, hoping my form and bones become flying dust, descending with the wind to the Dao’s presence.” Then the fire blazed; Qiu Zeng clasped hands to Heaven and said: “Ten Directions Infinite Celestial Honored One, today I return my form and bones to the Heaven of Heavens, wishing to be freely dispersed like dust.” Then she cast herself into the fire, burning without residue, body as if stepping on air; in an instant, she saw her female body transform into a male, directly approaching the Dao, thus receiving sincerity.

The Primordial immediately appointed the Southern Pole Revered God as her master, teaching her true texts, giving three hundred jade maidens of Taihua and three hundred jade boys of Golden Morning, all excellently adorning and manifesting her female body.

The Dao told the Southern Pole Revered God: “This girl in past lives already served the Numinous Treasure, turning the wheel for ten thousand kalpas; now she is reborn as a human, seeing me issue Dharma, she may transform form, and then save ninety-nine thousand nine hundred others to attain the Ultimate True Great God.”

At that time, all in the Ten Directions, male or female, all arise with true Dao intention, none do not diligently uphold fasting and precepts, cultivate and inherit the Numinous Treasure, holding supreme vows, all attain world deliverance.

The Dao told A Qiu Zeng: “The Southern Pole Revered God formerly was also female, born in the Chanli world’s Scarlet Bright Heaven, greatly cultivating merit, praised by the heavens. Dao work not yet complete, then met the fire kalpa turning; Heaven and Earth changed places; she was among the abandoned and cast aside. The Southern Pole responded to her cinnabar elixir; the Vermilion Palace inscribed her purple name; transformed her form and bones in the Primordial Lord’s womb; after one kalpa she was born, attained male body, at the Southern Cinnabar Cavern Upper Pavilion Pearl Seven Colored Jeweled Forest, apprenticed to Scarlet Emperor Brahma Treasure Prosperous Yang Cinnabar Spirit True Old Lord, Scarlet Script Dao accomplished, position ascending Southern Pole. Your past life was with the Southern Pole in the Chanli world, at the Cinnabar Yang Cypress Forest dwelling, both arising Dao intention. At that time Southern Pole’s surname was Huang, styled Duming, holding your right hand, jointly inscribing scarlet stone, recording names in the Southern Palace, writing your handwriting, inscribing at Southern Pavilion, still existing now; the stone characters remain. Do you recall?”

Qiu Zeng’s heart awakened; she lowered eyes and saw the Southern Pole’s dwelling at the southern wall inscribed: “Seventh year of Jia, seventh month, first day, Huang Duming and A Qiu Zeng together at Cinnabar Yang Cypress Forest dwelling arose vows.” Twenty-three characters, very clear. Recalling this not long ago, suddenly after three kalpa changes of Heaven and Earth’s fate, now born into the Numinous Treasure era.

The Dao spoke to Qiu Zeng: “Now you have master Southern Pole; is this not exalted? All due to your body’s past affinities. You must diligently advance your highest work, broadly save heavenly and human beings; when merit is full and virtue complete, you will be granted position as Ultimate True, surpassing the Three Pure Ones, swiftly reaching the Nine Clouds, feasting at the Great Profound.”

Qiu Zeng bowed before the Dao and said: “My former life was fortunate to be born in the Dao world, to meet heavenly truth, to reach the secluded chamber, light penetrating foul form, spirit opening within the altar, heart responding beyond form, casting off bones and returning to fate, one in ten thousand whole. Supreme profound mirror turning to deliver my body; having transformed form, serving before the Celestial Honored One, again favored by Southern Pole, receiving master instruction. Joy and fear fill my heart; I do not know what to say. Only beseech accomplishment, illuminate the unheard, jade secret treasure marvel, please have pity.”

The Most High Dao Sovereign ascended and bestowed the Scarlet Emperor Spirit Boy, opened the Nine Frost Jade Chest’s seven-colored mysteries, issued the Numinous Treasure Scarlet Script Jade Secret in two scrolls, entrusting to Southern Pole, to be granted and received by Qiu Zeng, all immortals supervising the oath, all at once praising goodness.
