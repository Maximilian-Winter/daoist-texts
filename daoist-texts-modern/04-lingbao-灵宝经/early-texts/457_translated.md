# Daoist Precepts and Disciplines

## On the Precepts

Those who pursue the dao, none do not hold fast to precepts with utmost reverence, accumulating merit and practice. Thus, the Left Immortal Master once said: “To study the dao without observing fasting and precepts is but vain toil in the mountains and forests.” For precepts are the guard against evil deeds. Without holding to precepts, the dao cannot be attained.

The scriptures of the Three Caverns speak extensively on precepts. To outline the grand framework: there are the Three Refuges precepts; the Five Precepts of the Seal-Born; the Eight Precepts; the Supreme Ten Precepts for lay men and women; the Initial Truth Ten Precepts for new monastics; the Seventy-Two Precepts of the Zhengyi disciples; Laozi’s One Hundred and Eighty Precepts; the Ten Precepts of Heavenly Purity; the Fourteen Precepts of Body Maintenance; the Five Thousand-Character Golden Knot Taiqing Yin-Yang Precepts; the Twenty-Seven Precepts of the Supreme Profound Dharma Masters; the Five, Thirteen, and Seven Hundred and Twenty Precept Gates of the Cavern Spirits’ Three Dao Essentials; the One Hundred and Twenty-Nine Precepts of the Ascending Profound Inner Teachings; the Six-Emotion Closure Precepts of the Lingbao Initial Covenant; the Great Wisdom Precepts of the Middle Covenant; the One Hundred and Eighty Precepts of the Three Primes of the Great Covenant; the Three Hundred Great Precepts of the Supreme Clarity Wisdom Body Observation; the Twelve Hundred Precepts… All these are the ancient secret transmissions of Daoism.

Since the early Qing, Wang Changyue reopened the altar to expound precepts, pruning the complex into the simple, transmitting certain Initial Truth precepts, certain Middle Ultimate precepts, and certain Great Celestial precepts. These have become the model for the precept altar—concise yet clear, complete yet comprehensive. Therefore, for over three hundred years, they have continuously served as the standard for Daoist practitioners to cultivate the dao and maintain the body, the path to accumulating merit and practice. To increase goodness and halt evil, to return to truth and abandon falsehood—none but through this do they gradually advance and suddenly awaken.

Precepts form a vital part of Daoist ritual norms. Here, essentials are carefully selected and compiled, revealing but a glimpse of the strict self-discipline embraced by Daoist adherents.
