# Discourse on Precepts and Discipline

Among those who seek the dao, none fail to hold fast to precepts with reverent devotion, accumulating merit and practice. Thus, the Left Immortal Master declared: “To study the dao without observing fasting and precepts is but vain toil in the mountains and forests.” For precepts are the guard against evil deeds; without steadfast precepts, the dao cannot be attained.

The scriptures of the Three Caverns speak extensively on precepts. To sketch their grand outlines: there are the Three Refuges precepts; the Five Precepts of the Primordial Spirit; the Eight Precepts; the Ten Supreme Precepts for laymen and women; the Initial True Ten Precepts for new monastics; the Seventy-two Precepts of the Zhengyi disciples; Laozi’s One Hundred and Eighty Precepts; the Ten Celestial True Precepts; the Fourteen Precepts of Body Cultivation; the Five Thousand Character Golden Knot Taiqing Yin-Yang Precepts; the Twenty-seven Precepts of the Most High Profound Dharma Master; the Five, Thirteen, and Seven Hundred and Twenty Precept Gates of the Cavern Spirits’ Three Dao Essentials; the One Hundred and Twenty-nine Precepts of the Ascending Profound Inner Teachings; the Six-Emotion Closure Precepts of the Lingbao Initial Covenant; the Great Wisdom Precepts of the Middle Covenant; the One Hundred and Eighty Precepts of the Great Covenant of the Three Primes; the Three Hundred Great Precepts of the Supreme Clarity Wisdom Body Observation; and the Twelve Hundred Precepts... All these are the ancient secret transmissions of Daoism.

Since the early Qing, Wang Changyue reopened the altar of precepts, pruning the complex to the simple, transmitting several Initial True Precepts, several Middle Ultimate Precepts, and several Great Celestial Precepts. He established the model for the altar of discipline—concise yet clear, complete yet comprehensive. For more than three hundred years, this has been the unbroken standard for Daoist practitioners to cultivate the dao and maintain their conduct, the path to accumulating merit and practice. To increase goodness and halt evil, to return to the True and abandon falsehood—none fail to advance gradually through this and suddenly awaken.

Precepts and discipline form a vital part of Daoist ritual norms. Here we select and compile essentials, revealing but a glimpse of the strict self-discipline embraced by Daoist adherents.
