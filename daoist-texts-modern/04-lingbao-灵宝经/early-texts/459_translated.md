# The Precepts of the Primordial Truth

The *Discourse on the Precepts of the Primordial Truth* declares:

“Those who can receive and uphold these precepts are not merely desired to exhaust their hearts and exhaust their natures, but rather it is wished that they come to know their destiny and know Heaven itself—emerging from the world while dwelling within it, reaching the body’s depths while observing the body’s nature. Truly, they assist the transformation of kingship and bind people to manifold virtues. The precepts within the dharma are precisely the study of rectifying the heart and sincere intention; the methods within the precepts are none other than the transformation that governs the state and harmonizes the family. It only desires that people follow the text with strictness and correctness, thereby knowing the profound mystery… Thus, the laws of kings are manifest, and the laws of the Dao are hidden; when the Dao’s decrees govern oneself, the king’s laws govern the people—these two are the exterior and interior, supporting the teachings of the world.

Today, those who know only the statutes of kings but not the precepts of the dharma, or those who know only the dharma’s precepts but not the statutes of kings—this is called partial vision… The term ‘primordial’ means the beginning. ‘Truth’ means uncontrived. ‘Precept’ means prohibition. It means that the world’s people at the very start possess the uncontrived true nature, originally from the heavenly mandate, without thought or action, spontaneously and naturally, with no goodness to cultivate and no evil to commit. Therefore it is said: ‘To do good is without seeking fame nearby; to do evil is without fearing punishment nearby. Following the governor’s command as the scripture, one may protect the body, preserve life, nourish parents, and fulfill one’s years.’

All myriad dharmas arise from one’s own nature; a single thought of deliberation preserves transformation. If thought and deliberation produce evil, it transforms into hellish fiends. If thought and deliberation cultivate goodness, it transforms into heavenly benevolent spirits. Lewdness and lust become dogs and swine; restlessness and violence become rhinoceroses and tigers. Jealousy becomes serpents and scorpions; kindness becomes sages and saints. Gentlemen and petty men all dwell within a single thought of deliberation, the transformations of their own nature—thus it is said: countless billions of transformed bodies.

When deluded people do not recognize the Dao, have not heard the scriptures, have not met a master, when doubts remain uncut and the mirror of wisdom is unopened, they cannot awaken to self-awareness, blocking their own light, letting the heart run wild at will, thought after thought unceasing, thoughts without return. They become entirely ensnared by greed, anger, ignorance, lust, killing, theft, evil speech, frivolous words, double tongues, and false speech—the ten evil deeds—beset by the dusty realms outside and disturbances of conditions that disorder body and mind, causing the six roots to move recklessly, gladly enduring the driving toil and suffering, wandering endlessly through birth and death.

Now, having self-awareness, turning to the Dao, turning to the scriptures, turning to the master—after these three refuges and precepts, one washes the heart and repents. To repent is to atone for past faults. All former ten evil karmas, foolish delusions, attachments, falsehoods, jealousies, and the like, are all completely repented and prohibited, never to arise again. To regret is to mourn future faults. From now on, all ten evil karmas, foolish delusions, attachments, falsehoods, jealousies, and the like—now having awakened—are all forever cut off, never again to be done. Without thought and without action, not a single thought arises, returning once more to the primordial boundless natural true nature, thereby restoring the original heavenly mandate. Thus it is called the Ten Precepts of the Primordial Truth.

…Therefore, those who use the precepts do so only to harness affairs to capture the heart, to exhaust the original nature, to condition feelings and control nature, so as to complete the ordinary heart. Hence, those who strive on the Dao, if they do not seek the precepts as their teacher and hold the precepts as their life, are indeed those who do not understand the principle of nature, do not follow the heavenly mandate, and do not abide by the sacred teachings.”
