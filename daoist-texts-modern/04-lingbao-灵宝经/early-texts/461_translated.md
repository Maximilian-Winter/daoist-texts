# The Primordial True Precepts

Whenever one first enters the venerable and orthodox dao lineage of the Most High, regardless of whether one is of the Way or the mundane, one must first faithfully observe the Most High’s golden statutes and jade ordinances—the precepts of the Three Caverns—offering reverence to the august image of the Great Dao, and presenting homage to the Celestial Inspector King of the All-Heavenly Surveillance. One then petitions to swear the solemn covenant, receiving the Three Refuges Precepts.

**The Three Refuges Precepts:**

- The first refuge is to entrust the body to the Most High Limitless Great Dao, forever escaping the wheel of rebirth; hence it is called the Treasure of the Dao.

- The second refuge is to entrust the spirit to the revered scriptures of the thirty-six divisions, thereby hearing the true dharma; hence it is called the Treasure of the Scriptures.

- The third refuge is to entrust one’s fate to the Primordial Great Master within the Mystery, never falling into erroneous views; hence it is called the Treasure of the Master.

The Heavenly Venerable declares: The Three Refuges Precepts are the pivot of Heaven and Earth, the root foundation of spirits and immortals, the initial gate of all practice, the primal omen of the heart’s establishment. They govern the movement of qi and contain the numinous, penetrate the profound truth, encompass all forms, and my own form lies nowhere beyond them. Those who hold them, the gods and spirits of Heaven and Earth rejoice and celebrate; their hearts, minds, ears, and eyes open wide; all things bow in awe; the six viscera harmonize in joy; the myriad true ones stand guard. As parents to all beings, enduring through the ages without fail, the human body and spirit intertwine in perfect accord. The competition of the Three Refuges is to receive the Most High Laozi’s ordained “Five Precepts of Accumulating Merit and Returning to the Root.”
