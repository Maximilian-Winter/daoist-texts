# The Five Precepts of Accumulating Merit and Returning to the Root

The Five Precepts of the Primordial True One are these:  
One, do not kill living beings;  
Two, do not partake of meat or wine;  
Three, do not speak with a mouth that denies the heart;  
Four, do not steal;  
Five, do not engage in illicit sexual conduct.

**First: Do not kill living beings.**  
According to the *Scripture of the Lord Lao’s Precepts*: All sentient beings, from those containing breath and above, soaring in flight or writhing in movement, none shall be slain. Among the writhing creatures, all delight in life; even mosquitoes, ants, dragonflies, and centipedes know to avoid death.

**Second: Do not partake of meat or wine.**  
According to the *Scripture of the Lord Lao’s Precepts*: The precept against wine is not for bodily illness nor for ritual propriety, but otherwise, drinking is forbidden. Bodily illness means when one’s own body is afflicted and wine is needed as medicine. Ritual propriety refers clearly not to worldly feasts or offerings to ghosts and spirits; if it is the rites of respect between ranks or the sacred feast of true numinous beings, then one will not err in observing it.

**Third: Do not speak with a mouth that denies the heart.**  
According to the *Scripture of the Lord Lao’s Precepts*: The precept against false speech means that if one speaks of things neither heard nor seen, matters not fully grasped by the heart but told to others, all this is false speech—what is spoken contradicts the heart’s truth. Furthermore, there are flowery words, flattering twists, repetition, and double-tongued speech.

**Fourth: Do not steal.**  
According to the *Scripture of the Lord Lao’s Precepts*: Anything above one coin, whether it has an owner or not, and is not one’s own, must not be taken falsely. On the earth is the Earth Official, in the waters the Water Official, and among people their masters; thus, there is no thing truly ownerless. When it says “ownerless,” it means that at that moment there is no one guarding it.

**Fifth: Do not engage in illicit sexual conduct.**  
According to the *Scripture of the Lord Lao’s Precepts*: The precept against lust means that if not husband and wife, whether monks or nuns, neither men nor women, all must not transgress. Even husband and wife, though not violating the precept, if excessive, it is still considered a lustful offense.

These five precepts are the foundation of holding the body, the root of maintaining the dao. Whoever can hold these five precepts with diligence and without fault will increase their tally of merit and extend their lifespan. The heavenly spirits will protect and bless them, forever freeing them from the suffering of the five punishments, and in every lifetime they will not lose the human form.

Having received the command of the Most High Lord Lao to accumulate merit and return to the root through the Five Precepts, each morning one burns incense and recites the *True Scripture of the Most High Three Origins, Three Grades, and Three Officials Great Emperors Protecting the Nation, Aiding the People, Extending Life, and Safeguarding Fate*, then follows with the *Treatise on Response and Retribution of the Most High*. Daily one recites and reflects, correcting oneself to see if the body and mind have transgressed.

For each verse of scripture recited, one turns inward and asks: Can I bear this? Can I practice this? Thus, with courage and diligence, words and deeds are not taken lightly; the Three Refuges are not violated, the Five Precepts without fault. After a hundred days of training, all evil thoughts vanish, the vessels and blood are purified, and only then is one permitted to receive the command of the Sovereign of the Void Heavens to undertake the Ten Precepts of the Primordial True One.
