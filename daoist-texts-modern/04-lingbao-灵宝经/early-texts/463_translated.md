Having received the Ten Precepts of the Primordial Truth to verify the fruit of genuine realization, one must then advance with fierce courage and diligent refinement, guarding words and deeds without the slightest fault—only then may one be permitted to receive the Three Hundred Great Precepts commanded by the Most High Patriarch of the Dao. But if one merely recites them with the lips while the heart is astray, speaking pure words but acting impurely; or if one begins diligently but ends in neglect, abandoning the path halfway—thus it is said: knowingly committing offenses is a graver sin, more irreparable, leading to eternal sinking and perdition. The Heavenly Laws of the Maiden Azure are merciless; even the Most High cannot save you then. Those who study the dao and aspire to immortality, think carefully and guard yourselves!

Title of Scripture: The Text of the Ten Precepts of the Primordial Truth by the Venerable Sovereign of the Void Emperor. One scroll. Source: *The Orthodox Daoist Canon*, Sect of Profound Truth, Category of Precepts and Rules.

It is respectfully noted that the Venerable Sovereign of the Void Emperor said: To leave the household and transcend the mundane is always due to a prior auspicious connection; thus one can alone rise above ordinary norms. If one is as careful at the end as at the beginning, refining with utmost precision, blessings will extend to seven generations and joy will flow throughout the entire lineage. As the saying goes, a tower of nine stories rises from piled earth; a journey of a thousand li begins beneath the feet. The gateway to the dao and the foundation of accumulated virtue must also begin here. At the time of opening the path, one should receive the Ten Precepts of the Primordial Truth, which are ten in number—you shall receive them.

### The First Precept  
One must not be disloyal, unfilial, unkind, or untrustworthy; one should exhaust all loyalty to sovereign and parents, and extend sincerity to all things.

The tradition says: Among the myriad scriptures of immortality, loyalty and filial piety come first. For to dedicate oneself in service to the sovereign, diligently attending to royal affairs, is to repay the grace of protection. To cultivate oneself and act cautiously, serving parents well, is to repay the grace of birth and nurture. To treat teachers as one treats parents is to repay the grace of instruction. Life depends on these three, yet one serves them as one, thus repaying the great root. Moreover, to look up without shame before Heaven, and down without remorse before men, revering and trusting the numinous spirits, is to repay the grace of creation. These three prior graces are called the Fourfold Graces. As for blessing the country and extending joy, dispelling demons and removing harm, transforming the people to goodness—this is the loyalty of those who leave the household. In life, they guide their kin to cherish blessings and turn toward the dao; in death, they act for them, transferring their spirits to blessed realms. Regarding oneself, one must sever all affections and dust ties, focus the mind single-heartedly, and diligently study the dao. When the dao功 is accomplished, even if kin have been born over countless kalpas, all may be transcended. Above, one may repay the Fourfold Graces; below, one may relieve the sufferings of the Three Paths. This is the filial piety of those who leave the household. As for the unkind, who deceive their hearts with false deeds and violate propriety without cause; and the untrustworthy, who speak empty boasts and bewilder the masses with flowery words—one must know that great loyalty means not darkening one’s heart, not deceiving even in a single thing; great filial piety means not contravening principle, loving even a single being. Thus, one false word that deceives the heart is not loyalty; one act that violates propriety is not filial piety. Therefore, loyalty and filial piety are the foremost of all precepts, the source of all conduct, the first task of the learner. If one can follow and practice these above, then one may exhaust all loyalty to sovereign and parents and extend sincerity to all things.

### The Second Precept  
One must not secretly plot in darkness, harming others to benefit oneself; one should practice hidden virtue and broadly aid all living beings.

Those who plot secretly in darkness cause others to err, instigating disputes and lawsuits. They lead people into traps and nets, taking delight in their own gain while harming others—this desire is beyond words. Yet if one can turn the light inward and transform others to goodness, then one widely practices hidden virtue and universally aids all living beings. This is the foremost meaning of entering the dao.

### The Third Precept  
One must not kill or harm sentient life to satisfy taste; one should act with compassion and kindness, extending even to insects.

Not killing life is to preserve benevolence and love. Birds and beasts, born alongside humans, share the same life essence; they have mates, parental affections, nests to dwell in, desires for food and drink, love and fear—how different are they from humans? To harbor a heart of compassion, unable to bear slaughter and eating, thus proving the practice of mercy—how good is that! Perhaps one’s heart is kind to people and loves all things, yet one’s actions mingle with the common crowd and are inconvenient; then one refrains from intending to kill, refrains from killing with one’s hands, and refrains from seeing killing—these three cleansings mean eating according to circumstances, so how is killing done? Moreover, sages and worthies have not always insisted on the presence or absence of meat; and as for benevolence extended to all things, how can it be constant or divided? Like a net loosened on three sides, footsteps far from the kitchen, fishing without nets, shooting without hunting at night, awakening hibernating creatures without killing, not breaking young shoots—such is the universal kindness to people, insects, grasses, and trees, treating all alike. Those who later abstain from meat, can they truly do so? One must also know that the abundance or scarcity of one’s clothing and food depends on the depth of one’s past cultivation; today’s portion is what one receives by fate, and thus one can moderate it. Then the blessings to come will be vast beyond measure. If one can thus act, compassion extending even to insects is no empty phrase.

### The Fourth Precept  
One must not indulge in licentiousness or corrupt the true nature, nor pollute or disdain the numinous qi; one should guard chastity, so as not to allow any breach.

Not indulging in licentiousness is to guard against disorder in human relations. Those with families are especially established to continue ancestors and heirs; thus, relying on matchmakers, contracts, and formal betrothals, marriage is clear and proper. There are also feasts to summon neighbors and friends, reinforcing distinctions between men and women; thus the way of husband and wife, by propriety, is natural and does not violate others’ affections—how then is it licentious? Prostitutes and courtesans are called lowly precisely because their promiscuity disrupts human order. To be close to such is to be equal with them. Yet former immortal masters sometimes played among the courtesans, perhaps to test the dao-heart, to see if the mind remains unmoved by circumstance, or to guide those with affinity beyond dust and illusion. Later commoners, however, might cite this to justify their own wandering on false paths, confusing true and false, immortals and mortals differing in aim. Upright persons and gentlemen, holding to their own good principles, need not be ensnared by such delusions. Those who leave the household and transcend the mundane do so because of prior auspicious blessings, thus alone rising above ordinary norms. If they can suddenly cease dust ties, sever lustful desires, and diligently cultivate the dao, they shall attain the immortal rank, blessing nine ancestors and joy flowing through one lineage. The scripture says: Immortals and daoists are not born with numinous essence; they accumulate essence and nurture qi to become true. Yet some at the beginning lack clarity in will and discipline; they should early cultivate and examine themselves to encourage the future, not betray good causes and fall again into dust nets. One must guard chastity, so as not to allow any breach; then blessings and virtue will renew daily and dao功 can be accomplished.

### The Fifth Precept  
One must not ruin others’ achievements nor sever kinship bonds; one should assist all beings by the dao, bringing harmony to the nine clans.

Not ruining others’ achievements means that when one hears of another’s good, one praises and harmonizes; when one hears of evil, one covers it so that they may succeed and not lose virtue. Not severing kinship means that when one sees relatives in discord—father and son, husband and wife, brothers, teachers and friends—due to conflict becoming estranged, one should use the dao to exhort and encourage them to harmony, preventing separation. Thus human relations are not destroyed, and dao righteousness is preserved; this is truly the essential path of genuine reputation. Those who study the dao should each understand this.

---

### The Sixth Precept  
One must not slander the worthy and good, nor flaunt one’s talents to exalt oneself; one should praise others’ virtues and not boast of one’s own abilities.

This is truly the gateway to entering the dao. Speech is the voice of the heart; false speech arises from an insincere heart. When the heart is insincere yet claims to follow the dao, this is to go against the dao in seeking the dao—there is no truth in it. To meet the worthy and good and slander them, to flaunt one’s talents and boast of one’s abilities, is not fitting for the upright person. One must praise others’ virtues, so that one’s own功 may be stirred into motion. This is indeed a deep precept for the learner.

---

### The Seventh Precept  
One must not drink wine excessively nor eat meat in violation of the precepts; one should harmonize qi and nature, dedicating oneself to purity and emptiness.

Not drinking wine is to guard against disordering one’s nature. Wine was originally for rites, to foster harmony and cordiality; the ancients hosted guests with a hundred bows, drinking all day without intoxication, showing moderation. Later people indulged without limit, drinking to drunkenness, leading to bodily confusion, loss of ritual and law, sometimes causing illness or calamity, unaware of their fault. If one can moderate drinking according to one’s usual capacity, reducing excess so as not to disorder nature, what harm is there? As for forbidden meat—cattle who have labored, dogs who have loyalty, geese with order, carp and eels aligned with the Big Dipper—how can one bear to eat such? If one can extend this heart and abstain from eating them, one may harmonize qi and nature, resonate with true numinousness, dedicate oneself to purity and emptiness, and daily renew dao achievements, with mysterious功 manifesting in time. All learners should be cautious.

---

### The Eighth Precept  
One must not covet endlessly nor hoard wealth without sharing; one should practice frugality and compassion, caring for the poor and needy.

One’s poverty or wealth is decreed by fate at birth, already predetermined. If born with wealth, it is used and returns; if born with poverty, no amount of seeking will make one rich. To understand this principle, all seeking should be left to nature. One must not take what is not one’s own; not gain wealth by unrighteous means; take only what is proper and according to one’s portion. One should not fall into the desire of insatiable seeking, nor hoard without dispersing, thereby inviting calamity. Yet those of our order must first see through illusion and falsity, be compassionate to the poor, practice frugality and caution, live according to circumstances, not harshly demand constancy; thus the mind and ground become empty and leisurely, desires dissipate, and in time naturally accord with the dao and truth.

---

### The Ninth Precept  
One must not associate with the unworthy nor dwell in filth and disorder; one should admire those superior to oneself and dwell in purity and emptiness.

Those newly leaving the household, unable to stand alone, must rely on the community, or form dao companions, mutually supporting to avoid bias. Yet friends come in three kinds: cloud friends and rosy friends; good friends and knowing friends; wild friends and strange friends. Those with will and discipline, refining the mind-ground, investigating sin and merit, severing dust feelings, roaming beyond the world, seeking like-minded companions, become friends called cloud friends and rosy friends, because their hearts resemble clouds and rosy clouds, unaffected by worldly matters. Others who study scriptures and speak widely are called good friends and knowing friends, because they do not refine the mind but also cannot do evil. Another kind neglects the mind-ground, ignores scriptures, disregards sin and merit, speaks wrongly, acts wildly, quarrels at slightest provocation, boasts and shows off, relies on strength and victory, bullies the good, forming factions; these are wild friends and strange friends. After death, these three kinds have respective destinations and receive retribution according to功業. The cloud and rosy friends ascend to the formless, feasting in the Jade Capital, becoming immortals or heavenly officials; the good and knowing friends’ dust hearts remain, not transcending human relations; the wild and strange friends receive no功德, repay their debts with suffering, falling to the hells or lower births, enduring the pains of reincarnation. When it comes to this, regret is too late. Thus one must carefully choose among these three kinds of friends. Learners should reflect and seek what is best, admire those superior to themselves, dwell in purity and emptiness, not betray the hearts of parents who send their children to leave the household, nor the intentions of the holy court opening teachings to save people. To embody these is to surely attain the perfected功.

---

### The Tenth Precept  
One must not be careless in speech or laughter, nor act falsely; one should be solemn and sparing in words, making dao and virtue one’s endeavor.

The ancients said: Solemnity and gravity bring wealth and honor; frivolity and shallowness bring premature death and poverty. Careless speech, obsequious smiles, crooked learning to flatter the world—these are the ways of petty men, not fitting for the upright. Moreover, being solemn and sparing in words, composed in demeanor, is the key to advancing on the dao, the proper conduct of the truly accomplished. If one can earnestly guard and diligently practice this, what worry is there that nobility will not come?
