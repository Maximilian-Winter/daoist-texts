# Precious Decree of the Southern Pole

With devoted heart and reverent soul, I bow and surrender myself in homage.  
To the Lofty and Supreme Sovereign of the Celestial Pavilion,  
Whose spirit condenses and brilliantly illumines the Palace,  
Where the Primordial Ancestor’s qi gathers and divides into the True.  

He responds to the wondrous Dao of emptiness and non-being, unfolding creation’s mystery.  
His station lies beyond the Nine Heavens,  
Overseeing all the myriad heavens,  
Encompassing the Ten Extremes of the cosmos.  

He governs the transformations of all things,  
Proclaiming the Golden Talismans that cast radiant light to relieve suffering,  
Bestowing grace and favor that nurture and shelter all living beings.  

His kindness pervades the Primal Origin,  
His compassion spreads across vast kalpas.  
Great is his mercy, great his vow;  
Great is his sagehood, great his benevolence.  

He is the True King of Jade Purity,  
The Great Emperor of Longevity at the Southern Pole,  
Sovereign of the Celestial Primordial, Holy and Venerable.
