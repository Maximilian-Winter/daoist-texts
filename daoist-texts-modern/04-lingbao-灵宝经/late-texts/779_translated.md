# The Precious Edict of Doumu

With utmost sincerity, I bow and submit my vow.  
In the Western land of India, amid the radiance of great wisdom,  
Dwells the Sovereign Master of the True Void and Marvelous Form,  
The Supreme Primordial Heavenly Mother,  
Where golden light dazzles and the sun and moon hide their brilliance.  
When the precious pestle turns, ghosts and spirits lose their color in awe.  
Her numinous traces appear in the mortal world,  
Guarding the sacred chariot in Jambudvīpa.  
When beings face calamity and call her name,  
The Great Being swiftly heeds their cries to relieve their suffering.  
Great compassion, great vow—  
Great saint, great mercy.  
The Heavenly Queen of Vast Virtue and Radiant Light,  
The Great Saint Marici of the Heavens,  
The Heavenly Venerable Doumu of Perfect Clarity.

With utmost sincerity, I bow and submit my vow.  
In the heavens, the Asuras revolve with the turning sun,  
On earth, urgent perils stir the fiery times.  
Ever roaming before the two celestial bodies of sun and moon,  
She alone stands as the numinous spirit within the Three Realms.  
Her majestic radiance shines brilliantly,  
Her wondrous form perfectly harmonious.  
She reaches forth to save all beings,  
Transcending and liberating them from all suffering.  
Great compassion, great vow—  
Great saint, great mercy.  
The Great Emperor, Ancestral Lord of Thunder of the Nine Heavens,  
The Solar Sovereign of the Sun Palace,  
The Lunar Sovereign of the Moon Mansion,  
The Sacred and Wise Primordial Doumu,  
The Heavenly Queen of Violet Radiance and Golden Reverence,  
Saving all in distress,  
The Great Emperor Marici of the Heavens,  
The Heavenly Venerable Mother of Perfect Clarity.
