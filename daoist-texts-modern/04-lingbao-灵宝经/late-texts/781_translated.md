## Precious Edict of the Eastern Flourishing Sovereign

With wholehearted reverence, I bow and take refuge.  
The pure and subtle Great Dao, the Limitless Divine Sovereign.  
The primordial transformation’s vital breath divides the true;  
Within the Purple Mansion, the hidden dragon must not be stirred.  
He proclaims himself emperor upon the mountains of the cardinal directions,  
Charged with the celestial stairway and the immortal registers;  
He establishes his palace above the Azure Sea,  
His dao named for nurturing and transforming all beings.  
The Three Palaces hold their governing offices,  
The Eight Emperors sit upon the throne of non-action.  
At the appointed time, ascending the platform to gaze southward,  
The purple qi flows gently from the east.  
Deeply tranquil and truly still,  
He births and guides profound功 (power).  
The supreme sovereign, ancestor of all numinous beings,  
Great compassion, great vow, great sage, great mercy.  
The Eastern Flourishing Great Director of Fate,  
The Lesser Yang Emperor Lord,  
The Sovereign of Fusang,  
The Eastern King Wood Duke Heavenly Venerable.

With wholehearted reverence, I bow and take refuge.  
The Purple Mansion’s grotto heaven, the azure yang transforming qi.  
He holds the registers of all immortals,  
Opening and expounding the first gates of the法 (method).  
He composed the Yellow Court and the Dao De Jing,  
Each complementing the other as interior and exterior;  
He weighs the balance in the Orchid Garden, assisting the Divine Treasure Sovereign,  
Secretly preserving and maintaining it.  
Azure clouds form a canopy, purple qi links the city walls.  
Great compassion, great vow, great sage, great mercy.  
The azure yang gives rise to the lineage,  
The Purple Mansion’s Eastern Flourishing Sovereign,  
Assisting the primordial and establishing the ultimate Heavenly Venerable.

With wholehearted reverence, I bow and take refuge.  
Commander of the celestial immortals, the great thread and warp of the Great Dao.  
He receives the primordial spirits of the nine qi,  
Gathering the subtle mysteries of the pure and subtle.  
He opens and unfolds the elixir methods,  
Revealing and discerning the pre-heavenly.  
Perfectly bright and free, reflecting the void,  
Vast and exalted, communicating the unbeginning.  
He aids all beings with vows profound and weighty,  
Lifting those who transcend their kinds, raising the stagnant and sinking to ascend.  
The withered and decayed receive qi from the east,  
In the dark and hidden, light is seen upon the red earth.  
He clearly proclaims the orthodox teaching,  
Containing and governing the paths of error.  
Great compassion, great vow, great sage, great mercy,  
Master of the immortal treasure seals,  
Eastern Flourishing establishes the ultimate,  
Great Dao Sovereign,  
Transmitting the elixir to save the world, Heavenly Venerable.
