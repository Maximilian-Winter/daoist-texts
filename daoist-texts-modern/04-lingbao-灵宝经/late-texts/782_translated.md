## The Precious Edict of the Mysterious Lady of the Nine Heavens

With utmost sincerity, I bow and take refuge.  
The Primordial Heavenly Divine Maiden (the Matron),  
The Immortal Maiden of Ages Past,  
Adorned with solemn and wondrous form,  
Ever manifesting in the Saha World,  
A pure and tranquil Dharma body.  
Early ascending the Brahma realms and the radiant Langhuan,  
The Mysterious Capital of the Celestial Spheres.  
Bound by jade girdles and golden bands,  
Encircled by lofty peaks and square urns,  
Steaming sands and boiling stones,  
She emits the divine radiance of the boundless Ultimate,  
Illuminating all beings universally.  
She moves the Dao energy of the profound Origin,  
Transforming and bringing forth myriad things.  
Her功 (merit) shines through past and present,  
Her德 (virtue) matches Heaven and Earth.  
Ranked among the Nine Heavens,  
She holds the pivot of Creation’s workings,  
Spiritually connected to the Three Realms,  
Commanding the thunderbolts’ summons.  
Compassionate and vast,  
Her transformations are endless.  
In her hand she wields the precious sword,  
Cutting down demon kings beneath the Dipper’s enclosure,  
Her feet tread the golden lotus,  
Paying homage to the Queen Mother within the Jade Palace.  
Great compassion, great vow,  
Most manifest, most efficacious—  
The Mysterious Lady of the Nine Heavens, the Primordial Sovereign of the Boundless.

With devoted heart, I bow and take refuge.  
From the Southern Palace, the Purple Mansion,  
The unsurpassed Dao unfolds,  
Opening and transforming the Mysterious Ultimate,  
Utterly true and uncorrupted,  
True Emptiness and Primordial Beginning,  
The spiritual source of ancestral kalpas,  
The void and nothingness embody the Dao,  
Its wondrous function is inexhaustible.  
The very root of all immortals, all true ones, all sages,  
Her divine mechanisms are unfathomable,  
She is the master of the dao, the master of the methods, the master of the teachings.  
Most numinous, most responsive,  
The compassion of the most sacred,  
Saving the world and settling chaos,  
Expounding the dharma, able and benevolent, the sacred mother—  
The Mysterious Mother of the Nine Heavens, the Holy Heavenly Venerable.

With utmost sincerity, I bow and take refuge.  
Nine Heavens, Nine Heavens,  
The Mysterious Maiden, the True Immortal,  
Wearing a golden helmet upon her head,  
Her feet treading fiery wheels,  
Riding a white crane amidst the clouds,  
Holding a precious sword to sever demons and spirits.  
Descending to the mortal realm to rescue and save the good people,  
What spirit does not submit?  
What ghost does not tremble?  
She personally descends,  
Delivering aid to myriad beings,  
Great compassion, great vow,  
Great sage, great mercy.  
Her immortal palace and spiritual cavern,  
Manifesting among mortals to save the world,  
The mysterious pearl and wondrous dao,  
The Mysterious Lady, the Divine Mother,  
Promoting Confucianism and saving the world, the Great Compassionate Venerable.
