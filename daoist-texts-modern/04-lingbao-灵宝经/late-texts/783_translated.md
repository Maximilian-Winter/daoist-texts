# The Precious Edict of Patriarch Qiu

With utmost sincerity I bow and submit. The hidden and the manifest are beyond measure; embracing the dao is boundless. Nourishing the yellow sprout within the belly, the cauldron soars with white snow. The body rests in stillness, quietly concealing Heaven and Earth; the heart is serene and silent, turning the cosmos. Marvelously surpassing yin and yang, mysteriously transcending the limitless, bestowing the supreme secret of the Golden Elixir, universally ferrying future generations. The unfolding lineage extends, the mysterious descendants endure ten thousand ages. The Perfected Master of the Complete Reality teaching, the vast virtue and gracious mentor, great compassion and great vow, great favor and great benevolence—the Patriarch of Eternal Spring’s wondrous dao, the Revealer of the Profound and Grand Dao True Person, the Heavenly Venerable who broadly aids and universally ferries all.

## Commentary on the Precious Edict of Patriarch Qiu

The Precious Edict of Patriarch Qiu is the treasured proclamation of Patriarch Qiu Chuji of the Longmen lineage within the Complete Reality School. On the surface, it praises the cultivation journey of Patriarch Qiu, yet in truth, it is an inner alchemical scripture. Thus, the Precious Edict of Patriarch Qiu is interpreted according to the alchemical canon. Patriarch Qiu, styled Tongmi, Daoist name Eternal Spring Master, hailed from Qixia in Dengzhou, and was the fifth patriarch and leader of the Complete Reality School.

### The Hidden and Manifest Are Beyond Measure; Embracing the Dao Is Boundless. Nourishing the Yellow Sprout Within the Belly, the Cauldron Soars with White Snow.

The sage at times lets go and delights in freedom, unbound by rules, hidden and manifest beyond measure, seeming mad or foolish. Those who attain the dao and become perfected beings all embrace the dao without end, their spirits and numinous transformations unfolding—sometimes dividing forms and scattering images, sometimes entering existence and then void, sometimes lightly rising for distant travels, hidden and manifest beyond measure. Some exchange their bones and ascend as immortals, roaming the Isles of the Blazing Pillar; others are summoned by the Great One, relocating to the Central Elixir, each following the depth of their功 (practice and merit).

Those who live long refine the Golden Elixir. To refine the Golden Elixir, one first gathers the Yellow Sprout. Earth can give birth to sprouts, hence the Yellow Sprout. The human heart’s spirit knows emptiness and stillness; the dao heart truly perceives and reveals, generating qi and returning it, like grass and trees sprouting beneath the earth, their color yellowish tender, their essence pure water, thus named Yellow Sprout. The Yellow Sprout is the primordial essence, the initial sprouting of the innate primordial qi within inner refinement, like the yellow shoot of growing plants, full of vitality.

The Yellow Sprout symbolizes the budding of the innate primordial qi, the original true lead born of true intention. From emptiness arises white snow; from silence emerges the yellow sprout. White snow is mercury qi. Those who seek it must possess virtue. The dragon’s string qi is white snow; the tiger’s string qi is the yellow sprout. The root of the great medicine truly lies here. The dao is supremely simple; the matter is not distant. Without great功 (merit and achievement), none can meet the true master who reveals the profound secrets.

The dao arises from emptiness producing one qi; one qi transforms into yin and yang, called dragon and tiger. Dragon wood generates fire; tiger metal generates water. Wood, fire, metal, and water combine to form the Four Symbols. The Four Symbols unite to form the Great Elixir, whose completion depends on earth. Earth has no fixed form, dividing into the four seasons and times; without the true earth of the four seasons, the four sequences cannot proceed, how then can creation arise? Therefore, the Four Symbols and Five Phases all rely on earth.

The Yellow Sprout and White Snow signify the initial meeting of heart and kidney, the first sprouting of the innate primordial qi. “Nourishing the Yellow Sprout within the belly, the cauldron soars with white snow” describes the state of the ancestral qi’s awakening. The preceding four lines depict the state during inner alchemical cultivation.

### The Body Rests in Stillness, Quietly Concealing Heaven and Earth. The Heart Is Serene and Silent, Turning the Cosmos.

Before grass and trees grow, they contain and nurture the primal simplicity; when their shell cracks, they receive one qi to sprout. Thus, one leaf represents one qi. Then two leaves appear, symbolizing yin and yang. Then from between these two leaves another leaf sprouts, corresponding to the Three Powers. Beyond this, growth flourishes—spring brings green leaves, summer grows red flowers, all by the power of yang qi. Autumn ripens fruit, winter kills and returns to root, all by the power of yin qi. Yin and yang in harmony cause ceaseless transformation; if either is lacking, all things fail to grow. As it is said, “Lonely yin does not produce by itself; solitary yang does not complete itself.”

Hence, Heaven and Earth mingle, all things mature and ripen. Male and female unite their essences, all things are born. This is the constant dao, simply daily use. Stillness is the “clarity and stillness” mentioned earlier in the Scripture of Clarity and Stillness. Silence is the “constant silence” also from that scripture. Concealment is the “hidden” from the Scripture of the Heart Seal. Quietness is the “silent morning” also from the Heart Seal Scripture.

### Marvelously Surpassing Yin and Yang, Mysteriously Transcending the Limitless.

Without desire one perceives marvels; with desire one sees boundaries. The sun and moon join to form the elixir; Heaven and Earth join to form the Great Elixir. Body and mind both still, entering the profound darkness, and one yang returns; Earth’s thunder shakes, turning into a realm of trance. Then one condenses spirit into the qi cavity; fire presses on metal, and metal fills the full moon. The medicine solidifies—this is the功 (achievement) of holding possession. Gathering what is not gathered, taking what is not taken.

Extending beyond the self yet cultivating the self, forgetting form yet form remains—this is the功 (achievement) of preserving nothingness. Boiling and refining, gathering medicine into the cauldron. Sealing and solidifying, true gold fills the belly and accumulates into the elixir—this is the功 (achievement) of holding possession. Once the returning elixir is obtained, acting without acting, nothing is not done; the primordial spirit soars beyond, shattering emptiness—this is the功 (achievement) of preserving nothingness.

### Bestowing the Supreme Secret of the Golden Elixir, Universally Ferrying Future Generations. Unfolding the Lineage Transmission, Mysterious Descendants for Ten Thousand Ages.

Patriarch Qiu Chuji was revered by the rulers of the Southern Song, Jin, and Mongol empires as well as by the vast peoples. At the age of seventy-four, he journeyed far west to persuade Genghis Khan to cease killing and cherish the people, becoming renowned worldwide. After attaining the dao, Patriarch Qiu passed the alchemical secret to future generations, universally ferrying all. Especially after his single word to halt slaughter, the Longmen lineage and even the entire Complete Reality School greatly flourished. The Longmen lineage spread throughout the nation, becoming one of the largest Daoist schools, with the saying “Longmen owns half the world” still told today.

### The Complete Reality School Master. Vast Virtue and Gracious Mentor. Patriarch of Eternal Spring’s Wondrous Dao. Revealer of the Profound and Grand Dao True Person. Heavenly Venerable Who Broadly Aids and Universally Ferries All.

In the fourth year of the Yuan Zheng era, Genghis Khan decreed the renaming of the Tianchang Temple to Eternal Spring Palace (today’s White Cloud Temple in Beijing), presenting the “Golden Tiger Plaque,” entrusting all Daoist affairs to the immortals, and appointing Patriarch Qiu to oversee all monastics under Heaven. During the reign of Emperor Shizu of Yuan, he was posthumously honored as the True Person, Master of Eternal Spring and Revealer of the Dao.

Beijing’s White Cloud Temple is the site of Patriarch Qiu’s crane platform relic. The Taixu Palace in Qixia, Shandong, is his birthplace. The Panxi Palace in Baoji, Shaanxi, is where he endured hardship and attained the dao. Longmen Cave in Long County, Baoji, Shaanxi, is the founding ancestral seat of the Longmen lineage he transmitted. Besides Longmen Cave, White Cloud Temple, Taixu Palace, and Panxi Palace all chiefly venerate Patriarch Qiu and serve as ancestral seats of the Longmen lineage.

Patriarch Qiu’s holy birthday is the nineteenth day of the first lunar month, known as the Yanjiu Festival.
