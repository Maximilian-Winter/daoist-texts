### The Numinous Treasure Eightfold Majestic Divine Strategy Formula

When inscribing the vermilion script invoking the Three Heavens’ Most High to summon and subdue the flood dragons, tigers, leopards, and mountain spirits, write it upon a single silverwood plank. Another plank records the year, month, and the master’s surname and given name. Bind these two planks together in a pouch. The vermilion script of the secondary text is written on a third plank, placed outside the pouch. These three planks sealed together form the Divine Strategy, as tradition holds.

Each plank is made of silverwood, measuring one foot four inches in length and two inches four fen in width. The pouch is sewn from crimson-patterned silk, measuring one zhang two chi in length. Dress the pouch, seal it on the outer plank, and at the bottom imprint the seal of the Five Elders of Primordial Origin within the mouth of the seal.

One must place the pouch in a cypress box, clothed in crimson silk embroidered with patterns. The box is kept with the strategy texts in a separate chamber. Burn incense on the left and right, with focused reverence and offerings, then wear it on the person. The divine spirits of the world attend the gate morning and evening, providing each of the Five Emperors with twelve jade youths and jade maidens. When going out or roaming, the Five Emperors’ guards accompany them; the Three Realms’ officials receive them. Birth and death no longer suffer the threefold calamities. Without passing through Mount Tai, one ascends directly to the Nine Heavens, clothed and fed naturally, attaining a rank equal to the Supreme Ultimate—thus one truly becomes immortal.

Those Dao cultivators who receive this text wear it and perform the divine incantations. When pointing the strategy text to Heaven, the heavenly spirits descend. Pointing to Earth, the earth deities bow and the Three Realms are bound. Pointing to the spirits, the spirits pay homage. Pointing to ghosts, the ghosts vanish in clarity. Pointing to water, the water spirits respond. When the great kalpa arrives, with floods and four calamities, use the strategy to summon the dragons, which bear the burden. Through long cultivation and accumulating resonance, divine spirits gather and meet; wherever one applies the summons, it rises and stands firm. A thousand transformations and myriad changes follow the will. In coming and going, one’s rank aligns with the Supreme Ultimate, always led by flying dragons before, followed by heavenly balances, phoenix cries and luan calls, twelve radiant lights establishing the bi-color festival banners of life’s spirit. With nine years of concentrated thought, the heavenly apparatus is fully prepared.
