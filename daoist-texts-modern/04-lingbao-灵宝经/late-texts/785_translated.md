The Most High Great Dao Lord said: The Primordial Heavenly Venerable spoke, “When the great kalpa of the Radiant Light and the United Realm comes to its end, its radiance is boundless, its light bottomless, impossible to rest upon. The sun and moon cannot illuminate it; the constellations cannot mark it. There is no above or below, no place to rely upon or reach; its numbers are beyond exhaust.”

The Dao said: “No above, no below, weaving and gathering the cycles, light as a thread through the calendar, sinking into the empty mystery. These two share the same name, thought and contemplation vast and silent, turning back to become one again, ultimately profound and round. Above it rings at the utmost peak, below it sinks into the finest dust, left it reaches the vast azure, right it connects the myriad rivers. The Great Net’s canopy arrayed, the Dipper severed touching the dark, the Mysterious Capital’s Primordial Lord, the numinous currents whirl and hide, towering mountains and deep valleys, all turned over and merged. Having cultivated the six perfections, the Brahmanical conduct in dual places, ascending the celestial gates, Heaven’s traces vast and clear, the root of void and nothingness profound. The minor cycle flows around, the transport of beginnings opens, the heavens revolve, the fiery degrees meet their appointed time, the earths respond in number, all lightly turning as well. Heaven is high without limit at the cavern’s source. Heaven uses the soaring tree as the proper framework and order; Earth uses the human and bird, dwelling in the fiery smoke. When the minor kalpa’s cycle comes, it ascends to the high heavens, transported by Heaven’s movement, never ceasing the secret gate. Thus the myriad spirits record and note, called the crossing of Heaven and Earth’s numbers; the minor kalpa has crossed.”

The Primordial Heavenly Venerable measures this revolving crossing number, thirty-six thousand kalpas in time, called the Minor Heavenly Wind Cycle, the crossing of the minor kalpa. The Great Heaven has three thousand nine hundred and sixty heavens, encompassing the ten directions’ myriad minor heavens. Each heaven governs true persons; each has ten-direction true persons. Every three hundred years they pass once, revolving around this soaring tree and human-bird mountain, thus named the Minor Heavenly Cycle crossing the minor kalpa’s circuit. The true persons emerge from today’s center of Heaven within the Great Heaven. The Great Heaven has three thousand nine hundred and sixty great kalpas; the Radiant Light true person reverently completes the cycle of this heaven, named the minor kalpa’s transport cycle.

The Primordial Heavenly Venerable spoke to the Radiant Light true person: “Heaven has a hundred billion great heavens; Earth has a hundred billion cavern heavens. One heaven spans three hundred and sixty thousand kalpas, its years passing together, called the Minor Heaven. This heaven has great cavern township true persons. When the minor kalpa’s transport cycle completes, it returns to its foundation; the five stars of the Big Dipper, the seven registers, the chief stars begin to form; the sun and moon shine bright; the celestial origin is newly governed. At that time, the Mysterious Transport emerges to transform; the Dao flows and responds. The Lady of Great Numinous Purple Origin emerges from the Numinous Radiance Heaven, with about ten female flying immortals, seeking the Mysterious Transport afar. At that time, they were at the Five Great Mountains, pacifying this fiery smoke, clearing disasters, suppressing all evils. The celestial beings saw the Mysterious Transport, responding in the ten utmost voids of space with reverence.”

The Lady said: “In ancient kalpas before the crossing, the Heavenly Venerable, the Most True, already saw and descended with his words, expounding the ancient Numinous Treasure Scripture’s subordinate volumes, storing them in the Great Mysterious Cavern Township. Those with immortal bones see its scripture. Later, the Supreme Ultimate true person, before attaining the Dao, often dwelled among the world, wandering mountains to gather herbs. From age seven to ninety, never killing living beings, always cultivating the world’s scriptures, taking the Lord Lao’s *Dao De* and myriad scriptures as his practice, penetrating subtle mysteries within. The spirits and true beings fully sufficed, wherever he roamed, not questioning the hidden mountains and deep valleys, dense forests and rocky cliffs, places of sheer ravines. Later, in the cave of the Martial Person Mountain, he saw the Primordial Lord’s traces of attainment, the true text of the Eight Elements’ interwoven bands, the wondrous scripture: ‘Most High Mysterious Cavern Numinous Treasure Minor Kalpa Transport Number Wondrous Scripture.’ Scholars should pass this to their sons, to harmonize the numbers of Heaven and Earth’s transport, crossing the hundred billion numbers to their end. The Mysterious Transport descends again, fearing the great number’s approach—how could one pass it? The minor kalpa is seen.”

The Primordial Heavenly Venerable spoke to the Mysterious Transport true person: “Numbers follow the one hundred and sixty, born in the last cycle. At that time, there was a husband of immortal bones; I myself taught him the method to transcend the body. Scholars should constantly seek to surpass fiery disasters; those crossing smoke and calamity should learn the Three Caverns’ wondrous scriptures, establishing the Numinous Treasure fasting method. If among the human world, one should set up a high seat and precious canopy, splendid lamps and incense machines, morning and evening worship six times daily, one meal at midday. If one abandons worldly affairs far away, dwelling in mountain forests or deep valleys, the fasting method is to stand alone in the Dao, long fasting, only swallowing breath and taking the elixir, always sitting upright, left hand turning toward the North Pole star, saying: ‘On a certain auspicious day of a certain month, firmly establish the field of blessing, wishing the Most High North Pole to transport the form of so-and-so.’ Hold breath three times, perform this six times daily, and one will obtain the true Dao. When the heavenly transport of the minor kalpa crosses, the Mysterious Transport true person uses this secret text of nine talismans to transport.”

The Primordial Heavenly Venerable said: “The nine talismans are nine chapters. They correspond to the Most High’s nine strategic texts. Wearing the Numinous Treasure, one carries these nine talisman water texts, which are the Mysterious Cavern’s numinous chapter texts. Recite the scripture while wearing them on the body. The elixir’s script and plain registers turn the talisman; place them in a pouch and carry them to ward off the crossing of the minor kalpa—this is the secret.”

The secret talisman texts are the Most High Mysterious Cavern’s concealed strategies. Scholars wear them on the body, constantly chanting these nine chapter sounds, and the true Dao descends naturally.

The Primordial Heavenly Venerable said: “The three elements are Purple Essence, Yellow Essence, and White Essence. Now each is a Most High Mysterious Cavern Numinous One True Person; the three essences combine as three true persons, always governing the current administration.”

The scripture says: The Numinous Treasure Dharma Master establishes fasting methods and ritual garments. The ritual skirt is made of yellow cloth; underneath is the mud pellet silk. The mud pellet silk’s method is to wear a blue horizontal banner as a cape, yellow silk as a headscarf. Cold or summer, the Dao does not change; this is always the ritual garment, always guarded by divine males and jade maidens.

The scripture says: The ritual garment, if in mountain forests or secluded places, establishing fasting methods, the skirt, brown headscarf, and cape are all made of deer skin. However, one must not fast with the world’s people wearing the same garments. If among worldly scholars, one must follow the scripture and not wear mountain study ritual garments wandering out into the human world; human clothing must not enter the mountains. This also violates the scripture and breaks precepts; the great true beings of the heavens observe the loss of proper conduct and law, laughed at by demon kings, the true spirits do not respond, the profound spirits do not appear. In ancient times, before the Most Wonderful Heavenly True Person attained the Dao, he cultivated the Numinous Treasure Dharma without following ritual prescriptions, wearing mountain study ritual garments roaming out into the world. When the true Dao was about to be completed, he became a fasting master for a kingdom’s family, thus violating the ritual garment precepts and breaking the true Dao. Later he became a true person of the Five Great Mountains, now dwelling in the world. When the minor kalpa’s numbers are exhausted, this true person attains one ascent of the kalpa’s height. From this true secret precept breaking, the nine crossings of Heaven and Earth are broken; after crossing the minor cycle ten times, when the cycle is about to complete, the true person roams the numinous mountains but has not yet ascended the ten utmost voids. Thus, this ritual garment is not made according to ritual regulations. Scholars, be cautious! When the heavenly transport’s minor cycle completes ten times, this true person will return to be a hidden true person among the ten directions’ numbers.”

The scripture says: “Also, there is a Dharma Master who cultivates the Mysterious Cavern fasting method, thus not yet extinct. In the world, he offers the precious scriptures, governs precepts and cultivates Dao practice, having accumulated time. Mistakenly wearing worldly ritual garments into the mountains, he thus cannot attain the Dao. At that time, three jade maidens appeared, wearing nine-embroidered capes, purple silk belts, hair tied in three looped horns, wearing orchid-embroidered scarves, feet shod with nine-dragon patterned shoes, holding transport numinous banners, burning elixirs mixed with nine-colored fragrant incense. They played and laughed, saying: ‘The heavenly transport is about to end; who understands it?’ Then an ancient immortal appeared, seeing these jade maidens as no ordinary people, immediately bowed and made reverence. The jade maiden at first did not look, saying: ‘You are an ancient wise lord; why suddenly bow?’ The jade maiden then rose, wandering uneasily. Two more jade maidens came, each holding a scroll of wondrous scripture, saying: ‘Lady of Purple Tenuity sent us with these eight articles, from the center of Heaven, not to be shared with worldly people. The scripture is secret, not to be revealed here.’”

## The Radiant Light True Person’s Discourse on the Completion of the Great and Minor Kalpas and the Creation of the Minor Kalpa Transport

Fearing that no seed people would remain after, he thus fashioned the minor kalpa transport, saying: “Those who have the true contract and can cross it shall cultivate and keep it secret.” The eight seasonal festivals use jade slips.

## The Radiant Light True Person’s Hymn for Creating Seed People to Transcend the Kalpa

“Revolving cycles completed, rites traversing emptiness.  
Ascending to the Numinous Cloud lodge, descending into the Abyssal Subtle Palace.  
Dwelling round and square above, contemplating the treasure chamber township.  
The number of crossings is not many; Heaven’s transport plainly speaks afar.  
At the time of flourishing origin completing the palace, the eight extremes constantly come and return.  
The three are one contract; why is the rite’s transformation so late?  
The six directions come and go fully; the world’s fortune is long and great.  
Golden horses shine with essence; their words will bring peace and prosperity.  
Who traces wisdom’s path? Thoughts within and without the origin.  
The framework and order all at once end; the one hundred and sixty numbers converge.  
The three essences appear in cycle; the Heavenly Emperor’s honored place.  
The past did not form seed; Heaven and Earth’s transport will overturn.  
How can one surpass it? Looking up, recalling the Numinous Treasure’s words.  
Responsive power can cross disasters; grasp the season, chant the jade chapter.”

At the time of the transport cycle’s crossing, the Radiant Light true person finished this hymn, then summoned the Wind Elder and myriad minor heavenly true beings to gather. When the cycle’s number ended, they created and established myriad minor heavens anew. The true person now divides form, becoming ten great heavenly venerables, roaming and observing the Five Pollutions, the Numinous Treasure’s ten extreme true persons. Now those who truly receive the teaching and scriptures shall become these ten-direction true persons. Though the text is not yet obtained, by day they fly and ascend, seeing the Dharma and then turning the wheel, becoming minor heavenly true persons.

The Primordial Heavenly Venerable said: “The minor kalpa is the true person’s threefold perfect completion of Heaven; Heaven’s numbers cross Earth; Earth’s numbers universally gather, named the minor kalpa transport cycle. At that time, all heavens, sun, moon, and stars vanish; all earth’s beams and frameworks have no root or origin. Then the three Radiant Lords transform and save myriad lesser saints who have not attained truth, fearing the present cycle’s end. They say: ‘In the past, there was one Mysterious Transport, born naturally from the nine hidden subtle voids, radiant and youthful in appearance, holding the Eight Divisions’ Most High Primordial Cavern Quiet Numinous Treasure Two Essence True Scriptures. The Eight Divisions descended to report to the Five Great Mountains, pacifying past disasters and calamities, settling the fiery smoke and the universe, arranging the eight trigrams and records, bestowing them to the Supreme Ultimate true person.’ Opening the Three Worthies’ playful observation, the transport crosses you. One jade maiden holds a scroll to pacify the fiery crying river of the minor kalpa’s jade script, said to have been given to the morning township’s celestial being Xia Yu. This can serve the myriad heavens to teach during great disasters, as in the past. The ancient immortal now becomes the Supreme Ultimate, master of the immortal’s record and traces.”

The scripture says: “True persons, before Yao, received the Jade Maiden of Heavy Net Heaven to pacify fiery smoke, annotating the minor kalpa wondrous scripture, now sinking to teach the method of body transcendence. The scripture states:

Circling and returning, the framework ends, mountains and seas hidden, mighty spirits arrive.  
Departing and returning, sun and moon eclipsed, chief stars transform, now arrived.”

The Primordial Heavenly Venerable said: “The Great Mystery has six Wus, vast and clear, stirring and sweeping, responding to endless cycles, teaching observation of the void and distance, ascending high, steep and cliffless, ten utmost voids with no standing, vast and empty wandering, dark kalpa shifting transport, five stars incomplete, constellations reversed, the cycle’s number ends, sun and moon lose light, yang’s grace unharmonious, time’s qi lost, Heaven and Earth leaking, Five Mountains sinking, blessed lands flooding hills, gaining passage to shade, gathering into the past. The Three Realms fly; at that time all people are utterly gone. The great true beings of the heavens refine the crossing bones to unite with the Dao, recording the Yellow Essence name. Thus the cycle ends, the cavern merges into emptiness and establishes the great township, facing the ten utmost voids without cliffs. The North Pole’s past and future great numbers, together with the great number, enter the conquest of emptiness, emptiness creates void, its name hard to exhaust.”

The Great Net true person said: “The Dao can be spoken but is not constantly discussed. Words are names but can also be nameless, called hidden. The lower three return to void; the great enters vast openness; the fine reaches no depth; secretly moving within the empty township, brilliantly shining in the cavern palace, the four rivers as cavern gates. The past dwelling is the great township of elixir refinement.”

The Primordial Supreme Ultimate true person and the Mysterious Transport true person, at the minor kalpa cavern gate, expound the Dao of cycle’s end, recording the cavern township’s mountains. The mountains have cavern heavens; the cavern heavens have four gates—this is the great cavern gate. Upon reaching this gate, the learner naturally attains transcendence.

The Most High Great Dao Lord said: The Primordial Heavenly Venerable said, “When the great and minor kalpas end, the appointed time approaches. The Dao Lord thus speaks of birth, names, different flows, multiplying kinds. The high dwell above; the low return below. The great returns to rest, one origin as its circle. The small settles into the fine; the origin lies within. Dividing form to be born, sometimes dwelling high or low, sometimes born within great or small, sometimes rooted and born, sometimes gestated and carried, sometimes waxing and waning, sometimes transforming naturally, sometimes born in void and without qi. At first no form or shadow is seen, sinking into the hidden to be born. Such are the various blessings and responses, all following transformation, all according to origin. When its number ends, those with many blessings have unending crossing, following class to begin life. If rooted and born, it enhances its radiance and beauty. Like trees born of the seven treasure talisman in the Numinous Treasure kingdom’s seven treasure forest, when myriad immortals and great saints come to observe, the great and minor kalpas end, cycle and transform, becoming the human path. Cultivating the text’s meaning, one sees all true beings, the Numinous Treasure’s radiance shining, widely hanging tenfold. If gestated, previous life’s blessings are heavy, born in the womb, with form and body, soul and spirit conjoined, naturally receiving the words of the Supreme Sovereign. The Primordial Heavenly Venerable and the Most High Lord Lao, at the Mysterious Capital’s upper township, Jade Capital, and Lesser Chamber, expound the Most High Mysterious Cavern Numinous Treasure’s thirty-six divisions of wondrous treasures scripture. At that time, the Most High Lord Lao used the calculation of primordial void’s lifespan and the number of infinity. Before reaching the Supreme Sovereign, the world’s cycles revolve, fortune and blessing about to cross, rituals changing and transforming, circling and ascending the kalpa’s height, stars and constellations dividing and breaking, constellations renewing, Five Mountains transforming, changing directions and towns, four rivers swept away, seas forming mountains, waters becoming giant stones, insects flying and crawling all living beings, forming and suddenly crossing like thirty-two thousand kinds of people. The Primordial Heavenly Venerable Lord Lao expounded five thousand texts of Dao and virtue, upper, middle, and lower scriptures, the Three Caverns’ true texts, myriad essential wondrous scriptures, teaching later learners. His words say:

‘White Stone Lord, empty surname.  
At Human-Bird Mountain, received the learning method of four hundred thousand words.  
Stopping at this mountain, establishing fasting and uprightness,  
Vegetables and grains for midday meals, repenting sins and blessings,  
Opening crossing all, seeking escape from the world’s calamities, attaining peace.  
Morning worship of the heavens, bowing to the ten directions.  
Looking up to the profound truth, Brahman and myriad heavens,  
Eight kinds of sounds, burning incense and lighting lamps,  
Reciting and circling in worship, ten extremes contemplating the Dharma,  
Thoughtfully dispatching floating evils, discoursing on the wondrous,  
Accumulating learning for six hundred years, returning to the Mysterious Capital’s Martial Person Mountain north chamber.  
Further studying for two hundred years, on the twenty-fourth day of the fifth month of the year of Jiawu of the Grand Cycle, the Numinous Treasure responded with a vision.  
Suddenly twelve flying beings of seven treasures appeared, riding flying cloud chariots, from beneath the Nine Mysterious Terraces, immediately taking positions to welcome the Primordial Void Lord, White Stone Empty Cavern true person, floating and flying up, ascending the Nine Glories, teaching and transforming myriad immortals, learning the true immortal’s arts and methods.  
On the tenth day of the ninth month of the Great Sovereign’s first year, the Turtle Mountain King’s wife came to receive the Eight Births’ Primordial Record upper scripture in eight scrolls.  
On the fifth day of the tenth month, Chi Songzi received the Great Cavern Treasure Chapter’s thirty-six divisions of wondrous scriptures, the Three Caverns’ true ritual Dao and virtue essentials at the Mysterious Capital’s Treasure City Mountain, breaking gold and casting fish, binding dragons with hooks, ascending the altar with one treasure trust as pledge.  
Using flying cloud brocade one hundred feet, two jade talismans, two golden dragons, one pair of fish, twenty-four swords, forty feet of white silk, five-direction bright mirrors to transport the text.  
At that time Brahman and myriad heavens’ eight kinds of sounds made three contract hymns, receiving learning and thus attaining the true immortal’s Dao, speaking and leading the kalpa’s height Mysterious Cavern palace, named Empty Cavern Primordial One Lord, Great Light Lord, Lord Lao, Supreme One Lord’s dwelling township, at the boundless cliffless subtle image monitoring Mara, in the great thousand Three Caverns, originally having the Great Essence true ritual, Numinous Treasure ritual most wondrous.  
One is Empty Cavern True Guard, Great Cavern Fasting Method, Pure Spirit Praise Scripture as hymn, making Luo Heaven mysterious sound cavern fasting method, Jade Capital Mountain scripture step void hymn, Brahman Heaven sound cavern divine fasting method, Eight Essences Yin-Yang scripture, Central Xia sound Great Cavern fasting method, disappearing traces cliff hidden, far escaping the world, long fasting and food, swallowing primordial qi, not joining the world.  
Not their food and long fasting’s spread, differing from lectures.  
The ten directions’ highest saints and heavenly venerables observe human good and evil, named Most High Supreme True Mysterious Wondrous Fasting Method.  
Establish fasting and stand alone in the Dao, Primordial Void Lord at Human-Bird Mountain receiving the Most High Mysterious Cavern Brahman Heaven’s majesty, Luo Heaven’s great precepts, repenting sins and blessings of countless ancestors, seven generations of parents’ birth and death, the cycle of rebirth and gestation’s calamities, wishing to dwell long in non-action, burning incense and lighting lamps, one meal at midday, repenting six times daily, past and future ancestors all ascending Heaven, transforming and giving birth in the ten directions, walking with the Mysterious Capital.  
Reciting the Three Caverns’ true texts, at that time the Numinous Treasure true person’s cloud light descended, ten extremes’ flying beings, divine males and jade females about ten each, Brahman myriad sounds, seven treasures shining brilliantly in Jade Capital, reciting the three contract Luo Heaven hymns.  
Ten extreme true persons each chant one contract, Brahman hymn flying beings divine males and jade females together present a poem.  
Primordial Void Lord then descends, bows to the Heavenly Venerable, then receives the poem:

‘Chapter of numinous wondrous supreme truth,  
The Primordial Lord regards it as supreme.’  

Primordial Void Lord replies with a poem in the mystery, then suddenly vanishes.  
Wherever the true beings go, White Stone Lord’s learning is true.”
