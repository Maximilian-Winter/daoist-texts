**The Dao speaks:**  
The Most High Numinous Treasure was born before Heaven and Earth; only then did Heaven and Earth come into being. Numbers arise from the One, establish in Three, complete in Five, flourish in Seven, and reach their peak in Nine. Thus, Heaven is nine myriad li removed from Earth, accumulating yang energy. The Dao’s yin and forms arrayed across Kunlun serve as Earth’s pillars. The qi ascending through Kunlun is Earth’s central core. Kunlun stretches directly east one hundred sixty-five million li, directly west one hundred sixty-five million li, directly south one hundred sixty-five million li, and directly north one hundred sixty-six million seven hundred fifty thousand li. Earth revolves four times around, spanning four hundred two thousand six hundred fifty li.

**The Dao speaks:**  
The sun and moon traverse a thousand li in diameter, circling three thousand li, moving through eighty-one domains, shifting in hazy obscurity. The Northern Dipper’s nine stars, two of which are yin and unseen, are nine myriad li apart, nourishing eighty-one provinces and eight hundred ten regions. The Northern Dipper stands above Kunlun, embracing it; its qi flows and governs the world. Spring and summer bring dew and frost; autumn and winter bring frost and snow. Humans share the same nature as Heaven and Earth. Beyond the eight directions of Heaven and Earth, all things possess nature, yet all harbor sorrow and suffering, constantly wounding the people, writhing with blood, unable to be free, contending with Heaven and Earth for life, all destined to return to death. Their bones dissolve into Earth, their spirit soars, wandering through the Five Paths. The good ascend to Heaven; the evil descend into the abyss. Whatever good or evil deeds one does in life, the spirit and soul follow their merits and faults. Only those who study the Dao and seek life, who reach the utmost cycles and transcendence, can endure long, returning to the yang cycle of nine.

**The Dao speaks:**  
When a person is born, passing through the womb, they endure ten months’ days. Death comes like a great wind, sudden and without schedule; death arrives without time. One must contend with the heart, doing good without doubt. Therefore, through the Dao and scripture, scholars are urged: what the eyes cannot see, what the ears cannot hear, rare and wondrous treasures—what use are they to the body? Those who cultivate the Dao must trust the scripture’s admonitions, guard goodness unto death, avoid evil and live. The Dao must not be lost; virtue must not be violated. To violate the Dao and lose virtue is like a child born without a mother, like a fish escaping the abyss. If one is determined to learn, the cycle of death and rebirth is like a silkworm in its cocoon, confused and muddled. Thus, in a single day, form and number change; the Dao is formed in subtlety. Long fasting and reciting scripture are the roots of virtue. The natural profound understanding of cycles and transcendence suffices beyond the numinous methods of the spirit, attaining the honor of the Most High Jade Capital. Then a verse is composed:

> I alone, in waning years, must endure all ailments.  
> Ice melts and fire rises, disasters strike to dissolve the form.  
> All bones separate and live apart; the great kalpa threatens collapse.  
> Therefore I fear this pain, seeking the Dao to live long.  
> Leaving behind worldly burdens, meeting that utmost stillness and purity.  
> High conduct aspires to the great vehicle; naturally, the Dao is learned and fulfilled.  
> The cycle revolves with unsurpassed virtue; forgetting self, thus nameless.  
> Quiet wisdom crosses eight hardships; carefree, what is there to pursue?

**The Dao speaks:**  
Among all beings, only humans are precious in life. Having life, one should cherish and complete it. Yet greed for wealth and stinginess refuse to give freely. Serving masters and treasures to seek transcendence—who truly reflects on this? The body is not truly one’s own; wealth and treasures are not truly possessed; official rank and salary are heavy burdens on the body—what benefit are they to oneself? Old age, sickness, and death cannot be turned back. Unable to save oneself by the Dao, one adorns oneself thickly, claiming life is enough. Like a land bird loving its tail, it is ultimately caught by the hunter’s arrow. Those who study must diligently strive to ascend the heart’s accord, knowing these do not follow the soul and spirit upon departure, only bringing suffering. One must think to sever the root of transcendence, cut off the three evil paths, and enter the three good paths: first, no aging; second, no sickness; third, no death. Long life transcends the world and removes calamities, meeting the cycle to become a guest of the Most High. Then a verse is composed:

> Reflecting on old age and sickness, the great afflictions of the Three Realms.  
> Fortune spent, life near its end, qi exhausted entering the coffin.  
> Darkly becoming dust and ash, soul and spirit find no rest.  
> Therefore I fear this, learning the Dao without premature death.  
> Gathering intention to preserve true reality, a pure heart worthy of regard.  
> Dwelling in the Three Treasures’ enclosure, naturally subduing demonic officials.  
> Thus I lessen the body and give, aspiring beyond life and death’s shore.  
> In confusion, no more waiting—forever preserving joy for myriad ages.

**The Dao speaks:**  
To cultivate long life, one’s aspiration is transcendence, seeking the Dao of non-action, the body surpassing dust and filth, leaving no trace among the myriad directions. One must first know the great cycle and period of Heaven and Earth’s operation, the yang nine hundred and six calamities; removing calamity brings peace. If one does not do so, though seeking the Dao all year, hoping to ascend, one will only waste effort, ultimately futile labor. Now I reveal to you the period of kalpa cycles, their fullness and contraction, to preserve the body and seek life, thus inviting longevity—not only for one body but also for the seven ancestors returning to the womb. The Immortal Master says: those who study the Dao deeply and can understand the yang nine hundred and six cycles will surely transcend the world without danger or collapse. The key lies in long fasting and deep meditation, distancing from worldly affairs, imagining and forgetting burdens—only then can one expect the flesh to fly. If even a hair remains unexhausted, it cannot be called eternal. Seek the Most Supreme True Person’s ten dharma verses:

> Red script governs earth’s emergence; gold and jade return to husband.  
> Azure Dragon meets Jia Shen; who can know its sudden arrival?  
> Though bearing heavenly water patterns, the treasure awaits the prince’s time.  
> The color of the stars will change; first the Hu children are seen.  
> Kun Yuan fills most fully; piled stones next cannot be governed.  
> Whispering, the scholar ascends; after Heaven serves Heaven’s time.  
> Fortune is not a single morning’s passing; seven leaves accumulate the foundation of virtue.  
> Peace accords at Mengjin; joyous and serene indeed.

> Profound cycles end at Golden Horse; the ancient moon invades Divine Land.  
> On land no sons remain; brothers wander in turn.  
> The sons of He and Luo are all gone; Yan and Zhao become a great flood.  
> Jing and Yang follow next; at Si hour, the central mountain talisman.  
> All grains end after ten years; the East Sea roams among mulberries.  
> One should first enter the blessed land, refining the body with eight stones.

> At the time of the water dragon, the Immortal Lord rises.  
> Eighteen sons at Bow Mouth chant in harmony.

> Thorns grow in the courtyard; kings and nobles fall to robbers.  
> Wives and daughters lost in foreign lands; servitude never at peace.  
> Showing off and selling is truly pitiful; will a thousand years meet again?  
> If at the end one learns the Dao early, the home aspires to the misty sky.

> Cultivating all ritual wines, governing methods must be diligent.  
> Not careful in one hundred eighty days, when time comes it is like fire’s burn.  
> Recently in the Jin era, thinking thus is appropriate.  
> Swords and knives rush forth; one day cannot be delayed.  
> Then great floods gather, vast and connected with Heaven.  
> Walking corpses nowhere to be seen; sages know this is true.  
> First learning to awaken the Profound Capital, the heart’s space meets famous mountains.  
> Gathering in the winning place, the supreme Dao is indeed the numinous ancestor.

> The capital recounts brush and ink; blessed lands are indeed approachable.

> Ten thousand li look without smoke; Ren Chen has not yet ended disaster.  
> Once pacified, the Immortal Lord governs; eight directions cease their nets.  
> Like my jade axe’s favor, forever thanking the dust of the world.

> It begins at Ren Chen; the morning star shines upon the water mother.  
> After Shen, lingering ten decades; great birds gather southeast.  
> Born blood within city gates; many mice climb tall trees.  
> Countless cannot be stopped; women enter the palace.  
> Clouds and dragons incomparable; fools say otherwise, the wise stand firm.

**The Dao speaks:**  
The Numinous Treasure’s natural cycles have great yang nine, great hundred six, small yang nine, small hundred six. Three thousand three hundred years make small yang nine and small hundred six; nine thousand nine hundred years make great yang nine and great hundred six. Heavenly calamity is called yang nine; Earth’s loss is called hundred six. After the Jin family, in the Jia Shen year, this is the cycle of Heaven and Earth’s operation, the coming of yang nine. At that time, Dao and virtue will be clear; evil and ugliness suddenly vanish; the sage lord receives his mandate in the Ren Chen year. These are the Most Supreme True Person’s ten dharma verses, their divine intent wondrous and smooth, subtle meaning clear and vast, the numbers of the cycle, the essentials of coming and going—truly detailed, truly complete.

**The Dao speaks:**  
If one can constantly recite the profound rhyme, one will transcend the great calamity at yang nine, receive office and mandate at Ding Hai. It is best first to long fast and quietly chant, silently cutting off noisy burdens, then seek to release and understand the subtle meaning, emitting clear sounds from lips and mouth. Thus the seven ancestors return to the womb, one’s own body endures long, the cycles run their course without harm, receiving immortality and ascending. Marvelous and subtle, beyond words to declare. If you encounter this, you will reach the upper stream Jade Capital, becoming the sage emperor who shepherds and governs the people.

**The Dao speaks:**  
The method of transmission and reception, as I call the ancient canon, is to fast purely for twenty-four days, separately presenting five taels of superior gold, one hundred feet of brocade from the elixir land, as a solemn pledge. The receiver must respectfully observe and carry it out. If one transmits recklessly without following the method, the wind blade will punish. The receiver must be diligent and cautious.
