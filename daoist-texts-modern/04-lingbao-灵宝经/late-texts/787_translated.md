Throughout the boundless expanse, the Supreme Emperor sets forth rites, summons demons, commands spirits, subdues the myriad numinous beings, revives the bones from death, rescues from all calamities, perfects the myriad dao-paths, transforms decayed corpses into immortals, gallops the dragon chariot, ascends the morning sun. This dao is exalted and wondrous, passed down but once in forty thousand kalpas. Now, at this splendid feast, joy is beyond expression; the turning of the great cosmic assembly is extraordinary, and the principle cannot be concealed. Now, it is time to universally proclaim to the thirty-two heavens, the unity of perfect truth and harmony, to unfold and recite the numinous chapter.

Summoned is the Golden Numinous Supreme Palace Flying Profound Jade Maiden of Western Splendor, the Venerable Sage Jinghuang, who strums the five-stringed qin, the Dragon of Light clouds the jade drum, blowing the nine phoenix flutes, beating the divine land’s sheng pipes. The myriad heavens each perform the divine dragon’s music, countless varieties without measure; the jade tones are pure and clear, flowing and stirring for thousands of fathoms. The sun, moon, and stars shine together as one. The four energies harmonize, scattering fragrant dew; the heavens hold no vaporous veil, the earth no foul dust. The mysterious chart responds, numinous auspices arise naturally; the earth’s treasury bursts forth, revealing forms of gold and jade dew.

The deafened open their hearing, the six ailments are all healed, the dead souls return to their root, withered bones become human again. The rivers and seas calm their waves, the mountains swallow their mists; dragons leap and dance, fish and birds beat their scales and wings. Life and death rest together; humans and spirits rejoice; the five sufferings all dissolve; the three paths are all restored; forever freed from dark night, reborn into the heavenly paradise.

This day is a grand assembly, never before seen; the heavenly功 flows freely, all beings are delivered wondrously, transformation spreads to the Ten Directions. The Dao Lord bows and chants praises, raising his palms to harmonize the void cavern; all the heavens rejoice universally, each composing hymns:

On this day of great celebration, the thirty-two heavenly emperor lords and attendant heavenly venerables all ride the eight scenic jade lifts, the three elements fly with clouds, jade wheels and feathered canopies, circling light descending together. The Most High Dao Lord at the Western Na Jade Kingdom, on Mount Yu Cha of the Floating Luo Peak, at this time the land’s numinous auspices arise naturally; the earth’s treasury bursts forth, revealing forms of gold and jade dew, spreading over the roads; golden beasts roam the land; pearls and jade adorn the steps; seven treasures and tassels beyond measure; dragons, qilin, tigers, leopards, lions, and spirit beasts; groups lament and cry, crouching beside the paths; phoenixes and peacocks fly and soar, the three lights shine together; purple numinous clouds entwine fourfold; incense and blossoms flow and scatter; the heavens shine brightly; the supreme saints rejoice; each recites the numinous chapter, unfolding the subtle words of the void cavern; harmonizing the fivefold palace tones; praising above the profound mystery of the Primordial; rejoicing below the treasured brightness of the Five Emperors. The great dharma flows freely, blessing the Ten Directions; the nine abysses open at night; pulling out all suffering roots; heaven destroys the slips and reaches; earth severs the dead souls; the three disciples are all freed; the five paths are clear and at ease; all men and women of one country attain longevity; returning to the great transformation root; universally entering the dharma gates; those with intention all attain spirits and immortals. The Western Na land is called the Abode of Long Joy and Blessing, passed down through countless kalpas, blessings and celebration beyond measure.

The Heavenly Venerable said: From this one celebration, the thirty-two heavenly great fortunes cycle through, the Five Emperors change place, the fortune of blessings returns to the Profound Single World; the northern path has dao celebration, also hard to describe now; yet this vastness is not to be reckoned with in time. Those with intention may from now diligently cultivate功德, so their names may join the Profound Capital, making the fate of coming fortunes. When the time comes, they will be born together with the Numinous Treasure True Scripture in the hall of blessings. Therefore, I repeat this to you, to recognize it secretly. The Dao Lord bows, humbly receiving these essential words.

The Ten Directions’ flying heavenly spirits inform the Most High Great Dao Lord: From revolving through the Three Realms, traversing the thirty-two heavens, enduring the great cosmic cycles, Heaven and Earth’s rise and fall, life and death follow fate, never returning the same. Until now, the Red Bright opening chart has passed nine thousand seven hundred billion kalpas; the Primordial issued command, wandering and watching the heavens, never before has there been such unspeakable joy as today. This place is where great blessing is bestowed, celebration flows endlessly; the Nine Truths descend teachings; those who hear the numinous chapter’s heavenly great saintly sound all extend blessings to ten thousand ancestors; dead souls ascend to heaven; bodies receive extinction; names enter the Purple Palace, joining blessing fate; generations born immortal; gates pure and noble; myriad demons submit to vigor; the Three Realms serve the gates; spirits and deities protect; wherever they go, all is as wished; generations never cease; long enjoy endlessness; the world has its texts; the land is peaceful. Good and faithful men and women, offering incense and lamps, see the world’s light, bodies enter non-action, receiving blessings naturally. If one can long fast, recite and chant the numinous chapter, ten thousand dao paths are formed; bodies born of water and fire, immediately attaining flight. This dao is exalted and wondrous, not to be leaked. Following the bright true profound method, passed down once in forty thousand kalpas, teaching and transforming the heavenly beings below. Thus it is told, to secretly cultivate. The Dao Lord is joyful, bows and makes reverence, receiving the supreme words; at this time all saints unanimously acclaim goodness.

**End of the Scripture of the Most High Cavernous Profound Numinous Treasure: The Scripture of the Void Cavernous Numinous Chapter**

1. According to the Dunhuang manuscript’s scroll head, there are missing parts. The *Supreme Secret Essentials* volume twenty-nine excerpt of this scripture can slightly supplement the missing text. Its content is as follows: The Most High Great Dao Lord, fasting and observing precepts at the Western Na Jade Kingdom, Mount Yu Cha of the Floating Luo Peak. Spreading golden offerings on the ground, white jade adorning the steps, seven treasures and necklaces, shining bright as the sun, yellow clouds entwined fourfold, purple mists thrice around. The Primordial Heavenly Venerable together with the myriad heavenly great saints, the Ten Directions’ ultimate truths, the Infinite Spirit Kings, heavenly immortals, flying immortals, earthly immortals, Five Emperor perfected beings, floating down from the air to the seat, radiant light shining through, two lights merging in darkness. The Most High Great Dao Lord overwhelmed with joy, steps forward to bow, reporting to the Heavenly Venerable: Today the myriad saints return to the empty mountain, all true beings rejoice, unlike the usual. Humbly praying the Heavenly Venerable to grant command to the Western Palace Supreme Profound True Person, to unfold the void cavern strings, harmonize the natural chapter, so that those who have not seen may see, those who have not heard may hear. The Heavenly Venerable is pleased and speaks of the Void Cavernous Numinous Chapter. The jade sounds of the heavens, treasured by the Supreme Palace, secret and not passed down. Now, at this splendid feast, joy is beyond expression; the turning of the great cosmic assembly is extraordinary; the principle cannot be concealed. Now it is time to universally proclaim to the thirty-two heavens, the unity of perfect truth and harmony, to unfold and recite the numinous chapter. The Dao Lord bows and chants praises; the heavens rejoice; each composes hymns. (Text continues below.)
