# Scripture of the Cavernous Mystery, Numinous Treasure, and Jade Capital Mountain’s Step into Emptiness (First Collation)

**Title of the Scripture:** Scripture of the Cavernous Mystery, Numinous Treasure, and Jade Capital Mountain’s Step into Emptiness. Also called the “Chapter on Ascending the Profound and Stepping into Emptiness.” Author unknown, roughly dating from the Eastern Jin dynasty. Part of the ancient *Numinous Treasure Scriptures*. One scroll. Source text: *Continued Daoist Canon*.

The Mysterious Capital Jade Mountain of the Profound Metropolis rises above the Three Pure Ones, colorless and dustless. Above it stands the Jade Capital’s Golden Palace, the Seven Treasures, the Mysterious Terrace, and the Purple Tenuity Upper Palace. Within dwells the Scripture of the Three Treasures of the Spirits. From the eight directions of the mountain naturally grow trees of the Seven Treasures—one tree in each direction—eight trees filling all directions, covering the heavens, embracing the Three Realms. This is the governance of the Supreme Great Luo Heaven, the Most High Limitless Void Sovereign Heavenly Venerable. The mountain’s groves and palaces are all inscribed in the registers of the sacred hosts of the heavens. Countless are the holy emperors, exalted immortals, and perfected true beings who ascend this place thrice each month, burning natural sandalwood that returns as numinous incense, scattering flying flowers of immortals, circling the Seven Treasures’ Mysterious Terrace three times while chanting hollow and profound songs. At such times, the heavens play music, with hundreds of thousands of celestial maidens whose cloud-like jade bells ring clear and true; genuine consorts sing in harmony, stirring the rhythm; immortal youths with solemn countenances sing pure melodies; jade maidens advance gracefully, dancing lightly and flowing; all radiant and majestic in their bearing. The Seven Treasures’ floral groves on the mountain shine brilliantly, their hues dazzling—vermilion fruits sparkling, all fashioned of gold and silver, pearls and jade, crystal, glaze, agate, and turquoise. The numinous wind stirs them, and their sounds form their own scales and modes, elegant and wondrous beyond compare. The heavens hear the sound and soar without ceasing their strings and songs, marveling at the perfect tones, beyond description. Divine beasts, dragons and qilin, lions, white cranes, rare birds, and phoenixes cry mournfully and leap joyfully. The Most High sounds the Law Drum of Tremors, inviting guests to the jade hall, seating them on lotus blossoms, lecturing on the Dao in serene truth, chanting the Cavernous Scripture, unfolding the profound writings, savoring the rare and obscure, delighting the assembly of immortals. At that time, the eight winds raise banners, fragrant flowers scatter intertwined, and drifting smoke thickens the mist.

The Most High proclaims: “Excellent indeed! The Nothingness beyond nothingness is called the Dao, its meaning supremely profound and mysterious. Wondrous awakening and vast tolerance endure through countless kalpas and years. The Dao is originally obscure speech entrusted in two chapters, foretelling the ability to maintain long fasts and deep contemplation, reciting the Cavernous Scripture, knocking teeth and swallowing saliva, breathing in the Great Harmony, the body shining with golden radiance, the nape bearing a round light, the head adorned with the sun’s radiance, the moon’s essence, and mysterious brilliance; the hands grasp the numinous talisman, the ten supreme banners. This virtue is lofty, the supreme of the Dao, solemn and mysterious in transformation—the Most High’s perfected true being. He will stir the Great Nothingness, move the Old Heaven, summon the flying dragons, and bring down the celestial immortals. The Three Realms and Nine Earths, the cycles of great kalpas, the nine hundred and six movements of yang, the calamities of water and fire—all are dissolved and transformed by the Jade Clarity’s supreme Dao. The Three Cavernous True Scriptures, the Divine True Precious Writings, golden scripts and jade characters, phoenix scripts and dragon compilations—all return to the Supreme Great Luo Heaven, within the Jade Capital’s Seven Treasures Mysterious Terrace, beyond the reach of disaster. When the kalpa cycles open anew and chaos is redivided, the true saints transmit and descend to transform the human realm. It dwells in the highest heaven of five hundred million five thousand five hundred and fifty-five layers of heaven, above the eight Brahma heavens and the realm of sun and moon, nine hundred and ninety-nine million nine hundred and ninety-nine thousand nine hundred and ninety billion qi, one qi spanning three thousand li. The heavens and immortals name this mountain variously: first, the Mountain that Covers the Head of Heaven; second, the Mountain of Boundless Mystery; third, the Cavernous Mystery of Luo Xuan; fourth, the High Supreme True Origin Mountain; fifth, the Mountain of Countless Treasures and Hidden Kalpa Blades; sixth, the Colorless Great Treasure Mountain; seventh, the Perceptive Cavernous Mystery Mountain; eighth, the Radiant Splendor Supreme True Mountain; ninth, the Inconceivable Mountain; tenth, the Great Profound Metropolis Jade Capital Supreme Mountain. To know the name of this mountain is to enter immortality. The Seven Treasures’ floral groves on the mountain all compose the writings of the Supreme Clarity’s Three Caverns Daoist Virtue Scripture. Eating these floral fruits makes one a golden light immortal. Foretold by reading this scripture and savoring its truth, the Dao naturally forms.”

#### Chant of Stepping into Emptiness

Cultivate the Numinous Treasure Cavernous Mystery fast, recite the hollow and profound chapter on stepping into emptiness. First knock teeth three times through, swallow thrice. Hold in mind the sun and moon on one’s face, their radiance pouring into the nose; the sun enters the left nostril, the moon the right, entering the Golden Radiance Palace. Light emerges behind the head, suddenly forming a nine-colored round image, permeating the jade pillow, illuminating the Ten Directions, following me as I circle and revolve through the scripture. When finished, knock teeth three times through again, swallow saliva thrice, hold the Three Primordial Lords in the Golden Radiance Palace, like an infant’s form. The true being’s fast is all in solemn ritual and method, only without the section for dispatching officers and soldiers. Other wishes, thoughts, and prostrations all follow the great method of establishing fasts. On the first day, officers and soldiers are dispatched; without scripture transmission or teaching outsiders, there is no need to dispatch officers and soldiers. The Supreme Ultimate True Being treasures this scripture, forbidding the names of past immortals and perfected beings, not allowing them to see it.

#### Ten Chants of the Cavernous Mystery Step into Emptiness

I bow my head and pay respects to the Most High, burning incense returning to void and nothingness. Flowing brightness follows me in return, the Dharma wheel also revolves thrice. The profound origin’s four great forces arise, numinous blessings extend to kings and nobles. The Seven Ancestors give birth to heaven’s hall, shining brightly, spreading radiance. Whistling songs gaze upon the vast desert, heavenly music suits my delight. Harmonious fragrance is the supreme virtue, below the mundane none can compare. Wondrous thoughts illuminate profound awakening, solemnly patrolling the emptiness in travel.

Turning and walking, treading the cloud’s thread, riding emptiness to step the profound record. Chanting and reciting the Emperor One Most Honored, a hundred gates naturally adjust. Bowing to command the eight seas’ children, looking up to carry the high immortal youths. The heavens scatter fragrant flowers, the numinous wind rises desolately. Old vows fix the root of fate, thus reaching high marks and standards. Joy and delight before the Most High, ten thousand kalpas yet not begun.

Steep and towering is the Mysterious Capital Mountain, the one sovereign of the Ten Directions. Lofty and towering is the heavenly treasure terrace, brilliance flowing like the sun. Dazzling is the jade floral grove, sparkling and shining with vermilion fruit. Constantly recalling to feast on primordial essence, refining liquid to solidify form and substance. Golden light scatters over Purple Tenuity, graceful and secluded, the great vehicle’s escape.

Looking up and down, holding the Most High, splendid radiance shines on the cinnabar field. Glancing left to raise the solemn ritual, glancing right to carry the bound jade. The six perfections crown Brahma conduct, Dao and virtue renew daily. Past fate accumulates blessings and celebration, hearing the scripture as if a close kin. Heaven’s excellence transcends worldly talent, joyfully reciting rare and subtle chapters. The void’s Great Harmony qi breathes in and out, exhaling and inhaling flowing rosy mists. Embryonic breath calms the hundred gates, quietly glimpsing the three conveniences. The mud pellet’s cavernous bright image, thus forming the golden light immortal. The demon king respectfully receives orders, therefore able to attend the heavens. All arise from fasts and precepts, accumulating merit and binding past affinities. Flying and soaring beyond the great void, carrying and guiding the high supreme person.

Holding reins, heading to the Ten Directions, resting in the mysterious radiance’s nook. Looking up to observe the kalpa platform, looking down to glimpse the purple cloud net. Leisurely roaming the Most High capital, sitting together on lotus blossoms. Accumulating learning to become a true being, serene and flourishing in honor and harmony. Forever enjoying endless lifespan, ten thousand springs—what need is there for more?

The great Dao master is profound and silent, ascending immortality with friends without fame. The noble son carries the numinous talisman, the Great One holds the cavernous chapter. Relics shine with golden form, the dragon chariot suddenly comes to greet. The heavenly venerable looks upon the cloud carriage, drifting and riding the void in flight. Incense flowers fall like flying snow, mist thickens the mysterious beam. Bowing head to the golden palace, hand in hand roaming the Jade Capital.

The towering trees in the mysterious radiance garden, dazzling the Seven Treasures’ grove. Three hundred heavenly beasts named, lions vast for ten thousand fathoms. Flying dragons pacing and calling, divine phoenixes responding in rhythm. Numinous wind fans strange flowers, pure fragrance spreads on robes. Without high immortal talent, how could one indulge this heart?

Reining my nine dragons’ carriage, riding the void in carefree ease. The eight heavens are like the palm of a hand, the six harmonies are hardly vast. The assembly of immortals recites the cavernous scripture, the Most High sings clear ballads. Incense flowers scatter with the wind, jade sounds form the purple firmament. The five sufferings burst at once, the eight hardships follow the clear scripture. Wonderful indeed, the numinous treasure enclosure, inspiring this great Dharma bridge.

The heavenly true Emperor One palace, misty and radiant with numinous light. Flowing brilliance of the Dharma wheel’s thread, revolving through emptiness into formlessness. The Void Sovereign strokes the cloud jade bells, all true beings recite the cavernous scripture. High immortals clasp hands in praise, enduring kalpas preserve benefit and chastity.

Utmost truth waits on nothing, sometimes reins the flying dragon. Long fasts gather in the mysterious capital, ringing jade and striking jade bells. Ten blossoms, all immortals assemble, purple smoke forms the palace. Treasure canopy covers the Most High, true beings hold the lotus blossom. Scattering flowers, stating my vow, grasping the banner to summon the demon king. The Dharma drum gathers the immortals, numinous chants vary in tone. No yes, no no, thoughts and hopes connect to the subtle.

#### Eight Praises of the Most High Wisdom Scripture

The Most High’s profound and empty school, spreading the Dao, revering its scripture. Looking up and down, already attaining immortality, enduring countless kalpas’ age. Lofty and great is the true virtue, silent and arising from non-being. Celestial radiance forms empty constructs, riding the void naturally traveling. Sun and moon blaze brightly, peaceful harmony and joy without end.

Learning immortality cuts off worldly thoughts, thought after thought accumulates cause. Coming and going disturb my spirit, the spirit restless and unceasing. Extinguish thought, stop in quiet leisure, desolate and entering empty silence. Request the scripture as if hungry and thirsty, hold resolve like metal and stone. Guard the child’s flying immortal path, five spirits ferry the talisman registers.

Aid me in the six perfections’ conduct, thus able to unravel the three nets. Pure fasts honor the Great Origin, breathing in and out nurturing cloud sprouts. Leisurely within the Golden Palace, Jade Capital is my home. Naturally grow the Seven Treasures, everyone sits on lotus blossoms. Looking up to chew the mysterious capital’s crabapple, looking down to drink the hollow melon. Countenance shines like ten suns, why count the many kalpas? The Dharma drum gathers heavenly immortals, ringing bells summon the great demon.

Numinous wind fans fragrant flowers, dazzlingly opening abundant robes. The Supreme True strokes the cloud jade bells, all immortals pluck numinous zithers. Elegant songs of the three heavens’ radiance, scattering wisdom in the jade floral grove. The Seven Ancestors ascend the hall of blessings, from here stepping the profound sound. Past lives’ blessings were insufficient, this book is distant and hard to find. Faith in the Dao’s feelings is endless, seeking flight yet sinking back. The Most High’s non-action Dao, spreading it lies in the primordial heart.

Learning the Dao depends on alchemical faith, serving the master like closest kin. Drawing radiance occasionally in clear emptiness, diligently following daily renewal. Others have yet to be saved, I will not save my own body. Great vow holds heavy repayment, profound virtue surely believed. Yin evil sins reach deep, future turns like the wheel.

Learning the Dao is also very bitter, morning and night building the field of merit. Planting virtue is like planting trees, planting baskets to form mountains. If you can indulge in the profound, you will float and ascend to the blue heavens. Cultivate this non-action Dao, one must bind with goodness. The Most High’s utmost hidden book is named the Wisdom Chapter. Delivering suffering through great talent, transcending the mundane to attain truth. Numinous form is rare in the world, dazzling like a lotus in a deep abyss.

People act as if having a root, all from past life merit. Establish virtue and act timely, issue vows without fail. Good and evil both await response, support and fall, principle hard to exhaust. Worthy scholars honor the Dharma’s words, the Dao also lies in simultaneous forgetting. Understanding this is great wisdom, above is the Supreme Ultimate Lord. Treasure canopy connects jade carriage, commanding the reins to control nine dragons. Golden radiance alerts the cavernous scripture, holding incense all immortal youths. Whistling songs pierce the mysterious capital, striking jade and knocking jade bells.

Raising the body to soar beyond Supreme Clarity, transcending radiance and escaping the purple firmament. Guarding the non-being, holding the Dharma thread, roaming the mysterious pole in carefree ease. Ten thousand kalpas are still like last night, a thousand springs like morning dawn. Lofty and grand shading cloud blossoms, hand grasping treasure grove branches. Incense smoke naturally departs, mysterious sounds accompany the soaring. Numinous banners scatter with the wind, abundant thoughts dissolve in time. Extinguish wisdom, spread the great chaos, non-action becomes clear ballad.

Words of the Supreme Ultimate True Being, constantly cherished and recited by the immortals, not revealed to the mundane, secretly stored within the Golden Palace and Jade Chamber. The Immortal Lord says: “It should be transmitted to those who cultivate the Numinous Treasure fast, not shown to superficial and flashy folk. Be cautious, be cautious.”

The Mysterious Master, Most Primordial True Being, personally bestowed upon Attendant Xu Changshi the Great Cavernous Mystery Scripture’s Jade Capital Mountain Secret, composing three hymns. On the same evening, Lady You Ying also chanted them.

#### Hymn

The eight assemblies meet with no sect, riding fate to observe the noisy net. Transforming to remove floating dust, loosening robes with the Daoist family. Summoning smoke in an instant, carrying truth to the numinous nook. Empty radiance fills the jade pavilion, the Mysterious Sovereign composes phoenix songs. Traveling the path without tracks or hindrance, divine sounds dance on cloud waves. Virtue together shines on the Jade Capital, why need the world’s abundance?

Left hand holds the jade radiance canopy, flying at dawn treading the seven origins. Three stars blaze purple light, towering and stroking the bright truth. Leaping and dancing, expecting the moment, all four directions already divine. Numinous writings have no boundary, diligent study of Supreme Clarity’s texts. Why sit in crooked paths, causing you to feel distracted? Yin sickness loses the mysterious pivot, unknowingly years divide.

Mysterious waves shake the vast ocean, great ferry drums ten thousand streams. Riding radiance looking at six voids, thinking to roam with true beings. Wonderful chants do not answer me, clear sounds have no one to cast. Racing the jade wheel in clouds, who are dust’s companions?

The Supreme Ultimate Five True Beings, at Mount Kuaiji’s Yu Mountain, bestowed the Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure Scripture to Immortal Lord Ge, each chanting a hymn.

#### Hymn of the Supreme Ultimate True Being

The Most High Great Dao Lord, revealed the Numinous Treasure chapter. Sublime and wondrous beyond words, like the mystery within mystery. Naturally all ten directions’ lands, together admire the supreme immortals. Great indeed is the Cavernous Emptiness Scripture, calmly seated facing the heavens. Above is the treasured Purple Tenuity Terrace, below hides all famous mountains. Dazzling dragon and phoenix patterns, brilliance restrained within. Wonderful indeed is the Most High Dao, non-action and always natural. Kings and nobles and commoners, all value only the virtuous. Past fate holds blessings and celebration, outstanding in former affinities. Dharma masters pass it on, treasure faith through kalpa years. Broad heart saves all beings, great blessings repay your body. Offerings surely gain the Dao, practice leads to utmost truth. The great Dao has no self or other, transmission must reach the perfected person.

#### Hymn of the First Supreme Ultimate True Being

All wonders arise from the cavernous truth, dazzling and shining on Supreme Clarity. Those who serve are called immortals, their essence eternal and long-lived. Leisurely playing in profound emptiness, palaces array their forms. Sparkling Seven Treasures’ groves, bright with sun and moon essence. Dragons and qilin cross and run, phoenixes soar and cry mournfully. The Most High governs the Purple Terrace, all true beings recite the cavernous scripture. Twisting incense and bowing heads, circling the palace city. Three rounds return to the high seat, the Dao King responds in voice. The ruler promotes the supreme Dao, the world universally peaceful.

#### Hymn of the Second Supreme Ultimate True Being

Emptiness and nothingness are always natural, forcibly named the great Dao. Sounds overcome the distant and unchanging boundaries, all wonders return to the numinous treasure. Close eyes to hold utmost truth, refined thought descends the ten elders. Ascend immortality, forever non-action, numinous countenance always wondrous and good. Thirst to drink the jade pool’s sweet wine, hunger to eat golden flower herbs. Purify the world, cross the eight hardships, save the world’s many sufferings.

#### Hymn of the Third Supreme Ultimate True Being

Wonderful indeed is the Numinous Treasure Scripture, the Most High’s natural writing. Those who serve attain the Dao, called true ones descending to the world. Receiving command to proclaim the Daoist teaching, truly transcending mundane talent. When affairs complete, ascend as divine immortals, palaces govern the mysterious terrace. At times descending to Kunlun Mountain, leisurely resting at Penglai.

#### Hymn of Zhang the Celestial Master, Supreme One True Being and Supreme Three Heavens Dharma Master of the Orthodox Unity

Numinous treasure and great cavern, the true Dao scripture king. Only five thousand characters, sublime and unmatched. Practice and attain flying immortality, mysterious dwelling governs the void. Guarding the Most High’s terrace, roaming the Purple Tenuity Palace. Ten thousand kalpas like a flash of lightning, lasting forever without end. Daoist robes complete and sufficient, radiant and naturally connected. Darkness is called unknowing, calmly seated seeing the Ten Directions.

#### Three Ritual Scriptures of Incantations

The true being says: “The secret says that when attending the scripture, immortal youths and jade maidens hear this incantation, all joyfully protect the destined body. This great scripture uses this incantation for all rites and prostrations. If one sincerely worships the scripture, also mentally chants its text—this is the supreme immortal’s secret.”

Music and method are like a spouse, loving the scripture like pearls and jade. Upholding precepts controls the seven emotions, thinking on the Dao dismisses desires. Light and pure, correct qi rests, desolate and spirit silent. Heavenly demons all respect and yield, generation after generation enjoy great blessings.

Flourishing is the family and nation, thriving are the scriptures and Dao. Heaven and humans share the same wish, drifting into the great vehicle. Because of the heart, establish the field of blessings, the Dharma wheel rises without ceasing. The Seven Ancestors give birth to heaven’s hall, my body soars in broad daylight.

The great Dao is cavernous and empty, with thought nothing is not accordant. Refine substance to enter immortal truth, thus forming the adamantine body. Transcending the Three Realms’ hardships, resolving hell’s five sufferings. All return to the Most High’s scripture, quietly thinking and bowing in worship.

(The Supreme Ultimate Left Immortal Lord Ge the True Being, named Xuan, styled Filial Foremost, at Mount Tiantai taught disciples Zheng Siyuan, monk Zhu Falan, Buddhist Dao Wei, and Wu Shixian, lord Sun Quan. Later Siyuan at Mount Majishan taught Ge Hong. Hong was Ge Immortal Lord’s descendant, called Master Embracing Simplicity, author of internal and external scriptures. At that time Zheng said the Immortal Master told Immortal Lord Ge: ‘The Supreme Clarity’s Three Caverns Supreme True Dao Scriptures I will, upon my passing, send one copy to a famous mountain cavern terrace, one to disciples, one to my family’s disciples, to be recorded and transmitted generation after generation. If perfected persons only pursue my scripture to chase worldly affairs, they cannot be entrusted to record and transmit; better to entrust to famous mountains and Five Sacred Peaks, not lightly transmit to unworthy persons. If worthy persons appear, transmit to them; do not close the heavenly Dao.’)
