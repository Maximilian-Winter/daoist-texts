# Preface and Commentary to the Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure: Ascending the Profound, Stepping the Void Chapter

Title of Scripture: Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure: Ascending the Profound, Stepping the Void Chapter Preface and Commentary. Author unknown, roughly dating from the Sui-Tang era. One scroll. Source text: *Zhengtong Daozang*, Cavernous Mystery section, category of hymns and praises.

“Ascending the Profound” is the wondrous name of perfect awakening; “Stepping the Void” is the divine’s utmost summit. To ascend is to verify reality without error; profound is the mystic unity with supreme virtue. To step is to traverse and connect; the void is to soar and transcend. Furthermore, “chapter” means radiant brilliance unveiled, praising the vast flow of the dharma’s essence. Thus, the mysterious sound is just born, harmonizing all directions, the spirit’s charm unfolds anew, and the ten splendors compete to gather. Turning the profound capital, one casts the numinous, treads the cloud’s thread, and carries the covenant. Surely this is the method field that delights the spirit and purifies the will, the wondrous place where form dissolves and heart is undone—hence it is called Ascending the Profound, Stepping the Void Chapter.

It is also said that the Most High Patriarch spoke the Scripture of the Profound Capital Jade Capital Mountain. The “Most High” is the sacred person’s assumed title, able to expound the perfected dharma. The “Jade Capital” is a metaphor for the dharma’s essence. The dharma’s root is speechless and formless; now it borrows the name of the Profound Capital to explain the dharma. Hence there is the Scripture of Jade Capital Mountain and its city towers—this is the third section of Cavernous Mystery, the eighth scroll of Numinous Treasure. Therefore, following the void cavern is the praise of all heavens, the dharma’s essence complete and round, knowing past and present as one, encompassing coarse and subtle alike, thus it follows. This text is the Most High’s universal summary of the perfected dharma, a hymn of the great pure dharma gate, revealing the grand principle of conditional teaching, the fellowship of wondrous awakening. Thus, all dharmas are the Jade Capital; all things inscribe the dao and virtue. It is also said the Jade Capital is the dharma’s essence, the profound unity. The capital is a title. The same title names the three thousand great thousand worlds as one Jade Capital Mountain, the abode of the Most High in this realm. It is also the dwelling of human heart and spirit, thus spoken of as the teaching’s name, the essence teaching the heart and spirit. When heart and spirit awaken, it is called awakening; when confused, it is called confusion; when wise, it is called wisdom. Reverence makes them correspond as human dharma, hence it is called scripture. Scripture passes through the ford of meaning. Principle arises from explanation; explanation arises from principle. The student’s spirit awakens, thus it is named scripture. Jade means pure; capital means great. To say Profound Capital is the great pure principle, thus the dharma’s essence. The Most High is the person; the Profound Capital Jade Capital is the dharma, also the realm of wisdom. Speaking of realm and place, both are called myriad treasures; speaking of wisdom and its place, both are called numinous treasures. Hence it is said the Scripture of the Profound Capital Jade Capital Mountain.

This scroll divides into four parts. First, it raises the Profound Capital as the dao realm, to establish the dharma’s essence, explaining the teaching method by form, narrating the summary from principle to function. Second, it reveals the cultivation methods. Third, it lists ten hymns praising the dharma’s essence, summarizing the meaning of entering principle from without. Fourth, it scatters wide recitations, all dharmas correct, to show gains and losses in circulation.

The Most High says: The Profound Capital Jade Capital Mountain is the very speech. Crowning the eight directions, the mountain has four faces, four edges, and four hanging sides, thus eight directions. This is the realm of Heaven and Earth, the dwelling with arranged worlds. Comparing the earth’s form, there are upper, middle, and lower Profound Capitals; the mountain’s name is also called the Three Great Ring Mountains. The great ring is the crown, covering the eight directions, all heavens fully enclosed within. The first lower small Profound Capital corresponds to the eight directions as eight worlds below heaven, forming one world, one ring mountain enclosing it. Layered upward to one thousand, it is one small thousand world, settled in the four directions. Another enclosure encloses this, forming one middle world, layered upward to one thousand, one middle thousand world, again settled in four directions. Yet another enclosure encloses this, forming one great thousand world, layered upward to one thousand, one crown enclosing mountain. Looking over middle and lower, it is called the three thousand great thousand worlds. This is the crown covering the eight directions, encircling Heaven. Its essence is seven treasures, also called treasure gathering, hence called Jade Capital. This uses form as a base, clarifying the high and wondrous beauty, the eye of numinous treasure’s dharma essence, surveying the cavernous void. Thus the mountain naturally grows trees of seven treasures. Speaking of the mountain’s name is not about trees literally, but using trees as form, also called the dao tree. One single trunk, branches, and leaves spread out, covering all around, hence called the dharma’s encircling Heaven. It is the place where the Great Dao Lord governs transformation and movement, the dharma realm, the dao field, the place of settling spirit, the place of speaking dharma. It is not apart from truth, but truth everywhere. Throughout the world, there is no place empty or idle, the three poisons and four arrivals, the numinous ford and dharma sea, the six emotions and five aggregates. Jade Capital Mountain is the high immortal’s profound capital, where myriad saints gather, also the Great Dao Lord and sages. Now all things take themselves as body—surely only the sages. Hence called the great dharma sage. Heavenly Venerables, emperors, high immortals and perfect truths each hold fast to dharma with fasting and offerings, venerating the Most High here. Fasting means washing the heart, called fasting. Day means time. Also means the heart’s pure awakening illuminating as day and time. When our purity is complete, all else is pure without exception. The title Most High Profound Capital is just this meaning. Burning natural sandalwood, it produces numinous incense, the spirit’s fragrance. The realm is pure. Flying immortals scatter blossoms; all dharmas are blossoms. Circling and singing the cavernous numinous chapter. All heavens play a hundred thousand myriad sounds in chaotic harmony. This is wondrous speech, all matters within the numinous awakening dharma essence, relying solely on the text to complete itself.

The mountain has ten titles, each naming the dharma’s essence. Though ten names, one meaning only.

One name: Crown of Heaven’s Head Mountain. Its dharma nature is true emptiness, spanning past and present, the origin and head of myriad things, hence called Heaven’s Head.

Two: Boundless Profound Upper Mountain. Its mountain is boundless, unsearchable, no top or bottom attainable, hence called Boundless Profound.

Three: Encompassing Profound Cavernous Void Mountain. Its mountain is everywhere, where it is not is nowhere, hence called Encompassing Profound.

Four: Lofty Supreme True Origin Mountain. Its mountain is the gathering of myriad saints, hence called Lofty Supreme.

Five: Myriad Treasures Hidden Kalpa Blade Mountain. Its mountain’s every dharma is treasure, depths and shallows both visible, hence called Myriad Treasures.

Six: Colorless Great Awakening Mountain. Its mountain’s wondrous awakening is formless, hence called Colorless.

Seven: All-Observing Cavernous Mystery Mountain. Its mountain’s great brightness is boundless, hence called All-Observing.

Eight: Radiant Splendor Supreme True Mountain. Its mountain is one body, radiant and flowing with splendor, hence called Radiant Splendor.

Nine: Inconceivable Mountain. Its mountain is true emptiness, beyond thought and reason, hence called Inconceivable.

Ten: Great Profound Capital Jade Capital Most High Mountain. Its mountain is non-dual of person and dharma, taking purity as essence, hence called Great Profound.

Mountain means body, also the Most High’s body. Knowing the meaning beneath these names accords with the dharma; name and essence unite, thus it enters the immortal register.

Seven treasures, splendid flowers, leaves, mountain trees, branches, stems, leaves, soil, stone terraces and pavilions—all are seven treasures. Flowers and leaves are all the scriptures of the Three Caverns of Supreme Clarity, the dao and virtue, thirty-six scriptures in all. The signs can be consumed as food, naturally forming golden flower immortals. Encouraging swallowing the numinous treasure’s clear cup, the realm follows the heart’s delight; the great earth itself becomes the seven treasures’ profound scripture. Mountains, forests, grasses, stones—all possess wisdom, able to proclaim the treasure dharma. Where is not the Jade Capital? The Cavernous Mystery Stepping the Void Chant, under this title, is just savoring the seven treasures’ flower and leaf dharma. The heart connects with the profound dao; the spirit chants Stepping the Void, roaming through scriptures and dharma. The student’s spirit awakens, calling it scripture; the vision follows the sound and wanders, hence called chanting. Bowing and saluting has three meanings, as commonly understood. Now here, since it is about savoring and chanting, it should be explained from the heart’s leaves.

#### The Most High’s Cavernous Mystery Stepping the Void Scripture Chant

**First**

I bow and salute the Most High, burning incense returning to the void primordial. The flowing light follows my return; the dharma wheel also turns thrice. The profound primordial’s four greats arise; numinous celebration and nobles join. Seven ancestors give birth to heaven’s hall, shining bright, spreading splendor. Howling songs gaze upon the vast desert; heavenly music suits my delight. The fragrance is equal to supreme virtue; lower immortals cannot compare. Wondrous forms illuminate profound awakening; splendidly they roam the void in freedom.

(Bowing and saluting the Most High: bow means to open, head means heart, saluting means essence. Opening heart essence, letting the Most High’s wisdom fire burn the body’s form all to purity. Burning incense returning to void and nothingness: burning means to extinguish, extinguishing all forms; incense’s purity returns to void and nothingness. Void and nothingness do not return to the Most High; the Most High returns to it, hence the saying. Flowing light follows my return: I am the Most High; the dharma wheel turns thrice, thus uniting with the Most High, turning the three dharma wheels to completion. The profound primordial’s four greats arise: profound primordial means my four greats flourish, always united with the profound dao. Numinous celebration and nobles: numinous wisdom and celebration combine, nourishing parents, pleasing lords, benefiting things, hence nobles too. Seven ancestors give birth to heaven’s hall, shining bright and spreading splendor. Howling songs gaze on the vast desert: singing the numinous wisdom’s sound, a single tone enveloping, observing the desert’s dao, the joy of dao’s union, naturally blending with heavenly music, heavenly music suits my delight. Fragrance equal to supreme virtue: fragrance means receiving; seven ancestors and lords receive supreme virtue with me, not like lower immortals. Wondrous forms unite myriad wonders, no hindrance to profound awakening. Splendidly, they freely roam the void.)

**Second**

Turning and walking, treading the cloud’s thread, riding the void, stepping the profound order. Chanting the One Emperor, a hundred joints self-adjust. Bowing to command the eight seas’ children, looking up to carry the high immortal’s seed. All heavens scatter fragrant flowers; a gentle numinous wind arises. Past vows fix the root of fate, thus reaching lofty goals. Joy and delight before the Most High, countless kalpas yet unbegun.

(Turning and walking, treading the cloud’s thread: turning in void and walking; walking means forgetting. Feet tread the dharma cloud’s thread, riding the void, stepping the profound order. Chanting means connecting with nature. Nature connected, the One Emperor naturally unites with my body; the hundred joints, the body’s hundred bones and joints, all harmonize and return to supreme principle. Bowing to command the eight seas’ children: uniting all things as self, thus the eight directions’ nature seas, one infant child. Child means no mind. Relied upon by heaven and humans, looking up to carry the high immortal’s seed. All heavens scatter fragrant flowers: above and below, scattering true dharma blossoms. The realm follows the heart’s delight; the jade script responds to the realm’s arising. Gentle numinous wind arises: gentle means the numinous awakening’s wind, softly rising. Past vows fix the root of fate: through countless kalpas, past accumulated vows, boundless numinous wisdom, vows to awaken and understand; thus the root of fate is firmly fixed, now to receive it. Thus reaching lofty goals: lofty goals now attained. Now the Most High dwells before my heart, the dao fruit boundless, vows fulfilled, thus joy and delight unite, continuing the constant. Countless kalpas yet unbegun: understanding constancy.)

**Third**

Steep and towering Profound Capital Mountain, the ten directions’ sovereign united as one. Lofty heavenly treasure terrace, radiant flames flowing like the sun. Brilliant jade flower forest, dazzling and shining red fruits. Constantly contemplating consuming primordial essence, refining liquid to solidify form and substance. Golden light scatters the Purple Tenuity, the profound capital’s secluded retreat.

(Steep and towering Profound Capital Mountain: speaking of the realm’s pure dharma essence, steep and lofty, the profound dao’s capital and dharma mountain. Ten directions’ sovereign united as one: sovereign one, the honored heart of pure wisdom. Awakening gathers and embraces the ten directions’ profound capital, all kin returning to sovereign one’s honor. Lofty heavenly treasure terrace: uniting all things as self. Realm and wisdom shine as one, radiant flames flowing like the sun. The sun and moon’s light is overshadowed, the sun’s light transcends. Below explains brilliant jade forest flowers, dazzling shining red fruits, just so. Constantly contemplating consuming primordial essence: describing the practice of observation. Primordial essence is numinous wisdom. Daily observation refines clarity, easily losing vital breath; thus root and form solidify into golden light dharma body, scattering to illuminate my body, giving rise to the Purple Tenuity’s dwelling, quietly residing in the profound capital’s abode. Later generations changed this to “great vehicle,” the height of folly. “Vehicle” means the path of transport and direction. The profound capital is the ultimate dao’s chamber and dwelling. Faithfully moving toward it is like walking; labor and rest are extreme.)

**Fourth**

Looking up and down, preserving the Most High, splendid radiance adorns the elixir field. Left glance raises the gathered instruments, right gaze carries the binding jewels. The six perfections crown the Brahman conduct; dao and virtue renew daily. Past fate accumulates blessings and celebration; hearing the scripture is like meeting close kin. Heaven’s elite surpass worldly talents, joyfully chanting rare subtle chapters. Pure void’s great harmonious qi, inhaling and exhaling flowing rosy ford. Embryonic breath calms the hundred joints, vast and clear, penetrating the three conveniences. The mud pellet’s cavernous bright scene, thus forming the golden flower immortal. The demon king respectfully accepts service, thus able to attend all heavens. All begins from fasting and precepts, accumulating merit and binding past affinities. Flying and roaming above the great void, carrying and guiding the exalted person.

(Looking up and down, preserving the Most High: here each chapter separately establishes a gate of observation, practice of savoring and chanting. The practice gates differ; the hymn says the scene’s awakening returns to the one root. Each chapter stands alone, unrelated. Now, looking up and down preserving the Most High: preserving means heart. Form and action have looking up and down; heart and action have preserving thought. The moving heart’s spirit is wondrous; wondrous thought naturally governs; form follows spirit. Preserving spirit follows the Most High and moves; the Most High follows spirit and acts; thus the looking up and down body equals the Most High; the Most High follows spirit and returns to me; hence splendid radiance adorns the elixir field. Left glance raising gathered instruments and binding jewels: from awakened wisdom’s gathering and carrying. The six perfections’ crown is Brahman conduct; thus dao and virtue renew daily. Past fate accumulates blessings and celebration: describing those able to act as above, long past habits now honored, practice reaching without retreat. Hearing scripture like close kin: blessings responding. Close kin and parents, like one long separated suddenly seeing them. Scripture is dharma mother, dao is dharma father; meeting them brings joy and respect, practice has past fate. Heaven’s elite surpass worldly talents: thus joyfully chanting rare subtle two chapters. Soundless means rare; formless means subtle. Without past habit binding karma, one does not believe scripture, hears but does not listen. Even if practiced, soon retreats, lacking control and holding power. Pure void’s great harmonious qi: describing correct observation practice. Void means heart. Heart comprehends pure void great harmonious wondrous qi, inhaling and exhaling flowing light, rosy ford nourishing my body. Also called embryonic breath. Like the fetus’s steadiness, like breath without mind, empty and peaceful nurturing, calming the hundred joints. Calmness makes the heart vast and silent, clear and bright, penetrating the three realms’ convenient gates. Mud pellet means non-action, non-action illuminating within, light and scene bright outside, true constant flourishing brightness’s dao; thus forming the golden flower immortal. Naturally making the demon king respect and accept service, thus able to attend meetings in all heavens. All begins from fasting and precepts: describing initial cause, past habits accumulating myriad good deeds through vast kalpas, cleansing primordial dust, thus obtaining body and dharma realm, flying and roaming above the great void. Gathering coarse and subtle, carrying and guiding the exalted person.)

**Fifth**

Reining the bridle to the ten directions, turning to rest in the profound scene’s chamber. Looking up to the kalpa’s lofty terrace, gazing down upon the purple cloud canopy. Leisurely roaming the Most High capital, together sitting on lotus flowers. Accumulating learning to become true person, serene and flourishing in protection and harmony. Eternally enjoying endless lifespan, what need for countless thousands of years?

(Reining the bridle to the ten directions: controlling body and bridle of heart, thus body follows heart and is pure; heart reins body and acts; riding it to traverse ten directions fully. Thus turning and resting, sitting in the profound dao’s scene, within the chamber. Looking up to body and mind sitting on kalpa’s lofty terrace, gazing down upon returning light, beneath the purple cloud’s covering. Purple cloud canopy is numinous wisdom’s supreme dharma, the cloud’s color of dharma. Sitting thus at ease, dwelling in the Most High Jade Capital’s place. Holy friends gather, together sitting on lotus flowers. Accumulating learning to become true person: describing long past habits, now attained. Serene and flourishing in protection and harmony: the dharma of flourishing protection is true wisdom’s harmony and serenity, stomach and palace’s inner harmony and brightness. Eternally enjoying endless lifespan: forever enjoying unending life, not needing countless thousands of years, hence what need for more.)

**Sixth**

The Great Dao Master is profound and silent; ascending immortality befriends the unheroic. The noble son wields the numinous talisman; the Great Unity holds the cavernous chapter. Relics shine with golden form; dragon chariot suddenly comes to greet. Heavenly Venerable gazes at the cloud carriage, drifting and riding the void in flight. Fragrant flowers like flying snow, mist and haze flourish on the profound beam. Bowing head and mind to the golden palace, hand in hand roaming the Jade Capital.

(The Great Dao Master is profound and silent: those seeking the Great Dao should use the profound silent realm as teacher; teacher is silent realm outside, attaining non-action within. Silent realm is non-action; non-action is silent realm. This is attaining the Great Dao, thus silent realm is teacher. Hence ascending immortality befriends the unheroic: befriending the unheroic, the numinous talisman naturally turns within me. The unheroic noble son is the heavenly truth’s name. The Great Unity Emperor presents the cavernous chapter to me. Cavernous chapter is the heavenly middle sound. Relics are bones. The cavernous chapter irrigates my bone form; bone form becomes golden visage. Dragon chariot suddenly, from the air, comes to greet, reining loose to roam. Heavenly Venerable carries and supports me; cloud carriage drifts, riding the void together flying. Fragrant flowers fill the empty realm like flying snow, mist and haze flourishing beautifully, the profound dao’s high beam. Head and mind bow within the golden palace; Heavenly Venerable carries and holds my hand, roaming and sitting in the Jade Capital.)

**Seventh**

Soaring trees in the profound scene’s garden, brilliantly shining seven treasure forest. Heavenly beasts three hundred named, lions vast as myriad lengths. Flying dragons pause and call, divine phoenixes respond in seasonal chant. Numinous wind fans wondrous flowers, pure fragrance spreads to human robes. Without high immortal talent, how could one indulge this heart?

(Soaring trees in the profound scene’s garden: scene follows the heart’s purity, thus scene forms seven treasure soaring trees. Now speaking of scene’s wonder, also the heart’s wonder, thus setting heart and wisdom to speak scene, hence called profound scene garden. Wondrous heart illuminates the round pure scene, treasures form seven treasure soaring trees, the dharma realm’s garden enclosure, hence brilliantly shining seven treasure forest. Heavenly beasts three hundred named: natural dharma beasts appear in form and image, dharma king lion’s freedom, hence lion’s name. Three hundred names and myriad lengths are just to raise numbers; truly names are countless, essence vast without end. Below lists flying dragons and divine phoenixes, all heavenly beasts’ other names. Beneath the divine phoenix’s fan is wondrous wisdom. Numinous wisdom is bright and pure, majestic and wondrous, fanning myriad scenes to form bright pure dharma, fragrance scattering to human robes in the realm. Below explains from lacking high immortal great sage’s talent and wisdom, how could one indulge in such heart and playfulness?)

**Eighth**

Adorning my nine-dragon chariot, riding the void to roam freely. The eight heavens are like the palm of the hand; the six harmonies how could they be vast? All immortals chant the cavernous scripture; the Most High sings pure melodies. Fragrant flowers scatter with the wind; jade sounds form the Purple Firmament. Five sufferings burst at once; eight hardships follow the scripture’s vastness. Wondrous indeed, the numinous treasure enclosure, inspiring this great dharma bridge.

(Adorning my nine-dragon chariot: adorning myself with numinous treasure’s true wisdom, adorning and washing my five roots and four hearts, thus forming six penetrations and three clarities, smoothing all roughness and obstacles, hence nine-dragon chariot. Thus riding the void to roam freely. The eight heavens are like the palm of the hand; the six harmonies how could they be vast? Riding in accord, uniting all things as one body, all immortals and Most High venerable teachers and good friends gather unbidden, all chanting and singing cavernous melodies forming the teaching. Thus fragrant flowers scatter with the wind, jade sounds form the Purple Firmament. Purple Firmament’s scene and colors all form scripture. Hence the five sufferings at once, following scripture burst and scatter, also becoming scripture. The eight hardships likewise. Hence wondrous indeed, the numinous treasure enclosure, inspiring this great dharma bridge.)

**Ninth**

Heavenly truth’s One Emperor palace, misty and crowned with numinous radiance. Flowing brilliant dharma wheel’s thread, turning void entering formless. Void Sovereign holds the cloud bell; myriad truths chant the cavernous scripture. High immortals clasp hands in praise, countless kalpas preserving benefit and purity.

(Heavenly truth’s One Emperor palace: palace means body. The essence of natural dao, thus the heavenly truth’s self-place, the true emperor’s supreme one dwelling. Dwelling, emperor’s one dwelling. The misty essence surrounds crowned numinous radiance. The body’s dharma essence, flowing light shining brilliantly, is the dharma bridge’s thread and order. The wheel turns uniting void and nothingness; the Great Dao revolves void entering formless. Void Sovereign and myriad truths suddenly arrive, as great teachers and friends, holding cloud bell and singing, chanting cavernous scripture, completing in me. High immortals gather hands in praise and celebration. Countless kalpas preserve benefit and purity. United and constant.)

**Tenth**

Utmost truth waits on nothing; sometimes reins the flying dragon. Long fasting gathers at the profound capital; ringing jade taps the jade bell. Ten splendors, myriad immortals assemble; purple smoke forms the palace. Treasure canopy covers the Most High; true person holds the lotus. Scattering blossoms, presenting my vow; grasping the scepter, summoning the demon king. Dharma drums gather the assembly of immortals; numinous chants harmonize without difference. Neither possible nor impossible, thought connects with rare subtle.

(Utmost truth waits on nothing; sometimes reins the flying dragon: essence harmonizes with utmost truth, thus able to ride without object, carry without form, hence waits on nothing. Sometimes reins the flying dragon. Long fasting washes the heart pure, naturally gathering at the profound capital. Ringing jade taps the jade bell: calling the dharma drum, naturally ringing. Ten splendors below are myriad saints responding and assembling. Emitting purple smoke naturally forming palace and pavilion. Treasure canopy means dharma crown. Gathering the Most High’s own countless true immortals holding lotus dharma flower banner, offering to empty birth, all scattering dharma wisdom’s blossoms, displaying my past vows. Past vows become boundless wisdom and vows, now explaining present vow fulfillment. Grasping the scepter, summoning the demon king: also fulfilling the vow to sever affairs. Dharma drum means dharma wisdom’s drum, gathering myriad spirits. Numinous chants harmonize without difference. Hence neither possible nor impossible, thought connects with rare subtle. Inner clarity then outer function; thus inner thought naturally connects, the rare subtle.)
