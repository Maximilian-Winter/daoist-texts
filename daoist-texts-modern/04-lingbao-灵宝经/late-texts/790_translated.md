#### The Great Golden Scripture of the Three Treasures

The Lord of Heavenly Treasure is the honored deity of the Great Cavern, and the Venerable Elder of Heavenly Treasure is the ancestral qi of this Lord. This Elder is the qi of the Primordial Supreme Void of the Great Mixed Cavern, the High Jade Emptiness, numbering ninety-nine trillion nine hundred ninety billion qi. Later, in the first year of the Dragon Han era, the Lord of Heavenly Treasure was transformed and born, and when issuing the scripture, he was titled the Supreme Great Possessor of the Jade Purity Palace.

The Lord of Numinous Treasure is the honored deity of the Mysterious Profound, and the Venerable Elder of Numinous Treasure is the ancestral qi of this Lord. This Elder is the qi of the Red Mixed Supreme Void of the Mysterious Purple Emptiness, numbering ninety-nine million nine hundred ninety-nine thousand qi. Later, at the opening of the Dragon Han chart, the Lord of Numinous Treasure was transformed and born, enduring one kalpa until the first year of the Red Bright era. When issuing the scripture to save beings, he was titled the Supreme Clarity of the Mysterious Capital of Jade Capital’s Seven Treasures, Purple Tenuity Palace.

The Lord of Spirit Treasure is the honored deity of the Cavern Spirit, and the Venerable Elder of Spirit Treasure is the ancestral qi of this Lord. This Elder is the qi of the Dark Silent Mysterious Thorough Origin Supreme Clear Emptiness, numbering ninety-nine million nine hundred ninety thousand qi. Later, in the first year of the Red Bright era, the Lord of Spirit Treasure was transformed and born, enduring two kalpas until the first year of the Supreme Sovereign era. When issuing the scripture, he was titled the Three Sovereigns’ Cavern Spirit of Supreme Clarity, Supreme Ultimate Palace.

Though these three titles differ in age and name, they are fundamentally one, divided into the three primordial original qi that govern. The Three Treasures are all honored deities of the three qi, named for the three qi born; the three titles together give birth to the nine qi. The nine qi emerge before the Great Void, hidden within the empty cavern, without light or form, without shape or name, without color or thread, without sound or voice, guiding and steering the world, opening and pioneering mysterious thoroughfares. Three colors of chaos, suddenly appearing and disappearing. Their motion pushes through countless extremes; the three qi open light, their qi pure, lofty, and clear. The accumulation of yang forms Heaven; the qi condenses sediment, accumulating stagnation to form Earth. The nine qi arrange the proper order: sun, moon, stars; yin and yang, Five Phases; people and all things—all receive generation and transformation. Heaven and Earth’s myriad transformations are not born without the nurturing of the Three Originals and the guidance of the nine qi; none can be born otherwise. The three qi are the honored of Heaven and Earth; the nine qi are the root of all things. Therefore, the three combine to form virtue, the utmost of Heaven and Earth. Humans receive life within the womb; the Three Originals nurture and nourish, the nine qi form shape. Thus, in the ninth month, the spirits spread, qi fills and enables voice, voice still holds spirit, the Nine Heavens acclaim celebration. The Great One holds the tally; the emperor commands fate, overseeing the record and registration, governing life and fixing calculation; the Five Emperors supervise birth; the Holy Mother guards the chamber; the heavenly gods and earthly spirits of the Three Realms all stand ready to guard. The Nine Heavens’ Sima stands in the courtyard, facing east reading the *Nine Heavens’ Scripture of Born Spirits* nine times. For males, ten thousand spirits chant reverently; for females, ten thousand spirits chant with devotion. Males receive the command of fate with respectful assent; females with respectful compliance. Thus life is born. If the Nine Heavens’ Sima does not issue the command, the myriad spirits do not chant reverently, life will not arise. For a person to be reborn into the human path, to wash the form in the sun, startling Heaven and shaking Earth, such honor is difficult to surpass. The Heaven-born and Earth spirits, the Three Realms all gather, yet do not treat lightly. When the time of birth comes, it is not lowly or base. Therefore one can cherish one’s form, preserve one’s spirit, honor one’s qi, strengthen one’s root, and never perish or decay, thus attaining spirit immortality—bone and flesh flying together, ascending to the Three Pure Ones, uniting with the virtue of the three qi, the nine qi all together. But if a person is born and yet does not honor their qi, esteem their form, treasure their life, or cherish their spirit, they bring death and decay upon themselves, departing from their original truth.

The *Nine Heavens Scripture of Born Spirits* is the qi of the three caverns flying mysteriously, the three combined into sound, forming numinous script, mingling a hundred spirits, hidden in rhyme and inner name, generating qi and forming shape—nature’s scripture. The Lord of Heavenly Treasure recites it to open the light of Heaven and Earth. The Lord of Numinous Treasure recites it to open the soul of the Nine Netherworlds’ long night. The Lord of Spirit Treasure recites it to command myriad spirits. The Great One recites it to perfect body and spirit. The Emperor recites it to form shape. The Nine Heavens recite it to give birth to humans. Scholars recite it to ascend Heaven. Ghost spirits hear it to ascend and transfer. Common folk hear it to prolong existence. Hidden souls hear it to open salvation. Decayed corpses hear it to emit smoke. Infants hear it to gain speech. Dead remains hear it to return to humanity. The mysteries of the Three Treasures give root to myriad beings; thus it is unknown to ghosts and spirits but heard by common folk. Those who study the supreme dao aspire to immortals, and upon gaining corpse liberation, extinguishing transmigration, ultimately return to the immortal dao, form and spirit united, not separated, both entering the true dao. Without this scripture, the womb’s formation stagnates, death qi hardens the root, true vision is not guarded, life qi lacks nourishment, the nine gates are blocked, the body does not give birth to spirit, only receiving a form, as if borrowing qi to act. Those who learn this method can sit and attain naturalness. The Three Treasures are revered, the Nine Heavens supremely true, secret and great, held in ninefold golden seals on the Purple Yang Jade Platform. Unless Heaven and Earth open as one, this scripture will not emerge. The Primordial Sovereign forbids the scripture; ghosts and spirits may not hear it. Those who steal it face the wind blade for ten thousand kalpas, their souls dead without rebirth. Follow the rules and revere it, form and spirit united as immortals. In the Three Originals’ palace, there is a golden name, purple characters carved in the book; those born again should be among the Three Pure Ones’ immortals and receive this scripture. When the fate and meeting arise, one should bring gold treasure, serve the master with heart, follow the rules and pledge acceptance, close the heart and practice reverently, carefully avoiding careless leakage, lest the wind blade examine the body.

Method of cultivation: A thousand days of long fasting, not concerning worldly affairs, all dust leaks exhausted, a leveled heart silently reciting, holding pure incense and observing precepts, entering a chamber facing east, knocking the teeth nine times, tuning the voice to correct qi, chanting the treasure scripture. One recitation sends the voice to the Nine Heavens. Twice recited, Heaven and Earth set reverence. Thrice, the Three Realms pay homage. Four times, the Heavenly Kings descend as immortals. Five times, the Five Emperors greet the True. Six times, the demon kings bind themselves. Seven times, the stars and constellations halt their gates. Eight times, the dark night brightens. Nine times, all the heavens arrive; all spirits guard the pavilion. One recitation penetrates Heaven, the embryonic source is declared and communicated. Two recitations resound through Earth, the fetal knot unties the root. Three recitations honor the spirit, the soul gate refines immortality. Four recitations, Heavenly Kings descend as immortals, the corporeal gate closes. Five recitations, the Five Emperors greet the True, the treasury is cool and clear. Six recitations, demon kings submit, the stomach tube generates fluid. Seven recitations, stars and constellations shine clearly, the orifices open to hear. Eight recitations, the dark night reveals light, the three divisions and eight scenes, fully arranging form and spirit. Nine recitations, all heavens arrive; the three gates, five viscera, six palaces, nine mansions, golden towers and jade chambers, twelvefold gates, purple portals, jade pavilions, thirty-six thousand joints, root source and origin—all at once give birth to spirit. Nine recitations make one cycle; one cycle complete, the Three Realms raise names, the Five Emperors distinguish friends, called True Persons. Ten cycles connect qi, commanding myriad spirits, demon kings protect and promote, arrayed among the upper heavens. One hundred cycles connect spirit, sitting to attain naturalness, the Great One’s talisman of crossing, the Primordial Lord’s birth. One thousand cycles connect numinosity, sitting and standing in deathlessness, immortal children and jade maidens, serving east and west. Ten thousand cycles complete the dao, galloping the dragon chariot, ascending the white sun of dawn.

The Primordial Heavenly Venerable dwells in stillness and leisure, reclining within the Yellow Chamber of the Cloud Palace, inside the seven treasures’ curtain. Serene and pure, refining the essence, savoring mysterious wisdom, bending down to study born spirits, the principle subtle and greatly mixed, howling and clear through the Nine Heavens. At this time, the Flying Heavenly Great Sage, the Limitless Divine King, Jade Assistant Supreme Minister, and Four Assistants attending morning service, observing pure fasting and establishing the festival, stand by his side. Leaning on a jade visage, sensing marvels, raising spiritual eyes to open the chest, secretly holding the spirit scripture and leaping with joy, feasting on heavenly sounds and receiving life, daring to seize the moment and realize the meeting, risking spiritual glances and opening the heart.

Then the Flying Heavenly Great Sage Limitless Divine King steps forward, bows, and says, addressing the Heavenly Venerable: “Your humble servant is fortunate to meet and serve the numinous pavilion, not limited by narrowness, honored to cleanse the dark laws, deeply realizing the condensed mystery, rising to the rank of Divine King. I command life and death, oversee heavenly immortals, reward and supervise the seven awakenings, survey distant realms, harmonize with the Supreme Minister, and attend morning service. Now the great cycle is about to begin, the three and five announce the time, the hundred and six respond to the occasion, yang nine stirs and rises, the great spring beats waves, myriad disasters afflict Heaven, the four palaces select and appoint to fill the populace. The three dynasties are chaotic; good and evil must be divided. You should labor your heart for the people, weary with the Three Officials, at the turning of rise and fall, matters must open and enable. Now entrusted to you, strive diligently. The treasure scripture is wondrous and weighty, the Nine Heavens’ numinous sound, bestowed upon the supreme sage, not heard by ghosts or spirits. Truly it has a pattern, performed once every forty thousand kalpas. Now, risking the prohibition, I entrust it to you secretly; do not lightly spread it. Ascend to the command of the Nine Heavens’ Sima, attend the immortal jade attendant, open the Purple Yang Jade Register, the cloud brocade pouch, and issue the *Nine Heavens Scripture of Born Spirits Jade Chapter*. The four assistants arrayed, the five elders supervise the true, the Great One commands the time, the Jade Emperor chants the oath, all according to the bright true canon. Facing south, kneeling long, handing it to the Flying Heavenly Limitless Divine King. After the ritual, the heavens return to their places.”

The Heavenly Venerable solemnly instructs the Flying Heavenly Divine King: “This chapter of the Nine Heavens is the qi of the three caverns flying mysteriously, the three combined into sound, forming true script, mingling a hundred spirits, hidden in rhyme and inner name. Therefore, the Great One tests and observes, embracing life in the Ten Directions, comprehending the mysterious void, opening the oath in cinnabar and blue. From countless kalpas of cause and condition, ancient names and imperial charts, none may view it. Those who glimpse the chapters, the Nine Ancestors all immortals. Choose those destined to be immortals, within seven hundred years, pure fasting a thousand days, bearing gold and silk pledging heart, transmitting by oath. Be cautious and enjoy blessing; neglect brings disaster. Enjoying blessing extends the Nine Ancestors’ merit, heavy as mountains and seas; inviting disaster brings punishment for countless kalpas, pain in poisonous soup, wind blade punishing the body—how can one not be cautious?”

#### Efficacy of Reciting the Scripture

Mount Qingcheng in Shu is the assembly mansion of immortals. Formerly, the Shu ruler Meng Chang went to pray and saw the Immortal Maiden Magu, who came to the fasting altar’s side. The Qingcheng magistrate had a beautiful woman named Zhang, who was then accepted and named Lihua, living together in the Venerable Elder’s temple. Suddenly one night, thunder and lightning flashed, violent rain and fierce wind uprooted buildings, soaring and scattering them. Zhang thus perished and was buried beneath the mountain. Decades later, on the Lantern Festival, the Daoist Li Ruochong of the Venerable Elder’s temple returned at night and rested before the mountain. Suddenly, beneath the bamboo shade, a woman wailed and came forth, approaching Ruochong to recite a poem:

“Alone I lie through autumn, hair fallen like cicadas,  
White poplar wind rises, sleep escapes me.  
Clear thoughts of past palace favors,  
Tears wet my robe, spoiling the green hairpin.”

After speaking, she wept again and retreated. Ruochong returned to the temple and saw men in robes and red shoes standing facing north as if in court. In the temple’s corridor were arranged prisoners; he saw jailers leading a woman, bound to an iron pillar, beaten, crying in pain. Upon closer inspection, it was the woman he met before the mountain. Soon, a good spirit pointed a sword at Ruochong and said: “Tonight, the Lantern Festival Heavenly Official, from the Five Mountains’ Venerable Elder, audits the death and life crimes; it is not proper to stand long.” Ruochong secretly fled until dawn and reported fully to his master Tang Dongqing. Tang said: “Do you know? This is Zhang Lihua. Once favored here, she profaned the Supreme Truth and thus gained this punishment. Having told you through poetry, you must save her.” Ruochong asked: “By what method can she be saved?” Tang said: “Simply turn the *Nine Heavens Scripture of Born Spirits* nine times, present the golden tally and white script, and she may escape this suffering and be reborn.” By chance, the shepherd Lu Chou of Linqiong set a yellow tally; Ruochong then placed the script and petition, reciting the scripture ten times, casting it at the ritual altar, thus saving her. When reciting the ninth scroll, just as the script was being burned, Ruochong turned and burned it. The next day, at Zhang’s burial site, four lines appeared in sand characters:

“The tally official swiftly knocks the night gate,  
Following the golden script out of the netherworld.  
Under the master’s recommendation, mercy is not shallow,  
Receiving the *Nine Heavens Scripture of Born Spirits* nine times.”

Ruochong carefully observed: The Most High bestows teachings, pitying all beings, thus establishing a door of salvation to aid the path of life and death. Alas! Those who wish to save the departed should truly revere this jade text, as a swift path to transcendence. I respectfully write this at the scripture’s end as encouragement for reverence.
