The Heavenly Treasure Lord is the honored deity of the Great Cavern; the Heavenly Treasure Elder is the ancestral qi of the Heavenly Treasure Lord. This Elder is the qi of the Primordial Great Void Supreme Jade Emperor, numbering ninety-nine trillion nine hundred ninety billion qi. Later, in the first year of the Dragon Han era, the Heavenly Treasure Lord was transformed and born; at the time of issuing this scripture, he was titled the Supreme Great Abundance of the Jade Pure Palace.

The Numinous Treasure Lord is the honored deity of the Cavern Mystery; the Numinous Treasure Elder is the ancestral qi of the Numinous Treasure Lord. This Elder is the qi of the Red Primordial Great Void Supreme Jade Emptiness, numbering nine hundred ninety-nine million nine hundred ninety-nine thousand qi. Later, at the opening of the Dragon Han chart, the Numinous Treasure Lord was transformed and born; after one kalpa, in the first year of the Red Bright era, the scripture was issued to save people, titled the Supreme Clarity Mysterious Capital Two Capitals Seven Treasures Purple Tenuity Palace.

The Spirit Treasure Lord is the honored deity of the Cavern Spirit; the Spirit Treasure Elder is the ancestral qi of the Spirit Treasure Lord. This Elder is the qi of the Dark Still Mysterious Penetration Primordial Jade Emptiness, numbering ninety-nine million nine hundred ninety thousand qi. Later, in the first year of the Red Bright era, the Spirit Treasure Lord was transformed and born; after two kalpas, in the first year of the Supreme Sovereign era, the scripture was issued, titled the Three Sovereigns Cavern Spirit Supreme Clarity Supreme Ultimate Office.

Though these three titles differ in years and names, they are fundamentally one. They are divided into the Profound Primordial Three Qi, governing the Three Treasures. All are honored deities of the Three Qi, called the Birth of Three Qi. The three titles combined give birth to the Nine Qi. The Nine Qi emerge before the Great Void, hidden within the Cavern Emptiness. Without light or form, without shape or name, without color or trace, without sound or voice, the Dao moves and governs the world, opening and revealing the mysterious penetration. Three colors blend in chaos, suddenly appearing and disappearing. The movement pushes through countless extremes, and the Three Qi open light. The qi is pure, lofty, and clear; accumulated yang forms Heaven. The qi congeals into dregs; accumulated stagnation forms Earth. The Nine Qi array in order: sun, moon, stars, constellations, yin and yang, Five Phases, people, and all things—all receive generation and transformation. Heaven and Earth’s myriad changes are not born of the Three Origins’ nurture alone, but guided by the Nine Qi; none can be born without them. The Three Qi are the honored ones of Heaven and Earth; the Nine Qi are the root of all things. Thus, the three combine to form virtue, the utmost of Heaven and Earth. When a person is born within the womb, the Three Origins nurture and nourish, the Nine Qi form the shape; therefore, at nine months the spirit spreads, the qi fills, the voice is able, and the spirit is complete; the Nine Heavens proclaim celebration. The Great One holds the tally; the Emperor commands the orders; the Registrar records the registers; the Fate Master determines the calculations; the Five Emperors oversee birth; the Holy Mother guards the chamber; the heavenly gods and earthly spirits of the Three Realms all stand guard. The Nine Heavens Registrar reads the *Nine Heavens Birth of Spirits Treasure Chapter* nine times facing east in the courtyard; for males, ten thousand spirits chant reverently; for females, ten thousand spirits chant respectfully; males receive the Fate Master’s solemn assent; females receive the Fate Master’s solemn compliance—thus life is born. If the Nine Heavens Registrar does not issue the command chapter, and the myriad spirits do not chant reverently, life will never arise. For a person to be reborn into the human path, to wash the form in the sun, to astonish Heaven and shake Earth, such honor is difficult to surpass. Heaven’s essence, Earth’s spirits, and the Three Realms all arrive together, yet do not treat lightly. At the moment of birth, it is not lowly. Therefore, one can cherish the form, preserve the spirit, honor the qi, strengthen the root, and never die or decay, but attain spirit-immortality; flesh and bone ascend together to the Three Clarities, uniting with the Three Qi’s virtue and the Nine Qi’s completeness. But if a person is born yet cannot honor their qi, esteem their form, treasure their fate, or love their spirit, they bring death and decay upon themselves, departing from their original truth.

The *Nine Heavens Birth of Spirits Chapter* is the flying mysterious qi of the Three Caverns, the three combined into sound, forming numinous script, mingling with a hundred spirits, hidden in rhyme and inner names, generating qi and forming shape—this is the chapter of nature. The Heavenly Treasure recites it to open the light of Heaven and Earth. The Numinous Treasure recites it to open the soul of the Nine Netherworlds’ long night. The Spirit Treasure recites it to command myriad spirits. The Great One recites it to perfect body and spirit. The Emperor recites it to form shape. The Nine Heavens recite it to birth people. Scholars recite it to ascend Heaven. Ghostly spirits hear it to ascend and transfer. Ordinary folk hear it to prolong existence. Wandering souls hear it to open salvation. Withered decay hears it to emit smoke. Infants hear it to gain speech. Dead corpses hear it to return to humanity. The Three Treasures’ divine mysteries are the roots of myriad beings; thus, they are unknown to ghosts and spirits, but heard by ordinary people. Those who study the supreme dao aspire to immortality; upon achieving corpse liberation, extinguishing transmigration, and turning the wheel, they ultimately return to the immortal dao, where form and spirit are united, not separate, both entering the true Dao. Without this scripture, the womb’s formation stagnates, death qi hardens the root, true radiance is not preserved, life qi lacks passage, the nine gates are blocked, the body does not generate spirit, merely bearing a form as if borrowing qi to move. Those who learn this method can sit and attain naturalness, honored by the Three Treasures, reaching the utmost truth of the Nine Heavens, secreted within the Great Abundance’s ninefold golden pattern of the Purple Yang Jade Platform. Unless Heaven and Earth have just opened, this scripture does not emerge. It is a forbidden scripture of the Primordial Beginning, unheard by ghosts and spirits; those who steal it face ten thousand kalpas of the wind blade, soul death without rebirth. Following the prescribed rules and revering it, form and spirit unite as immortals. In the Three Origins’ palace, there is a golden name inscribed in purple characters on the scripture: those destined to be Three Clarities immortals in the next life shall obtain this scripture. If the fate and meeting are right, bring gold treasure to offer the master, sincerely follow the rules, pledge the oath, close the heart to practice reverently, and be careful not to lightly leak it lest the wind blade tests the body.

### Method of Cultivation:

Observe a thousand days of long fasting, without concern for worldly affairs; all dust and leaks exhausted, pacify the heart and silently recite. Hold pure incense and observe precepts; enter the chamber facing east; knock the teeth nine times to open the passages; regulate the voice and correct the qi; recite the treasure chapter.

Recite once, the sound reaches the Nine Heavens.  
Recite twice, Heaven and Earth set reverence.  
Recite thrice, the Three Realms pay homage.  
Recite four times, the Heavenly Kings descend as immortals.  
Recite five times, the Five Emperors greet the true.  
Recite six times, the demon kings bind their bodies.  
Recite seven times, the stars and constellations halt their gates.  
Recite eight times, the dark night brightens with light.  
Recite nine times, all under Heaven arrive; all spirits guard the pavilion.

One recitation penetrates Heaven, the original womb is proclaimed and communicated.  
Two recitations resound through Earth, the fetus unties and roots are resolved.  
Three recitations honor the spirit, the soul gates refine immortality.  
Four recitations bring Heavenly Kings descending as immortals, the soul gates close.  
Five recitations bring the Five Emperors greeting the true, the treasury cool and pure.  
Six recitations bind demon kings in submission, the stomach channels generate fluids.  
Seven recitations brighten stars and constellations, the orifices open to wisdom.  
Eight recitations illuminate the dark night, the three departments and eight scenes complete form and spirit.  
Nine recitations bring all under Heaven to arrive; the three gates, five viscera, six palaces, nine mansions, golden towers, jade chambers, twelvefold gates, purple portals, jade pavilions with thirty-six thousand joints, root source and original beginning—all at once give birth to spirit.

Nine recitations make one cycle; one cycle complete, the Three Realms raise the name; the Five Emperors separate friends; this is called the True Person.  
Ten cycles penetrate qi, commanding myriad spirits; demon kings protect and recommend, arrayed among the upper Heavens.  
One hundred cycles penetrate spirit, sitting teaching naturalness; the Great One crosses the talisman, the Primordial Lord is born.  
One thousand cycles penetrate numinosity, sitting, standing, dying; immortal youths and jade maidens serve east and west.  
Ten thousand cycles complete the dao, galloping the dragon chariot, ascending the white sun at dawn.

The Primordial Heavenly Venerable, at that time, rested in quiet seclusion, reclining within the Yellow Chamber of the Cloud Palace, inside the seven treasures’ canopy, peacefully nurturing simplicity, refining the empty azure to practice truth, savoring cavernous wisdom, bowing to study the birth of spirits, the subtle principle of the Great Chaos, whistling clearly through the Nine Heavens. At this time, the Flying Heavenly Great Sage, the Limitless Divine King, the Jade Assistant Supreme Administrator, and the Four Assistants to the Morning Service, observing pure fasting and establishing the festival, attended nearby. With jade-like countenance and subtle perception, gazing with spiritual eyes to open compassion, secretly holding the divine chapter and leaping with joy, feasting on heavenly sounds to gain life, daring to seize the opportunity to understand and meet, risking spiritual glance to open the heart.

Then the Flying Heavenly Great Sage and Limitless Divine King advanced, bowed, and said:  
“Your humble ministers are fortunate to meet and serve the Numinous Pavilion, not begrudging the narrowness, but honored to bathe in the dark ford, deeply realizing the profound mystery. Elevated to Divine King, commanding life and death, leading the heavenly immortals, rewarding and supervising the seven awakenings, surveying distant realms, harmonizing with the Supreme Administrator, attending the morning service. Now the great cycle approaches, the triple five announces the time, the hundred six responds to the opportunity, yang nine stirs and rises, the vast spring beats waves, myriad disasters afflict Heaven, the Four Palaces select and elect to fill the people. The three generations are chaotic; good and evil must be divided. You must labor your heart for the multitudes, weary at the rise and fall of the Three Officials. Matters must be opened and enabled; now entrusted to you, so strive diligently. The treasure scripture is wondrous and weighty, the Nine Heavens’ numinous sound, bestowed upon the Supreme Sage, unheard by ghosts and spirits. Clear and true with a pattern, once every forty thousand kalpas it is enacted. Now, braving prohibition, I entrust it to you secretly; do not lightly transmit it. Ascend to command the Nine Heavens Registrar, attend the immortal jade youth, open the Purple Yang Jade Chest embroidered with clouds, and issue the *Nine Heavens Birth of Spirits Jade Chapter*. The Four Assistants arrayed, the Five Elders supervising truth, the Great One commanding the stars, the Jade Emperor chanting the oath, all conforming to the bright true canon. Facing south, kneeling long, handing it to the Flying Heavenly Limitless Divine King. After the ritual, the Heavens return to their places.”

The Heavenly Venerable solemnly told the Flying Heavenly Divine King:  
“This chapter of the Nine Heavens is the flying mysterious qi of the Three Caverns, the three combined into sound, forming true script, mingled with a hundred spirits, hidden rhyme and inner names. Therefore, the Great One tests and observes, nurturing life in the Ten Directions, comprehending the cavernous void, opening the oath in cinnabar and blue, without billions of kalpa causes and conditions, with ancestral names and imperial charts, cannot be consulted or seen. Those who glimpse the chapters are the Nine Ancestors united as immortals. Choose those destined to be immortals; within seven hundred years, observe a thousand days of pure fasting, bring gold and silk, swear the heart and pledge the oath to transmit. Be careful and you will enjoy blessings; leak and disaster will come. Blessings and fortune extend to the Nine Ancestors, virtue as weighty as mountains and seas; invite disaster and you will suffer exile for billions of kalpas, pain in poisonous broth, the wind blade punishing—how can you not be cautious?”

### Beginning of the Azure Pure Subtle Heavenly Treasure Chapter

The Primordial Beginning’s cavern emptiness is without form; the Three Qi essence ascends the gate. Purple countenance gazes at the Great Void; four lights plant spiritual roots. Wondrous transformation issues from the eastern jade; three flutter and rise to the western Kun. Called the Nine Mysterious Pure, five blossoms wear brocade clouds. The departing net shines the divine lamp; seven essences illuminate the northern mystery. Floating and drifting above the Supreme Clarity’s domain, splendid and majestic is the One Emperor honored. Lofty and noble is the Supreme Chapter; feathered youths flutter in confusion. Flowing fragrance originally without color, entering the myriad immortal crowds. Left turns the three-flow kalpa; right turns the Nine Heavens’ gate. Golden blossoms tassel jade youths; eight winds dance the empty wheel. The four seasons have no stopping mechanism; blue and white early brightness divide. Ninety-nine changes the kalpa’s movement; three threes pass one spring. Heaven and Earth have their final meeting; secret stirring returns in reversal. Cavern clarity, orthodox unity method, strictly cultivating the six heavenly patterns. Great peace returns to emptiness; serving and assisting the Later Sage Lord.

### Primordial White Yu Remnant Numinous Treasure Chapter

Numinous wind rises at the western gate; brocade clouds form the eastern jade. The Three Qi shine on the jade islet; flowing fragrance rides the eastern light. Jade blossoms scatter in the wind; suddenly brightening the Nine Clarity. Towering forests shine the vermilion sun; yellow waters chase the moon’s birth. Within, a child gathering herbs, wearing feathers and donning flying blue. Gale scenes lead myriad winds; carefree banquets on the green palanquin. Overall commanding the Nine Empty Wheels; operations open myriad calculations. Left commands the three heavenly patterns; right governs the six heavenly soldiers. Inspecting qi returning to the cavern void; six degrees respond to the movement’s tilt. Kalpa operations have their meeting; who can measure defeat or success? Vast waves wheel the numinous pole; six directions leave no shape behind. White corpses drift in the long stream; solitary souls thus regain spirit. Sorrowful at this coming and going, one then realizes the orthodox law’s clarity. To the utmost study, add refined cultivation; East Flower forms the jade name. Joyful are the white slip people, together rejoicing in great peace.

### Mysterious Yellow Great Red Spirit Treasure Chapter

The cavern gate moves the heavenly rope; five qi wheel the three subtleties. Purple portal emits jade slips; golden gate receives divine radiance. Eight meetings cross true wind; bright and shining, the double name opens. Beyond the Nine Clarity at Heaven’s edge; lofty and noble the high spirit returns. Three colors return to emptiness; four seasons respond to the jade domain. The River Marquis already drums the tally; Five Phases secretly push each other. Six degrees have no final kalpa; the cycle’s peak rides qi to return. Ten thousand demons spread across Heaven; groups of villains finally spit out might. The multitudes bear disaster and clash; accumulated corpses cause sorrow. Marvelous indeed is the orthodox law’s text; principle and kalpa clearly never decline. At the utmost time, serve and welcome; the contract is in the Nine Heavens’ flight. With you I await great peace, rest the heart and fly without wings.
