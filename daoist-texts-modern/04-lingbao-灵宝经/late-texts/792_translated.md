#### Preface to the Chapter on Spirit-Birth of the Nine Heavens

Form cannot endure long; what endures is the dao of qi in motion. Qi cannot flow constantly; what flows constantly is essence as its root. When these three blend into one, the dao of the spirit-immortals is no longer difficult to attain.

The essentials of the Chapter on Spirit-Birth of the Nine Heavens are fourfold: first, cherish the form; second, preserve the spirit; third, honor the qi; fourth, secure the root. A person’s form is like a house; though temporarily assembled, how can one let it fall to ruin, daily crumbling and peeling away? Then there would be no people exposed to the world. Moreover, the form is where myriad spirits dwell, where one’s true nature resides, where clarity and wisdom find their trust. Cultivators who wish to succeed must first say: cherish the form. Yang accumulates to birth spirit, yin accumulates to birth form. Form and spirit cannot part even for a moment. When the form is firm, the spirit can remain long; when the house is sturdy, the person can dwell long. If the work is unfinished but the yin shell withers first, this is the trouble of many learners. The foolish do not know this, thinking the outer form and skeleton, eyes and ears, are like dust, dirt, or chaff, and so neglect them. Once cast into the realm of profit and loss, honor and disgrace, and never accomplished in life, such a person is no different from death. Now it is not only about cherishing, but must make form and spirit serve each other, valuing that flesh and bone fly together. Avoid heat and wind, do not lie in wetness in summer, sitting too long harms bones, laboring too long harms sinews. Reflecting on this principle, in every movement and expression, at every moment, cherish is required. No leopard’s food outside, no Zhang Yi’s disease inside. Beginning with cherishing the form, ending with practicing the form — is this mere chance? Form and spirit are one, never apart; hence the second is to preserve the spirit. Spirit is the essence of yang, a portion of Heaven. Zhuangzi said: “Not departing from essence is called spirit.” How does human spirit descend? It comes by destiny. Thus, in the ninth month, spirit is distributed, destiny is fulfilled. Once spirit arrives and dwells, like a house with inhabitants, arranging beams and rafters, carving doors and windows, seeing, hearing, eating, and resting — all proceed through it. Its birth shakes Heaven and startles Earth; its movement is to grasp with hands and walk with feet. Through communication and transformation, sitting, standing, and disappearing all serve me. Some live their whole life without knowing this; once suddenly passing away, they rot with the soil. The spirit does not wait but departs at midnight. Such a person never knows what spirit is — how tragic! The scripture says: “Why die to make the spirit weep?” Spirit can govern qi; hence the third is to honor the qi. The vastness of Heaven and Earth moves only by qi; the brightness of sun and moon shines only by qi. Humans and all things observe this alike. Differences arise only between right and wrong. The turtle and crane do not wither because they receive pure qi; the pine and cypress endure because they have firm qi. Only humans receive correct qi but not fully. The scripture says: “Three qi are the honor of Heaven and Earth; nine qi are the root of all things.” If a person can preserve the root of nine qi and align with the honor of three qi above, how precious to hold so tightly! The trouble is ignorance. People only value qi but do not know its origin — is this not shallow? Qi originally arises from essence, essence stored in the kidneys; thus to know qi is to know essence as its root. Knowing the root, one can speak of fulfilling destiny. Hence the fourth is to secure the root. The scripture says: “All things, myriad and countless, each returns to its root. Returning to the root is called stillness; stillness is called returning to destiny.” Cultivators must keep stillness to guard it, then the root deepens and the stem is firm. Thus Zhuangzi said: “Do not shake your essence, then you may live long.” When form obtains spirit to dwell, spirit obtains qi to be numinous, one can return to the primordial, one can complete the Golden Elixir — this is to unite the three origins’ virtue and harmonize the nine qi. Originally, the Chapter on Spirit-Birth of the Nine Heavens is indeed a forbidden scripture from the upper Heaven, not transmitted casually during the crossing of kalpas. Its aim is that when customs are overturned and decline prevails, it must be raised to the land of benevolence and longevity, enlightening those yet to awaken. First it presents the Three Treasures, revealing the nurturing of Heaven, Earth, humans, and all things. Then it unfolds nine chapters, establishing the nine heavens. Humans receive nine qi as their life’s origin; the head resembles the nine heavens, above arrayed with nine palaces; the body contains nine mansions, symbolizing the nine provinces; outside open nine gates, symbolizing the nine fields. The use of the whole body, how could it be apart from the nine qi? Those who use it fully ascend the nine heavens; those who use it secondarily end in corpse liberation; those who do not know its use merely bear a form, like carrying qi to move. This dao is possessed by all but few can attain it — why? Because selfish hearts prevail and worldly affairs seize them. In the time of the Three Sovereigns, people were simple and sincere, the great dao was not hidden, all knew the essentials of self-cultivation, thus some lived twelve hundred years and ascended. Hence the scripture says: “In ancient times there were true persons who held Heaven and Earth, grasped yin and yang, breathed essence and qi, stood alone guarding spirit, their flesh and muscles as one; thus they could live as long as Heaven and Earth, without end.” Since the Qin fire calamity, the books of the Three Sovereigns were lost and unseen; only the Difficult Classic and Basic Questions remain, studied by physicians. Thus the preface says: The books of the Three Sovereigns spoke of the great dao, but later generations lost them in decline. The methods of self-cultivation and life-nourishing, though unbroken like threads, were gradually replaced by Buddhist teachings, which delight in extinction; cutting off limbs and abandoning roots is worse, so our great dao’s learning becomes ever more obscure. Recently, returning southeast, I met the worthy Ren Gong of my village, who said: The Chapter on Spirit-Birth is truly the great origin of the Daoist school; many read it but find it hard to understand. Though there is the commentary of Jade Toad Master, its words are brief and essential, regrettably difficult for learners to compose. If explained in detail, so that all may easily understand, it would not be without benefit. Its words strike the heart; in leisure from alchemy, I wish to study it. Once Ouyang Wenzhong, who in life disliked Daoist learning, in old age guarded the Bo shrine and began to awaken. One day he visited a recluse at Stone Pond, wishing to learn. The recluse said: Your house is already broken; it is hard to speak of this. But if you can understand the earlier realm, that is nearly enough. Wenzhong, a man of virtue and literary excellence, surely had the capacity to receive the dao. Yet he said he lost it at the eastern corner, only grasping the earlier realm; how much more so those less gifted than he? Those who obtain this dao, the Nine Ancestors all transcend, so why fear the earlier realm? To forcibly twist oneself is to bind oneself; to be soft is to bind oneself; can one not strive? On the first day of the fifth month, the first year of Kaixi of the Great Song, the Daoist Wang Xichao of Mianzhou’s Chongxu Temple penned this preface.

#### Commentary on the Scripture of the Jade Chapter of the Spirit-Birth of the Nine Heavens, Naturally from the Mysterious and Numinous Treasure Cavern, Volume One

Commentary by the Daoist Wang Xichao of Mianzhou’s Chongxu Temple

The Heavenly Treasure Lord is the honored spirit of the Great Cavern; the Elder of Heavenly Treasure is the ancestral qi of the Heavenly Treasure Lord. The Elder is the qi of the Great Void of the Mixed Cavern, the Supreme Primordial Jade Void, amounting to ninety-nine trillion nine hundred ninety billion qi. Later, in the first year of the Dragon Han, the Heavenly Treasure Lord was born; at the time of writing, he was called the Most High Great Abundance of the Jade Pure Palace.

Heaven and Earth are the great form. Kalpas and cycles are the great time. Where there is form, there is number; where there is time, there is change. When numbers exhaust and time changes, all returns to ruin — except the Three Pure Ones, the Most Holy, and the True Kings of the Nine Heavens, who are not bound by form nor captured by number. Thus kalpas endure long, and the later Heaven does not age. The Heavenly Treasure Lord is the ancestor of myriad daos, called the Great Cavern Honored Spirit. Thus, above the Three Caverns in the teachings, there is the Great Cavern method, discussing the dao of returning wind and mixed essence, which lower-level lesser immortals cannot comprehend. Seen in the human body, he is the Supreme Unity Emperor Lord. According to the Supreme Clarity Great Cavern Scripture: “Above connects the Three Origins; below connects myriad things; stillness serves as the body; movement serves as the spirit.” Also called the Elder, he is the father of fathers. The Three Origins are: one, the Mixed Cavern Great Void Origin; two, the Red Mixed Great Void Origin; three, the Dark Stillness Profound Communication Origin. The Zhengyi Scripture says: “The Great Void is unchanging; the three qi shine therein.” The Great Void is the beginning before beginning; the Three Origins are the root of creation, rooted in nothingness and beginning with the origin; the three qi are born therefrom. The name “Primordial Origin” derives from this. Thus the Three Origins give birth to the Three Qi, which are the natural qi of the Great Void. The void arises from mystery, mystery arises from origin, origin arises from beginning. Hence the Opening Heaven Scripture says: “The primal qi moves and Heaven and Earth stand.” Though the three qi are born, they have no seal yet, thus called Mixed Cavern. The Scripture of Deliverance says: “Mixed Cavern Red Script, the supreme true one, opens the bright ancestral kalpa, giving birth to myriad heavens.” The three qi’s true spirits in the Three Origins Palace are the primordial essence of water and fire, corresponding below to the human heart and kidney palaces, governing the Northern Dipper in Heaven, and the talismans, spiritual scripts, and alliances. If one cultivates the dao and preserves truth, merits complete, then these three spirits ascend with oneself — this is the dao of mixture. The three spirits are the three generals Tang, Ge, and Zhou. Once, during the Zhihe era, Emperor Renzong was ill for three days. In his dream, he wandered through thorns, lost his way; a divine person clad in golden armor said to the emperor: “Heaven grants Your Majesty a heart of transformation, bestowing a lifespan of one cycle.” The emperor asked: “Where shall I go?” The divine person replied: “Please allow me to escort you in my chariot.” The emperor boarded and asked who he was; the reply: “I am General Ge.” The emperor awoke, ordered a search of the Daozang, and indeed found General Ge, who governs the Heavenly Gate; thus his rank was elevated and a temple established in the capital. Alas, no one reported this at the time, thinking him merely a spirit of the body. The Jade Void qi is originally one qi, so the three titles are the same. In the collection are the titles Jade Void and Jade Emperor, both honorifics. Jade symbolizes virtue, Emperor symbolizes Heaven. The first year of Dragon Han is the ancestral kalpa. Dragon signifies transformation; Han signifies greatness. Before Heaven and Earth formed, one qi roamed the Great Void, winding and twisting, changing endlessly, forming spirit and essence. The Celestial True Emperor saw the kalpa open and named it Dragon Han. Thus the Scripture of Divine Transformation records the Three Sovereigns all as dragon-bodied with human heads. At the kalpa’s beginning was the Dragon Ancestor Great Emperor, also the Dragon Ancestor Star; among the thirty-two heavens is the Dragon Transformation Brahma Heavenly Emperor — all this meaning.

The Numinous Treasure Lord is the honored spirit of the Mysterious Cavern; the Elder of Numinous Treasure is the ancestral qi of the Numinous Treasure Lord. The Elder is the qi of the Red Mixed Great Void, the Profound Supreme Purple Void, amounting to ninety-nine million nine hundred ninety-nine thousand qi. Later, at the opening of the Dragon Han, the Numinous Treasure Lord was born; after one kalpa, at the first year of Red Brightness, he issued scripture, delivering people under the name Supreme Clarity Mysterious Capital Jade Capital Seven Treasures Purple Tenuity Palace.

Jade Pure is the Heavenly Treasure Lord; Supreme Clarity is the Numinous Treasure Lord; Great Clarity is the Spirit Treasure Lord. Thus knowing the Three Treasures’ titles, the Heavenly Treasure Lord should be called the honored spirit of the Mysterious Truth. Yet now he is called the honored spirit of the Great Cavern, not the Mysterious Truth — why? Because the Three Caverns were not yet divided, collectively called the Great Cavern, like the undifferentiated Two Forms called the Supreme Ultimate. Yet the Great Cavern originally is the dao of returning wind and mixture; mixture means the Three Caverns are not divided. The Primordial Law King is the lord of creation, named by the Pre-Heavenly Sage. The Mysterious Truth appears after the Three Caverns divide; the Primordial is also called so. Now the scripture’s meaning of Great Cavern is from the root; the Numinous Treasure Lord is from the trace. According to the Daozang’s Preface to Many Works: “Mysterious Cavern is the root; Numinous Treasure is the trace.” Great Cavern’s qi is born from the void, flowing to become Mysterious Truth, then Mysterious Cavern. The teaching of Mysterious Cavern is named Numinous Treasure, truly the ancestor of the teaching. The trace means the text. Before the Dragon Han’s opening, there was no writing; with the opening, writing first appeared. The Daoist Origins says: “The Daoist teaching arises from the Three Origins; from root descends trace, then scriptures and proclamations unfold.” Now the Numinous Treasure Lord was born at the Dragon Han’s opening, truly the beginning of scripture issuance and deliverance. Observing his title and time, one knows he is the ancestor of the teaching. Also called the Prime Capital Jade Capital Seven Treasures Purple Tenuity Palace, the place of the Daozang. Yet the Most High Jade Void qi, reaching ninety-nine trillion nine hundred ninety billion qi, when arriving at the Red Mixed Great Void qi, has already lost billions of qi — thus kalpa qi numbers differ, no longer as before, due to human self-calling. Moreover, in ancient times some lived ten million years; in the times of Tang and Yu, some lived over one hundred years; now people only reach seventy — is this not different from before? All receive this qi; why the difference? Because life and death cycle around; once born, then extinguished; once extinguished, reborn; wisdom dims and qi is consumed. Now not like before, later not like now. Like one sheng of water, repeatedly poured into different vessels, drops seep away, gradually less than a sheng; day after day, month after month, its drying is foreseeable. Thus life and death revolve like a turning wheel, never stopping — deeply sorrowful and pitiable. Reverently considering the Flying Heavenly Spirit King, who takes life and death as his charge, braving prohibitions to earnestly request that people know the root of spirit birth, extinguishing the turning wheel, ultimately returning to the immortal dao — his intent can be called utmost. Having obtained human form, do not recklessly waste life and death; instead, return to reflection and return light, avoiding loss of self among other kinds; then the immortal dao is still somewhat attainable.

The Spirit Treasure Lord is the honored spirit of the Mysterious Spirit; the Elder of Spirit Treasure is the ancestral qi of the Spirit Treasure Lord. The Elder is the qi of the Dark Stillness Profound Communication Origin, Supreme Clear Void, amounting to ninety-nine million nine hundred ninety thousand qi. Later, at the first year of Red Brightness, the Spirit Treasure Lord was born; after two kalpas, at the first year of Supreme Emperor, he issued scripture, called the Three Sovereigns Mysterious Spirit Great Clarity Supreme Ultimate Palace.

The Jade Toad Master Zhao said: Jade Pure is the Metal Palace, Supreme Clarity is the Fire Palace, Great Clarity is the Earth Palace — not including Wood and Water. Learners sometimes doubt this and do not seek its principle. Yet among the Five Phases, Metal is chief; Metal originally has no qi, but nurtures qi in the Zhen direction, which is Wood. Metal also overcomes Wood, like husband and wife; with Water it generates, like mother and child. Of the five substances, only Metal does not decay: entering Fire it does not burn, entering Water it does not wet, entering Earth it is not harmed, entering Wood it is not damaged. The perfected person understands this to refine the elixir; thus Metal, Fire, Earth are sought by analogy, and Water and Wood meet without agreement. The ancient immortal poem says: “The Five Phases all reside in Earth; the Four Symbols never part from Metal.” The ancestral qi of the Three Treasures comes from the Three Origins. Examining the scripture, the words “Dark Stillness Profound Communication Leak Origin” appear not only in the Shu edition but everywhere. The Chapter on Spirit-Birth of the Nine Heavens, after being proofread by the royal family and officials, still has such. Also “Supreme Unity Try Observation” was mistaken for “Warning Observation,” and such errors are many. The Mixed Cavern Great Void Origin Supreme Jade Void qi, Red Mixed Great Void Origin Supreme Purple Void qi — since it says “Most High Jade Void qi,” then “Red Mixed Great Void” seems missing a character, should be “Upper Jade Void qi.” The Heavenly Treasure Lord is called Most High, the Numinous Treasure Lord should be called Original High, without “Most High.” As for Dark Stillness Profound Communication, the “Leak” character is missing, should be “Most High Jade Void qi.” Recently, in proofreading, the Daozang lacks the character or has the “Leak” character, whose strokes are similar; perhaps in initial transcription it was mistakenly doubled, so it was removed; otherwise, missing a character, how could there be three origins’ qi, only two origins? The principle would not hold. The “Leak” character should be added below Dark Stillness Profound Communication, and above Jade Void qi, awaiting the learned to correct. This is the Spring and Autumn doubt transmitting doubt theory. The Three Origins appear in the Scripture of the Three Caverns Sect. Since Wang Xichao entered the dao, he lamented the teaching’s excessive breadth, lack of master teachers, and many errors. Sometimes those who understand raise themselves arrogantly, so-called carving without salt. Also, considering recent fasting and rituals publishing texts, often white is called black, nothing is called something — the learned should see for themselves.

Though these three titles differ in age and name, they are fundamentally one. Divided into Profound Origin and Primordial Three Qi, governing the Three Treasures, all are the honored spirits of the Three Qi, called the birth of the Three Qi; the three titles together give birth to nine qi. The nine qi arise before the Great Void, hidden in the empty cavern. No light, no image, no form, no name, no color, no thread, no sound, no voice.

Yi the Archer could not make people without self-praise; the dao descended as qi, yet could not make people without name or title. From one comes three, from three comes nine. Though the three titles differ, their essence is one and the same. When one strives for them and fails, is it not of the metaphysical? When one reads their titles, is it not of the physical? The three titles are: Heavenly Treasure Lord called Most High Great Abundance of the Jade Pure Palace; Numinous Treasure Lord called Supreme Clarity Mysterious Capital Jade Capital Seven Treasures Purple Tenuity Palace; Spirit Treasure Lord called Three Sovereigns Mysterious Spirit Great Clarity Supreme Ultimate Palace. At the beginning of Primordial Origin, there was no Heaven and Earth; one body gave birth to myriad things, hence called Great Abundance Jade Pure Palace. At Dragon Han’s opening, Heaven and Earth divided; Numinous Treasure was born in the Yucha Mountains of Xina Heaven; at that time Primordial Heavenly King sat on Jade Capital Mountain, inhaling qi from above, drinking spring water below. The Jade Capital Mountain palace was adorned with seven treasures of gold and jade, centered on the Purple Tenuity Upper Palace. After Numinous Treasure Lord was born, Primordial Heavenly King appointed him, hence this title. At Red Brightness, the time of the Three Sovereigns’ division, Spirit Treasure Lord was born, marking the beginning of the descent of the Mysterious Spirit, hence the title Three Sovereigns Mysterious Spirit Great Clarity Supreme Ultimate Palace. The Supreme Ultimate Palace is one of the nine palaces where immortals dwell. Within the palace are officials, true persons, nobles, each with their place and order. Though the three titles differ, they are all one body of Primordial Origin. Dragon Han is the former kalpa, Red Brightness the middle kalpa, Kaihuang the current kalpa. The Profound Primordial Origin is the unborn mysterious qi, accumulating purity to become blue; the cavern gives birth to primordial qi, accumulating emptiness to become white; the void gives birth to beginning qi, accumulating light to become yellow. When the three qi are sufficient, they combine to give birth to nine qi. The nine qi are the one yellow unfolding qi, the nine qi. The three qi all originate from the three voids: the Great Void belongs to Jade Pure; the Great Space belongs to Supreme Clarity; the Empty Cavern belongs to Great Clarity. One qi born from the Great Void is called the Supreme Beginning; one from Great Space before it is the Supreme Origin; hidden in the Empty Cavern is the Supreme Element. Long ago, Primordial Heavenly King and the True Kings of the Nine Heavens were born before the nine qi; at that time there was no year or month; each qi was separated by ninety-nine million nine hundred ninety-one thousand li, which was one year. When it emerges before Great Space, hidden in the Empty Cavern, greeting it one cannot see its head, following it one cannot see its tail; no light, image, form, name, color, thread, sound, or voice — who can know it? Hence it is said: the dao and its methods are natural.

The dao moves and governs the world, opening and unfolding the mysterious communication. Three colors of chaos, sometimes existing, sometimes vanishing. Movement pushes the numbers to their extreme; the three qi open and shine. Qi is clear, high, and pure; accumulating yang forms Heaven. Qi condenses and stagnates; accumulating blockage forms Earth. The nine qi arrange correctly: sun, moon, stars, and constellations. Yin and yang, Five Phases, people and things, all receive creation.

Heaven moves it; who is its master? It must rely on qi to move. When Heaven and Earth first divided, Spirit Treasure Lord governed with Dark Stillness Profound Communication qi, opening and dividing. Closed door is called Kun; opened door is called Qian. Closed, all things begin to enclose; opened, all things begin to be born. This is the Three giving birth to myriad things. Chaos divided, the blue, yellow, and white three qi first appear, as if existing or not, without form or shape — called existing but not existing, called not existing but not not existing. Who pushes and moves this? When the time comes, it moves. Who closes and opens this? When numbers reach their extreme, it opens. Heaven and Earth wait for this to stand; sun and moon wait for this to shine. Thus the nine qi arrange correctly, orderly and regulated; yin and yang, Five Phases, intertwined and ordered; people and things all born — what is greater than this?

The myriad transformations of Heaven and Earth, if not nurtured by the Three Origins and guided by the nine qi, cannot be born. The three qi are the honor of Heaven and Earth; the nine qi are the root of all things. Thus the three combine to form virtue, the ultimate of Heaven and Earth.

Qi coming into the body is called birth; qi leaving the body is called death. All who have teeth and hair, all who crawl and stir, are no different. Without the Three Origins nurturing and the nine qi guiding, none can live. Only humans are most numinous among myriad things, dwelling among the Three Powers, truly honored. Zhuangzi said: “Heaven and Earth and I are born together.” Once born, their coming is no different; after bestowing, their doings all differ. Then why is Heaven and Earth eternal but human life short? Because they do not understand the principle of the three combining to form virtue, the ultimate of Heaven and Earth. The ultimate means the center. The Spring and Autumn Annals say: “Man receives the center to establish destiny.” The Book says: “The Supreme Deity sends his heart to the people below,” which is the Daoist Yellow Court. Yellow is the color of Earth; court is the center of the four directions. Heaven one gives birth to water, in humans it is essence, stored in the kidneys. The kidneys have left, right, and middle parts. The Yellow Court Scripture says: “Left is lesser yang, right is greater yin; behind is the secret door, before is the birth gate.” The kidneys are the gate of birth and death; thus nourishing must begin with the Yellow Court. Essence is stored in the kidneys; qi is born from essence; mingling in the heart, heart fluids mingle and refine in the Yellow Court. If one knows the mingling without error, essence unites with qi, qi unites with spirit, spirit unites with dao, then the principle of life is never lost in the center of Heaven and Earth. Hence it is said: the three combine to form virtue, the ultimate of Heaven and Earth.

A person is born in the womb, nurtured by the Three Origins, formed by the nine qi; thus in the ninth month spirit is distributed, qi full and able to sound, sound still with spirit complete, the Nine Heavens celebrate. The Supreme Unity holds the tally, the Emperor Lords grade destiny, record and register, govern destiny and fix fate, the Five Emperors supervise birth, the Holy Mother guards the chamber, Heaven gods and Earth spirits, the Three Realms all guard. The Nine Heavens’ Sima stands in the court, facing east, reading the Chapter on Spirit-Birth of the Nine Heavens nine times; males then all spirits sing respectfully, females then all spirits sing in service; males then the destiny master respectfully consents, females then the destiny master respectfully obeys; thus is birth. If the Nine Heavens’ Sima does not issue the destiny chapter, and myriad spirits do not sing respectfully, birth will never occur.

(An annotation from the Great Elixir Hidden Scripture: People are born from the heavenly soul, formed from the primordial spirit, revolving the nine qi, supported by Supreme Unity, opening and dividing the Three Paths, accumulating spirit in the hidden palace. Thus the mysterious fluids coil seven times, flowing and spreading moisture, the sun and moon reflect its six voids, mouth and eyes operate its sacred instruments, clouds move and rain bestows, virtue matches Heaven and Earth, the womb forms, the five causes complete. The way of establishing a person is so weighty. The five causes are the five spirits; the three paths are the three truths; the five spirits are the souls of Heaven; the three truths are the dao of Heaven; the nine qi are the womb of Heaven; Supreme Unity is the source of Heaven; sun and moon are the eyes of Heaven; mysterious fluids are the moisture of Heaven; six voids are the light of Heaven; hidden palace is the mansion of Heaven; spirit qi is the transformation of Heaven; primordial spirit is the emperor’s transformation. Also it says: Primordial Father and Mysterious Mother; Primordial Father governs qi, the transforming principle is the emperor’s predecessor; Mysterious Mother governs essence, transforming and forming the womb. Supreme Unity mixes, five spirits hold the tally, arrange talismans for the five spirits, each having its master. Thus the Three Palaces guard truth, the hundred joints receive spirit, Emperor Lords fix the tally, fate is never overturned, a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, raising the body to greet dawn. Carefully savoring this passage, its meaning is greatly like the Chapter on Spirit-Birth. Receiving birth in the womb, nurtured by the Three Origins, formed by the nine qi, is the Mysterious Mother giving birth to essence, forming the womb, revolving the nine qi, the Three Paths’ spirit. The ninth month spirit distribution, qi full and able to sound, is the sun and moon reflecting its six voids, mouth and eyes operating its sacred instruments. The Nine Heavens celebrate, Supreme Unity holds the tally, Emperor Lords grade destiny, record and register, govern destiny and fix fate, the Five Emperors supervise birth, until birth does not occur. That is Supreme Unity mixing, five spirits holding tally, Emperor Lords fixing tally, fate never overturned, a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, raising the body to greet dawn. Supreme Unity, according to the Mysterious Mirror Scripture, is the great lord of longevity; in the teaching there is Supreme Unity Emperor Lord, Supreme Unity True Lord, Supreme Unity Original Lord, Supreme Unity Perfected Person, Supreme Unity Honored Spirit. This Supreme Unity is not an external god, but the Supreme Unity of the Supreme Clarity Great Cavern. Its form is like a newly born boy, naked, four cun tall, the spirit of the Great Cavern returning to the womb and beginning form. Named Wuyou Shou, always guarding beneath the jade pillow. When a person is newly born, holding the tally and mixing myriad spirits. The Emperor Lord is also called Seven Spirits, also called Spirit Elder, always guarding above the two eyebrows, grading destiny, fixing high and low. The destiny master is the central elder, guarding the heart and fixing the tally, thus noting the years of life. The Five Emperors are the Eastern Blue Emperor Diao Liangji, Red Emperor Chang Lai Jue, White Emperor Peng Anxing, Black Emperor Bao Chengchang, Yellow Emperor Han Guanglu, supervising birth. The Holy Mother is the Nine Heavens’ Holy Mother, for without sole yang there is no birth, without sole yin no completion; the Holy Mother is the lord of ultimate yin, delighting in birth and guarding the chamber, expelling misfortune. The Sima in the court facing east reciting the Chapter on Spirit-Birth is the Great Sima of the Longevity Method, surname Bai Cheng, name Xu Sheng, a Supreme Clarity True Person. Males respectfully consent and sing homage; females respectfully obey and sing service, thus distinguishing noble and common. As in the poem about the difference of boys and girls. All above are spirits of one body; when qi is full, myriad spirits gather. Yet spirit is mothered by qi, spirit is the child of qi; spirit can dwell in qi, qi can hold form; thus longevity and long vision, how difficult is it? Alas, people do not understand this, seeking to extinguish life and lightly live — deeply lamentable.)

When a person obtains return, born in the human dao, washing the form in the sun, startling Heaven and Earth, precious beyond measure. The true Heaven, Earth spirits, and Three Realms all attend, not lightly. When born, not considered humble. Thus one can cherish the form, preserve the spirit, honor the qi, secure the root, never dying or decaying, attaining spirit-immortalhood, flesh and bone flying together, ascending the Three Pure Ones — this is to unite the virtue of the three qi and harmonize the nine qi. But people obtain birth yet cannot honor their qi, cherish their form, preserve their life, love their spirit, bringing death and decay upon themselves, departing from their original truth.

(The Commentary on the Mixed Origin says: A person is born between Heaven and Earth, receiving the harmony of two qi, crowned above all things, dwelling in the most numinous place, gathering the essence of the Five Phases. Participating in the Three Powers, born with Heaven and Earth, can be called supremely precious beyond comparison. If one obtains human form, one must cherish and love it; for the realm of life and death is full of confusion and error. The human body is like a plank rolling on a ball; to obtain human form is like rowing upstream to board a ship. This is why the Spirit King pitifully laments beings’ lack of awareness, lightly living and seeking death, not valuing the human body and thus asking this question. Having just obtained human form, one must go to the Southern Dan Fire Refining Pool, wash with Yellow Flower water, then enter the womb to begin becoming human. Now this scripture calls it washing the form in the sun, not the Yellow Flower — why? Because the Yellow Flower is the essence of yang, in the sun’s upper pavilion, also called the Yang Cavern Palace. There is a flowing fire pool and Yellow Flower water. The divine beings there often bathe the form with this water. Thus our teaching recommends for the departed a longevity talisman pointing to this. Since many sections of the scripture say “startled Heaven and Earth,” it is not exaggeration. Every time reciting this chapter, closing the book with a sigh, for this body is born with Heaven and Earth, qi communicates with yin and yang; this body is the body of the Three Treasures, this qi is the qi of yin and yang, nothing is more honored than the Three Treasures, nothing greater than yin and yang spirit; moving its mechanism, myriad things transform accordingly. Startling Heaven and Earth, Three Realms attend, not exaggeration. Having obtained this life, how can one not rejoice? Yet people do not cherish the form, preserve the spirit, honor the qi, secure the root, unite with the virtue of the three qi and harmonize the nine qi — all because selfish hearts prevail and wisdom is little, like shooting sparrows a thousand zhang high with a bead from Suihou, common indeed; how can one not depart from one’s original truth?)

The Chapter on Spirit-Birth of the Nine Heavens is the flying mysterious qi of the Three Caverns, the three combined into sound, forming numinous script, mixing myriad spirits, hidden rhyme and inner names, spirit qi forming shape — a chapter of nature.

(Heaven and Earth are vast; without qi nothing moves. The human body stands; without qi nothing exists. The Three Caverns’ precious scriptures, without qi no formation. Called the chapter of nature, not from human speech. According to the Twelve Sections of Supreme Truth, the text of nature is primary, truly the teaching of Pre-Heaven. The Nine Heavens Elder told the Three Heavens Jade Child: “The primordial elixir in the womb’s essence record is the beginning of mystery, binding the natural qi of Great Void to form precious script; this is the Chapter on Spirit-Birth.” Flying mystery means among the three qi, the mysterious qi is the last, its qi like clouds flying and wandering in Great Void, combining three to form sound. The three combinations: The Original Scripture says: “A person’s form is one, body is two, qi is three. When form, body, spirit, and qi are complete, one is human. Also spirit is one, qi is two, essence is three, then spirit is complete. Also Heaven is one, Earth is two, human is three, then Heaven-Earth dao and virtue are complete.” Thus it says three combine to form sound. Sound means their tones harmonize; this is the present chapter. Script binds qi, spirit combines with qi, like attracts like, thus mixing myriad spirits. Also in the Purple Tenuity Upper Origin Palace is the symbol of extended life; placed in the eight directions, the qi of the eight directions responds suddenly, all becoming human; then hiding the symbol returns to qi. Mixture returns to one body; thus the Scripture of Deliverance says: “True persons mix without division; heavenly qi returns to one body.” None but natural qi.)

The Heavenly Treasure recites it to open the light of Heaven and Earth. The Numinous Treasure recites it to open the soul of the Nine Nether Long Night. The Spirit Treasure recites it to govern myriad spirits. Supreme Unity recites it to complete body and spirit. The Emperor Lords recite it to bind form. The Nine Heavens recite it to birth humans. Scholars recite it to ascend Heaven.

(The dao is not far from people, yet people, in seeking dao, are far. People should know their union of Heaven and human, originally without separation. Reasoning thus, Heavenly Treasure is Primordial Origin; Numinous Treasure is Dao Lord; Spirit Treasure is Laozi. Heavenly Treasure was born at Dragon Han’s beginning, when Heaven and Earth first divided, above no longer color, below no longer abyss, vast and empty, boundless and dark. The Heavenly Treasure Lord opens and divides with the Chapter on Spirit-Birth of the Jade, then all ranks above and below are set, as the Scripture of Deliverance says: “No script is without light.” The Numinous Treasure Lord was born at Dragon Han’s opening, head of deliverance, thus opening the soul of the Nine Nether Long Night. The Scripture of Deliverance says: “No script is without deliverance.” The Spirit Treasure Lord was born at the first year of Red Brightness; myriad models spread, the Great Void nurtures marvels, great images shine spirit; with yang essence qi he births the highest saints and true ones; with tranquil qi he births the original lord and holy mother; with fierce qi he births heavenly warriors; remaining qi nurtures myriad spirits — thus governing myriad spirits. The Scripture of Deliverance says: “Five scripts open and expand, universally spreading spirits.” To govern is to prevent false acts. In the body, the Heavenly Treasure Lord’s qi dwells in the mud pellet; spirit leaks from the eyes as light, thus opening Heaven and Earth’s light. The Numinous Treasure Lord’s qi dwells in the red palace, the spirit mansion where blood is born; blood is yin, stored in the liver, liver governs soul, thus opening the soul of the long night. The Great Cavern Scripture says: “Cut off the dead door, let the Supreme Deity’s jade splendor secure the elixir origin; open and release the seven ancestral souls, ascending the southern palace.” The Spirit Treasure Lord’s qi dwells in the lower elixir field, the Yellow Court, the mansion of spirit birth. The scripture says: “Dispersing and transforming five forms into myriad spirits, called the Yellow Court inner chapter.” Thus it says: “To govern myriad spirits.” Supreme Unity governs all spirits, namely Wuyou Shou. Emperor Lords are Fengling Fan. Above are the spirits of one body. When form is complete, the four limbs and five organs are all perfect; the ninth month spirit distributes, intending to become human. Cultivators who understand this principle know the Three Palaces are the Three Treasures, the Nine Heavens harmonize, never dying or decaying, ascending the Nine Heavens — is this dao far from people? Cease not to act thus.)

Ghost spirits hearing it ascend and migrate. Ordinary people hearing it live long. Nether souls hearing it open deliverance. Decayed things hearing it emit smoke. Infants hearing it gain speech. Dead corpses hearing it return to humans.

(From Heavenly Treasure to scholars, those who obtain our dao become emperors above and kings below. From ghost spirits to dead corpses, those who lose our dao see light above and become earth below. Yet there is difference between reciting and hearing. Reciters obtain the dao, reciting Yao’s words and acting Yao’s deeds. Now, unfortunately, many fail to obtain the dao, falling into ghost spirits, ordinary people, nether souls, far from the dao. Once hearing this scripture, ghost spirits can ascend, entering the Eastern Splendor, not subject to the Three Officials’ ghosts. According to the Scripture of the Flying Immortal Sword: Those with likeness and talent, surpassing all hopes, after death receive the Three Officials, recorded as good and bright ghosts, after four hundred years becoming underground lords; from then on, every three hundred years is a step. Now hearing this scripture, no waiting period is needed to ascend. Ordinary people have six desires complete, called ordinary people; now hearing this scripture, six desires are unstained, living long in the world. Nether souls are those imprisoned in hell; now hearing this scripture, they are delivered to the southern palace. Decayed things are plants and trees; when decayed, their substance is lost. Now causing smoke to arise — what reason? This scripture is flying mysterious qi, forming numinous script. Plants and trees arise by qi; now causing smoke to arise is the qi of wood. Wood contains fire; substance is fire. Now decayed, life principle is lost. Now responding to this scripture with qi nourishing, gradually substance arises; thus decayed things hearing it emit smoke. If applied to humans, it means loss of spirit. Essence is like decayed things; smoke is like human qi. If qi is lost, is it not decayed? Thus Su Dongpo’s poem on shadow and form says: “You are like smoke on fire; when fire ends, you part.” The scripture touches on this, revealing the marvelous power, inseparable from things. Once, at Chongyang, it was said: “One with the dao carries a ladle containing the great elixir, mixed with millet, casually giving to others. At dusk, millet is gone but elixir remains, saying: ‘Why are people’s blessings so few?’” Then leaving the great elixir on a withered palm tree by the jade pool, next day the palm regrew, decayed things emitted smoke — is this not reason? Infants can cry but not speak; now hearing this scripture, they gain speech, opening the orifices and intelligence. Dead corpses, with soul and spirit separated, far from human dao; now hearing this scripture, they return to being human. Once Xu Jia died, many years passed. Suddenly Laozi cast the Supreme Mystery birth talisman on him, reviving him. By talisman power and scripture power, two paths converge.)

The mysteries of the Three Treasures are the root of myriad things; thus unknown to ghosts and spirits, yet heard by ordinary people.

(The Three Treasures are Heavenly Treasure, Numinous Treasure, and Spirit Treasure. They give birth to Heaven and Earth, gods and ghosts, spirits and emperors; utmost stillness and unchanging, utmost purity and unmixed, covering the vast Heaven and Earth without omission, hiding in the depths of ghosts and spirits beyond description. Myriad things, endlessly arising and ceasing, cannot be exhausted — truly mysterious. Hence the scripture says: “The dao is the mystery of myriad things. The Three Treasures are the mystery of the dao.” Mystery means profound place, the source and root of all. The Supreme Mystery says: “Heaven’s mystery is northwest, where essence accumulates and transforms. Earth’s mystery is the Yellow Springs, where souls hide and dwell. Man’s mystery is thought, where utmost spirit is stored.” The Nan Hua Jing says: “Auspiciousness arises from mystery.” The ancient commentary said “not yet is mystery,” meaning Kun. Now the Supreme Mystery points to Yellow as Kun. The great Brahma qi arises from the northwest, all living things depend on it, establishing Heaven’s dao. Souls dwell in Kun, all things prosper, establishing Earth’s dao. Heaven and Earth established, yin and yang complete. The living must live; transformation must transform. Thus it says the Three Treasures are mysterious, the root of myriad things. Earlier it said ghost spirits ascend, ordinary people live long; now it says unknown to ghosts and spirits, yet heard by ordinary people. If ghosts and spirits do not know, and ordinary people have not heard, then before knowing and hearing and after, there is difference; they cannot be spoken of on the same day. Those who obtain this dao cannot be questioned. Is it the worldly common talk? The ultimate words cannot be lightly obtained; the dao of immortals is rare.)

Those who study the highest dao, aspire to immortals, and obtain corpse liberation, extinguishing and crossing the turning wheel, ultimately return to the immortal dao; form and spirit are one, never apart, both entering the true dao. Without this scripture, the womb is blocked and stagnant, death qi secures the root, true radiance is not guarded, life qi lacks moisture, the nine gates are blocked, the body does not birth spirit, merely bearing one form, like carrying qi to move. Those who learn this method can sit and attain nature.

(The highest true dao has seven paths; the supreme dao has three; the middle true dao has six; the lower true dao has eight. The Chapter on Spirit-Birth’s meaning corresponds with the Great Cavern Thirty-Nine Chapters as complementary. Examining the Great Cavern Thirty-Nine Chapters, it is the highest true dao, hence called the highest dao. Those who study the highest dao, aspiring to immortals, may lack strength to ascend with bones, only achieving corpse liberation. Also, extinguishing and crossing the turning wheel — if the turning wheel does not cease, the root of life and death remains, and the six paths cycle continues. Thus the Blue Child Lord said: “To plant the root of extinction, one must pull out the root of life and death, sink into the Nine Springs, but sit cherishing the form.” The root of life and death is the turning wheel. Entering the turning wheel risks straying from the human dao, hard to regain human form. Even human form is hard to regain, so aspiring to immortals is even more difficult. The scripture says corpse liberation frees one from the turning wheel, ultimately meeting the immortal dao. Yet if功未充, the ghost register has a name, cannot avoid the Three Officials’ pursuit, so temporarily the form is lodged in crevices and valleys, with Supreme Unity guarding the corpse, three souls nurturing bones, seven spirits protecting flesh, the fetal spirit binding qi, long enduring rebirth. Corpse liberation methods are many: taking knife and jade to expel worms, rinsing the fetal fluid then next death, drinking jade nectar then knocking on the coffin, taking Golden Elixir then ending, or head corpse separated from body but hair remains — generally a life unfinished. Thus the Immortal Gong took seven lives to ascend truth; Supreme Ultimate took one hundred bodies to realize fruition. Once corpse liberation is done, one must use the Chapter on Spirit-Birth to secure the corpse form, so life moisture does not dry and death door closes. The Chronicles Scripture says: The body’s death and decay arise from thirty-nine places where ghost qi enters, form has gaps, blood has losses, death qi advances daily, evil qi draws in, spirit and qi do not communicate, moisture stagnates, myriad spirits run wild. Hence the scripture says death qi secures the root, true radiance not guarded, life qi lacks moisture. True radiance means true spirit. Merely bearing one form, like carrying qi to move. Though having this body, not knowing the dao of spirit-birth, how is this different from a walking corpse? If one obtains this method, one can sit and attain nature. This specifically refers to the Chapter on Spirit-Birth as a shortcut, not corpse liberation, directly entering the great vehicle. Where is this method? The scripture says: “The Chapter on Spirit-Birth of the Nine Heavens is the flying mysterious qi of the Three Caverns, combining three into sound, forming numinous script, mixing myriad spirits.” The human body is all born of the three qi; once receiving this qi, one is one with Primordial Origin, then can mix myriad spirits; where qi is, spirit follows. Initially, three qi give birth to three spirits, three departments and eight scenes, thus twenty-four spirits; if constantly mixing the twenty-four spirits, transforming into three or five true persons, mixing into the Supreme Unity, becoming the Emperor Lord. Though hundreds of millions abound, they can be mixed; then yang summons yin, entering and exiting without fixed place; yang qi transforms into dragon chariot, yin qi transforms into jade maiden, dancing above the wheel of emptiness and mystery, sitting and attaining nature — can this deceive me?)

The Three Treasures are honored, the Nine Heavens supremely true. Secreted in the Great Abundance’s ninefold golden grid, purple yang jade platform. Unless Heaven and Earth open, its text does not emerge. Primordial forbidden scripture, unknown to ghosts and spirits. Those who steal it face the wind blade for ten thousand kalpas, soul dies without rebirth; those who honor it attain form and spirit as immortals.

(The sage’s heart to aid beings is ceaseless, yet above myriad Heavens, who can know it? Thus the Three Caverns’ scriptures circulate among people, all are the sage’s heart’s voice. Now reciting its scripture is to obtain its heart; through its heart to meet all sages; the scripture’s presence is the sage’s presence. Can one not revere it? The Chapter on Spirit-Birth is the ancestral qi of Heaven and Earth, parent of all beings; the Three Treasures themselves honor it, how much more humans? In Fengdu’s Six Cavern Palace is a special office punishing slander of the Three Treasures’ great vehicle; its scripture is the words of the Three Treasures. If one does not honor its words, how is it different from slander? The Nine Heavens are supremely true; supreme means highest. Secreted in the Great Abundance is the Daozang’s place. According to the Seven Transformations Dance Heaven Scripture: Supreme Clarity’s precious scriptures number three hundred volumes, Jade Secrets nine thousand chapters, talisman diagrams seven thousand chapters, and the chapter of nature, secret above the Nine Heavens in the Great Abundance Palace. The Great Abundance Palace is the Jade Pure Palace. According to the Scripture of Golden Truth and Jade Light: “Ninefold golden grid, purple yang jade platform.” Ninefold means the depth of sealing; grid means a kind of desk. According to the Dao Treasure Scripture, there are jade grids and golden grids, both belonging to the Nine Heavens. Above the Three Passes is the jade platform; on the platform is the jade grid, housing the Supreme Emperor Supreme True Jade Name. This is not only to honor but also to keep secret. Without the Dragon Han’s opening, the Spirit King braving prohibitions and earnestly requesting, how could this text be seen? Surely those who steal it suffer punishment; those who honor it become immortals. Those who steal it should take warning; those who honor it should strive.)

In the Three Origins Palace, there are names in gold, carved in purple script; those reborn should be among the Three Pure Immortals, obtaining this scripture. When the time and affinity meet, they will bring gold treasures to offer the master, sincerely follow the covenant, close their hearts and practice, carefully not leaking it, lest the wind blade examine the body.

(The Three Origins’ examinations are not only for dead souls. All who obtain the dao and those who have not, all partake. Only those with gold names and purple characters are always distinguished as those learning immortality. Thus in the Daozang is recorded the Three Origins’ examiners of hell’s grades, called the Ink Register. Those who obtain gold names and purple characters truly have distinction. Once Li Jue, a commoner of Jiangyang, had long cultivation in the immortals’ register; though not ascending Heaven, his name was already written in gold in Huayang Cave Heaven. Not only among cultivators are such grades. The world’s books say when Emperor Liang was King of Xiangdong, he recorded loyal ministers, righteous men, and those with beautiful writings, using three grades of brushes: gold for loyalty and filial piety, silver for virtue, bamboo for literary beauty. The Supreme Jade Secret Scripture says: “In the Purple Tenuity Palace there are golden grids, jade books, red gold books, blue jade slips — all of this kind.” If one’s past good deeds are complete, all this is the reward body; in the next life one will be among the Three Pure Immortals, naturally meeting this scripture, must bring gold treasures, follow the covenant to receive, then can cultivate; if not, surely the wind blade will examine. Repeating this, all is for the middle and lesser vehicles. The wind blade’s examination, as said earlier, carries ten thousand kalpas, soul death without rebirth; later it says the wind blade punishes — can one not be cautious? The Supreme Command Scripture says: “Those who transmit the heavenly scriptures and cause disaster to ancestors are guilty of serious sin, guarding against leakage of the covenant.” So the Black Register’s upper volume records the Water and Fire officials; outside are the wind blade left and right officials. The left wind examiner governs receiving scriptures, talismans, and secrets; those who receive without covenant, sell the dao for money, will damage heavenly law. The right blade examiner governs binding oaths and covenants, punishing those who betray masters and friends, deserting one to join another, judging good and evil, attacking the root — the greatest sin. Compared with the Supreme Sky Lang Scripture, which says “Meet the worthy and transmit without fixed number,” these differ greatly.)

The method of cultivation: a thousand days of long fasting, regardless of human affairs, all dust leaks exhausted, heart leveled and silent, pure incense held, entering the room facing east, knocking teeth nine times, tuning voice to correct qi, reciting and chanting the precious chapter.

(Summoning truth to refine form; when form is pure, qi unites; containing dao to refine qi; when qi is pure, spirit is joyful — this is the method of long fasting. Zhuangzi said: “The universe is calm and settled, arising from Heaven’s light. The universe is Qin and settled, the leveled heart.” The essence of spirit-birth is none other than this. Outside this, all is human affairs. When the mind of beings is not yet unified, the heart is like wandering dust, clashing and grinding with things, wind rushing and fire blazing, gradually stained with dust, never stopping. After fasting, spirit and qi return to one; spirit is in the ear, hearing in the eye, seeing in the tongue, tasting in the heart, transforming in intention, swiftly the spirit roams the six roots. Now the six roots do not admit, all dust leaks exhausted. The teaching has eight leaks: tears of eyes (liver leak), nasal mucus (lung leak), saliva (kidney leak), external sweat (heart leak), night sweat (small intestine leak), drooling in sleep (brain leak), dreams and ghost encounters (spirit leak), lust (body leak). All these leaks arise from the five skandhas, six entrances, twelve root dusts’ connections. If one makes form full of emptiness, hearing stops at the ear, heart stops at the talisman, then dust cannot enter by itself. Once, Immortal Ge fasted long on Mount Tiantai; within a year he attained spiritual communication, the Supreme One appearing in his quiet chamber. Later fasting methods originated here. The Stern True Lord said: “Empty heart to seek dao and virtue, quiet intention to expect spirit brightness.” Because beings’ hearts are not yet united with dao, fasting is first taught to quiet the heart; quieting the heart enters the dao. Later generations, inflamed by human affairs, entangled with form and instrument, view fasting as human affairs — how mistaken! Ritualists become mere corpse priests. Entering the room facing east is to take life qi; tuning voice is to correct qi; mysterious response is to gather spirit — all essential parts of reciting scripture.)

Reciting once, sound heard in the Nine Heavens. Reciting twice, Heaven and Earth set reverence. Reciting thrice, Three Realms salute the chamber. Reciting four times, Heavenly Kings descend as immortals. Reciting five times, the Five Emperors pay homage to the True. Reciting six times, Demon Kings bind the body. Reciting seven times, stars and constellations close gates. Reciting eight times, the dark night brightens. Reciting nine times, all under Heaven attend; all spirits guard the pavilion.

(The previous chapter’s cultivation method is none other than returning the body and becoming sincere. Once able to return the body, one is one with Heaven, thus knowing what Heaven does and what humans do — this is supreme knowledge. Supreme means harmonizing the Heaven-human boundary, making it seamless. Thus reciting once, sound is heard in the Nine Heavens — reciting here, heard there, indicating inspection above and below. Twice, Heaven and Earth set reverence. The Scripture of Deliverance has Heaven and Earth setting rites, meaning is similar. Reverence and ritual differ in weight; reverence with ritual shows perfection. Thrice, Three Realms salute the chamber — ritual is even more than reverence. Four times, Heavenly Kings descend as immortals. The scripture has titles of Law King and Heavenly King, all honorifics of the high saints. Descending immortals means summoning immortals to gather, as Immortal Ge summoned the Supreme Ultimate Immortal Xu to descend in the quiet chamber. Five times, the Five Emperors pay homage to the True. Like when Lady Wei became Daoist, five old Emperor Lords descended to her room, transmitting the Five Emperor staffs. Six times, Demon Kings bind the body. The Guarding Spirit Incantation mentions Demon Kings binding head and body separately; though words differ, the principle is one. Binding means tying. At six times, the demon king binds the body to prevent reckless movement, fearing interference. Cultivators face many demon trials; first minor demons, then great demons; passing these two trials, the demon king can protect and recommend ascent to immortal rank. Demon king binding body is not at five or seven times, but at six, when功 reaches that level — why? Because the six great demons of the six heavens are the six old qi, called the supreme yin ghost commanders, their power equal to Heaven’s. Primordial commands and transforms their demons born together. Thus Daoist scriptures and rituals must first control demons, then succeed. Six is old yin, its power great; thus fasting rituals command demons at noon, called this. One yin is born at noon; so first stop its growth; if done later, no salvation. Often seen on yellow altar ten tables of incense, first night lodging begins at true north, the Zi position. Cultivating the Great Elixir must use one yang’s sign to ignite fire, sequentially passing six, to northeast Gen position, precisely the ghost land, the demon’s residence. This is the floating mountain Jade Toad Master’s method of commanding demons; ignorant do not understand, only commanding local demons, not knowing the six cavern great demons are the great demons of Heaven. During Han Celestial Master times, distinguishing humans and ghosts, first driving out six heaven demons to return north to Feng. Though called Fengdu Six Caverns, it is truly the heavenly realm, not to be confined by location. Northern Capital Luo Feng, though supreme yin land, also has six cavern immortal officials, always examining cultivators, understanding the Three Realms’ registers. The Scripture of Deliverance says: “Ah people sing cavern chapters, to capture Northern Luo Feng.” Since singing cavern chapters, what relation to Fengdu? Must say capturing Northern Luo Feng means capturing Luo Feng’s demons, the chief of all demons. Below it says binding and sending away demons and spirits, cutting off six ghost blades — meaning is clear. Now after commanding demons incantation, there are three heavens’ movement bright, six heavens’ movement end — none understand these words. Since commanding demons, what is commanded? Many pretend to be clever. Recently reading the Collection of Universal Teachings, its inheritance is known. Yet Jade Toad Master taught orally, not to be written on paper, fearing leakage; I dare not speak recklessly. Seven times stars and constellations close gates. Primordial Heavenly Lord said in the Scripture of Deliverance, the Jade Balance and Jade Scale stop the wheel at one time. This scripture calls it closing gates, referring to the Dipper handle. The seventh star of the Northern Dipper is the Heavenly Gate Star, also called Breaking Army; its direction is where ghosts and spirits avoid; practitioners call it strong qi. Eight times, dark night brightens; the place of supreme yin, where sun and moon do not shine, souls sink and spirits stagnate; how to ascend and deliver? Li Ruochong recited it to recommend Zhang Lihua. Nine times, all under Heaven attend, all spirits guard the pavilion. After nine times complete,功感 arises; corpse lies and dragons appear; abyss is silent and thunder sounds — all unbidden and natural. Once Li Shunxing often recited the Great Cavern Scripture; after three years accumulation, suddenly one night, thousands of flying immortals gathered in the air, divine light illuminating the room. Doing it here corresponds to there — how could this be false?)

Once through, Heaven is penetrated; the womb’s origin is declared and communicated.

(The true dao governs the body
