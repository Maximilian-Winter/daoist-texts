#### Preface to the Scripture of the Jade Seal of the Numinous Treasure of the Cavern Profound, Naturally Born Spirits of the Nine Heavens

**Hanging Meaning**

Originally, the great teachings of the Three Caverns and One Vehicle divide into three grand parts: first, the sequence and divisions; second, the orthodox sects; third, the circulating transmissions. Now this scripture is formed from the naturally condensed qi of the Three Caverns, crystallized into numinous script, not spoken by human lips. Therefore, its title bears no prefix of "Most High," its opening contains no mention of the Dao, it establishes no sequence or divisions, nor does it specify time or place. The so-called Cavern Profound Numinous Treasure refers to the sect to which the teaching herein belongs. From the scripture’s beginning to the Supreme Clarity and Supreme Ultimate Officials, it recounts the origin and trace of the Three Treasures. Although these three titles differ by era, their essence is one—only separated from their true origin. It speaks of the Three Qi as the primal source of Heaven and Earth’s myriad transformations, and that humans share the same root and virtue. Internally it divides into five chapters: the first from these three titles to the opening light praising the original proclamation and transformation; the second from the pure, lofty, and clear qi to the joint reception and generation, distinguishing ritual patterns and establishing the Three Powers; the third from the myriad transformations of Heaven and Earth to the utmost limit of Heaven and Earth, thus encompassing traces and honoring the root; the fourth from human reception of life to the end of birthlessness, speaking of humans penetrating the Three Powers and the crucial meetings of rebirth; the fifth from “husband and wife” to the true origin, praising and urging cultivation. Next, from the chapter on the naturally born spirits of the Nine Heavens to what is heard, praising the scripture’s origin and boundless merit, divided into four chapters: the first from the Nine Heavens to the chapter on nature, praising the scripture’s naturalness, its complete essence and utility; the second from Heavenly Treasure to human birth, speaking of the merit of reciting the scripture and the mysterious responses that follow measure; the third from scholar to chosen person, speaking of the multitude’s return and the measure of self-benefit; the fourth from the Three Treasures to what is heard, returning to the root and reverting to stillness. Then from “husband and wife” to learning the Dao and ascending the morning, praising the teaching’s various functions and gradations, divided into six chapters: the first from learning the Dao to sitting to attain nature, praising encouragement and equal effort; the second from the Three Treasures to joining the immortals, speaking of secret reverence and solemn worship; the third from the Three Origins to examining the body, encouraging past virtue and cautioning against careless transmission; the fourth from cultivation to the precious chapter, abandoning affairs to enter the Dao, clarifying the heart and harmonizing with the origin; the fifth from the first recitation to the first generation of spirit, speaking of practicing the Dao according to law and gradual merit; the sixth from the nine recitations as one cycle to ascending the morning, outlining the graded sequence and culminating in the supreme fruition. This is the orthodox sect portion. Since this scripture takes nature as its root, it does not establish sequence or divisions at the start; only here does it set forth the scripture’s order and divisions. From the Primordial Heavenly Venerable to the granting of the unheard-of teachings forms one section, divided into nine chapters: the first from the Primordial Heavenly Venerable to the roaring Nine Heavens, temporarily establishing time and place, displaying appearance and ritual; the second from this time to the opening of the heart, where the Spirit King responds to the occasion and will present his own questions; the third from then to attending the morning, arranging ritual and opening inquiry, self-describing his duties; the fourth from the proper time to the gathering response, dividing good and evil, riding the time to arouse compassion, proclaiming appointment and aid for the good; the fifth from the Red Bright era onward to filling the official ranks, clarifying the selection of people in the Three Dynasties to fill immortal posts; the sixth from such examples to no omission, clarifying cause and effect and explaining gradations; the seventh from the Nine Netherworld’s courts to opening the great populous, clarifying the elevation of past virtue to fill the peaceful populace; the eighth from this time to the concern of ministers, clarifying the gathering and discerning, worrying about loss of equality; the ninth from the great period’s urgency to granting the unheard-of, opening the self-responsibility and earnestly requesting the essential teachings. Next, from this Heavenly Venerable to “be cautious not to lightly transmit,” clarifying the scripture’s occasion and ritual. The middle section divides into two chapters: the first from this Venerable to the marvelous yet difficult transcendence, clarifying the Venerable’s response and praising the Dao to be bestowed; the second from the son assuming the imperial position to “be cautious not to lightly transmit,” the Venerable’s praise and exhortation to diligence and secrecy. This is the sequence portion. From the issuing of the mandate to restoration to position forms the circulating essential teachings, fully describing ritual and measure. The middle section divides into two chapters: the first from issuing the mandate to the Spirit King, issuing the mandate and transmitting the scripture, all spirits performing ritual; the second states that once the ritual is complete, all heavens return to their seats, the scripture is conferred, ritual collected, and stillness restored. This is the circulating portion. Next, from the Heavenly Venerable’s solemn admonition to “how can one not be cautious,” praising the secret’s weight before issuing the chapter.

#### Explanation of the Five Kalpas Opening Transformation and the Meaning of the Nine Heavens

The *Scripture of the Primordial Cavern Jade Calendar* says: The mixed primordial vast abyss, the great Brahman Miro, before the heavens were divided, the nine yangs darkly combined, three causes with nine revolutions, six transformations and seven returns, the Primordial Beginning shaped form, the first transformation of the five kalpas, then the Brahman Primordial Ancestor Morning Dao Lord recorded the Heavenly Origin, cycling through five kalpas. Therefore, the Primordial Cavern is named for the ancestral qi. The Jade Calendar is named for recording the Heavenly Origin, the kalpa cycles five times, then returns to one. From the one qi dividing, three causes form nine, like dragons or dragonflies, coiling through nine paths, summing the nine yang ancestral qi’s origin. The Most High uses three nines to operate Brahman, three times five to ride the Origin, combining forty-two qi: three times nine is twenty-seven, three times five is fifteen, totaling forty-two. Beginning with the blue Heavenly Origin ancestral qi, clarifying the eastern origin of blue, corresponding to the wood king of the nine yangs’ beginning, thus the East receives nine qi to divide the heavenly realm, the kalpa named Dragon Han. Next, the nine causes repeat, yang qi opens bright, red script flows light, spreading five degrees, mysterious charts and cinnabar writings. The Most High uses three times five, three revolutions of vermilion flower, combining twenty-four qi: three times five is fifteen, three times three is nine, totaling twenty-four. Opening the southern cinnabar Heavenly Origin ancestral qi, clarifying the southern red light origin, corresponding to the three yang fire king’s beginning, thus the South receives three qi to divide the heavenly realm, the kalpa named Red Bright. Next, the nine causes accumulate again, central yellow transforms the origin, heavenly latitude cycles, Brahman Origin rides five, the Most High uses five times five three revolutions, mixed yang twelve, combining fifty-two qi: five times five is twenty-five, five times three is fifteen, plus twelve numbers, totaling fifty-two. Opening the central yellow Heavenly Origin ancestral qi, clarifying the central spirit yellow flower origin, corresponding to the five yang earth king’s beginning, thus the Center receives twelve qi to divide the heavenly realm, the kalpa named Supreme Sovereign. Next, the nine origins again cause, white light initiates yang, seven bright shining Brahman, five latitudes ride heaven, the Most High uses seven times five three revolutions, combining thirty-six qi: three times seven is twenty-one, three times five is fifteen, totaling thirty-six. Opening the white spirit Heavenly Origin ancestral qi, clarifying the western white bright light origin, corresponding to the seven yang metal king’s beginning, thus the West receives seven qi to divide the heavenly realm, the kalpa named Extended Peace. Next, the nine causes complete the cycle, mixed transformation returns to root, one qi begins bright, the Most High uses two times five times thirteen, accumulating primordial yang combining thirty qi, saying that two times five multiplied by ten, then thrice ten, totaling thirty. Opening the northern mysterious Heavenly Origin ancestral qi, clarifying the mysterious dark upper light origin, corresponding to the one yang water king’s beginning, thus the North receives five qi to divide the heavenly realm, the kalpa named Opening Sovereign. The *Turtle Mountain Mysterious Record* says: The Heavenly Venerable condensed the primordial cavern’s qi to form the Jade Calendar scripture, taking Dragon Han as the first kalpa, Red Bright as the middle kalpa, Extended Peace as the final kalpa. The *Scripture of the Numinous Seal* says: Dragon Han succeeds Extended Peace, named Red Bright. The Most High dwells at chaos’s beginning, commanding the preheavenly qi, ancestor of myriad transformations, accumulating yang to form heaven. Yang numbers are odd, heaven’s number is twenty-five, namely one, three, five, seven, nine. One dwells in the North, one and six have no fixed place, relying on the Center as the origin of diffusion. The central position faces South, so the order of qi distribution begins in the South. Next, three dwells in the South, requiring a counterpart, so the North opposes the South, next five dwells. The preheavenly distribution of qi is in reverse order. Qi has bending and stretching, so positions have reverse and forward, and reverse is thus forward. Therefore, from North to West, next seven dwells, from West to East, next nine dwells. The East obtains the number nine, ending and beginning here; this nine is the origin of all things and the basis for post-heavenly use. Numbers exhaust at nine, changing at thirty-six. Three, five, seven, nine make twenty-four, arrayed in the four directions, the Center has no fixed place of one and six, empty in the middle operating twelve qi to complete the number thirty-six. Preheavenly qi distribution begins from the Center. Post-heavenly qi operation places five in the Center. One begins and ends, thus doubling one to two; one stretches and one bends, thus doubling five to ten, combining to twelve. Numbers change to thirty-six: twenty-four arrayed outside, taking one around three times two, then the Center’s twelve numbers remain. Thirty-six is the transformation of nine, hence dividing five kalpas, all heavenly realms speak of nine. Observing the method of five sons returning to geng, gengzi occupies one and contains the full twelve earthly branches of qi, also one meaning. The five sons’ origins are the West’s jiazi metal seven number meeting geng, North’s bingzi water five number meeting geng, South’s wuzi fire three number meeting geng, East’s renzi wood nine number meeting geng, Center’s gengzi earth unmoving one, the return of the four sons, thus governing the twelve earthly branches’ qi. The necessity of meeting geng is the transformation of qi numbers. Then what of the numbers combined from the five directions? It is said: their numbers also arise from the Center, the void in the middle governs the four directions’ numbers, so three, five, seven, nine dwell in the four directions as the root of twenty-four qi, and no fixed place for one and six, divided among the four directions, each obtains seven, becoming the origin of the Twenty-Eight Constellations. One and six originally summon the North, one is the origin of Heaven, six the origin of Earth, five is the number of the Center, thus no fixed position. The four directions each have their own, so one and five mutually appear in the Center and North, combining their number to six. One is the beginning of life’s number, six the beginning of completion, so the Primordial Beginning dwells there as the origin of generation. Combining twenty-four and twenty-eight is the Center’s combined fifty-two. Preheavenly numbers distribute in reverse, so South precedes North, West precedes East, just as the order of three, five, seven, nine. Post-heavenly qi flows forward, so wood then fire then earth then metal then water, the five kalpas operate thus. The Most High stores one in the Center as the root of origin, one stored then six used. Thus summing the six of the four directions and placing them on the South face as twenty-four. Adding six more to the North makes thirty. Next West’s thirty-six, East’s forty-two, both add six. Six used and stored again, then forty-two and thirty-six, thirty-six and thirty, thirty and twenty-four, twenty-four is the four directions’ three, five, seven, nine. Dividing and combining, combining and dividing, is the utmost wonder of creation. The so-called responders are in their directions, responding to their numbers. This is the Most High storing the One of Heaven and dividing the heavenly realm, again using its six as the root of myriad transformations and generation.

#### Commentary on the Scripture of the Jade Seal of the Numinous Treasure of the Cavern Profound, Naturally Born Spirits of the Nine Heavens, Volume One

By Dong Sijing, Daoist of Qingyuan Tianqing Temple, Guishan

**Explanation of the Scripture Title**

This scripture is formed from the flying mysterious qi of the Three Caverns, naturally condensed into numinous script, transcending sight and hearing, emerging beyond the surface of names and words, revered by myriad spirits, honored by myriad sages. Secreted in the Purple Yang Jade Terrace of the Mysterious Capital, because the Flying Heavenly Spirit King pitied the nine hundred and sixty calamities of the lower world, he personally attended the Heavenly Venerable, earnestly requesting proclamation. Thus, the High Perfected descended and conferred it, the dusty world received and circulated it. The so-called Cavern Profound Numinous Treasure is the name of one sect among the Three Caverns. The Naturally Born Spirits of the Nine Heavens chapter is a single item within that sect. The Three Caverns are the Cavern of Truth, Cavern Profound, and Cavern Spirit. Cavern means emptiness and unobstructedness; Profound means mysterious and unfathomable. This Dao’s fundamental essence encompasses the Three Powers, blending all things inseparably. Numinous Treasure signifies the boundless divine transformation, esteemed by all sages. In humans, it means penetrating without obstruction (Cavern), responding without hindrance (Profound), spiritual wisdom and transformation (Numinous), qi condensed and wondrous (Treasure). Naturally Born Spirits of the Nine Heavens means nature clarifies its essence, nine heavens reveal their traces, spirits born show their function. Its essence is mixed and complete, arising without dependence, hence called natural. Nine is the yang number, beginning at one and ending at nine. Heaven is the trace in which principle resides. Born spirits are from Heaven commanding humans to generate spirits. Spirits have no fixed form; they must receive the qi of the Nine Heavens to find their dwelling and infinite wondrous function. Chapter means the text shines brilliantly and forms chapters. Scripture means the name carrying the Dao, an eternal classic.

The Heavenly Treasure Lord is the honored god of the Great Cavern; the Heavenly Treasure Elder is the ancestral qi of the Heavenly Treasure Lord.

This speaks of the root of teaching and trace. The Cavern of Truth’s teaching master is Heavenly Treasure as trace, ancestral qi as root. The ancestral qi is the qi of the Mixed Cavern Supreme Void Most High Jade Emperor. Heavenly Treasure Lord is the ancestor of myriad Dao, thus the honored god of the Great Cavern. Heaven means mystery, taking nature, thus named Heaven. Treasure is the supreme precious title. Lord is the supreme title, meaning honored by all beings. Not called Cavern of Truth honored god but Great Cavern, because before the Three Caverns divided, it was collectively the Great Cavern. Like the two forces not yet separated, called chaos. Honored god means its master, high and unsurpassed, revered daily. The qi mother is mixed and formed, unfathomable as spirit, this is the rational qi. Also called Elder, meaning the qi’s master and most honored and first. The Elder is the qi of the Mixed Cavern Supreme Void Most High Jade Emperor, ninety-nine trillion nine hundred ninety billion qi. Later, in the Dragon Han first year, Heavenly Treasure Lord was transformed and born, the time of writing called Supreme High Great Abundance Jade Clarity Palace.

Mixed Cavern Supreme Void means mixed as undivided, cavern as emptiness and communication, supreme as extreme vastness, void as true emptiness. This clarifies the Dao’s fundamental essence, mingled and penetrating, born before Heaven and Earth, yet without form to grasp, thus called Mixed Cavern Supreme Void. Yet to say only Mixed Cavern and not Supreme Void would reduce the mixed cavern almost to one thing, insufficient as the root of Heaven and Earth’s myriad things. To say only Supreme Void and not Mixed Cavern would reduce Supreme Void to emptiness and silence, insufficient as the pivot of yin-yang myriad transformations. Called Primordial to unify and have a root, thus the root of generation. High Jade Emperor’s qi is the Three Treasures’ origin, all named on the surface, thus commonly called Supreme; yet tracing root, Jade Clarity is highest, thus added High. Emperor means radiance, King means containing virtue. This wondrous root, though spiritual and empty, has radiance and containing virtue; it is the qi’s ancestor, supreme and precious, the place where principle resides. Ninety-nine trillion nine hundred ninety billion qi is before chaos, no years to record, thus only qi counted, accumulating to this, then the Dragon Han kalpa opens. Nine is the yang number. The scripture says: accumulating yang forms heaven. Dragon Han first year transformed Heavenly Treasure Lord. Dragon Han is the first kalpa name, belonging to the eastern heavenly realm. The first year is the initial time name, not the present era’s year count. Transformation means having but no form, no form but essence, not born from form, thus called transformation. As the *Scripture of the Cavern Spirit* says: wondrous image without form, responding with body, true essence wondrous qi, transforming into appearance. The latter two statements are the same. This is the image without image, the form without form, only the Dao as body, not belonging to emptiness or existence. The time of writing is the Dragon Han kalpa’s beginning, issuing the Cavern of Truth’s twelve-part scripture. At that time, no figures appeared, how could books be issued? Yet this scripture’s text is the qi’s condensation. Once qi exists, the book exists; the reason for qi is the scripture’s principle. The Supreme High Great Abundance Jade Clarity official is the Heavenly Treasure Lord’s domain.

The Numinous Treasure Lord is the honored god of Cavern Profound; the Numinous Treasure Elder is the ancestral qi of the Numinous Treasure Lord.

This Numinous Treasure Lord is the Cavern Profound teaching master, all meanings seen before. The Elder is the red mixed Supreme Void Most High Mysterious Jade Void qi, ninety-nine million nine hundred ninety-nine thousand qi. Red is the color of the South. This speaks of the color’s bright radiance, also revealing the red scripture’s image. Yet though four colors exist but not divided, thus called red mixed. Since called red mixed, it can be named in existence. Also called Supreme Void, it can be named in non-existence. Now combined, expressing true emptiness and wondrous existence, mixed inseparably, thus the root of myriad transformations. The *Scripture of Deliverance* says: mixed cavern red script, unsurpassed true. This is the same meaning. The high jade meaning seen before. Void means essence empty and hollow, fully possessing the high jade virtue. Though principle exists, it is not a real form or vessel, always called empty communication.

Later, in Dragon Han opening chart, transformed and born Numinous Treasure Lord. Scripture one kalpa to Red Bright first year issued the *Scripture of Deliverance*, time called Supreme Clarity Mysterious Capital Jade Capital Seven Treasures Purple Tenuity Palace.

Previously, Dragon Han first year transformed Heavenly Treasure Lord, now Dragon Han opening chart transformed Numinous Treasure Lord. The first year is the initial kalpa, called opening chart as transformation origin manifesting, the text’s color revealed, and Numinous Treasure Lord born then. Red Bright is the second kalpa name, belonging to the southern heavenly realm. Scripture one kalpa is the Dragon Han kalpa. This Numinous Treasure Lord was born in Dragon Han and issued scripture at Red Bright’s start. Adding Deliverance means Numinous Treasure Lord is truly the ancestor of teaching deliverance. Mysterious Capital Jade Capital Seven Treasures Purple Tenuity official is Numinous Treasure Lord’s domain and scripture repository.

The Spirit Treasure Lord is the honored god of Cavern Spirit; the Spirit Treasure Elder is the ancestral qi of the Spirit Treasure Lord. The Elder is the dark silent mysterious penetrating Supreme Jade Void qi, ninety-nine million nine hundred ninety thousand black qi. Later, in Red Bright first year transformed Spirit Treasure Lord, scripture two kalpas to Supreme Sovereign first year issued scripture, time called Three Sovereigns Cavern Spirit Supreme Clarity Supreme Ultimate Palace.

Spirit means transformation unfathomable, transcendent and unburdened. The Treasure Lord’s explanation is as before. Cavern Spirit teaching master is Spirit Treasure as trace, dark silent mysterious penetrating Supreme Jade Void qi as root. Dark means secret, silent means calm and peaceful, mysterious means unobstructed, penetrating means unblocked. This clarifies the wondrous root though dark and desolate, utterly silent and peaceful, yet always unobstructed and unblocked, utterly free and unimpeded. Other meanings as before. Commonly called Primordial because all are the root of myriad virtues and the origin of myriad transformations. Yet these three, the previous two origins both called Supreme Void, the latter two qi both called Jade Void, the middle origin and qi both combine these two, is this not the reason to stir one lineage’s flow without interruption? In Red Bright first year transformed Spirit Treasure Lord, scripture two kalpas to Supreme Sovereign first year issued scripture, time called Three Sovereigns Cavern Spirit Supreme Clarity Supreme Ultimate official. The scripture’s Dragon Han and Red Bright are two kalpas; Supreme Sovereign is the central kalpa name. When Cavern Spirit teaching master descends, the Three Sovereigns Cavern Spirit Supreme Clarity Supreme Ultimate official is its capital title. Carefully observing the qi accumulated by the Three Origins, their numbers differ. From Upper Origin to Middle Origin, the number reduced is already quite different, and the lower is even less than the former, showing the kalpa’s operation hastens, like a person’s body growing small then strong, strong then old.

Though these three titles differ in year and name, their essence is one. Divided into Mysterious Primordial Three Qi, governing the Three Treasures, all Three Qi’s honored gods, named as born Three Qi, the three titles combined produce nine qi.

From non-being to being, being is forcibly named. From one to three, three never separate from one. Though the Three Origins’ titles differ, their essence is one, all returning to the same. Called different years are Dragon Han, Red Bright, Supreme Sovereign divisions; called different titles are Jade Clarity, Supreme Clarity, Supreme Clarity distinctions. Yet truly from the Primordial Beginning’s ancestral qi, and summing to Cavern of Truth’s supreme path. Thus it says essence is one. When welcoming it, one sees no head; following it, one sees no tail; is this not the utmost wondrous essence? When named by year and qi, is this not the trace that can be named? Yet trace never leaves essence, essence never differs in description. Divided into Mysterious Primordial Three Qi governing. Or according to the *Seven Divinations Chaos Chapter* says: one qi divides into Mysterious Primordial Three Qi, governing the Three Treasures, thus governing the Three Treasures is not yet firmly stated. Above says these three titles, below says essence is one, encompassing three as one. Also says dividing into three qi is one becoming three. The *Scripture of the Three Heavens’ True Dharma* says: beginning qi is blue, blue qi essence clear called Pure Subtle Heaven; primordial qi white, white qi essence clear called Yu Yu Heaven; mysterious qi yellow, yellow qi essence clear called Great Red Heaven. The three qi all born in emptiness and cavern, from one dividing into three, governing the Three Heavens’ governance, then guiding and operating the world. The Three Treasures are Heavenly Treasure, Numinous Treasure, Spirit Treasure. They are the masters within qi, thus called honored gods. The Three Qi are Mysterious Primordial. Named as born Three Qi, each title also produces three qi, so three titles combined produce nine qi. The *Scripture of the True Dharma* says: Three Heavens established, beginning qi born mixed, mixed qi blue, blue qi essence clear, born Yu Dan Infinite Heaven; mixed qi born cavern, cavern qi red, born Infinite Longevity Heaven; cavern qi born bright, bright qi blue, born Brahman Monitor Xu Yan Heaven; primordial qi born vast, or written as luminous, vast qi green, born Tou Shu Heaven; vast qi born scene, scene qi yellow, born Unarrogant Joy Heaven; scene qi born escape, escape qi white, born Transformation Response Sound Heaven; mysterious qi born fusion, fusion qi, born Brahman Assistant Heaven; fusion qi born flame, flame qi blue-green, born Clear Bright Heaven; flame qi born performance, performance qi black, born No Thought Heaven. Nine qi all born within the upper three qi, each qi separated by nine hundred million kalpas. In humans, the Three Qi and Three Treasures are original spirit, original qi, original essence, residing in the three dantian, dividing and guarding nine palaces.

The nine qi arise before the supreme void of space, hidden within the empty cavern. No light, no image, no form, no name, no color, no thread, no sound, no voice.

The *Scripture of Demon Dispelling, Guarding the One* says: One is the beginning of non-being, called Jade Clarity; two is the Primordial Cavern, called Supreme Clarity; three is Mysterious Void, called Supreme Clarity. This arises before the supreme void of space, originating from the beginning non-being before qi appears, called original spirit. Hidden within the empty cavern, it combines Primordial Cavern and Mysterious Void, called original qi and original essence. At that time, seeing it but not seeing, hearing it but not hearing. Hence no light, no image, no form, no name, no color, no thread, no sound, no voice. Observing its beginning, it is vast and without trace, initially no sound or scent to seek. Yet the principle of yin-yang motion and stillness is all contained within. This is why it is the root of guiding, operating, and governing the world.

Guiding and governing, opening and penetrating, three colors mixed in chaos, suddenly existing and vanishing, moving to the utmost number, three qi opening light. Previous chapter praises the root proclamation and transformation.

Guiding means enlightening; governing means controlling. If there is a cause making it so, this is the mysterious pivot of operation, the record of creation, by which the two forces open and the three qi transform and communicate. The three colors are blue, white, and yellow. The three qi are beginning, primordial, mysterious. When the three colors merge into one, mingled and chaotic, about to divide but not yet, suddenly existing and vanishing, separating and uniting, fleeting presence and absence, after long stagnation, operation advances, numbers follow, when numbers are full, qi opens light. The light and clear qi belongs to yang, thus floats above and is lofty and clear, accumulating to form heaven. The heavy and turbid qi belongs to yin, thus stagnates below and condenses sediment, accumulating to form earth. From the three qi opening light to forming heaven and earth, all is in order.

The nine qi array in order: sun, moon, stars, constellations, yin-yang, Five Phases, peoples and things, all receive generation. Previous chapter distinguishes ritual and image, establishing the Three Powers.

This says the nine qi are the root of all things, as the scripture states. The *Scripture of the True Dharma* says: three times three generate up to nine origins. Arrayed means orderly and arranged. Upright means firm and not crooked. In the midst of chaos, brilliant ethics, no mutual borrowing or invasion, this is the root of unity and the origin of gathering. The sun is the sun’s essence; the moon is the moon’s essence. Stars, according to the *Star Scripture Preface*, are born from earth and their essence issues from heaven. Constellations are arrays of stars. Yin and yang are the movement and stillness, bending and stretching of original qi, dividing yin and yang. The Five Phases are the substance in earth and qi moving in heaven. Regarding substance, their generation order is water, fire, wood, metal, earth. Regarding qi, their movement order is wood, fire, earth, metal, water. Even the multitude of people and things are all generated by the nine qi arrayed in order.

Heaven and Earth’s myriad transformations are nurtured by the Three Origins, guided by the nine qi; none can be born without these. The Three Qi are the honored of Heaven and Earth; the nine qi are the root of myriad things; thus the three combine virtue, the utmost of Heaven and Earth. Previous chapter says encompassing traces and honoring root.

Nurturing means compassionate care; guiding means propelling and operating. Spirits, ghosts, gods, and emperors born of heaven and earth cannot be nurtured without the Three Origins. The forms and shapes of things, their proper nature and life, cannot be guided without the nine qi. This is why they record and govern creation, flowing through past and present, being the honored of Heaven and Earth, root of myriad things. The three combine virtue, the utmost of Heaven and Earth means three and nine, nine and three, returning to one. The *Scripture of the True Dharma* says returning from nine to one is entering the true Dao. Observing the root of creation and nurturing, one knows the true virtue of the Three Origins is wholly one essence, vast and boundless, standing supreme before Heaven and Earth, the standard of myriad transformations. Thus it bestows all things without lack or excess, called descending to the heart.

Humans receive life in the womb, nurtured by the Three Origins, qi condenses to form shape; thus the nine-month spirits arrange, qi full and able to sound. The spirit still has the door; the Nine Heavens proclaim celebration. Taiyi holds the talisman; the Emperor orders and names. The master records and registers; the controller determines fate. The Five Emperors oversee birth; the Holy Mother guards the chamber. Heavenly gods and earthly spirits guard the Three Realms. The Nine Heavens’ Sima is in the courtyard, facing east reading the Nine Heavens’ Naturally Born Spirit Treasure Chapter nine recitations. Males have myriad spirits chanting reverently; females have myriad spirits chanting respectfully. Males have the controller of fate respectfully promising; females have the controller of fate respectfully obeying. Thus life begins. Without the Nine Heavens’ Sima issuing the chapter, myriad spirits not chanting reverently, life will never arise. Previous chapter says humans penetrate the Three Powers, crucial meetings of rebirth.

The Three Qi are Heaven and Earth’s honored; the nine qi are the root of myriad things. Humans born in the womb combine the essence of Heaven and Earth’s myriad things, thus most numinous and uniquely precious, the heart of Heaven and Earth. The Three Origins nurture, meaning giving birth to Heaven and Earth, being their master; humans receive this as nature, holding the inherent good. The nine qi condense shape, operating between heaven and earth, bestowing myriad things, being the root of myriad things; humans receive its correctness as essence, the source of formed shape. Nine months suffice, the Nine Heavens’ qi all descend, spirits dwell in this qi, mixed inseparably; thus qi full and spirits also spread throughout the body. Sound is the spirit qi’s excitation. Still means taking fully and completely. It means sound takes the spirit fully. The Nine Heavens proclaim celebration because Heaven regards living beings as heart, so the Nine Heavens’ emperors praise and rejoice that qi is uninterrupted, allowing full human development. Taiyi holding the talisman, the *Tai Dan Secret Scripture* says: Taiyi, the noble son, Baiyuan, controller of fate, Taokang five gods enter the purple chamber, each serving the blue jade table, above are five talismans, successively presented to the emperor. This means Taiyi holding the talisman is the five gods with Taiyi as chief. The *Great Cavern Jade Scripture* says: Taiyi spirit master holds the omen talisman register. Taiyi is the spirit reversing the fetus’s initial shape, named Riwuyu, collecting; human’s first birth holds the talisman mixing myriad gods. Once born, it guards the human jade pillow below the mud pellet’s back door. The Emperor orders and names, master records and registers means the emperor sometimes called the red character Lingfan, also called Seven Spirits, also Spirit Elder, determining rank and fate. Once born, it guards between the eyebrows the purple door’s outer palace. The master recorder is the controller of records. Registering means registering the fate register. The controller of fate determining calculation is the central controller of fate elder, named Liming, initially determining the calculation. After shape is born, it guards the human red palace heart chamber’s blood pore door. The Five Emperors oversee birth are the five directions’ emperors. Blue Emperor carving beams border, Red Emperor long coming awakening, White Emperor Peng or Zhang named peace, Black Emperor preserving success and flourishing, Yellow Emperor Lin Xufu or called Han Guanglu. They jointly oversee birth. The Holy Mother guards the chamber, the Nine Heavens’ Holy Mother in charge of generation, thus guarding the chamber. Heavenly gods and earthly spirits guard the Three Realms. In heaven called gods for their yin-yang unfathomable nature; on earth called spirits for their waning showing to humans. The Three Realms are upper, middle, lower; heaven, earth, water realms’ gods. All guard and protect, none neglect. The Nine Heavens’ Sima is the chief immortal Sima Changsheng master, Bai Chengxu born. The courtyard is the central position. East is the direction of life qi. Nine recitations complete the chapter count. Males chant reverently and respectfully, meaning honor and praise. Females chant respectfully and obediently, meaning delight and compliance. This divides respect and humility, noble and lowly. The fate chapter is the nine chapters. Without issuing the fate chapter, life will never arise. This is because reversal and order, auspicious and inauspicious, life and death are one mechanism; reversing it cannot produce life. ○ Above spirit names from *Three Heavens Lords’ List*.

Humans obtain rebirth in the human path, cleansing form in the sun, startling heaven and shaking earth, precious beyond measure. Heavenly truth and earthly spirits, the Three Realms all attend, also not lightly. When born, also not humble.

Rebirth means the mixed heavenly principle humans inherently possess; obtaining it means life; losing it means death. Thus born in the human path, heavenly principle returns. Cleansing form in the sun means departing extreme yin and bathing in extreme yang. Shu’s annotation says: when just obtaining human body, one must go to the southern cinnabar fire refining pool, wash with yellow flower water, then enter the womb and house, thus becoming human. Not called yellow flower but sun. Yellow flower is yang essence, in the sun’s upper pavilion, also called Cavern Yang Palace. Inside is a flowing fire pool, with yellow flower true water; heavenly beings often use this water to wash form and countenance. Both exist here. ○ The human spirit combines virtue with the Three Treasures, qi with the Nine Heavens shares root, head and feet resemble Heaven and Earth, seven orifices correspond to the Three Lights, Three Powers intercommunicate, their mechanism is one. Thus startling heaven and shaking earth, precious beyond measure, the Three Realms all attend, also not lightly. When born, also not humble. Therefore, being human, can one not esteem oneself?

Thus able to love form, protect spirit, honor qi, solidify root, never dying or decaying, attaining spirit immortality, flesh and bone flying together, ascending the Three Clarities, this is combining virtue with the Three Qi, aligning with the Nine Qi. But humans obtain life yet cannot honor their qi, esteem their form, treasure their fate, love their spirit, thus self-inflicted death and decay, departing their true origin. The previous chapter praises and urges cultivation.

Moreover, human form resembles heaven and models earth, responds to the Three Powers and contains the Five Phases, the place where blood and qi operate, the place where wisdom rests, how can one not love it? Yet form is not mere form; there must be something making form exist. Therefore, one must also protect spirit. The *Nanhua Jing* says: pure and unmixed, still and unchanging, bland and effortless, moving with Heaven’s course, this is the way to nourish spirit. Honoring qi means sparing it and not rashly using it. Solidifying root means guarding it and not departing from its origin. Thus it says guarding the center and embracing the one, perfectly matching Heaven. This is the meaning of never dying or decaying. If so, beginning with loving form and ending with practicing form, beginning with protecting spirit and ending with exhausting spirit, then riding cloud qi to roam Supreme Clarity, this is combining virtue with the Three Qi, aligning with the Nine Qi. If reversed, how many will not perish and depart their true origin? It is self-inflicted. ○ From the three titles to here, divided into five chapters.

The Naturally Born Spirit Chapter of the Nine Heavens is the flying mysterious qi of the Three Caverns, three combined into sound, condensed into numinous script, mixed with myriad gods, hidden rhymes and inner names, generating qi and forming shape, the chapter of nature. Previous chapter praises natural essence, complete and useful.

This clarifies that the Spirit Chapter’s text combines the flying mysterious qi of the Three Caverns, condensed into sound, thus called three combined into sound, condensed into numinous script, mixing myriad gods, hidden rhymes are the heavens’ hidden rhymes, inner names are myriad gods’ inner names, having the function of generating qi and forming shape. The Heavenly Treasure recites it to open Heaven and Earth’s light. The Numinous Treasure recites to open the Nine Netherworld’s long night soul. The Spirit Treasure recites to control myriad spirits. Taiyi recites to complete body and spirit. The Emperor recites to form shape. The Nine Heavens recite to generate humans. Previous chapter says reciting the chapter’s merit, mysterious responses following measure. Scholars recite to ascend heaven.

Heavenly Treasure Lord manifested at Dragon Han’s beginning. At that time, above no color, below no abyss, vast abyss great Brahman, vast and boundless without light. Heavenly Treasure opens and unfolds the natural chapter, arranging ranks above and below, Heaven and Earth opening light. Numinous Treasure Lord manifested at Dragon Han opening chart, ancestor of deliverance, thus opening the Nine Netherworld’s long night soul. Spirit Treasure Lord manifested at Red Bright first year, truly master of myriad spirits, thus said to control myriad spirits, control meaning total command. Taiyi is the chief of myriad gods, thus reciting it completes body and spirit. The Emperor is Feng Lingfan. Forming shape means forming qi into shape. Nine Heavens means the emperors of the Nine Heavens. Above all speaks of reciting the chapter’s merit, the altruistic practice. Reciting and hearing correspond: reciting bestows blessing, hearing receives blessing. Scholars dwell between the two, thus self-benefiting, then benefiting others. Though differing in use, merit is one Dao.

Ghosts and spirits hear it, ascending and transferring. Ordinary people hear it, extending life. Wandering souls hear it, opening deliverance. Withered decay hear it, emitting smoke. Infants hear it, gaining speech. Dead corpses hear it, returning to humans. Previous chapter says all ranks return to root, responding measure self-benefit.

Emitting smoke is like warm vapor rising to generate life. Smoke is the qi of fusion and harmony. The *Great Cavern Scripture* says: seven mysteries arise again, vapor born from scene.

The three treasures’ divine mysteries are the root of myriad things. Thus unknown to ghosts and spirits, heard by ordinary people. Previous chapter says returning to root and reverting to stillness.

Spirit means wondrous myriad transformations unfathomable. Mystery means hidden utmost principle difficult to know. The reason for being the root of myriad things is most profound and wondrous, unknown to ghosts and spirits, heard by ordinary people. Then why above say ghosts and spirits hear it to ascend, ordinary people hear it to extend life, yet here say unknown to ghosts, spirits, or ordinary people? Because above speaks of nine chapters’ mysterious function, the Dao’s use most manifest; here speaks of the three treasures’ divine mystery, the Dao’s essence most subtle. Root is like grass and tree roots, unseen by people, yet truly the source of growth. Yet above says ghosts and spirits hear it to ascend, ordinary people hear it to extend life, here says unknown to ghosts and spirits and ordinary people. This is because above speaks of nine chapters’ profound function, here speaks of the three treasures’ essence. ○ From the Naturally Born Spirit Chapter to here, divided into four chapters.

To learn the supreme Dao, yearn for immortals, and obtain corpse liberation, extinguish and transcend the wheel, ultimately returning to the immortal Dao, form and spirit united, not separated, both entering the true Dao.

The *Eight Elements True Scripture* says: the Most High Dao is three, the Upper True Dao seven, Middle True Dao six, Lower True Dao eight. The nine chapters are the Great Cavern’s gate; the Cavern Scripture is the fifth item in the Upper True Dao, thus called supreme path. Corpse liberation means the five types of liberation. Extinguishing and transcending the wheel means, as the *Scripture of Deliverance* says, the novice’s Dao shallow, immortal rank not full, operation extinguishes and transcends. Also says the wheel does not extinguish, then one obtains immortals. Learning and yearning are for those seeking but not yet arrived; thus some obtain corpse liberation, extinguishing and transcending the wheel, yet if they have this aspiration and continue learning, they will ultimately return to the immortal Dao, thus form and spirit united, not separated, both entering the true Dao. All learning’s merit must reach true Dao, then it is the utmost place. But to reach true Dao, this scripture is indispensable.

Without this scripture, the womb knots stagnate, death qi roots firm, true scene not guarded, life qi without law, nine doors blocked, body not generating spirit, merely receiving one form, like carrying qi and walking. Learning this method, one can sit to attain nature. Previous chapter praises encouragement and equal effort.

Humans born in the womb all receive the Nine Heavens’ qi, condensing to become human. After birth, the womb has twelve nodes, coiling and solidifying the five viscera. Five viscera stagnate and block, knots cannot be undone, nodes cannot be extinguished. Thus human illness arises from stagnation of knots, human death arises from solid knots. The *Qingling Yang’an Yuanjun Dao Scripture* says: five viscera hundred knots, born of myriad diseases, mysterious one Linxu opens gates and unties knots, knots sever disease disperses, spirit essence overflows, immortal Dao daily advances, death Dao daily ceases. Every chapter in the Great Cavern has this meaning. If the fetal root is unbroken, it is hard to escape reincarnation; if knots are not untied, life qi cannot arise. This is the crucial secret of generating spirit, the first task of cultivating truth. Merely receiving one form, like carrying qi and walking, means though having this body, not knowing the way of generating spirit, how is this different from a walking corpse? If knowing this scripture and sitting to advance this Dao, then mixing myriad gods, transforming into the emperor one, entering non-being from being, dancing the void mystery, sitting to attain nature, truly not false.

The Three Treasures are honored, the Nine Heavens most true, secret in Great Abundance, ninefold golden seals on the Purple Yang Jade Terrace. Only when Heaven and Earth open can its text emerge. Primordial forbidden scripture, unknown to ghosts and spirits. Those who steal it face wind blades for ten thousand kalpas, soul death no rebirth. Those who follow the rules and reverence it, form and spirit both become immortal. Previous chapter praises secrecy, reverence, and worship.

The Scripture of Generating Spirit is the Three Treasures’ honored text, the Nine Heavens’ most true teaching, secreted in the Great Abundance palace. The *Five Elders Jade Inspection* says: Great Abundance is the Purple Palace of the Nine Heavens, deeply sealed ninefold. Seal means case or register, terrace means the place of scripture storage. Without Dragon Han opening chart, the Spirit King risking forbidden request, how could this text be seen? Surely those who steal it are guilty, those who reverence it become immortals. According to the *Great Cavern Female One Scripture* recording the Most High’s ritual orders: transmitting the heavenly scripture and bringing disaster to ancestors is a grave crime, preventing leakage is the oath. Also according to the *Black Record Upper Volume* recording Water Fire officials, there are Wind Blade left and right officials. Left Wind Examiner governs receiving scriptures, talismans, and secrets; without oath practicing, greedily selling, damaging heavenly laws is a crime. Right Blade Examiner governs subduing oaths and pledges, betraying masters and friends, judging good and evil, attacking roots, the greatest crime. Thus, observing this, thieves must be warned, reverers encouraged.

In the Three Origins’ palaces, there are ancient gold names, purple characters inscribed scriptures; those born in future should become Three Clarities immortals, then receive this text. Having the cause and meeting, one should bring gold treasures, serve the master with heart, follow ritual and oath, close heart and reverently practice, carefully not lightly leak, wind blade examines body. Previous chapter urges cultivating past virtue and cautioning light transmission.

The Three Origins officials are the Three Clarities officials. The *Five Elders Jade Inspection* says: formerly this scripture was hidden and unknown. Only the Great Mystery had golden pavilion jade names, precious tablets, purple slips; the Three Origins had combined morning hidden records; the Dan Terrace had yellow character texts. These are for those destined to be true persons in the future to receive. When the cause and meeting arise, one should bring gold treasures, serve the master with heart, follow ritual and oath. After receiving, closing heart and reverently practicing means silently acting. Wind blade meaning seen before.

The method of cultivation is one thousand days of long fasting, unrelated to worldly affairs, all dust leaks exhausted, calm heart silent thought, holding pure incense and observing precepts, entering the room facing east, knocking teeth nine times through, tuning voice and correct qi, reciting the precious chapter. Previous chapter says abandoning affairs to enter Dao, clarifying heart and harmonizing with origin.

According to the *Scripture of the Void Sovereign Forty-Nine Chapters*, fasting and precepts are the Dao’s root and the law’s bridge. If one wishes to learn Dao, pure fasting and observing precepts, every thought true and correct, evil and false vanish. Pure fasting means heart fasting. The *Nanhua True Scripture* says: if one is single-minded, not listening with ears but with heart, not listening with heart but with qi, listening stops at ears, heart stops at talisman. Qi is emptiness awaiting things. Only Dao gathers emptiness; emptiness is heart fasting. Thus Yan Junping says: empty heart to originate Dao virtue, still qi to expect divine brightness. Lu Xiujing’s *Collected Quiet Fasting* also says: the human body is not sage true, yet dwells in five turbidities, three corpses strong, inner born attackers, nine orifices and four gates each have their own path; acting is entering death’s place. Thus setting ritual teaching and ritual texts to align exterior, emphasizing thought concentration methods to correct heart. Also using fetal origin refining qi methods, controlling food tastes, praying for true morning thanks, cleansing faults and excess, then advancing to learning. Those who do not learn reach darkness and silence, dwell in the place of loss and further loss, accord with non-action, so evil and deceitful keys do not open, calm and pure harmony can be attained. For human karma is deep and heavy, hard to suddenly unite with Dao, so fasting screens conditions, resting heart to accord with Dao, thus requiring one thousand days of long fasting unrelated to worldly affairs, so heart is focused and merit long and mature. Then all roots and dust leaks naturally purify. Generally, if one’s mind is not wondrously awakened, one cannot endure pure clarity and stillness; thus it says if mind does not roam Heaven, six holes quarrel. Therefore, one true origin is not free from roots and leaks. Now that all dust is exhausted, heart naturally calm and thought silent. Calm heart means tranquil and even. Silent thought means utterly without thought. Then pure incense and observing precepts. Pure incense means burning incense, harmonizing qi dense and dark, communicating truth and reaching sage. Pure shows heart’s purity, incense shows virtue’s fragrance. Precepts mean inspecting body and disciplining self, stopping faults and preventing wrong. Holding means treasuring and maintaining. Once able to calm heart and silent thought, one true is clear and deep, myriad laws all empty, then deeply cultivate the wondrous of non-attachment and non-offense, why then observe precepts? Yet only sages, no thought to madness, if not so, then clarity and governance merit is lax. Thus must first establish the still body, then observe the moving function, naturally manifest. Entering the room facing east means taking qi from there. Knocking teeth nine times gathers myriad gods. Nine is the yang number. The *Supreme Treasure Scripture Spirit Brightness Scripture* says: the method of knocking teeth, left is Heaven’s bell, right is Heaven’s chime, middle is Heaven’s drum. If removing misfortune, ring Heaven’s bell; subduing evil, ring Heaven’s chime; if gathering thought and assembling gods, thinking Dao to true, ring Heaven’s drum. Must close mouth and relax cheeks, making sound hollow and response deep. The *Hidden Annotation Secret* says: teeth are the gall spirit’s outer guard, stomach spirit’s power, water spirit’s brilliance. Is this not using outer guard to remove misfortune, power to subdue evil, brilliance to inspire true? Then tuning voice and correct qi, reciting the precious chapter. Once voice tuned, qi is correct, for the external manifestation is thus. So it says if heart harmonizes, qi harmonizes; qi harmonizes, form harmonizes; form harmonizes, voice harmonizes; voice harmonizes, Heaven and Earth harmonize. The *Hidden Annotation Secret* says: reciting scripture to five hundred words, then knock teeth three times, tongue licking upper and lower lips, swallow saliva three times, making qi not exhausted and voice clear. This section in scripture points to the key method of entering Dao, learners should devote heart. Not just mouth recitation.

Reciting once, voice heard in Nine Heavens. Reciting twice, Heaven and Earth set reverence. Reciting thrice, Three Realms salute chamber. Reciting four times, Heavenly Kings descend immortals. Reciting five times, Five Emperors greet truth. Reciting six times, demon kings bind body. Reciting seven times, stars and constellations close gates. Reciting eight times, dark night brightens. Reciting nine times, all heavens attend. All spirits guard the pavilion.

Those who follow the cultivation method above, thus reciting the chapter’s response is so. Using the two forces: one is yang force, Heaven, thus one recitation voice heard in Nine Heavens. Two is yin force, Earth, thus two recitations Heaven and Earth set reverence. Later text says two recitations resound Earth, originally speaking of Earth alone. Before one recitation voice heard in Nine Heavens, now Heaven gods and earthly spirits both set reverence. Thus combined. As the *Scripture of Deliverance* says, Heaven and Earth set ritual. Three recitations show the Three Powers established, thus all Three Realms’ spirits respectfully salute chamber. Four recitations Heavenly Kings descend immortals. Four recitations correspond to four images: East Blue Heaven, South Red Heaven, West White Heaven, North Mysterious Heaven; Four Great Heavenly Kings gather, spirits and immortals descend their places. Five recitations Five Emperors greet truth. Five corresponds to Five Phases, thus five directions’ emperors all lead truth to greet, like guarding soul and attending spirit. Six recitations demon kings bind body. Six is the number of the Great Yin; six heavenly demon kings are the six heavenly old qi. Their power equals Heaven’s, Primordial Beginning distributes transformation, demons born together, testing learners, first small demons then great demons, after passing tests, then recommended to ascend immortal rank. Now at six recitations, the six yin number’s peak, demon power strong, but by six recitations’ merit enough to subdue them, binding body and head, not daring to interfere rashly, merit is great. Seven recitations stars and constellations brighten, opening orifices and opening wisdom. Seven corresponds to seven stars, the seven orifices of humans. Now said to close gates, like the *Scripture of Deliverance*’s meaning of temporarily stopping the wheel. Eight recitations dark night reveals light, eight is the number of Lesser Yin, dark night is yin place, now riding yang qi to brightness. Nine recitations all heavens attend, all spirits guard pavilion. Nine recitations’ merit complete, their response naturally arises; all heavens are formed by Nine Heavens’ qi, all spirits cannot exist outside this qi, thus all naturally gather to guard.

One recitation penetrates Heaven, original womb proclaims and communicates.

The Three Powers are one principle, thus one recitation corresponds to one origin, so it says penetrates Heaven, original womb thereby proclaims and communicates. Also Heaven One produces water, in humans is essence. The *Inner Observation Scripture* says: one month is womb, essence and blood condense. This is due to primordial one yellow evolving qi, generating the origin of life. If qi’s rising and falling does not lose measure, life principle prospers.

Two recitations resound Earth, womb knots untie roots.

Two recitations correspond to two forces, thus above also mentions Heaven and Earth set reverence. Sound issues response, yang sings yin harmonizes, Heaven One Earth Two, the order is so. Two recitations resound Earth, womb knots thereby untie roots, because womb root is tied to Earth. Earth Two produces fire, in humans is spirit, form’s sign then spirit dwells. The *Inner Observation Scripture* says: two months is fetus, form sign embryo. Yet fetus already signaled, so roots knot. Must receive cavern dark purple door qi to nourish it, cutting roots and closing death door, nourishing infant, thus womb root knots untie.

Three recitations divine ritual, soul door refines immortality.

Three recitations correspond to Three Powers, Heaven Three produces wood, in humans is soul. The *Inner Observation Scripture* says: three months yang spirit is three souls, moving to generate. Must receive long spirit bright immortal qi to govern three clouds, thus soul door refines immortality.

Four recitations Heavenly Kings descend immortals, spirit door closes gates.

Four recitations correspond to Four Images, above correspond to Four Heavens. Earth Four produces metal, in humans is spirit. The *Inner Observation Scripture* says: four months yin spirit is seven spirits, still and calming form. Must receive Dang Shi Ming Yan qi to nourish, then spirit master governs roaming qi and refines essence. Closing gates means closing death qi’s gates, preventing external evil, preserving life qi.

Five recitations Five Emperors greet truth, viscera stored and clear frozen.

Five recitations correspond to Five Phases, Five Emperors are five directions’ five qi masters. Heaven Five produces earth, humans born in fifth month, five viscera divided. Spleen earth number is first complete, inside is viscera, outside is flesh. The *Inner Observation Scripture* says: fifth month five phases divide five viscera to calm spirit. Thus five viscera must be complete, then Five Emperors greet truth. These are the five immortals’ middle spirit qi, used to refine original viscera, then purple door produces immortality. Viscera are the five viscera’s counterparts, the receiving and storing houses, like small intestine is heart house, large intestine is lung house, gall bladder is liver house, stomach is spleen house, bladder is kidney house, triple burner is life gate house.

Six recitations demon kings submit and promise, stomach tube produces fluid.

Six recitations correspond to six laws. Merit here can subdue six yin demons, thus six heavenly demon kings all subdued and respectfully in heart, promising and obeying words. Six is the number of water’s completion, thus fluid is spoken. The *Inner Observation Scripture* says: sixth month six laws set six houses, used to nourish spirit. Must receive high perfected pure qi to nourish, then sever fetal tree, stagnation of heart wandering transcends upper capital. Also the viscera’s right has six, why mention only stomach? Stomach belongs to earth, master of Five Phases, can summarize Five Phases. By four seasons, each season earth flourishes eighteen days; by Five Phases, earth is essential. By viscera’s counterparts in ten stems: jia yi wood corresponds to liver and gall bladder; bing ding fire corresponds to heart and small intestine; wu ji earth corresponds to spleen and stomach; geng xin metal corresponds to lung and large intestine; ren gui water corresponds to kidney and bladder. Stomach’s place fits six. Water stops with earth, so stomach is the place receiving fluid.

Seven recitations stars and constellations bright, orifices open and wise.

Seven recitations correspond to seven stars, in humans seven orifices. Seven is the number of fire’s completion, fire can illuminate things, thus corresponding to stars’ light. The *Inner Observation Scripture* says: seventh month seven stars open seven orifices, communicating brightness. Must receive high immortal cavern collection qi to nourish and open. The chapter says seven recitations open heavy gates.

Eight recitations dark night reveals light, three parts eight scenes, complete form and spirit.

Eight recitations correspond to eight trigrams, in humans eight scenes. Eight is the number of wood’s completion. Wood’s nature is kindness and benevolence, position corresponds to East, place of Zhen trigram, master of yangming life qi, myriad beings born from it, thus dark night bright light’s image. Thus humans receive life, one qi as ancestor, dividing three origins in three parts and three fields. Each origin has eight scenes, totaling twenty-four truths. Thus upper part eight scenes, Ni Jiu is lord; middle part eight scenes, spirit master red official; lower part eight scenes, spirit Guan Yuan. The *Inner Observation Scripture* says: eighth month eight scenes spirits complete, descend true spirit. Because true spirit transforms and condenses qi to nourish, form and spirit complete and high roaming, no end to decay. According to *Seven Divinations* knot untying and *Returning to Origin Scripture*: upper eight scenes: brain spirit awake origin son, named Dao Du; hair spirit mysterious literary flower, named Dao Heng; skin spirit communicating all, named Dao Lian; eye spirit void monitor birth, named Dao Tong; crown marrow spirit spiritual pattern cover, named Dao Zhou; backbone spirit beneficial experience aid, named Dao Zhu; nose spirit rushing dragon jade, named Dao Wei; tongue spirit beginning beam peak, named Dao Qi. Middle eight scenes: throat spirit hundred flow release, named Dao Tong; lung spirit white spirit born, named Dao Ping; heart spirit shining yang flourishing, named Dao Ming; liver spirit opening lord youth, named Dao Qing; gall spirit dragon virtue restrain, named Dao Fang; left kidney spirit spring origin true, named Dao Qing; right kidney spirit image earth no, named Dao Sheng; spleen spirit precious origin complete, named Dao Qian. Lower eight scenes: stomach spirit same vermilion nurture, vermilion also called Lai, named Dao Zhan Qiong; intestine middle spirit sign Teng Kang, named Dao Huan Da; small intestine spirit Peng Song Liu, named Dao Chu; torso spirit receiving enjoy Bo, named Dao Ling; chest diaphragm spirit broad Ying residence, named Dao Zhong; two Teng spirits repel horse, named Dao Cheng; left yin right yang middle spirit assist flow rise, named Dao Gui; right yin left yang middle spirit wrap manifest bright, named Dao Sheng.

Nine recitations all heavens attend, three gates five viscera, six bowels nine palaces, golden tower jade chamber, twelvefold gates, purple door jade union, thirty-six thousand joints, root origin beginning, at once generating spirit. Previous chapter says practicing Dao according to law, merit gradually complete.

Nine recitations correspond to Nine Heavens, thus all heavens attend to correspond to human nine palaces. Nine is the number of metal’s completion; things completed become firm belonging to metal; four seasons also regard autumn as the time of completion. The *Inner Observation Scripture* says: ninth month palace chambers arrayed to fix essence. Since virtue and function complete, thus named its heaven No Thought No Knot No Love Heaven, and named its qi Natural Mysterious Illuminating Qi. Three gates are upper jade capital gate, middle spine double gate, lower tail gap gate. Five viscera are heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney. Six bowels are large intestine as Shangshu house, small intestine as original yang house, gall bladder as Lantai house, bladder as Taihe house, stomach as Taisu house, triple burner as Wuji house. Nine palaces are between eyebrows divided into three parts as double field palace, then one inch inward as bright hall palace, three inches as dantian palace also called mud pellet palace, four inches as flowing pearl palace, five inches as emperor one palace, one inch above bright hall as heavenly court palace, one inch above cave chamber as utmost true palace, one inch above dantian as mysterious dantian palace, one inch above flowing pearl as Supreme Sovereign palace. The five viscera also have nine palaces. Golden tower means multi-storied tower. Jade chamber is another name for brain. Twelvefold gates, the *Yellow Court Scripture* says: twelve rings in the tower within tower.
