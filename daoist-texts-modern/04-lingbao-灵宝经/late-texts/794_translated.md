#### Preface to the Commentary on the Scripture of the Jade Chapter of the Nine Heavens’ Birth of Spirits

The Jade Chapter of Birth of Spirits is how the Highest Emperor proclaims the virtue of cherishing life. Therefore, in all precious refinements and mixtures of the Way of Ascending the Morning, nothing is left lacking. Yet its meaning soars beyond the mundane, not the usual words of the world; without transmission and commentary, it is not easily understood. I have heard that the Daoists of Heng Mountain—Xue Youqi, the Grand Minister of Supreme Clarity Li Shaowei, and the Dharma Master of Western Splendor Cheng Xuanying—transmitted it, all penetrating the profound and subtle, but alas, I have not seen their teachings. Later commentaries are many, but only the three families of Wang Yinxian, Xiao Zhenyou, and Fushan Zhenshuai reveal it with some detail. Yet their views differ and diverge; readers cannot grasp one and instead fall into doubt.

When the Jia Shen cycle arrives, the matter is hard to verify, yet they seek deeply the hidden and remote, startling the world and shocking the common folk, passing down this teaching. Spirit is the numinous breath, riding yin and yang, mastering transformations, flowing through above and below, the four directions, without interruption. Heaven moves through the four seasons, giving birth to all things; spirits and immortals wade through the great flood of Heaven without drowning, earth and mountains scorch without heat, riding clouds and commanding winds, nothing can harm them—all are this spirit. When a person’s spirit gathers, life arises; when dispersed, death follows. The nine chapters are named for the birth of spirit; their meaning is profound indeed.

Old commentaries by dozens of families are lost; the highest enter the misty vastness, the lowest sink into common vulgarity, often sighing. A guest once came from the Vast Expanse, showing me Huayangfu’s commentary. Observing its main intent, it gathers the essence of various teachings, blending them into one, citing *Numinous Treasure* and *Yellow Court*, expanding the Way of the Elixir, simple and clear. Like clouds clearing and the bright moon in the sky, it makes one see plainly. Ah, this commentary is the guide to learning the Way. Its words, truly, require the superior person to diligently practice them, just as our Old Master said.

On the fifth day after the double noon of the Ren Shen year of utmost harmony, composed by Zhang Shouqing, the Profound and Subtle Respondent of Supreme Harmony, founder of the Subtle Transformation Palace of Supreme Clarity at Wudang.

#### Commentary on the Scripture of the Jade Chapter of the Nine Heavens’ Birth of Spirits, from the Mysterious Cavern and Numinous Treasure, Scroll One

Commentary by Huayangfu

Cavern means emptiness. Mysterious means profound and distant. Only emptiness can contain myriad wonders; only profundity and distance give meaning depth and length. Numinous Treasure speaks externally of the sacred transformation’s wondrous weight, internally of spirit descending as numinous, qi gathering as treasure. Among the three treasures in the scripture, only Numinous Treasure is named thus, marking the time of the book’s transmission to save people. Natural means the original three qi, responding to the time, appearing, condensing the vast space, phoenix seals and dragon chapters—having form but no trace, naturally forming script, not crafted by sages with intent. The nine heavens are the solitary, boundless, utmost, unknotted, unloving heavens, altogether nine. Birth of Spirits is the method of development and transformation. Scripture is the book that carries the Way, the path to cultivate truth.

The Three Treasures’ Great Golden Scripture

The Three Treasures are Heaven Treasure, Numinous Treasure, and Spirit Treasure. Great Abundance is the name of the Heavenly Treasure Palace. The *Scripture of Saving People* says: “Great Abundance is the wondrous court, meaning the heavenly palace is abundant, nothing surpasses it.” This book was once secretly stored in that palace. Gold is most precious and indestructible, hence it is the right. Its text is the source and flow of the nine chapters.

The Lord of Heaven Treasure is the honored spirit of the Great Cavern. The Elder of Heaven Treasure is the ancestral qi of the Lord of Heaven Treasure. Elder means the qi of the Mixed Cavern, Great Void, Primordial High Supreme King Void—ninety-nine trillion qi. Later, in the first year of the Dragon Han era, the Lord of Heaven Treasure was transformed and born. At the time of the book’s transmission, he was called the High Supreme Great Abundance Jade Clarity Palace.

The Lord of Heaven Treasure is the Jade Clarity Primordial Heavenly Venerable, originally the condensation of the Mysterious One’s qi. The highest is Heaven; above is the sovereign called Emperor. The Dao dwells before the Emperor, thus called Primordial. In the human body, he is the Supreme Emperor Taiyi, the Original Spirit. The Great Cavern is the authority and vehicle of the teaching. Elder is a title of reverence, noble yet without rank. Transforming and giving birth to the Lord of Heaven Treasure, the name was first established. The Mixed Cavern Great Void Primordial is the shape of the Jade Void Heaven before the primal chaos was divided. The number nine corresponds to Qian Yang. The *Chart of Opening and Transformation* says: one is Dragon Han, two is Yan Kang, three is Chi Ming, four is Supreme Emperor, five is Kai Huang—these are the names of heavenly kalpas past. Dragon means spirit; Han means Heaven. Upon issuing the book, the five texts of the *Scripture of Saving People* open and spread, universally nurturing spirits. Jade Clarity Palace is the mysterious seat of the Lord of Heaven Treasure. Ancestral qi is the Dao; Dao is the Lord of Heaven Treasure. Tracing its reason, the wondrous root is self-formed, no ancestor above, taking emptiness as master, nature as root, growing without ruling, for the sage to establish teaching, one must honor its origin, thus forcibly naming it the root of the Dao.

The Lord of Numinous Treasure is the honored spirit of the Mysterious Cavern. The Elder of Numinous Treasure is the ancestral qi of the Lord of Numinous Treasure. Elder is the red mixed Great Void Primordial Mysterious Upper Purple Void qi, ninety-nine million qi. Later, in the Dragon Han era’s opening chart, the Lord of Numinous Treasure was transformed and born; after one kalpa, in the Chi Ming first year, the scripture was issued to save people, called the Supreme Clarity Mysterious Capital Jade Capital Seven Treasures Purple Tenuity Palace. Purple Void comes from the Zhao family’s origin.

The Lord of Numinous Treasure is the Supreme Clarity Heavenly Venerable. From one comes two; for the Original One’s qi. Numinous means wondrous and unfathomable. The Mysterious Cavern scriptures and methods and Numinous Treasure all emerge from the Great Cavern. According to the *Canon’s Preface to the Many Chapters*: Mysterious Cavern is the root, Numinous Treasure is the trace. The qi of the Great Cavern is born from emptiness, flowing as Mysterious Truth, next as Mysterious Cavern, then as Mysterious Spirit. The previous chapter says not Mysterious Truth but Great Cavern, meaning its root. The red mixed Great Void Primordial is the Great Void’s middle light image already sprouting, about to appear. From Dragon Han’s opening chart, the trace is subtly shown; by Chi Ming’s scripture issuance, human culture begins to declare clearly. Chi Ming Purple Void is the Mysterious Yang pattern. Saving people means transmitting scriptures and teachings, all the way to rescue from birth and death. The Purple Tenuity official is where the Lord of Numinous Treasure expounds teaching and stores scriptures. Its qi compared to Jade Void lacks nine hundred million, thus the Dao descends kalpa by kalpa, scattering into myriad beings, no longer as in the ancient undivided chaos. Secretly, the sage’s intent in issuing the book is to worry about later times’ decline, engaging in the end, false cunning, early death of heavenly years, wandering the sea of suffering, wishing to return to simplicity and root, valuing qi firmly as root to advance the Way of Immortality. Therefore, issuing the Jade Chapter earnestly warns and awakens; no greater virtue exists.

The Lord of Spirit Treasure is the honored spirit of the Mysterious Spirit. The Elder of Spirit Treasure is the ancestral qi of the Lord of Spirit Treasure. Elder is the dark silent mysterious penetrating supreme void qi, ninety-nine million qi. Later, in Chi Ming first year, the Lord of Spirit Treasure was transformed and born; after two kalpas, in the Supreme Emperor first year, the scripture was issued, called the Three Sovereigns Mysterious Spirit Supreme Clarity Supreme Ultimate Palace Clear Void, from the Zhao family’s origin.

The Lord of Spirit Treasure is the Supreme Clarity Heavenly Venerable. From two comes three; for the Beginning One’s qi. Spirit is the name of the unpredictable yin-yang transformations. The Mysterious Spirit teaching is the Supreme Clarity’s unfolding of the Way of Great Peace and Non-Action. Its honored scriptures number twelve; externally like Purple Void registers, disaster elimination, purification, heavenly youth scriptures, all belong to it. Dark silent mysterious penetrating supreme means no thought, no action, silent and unmoving, responding and thus penetrating. The old edition lacked the character for “Primordial.” Wang Yinxian added it to harmonize the three origins. Clear Void means light and pure as Heaven; its qi is less by ninety thousand than the red mixed, thinning more and more. Supreme Ultimate Palace is the Supreme Clarity Immortal Realm. In the Great Cavern methods are three origin officials; the Heavenly Venerable once ordered generals Tang, Ge, and Zhou to guard and solemnize the official gates. Their spirits correspond to the three qi above and govern the three parts of the human body below, assisting Heaven’s Northern Dipper pivot, and overseeing talismans, numinous writings, and covenants. If one cultivates the Great Cavern practice to fullness, these three spirits guide one’s ascent, presenting before the imperial palace—this is the Way of Mixture. During the Song Zhihé era, Emperor Renzong was ill, dreaming he walked in brambles, lost his way, saw a spirit clad in golden armor who said to the emperor: “Heaven grants Your Majesty a benevolent heart, bestowing a cycle of longevity.” The emperor asked: “By what path can I return?” The spirit said: “I shall escort you with my chariot.” The emperor mounted and asked who he was. The reply: “I am General Ge.” The emperor awoke peacefully, ordered the Daozang examined, indeed finding General Ge in charge of the Heavenly Gate, thus promoted him and established a temple in the capital. Alas, no one then reported this spirit, relying on their own spirit qi to add preservation功.

Though these three titles differ in year and name, their essence is one. Divided into the three mysterious primordial qi to govern. The Three Treasures are all honored spirits of the three qi, called the birth of the three qi; the three titles combined give birth to nine qi. The nine qi emerge before the vast space, hidden in the empty cavern, without light or image, form or name, color or trace, sound or voice.

The three titles are the officials of the Three Purities. The years are the five kalpas of opening and transformation. Though names differ, their principle is one. From the Mysterious One’s qi transforms Heaven Treasure; later dividing the Original One and Beginning One qi to become Numinous and Spirit Treasures. When the three qi suffice, nine qi arise; nine qi scatter into myriad qi, planting the root of all beings. Before the nine qi emerge, light sinks and traces darken, mingling as one, beyond question.

Guiding the cycles and governing the world, opening the mysterious communication, three colors of chaos, sometimes present, sometimes absent, the cycle pushes to extremes; the three qi open light, qi clear, high, and pure, accumulating yang to form Heaven; qi congeals sediment, accumulating stagnation to form Earth. The nine qi arrange rightly: sun, moon, stars, twenty-eight constellations, yin intestines, Five Phases, peoples and species, all receive generation.

From one dividing into three to become Lord of Spirit Treasure, operating dark silent mysterious penetrating primordial qi to guide yin and yang, accomplish transformation功, governing life and death in the world. The three colors are mysterious qi blue-green, primordial qi yellow, beginning qi white. Before the three qi separate, sometimes present, sometimes absent, the mechanism is already signaled, about to follow the cycle. After separation, Heaven and Earth are fixed in place, peoples and species arise accordingly, showing Heaven, Earth, and Man all emerge from the Dao.

All transformations of Heaven and Earth are nurtured by the three origins, guided by the nine qi; none can be born without them. The three qi are the honored of Heaven and Earth; the nine qi are the root of myriad things; thus the three combine to form virtue, the ultimate of Heaven and Earth.

The three origins and three qi are the ancestors of Heaven and Earth, thus called the sun honored. Transforming and giving birth to nine qi, operating yin and yang, nurturing myriad species, thus called the root. The three combined are the condensation of three qi, endless transformations, thus the virtue of generation is fulfilled. The meaning of ultimate corresponds with the Supreme Ultimate, where yin-yang and Five Phases converge and gather.

Man is born within the womb; the three origins nurture, the nine qi form shape; thus in the ninth month the spirits arrange, qi full and able to voice. Voice yet spirit complete; the Nine Heavens proclaim celebration. Taiyi holds the talisman, the emperor commands fate, recording registers, governing life and death, the Five Emperors oversee birth, the Holy Mother guards the chamber, heavenly spirits and earth deities, the Three Realms all guard. The Nine Heavens’ Sima stands in the courtyard, facing east reciting the Nine Heavens’ Birth of Spirits Jade Chapter nine times. Males have myriad spirits singing reverence; females have myriad spirits singing homage. Males have the Fate Officer respectfully promise; females have the Fate Officer respectfully comply. Thus is birth granted. If the Nine Heavens’ Sima does not issue the fate chapter, myriad spirits do not sing reverence, birth will not occur.

Man is the spirit of myriad things, receiving the harmonious qi of Heaven and Earth. Before birth, in dim obscurity, due to influence, enters the mother’s womb to become a person. The three origins distribute qi as three fields, governing the body. The qi of the Nine Heavens successively gathers soul and spirit, five viscera and a hundred bones, forming the body. Upon the two hundred seventieth day of the ninth month, the triple nine count is complete; then separating from the mother’s form, at this time voice, form, spirit, and qi are all perfect; the Nine Heavens’ birth of spirits功 thus complete—how can one not celebrate? Taiyi, according to the *Mysterious Mirror*, is the great lord of longevity, Taiyi of the Supreme Clarity Great Cavern, holding the talisman to unite myriad spirits. The emperor is the lord of myriad spirits, determining ranks and fate. The Fate Officer is the central elder, named Li Mingchu, styled Xuandu Qing. Determining calculations, preordaining lifespan. The Five Emperors, lords of the Five Phases, descend true qi of the Five Phases into the body. The Holy Mother, the Nine Heavens’ Holy Mother, lord of utmost yin, delights in completing beings, thus forbids misfortune. The Nine Heavens’ Sima once guarded the jade chapter, facing east reciting scripture to inspire birth qi. Myriad spirits sing reverence like playing the zither and striking jade tiles to distinguish male and female. If the Sima does not issue the fate chapter, Heaven’s mandate is not bestowed; if myriad spirits do not sing reverence, Heaven’s principle does not flow; how can one be born? Man’s birth is not easy—should one not strive diligently on the good Way to preserve what Heaven has bestowed?

Fushan Zhenshuai said: When a person lives virtuously, the yang spirit rejoices, saying: “Today is a day of celebration; I and this person are in accord with Heaven.” If evil, the spirits mourn: “I and this person have lost prior discernment of fate, doomed to fall together into the dark shadow.” Dongpo and Chen Luchang’s *Poem on Abstaining from Killing* says: “Not seeing Wang Wuzi, yet before death the spirit weeps.” This is the same meaning. The fate chapter is Heaven’s bestowed fate, as the *Book* says: “Only the august Highest Emperor sends down the heart to the common people.” The *Doctrine of the Mean* calls this Heaven’s mandate, which is called nature. Though Heaven does not speak, it entrusts creation’s功 to the jade chapter; thus it is called the fate chapter.

Man, having returned to birth in the human Way, washes the form in the great sun, startling Heaven and shaking Earth, noble beyond measure. Heaven’s truth and Earth’s spirit, the Three Realms all attend, do not treat lightly. At birth, not lowly. Therefore, one can love one’s form, preserve one’s spirit, honor one’s qi, solidify one’s root, never dying or decaying, attaining spirit immortality. Flesh and bone fly together, ascending to the Three Purities, uniting with the three qi and nine qi.

Yet man, born, does not honor his qi, esteem his form, treasure his fate, love his spirit, thus brings death and decay upon himself, departing from his true root.

Man has death and birth; nature has no death or birth. Beyond birth and death, who hears the Dao? Who sees nature? Ordinary people’s habits are not removed, dragged by karma, lingering in the dark shadow, or repaying each other. When karma is exhausted, good nature does not perish; returning to human birth, one must wash the form in the great sun, then reincarnate. Above the sun’s pavilion, called the Cavern Yang Palace, is the pool of flowing fire, containing the Yellow Blossom True Water. Spirits also wash their bodies in this water. The *Scripture of Longevity and Simplicity* says: Yellow Blossom washes the form—this is what is meant. Having become human, through many stages, startling Heaven and shaking Earth, how can it be lowly? If one can refine and nourish the original spirit, return to root and simplicity, harmonizing with the three qi and nine qi, all have flesh and bone flying together, ascending to the Three Purities—this is the principle. Yet without self-effort, leading to death and decay, alas.

In the past, Ouyang Wenzhong did not pursue Huang-Lao studies; in old age, guarding the Bo Shrine, suddenly had enlightenment. One day, he asked the hermit of Stone Tang about the Dao. The hermit replied: “Your house is already broken; it is hard to speak of this again. Only if you can understand the prior realm, it is almost enough.” Ouyang’s literary achievements were foremost in the world; he had the capacity to receive the Dao, but lost it too late. Still, the功 of making the Dao lies in awakening nature; one must cultivate the foundation of life. If one cannot honor qi, esteem form, preserve fate, and love spirit, sitting will bring decline and old age, mercury dries, lead wastes, life foundation is cut, true nature dims; at this time to cultivate is like digging a well when thirsty—not too late?

The Jade Chapter of the Nine Heavens’ Birth of Spirits is the three caverns’ flying mysterious qi combined into sound, forming numinous script, mixing myriad spirits, hidden rhyme and inner names, birth qi forming shape—natural chapter.

Flying mysterious means the Primordial qi flying through vast space, combining the three caverns into script, sound harmonious as metal and stone, gathering Heaven and Earth’s life-giving intent. Within are myriad spirits’ inner names; reciting it, spirits hear their names, gather and communicate numinously. The *Jade Pivot Scripture* says: “Within the body are nine spirits; why not summon them? Summoning brings good fortune. Within the body are three essences; why not call them? Calling brings celebration.”

Heaven Treasure recites it to open Heaven and Earth’s light. Numinous Treasure recites it to open the nine dark long nights’ souls. Spirit Treasure recites it to control myriad spirits. Taiyi recites it to perfect body and spirit. Emperor recites it to form shape. Nine Heavens recite it to give birth to man. Scholars recite it to ascend Heaven.

When the Three Treasures’ Lords recite the Jade Chapter, they proclaim the wondrous Dao. Taiyi is the Primordial Lord Taiyi. Emperor is the Taiyi Emperor. Though the Jade Chapter is one, those who recite differ; each according to Dao virtue and power, opening and inspiring with varying depths.

Ghost spirits hearing it ascend and transform. Ordinary people hearing it prolong existence. Dark souls hearing it open salvation. Decay hearing it emit smoke. Infants hearing it gain speech. Dead bones hearing it return to life.

Ghost spirits are ghost officials. The *Flying Immortal Treasure Sword Scripture* records: Xiao Miao, talented and esteemed, was a righteous ghost for four hundred years before becoming lord of the underworld. Now hearing the scripture, no need to wait the term, there is hope for ascent. Ordinary people have all six desires; through the scripture become pure and quiet, can live long in the world. Dark souls are ghosts imprisoned in hell; hearing scripture may open salvation, as Zhang Lihua begged the Jade Chapter to rescue. Decay means rotten wood and dead grass; emitting smoke means original qi revives. Returning immortals in Yueyang city south use elixirs to save old trees. Infants gain speech, orifices open and intelligent. Dead bones return to man. Xu Jia, once dry bones, was raised by Laozi’s Supreme Mysterious Birth Talisman—this is the principle.

The Three Treasures’ mysteries are the root of myriad beings. Thus not known by ghosts and spirits, but heard by ordinary people.

The Jade Chapter is most precious to the three honored lords; its功 and use are the root of myriad beings’ generation. Understanding its profound principle, even ghosts and spirits cannot hear it, much less ordinary people.

Those who learn the supreme Dao aspire to immortals, seeking corpse liberation, extinguishing the wheel of rebirth, ultimately returning to the immortal Way, form and spirit united, not separated, both entering Dao truth. Without this scripture, the womb’s knots stagnate, death qi fixes the root of fate, true brightness cannot be preserved, birth qi has no passage, nine gates are blocked, the body does not generate spirit, merely receiving a form, as if qi were borrowed to move. Learning this method, one can sit and attain naturalness.

The Way of the Supreme Truth has seven; the Way of the Most High has three; the Way of the Middle Truth has six; the Way of the Lower Truth has eight. This chapter accords with the *Great Cavern Scripture’s Thirty-Nine Chapters*. Those who learn immortality but have shallow功 remain within the Three Realms, only attaining corpse liberation. Though escaping the wheel of rebirth, they ultimately return to the immortal Way. If one can love form and preserve spirit, one nears the Dao. The *True Declaration* says: When a person dies as if alive, feet not blue, skin not wrinkled, eyes bright as living, all are corpse liberation. Without this scripture, one cannot grasp the Great Cavern’s essential method, cannot sever the womb’s knots, fears death qi fixing the root of fate, true brightness cannot be long preserved. True brightness is spirit light. This means even with corpse liberation, one only receives a form, as if qi were borrowed by the body; dry wood briefly springs, fluids do not nourish, cannot last long. Those who get this method have the secret of mixing myriad spirits. Generally, a person’s body is born of the three qi; having received this radiance, one unites with the Primordial, can mix all mundane qi; spirit follows. Initially, three qi give birth to three spirits, dividing into three parts, eight aspects, twenty-four spirits. If one can mix and transform, the Three-Five perfected persons form the true unity, can call yang and summon yin, entering and exiting without fixed path. Yang qi transforms into dragons and phoenixes; yin qi into jade maidens; riding the storm wheel beyond the eight poles, sitting to attain naturalness—how could this deceive me?

The Three Treasures are honored, the Nine Heavens supremely true, secret in Great Abundance, ninefold golden frame, Purple Yang jade terrace. Unless Heaven and Earth open as one, its text does not emerge. Primordial forbids the book; neither ghosts nor spirits hear it. Stealing it brings the wind blade for myriad kalpas, soul death without rebirth. According to regulation, honor and serve, form and spirit united as immortals.

According to the *Scripture of Seven Transformations Injuring Heaven*: The Supreme Clarity Treasure Scripture has three hundred scrolls, seven thousand jade secrets, seven thousand talisman chapters, and the Scripture of Nature, secret above the Nine Heavens in the Great Abundance Palace—this is one. The ninefold golden frame and Purple Yang jade terrace are where scriptures are stored. Ninefold means ten sets. Frame means bookshelf category. The *Dao Treasure Scripture* speaks of jade and golden frames. The secret is strict; how dare ghosts and spirits steal a glance? When Heaven and Earth brighten, mysterious winds flow, true texts and precious talismans descend in time; long honored, one surely attains enlightenment and understanding, worthy of form and spirit united as immortals.

In the Three Origins’ palace, there are ancient golden names, purple characters carved in books. Those born again should be persons of the Three Purities Immortals, destined to receive this scripture. When the affinity meets, they should offer treasures, serve the master with heart, follow regulations and vows, close the mind and serve, carefully not lightly divulging, lest the wind blade examine the body.

The Three Origins’ examination and verification concern not only dead souls but all who have attained or not attained the Dao. Only golden names and purple characters distinguish those who learn immortality. The Daozang records the Three Origins’ examination of hell’s grades, called the Black Register, the black book. This contrasts with golden names and purple characters, the difference between heaven and earth. Long ago, Li Jue, a commoner of Jiangyang, cultivated功 and conduct long in the immortal register; though not yet elevated, his name as immortal official was already written in golden script in Huayang’s grotto heaven. Not only immortals have this; when Emperor Yuan of Liang was King of Xiangdong, he recorded loyal ministers, righteous men, and literary beauties with three-tiered brushes: loyalty and filial piety in gold, virtue in silver, literary beauty in striped bamboo—also distinguished. This shows those with prior immortal affinity, recorded in immortal registers, can receive and uphold the Jade Chapter, fasting with golden treasures, serving the master with heart, not lightly transmitting. Closing the mind and serving means resting the heart, screening worries, calmly practicing scriptures and teachings. Those who leak or are lax bring their own punishment.

The method of cultivation: a thousand days of long fasting, unrelated to worldly affairs, all dust leaks exhausted. Level the mind, silently recite, hold pure incense and precepts, enter the room facing east, knock teeth nine times, regulate voice and correct qi, recite the precious chapter.

Fasting means single-minded empty heart. The method of cultivation aims for success in three years. Before fasting, the mind fights with things, wind rushing, fire blazing, no moment’s rest. After fasting, thoughts are aligned, reaching calmness and constant stillness, becoming one with the great void. Dao books record eight leaks: eyes tears liver leak, nose mucus lung leak, mouth saliva kidney leak, external sweat heart leak, night sweat small intestine leak, sleeping drooling brain leak, dreams with ghosts spirit leak, lust body leak. When the heart lord is settled, these cease. Level means even. Silent recitation means holding thought to the true. Long ago, Immortal Ge fasted on Mount Tiantai less than a year, sensing and communicating with the supreme sage Qu Xin’s secluded chamber—this is the response to long fasting. Entering the room facing east aligns with birth qi. Knocking teeth: left is heavenly bell, striking ghosts and spirits; right is heavenly chime, gathering myriad spirits; center is heavenly drum, greeting true sages. Knocking teeth and burning incense, regulating voice and correct qi—all are essentials of scripture recitation.

Reciting once, voice heard in Nine Heavens. Twice, Heaven and Earth set reverence. Thrice, Three Realms bow in the chamber. Four times, heavenly kings descend as immortals. Five times, Five Emperors greet the true. Six times, demon kings bind their bodies. Seven times, stars and constellations close their gates. Eight times, dark night brightens. Nine times, all heavens attend; all spirits guard the pavilion.

This chapter unites Heaven and Man’s marvel; Heaven and Man are no two principles. My heart is Heaven and Earth’s heart; my qi is Heaven and Earth’s qi. Having one sincerity, this response is that response. Once, Duke Jing of Song said one word, Mars retreated. King Tang blamed himself with six matters; great rain for thousands of li. Such response and resonance—how much more when reciting the ancestral qi’s sound? The transformation of ancestral qi is great; Heaven and Earth universal, Three Realms, stars, constellations, Five Phases, outside demons, below dark spirits, all divide and spread by this, following their place, according to good and evil, high and low, fittingly. Twice, Heaven and Earth spirits hear and set reverence. Thrice, Three Realms’ spirits descend to recite in the chamber. Four times, heavenly kings descend as immortals. Daoist heavenly spirits have titles of Dharma King and Heavenly King; summoned to descend, like Immortal Ge’s focused fasting method, causing Xu Zhenren to descend and transmit scripture. Five times, Five Emperors, lords of the Five Qi, see the true scripture and pay respect. Six times, demon kings of yin number six great demons, co-created with Primordial. Fasting and offering have methods to command demons, driving them away, making them hear scripture and bind their bodies, daring not offend. Seven times, stars and constellations close gates, the *Scripture of Saving People*’s Xuanji wheel stops, spirit light settles. Eight times, dark night reveals light, yang breaking yin. Nine times, all heavens attend, spirits guard the pavilion. Like Li Shun reciting the *Great Cavern Scripture* for three years, one night suddenly a thousand flying immortals gathered in the air, spirit light illuminating the room, thus attaining the Dao.功德’s response: corpse remains and dragon appears, deep silence and thunder sounds, unplanned and natural.

One recitation penetrates Heaven, womb origin proclaims.

The foregoing words respond externally; this speaks of inner功 to clarify the method of returning the elixir in the Great Cavern. One recitation womb origin proclaims means Heaven One gives birth to water. Man’s birth begins from the womb origin, condensing embryo yellow evolving qi, flowing, rising and falling, not losing measure, life intention gradually nourished. If womb origin is blocked, there must be the calamity of Heaven’s gate. Cultivators of truth, when inner elixir first descends功, thoughts and breath all settled, spirit begins to gather, life gate below opens—thus opening.

Two recitations echo Earth, fetus knots untied.

Earth two gives birth to fire; in the second month fetus forms. Still fearing death qi fixes the root, making it knot and firm, must use true qi to steam and disperse, then can nourish long. The *Supreme Clarity Mysterious Cavern Scripture* has the Taiyi Emperor’s talisman to untie three gates and twelve knots, written in vermilion on green bamboo slips, with prayers to untie.

Three recitations spirit ritual, soul gate refines immortality.

Heaven three gives birth to wood; in man it is soul. In the third month yin and yang begin to separate; soul gains substance. Soul gate is on the left, belonging to yang. Elixir功 turns thrice; yang qi suffices. Its method is to condense spirit and enter breath to nourish it; thus spirit and wisdom arise; the Blue Emperor guards the soul; Wood Duke writes the slips.

Four recitations heavenly king descends immortal, soul gate closes.

Earth four gives birth to metal; in man it is spirit. In the fourth month spirit is born; spirit gate is on the right, belonging to yin. Elixir refines four turns, using yang to nourish yin, causing spirit and soul to bear each other. Its method: nose is heavenly aperture, connected to lungs. Lungs govern spirit, calm and unmoving, cutting off coming and going breath, called closing the gate. Naturally, the flower pond water fills, watering heart vessels; heart fire descends, kidney water rises; Ding and Ren combine, matching the inner elixir. If not closing the gate, soul scatters and wanders, following dreams in and out; soul cannot control, letting it act, ultimately entering ghost throngs.

Five recitations Five Emperors greet true, viscera and bowels clear and cool.

Heaven five gives birth to earth; man is born in the fifth month; Five Phases qi sufficient; five viscera and six bowels born. Five viscera: heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney. Six bowels: small intestine, gallbladder, stomach, large intestine, bladder, triple burner. Clear and cool means peaceful and undisturbed. Cultivators of truth, abstaining from desire, kidneys do not leak essence; quiet and silent, heart does not lose spirit; settled breath, lungs calm spirit; simple vision, liver nurtures soul; concentrated thought, spleen calms intention. Yellow center connects principle, preserving harmony; spirit, soul, and intention gather as one—called clustering the Five Phases; their qi ascends to the mud pellet, called greeting the true. Then Blue Emperor guards soul, White Emperor attends spirit, Red Emperor nourishes qi, Black Emperor connects blood, Yellow Emperor rules center; myriad spirits do not transgress.

Six recitations demon king submits, stomach tube produces fluids.

Demon king means internal six desires. Submit means compliance. Controlled by the Jade Chapter, thus subdued. Stomach and spleen are outer wrapping, storing grains and water to nourish the five viscera. The *Difficult Scripture* says the qi of the five viscera all meet in the stomach. Fluids’ moistening and drying relate to thought. If led by six desires, thought loses correctness, seeing food as saliva, meeting sorrow as tears, shame producing sweat, anger surging blood, going out and not returning. Inner nourishment lost, essence qi and spirit scatter and leak, leaving only dry bones—called the dead. If six demons submit, thought correct, with inner lord, fluids generate in stomach, irrigating limbs, moistening elixir cauldron; essence qi and spirit thus condense, called the living.

Seven recitations stars and constellations bright, orifices open and clear.

Heaven has seven luminaries; man has seven orifices; by the seventh month all open, governing sight, hearing, eating, breathing, intake and output. Some say brightness comes from the heart, seven responding to fire number. The wise have seven holes in the heart, thus bright. The foolish rarely open, or few, thus dim and turbid. Elixir功 turns seven times, heavy gates open blockages, upper and lower clear. The *Heart Seal Scripture* says: “Seven orifices connected, each orifice bright; holy sun and moon illuminate the golden court.”

Eight recitations dark night reveals light, three parts eight aspects, fully forming shape and spirit.

Yan Luozi says: Eighth month spirit complete. Three parts are upper, middle, and lower. The *Central Vow Register* records: Upper part’s eight aspects—spirit of head, brain, eyes, nose, ears, mouth, tongue, teeth. Middle part’s eight aspects—lung spirit, heart spirit, liver spirit, spleen spirit, left kidney spirit, right kidney spirit, gall spirit, throat spirit. Lower has eight aspects—stomach spirit, large intestine spirit, small intestine spirit, torso spirit, diaphragm spirit, two flanks spirit, left yin and yang spirit, right yin and yang spirit. Together twenty-four, corresponding to twenty-four qi. Upper part’s spirit led by brain spirit, preserved at dawn. Middle part’s spirit led by heart spirit, preserved at noon. Lower part’s spirit led by kidney spirit, preserved at midnight. After eight recitations,功 nearly complete, body naturally has light, illuminating dark and clear. The three parts’ eight aspects’ spirits all fully formed without slack. The *Scripture of Saving People* says: “Eight aspects merge in darkness, qi enters mysterious depths.”

Nine recitations all heavens attend, three gates five viscera, six bowels nine officials, golden tower jade chamber, twelvefold gates, purple gate jade union, thirty-six thousand joints, root origin beginning, all at once birth spirit.

The *Yellow Court* calls mouth the heavenly gate, hands the human gate, feet the earthly gate. Also, below the brain is the upper gate; between the spring points is the middle gate; inner kidneys facing each other are the lower gate. Viscera and bowels as above. The *Nine Palaces Mysterious Truth Scripture* says: Between the eyebrows entering three fen is the twin cinnabar palace; one cun inward is the bright hall palace; three cun is the elixir field palace, also called mud pellet palace; four cun is the flowing pearl palace; five cun is the emperor palace; one cun above bright hall is the heavenly court palace; one cun above the cave chamber is the ultimate truth palace; one cun above elixir field is the mysterious elixir palace; one cun above flowing pearl is the supreme emperor palace. The golden tower is the throat, also called the heavy tower, inside are twelve pavilion chiefs guarding with jade halberds, governing qi flow up and down. The *Yellow Court Scripture* says: “Heavy middle tower joins twelve rings, all true persons above and below.” Jade chamber is another name for brain palace. The *Yellow Court* calls it the jade chamber. Purple gate, according to the *Midway Spirit Register*, is above the eyebrows enclosing the purple gate cave chamber, outside are myriad spirit emperors, named Feng Lingfan, guarding it. Jade union is the jade hall, the lower yuan elixir field. Yang spirits eighteen thousand, yin spirits eighteen thousand, combined thirty-six thousand. This means in the womb, form and qi transform; by ninth month complete, myriad spirits simultaneously born. Cultivating truth nine turns, sacred fetus complete, myriad qi all immortal, likewise.

Nine recitations form one circuit. One circuit complete, Three Realms raise names, Five Emperors distinguish friends, called perfected persons. Ten circuits connect qi, controlling myriad spirits, demon kings protect and promote, arrayed before the heavens. One hundred circuits connect spirit, sitting to attain naturalness, Taiyi passes talisman, primordial lord born. One thousand circuits connect numinous, sitting in death and life, immortal boys and jade maidens serve east and west. Ten thousand circuits complete the Way, galloping dragon chariot, ascending morning sun.

Three Realms raise names, Heaven and Man mutually praise virtue. Five Emperors are lords of five directions and five qi. Friends distinguish and record good功, treating them as friends, separate from ordinary people. Refining body into qi is called perfected person. Ten circuits connect qi, Dao qi flows, ghosts and spirits subdued. Demon kings protect and promote; beginners tested by demon kings; if not retreating, they promote, registering in heaven’s records, thus completing Dao. Connecting spirit is boundless transformation, sitting to attain naturalness, without contrivance, like conducting the six Jia to perform kitchen rites. Taiyi passes talisman. Taiyi is lord of myriad spirits; talisman symbolizes the body’s numinous qi. The *Scripture of Saving People* says: “Holding register and book, preserving life root.” Primordial lord is the title of female immortal, mother of human body qi. The *Dao De Jing* says: “I alone differ from men, seeking food from mother.” One thousand circuits connect numinous,功 mature, wondrous use hard to fathom, sitting in death and life. Immortal boys and jade maidens serve east and west, guarding the three one method. The *Supreme Clarity Bright Hall Mysterious Elixir True Scripture* says: If Daoists perform the Most High summons of the three one to guard form, they may meet perfected persons, penetrate spirit and see clearly, sitting in death and life, commanding six Ding; the Highest Emperor gives twelve boys and girls each to serve left and right. At ten thousand circuits, this heart and scripture merge as one, able to ride clouds and dragons, roaming and feasting in Supreme Clarity. Ascending morning means rising with dawn qi’s purity, preserving Taiyi mixture, often using this time. The *Yellow Court Scripture* says: “Feathered robes complete, eight winds drive, controlling chariot of three pure ones ascending morning glow.”

#### Commentary on the Scripture of the Jade Chapter of the Nine Heavens’ Birth of Spirits, from the Mysterious Cavern and Numinous Treasure, Scroll Two

Commentary by Huayangfu

The Primordial Heavenly Venerable, at times in still repose, resting within the Cloud Palace’s Yellow Chamber, inside the seven treasure canopy, peacefully nurturing simplicity, refining truth in the empty blue, savoring the mysterious grace, bowing to study the birth of spirits, the subtle principle of the great chaos, howling clearly through the Nine Heavens.

The Heavenly Venerable rests in stillness, nurturing simplicity and refining truth, content in quietude, the great harmony’s radiance. Empty blue is the qi of the beginning blue sky. The Cloud Official’s Yellow Chamber, seven treasure canopy, is the heavenly palace’s adornment. To savor and study means to delight in meaning. The subtle principle of great chaos is the utmost subtle truth, not revealing its origin. Howling clearly means to stretch the breath, open the numinous heart.

At this time, the Flying Heavenly Great Sage, the Limitless Spirit King, Jade Assistant Supreme Steward, and the Four Assistants attend morning service, fasting and establishing the rite, serving at the side. Leaning on jade-like countenance to wondrously sense, gazing with numinous eyes to open the heart, secretly holding the Jade Chapter and leaping with joy, feasting on Heaven’s music and receiving life, daring to seize the moment and awaken, risking numinous eyes to reveal the heart.

Spirit King, Supreme Steward, and Morning Attendant are all close ministers. The Four Assistants correspond to the Four Helpers, front and rear ministers, left and right aides. Fasting means empty heart awaiting questions. Establishing the rite means the Spirit King holds it, receiving orders to summon myriad spirits. Jade-like countenance means pure jade. Numinous eyes mean nothing is not illuminated. The Spirit King at this time looks up to Heaven’s countenance, hears Heaven’s music and admires the Jade Chapter, suddenly enlightened, seizing the moment to reveal his long-held heart, making requests.

Then the Flying Heavenly Great Sage Limitless Spirit King steps forward, bows, and says: “Humbly I meet and may serve the numinous pavilion, not begrudging my narrowness, daring to wash the dark ferry, deeply awakening the mysterious, ranking as Spirit King, commanding life and death, leading heavenly immortals, rewarding and supervising the seven awakenings, viewing distant lands, respectfully attending the Supreme Steward.”

The Spirit King wishes to request the Jade Chapter, first addressing the Heavenly Venerable, saying he does not measure his narrow talent, daring to wash heart filth at the dark sea ferry. Deeply awakening the mysterious means profound cultivation. Commanding life and death below are the Spirit King’s duties. Rewarding and supervising the seven awakenings means receiving imperial orders to bestow favor on those who study the Dao. Xiao Zhenyou says the seven awakenings, according to the *Numinous Treasure Scripture of Fixed Observation*, are: one, heart and mind settled, easily awakening all dust leaks; two, old illnesses all vanish, body and mind light and refreshed; three, replenishing early loss, returning years and life; four, long life and clear sight, called immortals; five, refining form into qi, called perfected persons; six, refining qi into spirit, called spirit persons; seven, refining spirit to unite with Dao, called supreme persons. Harmonious means the post is harmonious, respectfully attending the Supreme Steward, as Morning Attendant responds.

Now, seizing the moment to respond, treading the nine suns, traversing the yin register, patting palms over the people. The great cycle approaches, numbers end at Jia Shen; floods sweep filth, disasters fill Heaven; the Three Officials drum the pen, judging various people, calculating功 and faults, good and evil to be divided.

Moment means before the matter. Meeting means encounter. Treading means walking. Nine means the high yang’s mysterious communication. Register means record. It means yang extreme gives birth to yin, communicating and treading the yin register. The Three Officials are Heaven, Earth, and Water. They drum pen tips, distinguishing people’s lifelong good and evil, delivering blessings or calamities. People, Xiao Zhenyou says, are called four kinds by the Four Brahma Heavens, above the twenty-eight heavens, beyond the three calamities. The Spirit King pities the then flood calamity, thus seizes the moment to request the scripture, proclaiming Dao power to save.

From Chi Ming onward, to Supreme Emperor first year, according to the Primordial Yang Jade Register, those saved number two hundred forty thousand.

Chi Ming is the time of Numinous Treasure saving people. Supreme Emperor is the time Spirit Treasure issued scripture. Primordial Yang is the Purple Tenuity official. The Nine Dark Jade Register has true assessment rules, recording people’s功 and faults. Those saved are all good people.

After Kai Huang, numbers reach Jia Shen; heavens select and sequence; immortal offices empty, officials unfilled, wandering and scattering duties, all must select people.

Kai Huang and Heavenly Kalpa names are after Supreme Emperor. The Registrar says: Yesterday, Eastern Splendor gathered all Fate Officers, earth spirits, and clerks, checking and recording, seeing few good people in the world, less than one in fifty, much less immortals. Immortal offices empty, no competent persons; wandering and scattering clerks are all lax. Those with faults are demoted: upper immortals to lower immortals, lower immortals to underworld lords, to repent and diligently cultivate, then restored to old posts. Formerly, Lady Shangyuan reached Primordial Lord rank, but was lax in imperial affairs, neglecting duties, demoted to lower rank, losing true emperor’s register, retreating Purple Void’s post. This shows immortal offices’ promotion and demotion, no difference in grandeur.

According to the Primordial Yang Jade Calendar, at three generations, those who accumulate善功 with heart are selected by the Three Realms, protected by the Five Emperors, named in Heaven, taking one hundred thousand to fill posts, and separately twelve thousand to fill deputy posts.

The jade register above records dead souls. This means the jade calendar records immortal offices’ duties. Three generations are ancestral善功, selecting those with merit over generations to fill immortal official posts; deputies are assistants.

Such examples, sometimes by ancient names like Mysterious Chart,

This selection of immortal officials uses names like Sima Ziwei named in the elixir terrace’s scarlet palace.

Or by bone likeness becoming immortals,

Man receives Heaven and Earth’s pure qi, born not vulgar, crane neck, tortoise jaw, blue pupils, twin ankles, floating and embracing cloud-reaching posture—called Dao forest ritual vessels, worthy of this selection.

Or by extinction and rebirth, revolving the wheel,

Those who do not complete cultivation but die, on extinction day also obtain transfer to immortal official. Formerly Zheng Ren’an born in Chanli, spoke at three days, knew past fate. At twelve, face shone with jade light, abandoned home to roam mountains and forests, later extinguished in the northern Rong’s Ah, attained fruit, called Danling Old Lord.

Or devoted to the Three Treasures,功 thorough Heaven,

Three Treasures are Dao scriptures and masters. Teaching and methods preserved. Students recite their words to clarify Dao, also transforming the unawakened, all devoted. The *Secret True Treasury Scripture* says: Greedy nature extinguished, dust stains absent, precepts and conduct intact, called Dharma Treasure. Angry nature not rising, no resentment of outer dust, settled without birth or change, called Master Treasure. Foolish nature not grasping, no vexation or suffering, wise and unblocked, called Dao Treasure. When greed, anger, and foolishness’s three poisons are extinguished, the Three Treasures manifest,功 thorough Heaven.

Or offering and nourishing master treasures, praised by the Three Officials,

Master means to transmit Dao, establish teaching and scriptures. Since ancient times, no immortal or sage without a master to transmit. For ordinary people, learning also depends on masters to teach; how can one not respectfully believe and offer? Serving diligently with sincerity, truly guiding teaching and precepts, worthy of Three Officials’ praise.

Or cultivating fasting and observing precepts,功德 accumulating and responding,

Fasting means aligning thoughts, thinning flavors, preserving truth. Precepts, like Numinous Treasure’s nine precepts, Zhengyi’s ten precepts, etc. Holding and maintaining long without laxity to accumulate功德. Li Changling said: Daily use is功, daily renewal is virtue. Heaven immortals have one thousand three hundred善, doing one善 a day takes four years. Earth immortals three hundred善, doing so takes one year. But many abandon halfway, have you not heard of drilling stone to worship trees? Purple Void Primordial Lord said: Formerly Master Fu loved Dao from youth, entered Jiao Mountain stone chamber, accumulated seven years, suddenly met Supreme Ultimate Perfected Person who gave wooden drill to bore a stone slab. Precept: When stone is pierced, I shall save you. Stone five feet thick, Fu bored tirelessly for forty-seven years, suddenly stone pierced, the Perfected Person came to save him. Lady of Southern Mountain said: Formerly one person strove for Dao, but did not know the Way’s method, only worshipped a dead tree day and night for twenty-eight years; suddenly the tree bloomed flowers with juice like honey; that person took flowers and juice to swallow, thus attained longevity. Ah, wood and stone without feeling can still respond; how much more fasting and precepts, accumulating功德 to reach high spirits?

Or scattering wealth and treasures, establishing Dao halls,

Gathering wealth, it is precious to give and relieve; otherwise, one is a great thief, only inviting ridicule. Establishing Dao halls means building splendid buildings, enshrining honored images, expounding scriptures and teachings, inspiring good hearts. The *Scripture of Wondrous Dharma and Original Appearance* says: Supreme Clarity Purple Void Perfected Person, realizing past deeds, gathered worthy to build immortal Dao halls, copying scriptures in myriad alleys, always offering fasting food and clothing, never ceasing, thus becoming a perfected person. Recorded in Langhan, truly not false.

Or rescuing and aiding the poor and needy, carrying and saving Heaven and Man,

Compassion is in all people; how can one bear to see poverty and not help? One should aid according to ability. Formerly Zhou Xihua loved giving; though poor and suffering, never weary. Wise Guān Perfected Person transformed into a beggar to test this; Zhou truly loved giving, immediately saved as Western Splendor Perfected Person. During Song Sheng era, great famine in Zizhou; You Sheng Zhenjun transformed into an old man selling steamed duckweed, saving many. At Jianlong’s end, famine in Hebei; Zhenjun transformed into merchant, transported 150,000 hu of grain into city; merchant suddenly vanished; officials took relief to neighboring counties. Zhenjun rose to high perfected rank, yet such acts show a single thought of loving life is like Heaven’s unceasing mercy. Also like Huang Jianji scattering grain without raising price; Purple Fu Zhenjun respectfully sat on Governor Zhang Guaiya’s seat. Wang Shiliang shone rice; letting shiner measure, one word brought sweet rain;功行 manifest. Good people doing善, can one not strive? Carrying and saving is like earth bearing things, boat ferrying people.

Or being one of the Three Masters,功 full and sufficient, named by Heavenly Officials.

Three Masters are scriptures saving three masters. Establishing rules to save life and death; students follow their legacy, spreading Dao transformation to establish功行; if accumulated fully, named in heavenly registers.

Calculations and registers correspond to Three Officials, all reverse recording seed names, with distinctions above and below, no omission.

The Three Officials divide nine palaces, totaling seventeen prefectures, one hundred twenty departments. Left is yang birth palace; right is yin death palace. Left prefecture’s blue register records功; right prefecture’s black register records faults. Some sins involve blessings; blessings involve sins; not confined to one department. Some three years, some nine, some twenty-four years, all periods of calculation. If Three Officials’ records match, then seed names are recorded; if reversed, good is insufficient, also recorded.

Also, the Nine Dark Prefecture, commanded by Eastern Splendor Blue Palace’s Nine Dragon Talisman, extracts from the Nine Dark Jade Register men and women dead souls, whose past names have善功 sufficient, to receive salvation, taking three hundred twenty thousand to fill after Jia Shen’s driving out, opening Great Abundance’s people.

Nine Dark Prefecture governs nine earths and nine yins, managing dead souls. Eastern Splendor Blue Palace, according to the *Yellow Qi Yang Essence Scripture*, is Fusang, the Cavern Yang. It governs birth registers, sending Nine Dragon Talisman to the Nine Dark Prefecture, selecting men and women dead souls, those with善功 to receive salvation. Great Abundance means flourishing.

At this time, birth and death meet,善 and evil judged; those passing are truly joyful.

Judging means distinguishing善 and evil. Evil cannot escape calamity;善 summons auspiciousness and no harm—how joyful!

Yet the Three Officials are strict; documents are numerous; Dragon Gate receives meetings; Bird Mother supervises immortals; myriad saints manifest their presence, no rest through the night.功 and faults equalize, making birth and death impartial. This confusion is also my worry. The great time is near; matters incomplete; always fearing one day to suffer public judgment.

Near means grinding. Documents are numerous and complicated. Dragon Gate is at the confluence of the Hedong waters. Fushan Zhenshuai says Bird Mother is water spirit, once in past kalpa, obeying Earth Mother’s summons, at Dragon Gate managing river meetings, riding great phoenix chariot, carrying those learning immortality on water, ascending Kunlun, called supervising immortals. Myriad saints and perfected ones inspect善 and evil, making birth and death just; Spirit King overwhelmed with affairs, fearing omissions, cannot avoid worry.

I humbly hear the Heavenly Venerable’s great compassionate transformation, pitying all beings, opening the Nine Heavens’ depths to aid the people. Clear rules and prohibitions, not for humble servant to hear. Yet great time is near, Jia Shen ending, cycle hastening, great法 should proceed.

Jade Clarity’s four cultivation methods place compassion first; Laozi’s Three Treasures place compassion foremost. The sage expands and fills it; nothing is not touched by its grace. Clear true rules and precepts, scripture transmission has fixed time, ordering Spirit King to request when not yet time, urgent to save people.

So that those with heart may be found in calculations, hear法音, open vision and hearing, encourage and transform the unawakened. For this reason I present above, fearing to offend Heaven’s countenance, hoping to see pity, granting what was unheard.

Requesting scripture means to let those with heart learning Dao but not yet awakened receive mysterious transformation, advance善行, avoid wrath from Three Officials.

Then the Heavenly Venerable leaned over the desk, raised high, concentrated spirit and distant thought, reciting the Mysterious Chapter, howling and chanting the jade-like sound. After a long while, suddenly sighed: “The supreme model is vast and boundless, principle subtle and profound, Dao reaches heavy mystery, qi crowns spirit firmament, utmost hard to speak, wondrous hard to surpass.”

Leaning over desk means receiving. Raised high means looking higher. Concentrated spirit and distant thought means deep contemplation. Reciting Mysterious Chapter, howling jade-like sound, clear resonance shaking. Supreme model vast and boundless, principle subtle and profound, Dao reaches heavy mystery, qi crowns spirit firmament: the scripture’s wondrous model and utmost principle, vast and distant emptiness, its Dao penetrates myriad wonders, its qi originates from spirit firmament. Spirit firmament is one of the nine firmaments, leading all heavens. This means the Jade Chapter has ineffable wonder, no scripture surpasses it.

You now hold the emperor’s position, entrusted as Spirit King, flying through jade palace, four stewards at bright wheel, gazing afar, overseeing infinity, harmonizing myriad transformations, caring for all beings.

Spirit King’s office is emperor; entrusted means king. The *Thirty-Nine Chapters Commentary* says: Jade palace’s Great Micro Pavilion is truly the Heavenly Emperor’s jade character. Also says: The sun and moon in the human realm are bright wheels, all needing Spirit King’s wings and aides. Besides harmonizing myriad beings’ birth and transformation, surveying all affairs, not just one aspect.

Now the great cycle begins, Three-Five announce time, one hundred six respond to moment, yang nine arouses, great spring drums waves, myriad disasters afflict Heaven, four palaces select and appoint to fill people. Three generations confused,善 and evil should be divided. You must toil for the people, weary with Three Officials, at the turning of rise and fall, matters must open and enable; now entrusted to you, strive.

This Heavenly Venerable formerly urged Spirit King to save people amid floods.

Precious book wondrous weight, Nine Heavens’ numinous sound, bestowed on supreme sage, not heard by ghosts and spirits. Clear true rules, once in forty thousand kalpas transmitted. Now breaking prohibition to entrust you secretly; do not lightly transmit.

Passing on numinous chapter, respectfully warning thus, so urgent, can you not be cautious?

Summoning the Nine Heavens’ Sima, attending immortal jade boy, opening Purple Yang jade register, cloud brocade pouch, issuing Nine Heavens’ Birth of Spirits Jade Chapter. Four aides arrayed, Five Elders oversee truth, Taiyi commands time, Jade Emperor chants covenant, all according to respectful protocol, facing south long kneeling, entrusting the Flying Heavenly Limitless Spirit King. Rituals complete, heavens resume positions.

Summoning means no delay. Attending immortal jade boy is scripture official. Purple Yang is scripture storage place. Jade register cloud brocade is scripture pouch. Four aides correspond to Four Helpers. Five Elders: Jade Clarity Haoyi Primordial Elder, Void Emperor Spirit Light First Elder, Mysterious Splendor Treasure Heavenly True Elder, Dewy Supreme Ultimate Ancestor Elder, Suoyu Hongjing Immortal Elder. Taiyi is Central Yellow Taiyi. Command time is choosing good time. Jade Emperor is the High Jade Emperor. Overseeing truth chanting covenant, bowing and kneeling, all are the true transmission of scripture ritual.

The Heavenly Venerable solemnly told the Flying Heavenly Spirit King: This chapter of the Nine Heavens is the three caverns’ flying mysterious qi, three gatherings forming sound, forming true text, mixing myriad spirits, hidden rhyme and inner names. Thus the Great One’s precept observation, preserving life in the Ten Directions, comprehending the cavern void, opening oath with cinnabar and blue.

Mixing hidden rhyme as above commentary. Wang Yinxian says the character for precept should be trial. Meaning Taiyi’s spirit once tested those learning Dao; if heart does not retreat, then allowed to open oath with cinnabar and blue. The *Transmission and Completion Formula* says: Once receiving the spirit scripture, some test me; without cause they beat my hand till blood flows, yet I still incline heart and believe. Scripture and method have trial agreements; before receiving, without cause setting fire to clothes, clothes burned but still no word, then is no retreat. The *Golden Mysterious Feather Scripture* says: Transmission method all opened by Five Elders, Taiyi tests and observes Ten Directions. So trial character mistaken for precept, examined. Among six caverns, the cavern void belongs to west; yet Primordial Heavenly Venerable orders Taiyi to preserve life in Ten Directions, governing life qi and death register, thus says comprehending cavern void. Cinnabar and blue mean swearing blood as cinnabar, fasting cloth as blue, to express faith and establish covenant.

From countless kalpas’ affinity, past names in imperial chart, not allowed to see, but obtaining glimpse of chapters, nine ancestors all immortals. When selecting those destined to be immortals, fasting a thousand days, carrying gold and silk to swear heart, following covenant to transmit. Be cautious to enjoy blessings; leak and disaster come. Blessings extend to nine ancestors, virtue heavy as mountains and seas. Inviting disaster means punishment for countless kalpas, pain in poison soup, wind blade punishing; can one not be cautious?

Countless kalpas’ affinity means accumulation not of one lifetime. When Master Xu rose, the Highest Emperor decreed: “You from many kalpas ago accumulated cultivation to Dao, diligent and complete, scripture and method profound, myriad法 and thousand gates all experienced. Now you ascend, ordering Left Great Strength Heavenly Ding and Flowing Gold Fire Bell to illuminate and clear the Central Yellow, no negligence allowed, still sealing distant ancestor Xu You as Jade Void Deputy, great-grandfather, ancestor, father ranks all with order; thus past names in immortal register and imperial chart exist. Obtaining glimpse of chapters, nine ancestors all immortals; how much more those reciting this scripture? Now lower people hearing Dao mock it, only because of disbelief, thus cannot hear; not Dao abandoning them, but they abandoning Dao, no other reason. Past evil deep and heavy, blocking善心. The *Five Emperors Internal True Scripture* says: Those attaining Dao have no immortal bones, carving names in jade books; next life cannot glimpse chapters; having the text means becoming Five Mountains’ patriarch. The *Great Cavern Scripture* says: Many cultivators first untie dark knots; thus nine ancestors all immortals. Seven hundred years is the scripture’s issuance time. Fasting a thousand days is scripture transmission period. Now silk and treasure cloth are the scripture’s pledge and trust. Jade Chapter secret in Heaven above; transmitting it is not easy; those receiving must strictly honor, clarifying hidden profundity, so as not to fail Spirit King’s initial request.

Commentary by Huayangfu

The First Chapter of the Birth of Spirits of the Boundless Solitary Heaven

Heavenly Qi: Azure Color

The *Three Origins True Scripture* says: Man’s qi and soul come from Heaven; body and form come from Earth. Formless and imageless, coming from emptiness, from non-being to being, residing in the womb ten months, actually nine months. Each month receives one day’s qi to birth spirit; at nine months qi full, spirit complete, exiting womb to become person. The *Record of Western Mountains* says: Those who nurture life well go from non-being to being; those who do not, return from being to non-being. Man’s qi and blood just strong, giving received spirit qi to passion and desire; blood and qi decline; the soul and spirit return to Heaven and Earth; body becomes dry wood. Only cultivators of truth know spirit, soul, and consciousness are Heaven’s temporary loan; thus cherish and refine, long loan not returned, all belong to me.

The *Golden Book Secret Character* says: This Heaven is the Heaven soul essence opening yang qi.

The Emperor’s True Fetus Life Primordial One Yellow Evolving Qi

Emperor’s Name: Min Han Yun

The *Seven Seals of the Cloud Treasury* says: In the first year of Dragon Han, transformed and born Purple Firmament Yellow Evolving Lord, position at Purple Firmament Supreme Emperor Great Brahma Heavenly Official. The Emperor in Heaven uses true qi as the start of fetus life primordial. Wang Yinxian says: Each chapter has the four characters Emperor True Life Primordial, referring to the Yellow Court Primordial King below the life gate, governing birth qi, called emperor for governance, true for Taiyi unpaired. The nine heavens’ proper officials all follow Emperor True’s command; fate fixed and unchanging. Yuan means the name of qi’s beginning. The *Book of Changes* says: “Great is Qian Yuan, source of myriad things. Great is Kun Yuan, source of birth.” When primordial qi sprouts from below, initially fetus shaped like hanging pouch attached to spleen; spleen belongs to earth, source of birth. Central Yellow Taiyi is man’s life already fixed; its qi flows and evolves endlessly; thus called Primordial One Yellow Evolving.

Mixed empty cavern qi, flying fresh floating remote. Yan Kang endless kalpa, faintly departing original line. Bitter souls sink nine nights, riding morning hoping for yang’s rise.

The Dao Lord says: Primordial qi originates beyond the faint dark void, born between empty caverns, combining and dispersing, dispersing and combining. Before man’s birth, soul and spirit float in remote place, faint and without support, from Heaven above past Yan Kang kalpa to now, countless births and deaths, appearing and disappearing like flowers and fruits leaving the root line, drifting scattered without entering earth. Nine nights are nine earths. Ghosts belong to yin, always dwelling in darkness, following their kind. After long sinking, all desire to raise heads and await the sun’s morning light, hoping for salvation.

Great Abundance’s mysterious gateway, solitary descending spirit firmament. Yellow clouds condense numinous palace, yin-yang qi images intertwine. Fetus origin binds long life, evil roots should transform and vanish.

This is the cultivator’s initial功. Great Abundance Jade Clarity Palace is called man’s mud pellet. When yang first moves,吸 Great Abundance Palace’s qi, directly subduing yang essence, to open mysterious gateway, the secret gate behind the navel. Also receiving the Boundless Solitary Heaven, the morning gold firmament emperor, male and female spirits within the body; morning is female, gold firmament male. The *Yang Essence Scripture* says: Returning yang essence to floating spirit, gathering yellow qi at solitary. Male one female one means heart fluid and kidney qi as infant boy and girl. Fire above water below, how can they meet? If one can preserve and guard Central Yellow, firmly condensing numinous palace, that is the heart. Not thinking outward, not thinking inward, water and fire yin and yang naturally combine. Yin and yang combined, Five Phases inverted, numinous sprouts arise, fetus origin forms, the basis of innate utmost essence generating transformation, bestowing new life; past evil roots and old faults all cleansed, no longer burden. Fushan Zhenshuai records Master Min Zhong’s teacher said: Still and unmoving is earth’s nature. This is true earth; roots and dust severed, myriad worries all vanish, one true pure whole, dark and silent, this was the time of primordial chaos. Cloud palace is yellow chamber. The essence of harmony’s vapor has form, thus called yellow cloud. At this point sun and moon combine, spirit qi mingles, mysterious pearl will form image, Taiyi gradually returns to truth.

Peach Kang unites essence extension, two emperors’ elegant jade floats. Irrigating life gate, refining spirit uncarved.

Peach Kang is life gate’s spirit, named essence extension, honored spirit of Great Cavern, guarding man’s navel. Two emperors are Spirit Emperor and Honored Emperor. The *Hidden Book* says: Without Spirit Emperor, no Taiyi, then mysterious void does not circulate qi; without Honored Emperor, no Taiyi, then three one do not reside. The two emperors’ power proceed together without conflict. Elegant jade floats means pure white appearance. The principle of life arises from here. Among twelve hours, Taiyi’s spirit operates spirit fluid to irrigate life gate, solidifying fetus origin, called refining spirit uncarved. The *Yellow Court Scripture* says: Nourishing spirit root no longer withers, closing life gate preserving jade capital.

The Nine Heavens’ Fate Spirit Chapter, birth spirit spirit self-transcends. Primordial Lord restrains death gate, Sima recites mysterious song. One chant unites myriad true, nine times all heavens attend. Bowing respectfully to kalpa year, celebrating this flourishing old seed.

The Nine Heavens’ Emperor descends the spirit chapter功, gathering true radiance to birth spirit. Spirit birth can transcend and enter sagehood. Man’s body has thirty-nine birth gates, thirty-nine death gates; once born, fears death gates opening again; life primordial lord’s qi must restrain and close, not letting old qi invade. The *Yellow Court Scripture* says: Must obtain utmost truth to watch over, most avoid death qi’s filth and baseness. The longevity Sima sings the mysterious chapter praising generation功; Sima one chant, myriad true harmonize, joyful and responding. After nine recitations功 complete, all heavens’ qi come to greet and rejoice. Through kalpas to now, meeting this moment, past had left the root line, now again sprouts like old—how joyful! Mo Xizi says: Learning Dao and perfect truth is in this birth; lost people seek life at death; having life but not knowing where life is born. Carefully savor this poem; it can drum and blow for birth spirit.

The Supreme Meditation Goodness Boundless Longevity Heaven Birth Spirit Chapter Two

Heavenly Qi: Crimson Color

The *Golden Book Secret Character* says: This Heaven is soul essence bright yang qi.

Emperor True Fetus Life Primordial Purple Gate Qi

Emperor’s Name: Chan Min Chi

The *Seven Seals of the Cloud Treasury* says: In Dragon Han first year, transformed and born Supreme Firmament Purple Gate Lord, this Heaven’s emperor uses true qi as fetus life primordial start.

The Western Peak Treasure Perfected Person says: Man’s second month is fetus; whole body’s root begins from here; thus called fetus life primordial. Perfected Person forms fetus; spirit dwells in purple gate, root connected to life gate, continuous without interruption, called fetus breath. The *Nanhua Jing* says: Perfected Person’s breath follows heel, quiet and qi deep. Ordinary people’s breath follows throat, restless and qi shallow. Shallow means fetus primordial easily scatters, true qi easily exhausted. Life gate is north, called cave dark. Because its qi rises to purple gate, thus called purple gate qi. Purple gate is one cun above eyebrows, entering bone three fen.

Countless knots at purple gate, qi honored as Heaven’s central emperor. Opening salvation flying mysterious fresh, condensing transformation wheel empty cavern. Thus root departs past love, affinity clings to old sect. Dark night sinks distant kalpa, facing great cycle communication.

Countless longevity Heaven descends and injects spirit qi, binding at purple gate, among Nine Heavens the qi honored emperor. Flying mysterious fresh means dead souls first becoming human also receive three caverns’ flying mysterious qi. Heaven emperor condenses and waits in blue sky, turning wheel transforming end in empty cavern to open salvation, instantly removing old root past love’s obstruction, gaining affinity with great Dao as root, clearly understanding old nature sect. Also in past due to greed and love suffered, sinking in dark night, moving through distant kalpas, now repaying is done, great cycle opens, can be reborn.

Emperor True begins bright essence, named character Primordial Yang. Infant Shi Bohua, binds fetus guarding yellow chamber. Sever root, close death gate, nurture infant.

Man receives innate qi and is born. After birth, a point of primordial spirit returns to between kidneys, called Emperor True. Beginning named essence, character Primordial Yang, is the name of life gate’s lower Yellow Court Primordial King, governing this Emperor True. Infant Shi Bohua is mud pellet Heaven Emperor Lord’s infant, named Mysterious Condensing Heaven, jointly holding true qi, binding fetus in yellow chamber. Yellow chamber is central palace. Fetus qi formed, spirit guards it. Evil root death gate means heart’s knotting evil habitual desire root must be cut off; slightest offense, lead flies and mercury runs. Always keep harmony, nurture holy fetus to become infant.

Meditation goodness guides spirit qi, mysterious nursing flying heavenly fragrance. Splendid scene elegant jade form, refining naturally forming visage. Attend to mysterious nurture life, array all bright halls.
