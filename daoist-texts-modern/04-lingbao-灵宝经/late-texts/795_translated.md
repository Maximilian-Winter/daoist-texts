#### The Supreme Scripture of the Limitless Great Dao, the Natural True Unity, the Five-Named Talismans — Upper Scroll

This is the Supreme Treasure upon the Purple Tenuity Terrace, the treasury of myriad true ones hidden within famous mountains and caverns; one secreted in the shadow of Mount Lao.

The Old Lord said: At the beginning of chaos, the subtle and wondrous source. Before the opening, as if there were a spiritual treasure of natural true script, the image preceding the Emperor. I am the abyssal gate of the Lingbao Great Dao. Receiving its subtle essence, I become the spirit of Heaven, Earth, and Humanity. The five talismans divide the pure and turbid qi; I shall depart. The talisman scripture is secreted in the Purple Chamber, passed on endlessly. Ge Xuan said: The dao’s course is boundless through time.

The Old Lord said: The Supreme Lingbao is born before Heaven, Earth, and myriad things. It rides upon the formless, empty, cavernous Great Dao’s constancy; it moves within the Limitless, the Non-action, and the blended naturalness. Its preciousness cannot be named; its honor has no superior—thus called Supreme. The vast encompasses all; the subtle pervades all; its principle is wondrous beyond seeking; it is the source of Heaven, Earth, and Humanity. In Heaven, the five stars govern the qi; the sun and moon shine their light. On Earth, the five sacred mountains bring stability; mountains rise high, seas plunge deep; kings and nobles dwell in the central plain; in humans, the five organs remain safe. If Heaven lacked Lingbao, how could it shine so brightly? If Earth lacked Lingbao, how could forms manifest? If spirits lacked Lingbao, how could they enter the dark? If humans lacked Lingbao, how could they obtain life? Therefore, Heaven, Earth, and Humanity’s three fives unite in the dark, becoming one. Hence all myriad things flourish, taking me as root, me as gate. Why root and gate? Because I possess the Lingbao script. I journey to the Pavilion of Penglai, paying respects as a true person. Entering the bright hall at the center of the myriad heavens, traversing the celestial pivot, ascending the Limitless Purple Palace, I bow as the Dao Lord. Descending to govern myriad things, I come to the central plain, secreted in the shadow of Mount Lao. The Five Emperors succeed one another but must not transmit falsely; false transmission brings death and calamity.

The Old Lord said: When a serpent obtains Lingbao, it transforms into a divine dragon; when birds obtain it, they become phoenixes; when beasts obtain it, they change into qilin; when common folk obtain it, they are called sages. What is a sage? One who possesses the true script of universal sagehood, able to constantly wear it, roaming the five sacred mountains, wandering freely in the vast sky, transforming the five internal organs, changing form and visage, accumulating refined essence, commanding ghosts and spirits, penetrating the Ten Directions, appearing and vanishing unpredictably, ascending heights riding clouds, journeying afar to clear skies, visiting the Pavilion of Penglai, paying respects as a true person, attending court in the Purple Palace, merging merits with the Great Sage and Venerable Spirits. Long ago, the Yellow Emperor received it; above he became the Great Emperor of Taiyi, ascending with the Five Emperors simultaneously to Heaven—this is the path of the upper immortals. Those who can uphold this scripture and wholeheartedly offer it are named among the Supreme Golden Gates, titled Immortal True Persons.

The Old Lord said: When a nation is about to prosper, cultivate and attain this script. Those who desire wealth, honor, and immortality can obtain Lingbao. When the Son of Heaven receives it, phoenixes come in auspicious ceremony; the five stars align; sun and moon shine radiantly; guests from the four directions submit; the world is peaceful and pure; evil does not arise; vassals return in unity; longevity matches Heaven and Earth; myriad generations do not decline. When vassals obtain it, the constellations shine with radiance; the state prospers and families flourish; ranks rise and promotions come; long life and clear sight endure; calamities are kept at bay. When ministers obtain it, longevity is endless; high rank and great emoluments come; promotions to marquis and lordships with two thousand households follow. From minor officials to commoners, all look up and down, penetrating spirits and numinous beings; hearts open and inner faculties unfold; they foresee the unforeseen; high officials and wealthy nobles wear tinkling jade pendants; life is prolonged and children fill the halls. When women obtain it, consorts, queens, and kings are accompanied by jade youths and attendants with azure belts; noble children are born; faces like jade blossoms; longevity matches sun and moon; their colors flow with the three lights. The Immortal Elder said: Since ancient times, the supreme dao has been granted to kings; those with immortal names are the ones who encounter this scripture. Reverent worship surely brings gods and immortals; by day they ascend to Heaven; lords and nobles offer homage; bodies are preserved; longevity is calculated; ancestral temples are protected; states are pacified; eternal great fortune is enjoyed. My words are profound indeed.

The Old Lord said: Spirit means the dao’s communication. Able to connect with the Great Dao to the numinous, commanding myriad gods. Treasure means able to preserve with Heaven and Earth; hence called Lingbao. Supreme means the utmost honor of the dao. Five means the talismans of Heaven, Earth, and Humanity’s fate. Cavernous and mysterious means akin to the great true emptiness. Mother of the Five Phases, hence called the Five-Named Natural Talismans. They correspond above to the five stars, controlling the five measures and forming alliances; below they represent the five sacred mountains; the Five Phases share the same root; the central treasure is the five organs; the root of the five paths; the five musical notes blend harmoniously. When a Daoist obtains them, the five internal organs transform; the spirit of Heaven is communicated; myriad gods are commanded; sitting or moving, cooking or traveling; riding clouds and driving dragons; ascending by day; able to go up or down; transformations without fixed form; acting at will. Dao methods are not complicated; secreted in the Jade Chest; take care not to transmit lightly. This can endure countless kalpas, eternally without end. The Immortal Elder said: It is said that Heaven and Earth have their kalpa cycles; the dao is limitless in time.

The Old Lord said: The Supreme Lingbao Five-Named Natural Talismans are born before Heaven and Earth, transforming with the dao qi; they are the true essence of our dao. All born from Heaven and Earth, all gods of Heaven and Earth return to Lingbao. If you desire a pure and tranquil chamber, mountain dwelling to summon spirits, to ward off disasters and harm, to unite with the true dao, you shall receive the Lingbao true script, the root of the dao.

# The Supreme Scripture of the Limitless Great Dao, the Natural True Unity, the Five-Named Talismans — Lower Volume

The Old Lord said: Wearing the Lingbao Five Talismans causes the essence of the Eight Trigrams to always dwell before the hall’s pivot, governing the Great Microcosm’s floral canopy above, discerning the household’s fortune and misfortune. If you desire to seek the immortal dao, you must first connect with the Eight Essences. The Eight Essences are the eight spirits beneath the dao, all knowing Heaven’s mandate. Lingbao constantly summons the Eight Histories. One must divide the household into eight directions and twelve earthly branches; atop each branch and outside the door on left and right, plant various communicating divine herbs, fourteen plants in total. Take the talismanic drawing of the Eight Trigrams, make the Mysterious Cavern Communicating Spirit Talisman for the eight directions; place the Five-Named Talismans on the central beam of the hall. This causes communication with spirits; within one household, men, women, and children unite their hearts, shining clearly like sun and moon, seated knowing the four directions, living long without aging, summoning immortals. Cleanse the hall to make a purification chamber, square two zhang four chi, dividing equally into eight directions and twelve earthly branches; take seals to repel fourteen persons. First place the direct gate outside the hall’s pivot, forbidding a hundred evils from entering inside. Next place the twelve earthly branches starting from Yin at the hall’s front, carving human forms; those with yang are male, yin are female; place them all in the hall. Dig the earth atop the branches to make pits, leveling their heads to the center. First, at the time of the Spring Equinox on the fifth Yin day, take orchid and mugwort to make a bath; by the fifth Mao day, brew chrysanthemum water at Yin and Mao branches. On the following day, take the seals. At the time of taking, clear the surroundings; prepare small mats as seats, make fourteen places; burn incense, offer wine and dried meat; bow and recite the incantation:

“Seal of the seal’s birth, body pure and chaste, guarding the twelve palaces, qi communicating with spirits. Now shall I join with you, together as divine ministers, friends, roaming the sunlit side of such and such mountain. Call upon you to respond, ask you to sing, vow to never deceive, united in alliance.”

After three offerings of wine, collect the sacrifices. Grasp the root and carve as human form, naming separately male and female. At dawn, when the Heaven meets the Eastern Well star, kneel long before the door, saying: “Great-grandson such and such Jia, having completed bathing today, enters the chamber to place and secure the seal. By the time of the Five-Named days, take the brush and write talismans according to the day, placing the five talismans. After ten days, burn incense immediately. On the day, offer sacrifices to the seal atop the branches. First call its name, reciting: ‘Such and such lord communicates with spirits; now shares your name; after twelve earthly branches and six cycles, will respond on the twelfth day.’ After the sacrifice, thereafter only burn incense, remembering the Eight Histories, knowing their names, and taking white blossoms, dry and prepare, wearing a square dagger, to commune with the body’s spirit and befriend the histories. Later, when Heaven meets the Eastern Well star, remove the talisman, bathe, and replace it. On the following days, repeat as prescribed. Five baths total, filling one hundred twenty-four days; all spirits have arrived, some heard voices, some seen forms as in the diagrams. At dawn, sacrifice beneath the hall’s pivot; spirits speak with you. The six Jia Jade Maidens and Jade Maiden with Azure Belt all arrive, but do not speak to people. Hence the Eight Histories attend first; you understand human affairs; you should ask the Eight Histories for methods of immortality and long life. The histories record people entering heavenly mansions, inspecting registers, speaking to people. If you lack immortal registration, you are far from immortality. You can only cultivate to attain wealth and honor, prolonging life to three or four hundred years. Merely taking elixirs, gold liquids, and medicines is mistaken from the dao. If you desire longevity, command the Eight Histories to transform, manage the kitchen of myriad things; then you must obtain and place the talismans, keep them in five-colored pouches, hang them by your bed, take vermilion brush to write white and plain talismans of the Eight Trigrams, Mysterious Cavern, Communicating Spirit, Eight Mighty Gods; place before your heart to command them. Always use the five talismans and seals to summon the Eight Histories, preventing their departure. The eight talismans govern authority and command, but cannot grant complete longevity; they only cause stasis. Collect the seals of the humans, each in a leather pouch. Make a bamboo cage shaped like a gourd, storing the twelve humans; cover inside and out with leather; called the Harmonious Rabbit Communicating Spirit Secret Chamber; place it by your bed. At dawn, bow twice and chant: ‘Communicating spirit such and such lord, always commune with great-grandson, wishing to share today’s Jia with you, riding the Azure Dragon, entering and exiting the dark realm. Today’s words are heard by two at the door, guiding the communication safely. When going out, call the direct door communicating spirit such and such lord; do not allow five evil spirits to enter the jade chamber; allow the immortal dao’s bright jade maiden, six Jia gods, to attend; today’s person wears the talisman on their clothes, remembering the talisman and histories when going out; the histories follow the person’s destination. If you desire invisibility and transformation, wear on the left elbow to store histories; then you move unseen among people. If you desire auspicious wonders and strange spells, command people by voice to perform; leave the place; the person speaks and makes sounds; the histories cause the transformations; nothing is impossible.’ This dao once established, myriad things can be recorded; you can see ghosts and spirits; sit and see the eight directions; cause the sun and moon, one dark and one bright; cause five colors to disorder their blue and yellow; cause stars and constellations to change their usual courses; cause the five sacred mountains to revolve in all directions; cause the four seasons to exchange yin and yang; winter produces plants; summer forms ice and frost; cause thunder and lightning to crash and roar; cause clouds and mists to rise and fly. When blessings are complete and disasters removed, if you cultivate this and bow, you become an immortal king. When transformations are complete, all things are connected; the living can be saved; short lives can be lengthened; salvation is endless; compassion protects all beings. Do not lightly harm the myriad people of the world; do not act against the dao; the people fear and pray to Heaven’s gods; the heavenly mansions hold people accountable; the dao departs far away; be cautious. If the histories are not violated for three years, even without immortal registration, the histories will petition for the person’s life, extending it a thousand years. The Immortal Elder said: Diligently establish good deeds; when merit reaches three hundred, life is extended a thousand years. Good deeds mean saving the dying and rescuing lives. No need to command the Six Jia. Learning immortality is about long life and transcendence; saving the world is urgent. Life is limited; always not attending people, always competing with years; perhaps death can be avoided.

The Old Lord said: Wearing the Lingbao Five-Named Talismans entering the purification hall summons the Six Jia yin and yang spirits, likewise according to method, but not together with the Eight Histories. The hundred-day limit and the communicating divine herbs differ. The Six Jia purification method is to wear talismans on seasonal days, completing within one year. The Six Jia are honored in Heaven; the Five Dipper stars are their officials. One thousand two hundred forty days, you should obtain the Six Jia parents, Six Jia communicating spirit chart, communicating spirit talisman, treasure record chart, to summon and command them. The Six Jia parents dwell in mountain divisions corresponding to their mountain yang lands. All mountains have mountain spirits belonging to their sacred mountains; only then can they be used. These parents are also called Ghost Arrows, Ghost Supervisors, and Lone Shakers. Take their roots; the roots have thirteen chiefs; one great chief in the center named Six Jia Parents; twelve chiefs on the four sides atop the twelve earthly branches; those in yang places are Six Jia; those in yin places are Six Ding. Bing, Wu, Geng, Ren follow Jia; Yi, Si, Xin, Gui follow Ding; this is yin and yang pairing. Take their roots, carve as humans according to diagrams; recognize their branches entering the chamber; the central character is the chief, the firm sacred lord; the Six Jia Parents twelve persons each assigned to their branch as Six Jia. On Jia days, offer wine and dried meat. Before the third month third day, take tiger head hair, plant it in the courtyard center, water with sheep’s blood. Then the Six Jia Parents grow, with thirteen plants; below also a chief, its color pure blue, its juice also blue. Take the juice to write the communicating spirit talisman. All writings use this juice. After writing, take the roots, make into powder, in the hall, on the days, take with well water. Take talisman at sunrise, powder at noon, all according to diagrams. After three years, place the five talismans on the four walls of the hall; the Yellow Emperor’s talisman placed on the central beam. After the dao is complete, place all in five-colored pouches in the secret chamber. The Immortal Elder said: When the dao is attained, Heaven, Earth, spirits, the three realms’ great demon kings and officials all come to serve; why trouble to summon them? No need to perform Six Jia rituals. Those seeking immortality ascend the Milky Way, riding dragons as their vanguard.

The Old Lord said: Supreme Lingbao always precedes Heaven and Earth; from the beginning without limit of kalpas. Chaos and naturalness, true dao. In dao it is the dao’s root; in teaching it is the teaching’s origin. The teachings of the Ten Directions all begin with Lingbao. You wear the five talismans; all true persons communicate. Lingbao in the East is the Fragrant Forest Pavilion; its true person named Entering Diligence, style name Reverent Head, governs the Zhen trigram; its spirit character is Jian Gang. Lingbao in the South is the Joyous Forest Pavilion; its true person named Unceasing Diligence, style name Awake Head, governs the Li trigram; its spirit character is Yue Jing. Lingbao in the West is the Splendid Forest Pavilion; its true person named Practicing Diligence, style name Treasure Head, governs the Dui trigram; its spirit character is Tai Xuan. Lingbao in the North is the Head Forest Pavilion; its true person named Moving Diligence, style name Benevolent Head, governs the Kan trigram; its spirit character is Tian Jian. Lingbao in the Northeast is the Lotus Forest Pavilion; its true person named Compassionate Diligence, style name Virtue Head, governs the Gen trigram; its spirit character is Ri Yuan. Lingbao in the Southeast is the Gold Forest Pavilion; its true person named Exhaustive Diligence, style name Eye Head, governs the Xun trigram; its spirit character is Xuan Jing. Lingbao in the Southwest is the Treasure Forest Pavilion; its true person named Supreme Diligence, style name Bright Head, governs the Kun trigram; its spirit character is Zhu Shi. Lingbao in the Northwest is the Vajra Pavilion; its true person named One Realm Diligence, style name Law Head, governs the Qian trigram; its spirit character is Lin Gang. Lingbao above is the Treasure Forest Palace; its true person named Utmost Diligence, style name Worthy Head, governs the Floral Canopy; its spirit character is Eight Essences. Lingbao below is the Water Essence Palace; its true person named Brahman Diligence, style name Wisdom Head, governs the Five Tones Water Mansion; its spirit character is Eight Histories. The Eight Histories are the eight essences of Heaven and Earth, always causing communication with spirits.

Daoists, immortality seekers, and common folk who wish to serve my true dao of the Ten Directions, seeking immortals and long life, must wear Lingbao, first summon the Eight Histories, plant communicating divine herbs in the refined chambers, palaces, and temples, atop the twelve earthly branches, wearing the Lingbao script according to seasonal days. On the fifteenth day of the first month, or the seventh day of the seventh month, make the Lingbao Five-Named Talismans in the refined chambers and palaces, placing them on the four sides and center. Place the talismans strictly inside the refined chambers, on the four walls, and the central talisman on the main beam; all hidden so no common person may see. Burn incense and cultivate the method, reciting the names of the Ten Directions’ Lingbao Supreme True Teachings, chanting the dao scriptures, wishing to remember the high immortals flying to the Tai Chi Mansion’s Eight Histories, characters pure and clean. At the Beginning of Spring, the Northeast Limitless crowd, the Compassionate Diligence True Person Virtue Head, together with the Great Dao True Person Gen Spirit Ri Yuan, all come to open them; your body shines with blue-gold color, as if wearing them, living ten thousand kalpas. At the Spring Equinox, the Eastern Limitless crowd, the Entering Diligence True Person Reverent Head, together with the True Person Zhen Spirit Jian Gang, all come to open them; your body shines blue like indigo, as if wearing them, living twenty thousand kalpas. At the Beginning of Summer, the Southeast Limitless crowd, the Exhaustive Diligence True Person Eye Head, together with the True Person Xun Spirit Xuan Jing, all come to open them; your body shines blue, red, and yellow, as if wearing them, living thirty thousand kalpas. At the Summer Solstice, the Southern Limitless crowd, the Unceasing Diligence True Person Awake Head, together with the True Person Li Spirit Yue Jing, all come to open them; your relic shines red like cinnabar, as if wearing them, living forty thousand kalpas. At the Beginning of Autumn, the Southwest Limitless crowd, the Supreme Diligence True Person Bright Head, together with the True Person Kun Spirit Zhu Shi, all come to open them; your relic shines yellow like gold, as if wearing them, living fifty thousand kalpas. At the Autumn Equinox, the Western Limitless crowd, the Practicing Diligence True Person Treasure Head, together with the True Person Dui Spirit Tai Xuan, all come to open them; your relic shines white like silver, as if wearing them, living sixty thousand kalpas. At the Beginning of Winter, the Northwest Limitless crowd, the One Realm Diligence True Person Law Head, together with the True Person Qian Spirit Lin Gang, all come to open them; your relic shines pale gold, as if wearing them, living seventy thousand kalpas. At the Winter Solstice, the Northern Limitless crowd, the Moving Diligence True Person Benevolent Head, together with the True Person Kan Spirit Tian Jian, all come to open them; your relic shines water-blue, as if wearing them, living eighty thousand kalpas. On the seasonal Wu Ji days, the Upper and Lower Limitless crowds, the Utmost Diligence and Brahman Diligence True Persons Worthy Head and Wisdom Head, together with the True Persons of the Eight Essences and Eight Histories, all come to open them; your body shines blue, red, white, black, and yellow, as if wearing them, merging with the Great Dao’s cavernous unity, eternally limitless. Wearing the talismans for one year, the Ten Directions’ Limitless crowds and all true persons who have attained the dao all come without fail; before the Eight Histories open, your body shines and you meet the true form; immortal dao and long life are accomplished here. Daoists and common folk who cannot cultivate the method and practice the dao, but have these talisman scriptures at home, carve stone to secure and plant seals, their body light naturally comes, causing long life, opening the heart and inner faculties, shining like sun and moon; all diseases are cured; evil spirits, demons, disasters vanish; suitable for officials with great emoluments, wealth like clouds; virtuous men and chaste women; children and grandchildren fill the halls; blessings and virtue tower high.

The Old Lord said: From the Son of Heaven down to commoners, none are originally Daoists; if they have past grace, obtaining my Lingbao scripture, their fate extends naturally. If you wish to use talismans, take five large stones, each pure in color, weighing one hundred jin or more, seventy jin minimum. One pure blue, carved with the Eastern-Named Talisman in vermilion; one pure red, carved with the Southern-Named Talisman in yellow; one pure white, carved with the Western-Named Talisman in black; one pure black, carved with the Northern-Named Talisman in blue; one pure yellow, carved with the Central-Named Talisman in white. Place each with its script to guard the five directions. The Five Phases generate one another without mutual harm; all diseases heal naturally; five evils and six harms, disasters and calamities vanish; officials gain great emoluments; five weapons do not strike; wealth and honor increase daily; money flows like clouds; passed down through generations, life extends endlessly.

Draw the Eight Trigrams Mysterious Cavern Communicating Spirit Eight Mighty Gods talisman on the eight directions; plant communicating divine long-life herbs atop the twelve earthly branches; open the heart; penetrate the four directions; foresee the unforeseen; shining clearly like sun and moon. If traveling by boat or carriage, trading in markets, crossing rivers and lakes, entering seas and rivers, ward off wind, waves, water spirits, poisons, and epidemics; protect body and wealth tenfold; avoid calamities; always meet auspiciousness. Take a bottle shaped like a gourd; take five-colored papers, five-colored brushes; draw spirit talismans inside the bottle; vermilion paint on the outside; make Eight Trigrams Communicating Spirit Eight Mighty Gods talisman. After sacrifice, wrap the bottle with yellow silk cloth, cover its mouth, make a yellow tag on top, seal with yellow silk cord, write “Five Stars Communicating Spirit Protection and Guard Talisman,” stamp with the seal of “Five Stars Communicating Spirit.” Place it in boats or carriages. When traveling far or near, the five sacred mountains, four rivers, five lakes, and three rivers, spirits and essences all come to serve and guard; local land spirits, mountain spirits, beasts, tigers, and wolves all come to pay homage. Upon returning home, place the bottle on the central beam. Those who wish to ward off disasters use five stones to guard the house, all according to this method.

On the day, burn incense; take white blossoms, dry and prepare; wear a square dagger; cause communication with spirits to bring blessings. White blossoms are twenty-four in name: one is the seal’s fourteen persons; one is the seal of clarity; one is the seal of birth; one is the seal of grass; one is the seal of land; one is the communicating spirit of clarity; one is the communicating essence; one is the communicating spirit; one is the jade maiden; one is the household immortal; one is the household treasure; one is the household mushroom; one is the life extension; one is the long-life herb; one is the palace guardian; one is the guardian of the twelve household gods; one is the night caller; one is the night singer; one is the essence bringer; one is yang brightness; one is yin brightness; one is red mushroom; one is white blossom; one is the land’s seal. Twenty-four in all, symbolizing my twenty-four titles, corresponding to Heaven and Earth’s twenty-four qi; the Daoist’s Lingbao use. Talismans are Heaven and Humanity’s fate. If you have predestined fate, obtain my five talismans, together with white blossoms to summon spirit essence; do not lightly reveal to the world. If you recklessly reveal and violate Heaven’s qi, disaster will befall and destroy your body; your ancestors seven generations above and descendants seven generations below will suffer. If spirits inform you to give to those with destined bones, once every fifty-eight years issue to five persons. All must harmonize the five musical notes with their palaces and tones; on the day Heaven meets the Eastern Well star, bathe and enter the chamber; burn incense according to the five directions: three left, seven right, nine front, one back, four center; twenty-four days correspond to Heaven’s twenty-four qi. I am at the center with five stars below, the Five Dipper, the five sacred mountain spirits, all together making the imperial seat; the Five Emperors grant talismans; recipients live long. The seat is two zhang tall, round in the center, all heavy silk mats.

On Jia Yi days, bring three thousand coins to the Eastern land of blessings; place mats and burn incense. On Bing Ding days, bring nine thousand coins to the Southern land of blessings; place mats and burn incense. On Geng Xin days, bring seven thousand coins to the Western land of blessings; place mats and burn incense. On Ren Gui days, bring one thousand coins to the Northern land of blessings; place mats and burn incense. On Wu Ji days, bring four thousand coins to the Central land of blessings, such as city lands; place mats and burn incense. Altogether use twenty-four thousand coins, all prepared by oneself. When burning incense, do not seek or adjust the five musical notes. At Heaven’s Eastern Well star, bathe in orchid water, cleanse the body, purify and abstain before entering the chamber to burn incense. Begin with the East, finishing in twenty-four days. When Heaven’s qi harmonizes, transmit the five musical notes. If you cherish money and recklessly divide or waste, the qi will not harmonize; or if you transmit improperly, Heaven’s qi will not harmonize; five stars will not shine; Five Emperors will not grant; five sacred mountains will not open; five organs will be harmed; disaster will destroy the body. The Immortal Elder said: County Daoists are often poor; now use metal and copper coins as standard; you may transmit the scripture. Disciples prepare incense with sincerity, using it to aid the poor and distressed; no private use. Prepare five combined incense to burn, to manifest utmost sincerity.

The Old Lord said: Lingbao precedes the dao; spirits always rely on it; all heavens, earths, and saints share it as common ancestor. The Mysterious Cavern Communicating Spirit True Talisman, the Three Sovereigns’ Heavenly Script Great Characters, the Cavern True Scripture origin, all correspond to Lingbao. Therefore, first compiled as Five-Named Talismans; others enter Heaven’s qi, hence called Heavenly Characters and Imperial Talismans. They can be used to summon and command Heaven and Earth’s spirits; all first wear Lingbao; only by applying the script do they gain spirits; gaining spirits, they rely on themselves, not bringing disaster to others. Without Lingbao script, how to nurture Heaven’s truth? Be cautious in use; summoned spirits not always rely on you; instead bring disaster to you and harm descendants. Once possessing Lingbao talismans, you must obtain Lingbao charts; charts have twenty-four heads, the true qi of Heaven; my method titles; the true method of the Great Dao. If you desire dao methods, first bathe to remove filth; obtain the Eastern Well chart. If you desire to set the Five Emperors and command mountain spirits, obtain the Five Sacred Mountains chart. If you desire to communicate spirit methods, first decide the Eight Essences; obtain the Eight Histories true form chart. If you desire to communicate the Five Phases and manage the kitchen, obtain the Six Jia communicating spirit chart. If you desire to preserve the Five Teeth and command heavenly gods, obtain the Nine Palaces Purple Chamber chart. If you desire to serve the dao method, obtain the Supreme Clarity chart. If you desire to follow the dao, obtain the Blended Formation chart. If you desire to grasp dao opportunity, obtain the Western Ascension Protection Record chart. If you desire to communicate dao transformations, obtain the Spirit Transformation chart. If you desire to tread the heavenly dao, obtain the Nine Heavens chart. If you desire to shed the body form, obtain the Nine Transformations chart. If you desire to hide and guard the body spirit, obtain the Constant Preservation chart. If you desire to fix the body and guard the spirit treasure, obtain the Containing Shadow chart. If you desire tranquility and guarding unity to preserve the body, obtain the Nourishing Body chart. If you desire silence and darkness to nurture your will, obtain the Sincere Will Guarding chart. If you desire purity and whiteness to obtain mushroom essence, obtain the Mushroom Essence Jade Maiden chart. If you desire to summon Six Ding, obtain the Six Yin Jade Maiden chart. If you desire to obtain immortal records, obtain the Ninety-Nine Immortal Guidance chart. If you desire to consume dao qi, obtain the Guidance chart. If you desire to govern dao arts, obtain the Cavern Grand Treasure chart. If you desire to transform, obtain the Hidden Measure chart. If you desire to refine the furnace and fix the Nine Elixirs and Golden Liquids, obtain the Supreme One chart. If you desire to ascend the Five Sacred Mountains to seek immortal mushrooms and medicines, obtain the Opening Mountain Mushroom Medicine chart. If you desire to protect the body and eliminate evil spirits and demons, obtain the Bright Mirror chart. Once you have the Bright Mirror chart, you should obtain the Containing Mirror chart. In all, twenty-four true charts, my Lingbao. The Cavern Yellow Record chapter, Central Yellow Nine Capitals script, each has secret essential scriptures, my alternate titles. All obtain Lingbao natural talismans as root origin, mutually supporting to form true persons. If you can obtain them, you surely attain long life, lofty high immortals, flying steps to Supreme Clarity, countless kalpas like a moment.

The Yellow Emperor said: Heaven is old and small omens do not yet know Heaven’s qi; thus granted the Lingbao Five-Named Talisman Scripture of Omens. Please observe the Eastern Well prophecy; on pure and auspicious days, bathe and purify to receive the Lingbao talisman. On the tenth day of the first month at the appointed hour; on the eighth day of the second month at dusk; on the sixth day of the third month at sunset; on the fourth day of the fourth month at late afternoon; on the first day of the fifth month at early afternoon; on the twenty-ninth day at late afternoon; on the twenty-seventh day of the sixth month at noon; on the twenty-fifth day of the seventh month at midday; on the twenty-second day of the eighth month at sunrise; on the twentieth day of the ninth month at the third cockcrow; on the eighteenth day of the tenth month at first cockcrow; on the fifteenth day of the eleventh month past midnight; on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month at midnight. These are all Heaven’s qi, monthly mansions, and Eastern Well times, harmonizing with immortals in incense; on these days and times bathe; spirits descend upon you. Bathing in orchid water means Daoists desire to commune with spirits; common folk need not bathe thus. Also, perform the five-stone house-guarding method. According to the *Scripture of Enlightenment*: “Houses with Lingbao never age for ten thousand years; lords with Five-Named Eight Mighty talismans, treasures never decline.” Meaning no further guarding is needed. Must govern the people; those without this scripture only apply it. Also, the *Jade Talisman Record* says: “The five talismans, the five directions’ names, are the true unity of the dao.” Therefore, do not write this scripture’s talismanic script with reverence and place it in the spirit chamber or purification chamber with other scriptures. Let it always be in the tent, also communicating the eight talismans to command the eight directions’ spirits. Imperial talismans are difficult to wear; thus separately sacrifice as receiving them with authority to command eight gods.

The Supreme Supreme True Person said: Those who learn the dao and receive this scripture pass it on once every forty years. Those who have extended life pass it on once every four hundred years. Those who obtain earth immortals pass it on once every four thousand years. Those who obtain heavenly immortals pass it on once every forty thousand years. Those who obtain the unsurpassed cavernous stillness Supreme True pass it on once every forty thousand kalpas. The Supreme Lingbao Great Method’s transmission is complete. This scripture speaks of the high immortal’s path to the void. The Supreme’s vast teaching is expounded; profound and distant words are clear; mysterious truth and subtle meaning cannot be conceived or debated. The Immortal Elder said: Therefore, in all generations, sages have had songs of supreme thought.

The Supreme Mysterious One True Person said: The dao and virtue five thousand characters, the scripture’s utmost profundity, proclaiming the dao’s meaning, the true teaching fully revealed. Radiant and wondrous text. Recite it a thousand days, with empty heart focusing on mystery; by day ascend to immortality, becoming the Supreme Four Splendor True Person. This is the ancestor of high immortals, also able to bring blessings to the Seven Ancestors.

The Immortal Elder said: The five thousand character scripture is magnificent; its subtle profundity defies words. Learners’ hearts do not dwell on glory and wealth, but always remain inside and out; reading this scripture hoping for Heaven’s truth, yet not yet able to see it. Only those of gentlemanly caliber, even if the world knows this text is not falsehood, can expand the subtle words like a lotus born from fire. The essence of the dao is utmost truth; the six supernatural powers are already complete; neither born nor dying; virtue accords with nature; flying and hearing through the void; body emerges from water and fire, yet able to measure people by the dao. Fear the sea water entering pores, the lotus born in fire, yet not speaking of their absence. The scripture warns that the supreme dao is difficult to attain; beginning with a single merit, cultivating steadily as one who walks a thousand miles begins with a single step; one must pass kalpas and accumulate good deeds to naturally meet it.
