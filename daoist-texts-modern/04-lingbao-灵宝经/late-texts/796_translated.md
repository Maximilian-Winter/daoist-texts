### The Great Brahma’s Hidden Speech of Immeasurable Cavernous Chapters, Jade Secrets

The Celestial True Sovereign said: “The ‘Heavenly Book Jade Characters’ condense the flying mysterious qi to form numinous script; they combine the eight assemblies to form sounds, harmonize the five harmonies to form chapters. When the great cycle’s era begins, exquisite gems arise spontaneously; the divine winds play in the void, melodious sounds echo through the caverns, shining brilliantly above the various heavens, radiantly illuminating the profound beyond, transforming together with the Dragon River, unveiling crimson brilliance in the extended health. Refining water and fire through birth and death, enduring through countless kalpas, opening the eight palaces at the hidden nexus, planting numinous light upon the sun, the two principles hold sway to judge, the three illuminations hold sway to divide. The highest sages ride upon it with radiance, the Five Mountains treasure it with numinosity; all who obtain it gain life, the nation’s fortune enjoys peace. Lofty and vast is the grand pattern, majestic and exalted the high reverence; from the midst arises the void, the root of Heaven and Earth. Those who obtain it do not die; those who serve it endure long; those who treasure it truly descend; cultivating it leads to spirit immortals, crossing death’s remains through the long night, refining the living soul within the vermilion palace. The wondrous transformative script emerges from nature itself, mingled yet untainted, clarified yet not pure, destroyed yet indestructible, perishing yet reborn. It is the lofty and elegant progenitor of the myriad emperors of the great void, its majesty and numinosity vast and boundless, difficult to name.”

On the first day of the Jiazi cycle of a certain year and month of the Tai Sui, a certain Mountain True Person, with birth fate certain, born in the month of Jiazi, registered under a certain qi system as the heavenly lord of a certain qi heaven, now within a certain qi heaven, following the master a certain Mountain Master Daoist, receiving the text and wearing it on the body, with seven treasures guarding the spirit, golden ribbons swearing the heart, announcing the spiritual covenant to Heaven, pledging to be a body treasure, revering the great dharma, bowing to the old canon, reporting to the Thirty-Two Heaven Supervisors of the Degree Text, the Attendant Scripture Immortal Gentleman, the Han Registrar, the Flying Heaven True Person, the Three Realms Divine Kings, recording the death register of a certain Jia, engraving the immortal name in the Golden Frame Jade Register of the Three Primal Grades, following the great enclosure’s solemnity, descending the true immortal qi into the body of a certain Jia. The Thirty-Two Heaven Supervisors, Immortal Commanders, Scripture Attendants, each dispatch the qi of Jade Boys and Jade Maidens’ divine truths, each one accompanying the guarding numinous script, bestowed upon the body of a certain Jia, universally linking the various heavens, various lands, the boundless world, sun, moon, stars, the Three Realms officials; the Five Sacred Mountains, famous mountains, Nine Rivers, Water Palaces, Three Officials’ punishment; the Nine Netherworlds, long night springs and streams, invisible and colorless, formless and nameless, soundless and silent, neither great nor small, neither high nor low, neither honored nor humble—all spirits, each clearly recognizing the body of a certain Jia as revering the great dharma, wearing the heavenly script, the name entered into the immortal register of the Three Primal Grades. Entering and exiting, roaming and traveling, following the old reception, one day three times, like the Purple Tenuity Upper Palace, erasing the earthly slips of the Nine Netherworlds’ catalog, extinguishing old roots, gradually ceasing evil ties, no longer subject to capture, countless kalpas without connection, the Seven Ancestors sharing blessings, all ascending, roaming freely in the Mysterious Capital’s Seven Treasures Forest, the soul receiving refining and liberation, occasionally gaining rebirth. A certain Jia pledges to uphold the great dharma, as clearly as the true bright one carefully guarding the body, life and death becoming immortal, befriending the Five Emperors, playing among the various heavens. Should the covenant be broken, the oath betrayed, heavenly script leaked, transmission before the appointed time, life and death denied, long bearing the river source, the wind blade ten thousand kalpas, night suppression mountain, punishment and reward correspond, all as in the covenant text.

The Celestial True Sovereign said: “To receive the degree of the ‘Various Heavens’ Inner Sounds Natural Jade Characters,’ one must follow the clear true canon and pattern, inscribing in vermilion on white silk, carrying the seven treasures, guarding the spirit with golden ribbons, sincerely bowing to the yellow ribbon chapter petition, reporting to the various heavens’ degree texts, exposing it in the central altar for three days and three nights; if no wind or rain occurs, the text does not fly away, harmonizing the truth to transmit.”
