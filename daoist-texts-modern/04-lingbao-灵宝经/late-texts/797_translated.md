#### The Most High Profound Numinous Treasure Eightfold Majesty Summoning Dragon Sublime Scripture — Scroll One

The Primordial Heavenly Worthy said: When the Crimson Brightness first opened, and Chaos first parted, the primal threads flowed and unfolded—this was composed by the Most High. The Dragon River’s deep murk, the crimson characters shining brilliantly, are the natural Heavenly script, subtle and difficult to expound. Dwelling in the profound beyond the profound, it is named the Sea True, the Dragon King Elder. The King of Sea True is the true essence of the sea, positioned within it, covered by stellar energies, thus called the Mysterious Origin. One hundred and eighty numinous seas each hold over ten thousand vast springs; these springs connect to water sacs, surging forth to create thirty-two minor heavens. At that time, destruction was imminent—mountains and seas overturned, the Eightfold Majesty spewed poison, water and fire sought to arise, the sea swirled and revolved, mountains violently collapsed, the Dragon King roamed the ravines, the flood dragons and horned serpents churned the oceans. The Dragon King’s attendants, the Three Officials and various lords, each possessed their own dao, recording and issuing edicts of the Supreme Profound. The Sea True was thrown into chaos across the seas, sealing the cavern gates. The Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy, the Primordial Most High Perfected Person, summoned the Eightfold Majesty to subdue the Dragon King. The crimson jade formula contains writings to transcend life and death, to awaken the crawling myriad beings, revealing precious secrets to avert calamities and disasters, to be practiced for a thousand days. On the yearly days of the Rat, Zi, and Wu, one burns incense and turns the scripture, calling upon the Eightfold Majesty and the Dragon King Elder. Hearing the scripture, they rejoice, bowing their heads and closing their eyes. Those who receive the summoning scripture will not encounter calamities. At the eight seasonal festivals, ascending the mountains, casting into the abyss through the four seasons, when great and small kalpas arrive, one casts talismans into the ford; the Dragon King respectfully receives and welcomes them, the Bird Mother guides and escorts them, ascending to the Jade Capital, presenting before the Jade Emperor.

The Primordial Heavenly Worthy said: The thirty-two heavens contain one hundred and eighty seas, and also thirty-two water sacs of mountain seas. The Dragon King Elder roams and observes within the seas, mountains, caverns, and abysses, seeing those who can be saved, those who can become immortals, composing and creating the *Eightfold Majesty Summoning Dragon Dragon King Repelling Flood and Extinguishing Flame Sublime Scripture*. Constantly practicing these arts, one naturally attains longevity and corpse liberation, escaping the ten sufferings and eight hardships, rescuing the seven ancestors, ascending to the Southern Official’s Vermilion Mound Forest, naturally sustaining on air and essence, the corpse returning to spirit.

The Primordial Heavenly Worthy, through the Most High Profound Degree Perfected Person, summons on the eight seasonal days to ascend mountains and summon the Dragon King Elders of the seas, reciting the eight contracts, summoning texts, and talismans.

Used according to the season: On the day of the Beginning of Spring, use a nine-inch length of blue silk ribbon, inscribe in cinnabar the names of prefectures, counties, villages, and the years, sealing the name of the master, so-and-so Jia, wearing the three sections of the Eightfold Scenes; the heavenly immortals and earthly numinous beings always dwell within the body. Pray that on this Beginning of Spring festival, the name Tai Xuan be proclaimed, erasing the death register, severing the root of sin.

On the Beginning of Spring day, recite the four-directional chant; the summoning text is as before:

“Alas, Dragon River Venerable, brave and fierce high divine king. Spirits of the cavernous abyss, summon the Dragon King Lord. Demon King Elder Master, Primordial and Primordial Sacred Spirit.

Commanding majesty restrains the eight poisons, extinguishing floods, halting fiery smoke. Free and wandering in void and nothingness, the body born of water, fire, and light. The great cycle opens the path of salvation, kalpas become but one lifespan.”

On the Spring Equinox day, recite, along with summoning text and talisman, using the method above:

“The abyss connects to the Dragon Arrival Venerable, water mother bears the flying clouds. All empty spiritual mountains sink, vast and empty with none remaining. The crimson town cuts off the jar ridge, the eastern well conceals the splendid ford.

Mysterious harmony of jade maidens, numinous consorts and six celestial beings. The empty cavern admits no worthy, the numinous sovereign returns to the nine mysteries. Diligently revering the high morning work, thus one attains the revered dao.”

On the Beginning of Summer day, summoning text uses an eight-inch crimson ribbon, inscribed in cinnabar as above:

“The crimson bright jade characters arise, great subtlety of Ju Yu Luo. Upright light wears cloud scenes, handsome but not many. Transforming and roaming among the people’s path, who is the true home of utmost truth?

Pray to escape the five hardships, command and summon the heavenly demons. The Dragon King bears the talisman and emerges, all seas become dust and sand. The numinous mountain does not collapse, the blessed land further refines the embryo.”

On the Summer Solstice day, summoning text uses an eight-inch crimson ribbon, inscribed as above:

“The empty sovereign bears numinous flight, the great firmament ascends the nine mysteries. Wind and cloud conceal subtlety, reciting the five mountain artisans. Blessed lands lie in river valleys, numinous mountains hold caverns still.

Immortal mushrooms, many wondrous medicines, refined and ingested, generating radiant light. Distributed among the treasure gardens, pearls and jade guard the numinous treasury. Clamshell essence and colored glaze, amber and diamond mirrors.”

On the Beginning of Autumn day, summoning text uses a six-inch white plain ribbon, inscribed as above:

“Bright and shining, the Great White Star, towering steep and rugged peaks. The Dragon King cleaves the heavenly river, all seas unite at once. Thirty-two heavenly truths, each wears the majesty of the Dragon Scripture.

After passing the Dragon River, scholars ascend the Jade Clarity. Observing the path, spitting poison and hunting, rinsing fragrance, washing the crown and tassels. Vast and boundless cliffs, remote and grand numinous.”

On the Autumn Equinox day, summoning text uses a six-inch white plain ribbon, inscribed as above:

“Kalpa cycles and heavens intersect, the great image no longer born. Ten directions’ numinous treasure venerate, concluding with the perfected human form. Three caverns uphold the primordial dao, the true and subtle Most High scripture.

Those who wear it enter the void, chanting all in supreme purity. The dao is the true central veneration, to transcend unending lifespans. The utmost truth returns to non-being, disciples cultivate and ascend the Upper Clarity.”

On the Beginning of Winter day, summoning text uses a five-inch black silk ribbon, inscribed as above:

“Numinous birds stir the Dragon River, phoenix and horned dragon no longer descend. Blessed head dwells in the Three Terraces, titled true compassion and forgetfulness. Numinous mountain reaches the scholar, wearing the scroll consulting the master artisan.

Holding it to roam in joy, dispelling demons, chanting the bright mirror. Three origins, Primordial Ancestral Sect, composing the Dragon King summons. Eightfold majesty disperses poisonous vapors, all seas calm and tranquil.”

On the Winter Solstice day, summoning text uses a five-inch black silk ribbon, inscribed as above:

“Great brightness illuminates the ten directions, all heavens threaten collapse. Numinous karma, great vehicle sect, seas stir vast floods. Ascending to the Jade Capital’s foundation, descending to abyssal cavern villages.

Creeping, flying, stirring beings, all follow the path. Multitudes of demons are bound, receiving admonition to cultivate the treasure scripture. Revolving cycles transform naturally, bodies take infinite forms.”

The above eight seasonal recitations are each to be performed according to their season.

Four Seasons Summoning Text Method:

On the four seasonal days—Spring Jia Yin, Summer Jia Wu, Autumn Jia Shen, Winter Jia Zi—cast into water slips, using one golden dragon mouth and two blue-green pearls. Westward flowing water is the source of the numinous seas. Facing true north, recite the contracts thrice, linking with dragon pearls, placing vermilion script and blue silk in the water. Further exhort the one hundred and eighty numinous seas’ great true Eightfold Majesty not to release poison; the Dragon King bears the talisman, and thus the summons resounds. If no form is seen, this water itself has strange sounds and surging waves—that is the numinous. One should cultivate this for thirty-two years; the Eightfold Majesty will receive and welcome, the Dragon King will guide.

Repeated Edict for Summoning Text Ritual:

The Lords of the Three Primes—Great Profound, Great Elemental, Great Subtle—Primordial Most High Perfected, Supreme Illustrious Master, Mysterious Jade Maiden, Numinous Consort Lady, so-and-so Jia first sealed so-and-so Sea God King to guard the abyssal passage from flood and water disasters. Now, on such and such day, present the charge of the golden dragon and blue-green pearls, to the fragile ancestor, petitioning to enter the imperial register, erasing the root of death.

On the four seasonal days, cast water slips, red script on blue paper, facing north, reciting four contracts in Brahma’s voice.

Praise to the Lords of Great Profound, Great Elemental, Great Subtle — First

“The Most High Profound text, Three Primes Numinous Treasure truth. Primordial exhales jade formula, this is the ancient speech. Eightfold Majesty from poisonous vapors, exterminates demons and worldly dust.

True dao has empty caverns, lofty and subtle primordial qi revered. In a blink passing six degrees, soaring body joins the Supreme Profound. One hundred and eighty seas boil, Dragon River opens flood gates.

Abyss connects to all river heads, human and bird, numinous mountain roots. Horned beasts, flood dragons, whales brave, vastly guarding cavernous script. Observing and learning immortal guests, paths release fiery smoke.

Urging the dense ritual threads, gathering and binding the morning. Yang light no longer bright, yin essence no longer clear. One hundred and six yang ends, great and small kalpas reborn.”

Praise to the Three Primes — Second

“Eightfold Majesty Dragon King Spirit, dwelling in the world without surname or birth. From qi exhales eight poisons, untranscended no dao person. Foolish beings not purged, all gather in the five suffering courts.

Corpses lie across lands, white bones exposed on roads. Numinous mountains full of vulgar filth, all are ministers of sorrow. While alive, no scripture cultivation, hearing the dao but not consuming it.

Diligently strive to destroy foolish beings, creeping and flying myriad lives. Past lives suffer this retribution, now pray to escape sin’s name.”

Praise to the Primordial Most High Perfected — Third

“Vast Dragon River abode, hazy numinous mountain dark. Boundless heavenly palaces, chaos’ primal qi born. Silent secluded cavern palace, towering numinous true court.

Floating high immortal adept, clear and upright original work inscription. Dragon scales dwell in abyssal sources, tiger and leopard hide in gathered fields. Not seeing the master who attains, still hearing petty sounds.

Hungry swallowing primordial qi, thirsty drinking mysterious jade essence. Holding and nourishing withered bones and form, to transcend unending lifespan.”

Praise to the Supreme Illustrious Master — Fourth

“Vast and deep, the palace of the abyss, reciting and releasing vast boundlessness. The constellations all fall at once, stars transform into wanderers. Forbidden primal roots wild and dense, Emperor Ding has no foundation.

Rising and falling follow fate’s turning, scorched and withered each in its time. At dawn, nothing is fulfilled, ten thousand kalpas come again. Human flesh suddenly perishes, ultimate law punishes disasters.

Returning and migrating the path of the empty sovereign, a hundred million years is but a moment. Wearing the Eightfold Majesty talisman, to dispel the eight elemental disasters.”

The Primordial Heavenly Worthy, together with the Dragon King Elder, the Dragon River’s true beings, the Eightfold Majesty guiding, dragon scales, tiger and leopard, lion dispelling evil, horned dragons and phoenixes, swans and cranes, all gathered at the Nanyang Cavern Terrace’s Seven Treasure Palace, gazing upon the vast cliff. At that time, the Clear Void Tranquil Heavenly Worthy performed the summoning of the Eightfold Majesty Dragon Scripture, talisman texts, talisman diagrams, and praises, imparting to the unenlightened, clarifying the secret methods, receiving the transmission of precious jade, secret upon secret, lightly revealed to avoid destruction of the body.

#### The Most High Profound Numinous Treasure Eightfold Majesty Summoning Dragon Sublime Scripture — Scroll Two

The Great Dao Lord said: The Most High Primordial Lord and Supreme Sovereign Infinite Great Emperor Lord roamed the Kunlun Jade Capital mountains, also with Wonderful Conduct Perfected Person, Supreme True Lord, Supreme True Elder, from the Five Mountains and Four Rivers, each with two thousand four hundred immortal truths, all descended to roam. Then the Sovereign invited the Heavenly Emperor, Earth Emperor, and Human Emperor Lords, all descending to Mysterious Capital Mountain, officials surrounding the palace, listening to the expounding and spreading of the teachings. At that time there was the Dragon Abyss Elder, called Dragon Lord, who rode with tens of thousands of dragons, coming to the Three Sovereigns and Great Emperor Lords, listening to the good teachings and performing merit deeds. They sighed: “The supreme dao virtue, originally self-respecting, void and without peer, the great vehicle one hundred and six cycles of boundless transformation, encouraging goodness, spreading salvation from life and death, diligently guiding.” Also, there are nine thousand six hundred billion true dao, accumulating merits and virtues beyond count, using dao transformation to teach and guide life laws, wielding expedient means, universally rescuing all evil and death roots. Humans practice the four benevolent hearts, saving those harmed by calamity; Heaven and Earth wither, people wail. The Dragon Lord again transforms, leading tens of millions of dragons beyond the Western River deserts, in the boundless Yu Abyss land, bearing water and riding clouds, spreading throughout the world, universally receiving the great flood’s moistening. The Five Mountains and Four Rivers’ gods all raise clouds and nets, shading Heaven and covering Earth, saving the world’s drought and thirst. Within days, water and land are universally moistened and flowing, rivers and valleys filled, vast and mighty. At that time, the heavens sent two hundred and forty thousand colored maidens, leading and following the Most High Supreme Infinite Great Emperor Lord, coming down from Heaven, composing songs and dances, roaming within the four seas, celebrating the heavenly people receiving joy. The nation’s mandate is peaceful, all under Heaven rejoice and dance, voices harmonize. At that time, the Great Dao Lord, Dao Virtue Lord, and Great Emperor Lord, the three supreme true divine persons, high sage Wonderful Conduct Perfected Person, Heavenly Emperor Supreme Sovereign, myriad millions of beings came to respectfully serve. Golden boys and jade maidens, hundreds of millions, holding incense and flowers, coming down from Heaven, attending the three supreme and four true, Most High, Infinite, Primordial Lords, Great Emperor Supreme Lords, golden boys and jade maidens, incense and jade maidens, singing and chanting harmoniously, together with the myriad millions of gods on Earth, and tens of millions of colored maidens, all advancing before the Great Emperor’s three thrones, kneeling long and solemn.

At that time, the Dragon Lord again brought tens of millions of dragons to prostrate before the Great Emperor. After a long while, the Dragon Lord reported to the Great Emperor: “The three lords have acknowledged the creation of the Three Sovereigns since the beginning, never encountering the Yang Nine Hundred and Six cycles. Now after the flood’s dryness, nine thousand nine hundred years, the dry sun hides the abyss, water mother flees and hides. Thus the dry sun conceals the light beneath the nine springs, the fiery barrier rises within the eight extremes. The myriad people dry and exhausted, wailing to Heaven, petitioning and lamenting. The dead from dryness, more than half the world’s three parts, scorched and nearly consumed. After three years, all evil and rebels perish. Also, the Dragon Lord was summoned to command Yu Abyss, ordering the Dragon Lord to lead tens of millions of dragons to perform the heavenly net, bearing water and sprinkling moisture. Within a ten-day month, all dried dead are revived. In the land, only one tenth of the people remain as seed. When asked why they alone survive, the seed people say: ‘Because we endure dryness without perishing, truly receiving the Three Officials’ investigation, ancestors accumulated good merits, family fame and rank. Also, one’s own cultivation of the body, seldom erring, accumulating diligent virtue, protected by the Heavenly Official, nurtured by the Earth Spirit. Thus, these cultivators belong among the partial immortals, singled out and distinguished. When expelling the initial fire refining, the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water examine ancestral merits, covering oneself, merits and diligence evident, Southern Palace’s remaining name, when disasters come, thrice reported. The Southern Mountain Lord fiery barrier envoy sees all saving grace, also petitions the Heavenly Emperor fire pearl envoy, flowing fire flying refining golden true tiger talisman, Supreme One Vajra brilliant treasure seal, guiding the light spirit true phoenix talisman to guard, sprinkling and brushing, thus obtaining fiery flight. Immortals and sages with golden-mouthed great birds come to save, escaping disaster and attaining rebirth and awakening, results of accumulated good deeds and benevolent favor. One must not be negligent in fasting and rectitude.’ The Dragon Lord said: ‘The merit of accumulated good deeds all comes from the dao. Those who wish to build merit and virtue should follow the Most High Numinous True Three Treasures fasting, accumulating years and months, practicing tirelessly. The Life Controller reports good merits to Heaven, the Heavenly Emperor’s office records merit and achievement, the Three Officials record deeds, overcoming three disasters and five hardships to obtain liberation. Fasting merit is especially weighty, can one not be diligent? The root of life is fixed.’ Now composed as the Most High Eightfold Majesty Summoning Dragon Scripture, performing the dragon invocation in the upper chapter, recording the root origin in the lower scroll.

The Great Dao Lord said on the turning of fortune and peace, from dryness comes flourishing song, thus spoke the hymn:

“Vast Dragon Lord, receiving Heaven’s supreme spirit. Encountering the Yang Nine, one hundred and six’s tipping. Myriad people scorched and dried, thirsty dying in abyssal court. Looking up to Heaven, crying and sighing, seeking pity for disaster’s sorrow.

Knocking and pleading, sorrowful calling, troubling the luminous true. Heaven responds, calling the Dragon King. The dragon host flees body, hiding light and shape. Concealed and closed in Yu Abyss, cliff stone grindstone.

Eightfold Majesty sternly commands, ordering summons combined. If any Dragon Lord, bearing five stars. Pointing and knocking Yu Abyss, dragon host flies and cries. Rectifying and guarding tens of millions, receiving and bearing merit and fame.

Gathering and restraining rain masters, cloud nets over Jade Capital. Three days and three nights, sprinkling abyss pure and still. Crops abundant and flourishing, myriad people receive life. Four seasons harmonized and adjusted, all prosperous, peaceful and safe.”

The Great Dao Lord said: “Praise the Dragon Lord’s great merit, his virtue is lofty indeed. The speaker has practiced, clearly has the five precept texts, as follows:

‘Teach and guide with much compassion, Heaven’s dao opens the dark. Protect and relieve suffering, merit flows to later generations. Dao does not betray human effort, suffering comes from lack of endeavor.

Why then does fortune come carved, good men’s hearts are fickle? Diligently encourage cultivation of good, surpassing disaster’s cruel grasp. Dragon majesty’s merit is great, grace benefits Heaven’s spirit.

Saving and reviving all under Heaven, none do not receive blessing and honor. Yang Nine already exempt, one hundred and six also pacified. Dry evil is sprinkled and moistened, vexing turbidity becomes clear.

Eightfold Majesty command talisman, treasure seal and imperial jade. All are poison restraining talismans, majesty diminishes hunting demons. Dragon King casts by riverbank, dragon host emerges with fearful cries.

Accumulated goodness brings myriad blessings, long fasting praises sound. None but come from good, majesty reaches the upper spirit. Blessings fall like heavenly thunder, deaf and sick all hear.

Blind open their sight, lame rise and walk. Good aided by spirits, evil punished by ghost thieves. Dao is founded on goodness, virtue is bright with faith.

Compassion and filial piety loved by Heaven, diligent dao life does not falter.’”

The Dao Lord said: “The Dragon Lord’s merit is weighty and great, truly worthy of ‘good, good’ praise, it is the heavenly heart of past merits, all are moved. How much more so the divine true Supreme True’s teaching of precepts’ beauty. The Dao Lord spoke to the Dragon Lord: ‘You inherit past lives, merits already manifest, thus for all kindness. And recent toil and diligence, among the Three Treasures, merit’s expression. Listen carefully to my precepts, ponder my words, you shall further widely proclaim the Great Dao Primordial’s law. These words are most essential, fitting the infinite good practices to cultivate.’

The Dragon Lord said: ‘What is the great good practice? I wish to hear and listen, then receive the precepts again, proclaiming to the Ten Directions, urging advancement of good hearts, so as not to grow weary.’ Then the Most High Great Dao Lord answered the Dragon Lord: ‘There is also a method: those who act as good daoists, possessing complete appearance, receiving the precious scriptures of the dao true persons. The Three Sovereigns Cavern True Persons have Supreme True Great Precept cinnabar slips and ink talismans, and Three Sovereigns Jade Clarity hidden books, Three Sovereigns characters, Supreme Clarity cinnabar scriptures, flying stone hidden forms, numinous subtle child cinnabar secret arts, also their truth. The dao’s subtle truth is recorded in Heaven and Earth’s primal register, its words clear. The essentials of flying immortals are utmost and weighty, can one not be diligent? Good cultivation and mindfulness. The words of the supreme dao are the foundation of utmost faith. Great goodness is lofty, restraining the small vehicle’s methods, ought to be forbidden and limited. There should be moderation. Where moderation stops, there is majesty. The great vehicle’s practice observes all, all beings’ Three Treasures merit, enabling gradual progress. The Dragon Lord has past merits and good deeds, with a separate thirty-three precepts, inheriting the thirty-two heavens’ rites. The precepts all encourage the beginning of goodness. Furthermore, there are sixteen matters to advance wisdom, manifesting broad benevolence and diligent spreading. What are the sixteen wisdom advances? Giving and good deeds in multitude, all complete as true, precepts without flaw, patience not to be called patience, fruit of supreme diligence reaching stability, all practices complete, wisdom, feeling, faith, all practice sufficient, serving as dao, roaming the quiet joyful gate, equipped with six virtuous methods, the greatest ten goods. Adorning body, mouth, and mind with virtue and conduct, knowing contentment and joy in stillness, three self-encouragements, cultivating internal and external goodness, urging all virtues, also cultivating the sixteen practices. One should receive auspicious blessings, manifest great wisdom heart, reward merits in the Great Dao world. Giving, spreading, and wisdom flow to later generations. Again, the Dragon Lord has good wisdom heart’s twenty-two matters, also removing wrong path thoughts, preserving great vehicle aspirations, lofty and pure. The Supreme Clarity removes impurities, suppresses vulgar customs, does not speak of mixed matters, does not act unlawfully, discards evil, holds wisdom, cultivates good laws, their dao is connected, their dao is great. The Dragon Lord’s majesty is already restrained, already entered the great vehicle, how much more so the Most High! The Dragon Lord further practices twenty-two matters, can advance wisdom leaps, can trust and obey the heart, cannot be under demon officials and evil vulgar external daoists, descending and repelling them. What is the meaning of leaping beyond ordinary hearts? My heart’s will is fierce and steady, words guarded and firm, strong practice not falling, heart never weary. The leap is like Heaven and Earth’s majesty, divine majesty, ghost majesty, vulgar majesty, false majesty, poison majesty, hunting majesty, non-majesty, non-thing majesty, Eightfold Majesty talisman, thus having images. Majesty is like great vajra’s firm practice. The dao says: The Dragon Lord True Person has twenty-two leap methods, able to have majesty, never causing violent leap practice, bringing universal wisdom heart. All demons and demon external evil external daoists dare not escape the Dragon Lord’s leap control. The dao does not act in vain, thus there are rules and rites.’

The Dao said: ‘When rivers and seas raise waves, the sun scorches and withers, the great flood gathers the four quarters, raising clouds and making rain. The still wind ceases flow, commanding dragon life true, when majesty shakes, the dragon host startles and flies, clouds stop, fog gathers, clearing and opening the universe, moistening drought and withered trees, five fragrances spread in the courtyard, the great dao great brightness. Great good practice, truly good indeed.’

The Great Dao Lord said: ‘The Dragon Lord True Person also already exercises majesty, recording summons of the dragon host. At that time, one must first sacrifice and toil the great Dragon King, offering to the river gods, wind elders, and rain masters, also blessing the dragon, chanting to the river master water god Yu Abyss envoy, thrice blessing and wishing, fasting three days, standing by rivers and streams and chanting this upper chapter alliance text. When sacrificing and swearing to seek the dragon’s command, one also reverently serves the river master, Five Mountains, and Four Rivers gods. It can be said that Heaven’s qi descends, Earth’s qi rises, the great flood flows, yin and yang combine virtue, the two principles respond, the four seasons follow accordingly. The Five Mountains bow, the Four Seas unite, river gods command dragons, Yu Abyss caverns overflow, eight gates open, thus the dao is accomplished, great is the merit.’

The Great Primordial True Person Dragon Lord said: ‘Already received the four seasonal sprinkling command dragon method, yet not seen the five brightness transformations. What are the five brightness? One is the upper cavern desireless brightness, two is the brightness of self and other heart will, three is the brightness of five attainments and nine harmonies, four is the brightness of wisdom responding to opportunity, five is the brightness of distant sight of the Ten Directions, clear and unhindered—this is the five brightness caverns. The illumination of five brightness, above receiving the Three Sovereigns Five Stars essence, next receiving the Five Mountains Four Rivers spirits, then receiving the five fragrant mushroom flower brightness. The five fragrant brightness, beyond seas and foreign lands, one plant with five roots, one stem with five branches, one branch with five leaves, one interval with five sections, five fives correspond. Thus immortals name it. The five fragrant wood, burning for ten days, reaches the Nine Emperors’ heaven, possessing great compassion heart, virtue transforming saint.’

The Great Dao Lord further told the Dragon Lord: ‘To proclaim and transform good methods, if there are those who delight in cultivating fasting and seeking dao, with sincere faith, able to cultivate the essential dao, then one may universally bestow it, to clarify the divine transformation of the law, so later sages have clear and unbroken good meaning.’ Then the Dragon Lord received the command, rode the dragon flying to gather at Yu Abyss Dragon Pool, leading and commanding the dragon host to descend to the various countries, universally causing all places needing water and drought relief to follow the upper chapter scripture’s oath and ritual to the water officials and river gods, then the Dragon Abyss Elder opens the pool clouds, ascending bearing water to sprinkle and moisten.

The Great Dao Lord said: ‘Command the True Person Dragon Lord to act timely, not at untimely needs, following the usual self-supply, giving to heavenly immortals, flying immortals, officials and attendants, each given their usual heavenly official feather instruments, not requesting rain water at untimely times, wishing to fast and turn the Dragon King scripture upper and lower chapters. Making the sound and breath sorrowful and urgent, chanting into the river’s flow, each seven times. Next the ritual master praises and chants Brahma’s good songs, all causing the river gods to be moved, the dragon host sorrowful and urgent, suddenly appearing red-bodied, descending in form at east and west directions. Three days’ response arrives, then daylight shines and night is bright, communicating the clear response.’

The Great Dao Lord again commanded the Dragon Lord True Person: ‘If fasting is to be done, encountering great drought, dust rising everywhere, accumulating months and days, the intense sun not moistening, then one should command the Dragon Lord to summon and request rain. Following the upper chapter alliance scripture, recite the lower chapter seven times, sorrowful and beautiful, the heavenly true Dragon Lord suddenly rides the dragon and descends. According to the above, chant the upper and lower chapters, one day and one night, each seven times. Sacrificing and swearing to river gods and Dragon Lord to dispatch the dragon host flying into the four seas and rivers, flying down and ascending bearing water, roaming and spreading through the heavens, great flood pouring for three days, rain sprinkling for three nights. First arrange incense lamps, weaving day and night, then the rain comes blowing and calling immediately, truly added by the true, countless branches, layered and magnificent. The saintly king’s virtue and conduct, great goodness ascending, transforming and changing beyond the ordinary, commanding summons is very difficult. When affairs complete, quickly dispatch, this Dragon Lord’s divine transformation clear and pure sprinkling response, if not the utmost refined national lord, how could this descent be brought? Vast and level, not arrogant nor proud.’

The Dao True Most High said: ‘Also there are four grades of great merit in practicing goodness. What are the four practices? The dao says: If one cultivates purity and stillness, that is the first practice. To extend one’s will and dao heart, that is the second. To benevolently transform beings and succeed, that is the third. To build merit and expediently save myriad lives, that is the fourth. Those who cultivate the four equal merits, what is this? The Dragon Lord True Person said: ‘There are eight direct practices, such as practicing the Eightfold Majesty command summons, all from the heart of true dao and equal merit. As for unlawful matters, thus not allowing already good sages to see unlawful precepts. When entering, one must clearly proclaim, proclaiming goodness not universally, each by Brahma master not informing disciples and masters’ fault. The master’s responsibility.’

The True Person Dragon Lord said: ‘I also hear the dao has Three Realms. What are the Three Realms? Diligently cultivating virtue, in void and nothingness one should act, in the formless realm already completely pure, attaining pure self nature and life, also able to cross the dharma realm. The dharma realm is pure, thus the number realms are pure, the number realms are pure, thus the countless realms are pure, the countless realms strive, thus attaining the Three Realms pure. The Three Realms pure, thus the eye consciousness realm pure, the eye consciousness realm pure, thus the mind consciousness realm pure, the mind consciousness realm pure, thus attaining the empty realm pure, the empty realm pure, thus all dharma realms pure. Because of this purity, all dharmas are pure, like emptiness and emptiness pure, thus beings are pure with all purity, thus beings guard with all purity, thus there is no other, also not attached to two or no-two purity, thus the dao is pure, thus speaking of purity as the supreme dao.’

The True Person Dragon Lord further said: ‘The dao says also no, all thoughts also do not think dao, all thoughts are pure, like ascending to the supreme stillness there, forever no so-called no gate. Thoughts should have no thought, no thought of dao, also no consciousness thought, its dao all none, entering the dark dark. Practicing this no thought, no thought dao is the utmost truth. If the Dragon Lord True Person wishes to practice this dao pure intention, one should clearly understand pure practice, also cause body, mouth, and mind pure practice to generate and receive qi. From the void arises mystery and reception, called the birth dao, the root of dao.’

The True Person Dragon Lord said: ‘What is meant by body practice utmost? The dao says: Body practice comes and goes life law, coming without end law, present scene law, ending without end law. That which is without end is called body practice. Also, body law depends on conditions assembling. When conditions age, then emptiness without thought, calm and no thought. Such subtlety, Dragon Lord now wishes to model it, observing body as such dao, one cannot but diligently strive, thus attaining true dao.’

The Great Dao Lord said: ‘Dragon Lord True Person, if riding this pure heart, born in the desire realm, yet in the form realm with the heavens, among myriad Brahmas, quiet and advancing without agitation, this is Dragon Lord True Person able to transform and guide with authority with the heavenly gods. Or born in the form realm yet desire realm appears and has form. Also with the heavens and mindful beings interacting, sitting and rising without awareness, having toil and brushing laziness, beings of virtue also do not despise themselves. They use this practice of pure concentration, correct heart receiving it, in the upper dao none do not fly in the profound void.’

The Great Dao Lord said: ‘The True Person already completely unites with natural practice, holding pure and still body, the practitioner is truly great. Having fixed the body, further not following stopping to fix arising, thus having advancing and retreating heart, not receiving the true called. It is like the beginning of the Most High True Person’s teaching, also having good expedient means. If the daoist aspires to learn and understand purity, flying and transforming without form, can be called diligent cultivation, the dao does not betray man.’

The Great Dao Lord said: ‘I also hear the Dragon Lord True Person’s teaching beginning, seeking dao without practice, not practicing and imagining dao practice. Thus one can know the dao practice. Also not practicing the hope for dao practice, also fundamentally not seeking practice understanding. Or from bone law already penetrating this origin. Not practicing what arises, hoping toward dao practice non-practice, transcendence also no understanding of death and life dao. Practice and non-practice, holding thought always in dao, is not it clear? Dao will be clear.’

The Supreme Dao says: ‘Turning the void true three cavern dharma wheel, countless dragon scriptures, also draft dragons joyfully leaping.’ The Dragon Lord again said:

‘True dao is not far, three five again returns. Clear and bright awaiting signs, seeking rain summoning dragon. Dragon Lord once descends, howling and roaring. Sprinkling moistening drought seedlings, what is requested is not balanced. Yu Abyss river official, Five Mountains high peaks. Expounding dao teaching, only goodness is loyalty. Filial piety and compassion flourishing, under Heaven none equal. Moderation and law created, or awaken by dragon. Dragon Lord once descends, none not upright. Command talisman summon truth, also obtain demon king. Ten thousand ghosts perish light, spirit god bends body. Sever five paths, ascend and raise high peaks. Also issue fasting texts, teaching and guiding children. Flowing water golden talisman, brilliant treasure seal. Left bearing six jia, right wearing seal. Only mind three truths, holding in heart and chest. Aspiring dao diligent fasting, why ask to fly in void. Flying void dao long, long teaching calmly.’

The dao says: ‘If not practicing to obtain, why suddenly practice imagining. Seeking dao returning to emptiness and nothingness, at times must establish form image. Suffering people’s will not firm, thus arising following form. Not delighting in seeking dao practice, expelling all filth and ruin. True dao all without practice, pure and yet no demons. If there arises practice, sincere and wondrous can be constant. Dao says no self thought, self thought absolutely no shadow. Absolute thought comes from void, void comes with real birth. If you can cultivate good transformation, good transformation attains true spirit. Who knows true dao’s value, golden elixir in your form. Nourishing and raising beneath mysterious yong, lifespan extended and long. Why pursue short life, unwilling to shed primordial essence. Primordial essence is very easy to know, safely residing in mysterious city. Occasionally opening beneath sun and moon, ringing bells gathering officials and soldiers. Who can understand and awaken, in thought the three prime courts. Not understanding seeking my dao, instead punished by disaster. Body destroyed by knife mountain peak, disgraced and ruined dao name. Why not cultivate fasting and rectitude, for ten thousand years exempt from drifting. Only worry merit not accumulated, not worry accumulated not complete. Great dao not false words, fear you cast sin and blame. Thus opening three cavern treasure, urging you to nurture longevity and peace. Crossing over five hardships suffering, immortal flying to imperial court. I and you mutually know, who knows truly to listen.’

The Dragon Lord True Person said: ‘I received the Most High Great Emperor’s dao, personally receiving the utmost true and correct law, diligently cultivating fasting and rectitude, diminishing self and giving charity. You wish to save your body, you must first save others. You wish to complete your body, you must first complete others. You wish to honor yourself, you must first honor others. You wish to respect yourself, you must first respect others. You wish to establish yourself, you must first establish others. You wish to humble yourself, you must first humble others. You wish to teach yourself, you must first teach others. You wish to manage yourself, you must first manage others. You wish to aid yourself, you must first aid others. You wish to reach yourself, you must first reach others. You wish to communicate yourself, you must first communicate with others. You wish to enjoy yourself, you must first enjoy others. You wish to be full yourself, you must first fill others. You wish to be generous yourself, you must first be generous to others. You wish to be first yourself, you must first let others be first. You wish to govern yourself, you must first govern others. You wish to be settled yourself, you must first settle others. You wish to be compassionate yourself, you must first be compassionate to others. You wish to be filial yourself, you must first be filial to others. Humble and diligent body, gentle countenance, morning and evening respectfully serve me, see others respect elders, respect as I respect elders, heart holds and mouth recites dao, always willing to bow and serve diligently, changing taste to sweetness and progress, never leaving morning and evening, cold ice not first clothing, should first clothe elders. Practicing these eighteen goodnesses, should reach Heaven. Having wealth not hoarding, opening granaries to benefit the poor, yearly giving thousands of bushels, all to rescue the needy. The Dragon Lord once practiced this, moved and awakened in Heaven, Heaven demands loyalty and filial piety, at life’s end granted extension, extended tenfold, life past dragons come to welcome. Accumulated goodness and filial piety cause this, compassionate heart much benefiting the poor, dragon pride truly difficult to bear, bowing to him as Dragon Lord. Ascending and descending at will, roaming and chanting wherever. Also transforming and separately appearing forms, changing shapes and all communicating. Also teaching the multitude, warning and awakening later students, practicing much compassion. Seeing the virtuous none not respectful, supreme sage supplementing true person, just beginning to transform the world. Merit complete roaming the four seas, Five Mountains all around. Obtaining immortal dao legacy name, practice accumulated for later generations, transforming and awakening later sages. In the world’s end many disasters and calamities, diligently fast to save the body. If able to nourish three lives, dao refining in the Three Primes. Sitting upright thinking of my dao, roaming and feasting in Kunlun. Not yet able to ascend the profound void, yet delight in roaming earthly immortals. Not envy human world’s pleasures, roaming the Five Mountains’ peaks. Then refining golden liquid, flying and ascending to the Imperial Heaven. Why not diligently cultivate fasting, sinking into the mundane world. Hundred ghosts attack and assail, fearing loss of Heaven’s appointed years. Thought after thought good succession, giving and benefiting the poor. Heaven’s dao not false precept, urging you to make good causes. Doing good, worry not lasting, accumulating virtue extends life.’
