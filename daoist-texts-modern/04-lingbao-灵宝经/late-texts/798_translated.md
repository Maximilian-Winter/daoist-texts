#### The Most High Cavernous Profound Numinous Treasure Wisdom Root of Sin Supreme Precept Scripture, Scroll One

In the era of the Most High Dao Lord, at the Cypress Mound Lodge of Southern Dan Cavern Yang, he respectfully bowed and inquired of the Primordial Heavenly Worthy: “Reflecting on past lives’ blessings and causes, through countless kalpas of fate’s turning, I have attained to meet the sacred radiance. Long ago, I was unexpectedly elevated, surpassing the honored True Ones, further receiving instruction and admonition from the Three Treasures’ Divine Scripture, granted the great precepts, and taught the Dharma’s sound. The joy surpassing the Great Peace is truly boundless. Since receiving this teaching, I have fasted in the empty mountains, reverently upholding the Dharma precepts, never daring to slacken. The path of the Dao has been fulfilled, opening the crossing for Heaven and Humanity. All men and women universally behold the Dharma gate, their years and lives extended, their lands secure. The heart that delights in pleasure is resolved never to retreat. Having been granted awakening, I wish to hear without fail. Yet I do not understand the wisdom of past fate’s root of sin, the numinous sound’s secret weight—may I briefly glimpse the chapters? If you pity me, please bestow again the words of precept, so that like the sun’s light piercing the dark night, the long-suffering souls may be rescued and liberated, reborn in halls of blessing, the Dao’s aid without exception, favor widespread and exalted. What I present is broken and scattered; I fear to offend Heaven’s countenance. My manifest heart truly hopes for grace.”

At that time, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy bestowed upon the Most High Dao Lord the *Wisdom Root of Sin Supreme Precept Scripture*. The Five Elders Great Emperors, the Great Holy Revered Deities, the Utmost Truths of the Ten Directions, the Celestial Immortals, the Mysterious Harmonious Jade Maidens, and fifty-two thousand five hundred assembled to the seat. Heaven scattered fragrant blossoms; divine dragons and countless celestial dancers performed. Heavenly maidens held the Ten Supreme Numinous Tokens, circling the sun and moon’s radiant essence. The divine winds gathered from four quarters, fragrant breezes brushed the dust; purple clouds emitted brilliance, crimson mists spread across Heaven. The three luminaries shone together; all heavens were bright. Rivers and seas lay silent; mountains veiled in mist; dragons and crystal beasts leapt; humans and spirits rejoiced. Birth and death rested alike; blessings and fortunes were widespread; the five sufferings all resolved; the three unwholesome paths all restored. Long freed from hell, reborn in Heaven, all beings gained long life. Then the Heavenly Worthy commanded the summoning of flying celestial beings from the Ten Directions, opening the Jade Treasury of the Nine Netherworlds’ long night box, bringing forth the records of birth and death sins, the roots of evil causes. The flying celestial beings from the Ten Directions each spoke of causes and conditions, reporting to the Most High Dao Lord.

The Heavenly Worthy said: “In the Dragon Han years, I issued the Dharma to humans. In that age, the world was foolish and deaf, ignorant of the Dharma sound, relying only on simplicity and purity, without evil intent, unversed in rites and righteousness, lacking sovereign and subject, unaware of past fate, ignorant of causes and conditions. Through Dharma instruction and admonition, they gradually entered the Dharma gate, wholeheartedly believing and turning toward it, free from roots of sin, their lives all long, no premature death. After I passed away, Heaven and Earth were destroyed, light vanished, men and women turned to ashes, sinking into prolonged calamity, dark and obscure for countless kalpas. At the dawn of the Red Brightness, light opened, Heaven and Earth restored, I again appeared in the world, called the Nameless Lord, issuing Dharma to teach and save the celestial and human. In that age, men and women’s conduct varied in refinement, not united in one heart. Those with faith and turning all gained long life; those born jealous and harmful, evil and disloyal, all had short lives. Thus arose the roots of sin and fortune. After I passed, one kalpa passed, Heaven and Earth again destroyed, light vanished, dark and obscure through five kalpas. At the first year of Kaihuang, the Numinous Treasure True Text opened the Three Phases, Heaven and Earth restored order, the Five Texts shone brightly. I, in the Primordial Azure Heaven, called the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, spread Dharma teachings, transforming and saving the heavens. At the beginning, people were simple and pure, tying knots to walk, their minds in chaos, conforming to nature, all living long for thirty-six thousand years. By the first year of Shanghuang, hearts gradually decayed, fearing decline, the correct Dharma incomplete. Thus, nations circulated and bestowed heavenly writings, all entering the Dharma, perfecting their hearts. In half a kalpa, life gradually declined, lifespan reaching eighteen thousand years. After I passed, Heaven’s cycle hastened, human hearts corrupted, conspiring rebellions. Jealousy and harm prevailed, competing for fame and merit, disbelieving the scriptures, doubting the heavenly truth. Mouth says one thing, heart another, making their own Dharma, indulging in licentious worship of evil spirits, killing living beings to pray for calamities. Bewildered and unsteady, harming one another, bringing premature death, life without reason, lifespan uncertain. Thus arose records of sin and evil seeds, revolving through the Five Paths and Eight Hardships, sinking into the three unwholesome paths, none knowing the root of life, dark and long night, countless kalpas with no return, dragged through suffering and ruin—truly pitiable and sorrowful. Now I shall inform you of the precepts to govern the body, the merits and retributions, the roots of sin in birth and death. If you can truly accept and carefully practice, widely proclaim and open the crossing, universally showing Heaven and Humanity, all men and women shall return to the body’s Dharma gate, uphold precepts and fast, keep far from evil sources, so that birth and death are joyous and peaceful, attaining the Dao naturally.” The Dao Lord joyfully listened to the precepts.

The Heavenly Worthy said: “If one wishes to secure the body and govern the nation, to keep gates and households pure and noble, with heavenly gods’ protection and earthly deities’ reverence, one must cultivate good merit, diligently fast and uphold precepts, widely spread the Dharma gate. Prioritize ancestors and later lives, benefiting all things, merit universal to all, merit filling three thousand realms, ascending to Heaven in broad daylight, cultivating good with surplus, Heaven descending cloud chariots. To widely propagate the Dao without ceasing is to attain immortality. This is the supreme precept of the original practice—how could one not revere it?”

One: Care for the dying and protect life, rescue from calamity and hardship, life granted its full span, no premature death.

Two: Heal sickness and cure disease, carry through distress and danger, body secure, no sharp pain.

Three: Bestow kindness to the poor and needy, save from peril and hardship, sacrifice self to aid others, without stinginess.

Four: Serve the Master and Treasures, build peaceful abodes, broadly perform merit, never weary.

Five: Transcribe and verify scriptures, morning and evening bow and recite, offer incense and lamps, heart without neglect.

Six: Cultivate fasting and contemplate the Dao, reverently follow the Dharma, inside and out pure and empty, no generation of filth or evil.

Seven: Withdraw from worldly affairs and guard righteousness, not contending for fame, embrace simplicity and preserve purity, act in accord with nature.

Eight: Spread transformation to the ignorant and vulgar, admonish and correct evil, all united in one heart, revering the great Dharma.

Nine: Establish wells along the border roads, plant fruit trees and groves, educate children, encourage good deeds.

Ten: Act in accordance with the Dharma, movement and stillness observable, teachings and rules proper, conduct consistent and natural.

These ten good causes form the supreme precept’s law, upheld by the Ten Heavenly Kings, those who practice them soar with celestial merit. Next, one should hold the body and act cautiously. Speaking to others: be kind to rulers, loving to children, affectionate to the crowd as a teacher, respectful in conduct as a brother, loyal to sovereign as a minister, filial to parents as a child, trustworthy in friendship, chaste as a wife, harmonious as a husband, reverent in rites as a disciple, encouraging farming among common folk, upright in the Dao as a Daoist, each guarding their own domain with foreigners, careful in affairs with servants. These fourteen precepts for holding the body are always honored by the Four Heavenly Emperors, universally proclaimed to upright scholars, deities, common people, sons and daughters alike, all urged to practice these supreme precepts, entering the Four Heavens’ natural halls of blessing. Those who do so are esteemed by the Four Heavens, praised by the Earth Deities, their rank comparable to Immortal Kings.

Next are the supreme one hundred and eighty precepts, the middle eighty precepts, and the lower forty precepts, combined with Primordial Wisdom’s three grades of laws, composed into the Great Precepts for Observing the Body, totaling three hundred. Without the virtue of a supreme immortal, whose body penetrates the Three Pure Ones and enters nature, none can uphold them. In the last days, men and women’s hearts will decay, conduct will slacken, harboring doubt and division, pursuing myriad distractions. Few will guard the truth; surely they cannot inherit the precepts for observing the body. Without reverence and observance, great calamity will surely ensue. Now, the supreme ten precepts are composed to save people, widely spread and open transformation, guiding entry into the Dharma gate. Those diligent in them will gain the blessings of nature, the path of non-action. The ten precepts are:

One: Do not envy those superior, nor suppress the wise and bright.

Two: Do not drink wine and act wantonly, defiling the Three Palaces.

Three: Do not lustfully violate others’ wives, nor covet delicate and smooth pleasures.

Four: Do not abandon the frail, the old, the sick, or the poor and lowly.

Five: Do not slander good people, nor attack fellow students.

Six: Do not greedily hoard treasures, unwilling to give or scatter.

Seven: Do not kill living beings for sacrifice or worship, nor disturb the Six Heavens’ ghosts and spirits.

Eight: Do not dismiss scriptures as falsehoods or absurdities.

Nine: Do not betray the Master’s grace and righteousness, nor practice deceitful new teachings.

Ten: Maintain equality and one heart, embodying benevolence and filial piety toward all.

These ten precepts universally teach all beings in the boundless worlds of the Ten Directions, saving all people. Those who uphold them have their merits recorded in the Ten Heavens, their blessings extending to the Seven Ancestors, drawn out from the long night of the Nine Netherworlds, ascending to the Southern Palace. Their bodies enter light, causes never severed, able to attain spirit immortality. All conduct complete, one must avoid the ten evils, keep far from blind paths, sever the root of sin. The ten evils are:

One: Drinking wine and indulging in lust, insatiable desire.

Two: Secretly harming the world, slandering Daoists.

Three: Disrespecting the Master, scorning the Dharma, arrogantly neglecting the Three Treasures.

Four: Stealing scriptures, falsely declaring Dao essentials.

Five: Borrowing and not returning, deceiving the masses.

Six: Killing for taste, mouth saying one thing, heart another.

Seven: Being unfilial, betraying grace, violating prohibitions.

Eight: Reciting scriptures carelessly, babbling arrogantly.

Nine: Demanding others’ expectations, wrathful toward all.

Ten: Cutting off scripture’s meaning, damaging sacred texts, disbelieving past fate, indulging in desires, defiling and neglecting the Four Great Elements, forgetting the path of life.

These ten evil precepts cannot be separated from the body. Those who violate them suffer many calamities, harmed by ghosts and spirits, enduring myriad pains, never at peace, doing good but meeting evil, all directions losing benefit. Death leads to hell, locked behind heavy bars in the long night, never seeing the three lights, wandering day and night. Clutching bronze pillars, treading knife mountains, circling sword trees, entering boiling cauldrons, swallowing fire and eating charcoal, enduring all five sufferings, long sinking in the Nine Netherworlds, no hope of rebirth. Even if released, they return as six-legged beasts, never regaining human path. Evil begets evil, good begets good; the pairings of sin and fortune are like the sun and moon’s trailing light, birth and death’s unending shadow. Causes turn and accumulate like the wheels of a cart. Now these precepts are spoken to protect and save Heaven and Humanity. Hear and accept truly, diligently practice and never forget. If pure and faithful men and women can uphold the ten precepts, their strength abundant, desiring to diligently advance and widely perform all good, they may be granted the twelve auxiliary precepts, opening the ten good and fourteen body-holding precepts.

The Heavenly Worthy said: “For those who study, cultivate fasting, seek the Dao, open the crossing for Heaven and Humanity, and perform good merit, they should observe the twelve auxiliary precepts to attain salvation. You should follow them, thus gaining true correctness, ultimately entering non-action, all wishes fulfilled. The twelve auxiliary precepts are:

One: Upon seeing the true scriptures and correct Dharma, opening salvation for all, immediately arouse Dao intention, wishing future generations to ascend the Great Sage.

Two: Constantly practice compassion, wishing all to universally see the Dharma, opening wide salvation without obstacle.

Three: Delight in scriptures and teachings, deeply and broadly understanding, will firm and clear, enlightening the ignorant and dark.

Four: Follow and receive the Master’s instruction, widely open admonition, guiding entry into the Dharma wall, far from blind paths.

Five: Believe and turn toward the mysterious, revere scriptures and formulas, recite morning and evening without weariness.

Six: Do not pursue glory and wealth, sever causes and conditions, focus and set intention, all efforts on the Dharma.

Seven: Diligently recite great scriptures, wish all to be saved, broadly open bridges, making good causes for future lives.

Eight: Always generate good mind, no evil or falsehood, no envy or harm, no wickedness or expansion.

Nine: In one’s birth place, always meet sacred times, promote Numinous Treasure Dharma teaching, encounters unbroken.

Ten: Keep body pure and precepts, cultivate fasting and merit, broadly save all beings, all attain liberation.

Eleven: Study broadly, proclaim the common Dharma, prepare Heaven and Humanity, universally open salvation.

Twelve: Always be with wise Masters, meeting generation after generation, receiving instruction and spreading transformation, saving countless, all good hearts attaining true Dao.”

The Heavenly Worthy said: “The scholar’s method of governance and conduct should observe the twelve auxiliary precepts. Those who with one heart practice these good thoughts, generation after generation will see the Sage, bind affinity with the Dao, befriend celestial beings, walk alone through the Three Realms without hindrance. Long freed from the three evils, the five paths, and eight hardships, spirits revere and protect, earth deities guard, gates and households pure and solemn, ten thousand calamities do not touch—this is truly sitting upright and attaining the Dao. Diligently recite and widely proclaim, all fellow students should enter the Dharma gate together.”

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy finished speaking the precepts. The Most High Dao Lord, the Utmost Truths of the Ten Directions, the Great Saints of Limitlessness, the Lofty Mysterious Perfected Ones, joyfully performed ritual bows, all facing east, kowtowing to the ground. The Most High Dao Lord advanced and knelt long, speaking to the Heavenly Worthy: “With all the True Ones attending, hearing the Dharma sound, the heavens leap with joy, celebrations beyond measure. The great Dharma now flourishes, universally saving Heaven and Humanity. Future men and women shall receive this grace. Yet seeing the world foolish and deaf, not seeing the root of life, unaware of sin and fortune, whence they come, though enlightened, many do not believe. Having already bestowed instruction and admonition, I wish the august grace to be universally granted, all beings in the boundless worlds of the Ten Directions, men and women alike, simultaneously awakened, seeing past fate’s good and evil causes, sin and fortune’s retribution, knowing the root of life, all Heaven saved, Dharma teaching flourishing.”

Then the Heavenly Worthy released his majestic radiance, penetrating inside and out, illuminating the Ten Directions, no darkness or concealment, limitless and boundless, suddenly bright as if before one’s eyes. These men and women were all good beings in the heavens’ highest halls of blessing, carefree in non-action, joyful and natural. Below, observing the Nine Netherworlds’ courts of earth, in the long night, prisoners toiling, hungry ghosts and beasts, drifting dead souls, heads and bodies shorn, no longer human form, locked behind heavy bars, not seeing the three lights. Common men and women all saw their root of life, sin and fortune, cause and effect of good and evil retribution, none not trembling in fear, all at once turning their hearts, revering the great Dharma, practicing many good deeds, entrusting their fate to the Heavenly Worthy, submitting to precepts without turning back. Blessings and virtue spread everywhere, joy unspeakable, celebrations overwhelming. The great saints of Heaven all praised this goodness, thus composing this hymn:

> The Ten Heavens wheel in empty space,  
> Death and life return from within.  
> Good and evil each give birth to roots,  
> Causes and effects never fail.  
> Seeing pure faithful ones of old,  
> Thus they soar through Ten Heavens.  
> Traversing the long night of Nine Netherworlds,  
> Suffering souls climb mountains in sorrow.  
> The long river cannot be blocked,  
> Knife mountains cannot be turned back.  
> Wheels turn through Five Paths,  
> Compassion wounds the human heart.  
> The Heavenly Worthy proclaims precepts,  
> Opening the long night’s darkness.  
> All heavens rejoice together,  
> This joy is hard to match.

The Heavenly Worthy said: “Now I command the heavenly spirits to speak the records of sin, proclaim the Dharma sound, awaken all beings, enlighten Heaven and Humanity, good men and women. Let them know their bodies’ sins and roots of life, causes never severed, calamities following one another, wandering through the Three Paths and Five Ways, souls and forms suffering, countless kalpas with no return. Therefore, I speak these precepts, guiding entry into the Dharma gate, opening salvation in the Nine Netherworlds, pulling out roots of suffering, so that the living may see the Dao, their bodies freed from the Eight Hardships, the dead rejoicing, ascending to Heaven, born early among men, turning the wheel as sacred kings, birth and death joyous and peaceful, generation after generation enduring. Forewarned by faith and turning, all should diligently uphold precepts and fast, thus attaining true Dao, carefully acting and diligently cultivating, truly accepting and never forgetting, able to harmonize with the great Dharma, then should listen obediently.”

For five years they are reborn at gates of emperors, turning the wheel of blessings, thus always dwelling in good causes.”

The Most High Dao Lord inquired of the Flying Celestial Beings of the Northern World: “I have often observed the heavens, traveling the Northern Gate, seeing in the Northern Boundless World’s hells, Three Rivers, Nine Rivers, and mountains, punishing common men and women ghosts, drifting through the Three Paths, carrying mountains and stones, blocked at long sources, swallowing fire and eating charcoal, no longer human form. These people endure punishment, sentenced for years, shall attain release. On the day of release, returning to human form, can they truly be saved or not?”

The Flying Celestial Beings of the Northern World said: “These people’s lives were cruel and unrighteous. The Five Qi Heavenly Lords, Northern Spirit Officials, and Three Realms’ Masters bind their records. According to the Mysterious Capital Jade Maiden Azure Sun Palace Fire Official’s law, after ten thousand kalpas they are born among six-legged beasts, revolving the Five Paths fifty thousand kalpas countless times, then becoming assistants to the Northern Peak Office. Their punishment is long and difficult to return from. To open salvation and quickly see the root of life, one must follow the Bright True Jade Treasury Jade Maiden Azure Sun Palace rites, with mysterious patterned silk fifty feet long, or five feet, and one golden dragon token, presenting to the Five Qi Heavenly Lords and Northern Spirit Officials. In the Nine Netherworlds, they redeem sinful souls. For five days and five nights, bright lamps burn incense, first thanking the Heavenly Lord. They may attain salvation, see the light. For five years, all return to human birth among good causes.”

The Flying Celestial Beings of the Northeastern Boundless World said: “In the Northeastern Boundless World, countless beings have attained the Dao, past and present, good men and women dwelling in blessings, cultivating and upholding the Wisdom Supreme Ten Precepts. Their merits and virtue complete, those attained the Dao hold supreme truth. Those not yet attained, present in the world, respected by the Three Realms, feared by earth deities, upon death ascending Heaven, spirits mingling and socializing. The Northeastern Earth Officials list their names among the Brahma Qi Heavens. The Brahma Qi Heavenly Lords report to the Northeastern Three Officials, Nine Bureaus, one hundred and twenty divisions, removing the Yellow Origin’s root of sin from the Jade Treasury of the Nine Netherworlds’ long night box. The Brahma Heaven Life Registrar records them in the celestial immortal registers. The Nine Ancestors ascend to the Southern Palace, escape the Five Paths, roam halls of blessing. For five years they are reborn at gates of blessings, generation after generation, enjoying endless blessings.”

The Most High Dao Lord inquired of the Flying Celestial Beings of the Northeastern World: “I have often observed the heavens, traveling the Northeastern Gate, seeing in the Northeastern Boundless World’s hells, common men and women enduring punishment, all sufferings complete, drifting in suffering, no longer human form. What guilt do these people bear? What offenses in past lives? What lives did they kill to receive this punishment? What merit can save and redeem?”

The Flying Celestial Beings of the Northeastern World said: “These people’s previous lives lacked compassion, hunting in spring, setting nets, burning mountains, shooting beasts, killing living beings. Their sins are deep and heavy. They died suffering punishment, bodies bearing blows, myriad pains crossing, driven through hundreds of extremes, no rest in eating or sleeping. To redeem these sins and return to blessings, one must follow the Bright True rites, with yellow patterned silk one hundred and twenty feet long, or twelve feet, and one golden dragon token, presenting to the Northeastern Brahma Qi Heavenly Lord and Northeastern Spirit Officials in the Nine Netherworlds’ courts. Redeeming sinful souls for twelve days and twelve nights, burning incense and lamps, illuminating all hells and courts, so long-suffering souls may see the light, roots of sin scattered, returning to gates of blessing, souls ascending the Southern Palace, receiving natural celebration.”

The Flying Celestial Beings of the Lower Boundless World said: “In the Lower Boundless World, countless beings have attained the Dao, Earth Immortals of the Five Peaks and Perfected Ones, and those not yet attained, good men and women dwelling in blessings, cultivating and upholding the Wisdom Supreme Ten Precepts. Their merits and virtue full, those attained the Dao hold supreme truth. Those not yet attained, their names recorded among the heavens, on the day of passing ascending directly to halls of blessing. The Eastern Flower Palace’s Five Peaks and Five Emperors list their names among the Thirty-Two Heavenly Emperors, reporting to the Eight Extremes, Three Officials, Nine Bureaus, Earth Prisons, removing roots of sin from the Jade Treasury of the Nine Netherworlds’ long night box. The Celestial Life Registrars record them in the Golden Grid immortal registers. The Seven Ancestors all escape earthly punishments, ascend to the Southern Palace, later born among men at gates of wealth and honor, accumulating merit and diligent cultivation, turning the wheel without weariness, attaining flight, ascending the Supreme Ultimate, their rank becoming immortals.”

The Most High Dao Lord inquired of the Flying Celestial Beings of the Lower Boundless World: “I have often observed the lower realms, traveling the Eight Extremes. Seeing in the Lower Boundless World’s hells, common men and women enduring cruel punishments, large and small linked, drifting in suffering among prisoners of the Eight Extremes. What guilt do these people bear? What offenses in past lives? What scriptures and laws did they violate to receive such punishment? What merit can save and redeem their past offenses, enabling rebirth in the human path?”

The Flying Celestial Beings of the Lower Boundless World said: “These people in past lives disrespected ghosts and spirits, disbelieved scriptures and teachings, offended earth deities, Five Peaks, and Four Rivers. Their sins are beyond record. They died suffering cruel punishments, sinking deep in hells. Without Bright True rites to redeem them, countless kalpas have no origin. To open salvation, one must use yellow patterned silk thirty-two feet long, and one golden dragon token, presenting to the Lower World’s Earth Offices, Five Peaks, famous mountains, waters, Three Officials, Nine Bureaus, Twelve River Sources, in the Nine Netherworlds. Redeeming sinful souls for one day and one night, twelve hours, burning incense and lamps, illuminating all underworlds, within the Nine Netherworlds, so long-suffering dead souls may see the light, receiving salvation, returning to gates of blessing.”

The Flying Celestial Beings of the Upper Boundless World said: “In the Upper Boundless World of the Thirty-Two Heavens, countless beings have attained the Dao, Supreme Sages, High Spirits, and Perfected Ones, and those not yet attained, good men and women dwelling in blessings, cultivating and upholding the Wisdom Supreme Ten Precepts. Their merits and virtue full, those attained the Dao hold supreme truth. Those not yet attained, their names recorded among the Thirty-Two Heavens. On the day of passing, ascending directly to halls of blessing, roaming above the Three Realms and Great Luo, the heavens’ right division. In the Nine Netherworlds’ courts and long night, their sin records are removed, Seven Ancestors redeemed, ascending to the Southern Palace, reborn among men, cultivating the good path, generation after generation, causes unbroken, delighting without end, attaining immortals, flying through the Three Realms and Great Luo Heavens.”

The Most High Dao Lord inquired of the Flying Celestial Beings of the Upper Boundless World: “I have often observed the Thirty-Two Heavens above, roaming the Three Realms. Seeing the Northern Prison of Heaven One, Azure Shao Upper Prison, and Three Rivers’ Long Night courts, common men and women, naked and bare flesh, without clothing or food, bodies struck by iron rods, pain unbearable, drifting through the Three Rivers, drawing water from floods to irrigate the Four Rivers, toiling day and night without rest. What offenses did these people commit in past lives to receive such punishment? What merit can save and redeem, enabling rebirth among men?”

The Flying Celestial Beings of the Upper Boundless World said: “These people’s previous lives disbelieved the great Dharma, doubted and destroyed scriptures, violated the ten precepts, thus receiving this punishment, becoming celestial prisoners. Without Bright True rites to redeem them, countless kalpas have no return. To open salvation, often use azure patterned silk thirty-two feet long, one golden dragon token, presenting to the heavens’ palaces and bureaus, redeeming past punishments, opening salvation in the Nine Netherworlds’ prisoner dead souls. For one day and one night, twelve hours, burning incense and lamps, illuminating the heavens, Long Night rivers, and Nine Netherworlds, so punished ghosts may see the light, receiving salvation, returning to gates of blessing.”

The Most High Dao Lord joyfully performed ritual bows, speaking to the Heavenly Worthy: “Today, attending, hearing the Ten Directions’ flying celestial beings speak of the supreme precepts for uprooting sin, the living saved, the dead returned, all within the Nine Netherworlds universally receiving light. Future men and women, with good hearts and faith, shall surely gain blessings, generation after generation, delighting without end, their bodies attaining immortals, incense and lamps offered, gates and households flourishing, the Three Realms’ guards attending, myriad spirits paying homage, ghosts subdued, a thousand calamities not touching. The great Dharma opens and transforms, countless kalpas without end, blessings grand and mighty, towering beyond measure. Joyful for future lives receiving this great grace, I cannot contain my joy, thus compose this hymn.” At that time, all heavens simultaneously praised goodness.

### Hymn of the Most High Wisdom’s Eternal Joy

The Dragon Han teems with pure folk,  
Hearts mixed, all natural.  
Five passions do not contend,  
Forms hold immortal spirits.  
Dragon Gate severs the Long River,  
Three Paths no longer enslave.  
Resting in the Five Paths’ fields,  
Knife and sword mountains removed.  
Vast within the Primordial Han,  
Nine Netherworlds lack suffering souls.  
No cries of corpses heard,  
Only words of eternal joy.  
No ghosts of long night seen,  
Only flying celestial immortals.  
What joy is this world’s joy?  
Thus recite the song of joy.  
All heavens bow and celebrate,  
Together praising the kalpa’s year.  
Mysterious Capital’s seven treasure forests,  
Ten Heavens’ universal Pumiro.  
Purple smoke views numinous radiance,  
Cloud scenes adorn jade peaks.  
Above are halls of blessing and virtue,  
Palaces interlaced and varied.  
All are pure faithful ones,  
True immortals flying in Heaven.  
Three Realms’ mysterious path open,  
Five Paths clear and uncorrupted.  
Good roots born from causes,  
Accumulated merits enjoy much blessing.  
Linked causes seek continuation,  
Great Dharma surely true.  
No one lives ten thousand years,  
All share kalpa’s origin.  
Joyful world and generations,  
Uttering words forming a song.  
This world views boundlessness,  
How shall the coming fate endure?

The Most High Dao Lord at Cypress Mound Lodge in Cavern Yang received precepts, seeing the heavens’ halls of blessing, countless kalpas’ kin, all carefree in non-action, clothing and food natural, bodies radiant, companions flying immortals, no sorrow or grief, unaware of suffering, seeing this grieves and rejoices, thus composing the Hymn of Eternal Joy.

### Hymn of the Most High Wisdom’s Suffering Spirits

Born into the realm of suffering spirits,  
Revolving the Five Paths’ courts.  
Nine Netherworlds close the long night,  
Countless kalpas without light.  
Knife mountains filled with sword trees,  
Poison blades towering sharp.  
No flocks of birds gather,  
Only suffering souls’ voices heard.  
Whirling winds shake long branches,  
Mournful echoes flow through cold courts.  
Above are mountain treaders,  
Time never pauses.  
Hungry, eating twisted spring charcoal,  
Thirsty, drinking smelted fire essence.  
Drifting through the Three Paths,  
How know form or name?  
Remember you do not know fate,  
Sorrowful and wounding to hearts.  
Sin and fortune each born from causes,  
Good and evil surely from the heart.  
Revolving never ending,  
Like sound never ceasing.  
Nine Netherworlds hold original records,  
Countless kalpas seeking each other.  
Cold ice’s boundless source,  
Long night’s heavy shade.  
No halls of blessing seen,  
Only forests of poor ghosts.  
Long rivers hard to block,  
Suffering souls climb mountains and chant.  
Lonely voice faces the final sword,  
Wailing falls on knife peaks.  
This form no longer form,  
Painful and wounding to hearts.

The Most High Dao Lord traveled the Eight Gates, seeing the hells’ locked heavy bars, and the Three Rivers, Nine Rivers, knife mountains, sword trees, prisoners, hungry ghosts, punishing dead souls, drifting in suffering, no longer human form, unbearable to behold. Seeing this grieves, thus composing the Hymn of Suffering Spirits.

The Heavenly Worthy told the Most High Dao Lord: “Today, together with the Ten Directions’ Utmost Truths and Limitless Great Saints, sharing one kalpa of life, joy beyond words, speech unable to exhaust, heart unable to manifest. Speaking of all good and evil, precepts and laws, nothing hidden, all heavens celebrate together, proclaiming Dharma sound, universally saving countless. How fortunate this life to encounter this scripture and teaching, spontaneously generating good heart, life granted long years, no wrongful premature death. On the day of final return, ascending directly to Heaven, causes never severed, all attaining true Dao. I consider the future last days’ men and women, all following fate and turning, hearts pressured and urgent, unwittingly generating sin, roots of sin arising, sinking into the Five Paths, losing the path of faith, no return, wandering the Three Paths and Five Sufferings, knife mountains and sword trees, flying blood ten thousand miles, boundless cold ice, poor souls filling the night, wailing long and loud, sorrowful and wounding. Pity this misfortune, unable to return. Therefore, I speak this scripture for future faithful and turning people, opening the crossing bridge, universally enabling escape from evil roots, bodies entering light, returning to good causes. Sincerely revering and practicing, surely gaining blessings; disbelievers shall receive calamity. After I pass, this text shall return to the Great Luo’s upper seven treasure mysterious platform purple radiance palace. As the Bright True mysterious method, it shall be practiced for forty thousand kalpas in the next world, teaching and saving Heaven and Humanity. Now I inform you to recognize clearly.” At that time, all saints and the Most High Dao Lord joyfully performed ritual bows and withdrew.
