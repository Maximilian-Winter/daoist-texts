Primordial Heavenly Worthy, on the first day of the seventh month in the first year of the Kaihuang era, at noon, upon the floating Luo Peak in the mountain of Yucha in the Western Nayu Kingdom, amidst a long mulberry forest, bestowed upon the Most High Dao Lord the supreme wisdom great precepts. At that moment, the Dao Lord, having received the precepts, rose and faced north, bowed his head to the ground, turned his heart toward the Ten Directions, then faced east and prostrated himself. The Heavenly Worthy spoke to the Most High Dao Lord:

“Now is the time to proclaim and disseminate the dharma sound, to awaken all living beings, to relieve men and women of calamities and afflictions, to request blessings and save lives, to uproot all suffering. So that the living may see the Dao, the body may escape the eight hardships, the dead rejoice, drink from the heavenly banquet, be born early among men, and become wheel-turning sage kings. Those who cultivate the fast and seek the Dao must with one heart request and uphold the ten precepts, listen attentively without forgetting, focus silently in contemplation, penetrate the natural, and avoid scattered thoughts that disturb form and spirit. Those who can do so, now listen in stillness.”

The Heavenly Worthy said:

**First Precept:** The heart harbors no evil jealousy; no birth of shadowy thieves; restrain the mouth and be cautious with faults; keep thoughts fixed on the dharma.

**Second Precept:** Uphold benevolence and do not kill; pity and aid all beings; extend compassion broadly; nourish all without exception.

**Third Precept:** Maintain chastity and modesty; neither lust nor steal; always act with good intent; harm oneself to benefit others.

**Fourth Precept:** Avoid lust and desire; the heart is not loose; guard purity and caution; conduct without stain.

**Fifth Precept:** The mouth utters no evil words; speech is not ornate or flowery; inward and outward remain upright; do not transgress with the tongue.

**Sixth Precept:** Reduce wine and moderate behavior; harmonize qi and nature; spirit is not harmed; avoid all evil.

**Seventh Precept:** Do not envy others’ superiority; avoid contests for fame and merit; in all matters be humble and yielding; withdraw and measure others.

**Eighth Precept:** Do not criticize scriptures or teachings; do not slander sacred writings; personally uphold the dharma; always as if facing the divine.

**Ninth Precept:** Do not quarrel with words; do not debate the four classes; Heaven and humans resent it; harm to spirit arises.

**Tenth Precept:** In all actions and deeds, maintain equality and one heart; harmony among people and reverence among spirits; conduct always as such.

The Heavenly Worthy said: “To cultivate and uphold these precepts is to align with the heart of Heaven. Always practice great compassion, wishing for all to be universally saved from calamity. Humbly honor the teachings and never grow lax. Better to guard goodness and die than to live in evil. Thus, without retreat, one can be liberated from the Five Paths, avoid the Three Evils, be protected by the heavens, respected by myriad spirits, and through long fasting and upholding the precepts, naturally attain salvation in the world.” The Most High Dao Lord, overwhelmed with joy and awe, bowed and accepted the command.

The Heavenly Worthy said: “For those who seek learning, cultivate the fast and walk the Dao, open the way for Heaven and humans, perform all good deeds, they should follow the twelve guidelines below to attain world salvation and true authenticity, ultimately entering the realm of non-action where all wishes are fulfilled.

**First:** Upon seeing the true scriptures and dharma that liberate all, immediately awaken the Dao intention, with the heart wishing that future generations ascend to great sainthood.

**Second:** Always practice a compassionate heart, wishing that all universally see and hear, spreading liberation far and wide without obstruction.

**Third:** Delight in scriptures and teachings, deeply and broadly study, with firm and clear will, enlightening the ignorant.

**Fourth:** Respect and receive the master’s instructions, widely open exhortations, leading into the dharma boundary, far from blind paths.

**Fifth:** Believe in the profound mysteries, honor the scriptures and formulas, recite morning and evening without weariness.

**Sixth:** Do not seek glory or wealth, sever worldly ties, focus the mind and determination, dedicating oneself to the dharma.

**Seventh:** Diligently recite the great scriptures, wish for all beings, widely open bridges, creating causes for future lives.

**Eighth:** Always cultivate a good heart, free from evil and falsehood, without jealousy or harm, without malice or envy.

**Ninth:** In the place of birth, always meet the holy age, encounter the Numinous Treasure dharma teachings, and never be separated.

**Tenth:** Keep the body pure and uphold precepts, cultivate the fast and build merit, broadly save all beings, all attain liberation.

**Eleventh:** Study widely and proclaim the profound dharma, preparing Heaven and humans, universally enabling liberation.

**Twelfth:** Always associate with bright masters, meeting generation after generation, receiving instruction and spreading transformation, saving countless beings. All good hearts thereby attain the true Dao.”

The Heavenly Worthy said: “The scholar’s method of cultivation must follow these twelve guidelines and precepts. Those who with one heart practice these good thoughts will see the sacred writings generation after generation, bind themselves to the Dao. The heavenly friends recognize them, uniquely transcending the Three Realms, unobstructed by stars, forever free from the Three Evils, Five Paths, and Eight Hardships. All spirits respect and protect them; earth deities guard and escort; gates are pure and solemn; myriad disasters do not touch them. This is truly sitting upright and attaining the Dao. Diligently recite and widely proclaim, all fellow learners with one heart, together entering the dharma gate.”

The Heavenly Worthy said: “The Dao is wondrous; the human body is precious. Therefore, the Dao reveals the dharma, leaving behind the precept scriptures to save the human form. When the human form is saved, it rises to unite with the Dao. One should be refined in conduct, uphold the fast and precepts, with a calm and silent heart, clear intention, single-mindedly turning toward the Dao, focused without duality, purging the six organs, avoiding excess taste, internally and externally pure and void, always in accord with nature. On the fast day, when incense is lit and vows made, the heart’s wish reaches the heavens. The four heavenly inspectors and the ten divisions of mighty spirits descend to enact it, observing and listening to the supreme sound, reflecting your heart. Those who uphold the precepts and walk the Dao accumulate merit among the heavens; blessings and calamities manifest immediately. The Dao does not fail those who diligently practice and truly accept; do not heed the words of demons.”

The Heavenly Worthy said: “If good men and good women can awaken the natural Dao intention, enter the dharma gate, receive my ten precepts, and follow the twelve guidelines, they become clear and faithful disciples of the great Dao, equal in merit to the valiant flying heavens. Flying heavens have not yet attained the Dao; they are disciples of the great Dao’s ten transformations, soaring through empty space, serving as charioteers for the heavens. Clear and faithful disciples, seen in the world, can be free from worry, liberated from suffering, their bodies entering brightness, their forms internally pure and upright, summoning ghosts and commanding spirits, subduing demon essences. Upon the tenth transformation, they ascend to become flying heavens. If at the first transformation, they diligently advance without slackening, performing good deeds, fasting and practicing austerity morning and evening without weariness, they will attain flying heaven. From there they progress, transcending the Three Realms, becoming Perfected Ones of the Supreme Clarity.”

The Heavenly Worthy said: “Receive my ten precepts and follow the twelve guidelines, all should bow and proclaim: ‘Clear and faithful disciple, from now on receiving the precepts, one heart devoted to practice, dare not disbelieve, surrender to the Ten Directions.’ Those who do so see the world’s gates flourish, all attain health and strength, earth deities attend and guard, the Three Realms welcome, the seven ancestors’ souls ascend to the Southern Palace, clothed and fed by the heavenly kitchen, early reborn, returning to the gates of human kings, generation after generation unbroken, bound to the Dao. The Heavenly Worthy said: Establish the fast and walk the Dao; the four heavenly emperors ride flying clouds and green plows, the eight scenes raised in jade, attended by perfected beings and jade maidens, holding floral sprays, leading with phoenix songs, following with heavenly banners, white cranes and lions, howling and singing, burning incense and scattering flowers, floating through the air to come, to gaze upon and honor the Dao, to observe and hear the dharma sound. The heavenly kings descend, myriad spirits bow. How could one fail to exhaust their dharma? One must first receive the ten precepts, then walk the Dao, orderly and elegant, calm in heart and closed in thought, sitting, rising, lying, resting, never departing from ritual form. The heavenly kings rejoice, listing names among the Supreme Clarity; truly, attaining the Dao lies within the heart’s space.”

**Supreme Wisdom Closing the Six Passions: The Highest Grade Precepts**

**First Precept:** The eyes do not gaze widely, nor are they distracted by colorful flowers; the pupils do not vanish or lose clarity; light is not dimmed or obscured.

**Second Precept:** The ears do not listen to disorder, mingling with the five tones; harming the spirit and spoiling correctness; evil sounds wailing and moaning.

**Third Precept:** The nose does not broadly smell, mixed with foul and fishy odors; easily becoming turbid; the form not pure and upright.

**Fourth Precept:** The mouth does not crave flavors, such as grease and incense; turbid substances flow into the five spirits; internal organs are sullied and corrupted.

**Fifth Precept:** The hands do not commit evil; do not steal others’ belongings; greed enters oneself; calamity comes unawares.

**Sixth Precept:** The heart harbors no love or desire; shaking the five spirits; harming essence and losing blackness; the body and hair become confused and wild.

The Heavenly Worthy said: “These six precepts are the great afflictions of the body. In future births, men and women, though taking human form, their six passions are impure, not having seen the scriptures or heard the dharma sound, unaware of their form, lost in sin’s gate, their lives short, not reaching Heaven’s years, dwelling long in evil paths—truly pitiable. Therefore, these precepts are spoken to liberate Heaven and humans, with good hearts and faith, one intention surrendering, honoring the sacred teachings, closing all evil gates, so the form enters the void, attaining the sixfold wisdom. The sixfold wisdom is: penetrating sight, penetrating hearing, penetrating emptiness, penetrating void, penetrating clarity, penetrating subtlety—thus sixfold penetration, nothing not penetrated. The six passions calm, the spirit naturally returns; essence self-arises; essence self-fortifies; lifespan long and far-reaching; ultimately undying.”

**Five:** Liberate all creeping creatures, all sentient beings, enabling completion without premature death. Seeing the world flourish, avoiding all calamities.

**Six:** Always practice compassion, pitying and aiding all, releasing life and liberating from peril; its merit is very great. Enabling those in the world to dwell safely in danger, recover health in sickness, gain wealth in poverty, all according to heart’s desire.

The Heavenly Worthy said: “These six precepts all flow from the heart’s penetrating wisdom, able to bestow virtue, act in accord with nature, blessings constantly dwell in the body, calamities always kept far from the gate. Enjoying delights without end, generation after generation, causes and effects turning, receiving retribution, flying heaven equal merit, transcending the nine transformations of the wheel, gradually entering the great Dao. The tenfold transformed disciples are recorded among the heavens, the seven ancestors ascend together, born above in Heaven, clothed and fed by blessings, reborn among men, wheel-turning divine kings, forever dwelling in the gate of blessings.”

The Heavenly Worthy said: “These ten good encouragement precepts, unless one is a tenfold transformed disciple of the great Dao, none can practice them. Those who do so have merit equal to flying heavens, their hearts united with sixfold wisdom, penetrating void and non-being. After death, all fly amid clouds, saints driving chariots, roaming the Ten Directions. From this, never slackening, they attain ranks of immortal kings, the seven ancestors leaving dark night, ascending the Southern Palace, clothed and fed by the heavenly kitchen, receiving blessings naturally. Their dharma is profound and wondrous, liberating countless beings, majestic and vast, beyond measure.”

The Heavenly Worthy said: “The sixfold wisdom is: Heaven is penetrating sight; Earth is penetrating hearing; East is penetrating emptiness; West is penetrating void; South is penetrating clarity; North is penetrating subtlety. The sixfold penetration is vast and boundless, unfathomable and inexhaustible, encompassing all, containing all. Those with the qi of six perceptions always connect with six wisdoms. When a person recognizes the sixfold penetration, the six perceptions become bright. Controlling the six passions, one naturally abandons all evil roots, giving rise to good thoughts; the heart embodies six wisdoms, naturally attaining spirit immortality.”

The Heavenly Worthy said: “The root of the Dao, to liberate from the ten sufferings and eight hardships, one must receive the great precepts, cultivate the fast and establish virtue, build all good deeds, praised by the Three Realms, observed by the heavens, the body fully liberated, the Dao fully accomplished. Without receiving the great precepts, fasting alone is vain; or breaking grain and resting, hiding in mountains and forests, seeking salvation of the flesh without sixfold wisdom practice, merely losing merit, no way to achieve accomplishment. Good men and women with utmost sincerity diligently seek true acceptance. Now this scripture is spoken, broadly opening liberation, so all in the Ten Directions universally hear the dharma sound.”

The Heavenly Worthy said: “Heaven is penetrating sight, thus heavenly eye wisdom is high, wisdom penetrating without end. From above to below, all four sides and eight directions, nothing is not illuminated, nothing unclear. Though called one penetrating wisdom, it encompasses all five colors. Heaven penetrates naturally, thus no harm. Humans emulate Heaven; the red pupil in the eye also has five colors of light. If one does not uphold precepts, the six perceptions darken, not penetrating human orifices; wisdom unopened, gazing widely at five colors, the pupil flutters, light dims and clouds, causing blindness. Therefore, these precepts are spoken to liberate Heaven and humans, so men and women hear the dharma sound. To surpass and be liberated, with long life, one must uphold these precepts, diligently practice without forgetting, carefully restrain many color thoughts, restrain the wandering eye spirit, self-control, cherish the eye pupil, think truly and quietly, enabling momentary wisdom, penetrating and observing emptiness. Holding precepts and restraining oneself, the five colors return to the body. When five colors return, no harm occurs, preserving your lifespan, attaining infinity.”

The Heavenly Worthy said: “Earth is penetrating hearing, wisdom far hearing, thus responding to Heaven above, reaching all four sides, nothing not exhausted, nothing unheard. Though called one penetrating wisdom, it encompasses all five sounds. Earth penetrates naturally, giving rise to the five sounds, unmoved and still, thus no harm. Humans imitate Earth; in the ear dwell the five sound spirits. If one does not uphold precepts, wisdom does not pass through, cannot listen disorderly to the five sounds. The five sounds cause the five spirits to flutter, leaving the ear empty and wasted, roaring and sorrowful cries. The five spirits weep, causing deafness. Therefore, these precepts are spoken to liberate Heaven and humans, so men and women universally hear the dharma sound. To gain longevity, uphold the great precepts, restrain the ear spirit, do not listen excessively to unlawful sounds, quietly listen to wondrous scriptures and true dharma chapters, enabling wisdom, penetrating the great void. Holding precepts and restraining oneself, the five sounds return to the body. When five sounds return, no evil sound remains, preserving your lifespan, achieving longevity.”

The Heavenly Worthy said: “East is penetrating emptiness, the beginning of yang, emerging from emptiness, wisdom bright and clear, thus called penetrating emptiness. Penetrating far and unobstructed, unfathomable, the initial blue qi, though called one penetrating wisdom, encompasses five mixtures. Emptiness admits all, thus no harm. Humans though having form, form also follows emptiness. The nose holds the yellow serene, repelling evil spirits. If one does not uphold precepts, wisdom does not penetrate, not entering wisdom, cannot eat mixed foul and fishy foods. The foul and fishy blackness clogs the nose spirit, the meridian source easily cut off, the bright channel blocked. Therefore, these precepts are spoken to liberate Heaven and humans, so men and women universally hear the dharma sound. To liberate from the ten sufferings and eight hardships, one must uphold these precepts, restrain the nose spirit, avoid excess foulness, cleanse the bright channel, guide life channels, illuminate wisdom, penetrate qi into emptiness. Holding precepts and restraining oneself, all qi returns to the body. When all channels return, merging with qi, one preserves body and life, never destroyed or harmed.”

The Heavenly Worthy said: “West is penetrating void, the lesser yang blackness, no exit from void, wisdom subtle and bright, thus called penetrating void. Void is unobstructed, penetrating far and hard to exhaust, lesser yin blackness, though called one penetrating wisdom, encompasses five flavors. Void admits all, void contains all. Humans though following void, if body does not uphold precepts, wisdom does not penetrate. Wisdom unopened, the five flavors cause harm; greedily eating grease and incense, the five spirits become restless, causing imbalance and short lifespan. Therefore, these precepts are spoken to liberate Heaven and humans, so men and women universally hear the dharma sound. To gain longevity, one must uphold the great precepts, restrain the five spirits, carefully avoid greed for five flavors, sweet fats and incense, cleanse the five organs, always keep cool. When the body has wisdom, the five flavors harmonize and fragrance arises, inside and outside peaceful and calm, lifespan unharmed.”

The Heavenly Worthy said: “South is penetrating clarity, the greater yang blackness, qi issuing from clear wisdom, opening gates and penetrating clarity. Thus the South has the Red Emperor’s penetrating yang court, refining all things, receiving refinement and becoming bright. If one does not uphold precepts, wisdom does not penetrate. Wisdom unopened, the heart and spirit shake, arising love and desire, causing confusion and wildness, losing spirit and harming life, lifespan not long. Therefore, these precepts are spoken to liberate Heaven and humans, so men and women universally hear the dharma sound. To gain longevity and surpass all afflictions, one must uphold these precepts, restrain heart and spirit, remove emotions and desires, abandon dust and enter clarity, illuminate wisdom, open six perceptions, enter penetrating clarity, harmonize with qi, preserve lifespan, and attain eternal longevity.”

The Heavenly Worthy said: “North is penetrating subtlety, born of the mysterious, wisdom distant and deep, subtle and truly penetrating, inspecting sins and blessings, master of life’s origin, hands working the four seasons, responding above to Heaven’s gate, Heaven’s gate constantly turning, hands also moving. Hands have great spirits, receiving life’s fullness, moving the four elements, observing human decay and formation. If one does not uphold precepts, wisdom does not penetrate, shaking the human heart, all evils arise, hands act unconsciously, greed and theft self-driven, causing short life, not reaching Heaven’s years. Therefore, these precepts are spoken to liberate Heaven and humans. To gain longevity and surpass evil roots, one must uphold these precepts, restrain hand spirits, illuminate wisdom, heart naturally brightens, hands do not steal, evil roots do not arise, respond to Heaven and follow blackness, body enters nature, preserving lifespan, forever attaining longevity.”

The Heavenly Worthy told the Most High Dao Lord: “The supreme wisdom highest grade precepts, men and women of Heaven and humans, who awaken natural Dao intention, sacrifice themselves and distribute widely, opening fields of blessing, merit is very great. The merit of one act is repaid ten thousandfold. The principle of retribution is clear as sun and moon, sometimes seen in this life, sometimes in the next, but blessings vary and do not always come together. Among them, some calculate merit to offset faults, some redeem sins by virtue, some rescue ancestors from punishment and penalty. Hence retribution is not always immediately obvious. The Three Officials and Nine Courts record human merit and fault without loss. Sometimes prior sins are removed, body does not offend, later merit not yet clear, no difference from ordinary. This depends on one’s birth time and heavenly response, then blessings are liberated. Though shifting, the seven ancestors’ souls have already ascended Heaven, blessings gathered later, no error or loss. Clearly informing men and women to know retribution, Heaven’s Dao is not false, with good hearts and faith, diligently practicing without slack, one can attain liberation and receive endless blessings.”

The Heavenly Worthy told the Most High Dao Lord: “All the highest saints of Heaven, true great gods, heavenly emperors, and those gone before like dust and sand, those who have attained the Dao, all have done so by distributing and spreading virtue, performing good deeds, merit full and virtue sufficient, thus receiving good retribution, turning without end. All attain true Dao, transcending the Three Realms, roaming freely in the Supreme Clarity Great Luo Heaven, the Jade Capital, Mysterious Terrace, and Seven Treasure Forest. At this time all know that giving merit is not lost, joy is natural, generation after generation countless, the gifts given are slight, blessings and happiness boundless. In the last age, false and thin, human nature stingy and greedy, only knowing accumulation, heavy burdens for oneself, unable to awaken the heart to perform these merits. When merit is not accumulated, sins increase daily, long dwelling in halls of blessing, sinking into gates of sin, turning through the Five Paths and Eight Hardships—losing the blessed world, no return in sight. Men and women mutually bound, unaware whence their fate came, seeing their souls and spirits, truly pitiable and grievous. Now for the heavens I speak these prohibitions and precepts, so men and women universally hear the dharma sound, awaken the masses, and enter blessings.”

The Heavenly Worthy said: “I have surveyed the heavens and hells; among them, men and women punished as imprisoned poor souls, none but those who in previous lives did not see the clear precepts, or saw but did not act, or acted but did not follow, returning with regret, reentering sin’s gate, or born committing evil, not meeting good causes, or unaware of distributing and building merit, broadly making fields of blessing to uproot old roots. Only knowing to commit sin, wandering the three paths and eight hardships. Thinking of their ignorance, truly pitiable and grievous. Therefore, these precepts are spoken to liberate Heaven and humans, so men and women universally hear the dharma sound, know to awaken Dao heart, establish good merit, uproot all suffering, bind to the Dao, all attain joy and peace, roaming freely and naturally.”

The Most High Dao Lord received the precepts from Primordial Heavenly Worthy, liberating the heavens, the four directions and borderlands, merit accomplished, transmitting to the heavenly kings of the heavens, the great saints of the Ten Directions, the Imperial Lord of Supreme Subtlety, the Perfected Ones of the Four Extremes, the great gods of the Eastern Splendor Palace, the jade maiden celestial assembly, universally proclaiming and liberating future lives, enabling hearing the dharma sound. At that time all heavens rejoiced, “Excellent! Excellent!”
