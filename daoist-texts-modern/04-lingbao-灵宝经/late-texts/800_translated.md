## The Most High Profound Numinous Treasure Supreme Precept Scripture

At that time, the Heavenly Venerable, on the first day of the seventh month in the first year of the Kaihuang era, within the fragrant mulberry forest of the floating net realm on Mount Yucha in the Western Nayu Kingdom, bestowed the Supreme Precept Text of Wisdom of the Most High Dao Lord. At that moment, the Dao Lord received the precepts, prostrated fully with head to the ground, turned his heart to the Ten Directions, and contemplated the Three Respects.

Then, the host of celestial immortals soared down from the heavens: dragon chariots and tiger steeds, phoenix litters and luan carriages, emerald banners and feather fans, jade mists and colorful clouds, celestial flowers and precious banners, radiant brilliance blazing forth. Cranes cried their piercing calls, music rang clear and bright, colors descended from the sky, all coming to the Daoist assembly.

Immortal gentlemen and jade maidens circled, burning incense in swirling dance, stepping upon the void in praise and chant, bowing their heads in reverence and admiration. The Heavenly Venerable smiled gently, his face radiating light, and spoke the precepts to save beings; those who heard would dispel calamities.

The Heavenly Venerable commanded all good men and women, and the celestial officials, that on the first day of each month, two child attendants descend to the human realm to observe their good and evil deeds, recording right and wrong. Those who do good are registered in the heavenly bureau’s book of merits; those who do evil have their names inscribed in the underworld’s ledger of faults. Upon death, the good receive blessings, the evil suffer calamities.

Therefore, all are urged: each year on the first morning of the New Year, wear garments of square colors and fresh robes, gather at the Daoist assembly, have your names recorded on bamboo slips and silk scrolls, and submit them to the heavenly bureau, so as to know the good deeds performed throughout the year. On the first day of each month, attend the Numinous Palace to hear the precepts, to understand the karmic ties and cultivate goodness for the month.

At the place where the precepts are expounded, men and women gather in harmony, sitting together, their hearts fixed on their names, each quietly focused. Sitting, they listen to the speakers, hear the precepts, awaken to the Dao, and realize the patience of non-arising. Those who come to this gate of the Dharma should be jade maidens or golden true ones, their bodies united with the qi of the Dao, bearing the countenance of immortals. Within wondrous words, they hold true faith in the teaching, wishing to hear the Heavenly Venerable expound the precepts, while the earth deities offer precious tributes.

Then arose the heavenly maiden of aspiration, the patient immortal, crowned with stars shining on the head, wearing moonlit robes glowing on the body, holding offerings and bowing in reverence. She spoke the ten supreme vows, which were proclaimed to the assembly:

1. To vow to give up one’s flesh to feed the hungry beasts.  
2. To vow to offer one’s eight fat tissues to burn lamps and keep the light burning.  
3. To vow to exert strength to repay merits and help those bearing burdens.  
4. To vow to give food and clothing to the poor and naked when encountered.  
5. To vow to administer decoctions and medicines to the sick.  
6. To vow to supply what others need at the right time.  
7. To vow to bring joy to those in sorrow according to circumstances.  
8. To vow to substitute oneself for prisoners facing execution.  
9. To vow to assist pregnant women in early relief.  
10. To vow to ensure safe return for those on border expeditions or military garrisons.

Having made these ten vows, tears rained down in sorrow as she addressed the Heavenly Venerable: “Your disciple’s karmic obstacles are truly deep; I wish to hear the wondrous precepts.” The venerable master grieved and was displeased, shedding tears as he said:

“Men and women, your karmic obstacles are especially heavy; to escape the wondrous Dharma is a great cause and condition. I shall now open it, universally saving all sentient beings. But the root foundation of their consciousness is shallow—what can be done? Alas, how painful! To waste one’s life in vain, sinking into the Six Paths. I speak these precepts so that you awaken, turn your hearts, and return to the true Dao. Those with sins should repent; those without should listen silently.”

The Heavenly Venerable told the Most High Dao Lord: “Now we must urge precepts, awaken all beings, resolve disasters and remove calamities for men and women, request blessings and save lives, uproot all suffering. The living shall see the Dao and escape the eight hardships; the dead shall find joy and not traverse the three hells. Entrusting their karma to humans and heavens, they receive supreme honor. Those who cultivate fasting and seek the Dao, turning the wheel as holy kings, should all wholeheartedly request and uphold the ten exhortations. Hear them carefully, never forget, keep them in mind, and do not disturb your spirit; listen quietly and calmly.”

**First Exhortation:** Respect the Three Treasures, offer to the Dharma masters, expound the scriptures, nurture life and teach goodness, act as models for others, uphold worthy teachings and talents, bring honor and glory to your family and clan.

**Second Exhortation:** Copy scriptures and books, have others read and recite them, widely learn wondrous praises, listen to them generation after generation, open the meaning of words, and spread the teachings and verses.

**Third Exhortation:** At the Numinous Temple, cultivate fasting and abstinence, offer sweet delicacies and nourishing meals to worthy sages and saints, repaying their noble favor, with clothing and food naturally provided.

**Fourth Exhortation:** Offer incense and oil, light lamps to shine everywhere, see the flourishing fragrance of the world, purify and brighten the mind, with incomparable beauty and heavenly bearing.

**Fifth Exhortation:** Offer to respected teachers immortal robes and Dharma garments, so that people in the world may live elegantly and freely, not falling into barbarian lands, always born in the central kingdom, with family inheriting crowns, men and women dignified.

**Sixth Exhortation:** Men and women should be filial to parents, respect relatives and friends, care for the weak and support the strong, love those below and pacify those above, so that in the world they receive retribution, and children and nephews become virtuous.

**Seventh Exhortation:** Aid the sick with food, drink, and medicine, compassionately healing and rescuing—the highest field of merit—becoming great medical kings, receiving supreme honor.

**Eighth Exhortation:** Give to the poor, forgo your own clothing and food, so they may be full and warm, prolong life and live in peace, seeing worldly honor and abundant family wealth.

**Ninth Exhortation:** Do not harbor jealousy or envy toward others, always practice restraint in thought, do not make enemies, abandon poisonous hearts, and meet others with joy.

**Tenth Exhortation:** Create images of the Heavenly Venerable and saints for offerings; whether to relieve difficulties or for the dead, those who cast into suffering or encounter calamity shall all be saved and protected.

The Heavenly Venerable said: “These ten exhortations are the essential precepts; they must be faithfully upheld and practiced. Good and evil karmic causes will surely receive their retribution. Those who live in wealth and honor but mock the poor and lowly shall surely receive poverty and lowliness in return. Those who live in beauty but mock the ugly shall surely be repaid with ugliness. Those who live in intelligence but do not teach others shall surely be repaid with folly. Those who live in health but mock the sick shall surely be repaid with lingering illness. Those who live without faith in the Dao and mock the scriptures shall surely be repaid with stubbornness and chaos. Those who live by seizing others’ husbands shall surely be repaid with widowhood. Those who entice others’ wives shall surely be repaid with bachelorhood. Those who vow to be husband and wife but are not born together shall be repaid in the human path. Those who delight in killing life shall surely be repaid with premature death and short lifespan.

Therefore, all are urged: do good and receive good retribution; do evil and suffer evil calamities. Resistance is futile; no one escapes. A person has one heart containing six consciousnesses; acting in good or evil, encountering circumstances and conditions, wisdom opens and passion closes—the true gate does not move, and one attains the immortal Dao.

Further, the six emotional precepts are spoken for the superior among the middle people, who should awaken:

1. The eyes do not gaze widely, disturbed by various bright colors; losing sight and pupil, the vision is dim. At the root of the eyes, one can control the light, and immortals appear in the world.  
2. The ears do not listen confusedly, mixed with the five tones; harming the spirit and losing rectitude, evil sounds wail at the ear root, but one can control music, and immortals appear in the world.  
3. The nose does not breathe broadly; do not mingle with foul odors, stench, and chaotic airs; harming the spirit and stirring desire. At the root of the nose, one can control fragrant accumulations, and immortals appear in the world.  
4. The mouth does not crave flavors, fatty smoke, or mixed tastes; the six entrails rebel, the five organs and spleen and lungs at the root of the tongue. One can control Dharma joy, and immortals appear in the world.  
5. No desires shake the emotions; the body does not receive touch; essence and qi are at peace; guarding the heart is supreme. At the unique root, one can establish wisdom, and immortals appear in the world.  
6. The heart is not disturbed or confused; the mind does not cling to attachments; original nature is empty and serene, clear and steadfast. In all conditions, one can control the Dharma gates, and immortals appear in the world.

The Heavenly Venerable said: “These six roots are the great afflictions of the body. Those born as men and women, though taking human form, have impure six emotions, have not seen the scriptures, nor heard the Dharma sound, and are unaware themselves. They sink into the gates of sin, receive brief lifespans, do not fulfill Heaven’s mandate, and long dwell in evil paths—truly pitiable. Therefore, these precepts are spoken to open and save humans and heavens. With good hearts, respect and faith, return to the Profound, with calm feelings and quiet spirit, their lifespan will be prolonged.

The Supreme Ultimate Perfected One heard the six precepts, attained the six penetrations, rejoiced and leapt with joy, singing praises.

The Heavenly Venerable said: “Good men and women seated here, hearing these praises and holding the precepts without fail, shall surely attain the true Dao. If one praises and recites these precepts, after death they will not be bound by evil karma and will have their sins extinguished.

Furthermore: When illness arises, if one does not properly nurture the body, reckless thoughts cause disasters, clinging to causes and creating sickness, often unaware. This is called confusion among a hundred diseases. I briefly list ten kinds; if you wish to hear their root causes, listen quietly:

1. Poisonous venom killing people is one disease.  
2. Monks wishing death is the second disease.  
3. Lust and bad virtue is the third disease.  
4. Dwelling on past evils is the fourth disease.  
5. Not accepting admonition is the fifth disease.  
6. Being stubborn and self-willed is the sixth disease.  
7. Teaching others to harm is the seventh disease.  
8. Forcibly seizing others’ possessions is the eighth disease.  
9. Habitual self-pity is the ninth disease.  
10. Using power to coerce is the tenth disease.

For these ten diseases, if one wishes to be cured, one must use medicine and trust the method; it will surely be effective.

Weak body and gentle nature is a wondrous medicine; acting with broad heart and harmony is a wondrous medicine.  
Approaching virtue and avoiding lust is a wondrous medicine; not taking ill-gotten wealth is a wondrous medicine.  
Rescuing disasters and aiding difficulties is a wondrous medicine; supporting the old and weak is a wondrous medicine.  
Accepting insult without resentment is a wondrous medicine; restraining anger is a wondrous medicine.  
Avoiding suspicion and doubt is a wondrous medicine; a calm heart and settled mind is a wondrous medicine.

I speak of these wondrous medicines, corresponding to the diseases. Without applying the mind to treatment, death will come suddenly when the time of transmigration arrives. I leave this final word to the world, saying:

The Great Sage’s equal-hearted speech is the true immortal precept.  
It wishes all beings to gather in the hall of myriad blessings.  
Those with blessings akin to heavenly immortals recite the Numinous Treasure precepts.  
On new moons and full moons, they ascend the lion’s throne.  
Upright in body and harmonizing qi, they speak the wondrous scriptures with harmonious voice.  
Pitying those below who do not believe in the supreme precepts,  
They drift again in the sea of suffering, without birth or death, in the wondrous heaven of non-arising.  
Those who hold and receive this precept scripture immediately enter the ranks of immortals and saints.  
Each silently listens, each gradually awakens the Dao heart.

One: The end times will surely come; the world will darken.  
Two: Spread the correct Dharma; virtue will harmonize with Heaven and Earth.  
Three: Follow the wind and rain; open the gate of sweet dew.  
Four: Pity the withered bones; spirit talismans return the soul.  
Five: Honor the ancestors of past generations; bless descendants of future ones.  
Six: Many evil natures transform and give rise to good roots.  
Seven: Reverse short lifespan; extend life and gain longevity.  
Eight: Vast kalpas of sin are all embraced by holy grace.  
Nine: Liberation’s marks remove obstacles and erase blemishes.  
Ten: Gradually accumulate measure and attain the unsurpassed honor.

The Perfected One teaches the precepts: “Why not cultivate and uphold them? Now is the right time; every moment is precious. Do not waste fleeting light. The secret and subtle path is known only by those who practice and realize.”

### Exhortation on Precepts

A person’s life is already fading, like fire in hardened fat.  
The four elements are like branches and leaves; the five aggregates like flowers and fruit.  
In the prime of life, one should diligently study—how can one cling to self and other?  
When blessings end, spirit and consciousness scatter; one should not sit confused in hell.  
The highest sages fear sinking and seek the Dao to cross this calamity.  
The great earth and myriad things all have spirits, relying and supporting one another.  
Ultimately, awaiting the kalpa’s count, blessings end and Heaven and Earth collapse.  
Going back and forth among the Five Paths, coming and going through death and birth.  
Fools do not believe in the Dharma; their sins and pains constantly imprison them.  
If one wishes to cross this calamity, return to the Most High Scripture.  
Expound the supreme wondrous precepts, receive them as the body’s treasure.  
Those who study become addicted to suffering, regretting not having started sooner.  
All should open the profound mysteries; suddenly old age strikes.  
Therefore, even in youth, abandon the world and urgently learn the Dao.

The Heavenly Venerable finished speaking these precepts. At the great assembly were all the heavenly kings, all the celestial hosts, all the kings of nations and their peoples, queens and colorful maidens, empresses and palace attendants, the eight divisions of dragons and gods, the saints of the Ten Directions, Brahma kings and heavenly emperors, all the true ones of the Three Realms, the emperors of the Five Directions, the divine lords of the Four Pillars—such a host beyond naming.

Upon hearing the precept scripture, all attained the true Dao. The blind saw forms, the mute spoke, the lame walked, the deaf heard; all the earth’s sufferers were healed and cured; hell ceased its torment, and they forever left the ghostly paths.

At that time, five thousand scholars, eloquent and learned, chosen as the nation’s worthy and virtuous, sought crowns and honors, turned their hearts to respect the Dao, bowed and returned in faith.

The Heavenly Venerable, moved with compassion, immediately saved and delivered them all, bestowing jade slips, universally granting golden crowns, Dharma robes, and immortal garments. The heavens held offerings, clear streams flowed freely, the azure sky was carefree, they breathed the qi and ate the rosy clouds, rode dragons and controlled cranes.

The great assembly rejoiced, singing praises to the pure void, flying immortals marked their names in secret registers, guided through clouds to the heavenly gate, awakening to the Dao and attaining truth, abiding in stillness and constant joy.

Those who respect the scriptures, believe, receive, and practice thus.
