### The Middle Primordial Jade Register Brief Text — The Grade of Immortals

**On Observing the Master's Protocol:**  
When honoring the master’s protocol, one should burn incense. Anyone cultivating the path of immortality must consider the direction where the scripture master dwells, bow thrice in heart, wishing the master to attain the immortal dao, so that my own body may ascend and transcend.

**On Observing the Master of Records’ Protocol:**  
When honoring the master of records’ protocol, after paying respects to the scripture master, next consider the direction of the master of records, bow thrice in heart, wishing the master to become a flying immortal, to open the way of deliverance for my seven ancestors and grandparents, so that they may swiftly ascend to Heaven, and I may attain the true dao and ascend into the formless.

**On Observing the Deliverance Master’s Protocol:**  
When honoring the deliverance master’s protocol, after paying respects to the master of records, next consider the direction of the deliverance master, bow thrice in heart, wishing the master to ascend and transcend, to mount the high immortals, to open the way of deliverance for my five sufferings and eight hardships, to have my name entered into the immortal register, and to become a true person forever.

**On the Three Masters’ Protocol:**  
When honoring the master’s protocol, the scripture master is the beginning of the scripture, thus it is fitting to establish rites for the Three Treasures’ origin. The master of records is the teacher of the teacher, thus it is fitting to establish rites for the register of life and death. The deliverance master is the master who receives the scripture and delivers me from the difficulties of the Five Paths, thus rites must be established accordingly. If one does not respect the three masters in learning, then the Three Treasures will not descend, the Three Realms will not be reverent, and ghosts and demons will harm the body.

The Heavenly Venerable spoke to the Most High Dao Lord:  
Within the Cavern Profound Numinous Treasure Middle Primordial Palace, the Jade Register Brief Text of the Immortal Grade was formerly divided into three volumes of majestic protocols: Upper Primordial, Middle Primordial, and Lower Primordial, each with eight hundred articles, totaling two thousand four hundred articles. All were inscribed in golden script and jade characters, recorded by the Left Duke of the Immortal Capital in the Middle Primordial Palace. Since the Dragon-Han era, they fell into chaos and confusion; their texts were altered and many incomplete. By the first year of Crimson Brightness, the Supreme Sage compiled and excerpted essentials, eighty articles per volume, two hundred forty articles total, kept secret in the Three Primordial Palaces. Two hundred forty attendants—Jade Blossom Maidens and Golden Morning Jade Youths—burn incense and attend the scriptures, checking and correcting omissions and delays. Following the profound method, transmitted once every forty thousand kalpas. The numinous beings descend to teach; the turning of fate is urgent. The dao requires true persons to descend every four hundred years to teach and transform; within forty years, they listen and transmit thrice. If the time is not fulfilled, the numinous text is lightly proclaimed; the seven ancestors are imprisoned in hell, bearing the wind blades, suffering countless kalpas without reprieve.

The Heavenly Venerable said:  
The natural majestic protocol, the bow and gaze of the myriad heavens, the ritual order of true persons—those who perceive it have countless kalpas of karmic connection. Their former selves have golden registers and jade names within the grade of immortals, destined to attain immortal transcendence. Thus, when one sees this text, one fulfills the true. Those who cultivate it swiftly ride the dragon chariot, ascend the white sun at dawn. Those who honor it, their seven ancestors immediately leave hell, ascend to Heaven, roam freely within the Middle Primordial Jade Immortal Palace. The gates are pure and solemn, untouched by myriad disasters, the Three Realms reverently protect, myriad gods attend the gates. This path is noble and exalted, worthy of secrecy. The Most High bows and performs rites, respectfully presenting these essential words.
