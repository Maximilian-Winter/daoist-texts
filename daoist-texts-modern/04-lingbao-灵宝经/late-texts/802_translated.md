**Title of Scripture:** Scripture of the Most High Profound Cavern Numinous Treasure Lower Origin Yellow Register: Manual of Texts, Dignities, and Ceremonial Protocols. Abbreviated as the *Yellow Register Manual*. Author unknown, likely composed during the Eastern Jin dynasty. It belongs to the ancient *Numinous Treasure Scriptures*.

The following is based on a Dunhuang fragmentary copy.

*(Manuscript P-3148, earlier text missing)*

Within the revealed texts at the central altar, throughout the night there is no wind; the texts do not flutter, thus the perfected one transmits them. If stirred by wind, the person is not yet properly aligned and must not transmit carelessly; to violate the regulations and transgress the law will be investigated by the Bright Brahman Bureau.

The Lower Origin Yellow Register Manual, Spirit Immortal Section, states: When conferring the scripture’s dignities, disciples with sincere faith come to receive the text. All must first be measured by rank to receive the writings. The altar is exposed for one night; if no dark wind arises and the text does not flutter, the bones are deemed lawful. An oath is declared before transmission. If stirred by wind, the disciple must retreat from fasting three times and begin anew according to the original method. If after three such wind disturbances, the person has no prior numinous name or good merit, they will not ascend the Three Realms, nor be protected by the Five Emperors; their bone qi is not aligned, and they must not lightly transmit. This is examined by the Bureau of Correctness.

The Lower Origin Yellow Register Manual, Spirit Immortal Section, states: To receive the scripture’s dignities, the faithful must approach the master and request to receive the scripture’s titles. If the master judges the rank unfit, the transmission of the degree is withheld. The disciple must again retreat into fasting, reflect on their faults, and not expect rapid progress. Otherwise, resentment and anger arise, involving fellow students and provoking wrath against the master’s treasure. This is examined by the Four Brightness Bureau.

The Lower Origin Yellow Register Manual, Spirit Immortal Section, states: To receive the scripture’s dignities, the scripture has grades and order; one must bow and raise the head accordingly, granting according to merit and rank. The wise and the foolish are both accepted in proper sequence, each accorded the numinous canon in turn. One must not omit or abridge, nor misplace weight or lightness. This is examined by the Grand Ceremony Bureau.

The Lower Origin Yellow Register Manual, Spirit Immortal Section, states: To receive the scripture’s dignities, the merit and faith must be fully prepared according to the regulations, pledging allegiance to the Five Emperors and declaring oaths to the various heavens. One must not be stingy or greedy, nor miserly or seeking favors; lacking faith in seeking scriptures or scorning the law and the perfected ones is forbidden. This is examined by the Celestial Supervision Bureau.

The Lower Origin Yellow Register Manual, Spirit Immortal Section, states: To obtain the scripture’s dignities without a master or lineage, without pledging to the Five Mountains or swearing to the heavens, privately exchanging or lending, transmitting degrees to others, the soul and spirit are burdened by the wind blade; the Seven Ancestors are imprisoned by ghost officials, condemned to endless kalpas, and forever without origin. This is examined by the Bureau of Demonic Punishment.

The Lower Origin Yellow Register Manual, Spirit Immortal Section, states: To receive the scripture’s dignities, pledging allegiance to the Five Emperors and swearing to the heavens, one must secretly cultivate to seek response, not lightly divulging or recklessly showing to others the path, scripture titles, or revealing the celestial perfected. This is examined by the Heavenly Oath Bureau.

The Lower Origin Yellow Register Manual, Spirit Immortal Section, states: The merit and dignity lie in reverent ritual toward the Three Treasures, the sacred scriptures, honoring the Three Masters, offering incense and lamps, never slacking in effort. Such merit is raised by the Three Realms, praised by the heavens, recorded in the numinous register among the highest immortal grades. The Seven Ancestors all attain birth in the upper heavens, roaming freely in the Seven Treasures Palace, receiving blessings naturally. Merit is by the Upper Origin Numinous Potency Bureau.

The Lower Origin Yellow Register Manual, Spirit Immortal Section, states: The faults and indignities lie in reviling the Three Treasures and disrespecting the masters and lineage, punished by the earth deities. The body dies by the wind blade, condemned to endless kalpas. The Seven Ancestors fill the night, the world without light. This is examined by the Netherworld Bureau.

The Lower Origin Yellow Register Manual, Spirit Immortal Section, states: The merit and dignity lie in following the master’s law, opening degrees for three disciples; those receiving the law are immediately listed among the meritorious heavens. When merit and name are established, one may mingle with the Three Realms, with the Five Emperors as guests. Merit and numinous name are by the Bright Potency Bureau.

The Lower Origin Yellow Register Manual, Spirit Immortal Section, states: The faults and indignities lie in receiving the law but not opening degrees for disciples; merit is not established, the heavens have no name for them, they may not ascend fasting to recite scriptures, their cultivation lacks dignity, and they are punished by the Three Officials. The soul and spirit scatter, the will is unfocused. This is examined by the Bright Law Bureau.

The Lower Origin Yellow Register Manual, Spirit Immortal Section, states: The merit and dignity lie in following the master’s law, opening degrees for seven disciples; those receiving the law are immediately listed among the meritorious heavens, named among the immortal grades, promoted to the upper Seven Ancestors, ascending to the heavens. Good merit is by the Bright Potency Bureau.

The Lower Origin Yellow Register Manual, Spirit Immortal Section, states: The faults and indignities lie in receiving the law but not opening degrees for disciples; merit is not established, the heavens have no name, thus one may not make the eight solemn vows, petition the Five Emperors, or recite the numinous chapters. Such violations are held by the Three Officials. This is examined by the Bright Law Bureau.

The Lower Origin Yellow Register Manual, Spirit Immortal Section, states: The merit and dignity lie in following the master’s law, opening degrees for nine disciples; those receiving the law are immediately listed among the meritorious heavens, named the White Register. The great merit causes the nine ancestors to ascend together, all freely roaming the Seven Treasures Forest. Merit and name are by the Bright Potency Bureau.

The Lower Origin Yellow Register Manual, Spirit Immortal Section, states: The faults and indignities lie in receiving the law but not opening degrees for disciples; merit is not established, the heavens have no name, thus one may not participate in the three divisions, eight scenes, and twenty perfected; the heavenly immortals ride the upper true officials; merit and name are not established. Lightly receiving the great law is held by the Three Officials, facing the suffering of birth and death. This is examined by the Bright Law Bureau.

The Lower Origin Yellow Register Manual, Spirit Immortal Section, states: The merit and dignity lie in personally receiving the great law, establishing good merit, first for ancestors then for oneself, opening the way for the master, meriting the master’s name among the heavens. Then one may receive a human master and lineage; merit is fulfilled, ascending by day to heaven. Merit is by the Dignity Bureau.

The Lower Origin Yellow Register Manual, Spirit Immortal Section, states: The faults and indignities lie in personally receiving the great law but not establishing good merit for the Three Masters; the master’s name is not listed, the heavens have no merit name; thus the Three Realms do not save human lives, the earth deities do not sever the root of death; without merit, one studies in vain. This is examined by the Nine Capital Bureau.

The Lower Origin Yellow Register Manual, Spirit Immortal Section, states: To observe the scripture’s dignities, if merit is not yet established and the Three Masters have no merit listings, even if the years of receiving the law suffice, when a worthy person requests the law, one must open degrees under the Three Masters’ gate, and the master must measure and grant to disciples. One must not receive rites without merit nor lightly transmit degrees. This is examined by the Bureau of Verification.

The Lower Origin Yellow Register Manual, Spirit Immortal Section, states: To observe the scripture’s dignities, when the master establishes merit and opens degrees for disciples, and merit is full and virtue sufficient, names are listed. If the years of receiving the law are not yet complete, and a worthy person requests the law, the master must present the disciple’s Yellow Register chapter and list merit; once full, then transmission may proceed. If the master does not present, but lightly transmits degrees, the Five Emperors hold this, and birth and death are fully responsible; the sin is equal to leaking the scripture. This is examined by the Four Brightness Bureau.

The Lower Origin Yellow Register Manual, Spirit Immortal Section, states: To observe the scripture’s dignities, if the years are incomplete and one transmits scripture texts, the Three Officials hold this, the body bears the wind blade, death is imprisonment in hell, the Seven Ancestors fill the night, the dark prison lasts kalpas. This is examined by the Four Brightness Bureau.

The Lower Origin Yellow Register Manual, Spirit Immortal Section, states: To observe the scripture’s dignities, when merit and virtue are complete and the years fulfilled, if a worthy person requests to receive, transmission must follow the regulations and not be concealed, nor sever the law’s gate. This is examined by the Great Yin Bureau.

The Lower Origin Yellow Register Manual, Spirit Immortal Section, states: The merit and dignity lie in personally receiving the great law, establishing three hundred good merits; every movement is a cause for great expansion in all things, with a compassionate heart—(text missing).

The Lower Origin Yellow Register Manual, Spirit Immortal Section, states: To observe the scripture’s dignities, one must keep the body pure, fragrant, and flourishing to summon the true swallow. One must not be muddled or turbid, lest the spirits scatter. This is examined by the Supreme Clarity Bureau.

The Lower Origin Yellow Register Manual, Spirit Immortal Section, states: To observe the scripture’s dignities, the great law is without impurity, yet if the body treads in filth and darkness, it does not affect the true; one must not disregard morning rites or ritual law. This is examined by the Pure Heaven Bureau.

The Lower Origin Yellow Register Manual, Spirit Immortal Section, states: To observe the scripture’s dignities, when ascending fasting to recite scriptures, one must bathe with fragrant water, using spirit qi and numinous qi; if spirit qi is not refined, the soul flees and scatters. This is examined by the Spirit Restriction Bureau.
