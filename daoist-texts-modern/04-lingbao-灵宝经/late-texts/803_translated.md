## The Profound Mystery of the Numinous Treasure: The Bright True Code of the Jade Cabinet of the Nine Netherworlds in the Mansion of the Long Night

In the era of the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, within the fragrant forest garden, he gathered seven thousand two hundred and forty disciples, teaching myriad methods and guiding their beings with majestic radiance. Then the Heavenly Worthy unleashed five-colored light, piercing through the heavens to the halls of eternal bliss, illuminating the boundless worlds in the Ten Directions and the hells within the Infinite Realm.

At that time, all the disciples gathered in one place, beholding the men and women of the heavenly bliss halls—good and kind folk, carefree and untroubled, their clothing and food natural and effortless. They also saw the prisoners, exiles, hungry ghosts, and wandering souls within the Infinite Realm’s hells: naked, without garments, their heads and feet shackled; standing upon mountains of knives; bearing iron staffs; chained large and small; their five bodies decayed, no longer human in form. When hungry, they ate charcoal; when thirsty, drank fiery essence; wandering endlessly through the Three Paths and Eight Hardships.

Then the wise disciple closed his eyes, bowed his head to the ground, and addressed the Heavenly Worthy:  
“Today, serving at your seat, I have seen the roots of life and death of good and evil throughout the heavens and hells. My heart trembles with fear; my five spirits grieve and panic. By Heaven’s compassion, I dare to ask: please open the eyes of the ignorant and teach us directly, expounding the profound teachings so that all may understand. In future lives, those who see no codes or precepts will surely tread into the five turbid poisons’ boiling waters, suffering harm and unable to save their bodies. Whether male or female, they will become souls like the prisoners, hungry ghosts, and exiles seen now in hell, endlessly tormented through kalpas without return, ignorant and unresponsive—truly pitiable. I beseech that a clear code of prohibitions and bright true laws be established, so that future beings may create causes for goodness, receiving this great blessing through countless lifetimes, escaping the root of suffering, crossing the Three Paths, and ascending to the heavens.”

The Primordial Heavenly Worthy said:  
“Good, good! Your question strikes deeply. The Bright True Code of the Jade Cabinet of the Nine Netherworlds in the Mansion of the Long Night fully explains the causes and conditions of sin and virtue, the fates of past lives, the retribution of good and evil, the liberation from the root of suffering, the precepts for governing conduct, entering the light, distancing from evil and approaching good, ultimately returning to the gate of blessing. This method is vast and universal, broadly saving Heaven and humanity; bestowing grace over life and death; escaping the Eight Hardships; transcending the Three Realms; receiving natural felicity; rejoicing through countless lifetimes; enjoying endless blessings. Now I reveal it to you; observe it in secrecy.”

The wise disciple stepped forward, bowed deeply on both knees, and addressed the Heavenly Worthy:  
“I do not understand the causes and origins of the good and evil retributions universally seen in the heavenly bliss halls and the Infinite Realm’s hells. By what cultivation in life does one gain flight, roaming carefree in the Upper Clarity, attaining the rank of high immortal? By what cause in life does one’s body dissolve and pass away, extinguishing and ceasing action? By what cause does one die yet not rest, returning again to rebirth? By what cause does one die and supplement the Heavenly Official, the body shining with light? By what cause does one die and ascend to the heavens, becoming a guest of the Most High? By what cause does one die free from bonds, mingling with the Five Emperors? By what cause does one die receiving a title, becoming a spirit on earth? By what cause does one die becoming a saint, steering clouds? By what cause does one die ascending to the bliss halls, clothed and fed naturally? By what cause does one die ascending to the Southern Palace, then reborn among humans? By what cause does one die entering hell, enduring the endless long night? By what cause does one die suffering the poison of Chu, a thousand pains upon the body? By what cause does one die without food, among hungry ghosts? By what cause does one die experiencing separation, the body broken and torn? By what cause does one die filling the prisons, wandering the Three Officials? By what cause does one die entering boiling waters, no longer human? By what cause does one die circling sword trees, the wind knives cutting back and forth? By what cause does one’s head and face burn, wearing a fiery mountain? By what cause does one’s body lack clothing, bearing an iron staff? By what cause is one’s body shaved and cut, bearing stones without rest? By what cause does one die shackled, confined in the Three Lights? By what cause is one driven relentlessly, eating and resting without peace? By what cause is one’s tongue pulled out, pierced with an iron spike? By what cause does one die drawing water from the abyss, pouring it into the Four Rivers?”

“Now seeing such beings in hell, what offenses in life caused these punishments? The souls and spirits suffer such pain—how many years until liberation? On the day of release, will they be reborn as beasts, returning to human form? I wish to distinguish and explain these life roots, to speak of future lives and create causes for goodness. If enlightened, I shall receive the sacred grace.”

The Heavenly Worthy then summoned the flying celestial spirits from the Ten Directions, opening the Jade Cabinet of the Nine Netherworlds in the Mansion of the Long Night, revealing the Bright True Code to save the disciples. At that moment, the great saints of the heavens, the primordial revered gods, immortal jade maidens, countless as the stars, came together at the seat. The heavens showered fragrant flowers; divine dragons played music; flying songs spread in all directions; jade tones flowed smoothly; the sky was bright and clear, free of haze; the sun children poured essence; the moon maidens scattered blossoms; streams of light converged, illuminating the heavens; the hundred harmonies washed away filth; divine winds swept dust; rivers and seas lay hidden; mountains swallowed smoke; dragon scales leapt; gods and humans rejoiced universally; life and death opened to peace; blessings and felicity flourished; the five sufferings were released; the nine netherworlds pardoned souls; long exiles loosened their bonds; ascending to heaven’s bliss halls. Men and women rejoiced, eternal happiness blossomed; the heavens praised and listened to the secret words.

Then the seven thousand two hundred and forty heavenly disciples all simultaneously praised: “Good!” The flying celestial spirits spoke of the fourteen categories of bad deeds and their retributions, the unbroken causes of evil roots.

## The Supreme Grade of Liberation from the Jade Cabinet of the Nine Netherworlds in the Mansion of the Long Night

The Most High Dao Lord stepped forward, bowed, and addressed the Heavenly Worthy:  
“Today at your seat, I have seen the disciples receiving majestic radiance, universally illuminating the heavenly bliss halls and the Infinite Realm’s hells; the retribution of good and evil, the difference of suffering and joy. The good rejoice in peace, carefree without end; the evil suffer torment, wandering the Eight Hardships, no longer human in form—truly pitiable. Such retribution, receiving evil causes, endlessly enduring kalpas, ignorant of life roots, unaware if merit exists to redeem and liberate the dead souls; to release them from the long night of the Nine Netherworlds; to enter the light; to be reborn in the gate of blessing. If granted compassion, bearing the grace of life and death, the departed at leisure and joy; seeing the world flourish; wealth and prosperity blazing; long life; shading the eight directions; wind scattering orchid forests; future men and women hearing the dharma sound; I only wish the Heavenly Worthy to distinguish and explain; to impart the secret words; so all may see the clear code and find peace.”

The Heavenly Worthy told the Most High Dao Lord:  
“Hear carefully my words; think well and seal them in your heart; remember morning and night; do not forget. Now I explain the wondrous sound for you to rely on and use; redeeming sinful souls; opening the long night; the Nine Netherworlds and Eight Hardships; past burdens lifted; turning into faith roots; life and death joy; causes through lifetimes. This method is sublime; passed down once in myriad kalpas; the world has sages and wise ones; I swear and declare. Secretly, blessings descend; if revealed, calamities arise. The wind knife’s precept is told in the Bright True Code; violate the code and do not blame the heavens.”

Then the Heavenly Worthy commanded the flying celestial spirits to speak of the supreme grade of sin and virtue causes and liberation. When the scripture was spoken, the sun, moon, and stars of the heavens shone brightly, illuminating the Nine Earths and Infinite World, the long night mansion of the Nine Netherworlds. The long exiles, hungry ghosts, and dead souls received light; universally seeing their life roots; then awakening; simultaneously turning hearts; all made to think of good; recalling the gate of blessing; the five sufferings released; the Three Paths transformed; past burdens lifted; hells peaceful. At that time men and women universally heard the dharma sound; those with heart prepared; all attained immortality.

The flying celestial spirits said:  
The Jade Cabinet of the Nine Netherworlds in the Mansion of the Long Night redeems dead souls’ sins of the supreme grade. Regularly on the first, third, fifth, seventh, ninth, and eleventh months of the year; on the first, eighth, fourteenth, fifteenth, eighteenth, twenty-third, twenty-fourth, twenty-eighth, twenty-ninth, and thirtieth days of each month—ten days per month; also on the eight seasonal festivals; on the days of Jiazi and Gengshen. At home, place a long lamp, nine feet high; on one lamp light nine lamps; each shining brightly; illuminating the Nine Mysterious Heavens’ bliss halls above; below illuminating the Nine Earths of the Infinite World’s long night. Following proper ritual and method, open and invite heavenly and earthly immortals, true immortals and flying immortals, sun, moon, stars, Nine Palaces, Five Emperors, Five Mountains, Three Rivers, Four Seas’ armies, each with nine hundred million riders; the thirty-two heavens’ supervisors of fasting and ceremonies; incense attendants, golden youths, flower-scattering jade maidens; Five Emperors’ direct talismans, each with thirty-two persons; messengers reporting affairs, flying dragons and riders, all coming together to oversee the fasting hall; lighting incense and making vows; responding orally and thoroughly; when the ritual is complete, all return to the heavenly palace. By day burn incense; by night light lamps; keep incense smoke unceasing; expose scriptures in the courtyard; under the nine lamps, circle the lamps, perform the Dao; offer incense and vows; then face east and make nine bows, saying:

“I, A, now take refuge in the Eastern Infinite Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy, the already attained great saints, the most true lords and elders, the Nine Qi Heavenly Lords, and the Eastern District’s numinous officials. Now I establish this fast, burn incense and light lamps, wishing that by this merit, the heavens be illuminated; universally for emperors, kings, lords, officials, and commoners; dharma masters; honored parents and kin; fellow disciples; hermits in mountains and forests cultivating the true Dao; all beings crawling, flying, writhing, creeping, and resting; all beings universally freed from the ten sufferings and eight hardships; long dwelling in non-action; universally crossing naturally. My family’s countless ancestors and prior souls imprisoned; open all light; all gain liberation; turn into faith roots; leave the Five Paths; open causes for liberation; the dead rejoice long; the living receive grace; the world peaceful; Dao and virtue flourishing. Now I burn incense; I take refuge in the masters, great saints, and most true virtues; after attaining the Dao, ascend into the formless; merge with the Dao and truth.”

Finished, remove the kerchief, knock head to ground, and rub cheeks, each eighty-one times, then stop.

Next face south and make three bows, saying:

“I, A, now take refuge in the Southern Infinite Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy, the already attained great saints, the most true lords and elders, the Three Qi Heavenly Lords, and the Southern District’s numinous officials. Now I establish this fast, burn incense and light lamps, wishing that by this merit, the heavens be illuminated; universally for emperors, kings, lords, officials, and commoners; dharma masters; honored parents and kin; fellow disciples; hermits in mountains and forests cultivating the true Dao; all beings crawling, flying, writhing, creeping, and resting; all beings universally freed from the ten sufferings and eight hardships; long dwelling in non-action; universally crossing naturally. My family’s countless ancestors and prior souls imprisoned; open all light; all gain liberation; turn into faith roots; leave the Five Paths; open causes for liberation; the dead rejoice long; the living receive grace; the world peaceful; Dao and virtue flourishing. Now I burn incense; I take refuge in the masters, great saints, and most true virtues; after attaining the Dao, ascend into the formless; merge with the Dao and truth.”

The flying celestial spirits said:  
The Bright True Code’s section on redeeming countless ancestors’ past sins and evil roots—if one practices the Dao according to the dharma, then the Nine Netherworlds open; long exiles and dead souls receive light; the great compassionate Dao; boundless fields of blessing. Bowing and worshiping with humility and thanks, with words of submission; when heart and intention are sincere and earnest; naturally feeling the response; body weary and unable to be drawn; one may sincerely worship Heaven’s truth without trouble from bending and bowing. If outwardly adorned but heart lazy, one only tires the body in worship. Faithful practitioners, heart and mouth aligned; lighting incense and making vows; already penetrating the heavens; life and death sins and retributions all scattered. This merit is very great; revered by the Three Realms; blessings towering; hard to describe.

The Most High Dao Lord bowed and addressed the Heavenly Worthy:  
“Now hearing the flying celestial spirits speak of the supreme grade of sin and virtue causes and liberation, I respectfully request to offer thanks, explain past roots, so that future men and women may receive this grace, universally gaining liberation, entering the light; being good thus. Yet there are other regions; I wonder if Heaven has great calamities; the nation’s fate unstable; stars and constellations erring; the four qi abnormal; armies and bandits; sickness and disaster; emperors uneasy; poisons and plagues spreading; Heaven and humans dying and injured. What dharma should be made to avert these calamities; redeem and liberate from hardship; resolve all misfortunes? I wish for your gracious decree, so that practice may be possible; harmonizing Heaven and calming Earth; assisting the nation and establishing merit. If this instruction is seen, grace will spread to the Ten Directions; the nation’s fate stable; emperors prosperous; the world joyful and peaceful; blessings endless; future lives universally hearing the dharma sound.”

Then the Heavenly Worthy told the flying celestial spirits to speak of the supreme grade of sin and virtue causes and liberation, saving the nation from disaster, disease, and calamity. What is not yet complete may be fully completed and reported to the Most High Dao Lord, one by one, so those who have not seen may see, those who have not heard may hear, universally teaching all, causing all to see the light. Then it was spoken, and the sacred words received well.

The flying celestial spirits said:  
The method of the Jade Cabinet of the Nine Netherworlds in the Mansion of the Long Night: for emperors, kings, nations facing sickness, plagues, armies, and grave calamities, write the five chapters of the Numinous Treasure True Text on cinnabar; place five altars in the courtyard, one altar for each of the Five Directions; on each altar place one chapter of the True Text. Above place five taels of gold; one tael made into a dragon; five taels divided into five dragons to stabilize the five chapters. Also use five-colored patterned silk as a token to stabilize the Five Emperors; those with calamities carry purple patterned silk yearly; redeeming life and calming the nation’s fate; averting heavenly disasters; stars and constellations aligned. In spring burn nine lamps; or ninety lamps; or nine hundred lamps. In summer burn three lamps; or thirty lamps; or three hundred lamps. In autumn burn seven lamps; or seventy lamps; or seven hundred lamps. In winter burn five lamps; or fifty lamps; or five hundred lamps. For the months of the four seasons burn twelve lamps; or one hundred and twenty lamps; or one thousand two hundred lamps. Also place one long lamp, nine feet high; on top place nine lamps in the center; illuminating the long night mansion of the Nine Netherworlds clearly. The great dharma master in the center, hair loose and disheveled, according to the secret instructions, applies cinnabar; prays and repents six times daily; performs rites in the courtyard. If pure and faithful men and women assist the nation in prayer, they should scatter hair outside the gate, apply cinnabar, and present petitions. In spring for nine days and nights; summer three days and nights; autumn seven days and nights; winter five days and nights; four seasons twelve days and nights. Arrange lights to illuminate the heavens and Infinite World’s long night; then the Nine Netherworlds open and clear; light enters endlessly; the Three Lights shine brightly; Heaven and Earth peaceful; stars and constellations return; four seasons harmonious; all disasters vanish; armies and diseases cease; Heaven and humans rejoice; the nation’s fate prospers. When the practice day ends, burn the True Text and scatter the blue smoke.

The flying celestial spirits said:  
The dharma master enters through the earth gate, lights incense, circles incense lamps three times, returns facing east, and knocks teeth thirty-six times, then speaks the ritual.

Next, the ritual continues:

The Supreme Three Heavens Mysterious Primordial Beginning Three Qi Most High Dao Lord summons from within the servant’s body the three and five merit officials, left and right officers and messengers, left and right incense-bearing courier dragons and riders, incense attendants golden youths, messengers jade maidens, the Five Emperors’ direct talisman bearers, each thirty-six persons. Those who emerge are solemnly dressed, opening and closing the land’s four true officials. The servant now properly burns incense and practices the Dao, wishing that the true qi of the Ten Directions enter the servant’s body; the opening swiftly reaching; directly approaching the Most High Infinite Great Dao Supreme Jade Emperor’s presence.

My ancestors from generation to generation, until this body; born into scriptures and teachings; always dwelling in blessings; merit slight and virtue little; not yet able to become immortal; with exhausted will I take refuge; assisting the nation to establish merit. Now the nation’s land is disharmonious; armies and diseases arise; yin and yang opposing; stars and constellations erring; calamities heavy and grave; such matters. Some fear emperors receiving Heaven’s heavenly blessing; overseeing the people; not fully extending grace; widely nourishing the Ten Directions; making Heaven and humans abundant; rejoicing in national peace; yet no songs or chants; the path silent; thus the Three Lights darkened; great disasters spreading; emperors anxious; people without peace. Now carefully following the great dharma, revealing the true text; burning incense and lighting lamps; illuminating the heavens; swearing to act; practicing the Dao to thank for disasters; wishing to invite heavenly armies of nine hundred million riders; earthly immortals’ armies of nine hundred million riders; true immortals’ armies of nine hundred million riders; flying immortals’ armies of nine hundred million riders; divine beings’ armies of nine hundred million riders; sun and moon armies of nine hundred million riders; star armies of nine hundred million riders; Nine Palaces armies of nine hundred million riders; Five Emperors armies of nine hundred million riders; Five Mountains armies of nine hundred million riders; Three Rivers and Four Seas armies of nine hundred million riders; the Thirty-two Heavens’ fasting supervisors, incense attendants golden youths, flower-scattering jade maidens, Five Emperors’ direct talisman bearers, each thirty-two persons; messengers reporting affairs, flying dragons and riders, all coming together to oversee the fasting hall; lighting incense and making vows; responding orally and thoroughly; when the ritual is complete, those diligent in merit speak of merit to the immortal officials.

Now burning incense; taking refuge in the masters, great saints, and most true virtues; after attaining the Dao, ascending into the formless; merging with the Dao and truth.”

The number of days for practicing the Dao is flexible. Though there are four seasonal days, following the Five Phases’ cycle, even three days and three nights of earnest request, the sincere heart will be fully felt by the heavens. Practitioners may measure and act accordingly.

The flying celestial spirits said:  
For emperors and kings, averting disasters and redeeming hardship, use five-colored patterned silk, sized according to the direction. Dragons use superior gold; official silk uses purple patterns; dharma of the heavenly family is weighty.
