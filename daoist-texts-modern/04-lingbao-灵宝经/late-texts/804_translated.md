## Scripture of the Most High Profound Numinous Treasure: Wisdom, Steadfastness, and Subtle Penetration

At that time, the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Venerable dwelt in stillness within the Profound Capital of Primordial Yang, in the Palace of the Seven Treasures of the Purple Tenuity. His spirit was serene and vast, silent and effortless. Within the Purple Tenuity Palace, light shone both inside and out, illuminating boundlessly. The hundred harmonies of precious incense burned without fire, its fragrant radiance entwining and gathering, surging to fill the void, drifting and flowing endlessly, scattering without limit. The adornment of light was far-reaching and lush, soft and moist with coolness—cool, wondrous, and elegant—beyond words or inscriptions. The great music of Heaven’s balance arose, myriad melodies intertwining.

Suddenly, the Heavenly Venerable, at first without glance or gaze, pondered the origin of the myriad transformations. From the very beginning, the embryo and endowment were one; each formed by the swirling vaporous qi, condensing into spirit. Spirit was originally pure and clear, tranquil and without admixture. Once it was granted a corporeal form, the form became stained by the six emotions. Once the six emotions were stained, their stirring brought corruption and filth, bewildering what was seen, obscuring what was grasped. The affairs of the world and conditions followed in order. They summoned and attracted guilt and defilement, accumulating through lifetimes, revolving in the Three Realms, drifting and forgetting to return; cycling through the Five Paths, sinking long and never awakening. Enfolded in pain and poison, unable to know oneself, the spirit raced in fear, treading only in guilt. Compassion arose in his heart, ceaseless and profound. Recalling the initial endowment, the principle was truly pitiable. Thus he sent forth his attendants, summoning the Left Profound Perfected and the Right Profound Perfected. In a moment, the two Perfected Ones stood and came forward, bowed their heads in reverence, then took their seats. After a long wait, the Heavenly Venerable spoke plainly.

Then the Heavenly Venerable said: “The meaning of this mutual suffering I now wish to reach. I have long pondered the origin of the myriad sources as such. Such principles can still be saved. You two virtuous ones have already awakened great compassion and great mercy; should you not also share this purpose?” The two Perfected replied: “The myriad multitudes are mired in ruin, always in their own towns, each already acting. The teachings of instruction are twisted and detailed, fully explaining sins and blessings, reaching the utmost in principle. Yet there remain the obstinate, ignorant, and foolish, who never believe. Even if they have slight faith, they falter at once, and before a month passes, they grow lax again. This too is what the Heavenly Venerable’s great insight has selected. What then shall be done?”

The Heavenly Venerable said: “Though they falter, a single faith at the time is no light blessing. You two virtuous ones have planted this merit and should encourage it.” The two Perfected said: “We do not know what method to use to cause them to awaken.”

The Heavenly Venerable answered: “These people are dark and confused. If shown a broad path, with many words and scattered matters, their wisdom cannot bear it. Their wisdom cannot bear it, causing laxity of heart. Now I wish to present the essential matters in simple words, precisely to show them; this will be different.” The two Perfected then stepped down, bowed to the Heavenly Venerable, and said: “We do not know what matters are simple and essential to open their awakening.”

The Heavenly Venerable said: “You both return to your seats. I will tell you the essential formula of subtle reflection and steadfast resolve. The essentials are simple and easy; to gain awakening from simplicity, is this not joyful?” The two Perfected asked: “Is there a scripture for subtle reflection and steadfast resolve?”

The Heavenly Venerable said: “There are no characters at all.” The two Perfected said: “This disciple hits a wall, a bottomless great ignorance. Without characters, how can one gain awakening?”

The Heavenly Venerable answered: “At this moment, all scriptures originally have characters. Today’s words are also scripture, are they not?” The two Perfected said: “We earnestly wish to hear, and will immediately write it down.”

The Heavenly Venerable said: “Imagine there are people, perhaps a thousand or ten thousand, who desire to obtain precious treasure. They hear that the great sea holds vast riches, so each prepares vessels, boats or ships, a thousand or a hundred, sailing on the great sea, sometimes a thousand or ten thousand miles, sometimes near or far. There are hundreds of islets and countless islands, some in the water, many treasures therein, even limitless Seven Treasures’ essence and light, their radiance surging to the heavens, colors both diverse and alike. The many ships and companions, when the wind is about to rise, those who cannot recognize the light set sail, unaware of where they are headed.”

The Heavenly Venerable further said: “Can these ships and companions obtain the treasure?”

The two Perfected said: “Without a guide, without one who knows beforehand, and not recognizing the treasure’s light, they wander about in vain. This journey is very difficult. They must arrive everywhere, dig everywhere, sometimes exerting a billionfold effort underwater, and perhaps then they may succeed.”

The Heavenly Venerable said: “Those who study the dao but do not obtain the essential formula of subtle reflection and steadfast resolve are like these people, unable to recognize the treasure’s light yet desiring the treasure. How can one not pity them?”

The Heavenly Venerable further said: “Among such a crowd, suddenly there is one who is adept at recognizing the treasure’s light. The treasure’s light surges to the heavens, visible from ten thousand miles away, as if held in the palm. Though many are present, none can see it but the adept one. The adept one raises the sail and departs first; the many ships follow, directly reaching the treasure. All obtain the famous Seven Treasures, each fully laden, returning to their origin. The companions say: ‘Thanks to the guide, now we must repay the grace.’ Thus each ship gathers treasure, valued at billions, rightly repaying the kindness. Is this not joyful?” The two Perfected said: “What benefit is greater than this?”

The Heavenly Venerable said: “Those who study the dao and obtain this essential formula of subtle reflection and steadfast resolve are exactly like the one who recognizes the treasure’s light.”

The Heavenly Venerable further said: “In ancient times, countless kalpas ago, when the reign of the Heavenly King ended and the world was to be renewed, a heavenly token appeared, and whoever obtained it became the Son of Heaven. At that time, a good physiognomist saw a mountain emitting this token’s light. That very night, the heavens poured heavy rain, torches could not stand, the light shone dimly, yet people could not see it. The physiognomist spoke among the crowd to the villagers: ‘The Son of Heaven’s token is in this mountain.’ The villagers heard and secretly went, but in the dimness could not obtain it. The physiognomist, hearing that people could not see the token, went himself and immediately obtained it, then ascended to the heavenly throne. If one obtains this essential formula of subtle reflection and steadfast resolve, the mind will be steady and the search for the dao will be exact, like that physiognomist who was skilled in treasures. Do not lightly reveal it; those who lightly reveal it incur the guilt of guarding and harming it, a sin difficult to atone. Therefore, it is not only disrespecting the scripture but also disrespecting the dao. Those who receive and study it, be cautious, be cautious.” The two Perfected heard this and rejoiced greatly, their hearts responding in accord, only wishing to hear more.

The Heavenly Venerable said: “Therefore, desiring to inform, how could I conceal it? I say it is an essential formula. Know that within the Three Realms, the three times are all empty. Knowing the three times are empty, though there is a body, all should return to emptiness. Understanding the principle of returning to emptiness, one can forget the body. One who can forget the body, how can they still love the body? Once the body is unloved, one can love nothing at all, only the dao. Those who love the dao, the dao also loves them. Those who obtain the dao and love it, this is truly returning to the real. Subtle reflection and steadfast resolve, the principle is all here. This is returning from two halves to one, the original one, returning to truth. The dao’s work rises daily. Are we then not free from worry and toil?”

The Heavenly Venerable further said: “The meaning of two halves becoming one has five aspects. Do you know them?” The two Perfected replied: “We know. Is it not that from the pure and empty qi, through the mingling of vapors, the halves descend and divide, and from these four halves, one is formed? Is it not that some falsely unite these as one to do evil, thereby attracting the natural qi and sinking into the Three Paths? Is it not that for good, one separates from these four halves, ascends to the Great Void, returns to the pure empty qi, restores the two halves, and dwells in nature?”

The Heavenly Venerable said: “You have grasped it. Now I will show the diagram of the two halves revolving, displayed in the void before the Left Profound Perfected.”

### Diagram of the Two Halves

Also called the True Seal of Subtle Reflection and Steadfast Resolve.

The ritual requires twenty-four thousand coins, five taels of pure gold, one length each of five-colored patterned silk scarves, five taels of plain silk, one bolt each of five-direction patterned brocade, one bright mirror, one bolt of life-patterned brocade, one remainder of yearly calculation, and one pair of golden buttons. Nearly a thousand kinds of items. The recipient must have a certificate. The twelve-fold transmission must be clear and complete; failure to transmit fully violates the rules and quadruples the sin. If the recipient’s faith is insufficient and qi is too low, they also incur sin equal to violating the transmission rules. Cold-dwelling daoists are not counted.

Disciple So-and-so of the Upper Clarity, bearing the certificate as prescribed, receives the essential formula, shall with steadfast heart withdraw half and return to the original, not losing the soul in vain, taking the elixir with full faith. The two Perfected said: “This is truly the essence, only now enlightened, such wondrous meaning appears, long unawakened. We cannot sufficiently thank the Heavenly Venerable’s grace and burden.”

The Heavenly Venerable said: “Though you have this formula, you must base yourself on the Ten Precepts.” After granting the two halves formula, next comes the Ten Precepts. The ritual master sits facing south; the disciple bows three times and says: “I wish to see accomplishment, receive the Ten Precepts, and vow to uphold them for life, daring not to violate.” Then kneeling long, with heart mindful of the great saints in the Ten Directions above, bows and solemnly accepts. The master burns incense and then expounds the precepts:

1. Do not kill; always remember all living beings.

2. Do not commit sexual misconduct; do not violate others’ wives.

3. Do not steal; do not take what is not rightfully yours.

4. Do not deceive; distinguish well between good and evil.

5. Do not become intoxicated; always consider pure conduct.

6. Harmonize with kin and relatives; have no estrangement.

7. When seeing others do good deeds, rejoice and assist with heart.

8. When seeing others in sorrow, help them make merit.

9. When others harm me, I intend not to retaliate.

10. For all who have not attained the dao, I hold no expectation.

These are the Ten Precepts. The recipient says: “Disciple So-and-so receives and will uphold them for life.” Then bows to the master; all is complete.

The Heavenly Venerable said: “Those who can receive these Ten Precepts and practice according to the method will be protected by the Heavenly Officials of the Ten Directions and surely attain the dao. If you face worldly burdens and cannot fully uphold all ten, then choose those you can uphold, nine, eight, seven, six, even down to five. Yet the blessings of the five precepts are still hard to describe. You should widely exhort the multitudes weighed down by defilement to hear this. If they do not rejoice, and still do not loosen one or two knots, but remain twisted in awakening, and again grow lax, their suffering lengthens daily, due to deep sin. What then can be done?” The two Perfected said: “If there are good people who wish to diligently cultivate, this matter is fortunate and idle. What else is there? The quest for the dao will be swifter.”

The Heavenly Venerable said: “The universal teaching rituals are hidden in the Three Registers and the Three Primal Precepts. The Three Registers are the root of many scriptures, already out of the world, and should also descend mutually.” The two Perfected said: “Are the Three Registers the Golden Register, Jade Register, and Yellow Register?”

The Heavenly Venerable said: “Yes, yes. These are teachings beyond form. The utmost principle of subtle reflection and steadfast resolve is to know the wondrous awakening of the Three Primes as non-dual. There is dao and hell; pray to the Seven Profound Sufferings; also save those unseen.” At that time, someone in the upper air recited:

> This method is truly profound and wondrous,  
> Freeing you from the toil of nine ancestors.  
> Those who do not grant it, separate others from the dao.  
> Not human but eager to grant,  
> In the world they are judged and punished.  
> After death, they fall to the Three Paths’ sufferings,  
> Repenting for countless kalpas is of no use.

The reason this verse was made in the void was to prevent fools from obtaining the scripture and then despising it, or borrowing it to copy, or raising it to beg from others. Thus those with heart and faith find no place; the bridge of the method is broken. Therefore, be even more cautious, be even more cautious. At that time, the two Perfected thought: “This essential formula shines clearly; hearing it is profound awakening. The previous and later words are redundant and do not open understanding. What sort of thing is this?”

Then the Heavenly Venerable perceived the two Perfected’s thoughts and replied: “Do you two virtuous ones know? All good and evil have causes and conditions and should be received from me. That is why. Listen quietly as I explain. Long ago, countless past kalpas, there was a virtuous and faithful daoist named Le Jingxin, a great wealthy man beyond reckoning. He deeply believed in dao and virtue, dwelling in stillness and contemplation. His heart and mouth swore: ‘I am so rich; this is all blessing. I bear Heaven and Earth and must repay their grace.’ His heart to repay was truly deep, yet he did not know how. From outside his resting place, he asked his wife and told her all. ‘The dao does not need wealth; what then shall we do?’ His wife said: ‘The dao arises from the heart; where can it be sought? We should provide what the daoists lack. If the daoists have their own fasting and precepts, and promote dao affairs, is this not repaying grace?’ Hearing his wife’s words, he agreed and his heart opened to awakening.

At that time, there was a daoist in the southern mountains who fasted long and dwelt in the hills, constantly reciting scriptures, two hundred li from Jingxin’s home. Jingxin had long heard of this person and often longed for him. He said to his wife: ‘I will go there, ask what is lacking, and supply accordingly. I will ensure surplus, not allowing scarcity, and also send small gifts.’ His wife said: ‘If you can do so, that is truly good. Even on my deathbed, I have support. If not, when dead and spirit gone, there will be no mercy.’ Jingxin opened his mixed storehouses, took out fine incense, white felt cloth, good cotton and silk, bedding, tents, playthings, clothing, gold, silver, copper vessels—all fine and exquisite—and various medicines, all manner of things. He prepared ten servants and packed ten loads, going to the daoist’s place. He spoke plainly and gave the gifts, including the ten servants’ leader to sweep and clean. The daoist accepted and Jingxin departed, reporting all to his wife. Hearing the daoist accepted, the couple rejoiced beyond measure.

From then on, it became their custom. In a short time, Jingxin and his wife had a son named Fajie, aged seventeen. He cared for his parents in illness. When they neared death, they said to their son: ‘We have this abundant wealth, immeasurable riches, all from the dao. We swear to repay this boundless grace. The dao does not need wealth, only that you support the daoists. Recently, I entered the mountains and saw their affairs; this you have seen. Now the family wealth is enough for you to use; do not waste it.’ Fajie wept with sobs and lamentations, crying to Heaven, falling and rising, breath failing and returning, holding his parents and weeping. He said: ‘Father, mother, you have such blessings. Approaching death, your goodness does not retreat. Though Heaven’s dao is distant, how could it not respond? I only wish you ascend to the hall of blessings, attain the highest honor. When I die, we will surely meet, together in the dao position.’ Then his parents passed away. Fajie cried out and fainted; after a long time he revived. Because of the harmony of the family’s hearts and conduct, though the daoist was foremost, he also helped kin and village, benefiting near and far.

At that time, relatives and strangers, near and far, all hastened to visit. The household servants were many. Seeing Fajie with his parents’ elders, his filial heart was clear, and vows were made. All looked upon one another, tears flowing uncontrollably. Such a fortunate person, what of his fate? Later, Fajie reverently turned toward the dao, naturally adding respect and service, supporting daoists, rescuing the poor, aiding travelers, and countless beings, hundreds of times more than before. No extraneous income was taken; expenses were broad, leading to poverty. He wished to support daoists without interruption, but as the daoists aged and had no other means, he burned incense daily, recalling the master who supported them, thus falling into poverty. He only wished Heaven’s dao would accept his sincere heart. Now old and worn, how can he repay?

The daoist always practiced the Way at six times on the last day of the month, constantly recalling Fajie in his heart. Thus he sent a message, calling Fajie: ‘You bow to your master; on this month’s last day, follow the usual six times practice, needing nothing more; come to meet and join in merit. Though blessings are vast and distant, they should not be neglected.’ Fajie received the message joyfully and replied: ‘Fajie bows; the daoist’s arrival on the appointed day will be served.’ After the message left, he checked the household food, granaries, and storerooms—all were empty, nothing to carry.

Recalling his father’s final teaching, his grief deepened. He sought to sell the house. The house was tall and broad, not for common men but fit for a heavenly king. The heavenly king himself had a palace there. Some said the house’s fortune was exhausted; others said it was ominous. No buyers came. He wished to sell but feared losing access to the mountains and the daoists. Fajie and his wife lived there with two sons, the elder Yinzhu aged eleven, the younger Yinyin, privately called Anu, just eight years old. Both were handsome beyond compare, their breathing and chanting voices like jade sounds. Their manners and bearing were virtuous and abundant. Though young, they diligently cultivated, responding to near and far, honoring kin and strangers, skilled in calligraphy and speech, always outstanding. Their aunt was very wealthy but had no sons, always delighted in these boys. With no other brothers, she wished to have one to help her, hiring a hundred thousand coins, coveting the boys, caring not for the money.

Fajie suddenly realized and asked his wife: ‘I once heard your sister favored my son; is this true?’ His wife did not know his meaning and quickly replied: ‘Better we all die than sell our son before our eyes. Selling a son to survive only adds sorrow. That is death, no reason.’ He said: ‘I do not sell the son to feed mouths or bodies.’ She said: ‘Then for what?’ He said: ‘The daoists in the mountains lack support. Did you forget my vow to serve our ancestors?’ His wife wiped tears, knelt, and said: ‘Though impoverished, it is truly in the heart. If so, this is also our ancestors’ teaching. How can we not do so?’ She said: ‘If the ritual is neglected, we should take the son to report to your sister.’ Mother and son prepared to leave. The son knelt to his father and said: ‘I must leave your knees and care, though reluctant. I hope you will see me now and then.’ Their natures stirred within; they embraced and wept. Anu and grandfather, moved to the heavens and earth, Yinzhu held his brother’s head, weeping long: ‘Blessings and virtue, I too will not be long. Words cannot express it.’ Seeing his brothers so, the father’s heart was troubled. Fearing his wife’s regret, he said: ‘Now go to your aunt, pledge one hundred thousand coins as a monthly term, hoping to sell the house and redeem the son. If not redeemed by then, he will remain with your aunt. This is to ease parting.’ Thus severing ties, mother and son departed.

The mother arrived at her sister’s and explained the pledge and son’s intent. The sister rejoiced greatly, gave fifty thousand coins, and sent three carts to carry the sister and money back. Yinyin knelt to his mother and said: ‘Father has done this merit; he will attain the dao. Before that, I hope grandfather and grandmother see you now and then.’ Yinyin wished to comfort his aunt but held back tears. When his mother boarded the carriage to depart, though far apart, mother, son, and aunt wept together, a hundred streams of rain. Yinyin knelt to his aunt and said: ‘Now I am your son, no different from your own. All separations are hard to bear; please forgive me. I wish to borrow ten thousand coins to give father, sent separately by grandmother’s carriage.’ The aunt pitied the boy’s feelings and respected him more. She then gave ten thousand more, saying: ‘With this you may do as you wish.’ Yinyin knelt and said: ‘Too much money. I tell mother I will use sixty thousand to support grandfather and grandmother, morning and evening. This is my humble offering, not for other use. Two thousand will be given to my brother, wishing him diligent support and remembrance. The rest, twenty thousand, will be sent to the mountain daoists, wishing my parents, brothers, and aunt to share blessings. I do not speak of common meetings, fearing to offend my aunt’s feelings.’ The mother returned home, recalling her son. The brothers cherished each other greatly, sharing food and play, never eating alone. One day, separating, one said: ‘Now I return alone for blessings.’ Yinzhu behind was deeply worried. Hearing his mother had much money returned but knowing his brother did not return, he wiped tears, covered his face, and knelt asking his mother: ‘Did aunt and I part with such crying?’ The mother wished to cut off his thoughts and lied: ‘No crying. Aunt always thinks of you brothers, rejoicing in having you, holding you close, feeding you fruits, smiling and sending you money.’ Yinzhu knew she lied but was comforted. He liked to sleep with his brother; now alone, he was unaccustomed, missing grandfather and grandmother, newly parted from aunt, how could he not cry? He sighed: ‘Brothers two, suddenly parted. Parents for the dao, so the dao must remember, making each strong. Saying this, breathing deep, tears falling, sobbing, unable to stop.’

Fajie then bought offerings and greatly increased gifts to the daoist. The daoist was astonished and asked: ‘Where did you get this?’ Fajie dared not lie, told all. The daoist said nothing, and they ate together. After the meal, Fajie returned home and suddenly saw all the storerooms—miscellaneous, gold, silver, jewels, money, silk, cotton, brocade, and more—filled to overflowing. He asked his wife: ‘Did officials send these?’ She said: ‘No, suddenly they appeared.’ The couple was both fearful and joyful, unsure if it was a dream or Heaven’s grace, unable to rest. Fajie again entered the mountains to ask the daoist, telling him all. The daoist replied: ‘Last night I lectured and dreamed of a person holding a true material wish-fulfilling jewel, granting it to you, which you accepted. I thought this a good omen but dared not study it, fearing it was not yet time. Those who ate with me said I babbled; now it is so. This is Heaven’s grace; who dares take it? Your respect and faith are manifest in the profound and distant, enough to summon this; doubt not, just use without suspicion.’ Fajie said: ‘I still wish to tell the king to know if this is proper.’ The daoist said: ‘Good.’ Fajie told the king, who replied: ‘You are diligent and transcend the world; how could Heaven not respond? This is Heaven’s grace; who dares take it? Use it without fear; I have no objection.’ Fajie returned home, told his wife and brother all. The king and daoist spoke in unison; this was true Heaven’s grace, increasing faith. Thus blessings continued without end.

Then the Heavenly Venerable asked the two Perfected: “Do you recognize these three-time people?” The two Perfected replied: “This matter is long past; we truly do not recognize them.”

The Heavenly Venerable said: “Le Jingxin is now my body. Fajie is the Left Profound Perfected. Fajie’s wife is the Right Profound Perfected. Do you somewhat recall the ancient nurturing grace, leading to today and mutual awakening? This is the cause.” The two Perfected, hearing the teaching, began to awaken. Though recalling this, their understanding was clear, yet distant, so long ago.

Before the words ended, suddenly eight-colored cloud chariots appeared. The two mounted together, attended by immortal children and jade maidens, making great heavenly music, ascending from the southeast. They did not pass before but bowed to the Heavenly Venerable, then turned to bow to the two Perfected. The two then realized these were the two brothers. Presently awaited was the Great Lady, perhaps the ancient lady of the Heavenly Venerable, their ancestor. After the seating was arranged, they would go to pay respects.

The Heavenly Venerable said: “Yes, do you know?” The two Perfected said: “Selling sons to support the dao is also suffering.”

The Heavenly Venerable said: “For such people, what limit is there? Some sell themselves to support the dao, some throw themselves to starving tigers, some cut flesh to feed birds, some kill themselves to feed worms, some pawn wives and children, some offer their heads. Such examples are endless, spoken of through kalpas without end. Why? All these are those who attain the dao, truly perfected beings, appearing to encourage and transform the ignorant, no longer in pain, fully seeing human principle. Some are illusions, nothing strange. Thus I speak of Yinzhu, Yinyin brothers, father and mother, six in three generations, all once mortals, yet able thus—truly rare. That is why I speak.”

The two Perfected said: “Truly as the teaching says.” They received the scripture’s many essential formulas, each rejoicing, thinking: “All these, if slightly connected, surely will gladly accept.”

Then they said to the Heavenly Venerable: “Now if we spread this scripture outside, we do not know the weight of ritual and faith. We respectfully ask above.”

The Heavenly Venerable said: “You have not yet fully grasped; it is very proper to ask. Because there is great essential meaning, profound ritual, and hidden precepts, it is not spoken in one or two years. You all listen carefully and wisely. This prohibition is strict; be careful not to err.”

The Heavenly Venerable then told the Right Profound Perfected: “You receive this scripture; you may choose whom to transmit it to, no need for ritual tokens.” He told the Left Profound Perfected: “You receive this scripture; you must follow the dark classic and ritual tokens. The gold, silk, and other items must be as prescribed. This method comes from the concentrated thought of the Vast and Boundless Primordial Lord, treasured and cultivated by the Five Direction Elders. The recipient must separately bring five fen of gold and five taels of plain silk, to nourish the spirits of the Five Direction Elders. Life-patterned brocade, longevity one hundred twenty years, plus one remainder of years; one bolt for kings and princes, one zhang for commoners, one chi for the poor. These three kinds of items must not be lacking. To lack and forcibly receive incurs sin, with increase or decrease according to wealth. The Left Profound Perfected doubted fairness and reported to the Heavenly Venerable: ‘The Right Profound Perfected receives this scripture without tokens, yet sees the envoy harshly reprimanding. The scripture and ritual are the same, yet two differences appear. Can this be explained?’”

The Heavenly Venerable said: “It is not partiality; you do not yet understand. The myriad multitudes differ, each heart is distinct; thus two paths open, yet both return to one. Therefore, Right Profound disciples are laymen and monks, who generally beg and break evil as a bridge to the dao. Those who can give receive ten thousandfold blessings. Therefore, the scripture is granted without heavy demands on tokens. Your disciples, though assigned to guard, beg to save others. If people have none to give, they increase their sin; without faith, how can they be saved? Thus ritual tokens are established. The reward of ritual tokens is boundless, like endless scripture, not hindering the Right Profound’s giving of blessings.”

The Heavenly Venerable said: “Right Profound disciples who give to laymen reduce and cut giving to others; blessings are ten thousandfold, but ten thousandfold has an end. Left Profound disciples bring tokens to receive scripture; this is faith in the dao, thus giving wealth to the dao, so blessings are endless like scripture. Though the Left Profound Perfected follows the teaching, his heart still does not grasp the principle of endless blessings like scripture. What then is the principle?”

The Heavenly Venerable, knowing his thoughts, said: “You have doubts; have no suspicion. Therefore I say blessings are endless like scripture. Why? Suppose you get this scripture, copy one volume, pass it to one person, ten, a hundred, a thousand, ten billion, countless. Everyone copies one volume, volumes without limit, spreading everywhere. You originally have the reward of ritual tokens; this is endless. Suppose you now give ten thousand gold coins to the master to receive scripture, later receiving blessings endless as scripture, never exhausting. I fear some disciples do not awaken, so I give this example. The reward of scripture and faith corresponds to the amount of faith, like a good well. Even in a great drought, a hundred zhang deep with no source, the well remains full. The owner has enough; the rest is given to others. Hundreds of millions, whole towns and counties, freely draw water, saving endlessly, never exhausting. This is natural endless reward.”

The Heavenly Venerable said: “Since you can believe in the dao and use faith in the dao, you can believe in scripture, reduce body and speech to receive scripture, wealth rewards are endless. Thus it is called boundless. The blessing of faith in the dao makes one’s spirit bright and wisdom endless as scripture. Like one lamp lighting a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand lamps, billions and trillions of lamps, countless lamps, illuminating the void. The first lamp’s light is undiminished; this is blessing, wisdom never ends. You should widely tell those who receive scripture, guide them with wisdom, open awakening to all. Such wells and lamps cannot stand alone; they suffice for themselves.” The Left Profound Perfected again doubted: “Even in a great drought, a hundred zhang with no source, how can the well still be full? I wish to ask but dare not.”

The Heavenly Venerable knew his meaning and said: “That is why it is called a good well.” At that time, in the void, many immortals and great saints, hearing the teaching, countless in number, all opened understanding and together praised: “Good!” Praising blessings, blessings increased three stages. The Left Profound Perfected’s doubt cleared, understanding the responsibility of scripture and faith, a higher principle. He stepped down and bowed: “Now I am enlightened.”

At that time, the two brothers mounted cloud chariots, hearing the essential words, and with twelve hundred immortal children and jade maidens, bowed to the Left Profound Perfected, requesting the essential formula. The Left Profound Perfected immediately granted them the essential formula of subtle reflection and steadfast resolve. The two believed and understood, entering the third immortal rank. The twelve hundred immortal children and jade maidens, seeing the two receive scripture and attain the dao, each removed their jeweled necklaces and offered them to the Left Profound Perfected, requesting to receive the revered scripture. Receiving it, they read it through once, their spirits opened and understood that the Three Realms are empty, blessings end and must cease, and they all repented. The twelve hundred then dissolved into immortals.

At that time, a heavenly being in the void doubted the Heavenly Venerable’s parable, saying: “Those who study the dao but do not obtain the essential scripture of subtle reflection and steadfast resolve are like entering the sea to gather treasure without a guide. Also like foolish people entering a dark empty mountain seeking the Son of Heaven’s token. Such things did not exist at the beginning of creation; how could the Heavenly Venerable Great Sage attain the dao?”

Having such thoughts, the Heavenly Venerable knew and replied: “You have not yet been initiated, how could you know the cause of creation? The Heavenly Venerable Great Sage attained the dao before scripture and ritual appeared, all pure and simple, acting naturally. Natural action accords with principle. Darkness accords with principle, naturally profound awakening. The principle of profound awakening originally has no characters. Scriptures were compiled to inform later generations; what is there to dislike? Like one falling into hell, is there need first to make hell’s laws?” The heavenly being praised: “Holy Venerable’s words awaken my ignorance.” Then repented and ascended one rank.

There were twelve youths, living leisurely in the world, daily gathering, making good food, drinking and playing, sometimes discussing the difficulty or ease of the dao. The Heavenly Venerable, with the dao eye, saw them from afar. In a past life, one was a teacher but secretly withheld the enlightened scriptures, so disciples hesitated in their dao hearts. Because of this slight cause, they could still be saved. Thus the Heavenly Venerable transformed into a mortal, passed through their gathering, begged for food, and spoke with the youths, discussing as before.

One said: “I often followed my elder brother to Anle Mountain, seeing daoists all holding the Ten Precepts, solemn and excellent. After death, the soul’s place should not be empty. But few can fully uphold the Ten Precepts.”

The transformed one said: “Holding them is easy; breaking them is hard.” The youths all agreed. They asked: “Why do you say holding is easy and breaking is hard?”

The transformed one said: “Establishing oneself as precept, not fearing the Son of Heaven nor ghosts and spirits, how is that not easy? Those who break precepts fear all, also fear ghosts and spirits; how is that not hard?” The twelve youths all had dao intent and thought deeply.

One said: “I can do all but alcohol is hardest to quit. It is my nature; I dare not count how much. When I first took the precepts, on the day of scattering hair, I could not do without wine. That is why I dared.” The transformed one said: “The day of scattering hair requires medicine. To nourish the four great elements, medicated wine can pass through, but do not overdo it; better to be moderate.”

One said: “I can do all but lying is hard. Sometimes there are secret matters or elders to conceal, and when asked by others, one must lie, thus breaking precepts. That is hard.” The transformed one said: “There is hidden and revealed, words have convenience; this too can pass. But do not reverse good and evil, speak of others’ faults, or hurt others’ ears.”

One said: “I can do all but stealing is hard. Even small things break the rule.” The transformed one said: “Big matters are hard; small matters are not less to be cautious.” Then he recited a verse:

> Why not accept the stealing precept?  
> Not stealing is also hard.  
> Who says in darkness is ignorance?  
> There is a stealing official inside.  
> Taking doubles year by year,  
> Multiplying without leniency.  
> Holding copper in hand,  
> Burning mouth, boiling heart and liver.  
> Saying this pain once,  
> The whole year still aches.  
> Why not accept this precept,  
> Keep it surely complete?  
> I believe they also believe,  
> Everywhere is no unrest.  
> Sitting inviting spirits,  
> Forever enjoy long life and joy.

One said: “I can do all but lust is hardest.” He said: “I have committed this; often with brothers at meals, we say one day of fasting is reasonable, and after death we surely get the merit of fasting. But at night, I am pitiful, often tempted, though bitterly restraining, I cannot help it. Often so; thus it is hardest.” The transformed one said: “Desire is but imagination. Imagination is empty; how can there be form? But first observe the body, know the body is no wonder, then know no form; how can one not endure? Moreover, lust is like drinking salty water; the more you drink, the thirstier you become, only death can satisfy. How can there be enough?” Then he recited:

> Desire is stronger than thirst,  
> Slight endurance can pass.  
> Why drink salty water?  
> Salt only increases thirst.  
> If you can rightly quench thirst,  
> Drink Heaven’s sweet dew.  
> Sweet dew fragrant and fragrant,  
> Flowing through the whole body.  
> Heavenly beings seek fragrance and descend,  
> Mysterious joy naturally awakens.  
> Peaceful and effortless,  
> Long preserve the Nine Heavens’ blessings.

One said: “I can do all but killing is hardest. I love to look at chickens; without meat, food is tasteless; after a few days, I grow thin.” The transformed one said: “The wise see fat as a burden; thinness lightens the body. Why use fat?” Then he recited:

> The wise forbid killing,  
> Also do not harbor killing thoughts.  
> Though beings are tiny,  
> They all love life and growth.  
> How can you harm their lives,  
> To nourish yourself?  
> Nourishing self, now a verse,  
> Burdening your nature.  
> Long sinking in the Three Paths,  
> Bitter and born again.  
> Good and evil have causes,  
> Like a call with echo.  
> Why not change this conduct,  
> With compassion to reward yourself?  
> The Perfected embraces the Way,  
> Leisurely observing the floating world.

After reciting this verse, the transformed one showed great majestic change, the supreme dao form, attendants and retinue, great heavenly music, indescribable above. All saw this, joy and fear mingled, all heard the essential words, understanding and awakening. They all went to the Left Profound Perfected, requesting to receive the scripture and the Ten Precepts. The Perfected, with the dao eye, saw their past causes and the reason for their difficulty awakening. The Heavenly Venerable had descended with great effort to awaken them. Thus he did not grant it immediately, only saying it would be granted tomorrow. Tomorrow and tomorrow, endlessly.

The youths said among themselves: “Our lifespan is uncertain; we cannot be as before, tomorrow and tomorrow.” They each fasted and practiced ritual tokens, then begged earnestly, saying: “We bow and strike ourselves, blood flowing in buckets, yet must not stop. The Left Profound Perfected’s compassionate heart will surely grant us.” They said:

> Men born, So-and-so and others,  
> Bow and beg the dao, striking ourselves.  
> Today’s day, the flow is already less.  
> Always fearing subtle qi,  
> Suddenly like darkness,  
> Dark and without dawn,  
> Long night hard to pass,  
> Lonely and suffering,  
> Seeking escape with nothing.  
> Humbly hearing the Heavenly Venerable’s teaching,  
> Subtle reflection and steadfast resolve,  
> With Ten Precepts, simple and essential,  
> Nothing left unmeasured.  
> We are diligent and earnest,  
> Truly hoping to receive,  
> Morning receive, evening die,  
> Never leaving regret.  
> If delayed, day after day,  
> Morning mushroom’s short life,  
> Unknown what tomorrow brings,  
> Good or ill.  
> Such wondrous meaning,  
> First arising in ten thousand ages,  
> Meeting now, now again delayed,  
> Like blind men catching sparrows,  
> In hand then gone,  
> Though ten thousand kalpas,  
> How can it be met again?  
> We exhaust ourselves,  
> Prepare faith as prescribed,  
> Documents as on the left,  
> Respectfully bow and report,  
> Requesting accomplishment.  
> Respectful farewell.

Five fen of gold, originally five taels; five taels of plain silk; life-patterned brocade, one remainder of years, nearly a thousand; five dou of rice; one bundle of firewood; five kinds as prescribed.
