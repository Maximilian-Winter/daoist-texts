# The Most High Profound Cavern Numinous Treasure True Script for Delivering Beings’ Fundamental Practice Sublime Scripture (Dunhuang Manuscript)

Title of the Scripture: The Most High Profound Cavern Numinous Treasure True Script for Delivering Beings’ Fundamental Practice Sublime Scripture. Abbreviated as *The Profound Cavern Fundamental Practice Scripture*. Author unknown, probably composed during the Eastern Jin dynasty. It is one of the ancient *Numinous Treasure Scriptures*. Originally a single scroll, not included in the *Orthodox Daoist Canon*. Source text: Dunhuang manuscript P・3022v, copy one.

Thus begins the revelation of the Numinous Treasure True Script. The Most High Dao Lord, seated beneath a seven-jewel *wood* on Mount Fuluo of Yucha in the Western Na Heavens, maintained a long fast in an empty mountain. In tranquil meditation upon the numinous and true, harmonizing the dark pivot, serene and natural, observing the myriad transformations, he looked down upon all living beings. At that time, the great saints and most true honored spirits from the Ten Directions arrived at the seat, burning incense, bowing their heads before the Dao, and spoke to the Lord: “We do not understand from which kalpa the Numinous Treasure’s method emerged, nor how it has come to this day. How many beings have been delivered to completion? Is there again a turning of the wheel? From which kalpa was the Heavenly Venerable born? How did he encounter the True Script and receive the present Most High’s appointment? Because of this delivery, why alone is this lofty Virtue Ancestral so majestic and unsurpassable? We humbly ask you to bestow the origin and cause of this fundamental practice, to explain its essential words, and to open the enlightenment of later generations.”

The Dao Lord then played upon the Dragon Cloud Mound of Light, the sound soaring through the heavens, flowing and stirring a thousand fathoms. The myriad heavens surged with vitality, purple canopies swirling, auspicious gatherings of the skies, eight ways shining bright, twin lights illuminating together, nine breaths clear and radiant, scattering fragrant blossoms, profound and endless irrigation, divine dragons and celestial musicians, fifty million multitudes, splendid radiance dazzling, penetrating the Ten Heavens, rivers and seas calm and still, mountains veiled in mist, myriad sounds hushed in silence, the primordial Heaven spread forth, vast and unimpeded, all beings rejoicing therein.

Then the Dao spoke: “The primordial Heaven’s turning wheel, kalpa upon kalpa, changes fate—one success, one failure; one death, one life; extinguished yet unbroken; dark yet again bright. The Numinous Treasure’s method emerges, delivering beings according to the world’s times. Since the original beginning of illumination until the first year of the Red Bright Era, through nine thousand nine hundred ninety-nine billion kalpas, beings have been delivered in numbers like dust and sand, beyond measure. Before the Red Bright, in the midst of the vast indistinctness, transformations emerged kalpa upon kalpa, inconceivable indeed. After the Red Bright, until the first year of the Supreme Sovereign Era, the great model and grand method delivered countless beings. Even if spoken of until the end of Heaven, it would not be exhausted. Now, to roughly clarify the true and proper framework, marking the distant traces of those who attain the Dao, I briefly open this to instruct later generations, so they may comprehend the marvel of the numinous script.

I wash in the fragrant stream of the Purple Morning, the scion of the august Sovereign. I follow the cycle of death and life through kalpas, never ceasing, always encountering the Numinous Treasure, emerging together, delivering beings through seven hundred billion kalpas. At the end of the Azure Sovereign kalpa, when the nine breaths change fate, I was entrusted to be born in the womb of the Hong clan, concentrating spirit in the palace of the jade fetus, accumulating three thousand seven hundred years. At the opening of the Red Bright Era, in the year of Jiazi, I was born on Mount Fuluo of Yucha in the Western Na Jade Kingdom, again emerging with the Numinous Treasure to deliver beings. The Primordial Heavenly Venerable, by virtue of my karmic merit, bestowed upon me the title Most High, appointed me Heavenly Sovereign of Yulin Changyu Terrace of Yucha, ascending to the high saintly rank, governing the Mysterious Capital Jade City. Truly, by my honored body I uphold the great method of the Numinous Treasure True Script, endlessly delivering Heaven and humans through countless generations, compassionate toward all things, universally aiding living beings. The greatness of my merit and achievement is recorded through countless kalpas, and the present reward is that I am revered by the heavens.”

The Dao said: “The Eastern Treasure-Ancient Forest Azure Spirit First Elder Sovereign, surnamed An, dwells in the White Illumination, governing the golden kalpa’s cycle, temporarily born in the Yuyue Golden Radiance Cloud Heaven of Yulin. The Western Lou Infinite Jade Kingdom’s Vast Bright Mysterious Mountain is named Yuanqing. In this heaven he greatly built merit and virtue, cutting his body to give, supporting Daoists, initially without laxity in heart, his merit and name soaring high, recorded in the Vermilion Mound Fire Palace, inscribed in the Red Canon, the immortal path nearly complete. Yet he encountered a kingdom with many colorful women, their appearances utterly enchanting. Yuanqing thus allowed worldly scattered thoughts to linger, releasing himself at the gate of love and desire. The numinous demons raised their turbid eyes, the Vermilion Palace ceased his immortal name. Though he did not return to the Earthly Official, here he perished, retreating through three kalpas. When the Fire Kalpa changed fate, Yuanqing again received illumination and was entrusted to be born in the womb of the Hong clan. The heavens, because of his previous lustful nature, transformed him into a woman to fulfill his prior desires. In the first year of the Vermilion Mound, the year of Bingwu, he was born in the Dan Child Dragon Luo Guard Heaven Cave Bright Jade Kingdom Zhuhuo’s Cliff, changing surname to Hong, named Natai. At age fourteen, his appearance was surpassingly beautiful, beloved by heavenly beings; at that time, no kingdom was without admiration. Natai held firm in heart and conduct, guarding chastity and steadfastness, never casting evil glances. Revering and loving the Dao and its methods, aspiring to the numinous immortals, constantly purchasing incense and ointments, lighting lamps in the dark, scattering treasures, supporting Daoists, wishing for the kingdom’s peace, fertile lands, flourishing people, and eternal heaven. Greatly cultivating merit, praised by all heavens, his name marked in the Supreme Clarity.

The Southern Pole Supreme Spirit Purple Void Primordial Sovereign entrusted him as a common person to descend and teach. Seeing Natai’s chastity and love for the highest method, he returned to the Dan Terrace’s cliff, bestowing upon Natai the *Numinous Treasure Red Script Southern True Text* in one chapter. Thus Natai diligently strove, saying, ‘In this life I am a woman, dwelling in a secluded chamber, with no way to attain the Dao.’ Because of long fasting and holding precepts, he wished to transform into a man. Morning and evening he trembled with reverence, never weary. His red heart reached far, and he caused the upper truth to respond and descend.

At that time the Primordial Heavenly Venerable sat beneath the withered mulberry of the Long Forest on the Langbi Stream at Fuyao Hill, with many true ones attending his seat, dividing and proofreading the *Warehouse Primordial Treasure Record Numinous Treasure True Script*. The heavens poured fragrant flowers, musicians flowed with refined moon waters, countless varieties without measure, brightness penetrating, illuminating the Ten Directions. On that day, Natai was performing incense rites in his chamber, when five-colored purple light curved and shone upon the fasting hall. Then his heart awakened, doubting impermanence. He went out, climbing the wall to gaze westward, afar beneath the Eastern Mulberry Forest, splendid and dazzling, beyond naming. Hundreds of miles from Natai’s dwelling, separated by the Min Shungu and the mouth of the vast sea, his heart leapt with longing, unable to reach. He made a distant vow to the Heavenly Venerable, folding hands in salute, calling his name Natai, saying: ‘Though my past karma was insufficient, causing me to be born female, my heart delights and aspires to the immortals, my Dao is lofty and method wondrous, beyond grasp, day and night I long. I hope to attain deliverance, transform form to male, but years pass without response. I constantly fear birth and death, unable to fulfill the long life’s path. Today the Heavenly River blocks me, no way to reveal my case. Now I will cast myself into the blue sea, lose my life in the heavens, hoping my form and soul may soon turn the wheel again, building merit through countless kalpas, hoping to see the true Dao.’

Having spoken, he leapt from the wall, casting himself into the air, his fate bound for the ocean’s deepest abyss. Suddenly, without falling, he was caught by the Water Emperor Divine King on five-colored flying dragons. In an instant, the female form transformed into a male, riding the dragon to the void, flying before the Dao. Then the Primordial Heavenly Venerable commanded the Immortal Capital to bestow upon him the imperial title. During the Fire Kalpa he received his mission, assisting the Numinous Treasure Azure Sovereign Jade Chapter. Over seven hundred years, through many Fire Kalpas, the azure energy circulated, following the Primordial’s extinction and deliverance. In the first year of illumination, on the Mifanluo Terrace in the sky’s desolate hill, the flying cloud root capital, the Cangxia Nine Clouds Ruins, the Primordial Heavenly Venerable again bestowed upon him the title Treasure-Ancient Forest Azure Spirit First Elder Sovereign.”

The Dao said: “The Southern Brahma Treasure Flourishing Yang Cinnabar Spirit True Elder Sovereign, originally surnamed Zheng, styled Ren’an, scion of the Great Flame, born in the Chanli world’s Red Bright Heaven. At birth three clouds of qi entwined his body, vermilion bird and drum eagle covered his form. At three days he could speak, already knowing past and future fate. At twenty years, his face shone with golden countenance and jade beauty; he abandoned the world and left worldly affairs, wandering far in mountains and forests. In a cold forest cave palace he met Master Xuanhe, who bestowed upon Ren’an the *Numinous Treasure Red Script Five Qi Mysterious Heaven Black Emperor True Text* in one chapter, wisdom of the highest grade, ten precepts, then departed. Ren’an thus upheld precepts and long fasts, greatly cultivating merit, distributing treasures to save all punishments, cutting his mouth to feed birds, his merit and name reaching Heaven. Then in the Western Na kingdom came a great flood disaster, waters surging to the sky, all people drifting away. Ren’an floated on the waves in a boat, reciting precepts, casting the Black Emperor True Text into the water. The water opened a path a hundred acres wide; birds and beasts—deer, tigers, leopards, lions—all came to rely upon it, all attained safety. At that time the king and his hundred mouths ascended a tower and were submerged, lamenting that they could not be delivered. Ren’an saw the king sinking, floated his boat to him, and gave him the True Text he bore. The king reverently accepted it; the water calamity immediately receded, and he was safely passed over. Once the king was saved, the True Text flew away into the clouds, its whereabouts unknown. Ren’an lost the True Text, retreated one step in immortality, his fate to perish and be delivered. He died in the northern Rong’s cliff, his numinous corpse exposed for over thirty years, his form not decayed, his radiance bright and clear, no different from when alive, resting beneath the northern Rong’s Long Forest. At that time the king went hunting, set fire to the mountain; fire surrounded on all sides, but within a hundred paces of the numinous corpse, the fire did not burn; deer, tigers, and leopards all came to rely upon it. The king was amazed and went to see the numinous corpse, above which was three-colored light, mist dense and dark, birds and beasts circling. The king then cut wood to surround the corpse and set fire to burn it. At that time, the corpse rose in the fire as a man, sitting upon blue smoke, pointing to the void, five colors shining brilliantly. Three hundred attendants, immortal children, jade youths and maidens, solemnly arrived. All the birds and beasts that had relied upon him were also in the fire, all delivered across. Ren’an, in the second year of the Red Bright Era, in the year of Bingwu, at the Kamatanu Lou in the Yitian’s cave desolate peak, changed surname to Dongfu, named Riji Yan, was bestowed the title Southern Single Brahma Treasure Flourishing Yang Cinnabar Spirit True Elder Sovereign, the Cinnabar Spirit Elder Sovereign.”

The Dao said: “The Central Heaven Jade Treasure Primordial Spirit Elder Sovereign, originally surnamed Kun, styled Xinran. He is the scion of the Dongyuan and descendant of Zhonghe, born in the Shanneng world’s Azure Primordial Heaven at the Flowing Birth Hill. He lived one kalpa in silence, speechless, mindless in chaos, eating qi as food. Before Heaven and Earth’s illumination, an impermanent youth in the colorless country bestowed Xinran the *Numinous Treasure Red Script Red Emperor True Text* in one chapter, then spoke. At that time he only cultivated one body, initially not expanding, broadly delivering Heaven and humans, his good merit incomplete, fate soon to end. In the Azure Primordial Heaven, he died in the Flowing Birth state beneath the Absolute Hill. After over one hundred years, dead but unburned, yellow qi always covering him. When the Water Kalpa prevailed, the world was vast and dark, his numinous remains covered on all sides by earth reaching the sky, blocking clouds and water paths. Xinran responded with transformation, suddenly rising, reborn as a man, changing surname to Tongban, named Yuan. After the waters passed, Heaven and Earth opened light, three images mysterious and bright, seven primordials high and clear. The Primordial Heavenly Venerable, in the second year of illumination, the year of Jichou, at the Gao Tao Li Chong Dragon Luo Heaven’s Soul-Reversing Forest, bestowed Yuan the title Jade Treasure Primordial Spirit Elder Sovereign.”

The Dao said: “The Western Seven Treasures Golden Gate Bright Spirit Elder Sovereign was originally the son of the Spirit Phoenix. The Spirit Phoenix descended in the Heluo Heaven, born in the Weilu Paradise World. The Weilu king took and raised him. The king had six daughters; the eldest was named Peiying, greatly fond and loving, often playing together. The Spirit Phoenix often fanned the daughter’s face with his two wings. After twelve years, the daughter suddenly conceived, carrying the fetus for three months. The king was puzzled, so he beheaded the phoenix and buried its head in the Long Forest Hill. The daughter later gave birth to a girl who could speak immediately, saying: ‘I am the phoenix’s child, destined to be the Heavenly Consort.’ The king named her Imperial Consort. Three days after birth, a flock of phoenixes came to congratulate, feeding her with mysterious jade frost, vast springs, winding waters, and eight refined herbs. At eight years old, she held firm heart and pure conduct, surpassing worldly norms. Every morning she greeted the sun, every evening saluted the moon. Within the palace, the king set up kitchens, but she would not taste the food. Heaven made great snow that lasted a year without melting, snow ten zhang deep, birds and beasts starved to death. The king’s daughter thought of the Spirit Phoenix, went to visit, riding to the Long Forest Hill, singing: ‘Far away the Spirit Phoenix, endlessly returning long, my thoughts are boundless, forever contrary to my wishes, through countless kalpas without end, when will you come flying?’ Then the phoenix the king had killed suddenly came alive, flying with the daughter, directly into the clouds. The king’s daughter now dwells above the bright sky, bestowed the title Southern Pole Supreme Primordial Sovereign, always riding a nine-colored phoenix. In a past life through countless kalpas, she served the Numinous Treasure, causing the Spirit Phoenix to descend in form, receiving the title Southern Pole Primordial Sovereign. The Imperial Consort’s merit and virtue reach far; the celestial truth responded and descended. In the first year of the Primordial Era, on the seventh day of the seventh month, at midday, the Primordial Heavenly Venerable gathered at the Weilu Jade Kingdom’s Phoenix Qilin Hill, seated beneath the Jianhua tree, many true ones attending. At that time, within the Imperial Consort’s chamber, suddenly a solar image appeared, round as a mirror, hanging in the air before her eyes. The Imperial Consort saw the great heavenly truth gods, universally present in the mirror beneath the Long Forest, a chamber bright with light. Then she ascended the Tongyang Terrace, looking westward afar, seeing the Phoenix Birth Hill, purple clouds surging, divine light splendid and radiant, beyond naming. About five hundred steps from the Imperial Consort’s dwelling, blocked by her female root within the palace, no way to go. Suddenly a divine phoenix came flying, gathering on the terrace. The Imperial Consort spoke to the phoenix: ‘In the west there is Dao, my heart wishes but fate is lacking. I do not know if the divine phoenix can temporarily carry me to meet and deliver me?’ The phoenix spread its wings and made her sit on its back, lifting her straight to the Dao’s presence. The Primordial Heavenly Venerable pointed to the Golden Terrace Queen Mother, saying: ‘She is your teacher; you may perform rites.’ The Imperial Consort kowtowed and said: ‘I only wish the honored ones would pity and have mercy, so that my withered bones may be reborn.’ Having spoken, the Golden Mother bestowed upon her the title Western Spirit Jade Consort, commanding nine luminous spirit children to unfold the frost gauze’s essence, presenting the *Numinous Treasure Red Script White Emperor True Text* in one chapter to the Imperial Consort. For three hundred years she held this title, yet again the Azure Kalpa changed fate. The Imperial Consort then was entrusted to be born in the womb of the Li clan for three years, born beneath the Li tree in the secluded valley of the Golden Ridge of Western Na Jade Kingdom, transforming into a male, changing surname to Shangjin, named Richang. At the first year of illumination, the year of Shangjia, the Primordial Heavenly Venerable bestowed upon him the title Western Seven Treasures Golden Gate Bright Spirit Elder Sovereign.”

The Dao said: “The Northern Cavern Yin Shuo Single Yu Absolute Five Spirits Mysterious Elder Sovereign, originally surnamed Hao, styled Fuming. He is the scion of the Mysterious Emperor and descendant of the Supreme Clarity, born in the Yuanfu Abandoned Worthy world’s Beginning Azure Heaven. At twelve years old, he loved solitude, his heart delighting in mountains and waters, often away from home for ten days, sometimes returning. At that time the world suffered famine and pestilence, people starved and died, a kingdom nearly wiped out. Fuming, at the mountain’s base, encountered a vast field of grain, personally gathered and distributed to the poor and destitute, daily feeding thousands nearing death. He took and gave life repeatedly for three years without ceasing. Others sought him but did not know his whereabouts. Exhausted, his body emaciated, no time to care for himself, saving the people, he became weary and died at the mountain’s base. The Nine Heavens recorded his merit, the Golden Tablet inscribed his jade name, delivering his soul and spirit to the Vermilion Mound palace. Later the Emperor sent a golden-winged great bird, always spreading its two wings to cover his corpse. For seven hundred years his corpse did not decay. At the Water Kalpa’s change of fate, great floods surged, waters carried his corpse, drifting to the abyss of the boundless shore. After the waters passed, Fuming’s corpse fell at Beizhou Yeqi’s Northern Ridge Mysterious Hill. For forty years, mountain fires raged, burning the corpse. In the fire he was forged and rose, transformed into a true man, covered by five-colored clouds. The fire still fierce, Fuming coughed and spat, turning to great rain and floods to extinguish the flames. Though having attained the Dao, having mastered all scriptures, water and fire trials were also completed. At the first year of Illumination, at the Northern Ridge Mysterious Hill, he changed surname to Heijie, named Linghui. The Primordial Heavenly King bestowed upon Linghui the title Cavern Yin Shuo Single Yu Absolute Five Spirits Mysterious Elder Sovereign.”

The Dao said: “In the past, in the Chanli world, the king of the team had a daughter named Jingyin, born mute. At fourteen years old, the king was puzzled and abandoned the girl in the empty mountain of the southern floating Long Mulberry’s cliff. The girl lacked food, often gazing at the sun swallowing breath, drawing in the moon taking essence, naturally full and undiminished, always roaming the mountains, circling caves. Suddenly she met a divine person beneath the Danling’s cedar forest, who held Jingyin’s right hand, inscribed on red stone, saying to Jingyin: ‘Though you cannot speak, you may remember this.’ Jingyin privately lamented: ‘Born unfortunate, mouth cannot speak, abandoned in poor mountains, I vow to return to the human world, to make merit and virtue, without attachment or cherishing. After one hundred kalpas, I hope to meet my wish.’ Heaven, moved by this, sent twenty-four vermilion palace spirit children to descend and teach Jingyin the method of body principle, bestowing her the red script eight characters. Jingyin then could speak. Morning and evening she performed celestial rites; when the Dao truth descended, she reversed knowledge of fortune and misfortune, commanding a hundred spirits, sitting commanding the Ten Directions, going out from the mountain and returning to the kingdom. At that time a great drought afflicted the world, people suffering and burning, the king greatly fearful, praying to the gods. Jingyin went to the king and said: ‘I have often heard of a mute girl in the mountain who can sense Heaven. Does the king recognize her?’ The king then realized it was his daughter and welcomed her back to the palace. Seeing her speak, the king was ashamed. The girl revealed her Dao, howling upward for the king, and Heaven sent down great floods, pouring water ten zhang deep. Then she transformed and vanished, again entrusted to be born in the Li clan’s womb, fate not yet turned, again born female. Her father named her Fuqing, called Aqiuhui. When she reached human age, she developed great compassion, distributing to the poor, sleeping alone, not mingling with things, yet lighting lamps and burning incense, fasting in a quiet chamber, her cinnabar sincerity accumulating, the Dao descending for her.

In the first year of illumination, the great saints and honored spirits of the Ten Directions gathered at the Southern Garden Danhuo’s cliff, the Three Primordial Cave Chamber in the Azure Flower Forest, many true ones attending, incense and flowers, musicians numbering over five thousand, the true script shining brightly, light penetrating, illuminating inside and out, cloud scenes sparkling like the moon among stars, tens of miles from Aqiuhui’s former dwelling. At sixteen years old, Qiuseng saw the bright chamber, shining inside and out, doubting impermanence. He went out facing south, seeing the Dao truth. Qiuseng rejoiced, folded hands in salute, calling out: ‘Qiuseng now encounters this fortunate meeting, body beholding the Heavenly Venerable, an undeserved blessing, not knowing what to present, I return my life to the Ten Directions’ central Heaven. Only by the mysterious mirror’s favor am I given admonition: through countless kalpas of extinction and deliverance, I may fly as an immortal.’ The demons saw Qiuseng make great vows, power surpassing the demon realm, and transformed into the Five Emperors Elder, coming to tell Qiuseng: ‘I have received the mission of the Ten Directions’ honored spirits, coming to say: The Numinous Treasure Dharma flourishes, the Five Ways are now practiced, all wishing to make people benevolent, loving, filial, respectfully serving superiors, revering parents. If you hear your father is to betroth you, and you are already promised, you must obey the words and commands of parents, not disobey. You should follow first; once human propriety is fulfilled, then you may cast off the body. To disobey the father’s teaching, immortality cannot be attained.’ The girl answered the demon: ‘In my past life I was unfortunate, lacking karmic connection, merit incomplete, causing me to be born female. Morning and evening I strive diligently, vowing one heart, my will firm, responding to nature. Born of parents, my fate belongs to the Ten Heavens. Truly, to disobey the father’s teaching is not as you say.’ The demon saw Qiuseng’s firm heart was correct, and withdrew.

Qiuseng said to himself: ‘The Dao is lofty and remote, no chance to be free.’ Then he gathered firewood and set fire to burn his body, hoping his form and bones would become flying dust, borne by the wind to reach before the Dao. The fire blazed; Qiuseng cast himself in, scattering without attachment, body like treading the void. In an instant, Qiuseng transformed into a man, standing before the Dao. The Primordial Heavenly Venerable appointed the Southern Pole Honored Spirit as Qiuseng’s master, bestowing upon him the Ten Precepts Numinous Treasure True Script. The Primordial Heavenly Venerable further told the Southern Pole Honored Spirit: ‘Qiuseng in past kalpas served the Numinous Treasure, merit incomplete, thus entrusted to be born and turn the wheel. Until today, born among humans, seeing my method emerge, he may transform form, then deliver ninety-nine thousand nine hundred beings, and attain the supreme true great god, becoming the Profound Yang Red Bright Heaven Emperor.’”

The Southern Pole Honored Spirit, originally surnamed Huang, styled Duming, was the daughter of the King of Yanfuli Country. Born in the Chanli world’s Red Bright Heaven, born wealthy and noble, her father was king. The girl dwelt in the palace, golden bed and jade couch, seven-colored jewel canopy, bright moon and twin pearls, light shining inside and out. The king provided thousands of courtesans; the kingdom’s treasures were never lacking. She often wished to distribute and greatly build merit and virtue, aspiring to mountains and waters, seeking immortals, but palace restrictions blocked the way, no path to cross, her heart and conduct unhappy, her mind anguished. The king pitied her, comforting and questioning her cause, but she never spoke, tears falling like rain, utterly without joy. The king increased her music and singing daily. Duming heard the music as if not hearing, alone in one quiet place burning incense, fasting and holding precepts, eating at midday. The king understood her mind, so in the palace he made a mound of earth, a mountain a hundred zhang high, planted bamboo forest, built a terrace named Seeking Truth Jade Terrace. Duming abandoned the palace, ascended the terrace to dwell, blocking the Dao path, no one could pass, alone she stayed twelve years. Accumulated feeling moved the Vast Azure Heaven Emperor, who sent twenty-four vermilion palace jade maidens to descend on clouds and phoenixes to welcome Duming. On the eve of departure, the sky rose with great wind and rain, thunder and lightning flashing, the earth house spinning, startling a kingdom. The king was greatly fearful, not knowing what to do. At dawn, light parted, the mountain terrace was lost, the girl not seen. The Heaven Emperor welcomed Duming to the Yang Hill’s Danling upper lodge in the Xiang forest, vermilion phoenix guards, divine dragon winged carriage, jade boys and girls numbering over three hundred. After great kalpas passed, Heaven and Earth changed place, Duming should have been abandoned, but the South Pole felt her cinnabar reach, the Vermilion Palace recorded her purple name, transformed her form in the boundless womb, born after one kalpa, becoming male. At the Southern Dan Cavern Yang Upper Pavilion in the Bright Pearl Seven-Colored Treasure Forest, the Red Emperor Brahma Treasure Flourishing Yang Cinnabar Spirit True Elder Sovereign bestowed upon Duming the title Southern Pole Supreme Truth.”
