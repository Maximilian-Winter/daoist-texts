# The Scripture of the Original Practice and Conditions of the Numinous Treasure of the Profound Cavern of the Most High

In the third year of the Red Crow of Wu, the year of Gengshen, on the first day of the first month, at the hour of Renzi, the Immortal Lord ascended Mount Laosheng, withdrawing into quietude to contemplate the Dao. At midday on that day, thirty-three earth immortals and Daoist adepts came to his seat, burning incense, reverently saluting the scripture, and circumambulating in rotation. When they had just finished, the Immortal Lord bade them be seated. After a long while, a Daoist withdrew from his seat and humbly inquired:

“We disciples have studied the dao for many years, accumulating six hundred cycles of sixty years each until now. Early on, we were granted the title of Left Immortal Lord of the Supreme Ultimate, ascending the Jade Capital, entering the Golden Palace, and paying homage to the Most High Void Sovereign. Yet we do not understand what past merits and virtues caused us to receive this heavenly office and to reach such loftiness, admired by the Three Realms and the Northern Feng. We earnestly wish you to reveal the root causes and conditions of our past destinies.”

The Immortal Lord said: “What you ask is subtle and profound indeed. Sit again, and I shall tell you. The One Qi arises from the void and non-being; the Two Forms emerge from the One Qi. The clear becomes Heaven; the turbid becomes Earth. Man is born of the central qi, forming with Heaven and Earth the Three Talents. At first, there was no difference between the mundane and the sage, no distinction of long or short life; all was a confused chaos, requiring no cultivation, and the Dao stood by itself. But once the chaos was cleft and the great uncarved block scattered, human affairs became tangled and the Dao receded far away. You disciples in former lives studied the dao and received scriptures, performing small virtuous deeds, seeking only to transcend your own bodies, not considering the salvation of others; seeking only your own attainment, not caring if others attained the Dao. You did not believe the vast and profound words of the great scriptures, neglected fasting and purification, disrespected the Three Caverns’ masters, and favored the lesser teachings of the Small Vehicle. Thus you attained the earth-immortal path, yet only so as to transcend the Three Realms and roam the Ten Directions, gazing upward at the Supreme Jade Capital and Golden Palace. If you wish the Dharma wheel to swiftly ascend and fly to the heavens of Upper Clarity, you must establish greater merit, rescue the lands and people from calamities, disasters, and suffering. Only with great achievements and abundant virtue will the Most High grant you welcome. That is why Pengzu lived eight hundred years, Anqi Sheng a thousand, and Baishi Sheng three thousand years; they roamed among the common folk because in past lives their study of the dao was of small merit and thin virtue. Some dwell in mountain caverns for over ten thousand years yet have not ascended to Heaven. You, with only several hundred years, how can that be considered long? Immortals who secretly cultivate yin virtue in the mountains and forests and ascend to immortality, as well as those who shed their corpses and entrust their forms, often manifest signs in the world, known and praised by the people, but few record their names or pass down their scriptures.”

At that time, an immortal named Ji, styled Facheng, was present. The Immortal Lord looked upon him and said: “He is my disciple from a former life, though he has not yet seen the root of his past destiny. I can cause you to see the affairs of your former lives.” Facheng replied: “Yes, yes, Heavenly Venerable.” In a moment, he understood and clasped his hands in salute: “Your disciple is ignorant and blocked, not yet recognizing his original practice. I beseech your mercy.”

The Immortal Lord said: “In the time of Emperor Yao, you followed me into Mount Songgao to study. Your ambition was small and your hopes swift. You often doubted my words, which seemed fanciful; your aims were distant and your path difficult. You even laughed at Xu You and Chao Fu, who severed ties with the world atop Mount Ji, refusing Yao’s abdication and regretting luxury and excess, which you also found unsettling. I constantly urged Facheng to study the dao of Upper Clarity, but he did not follow. Though he drank the sea, his belly was never full; he knocked on stones but found no jade. Chao Xu ascended early to the Supreme Ultimate Palace; now I ascend to the office of Left Immortal Lord. You remain only an earth immortal, not dying but your virtue barely rising a few steps. Are you not distressed? Now you understand that my words have foundation; believe and do not doubt.” Facheng rejoiced, recalling this not long past, his heart clear. “In former times I did not follow the teaching; this is difficult to obtain. I wish to see liberation and salvation, to serve as charioteer of the cloud carriage, to face the heavenly countenance in person. Thus, I have the meeting of past destinies.”

The Immortal Lord said: “You are outstanding and elevated; you are fit to ascend to Heaven. But how could you follow me to the Supreme Ultimate Palace and pay court to the Most High Jade Capital and Golden Palace? I have no regrets.”

The immortal further inquired of the Immortal Lord: “Is my past practice complete, or is there more unfinished that you would teach?”

The Immortal Lord said: “My forebears experienced the cycle of wealth and sin, transmigrating and transforming forms, traversing Heaven and Earth. This too is endless. If you wish to know, I can briefly recount a corner. I was once born a noble, ruling over the poor and lowly, supporting the strong and suppressing the weak, then died and entered Hell. Later, born a commoner, poor, sickly, lonely and desolate, I then reflected: ‘What deeds of my past destiny caused this hardship? What virtue of that past life enjoys wealth and honor?’ I thought to do good, but my heart did not understand itself; grief and poison were hard to express. I died and ascended to the hall of blessings. Later born into a wealthy family, with treasures sufficient and no lack, yet cruelly enslaving servants, I died and entered Hell to be tested. After the Three Officials’ judgment of sins, I was born in a lowly household, watching others’ breath, serving and laboring, receiving beating and scourging, suffering hardship and ruin, treading every misery. Then I reflected: ‘What fault of my ancestors makes me this low servant?’ I gave my private wealth to the poor, revered Daoists, burned incense and offered oil, only wishing to be born into a noble family and die ascending to the hall of blessings, with clothing and food naturally provided. Later born a noble, I again killed many beings, hunting and fishing for livelihood, dying and entering Hell, enduring the mountains of blades and trees of swords, boiling and fire swallowing, the five sufferings complete. After the sins, I was born as swine and sheep, repaying old grudges. Then I took form as a lowly man, foul and loathsome beyond measure, cheating and taking others’ wealth without return, dying and entering Hell. Born as an ox, I repaid others with strength, fed people with my flesh. Later born a middle-class man, with treasures near at hand, I then reflected on doing merit, often supporting Daoists, honoring scriptures and precepts, humble and lowly, giving alms to the distressed, following the Dao in all matters, hearing good and wishing to follow it. At eighty years I died and directly ascended to the hall of blessings, with clothing and food from the heavenly kitchen. Later born noble, I practiced martial valor, killing and warring, yet still revering and obeying Daoists, believing in the orthodox dharma, dying and entering Hell to be tested by poison. At that time the Most High taught: though this person committed killing and warring, having already entered Hell, in life he believed in the dharma, respected the Dao, and gave alms to the distressed. Now, considering his punishment, he may be allowed to ascend to the hall of blessings, receiving heavenly kitchen provisions. Later born noble, facing enemies and impending peril, I then made vows and reflected on the Dao, reverently receiving scriptures and teachings, practicing hidden virtue, rescuing the desperate, governing affairs with the Dao, showing compassion to all beings, supporting Daoists, serving the ruler with loyalty, the ministers with propriety, always thinking to renounce glory and abandon rank, thus escaping enemies, ending life in the heavenly realm. Born again noble, revering and believing even more deeply, in youth I began to burn incense, wishing that in future lives I might have wisdom and clarity, profound understanding and subtle meaning, and die ascending to the hall of blessings. Later born a middle-class family, becoming a Daoist, wearing the ritual robe and walking the path, teaching scriptures with clarity, acting as master among many, respected by patrons. Then I reflected: ‘In this life I cannot attain the Dao; better to be a woman, quiet and without affairs, enjoying leisure.’ At death I was born a woman, with graceful appearance, extraordinary talent, eloquent speech. I then cultivated fasting and scripture reading, and so reflected: ‘Next life I will be a man, with broad talent, penetrating mystery and void, understanding the rare and subtle, wishing to be a king, mingling with Daoists, pursuing my desires, roaming mountains and waters, enjoying courtesans and inner pleasures, often hearing scripture lectures.’ At death I ascended to Heaven, with clothing and food naturally provided. Soon born in a royal family as a crown prince, calmly preparing the palace, inheriting the kingly legacy, hastening to invite Daoists, sages, and learned men to perform rites and lectures, cultivating fasting and stillness, indulging in what I desired, the country peaceful and the people prosperous, solemn and without disturbance. At that time, three attendant ministers made the same vow: ‘In future lives I will be a Daoist, I a recluse, Shi Dao Wei and Zhu Falan vow to be monks, Zheng Siyuan and Zhang Tai Daoists, all ascending to immortality and saving the world, abandoning royal affairs, dying and ascending directly to Heaven, with clothing and food from the heavenly kitchen.’ In future lives I was a recluse, Lan Wei a monk, Zhang and Zheng Daoists, all entering study of the Dao seeking immortality. I later became a teacher to these people, with great aspiration, always fasting, reading scriptures, bringing treasures to the great master, receiving the great scriptures of the Three Caverns, supporting and honoring with offerings, practicing fasting and precepts, taking medicine and breath exercises. The conditions were not yet complete; at death I passed to the Moon, born again in a virtuous family, again becoming a Daoist monk, again studying with peers, mutually teacher and disciple, again receiving the great scriptures, fasting and practicing the Dao. Therefore the highest sage opened his eyes, looked upon the true and descended teachings to me. At that time Lan Wei and Zhang Zheng fully attended the seat; today they accompany me. This is the cause of our past destiny and vows. All the immortals understood and were at ease. The four seats consulted each other, then sighed: ‘Heavenly Venerable Most High, you have sought the Dao long and far, enduring kalpas and many years; thus you have attained the position of Immortal Lord, surely for good reason. We now fully see that our past deeds were slight, our scripture study little. How can we demand high immortality? Here we must think to receive the great scripture of the Profound Cavern, yearn for the Dao and diligently practice, with compassion to save those in distress, hoping for the path to ascend to Heaven.’”

The Immortal Lord said: “You do not honor the supreme Dao scripture, the myriad subtle primordial principles. Each must think diligently, greatly accomplish merit, and save all from suffering and hardship. With such resolve, why fear not swiftly ascending Heaven? Yet if you desire to enter the Most High’s palace, still no day is set.”

The Immortal Lord said: “I have trod everywhere, beyond what is recorded in brush and paper. The toil is hard to tell; only now do I receive recompense.”

An immortal asked: “Before, with the Most High, we entered Dongting, saw the Heavenly King’s separate palace, like ascending Mount Bao. At that time, a group of immortals sought to follow the Most High to watch the drama. What kind of immortals are they, that so many gather?” The answer came: “Those immortals are all from famous mountains and cavern terraces; they themselves are not many. You have not seen Kunlun, Penglai, Zhong Mountain, Song Mountain, Sumeru, and the great mountains and caverns of humans and birds—immortals are countless.”

The immortal said: “I do not know where Dongting connects.” The answer: “It connects to the great heavenly mountains above and the vast seas, the Northern Feng, the Daizong, and the Five Sacred Peaks; there is nowhere it does not connect. Five immortals said they were returning to Jvqu Mountain. Is that the Most High’s hometown?” The answer: “Jvqu Mountain is what I see with my eyes, also a fine mountain of Jiangzuo. It is the western side gate of the Nine Springs Dongting. Below it the cavern terraces extend forty li, the palaces shining like the sun, numbering thirty-six small heavens, not touched by defiling qi. Daoists can rightly dwell and shelter there. Often sages are present. In former times, Master Mao attained the Dao there. Now he dwells on that mountain cavern palace, named the Empty Cavern, establishing the Mysterious Palace Temple, dwelling among immortals.”

The immortal asked: “Recently I ascended the Kunlun Mysterious Garden Palace to attend the seat, seeing the Perfected of the Orthodox Unity, the Three Heavens Master Zhang Daoling descend to the seat, Fengdu awaiting and welcoming, the Three Realms bowing, the heavens saluting and questioning in movement and stillness, the dragon chariot shining in the void, a round brightness atop his head, his body born of heavenly light, his writings radiant and splendid. What past merits caused him to attain the Dao? Is he alone thus? I wish to hear.” The answer: “The Heavenly Master’s original practice was also through kalpas of diligent toil, fasting and scripture reading, propagating the Dao with great magnanimity, high standards and mysterious truth, savoring the rare and subtle, turning the wheel to seek the Dao, surpassing even me, not to be fully told. His aspiration was the great scripture, his conduct the great Dao, thus he attained the office of Three Heavens Master, the title of Most High Perfected of Orthodox Unity. Is this not great?”

At that time, the Eastern Flower Blue Youth and all immortals gathered in the Songgao cave, quietly fasting and chanting scriptures. Those who studied heard the Immortal Lord speak of all original practices, none not longing for the great Dharma to strengthen themselves.

The Blue Youth said: “The Immortal Lord’s wondrous words are distant and profound, trustworthy and worthy of respect.” All immortals saluted and said: “We attend to these words.” The Blue Youth said: “I formerly wrote to you, receiving your favor and care, never once forgetting. You have received the Most High’s bestowal. I should first cultivate reverence and affection, yet have not yet revealed certain matters, often turning and tossing, wishing not to fail this heart.” The Immortal Lord said: “Previously I neglected your letter; your care was extraordinary, deeply causing me shame. I will use emptiness and waiting more, how could my feelings cease? Not for lack or shortcoming, but virtue unworthy of the highest sage’s manifest sign, your letter’s command brilliant, I am ashamed beyond bearing. We share the Dao and virtue, roaming the Three Realms, always thinking of freedom, traveling respectfully in the void. Such feelings can be spoken; the respect of the public office, what need is there to add more? Only soon to ascend to office, the distant day draws near. If there is lingering attachment, what then?”

The Blue Youth replied: “I cherish your wish, often receiving your kindness and comfort.” The Immortal Lord said: “The Heavenly Master says on the fifteenth day of the month, one can fast in a quiet chamber, read the received Dao scriptures, and all the immortals’ Dao traces. These are all for future sages and people. To live in this age, is it not joyful? On the day of Dingmao, I paid respects to the Eastern Flower Blue Youth in the quiet chamber, facing north, bowing three times, praying for the matters of wished-for immortals, and on my birth day reading scriptures, not mingling with worldly affairs. These are the essential words for seeking immortality. The Daoist path has many such matters, fitting to what people venerate. The great secret lies in the elixir, the heartfelt practice of the mysterious teaching. With a wish, nothing is unattainable.”
