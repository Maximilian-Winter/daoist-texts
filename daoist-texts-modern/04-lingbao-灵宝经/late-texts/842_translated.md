The True Person of the Great Ultimate and Great Void inquired of the Exalted Laozi:

“Long ago, the Sacred Teaching was received, commanding all men and women to diligently cultivate meritorious deeds and their works. Yet I do not understand—what exactly is meant by ‘meritorious deeds and their works’?”

The Exalted Laozi replied:  
“To exert effort in diligent practice is called merit; when merit reaches things, it is called virtue; to embody all goodness in one’s conduct is called action; and to take these as one’s affairs is called work. These four are the unifying thread of myriad practices, the ordering principle of countless virtues. Among the gods of the Ten Directions who have attained the dao, none fail to practice diligently until reaching the utmost fruition.”

The True Person said:  
“Are meritorious deeds and their works of one kind, or are there distinctions of superiority and inferiority?”

Laozi said:  
“There are indeed distinctions of superiority and inferiority.”

The True Person asked:  
“What then is superior, and what is inferior?”

Laozi said:  
“To aspire to study the Great Vehicle, putting others before oneself—this is superior. To cling to petty laws, caring only for oneself—this is inferior.”

The True Person said:  
“Among things, is there also rising and falling, not erring?”

Laozi said:  
“There is indeed rising and falling.”

The True Person said:  
“What is rising, and what is falling?”

Laozi said:  
“For example, to rescue those on the brink of death, to save the poor and destitute, to administer medicine to revive the ill, to labor on behalf of others, to nourish the aged and infirm, to share in the worries of others—this is the highest of the highest.  
If one pardons prisoners, releases lives, gives alms to the poor, the old, the sick, and prisoners, feeds and clothes birds, beasts, insects, and fish, frees servants and the lowly, renounces worldly ties to enter the dao—this is the upper middle.  
If one repairs roads, builds boats and bridges, plants orchards and groves, constructs houses and digs wells, provides food and firewood, rescues those in peril, supports mountain-dwelling daoists and sages, attends to daoists, upholds scriptures and precepts, offers vegetarian meals and clothing—this is the middle and lower.  
If one establishes temples in cities, towns, palaces, gardens, and mountains, erects altars, guides people to place images, creates places for future appearances and refuge, encourages men and women to awaken the dao-heart, to fix their thoughts with reverence, to advance goodness and halt evil—this is the middle upper.  
If one crafts images of heavenly deities, true responses, immortals, sages, celestial emperors, Vajra kings, immortal youths and jade maidens, incense officials and messengers, dragon and tiger lords, in gold, silver, copper, iron, pearls, jade, embroidery, painting, carved sandalwood, stone engraving, clay, and plain lacquer, placing them suitably wherever one can, so that all may take refuge—this is the middle middle.  
If one copies and carefully edits the scriptures of the Three Caverns, maintains their constant circulation among the human world and mountains, arranges their storage and exhibition, lectures on them to enlighten, and holds them through endless kalpas—this is the middle lower.  
If one builds halls, pavilions, towers, chambers, rooms, seats, spreads flowers, hangs banners and canopies, offers incense, minerals, tables, bells, chimes, ritual implements, supports heavenly deities, and adorns the scriptures and dharma in proper order, complete and pure—this is the lower upper.  
If one offers incense and oils, cultivates fields and gardens, provides servants, grinds stones, paves roads, supplies carriages, horses, utensils, garments, ritual robes, implements, incense minerals, baths, watering, auspicious tables and brushes, ropes, beds, mats, shoes, and miscellaneous utensils, all entering the constant abode to support heavenly deities and daoists—this is the lower middle.  
If one offers seeds, millet, wheat, broad beans, rice, vegetables, fruits, and fine silks, brocades, gold, silver, pearls, and jade to supply the Three Treasures as needed—this is the lowest of the low.”

“By these nine ranks, roughly one may understand that all depend on the heart, with sincere and earnest dedication.”

The True Person said:  
“For the highest of the highest, rescuing people and saving lives, are there also distinctions within this kind?”

Laozi said:  
“The highest people have long planted good karma; their fruit and reward suffice themselves, needing nothing from others. The middle people’s merit and practice sustain themselves without relying on others; each can stand on their own. Only the lowest people bear heavy ancestral debts; though they repay in human form, all suffering gathers, pain and torment cling, and they cannot free themselves—they must be rescued by others. Their merit is equal, with no gradations, differing only in the weight of their resolve at the moment of arising.”

The True Person said:  
“For the upper middle and so forth, birds, beasts, insects, and fish—are there distinctions among them?”

Laozi said:  
“In the past, Chang’an saved several drowning snails; his compassion moved Heaven. Zhang Ba revived several starving tigers; the Earthly Official recorded his good deeds. So, though sizes differ, their lives are equal. If your heart is moved by compassion and sincerity, truly responding to beings, then your good deeds resound to Heaven, your merit inscribed in the register of blessings. How could it be separated by the great or small of insects and fish, birds and beasts?  
The reason for urging people to establish merit and accumulate virtue is to observe their intention and temper their heart. If the heart is a cinnabar mirror, the mind profound, wisdom bright and clear, fully grasping principle, forgetting self and other, uniting form and spirit, pure within and without, equal to near and far, unmoved by calm or turmoil, with environment and insight extinguished alike, banishing all false thoughts, removing all vexations, then the true source will naturally emerge—what need is there for all these deeds?  
If the heart’s mirror is dim or the dao nature unclear, if self and other remain in the mind, right and wrong unceased, vexations and false thoughts, walking and standing in confusion, though one establishes virtue and accumulates merit, the true dao remains distant.  
The great sage forgets merit, the middling person accumulates virtue, the petty person diligently acts—each according to their capacity and fate; one must not be partial. You should know this.”

At this, the True Person of the Great Ultimate and Great Void bowed deeply, praised the words as good, and departed joyfully.
