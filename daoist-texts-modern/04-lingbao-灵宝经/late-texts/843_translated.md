*(Beginning missing)*²

The years do not age, the radiant countenance is grand and resplendent. At nineteen, the birds hunt the six beasts; within wombs, conception and gestation occur; those born and unborn alike are all nurtured without injury. At twenty, women bear children, and throughout Heaven all are born male. At twenty-one, the earth’s storehouses open, exuding golden jade dew, scattering over roads, leaving no hidden place. At twenty-two, Heaven shakes and Earth splits; dry bones revive; sinking corpses and soaring souls arise into full human form; the world sings in joy, rejoicing in great peace. At twenty-three, lotus blossoms spring from the earth; celestial beings celebrate; none fail to awaken with delight. At twenty-four, the Five Great Mountains open their caverns; talismanic scriptures emerge together, instructing Heaven and humanity; at this time, all disciples ascend as flying immortals.

These twenty-four responses praise the numinous garden of the Primordial Origin, delight in the enlightenment of the Five Elders; the numinous writings resound, and the Dao thereby proceeds. Heaven and Earth expand and unfold; the orthodox dharma flourishes; divine winds reach afar; myriad swallows raise their wings; the Five Emperors assist and support, urging on the celestial immortals; divine officials serve and guide, steering yin and yang; firmly securing the Three Luminaries at the mysterious root; preserving Heaven and Earth for long existence; pacifying the Five Mountains within the numinous halls; regulating kalpas and cycles at the Three Passes; establishing the nation’s mandate in accord with the celestial chart; guiding the Five Phases to nurture the people; broadly unfolding the Heavenly Origin; universally teaching the Ten Directions; majestic potency vast and wide, no shadow remains untouched³; divine marvels grand and imposing, difficult to fully praise.

At this time, the Supreme Sage, the Supreme Great Dao Lord, the Most High Jade Emperor, and the Perfected Ones of the Ten Directions all ride five-colored jade wheels, gemmed carriages, azure palanquins; nine-colored mysterious dragons; ten peerless feathered canopies; three pure drifting clouds. The great saints of the heavens, the mystic travelers perfected in truth, all ride on blue mist, nine spirits, flowing light, flying clouds, and jade platforms. Celebrations gather in the four skies; three dawns exhale fragrance; flying incense plays eight melodies; streaming lightning raises signal fires; the essence of blossoms drenches the sun; the Three Luminaries unite in brightness; divine radiance glows brilliantly, eyes streaming with the utmost boundlessness.

Following the Five Emperors and celestial immortals, the thousand perfected ones of the mulberry groves, white cranes, lions, tigers, leopards, dragons, and unicorns; the numinous consorts scattering flowers; golden youths raising incense smoke; the Five Dao open the path; the Three Realms connect the ferry; wandering cloud roads; commanding the ten heavens with howling decrees.

The Supreme One ascends to the Supreme Clarity, Supreme Mystery, Jade Capital, Cold Spirit Elixir Hall, Purple Tenuity Upper Palace; establishes Heavenly Treasure feathered robes; proceeds beneath the Golden Gate of the Primordial Heavenly Venerable; requests to receive the *Primordial Numinous Treasure Red Script Five Chapters of True Text*.

Then the Heavenly Venerable commands the assembly of perfected ones to enter the Great Void Golden Terrace, Jade Treasure Hall, Nine Radiance Chamber. Numinous boys and jade maidens attend on all sides, ninety million strong. Flying dragons and poisonous beasts guard the eight gates; rushing with swords; long fangs strike bells; divine tigers roar upward; lions bellow from their mansions; unicorns and phoenixes sing; howling songs resound.

The Heavenly Balance sounds banners and canopies; jade voices stir the cloud court. The Supreme Sage, the Five Great Supreme Dao Lords, bow and speak:  
“Humbly we hear that the Primordial Origin renews the kalpa; the mysterious image opens the chart; numinous writings flourish; the divine manifest in the Five Directions. Heaven and Earth ride upon this to divide and judge; the Three Luminaries follow to enlighten. This is the great ancestral work—may it be briefly revealed in the numinous treasury.

I, a servant passing before Heaven’s mandate, amid the great kalpa, have planted truth in the Nine Spirits’ storehouse; received essence from the Five Gems’ passes; borne the mysterious womb of life; witnessed yang in the soul’s dark response; lifted my head to the Great Void; strode the long ferry; shone forth in the Three Assemblies; washed in the upper mystery; flowed in the city of dark radiance; held firm in the Eight Circles; humbly received the office of enlightenment; gratefully accepted the ancestral teacher’s lineage.

Reflecting on all beings, mourning the flow of fate, now that the imperial dao is smooth, truth should also proceed. My private heart truly wishes to let the cloud court spread to the eight horizons; the wind scatter the orchid groves; cold branches gaze upward, hoping for the flourishing of Huayang; decayed bones receive the numinous ferry.

I do not know if the five chapters of the Numinous Treasure Jade Text can be granted and taught to those who have not yet heard.”

The Primordial Heavenly Venerable, deep in true meditation, bending high and resolute, commands the Five Emperors; discusses and settles yin and yang; calculates the proud assemblies; shifts and checks the river source; inspects and records the heavenly degrees; selects the seed people; points and plucks the Great Void; howls clearly the Nine Mysteries; never again opening ears to old words; then closes the gate on the path to truth.

The Supreme Great Dao Lord persistently petitions; after a long while the Primordial Venerable lowers his gaze and face, sighing deeply:  
“Subtle and profound indeed! What you now inquire—how could it not be remote? This is the mysterious root of the Primordial Origin, the hollow natural text; it preserves the kalpa’s cycles in the heavenly mechanism; pacifies the Five Spirits to establish truth.

Now the Three Heavens arrange their cycles; the Six Heavens carry the dao; mixed methods open and transform; there will be sixteen thousand kinds of dao to select the hearts of those who come. When this dharma’s cycle ends, after the three dragons, in the year of the Gengzi, all mixed darkness will be dispelled; then our true dao will proceed.

For now, it may be entrusted, recorded in the upper hall, not yet to be practiced in the lower world, to teach those beginning to learn. The mysterious methods have prohibitions; do not transmit lightly. You yourself may ascend to the Purple Tenuity Upper Palace of the Numinous Capital; observe the heavenly sounds in the golden frame; take the bow and gaze from the divine king. Then you shall be able to master all heavenly writings, to govern the Primordial Heaven.”

Thus the Supreme Great Dao Lord and the assembly of perfected ones retired for three months of retreat, journeyed to the Purple Tenuity Palace of the Numinous Capital, and received the bow and gaze frame. Then they realized the preciousness of heavenly truth, how difficult it is to hear directly; so they returned to the Primordial Heavenly Venerable to consult on the rites of prohibition, humbly declining for their own inadequacy.

The heavenly face pitied and explained; the numinous passes opened wide; they ascended to the Five Elders’ Supreme Truth; unfolded the nine radiances and eight colors of the treasury; the cloud brocade pouch; produced the Primordial Red Script Five Chapters of True Text, the Supreme Scripture of the Numinous Treasure; entrusted it to the Supreme Great Dao Lord, the Most High Jade Emperor, the Perfected Ones of the Ten Directions, the great saints of the heavens, and the mystic travelers perfected in truth; commanding them to follow the mysterious methods, as the Six Heavens’ qi dissipates, to transmit according to dharma.

## Scripture on the Three Origins: The Lord of the Dao Questions Difficulties Concerning Sins, Blessings, and Merit, Chapter Two

The Lord of the Dao bows and dares to ask the Heavenly Venerable:  
“Regarding the weight of merit and virtue, the extraction from suffering, the ranks and grades, which come first? Is it that ancestors bear burdens for generations, responsible only for one’s own body, flowing down to children and grandchildren? If one’s own body commits evil, does one alone suffer the consequences, or does it also mislead ancestors and descendants?

Now I see the common people, sons and daughters, born into the world to endure suffering and hardship, unable to free themselves. I see the dead, their forms and souls distressed, wandering among the Three Paths and Five Pains, the Long River and Cold Court, the wind knives and myriad sharp torments, unable to escape. Scriptures say sometimes the sins of ancestors flow down to descendants; sometimes one’s own sins are heavy and mislead ancestors; sometimes good and evil each have their own matching cause; birth and death, sin and blessing each have their own root of fate.

If such retribution and matching of good and evil is true, then each returns to one’s own body; there should be no talk of delay or misguidance. It is also said that without merit and virtue to extract and save the souls of ancestors, there is no way to be freed. Once merit is established, birth and death open and flourish.

If each has their own matching cause, those who commit evil, when they die, sink into the myriad sharp torments, the long dark night; how then can they build great merit to extract and redeem themselves? If descendants build merit for ancestors, it is also a delay; reason allows no difference.

My foolish and shallow understanding cannot grasp this. Since the Heavenly Venerable has opened the great mercy’s transformation, making birth and death universally clear, it is fitting to let the hidden and manifest be fully judged, so the ignorant and dark will not be confused by these two views.

Now that you have been appointed to your office, charged with the great responsibility, you should proclaim the orthodox dharma, open the teaching for future lives, so that the dharma’s sound flows through the heavens, unbroken for countless kalpas, the orthodox Way enduring, birth and death blessed, great mercy clear.

With deep respect I humbly beseech the Heavenly Venerable to look kindly upon this.”

The Heavenly Venerable, both fearful and joyful, answered:  
“Well said, well said! Your question strikes to the heart of profundity. Though you have entered the numinous ruin, the hidden source is not fully exhausted; though you have seen the great mercy, the Dragon River is hard to illuminate.

Qi is boundless, numbers cannot be exhausted; death again births life; darkness again brightens. Heaven and Earth revolve like wheels; man’s imperishability follows shadow and form; thus it is hard to end.

Swallows follow one after another; various causes of life; good and evil, blessing and calamity each have their own root of fate. Neither Heaven nor Earth, nor man, but precisely the heart. The heart is spirit; form is not mine to possess.

I who live come from emptiness and nature; by causes and conditions I lodge in the womb; receiving transformation, I am born. I receive womb and parents, but they are not my true first parents; true parents are not here.

Parents’ love is heavy, respect high and unsurpassed. The parents who give birth now are my temporary cause and condition, receiving and nurturing me; thus I repay them with propriety and call them parents.

Therefore, the form I receive is also not truly mine. I lodge it as a house, build it as a chamber to shelter myself; attach it as form to show existence and non-existence. Thus those who attain the Dao no longer have form.

When I have no body, what have I to fear? The reason for suffering is because I have a body. Having a body, a hundred evils arise; no body, one enters nature.

To stand and act in accord with the Dao, body and spirit become one. Body and spirit united become true body, returning to the original parents and completing the Dao; no more suffering, no death.

Even if extinguished and transcended, the spirit departs but the form does not turn to ash. The whole life returns to its root, never departing.

The body commits a hundred evils; sin ends and death comes; this is called death. Death is destruction, returning to temporary womb and parents. Sin’s cause is not exhausted; cannot return to true parents.

Spirit fills the labor, forms dust; dust flies and transforms into vapor. When soul and spirit are freed, they mix with vapor; thus soul and vapor transform and unite, gaining rebirth, returning as human.

Form and spirit follow each other, never departing. Thus good and evil each have their matching body; how could blame fall on ancestors or descendants?

Before the Dragon River, until the Red Brightness, old texts say birth and death each belong to one body; no upward or downward flow; blessing and sin stop at one; each bears their own.

After Red Brightness, up to the Supreme Emperor, human hearts are broken; men and women impure; jealousy, harm, quiet rivalry; mutual injury; hearts unstable; ancestors invoked above, descendants below, as proof and oath; accusing the divine; yet no self-belief; breaking oaths; causing the Three Officials to be thinly bound; bodies lost to ghost officials; misguiding ancestors; flowing down to descendants; calamity strikes; great and small linked; no end in heaven; disaster reaches the clan.

These evil people bring great calamity upon themselves. The dharma clearly states: never to be the same.

The enlightened accumulate deeds, taking from their own body; seek not from others. The old true canon, how could it be empty words?”

The Heavenly Venerable again told the Supreme Dao Lord:  
“The way of great mercy is to save others first; no merit, no reward; no virtue, no advancement; no faith, no salvation; no practice, no immortality.

Those who build merit and virtue do so for Heaven and Earth, for the Three Luminaries, for emperors and lords, for the myriad people, for ancestors, for family, for all beings, and for themselves.

The scripture says: ‘To save oneself, one must first save others. If others cannot be saved, one cannot save oneself.’

Great mercy is broad and far-reaching, its favor unending; Heaven and humanity rely upon it, much less the seven ancestors and parents.

Can sin and blessing not accumulate? How much more merit and virtue!

Therefore, with cause and condition’s grace, with pure sincerity and self-examination, Heaven returns salvation; one true response; human and spirit open together; how much more for those born in wombs, receiving qi and nurturance!

When love is deep, how could one not build great merit to open salvation and repay the impoverished souls?

Since the Dragon River until Red Brightness, those who attain the Dao and are present in blessing, noble households, good causes for future lives, none but those who accumulate merit and virtue, whose achievements move the heavens, thus repay.

Among the long nights of the Nine Hells, those who are freed are none but those whose merit extracts and redeems, opening salvation to return to humanity.

In the Southern Mound, Vermilion Palace, Nine Capitals, all have their names; the law of retribution is sharply divided without error.

Years and months advance, clearly distinguished.”

The Lord of the Dao made obeisance:  
“Now hearing the Heavenly Venerable’s words on cause and effect, merit and retribution, all doubts vanish; my heart fears and is released; no lingering hesitation remains.

I shall diligently proclaim the great dharma, universally showing all beings of the Infinite World, sons and daughters, that all may respectfully receive and see clearly.”

The Supreme Dao Lord respectfully reported to the Heavenly Venerable:  
“Now that enlightenment has been bestowed and all doubts resolved, I do not understand which merit is foremost.

Seeing the true canonical texts, and the highest wisdom to extract and redeem the root of sin, to complete thus, why then are there other methods? The faith and oath of extraction and redemption, teaching and enlightening the blind, establishing quiet dwellings⁷, offering to the master’s treasure, buying incense and oil, lighting lamps to illuminate the night, hearts practicing good thoughts, saving all beings, love, loyalty, filial piety, distributing to the impoverished, feeding the birds—none withheld.

Among these merits, is there weight or lightness? Are they all equal or ranked high and low, noble and humble? Please graciously instruct.”

The Heavenly Venerable said:  
“All merit built has no great or small, no high or low; its merit is equal in qi. Weight and lightness of retribution depend on the human heart.

A heart that acts without slack, enduring hardship without retreat—this merit is hard to name; virtue is hard to call.

Merely having utmost sincerity but acting without focus may avoid sin but gain no merit. No heart but floating kindness, merely giving without gain.

A wealthy household cherishes treasures, unwilling to scatter; seeking to extract sin’s root by heart alone, hoping for great reward—this will be futile and fruitless.

Heaven’s Way does not force people’s wealth; it observes their stinginess and tests their intent. Having but not scattering—what can be sought?

The poor who awaken their heart, with firm and clear will, comforting the suffering master’s gate, laboring without weariness—the Dao already recognizes them.

Thus giving wealth to match the heart, pushing heart to match wealth—the merit is equal in qi.

The ancients sought heart; the end times seek wealth. The ancients said: without heart no immortality; the end times say: without wealth no salvation.

Therefore qi floats; the end times value wealth not Dao.

With ten thousand pounds of gold, one volume of immortal scripture, given to poor mountains, the end times will covet gold—do they covet the immortal scripture?

Gold harms the body; immortal scriptures extend life; all know this, but cannot escape stinginess and greed.

Since one cannot escape stinginess and greed, how can one blame the Dao? Thus it is not the Dao that spreads among people.

The clear true canonical methods, the highest wisdom, extracting and saving sin’s root, applied to birth and death, is a weighty dharma.

As for scholars whose bodies have not entered meditation, dwelling in the noisy dust, able to avoid faults—actions and deeds have both sin and blessing.

Thus the Three Officials, Nine Mansions, one hundred and twenty bureaus, left and right yin and yang, water and fire examiners, oversee human gains and losses.

Good deeds are listed in the left palace; evil deeds in the right palace; each according to year, month, day, number, distance, to examine and urge; light and heavy retribution like waves meeting, surely reaching their appointed time, never failing.

This is only to speak of weight and distance.

Now therefore I tell you, diligently proclaim this, so all beings, men and women, good people, may universally know that Heaven and Earth have unerring response.

This is the true word.

Now I entrust you with the Three Origins’ method of repentance.

The Primordial Supreme Dao’s old text, secretly stored in the Three Origins Palace, priceless and unique, not transmitted to the lower world.

Those who hope for its chapters, their old roots will self-extract; bindings will self-loosen; treasure and practice it; surely great blessing will come; lightly and carelessly, disaster will reach and destroy the clan.

Speak with sincere heart; deeply guard the canonical methods.”

The Lord of the Dao, fearful and joyful, bowed and made obeisance.

At this time, all the heavens simultaneously praised: “Good!”

## Inner Sounds of the Numinous Treasure Heavens: Natural Jade Characters, Part Three

The Primordial Heavenly Venerable, at this time with the Five Elders, the great saints of the Ten Directions, the Perfected Ones of the Infinite, all venerable elders, together in the Red Brightness World, at the Cypress Mound Abode, seated in the incense garden beneath the long mulberry tree.

The Heavenly Venerable returned his chariot; the heavens descended their seats.

At this time, clouds and mist surged thickly; the Four Luminaries merged in darkness; three days and three nights, mysterious yin unresolved; Heaven and Earth without light; as before the Dragon River, deep and dim.

The Five Elders advanced and bowed, reporting to the Heavenly Venerable:  
“Today serving at the seat, never before experienced.

When the Heavenly Venerable travels, all heavens incline their chariots.

The High Elders, divine immortals, jade maidens; sun, moon, stars; variegated jade balances; officials of the Three Realms; gods of the Five Mountains; river, sea, water emperors; all spirits, none not alert and solemn; attending the heavenly truth.

On the day of qi floating, the sky is bright and clear; wind does not shake branches; earth has no flying dust; rivers and seas are still and silent; mountains hide their smoke; time is harmonious and peaceful; causing birth and death to fear alike.

Yet the heavenly light is closed; the white day is dark; Heaven and humanity panic; the four seats are uneasy.

I do not know why this is so; please graciously instruct, so all may see clearly, greatly benefit, and universally attain safety.”

The Heavenly Venerable said:  
“Today at this assembly, joy and fear are hard to encounter; the heavens send auspicious signs; numinous responses arise naturally; the jade palace shines brilliantly; revealing the failing heavenly light.

The beginning of the unopened causes the day to be dark; the sun and celebration coincide; rare and never before seen.

Now I shall universally open the heavenly wondrous auspices for the four assemblies; save all people; all seats close their eyes and bow to the ground.”

Then the great saints simultaneously closed their eyes and bowed to listen to the command.

In a moment, the dark sky’s gloom vanished; the darkness and obscurity cleared; five-colored light shone, penetrating the Ten Directions.

Suddenly a heavenly book appeared; characters one zhang square; naturally visible above the mysterious void in five-colored light.

The writing shone brilliantly; eight corners hung rays; essence light dazzled the eyes; impossible to look upon.

The Heavenly Venerable asked the four assemblies:  
“The numinous book’s eight assemblies, characters without fixed form, their meaning profound and obscure, hard to seek and explain.

Heaven has sent this response; the wondrous dao should be clarified; now you may take pen and annotate, explain its true sound, so the imperial dao may be smooth and its grace reach the Ten Directions.”

The Numinous True Imperial Person bowed and made obeisance, saying to the Heavenly Venerable:  
“Since following the cycle of birth and death, turning through countless kalpas, often serving at the seat, never before have I encountered the sacred dao opening all dharma gates, seeing the heavenly book, naturally most true.

This eight-assembly framework, combining five harmonies of sound, is beyond foolish and brief thought to penetrate.

Now seated, I look upon the profound mystery; by command I dare not hide feelings; trembling with awe; if not for divine protection, I would exhaust all I see to interpret its sound, hoping for even one accord; opening teaching for future lives not yet reached; only by your compassion.”

Then the brush was poised; the Great Truth swept the mat; jade maidens held cloth; golden youths raised incense; the Moon Palace scattered flowers; the Sun Essence observed the ferry; the Five Elders supervised the test; the Three Realms guarded the truth; dividing its portions and degrees.

Thirty-two heavens, each with eight characters.

The Great Yellow Imperial Ancestor Heaven, the Great Bright Jade Complete Heaven, Clear Brightness He Tong Heaven, Mysterious Womb Balanced Nurturing Heaven, Primordial Brightness Literary Elevation Heaven, Seven Luminaries Mo Yi Heaven, Void Nothing Crossing Balance Heaven, Supreme Ultimate Obscuring Heaven—these eight heavens combine sixty-four characters, positioned in the Eastern Nine Ao Azure Heaven.

The Red Brightness Harmonious Yang Heaven, Mysterious Brightness Reverent Splendor Heaven, Radiant Brightness Ancestral Floating Heaven, Bamboo Drop Imperial Jia⁸ Heaven, Void Brightness Hall Radiance Heaven, Observing Brightness Upright Tranquil Heaven, Mysterious Brightness Reverent Celebration Heaven, Great Radiance Extreme Shaking Heaven—these eight heavens combine sixty-four characters, positioned in the Southern Three Black Cinnabar Heaven.

The Primordial Carrier Kong Sheng Heaven, Great Peace Imperial Cliff Heaven, Manifest Stable Extreme Wind Heaven, Beginning Yellow Filial Radiance Heaven, Great Yellow Elder Heavy Heaven, No Thought River Origin Heaven, Supreme Stack Ruan Music Heaven, Infinite Tan Oath Heaven—these eight heavens combine sixty-four characters, positioned in the Western Seven Ao White Heaven.

The Bright Court Dawn Crossing Heaven, Abyss Connecting Primordial Cavern Heaven, Writing Favorable Wonderful Accomplishment Heaven, Elegant Music Forbidden Upper Heaven, Supreme Constant Fusion Heaven, Great Release Soaring Victory Heaven, Dragon Transformation Brahma Crossing Heaven, Supreme Ultimate Balanced Nurturing Jia Yi Heaven—these eight heavens combine sixty-four characters, positioned in the Northern Five Qi Mysterious Heaven.

Four times eight, thirty-two heavens; together two hundred and fifty-six characters, all the great Brahma secret language of the heavens, immeasurable sounds.

Heaven has flying mystery natural black, harmonizing the five sounds, forming the immeasurable mysterious chapters in the center of heaven.

They manifest the heavens’ mysterious depths; praise the great existence’s enlightenment; the middle principle’s natural qi; universally save those learning immortality; descend to save the fated of birth and death; extract the souls of the long night.

The Primordial wondrous dharma endures countless kalpas; its sound once clear, its dao proceeds.

The great dharma opens enlightenment; heavens acclaim; infinite great saints; perfected true lords; Five Elders; honored gods of the Ten Directions; divine immortals and jade maidens; at one time incense is offered; circling three times; then chanting:

> The Heavenly Venerable returns the jade chariot, descends to the incense garden.  
> Perfected true great saints, Infinite Heavenly King.  
> Divine immortals guide sun and moon, luxuriant in cloud palaces.  
> Five Emperors wing the splendid chariot, Three Realms prepare the Ten Directions.  
> Sun and celebration fill the true assembly seats, joy beyond compare.  
> Wondrous assembly naturally responds, numinous auspices arise from the void.  
> Brilliantly opening the hidden promise, veiling sun and moon’s light.  
> Mysterious yin unresolved at night, the four assemblies all reverent.  
> Numinous movement follows the chart, cultivating and gathering in bright great void.  
> Numinous book’s eight assemblies of characters, five sounds combined into chapters.  
> Heavenly truth explains wondrous rhyme, ringing clear with great understanding.  
> Jade voices hard to open, universally completing Heaven and Earth’s work.  
> Above planting the heavens’ root, lofty among divine immortal lineages.  
> Middle manifesting mysterious caverns, illuminating the eight hidden chambers.  
> Opening salvation for birth and death’s fate, extracting the long night’s public.  
> Hell’s five pains resolved, knife mountains bear no peaks.  
> Five paths without matching souls, countless kalpas with few children.  
> Grand great vehicle transformation, all works without partial merit.  
> Infinite great saints®—this is the supreme king.  
> Overcome with awe and joy, flying steps chant the numinous chapter.  
> Heavenly Venerable opens great existence, lofty heavens brightened.  
> Wondrous indeed, the Dragon River Way, eight assemblies form shape.  
> Brilliantly flying within the void, streaming light in the Three Realms’ court.  
> Divine chart opens numinous assembly, jade book responds to the occasion.  
> Heavenly truth penetrates wondrous meaning, five harmonies combine into scripture.  
> Ringing jade voices resound, drifting green to Supreme Clarity.  
> Opening salvation without end kalpa, Nine Hells receive the light.  
> Lofty great dharma gate, teaching all beings.  
> This merit is beyond measure, fearing joy celebrating ten thousand years.

At this time, grace flows universally, favor reaches the Ten Directions; faith turns toward the undying; all attain long life; the old return to youth; the sick are immediately healed; dry bones grow soft; dead souls return to people; five pains all resolved; hells peaceful; those with intention all become immortals.

The Heavenly Venerable told the four assemblies of perfected ones:  
“Today at this seat, within one kalpa, the heavenly mysteries open; the natural jade book saves all people; its blessing vast and universal; widely benefits all beings.

The great dharma is thus formed; grace pervades without exception; the Infinite World all receives light; the Nine Hells open forgiveness; the long night pardons souls; the living fear and rejoice; the dead are granted return.

Heavenly peoples, old acquaintances and kindred, male or female, good or evil roots of fate, come from the Primordial Origin to this seat.

Birth and death turn; calamity and cause are linked; Heaven and Earth’s success and failure; merit and fault hard to clarify.

Now, relying on great mercy, universally proclaim to the heavens, sun, moon, stars; variegated jade balances; Southern and Northern Dippers; masters of fate and qi; Lord Han’s register; Southern Prosperity Upper Palace; all lands and waters; Five Mountains and numinous hills; Three Officials and Nine Bureaus; Twelve River Sources; the long night’s mansion in the Nine Hells; Four Officials and Five Emperors; all spirits; gathering hairpins and recording registers; checking and verifying origins; no good or evil; roots of light and heavy; birth and death separated; names listed and recorded; all cut off; all causes severed; universally one celebration; taking now as new; letting this one kalpa all attain true dao; great blessing universal; no partiality.

The Heavenly Venerable commands; all heavens respectfully follow.

Then the four assemblies simultaneously rose and bowed; raised hands pointing upward; lowered hands pointing downward; no highest or lowest; no limit or end; no depth or distance; no hidden or secret; no great or small; countless and endless; all universally saved; together shining brightly; waving fingers to command all to hear.

At this time, the four assemblies simultaneously raised hands, looked to heaven, snapped fingers; thirty-two heavens, sun, moon, stars all illuminated; underground Nine Hells; bottomless Infinite; light and shadow penetrated; no more darkness; hidden places all revealed; Earth Storehouse exposed its form; mountains, rivers, streams all equally level; winter flowers bear fruit; withered trees sprout vigor; celebrations increase for all; merit carries all beings; fish and dragons leap; birds and beasts sing joyfully; numinous songs intertwine; roads without sorrow; Heaven quiet, Earth still; Three Officials secretly peaceful; registers rest; Five Paths no longer generate souls; humans and spirits fear peace; the sacred dao is great peace.

The Numinous True Imperial Person said:  
“The inner sounds of the Numinous Treasure’s natural jade characters are all the great Brahma secret language among the heavens; binding flying mysteries’ softness; harmonizing the five directions’ sounds; born above the Primordial Origin; emerging from the hollow void; following cycles to open salvation; universally accomplishing Heaven and Earth’s work.

This text is revered and wondrous, not revealed to the common.

Therefore, opening the beginning of existence, closing heavenly light, to treasure its dao and honor its text.

Its characters are profound; not like shapeless heavenly books; planted with precious mysterious images; hiding their utmost truth; wondrous responses and charts; its dharma operates.

The Heavenly Venerable does not rely on my talent, but seeing the command, makes me explain its meaning, communicate its jade sounds.

The mysterious method has rules; I dare not disobey orders.

On the day of poised brush, form and soul suddenly lost; I record what I see; right or wrong; utmost my own mind.

The imperial dao now clear; heavens acclaim; all gain support; birth and death both fear; great blessing universal.

My feelings rejoice; only wish all four assemblies may see and understand.”

Then the four assemblies of perfected true honored gods simultaneously praised: “Good!”

Heaven above and earth below; infinite and boundless worlds; all spirits; none not virtuous; revering the great saints; rejoicing in the dao’s enlightenment.

Only wish the great dharma widely saves without end; blessings flow for countless kalpas; generations endure; celebrations increase; all attain true dao; beyond measure.

The four assemblies simultaneously rose, bowed, and accepted the command.

The Numinous True Imperial Person respectfully reported to the Heavenly Venerable:  
“Since receiving sun and moon, following cycles, coming and going, revolving wheel; one light one dark; one extinguish one cross; one death one life; body suffers destruction; one defeat one success; traversing Heaven and Earth; changing light; deep and mysterious; beyond thought.

Since the Dragon River, already ninety-nine million nine hundred ninety thousand kalpas; causes and effects linked; generations unbroken; until today.

I have been born in royal houses; born in lowly homes; born in wealthy mansions; born in poverty and cold; born noble; born servant; suffered six diseases; received light; received wisdom; received dull deafness.

All actions complete; body not yet settled; evil causes arise; acting without dao; not human behavior.

Disrespecting Heaven and Earth; not fearing ghosts and gods; neither loving nor filial; harming all beings; death follows sword tree; feet tread knife mountains.

Some enter cold night; some enter boiling cauldron; wandering the Three Paths and Five Pains; form and soul beaten; pain and poison abound; countless kalpas facing suffering; then reborn among six beasts.

Life short; again suffer death and destruction; then reborn filling the Five Mountains’ long labor; east and west serve; nothing unchanged; thousand kalpas of suffering; then reborn among border tribes.

Though human form, no human feeling.

Life short; again suffer death and destruction; soul bears four rivers; beaten by dark waves; wandering cold ice; day and night no peace; hundred kalpas end; then reborn among lowly people; six diseases, ugly, hateful to the extreme.

Life short; again suffer death and destruction; soul enters long night Nine Hells; assigned to Three Rivers; blocked in long source; cold and sharp cutting flesh; all pains experienced; one kalpa ends; then reborn at human gate; form upright; human path complete.

Life short; again suffer death and destruction; soul and spirit return to Three Officials; officials hasten to hundreds of extremes; wandering ghost courts; ten thousand years of sin end; then reborn at gate of good people; wealth not lacking.

Though receiving ease and peace; life short; again suffer death and destruction; soul and spirit return to Three Officials; good ghosts receive office as city elders; managing birth and death; thousand years root cut; then reborn; spirit clear and penetrating; seat sees ghosts and gods; commands and summons; assists country and governs people; sometimes aids emperors to judge the four directions.

Life short; again suffer death and destruction; soul and spirit become guests of Five Emperors; mingle with immortals; hundred years root matched and extinguished; earth’s punishment finished; Three Officials’ registers ended; heavens record names; then reborn at gate of wealth and honor; noble houses; glory and salary hard to surpass.

Root exhausted, blessing born; arise great vow; distribute to impoverished; widely build merit; then receive extinction and transcendence; directly ascend to heaven; carefree fear and joy; clothes and food natural.

After twenty-four years, reborn in noble gate; receive wisdom of firewood; five hearts open and clear; cultivate and serve scriptures and dharma; despise wealth, value dao; compassionate heart for all; serve and revere master’s treasure.

Merit incomplete; again receive extinction and transcendence; ascend to Southern Palace; Vermilion Mound fixes my fate register; Three Realms record my merit name; circulate through Ten Directions and Thirty-two Heavens; mingle with supreme saints; be guest of the Supreme; ten years return to humanity; body becomes master and ancestor; proclaim and fully communicate dharma sounds; open salvation for heaven and humanity; teach and transform all beings.

Turning through countless kalpas; nothing untraversed; fully facing Three Officials’ punishments; life limit near; yet again acting with evil heart; sin doubled; again suffer death and destruction; again return to Three Officials; face punishments; suffering beyond before.

Thus one good and one evil; one lenient and one severe; one death and one life; one pity and one fear; difficult to endure and turn; among countless kalpas; all evil leaks exhausted; blessing and virtue arise; then return to gate of wealth and honor; dao and virtue’s cause; offering scriptures and dharma; seven treasures announce to spirits; arise good wishes; merit and fame complete; raised by Three Realms; illuminated by Five Emperors; descend to cloud carriage, eight scenes, jade wheels; ride the void, ascend floating; white sun rises morning; covered by Heavenly Venerable; deeply receiving great grace; sweeping away decayed bones; gaining light; transcending the Three Realms; position rising to heavenly truth.

Today serving at the seat, fear and joy hard to express; Heavenly Venerable does not consider my shallow talent; touching matters beyond ability; seeing command to annotate; explain heavenly sounds; ordered strict teaching; dare not hide feelings; only express what I see; all from my heart.

Though not fully detailed; yet traversing past lives’ countless kalpas; wandering the heavenly origin; following dharma of birth and death; always encountering true texts; naturally following their mysterious transformations; penetrating the root; how dare I use private faults to secretly explain the natural book; to interpret the obscure text; to shake the jade and brilliant direction; to knock on the jade and precious sound.

Though the meaning is not complete; it suffices to fully unfold Heaven and Earth’s root.

Among the heavens, vast and varied in degrees; no form or change; sun, moon, stars; palaces, mountains, forests; perfected persons, cities, towers; and demon kings, ghosts, gods; all their responses and origins are profound; not all can be detailed.

Asking about causes and effects is already recorded in old texts; no need to repeat; it would be tedious.

Now roughly explaining the fivefold meaning of the heavenly book; its dao suffices to open salvation for heaven and humanity; extract all roots of suffering; great dharma opens and spreads; grace reaches the Ten Directions.

This life and the next, men and women, good people, shall all receive this grace.

Yet according to the Primordial Yang Jade Treasury, the Nine Heavens calculate numbers and cycles; numinous passes revolve; thirty-two heavens one crossing; false dao arises; myriad hearts corrupted; quietly all revere it.

This text should return to the Great Luo above, the Seven Treasures Palace.

After three or five cycles, myriad dao’s momentum ends; great dragons arise; next life saves people; destroys false seats; expels rebellious folk; dao and virtue flourish; world peace; rulers enjoy mandate; Ten Directions peaceful.

True scriptures assist the world; auspicious sun rises.

At the beginning of the Renzi year, the Yimao year, and the Jiazi decade, there will be the Blue Emperor’s nine kinds of immortals, riding nine-colored dragons, traveling Mount Tai, using this true scripture to sweep away all remnants.

True scripture descends to the world; horn sounds dragon essence; encountering our dao; its mandate self-strengthens; to protect the Jia Shen year; universally save heaven and humanity; at that time fear and joy; this is the scripture’s merit.

Those who revere it enjoy blessing; those who cultivate it become immortals.

This text is profound and mysterious; broadly covering the endless; great dharma revered.

Humbly beseech the Heavenly Venerable to universally proclaim to the heavens, great emperors, great saints, sun, moon, stars; earth above and below; Five Mountains and Four Rivers; river and sea water emperors; divine immortals and perfected persons; all worlds of the Ten Directions; all officials; all rely on the great existence’s standard; registers fully uphold it; prohibiting laziness and neglect; secret and reverent.

At this time, the Heavenly Venerable raised hand and waved finger; heaven above and earth below; infinite worlds; all spirits; none not secretly reverent.

All great saints of the heavens simultaneously bowed; long knelt praising.

The Heavenly Venerable told the four seats of great saints, Infinite Supreme Great Dao Lord, thirty-two heavens, Ten Directions honored gods, and the Numinous True Imperial Person:

“Before the Dragon River, in the midst of extended health, following cycles of birth and death; until the Dragon River, receiving cause and effect; soul and form suffering; wandering the Three Officials; causes exhausted, roots cut; entering the gate of blessing; traversing Heaven and Earth; one success one failure; no limit or end; encountering the heavenly origin; always meeting the Numinous Treasure; world after world issuing dharma; transforming and saving heaven and humanity.

Therefore, to thoroughly investigate heavenly matters; able to explain the heavenly book’s natural text; great dharma opens enlightenment; heavens revere it; fitting to proclaim the utmost reason; sound clear and ringing.

Hence ordered to annotate and explain its obscure text; harmonizing the five directions’ immeasurable sounds; to form the heavens; universally save future lives; its mystery can be believed and revered.

Numinous sounds now ringing; heavens bright; heaven above and earth below; Ten Directions infinite worlds; all spirits; none not revering.

According to the clear true mysterious method’s rules; with twenty-four jade boys and twenty-four jade girls; burning incense attending truth; checking for negligence and error; not lightly proclaiming.

Once every forty thousand kalpas, issuing to the next world to save people; clearly checking and guarding; not allowing false words.

At this time, the four assemblies simultaneously bowed; praised ‘Good!’”

The Numinous True Imperial Person said:  
“The heavenly book is revered; saving people without measure; precious and granting blessing; negligence brings disaster.

Among these heavens, those who have attained the Dao, past Infinite Great Saints, Perfected True Gods, flying heavenly spirits, Five Mountains immortals—all fully receive reverence; heavenly natural sounds form the ultimate truth.

Without prior destiny in the golden register, jade characters of Supreme Clarity, one never sees it.

Escaping from negligence and laziness, seeing its chapters, spirits confused in heart, never opening enlightenment.

Having their destined portion, they arise in heart; joy in the divine text; born to meet its age; encountering the text; relying on the Seven Treasures text ribbons’ faith; going to masters to swear allegiance; upper gates of the heavens; receiving and preparing the body.

Having prepared this text, all heavens respect; Three Realms acclaim; Five Emperors serve; earth gods welcome; all spirits none not attending the gate; will extract the nine ancestors from the long night; open salvation for dead souls in the Nine Hells; return again to wombs of numinous swallows; receive birth at gate of wealth and honor; long mingle with heavens; accompany Mount Tai’s guests.”

The Five Elders’ Emperor Lords proclaimed to all heavens, earth’s Five Mountains and numinous hills, Three Rivers and Nine Seas, divine immortals, perfected persons, jade maidens, all gods:  
“The Numinous True Imperial Person opens the great existence’s wondrous dharma; communicates the natural numinous text; heavenly book revered; forbidden to lightly transmit.

Now living men and women, hearts without doubt; reverent and faithful to nature; all who receive it ascend and transcend; all who serve it gain long life.

Light wealth, value dharma; avoid demons speaking.

Next life men and women, hearts broken; each harboring false cunning; valuing wealth and despising dao; not believing the utmost truth; even if returning, mostly with vanity; will not focus will; greedy and thieving; causing demons to speak.

Therefore, the mysterious method forbids; with Seven Treasures text ribbons; testing human hearts.

Those with highest learning, following the method to ascend in faith; then naming the heavens; reporting to Five Mountains; earth gods and immortals; all names recorded; proclaiming to demon kings; recommending the Three Pure Ones.

Yet afterward transmitting, how could it violate the mysterious method? Bearing wind knives; ten thousand kalpas no return; nine ancestors filling night; long service at river source.

All spirits clearly understand these words.”

The Numinous True Imperial Person told the Five Elders’ Emperor Lords:  
“I shall, amid the Dragon River, receive the text from the Nameless Everlasting Lord.

The bow and gaze ritual; with cinnabar brush write the heavens’ eight characters’ sounds; combining two hundred and fifty-six characters; using yellow ribbons to prepare the body.

According to the clear true mysterious method; with gold, silver, ivory, amber, crystal, carnelian, horse brain; seven treasures to guard the spirit.

Five-colored text ribbons each measure one chi; to serve the divine truth.

The mysterious method’s words and dharma must not be violated.

As for those with heart, impoverished and unprepared, precious to gain the dark register; measure their weight and lightness; suitably grant.

From the inner sounds.”

¹ The title is reconstructed based on Dunhuang manuscript S.6659. The scroll’s beginning is missing; the end is intact, titled “Preface to the Many Chapters.” This corresponds to the “Many Scriptures Preface, one scroll” recorded in the *Numinous Treasure Central Alliance Scripture Catalogue*. The Kyoto 253 manuscript titles it “Supreme Cavernous Numinous Treasure Wondrous Scripture Many Chapters Preface.”  
² Based on later content, the beginning missing from S.6659 is likely the upper scroll of the *Supreme Cavernous Numinous Treasure Five Chapters True Text Red Script Scripture*.  
³ “No shadow untouched” is rendered from variant readings meaning “not closed” or “not blocked.”  
⁷ “Quiet dwellings” variant readings include “quiet observation” or “quiet temple.”  
⁸ The character “笳” is a musical instrument name here indicating a celestial melody.
