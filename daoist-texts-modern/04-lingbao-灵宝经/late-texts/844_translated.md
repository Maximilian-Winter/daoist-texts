# Scripture of the Mysterious Profundity and Numinous Treasure: The Creation of the Worlds of the Many Heavens

## Chapter One: The Heavenly Venerable’s Discourse Opening the Scripture

The Most High Heavenly Venerable dwelt upon Spirit Bird Mountain, discoursing with the celestial beings on twelve divisions of scripture. Then he divided these into four hundred thousand sections, which his disciples recorded, hence called the Sublime Dao. At that time, the Heavenly Venerable transformed into a layman, his wisdom boundless, and declared to the assembly:

“Since I began to study the dao, through ninety-one kalpas, I have severed desire and thought, attaining the state of no-thought, and thus become the sovereign among all sages. With penetrating illumination, I have witnessed Heaven and Earth fall apart and be reformed, sentient beings die and be reborn, endlessly without cessation. Like the sun and moon circling Kunlun Mountain, revolving and shining upon the Ten Directions. The world cycles endlessly without pause.

“There are four thousand Kunlun Mountains, four thousand suns and moons, four thousand worlds; four thousand great seas, four thousand palaces of the great Dragon Kings, four thousand palaces of the great Golden Winged Bird Kings; the great evil paths rise tens of thousands of li, great divine mountains rise thousands of li, great divine trees of myriad kinds, and vast hells of the earth. Together these form what you call the count of the small kalpa worlds; one thousand such small kalpa worlds make the count of the middle kalpa worlds; one thousand middle kalpa worlds make the Three Realms.

“The great kalpa worlds begin from these, and after seven days all emerge together, burning and destroying all, utterly swept away, then reformed again as before, without end or rest. This is the natural way, without divine intervention. Just as sentient beings die and are reborn, only their lifespan is long and hidden, unknown to men.

“When sentient beings die, their form perishes but their spirit moves on, all according to the karmic debts and merits made in life, arriving at the Five Paths. What are the Five Paths? First, the path of Heaven; second, the path of Man; third, the path of Hell; fourth, the path of Hungry Ghosts; fifth, the path of Beasts and Insects.

“If one in life accumulates deep merit, entering the highest blessings, one is born into the path of Heaven, enjoying long life, good form, boundless peace and happiness, and knows the affairs of past fate and cause. If one’s blessings are moderate, one is born into the human path, gaining wealth and honor, lacking nothing. If one’s blessings are slight and sins many, one is born into the low blessings, entering poverty and lowly station, suffering all evils, unable to find relief, perhaps afflicted with blindness, deafness, muteness, or other six ailments, ugly and servile, foul and restless in body.

“The above two paths, though differing in quality, are still better than the suffering of the lower three paths. If one is stingy, greedy, miserly, refusing to give to the hungry and thirsty, not aiding the poor and urgent, one is born into the path of Hungry Ghosts. One takes the form of a ghost, belly like a hanging drum, throat narrow as a thread, seeing delicious food but unable to eat, enduring endless hunger, ugly in form, living long yet unable to die.

“If one in life disrespects parents, shows no kindness to kin, harms the common people, and is hated by the masses, one is born into the path of Hell. One takes the form of a sin demon, constantly tormented and tortured beyond words.

“If one delights in killing living beings, hunts and slaughters for a living, knowing not the cultivation of merit but only evil deeds, one is born into the path of Beasts, becoming sheep, cattle, pigs, geese, chickens, ducks, suffering slaughter and sale as repayment for past deeds.

“Who can see this but those who have attained the dao? For you do not yet believe, therefore I speak in verse:

> Heaven and Earth surely change,  
> What can endure forever?  
> Birth must enter death,  
> Spirit follows the Five Paths.  
>
> Should any dare deceive,  
> Hell’s bonds will hold them fast.  
> Only cultivate good deeds,  
> Repent and root out sin.

“The Most High’s shining talisman, practiced without slackening, transcends the Three Realms, escapes the Five Sufferings, the turning wheel unextinguished, attaining the rank of the True Person.”

## Chapter Two: The King of Kunlun Mountain and the Four Worlds Beneath

The Dao says: “Before the mysterious transformation, I bore the title Most High. I saw the King of Kunlun Mountain, made of gold, silver, lapis lazuli, and crystal water. It rises three million three hundred and thirty-six thousand li high, surrounded below by a great sea equally deep and wide. The earth beneath is two trillion li deep. Below that lies land, also two trillion li deep. Below that lies millet gold twenty billion li deep, then hard iron twenty billion li, then water eighty billion li deep, then great wind five hundred and twenty billion li thick. This great wind supports the earth, causing it to float upon the water, which floats upon the wind, with vast emptiness below, a realm unlike Heaven and Earth.

“To the north of Kunlun Mountain, golden light shines upon the world called Yudan Yue, spanning four hundred thousand li, where people live a thousand years. Their hair is dark and glossy; men and women are equal in height; all love goodness and no longer teach evil. Among the four worlds, this is the most excellent, surpassing the other three.

“To the west, water crystal light shines upon the world called the Great Tang Realm, shaped like a half-moon, thirty-two thousand li wide, where people live two hundred years. Their heights and lifespans vary as among men.

“To the east, silver light shines upon the world called the Azure Realm, forty-six thousand li wide, perfectly round, where people live three hundred years, some long, some short, all with human affairs and lifespans.

“To the south, glaze light shines upon the world called the Realm of the Forsaken Worthies, twenty-eight thousand li wide. Its people’s lifespans vary, suffering the greatest hardships among the four worlds and the higher heavens. Their years are uncertain, yet one matter surpasses the other three and the higher heavens: these people are brave and fierce, and the dao is easy to seek.

“If one cultivates merit and follows my dao, one directly ascends to the heavenly realms, or leaves the Three Realms to attain the supreme dao. If one accumulates sin, one dies into hell, with no fixed rank in a moment.

“Kunlun Mountain lies within the Yellow Zeng World. The Imperial Lord of the Supreme Subtlety sometimes dwells at its center. Four Heavenly Kings each guard a direction, each ruling a realm, and on the first and eighth days of each month send messengers down to inspect the world, observing emperors, ministers, dragons, ghosts, insects, worms, and creeping things, their thoughts, words, and deeds, good and evil.

“On the fourteenth day, perfected beings descend; on the fifteenth and eighteenth, immortal kings descend; on the twenty-third and twenty-fourth, messengers descend again; on the twenty-eighth and twenty-ninth, immortal kings descend; on the thirtieth, all heavenly kings descend. These four descendents are the sun, moon, five planets, and the Twenty-Eight Constellations; all the heavens descend in multitude to observe those who commit evil and sin.

“You should on these days change your heart and improve your conduct, hold fast to fasting and repentance, recite scripture and keep precepts, and only do good deeds. Those who do so are loved and protected by the Heavenly Official, their fate managed and extended, fulfilling their natural lifespan without injustice. When their time ends, they ascend to heaven, clothed and fed naturally, enjoying endless peace.

“This teaching is true, but you do not yet believe, so I speak in verse:

> Observe the four worlds,  
> No secret words are hidden.  
> Life flashes like lightning,  
> How can one not cultivate merit?  
>
> Deep in dark hells,  
> Countless kalpa years pass.  
> Heaven’s laws grant no pardon,  
> To whom shall one appeal?

> Heaven’s law rides the truth,  
> Correcting demons and evil gods.  
> Talismans rise, blessings arrive,  
> Ascending with the dao afar.  
> The Mysterious Capital commands,  
> Breaking law means no pardon.  
> Hurry, as the law commands.”

## Chapter Three: The Sun and Moon Revolve over the Four Worlds and the Celestial Realms

The Dao says: “On Kunlun Mountain, thirty-six thousand li square, dwell the divine and sacred, each in their place. There are the Sun and Moon Sovereigns, full of light, illuminating all worlds. Within the Moon City, five winds circulate, and the moon holds four palaces and five ladies, with the soaring tree rising four thousand li high, casting shadows in the moon’s midst. Good people who see it find the tree bears fruit, indescribable.

“There are seven immortal retreats, seven treasure mountains, seven treasure trees. These immortals constantly cultivate my dao, never suffering premature death or loss of lifespan.

“If you desire to be born among these long-lived heavens, cultivate these five things:

1. A compassionate heart that does not kill, cherishing all life.  
2. Being virtuous and honest, aiding the poor and urgent.  
3. Maintaining purity of mind, not violating external desires.  
4. Observing fasts and guarding precepts, diligent without weariness.  
5. Being truthful and not deceitful, reducing wine and guarding against faults.

“Practice these five, and you will surely be born in heaven. Since you do not believe, I speak in verse:

> Time flows beyond control,  
> Alas, life is swift.  
> How can one not root out sin,  
> When the Heavenly Official records all?

> Once gone, no rescue,  
> Souls sink into hell.  
> Hurry to be born in heaven,  
> Avoid the Three Paths’ touch.”

“The Most High’s venerable talisman of spirit, nurturing all beings, opening the blind and dark, blending wondrous fragrances, cultivating the heart with reverence, grants the golden light body and boundless lifespan. Hurry, as the law commands.”

## Chapter Four: The Great Cavern of the Worlds of the Many Heavens

The Dao says: “Among the Three Realms, sentient beings have three modes of birth: flower birth, transformation birth, and womb birth.

“Flower birth occurs to those with deep merit, born within lotus flowers as heavenly beings. Transformation birth occurs to those with divine power of merit, born through metamorphosis. Only womb birth, with shallow merit, is the lowest, relying on flesh and form, with short lifespan, inferior to heavenly beings.

“Though heavenly beings enjoy bliss, they remain within the Three Realms; when their lifespan ends, they are reborn below, unable to attain the dao.

“True persons do not die; they can be and not be. Diamond cannot hold them firm, stone walls cannot block them, thunder cannot drive them away, water and fire cannot harm them, the heavens cannot separate them, wisdom cannot be surpassed, ghosts and gods all bow before them. All living beings look up to them. They are the supreme people of the Three Realms, those who attain the dao merge with the void, infinite and boundless.

“Those born by transformation first accumulate good merit and respond to transformation. To hope for transcendence is like freeing a trapped beast, seeking the dao forgetting death. One must practice myriad good deeds, sever worldly ties, live hidden in mountains and forests, honor the grass sage, fast day and night, bathe and cleanse, wash mouth and tongue, avoid foul foods. Now the spirit clings, harming no living being, following only the dao, vowing never to break off, attaining the dao and flying as immortals.

“This teaching is spoken to the immortal officials and Daoist priests who wear the ceremonial robes, not for emperors or ministers. But if one can respect and practice the Ten Virtues, uphold the Five Precepts, avoid the Ten Evils, one will surely be born in the highest heaven, with lifespan of eight kalpas, and if also saintly, will attain the dao. This is no deception.

“All the heavens respond to merit, granting wishes accordingly. The records of merit in the immortal capital and among the many demons and spirits who come to listen increase rank and clan, quickly attaining the path of heaven, becoming golden light true persons, never slighting the laws of the Mysterious Capital, officials clear as the law commands.”

## Chapter Five: The Small and Great Kalpas: The Fall and Reformation of Heaven and Earth

The Dao says: “The earth suffers three disasters: fire, water, and wind. First comes the small kalpa, then the great kalpa.

“When the small kalpa arrives, yin and yang energies change, water and drought become unbalanced, five grains fail, all wood, stone, grass, and thorns, and even the fingers and claws of beings turn into swords and spears, killing one another, people dying out, their lives shortened, deceived in mind, within seven days all kill each other off.

“A great flood overflows, cleansing Heaven and Earth, mountains and rivers change, land is leveled. Sweet dew descends, true persons descend, their bodies shining bright, called Kunlun. At that time, floodwaters are sweet and remove suffering, one kind of seven gains. If any impurity arises, the earth splits and then heals. People live eighty thousand years; women marry at five hundred years. The world is joyous, like the higher heavens.

“After the true persons depart, later generations gradually accumulate sin. After tens of millions of years, hell overflows, the great kalpa approaches. Emperors, ministers, fathers, and sons destroy one another; loyalty and filial piety vanish; rulers lack kindness and mercy; thieves rise rampant; rebellion continues; suffering is worse than before the great kalpa.

“Under the four heavens, human nature turns wholly evil; no longer are there the pure customs of old. Then the great kalpa begins; great disasters arise, two days together, then three, four, five, six, seven days, lasting tens of trillions of years; rivers and seas dry up; all beings perish.

“The Heavenly Venerable looks upon the earth; men and women scatter like grass of the earth, their color darkens, losing brightness, their bodies grow heavy, unable to fly away, dwelling in suffering below.

“Moved by pity for their suffering, the Heavenly Venerable commands the sun and moon to be reborn, stars to pass again, wind and rain to be timely, sweet dew to fall, pure springs to flow, no disease among people, flowers bright and splendid. Lifespan is sixty thousand years, eating natural grains, wearing natural clothes.

“In later generations, human nature declines, sin sprouts, lifespan shortens, natural food and clothing vanish, people begin eating flesh of birds and beasts, wearing their skins and feathers, killing each other anew, sin accumulating day by day, yin and yang unbalanced, rain and drought irregular, winter spent in holes, summer in nests to avoid harm, no rules of food, clothing, rites, or justice; death leads to hell, no birth in heaven.

“For countless kalpas, sages and saints descend to teach, oxen and horses are ridden, fire, fields, and silkworms are made, food and clothing for rulers and people, maintaining order with distinctions of high and low, noble and humble, able to practice utmost goodness. Those who conform to the dao are born in heaven; those who do not enter hell, endlessly with no escape.

“For these reasons, I now speak in verse:

> Hell is full of sin and suffering,  
> Endless kalpas with no escape.  
> Poison planted by the body,  
> Believe it, do not mock.  
>
> Form perishes, returns to earth,  
> Spirit follows merit’s root.  
> Heaven and earth are but a moment,  
> You have no time for storms.”

“Below lies the primordial life, the measure of spirits and gods. This scripture wings you, heavenly beings rejoice and admire, supporting blessings in the Three Realms, removing your sins. Should anyone slander or fall, hell’s laws show no mercy. Hurry, as the law commands.”

## Chapter Six: The Nine Hells of the Netherworld

The Dao says: “In the Yellow Zeng World, there are nine continents, each surrounded by small seas, flowing into the great Kunlun sea. The place where I now teach is called the Red County Small Continent, the center of the nine continents, modeled on the great continent.

“The people of these nine small continents are clever and deceitful, few are sincere. Many desire to be born in heaven but mostly enter the Nine Hells, stretching tens of thousands of li, all filled with sinners.

“Some are poured into molten copper, some boiled in cauldrons, some burned by fierce fire, some pierced by iron forks, some hammered by iron hammers, some scourged by fiery rods, some dismembered, their heads hung, some forced to carry sand and stones, filling rivers and blocking seas.

“The great gods govern the law; sinners have no pardon. Some serve one kalpa, two kalpas, three, four, up to a hundred kalpas. One such kalpa is a great pit forty li square, where sinners are ordered to labor for a hundred years, casting one mustard seed at a time until the pit is filled; this is called one kalpa.

“Another is a great stone forty li square, where sinners work for a hundred years, brushing it once with a heavenly garment; when the stone is gone, that is one kalpa.

“Sinners lament to each other: ‘A mustard seed is so small, this pit so deep and wide, when will it be full?’ ‘The stone is hard and strong, the heavenly garment light and thin, brushed once every hundred years, when will it vanish?’

“The jailers hear this and angrily say: ‘There are twenty such kalpas; this is not even half the small kalpa.’ Hearing this, sinners’ spirits waver, weeping and choking, dying and reborn, forced into this punishment with no hope of release.

“They regret their past lives’ unfilial and evil deeds, killing and stealing, slandering scriptures and dao, taking others’ lives and wealth, cunning theft, neglecting the divine dao, thus receiving this retribution.

“I see this and think you men and women should not sin; therefore I speak in verse:

> Pits and stones are not fame,  
> Twenty times is not the great kalpa.  
> Endless are the sins,  
> Spirits are not destroyed.  
>
> Suddenly forms arise,  
> Only to be torn again.  
> Boiling cauldrons steam and cook,  
> Knife winds chop and slice.  
>
> Pity the beings below,  
> Why not build merit?  
> Birth in heaven is sure,  
> Especially with immortal dao.”

## Chapter Seven: The Heavenly Venerable’s Address to the Assembly of Sages

The Most High Heavenly Venerable finished speaking this scripture. Then all the sages, elder gentlemen, the Nine Old Immortal Capital Lords, the Nine Qi Gentlemen, and others present all said: “Excellent! We report to the Heavenly Venerable: Such awakening to the dao is worthy of all reverence. May we ask if there are further supreme transformations in the worlds of the many heavens?”

The Heavenly Venerable replied: “Since I began to study the dao for ninety-one kalpas, I have taught and transformed six billion dust worlds, sometimes dividing my spirit into parts, sharing their births and deaths, sometimes transforming into diamond and lapis lazuli light, sometimes appearing as emperors, sages, elders, or children, sometimes as divine omens and benevolent beasts—lions, white deer, qilin, phoenixes—using all manner of expedients, nothing inaccessible.

“But all beings in the world have deep sins and heavy karma; their destined time has not come, so they cannot receive transformation and ultimately return to hell.

“Those who receive transformation attain the supreme dao, never born into the Three Realms. Since you have seen the dao field, you should spread the dao teaching, save all beings, make great vows, universally awaken kings, emperors, and all under the heavens, all ministers and subjects, down to the smallest creeping insects and flying mosquitoes, so all may awaken, not enter the Three Paths, the ten sufferings, the eight hardships, dying to endless bliss, born with dharma bodies of boundless lifespan, in palaces of seven treasures, lacking nothing.

“If you can save thus, you become teachers of heavenly beings. How can you not strive?”

The Heavenly Venerable said: “This scripture is revealed to the world; it must not be hidden. Teach it in accord with the lineage; blessings will flourish. If it is falsely transmitted among the common folk, sins and calamities will follow.”

Then all the sages bowed their heads, unanimously praising and accepting it, faithfully observing and practicing.
