## Scripture of the Most High Profound Numinous Treasure Heavenly Gate

The Great Dao is wondrous in its function. There is the Supreme Ultimate, before qi was seen. The Great Beginning is the origin of qi. The Supreme Origin is the beginning of form. The Great Simplicity is the origin of substance. Moreover, qi, form, and substance exist together, yet have not parted or scattered; this is called the Primordial Chaos, where myriad things remain undistinguished. The light and pure become Heaven; the heavy and turbid become Earth.

Thus, the creation of Heaven and Earth is recorded: The Old Lord is indeed the root and foundation of Heaven and Earth; all things arise from him and are born. Therefore, he stands upon the path without haste, roams the realm without reliance, rides the empty cavern to ascend and descend, harnesses yin and yang to mold and refine, embraces the nameless great simplicity, and thereby skillfully lends aid to bring all into being.

At the dawn of ninety-nine thousand nine hundred ninety-nine myriad myriad myriad qi, he again arranged the Mysterious Primordial Beginning and gave birth to Heaven and Earth. He is called the Nameless Sovereign, who unfolds the Dao of Nature to transform Heaven and Earth. After one great kalpa passes, Heaven and Earth collapse and sink; yet qi gathers again to govern the cycle, reestablishing Heaven and Earth, and is named the Unsurpassed Mysterious Old Lord, who guides all beings.

After the full cycle of the great kalpa, Heaven and Earth again perish; then the two forces of creation arise, and he is called the Most High Old Lord, holding the Immortal Registers to ferry all in the Ten Directions. At the end of one kalpa’s cycle, Heaven and Earth again sink; he entrusts life to the profound mystery, named the Lofty Old Lord, who blends and forms Heaven and Earth anew.

He separates the primordial qi: the clear becomes Heaven, the turbid becomes Earth; the essence of the Great Sun becomes the Sun, the essence of the Great Moon becomes the Moon. Further dividing the essence of Sun and Moon into stars, he sets the Twenty-Eight Constellations, arranges the Twenty-Four Qi, establishes the Eight Solar Terms, the Four Seasons, and the Five Phases. He sets the Five Planets and the Five Sacred Mountains, divides the Five Emperors to govern them; the Sun, Moon, and stars each have their palaces and chambers, presiding over their affairs.

With Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter assisting the Twenty-Four Qi, he further establishes Three Hundred Sixty Famous Mountains and Seventy-Two Blessed Lands to stabilize the geography. When the qi of Heaven and Earth mingle, then humans, beasts, grasses, trees, insects, flying creatures, and creeping things all come to life in abundance.

Then he set up the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, who beget the myriad peoples, each generating and transforming the other. Heaven and Earth are apart by forty-eight thousand li; east, west, south, and north are separated by one hundred ninety thousand li. The Sun and Moon each have a diameter of three thousand li, their circumference nine thousand li.

Mount Kunlun stands as the axis of Heaven and Earth; above it is the Mysterious Sovereign of the Northern Star. One star of the Northern Dipper spans one hundred li, separated by ninety thousand li. Thus arranged, there are Nine Heavens and Nine Earths.

The Nine Heavens are: from below, the first is the Heavenly Realm of Politeness; second, the Heavenly Realm of Jiayi; third, the Brahma Treasure Heaven; fourth, the Transforming Response Heaven; fifth, the Heaven of No Arrogance; sixth, the Tranquil Heaven; seventh, the Heaven of Xu Yan; eighth, the Heaven of Meditation and Goodness; ninth, the Heaven of Yu Dan.

The Nine Earths, from above, are: first, the Earth of Color and Moisture; second, the Earth of Moist Color; third, the Earth of Color and Luster; fourth, the Earth of Moist Luster; fifth, the Earth of Metal and Grain Moisture; sixth, the Earth of Diamond Moisture; seventh, the Earth of Water Moisture; eighth, the Earth of Wind Moisture; ninth, the Earth of Cavern Springs and Framework. These are also called the Nine Bastions.

Yet the heavenly positions are many; here we briefly enumerate thirty-six names, divided into the Three Realms, the Four Heavens, and the domains of the Three Pure Ones.

From below, the first is the Desire Realm with six heavens: the Great Sovereign Heaven, the Great Bright Heaven, the Clear Bright Heaven, the Mysterious Womb Heaven, the Primordial Bright Heaven, and the Seven Luminaries Heaven.

Second, the Form Realm with eighteen heavens: the Voidless Heaven, the Supreme Ultimate Heaven, the Scarlet Bright Heaven, the Respectful Splendor Heaven, the Radiant Bright Heaven, the Bamboo Drop Heaven, the Void Bright Heaven, the Observing Bright Heaven, the Respectful Celebration Heaven, the Supreme Radiance Heaven, the Primordial Carrier Heaven, the Supreme Peace Heaven, the Manifest Settled Heaven, the First Yellow Heaven, the Great Yellow Heaven, the No Thought Heaven, the Upper Grasp Heaven, and the Infinite Heaven.

Third, the Formless Realm with four heavens: the Lofty Crossing Heaven, the Primordial Cavern Heaven, the Wondrous Completion Heaven, and the Forbidden Supreme Heaven.

Altogether, these twenty-eight heavens are called the Three Realms.

Above them are the Four Human Heavens: Constant Fusion Heaven, Jade Prosperity Heaven, Brahma Crossing Heaven, and Merchant’s Heaven. These four heavens are called the Seed People Heavens. Together with the previous, they total thirty-two heavens, all beneath the Three Pure Ones.

Above these are the Three Heavens called the Three Pure Ones: first, the Great Scarlet Heaven, called the Supreme Clear Domain; second, the Yu Yu Heaven, called the Upper Clear Domain; third, the Clear Subtle Heaven, called the Jade Clear Domain.

The highest heaven is called the Unsurpassed Great Luo Supreme Canopy Heaven, said to encompass all heavens, supremely lofty and unsurpassed.

Counting all before, there are thirty-six heavens, each with its own emperor. The earth likewise has thirty-six names, each with its own sovereign. These are the Thirty-Six Heavenly Emperors and Thirty-Six Earthly Sovereigns.

Beyond Heaven and Earth, their form resembles a chicken’s egg, also like a wheel; primordial qi circles them like the halo of the sun, where the yellow essence disperses.

Such are Heaven and Earth, each with five hundred million five thousand five hundred fifty-five layers. Within them are established the heavenly patterns and earthly geography, earth, water, fire, wind, yin and yang — all birth and nurture begin with me.

Thus, the Two Forces receive division and judgment; the Three Luminaries receive brightness; the Four Qi receive harmony; the Five Phases receive mutual generation; rivers and seas receive depth and clarity; mountains and valleys receive emptiness and fullness; Daoists receive spirit and immortality; kings and nobles receive peace and stability; all beings receive growth and flourishing; gods receive numinous power; wandering souls receive liberation; withered bones receive revival.

Truly the highest goodness spreads wide and far, all partake in the blessings of nature.

Therefore, the Most High Old Lord is the father and mother of primordial qi, the root and foundation of Heaven and Earth, the ancestor and chief of yin and yang, the emperor and lord of myriad spirits, the handle and hinge of former kings, the soul and spirit of all things.

He molds the void and nothingness, responds to creation’s cause, girds the eight extremes, carries Earth and suspends Heaven, roams and gallops the Sun and Moon, moves and guides the stars, breathes the six Jia cycles, governs and shapes Heaven and Earth, changes and transforms the Four Seasons, pushes and shifts cold and warmth, commands and directs wind and rain, drums and stirs thunder and clouds, distinguishes blue and yellow, counts the void and fullness, and perfects lord and minister, father and son, with rites and righteousness complete.

Scholars say: Those in the Desire Realm have yin and yang with color and desire, mutually generating and nurturing; those in the Form Realm have form but do not mingle, all are born of transformation; those in the Formless Realm say nature and consciousness are subtle and wondrous, no longer bound by form or imagination.

The Seed People are the next immortals, said to live for billions of years, their bodies able to fly. Though their longevity increases step by step, they have not yet severed birth and death; when their life ends, they descend again, each according to the weight of their karma.

If one can cultivate and advance, one will ascend into the Dao realms of the Three Pure Ones, forever freed from the wheel of reincarnation.

Within are established the Three Primal Palaces, the Three Officials, Nine Courts, and One Hundred and Twenty Departments, arranging examining officials who record each person’s life and death, sins and blessings, without error or omission.

Thus, children of the directions, strive diligently.

You may take refuge in the Heavenly Venerables of the Ten Directions to extend the Dao qi.

The Lower True Sovereign Profound Spirit Heavenly Venerable appears with the form of heavy turbidity, wearing the crown and shoes of Wu and Ji, fulfilling the wishes of East, South, West, and North, ruling the people of Chen, Xu, Chou, and Wei; you may take refuge in him.

Altogether, there are thirty-six heavens, each with its own emperor; thirty-six earths, each with its own sovereign. Each heavenly emperor and earthly sovereign has its own form, crown, and shoes, representing and governing their domains.

All are recorded in the immortal registers of the seventy-two heavenly emperors and earthly sovereigns. All honor the Heavenly Venerables of the Ten Directions, who govern the Three Realms, immortals and mortals, short and long lives, the increase and decrease of fortune and calamity.

If one does not take refuge in the Heavenly Venerables of the Ten Directions, then where else can one turn?

Therefore, the Five Sacred Mountains each display their forms and rites, desiring the people of the world to take refuge.

A hymn says:

The Three Pure Ones descend with numinous power,  
The Eight Extremes return in devotion.  
The Six Palaces are without dust,  
The Ten Heavens shine with radiant conduct.  
At dawn, the true recite this,  
Universally honoring the Heavenly Venerables of the Ten Directions,  
And thus seek longevity.  
You should take refuge in them.
