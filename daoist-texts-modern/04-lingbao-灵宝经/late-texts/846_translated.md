## Supreme Profound Numinous Treasure Admonition on Karma’s Fundamental Practice, Highest Grade Sublime Scripture

The Dao spoke:  
“In ages past, I dwelled within the Jade Terrace amid the Celestial Alchemical Mound of Profound Clarity in Heaven, receiving the primordial One Golden True Dharma Wheel’s admonition on karma’s fundamental practice, the highest grade cause and condition. I bear the title of Most High Supreme Profound Great Dharma King, ever stationed in the Jade Pure Supreme Enclosure, the grand celestial capital where flying immortals open the skies.  

The Dharma Wheel’s original admonition on karma’s merit opens the field of all beings’ birth and death, the source of Heaven and Earth’s sins and blessings, steering the three vehicles, ascending the Supreme Clarity, the tenfold perfected true person, illuminating dark nights, vast and wide across the Ten Directions. It turns the root of the ten evils, guiding all to walk the path of ten virtues, so that all may swiftly be born into the boundless great enclosure of Heaven. Whoever can follow thus shall surely attain the true Dao.”

The Dao spoke:  
“I constantly descend with the turning of the times to the Ten Directions’ flying immortals’ primordial great blessing halls, the Profound Treasure Courts, to open this Dharma Wheel, the gate of ten virtues, causing all ten evils to be transformed by the Dharma. From this turning of the Dharma Wheel, ascending to Heaven, all attain wondrous penetration and broad illumination of the fundamental practice.  

Regarding past karmic causes and conditions, I observe Heaven and Earth—rare indeed are those who can uphold this. Without supreme virtue, how could one receive it?”

The Dao spoke:  
“The utmost admonition on karma’s practice belongs only to those of supreme and far-reaching virtue. The Golden True fundamental practice is the source that endures forever. Goodness must hold right mindfulness; demons dare not speak. Cut off all confusion and disorder. The heavens pay homage to the true; do not follow those born of evil. Such are the roots of sin, destined to enter my Dharma Wheel. When they bring calamity, do not contend with them. They fall into the three evil paths; hoping to return is exceedingly difficult. Those who obstruct the Dao are ignorant; those who envy others harm themselves; those who slander others have just emerged from the animal path. Those who delight in lust and color, their prior roots with the six beasts remain unsevered. The greedy and cruel harm themselves; those greedy for taste swallow poison. These are the origins of cruelty—goodness must keep far from them.”

The Dao spoke:  
“When the Primordial Heaven Venerable spoke this admonition on karma’s fundamental practice, he pointed with his hand into the void of the Ten Directions, commanding the summoning of the Ten Directions’ flying immortal emperors, the utmost true sovereigns, the flying immortals’ boundless divine kings, wondrous conduct perfected true persons, the Most High Jade Emperor, the boundless great sacred honored spirits, the thirty-six heavenly emperors, the supreme true ones of the heavens, the Nine Palaces perfected true persons, the Five Elders’ highest truth, celestial and earthly immortals, boundless world gods and immortal jade maidens, countless great sacred hosts, the Three Realms’ spiritual officials, the Three Primordial upright true law enforcers and their retinues, the hosts without shackles—all at once riding the void and arriving, ascending to the Jade Capital’s heavenly light, fourfold bright purple canopy revolving the heavens, awe-inspiring potency, flowing through the Ten Directions, illuminating the heavens, burning incense and scattering flowers, flying in mysterious steps through the void, circling thrice then returning, kowtowing to the true, together ascending the Golden True Dharma Wheel’s various realms, gazing upward at the Dharma sound, none but joyful, all acclaiming goodness.”

The Dao spoke:  
“The unsurpassed Golden True sincere karma is the universal exaltation of sincere practice’s root. Rare indeed are those who embody it. Heaven’s principle and wondrous purpose, the true ones act thus. Yet the Ten Directions’ heavenly beings give rise to calamities, creating myriad forms, all released by evil. The secret lies in the heart: establish the Dao field, universally turn the Dharma Wheel, illuminate the six paths, liberate Heaven and Earth’s beings, lonely souls and suffering spirits alike, ascending the blessed heavens, rejoicing lifelong, enduring kalpas. From now on, all is due to the Dharma Wheel’s highest grace. At that time, the great saints and hosts of Heaven without shackles all acclaim goodness, circling thrice leftward, hands crossed in salute, humbly receiving the admonition.”

The Heavenly Venerable said to the great celestial hosts:  
“I open the Golden True Dharma Wheel, transforming causes and conditions. Many are hard to obtain, yet form is the greatest difficulty. The body of supreme virtue is also the domain of a nation. Using it to invite calamity, the heart can create. Thus, it penetrates the realm of concealment and containment. Through the gate of good and evil, only the utmost person knows and perceives, attaining the Dao of non-action. If you can follow this, truly receive and never forget.”

The Heavenly Venerable said to the great celestial hosts:  
“The primordial energy is subtle and light; its guidance is not pure. The original karma is easily created; movement leads to death. The five hearts arise, giving birth to ten evils. Long immersed in poisonous blades, can none awaken? They suffer pain themselves. I am the source turning the birth and death of the Ten Directions’ heavenly beings. The ten virtues are fully established. Awakening to the causes and conditions of future births, submitting to the admonition on karma, one attains the true Dao.”

The Heavenly Venerable said to the Dao Lord:  
“I open the Dharma Wheel’s highest grade, Golden True admonition on karma, the ten virtues’ correct root, the gate of myriad practices. If you follow it, all shall humbly listen.”  
Then the Dao Lord clasped hands in salute, humbly receiving the sincere text.

The Sincere Text says:  
“One: Correctly observe the myriad wondrous fundamentals, all attain spiritual power karma.  
Two: Correctly hear the profound wondrous sounds, spiritual knowledge reaches the Ten Directions.  
Three: Correctly know the incense and light entering, spiritual power and numinous breath remain.  
Four: Correctly open wondrous gates with sound, spiritual power benefits with boundless fruits.  
Five: Correctly preserve the Dharma admonition’s practice, spiritual power descends the true Dao.  
Six: Correctly contemplate beings’ suffering, spiritual power shines in retribution.  
Seven: Correctly imagine no dual confusion, spiritual power reaches the true Dao realm.  
Eight: Correctly practice great compassionate karma, spiritual power is unsurpassed truth.  
Nine: Correctly stabilize form and shadow, unmoving in all conduct, spiritual power is wondrous awakening.  
Ten: Correctly possess form and spirit, firm and bright holding the right, spiritual power is profound and wondrous.”

The Heavenly Venerable said:  
“The Golden True highest grade tenfold correct spiritual power admonition on karma is the foremost of myriad practices, holding the ten directions upright, the root of immeasurable subtle penetration. I open the Dharma Wheel, thus expounding its text to liberate kalpa calamities, all birth and death stagnations, causing all to turn from here, ascending to eternal existence, attaining true Dao accomplishment, never seeing the gate of ten evils.”

The Heavenly Venerable said:  
“The Golden True fundamental practice’s ten grades are the merits of supreme goodness.  
One: Sever the five-color greed and profit attachments, right vision without false sight.  
Two: Sever the five sounds and six dusts’ voices, no evil hearing inside or out.  
Three: Sever the six contacts’ causes, evil qi does not enter.  
Four: Sever empty talk and false discourse, evil words and flowery speech do not advance.  
Five: Sever all calamities and harms, all evil does not invade.  
Six: Sever thoughts of the five aggregates, evil does not interfere.  
Seven: Sever wrongful deeds and fabrications, evil calamities do not arise.  
Eight: Sever all confusion and disorder, all evil does not violate things.  
Nine: Sever baseless conduct, evil sickness naturally vanishes.  
Ten: Sever the ten evil karmas, always take the Dharma Wheel in mind, myriad demons and evil spirits retreat, none dare oppose.”

The Heavenly Venerable said to the Dao Lord:  
“This is the unsurpassed Golden True fundamental practice highest grade, clear and true self-refined emptiness and stillness, universally called the highest karma. Those able thus, the Golden True can be expected. I observe the heavenly beings; one in ten thousand, without the utmost person, none can follow.”

The Heavenly Venerable said:  
“The Golden True observation practice’s ten grades, those who always can thus, all virtues fully established.  
One: Seeing five colors without greed, lustful winds do not arise.  
Two: Hearing five sounds without listening, demonic winds self-remove.  
Three: Smelling all fragrant airs without delight, the six orifices unharmed, evil winds retreat.  
Four: Seeing five flavors without greed or sweetness, all dusts do not soil the body.  
Five: Hearing all pleasures without viewing, external dust and evil winds do not disturb.  
Six: Guarding oneness without false thoughts, lifelong unstained, evil qi does not arise.  
Seven: Acting by taking admonition as root, all dusts self-dissolve, form and color bright and pure.  
Eight: Seeing treasures without taking unlawfully, myriad virtues come to fruition, lifelong peace preserved.  
Nine: Harmonizing nature without envy or jealousy, seeing matters without disturbance, myriad blessings descend truly, spirits and demons pay respect.  
Ten: Settling body and idle thoughts, compassionately thinking of all past destinies, the Ten Directions protect the body, highest offerings made, attaining the supreme true.”

The Heavenly Venerable said to the Dao Lord:  
“I open the Golden True highest grade Dharma Wheel admonition on karma’s fundamental practice. If the Ten Directions’ heavenly beings can thus, they join the ten saints in merit, entering the realm of eternal Dharma, naturally attaining the Dao, lifelong brightness, celebrating through countless kalpas, blessings flowing through myriad generations, ever united with the Dharma Wheel without end.”

The Heavenly Venerable said:  
“I open the Dharma Wheel’s ten saintly realms.  
One: Turning through the first grade, able to know the weight of matters in one place, ranked as the aware saint.  
Two: Turning through the second, knowing the world’s existence or absence, auspicious or inauspicious matters, ranked as the awakened saint.  
Three: Turning through the third, able to know sins and blessings, all past and future births, retributions and destinations, ranked as the truly awakened saint.  
Four: Turning through the fourth, able to mind-travel to see beings’ hearts, reverse illuminating the yet-to-be, hidden matters of calamity and blessing, ranked as the fully awakened saint.  
Five: Turning through the fifth, universally knowing the Ten Directions’ boundless worlds’ all causes, conditions, origins, destinations, cessation or continuation, ranked as the greatly awakened saint.  
Six: Turning through the sixth, penetrating profound observation, knowing the Ten Directions’ realms and the saints’ abodes as if the palm of one’s hand, forms and scattered shadows, void without obstruction, ranked as the wondrously awakened saint.  
Seven: Turning through the seventh, universally knowing Heaven and Earth’s movements, mechanisms, numbers, existence and nonexistence, near and far, all without hindrance, ranked as the thoroughly awakened saint.  
Eight: Turning through the eighth, dwelling in standing forgetfulness, form like the midday sun, all observations clear, ranked as the observing awakened saint.  
Nine: Turning through the ninth, universally able to open brightness, releasing the body’s inner treasure light, illuminating the Ten Directions, all universally seen, no above or below not penetrated, ranked as the universally bright great awakened saint.  
Ten: Turning through the tenth, universally observing and inspecting, universally illuminating, no darkness or obscurity, penetrating Heaven and Earth, radiating the Ten Directions, silently enduring eternal, ranked as the profoundly bright great awakened supreme saint.  

All these practices and karmas arise from the turning of the Dharma Wheel. The eighty great saints of penetration possess virtues so lofty and wondrous, none but the Dharma Wheel’s power can turn them. The ten saintly fruit causes have come from countless kalpas of sand grains, bestowing merit and virtue, filling Heaven and Earth, vast and wide across the Ten Directions, thus attaining turning positions, entering the ten saints’ merits, wondrous penetration of the highest grade. Those heavenly beings who can thus, the true Dao is accomplished.”

The Heavenly Venerable immediately commanded the Most High Supreme Profound Great Dharma King:  
“You may recite the unsurpassed Golden True Dharma Wheel admonition on karma’s fundamental practice, wondrous penetration and turning jade chapter.”  
The Most High Supreme Profound Great Dharma King then rose, bowed to the true, circling thrice leftward.

### Unsurpassed Flying Immortal Dharma Wheel Turning Ten Virtues Wondrous Penetration Jade Chapter

“Radiant bright great model grade, opening Dao with boundless merit.  
Turning and liberating ten virtuous practices, Brahma realm flying to Heaven.  
Carefree in the seven treasure palace, gazing upward at the Dharma Wheel King.  
Numinous visage supremely wondrous, constantly descending ten Dharma realms.  
Together riding the Three Treasures’ vehicle, carrying the myriad heavenly beings.  
Suddenly clouds and light burst forth, all forms with golden countenance.  
All arise from this blessing, receiving rank as highest true.  
Resting at the heavenly treasure terrace, celebrating this kalpa’s cycles.  
Three times circling the Dao Lord, kowtowing and saluting the Heavenly Venerable.”

The Heavenly Venerable said to the Dao Lord:  
“This jade chapter is guarded in the flying immortal Dharma Wheel’s right palace. Ten Directions’ jade boys and girls, each ten true, guard and protect the numinous text, constantly following the Dharma Wheel’s highest grade turning ten evil realms, liberating and transforming heavenly beings’ birth and death suffering souls. They all continually turn and transform, always connected with the Dharma Wheel. Those heavenly beings who know this chapter, cultivate fasting, incense offerings, and recite it, the Dharma King descends truly, the Dao soon accomplished.”

The Heavenly Venerable said to the Dao Lord:  
“I open the Dharma Wheel turning ten evil realms, the highest grade blessing, its merit immeasurable. Quiet the mind, cut off thoughts. Hearing music but not listening, floating splendor and beautiful colors—these are the roots of ten evils. Form is impermanent, wealth does not endure, the true Dao is unsurpassed. Therefore, I open the Dharma Wheel. The world has those seeking truth and abandoning worldly causes, preserving and solidifying primordial energy, condensing pure nature. When demons come to oppose, be cautious with the mouth, do not speak, lest evil arise and confusion be born, ultimately entering the Dharma Wheel, obstructing the Dao, suffering in future lives likewise.”

The Heavenly Venerable said:  
“The Dharma Wheel opens to liberate the ten suffering realms.  
One: Enduring the suffering of the Knife Mountain.  
Two: Enduring the suffering of the Sword Tree.  
Three: Entering the boiling cauldron’s suffering.

Nine: The Three Officials’ shackles, chains, forced labor, golden hammer, and iron rod torment suffering.  
Ten: Born into the body shackled and chained, vexation, form, and killing suffering.  

Thus, in the Ten Directions are these ten sufferings, all arising from causes accumulated in prior lives. I observe these sufferings, indescribable torment and ruin. Therefore, I open the Dharma Wheel to universally liberate heavenly beings, the Ten Directions joyous, original pardon granted, the Six Paths brightened, the Dharma bridge road opened, all celebrating together, true Dao descending.”

### Unsurpassed Flying Immortal Dharma Wheel Turning Ten Suffering Grade Jade Chapter

The Heavenly Venerable said to the Dao Lord:  
“I open the Dharma Wheel turning eight difficulties realms, the highest grade merit, boundless Dharma gates. When the human heart is pure, ten virtues descend. When born of greedy karma and evil, the material heart is impure. If one harbors evil, you should correct it. The Three Primordials enforce the law, near within the body, all hidden knots gathered. Reporting upward to the heavens, the examining officials swiftly arrive, sitting to summon illness and injury. Try practicing the original root, goodness should follow it. No hearing of inverted views; thus, knowing no cause, rightly possessing form and spirit, morning and evening with reverent heart, true Dao descends, liberating your blessed heavens.”

Six: Receiving a body lacking six roots difficulty.

These eight difficulties all arise from accumulated causes in prior lives, emerging from the ten sufferings, then born into the eight difficulties. Only those of supreme virtue and utmost person always take the ten virtues as their future model, born into the Ten Directions’ boundless blessing halls. Those ignorant with inverted views always take the ten evils as root, thus birth and death, ten virtues, one birth and one death, kalpa suffering, always arising eight difficulties retribution. I open the Dharma Wheel to liberate these persons.”

Brightly illuminating Ten Directions, covering all heavens.  
Unsurpassed Dharma Wheel, turning and liberating Ten Directions.  
Right path clearly opened, Primordial Emperor’s talisman command.  
Flying immortal utmost true, floating in the void praising goodness.  
Jade Emperor’s attendants, golden youths on left and right.  
Surveying all causes, profound transformation great turning.  
Together before the true Dao.”

The Heavenly Venerable said to the Dao Lord:  
“This jade chapter is guarded in the unsurpassed Golden True Profound Palace. Ten Directions’ golden youths and mysterious maidens, each ten true, guard and protect the numinous text, constantly following the great turning of the Ten Directions’ right path Dharma Wheel, reciting this chapter, voices reaching the Ten Directions, the Nine Heavens’ Primordial Emperor crossing hands in celebration, the unsurpassed Jade Emperor bowing and saluting, then opening the great luminous Dharma gate to liberate all heavens, boundless worlds, myriad beings, all attaining body and entering the ten right path blessing halls, all harmonizing with true Dao. All great saints and utmost true beings who know this chapter, fasting and reciting, all open to liberate beings’ sufferings, also able to preserve kalpas unmoved, firmly stabilizing numinous roots.”

The Heavenly Venerable said to the Dao Lord:  
“I open the Dharma Wheel turning ten transformations realms, highest grade boundless true fundamental karma. None but the Dharma Wheel can turn them. Holding true and guarding Dao, hoping for these multitudes, from the beginning of one kalpa until now, those attaining Dao all enter the Dharma gate, cultivating highest virtue, attaining utmost true rank. I have not seen those who cling to wealth and status yet hope to be born in Heaven. I observe the Ten Directions’ beings, many bindings. Though wealth is precious, ultimately it cannot grant Dao. Gathering treasures surely brings calamity. Joy in poverty and delight in Dao is the true treasure. On the day of Dao’s accomplishment, the Dao Lord descends the omen. Clad in nine light treasure robes, seven-colored flying gauze skirts, wearing the all-heaven treasure crown, feet shod in jade-patterned lion shoes, neck bearing twin blazing heavenly lights, overhead covered by radiant treasure canopy, body ascending the seven treasure chariot, riding golden dragons, transcending the unsurpassed Dao realm, majestic feathered attire, radiant fragrant power, Brahma conduct in the great void, heavenly beings on left and right, holding ten supreme numinous banners, all heavens offering natural music and incense, scattering flowers, filling the Ten Directions, all true ones descending to welcome the omen, Jade Pure heavenly treasure receiving rank, eternal Golden True.  

At that time, truly joyful. These persons all are those who joyfully keep poverty and guard Dao, thus attaining such. The world’s lineage flourishes, not to be coveted. Serving ten evils, wealth scatters. Great wealth ultimately becomes poison’s gate. I open the Dharma Wheel, universally proclaiming to the Ten Directions, flying immortals utmost true, liberating the Ten Directions, boundless worlds, all beings, all attaining accomplishment, fasting merit, tenfold perfected true persons.”

The Heavenly Venerable said:  
“The Dharma Wheel opens ten transformation utmost true realms.  
One: Holding admonitions is earth immortal.  
Two: Cultivating Dharma admonitions, turning position into second grade, becoming wandering immortal.  
Three: Doubling toward right heart, turning position into third grade, becoming immortal.  
Four: Observing admonition practice, turning position into fourth grade, becoming flying immortal.  
Five: Constantly following scriptures and admonitions, not violating conduct, turning position into fifth grade, becoming spirit immortal.  
Six: Severing greed for taste, long fasting, reciting scriptures, holding admonitions, turning position into sixth grade, becoming divine immortal.  
Seven: Able to renounce color and desire, equally practicing all merits, abandoning heart embracing purity, turning position into seventh grade, becoming true immortal.  
Eight: Building heart broadly thinking of Ten Directions, always practicing rescue of distress, speech without fault, aiding beings without partiality, turning position into eighth grade, becoming flying immortal true person.  
Nine: Guarding oneness unmoving, holding myriad good deeds, revering admonitions, always as if facing the gods, turning position into ninth grade, becoming Most High true person.  
Ten: Constantly able to eat clouds and drink qi, austere practice cultivating Dao, reciting scriptures and incense, bowing to true, enlightening Ten Directions, universally aiding boundless beings, benefiting Heaven and Earth, never weary, turning position into tenth grade, becoming unsurpassed Supreme Clarity true person.  

Things themselves have no mind, but if able to practice the eight admonitions, then attaining the Ten Directions’ flying immortals’ equal merit, how much more holding the ten admonitions on karma’s fundamental practice! Yet in the final kalpa’s beings, only able to break admonitions, who can cultivate? The five turbidities of beings, coarse conduct many, utmost persons uphold, taking as lifelong treasure; coarse persons receive it, hoping for worldly high rank, destroying ten virtues’ practice, reckoning to return to ten evils’ path. Yet beings arrogantly claim Dao, not Dao casting off beings. No one with heart seeks and fails.”

“I open the unsurpassed Golden True Dharma Wheel admonition on karma fundamental practice twelve boundless highest grade causes and conditions, turning wondrous penetration utmost true realms. This scripture’s highest karma is all-pervasive, universally the Dharma Wheel, anointing the myriad depths, turning in Ten Directions, opening liberation for boundless myriad beings’ sins and evils, entering various blessing realms.

The Heavenly Venerable said to the Dao Lord:  
“I open the unsurpassed flying immortal Dharma Wheel highest grade realms, modeling the five turbidities’ kalpa.  
One: Ten Directions’ boundless world’s calamities of war and slaughter turbid.  
Two: Kalpa’s short duration, sun and moon’s waxing and waning turbid.

Four: Five-direction ghost soldiers gathering, killing heavenly beings, boundless births and deaths turbid.  
Five: Nation’s governance chaotic, heavenly beings troubled, armor and weapons vexation turbid.  

If you see this five turbid world, you should follow the Dharma Wheel’s grade, opening liberation and turning fate, securing myriad grades, so that Heaven and Earth, sun and moon, stars and constellations all restore their places, peacefully stabilizing myriad nations, all preserved.”

The Heavenly Venerable said to the Dao Lord:  
“I open the unsurpassed flying immortal Dharma Wheel highest grade realms, modeling the three calamities’ kalpa, turning and liberating Ten Directions’ boundless worlds’ myriad beings, all made to escape calamities. Thus, by the three vehicles’ treasure store they are liberated.  
One: Kalpa fire spreading, all Three Realms alike.  
Two: Flood waters raging, eight extremes merging, waves surging to the sky.  
Three: Violent winds filling kalpa, shaking and splitting the sky, Ten Directions submerged, none left.  

This is the great fate’s appointed time, named the three calamities. At such times, you diligently use your mind to turn the Dharma Wheel, opening the three vehicles’ highest grade, to liberate heavenly beings from calamities, all preserved, able to see the Supreme Truth.”

The Heavenly Venerable said to the Dao Lord:  
“Hidden and manifest six dusts, touching and seeing the mysterious root, demonic qi’s form and color, listeners’ emptiness arises, cloud gate morning and evening, evening shadows body and mind, no material thoughts remain, greatest suffering inviting calamity. The numinous youth who knows does not move; that evil harms itself. Unlawful acts proceed, false cunning alike, myriad good deeds abandoned, lifelong unattainable, harming one equals ten, kalpa without birth. Killing by hand or thought, how much more killing human life? The Golden True highest grade admonition on karma, goodness must follow it, myriad acclaim its reason, fundamental practice first.”

The Heavenly Venerable said to the Dao Lord:

The Heavenly Venerable said to the Dao Lord:  
“Heavenly beings cultivating true highest Dao may build according to the law. This Dharma opens liberation for the Ten Directions’ vast birth and death suffering souls, including ancestors’ sins, all obtaining liberation in the ten blessing halls. If seeing Heaven and Earth’s turning and liberation, one should also build this great merit. If seeing sun and moon’s waxing and waning, one should also build this fasting. If stars and constellations err, one should also build this fasting. If heavens and lands are unsettled, one should also build this fasting. If ghost soldiers rise in chaos, myriad deaths, Yin and Yang unbalanced, one should also build this fasting. If master and disciple are in distress, on the day of passing, one should also build this fasting. This Dharma Wheel highest grade fasting karma is boundless great merit; all who attain Dao follow it to attain utmost true realms. The highest sage cultivates this merit, turning position to become Golden True. Heavenly beings build this fasting, true immortals naturally open liberation for myriad beings. Birth and death causes all depend on the Dharma Wheel; its law is lofty and wondrous, unsurpassed treasure. Once every nine kalpas turning, Heaven and Earth profoundly clear, boundless birth and death, all attain blessing and celebration, illuminating Ten Directions, universally attaining eternal existence. Those heavenly beings of supreme virtue and utmost person who know this law, uphold and open the Dharma gate, cultivating and building this merit, true Dao will surely be accomplished.”

The Heavenly Venerable said:  
“The Dharma Wheel highest grade carries the Ten Directions, unsurpassed utmost true wondrous Dao admonition on karma, universally gathering endlessly, profound awareness of all, boundless fundamental practice, myriad models and causes, penetrating Heaven and Earth, universally entering the Dharma gate. Karma evil and evil deeds, sinking form into nine nights, I turn the Dharma Wheel, all made to attain immortality, beings reversing transformation, born human and heavenly. The Dharma Wheel’s turning and Dao transmission, once every ninety thousand kalpas, none but the Most High Jade Emperor’s peers can descend truly.

Its blessing unsurpassed, pure and enduring, when great kalpa descends, universally seeing true Dao, universally liberating beings, all ascending Ten Directions, eternally dwelling in blessed heavens.

Then the Dao Lord rose, crossed hands in salute, receiving the Golden True Dharma Wheel admonition on karma’s fundamental practice highest grade. The matter complete, the Primordial Heaven Venerable commanded the great saints and hosts to ride and depart, the heavens restored to place, kalpa after kalpa enduring.

The Dao spoke:  
“I received the unsurpassed Golden True Dharma Wheel admonition on karma’s fundamental practice, eternal highest grade, boundless causes and conditions. Since the beginning of the Profound Clarity kalpa, opening fate and liberating Ten Directions’ boundless worlds’ countless sand grain beings’ birth and death suffering souls, turning and transforming ten evils, uprooting all sin roots, releasing nets and removing stagnation, all suffering realms, all attain together the Jade Pool to refine form, don treasure robes and radiant light, ten dwellings in blessing halls.

If there is a land of blessing and virtue, first attaining true Dao.”
