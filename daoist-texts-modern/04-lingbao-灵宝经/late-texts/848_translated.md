## Scripture of the Most High Profound Numinous Treasure of the Three Primordial Jade Capitals and Mysterious Metropolis Great Offering

As for the transcendent one’s wondrous root, it issues before the myriad phenomena, the great sage’s profound source, surpassing the six directions and beyond. Neither born nor extinguished, beyond the ranks of sight and hearing, without reliance or contrivance, beyond form and name. Though deep, dark, mysterious, and utterly remote, it can respond and transform without limit; subtle and vast as the void, yet truly benefiting what is present. When manifesting the golden form in the Golden Palace, revealing a million Dharma bodies; completing the jade slips in the Jade Capital, opening the essential scriptures of the five directions—none fail to bridge the myriad beings, awaken the confused masses, respond to their feelings and conditions, stirring the machinery to act and transform.

Now, in this numinous treasure wondrous root, the principle is pure and level. Yet all beings, turning from truth and losing reality, indulge in empty thoughts and false perceptions, wildly entangled in the six emotions, ensnared in the net of attachment. Thus their karma sinks into the five turbidities, the sea of suffering boundless; wandering the Three Realms, birth and death in this vast expanse. Without the guidance of the transcendent one, there is no way out of suffering.

In our Great Sage Heavenly Venerable, wisdom pervades emptiness and being, position surpasses the cosmic pole, the Dao penetrates the Great Net. Opening the gates of myriad marvels, revealing the profound realm, able to compassionately save beings, always skillful in ferrying souls across. Therefore, he took form in the West, appearing in Shanyang, expounding the teaching beneath the mulberry grove. Offering precious jade to adorn, manifesting wondrous omens in clouds and mist, scattering numinous incense in the pure domain. Everywhere opening wondrous signs, smiling and exhaling five-colored light; illuminating the heavens, radiating divine brilliance through the Ten Directions.

He pities those suffering in evil destinies, the dark Three Realms, entangled in the Eight Difficulties. At the request of the Dao Lord, he reveals the cause of evil and retribution, explains the signs before fortune and misfortune, discusses the merit and practice of deliverance and redemption. Thus he expounds this Great Offering of the Mysterious Metropolis Dharma, to teach humans and heavens alike. Universally wishing all Five Paths to remove the root of sin, restoring the Four Lives to preserve their life registers.

This scripture is titled *Scripture of the Most High Profound Numinous Treasure of the Three Primordial Jade Capitals and Mysterious Metropolis Great Offering*. The scripture is the model of response and resonance, compassion and salvation its essence, and vow and conduct its application. Yet the title’s explanation varies in detail—some broadly interpret it as the Two Vehicles, others briefly mention the Three Treasures—these are later conjectures unrelated to the scripture’s original intent.

Now, examining the name and principle, tracing the events, highlighting its essentials to form a single word, we divide the title into two parts. The first six characters form the general title; the last eight clarify its particular subtitle. Within the general title, there are two parts: first, “Most High” (太上), invoking the Heavenly Venerable’s sacred name, indicating the holy speaker; next, “Profound Numinous Treasure” (洞玄灵宝), revealing the deep name of the supreme teaching, clarifying the orthodox Dharma expounded.

First, the invocation of the Heavenly Venerable’s sacred name: “Most” (太) means grand and exalted, indicating the supreme stature; “High” (上) means esteemed and lofty, praising virtue. Together they express the Heavenly Venerable’s unparalleled virtue and boundless essence, thus “Most High.”

Next, clarifying the orthodox Dharma expounded, “Profound” (洞) means penetrating and unifying; “Mysterious” (玄) means deep and remote. This scripture’s wondrous principle is clear and profound, the true path vast and unbounded, penetrating without obstruction, unified without separation—this is the “Profound.” The “Numinous Treasure” (灵宝) signifies wondrous transformations beyond measure, “Treasure” (宝) denotes preciousness and value. This wondrous scripture’s principle is subtle and mysterious, transformations unpredictable, urging practitioners to cherish and uphold it. Thus the *Dao De Jing* says: “I have three treasures, treasure and hold them.” This is its meaning.

Next, explaining the subtitle, again divided into two parts: the first eight characters “Three Primordial Great Offering” (三元至大献) clarify the scripture’s purpose; the last character “Scripture” (经) indicates the general name of the Dharma teaching. The first clarifies the scripture’s intent: the Three Primordials wish to reveal the wondrous method of retribution for good and evil, admonishing and encouraging. Hence the Upper, Middle, and Lower Primordials are described to explain this.

All beings’ birth and death registers, records of good and evil, are all governed by the Three Primordials’ Nine Offices—the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water—who examine merits and faults without error. The Three Primordials are: the fifteenth day of the first lunar month is the Upper Primordial, when the Heavenly Official inspects the records; the fifteenth day of the seventh lunar month is the Middle Primordial, when the Earthly Official inspects; the fifteenth day of the tenth lunar month is the Lower Primordial, when the Water Official inspects. All beings are under the governance of these Three Officials.

The fifteenth day of the first month is the Upper Primordial, when the Heavenly Official inspects. On the first day of the eleventh month, the first Yang is born; on the third day of the first month, the third Yang is born; the three Yangs complete Qian. Qian is Heaven’s function. The Heavenly Dao’s number completes in the first month, so the Heavenly Official presides over the inspection.

The fifteenth day of the seventh month is the Middle Primordial, when the Earthly Official inspects. On the first day of the fifth month, the first Yin is born; on the second day of the sixth month, the second Yin; on the third day of the seventh month, the third Yin; the three Yins complete Kun. Kun is Earth’s function. In the seventh month, Kun qi reigns supreme, so the Earthly Official presides.

The fifteenth day of the tenth month is the Lower Primordial, when the Water Official inspects. The tenth month begins with Hai, belonging to the North; the North is Kan, Kan is the water position, the time when the Water Official reigns, so the Water Official presides.

The Three Primordials are the original source. These Three Officials govern the operation of all things, hence called the Three Primordials.

“Jade Capital” (玉京) is the name of the mountain realm of the Three Pure Ones’ wondrous domain. “Mysterious Metropolis” (玄都) is the palace name in the Great Net Heaven. “Great Offering” (大献) refers to this scripture’s universal inspection of humans and heavens, modeled on the Mysterious Metropolis Great Offering method, redeeming all lost souls, wishing the practice to be widespread, thus called Great Offering.

The Heavenly Venerable, compassionate to all beings, emits divine light. The Dao Lord, pitying the masses, to turn the wheel of Dharma, fully enumerates the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water, the Three Officials’ Nine Offices, one hundred and twenty bureaus, the Four Departments and Five Emperors who examine and record—all officials ascend at the dawn of the Three Primordials to the Mysterious Metropolis, to verify the good and evil of humans and heavens, distinguishing the birth and death registers. All good deeds are recorded; the underworld’s punishments are not redeemable. The scripture fully records the methods of redemption.

Therefore, from the emperor down to common folk, if one encounters this precious scripture, follows its text to practice selection, gathers flowers and fruits, all flavors and fragrances, completes the human world’s rare treasures, arranges feelings and aspirations, creates the Great Offering plate, various adornments, devoutly offering, the saints of the Ten Directions clearly witness, the Three Generations of Heavenly Venerables bestow grace and acceptance—this is the scripture’s intent.

The last character “Scripture” (经) clarifies the Dharma’s general name. Searching the Three Caverns’ true texts, the Seven Divisions of Profound Teaching, examining their titles, the original name is Scripture. Thus, scripture is the general name of Dharma teaching, the great model of the transcendent.

The beauty of scripture is vast indeed, the vessel and ship of all varieties.

Yet scriptures come in many kinds, roughly three:

First, the Five Virtues and Three Primordials, condensed in cloud scripts, trailing rays in eight corners, secret and wondrous writing.

Second, green forest and purple brush, golden slips and jade characters, wrapped in phoenix patterns, hidden in seven-treasure mysterious terraces, sometimes in mountain caves, sometimes above the heavens.

Third, bamboo slips and silk papers, seal and clerical scripts, passed down and circulated, seen in various eras.

Though there are three traces, their subtleties differ; all are expounded by the Great Sage Heavenly Venerable, all able to cure illness, all named good medicine.

The meanings and teachings of scriptures vary in many ways. Highlighting their pivot, they can be briefly explained as four:

First, the cause: the Three Generations of Heavenly Venerables and saints of the Ten Directions all rely on scriptures and precepts to attain the Dao, hence “cause.”

Second, the path: scriptures open and connect all things, guide the Four Lives, serve as the bridge for learners, the essential path of true cultivation, hence “path.”

Third, the method: scriptures convey subtle and wondrous purpose, reaching the essence, able to regulate all beings, model the saints, hence “method.”

Fourth, the permanence: scriptures are not only profound and vast, serene and concentrated, but also the unalterable legacy of the Three Generations of Dharma Kings. With these four meanings, they are rightly called scripture.

Within this one scroll, there are also four parts:

First, from the beginning to the thorough illumination of the heavens, called the Preface Section;

Second, from then the saints descend to the difficulty of redemption, called the Main Discourse Section;

Third, from then the Most High Dao Lord receives the command and recites the conclusion, called the Transmission Section;

Fourth, from then the assembly of saints, called the Conclusion Section.

Within the Preface Section, there are five parts:

First, the gathering of the Heavenly Venerable and disciples;

Second, the clarification of the pure land’s location beneath the Western Jade Kingdom;

Third, from spreading golden offerings on the ground, white jade edging the steps, to the detailed description of the land’s adornments;

Fourth, from yellow clouds entwining four times, purple mists circling thrice, indicating auspicious signs;

Fifth, at this time the Heavenly Venerable smiling, revealing majestic light.

## Scripture of the Most High Profound Numinous Treasure of the Three Primordial Jade Capitals and Mysterious Metropolis Great Offering

The Primordial Heavenly Venerable, together with the Most High Dao Lord, the Ten Directions’ Great Sages, Flying Heavenly Spirit Kings, and seven thousand two hundred and forty youths, all gathered at the Western Jade Kingdom’s Yucha Mountain, the Fulo Peak, in the great mulberry forest.

*Explanation:* This marks the opening and founding of the lineage, complete with the eyes of sages and worthies. This is the first, the gathering of the Heavenly Venerable and disciples, clarifying the pure land’s location. The Primordial Heavenly Venerable is the great name of the utmost sage, the grand title of origination, reaching far beyond the abyss, difficult to express in words. Only by tracing the teaching traces can the title be established. “Primordial” means the very first; “Heavenly Venerable” indicates the sublime and profound. Hence “Primordial Heavenly Venerable.” The Most High Dao Lord is the sage who attained the Dao. The Flying Heavenly Spirit Kings are free in numinous wisdom. The youths have no desires within, no external pursuits, their true nature intact, serene and concentrated. All are at the Western Jade Kingdom’s Yucha Mountain, Fulo Peak. This is the pure land’s location, the wondrous realm of the Jade Capital, the upper realm of the blue void. Also, the land’s people are pure and white, like white jade, suddenly like severe frost, thus named Jade Kingdom. The mountain is named Yucha, the peak called Fulo, the forest with long mulberry trees—thus the title. This passage fully explains the scripture’s place, just as Confucius fixed the classics and Laozi expounded scriptures at Hangu Pass. Since the holy speaker and Dharma place are indicated, the dwelling place is also clarified, with its precious wonders.

---

Golden offerings spread on the ground, white jade edging the steps, seven treasures glittering, brilliance shining like the sun, yellow clouds entwining four times, purple mists circling thrice, fragrant light entwining the heavens, surging through the void.

*Explanation:* This is the Heavenly Venerable’s residence, the third part, describing the land’s adornments and indicating auspicious signs. “Spread” means to lay out. The place where the Dharma is expounded is entirely covered with gold; the edges of the ground steps are lined with white jade. The Seven Treasures are gold, silver, colored glaze, coral, amber, conch, and agate. “Glittering” is another name for jade. The Heavenly Venerable’s abode is full of treasures and marvels, splendid and beautiful, radiating light that shines through the Ten Directions, illuminating the heavens and earth, bright as sun and moon, hence “brilliance shining like the sun.” Yellow clouds entwining four times and purple mists circling thrice symbolize auspiciousness. Yellow is the central color. Also, the proper colors appear as auspicious signs, joyful clouds manifesting omens, all converging at once, coming from all four sides, lush and dense, swirling and surrounding.

---

Moreover, purple qi and light mists swirl three times, numinous winds fan, fragrant airs waft, thick and dense in the void, as offerings.

*Explanation:* Without elaborating further, purple mists are a mix of vermilion and black. Vermilion is Yang, the Dao; black is Yin, virtue. The Heavenly Venerable’s Dao and virtue are like compassionate clouds shading all beings, grace surpassing parents. The upper heavenly realm’s treasures and exquisite adornments naturally bear fruit, differing from the mundane. The music and wondrous abilities are also distinct.

---

Heavenly pitch pipes sound great music, wondrous and elegant tones, myriad kinds interweaving.

*Explanation:* Heavenly pitch pipes are the natural wondrous sounds; great music is extraordinary melodies. Hence “wondrous and elegant tones.” The myriad kinds interweaving means the sounds played arise naturally, thousands of instruments entertaining the Heavenly Venerable. The heavens offer precious marvels and play elegant music; the Heavenly Venerable rejoices, revealing his numinous form.

---

The Heavenly Venerable smiles, five-colored light issues from his mouth, illuminating the heavens.

This is the Heavenly Venerable’s joyful display of numinous form, the fifth part, revealing majestic light. From above to here, all is the Preface Section. The Heavenly Venerable often smiles, like spring scenery, always with light, bestowing grace everywhere, illuminating all. With pure Dao eyes, the saints together in assembly are fit to behold.

---

At that time, the saints all gathered in one place, universally seeing within the worlds and hells of the Ten Directions without limit.

This means the saints, riding on the Heavenly Venerable’s light, see all within hell, without exception. “At that time” means when the Heavenly Venerable expounds the Dharma. “Saints” is a collective term. Though many, all see universally, unaware of the punishments within hell.

---

Prisoners and exiles, hungry ghosts and dead souls, naked without clothes, necks and feet shackled.

This reveals beings’ past karma: not cultivating good roots, committing all evils, dying into hell or hungry ghost paths, naked and starving, heads and necks bound with shackles. Hungry ghosts and dead souls have no clothes, necks locked, feet chained, suffering severe pain.

---

Standing on sword trees, heads crowned with fiery mountains.

These are punishments according to conditions: not just hunger and nakedness, but bearing iron staffs, standing on sword trees, heads wearing fiery mountains, burning and cutting pain unbearable. Sometimes heads are aflame coals, feet on knife mountains, pressed and driven, beaten with iron staffs, limbs shackled, unable to move, suffering through kalpas, enduring these punishments. Such beings, already in such pain, what colors remain to be described?

---

Large and small linked, five bodies rotten, heads and faces scorched, boiling pots cooking, myriad pains cutting the body.

*Explanation:* These appearances arise from past lives shooting birds, killing beings, spreading nets, hawks and dogs chasing, tearing wombs and eggs, cooking in cauldrons, committing many offenses, thus receiving these retributions.

---

Golden hammers beating wildly, no rest in eating or breathing, hungry eating charcoal, thirsty drinking fiery essence.

These are beings with many evil deeds, not one sin alone, stingy in food, heavy hunger, the hungry ghost’s body. Hunger craves food that turns to charcoal; thirst seeks drink that becomes fiery essence. This is due to stinginess and greed, obstructing merit. These are clearly stated in many scriptures, not only now.

---

For kalpas unending, constantly in the hungry ghost path. The assembly of compassion, praising boundless good, at once raising hands and snapping fingers, reverently saluting the Savior from Suffering Heavenly Venerable, wishing in all lives to never be stingy or greedy, obstructing merit, to avoid such retribution. Not only in the hungry ghost path but also in other places, wandering the Three Realms and Five Sufferings.

This means not only one place of retribution but also wandering through the Three Realms and Eight Difficulties everywhere. The Three Realms are hell, animal, and hungry ghost paths. The Five Sufferings are embracing copper pillars, treading knife mountains, circling sword trees, entering boiling pots, swallowing fire and charcoal. Together with the Three Realms’ hells, these are the Eight Difficulties. Yet the saints are compassionate, always pitying. Since the pain is so severe, there should be inquiry, next is the request.

---

The Dao Lord bows and reports to the Heavenly Venerable: Not yet understanding these sinners’ past lives, what sins and causes they committed to suffer such pain. Humbly requesting the Heavenly Venerable to bestow instruction and encouragement, revealing the unheard, so that if enlightened, they may gratefully receive the holy grace.

This means the Dao Lord asks to clarify, so all who have not awakened may know. The Dao Lord, being a sage, already understands karma and retribution, but here asks to teach beings. Having asked the cause, how does the Heavenly Venerable respond?

---

The Heavenly Venerable says: These sinners all arise from past causes: not seeing the bright teaching, not hearing the Dharma sound, boundless stinginess and greed, killing the innocent, false speech, imprisoning the worthy, drinking wine and eating meat, disturbing the Five Spirits.

This is the Heavenly Venerable’s reply to the Dao Lord’s question, revealing the cause. Such words describe beings’ evil karma. Yet the Great Dao Heavenly Venerable compassionately saves, his divine light pervades, shining to the Ten Directions. Thus the Dao Lord, bearing authority, speaks and asks, knowing the cause fully.

These karmic obstacles arise from past faults: not seeing the bright, holy teaching; not hearing the true Dharma’s numinous sound; only engaging in stinginess and greed; not revering merit; cutting off the heavenly path; becoming the cause of hell; sinking in the river of attachment, drifting in birth and death.

The Five Spirits are the five viscera’s spirits: soul, spirit, essence, and will. Drinking wine and eating meat deepens sin, not only disturbing the Five Spirits but also causing the Eight Difficulties of reincarnation, making the six roots and three karmas widely commit offenses, hiding evil and resentment, body and mind unwholesome, indulging in killing, greed without cause, losing the Dao and departing from truth, unaware of repentance. Once entering hell, there is no escape.

---

Cursing, insulting, spellcasting, shouting to deities, deceiving masters, defying the Dao, polluting the Three Lights, usurping lords and killing fathers, invading and oppressing kin.

Such meanings are clear. When cursing, hoping predecessors fail early, calling on spirits and ghosts, doing all manner of things—such words are countless. These are past life foolishness and arrogance, lacking reverence, increasing pride and luxury, sometimes deceiving masters, slandering true saints, polluting sun and moon, slighting stars, disloyal as ministers, unfilial as sons, usurping and killing lords and fathers. Sages condemn this gradual harm, thus “usurp and kill.” The *Book of Changes* says: ministers kill their lords, sons kill their fathers—not overnight, but gradually. “Usurp” means to seize; “kill” means to slay. Sages detest this and change its name.

---

Harboring deceit, not thinking of beings, secretly stealing, making false claims without cause, cutting off merit to enrich oneself, unwilling to give alms, refusing to help the poor. Now suffering this pain as repayment for past resentment.

The meaning is clear: these are deeds among humans. “Deceit” means flattery and cunning. “Giving alms” means using one’s possessions to relieve others’ urgent needs, distributing evenly. Zhuangzi says: “Green wheat grows on the hillside. If not given, how to carry pearls in death?” Life faces attack and robbery; death faces grave digging and coffin probing. But worldly evil karma is numerous; briefly speaking, the main categories include these.

---

The Heavenly Venerable then speaks a verse:

The Heavenly Venerable, following the previous questions and answers, reiterates the meaning in detail, called a verse. A verse is another name for praise. Emphasizing its meaning, thus a verse.

---

“Usurping and killing lords and fathers, killing the innocent. Death suffers golden hammer blows, iron staffs never leave the body.”

This is the verse’s text. In the previous text, usurpation and killing came later; now in the verse, usurpation and killing come first, since lords and fathers are foremost from ancient times. Among three thousand offenses, killing is foremost, so in the verse it is named first. This emphasizes the heavy crime of usurping and killing lords and fathers.

---

“Entering others’ homes in darkness, robbing wealth and goods. Death souls in dark prisons, for kalpas unable to escape.”

This meaning is clear. Hence Zhuangzi’s discourse: “For those evil in the open, humans punish; for those evil in the dark, ghosts punish. Knowing both human and ghost, one can walk alone.” Thus the underworld is not to be deceived, the spirit path hard to cheat; all sins are recorded without omission; good and evil retribution follows like shadow and form. Once fallen into the Three Realms, no escape for kalpas. This emphasizes the heavy crime of theft.

---

“Luxuriating in lust and delicacy, polluting the Three Lights. Death souls suffer imprisonment, future births are foolish and mad.”

This reveals bodily karma and sin. Those who commit evil acts, indulging in lust without measure, craving beauty and delicacy, offending sun, moon, and stars, not respecting the Three Lights, after punishment are born human again but suffer madness and foolishness. This clarifies bodily karma. Next is speech karma.

---

“Fierce and quarrelsome with words, stirring strife among kin. Death suffers molten copper poured, future lives constantly barking.”

This reveals speech karma. Those who speak falsely, spreading rumors, stirring family strife, causing discord, falsely accusing, creating harm, after death enter hell, molten copper poured into mouth. After punishment, reborn as dogs, constantly barking at humans.

---

“Eating beings, drinking wine, disturbing the Five Spirits. Death suffers boiling pot cooking, iron staffs never leave the body.”

This describes those who consume others’ lives, drink wine, eat meat, neglect beings, causing the five viscera’s spirits to become confused and disordered, mouth greedy and full, unaware of karma following them. At death, sink into hell, boiled in cauldrons and furnaces, body burned and cooked, pain intertwined, never leaving the body. This emphasizes the heavy crime of drinking wine and eating meat.

---

“Falsehoods and deceptions, cheating and misleading for selfish gain. Death suffers tongue pulled out, future births unable to speak.”

This reveals the sin of false speech. Publicly practicing deceit, cheating and misleading, cunningly scheming for personal gain. After death, souls sink into hell, suffering tongue pulling; after punishment, reborn mute. This clarifies the sin of false speech, covering the earlier crime of false claims.

---

“Deceiving masters, disbelieving the Dao, shouting to deities. Wandering the Three Realms, future births as beasts.”

This is the sin of deceiving heaven. Deceiving and confusing masters, slandering true saints, slighting the Three Treasures, polluting numinous texts, creating distinctions in the Dao, speaking rudely, cursing, calling on spirits, entangled in evil karma, falling into the Three Realms, reincarnating repeatedly, suffering birth and death toil. After punishment, reborn as beasts, sinking low, losing human path. This clarifies the sin of deceiving teachers and the Dao, shouting to deities.

---

“Slandering and attacking the worthy, flattering and making falsehoods. Death falls to poisonous beasts’ stings; wandering without joy.”

Slandering, defaming, secretly attacking the worthy, flattering with cunning, deceiving others. Receiving bodies of bees and vipers, or worms, snakes, poisonous scorpions, spreading widely, wandering filthy and evil, suffering rebirths without joy. From fierce speech to this, all speech karma retribution is clarified. Next is intention karma.

---

“Reducing and cutting merit offerings, indulging stingy greed. Death souls become hungry ghosts, hungry and thirsty, drinking fiery essence.”

This clarifies intention karma. Those who revere good but reduce their own merit, giving alms and making scriptures and images to preserve life, yet greedy people cut merit offerings. Though temporarily benefiting themselves, their sin follows like shadow and form. After death, they fall into hungry ghost realms, hungry eating fire and charcoal. The sin of greed brings such retribution, kalpas and countless lives, never tasting pure water, hungry eating charcoal, thirsty drinking fiery essence. This clarifies the sin of greed, covering the earlier crime of cutting merit offerings.

---

“Disrespecting elders, not revering Daoists. Future births as lowly beasts.”

This clarifies wrong views of self and others, disrespecting masters, insulting elders, resulting in rebirth as lowly beings. Those who do not revere the Three Treasures in life suffer six-beast bodies in death. Karma follows without fail. Some born in borderlands and lowly places, even if receiving human form, do not hear the Three Treasures’ name or true scriptures and Dharma, rarely encountering holy teaching and numinous texts. Cutting merit offerings to this extent reveals intention karma.

After the Heavenly Venerable finishes the verse, the Dao Lord bows and requests:

---

The Heavenly Venerable having spoken the verse, the Most High Dao Lord steps forward, bows, and reports to the Heavenly Venerable: Today’s joyful assembly is hard to express. The Heavenly Venerable graciously bestows instruction, revealing the roots of sin. Not yet understanding these sinners all have kin and relatives present, who should immediately have no descendants.

The Heavenly Venerable having finished the verse, the Dao Lord, in doubt, prepares to ask: If not taught redemption, beings cannot exit suffering. Hoping for the method of salvation, he respectfully bows and speaks, the Heavenly Venerable compassionately bestowing secret instructions, hearing the command, joy hard to express. The Dao Lord also knows beings’ sons and daughters, descendants unbroken, wishing to teach their heirs, redeem the departed, thus raising questions to invite further meaning.

---

The Heavenly Venerable says: Though there are sons and daughters, past karmic roots, if not cultivating merit and not making causes, how can they escape? Turning and increasing, sinking in the field of sin, countless kalpas of hardship, no way to return. All evils fully committed, hoping for reversal endlessly.

The Heavenly Venerable says: These sinners’ descendants, sons and daughters, kin, having no merit, only hell causes, turning and increasing, thickening and deepening, finally sorrowful souls, suffering and sinking, falling into filth and sin, the heart’s field sowing past evil karma. Also, those accumulating evil, sin can grow like thorny brambles in a barren field; even if five grains and good sprouts fall in, they are buried and lost, unable to grow and bear fruit. Hence called the field of sin. The Heavenly Venerable, seeing the depth of hell sin, raises the difficulty of salvation, inviting further questions.

---

The Dao Lord bows again and asks the Heavenly Venerable: By what causes can beings leave suffering? By what merit can they return to the human realm?

*Explanation:* The Dao Lord pities beings sinking in hell, again asking to establish merit fields, hoping filial sons and obedient grandsons remember the departed’s suffering, compassionate brothers and dutiful younger brothers recall lost kin, reduce family wealth to rescue. He raises this question to exalt merit fields. Below, the Heavenly Venerable explains sins of different types, instructing the Great Offering method of redemption. This is divided into three parts:

First, clarifying different sins, ultimately difficult to save;

Second, describing the primordial inspection, to recognize and revere;

Third, the assembly’s ritual, encouraging imitation.

---

The Heavenly Venerable says: These sinners, having committed many sins, are not of one kind. If wishing to redeem, it is difficult to treat them alike. No one’s power alone can save.

This is the first: clarifying different sins, ultimately difficult to save. The Heavenly Venerable says karma follows roots, sin roots hard to uproot. Yet establishing merit and planting merit fields, not wishing to spread widely or shift, repenting and removing calamity, not by many merits unable to overcome, if relying on one person’s power, cannot save many evildoers. Thus, knowing evildoers are ultimately hard to save, unless many causes and merits are widely built. Without relying on many causes, how can one hastily save? Since merit is needed, what merit is required? Next, the merits are given.

---

One should follow the Mysterious Metropolis Great Offering Dharma, on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, the Middle Primordial’s time, when the Earthly Official inspects and admonishes, selecting beings, distinguishing good and evil. The great saints of the heavens universally go to the palace, simplifying the kalpa numbers, human and ghost registers, hungry ghosts and prisoners all gathered at once.

This is the second part, to recognize and revere. It means the Heavenly Venerable’s Three Primordial assembly day, also explaining the Nine Offices’ inspection, fully clarifying the morning search, entrusting the officials to verify good and evil, so future beings, according to the Three Primordial days, each ascend to imitate the Jade Capital Mysterious Metropolis Great Offering ritual, offering to the Three Generations of Heavenly Venerables, Ten Directions’ saints, Nine Mysterious Ancestors, and all beings of the Dharma realm, all receiving redemption and liberation.

This fifteenth day of the seventh month is the Middle Primordial Earthly Official’s inspection day. The Ten Directions’ saints all assemble. Thus the Heavenly Official, Water Official, and various bureaus, five hundred and fifty-five billion five hundred and fifty-five million five hundred and fifty-five thousand five hundred and fifty-five sages and saints gather, simplifying the kalpa numbers, examining sinners’ severity and rank, intending on this day to set offerings, redeeming departed parents’ souls, unknown by what method.

---

By day and night burning incense and lighting lamps, illuminating the heavens and the nine abysses’ long night and eight gates. Performing the Mysterious Metropolis Great Offering, modeled on Jade Capital Mountain, gathering flowers and fruits, using five colors, all worldly rare and wondrous items, Daoist implements and treasures, brocades and silks, ornaments and clothing, ten perfect banners and canopies, precious umbrellas and adornments, offering vessels, delicacies and drinks, all flavors and fragrances, presented to the saints and Daoists.

*Explanation:* This is the third part, showing the ritual of cultivation and offering, encouraging imitation. The five colors are blue, yellow, red, white, and black. Interweaving five-colored silks to make banners and canopies, adorning offerings. The Heavenly Venerable, seeing hell sinners enduring kalpas, commands filial care for parents, gathering worldly rare and wondrous fruits and treasures, imitating the Mysterious Metropolis Jade Capital, making offering vessels, presenting to the Ten Directions’ saints and Daoists, saving past departed souls from hell’s suffering. May the Nine Mysterious Ancestors, Seven Forebears, and all beings of the Dharma realm, relying on this offering cause, protect the heavenly reward. Wishing to move the Ten Directions’ saints and Daoists to create merit.

---

On that day and night, lecturing and reciting this scripture, the Ten Directions’ great saints chanting the numinous chapters, prisoners and hungry ghosts shall obtain liberation, all together full, escaping suffering, returning to the human realm. Without this, redemption is difficult.

*Explanation:* The Heavenly Venerable broadly expounds all methods, hoping to urge causes. Fearing true believers are few, repeatedly entrusting. At every Great Offering command, the Dharma masters are invited to open the assembly, day and night six times, practicing fasting and lecturing. “Day and night” means the night of the fifteenth day of the seventh month. On this day, fasting and lectures are established, incense and lamps burning, illuminating the heavens and the nine abysses, the eight gates. The nine abysses are the nine hells; the eight gates are the eight difficulties, places where beings suffer. At this Three Primordial simultaneous day, imitating Mysterious Metropolis Jade Capital to perform the Great Offering, completing all worldly rare fruits and flavors, offering to the Three Treasures.

---

Then the Ten Directions and Daoists, moved by these supreme words, chant and recite, ascending through nine hundred million realms, descending through six heavens, hell sinners at once liberated. After my past and future, eastern goodness is not absolute, western evil not deep, the suffering county’s gentleman shall be the Great Qin. After the emperor, thirty-six thousand years, this kalpa ends, heaven and earth will collapse, all will be in ruin.

*Explanation:* The Heavenly Venerable, speaking this scripture, says after my past, there will be those who propagate the teaching in succession, always with sage kings, flourishing the Three Treasures. “Eastern goodness not absolute, western evil not deep” means the east is not purely good without evil, the west not purely evil without good. The suffering county’s gentleman is Laozi’s incarnation, the mysterious jade maiden cutting her left armpit born in Chen county’s suffering county, hence the name. At the jade’s birth, walking nine steps east, west, south, and north, then able to speak, pointing to the plum tree as surname, heaven and earth, only I alone am honored. Nine dragons leap from the earth, spitting water to bathe. The dragon’s place becomes nine wells, still visible today. Also, Laozi incarnated in the Three Realms’ fiery house and sea of suffering, also a suffering county. The Great Qin is another name for western India. Laozi went west to the flowing sands, arriving at Yanbin, teaching the Buddha’s teaching to transform the barbarian customs. Hence the *Book of Later Han* says Laozi expounded the Buddha scripture to transform barbarian customs. The Buddha teaching is pure and good; today’s Buddhist scriptures are those Laozi spoke, but due to monks’ ignorance, false interpretations and errors arose, former sages doubted, later people forged and reversed, misleading each other, the simple teaching thus diluted.

---

Flourishing texts compete, deceit and errors multiply. Simplicity dispersed, purity diluted, evil and falsehoods flourish. In the limitless world, men and women’s nature is stingy and greedy, dying as hungry ghosts, their souls and spirits starving, given food they cannot eat, turning into dust.

*Explanation:* Before correcting errors, practicing deceit, the limitless world is this land’s name, also called Yanfu world. But its beings are spoiled and strange, evil and lustful, confused and chaotic, stingy and greedy, self and other confused, dying as hungry ghosts to repay past faults, food turning to dust, seen but not eaten.

---

Great kalpas of hardship, ruin and sinking. Wandering the Five Paths to repay past grudges. Now thus told, should follow accordingly. Future men and women should strive diligently, diligently urging themselves, not creating causes of sin.

*Explanation:* “Great” means vast. Through vast kalpas, always as hungry ghosts, even if suffering and then reborn in lowly homes, wandering the Five Paths, cannot become sage. The Five Paths are heaven, human, animal, hell, and hungry ghost paths. The Heavenly Venerable further encourages the Dao Lord, saying future men and women should restrain themselves, diligently encourage aspiration, not create causes of sin. Sin causes are karma. What people do, good or evil, gains corresponding retribution like farming and harvesting, each according to kind, spring sowing and autumn reaping, hence “field of sin.”

---

At that time, the Most High Dao Lord received the command, bowed, and recited a verse.

This is called the Dao Section. “At that time” means when the Heavenly Venerable’s teaching ended, entrusted to the previous Dao Lord. The Most High Dao Lord, having heard the Great Offering redemption scripture and the admonitions for this and future lives, earnestly instructs, announces the transmission, bows before the honored, praises its beauty, upholds the wondrous meaning, joy hard to express. Goodness is inconceivable, thus he composes a verse.

---

“Past lives had causes to meet, now able to see the Heavenly Venerable. First telling the present kalpa’s end, then warning the future kalpa’s faults.”

*Explanation:* This is the Dao Lord’s joy, thus composing a verse praising the Heavenly Venerable’s past, present, and future Dao causes, thus personally receiving the supreme Dao, visiting the Heavenly Venerable. Also granted cause and effect to redeem, transmitting and entrusting, quickly turning the Dharma wheel, vowing to diligently practice, never slack. Past and future kalpas all receive Dao’s grace. The “future kalpa faults” are the second cloud. The later Dao Lord admonishes beings’ greed, anger, and ignorance sins, thus this verse. Greedy people love to accumulate, widely seek wealth, only pursuing pride and luxury, not revering merit, lacking compassion, not remembering beings, not planting merit fields in this life, sinking into evil paths after death. Such retribution is certain. All are from past lives not cultivating good deeds, later lives suffering their calamities. These are the deep faults of the future kalpa.

---

“Diligently practice the supreme Dao, do not resent the conditioned world. Greed is a great calamity, anger and ignorance the root of disaster.”

*Explanation:* This verse admonishes greed, anger, and ignorance sins. The Dao Lord wishes to awaken the confused masses, thus composing a hymn on the cause and source of fortune and misfortune. Greed is the body’s burden; anger and ignorance the root of ruin. Thus briefly explaining the cause, urging elimination. The Dao Lord, having opened the Heavenly Venerable’s teaching, expounds this as future admonition: wealth, lust, fame, and gain are the source of disaster; greed, anger, and ignorance are the root of self-destruction. How can this be cultivation? It hinders the human path and loses merit fields. If the three poisons do not arise and the six roots are pure, this is the way of cultivation. Dust contact does not touch; it can be the ferry to relieve suffering. What disaster remains?

---

“Cut off vexation obstacles, the three karmas naturally at ease. Evil spirits cannot disturb, how could one suffer hell’s hardships?”

*Explanation:* Vexations arise from the three karmas; evil spirits disturb, arising from the six roots. But if one embraces the Dao and guards the truth, dust contact cannot contaminate. Like the beginning of a disturbed mind, lust is first. The cause of hell is lust. To cut vexations, one must be pure and at ease, seeking the cause of lasting joy, meaning the six roots untainted. If one cultivates the Heavenly Venerable’s teaching, always offering on the Mysterious Metropolis Great Offering days to the Ten Directions’ Heavenly Venerables, then roaming freely before the Golden Palace, forever free from hell’s afflictions.

---

“Roaming the jade and gem gardens, striding the seven-treasure park. Carefree and without desire, bowing and worshipping the Heavenly Venerable.”

*Explanation:* The Dao Lord says if later people on the Three Primordial days cultivate fasting and lectures, following the Mysterious Metropolis offering method, offering to the Ten Directions’ great saints and Daoists, with merit and achievement, they become the Heavenly Venerable, roaming the upper realm Western Jade Kingdom, naturally treasures without end, past departed souls all freed from suffering, not falling into the Three Realms. Next, describing the saints’ joyful circling.

---

At that time, the Ten Directions’ saints, hearing the Heavenly Venerable’s wondrous Dharma and cause of redemption, hearing the unheard, awakening the unawakened, then together praising goodness, joyfully practicing.

Reciting and chanting, stepping in the void, circling and revolving, bowing and thanking, praising the Heavenly Venerable. The Most High Dao Lord and the Ten Directions’ saints, having recited the verse, what further instructions does the Heavenly Venerable give?

---

The Most High Dao Lord and the Ten Directions’ Great Sages, having recited the verse, the Heavenly Venerable says: On the Three Primordial fasting days, all must lecture and recite this scripture, diligently cultivate and worship, practice the Dao six times, incense and water to cleanse oneself, abstain from strong flavors, inner and outer calm and peaceful, simple and non-action, not engaging in worldly affairs. First, bestow the Ten Precepts, quiet the mind and close the thoughts, think of the spirit and contemplate the true, imagine abiding in the Dharma.

At that time, the saints all bowed at once, requesting the precepts.

*Explanation:* The Heavenly Venerable compassionately bestows instruction and encouragement, again spreading precepts and the ritual of cultivation. Since sages always cultivate pure conduct, serene and desireless, not touching defilement, hoping to teach and save the ignorant, thus on this day inviting and urging, further explaining the precepts, to send protection, purify fasting and cleanse oneself, contemplate spirit and true thought, day and night uphold, remember the Three Treasures, in the future attain the Dao, see the Heavenly Venerable, roam the Jade Capital, carefree before the Golden Palace. This is the Three Primordials’ day to establish lectures and fasting, redeem departed souls, gain such blessings. The Heavenly Venerable having bestowed the precepts, the text is as follows:

---

The Heavenly Venerable says:

First precept: Do not kill living beings, nor offer lustful sacrifices to the six heavens’ gods and ghosts.

Second precept: Do not steal or commit wrongdoing, nor take others’ wealth.

Third precept: Do not love music and beauty, nor be jealous or unlawful.

Fourth precept: Do not speak falsehoods or flowery words, avoiding speech transgressions.

Fifth precept: Do not indulge in wine and drunkenness, acting without measure.

Sixth precept: Do not slander or arrogantly oppose, nor deceive ancestors.

Seventh precept: Do not deceive masters or reject the Dao, nor discard sacred texts.

Eighth precept: Do not harbor anger toward the four classes, nor slander Daoists.

Ninth precept: Do not greedily seek excess, harming others to benefit oneself.

Tenth precept: Do not insult or curse kin, nor disrespect elders.

These ten precepts are great bodily afflictions; those who violate them face wind blades and kalpas, always encountering evil causes. Good hearts and faith open and guide later generations; diligently practice and listen, never forgetting these words. Practiced according to the Dharma, in life no transgressions, in death no restraint or imprisonment, heavenly clouds descend, naturally attaining the Dao.

*Explanation:* These are the ten precepts and the ritual of cultivation. Upholding them gains human and heavenly merit; violating them sinks one into hell. If good men and women can uphold these ten precepts, vigorously diligent, hearts not weary, actions aligned with the Dao, then no faults arise in life, and after death ascend to the Upper Clarity, riding cloud chariots, traveling without hindrance, surpassing the Three Realms with diamond-like bodies. Those who violate them fall into the five sufferings, traverse the Three Realms, sword trees and knife mountains, driven by ox-headed jailers, urged on, flesh scattered like stars, bones dissolved like rain, suffering kalpas without respite, always encountering evil causes, hatred facing hatred. Violating scripture and precepts brings hell’s calamity; practicing according to Dharma brings heaven’s joy.

From here on, the Dao Lord again earnestly asks about the Three Primordial fasting methods; the following text records the invitation.

---

The Most High Dao Lord bows and says: The Three Primordial fasting method, the Middle Primordial’s meaning, has been fully heard. Not yet understanding the Upper and Lower Primordials, by what ritual and method?

*Explanation:* The Three Primordial fasting methods are all in many scriptures. The Dao Lord fears future generations’ ignorance and misunderstanding, again raising advanced questions, hoping to reveal the unheard, thus diligently requesting here. The Heavenly Venerable replies:

---

The Heavenly Venerable says: These Three Primordial fasts are the three registers’ fixed lists, the Numinous Treasure’s essential texts. The fifteenth day of the first month is the Upper Primordial, the Heavenly Official’s inspection. The fifteenth day of the tenth month is the Lower Primordial, the Water Official’s inspection. Their governance differs.

*Explanation:* This is the Heavenly Venerable’s explanation of the Three Primordials’ delegation. The Three Primordial methods are the three registers’ fixed lists, from the Numinous Treasure’s essential texts. Their governance differs: the Upper Primordial’s left office governs birth and life, the solar fire official inspects; the Lower Primordial’s right office governs death, the lunar water official inspects. The Middle Primordial governs birth and death registers, all hell prisoners’ sins and merits, the wind blade’s inspection. Each oversees ninety thousand multitudes, spanning twelve months. The Middle and Lower Primordials’ three offices overlap. Yet incense spiraling differs: each for the Upper Primordial’s knowledge of life, the Lower Primordial’s knowledge of death. Since their governance differs, it is said their governance differs.

---

Now what is explained, the fifteenth day of the seventh month’s Mysterious Metropolis Great Offering is the general overseer of the Upper and Lower Primordials, so it is told and should be followed.

*Explanation:* This means the Middle Primordial encompasses the Upper and Lower, all harmonized and appropriate. Hungry ghosts and prisoners are all present today. But today the Middle Primordial Dao governs the Upper and Lower, its merit most weighty. Thus the Mysterious Metropolis offering redeems departed souls, so only the Middle Primordial Earthly Official is named. The Earthly Official’s place is central, “middle” is the proper color, so the Middle Primordial is named to encompass Upper and Lower. Also, all things mature in autumn, so the golden time is taken as ripe. Thus the fifteenth day of the seventh month is the Middle Primordial’s time for offerings. All hungry ghosts and sinful souls are freed today.

---

The Middle Primordial’s day of teaching and admonition, the Mysterious Metropolis Great Offering morning, must always establish merit, cultivate fasting, practice the Dao, lecture on scriptures, offer to the Three Treasures, redeem departed souls. At this time, hell prisoners all receive blessing and protection. Those who follow enjoy fortune; those who neglect suffer calamity.

*Explanation:* The Heavenly Venerable, receiving the Great Offering, enjoys boundless blessings. Those who lightly neglect the Great Offering’s weight suffer calamity for kalpas.

---

The Most High Dao Lord, Ten Directions’ Great Sages, Flying Heavenly Spirit Kings, and seven thousand two hundred and forty youths, hearing this teaching, joyfully bowed and departed.

*Explanation:* The highest sages, compassionate, always seek salvation. When proclaiming wondrous Dharma, illuminating the profound wind, hoping for supreme words, how could they not rejoice? Thus sincerely and eagerly bowed and departed, each going to their places, diligently teaching and transforming.
