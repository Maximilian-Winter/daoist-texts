## Scripture of the Cavern Profound, Numinous Treasure, Nine True Persons, Five Returns, and Three Returns: The Path of the Daoist Sanctuary Gate

This scripture speaks of cultivating the five observatory gates of method. One scroll. Source text: *Zhengtong Daozang*, Tai Xuan section.

The Dao says:  
Good men and women who cultivate the correct dao must first be without desire and self-observe, wondrously perceiving the true heart, clear and illuminating. When thoughts arise, see them within the heart; they do not arise to illuminate the heart. Know how to grasp the method of the heart. Only by understanding the heart and its method, do not arise to understand the heart and its method; only let the heart be still, do not arise to still the heart and stillness; only stillness is not stillness, do not regard stillness as non-stillness or as stillness. Again it says: Wood without fire, earth without fire—these two are not the same; wood without fire, wood without person—these two are not the same; heart without knowing, wood without knowing—these two are not the same; heart without knowing, heart without wood—these two are not the same. Within sameness there is confusion, so taking the true is error; cutting off outside sameness, so taking the true is nothing. Therefore, within the great chaos, there is infinite nature, infinite nature depends on the correct nature, which responds and brings forth forms. Like wood giving rise to fire, like heart awakening knowing, transforming and manifesting the world, impermanently arising and perishing. The true dao and correct nature truly have no birth or death. If one can purify the heart and unite with the dao, then one returns to the root, restoring life’s true constancy. At that moment, from the mystery, a verse is composed:

> Knowing arises from conditions,  
> Fire springs forth from causes.  
> Each is the true seed nature,  
> Riding the current, losing the dao’s source.  
> Arising heart desires cease knowing,  
> Heart’s arising knowing is more vexing.  
> Fully knowing nature’s emptiness,  
> Knowing is the gate to myriad wonders.

The Dao says:  
Raw simplicity scatters into vessels, riding the current to recognize conditions. Within the recognition of conditions, there are four delusive knowings: one, inner heart knowing; two, outer condition knowing; three, mutual knowing between them; four, abandoning knowing altogether. Yet these delusive knowings are but names; apart from these four delusions, there is no other truth. Why so? Knowing is not two, hence inner and outer are delusion; knowing is not one, hence the middle is delusion; knowing is not none, hence cutting off is delusion; knowing is not existence, hence permanence is delusion. Therefore, recognizing conditions is like dew or bubbles. It is also said: The common person creates marvels as illusions; the sage’s divine powers are transformations; influences and dreams are emptiness; taking sameness as truth is error. Only the power of wisdom clearly illuminates the true. Understanding the heart is the dao; true and delusion are not two; not abandoning inner or outer, true and delusion are not one. Following conditions, awareness arises; following awareness, conditions appear. Awareness and conditions have no fixed existence or nonexistence; no before or after; no permanence or interruption; utterly clear and tranquil; good stillness and non-action; natural and spontaneous; ascending to the fruit of Great Unity—this is returning to the dao, restoring root and true constancy. At that moment, from the void, a verse is composed:

> Raw simplicity becomes all vessels,  
> Wheel images arise from formlessness.  
> Holding the middle without doubt or faith,  
> Riding the current, turning death and life.  
> Awareness and conditions mutually arise,  
> Inner and outer delusions complete.  
> Fully clear true and delusion as one,  
> Returning heart and dao in darkness.

The Dao says:  
From blue to yellow are waves; abandoning blue and other colors entering the eye is returning the body; from eye to ear is the wheel of recognition; abandoning eye and other roots returning the spirit; from thought to thought is birth and death; abandoning thought and its numbers returning to stillness is returning life. Returning life unites with the dao, and the dao also unites with it. Inner and outer are equally true, free and unhindered. The nature of unhindered pervades the dharma realm, pervades the dao eye, illuminating all forms and appearances. Blue and other appearances manifest in the dao eye. Eye and appearance are neither identical nor separate; equal in operation and true essence, neither breaking nor permanent. Thus, within the dharma, a verse is composed:

> Heart pure, true root manifests,  
> Root pure, wondrous conditions shine.  
> Conditions wondrous, now penetrating heart,  
> Heart clear, returning life constant.  
> Dao heart originally not two,  
> Same current in five destinies.  
> Apart from things, apart from birth and death,  
> Neither human nor dao field.

The Dao says:  
From Yi to Qin is flux and flow; from human to ghost is swift movement; from vulgar to immortal is turning away from death; from mundane to sage is returning to constancy. Returning to constancy restores life; restoring life attests to the dao. The dao nature is clear and pure, universally pervading and perfectly bright. Thus it can hold and illuminate the appearances of Yi and others. Appearance and nature depend on each other; depending, there is thought; thought does not abide; co-arising and co-perishing. This nature of birth and death neither arises nor perishes; neither arises nor perishes, thus neither false nor true. Therefore, all dao realms enter the great dao nature, transcending all activity, apart from all conditioned appearances. At that moment, from nature a verse is composed:

> Yi, Qin, and various realms,  
> Awareness and feeling share the same kin.  
> Humans and ghosts differ on the dao,  
> Being and non-being do not interfere.  
> Turning away from death, walking the dao,  
> Restoring life, returning true constancy.  
> Clear heart, dao eye pure,  
> Myriad wonders manifest their forms.

The Dao says:  
The true persons practice four kinds of methods. If Heaven and human men and women can cultivate without weariness, they will ascend into non-action and unite with the dao truly.

The Dao says:  
Dao and virtue are truly wondrous, their essence primordial and limitless. They penetrate yin and yang, condense numinousness of Heaven and Earth, flow essence and scatter simplicity, shape and form all beings. Forms and relations are affected, not bound by earthly karma. Karma’s nature responds, opening myriad branches. Recognizing Earth’s dark origin, no more increase or decrease, only birth and death remain, thus staining the cause. Nine prisons and five truths ride the path and receive. What are the nine prisons?

One: Violating the great dao, contracting the dark abyss, naturally fading, true constancy hidden. Measuring ghosts come to add karmic bodies, subdued and punished in the Pure Truth Prison, ruled by the Jade Emperor, silence and others holding the crime.

Two: Violating dark virtue, causing transformation of origin, clear receiving turbid, ultimate nature waves. Foolish ghosts come to add seed awareness, changed and punished in the Three Bonds Prison, ruled by the Heavenly Emperor, agitation and others holding the crime.

Three: Violating original nature, arising polluted passions, mysterious essence lost, true grace vanished. Deformed ghosts come to add conditioned bodies, extinguished and punished in the Final End Prison, ruled by the Earth Emperor, delusion and others holding the crime.

Four: Violating principle nature, heading to chaos and vexation, intention nature confused, awareness origin damaged. Deceitful ghosts come to add directional bodies, destroyed and punished in the Five Relations Prison, ruled by the Human Emperor, suffering and others holding the crime.

Five: Violating faith, acting deceitfully, mouth embracing spleen labor. Azure Heaven ghosts add will to waste the body, lost and punished in the Universal Plunder Prison, ruled by the Yellow Emperor, rod and others holding the crime.

Six: Violating benevolence, acting with killing, eyes darkened, liver broken. White Heaven ghosts add soul to scatter the body, lost and punished in the Wind and Thunder Prison, ruled by the Blue Emperor, knife and others holding the crime.

Seven: Violating righteousness, acting with calamity, nose blocked, lungs withered. Red Heaven ghosts add spirit to leave the body, lost and punished in the Vajra Prison, ruled by the White Emperor, burning and others holding the crime.

Eight: Violating propriety, acting with licentiousness, tongue dry, heart startled. Mysterious Heaven ghosts add spirit to depart the body, lost and punished in the Fire Shade Prison, ruled by the Red Emperor, ice and others holding the crime.

Nine: Violating wisdom, acting foolishly, ears deafened, kidneys exhausted. Town Heaven ghosts add essence to wither the body, lost and punished in the Dark Cold Prison, ruled by the Black Emperor, pressure and others holding the crime.

Yet the sins suffered in these prisons, the heavy counted in kalpas, the light in years, according to karmic power, going through cycles of the square directions, until revolving again. If one desires to leave, one must cultivate the Five Victories. What are the Five Victories?

One: First, examine the five knowings, clarify the ten conduct, the gates of false and true.

Two: Next, observe heart and wisdom, understand impermanence, the gates of birth, death, and transformation.

Three: Advance in cultivating faith and wisdom, purify the field of karma, return life to stillness gate.

Four: Wondrously reach the seed of mystery, mix the dark root, penetrate the true bright gate.

Five: Dye and accord, illuminate the dao, ascend to clarity, truly penetrate the attestation gate.

These are the five truths cultivated in practice; body and heart profoundly wondrous, fully complete and perfect, departing impermanence, attaining the true constant dao. The true constant dao is universally infinite, neither existence nor nonexistence, neither permanent nor interrupted. This is the true dao and correct nature, natural and spontaneous. At that moment, from the dharma a verse is composed:

> True constancy holds the six paths,  
> Piercing conditions, arising and violating relations.  
> Brightly relying on the silent wilderness,  
> Darkly dividing myriad phenomena.  
> Feeling karma, receiving form and transformation,  
> Form feeling brings forth heart and spirit.  
> Spirit and form mutually depend and cease,  
> Movement becomes cause of coming karma.  
> Nine offenses bring prisons,  
> Five victories ascend their truth.  
> Dao wondrously penetrates heart’s sea,  
> Heart wondrous, dao natural.  
> For non-being is not absolute nature,  
> For being is not two sides.  
> In things, neither birth nor death,  
> Apart from things, impermanence abides.

The Dao says:  
Good men and women, if able to cultivate the Five Victories and ascend the true gate, then they will leave the nine prisons, ascend the supreme position, fully possess the dharma realm, and attest to the dao’s true constancy. At that time, the assembly of immortals hearing this meaning, hearts filled with joy, praised with verses:

> Ten directions, boundless realm,  
> One dao, one multitude of beings.  
> Six destinies linked in the sea of samsara,  
> One constancy, one ruin and completion.  
> True and delusion not two in reality,  
> Sin and blessing not empty names.  
> Only should one attest to the dao’s essence,  
> The Three Realms are the Three Pure Ones.

## Verses of the Nine True Persons on Practicing the Dao and Attesting

The Dao says:  
Good men and women, desiring to utterly leave all suffering and ascend into non-action, should cultivate the Nine Truths and advance on the path of the dao. The dao practitioner holds precepts and stops thought, purifies the heart and guards unity, externally cuts off all views, internally removes all filth, departs the three existences, attests to that non-action, naturally and spontaneously, attaining the supreme position. At that moment, the true persons hearing this meaning, hearts born of liberation, immediately proceed to the dao field, each benefiting according to shallow or deep, each praising their strength and reciting verses:

**First True Person’s Verse:**  
Understanding and departing all views truly,  
Heart calm, external filth removed.  
Six evils, empty delusions exhausted,  
Right unity naturally dwells.  
Attaining attestation of no-self,  
Utmost solitude yet not lonely.  
Ascending and roaming myriad wondrous gates,  
Forever penetrating emptiness, no void.

**Second True Person’s Verse:**  
The perfected person attests to dharma emptiness,  
Nature pure, within no filth.  
Heart desires already removed,  
No stain, no possessions.  
Therefore, attaining liberation,  
Not subject to any suffering.  
Arriving at that non-action field,  
Always noble and feeding the mother.

**Third True Person’s Verse:**  
No place, no beginning or end,  
Neither perishing nor relying.  
No thought, no color or love,  
Darkly united, rare and subtle.  
Attaining equal true one roaming,  
Transformations none can push.  
Profoundly clear, profoundly formless,  
Ascending mystery, returning without return.

**Fourth True Person’s Verse:**  
No emptiness, no non-color,  
No awareness, no seeing habit.  
No heart, no no-thought,  
No nature, no conditioned gathering.  
Spirit and form do not follow each other,  
Mutually depend but do not enter.  
Forever cutting off birth and death flow,  
Myriad sufferings none can reach.

**Fifth True Person’s Verse:**  
Heart’s essence has no fixed place,  
True nature exists in emptiness.  
Desires and habits utterly extinguished,  
Spirit penetrates into the in-between.  
Not abiding in all emptiness,  
Not abandoning the Great Clarity gate.  
Naturally communicating wondrous seed,  
Roaming and dwelling in true pure heaven.

**Sixth True Person’s Verse:**  
Correct nature neither takes nor rejects,  
Color and habit naturally vanish.  
Not exhausted in activity,  
Not dwelling in the dao field.  
Always in boundless realm,  
Following things yet not knowing.  
Unhindered, without distinctions,  
Profoundly unified, reaching dao’s principle.

**Seventh True Person’s Verse:**  
Illuminating wisdom enters arising conditions,  
Spirit bright in the vast void’s center.  
No color, habits extinguished,  
Old knots utterly dissolved.  
Thus in the sea of birth and death,  
Freely roaming liberation palace.  
No arising in the Great Stillness,  
Turning wisdom vast and infinite.

**Eighth True Person’s Verse:**  
Heart and dao not two principles,  
No boundary nor place.  
In use yet always still,  
No birth, no master.  
True and delusion share one source,  
Responding and changing with impermanence.  
Hundred dharmas spontaneously open,  
Three mysteries fully revealed.

**Ninth True Person’s Verse:**  
Empty wisdom, free power,  
Feeling and attesting to dharma body.  
Two truths are always still,  
Three generations illuminate the perfect treasure.  
Now and ancient have no before or after,  
Master and subject neither human.  
Seven transformations have no constant form,  
Six penetrations are not different gods.

At that time, each true person having recited their verses, all respectfully remained in their places, hearts filled with joy, fully arrayed in dignity, turning to the Dao Lord, performing rites, and then departing.
