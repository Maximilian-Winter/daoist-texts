## The Most High Profound Cavern Numinous Treasure Pure Offering Sublime Scripture

At that time, the Most Supreme Left Immortal Lord, upon the loftiest peak of Mount Ruoye, the highest cloud-crowned summit, entered profound contemplation and serene repose. He forever ceased the six dusts, emptied inwardly to the primal void, his body and mind unmoving, neither chasing nor clinging. Within seven days, he attained tranquil stillness.

On the next day, at noon, suddenly he heard from above the chaotic ringing of bells and drums, and amid floating clouds arose heavenly music of great majesty. In an instant, fragrant flowers rained from the sky—great blossoms and small alike. Each flower bore a hundred petals, broad and round like wheels of a chariot, varying in size, their hues ever shifting. Some were blue, some yellow, some vermilion, some purple, some formed of the seven treasures, manifesting myriad wondrous transformations, marvelously rare and extraordinary. These celestial flowers were not for ordinary display.

Moreover, there came various fragrances—powdered incense, pearl incense, hundred-harmony incense, seven-treasure incense, and others. Such perfumes soared to the heavens, their essence fragrant and pervasive, filling the mountains and forests.

At that moment, within the clouds appeared five-colored flying clouds, eight splendid palanquins, and thirty thousand divine immortals and their retinues. These immortals were all of keen wisdom, clear understanding, eloquent speech, perfected in the six supernatural powers, beyond comprehension.

Within the three palanquins were true beings, their necks bearing round halos of five colors, shining and dazzling through the void. Their heads crowned with jeweled diadems, their garments woven from cloud brocade, adorned with golden engravings, pearls shining like the bright moon, used as tassels and cords. They possessed the thirty-two marks and eighty auspicious features, radiantly pure and luminous, each seated upon their palanquin at the forefront.

The first precious palanquin’s true being introduced himself: “My name is I, Yuluoqiao.”  
The second jade palanquin’s true being said: “My name is I, Guang Miaoyin.”  
The third green palanquin’s true being declared: “My name is I, Zhen Dingguang.”

The three true beings spoke in unison: “Excellent, excellent! Good man, throughout countless boundless kalpas you have established great diligence, always practicing forbearance, wielding a heart of compassion. Today, without attachment to other matters, your body and mind remain unmoved, attaining a selfless heart. Having no self-heart, you also have no other heart; having no other heart, you have no separate heart; having no separate heart, you attain an equal heart.

Good man, upon this mountain you have attained the no-this-heart, accomplishing the fruit of the dao, beyond all reckoning. We now, by command of the Heavenly Venerable, having heard your merit filling the world and responding to the heavens, have come here with our retinues to witness your practice and fulfill your dao. So that future lives may gain understanding; so that future lives may enter the dharma city; so that future lives may attain the formless dharma. For these causes, we have descended.”

At this time, the Immortal Lord rose from his seat, bowed his head to the ground, and after the true being Yuluoqiao finished speaking, he remained silent for a long while before rising and respectfully saying: “How is it, Great True One, that your radiant presence is thus? And that fragrant flowers rain down in such varied transformations, auspicious signs so marvelous? I do not understand today’s cause or meaning, nor the gracious favor extended to such a degree. I earnestly wish the Great True One would reveal to me, so I may comprehend and resolve the cause and effect. Let this ignorant blind one awaken and fully realize all conditions, surely accomplishing the unsurpassed fruit of the dao.”

Then the first true being Yuluoqiao said: “Excellent, excellent, good man. What was your past wish and what thoughts did you hold?”  
The Immortal Lord replied: “I have kept it sealed in my mouth, not daring to speak freely.”  
The Great True One said: “I have come now to fulfill your wish, to enable in the future the flourishing of the great dharma bridge, to fashion a great boat oar, to open great causes and spread great merit. For this reason I have descended.”  

The Immortal Lord again rose to bow and earnestly said: “Great True Master, enlighten my ignorance. I desire to ask but have not dared to consult. I only wish the Great True One would accept my humble words.”  
The True Being said: “Great goodness, great goodness, ask as you will.”  

The Immortal Lord said: “On the seventh day of the seventh month, in a single thought, I perceived the ten directions—the hells, the wandering souls, the hungry ghosts—swallowing fire and eating coal, treading knife mountains, their heads and hands in strange places. Some bodies plunged into boiling cauldrons, their five limbs rotting away, no longer resembling ghosts. The sufferings and pains were inconceivable. The suffering in the dharma realm cannot be added to, yet in that single thought I saw such suffering that my body’s every joint and pore bled as if torn apart. This was my former thought, now fully manifest. I do not understand, Great True One, what merit can rescue such wandering souls from all vexations, filling them with fullness and granting liberation?”

At these words, the true being snapped his fingers joyfully and said: “Excellent, excellent, good man! To speak thus is truly beyond comprehension. Now I will tell you—listen carefully, for I shall explain this to you.”

The Great True One then said: “Only on the three primordial auspicious days and the five seasonal festivals—altogether called the Eight Days—can one invite Daoist priests to the Profound Altar and Pure Abode, to stay overnight practicing the dao, offering incense and oil, preparing sweet fruits piled like mountains, large or small, sometimes in baskets, adorned in various ways, to present to the Heavenly Venerable. Through this compassion, blessings extend to the ten directions, boundless and infinite, liberating the prisoners of hell and the hungry ghosts.

If one commits grave sins—blaspheming the great dao, destroying scriptures, violating pure precepts, or harming Daoist priests—these are called great crimes. If one kills father or mother, attacks one’s master or teacher, or conspires against the sovereign, these too are great crimes. Yet even those who commit such sins may temporarily respond to these offerings and attain liberation. Those with lighter offenses, by means of these offerings and overnight dao practice, gain eternal liberation and fullness.

Good man, the merit of such grand establishment is great. In future lives, compassionate Daoist priests and filial sons will all offer sustenance to their ancestors—whether deceased fathers, mothers, sisters, or brothers—all will attain liberation, fullness, and freedom from hunger. If one does not observe these Eight Days and fails to offer sustenance to ancestors, that is unfilial.

Tell future lives to diligently cultivate pure offerings, for not only do ghosts and spirits gain liberation, but those living in the world will see their wealth increase and will not be harmed by ancestors of seven generations past. Not only will ancestors of seven generations not harm them, but all ghosts, spirits, and external demons and thieves cannot harm them.

Why? Because worldly commoners, when seeking demons and ghosts to worship ancestors without observing the Eight Days, invert the ancestors and thereby commit offenses. Why so? Because offerings not made according to the Eight Days cause the souls to hunger; in their hunger, they generate harm and invite external demons to join in malevolence. If offerings are properly made in accordance with the Eight Days, the departed ancestors rejoice and do not cause harm; all demons and thieves cannot harm them. This is the principle.”

The Immortal Lord said again: “Excellent! What the Heavenly Venerable has just spoken about pure offerings is vast and clear. You mentioned the Eight Days but did not explain what they are—please kindly elucidate.”

The True Being said: “The Eight Days are the fifteenth day of the first month, the fifteenth day of the seventh month, and the fifteenth day of the tenth month—these are called the Three Primordial Days. Then there is the first day of the first month, called the Heavenly Festival; the fifth day of the fifth month, called the Earthly Festival; the seventh day of the seventh month, called the Dao Virtue Festival; the first day of the tenth month, called the People’s Yearly Festival; and the twelfth month’s festival day, called the Nobles’ Festival. These are collectively known as the Eight Days.

If offerings are made outside these Eight Days, the retribution of sins and merits will never reach fruition, as previously explained. Good man, keep this firmly in your heart. What I have now told you is the prescribed ritual of the upper three heavens, written in the Purple Book and Golden Title, the eternal rites of Heaven and Earth—beyond comprehension, not to be disrespected, but to be reverently practiced.”

The second true being Guang Miaoyin addressed the Immortal Lord: “Excellent, excellent, good man! The merit is immense, beyond measure. I have received command from the Heavenly Venerable to descend here with the divine immortals and retinues to you at Ruoye. Why? Because it is inconceivable and because there is nothing to be gained.

Good man, what was just spoken of—the Eight Days—are called the Eight Liberations. On these days, at the hour of the hare, arrange the six-path seats, pure fragrant baths, garments and outer implements, sweet drinks and food, all orderly placed. Daoist priests in the dao field at dawn perform the bathing and proclamation ceremony. At noon, they practice the dao and repentance, and the patrons’ ancestral spirits all depart this day liberated and pure.”

The Immortal Lord said: “Excellent! Can the Great True One open the gate of liberation for all beings and descend for the sake of no gain? I do not understand what the Six Paths are—please explain fully.”

The True Being said: “First is the path of Heaven; second, the path of humans; third, the path of beasts; fourth, the path of spirits; fifth, the path of ghosts; sixth, the path of hell. These are the Six Paths. Good man, keep this firmly in your heart and do not neglect it.”

Next, the third true being Zhen Dingguang said: “Excellent, excellent! Good man, the two great true beings have fully explained the Eight Days, the sequence of merits, and the great principles clearly. Now I will finally speak of the great cause and effect, which I desire to tell you. Do you wish to hear?”  

The Immortal Lord rose with reverence and said: “Compassion and broad kindness do not abandon ordinary people. Today I leap with joy, not by my own ability to express, but earnestly wish the Great True One would illuminate my ignorance. Is it not troublesome to ask?”

The True Being said: “We follow the Heavenly Venerable’s command, truly for past great accomplishments. Why do you hesitate to speak? If you do not speak, you fall into ignorance and sever the seed of the true dao. Moreover, you have cultivated merit in past kalpas—why not speak?

Good man, the merit and cause of offerings have two kinds of intention. What are these two? One is offering that abides in form, called ‘finite.’ The other is offering that does not abide in form, called ‘pure offering,’ or ‘infinite.’ Why? Like the waters of rivers and seas, endlessly cycling. Therefore, this scripture reveals the meaning of infinity, likewise.

Also like the void, boundless and limitless, immeasurable. Therefore, I now reveal the meaning of infinity, likewise. If the waters of rivers and seas cycled finitely, then the meaning of infinity would be finite. But if the void and waters are ultimately unknowable in extent, then the meaning of infinity is likewise.

Good man, you must also understand the meaning of finitude clearly. The finite is like one who recites scripture verses—one or two stanzas, from three to four, up to hundreds of thousands or billions of verses—it is still not many. Why? Because if spoken, it will not last many years, thus it is finite.

Therefore, I now reveal the meaning of finitude, likewise. Also like one who attains a great kingship, wealth accumulated over generations—gold, silver, lapis lazuli, coral, amber, diamond, and various precious scales filling a city—it is still not much. Why? Because if given away, it will not last a month, thus it is finite.

Therefore, I now reveal the meaning of finitude, likewise. Whether reciting endless scripture verses or giving countless treasures by hand, know that this spoken offering abiding in form is called finite. Why? Because all limited things, given away, diminish day by day; unlimited things cannot be exhausted even by kalpas.

Therefore, I now reveal the meaning of finitude, which must be so. Good man, the principle is always so. Not only is this merit of offering so, but all fasting and overnight gatherings are likewise. Should you not diligently practice?

If you can always urge your heart to act without abiding in form and rightly know the meaning of infinity, then surely you will attain the unsurpassed dao. Why? Because there is no self-body, no self-heart. Having no self-body, there is no self-heart.

Having no self-heart, there is no other heart. Having no other heart, all hearts vanish—this is called purity. Attaining no-heart samadhi, attaining no-self samadhi.

Good man, now understand these words clearly. If there is a self-heart that ceases at the other heart, then the self-heart does not vanish—this is called attaining no self in body but not no self in realm.

If you seek the dharma realm’s no-self, you must know originally there is no now, no not now; knowing no now, no not now, you also know there is no dharma realm.

Since the dharma realm is none, it neither arises nor ceases. Neither arising nor ceasing, therefore know it is neither non-arising nor non-ceasing. What is meant by neither arising nor ceasing? Because it is spoken of as dharma.

Therefore, it is said neither arising nor ceasing. If you attain such principle, you are called able to offer pure offerings; you are called attaining the dharma realm’s no-self; you are called attaining the dharma realm’s pure clarity.

Good man, what I now finally say is all that the boundless, limitless Heavenly Venerables, true beings, immortals, and holy daos of old, and the great powerful kings of ghosts and spirits of the ten directions have practiced and attained the unsurpassed dao.

Though you are not named in the register, your title is the Most Supreme Left Immortal Lord. The great immortal rank you now hold—can you not practice it? Surely you will ascend to true being saint, fully possessing the six supernatural powers, accomplishing the unsurpassed dao.”

At that moment, the Immortal Lord rose from his seat, bowed in thanks, and said: “I have now suddenly encountered the Great True One, who bestows such words—truly rare. From countless kalpas past, I have practiced various merits and met immortals who always taught me the minor vehicle’s small wisdom and methods of nourishing life. Never before have I heard the subtle, boundless, limitless, and inconceivable words now spoken by the Great True One.

My burdens, like ice long accumulated, suddenly meet fire and melt away without remainder. I am now unimpeded, likewise. Like the law of selling a son, where father, mother, and brothers wail in sorrow inconceivably, and unexpectedly in a moment, gold and silver fill the treasury, and the son returns, bringing boundless joy—I now rejoice likewise.

Also, like the ancient king’s daughter named Guayin, who was abandoned in the deep mountains, starving and distressed, her life fading, until a true being descended to show her the way, and her illness was immediately cured, she regained speech and fullness, rejoicing boundlessly—I now rejoice likewise.

I earnestly wish the Great True One to command the spirit chariots to pause in the forests and thickets, hoping not to ascend just yet.”

The Great True One said: “We now depart but will soon return.” Having spoken, the three palanquins proceeded in order, the celestial music and arts guiding them as they soared into the clouds. In an instant, they were nowhere to be found.

The Immortal Lord respectfully carried out the instructions. On the fifteenth day, he carefully followed the teachings, grandly establishing the pure offerings with full ceremony. He made a great fruit mountain, eight zhang high, adorned in myriad wondrous and rare decorations. Various sweet fruits filled the mountains and forests, as did abundant rice and meals.

At noon on that day, the ten directions’ hells and the six paths’ sentient beings, their forms all different, countless and boundless, gathered together. Among these ghosts was a great king named Great Might. He advanced before the ghosts and all together bowed and praised in unison: “Excellent, excellent!”

King Great Might said: “Pure realm Daoist priests can open the gate of liberation for us, so that today we, your retinues and countless others, gather here and receive purity and liberation. Without pure precepts and compassion, how could we be your retinues, building pure offerings? We only wish the dharma masters soon attain great immortality and realize the unsurpassed dao.”

The heavenly beings, humans, beasts, spirits, ghosts of hell, and wandering souls all echoed these words. After speaking, they bathed in fragrant waters, donned splendid garments, took their seats according to rank, and had ample food and drink.

At noon’s end, King Great Might and his retinues each took leave of the Immortal Lord, saying: “Dharma Master, excellent, excellent, inconceivable! Because of this compassion, countless souls have attained liberation.” Having spoken, they bowed and departed.

The Immortal Lord addressed future lives, good men and women: “From countless boundless kalpas until today, I have only now been granted by the Great True One these essential words, inconceivable. Though previously I received from the Great True One teachings on offering scriptures, their content was slight and incomplete, not as sudden and profound as the present cause and effect, so deep and far-reaching.

I have also seen a scripture called the *Great Offering* that speaks directly of the Three Primordial Days but does not clarify the Eight Days nor expound the vast merit as here, boundless and limitless, inconceivable. Good men and women, can you not revere and practice this? Those who can respectfully observe this scripture are called filial sons, repaying the kindness of their parents who gave birth and nurtured them. Not only their birth parents but also their true parents are repaid.

Having repaid the true parents, they gradually ascend the stages of the dao fruit. If anyone slanders and disbelieves, failing to offer sustenance to ancestors, that is unfilial and violates the true parents. Why? Because if one does not offer sustenance to ancestors, the souls hunger—this is unfilial. Having been unfilial, and having slandered, one harms the ancestors. The deceased parents suffer all manner of affliction, and their bodies in the world are harmed by demon kings and ghost thieves, afflicted with leprosy and all manner of pain. Future men and women, take heed and be cautious.”
