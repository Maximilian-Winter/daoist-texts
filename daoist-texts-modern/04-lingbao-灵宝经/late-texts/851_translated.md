## Scripture of the Most High Six Fasts and Ten Direct Observances of the Cavernous Mysterious Numinous Treasure

### The Five Precepts of Daoism

First: Do not kill living beings.  
Second: Do not indulge in wine.  
Third: Do not speak with a mouth that contradicts the heart.  
Fourth: Do not steal.  
Fifth: Do not engage in lustful desires.

### The Ten Virtues

First: Hold filial reverence for parents in your thoughts.  
Second: Be loyal and serve your sovereign and teachers.  
Third: Harbor compassion for all things.  
Fourth: Practice patience and tolerate others’ faults.  
Fifth: Counsel and resolve disputes to dispel evil.  
Sixth: Harm yourself less and rescue the poor.  
Seventh: Release life and nurture creatures; plant orchards and groves.  
Eighth: Provide wells by the roadside, plant trees, and build bridges.  
Ninth: Work for the benefit of others, remove harm, and teach those yet unenlightened.  
Tenth: Read the scriptures and precepts of the Three Treasures, constantly offering incense, flowers, and the implements of devotion.

If ordinary people constantly practice these five sincere precepts and ten virtues, then the good spirits of Heaven and Earth will guard them; calamities will be forever extinguished, blessings and protection will endure—this depends solely on firm resolve.

### The Six Annual Fasts

In the first, third, fifth, seventh, ninth, and eleventh months.

### The Ten Monthly Fasts

On the first day, when the Northern Dipper descends.  
On the eighth day, when the Northern Dipper’s officers of killing demons descend.  
On the fourteenth day, when the emissaries of the Great One descend.  
On the fifteenth day, when the Heavenly Emperor and the Three Officials all descend together.  
On the eighteenth day, when the Great One descends again.  
On the twenty-third day, when the eight divine emissaries of the Great One descend.  
On the twenty-fourth day, when the North Star descends.  
On the twenty-eighth day, when the lower Great One descends.  
On the twenty-ninth day, when the middle Great One descends.  
On the thirtieth day, when the upper Great One descends.

From the days when the lower, middle, and upper Great Ones descend, all the honored spirits of Heaven, Earth, and Water come down, traveling throughout the world, observing human good and evil.

On the day of the Jiazi cycle, the Great One reviews the spirits.  
On the day of Gengshen, the Corpse Spirit speaks of human sins.  
On one’s birth day, one’s merits are calculated.  
On the eight seasonal days, eight spirits record human good and evil.  
On the three Yuan days, the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water examine human sins and blessings.

### The Three Assemblies

The seventh day of the first month: the assembly of promotion and reward.  
The seventh day of the seventh month: the mid-year birthday celebration.  
The fifth day of the tenth month: the grand birthday assembly.

### The Five Sacrificial Days

The first day of the first month, called the Heavenly Sacrifice.  
The fifth day of the fifth month, called the Earthly Sacrifice.  
The seventh day of the seventh month, called the Sacrifice of Dao and Virtue.  
The first day of the tenth month, called the People’s Yearly Sacrifice.  
The sacrificial day of the twelfth month, called the Marquis and King Sacrifice.

On the three assembly days, the Three Officials examine merits and faults; it is fitting to receive talismans and amulets, to fast and present petitions praying for bright blessings.

On the five sacrificial days, one should always honor the ancestors, called filial children, who receive boundless blessings. Other days are all licentious sacrifices. Together with the three Yuan days, they form the Eight Release days, all suitable for setting up pure offerings and seeking blessings.

### The Method of Fasting and Observance

The essence of fasting and direct observance lies in abstaining from sweet, rich, greasy, pungent foods, wine, lust, jealousy, envy, and all evil thoughts. One should only burn incense and light lamps, recite scriptures, perform rites of repentance, and wish that all beings universally escape calamities—this is true fasting.

Once Confucius said to Laozi: “I live in poverty, having long abstained from wine and meat.” Laozi replied: “That is the fasting of sacrifice. You must focus your will, not merely listen with your ears, but listen with your heart; not listen with your heart, but with your vital breath. Purify your heart, cleanse your spirit, strike your intellect—I shall speak to you.”

### Commentary

It is said: According to the scriptures, fasting methods have roughly three layers.  
First, setting up offerings and fasting to accumulate virtue and resolve offenses.  
Second, dietary fasting to harmonize spirits and preserve life—this is the fasting of sacrifice, practiced by the middle rank.  
Third, fasting of the heart, meaning to purify the heart and remove desires; cleanse the spirit and remove filth and burdens; strike the intellect and cut off thought. When there is no thought or worry, one focuses solely on the Dao; when there is no craving or desire, one delights in the Dao; when there is no filth or burden, one unites with the Dao. With the heart free of dual thoughts, this is called one-pointed will—this is the practice of the superior person.

To detail fasting: it means to harmonize and regulate the three karmas (body, speech, mind). Only then is it true fasting. If one only guards dietary fasting, the mind and consciousness are not harmonized; if only one-pointed will is held, then the mouth is free of greed for flavor. These two methods complement and support each other. Therefore, the *Great Precepts Scripture* says: “Level the heart, quiet and deep; focus single-mindedly without duality; avoid extremes and flavors; inside and outside be pure and empty.” Though Confucius lightly regarded simple dietary fasting, he did not understand regulating the heart; thus, this fasting method was shown to him to receive the Dao. But among later students, who can truly empty the heart and hold one-pointed will? Those who disdain sacrificial teachings yet claim to understand fasting of the heart are lazy and dull. Though their mouths speak of profound stillness, they do not understand its essence—they are merely proud.

The *Book of Changes* says: “The sage uses this to fast and abstain.”

### On Fate and the World

Each person has their own years, months, days, and hours, determined by their affiliated stars, which fix poverty or wealth, rank or lowliness, life span or brevity. Yet the things of the six families (the Five Phases and the heavens) have union and separation, birth and death, completion and failure, flourishing and decline—this is the constant number of the world, the correspondence of nature.

The five colors are like sharp needles that pierce the eyes.  
The five tones are like hammers that block the ears.  
The five flavors are like axes that cut the tongue.  
Wealth and goods are things that confuse people.

Therefore, no calamity is greater than death; no blessing greater than life.  
Thus, the named name loses my pouch; the nameless name nourishes my dwelling.  
The possessed goods lose me to thieves; the unpossessed goods nourish my fortune.

No sin is greater than lust; no calamity greater than greed; no fault greater than usurpation—these three are the chariot of disaster. Small, they destroy the body; great, they destroy the family.

### Cultivating Life and Nature

To manage livelihood and nurture nature, to carry the spirit and support life, is to leave suffering and ascend to joy, with blessings flowing endlessly.

Human life all depends on the spirit; when the spirit is settled, life is; when the spirit is broken, death comes. Therefore, diligently accumulate heartfelt impressions, and one can raise the form to ascend to the mysterious palace.

People only know rich dishes to sweeten the mouth, and rank and salary to honor the body, but do not consider that sweet food harms life like an axe; luxurious rank and salary provoke the resentment of the world.

### The Primordial Sovereign Speaks

The Primordial Sovereign said: The Dao is the utmost truth of numinous communication. The arts are the mysterious techniques of transformation. Form without form, aided by arts to benefit people. Humans have spirit; through cultivation they meet the Dao. If one can learn it, transformation arises naturally.

The essence of the Dao lies in seeking simplicity and easy access. The secret of protection lies only in talismans, medicine, and qi. Talismans are the numinous writings of the Three Luminaries, the true tokens of Heaven. Medicine is the flower and essence of the Five Phases, the refined fluids of Earth. Qi is the harmonious breath of yin and yang, the numinous vitality of all things.

Though one attains one thing, it is not complete without talisman, medicine, and Dao. Medicine refines the form; talismans summon the spirit.

If a person loves their body, Heaven and Earth cannot harm them.  
If they guard their will, the world cannot defeat them.  
If they are content with poverty, the world cannot enrich them.  
If they delight in lowliness, the world cannot exalt them.

Where there is reverence, there is no disrespect; where there is yielding, there is no contention; where there is humility, there is no arrogance; where there is kindness, there is no cruelty.

Guard straightforwardness and you will be twisted; guard purity and you will be disgraced; guard eloquence and you will be tongue-tied; guard craft and you will be clumsy. To be full without boasting, to be precious without knowing, to love favor without fear.

Do not tread where there is no danger, so a hundred calamities cannot befall you.  
Do not travel the easy path, so dangers cannot threaten you.  
Do not soil your will with rank and salary, so punishments cannot befall you.  
Do not let praise or blame sway your joy or anger, so slander cannot follow you.

A hundred calamities cannot befall you—thus you grasp the essence of all things.  
Dangers cannot threaten you—thus you preserve the blessing of eternal peace.  
Punishments cannot befall you—thus you fulfill your days and years.  
Slander cannot follow you—thus you perfect your pure truth.

If a person can be empty, void, clear, and pure; kind, benevolent, loyal, and trustworthy; filial, respectful, harmonious, and gentle; humble, diligent, frugal, soft, pure, and simple—then they are one with the Dao.

Thus, in applying Dao principle to the body, the heart reaches clarity and the will flows; spirit is cherished and qi is light; matter is despised and fame is cheap; thoughts are not confused; blood and qi are harmonious; muscles and bones are flexible; ears and eyes are sharp; skin is moist and smooth; the face shines with honor; spirit is focused and firm; the body is light and strong; emptiness and fullness follow each other; hair and temples are moist and bright.

Applying principle to the family: fathers are kind, sons filial; husbands trustworthy, wives chaste; elder brothers good, younger brothers obedient; the nine clans harmonious; farming and mulberry timely and abundant; granaries full and piled high; livestock breeding plentiful; affairs orderly; always with surplus.

Thus, when lord and minister have Dao, there is loyalty and kindness; when father and son have Dao, there is love and kindness; when nobles and commoners have Dao, there is mutual affection. Where there is Dao, there is harmony; where there is no Dao, there is discord.

From this we see, the Dao in people cannot be parted from for even a moment.

### Wenzi Asks Laozi

Wenzi asked Laozi: “What are Dao, virtue, benevolence, righteousness, and ritual?”  
Laozi said: “Formless and effortless, internally cultivating the self, externally governing others; when work is done and affairs established, one dwells beside Heaven—that is Dao.  
To nourish, to raise, to fulfill and grow, benefiting all without partiality, harmonizing with Heaven and Earth—that is virtue.  
The superior does not boast of their merit; the inferior does not hide their faults; in great matters does not boast; in small matters does not steal; loving all without selfishness, enduring without decay—that is benevolence.  
The superior supports the weak; the inferior keeps integrity; the capable does not act at will; the poor does not change principles; one measure follows reason; no selfish crookedness—that is righteousness.  
The superior is respectful and stern; the inferior is humble and reverent; yielding and guarding softness; being the female of the world; standing in not daring; setting in not being able—that is ritual.  

Therefore, to cultivate Dao is to submit humbly; to cultivate virtue is to obey humbly; to cultivate benevolence is to not contend humbly; to cultivate righteousness is to be fair and just humbly; to cultivate ritual is to be respectful humbly. When all five are cultivated, the state is peaceful.”

### On Contemporary People

Nowadays, scholars are sharp and discerning, yet near death, they delight in judging others’ faults. Learned and eloquent, yet endangering their own bodies, they delight in exposing others’ evils.

But those who follow Heaven’s laws and observe Earth’s phenomena, extend grace to all beings, and forget to hold on—these truly conform to the Great Dao.

Therefore it is said: Deep practice is Dao and virtue; shallow practice is benevolence and righteousness; thin practice is ritual and music. From this we see, it is better to embrace Dao and hold virtue, naturally simple and pure.

### Laojun Speaks to Lingyangzi

Laojun said to Lingyangzi: “Before, I spoke with the magistrate Yin Xi about marvelous truths, a million words, nine chapters of emptiness and purity. Emptiness and purity are my dwelling; clarity and cleanliness are my abode. Non-action and naturalness are my essence. Simplicity and unity are my name. Harmony without form is my function. Infinite transformation is my change.

Nature is the truth of Dao. Non-action is the constant of Dao. Emptiness and nothingness are the honor of virtue. Detachment is the palace of virtue. Quiet and deep is the spring of virtue. Clear and pure is the neighbor of spirit. Sincerity is the gate of spirit. Moderation and harmony are the root of affairs.

Humans follow Dao by being natural. Therefore, Dao can be attained and penetrated.  
By non-action, life can be prolonged.  
By emptiness and nothingness, qi can flow.  
By detachment, the will can be shared.  
By quiet and deep, sound can cease.  
By clear and pure, spirit can shine.  
By sincerity, the will can be followed.  
By moderation and harmony, transformation can be obeyed.

Therefore, all humans who follow Dao should use naturalness to establish their name; use non-action to nurture their form; use emptiness and nothingness to nurture their spirit; use detachment to preserve their will; use quiet and deep to nurture their body; use clear and pure to calm their heart; use sincerity to guard their will; use moderation and harmony to preserve their spirit.

Calm the heart and roam the will, like great waters naturally settling.  
Live deeply and quietly, like a dragon hidden in the depths.  
Embrace emptiness without resistance, like a bellows drawing in the void.  
Transform and preserve spirit, like the state protecting its achievements.  
Establish honor and dwell in spirit, like ancestral temples guarding benevolence.  
Make yourself unseen, like a giant fish in vast waters.  
Make others not know you, like the sun rising with no east.  
Make your life endless, like the Great Dao without bounds.

The manifestations of Dao are like high mountains and great marshes naturally attracting beasts and wolves; like deep forests and giant trees naturally attracting birds and insects; like rivers, seas, lakes, and ponds naturally attracting fish, turtles, and dragons; like great virtue and peace naturally attracting qilin and phoenixes; like pure sincerity and whiteness naturally attracting jade maidens and auspicious herbs; like moderation and fine responses naturally attracting virtue, good omens, and blessings; like disasters, strange events, and evil deeds naturally attracting demons and calamities.

People often stray from Dao; it is not that Dao leaves people. People often lose life; it is not that life loses people. If Dao and life mutually protect each other, and life and Dao mutually guard each other, never parting, then one can attain longevity.

### On Human Spirit and Cultivation

Among things with form, humans are the most numinous. Though Heaven’s nature is the same, cultivation differs. Why? Because if one cultivates goodness, one gradually becomes a true person; if one indulges in evil, one turns into a fierce soldier.

Therefore, Laojun laments and commands people to learn the Dao.

The way of cultivating the self is the treasure of the nation; it must be loved and honored.

Yet the root of the body has three: one is spirit, two is essence, three is qi. These three come from the qi of Heaven and Earth. Spirit is received from Heaven. Essence is received from Earth. Qi is received from harmony.

Together they form one Dao. Spirit is the vehicle of form. Qi is the chariot of spirit. Essence dwells within. The three assist each other as principle.

Those who desire longevity should love qi, honor spirit, and respect essence. Qi arises from essence; essence arises from spirit; spirit arises from brightness. Humans are originally qi of yin and yang; qi transforms into essence; essence transforms into spirit; spirit transforms into brightness.

Therefore, those who do not desire aging should guard their primordial qi and harmonize essence, so that the form does not depart but unites as one. Thus, the body becomes light and the will refined. This is the birth of spiritual light. The heart is greatly peaceful, joyful as if rejoicing.

If one closes the eyes and lies down, focusing the will inside the body, with inner intention not departing, then the body is refined and form transformed. Thus, true principle is attained, and great peace naturally follows.

Spirit is the sovereign. Essence is the minister. Qi is the people.

Therefore, the way of cultivating the self is to calm spirit and nurture qi, not to desire joy or anger. If one can control these, qi strengthens itself, intention is fulfilled, a hundred evils depart, myriad diseases vanish, light and brightness appear, and good spirits respond.

Therefore it is said: The Great Dao is vast and broad; it does not depart from the body. The first and foremost fruit is among practitioners of the nine transformations of immortality.

One: Follow goodness.  
Two: Block evil.  
Three: Widely give life and aid beings.  
Four: Encourage and assist the good.  
Five: Distribute wealth and power.  
Six: Make great vows to benefit others.  
Seven: Be kind in body, harming no creatures.  
Eight: Be kind in speech, harming no beings.  
Nine: Be kind in heart, always thinking of good.

Constantly practice these nine deeds, not omitting one.
