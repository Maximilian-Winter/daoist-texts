The Heavenly Venerable spoke:  
“Good men and good women, if you desire to behold your past, present, and future three lifetimes without falling into manifold calamities, then with utmost sincerity receive and uphold this scripture. On all auspicious days, cultivate goodness and build merit; you shall see your body at ease and joyful, and your life shall soar to the heavens.”

The Heavenly Venerable spoke:  
“The first, third, fifth, seventh, ninth, and eleventh months are the months of extended fasting. Those who complete fasting throughout these months shall witness their bodies transcend as immortals, their entire household shall enjoy health and peace, and their seven ancestral generations shall remain free from affliction.”

The Heavenly Venerable spoke:  
“On the seventh day of the first month, the Heavenly Bureau convenes to confer rewards. On the seventh day of the seventh month, the Earthly Court holds the salvation assembly. On the fifth day of the tenth month, the Water Palace establishes the birth assembly. These three assemblies are auspicious days; those who fast long on these days shall have their family gates spared from plague for ten thousand kalpas.”

The Heavenly Venerable spoke:  
“The fifteenth day of the first month, the fifteenth day of the seventh month, and the fifteenth day of the tenth month are the three prime fasting days. Those who fast long on these days shall extend their lifespan and augment their destiny, never to behold manifold suffering.”

The Heavenly Venerable spoke:  
“The first day of the first month is the Heavenly Sacrifice; the fifth day of the fifth month is the Earthly Sacrifice; the seventh day of the seventh month is the Dao Virtue Sacrifice; the first day of the tenth month is the People’s Year Sacrifice; the twelfth month meets the Royal Sacrifice. Every month on the first and fifteenth days, on the day of the Jiazi cycle, on one’s birth sign day, and on the Gengshen day, if one can fast long and recite the scripture, no wish shall go unfulfilled.”

The Heavenly Venerable spoke:  
“Every month on the first, eighth, fourteenth, fifteenth, eighteenth, twenty-third, twenty-fourth, twenty-eighth, twenty-ninth, and thirtieth days are the ten direct days. Those who fast long on these days shall receive blessings in life and death, enjoying peace and joy for ten thousand kalpas.”

The Heavenly Venerable spoke:  
“The commencement of spring, the spring equinox, the commencement of summer, the summer solstice, the commencement of autumn, the autumn equinox, the commencement of winter, and the winter solstice are the eight seasonal fasting days. Practicing the dao and observing precepts, fasting long and reciting scripture on these days, one’s household shall rejoice, and the seven ancestors shall be glad.”

The Heavenly Venerable spoke:  
“Those who fast long on auspicious days shall be free from calamity for ten thousand kalpas and witness peace in the world. Moreover, if someone can write out this scripture in ten scrolls, ten thousand kalpas of sin shall be erased. One hundred scrolls shall cause the demon kings to protect and watch over. One thousand scrolls shall enable flight; all evil spirits, goblins, and the five plague demons shall not pass the gate. Benevolent spirits of the region shall constantly come to benefit. Past kalpas and present kalpas—all sins shall be utterly destroyed. Those who write and uphold this scripture for good people shall have boundless blessings.”

The Heavenly Venerable spoke:  
“If someone faces hardship, struggles in battle, is beset by tigers, wolves, venomous insects, grudges, evil men in war, disasters, storms, or thieves, or suffers all manner of illness, and wishes to reach the end of life, reciting this scripture shall summon the Supreme Immortal to swiftly come and save them. In an instant, liberation is granted; no wish shall be unmet.”

“This scripture is the foundation for the Most Perfect True Person to uphold, the root of attaining the dao. If one sees this scripture and receives, upholds, and recites it, none shall fail to transcend as immortals. Without seeing this scripture, there is no way to attain the dao.”

Upon hearing these words, all bowed their heads, offered thanks to the Heavenly Venerable, and accepted with faith to observe and practice.
