## Scripture of the Twenty-Four Precepts Spoken by the True Person of the Supreme Ultimate

At that time, the Primordial Heavenly Venerable, born before Heaven and Earth, spread qi throughout the Ten Directions, accomplishing myriad phenomena. He is the lord of humans and heavens, the sovereign of rivers and mountains. The sun and moon follow his movement; the four seasons receive their forms from him. He created the ladder and ferry of the dao, the bridge of birth and death. He manifests the existent and enters the non-existent, responding with timely expedients, teaching according to conditions, to save all living beings.

He fashioned the dharma body, pervading all under Heaven, perfecting all wisdom, stirring boundless minds. Sometimes he appears as an emperor, sometimes as a magistrate, sometimes as a clerk, sometimes as a monastic, sometimes as a dharma master, sometimes as a dragon king, sometimes as a man, sometimes as a woman, sometimes as a beggar, sometimes as one lowly and despised. With myriad transformations, he conforms to the world; yet ordinary eyes cannot see him.

Because of this ignorance, beings are born into confusion, mistaking right and wrong, self and other. Greed and folly arise from love and desire. From attachment springs hell, forging enemies bound by hatred. From birth to birth, from kalpa to kalpa, never awakening to true mindfulness, body and mind unmoored from the source of stillness, they rise from falsehood and sink into evil paths, drifting on the river of desire, buffeted by the winds of karma—how could they find true stillness?

Sowing the three karmas themselves, the ten evil thoughts arise. Within the true dharma, they make distinctions, sinking forever in the sea of suffering, with no cause for liberation. Always remember the boundless suffering of sentient beings. Now I transmit these precepts to halt evil and prevent transgressions. Those who rely on and practice them will attain the fruit of the dao.

The True Person of the Supreme Ultimate further said: In my past five hundred lives, I resolved to cultivate the dao and saw that all dharmas are none other than true dharma. Why so? Because they are not seen as false. Knowing all dharmas, none is untrue. Why? Because of true knowing.

Thus, those who see falsehood see falsehood; those who see truth see truth. Only by making the true mind do we have true wisdom. Truth does not depart from falsehood; it transforms falsehood back into truth. Falsehood does not depart from truth; deluded truth becomes false. But if one can sever falsehood and return to truth, if precepts are fulfilled as spoken and practiced, recited day and night, there will be no hell, only the attainment of heaven.

Whenever observing precepts, on the first, eighth, fourteenth, fifteenth, eighteenth, twenty-third, twenty-fourth, twenty-eighth, twenty-ninth, and thirtieth days of the month—if the month is short, take the twenty-seventh day—these are called the Ten Straight Fasting Days.

On the days of the Beginning of Spring, Spring Equinox, Beginning of Summer, Summer Solstice, Beginning of Autumn, Autumn Equinox, Beginning of Winter, and Winter Solstice—these are called the Eight Seasonal Fasting Days.

On the fifteenth day of the first, seventh, and tenth months—these are called the Three Primal Fasting Days.

On the first day of the first, fourth, seventh, and tenth months—these are called the Four Commencement Fasting Days.

On the seventh day of the first month, seventh day of the seventh month, and fifth day of the tenth month—these are called the Three Assembly Fasting Days.

On such days, practitioners gather together, cultivating the dao and observing precepts, whether few or many. They dwell in quiet chambers, observing pure fasts, chanting praises, and sincerely burning incense. Or they may be in a contemplation hall, called a blessed land, sweeping and cleaning the rooms and courtyards, which is the mysterious altar. Able dharma masters bend to recite my wondrous sincerity, burning myriad fragrant offerings.

At such times, left and right officials and messengers appear, along with the thirty-two numinous celestial immortals and sovereigns, the ten-direction spiritual officials, generals of the Five Sacred Mountains, local spirits of the nine provinces, mountain and forest elders, water palace numinous beings, twelve stream maidens, flying heavenly kings, heavenly youths, and countless host without number—all assemble at once to hear the recitation of precepts.

They record the merits and note the hearts that arise. Surely they will erase the offenders’ karmic debts. Those who firmly copy, receive, uphold, and often recite these precepts, from kalpa to kalpa, birth to birth, will never fall into hell.

The True Person spoke verses on the precepts, saying: Now we, all assembled, with deep shame and reverence, each accept and uphold them. We only wish the precept masters to explain them at all times.

The True Person of the Supreme Ultimate further said: These twenty-four sincere precepts are great afflictions of the body. Those who violate them face blades for myriad kalpas, constantly tested by the judges of birth and death. Ordinary people may suffer pains all over, or their bodies turn blue and red, their hearts filled with sorrow. This is the soul’s trial in the dark tribunal. One must exert all strength, burn incense, enter fasting, perform dao rituals and repentance, hold the mind to receive precepts, call upon the Most High Heavenly Venerable, offer lamps and charity, widely create merit, and never transgress again—then their sins will surely be removed.

The True Person further said: Whoever wishes to learn the dao must first fast and observe precepts, cleanse the heart and prevent calamities. The merit of holding precepts exceeds the number of dust particles. The number of dust particles can be seen and measured; the merit of fasting and precepts is boundless and endless.

If one person holds precepts, nine ancestors ascend to heaven, the whole family receives grace, and in times of peril, they are spared dissolution. Even if one gives away all family wealth in charity, one must still uphold this scripture of precepts. If one studies the dao but does not uphold these precepts, one will never attain accomplishment.

Those who uphold these precepts have the support of all heavenly emperors, numinous saints, divine immortals, jade maidens, and all spiritual officers of the boundless world. Burning incense and lighting lamps, those who uphold precepts receive immeasurable blessings, swiftly attaining the true dao. The heavens greet them with fragrant flowers, surely escorting these beings to rebirth as they wish.

If good men and women hear this scripture of precepts and their hearts rejoice, evil karma is removed. If they can abandon stinginess and greed, using pure wealth to redeem the transmitted scriptures and precepts, arousing dedication and diligent practice, then for the deceased at their funerals—whether on the seventh day or the final seventh day—reciting this scripture will allow their souls to fly to pure realms and be reborn in heaven.

Pregnant women hearing this scripture, when facing peril and dissolution, if for their own calamity, will have suffering and karma eliminated, and their whole family will receive boundless blessings.

Precepts restrain vexations, sever demonic hearts; strive diligently to cultivate and seek liberation early. The heavens sing together, chanting verses:

> All who cultivate and learn,  
> Swear to attain the true dao.  
> Compassionately recall the precepts,  
> Cutting off vexations with their sound.  
> Forever free from birth and death’s suffering,  
> Attaining the unsurpassed dao.  
> Returning the heart toward true reality,  
> The rosy countenance never fades nor ages.
