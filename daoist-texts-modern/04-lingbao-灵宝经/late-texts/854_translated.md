## The Most High’s Twelve Supreme Grades Flying Heaven Dharma Wheel Admonition and Precept Scripture

### Transmission from the Supreme Ultimate Perfected One to the Left Immortal Elder

My original master is the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, who dwells in the Great Luo’s all-encompassing celestial treasure palace. There, amid the natural fragrant realm’s Dao-virtue flower terrace, never abandoning the seed of mind, he vowed to ferry all beings across. Silent yet moving, he wields the equalizing heart, and by means of skillful expedients, he opens myriad wondrous gates, unfolds great compassion and kindness, and through the law of non-action benefits and aids the three times. Thus, he manifests a transformation body named the Void Sovereign. The title Void Sovereign is also called the Dao Lord. The Dao Lord’s transformations pervade the Ten Directions, the Three Thousand Great Thousand Limitless Worlds. Each world contains various lands; each land manifests transformation bodies; each transformation body emits boundless light; within each light appear true images; each true image shines with a perfect radiance, dazzling like the sun, illuminating and connecting with Heaven. Beyond the heavenly sun’s surface, no shadow remains unilluminated; the wondrous perfect brightness penetrates all obstacles. Sentient beings receive blessings, plants and animals feel gratitude; the Three Paths cease contention, the Six Paths ascend and progress. Heaven and humans overflow with joy; hells stand empty and idle; everywhere touched is pure and serene; the Dharma realm shines with light. Then, gathering all the radiance, he returns to the Dao and merges with his body; the true ritual is serene and clear, revealing and opening subtle mysteries. He then strikes the golden finger, releasing jade-like sounds. At that moment, bells and drums sound by themselves; heavenly immortals leap with joy; golden censers and precious instruments emit fragrant smoke on their own. All the heavenly beings and countless multitudes increase their grace power, assembling in non-action; their spirits awaken and understand; worldly worries are instantly forgotten; entering the source of wisdom and meditation, they behold the limitless sage and together see the Most High Primordial Heavenly Worthy.

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy spoke to the Wonderful Practice Perfected One and the great assembly, saying: “Today is auspicious; this moment is auspicious; your hearts are auspicious; the great assembly is auspicious. Therefore, for you, I open the workings of compassion, to protect the world, the scant blessings and inferior merits of all beings, so that all may ascend and advance, never to decline or perish. Hence, I now establish the unsurpassed bulwark, faithfully protecting all beings, increasing the virtuous and good. This is called the Nine True Wondrous Precepts, the illuminating light of wisdom, to which the Three Realms and Ten Directions turn in faith and acceptance. Therefore, I now speak to bring peace and joy to all beings, truly as I have said.” At that time, the assembly, foreseeing the speaker, each fixed their hearts, long kneeling and bowing their heads, returning their lives to the holy honored one, universally wishing great compassion, receiving the revered precepts. Thus, diligently requesting, for half a kalpa, the heavens scattered incense, the saints offered treasures, bowing and knocking three times, with no turning back of heart.

Then, seeing this diligent request, the Compassionate Venerable joyfully praised: “All sentient beings, due to ignorance and attachment, fall into the long night and ultimately perish. My worry and care surpass that of parents; my grace is heavy and all-encompassing. Like children who fall into a deep abyss, that abyss is dark and perilous, full of poisonous snakes. When parents learn of this, they feel great pity and compassion; first, they recite divine spells to restrain the venomous snakes, to keep their child’s body intact, unharmed by swallowing. Using firm bindings and treasure poles, and hook ladders, they send strong men inside to support and rescue, all so the child may emerge onto the broad path. The children, foolish and ignorant, do not know fear or distance; if they fall again, they surely lose their lives. Parents again report to the Heavenly Worthy, who devises new plans, teaching divine spells to subdue the poisonous snakes, again placing the child on the treasure pole, guiding them away from danger. So too is my method now. The bottomless Three Paths are nothing but a deep abyss; all sufferings and poisons are like the most venomous snakes. All sentient beings are my children; therefore, honor these precepts. This divine script and spell can extinguish ignorance in a single thought. This is the method of peace and joy, the supreme path of advancement, revered by sages of the three times. Even the Four and Eight Heavenly Realms, the five hundred million earthly abodes, emperors and empresses, princes and princesses, and all officials, when first assuming office, should all recite and uphold them. Moreover, all Daoist hearts, monastics and laypeople, the four ranks, men and women, whether noble or humble, mountain or city, all sentient beings without rank or class distinctions, when desiring to receive precepts, must first purify themselves, vow great aspirations, go to the master’s gate, perform the Daoist rites and recitations. If no master is available to confer them, one must obtain all good teachings and recite before the Three Treasures’ seat, saying: ‘What is called seeing good? It is as if in the place of Daoist rites and recitations, the eyes open to divine light, shining like the sun, beginning small and growing large, illuminating the Three Realms brilliantly. Heaven, earth, mountains, and rivers have no obstacles; even all boundless wondrous causes—this is called brightness, the pure and unblemished mark of precepts. If not so, it is not the cause of receiving precepts.’ If one meets a great good master, this is called a fortunate karmic assembly; no need to seek other signs. Now I tell you, to meet the cause of precepts is rare across kalpas; at this moment and occasion, you must arouse your determined heart and rise together with good thoughts.”

Then the Heavenly Worthy spoke a verse:

> With equal heart I speak the true wondrous precepts,  
> To bring peace and joy to all, seated in the Dao’s hall.  
> Heavenly dragons, demons, spirits,  
> Yakshas and non-humans alike,  
> The foremost eloquent ones all receive and uphold.  
> Know that those who gain precepts enter true sacred ranks.  
> Whether heavenly or mortal sages, all should hold reverence.  
> On the new and full moon days, ascend the lion’s seat.  
> Upright heart, regulate vital breath,  
> Harmoniously proclaim these precepts.  
> All who hear the Dharma sound silently listen.  
> Those who do not recite themselves, through faith enter the hall of blessings.  
> Therefore, at this auspicious time, I proclaim wondrous precepts for you.  
> Once you have received precepts, you should spread and proclaim them.  
> Whoever desires to receive precepts, or read and recite them,  
> Must first take refuge in the Three Treasures, then declare the precept texts.  
> Those who properly uphold and recite shall see seven kinds of worldly blessings.  
> You must firmly believe without arising doubt:  
> One, those with short lives shall timely gain longevity.  
> Two, the ignorant nature shall open a vast heart.  
> Three, the lowly form shall gradually become noble.  
> Four, the poor and destitute shall soon become wealthy.  
> Five, the ugly countenance shall increase in beauty.  
> Six, internal and external illnesses shall gradually be removed and healed.  
> Seven, afflictive causes shall quickly find great peace and health.  
> Know that those who receive precepts gain such blessings and virtues.  
> Future superior good causes, for countless eons without end,  
> Will ascend the six thirty-ninth ranks and attain the unsurpassed Dao.

From the Heavenly Worthy who Fulfills All Wishes.

After speaking this verse, the Heavenly Worthy addressed the four assemblies: “Those who desire to hear the great Dao’s Dharma sound and receive the Perfected One’s precepts must be pure inside and out, with the three karmas clean and pure, listening attentively and accepting sincerely, upholding according to the law. All who receive and uphold precepts take refuge in the Three Treasures, sincerely affirming goodness, without arising divergent thoughts.”

Take refuge in the Dao, the Scripture, and the Master, the Three Treasures.

The Heavenly Worthy said: “Disciples who receive true precepts must not engage in the killing trade, nor commit suicide, nor instruct others to kill, nor kill by expedient means, nor rejoice in killing, nor kill due to circumstances, nor kill out of necessity, nor repay killing, nor kill out of anger—such kinds of killing are all forbidden. Compassionate regard for sentient beings is like one’s own life. Those who kill incur six kinds of karmic retribution:  
One, they meet evil retribution in this world;  
Two, they become enemies to all sentient beings;  
Three, ghosts and spirits gather calamities against them;  
Four, the proper retribution is death and descent into hell, sword trees and knife mountains, suffering endless torment without respite;  
Five, miscellaneous retribution as beasts and animals, devouring each other;  
Six, even if reborn human, they suffer punishment and slaughter again.  
This is a great evil karma, not the conduct of a true person.

**Killing and evil karma are extinguished.**

The Heavenly Worthy said: “Disciples who receive true precepts must not steal or take what is not rightfully theirs. Even lost items on the road, blown by wind or carried by birds, or found in the wild, none may be accepted. Nor may one kill to seize by force, or take by threat or coercion, or entice others, not even a fraction of a coin or grain of millet. Those who steal incur five kinds of karmic retribution:  
One, they beg for a lowly body, poor and humble;  
Two, their endeavors fail, all things wasted, harmed by water, fire, and insects;  
Three, they often suffer quarrels and lose wealth;  
Four, proper retribution is universal plunder in hell, painful and unbearable;  
Five, miscellaneous retribution as cattle, horses, and beasts.  
This is a great evil karma, not the conduct of a true person.

**Stealing and evil karma are extinguished.**

The Heavenly Worthy said: “Disciples who receive true precepts must not engage in illicit sexual conduct, cohabiting with men and women in turbid disorder, defiling monastics, violating chastity, without distinguishing old or young, kin or stranger, nor choosing beauty or ugliness, nor sparing brothers and sisters—such causes are all forbidden. Those who commit illicit sexual acts incur seven kinds of karmic retribution:  
One, the root of birth and death;  
Two, the source of defilement and affliction;  
Three, the ruin of cultivating good deeds;  
Four, the cause of short life, loss of soul and vigor;  
Five, waking and sleeping confused, nature of consciousness lost;  
Six, death and descent into hell, iron beds and copper pillars, flesh scorched and bones rotten, wandering cold pools, ice spears and frost blades, death and rebirth without end, suffering great torment;  
Seven, miscellaneous retribution as pigs, dogs, and unclean beasts.  
This is a great evil karma, not the conduct of a true person.

**Illicit sexual evil karma is extinguished.**

The Heavenly Worthy said: “Disciples who receive true precepts must not speak falsehoods or slander, nor revile the Three Treasures, emperors, teachers, monastics, or laypeople, nor uphold or break the law improperly, regardless of mortal or sage, all should be respected and properly honored. If different appearances or teachings arise, distinct yet equally good, one may follow without causing disputes. Those who slander incur six kinds of karmic retribution:  
One, they suffer evil diseases in this world;  
Two, they face darkness without illumination in the future;  
Three, for hundreds of kalpas, miscellaneous retribution as blind and limbless worms;  
Four, though among humans, they lack tongue roots;  
Five, they are constantly held in resentment and hatred, loved and respected by none;  
Six, in life after life, they have no affinity with goodness, their words not believed, and are shunned by people.  
This is a great evil karma, not the conduct of a true person.

**Slanderous evil karma is extinguished.**

The Heavenly Worthy said: “Disciples who receive true precepts must not engage in double-tongued evil speech, harsh curses, or poison words that harm sentient beings, foment disputes, and cause strife between parties. Even ghosts, spirits, and ordinary people dislike hearing or seeing such speech, much less sages. Those with evil speech incur six kinds of karmic retribution:  
One, they often suffer humiliation in this world;  
Two, upon death descend into hell, tongues pulled out and plowed;  
Three, become mute among humans;  
Four, are hated and harmed by others;  
Five, in all directions, they are constantly dissatisfied;  
Six, receive retribution as pigs, dogs, bees, scorpions, poisonous insects, even two-headed snakes and nine-headed birds.  
This is a great evil karma, not the conduct of a true person.

**Evil speech and double-tongued evil karma are extinguished.**

The Heavenly Worthy said: “Disciples who receive true precepts must not be jealous of those superior to themselves, nor suppress the wise and virtuous, nor lack Dao and virtue themselves, nor maliciously slander and harm, stirring up evil thoughts and causing destruction. Those who harbor jealousy incur five kinds of karmic retribution:  
One, they never see the Three Treasures and sages;  
Two, sever all good connections, entangled in calamity;  
Three, proper retribution is ignorance, deafness, and blindness;  
Four, often face dangers and difficulties, bringing about their own destruction;  
Five, evil causes and afflictions never cease.  
This is a great evil karma, not the conduct of a true person.

**Jealous evil karma is extinguished.**

The Heavenly Worthy said: “Disciples who receive true precepts must not be stingy and greedy, harming others to benefit themselves. When seeing sentient beings, their hearts never rest; they skillfully admonish, with a mind of few desires. The causes of greed and attachment are like drinking salty water or a leaking vessel, impossible to fill. Those who are stingy and greedy incur four kinds of karmic retribution:  
One, they experience many gains and losses in the world;  
Two, later become lowly, hungry, and cold;  
Three, become hungry ghosts, swallowing fire and coal;  
Four, destined to fall among wolves, birds, insects, and beasts.  
This is a great evil karma, not the conduct of a true person.

**Stingy and greedy evil karma is extinguished.**

The Heavenly Worthy said: “Disciples who receive true precepts must not indulge in anger, harsh speech, cruelty, or violence. Those given to anger incur four kinds of karmic retribution:  
One, they waste spirit and qi, harmed by toxic forces;  
Two, sentient beings dislike seeing or hearing them;  
Three, upon death become poisonous birds, bees, snakes, and evil beasts;  
Four, even if born human, they are lowly, foolish, despised, and powerless.  
This is evil karma, not the conduct of a true person.

**Anger evil karma is extinguished.**

The Heavenly Worthy said: “Disciples who receive true precepts must not be reckless and foolish, self-willed and perverse, deceiving the wise and good, refusing correction. Those foolish and perverse incur four kinds of karmic retribution:  
One, divine beings do not protect them;  
Two, they sever good roots;  
Three, they lose the right path and enter error;  
Four, ghosts and demons haunt them.  
This is a great evil karma, not the conduct of a true person.

**Foolish and perverse evil karma is extinguished.**

The Heavenly Worthy said: “Disciples who receive true precepts must not rebel against kings, lack loyalty and righteousness, raise armies, and harm the innocent. Those disloyal incur six kinds of karmic retribution:  
One, they suffer themselves;  
Two, they ruin their families;  
Three, after death remain in the Three Paths, kalpa after kalpa without escape;  
Four, receive retribution as poisonous snakes and evil beasts;  
Five, even if reborn human, suffer further slaughter;  
Six, are always born in evil places, without freedom.  
This is a great evil karma, not the conduct of a true person.

**Disloyal evil karma is extinguished.**

The Heavenly Worthy said: “Disciples who receive true precepts must not lack filial heart, disobey parents, fail to generate respect and love, neglect kin, forget kindness, or lack shame. Those unfilial incur six kinds of karmic retribution:  
One, punished by royal laws;  
Two, abandoned and despised by sentient beings;  
Three, destined for hell, suffering tenfold torments;  
Four, become owls and hawks, harming each other;  
Five, even if born human, unfilial causes lead to mutual harm between men and women;  
Six, punished by heaven’s thunder, beheaded and cut down.  
This is a great evil karma, not the conduct of a true person.

**Unfilial evil karma is extinguished.**

The Heavenly Worthy said: “Disciples who receive true precepts must not drink wine or eat meat, nor encourage others to do so. Those who drink wine incur three kinds of karmic retribution:  
One, they obstruct good Dharma in this world and dull their divine consciousness in the future;  
Two, become mad and confused, lacking decisive clarity, often equal in body to bats and frogs;  
Three, even if reborn human, their consciousness is lost and confused, suffering from evil ignorance and other retributions.  
Those who eat meat incur two kinds of karmic retribution:  
One, they do not practice good Dharma, sever the seed of compassion, and everywhere repay sentient beings as enemies;  
Two, their families scatter, with much sorrow and little joy, destined for hungry ghost and hell realms, bodies as wolves and dogs.  
This is a great evil karma, not the conduct of a true person.

**Drinking wine and eating meat evil karma are extinguished.**

The Heavenly Worthy said: “The above twelve great evil karmas you should quickly reflect upon and diligently practice repentance. If you do not repent, after the body perishes, the wind blade will test the body, and you will long fall into evil destinies, life after life, with no affinity to the Dao. Sentient and insentient beings dislike hearing or seeing this; how much less the truly wise body and mind, who endure patiently.”

After speaking these precepts, the Heavenly Worthy again chanted: “Disciples who receive true precepts should next make great vows, so that the root of precepts is firm like the Mysterious Capital Mountain; the marks of precepts are dignified like the Jade Capital Palace; the virtue of precepts shines bright like a lapis lazuli pearl.” The heavens and humans sang in unison, then spoke this verse:

> Bowing to the Three Realms’ Lord,  
> Returning life to the myriad Dao’s honored one.  
> May the true wondrous precepts be bestowed,  
> Opening the path for Heaven and humans.  
> Able to awaken a fragment of good heart,  
> With sincere heart never retreating.  
> May power always protect and aid,  
> Together returning to the Seven Treasure Grove.
