At that time, the Primordial Heavenly Sovereign (Yuanshi Tianzun) resided in the Nine-Flower Cloud Palace of the Xiangji Kingdom within the Dragon Luo World. Seated upon a great lotus, surrounded by the holy assembly of the Ten Directions and countless beings from innumerable realms, he held a grand assembly teaching the Dharma. For one hundred days, he did not rise from his seat. Throughout Heaven and Earth, whether beings were aware or unaware, countless sentient beings all departed from suffering, received blessings, and benefited. They awakened to the illusory nature of the body, recognizing its impurity, stench, and defilement. Moment by moment, they perceived impermanence, entering profound and wondrous samadhi, abandoning all fetters, able to comprehend the true Dao, rekindling benevolent hearts, single-mindedly turning toward it, sincere and unwavering.

The Primordial Heavenly Sovereign, moved by great compassion and kindness, taught with equality and transformation, enabling all to awaken and understand, to meet the realm of true constancy, and to realize fruit without action. The Heavenly Sovereign gathered his spirit and returned to the hall of eternal joy, emptiness, and tranquility. Suddenly, from the world of the Abandoned Worthies, ten splendid immortals and five hundred and forty others, all clasping hands and bowing their heads to the ground, addressed the Heavenly Sovereign: “We disciples have, through countless kalpas, wandered the cycles of birth and death. By cause and condition, we have encountered the Heavenly Sovereign. Today’s celebration is truly immeasurable and inconceivable. Yet, although we have attained the rank of immortals, our faults are not yet exhausted. We constantly fear the cycles, unable to escape birth and death. This parting from the Heavenly Sovereign may last for myriad kalpas, and we do not know when we shall meet again. We wish to ask, but fear to offend your august countenance. We earnestly beseech your great mercy to graciously grant us a little leniency.”

The Heavenly Sovereign replied: “You who have vowed through countless kalpas, though studying the dao of immortality, have not yet entered the Great Vehicle. Thus, your immortal rank has not reached the supreme realm, and you cannot avoid birth and death. Once parted from me, you will find it difficult to meet again in myriad kalpas. Now that you ask, this is the proper time. Each should calm your heart and not harbor worry or fear.”

These immortals bowed their heads and said: “We shall follow the Heavenly Sovereign’s teachings. We see the lands of the Ten Directions, where men and women are pure, joyful, and effortless; and again, we see lands where men and women are foul, troubled, and beset with myriad worries. We do not yet understand what practices lead to such purity and noble appearance, nor what deeds bring about such defilement and torment. We humbly beseech the Heavenly Sovereign to grant us discernment and clearly reveal the future.”

The Heavenly Sovereign said: “There is no gate for sin or merit except that which beings themselves summon. The retribution for good and evil corresponds entirely to one’s own body. If one cultivates good deeds, one will be born in the Pure Land, with noble appearance and a long lifespan. If one commits evil and creates sin, one dwells in the defiled land, with ugly form and shortened life. The causes and conditions of good and evil all arise from one’s own actions; they do not come from others. Listen carefully, so that you may understand.”

The Heavenly Sovereign said: “When a person is born, they establish great merit and cultivate various practices. According to past vows, they attain birth in the Pure Land, free and effortless. All merit falls into five categories, embracing the gates of all blessings.

First is the merit of preaching the Dharma. This means constantly using the Heavenly Sovereign’s Three Caverns Scriptures and Dharma to teach sentient beings with skillful means, adapting to their roots and capacities—high, middle, and low grades; dull or sharp intellect; ordinary or wise. Whether broad or narrow, using parables and realities, all are enabled to awaken, enter the true reality, see the worlds of men and heavens, protect all, honor the past, and be born into various heavens. Or they become wise and intelligent, great Dharma masters.

Second is the merit of giving. This means relinquishing body, life, and wealth without stinginess, with four kinds of causes.

One is internal giving: offering one’s head, eyes, marrow, brain, hands, feet, hair, and body to give. Hungry hawks, starving tigers, poisonous snakes, fierce beasts, relatives, and strangers—all according to their desires—beg for head for head, eye for eye, body for body, hand for hand, with no attachment or reluctance, saving all beings.

Two is external giving, which has four kinds of causes.

One is compassionate giving: to the hungry, cold, old, sick, prisoners, starving dogs, the poor and destitute. With great compassion, offering clothes and food as needed, saving the people.

Two is Dharma giving: building spiritual temples, making images, copying scriptures, ringing bells and chimes, incense, oils, and ritual implements, holding fasts and precepts in monasteries, supporting the Three Treasures, providing all necessities.

Three is difficult giving: giving one’s country, city, wife, and children—things loved by all more than life itself. To give these is difficult. One who understands all phenomena as impermanent, knowing that wife, children, city, and country are but dependencies of cause and condition, will not feel regret or loss. They relinquish the hard to give, inconceivably.

Four is easy giving: vehicles, horses, servants, clothes, food, gold, silver, brocade, rice, wheat, utensils—all are transient and easily relinquished. This is easy giving, universal to all, regardless of saint or commoner.

These four kinds of giving further divide into twenty types:

One, giving the body; two, giving labor; three, giving wife and children; four, giving country and city; five, giving gardens and houses; six, giving servants; seven, giving vehicles and horses; eight, giving clothes; nine, giving utensils; ten, giving treasures; eleven, giving brocade and silk; twelve, giving rice and wheat; thirteen, giving timber; fourteen, giving incense and oil; fifteen, giving food and drink; sixteen, giving music; seventeen, giving flowers and medicines; eighteen, giving ritual robes; nineteen, giving ritual implements; twenty, giving power and prestige.

All these twenty fall under the gate of giving. ‘Giving’ means spreading boundlessly; ‘giving’ means bestowing on all. Hence it is called giving.

Third is the merit of establishment. This means establishing and constructing, for past, present, and future, relying on all connections and thoughts, fifteen kinds according to one’s vow.

One, building spiritual temples: holy, true, immortal sites; mysterious altars and pavilions; halls, towers, lodgings, and chambers; terraces, pavilions, and gardens, all complete, enduring through eternal kalpas.

Two, making images: of the Three Times and Ten Directions’ Heavenly Sovereigns; Supreme Holy True Immortals; Vajra warriors; jade boys and jade maidens; guardian kings; carved in gold, jade, bronze, iron, wood, and stone; embroidered, painted, molded in clay and tile; all suitably adorned, decorated, with perfect features, so all may take refuge.

Three, making scriptures and Dharma: the Three Caverns and Seven Sections, holy true immortal transmissions, talismanic charts and methods, records, praises, and hymns; on paper, silk, bamboo slips, and stone tablets; carefully collated and published; circulated for reading and recitation; teaching men and heavens.

Four, making tents and seats: large and small, high and low, suitably adorned, to gather essence.

Five, making incense flowers: gold, silver, pearls, and jade; embroidered, painted, carved, woven, all according to ability; for offering to the Three Honored Ones.

Six, making banners, flags, standards, and carriages: nine lights, seven treasures, sandalwood and fragrant woods, exquisite and subtle, to prepare for ceremony.

Seven, making incense, minerals, flower plates, and candle holders: gold, silver, copper, iron, jade, stone, tile, and wood, all according to one’s share, lacking nothing.

Eight, making beds and seats: felt, mats, cushions, all fresh and fine according to the season.

Nine, making scripture repositories: boxes, chests, and cases, painted, carved, gilded, and adorned; placing precious scriptures so they remain undefiled.

Ten, making scarves, handkerchiefs, and outer garments: silk, brocade, cotton, and gauze in three or five colors, all fragrant and clean, laid before seats.

Eleven, making tables, desks, scripture racks, and knee rests: sandalwood and fine wood, carved and embossed, each according to the time, for offering scriptures and images, and for monastics.

Twelve, making bells and chimes: gold, silver, copper, iron, jade, and stone; various sizes as needed; ringing day and night, drawing beings near, always filling the Dharma instruments, a perpetual field of merit.

Thirteen, making utensils: plates, bowls, alms bowls, basins, pots, and carved vessels; always for offerings and fasts, never lacking; merit beyond thought.

Fourteen, making benches, staffs, bathing implements, sitting cushions, fasting utensils, and handkerchiefs: supplied for monastics, an immeasurable field of merit.

Fifteen, making ritual robes: hats, crowns, shoes, clothes, bedding, ropes, and beds; giving to the monastic Dharma body in all directions.

These fifteen, for past and future, are towering merits.

Fourth is the merit of relief. This means kings and commoners, insects, fish, birds, and beasts in great peril and suffering, all should be supported and protected, creating fields of merit, ensuring peace and no distress. Their blessings are immeasurable and inconceivable.

Fifth is the merit of wisdom and kindness. This means constantly using wisdom and kindness to bring peace and joy to beings, so men and heavens all return to the good path, forever free from the hells of suffering, abiding long in the hall of bliss.

Because these are called merits, they are practiced tirelessly; their power pervades all.

From these five, sixteen vows are always made, greatly awakening good hearts.

One, for Heaven and Earth, may they endure eternally.

Two, for sun and moon, may their light shine universally.

Three, for stars, may they always follow their courses.

Four, for mountains and seas, may they guard springs and sources.

Five, for kings, may they long protect their lands.

Six, for ministers, may their positions and salaries be stable.

Seven, for the Nine Mysteries, may they be able to be born in the Pure Land.

Eight, for parents, may they forever preserve heavenly longevity.

Nine, for brothers, may they practice benevolence and filial piety.

Ten, for sisters, may they maintain purity and chastity.

Eleven, for kin, may all be harmonious and peaceful.

Twelve, for all under Heaven, may all be safe and tranquil.

Thirteen, for the Three Paths of suffering, may they be free from poison.

Fourteen, for all beings, may each be born accordingly.

Fifteen, for oneself, may one meet the scripture and Dao.

Sixteen, for the Dharma realm, may the Three Caverns circulate.

If one can always practice tirelessly, causing all to take refuge, past and future, one will surely ascend to the Pure Land.

The practices mean always purifying the three karmas, cleansing the six roots, practicing the Dao, reciting scriptures, observing fasts, bowing in worship, burning incense, making vows, confessing, lighting lamps, observing precepts, scattering flowers, releasing lives, not killing, not stealing, not committing sexual misconduct, not defiling, not hating, not flattering, not greedy, not desiring. Always for kings, queens, ministers, princes, dukes, marquises, governors, and all people under Heaven; for the Three Paths and Five Sufferings; for hungry ghosts and beasts; always building one hundred halls; summoning great virtuous Dharma masters and those wise and kind; explaining the thirty-six divisions of honored scriptures; revealing the supreme wondrous meaning; awakening all; tirelessly day and night; burning incense and scattering flowers; lighting lamps at night to assist heavenly light; digging wells by the Dao path; planting fruit and building houses; constructing bridges; saving the laboring and suffering; never ceasing even for a moment. This is called the daily practice.

The immortals bowed and asked: “Sentient beings are weak and unable to bear much. What essential methods exist to attain birth in the Pure Land?”

The Heavenly Sovereign said: “If good men and good women can merely make images of me, recite this scripture, worship day and night, and keep me in mind, they will surely be born there. If they follow previous practices, avoiding all evil and calming the world, they will ascend to Heaven in broad daylight.”

The immortals further asked: “Sentient beings are foolish and entangled in worldly affairs, unable to follow the Heavenly Sovereign’s commands. At the moment of death and after passing, what merits must be done to be born according to their vows?”

The Heavenly Sovereign said: “When men and women approach death, they should first repent all the countless heavy sins of their life. Next, observe precepts, hold fasts, practice the Dao, make images, copy scriptures, and perform various merits, giving to monasteries, supporting monastics, each according to their ability—the more, the better. On the day of closing their eyes, they will be born in the Pure Land, never entering the Three Paths of suffering.

If already deceased, one should establish records, clarify truth, and perform the fivefold refinement practices from the first day to the hundredth day. Make images, copy scriptures, light lamps, count days, worship day and night, recite scriptures, repent, burn incense, and scatter flowers.

Also, use clothing and bedding from life, vehicles, horses, servants, gold, silver, pearls, jade, silk, brocade, funds, and possessions, dividing into seventeen parts:

One part for giving, one for building spiritual temples, mysterious altars, pavilions, halls, towers, lodgings;

One for making images of heavenly sovereigns and holy true immortals;

One for copying scriptures and teachings;

One for accompanying monasteries;

One for supplying fasts;

One for supporting precept holders and mountain forest Dao practitioners;

One for supporting monastics, their food, drink, and medicines;

One for bells and chimes;

One for scattering flowers;

One for tents and seats;

One for incense and oil;

One for aiding prisoners;

One for giving to the poor, old, and sick;

One for releasing lives;

One for compassionate fields;

One for building bridges and roads;

One for unrestricted giving.

By such divided giving, one can attain birth in the Divine Pure Land, blessed and protected. All disasters and diseases are dispelled by creating fields of merit. This is the foremost inconceivable truth. Now I have explained to you the blessings of the Pure Lands of the Ten Directions. Men and women will be born there according to their vows.”

Golden countenance, jade-like appearance, noble and graceful, free from sorrow and grief.

Golden earth offerings, white jade steps, inner and outer brightness, pure and supreme.

When men and women approach death, they are born according to their vows.

The Heavenly Sovereign told the immortals: “Extreme sin and retribution, past fate and cause, all arise from sentient beings’ karmic connections. Like a mirror image, one sees forms according to one’s share—beauty or ugliness, short or long—never mistaken.

If one keeps precepts, observes fasts, practices the Dao, recites scriptures, makes vows, repents, makes images, copies scriptures, builds mysterious altars, cultivates spiritual temples, supports the Three Treasures, gives to the poor, releases lives, performs merits, always acts with reverence and faith, purifies the six roots, restrains desires, avoids evil, corrects the heart and mind, and is born according to vows, one will reach the Pure Land, joyful and effortless.

If one acts with false thoughts, steals and kills, acts wickedly and promiscuously, is stingy, greedy, angry, mad, foolish, speaks deceitfully, uses evil words and slander, curses and insults, disrespects the Three Treasures, destroys scriptures, disrespects monastics, commits the five heinous crimes, creates evil karma, disbelieves good causes, then at death one enters the nine dark hells, suffering torment, sinking for myriad kalpas.

Later reborn in defiled lands, with ugly form, short life, deafness, blindness, six diseases, enemies and foes, insects, beasts, tigers, wolves, thorns, poisonous weeds, shackles and chains, hunger, cold, distress, all manner of evil causes, hostile signs, bitterness, vexation, all afflicting body day and night, never joyful, cycling through birth and death endlessly, with no end in sight.

All this arises from sentient beings’ karmic connections.

Now I explain this cause and condition to you. You must diligently exhort men and women to cultivate the good Dao, be born in the Pure Land of the Divine Spirit, respond to vows and hearts, never erring.”

The immortals, hearing the Heavenly Sovereign speak of the Pure Lands of the Ten Directions, adorned with majestic borders, rejoiced and leapt with joy, all praising aloud, bowing their heads and withdrawing.
