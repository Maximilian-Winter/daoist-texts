## Preface to the Scripture of the Most High True Person of the Cavern Profundity Numinous Treasure, Inquiring into Illness

At such a time, the Numinous Radiance Treasure Heaven Venerable, in the world of the Benevolent Worthies of the Northern Dragon’s Mysterious Seat, beneath the Lofty Splendid Tree on Dragon Tooth Mountain, gathered with the great holy assemblies of the Ten Directions, numbering in the countless billions, all assembled at the dharma seat. They discoursed, expounded, debated, and probed deeply into the Great Vehicle scriptures, which number five thousand characters. From dawn till dusk, throughout the night, they savored the exquisite flavor together, yet it was never enough, never wearying, never tiring, never slackening. From all directions came those who had attained the dao, those who had attained the fruit of the dao, those who had not yet attained the fruit, and those who had already attained it—such multitudes were like grains of dust. Also present were the Four Heavenly Kings, the Brahma Qi Heavenly Kings, the various heavenly emperors and rulers, the countless kings of Kunlun from the Ten Directions, the thirty-two heavens of Brahma kings, ghosts and spirits, heavenly demon kings, mountain and sea gods, gods of the Sunny Valley, numbering in the countless billions. The beings of the Three Realms—human and non-human alike, those of blood and flesh—numbered in the countless billions. There were also the heterodox beings, numbering ninety-eight kinds, and their ghosts and spirits, again numbering countless billions. Furthermore, there were the Wheel-Turning Holy Kings, the Sun and Moon celestial sons, and the heavenly sons of the Ten Directions, numbering countless billions. Each sat upon their mounts or in their palaces, with wives and concubines, all gathered beneath the Lofty Splendid Tree to hear the Venerable speak the dharma. The meanings of the Great Vehicle scriptures are profound and difficult to fathom. Such multitudes of beings could not understand them. Though unable to grasp the meaning, their hearts rejoiced, forgetting all dust and filth, scattering fragrant flowers to offer to the Venerable, wishing to comprehend clearly.

The Venerable said: “I speak of the Great Vehicle scriptures and the matters of the Three Attainments, which are beyond ordinary understanding. Among the assembly are the ever-abiding high true ones, the past high true ones, and the present high true ones, numbering in the countless billions. Among them are eighty-six thousand disciples who clearly understand the Great Vehicle. Their names are: Primordial True Person, Heavenly Sovereign True Person, Supreme Ultimate True Person, High Sovereign True Person, Upper Sovereign True Person, Great One True Person, Great Peace True Person, Great Simplicity True Person, Great Beginning True Person, Bright Sovereign True Person, Long Night True Person, Correct One True Person, Fixed Light True Person, Luo Qiao True Person, Wonderful Sound True Person, Liu Luo True Person, Great Void True Person, Profound Mystery True Person, Wisdom Named True Person, Great Pervading True Person, Boundless True Person, Profound Silence True Person, Free True Person, Uniting Three Realms True Person, Great Strength True Person, Boundless Strength True Person, Auspicious True Person, Clear Understanding True Person, Wisdom True Person, Impermanence True Person, Teacher True Person, Evil Breaking True Person, Protector True Person. These true ones all clearly understand the Great Vehicle scriptures and dharma, having cultivated supreme deeds in former kalpas, thus residing in truth. Among the assembly are those with lesser kalpa bodies, numbering like grains of sand. In their former lives, they did not delight in the Great Vehicle dharma, thus they are bodies of lesser kalpa. Hearing the Great Vehicle scriptures, their hearts are also glad, but none dare to ask. Among the assembly, the fifth disciple, the Infinite Beginning True Person, arose and respectfully addressed the Venerable: ‘Now, many do not understand the Great Vehicle dharma and cannot grasp it. They are not yet able to bear it. Only by constant offering and with heartfelt aspiration after the fruit can they become unsurpassed true ones.’”

The Venerable said: “Now I speak the Great Vehicle dharma. You all understand it clearly. In later kalpas, beings will not be able to comprehend this path. I now raise my left hand, pointing to the fifth and sixth disciples, Infinite Beginning True Person and Fixed Light True Person. You two shall be teachers in the Worthy Kalpa. You shall be titled Infinite Beginning Heavenly Master and Fixed Light Heavenly Master. I also point to the seventh disciple, Correct One True Person, and the eighth disciple, Profound Mystery True Person. You shall guide the Three Vehicles dharma in the Turbid Kalpa. Correct One True Person shall be titled Three Heavens Dharma Master; Profound Mystery True Person shall be titled Six Perfections Dharma Master. These four disciples have repeatedly witnessed the scriptures of the past, present, and future kalpas, entering the subtle and profound, and through the grace of the great sovereigns and kings’ sons, have all guided the multitudes, saved the suffering in hell, transformed the great fortunes of the heavens, diligently applying their hearts so that in the midst of worthiness and turbidness, beings may know and understand my dharma path. I now divide my body and titles; their numbers reach hundreds of billions. This is because of my illness. ‘Yi’ is the first name, ‘Xi’ the second, ‘Wei’ the third—these are the heads of the Three Vehicles, the beginning of the Three Caverns. Their dispersal also forms countless scripture texts. The first kalpa is the Jade Purity Palace, where the Heavenly Treasure Sovereign is my first name; the second kalpa is the Purple Tenuity Palace, where the Numinous Treasure Sovereign is my second name; the last three kalpas are the Supreme Ultimate Palace, where the Divine Treasure Sovereign is my third name. It is said: In the coming kalpas, the first dwells in Jade Purity, the second disperses Numinous Treasure, the third controls demon spirits. ‘Numinous’ is my first title, the father of all things, able to complete all things. ‘Treasure’ is my second title, the mother of all things, able to give birth to all things’ children. Thus, the Numinous Treasure dharma is to save beings in the turbid world of later kalpas, clearly guiding them with this dharma, recording the text in the Void Sovereign. I also have ten names: one for the coming, two for the past, three for the present, four for the ever-abiding, five for guiding the world, six for compassion, seven for purity, eight for emptiness, nine for existence and non-existence, ten for Heaven and Earth. You all should know and reverently receive my words and remember these numbers.” Then all the true ones and all the true ones of the four directions, the heavenly sons, kings, ghosts, spirits, humans and non-humans, all rose and bowed, praising “Excellent! May we understand!”

At that time, Infinite Beginning True Person again asked: “The dharma just spoken is divided into countless parts, difficult to understand and grasp. The disciple wishes to know the nearer and smaller so that all beings may clearly understand. The Venerable often suffers various illnesses and wishes to explain them in detail: why there are these illnesses and pains, such unbearable sufferings, leading to death and transformation—death not ordinary death, transformation not ordinary transformation—such that even great saints do not escape. The disciple constantly worries and grieves, though not poisoned by sorrow, yet must have this suffering.” The Venerable smiled, and eight-colored light radiated from his mouth like dense clouds, then snapped his fingers and said to the assembly: “Never before has such a question been asked. Now there is this great disciple who can well inquire about the vexations of death and illness. Death is hard to know, easy to know. Now I will tell you the causes of illness and explain them. All quiet your hearts. My illnesses have arisen from kalpa to kalpa, like flowing sands countless entering countless, not enough to be many. I constantly worry and grieve because I have a body; having a body means illness.”

## Scripture of the Most High True Person of the Cavern Profundity Numinous Treasure, Inquiring into Illness

### Chapter One: Inquiry into Illness

Then the Venerable said: “In later generations, those who study the immortals, who wear the dharma robe outwardly but harbor yin evil within—this is my great illness; those who adorn themselves with splendid finery but lack sincere faith within—this is my great illness; those who do not constantly walk the dao and repent—this is my great illness; those who do not think of saving all beings—this is my great illness; those who are not compassionate to all—this is my great illness; those whose hearts are lax and retreat—this is my great illness; those who transmit the supreme dharma without regard for Heaven and Earth—this is my great illness; those who transmit scriptures without investigating ritual and form—this is my great illness; those who harm their bodies yet accept precepts—this is my great illness; those who fail tests by demons—this is my great illness; kings and ministers who are arrogant—this is my great illness; the rich and noble who disregard dao principles—this is my great illness; stinginess and greed—this is my great illness; killing and coveting flavors—this is my great illness; disharmony in the household, discord among kin—this is my great illness; unfilial to parents, unkind to wives and children—this is my great illness; failure to practice benevolence and righteousness—this is my great illness; destroying quiet abodes and fasting halls—this is my great illness; disbelief in the Three Treasures—this is my great illness; lack of fear of ghosts and spirits—this is my great illness; theft and robbery—this is my great illness; plotting against rulers—this is my great illness; disobedience to sovereigns and fathers—this is my great illness; sovereigns and fathers who are unrighteous—this is my great illness; disrespecting stars, sun, and moon—this is my great illness; unresolved evil roots from ancestors causing calamities and being blamed by enemies—this is my great illness; turning away from teachers’ grace and love—this is my great illness; deceiving righteous friends—this is my great illness; slighting teachers and neglecting friends—this is my great illness; mocking teachers as wrong—this is my great illness; not loving disciples—this is my great illness; not teaching or awakening disciples—this is my great illness; hiding truth and revealing falsehood—this is my great illness; craving sounds and colors—this is my great illness; abandoning dharma for falsehood—this is my great illness; craving the Lesser Vehicle—this is my great illness; delighting in heterodox paths—this is my great illness; serving and feeding evil spirits—this is my great illness; envying others’ abilities and self-praise—this is my great illness; not yielding virtue to others—this is my great illness; arrogant and boastful—this is my great illness; claiming to know what is unknown, claiming to understand what is not understood—this is my great illness; claiming to see what is unseen, deceiving and misleading the poor—this is my great illness; borrowing and not repaying—this is my great illness; lending with high interest—this is my great illness; using small measures to take large, light scales to give heavy—this is my great illness; foul speech and curses—this is my great illness; falsehood and lies—this is my great illness; excessive drinking—this is my great illness; excessive clothing and food—this is my great illness; eating blood, fish, and strong-smelling foods—this is my great illness; craving the five pungent spices—this is my great illness; entering, exiting, walking, lying down, and resting without arising compassion—this is my great illness; anger, forgiveness, resentment, and jealousy on fasting days—this is my great illness; killing on auspicious fasting days—this is my great illness; couples not following proper laws of yin and yang—this is my great illness; scolding wind and cursing rain—this is my great illness; mocking the poor and sick—this is my great illness; speaking of others’ gains and losses—this is my great illness; hating others’ success and failure—this is my great illness; polluting clear streams and roads—this is my great illness; killing and burying corpses—this is my great illness; cherishing wealth and refusing dharma to resolve ancestral sins and establish good causes—this is my great illness; harming fetuses and aborting children—this is my great illness; cutting down trees and fruit groves—this is my great illness; disbelief in fate—this is my great illness; claiming there are no ghosts and spirits in Heaven and Earth—this is my great illness; ignorance of giving alms to all—this is my great illness; stingy giving—this is my great illness; cursing and chasing away beggars—this is my great illness; hoarding clothes, treasures—this is my great illness; judging others’ good and evil lightly—this is my great illness; not helping the poor and hungry—this is my great illness; failing to transcend all death and decay—this is my great illness. I have these seventy-two illnesses, unable to escape through kalpas. Therefore, I transform form and scatter qi, divide spirit and body, to become the seventy-two saints. Among the saints are true ones; among the true ones are ranks; among ranks are chapters; among chapters are sentences; among sentences are words; among words is qi; among qi is form; among form is subtlety; among subtlety is fineness; among fineness is non-being; among non-being is being. This is called the subtle and wondrous. Among the wondrous, the upper qi is without qi yet forms the true body; the lower qi has qi and forms the fleshly body. Thus there is water, fire, wind, and earth, combining to form the four great bodies. My great illness is due to having the four great elements. Without these, what illness would there be? I truly have no four great elements, so what great illness? To know my body is to be my body; not to know my body is not my body. Knowing my body means long existence; not knowing means premature decay, pain and poison in hell, long wandering in the Five Paths, revolving endlessly. Therefore, I transform thus. Without great deeds, none can seize it. The method of seizing is as I have spoken and heard. My death’s suffering is due to old age and illness. Birth necessarily has death; flourishing necessarily has decline. Humans and things are one; there is no birth without an end. Things are born in spring, grow in summer, wither in autumn, and decline in winter. Success has failure; height has danger; peace has sorrow; joy is little, suffering is much. Who can truly know? The dead suffer torment; spirit and consciousness are hard to transform; sinking and accumulating through the night, bitter indeed. Even the heavens, though joyful, long worry about impermanence. Spirits dispersed, four great elements hard to reunite, so the dwelling is hard to return. I have this suffering, but it is not truly my suffering. My death is not death; my birth is not birth; my aging is not aging. Alas, suffering exists; those who have it are not my body; those who do not have it are my body. It is said: ‘I die,’ it is said: ‘I live.’ Birth and death are opposites; I am free from them. Those not free are all beings.” The assembly, both awakened and unawakened, wished to understand in that moment and rose, bowing and praising “Excellent!”

The Venerable said: “Those who cultivate the Great Vehicle to untie bonds must always fast and purify, wear the talisman of the Three Caverns, carry the register of the Three Caverns, and follow the dharma to walk the dao and turn the scriptures tirelessly through the six times of day. The reason for the six times is that humans receive the four great elements born of the six emotions. If the six emotions do not depart, there must be sources of sin. At one time cleanse the eyes; at two times cleanse the nose; at three times cleanse the mouth; at four times cleanse the ears; at five times cleanse the heart; at six times cleanse the hands. If one can do this day and night, the six emotions naturally vanish, the six wisdoms become unobstructed, and practicing the six perfections leaves no hindrance. Spiritual powers and all demons become free and complete; one lives long and sees far, without suffering, poison, or vexation. The lamp is the light illuminating the palace of the long night, to resolve the darkness of seven generations of parents and all parents under Heaven. Burning incense removes the foul stench in the Three Realms, making hell fragrant and pure again. Like the fragrant herb apple, also called ghost medicine or coix, within four hundred li it constantly spreads fragrance to incense all beings of the Three Realms, transforming their qi. Illnesses are soothed by sandalwood, aloeswood, and other incense. Hell becomes fragrant and pure again; souls and spirits are transformed; beings are revived; the world rejoices; the six emotions are extinguished; the five constants cease. When the five constants cease, one can repay the five virtues: one, parents; two, teachers and disciples; three, masters; four, kings and sovereign fathers; five, the people’s parents. Love and care between teachers and disciples, concern for masters, offerings to kings, comforting and cherishing the poor and lonely—this is called the five virtues. The numbers clarify this; clarifying is self-knowledge. The words are as spoken, not false or vain, but true speech. Beings can know and learn. Reflect deeply, reflect deeply.”

This is the spiritual power gained through observing precepts.

The Venerable said: “Those who receive the four great elements’ body and can follow the dharma to observe precepts see that in this present life all bodies gain spiritual power, though not yet attaining true dao. Let their spirits be swift; from here they advance in study, gradually entering subtlety. From one to three, the time of fruition is the path of long vision. Though far from the three evils, there is no vexation or poison. When the six are all perfected, one unites with the One Spirit, and together they soar to the Upper Purity.”

If their intention and practice are thus, the fruit will surely come, planting one seed to reap ten thousand, like rice in the fields. Strive on your own, do not harbor doubt, lest you lose your cause and fall into the long night, revolving through the Five Paths. This understanding is difficult.

### Chapter Nine: Beings’ Merit and Retribution from Former Kalpas

The Venerable said: “In former kalpas, beings who studied the unsurpassed dao and offered to the Three Treasures had long attained true dao; those who recited the Cavern scriptures had long attained true dao; those who practiced fasting and purification had long attained true dao; those who swallowed essence and swallowed qi had long attained true dao; those who took medicine and practiced guiding and breathing had long attained true dao; those who kept the eight rhythms in the Five Mountains and Three Rivers had long attained true dao; those who offered clothing to dharma masters had long attained true dao; those who encouraged and assisted incense offerings to the poor had long attained true dao; those who made vows and rejoiced in the Great Vehicle had long attained true dao; those who gave alms and released life had long attained true dao; those who helped build pure chambers and quiet rooms had long attained true dao; those who planted orchards to offer to dharma masters’ halls had long attained true dao; those who helped others recite scriptures had long attained true dao; those who helped others organize fasting and transportation had long attained true dao; those who observed, listened, walked the dao, repented, and developed faith and understanding had long attained true dao; those who had faith and chanted ‘Excellent!’ had long attained true dao; those who examined themselves and feared and respected the dharma had long attained true dao; those who entered, exited, lay down, sat up, and always practiced compassion had long attained true dao; those who released life and saved the dying had long attained true dao; those who did not envy others’ learning had long attained true dao; those who always praised goodness had long attained true dao; those who did not think of killing had long attained true dao; those who gave to beggars and the poor had long attained true dao; those who rescued the distressed and pitiful had long attained true dao; those who lit lamps at night had long attained true dao; those who clearly protected the dharma had long attained true dao. With such merits, many true ones attained the dao in former kalpas. Briefly speaking of these matters, all are recorded on golden tablets and jade slips, all due to causes and conditions from former kalpas.”

### Chapter Ten: The Parable of Virtue’s Covering

The Venerable said: “I am the father and mother of all beings, pitying and loving you, compassionate to all, covering and nurturing all, moistening all. All things receive me as fish receive the abyss, as children receive their mother, as the hungry receive food, as the thirsty receive drink, as the sick receive medicine, as the people receive their king, as the fearful receive refuge, as the drowning receive a boat, as the poor receive treasure, as the punished receive pardon, as the lost receive revival, as the ruined receive completion. My dharma universally saves beings like great clouds filling the sky, spreading fine rain, none escaping its moisture. Do beings know me? I create you, give you life, nourish you, nurture you, grow you, pity you. Why do you not know compassion to repay my grace and practice good deeds? Yet seeing my scriptures and dharma without repentance or cause, you rush to evil paths, sinking into hell—painful and lamentable. Clearly cultivate and strive to remove the root of sin, and the fruit will be long-lasting joy, as I have spoken.”

### Chapter Eleven: Beings’ Original Actions Leading to Unwholesome Retribution

In former lives, killing people and exterminating clans leads now to no descendants;  
Killing children and harming fetuses leads now to many children dying young, becoming children of enemies;  
Hating others’ loss leads now to constant hardship;  
Hating others’ gain leads now to constant slander;  
Mocking the poor leads now to this calamity;  
Stealing and robbing, and unrighteous wealth leading the poor astray, and lending without repayment leads now to being born as oxen, always bearing heavy burdens, only thinking of water and grass;  
Lending debts seeking tenfold repayment leads now to constant suffering and poverty;  
Hating others’ diseases leads now to these illnesses;  
Jealous of others’ wisdom leads now to dullness and darkness;  
Wearing shoes in quiet halls leads now to broken feet and endless suffering, difficulty walking;  
Stealing at night leads now to blindness, also hating the blind;  
Living in rich houses eating alone, borrowing without communication, not caring for emergencies, lacking benevolence and righteousness, despising the poor, leads now to being born in barbarian lands, not human kind;  
Not hearing or listening, hating the deaf and mute leads now to this illness;  
Lustful with relatives leads now to donkey and horse bodies;  
Killing blood-bearing creatures and coveting their flesh leads now to being born as six domestic animals and wild beasts, harmed by humans to repay former grievances;  
Killing and burying corpses leads now to the form of those killed;  
Killing sons-in-law leads now to having no sons-in-law;  
Killing women leads now to having no women;  
Hating others’ success leads now to constant calamity;  
Being hot-tempered and ignorant leads now to not knowing learning;  
Being officials and envying and slandering leads now to being slandered and harmed;  
Feeding evil spirits leads now to constant insufficiency and worldly ruin;  
Cursing and abusing leads now to being hated and despised, born as dogs and wolves;  
Drinking excessively and committing evil leads now to twisted nature;  
Being unfilial to parents leads now to being born to unfilial children;  
Being unkind to brothers, wives, and children leads now to family discord, constant fighting, and being mocked;  
Wishing others to be one’s slaves leads now to being slaves.  

There are many such causes. Now briefly speak one to awaken understanding. Beings should not make such wishes or acts. Good and evil retribution is firmly established by faith. Without these causes, all are born human with the four great elements alike, yet differ in wisdom and foolishness; differ in talent; differ in nobility and poverty; differ in clarity and obscurity; differ in complete or incomplete six emotions; differ in speaking or not speaking; differ in being respected or not; differ in honoring rites or not. Such are briefly spoken of.

### Chapter Twelve: Beings’ Actions Leading to Wholesome Retribution

Being rich in the world comes from giving in former lives;  
Being kings comes from offering to the Three Treasures in former lives;  
Being dharma masters who skillfully guide comes from thinking of the Great Vehicle in former lives;  
Being intelligent and wise comes from revering and studying scriptures in former lives;  
Being feared and respected comes from careful observance of the Three Treasures in former lives;  
Having sufficient clothing and food comes from helping the poor in former lives;  
Being officials and noble comes from not harming living things in former lives;  
Having complete six emotions comes from not destroying the Three Treasures in former lives;  
Speaking correctly comes from teaching the Great Vehicle scriptures in former lives;  
Being relied upon by all comes from caring for all in former lives;  
Being honored and offered good seats comes from practicing good deeds and wishing others to succeed in former lives.  

Such retributions are many. Now briefly explain the principle. Causes and conditions are many. The roots of good and evil bear fruit like the sun and moon’s light, the ocean’s waves, the turning of the four seasons, the movement of the Five Phases, the wheels of a cart. Beings, do you know? Do you awaken? Do you understand? Do you realize? Do you practice? Do you believe? Do you take care? Can you accept? Now I clearly speak of good and evil. All the assembly rejoiced, bowed, and praised “Excellent! May we understand!”

Infinite Beginning True Person said: “What the Venerable has spoken is of utmost subtlety, enough to turn beings’ hearts. Among the chapters are countless millions. Beings cannot fully understand. Only dao and dao correspond; only true and true correspond; only non-being and non-being correspond. I have been titled the Infinite Beginning Heavenly Master in the later kalpas, to guide the Most High Great Vehicle dharma. From now on, among the assembly many have not awakened to this truth; their number is also great.”

The Venerable’s kalpa body is like the Sunny Valley Palace, with a Water Spirit Terrace, eighty thousand li in circumference and height. Within is golden sand, grains as large as mustard seeds, filling it. Once every ten thousand years one grain dissolves, and so on until all dissolve. This is the Venerable’s small kalpa body, like the north having one hundred and eighty Kunlun mountains governing thirty-eight thousand worlds, with mountains, hills, tiles, earth, forests, all turning to fine dust at once. If scattered in the great void, their number is like the Venerable’s body. One great kalpa cycle, beings do not awaken or believe. Among the assembly are the four groups’ Lesser Vehicle bodies, small kalpa bodies, heavenly sons, heavenly kings, heavenly emperors, also unaware and unhearing. Now speaking of this, all have doubts, let alone the turbid world’s beings who harbor doubts. Therefore, I speak to clarify. Believing is difficult; knowing is difficult; awakening is difficult; receiving is difficult; encountering is difficult; seeing is difficult; serving is difficult. This is the difficulty of my body. Though I am a teacher, even I find it difficult to make it easy. Truly difficult, there is no difficulty.

Infinite Beginning True Person said: “The five thousand characters are the spirits of the five bodies of the Numinous Radiance Treasure Heaven Venerable. The spirit is also Laozi, who decreed five hundred. Laozi gathered this meaning. ‘Numinous’ is the father of beings; ‘Treasure’ is the mother of beings; ‘Radiance’ is the sun’s light, illuminating all; ‘Treasure’ is containment, from which all things are born. I have also studied this scripture.”

The Venerable gazed upon the countless worlds within countless Sumerus, seeing good and evil, learning and not learning, humans and non-humans, one-legged, two-legged, four-legged, many-legged, turbid births, moist births, egg births, fetal births, spontaneous births—such evils all arise before his eyes, just a few inches from his eyes. Beings say they do not know or see, do not see their true parents, or say the true saints are high and distant, or say there are no spirits. Those who can be filial to parents have numinous qi descend; those who are unfilial receive calamity. Fetal birth depends on parents’ causes and conditions; this meaning is supreme. Who can know? Studying the Great Vehicle is the cause. Only wishing to be born is not the supreme wish. Those who attain the dao and whose merit is insufficient should again revolve and be reborn, with blessings never ceasing. Later births are always noble, wealthy, and virtuous, respected by people, with auspicious appearances, moved by good spirits, meeting bright teachers, buried in auspicious mountains, marrying good women, going out to food and salary, with evil spirits unable to interfere. Those who do not delight in the Three Treasures, do not believe in holy words, speak evil and curses, do evil deeds, are born lowly; those who meet dark teachers, are buried in inauspicious mountains, marry coarse women, lose wealth when going out, face corrupt officials, have no blessings from good spirits, and are led by evil spirits—all due to former causes and karmic fate, each governed by their star lord—good ones belong to good stars, evil ones to evil stars. Birth and death have opposites, very clear distinctions. Without the Great Vehicle’s salvation, none can escape. Beings know this or not, yet revere heterodox teachings and various scriptures. This confusion is lamentable and deep. There are one hundred and ninety-eight kinds of paths, all part of the Venerable’s body. Therefore, in the worlds of the Ten Directions, beings’ hearts and conduct differ. Not knowing ghosts and spirits, evil is used to transform evil by skillful means to guide them; good is encouraged to awaken them, following their original hearts, gradually letting them know and awaken to the supreme dao. To be correct is to have no inside or outside, no surface or wrapping, no refined or coarse, no two or three, no ten or hundred. To seek it is by practice, seeking from the heart, the principle of light and dark, very subtle. Beings see and do not see, always as if seeing; fear and not fear, always as if fearing; cautious and not cautious, always as if cautious; act and not act, always as if acting; accept and not accept, always as if accepting; love and not love, always as if loving; cultivate and not cultivate, always as if cultivating. One must make these three hundred and sixty accords, true and not true, one and not one, as I have explained.”

This scripture is spoken by the Venerable’s golden mouth; it must not be lightly disparaged. Lightness brings punishment; reverence brings blessing and pardon. Those who aspire to the Great Vehicle must delight in offering, reading, and reciting, pondering deeply this meaning, to resolve present sins, extinguish former evils, release the calamities of the nine ancestors, and save all suffering. In the future, seeking the dao, making spirit pure and correct, with ghosts and spirits supporting, demon kings revering, bring gold and treasures, sincerely fast a thousand days, then receive it.

Infinite Beginning True Person said: “I receive non-action from the breath of all things. At the beginning, this is the condensation of all things’ essence and qi. The principle of birth and death is my body. One name is Dragon Tooth Mountain; two, Dragon Body; three, Dragon Liver; four, Phoenix Cry; five, Lion Head; six, Small Kalpa; seven, Ever-Abiding; eight, Present; nine, Coming; ten, Past. This mountain is eighty billion li in circumference; beneath the Lofty Splendid Tree is four hundred billion li in circumference. The high saints and true ones descend once per kalpa to this mountain and speak the Great Vehicle scriptures, gathering the multitudes.”

At that time, the Venerable spoke various dharmas, each knowing for themselves, awakening to the words and their kinds, without error or confusion, like kings of birds and moths, all with one understanding. It began at this mountain, which is an altar of gold, steps of silver, trees of seven treasures, auspicious clouds as flowers, where dragons, phoenixes, and heavenly beasts rest. Among the multitudes are those never before seen or met.

The Venerable opened the great pardon and showed the mountain’s form, also the cause of former lives. Those who study diligently cultivate the Great Vehicle dharma and after fruition will meet this mountain. This mountain also has seven treasure palaces and natural music and dance. This country has no spring, autumn, winter, or summer; yin and yang climates naturally persist. The Great Vehicle scripture is one ear, scattered into countless billions, beyond the dragon chariot’s carrying capacity, beyond the eastern well’s measure. One is the five thousand characters; it is emptiness, void, non-being, being, Heaven, Earth, and all things. The ever-abiding high true ones of the Ten Directions all contemplate it without weariness. Its one character is the Venerable’s inner name, constantly shown to the world, but beings do not awaken. In later generations, those who attain the dao fruit and the worthy sages, wise Confucians, and scholars will contemplate this meaning, or use it as an external teaching or empty talk, which is also good. This scripture is the great saint’s body, internally drawing qi and spirit, externally spreading wondrous meaning, no one can fully fathom. In former kalpas, beings contemplated this path, each believing the words; their meaning has now dissipated. Speech is reason and unreason, gain and loss, knowing the path and not knowing the path. I can also accept it, not blaming others, following the people’s hearts. It is said: ‘Taking the people’s heart as one’s own heart.’”

Infinite Beginning True Person said: “The Daoist method of governing the body is like the sands of the Ganges, inexhaustible to learn, only requiring holding to one. Wearing talismans and Daoist guides, practicing breathing and concealment, if the former功 is not full, one cannot succeed. One can diligently offer this scripture, bow, pray, read, recite, study, with good heart and faith, without doubt, laxity, or weariness, renewing intention daily, and one can also achieve flying and riding the dragon chariot, joining the Nine Ancestors’ wheel. Think well. This scripture is the five thousand characters.”

Primordial True Person diligently chants, saying:

“Wondrous indeed is the unsurpassed dao, the dao true in five thousand characters.  
Emptiness has no root nor trace; traces scatter like clouds.  
Divisions are hard to fathom; three and one combine the emperor sovereign.  
The Three Vehicles have no two; the Void Sovereign spreads and guides.  
Beings are full of doubt; speaking dharma awakens and transmits.  
Resolving root evil and bondage, departing old age, illness, and vexation.  
Long life dwelling and long vision, fruits riding the scenic clouds.  
Carefree in the Great Void, high saints gather.  
Countless kalpas from dawn till dusk, never worry or grudge.  
Look upon later students, lax and not devoted,  
Jealous and equal, how can they ascend the chariot?  
Sinking into the nine nights below, testing your soul,  
Revolving through the three paths, good causes no longer heard.”

Infinite Beginning True Person said: “In former kalpas, people studied the path of the upper immortals and long life, the method of not dying, not thinking of the world. Dwelling in the world brings many thoughts; many thoughts bring worry; worry burdens the heart; burdened hearts forget the dao. Having wives and children brings worry for them; having wealth brings worry for wealth; having illness brings worry for illness; having death and mourning brings worry for death and mourning; having poverty brings worry for poverty. Such actions do not escape death’s pain or accord with long life. One who has a body does not know worry; not knowing worry means the dao and dharma endure. Later generations are confused, only knowing to cherish the body and life, not knowing to protect and cherish the spirit. The form is the house of the four great elements; how can the house last long? When the person leaves, the house does not stand. The spirit scatters; the spirit’s revolving wheel does not perish or cease. Foolish people build vast tombs and great coffins, killing and burying, thinking this is filial and kind, not knowing the long night’s opposition. How bewildering, how bewildering! Those unwilling to be the Most High Guest rush to be kings and commoners; this is called suffering. Saints have disciples who are not their children but are blessed by former people to bear their holy name. Saints have no seed learners; one must understand this fully. In former kalpas,功 was not full; studying the upper dao and immortal ranks was insufficient to extinguish and transcend. The body passed through the Great Yin. Disciples requested dharma masters and righteous friends and relatives to perform three sevens of fasting, turning the five thousand characters ten times to rescue their souls and spirits. Those who study the upper dao seek swift turning of the wheel, not needing long life. Ordinary foolish people cherish life but have not awakened. Not awakened, there is crying; crying means seeing the body’s illness. Pitiful are the people’s successes and failures, long and short, with crying. Therefore, the three sevens of fasting: one seven for the Water Official to remove sins; two sevens for the Earth Official to resolve faults; three sevens for the Three Realms to save lives, leaving hell’s suffering, no more opposition, thus gaining swift transformation. Completing three sevens, organizing dharma is good; if not, some days’ fasting is also good. Diligently practicing the six times, those who pass away first. All beings are faith; offering to dharma masters and the Three Treasures, think well. This is wondrous and is the confusion of all later people. In life, not knowing to do good, establishing fields of merit; in death, all clothing, treasures, and precious objects buried in coffins and tombs add to the deceased’s torment, not knowing to open the way to save the dead and ferry them across. Those alive who cannot bear this, each summer and winter, one passage is enough, no need to long forget the beings’ reality. Think clearly on my words.”

Infinite Beginning True Person said: “In the coming age, beings’ hearts are coarse and evil, not awakening to good causes. Not as in this life’s simplicity, there will be later wise ones to teach dharma rules and rites. The principle of causes and conditions is the meaning of father, mother, brothers, uncles, aunts, and six kinship relations, with mourning and mourning rites. This is for all ordinary people, not for those studying the upper dao. When parents and below pass away, each time one generates a mind of merit, wishing to transform and be born with their true parents before, no longer revolving in birth and death, no longer worshipping spirits, increasing loss of the path of mourning. It is said: ‘And disorder is the head.’ Think well.”

Infinite Beginning True Person said: “Later students most avoid improper greed, unjustly suppressing human reason and forcibly enriching themselves, causing resentment and blame, calling on ghosts and spirits. Though receiving scriptures, dharma robes, talismans, guiding breathing, fasting, walking the dao, taking spirit medicines, and diet, they only labor their bodies outwardly. Immortals are not moved, but are tested and quickly fail. They cannot be extravagant in trivial matters. Holding this study of the dao, it is said: seeking worldly competition is not true. Seeing the world killed by evil ghosts without awareness, at death thus, spirit sinks and falls to hell, suffering opposition. My words are hard to understand. The practitioner’s mind enters insects and ants, also harmonizes with six domestic animals, birds and beasts, ghosts and spirits, likes and dislikes of people, forests and trees, and all things, sharing goodness in conduct, without slightest vexation or blame. Thus one can be supported by ghosts and spirits, upheld by the Three Realms, naturally becoming true.”

Infinite Beginning True Person said: “The Venerable and I observe the not yet and the past present matters, clear as if in my heart.”

At that time, the Venerable emitted purple hair light from his forehead, illuminating the ten directions, countless Kunlun mountains, thirty-six thousand great thousand worlds. Among them, all beings, good and evil, learning and not learning, human and non-human, one-legged, two-legged, four-legged, many-legged, turbid births, moist births, egg births, fetal births, spontaneous births, all arise before his eyes, just a few inches from his eyes. The light was golden, containing hundreds of thousands of sounds. Beings joyfully heard. From the light they sought and unknowingly arrived beneath the Lofty Splendid Tree, all good receiving and hearing the dharma’s root causes. This is the Venerable’s metaphor for all great mighty spirits. Once per kalpa encounter only. It is fitting to supervise later students, to cultivate well.

The Venerable has great mighty spiritual power to aid all beings. Thus, it is like in the Three Realms, formless yet with great voice and great power, grasping but unattainable, like the sun, moon, and stars in the void, dwelling mysteriously without attachment, down to nature, revolving in the human body likewise. Therefore, qi communicates spiritual power. Thus the person preserves truth; truth preserves the person; people revere gods; gods revere people; people love spirits; spirits love people; people forget qi; qi forgets people; people ignore dao; dao ignores people. Hence it is said: with good causes, from clarity to clarity, from seeing to seeing, from understanding to understanding, from joy to joy. Without good causes, only passing to passing, from darkness to darkness, from suffering to suffering. This is beings’ root. In later kalpas, those who can believe, act, serve, cultivate, are good and diligent, will be dharma masters, skillfully speaking my words, becoming teachers, urging all to enter the dharma gate, practice fasting, recite scriptures, repent, and pray to free the bonds of birth and death. Their rituals are many and detailed, to be used by later sages’ compilations. Establish功 and vows, from one to ten, from hundred to thousand, from thousand to ten thousand. Gather treasures and offerings to the fasting officials, divided into three parts: one part to offer to the Numinous Treasure Three Masters; two parts to offer to the Most True High Saints; three parts to offer to good causes. The principle of fruit and retribution is like being and non-being; from non-being comes truth; from this it is done.”

The true ones say the three parts are: one for fasting officials, one for offering to dharma masters, one for offering to transmission masters and ancestral masters every one or three years. If the two masters are absent, hand over to the register master, transmitting according to the Three Heavens dharma. Thus it is.

The title of true person has ritual form. Leaving the upper dao is still distant. This is spiritual power and freedom, no longer declining, commanding ghosts and spirits, yet still active, diligently accomplishing great功, entering subtlety through kalpas, gradually attaining the upper dao. Those with such qualities correspond. Those who studied the dao in former kalpas and became true ones are not easily sought; wishing to be born is the cause. Attached to the dark and obscure, naturally not forgetting, suddenly lax and tested, falling again into the Five Paths, no return. Clearly understand my words. I receive the Venerable’s teaching and decree. In later kalpas, I am the parent of beings, teaching children the cause of birth and growth, avoiding evil people. Carefully and thoroughly heed my words.

The kalpa of guidance and response opens only when the Heavenly Master appears. It is one. It is not produced by saints or sages. Scriptures and precepts have no great or small, no before or after, no high or low, all are one. Those with rank and form have their own roles, for beings’ sake. Not two, not three, like my body. Scholars who can understand this well, the ancient Jade Capital standard, Jade Purity thirty-one scrolls, Purple Tenuity thirty-six scrolls, Supreme Ultimate three scrolls, each with their ranks and sections, having covenants to serve as body treasures, preserving their qi. Death arises from within, not from without. Since it arises within, the outside responds. Response brings great calamity. The inside remains unmoving and unshining, serene and peaceful. It is said: ‘Silent spirit, spirit dwells by itself.’ Therefore, it is said that upper learning is non-action; non-action governs qi. Lower learning is action; action brings body and mind labor; labor breaks old bonds and scatters; gradually reaching qi governance, not silent spirit. When sins are eliminated, spirit is naturally calm; spirit calm means long vision.功 not yet full, silent spirit also not established. One must labor the body and suffer, saving all things, never weary of suffering. When kings have disasters, recite this scripture; when sovereign fathers are uneasy, recite this scripture; when epidemics spread, recite this scripture; when people die of illness, recite this scripture; when sun and moon lose their light, recite this scripture; when stars err in their courses, recite this scripture; when kalpa cycles end, recite this scripture; when wind and rain are untimely, recite this scripture; when teachers and friends are ill, recite this scripture; when households perish, recite this scripture; when grains fail to mature, recite this scripture; when thieves and robbers abound, recite this scripture; when beings curse each other, recite this scripture; when study declines and is unstable, recite this scripture; when there is cursing, anger, and resentment, recite this scripture; on heavenly fasting days, recite this scripture. Practicing fasting and reciting scriptures, the sound penetrates the Great Void, the echo descends, becoming Brahma sounds, subtle and wondrous, responding to all saints, demon kings revering, true ones praising, with功 like the heavens’ true virtue, gradually entering divine concentration. The body has thirty-two marks, naturally complete: blue hair grows, neck shines purple light, eyebrows shaped like moons, ears listen mysteriously, eyes bright and clear, nose cold and clear, mouth square and round, teeth moist and strong, white as silver, forty in number, fine and even, tongue moist with spring, drawing moon essence, palace of saliva, throat high and strong, pillars firm, hands soft and grasping, embracing inside and outside, feet strong, stepping the void, heart upright and peaceful, controlling demon kings, liver shining bright, entering Mount Tai, lungs pure qi, wearing floral shade, kidneys issuing power, observing Mount Heng, spleen receiving qi, misty Mount Song high, gallbladder sound of might, shaking spirit’s voice, chanting penetrating subtlety, entering the inescapable. All these are attained by study, not by nature.”
