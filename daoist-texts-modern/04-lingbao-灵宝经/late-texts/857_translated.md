## The Sublime Profound Numinous Treasure Scripture of the Ten Titles: Merits and Causes — A Marvelous Scripture

The Most High Great Dao Lord, together with the Five Elders Sovereigns, the Boundless Flying Celestial Great Sage, the Supreme High Perfected, the Ten Ultimate Perfected, the Left Profound Perfected, the Right Profound Perfected, the Marvelous Conduct Perfected, the Universal Aid Perfected, the Life-bestowing Perfected, the Calamity-relieving Perfected, the Great Compassionate and Great Merciful Perfected, the Great Compassionate and Great Wise Perfected, the Orthodox One Sovereign, the various Great Heavenly Masters, the Vajra Divine Kings, the Mighty Warriors, the Heavenly Dragons, the Ghost Spirits, and others—within the forsaken world of the unworthy—by their divine powers suddenly transformed countless crimson jade thrones, radiant and crystal-clear, upon which the assembly of True Sages and Saints took their places.

At that moment, the Dao Lord ascended the throne of the Seven Treasures Lion. This throne was adorned with a splendid array of treasures: lapis lazuli, true pearls, fire pearls, bright moon pearls, coral, amber, red jade, white jade, turquoise, green jade, yellow jade, glass, gold, purple gold, blue fire gold, and fragrant sandalwood—ornaments of utmost splendor. Upon this throne naturally blossomed a hundred-petaled lotus of precious jewels, with layers upon layers of petals, each petal revealing pure lands from the Ten Directions, all perfectly complete.

Within the assembly stood a great forest of seven treasures, its delicate leaves intertwined densely, exuding a rich fragrance, vast and immeasurable in height. When stirred by the breeze, it emitted harmonious and elegant sounds, subtle and wondrous. Within it, celestial transformations naturally took flight, manifesting various heavenly melodies that played without drum or string.

Then the Dao Lord, seated upon the lotus platform, arranged his posture precisely, spreading from his body five-colored radiance that illuminated boundless heavenly realms. The sacred assembly floated in the void, circling and weaving, singing praises and hymns. At once, heavenly rains of fragrant flowers fell: wondrous true flowers, small wondrous true flowers, red-golden flame flowers, purple-golden flame flowers, phoenix-headed fire flowers, and fragrant fire flowers.

Marvelous garments, precious fruits, white cranes, phoenixes, auspicious parrots, azure luan birds, peacocks, great benevolent golden birds, radiant golden birds, golden birds that speak human words, and golden birds of joyful music—all bore strange flowers in their beaks and flew about the assembly.

There appeared the immortals of the Ten Directions: flying immortals, heavenly immortals, earthly immortals, water immortals, fire immortals; the immortals of the Five Sacred Mountains; and all the great immortals of the various great and small grotto heavens. Each held talismans and staffs, banners, canopies, and precious standards, singing praises, chanting spiritual verses, and playing magnificent music in homage to the Dao Lord.

At that moment, the great earth trembled. The assembly looked among themselves, marveling at the unfathomable wonders. A certain Perfected named Universal Aid stepped forth from the crowd, tidied his robe and sash, and with calm and graceful steps approached the Dao Lord. Bowing deeply, he spoke:

“Your servant is ignorant and unworthy, unable to fathom by what dao-fruit the Dao Lord cultivates, yet it is evident that you possess divine freedom and power, no different from the Primordial Heavenly Venerable. Humbly I beseech your compassion upon me, upon future generations of sentient beings, and upon the pitiful later disciples of the dao, to expound this principle, so that they may awaken to the profound essential dharma and ascend the supreme dao, attaining the fruit difficult to imagine. Your servant is fortunate indeed.”

Hearing Universal Aid’s words, the Dao Lord sighed and said, “Excellent, excellent! You possess innate great wisdom, able to uplift and restrain the beings of the future turbid kalpa with subtle methods. You must keep this in mind, for I shall tell you the causes and effects. For countless kalpas I have contemplated the ten titles and merits of my original teacher, the Primordial Heavenly Venerable, praising, chanting, inscribing, and imagining him. I have worshiped, offered, and reverently respected him, giving countless pearls and gold without stinginess or hesitation. To this day, not once have I been negligent, and thus these merits have been completed.”

Universal Aid again addressed the Dao Lord, “I have yet to hear the ten titles of the Primordial Great Sage Heavenly Venerable. May your servant and the assembled multitude hear them? I wish to join the true immortals in praising and chanting them.” Having spoken, he bowed his head with tears, gazing upward at the Dao Lord. The entire assembly silently reflected, looking up at the true visage, earnestly hoping for the teaching.

The Dao Lord smiled gently and said to Universal Aid, “You may listen attentively and thereby attain the fruit of the supreme dao.” Then the Dao Lord continued, “My original teacher, the Great Sage Primordial Heavenly Venerable, is the void and nature itself, the wondrous dao incarnate. From the dust and sand kalpas beyond naming, he has saved all beings, guiding them into the supreme dao. He possesses seventy-two marks, eighty-one excellences, and the ten titles perfected and complete. Sometimes he manifests a thousand light forms, sometimes boundless forms, sometimes a great body, sometimes a small body, sometimes transforming into a grain of millet. Sometimes he opens his pores to receive boundless worlds; sometimes he holds the three thousand great thousand worlds in his palm; sometimes he rains sweet dew to soothe tormented beings; sometimes he appears as an emperor to quell rebellion; sometimes as a sage minister to uphold the dao; sometimes as a holy lord descending as a teacher. Such are his merits, divine powers, and wondrous forms, beyond all praise, summarized in ten titles. Therefore, the ten titles are: Supreme Dao, Primordial, Great Ultimate, High Sovereign, Radiance, Jade Emperor, King of Orthodox Dharma, Great Compassionate Father, Immortal True Master, and Heavenly Venerable.”

Universal Aid further said, “Though I have heard of the ten titles and merits, I have not yet understood their explanations, so that I and the great assembly, and even the beings of the future turbid kalpa, might fully comprehend the utmost true dharma essentials. Humbly I beg your compassion to instruct me, to proclaim one by one the subtle merits and wondrous characteristics of the ten titles. Your servant would be most fortunate.”

The Dao Lord replied to Universal Aid, “The ten titles you speak of are those of the true sacred assembly of heavenly beings and celestial sovereigns. They open the hundred-treasure casket within the white jade palace of the Red Bright and Harmonious Yang Heaven, the wind brocade pavilion, translating the great Brahman’s secret language into correct speech. The title Supreme Dao refers to the moment when the Primordial Heavenly Venerable’s dao-fruit was perfected. Among all dharmas, there is no ancestor, no lineage, no root, no connection—yet a form suddenly arises, upon which all dharmas rely. He is the king of all dharmas, the ancestor of all forms, the origin of the One Qi, the immeasurable void beyond reckoning, dwelling before all beings. Hence he is called Supreme Dao.

Primordial dwells at the source of the ultimate dao, the profound origin, thus named Primordial. Great Ultimate, from countless kalpas, separated the crude from the subtle, and his reward body appeared; thus he first manifested in the azure heavens and transformed his form, hence named Great Ultimate.

The title High Sovereign honors his residence in the apex heaven, roaming freely above the Great Luo, named the Supreme Above the Supreme, transcending all forms; thus called High Sovereign.

Radiance signifies the true essence of dharma-nature, clear as lapis lazuli, easily reflecting merit’s light, illuminating dark places, dispelling beings’ obstacles, breaking the mountain of vexations; hence named Radiance.

Jade Emperor dwells within the Jade Palace, supreme among myriad heavens, his true nature condensed and wondrously complete, majestic and vast, surpassing all truths, like stars circling the moon; thus called Jade Emperor.

King of Orthodox Dharma expounds the correct dharma, destroys heretical and heterodox sects, opens the path of non-action, extinguishes all suffering, reveals boundless dharma gates, seals the three heavenly scriptures and talismans, subdues demons and evil, removes petty views, and leads into the great vehicle. Like a great physician king with medicinal dharma curing suffering, like thunder in spring awakening sprouts, nurturing growth and life, like sweet dew rain nourishing all roots and natures; hence called King of Orthodox Dharma.

Great Compassionate Father, from immeasurable and boundless kalpas beyond measure, appeared as the Great Sage body, saving beings, liberating them from the cycle of birth and death into the true orthodox dao. Sometimes rescuing those in evil realms, saving the suffering beings, surpassing even newborn infants; thus named Great Compassionate Father.

The title Immortal True Master, the Dao Lord told Universal Aid, refers to how I, you, and the boundless, countless kalpas of heavenly venerables, great sages, and true great immortals have ascended the supreme dao-fruit. All heavenly venerables, true sacred assemblies, heavenly kings and emperors, jade emperors and great emperors, the Three Blossoms Emperors, the Five Emperors Great Demons, renowned mountains, grotto mansions, the void water and land—all sentient beings who have attained the fruit, are attaining the fruit, or have yet to attain the fruit—are all manifestations of my original teacher, the Primordial Heavenly Venerable. He manifests the void primordial dharma body, the natural reward body, and the primordial transformation body, guiding with true dharma in myriad ways, expounding the thirty-six divisions of honored scriptures.

Sometimes appearing in forests, springs, famous mountains, and great peaks; sometimes in great grotto heavens or small grotto heavens; sometimes among the thirty-six heavens; sometimes within the thirty-two imperial palaces; sometimes in the Three Pure Ones’ Great Luo and boundless realms; sometimes in foreign lands; and wherever sentient beings gather, with form and appearance, manifesting variously according to roots and understanding, transforming and guiding. Those not yet liberated, he vows to liberate; those not yet attaining the dao, he vows to enable attainment; those not yet at peace, he vows to bring peace; those not yet freed, he vows to free; those not yet ascending the profound, he vows to lead upward.

With this great vow, he opens and guides all, expounding the Three Caverns’ essential techniques, the great treasury of wondrous texts, heavenly scripts of jade characters, golden treasure secret chapters—all fully complete. He transmits all dharmas, though boundless, I summarize and circulate them in twelve categories, differentiated according to roots, so that all beings may each return to one path and attain understanding of the orthodox dharma:

One, this text itself;  
Two, divine talismans;  
Three, precious formulas;  
Four, numinous diagrams;  
Five, genealogical registers;  
Six, precepts and rules;  
Seven, dignified conduct;  
Eight, methods and techniques;  
Nine, mystical numbers;  
Ten, records and transmissions;  
Eleven, praises and recitations;  
Twelve, proclamations and petitions.

Possessing such wisdom and opening such dharma gates, he guides and receives beings of the turbid kalpa, regarding them as his own children. Yet if these children do not awaken and understand, though great compassion is extended and nets of mercy are cast, beings remain attached to sights and sounds, ensnared by various affections, wandering again through the Three Realms, never returning to the true path, clinging only to false views. When they encounter the Heavenly Venerable’s transformative and enticing true dharma, all are awakened, and since kalpas past, tirelessly saved from suffering. Hence he is called Immortal True Master.

Universal Aid said, “I have yet to understand the twelve categories of affairs, the subtle principles and dharma essentials, and their manifestations. Like great dharma rain filling vessels according to their capacity, transforming and moving beings’ roots and natures, I have not yet grasped the subtle principles. I humbly request explanation of the two awakenings and understandings. Your servant would be most fortunate.”

The Dao Lord said to Universal Aid, “The first, this text itself, is the heavenly script of eight assemblies, phoenix seal, and dragon script. It is the root of heaven, earth, and all things, awakening humans and gods, establishing all dharmas, summoning the Nine Heavens’ gods, immortals, and emperors; arranging and confirming talismans and charts; regulating governance and celestial pivots; overseeing Fengdu; subduing demons and ghosts; commanding the Water Emperor; summoning dragons and halting clouds; marking the kalpa periods of heaven and earth; recording holy true names; governing the platform city; the sacred realms—all widely proclaimed and distinguished, various and precise. It governs the method of transforming primordial essence into form, all unfolding the profound mysteries, clear and complete.

The second, divine talismans, are cloud seal writings, the trust of divine truths, summoning and subduing demons, commanding gods and ghosts, managing qi and fate, protecting life and extending years.

The third, precious formulas, are the heavenly true highest sages’ explanations of the heavenly script’s eight assemblies’ characters, establishing correct pronunciation and opening the view of the great dao.

The fourth, numinous diagrams, are the manifestations of the sacred assembly, appearing boundlessly, drawn and written with transformations, enabling things to awaken and understand.

The fifth, genealogical registers, record the names of immortals and true beings, their ancestral lineages and descendants, and the ranks of divine officials.

The sixth, precepts and rules, are regulations and commands to prevent errors and inspect faults, explaining and measuring sins and merits, distinguishing light and heavy.

The seventh, dignified conduct, sets models for fasting, abstinence, advancement, retreat, bowing and looking up, discipline and demeanor.

The eighth, methods and techniques, are writings of the sacred assembly on elixirs, secret essentials, divine herbs and spiritual mushrooms, soft gold, water jade, and the way of cultivation and nourishment.

The ninth, mystical numbers, clarify discerning the thinking spirit, preserving true dao mindfulness, heart fasting and emptiness forgetting, roaming the void and flying steps, breathing the six qi, guiding and drawing the three lights, refining substance and transforming form—the method of immortal transcendence.

The tenth, records and transmissions, are the sacred assembly’s accounts of studies, attainment of the dao and realization of truth, penetrating the profound and entering the wondrous, cultivating causes and methods, and the timing of fruit attainment.

The eleventh, praises and recitations, are the true great sages’ artful dharma words, extolling the orthodox dao, inspiring faith and joy, initiating dedication and reverence.

The twelfth, proclamations and petitions, are the master-disciple transmissions, wondrous treasures and wondrous texts, the three origins and eight festivals, altar ascensions and oaths, initiation and transmission, repentance and requesting blessings, and closing announcements.

These twelve categories fully manifest the orthodox dao, encompassing all intentions and purposes without omission. They transform and guide the Three Vehicles, enabling attainment of the supreme dao.

My great original teacher, called Heavenly Venerable, dwells always above the Three Pure Ones, transcending the assembly of sacred daos, manifesting in the world’s lowlands, uniquely residing in heaven as most honored. Hence called Heavenly Venerable. This is the wondrous meaning of the ten titles’ merits and dharma gates of the Primordial Heavenly Venerable.”

The Dao Lord further said to Universal Aid, “If there are future beings of the turbid kalpa who hear the causes and merits of my original teacher, the Great Sage Primordial Heavenly Venerable’s ten titles, and are able to inscribe images, sing praises, worship reverently, and expound this dharma, that person will be born in the ninth ancestral heaven, their past karma extinguished, their body attaining the path of long life and immortality. Their family will be peaceful and secure, their descendants flourishing, encountering the dao generation after generation, never suffering calamity or misfortune. If anyone writes and cultivates this scripture, their merits will be boundless.

Having spoken of the merits of the ten titles, all in the assembly ascended the ranks of immortality, transcended to saintly positions, and all realized the supreme orthodox true dao fruit.

The Perfected Universal Aid verified the heavenly honored title and said, ‘Seeking the Voice, Savior from Suffering Heavenly Venerable,’ possessing eighty-one excellences, seventy-two marks, and the ten titles perfected and complete, radiant and crystal-clear.

In the void, praises were voiced for Universal Aid, thus declaring the merits: inconceivable, wisdom beyond measure. In the coming world, he will be the king among dao teachers for all beings, the great dharma eye, no different from the Dao Lord in divine power.

Thus, all future beings hearing this dharma essentials will leave birth and death suffering, awakening to the true orthodox dao.

Then Universal Aid, empowered by the Dao Lord’s divine power, wished to ascend the Three Heavens and composed this verse:

*The Dao Lord, great compassion and mercy,*  
*With golden mouth unfolds the true treasury.*  
*Now hearing the ten titles,*  
*Enables me to realize the true dao.*  
*I bow to the Unconditioned Master,*  
*Whose thousand lights complete his form.*
