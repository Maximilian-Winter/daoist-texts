## The Most High Numinous Treasure Scripture of Great Blessings for Erasing Sins and Naming Images

In ancient times, the crown prince of the Kingdom of Anren was named Tai Xu, styled Haikong. His conduct was of utmost sincerity and resolve; he renounced worldly life to cultivate the dao. His father, the king, pitied his steadfast heart and upright nature, knowing it could not be suppressed. Thus he summoned the supreme true master among the kingdom’s genuine adepts, who descended from the heavenly palace.

The prince prostrated himself, crawling forward on his knees, bowing his head and knocking it to the ground, entreating grace:  
“Tai Xu, fortunate through a thousand years, has met a true teacher. I humbly feel ashamed before Heaven, Earth, and all spirits. Joy and fear overwhelm me; I know not how to express my gratitude.”  

The disciple humbly reported:  
“I have heard of the Numinous Treasure Great Law, the Three Primordial True Scriptures, the Supreme Clarity Purple Writings, golden slips and jade tally books, each character a square of one zhang, their script radiant and brilliant. These are the reliance of sincere alchemy; I earnestly hope to receive their hidden wisdom, to have them revealed, to comfort the dust-laden heart below.”  

The supreme true master joyfully replied:  
“Well said, well said! Your earnest heart seeks the dao, and you bow in devotion—such a thing has not occurred for countless kalpas. I have heard that when our true scriptures descend to the world, they save all heavens and humans, with strict prohibitions and majestic authority, numinous writings and treasured secrets, the profound mystery of the ultimate dao, unknown even to the perfected immortals. Though you are a noble crown prince, cleansing your heart and yearning for the law, your foul dregs and filth forbid me from lightly transmitting it.”  

The prince then prostrated fully, pressing all five limbs to the earth, crawling with the wind, and addressed the master:  
“In this fleeting world, nothing is truly real. Birth, aging, sickness, and death cycle endlessly through kalpas. Though one holds a high position, who can endure forever? Like a flash of lightning, flowing water, floating bubbles, or a sudden spark—none can grasp it. Though the supreme law is lofty and secret, I hope you will glance upon these writings and, out of great compassion, kindly bestow them.”  

Tai Xu requested to resign his position as heir and dwell in a secluded forest. The king pitied him and granted his sincere wish. The true master, knowing Tai Xu’s sincerity worthy of record and that the true dao had its appointed time, opened the Purple Yang Jade Chest and the cloud-brocade pouch. According to the prescribed rites, he pledged before Heaven to transmit the numinous treasure true writings and the Three Primordial precepts.  

Tai Xu then bowed his head and struck his cheeks, gazing upward in thanks for the vast grace. Having received the true scriptures, he firmly declined his father’s summons and entered the Human-Bird Mountain to purify himself through fasting and meditation.  

For twelve years, the Five Elder Emperor Lords bestowed the scriptures upon Tai Xu, who attained the rank of true master. On the day of the Middle Primordial Festival, within the palace’s main hall, he arranged a solemn and pure adornment: divine banners and treasure canopies, numinous fruits and famed flowers, all the kingdom’s precious and colorful treasures, fragrant incense and noble jewels, a hundred flavors of food and drink, fresh and refined essences. He established a mountain altar, distributing offerings according to place, with incense wafting back on the wind, soaring straight to the Nine Heavens and up to the heavenly palace.

At that time, the Primordial Heavenly Venerable beheld Tai Xu as worthy of transformation and salvation. Along with flying celestial immortals, various heavenly emperor lords, jade youths and jade maidens, vajra spirit kings, and heavenly warrior spirits, they led and followed, descending from the northwest sky, narrowing the void to alight upon the seat. Within the heavenly palace, the assembly of supreme sages gathered, yet none pressed forward.  

In an instant, the Heavenly Venerable emitted five-colored breath from his mouth, subtle and wondrous light illuminating the Three Thousand Great Thousand Worlds of the heavens, seeing through them as one, without obstruction, like viewing one’s own palm—unimaginable.

The Heavenly Venerable addressed the four assemblies:  
“I have heard that the people of this land, whether male or female, for countless kalpas have not been pure. Proud and indulgent, entangled in vexations, their years short and without liberation. I open a convenient gate for future lives, to lift and cure their suffering, universally bringing peace and joy, all returning to the good dao, together approaching the mysterious ferry.”  

The four assemblies upheld him and respectfully listened to the dharma voice.

The Heavenly Venerable said:  
“The karma of sentient beings is not from a single source. Good, evil, suffering, and emptiness pervade all dharma realms. Mixed evil retribution is limitless and boundless. For future lives, I briefly show the essential precepts, then expound the twenty-four gates of precepts and vows, enticing and encouraging the lost on the path, leading to the ultimate dao field, each receiving fruit according to their portion, forging the treasured sword to sever vexations, lighting the dharma lamp to illuminate the four confusions. Inner stillness calms dusty toil; outer severance frees from bonds. All faculties are purified, ascending the gate of right contemplation, and enabling all beings to reach the land of liberation.”  

Then the supreme true master and all the immortal assembly accepted the precepts and vows, performing rites with reverence.

At the assembly, there was a true master named Xianwei, who saw this wondrous gathering, difficult to compare or describe, and rejoiced without measure. He asked the heavenly emperor lords:  
“I have heard that in past great assemblies, the dharma was expounded with radiant majesty. Never did I imagine to personally encounter, now, the heavens and saints sharing one dharma voice. This land and others are as clear as the palm of one’s hand. The Primordial Heavenly Venerable’s majesty is dazzling, terrifying the spirits. To his left stands the Immortal Minister, to his right the True Elder, vermilion phoenix and mysterious turtle, azure dragon and white tiger, heavenly boys and girls, countless beings without restraint, floating in the air, narrowing the void, opening the treasure store widely.”  

At that time, the assembly advanced to the high true rank; the beginners all entered the immortal steps. Humbly, I hear that beings below are stained by the three evils, unkind, unfilial, unloved, unbenevolent, bound by the Three Officials, unable to escape. Where can they turn? How can they obtain forgiveness? What cultivation leads to pardon?”

The Heavenly Venerable said:  
“You should listen carefully. I now reveal to you what was not heard before, explaining vexations, severing doubts and obstacles, opening the realm of the Mysterious Capital, the jade slips and true writings, the heavenly venerable titles, so that future lives may awaken, sincerely turn their hearts, purify themselves with fasting and incense, light lamps with devoted hearts, believe and revere the primordial venerable titles, treasured secret numinous writings, and all immortal assemblies, bowing and wishing to remember. They cut away the bright true jade caskets of the nine dark abysses and the long night’s box, thereby attaining birth among humans and heavens, leaving suffering and liberation, dissolving the countless sins like grains of sand, gaining innumerable good affinities. Therefore, with devoted heart, they turn and reverently bow.”

After revering the Three Treasures, next comes the sincere confession:

Disciples, from countless kalpas past until today, in body, speech, and mind, have committed evil and transgressions, as numerous as dust and sand, beyond reckoning. Some, in their prime, indulge in dissipation, pursuing a hundred desires, committing theft and injury, indulging their hearts and pleasures, favoring the wicked and rebellious, disregarding peril, disrespecting parents, unfilial and unkind, cruel in conduct, plotting harm and harboring resentment, encroaching on the common people, harboring jealousy, causing the heavenly folk to fear, and the high and low to detest. If there is such transgression, please begin with the foremost confession.  

Some, in the three springs, set fire to burn insects and snakes, hunting and capturing, harming the lives of all creatures, embryos, eggs, moist transformations, water, land, flying and swimming, hiding and fleeing without place, all slaughtered, taking delight and pleasure without repentance. If there is such transgression, please begin with the foremost confession.  

Some speak frivolous and ornate words, slandering the good, stirring strife among kin and friends, inciting neighbors, causing internal and external hatred, estrangement near and far, giving rise to enmity and plotting harm. If there is such transgression, please begin with the foremost confession.  

Some greedily hoard worldly wealth, never satisfied, scheming and cutting corners, deceiving face to face, taking from others to benefit themselves, harming the poor and needy, devoted only to stinginess and greed. If there is such transgression, please begin with the foremost confession.  

Some receive dharma precepts but are not diligent or earnest, seeking profit for themselves, lacking compassion and thought, feigning convenience, deceiving humans and heavens, taking merit money, using it selfishly, shameless and unrepentant, unafraid of the future. If there is such transgression, today, with utmost sincerity, seek mercy and repent, and turn to the Three Treasures.

With sincere heart, open the vow:  
May disciples, from now on, after repentance, have their merits and virtues, in all lives and worlds, forever free from stinginess and greed, without thoughts of deception or theft, always practicing generosity and kindness, arising a heart of compassion, widely building bridges, aiding and delivering all beings, with heavenly folk sufficiently supplied, high and low in harmony. May the fruits of blessings and virtue be adorned in every generation, with long life complete. May all four births and six paths together meet good affinities, jointly realize the wondrous gate, and attain the supreme dao. Having opened this vow, bow and revere the Three Treasures.

These three cavern treasure scriptures, by their mixed formation, accumulate the profound radiance, divided into two references, yin and yang subtly transforming, heaven and earth arrayed and covering, three and five initiating sequence, eight assemblies forming text. Sometimes written in golden phoenix seal script, sometimes fashioned in jade dragon script, their clarity and freshness govern the cavern, embroidered with purple forest brilliance, sometimes floating mist appears as eight-cornered rays hanging, great emptiness presents five brilliant chapters, their radiance shining upon the Three Realms, illuminating the Nine Darknesses. Dividing their degrees, expounding teachings to the heavens, each heaven one division, combined into thirty-six divisions, placed securely on the jade platform in the mysterious seat of the seven treasures. Nine-colored brocade clouds hang over the scriptures, golden youths on the left holding incense, jade maidens on the right scattering flowers in offering. Once every forty thousand kalpas they emerge, once every three thousand years transmitted. Therefore, heavenly beings revere them with clear ascent, earth immortals receive them with tranquil peace, the sun and moon polish them with high brightness, the Five Great Mountains uphold them with spiritual power, emperors honor them with sacred transformation, dukes and kings respect them with great peace, scholars and commoners revere and receive blessings, and students cultivate to attain longevity.

After revering the Three Treasures, next comes the sincere confession:

Disciples, from countless boundless kalpas past until today, body and mind in chaos, not recognizing cause and condition, evil karma increasing, without awareness, deaf to truth and inverted in vision, difficult to fully recount. Now, before the dao field and Three Treasures, we seek mercy and repentance. Humbly beseech the heavenly venerables of the Ten Directions, the thirty-six divisions of revered scriptures, profound dharma masters, all true immortals, and the sacred assemblies of the void, those with heavenly ears and eyes, to witness and confirm, that all roots of sin be confessed and extinguished.  

Repentant disciples, from countless lives until today, may have violated gods and turned from the dao, unafraid of bright spirits, speaking harsh words, slandering orthodox teaching, seeing images and hearing scriptures without reverence, mocking others’ cultivation of merit, never repenting, without shame or conscience. Today, with utmost sincerity, all is confessed.  

Next, confess ignorance of cause and effect, and the grace of parents, committing wrongful acts, relying on one’s nature, rebellious and crude in conduct, disrespecting rank and elders, while parents live, sweetly refusing to see them, dying in wilderness, offerings never heard, causing the spirits to suffer examination and punishment, with no good fortune in the human world. Such sins are limitless and boundless, sincerely confessed.  

Next, confess the sin of kalpa theft. The scripture says, if something belongs to another, guarded by them, not a hair or thread to be taken, how much more theft is forbidden. Yet sentient beings fail to awaken, indulging in theft and plunder, still acting recklessly, causing future suffering and punishment. If there is such transgression, please begin with foremost confession.  

Furthermore, the scripture says ordinary people’s sins are especially grave, dying and entering the spirit realm’s Avici Hell. Avici Hell, vast as eighty thousand yojanas, with seven layers of iron cities, seven iron nets above ground, eighteen partitions below, surrounded by seven layers, all knife forests. Inside the seven-layer city are sword forests, eighteen partitions below. Each partition is eighty-four thousand four hundred layers. At its four corners are four great copper dogs, each body four thousand yojanas long, eyes like lightning, teeth like sword trees, fangs like knife mountains, tongue like iron hook, claws like iron forks, tail like iron python, each tail shining fiercely, their smoke and stench deadly and foul, incomparable. The hell has four gates, each gate guarded by eighteen jailers like rakshasas, with eighteen horns on their heads, holding iron forks, seizing sinners, striking their hearts and backs. Each partition gate has eighty-four thousand iron python great snakes, mouths spewing poison fire, filling the city, roaring like great thunder and storm. Great iron balls also fill the city; this city is extremely painful. Outside each of the four gates are fierce fires, east, south, west, north, intersecting and permeating, surrounded by iron walls and nets, fire reaching up and down, all directions simultaneously, all suffering arises.  

As said above, those who violate the five grave precepts and slander merit, if they repent without shame according to scripture, at death they must enter this suffering. Those who lightly regard the Three Treasures, steal permanent pure wealth, pollute others’ Brahman practice, do not leave this hell. When sinners suffer, fierce fire enters the heart, suffocating to death. One day and one night, dying and living ten thousand times, enduring all suffering and vexation. As above, after leaving Avici Hell, due to breaking precepts and false faith and giving, they enter the eighteen lesser hells: the cold ice hell, dark hell, scorching hell, knife wheel hell, sword wheel hell, fire cart hell, boiling cauldron hell, sword forest hell, iron bed hell, copper pillar hell, iron machine hell, iron wheel hell, iron ball hell, sharp stone hell, drinking copper hell, each lasting eight million years. Then they emerge, always born in lower realms. For five hundred kalpas, not knowing the Three Treasures, encountering good teachers to awaken the supreme dao mind. Those who do not meet good teachers have no further chance of escape.  

Therefore, disciples, having met good affinities in past lives, now again hearing the scriptures and teachings, their body and mind leap with joy, single-mindedly devout, cleansing past transgressions, wishing to cultivate new deeds. May they from the Nine Ancestors downward, not hear or see such evil affinities, forever leave this suffering. Having repented, bow and revere the Three Treasures.

With sincere heart, make the vow:  
May disciples, in life and death, accept this repentance and the merits established thereby. May all lives and worlds forever leave the Three Paths, long renounce the eight sufferings, not be seized by enemies, not see evil forms before them, carefree and liberated, wandering the realm of non-action, rejoicing in offerings from humans and heavens, always hearing elegant music. May the world be safe and peaceful, untroubled by vexations. May the gate be filled with good omens, the dwelling abundant and wealthy, blessings renewed, disasters not yet ended. Having made this vow, bow and revere the Three Treasures.
