## Scroll One of The Most High Profound Numinous Treasure Heavenly Venerable’s Names

### The Primordial Heavenly Venerable’s One Thousand Five Hundred Names and Various Repentance Texts

At that time, the Primordial Heavenly Venerable, on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, at the Floating Luo Peak of Yucha Mountain in the Western Nayu Kingdom, delivered liberation to all beings. The Heavenly Venerable, together with his disciples—the True Lords and Supreme Sages—as well as the celestial emperors, heavenly dragons, ghosts and spirits, and assorted beings, all returned to the Abode of Everlasting Joy.

Beneath the stubborn wood, naturally emerged the throne of the Great Profound True Unity, shining with ninefold radiance and adorned with a jeweled screen of the Seven Treasures. The throne was lofty and wide, fashioned entirely of gold, silver, pearls, jade, coral, tiger’s soul, chariot agate, and carnelian, exquisitely carved and splendidly adorned. Interspersed were precious banners, fluttering flags and canopies, inside and out glowing with brilliance, illuminating the Ten Directions and the boundless worlds. Incense, flowers, and music surrounded it in a perfect circle. Lions and tigers stood guard, dragons and scaled beasts prowled fiercely, divine tigers leapt and soared, all protecting the left and right. Phoenixes, peacocks, golden-winged vermilion birds—all uttered elegant sounds, flying and singing atop the throne.

Though the throne had form, it did not obstruct objects; people came and went without hindrance. Around it were smaller thrones of colored glaze, each naturally emerging from lotus platforms, encircling on all four sides.

At the moment the Heavenly Venerable floated down, he ascended the jeweled throne, seated upright and settled in serene calm, tranquil and still, entering the wondrous gate beyond words and the dao of speech.

All the assembled multitude bowed once, taking their places. Having witnessed this, all reflected within themselves, marveling that such a sight had never before been seen.

The foremost disciple, Left Profound True Lord, named Dharma Understanding, rose from his seat and, together with the similar disciples from the Ten Directions, advanced and bowed, prostrating with all five limbs and holding a single pure thought. He addressed the Heavenly Venerable:

“This Seven Treasures throne is wondrously beautiful and rare, its form lifelike and unimpeded by things.”

The Heavenly Venerable, seated on the throne, immediately understood Dharma Understanding’s question concerning the meaning. From his face, he emitted five-colored radiance that illuminated the Ten Directions and boundless lands, all manner of strange and diverse worlds, heavens and hells, all visible within. Furthermore, the Heavenly Venerables of the Ten Directions and the great immortals were all seen within; birth and death, suffering and joy, the measure of blessings and retributions were all revealed; the stages of cultivation were likewise visible; pure and impure lands also appeared.

The countless beings from the Ten Directions were like motes of dust, innumerable beyond count, all seeing the utmost bliss of heaven and the bitter, boundless torment of hell.

They also beheld the Great Blessed Hall Kingdom, the Abode of Everlasting Joy, surpassing the Southern Palace in incomparable bliss.

Dharma Understanding, Supreme Ultimate True Lord, Great Wisdom True Lord, and Deliverance True Lord, the Four Great True Lords, respectfully addressed the Heavenly Venerable:

“Now, within this radiance, we see all manner of lands, differing in suffering and joy, heaven and hell, with varying retributions. We only beseech the Heavenly Venerable’s great mercy and compassion to save and protect all beings, to bring benefit and liberation, so that they may be freed forever from sorrow and swiftly be born into the Pure Land.”

The Heavenly Venerable said to Deliverance True Lord:

“Well said, well said! Listen carefully. Now I will explain to you the names of the Heavenly Venerables of the Ten Directions. With wholehearted reverence, bowing and repentance, one extinguishes countless sins and generates boundless blessings, thereby attaining birth in the utmost blissful worlds of the heavens. One must perform immeasurable meritorious deeds, give freely to the poor and needy, perfect the practice of contemplation, level the mind without duality, and forever sever attachment and craving—then one will swiftly escape boundless vexations.”

Deliverance True Lord said:

“This is the impure world of Wanli Heaven Abandoned Worthies, a place of mixed evil, filled with hells, hungry ghosts, and beasts, crowded with unwholesome gatherings. May I in the future never hear evil words nor see evil people. Considering these words, this place is indeed an impure land where no one finds joy. In such a world, the four seasons and eight festivals consume human life; spring, autumn, winter, and summer bring wind, rain, cold, and heat; day and night alternate, sun and moon chase each other; the land is strewn with gravel and sand, uneven and perilous; mountains and rivers block the way; grass and trees are thorny and bristling—nothing is pleasant.

The human body suffers birth, aging, sickness, and death; it is an impure, temporary assemblage. Danger halts its reward; the body requires clothing and food, which are hard to satisfy; hunger and thirst arise constantly. Moreover, royal laws drive and chase, leaving no freedom. Even if gathered, only ignorant children remain as companions, along with oxen, horses, pigs, sheep, and various beasts, all suffering the consequences of their deeds.

Eyes see foul sights, ears hear evil sounds, noses smell foul odors, tongues taste bitter flavors, bodies endure unpleasant touches, and minds cling to evil dharmas—how can there be joy in such affairs?

Furthermore, life is uncertain and especially fearful; breath comes and goes, thoughts thank death. Even if one lives a hundred years, counting days, it amounts to only thirty-six thousand days of life, and yet life’s span is often shorter—death is no doubt certain.

Since one does not strive against death, one must seek a peaceful and joyful world, desiring birth in the Everlasting Joy Pure Land, where endless bliss prevails, clothed in heavenly silks and fed by celestial kitchens, free from the four seasons’ cold and heat, day and night’s alternation, and without birth, aging, sickness, or death. There are no names of the Three Paths or the Eight Hardships of suffering.

May all beings journey to the Blessed Hall Kingdom, behold the Heavenly Venerables of the Ten Directions, and always wish to offer them complete devotion.

Deliverance True Lord addressed the Primordial:

“I bow to the Holy True Dharma King within the sacred midst. The priceless treasure in the hearts of beings is constantly robbed by the six thieves. Arrows of wrath and anger shoot through the heart; ignorance and craving tightly lock the gates. Human desires bind and imprison the body; kin and family torment each other. When will the five turbid defiled lands end? The great flood of ignorance has no ferry to cross.

Great Compassionate Deliverance Heavenly Venerable, I only beseech you to show mercy and many expedients, to make for all beings the priceless dharma boat of good salvation, carrying them across to the other shore. No wine or meat, no pungent spices are taken aboard; it is pure, swept and sprinkled, with statues and banners arrayed on all sides, adorned with incense, flowers, and canopies. Reciting the dao and bowing day and night for seven days and nights, one will dream a vision, and a True Lord will come to teach. The Heavenly Venerable manifests in many forms, with names equal to the myriad Heavenly Venerables of the Ten Directions, transforming to save countless beings. I only beseech the Heavenly Venerable to speak at such times; we bow and never retreat.”

At that time, Left Profound True Lord and Deliverance True Lord bowed and praised the True Pure Heavenly Venerable’s land of the Western Nayu Kingdom, wishing to journey with all dharma realm beings to that Pure Land. They wished to see the Radiant Treasure Forest, with a Seven Treasures Daoist sanctuary, its tree towering four million li high, its base circumference thirty-five million four hundred thousand li, its branches and leaves spreading two hundred thousand li.

Those who see this tree have their sins and obstacles removed and are born in the highest grade of the dharma realm, reborn in the Western Nayu Kingdom.

They wished to see the True Pure Heavenly Venerable of the Everlasting Joy Kingdom, whose awe-inspiring virtue surpasses all worlds, shining with supreme radiance, adorned with noble features.

They wished to see the Seven Treasures Bathing Pool of the Everlasting Joy Kingdom, filled with the water of supreme goodness, crystal clear and full; its bottom paved with precious sands, its banks lined with fragrant trees. Entering the pool opens the spirit and delights the body, washing away the grime of the heart and attaining the correct dao.

They wished to see the True Pure Heavenly Venerable of the Everlasting Joy Jade Kingdom, robed in seven treasures and bright pearls, wearing a nine-rayed jeweled cloud mantle, seated on a thousand-petal lotus jeweled platform, its golden base guarded by lions and nine-colored sea dragons, attended by immortal children and jade maidens scattering incense and flowers.

They wished to see the Great Compassionate True Lord of the Everlasting Joy Jade Kingdom’s Sun Canopy, possessing thirty-two marks and eighty-one excellences, his body golden in hue, crowned with a jewel, his neck surrounded by a round halo, a radiant necklace glowing all around, with ornaments hanging everywhere.

They wished to see the True Lord of Orderly Transformation, adorned with noble features, skillful in guiding and leading beings, purifying and removing karmic obstacles.

They wished to see the Great Compassionate True Lord of the Everlasting Joy Kingdom’s Moon Purity, his entire body radiant, shining purple-gold across the Ten Directions, visible to all beings with affinity.

They wished to receive his power to remove the sins of birth and death, to be enlightened and return to the correct dao.

They wished to see the assembly of True Lords of that land, bright with wisdom, penetrating spiritual powers, with bodies of emptiness and forms of boundlessness.

They wished to personally visit and cultivate the highest meritorious deeds to be born in the Everlasting Joy Kingdom.

If anyone recites and bows day and night to this True Pure Heavenly Venerable of the Everlasting Joy Kingdom, they wash away countless sins and defilements, inconceivable in number.

At that time, the Primordial Heavenly Venerable began to recite the names of the Heavenly Venerables of the Ten Directions—one hundred eighty Dao Lords and one thousand two hundred Laozis.

If one were to broadly recite the names of the Heavenly Venerables, like motes of dust in number, even speaking through the endless kalpas would not suffice.

Even the Heavenly Venerables sharing the same name cannot be fully enumerated.

Briefly, the one thousand five hundred Heavenly Venerables of the Ten Directions are named; bowing and chanting their names brings merits beyond measure.

Thus, they performed the bowing ceremony.

After fifty bows, two Great True Lords were appointed to pronounce the litany, inconceivable in merit, each name repeated three times:

Having bowed to the Three Treasures, next comes repentance:

With utmost sincerity, I bow to the Ever-Present Three Treasures of the Ten Directions, repenting the sin of greed and desire.

The scripture says: Because of greed and desire, one is locked in the prison of ignorance, drowning in the river of birth and death, from which none can escape.

All beings, due to these five desires and conditions, have wandered birth and death from ancient times.

For each being, the bones accumulated in one kalpa are like great mountains; the milk consumed is like the waters of the four seas; the blood shed exceeds these.

Parents, brothers, kin, and family, at death, weep; the tears shed are also like the waters of the four great seas.

Therefore, it is said: Where there is love, there is birth; when love ends, there is extinction.

Thus, it is known that birth and death stem from craving and attachment.

Hence, the scripture says: The sin of lust causes beings to fall into hell, hungry ghosts, and suffering.

If born as beasts, one suffers as pigeons, crows, owls, and others.

If born human, wives are unfaithful and do not follow their husbands.

Since lust brings such evil karma, the pure men and women now present bow to the Three Treasures.

Since beginningless time until today, some have, among the daoists, failed to attain the human body, the dao revered, and the great teachers; some have failed to generate faith, lacked the six faculties, and not met good friends.

Now, having gathered together, with past good roots and this human body with six faculties complete, and meeting good friends, hearing the great dao and correct dharma, yet still failing to exert full heart and diligent practice, fearing in the future to be immersed in myriad sufferings without end.

The two True Lords each named thrice.

Having bowed to the Three Treasures, next comes repentance:

Repentance is fundamentally about transforming the past and cultivating the future, extinguishing evil and arousing good.

Who among people living in the world can be without fault? Even the learned, when forgetting, still stir afflictions; even immortals, when habitual, sometimes speak wrongly. How much more so ordinary folk, who can be faultless?

Only the wise learn early and can repent, exposing and extinguishing faults; otherwise, hidden faults grow like boiling water, and the long night of habitual ignorance has no dawn.

If one can feel shame, confess, and repent, not only does one extinguish sins, but also grows boundless merit, establishing the Heavenly Venerable’s supreme wondrous fruit.

If one wishes to practice this method, first one must purify the outer lodging and solemnly observe proper conduct, gaze upon the sacred images, and internally generate reverence, based on the signs and forms, exerting effort to the utmost, producing two kinds of mind.

What are these two?

First, reflect: This body and life are hard to preserve; one day they will scatter and decay; one does not know when this body may be lost. If one does not meet the Heavenly Venerable and the worthy sages, but instead encounters evil friends and creates many sins, one will surely fall into the Three Paths’ evil realms.

Second, reflect: Though in this life one may meet the Heavenly Venerable’s correct dharma and understand the true dharma, inheriting the sacred lineage, purifying body, speech, and mind, and dwelling in good dharma, yet now we ourselves commit evil and conceal it, claiming ignorance or that others do not see, hiding it in the heart without shame—this is the greatest folly in the world.

Now, the Heavenly Venerables of the Ten Directions, the great True Lords, the heavenly gods and immortals, all watch with pure, great eyes our every sin and evil deed.

Moreover, the hidden and manifest spirits record sins and blessings, without the slightest error.

Yet those who commit sins, after death, have their spirits recorded by the Ox-Head jailers in the Luo Deng Palace under the Northern Emperor, who judge right and wrong, examine faults and errors.

At the time of transmigration, all those wronged come as witnesses, each saying: “You first slaughtered my body, roasted and boiled me,” or “You first deprived me of all my wealth and separated me from my kin. Now I have found you; here is the present evidence. How can you dare deny it?”

One must willingly accept the karmic retribution.

As the scripture states, in hell there is no unjust treatment.

If in life one commits sins and deceives oneself, that is the cause.

With utmost sincerity, I bow to the Heavy Virtue Heavenly Venerable,  
With utmost sincerity, I bow to the Longevity Heavenly Venerable,  
With utmost sincerity, I bow to the Great Wisdom Measure Heavenly Venerable.

Having bowed to the Three Treasures, next comes repentance:

With utmost sincerity, I bow to the Ever-Present Three Treasures of the Ten Directions.

We also repent the sins of ignorance and helplessness in the beast realm, the inability to act freely there, and the evil deeds committed in past lives.

All forms appear before us, each saying: “You once were by my side, committing such sins; how can you deny it now?”

This is the sin committed, with no place to hide.

Then the Northern Emperor Dengdu grits his teeth and scolds, consigning one to hell, enduring kalpas and countless years, with no way out.

This matter is not distant.

[Text missing]

It is precisely ourselves who create and suffer these consequences.

Even father and son, closest kin, [text missing], all together, and when the body ceases, the many sufferings, each striving, fearing for life, but when the time comes, regret is too late.

Therefore, pure men and women sincerely bow to the Heavenly Venerables of the Ten Directions and repent fully.

The Heavenly Venerable said:

“Monks, daoists, pure men and women, and all the worthy ones who study the great vehicle and often speak of profound meaning, but whose hearts remain in form and do not believe in karmic retribution, who are arrogant and boastful, wield authority and pose, speaking only of their own benefit, acting unlawfully, not following precepts, touching scriptures with unclean hands, not placing pure cloths, nor properly arranging them, on the ground or bedsides...”
