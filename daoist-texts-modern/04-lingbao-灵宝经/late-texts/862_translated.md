## Scripture of the Most High Profound Numinous Treasure on the Causes and Conditions for Leaving Home

The Dao speaks: Long ago, on the fifteenth day of the seventh month in the first year of the Kaihuang era, at noon, in the land of Chiming, atop the Zhu Yang High Pavilion’s Three Luminaries Precious Altar, I approached the Most High Heavenly Venerable and received the unsurpassed Three Caverns Great Vehicle Sublime Scripture, thirteen thousand five hundred chapters and five thousand seven hundred talismanic diagrams. The Heavenly Venerable prepared to return to the realm of void and non-action in the Great Emptiness. At that time, two hundred kings, together with their consorts, ministers, and all the people—men and women alike—arose with the intention of the dao. They bowed their heads before the Heavenly Venerable, renounced their kingdoms, cities, wives, and children, seeking to leave home, vowing to uphold the Three Caverns scriptures for life, to offer continual support, thus creating the merit for three lifetimes to come.

The Heavenly Venerable smiled gently and released a nine-colored precious radiance that illuminated the entire assembly, including the kings and their peoples, inside and out, clear as a crystal pearl. Every organ, every hair and fiber was visible. Within this radiant light, these kings and all men and women saw themselves clearly, their forms transparent and bright; they fully understood their karmic destinies, the good and evil of past, present, and future three lifetimes, shining plainly before their eyes.

These kings and all present were struck with awe and reverence, and their hearts stirred with the supreme and most excellent resolve. Prostrating themselves, they spoke to the Heavenly Venerable: “Your disciples, by karmic fate and timely opportunity, have encountered the compassionate and unsurpassed assembly of the Most High. Again, we meet the Most High and receive the great law of the Three Caverns. We also encounter these scriptures, revealing past causes and conditions. This is no ordinary blessing of a thousand years for ordinary people, but solely by the Heavenly Venerable’s vast compassion and grace, desiring to open the path and bestow this profound favor, have we gathered here today. Even the smallest creatures—worms and ants—how could they perceive such deep kindness? Yet with sincere whispers of the heart, we truly wish to abandon the defiled world and our wives and children, to leave home, uphold the scriptures and precepts, and create the field of merit beyond the world. We beseech the Heavenly Venerable’s special permission to do so.”

The Heavenly Venerable said: “Before you set your hearts, I already knew. The reason I emitted this radiance was to show you your karmic destinies, so you might recognize the causes of good and evil. Those who leave home bear very heavy karmic conditions. If you can set your intention, it is inconceivable. Yet I fear you will be entangled in worldly affairs, having been lax and indulgent for long, unable to endure hardship, accepting this diligent labor with a beginning but no end, first diligent then lax, not devoted to the dao, eventually falling into the evil gate, slighting your teachers and the law, bringing ruin upon yourselves.”

At this, the kings bowed their heads again, knocking their foreheads to the ground, tears flowing with their voices, and made solemn vows: “If after leaving home, we have a beginning but no end, first diligent then lax, violate our original vows, retreat in the middle, we will descend with our nine ancestors and grandparents into hell, suffering for ten thousand kalpas without reprieve, reborn as non-human beings. We dare not speak otherwise.”

The Heavenly Venerable said: “Listen carefully, I will now explain to you the causes and conditions of leaving home. Those who leave home may have ancestors who established numinous temples and profound altars, and various retreats; holy and true immortals left traces, widely building halls and palaces, creating images, true manifestations and incarnations, adorned and offered to, copying scriptures, lecturing and reciting, spreading enlightenment among humans and heavens. Or ancestors who gave away kingdoms, cities, wives and children, heads, marrow, brains, gold, silver, pearls, jade, silk, brocade, carriages, horses, servants, bedding, clothing, playthings, and utensils, entering the Three Treasures as fields of merit. Or ancestors who observed fasts and upheld precepts, bowed and burned incense, practiced the dao, chanted praises, repented sins and removed faults, constantly performing good wishes without pause. Or ancestors who released lives, saved the poor, prisoners, the old and sick, and all birds and beasts, the blind, deaf, and six diseases, all sentient beings. Or ancestors who healed sickness and cured disease, revived those in danger or dead. Or ancestors who widely read scriptures and treatises, lectured and taught, encouraged children to know the good dao. Or ancestors who planted orchards and forests, built wells by the dao’s path, made boats and bridges, aiding all in crossing over. Or ancestors who established charitable fields, gave clothing and food, fed the hungry, warmed the cold, healed the sick, and satisfied all poor beings, insects, fish, birds, and beasts. Or ancestors who built charitable halls, pitying the cold and heat, giving drinks and fire, helping travelers find peace and rest. Or ancestors who everywhere set their hearts, seeing all equally, broadly transforming men and women, encouraging and supporting dao sites, establishing temples to ferry people across, copying scriptures, casting images, conferring scriptures and precepts, bowing and burning incense, lighting lamps and reciting, giving alms and repentance, opening the eyes of the confused. Or ancestors who were loyal, faithful, benevolent, and filial, assisting the nation’s flourishing and transformation, upright, honest, pure, gentle, and kind, harming no thing, bringing peace and joy to all beings. Or ancestors who were rulers, practicing great charity, humble in palace and food, pitying the people, treating all things equally, the land peaceful and secure, though all evils were not yet ended, all good not yet perfected; though fame and merit were achieved, they could not be promoted, and in their next life were born among humans, again encountering scriptures and the dao, thus able to leave home. Or seven generations of ancestors accumulating merit, blessing their descendants. Or seeing worldly achievements, fame known among heavens, not gained in a single day.

Your ancestors believed in the Three Treasures, copied scriptures, made images, built profound altars, saved people and aided beings, observed fasts, bowed, recited, burned incense, offered support, practiced the dao, gave alms, repented and wished without ceasing, creating great merit, bringing the kings’ rewards to be foremost among humans. This is inconceivable. Furthermore, you now abandon kingdoms, cities, wives, and children, forsake worldly pleasures, seek to leave home, uphold the scriptures with sincerity, set the supreme heart, and create the long-lasting dao merit for past and future. This is exceedingly rare, inconceivable, inconceivable!”

At this, the kings bowed at once, prostrating fully, their hearts torn between sorrow and joy.

The Heavenly Venerable then commanded the nine Earth True Officials to spread out their true seats; the four Heavenly Emperors to arrange the register of transcendent immortals; the three Heavenly True Kings to descend and verify the true faith; the Five Emperors to hold banners; the Three Realms to bear talismans; the four officers to carry documents; the Three Officials’ ledgers; the heavenly emperors, immortal youths and maidens, divine immortal armies numbering in the hundreds of millions—all descended at once, scattering flowers and burning incense, raising banners and fluttering standards, striking gongs and bells, heavenly music of myriad kinds arrayed left and right, all praising in unison, arriving at the dao site to oversee the dharma assembly and open the good karmic conditions.

The Heavenly Venerable commanded me and the Jade Purity High Sage to bestow upon the kings the sincere rites of entering the dao, the discipline and majestic demeanor. The Four Heavenly Kings bestowed the dharma robes, facing north to bow to the Heavenly Venerable three times. Returning the bow, I and the heavenly immortals and sages bowed facing east, receiving the initial true sincerity.

The Sincere Vow states: After leaving home, first, never lightly disdain the scriptures and dao, nor the original master. Second, never disrespect the dharma robe or diminish the dao’s dignity. Third, never retreat halfway and pursue worldly fame and wealth. Fourth, never abandon my dharma robe to follow heterodox teachings. Fifth, never associate or dwell with non-monastics or heterodox practitioners, defiling the dharma robe. Sixth, never eat meat or drink wine, harboring thoughts of killing. Seventh, never associate with men and women, giving rise to lustful thoughts. Eighth, never violate the sincerity of the scriptures, producing faults and evils. Ninth, never be arrogant, reckless, cruel, bullying fellow practitioners or laypeople. Tenth, never disrespect parents or sovereigns, nor be disloyal or unfilial.

One must always generate the great heart, establish temples to ferry beings across, copy scriptures and cast images, uphold and glorify the Three Treasures. Two, always generate the great heart, lecture on the Three Caverns scriptures, encourage and transform all beings, causing wide awakening and understanding. Three, always generate the great heart, observe fasts, bow and burn incense with sincerity, creating the fruits of the dao for past and future lives and death. Four, always generate the great heart, perform great merit for rulers, ministers, and all people under heaven. Five, always generate the great heart, create fields of merit through kalpas for the Nine Profound and Seven Ancestors, one’s parents, family, and all beings. Six, always generate the great heart, universally for all beings on earth, sentient or insentient, with or without karmic ties, human or non-human, all consciousness, reading scriptures, bowing, reciting the dao and masters, all to be freed from suffering and ascend the dao shore. Seven, always generate the great heart, wishing all beings to awaken to the true dao, forever free from birth and death. Eight, always generate the great heart, wishing for past and future kalpas, present and future lives, that the great dao flourish, never to fall into ruin, opening the path for all beings.

These kings each bowed three times, then turned their hearts to bow to the Ten Directions, each once. Then they faced the Heavenly Venerable and spontaneously made vows: First vow, after leaving home, never to lightly disdain scriptures, dao, or master. Second vow, after leaving home, never to disrespect dharma robes or diminish the dao’s dignity. Third vow, after leaving home, never to retreat halfway or pursue worldly fame and wealth. Fourth vow, after leaving home, never to abandon dharma robes for heterodox teachings. Fifth vow, after leaving home, never to associate or dwell with non-monastics or heterodox practitioners, defiling the dharma robe. Sixth vow, after leaving home, never to eat meat or drink wine, harboring thoughts of killing. Seventh vow, after leaving home, never to associate with men and women, giving rise to lustful thoughts. Eighth vow, after leaving home, never to violate the sincerity of the scriptures, producing faults and evils. Ninth vow, after leaving home, never to be arrogant, reckless, cruel, bullying fellow practitioners or laypeople. Tenth vow, after leaving home, never to disrespect parents or sovereigns, nor be disloyal or unfilial.

One wishes to establish temples to ferry beings across, copy scriptures and cast images, uphold and glorify the Three Treasures. Two wishes to lecture on the Three Caverns scriptures, causing wide awakening and understanding. Three wishes to observe fasts, bow and burn incense with sincerity, morning and evening without cease. Four wishes to perform merit for rulers, ministers, and all people under heaven. Five wishes to create fields of merit through kalpas for the Nine Profound and Seven Ancestors, one’s parents, family, and karmic conditions. Six wishes universally for all beings on earth, reading scriptures, bowing, causing them to reach the dao shore. Seven wishes all beings awaken to the true dao. Eight wishes for past and future kalpas, always in the dao gate, hearts never retreating. Nine wishes all men and women in the Ten Directions worlds who have the dao heart to also leave home. Ten wishes for kalpa after kalpa to plant causes and soon attain the immortal dao, never to be born and die again.

Having made these vows, all the assembly praised “Excellent!” and each returned to their place.

Then the heavenly immortals and sages, the jade youths and maidens, raised banners and held standards, scattered flowers and burned incense, sang praises of the Heavenly Venerable’s boundless merit, played heavenly music, led the kings and new monastics to circumambulate the dao three times, chanting “Excellent!” ten times. After the vows were complete, they proceeded directly to the blessing hall, partook of heavenly offerings, observed fasts and purity.

The heavenly men and women, and the people of the kingdoms, laid out myriad flowers and fruits, rare and wondrous dharma flavors, proceeding in order to offer. When offerings were complete, they presented treasury storehouses’ seven treasures, pearls and jade, silks and cottons, clothing and bedding, playthings and utensils, incense burners, tables and brushes, scepters and sandals, eating vessels and mats, rope beds and knee cushions, banners, standards, washing pots, scarves, hats, daggers, sheaths, servants, carriages, horses, gardens, estates, orchards, bamboo groves, fruit forests, flower medicines, ponds and marshes, all manner of dharma items, freely given in offering.

The new monastics and all present together voiced: “We are fortunate from past lives to meet today. The Heavenly Venerable’s compassion greatly expands salvation. Having these kings abandon kingdoms and leave home, they bring great benefit to us, opening our blind and foolish hearts to see the true dao. We only wish the kings uphold the dharma form, abide in the great dharma gate, follow the Heavenly Venerable’s teachings, open the path for us, so that we may extinguish sins, generate boundless good, and in future lives attain the monastic dharma body.”

Having spoken these wishes, they praised “Excellent!” three times, gazed upon the Heavenly Venerable, bowed their heads, and sat.

The Heavenly Venerable said: “You men and women, for countless kalpas have upheld fasts and precepts, offered support and worship, and now have met this day—truly inconceivable. You should furthermore give alms to the new monastics and all assemblies; the merit is boundless. Heaven and humans rejoice. Surely at death you will be born into the gates of wealthy and noble kings. The wise and virtuous will again leave home; this is certain.”

These men and women all voiced “Excellent!” and bowed once, then sat according to rank.

The Heavenly Venerable said: “There are three meanings to leaving home: first, leaving home; second, entering the dao; third, abandoning the mundane.

What is leaving home? ‘Home’ has two meanings. First, the home of affection and love: parents’ love, brothers’ love, sisters’ love, love between men and women, kinship and attachment, all entwined and bound in the heart, creating evil karma, various attachments, causing vexation and no freedom, obstructing the cultivation of the true dao. Now to leave this home is to sever affection forever, always attain freedom, and contemplate the dao of non-action.

Second, the home of all existence: this body of mine, five aggregates and four elements gathered and formed, dwelling in the world, falsely attached, six sense organs and three karmas widely constructing dust, worldly circumstances clinging, creating many evil deeds. Color, sound, fragrance, taste, vexations and pure mind, defilement arises, reincarnation in birth and death, unable to be freed, sinking in eternal kalpas, born life after life, receiving non-human forms. Know that the body is not the self, now foul and stinking, a mass of pus and blood, temporarily lodged for a short time, one day transforming and dispersing, the hundred bones without owner, like bubbles and illusions, gathering and dispersing in a moment, myriad dharmas uneven, all equally false, not truly mine, distinct from me, falsely striking existence and non-existence, giving rise to attachment, defilement, and karmic consciousness, thus descending to dark hells. Now to leave this home is to sever vexations forever, observe the body as empty and false, all circumstances clear, thoughts and heart movement all returning to the supreme dao, body and spirit entering the subtle, refining the substance to return to non-being, neither death nor birth, eternally attaining constant joy. This is called leaving home.

What is entering the dao? The dao has two kinds. First, the dao realm: the profound altar, numinous temple, mountain forests peaceful and orderly, under trees and in flower gardens, pure and non-acting, not mingling with the mundane world. The body ascends this place, facing the true form, mouth reciting numinous texts, no noise or disturbance, burning incense and bowing, practicing the dao and reciting scriptures, lecturing on the great vehicle, focusing and guarding oneness, abandoning the mundane world, entering this dao site, tempering heart and form, surely attaining constant joy, accomplishing true sainthood, realizing the jade purity fruit, neither coming nor going, serene and ever abiding.

Second, the dao body: upright body and quiet meditation, observing the inner body, examining one’s form, viewing all things from afar, all equally impermanent, all empty and void, dim and briefly born, suddenly transforming and vanishing, arising and ceasing, myriad dharmas never stopping, one life is not long. Carefully viewing the world, moment by moment impermanence, liking to embody the self, who is true? Know it is false combination, already complete with causes and conditions, gathering and dispersing in a moment, how can it be constant? One must preserve the three and guard the one, refine the substance to become true, long abide with the dao, escape birth and death, constant joy, pure self, realize the fruit of the dao site, transform this leaking body—this is called entering the dao.

What is abandoning the mundane? The mundane has two kinds. First, the mundane realm: Heaven and Earth, sun and moon, mountains, rivers, stones, walls, grasses, trees, insects, fish, all beings, all are things, temporarily born and dying, soon broken and destroyed, dispersed in a moment, not to be attached to, defiling and polluting the body. Know the Three Realms are all empty and false, and one can abandon them, forever severing craving.

Second, the mundane body: this body of mine, eyes, ears, nose, mouth, flesh, skin, hands, feet, hair, the hundred bones, nine orifices, all gathered and formed, called a person. Ultimately seeking, there is no place for a person. Birth, aging, sickness, and death, moment by moment impermanence, unclean and foul, temporarily dependent, why cling to this, and have notions of right and wrong, self and other? Killing, stealing, licentiousness, jealousy, stinginess, cursing, anger, flowery speech, lies, slander, evil tongues, bullying, rich and poor, invading and taking, love and hate, choosing and rejecting, all kinds of clinging, wandering in color and sound, craving fragrance and taste, always gathering gold, treasures, jade, silk, brocade, rice, wheat, grains, hoarding endlessly to fill ten thousand generations—how know that in one day the form turns to dust?

Now abandon this body, cease all attachments, eyes sever colors, ears sever sounds, nose sever fragrances, mouth sever tastes, mind sever dharmas, body sever desires, even the six roots and six consciousnesses, six desires and six thieves, six entrances and six defilements, six dusts mutually arising, thirty-six conditions, all evil roots, all abandoned, pure and clear one heart, forever sever vexations—this is called abandoning the mundane.

Summing these three, they are called daoists.

Why named daoists? Because in all actions—walking, standing, sitting, lying down, raising the heart, moving the will—only the dao is pursued; observing fasts and bowing, offering sincerity, reciting scriptures, burning incense and scattering flowers, lighting lamps and repentance, giving alms and wishing, lecturing on the great vehicle, teaching beings, generating the great dao heart, creating merit for all, after self and before others, without worldly toil, only practicing the dao work.

‘Shi’ (士) means ‘work’ or ‘affair.’ Work varies in quantity and learning differs in degree. There are seven ranks, all called daoists.

First, Heavenly True: body conforms with nature, pure inside and out.

Second, Divine Immortal: transformations unpredictable, transcending the mundane world.

Third, Secluded and Reclusive: containing light and hiding brilliance, unbound by worldly burdens.

Fourth, Mountain Dweller: quiet, hidden, silent and withdrawn, the benevolent find peace.

Fifth, Leaving Home: abandoning attachments, shedding worldly dust.

Sixth, In the World: harmonizing light and dust, embracing the dao and cherishing virtue.

Seventh, Sacrificial Wine: humbling oneself to descend to the mundane, saving and rescuing the suffering, thus gaining respect from all under heaven and earth, the Six Paths and Four Forms, worship and reverence, supreme and victorious, not paying court to emperors, nor bowing to lords, creating blessings for humans and heavens, receiving offerings from the Three Realms.

Why so? Because they receive my dharma teachings, wear my dharma robes, uphold scriptures and precepts, guide beings, so that past, present, and future three lifetimes forever escape suffering and enter the gate of constant joy. These are the parents of the dharma body of humans and heavens.

Though emperors and kings possess ten thousand nations, noble and respected among people, they cannot escape birth and death, sickness, vexation, destruction, cold and heat, or the cycle of coming and going. Yet daoists can escape these troubles.

If one leaves home without following my dharma, not wearing dharma robes; or turns away from the dao to enter the mundane, abandoning truth for falsehood; or follows heterodox teachings and evil paths, venerating foreign teachings; or pursues worldly fame and wealth, greedily seeking name and profit; or is oppressed by royal laws, officials, and private injustice, forced to remove robes, disgracing the dharma body; or abandons robes and sinks into the mundane; or is not believed or respected, insulted, cursed, beaten, and cast out from the monastic dharma body; or arises with disdain, lacking reverence and solemnity; or mocks, jokes, boasts, and arrogantly insults—such people will surely suffer diseases like scabies, falling eyebrows, swelling and decay all over, becoming loathsome to see. Or face officials, prisons, shackles and chains, pain cutting the body. Or become blind, deaf, mute, with twisted hands and lame feet, ugly and poor. Or suffer wind madness and epilepsy, evil spirits and ghosts, enemies and foes, repaying each other, sickness and pain increasing. Or be harmed by poisonous snakes, fierce beasts, water, fire, knives, soldiers, robbers, unexpected injury. Or their offspring be ugly, poor, and lowly, always lacking. Or suffer long illness, unable to live or die, always bedridden. Or be born among border barbarians, killing and fighting, day and night in terror, father and son separated. At death, straight into hell, swallowed by fire and charcoal, walking on knife mountains, climbing sword trees, bearing iron staffs, boiled in cauldrons, pounded in mortars, frozen by ice, a myriad pains cutting the body, day and night tormented, suffering all scriptures, moving through ten thousand kalpas, then reborn as beasts, poor and lowly, blind, deaf, with six diseases, all manner of suffering, cutting the body.

If after leaving home, the heart turns back, disdains dharma robes, violates scriptures and precepts, eats meat and drinks wine, kills and steals, indulges in licentiousness, does not uphold dharma form, defiles the dao gate, it is likewise so.

At this, all present voiced “Excellent!” bowed to the Heavenly Venerable, and recited:

“Excellent, Most High Venerable, compassionate and universally saving. Bestowing the Most High scriptures, the kings gain awakening. Because of this, we all generate vows, cast sincerity, forever admire. Abandon kingdoms to seek leaving home, following conditions to open the path. Receiving precepts, speaking vows, humans and heavens feel the red heart. Broadly expounding the causes and conditions dharma, entering the path of refuge. Forever creating fruits of birth and death, flowing through ten thousand kalpas. We all in assembly rejoice, drinking sweet nectar.”

If the four seasons lose their measure, yin and yang unbalanced, one must establish temples to ferry beings across. If water, fire, knives, and soldiers injure the world, one must establish temples to ferry beings across. If epidemic poisons spread and people die, one must establish temples to ferry beings across. If the ruler meets disaster and ill fortune, one must establish temples to ferry beings across. If the nation’s fate is endangered, war and upheaval arise, one must establish temples to ferry beings across. If first ascending the throne, transforming and governing the people, one must establish temples to ferry beings across. If ruling the world, the land is unsettled, one must establish temples to ferry beings across. If birthing sons and daughters, sickness and calamity, one must establish temples to ferry beings across. For all disasters and anomalies, all dangers and sufferings, one must establish temples to ferry beings across. Whether for parents, oneself, wife and children, subjects and people, ancestors past, living or deceased, or for the Three Paths, one must establish temples to ferry beings across.

Establishing temples to ferry beings across dispels heavenly disasters, stabilizes the nation’s fate, protects emperors, dispels poisons and harms, opens the path for the people, granting birth and death blessings. Its merit is lofty and vast, universally today and all times, causing all to take refuge, merit boundless, inconceivable.

The Dao speaks: Those who leave home create fields of merit in birth and death, receiving superior rewards from humans and heavens. They must always be worshipped and supported, given what they need: clothing, bedding, playthings, utensils, incense, oil, tables, scepters, carriages, servants, halls, houses, terraces, pavilions, towers, flower forests, medicinal gardens, baths, orchards, food and drink, treasures and silks, banners, flowers, lamps, bells, chimes, dharma implements, incense burners, washing pots, scepters, dusters—whatever they have, used for giving alms, supporting the monastic dharma body, enabling peace and joy.

Open wisdom, turn to reading honored scriptures, bow and burn incense, observe fasts and uphold precepts, build precious seats, lecture on the great vehicle, always for rulers, ministers, and all people, all beings, create fields of merit for three lifetimes.

Emperors, kings, ministers, and people who lack faith, curse, insult, blame, oppress, imprison, damage the dharma body, injure or kill, whip and torment, disgrace dharma robes, force entry into the mundane, suffer scabies, myriad calamities, past souls and spirits directly enter hell, endure sufferings without end.

If those who leave home love insult, do not uphold dharma form, harbor hatred and disdain, causing beings to lose faith, in past lives were pigs, dogs, snakes, and vipers.

You men and women, be cautious, be cautious.

The Dao speaks: You men and women, better to strip five hundred people of their clothes than to remove one dharma robe of a monastic. Better to harm all evil people than to harm one monastic dharma body. Better to offend three thousand fierce beasts than to offend one monastic. Better to disgrace five thousand strong men than to disgrace one monastic. Better to lightly deceive ten thousand evil ghosts than to lightly deceive one monastic. Better to sit amidst great fire than to share a seat with a monastic. Better to lie on a hot iron bed than to share a bed with a monastic. Better to touch fifty thousand poisonous snakes than to touch a monastic’s dharma robe. Better to blow a great mountain into dust than to speak against a monastic. Better to swallow ten thousand measures of fierce fire than to eat the flesh of a monastic. Better to toil in ten thousand zhangs of filth than to violate a monastic.

Why? Because leaving home is the Most High Venerable’s disciple, upholding and glorifying the scriptures. Leaving home is the supreme dharma master for all humans and heavens. Leaving home is the bridge over birth and death for all beings. Leaving home is the refuge and parent for all people. Leaving home is the cause of good for rulers and kings. Leaving home is the power to save of the Nine Profound and Seven Ancestors. Leaving home is the arising of the immortal sages and saints’ original heart. Leaving home is the boat of the other shore beyond the Three Paths and Five Pains.

Receiving offerings and faith from rulers, kings, parents, and kin, the heavenly demon kings, the Three Realms’ ghosts and spirits bow and submit, calling themselves low officials receiving instruction in the monastic dharma gate.

Why? To receive the Most High Venerable’s final teachings, practice his scriptures and dharma, recite his dharma words, wear his precept talismans, hold his talismanic diagrams.

Always there are the Three Realms’ Five Emperors, generals, officials, and soldiers guarding and escorting; those who offend them incur punishment.

If rulers, kings, ministers, and people can generate good hearts and leave home to enter the dao, the nine ancestors and grandparents ascend the upper heavenly palace, and seven generations of descendants do not enter hell.

If daoists widely encourage those with karmic ties to leave home, one person counts as one thousand five hundred, three or more attain immortal rank, worldly joy, natural clothing and food, born previously in heaven, with endless blessings.

The Dao speaks: You men and women, having left home, must protect the dharma robe, respect masters and the dao, uphold sincere scriptures, diligently cultivate the work, bow and burn incense, long fasts and uphold precepts, recite scriptures and practice the dao, lecture on the great vehicle, widely attain merit, mutually open salvation, use parables to transform beings, uphold and glorify the dharma teachings, always practice compassion, save all, deeply study the supreme dao, turn spirit into subtlety, ever abiding, moment by moment advancing, never falling back, able to attain true dao.

The Dao speaks: You men and women, all from countless kalpas past, have abandoned and received bodies, practiced good daos, upheld fasts and precepts, now having left home, must know the karmic causes of birth and body.

Humans inherit past merits, the power of the dao, born among humans, lodged in parents’ wombs, harmoniously combined green, two halves forming the body, patterned by Heaven and shaped by Earth, fully equipped with six roots, receiving primordial qi, generating and transforming myriad spirits, moving yin and yang, filling the whole form: eyes, ears, nose, mouth, bones, joints, skin, organs, blood vessels, internally and externally connected, gathering true qi, nourishing and guarding five spirits, achieving firmness.

The inner root is one source, the sun and moon flow and shine, generating and transforming myriad spirits, three origins and eight aspects, endless transformations, internal and external combined, thirty-six thousand from beginning to end, orderly in sequence.

Now I tell you, you must know this.

When a person first receives the fetus, causes and dao are one, Heaven and Earth, yin and yang, each half.

Before the body forms, lodged in parents’ womb, nine heavens construct qi, three origins arrange spirits.

One month is called the embryo—‘embryo’ means wrapped—primordial qi wraps, gathering mixed yellow, turning and generating transformation, inside is true essence.

Two months is the fetus—‘fetus’ means expanding—spirit rides karmic fate, descends into the parents’ body, constructs yin and yang, expands the form.

Three months is the soul—‘soul’ means cloud—pure essence of yang, thin and giving birth to spirit, clouds that do not stay, turning and managing.

Four months is the corporeal soul—‘corporeal soul’ means mooring—pure qi of yin, condensing spirit to stabilize form, moored and quiet, to fix the body.

Five months is the organs—‘organs’ means to hide—yin and yang have form, Five Phases arrayed, placing five organs: liver, heart, spleen, lungs, kidneys, to house five spirits, govern myriad spirits, generate and transform one body.

Six months is the bowels—‘bowels’ means to gather—accumulating pure fluids, irrigating the five spirits, large and small intestines, stomach, gallbladder, bladder, excreting grains and fluids, forming the hundred bodies.

Seven months is the orifices—‘orifices’ means to connect—entrance and exit for seeing and hearing, internally and externally bright.

Eight months is the aspects—‘aspects’ means alert—three parts and eight aspects, alert and guarding the body.

Nine months the spirits are complete: Heaven, Earth, sun, moon, stars, Five Phases, four seasons generating and transforming, all spirits, internal and external combined, entering and exiting the body, upper and lower three parts, circling three palaces, myriad beings eight thousand, wrapping and reflecting shadows, at once born body, golden hall, jade chamber, twelve-layered tower, purple gate, jade pavilion, sun, moon, stars, Five Great Mountains, Four Lakes, patterned Earth, patterned Heaven, perfectly complete, filling the whole body.

Ten months, Heaven and Earth gods, Five Emperors and Four Officers, Nine Heavens’ marshals, Ten Directions’ good spirits, immortal youths and jade maidens, all at once oversee, Great One guards the carriage, Mysterious Mother guards the chamber, moving Heaven and Earth, all saints rejoice, Life Controller registers the book, Heavenly Emperor fixes the years, according to karmic fate, receiving retribution without error, protecting form and guarding spirit, pure heart and nature, transforming and refining dross and stagnation, renewing good deeds, communicating with spirits by dao, nurturing form by virtue, form and spirit harmonizing, returning to emptiness, neither born nor dead, eternally abiding.

Humans must cherish form and spirit, carefully not damaging them. You daoists must preserve form and spirit, cherish and nourish essence and qi, not damage hair or skin, internally complete spirit, externally equipped with form. Head crowned with lotus, feet tread Mount Tai, middle enveloped by sun and moon, four symbols distinct, Heaven and Earth within the body, sun and moon preserving the body, having dao to follow, having virtue to honor, all things obey, all take refuge—thus called dharma robe, the monastic dharma body.

The Dao speaks: After my passing, in the latter half kalpa of the former emperor, there will be heterodox teachings and ghostly paths, not following my teachings, making their own methods, people believe and follow, the world submits, damaging form and destroying body, accumulating wealth, widely making images, building vast houses, falsely claiming saintly fruits and past blessings, indulging in lust and deceit, confusing and disturbing people’s hearts, gradually spreading, men and women revering, never awakening, nations broken, families destroyed, bodies perished, clans scattered, one after another; the whole world sunk in delusion, never awakening.

At such times, my dharma will greatly decline, people unwilling to practice, only revering ghostly laws, the teaching of extinction, long life and long sight, yet not believing. Alas, alas! Daoists ignorant also follow, practicing these laws, never having immortal shares or hopes of long life. Can you not be cautious?

Why? Because these are yin teachings and ghostly paths, laws of death and extinction. Like rotten grain, no sign of life; like rotten soil, cannot produce life; like dead ashes, still smoldering or not; like withered wood, can it flourish again? Dispersed and rotten, turning to manure—this is the teaching of extinction and non-birth.

The world regards birth as good, death as evil, all desire life, all mourn death. Therefore I teach the method of long life, so beings do not die, eternally enduring. But because beings are confused and cannot believe, death and decay arise, and they seek the teaching of death and extinction—can this not be mistaken?

Moreover, the dead do not need to learn. Therefore the immortal dao values preserving the body, the ghostly dao values extinguishing the form. The immortal dao values brightness, the ghostly dao values darkness. The immortal dao values long abiding, the ghostly dao values disappearance. The immortal dao values purity and emptiness, the ghostly dao values filth and disgrace. The immortal dao values security, the ghostly dao values floating danger. The immortal dao values having a body, the ghostly dao values no form.

Those with the dao live long without action, refining spirit into subtlety, returning to the great dao, form and spirit harmonizing, eternally abiding and not perishing. Those without a body die and vanish to dust, form decays, spirit departs, sinking into nine nights, dark and obscure.

You daoists, should take this to heart. Therefore I have foretold, so those with heart may know.

The Dao speaks: After my passing, there will be daoists wearing dharma robes, appearing as monastics, but with truly evil hearts, eating meat and drinking wine, killing and stealing, licentious and chaotic, committing all evils. Specializing in minor paths, greedy for fame and profit, attacking root and cutting origin, turning from right to wrong, not believing in the true immortal long-life dharma, but seeking evil teachings of death and extinction, thousands and thousands.

I will send the Five Heavenly Demon Kings to successively destroy them.

The Dao speaks: There are daoists, men and women, who uphold scriptures and precepts, bow and burn incense, give alms to save the poor, build numinous temples, copy scriptures and cast images, lecture and open enlightenment, lead and receive the sincere-hearted, swallowing saliva, preserving the three and guarding the one, extinguishing doubt and thought, aspiring to true immortality and the method of undying, sincere and without retreat.

I send the heavenly spirit officials and nine Earth supervisors to teach them the great dharma, further receive true scriptures, divine elixirs and numinous medicines, immortal mushrooms and jade blossoms, prolonging life and transforming, refining substance and changing spirit, the path of permanence.

According to their study, they are summoned into the immortal palaces, Five Great Mountains and grotto heavens, gradually attaining spiritual communication, turning spirit into subtlety, soaring through the heavens.

Such learners are difficult to measure in the world; the immortal dao is hidden and unknown to people.

These kings and their families, immortal sages and saints, all at once praised “Excellent!” bowed their heads and withdrew.
