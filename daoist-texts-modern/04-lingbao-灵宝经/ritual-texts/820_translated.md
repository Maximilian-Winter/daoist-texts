## The Sublime Profound Numinous Treasure Scripture of the Various Heavens’ Numinous Books for Deliverance of Fate

In the era of the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, within the Great Blessing Hall Kingdom’s Chang Le Abode, he sat together with the great saints of the various heavens and the flying heavenly divine kings, all seated upon seven-colored precious clouds. At that time, the Primordial said to the Supreme Dao Lord: “Have you heard the sound of sorrowful weeping anywhere in the borderlands of the Great Blessing Hall Kingdom in the Ten Directions?” The Dao Lord bowed deeply and reported to the Heavenly Worthy: “Entering this realm for seven million five hundred thousand kalpas, I have not heard any lamentation or sorrow in this land. I cannot fathom the reason for this.” The Heavenly Worthy further asked the Dao Lord: “Have you heard the music of strings and joyous sounds?” The Dao Lord bowed and answered: “Since the men and women of this land came into being, for seven million five hundred thousand kalpas, they have not perceived their forms aging. Whether male or female, all share the same visage. Born thus, dwelling in blessing, they are ever free of worry or grief, delighting only in joy.” Then the Primordial Heavenly Worthy smiled gently and emitted five-colored radiance from his mouth, illuminating a kingdom’s land. Within the light, the Numinous Treasure True Script shone with brilliant colors, radiantly illuminating the five directions. The Dao Lord knelt long, bowed his head in reverence, and wished to hear its essence.

The Primordial Heavenly Worthy replied: “Do you see the True Script within the light? This script emerged in the Dragon Han years upon this land. At that time, together with the Most High Great Saint Jade Emperor, ten volumes of marvelous scriptures were composed, issuing laws to save people. Hence this land is named the Great Blessing Hall Kingdom’s Chang Le Abode, where numinous sounds resound and grace the Ten Directions. Therefore, the men and women of this land live long lives, without premature death, free from all suffering, untroubled by worry or vexation, never falling into the Three Paths, never passing through the gates of the Eight Hardships. There is no sound of sorrowful weeping, only the music of joy. Those born into this world who encounter the Dao and scriptures truly have the karmic connection of countless kalpas past. Their fate is free of calamity—how could this not be joyous? The reason I smiled earlier was because the people of this land do not know whence their joy arises, nor do they know that other lands are filled with sorrow and grief. After I depart, the True Script will be hidden; the cycle of deliverance will hasten; the five turbidities will rage and compete; myriad evils will converge. Those born then will be born into it, willingly accepting guilt, wandering through the Five Paths, enduring the Eight Hardships, harming one another, beset by worry and vexation, unable to see the scriptures or encounter the sacred texts, left to the whims of birth and death—truly pitiable. I deeply pity these beings who do not know the karmic calamities they have inherited, nor the source whence they come. Now I shall speak to the future generations of the ten volumes of marvelous scriptures to deliver both heavens and humans. You must diligently apply your mind, receive with correct intent, and do not forget these words.”

Thus, the Supreme Dao Lord immediately arose, bowed repeatedly, and humbly received the command. At that time, all the saints rejoiced. The Primordial Heavenly Worthy, within the Chang Le Abode, spoke the Numinous Treasure True Script, issuing laws to save people, beginning with this kingdom. At that time, the infinitely true great saints of the boundless worlds of the Ten Directions, flying heavenly divine kings, and marvelous practitioners without number gathered together at once. The kingdom’s land was all molten gold poured upon the earth; the four borders’ stairways were adorned with precious jade and lapis lazuli, encircling in perfect order, radiating light that penetrated all. The Daoist teachings expanded, delivering countless people. Therefore this kingdom is named the Great Blessing Hall Kingdom. Those born here have no injury to their fate, no suffering of heart, no worries of body; their actions accord with their wishes, and at life’s end they attain deliverance into the Vermilion Tomb. At that time, men and women with intention all attained deliverance. The Great Blessing Hall Kingdom’s land was perfected, and the Daoist practice extended to the Eastern Extreme Blue Void Sky Song Great Floating Li Kingdom.

The Primordial Heavenly Worthy, upon the Blue Void Sky Song Great Floating Li Kingdom, sat atop the Blue Mist. At that time, the Eastern Boundless Great Saints, flying heavenly divine kings, supremely true great gods, Anbao Hualin Qingling Elder, Cangdi Jiuci Heavenly Lord, Supreme True King, Blue Waist Jade Maidens, and the various spiritual officials of the Eastern Village, countless in number, gathered all at once. The kingdom’s terrain was uniformly level, without height or depth. The earth was all blue jade; the four borders’ stairways were all adorned with gold, silver, and precious jewels, perfectly arranged, shining brilliantly.

Then the Primordial Heavenly Worthy said to the Cangdi Lord: “Is this kingdom one where immortality is learned? What marvelous methods exist? Do you know the karmic causes of fate?” The Cangdi Lord bowed and reported to the Heavenly Worthy: “Since entering this realm for nine million nine hundred thousand kalpas, there have been no practitioners of immortality; all are naturally undying. This kingdom has various marvels: trees of blue forest whose leaves naturally bear purple script. When the wind blows and the trees move, their sounds form profound chapters; the numinous music shines brilliantly, resounding through the vast sky. Above them always fly nine-colored phoenix birds; when these birds sing, all men and women of the kingdom bow in reverence to their sound. When a bird sheds a feather, whoever obtains it can immediately fly. The men and women of this kingdom never age, never grieve or worry, never endure suffering or vexation, living only in joy, unaware of the source of their fate. Born into this era, truly a karmic connection of past lives.”

The Primordial Heavenly Worthy said to the Cangdi Lord: “In the past Dragon Han years, the Numinous Treasure True Script emerged in this kingdom to issue laws to save people. The Most High Great Saint composed marvelous scriptures with the Jade Emperor, writing with purple brush upon the sky-blue forest. Hence when the wind blows the trees, their sounds form music. The nine-colored birds always feed on the leaves, their bodies adorned with patterns; thus those who obtain their feathers can fly. At that time, all attained true Dao. After I depart, the cycle of deliverance will hasten; wars and disasters will follow; Heaven and humans will suffer; willingly accepting guilt, wandering through the Five Paths and Eight Hardships, they will not encounter this life nor see the scriptures and teachings. The pain will be great. Therefore I now speak this scripture, so that the men and women of this land may know the source of their undying years, opening the root of deliverance for future generations. You all diligently apply your minds and truly understand my words.” The Cangdi Lord bowed and humbly received the command; all saints in the assembly rejoiced. At that time, the Blue Void Sky Song Great Floating Li Kingdom’s land was perfected, and the Daoist practice extended to the Southern Extreme.

The Southern Extreme Hui Li World’s Vermilion Bright Kingdom

The Primordial Heavenly Worthy, within the Hui Li World’s Vermilion Bright Kingdom, sat upon the Crimson Cloud. At that time, the Southern Boundless Great Saints, flying heavenly divine kings, supremely true great gods, Fanbao Changyang Danling Elder, Chi Emperor Three Qi Heavenly Lord, Three Qi Elder, Vermilion Palace Great Elixir Jade Maiden, and the various spiritual officials of the Southern Village, countless in number, gathered all at once in the Danhuo’s Three Primal Cavern. The kingdom’s land was all the color of cinnabar, constantly generating red qi, like crimson clouds. The four borders’ stairways were all lapis lazuli and precious jewels, shining brilliantly, radiantly illuminating the kingdom.

At that time, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy asked the Chi Emperor Three Qi Heavenly Lord: “What is the lifespan of the people of this land?” The Three Qi Heavenly Lord bowed and answered: “Since residing in this realm for three million three hundred thousand kalpas, I have not heard any sound of sorrow or grief, only seeing people who do not age.” The Heavenly Worthy further asked: “What marvelous methods cause this?” The Three Qi Heavenly Lord bowed and replied: “This kingdom has a courtyard of hollow intestines and a fire-refining pool. The people visit the fire pool three times a year, refining themselves with fire essence, polishing and adorning their forms. Therefore, there are those who do not age. Above is the Southern Palace Lord of Life, who guards the registry of human lives, so there is no sound of weeping over corpses. They do not know whence their origin is; they only wish the Heavenly Worthy to reveal what is unknown.”

The Primordial Heavenly Worthy said: “The reason this land has the courtyard of unified yang and the flowing fire pool is that when the Numinous Treasure True Script first opened, before the characters were clear, I was together with the Most High Great Saint Jade Emperor in this kingdom, refining the True Script with fire, causing the characters to shine forth, their colors brilliant, illuminating the five directions. Hence this land is called the Vermilion Bright Kingdom. The fire essence flows and gathers into the courtyard of unified yang. Therefore, people in the fire courtyard undergo fire refinement, causing them not to age. Those in the courtyard now all have the merit of the True Script. The method is wondrous and profound. Above is placed the Southern Palace Lord of Life, who manages the registry of human lives, refining death and delivering life. Thus this kingdom has no sound of weeping over corpses. Born into this era, truly joyous! After I depart, the true scriptures will be hidden; the heavenly cycle will hasten; the five turbidities will contend; poisons will flow among Heaven and humans; men and women will be devastated; willingly accepting guilt, wandering through the Five Paths and Eight Hardships, they will not see the bright teachings nor encounter the true scriptures. Therefore I now speak this marvelous scripture to future generations, granting you the True Script, so that this kingdom may know the source whence immortals and long life arise, opening the karmic connection for men and women of the restored world. Diligently apply your mind and do not forget my words.” Thus the Chi Emperor Three Qi Heavenly Lord bowed and humbly received the command. The saints then made obeisance and departed. At that time, the Hui Li World’s Vermilion Bright Jade Kingdom was perfected, and the Daoist practice extended to the Western Extreme.

The Western Extreme Wei Luo Great Blessing Hall World’s Western Na Jade Kingdom

The Primordial Heavenly Worthy, within the Great Blessing Hall World’s Western Na Jade Kingdom, sat beneath the Yu Cha Mountain’s Floating Luo Peak, under the seven-treasure lofty tree. The Western Boundless Great Saints, flying heavenly divine kings, supremely true great gods, Seven Treasure Golden Gate Hao Ling Elder, White Emperor Seven Qi Heavenly Lord, Ming Shi Seven Qi Elder, Supreme White Plain Jade Maiden, and the various spiritual officials of the Western Village, countless in number, gathered all at once on Floating Luo Peak. The kingdom’s land was all white jade, with golden steps; the four sides were adorned with treasures, shining brilliantly, illuminating the kingdom. The kingdom’s elegant music and marvelous sounds gathered beautifully; various marvels abounded; the sounds of forest trees, birds, and beasts had jade-like melodies; golden pools flowed with essence, delivering the entire kingdom’s people. This kingdom was named the Ultimate Bliss Kingdom.

The Primordial Heavenly Worthy then asked the White Emperor Heavenly Lord: “Why is this kingdom named Ultimate Bliss? What marvels exist that there is no sorrow or grief?” The White Emperor Heavenly Lord bowed and answered: “Since entering this realm for seven million kalpas, only elegant music and harmonious sounds have been heard; no sorrowful cries from the people. Men and women all have faces of golden radiance. The forest has seven-treasure lofty trees, bearing red fruit with white rings. Above them are phoenixes and peacocks with golden wings, who sing their elegant sounds six times a day, day and night. Lions and white deer roar and sing harmoniously. Nearby are golden essence and jade pools for refining ointments. Flying heavenly immortals bathe in them thrice a year. The flowing essence and mysterious pools universally deliver countless beings. Therefore, this kingdom is named Ultimate Bliss. They do not know whence their origin is; they only wish the Heavenly Worthy to reveal what is unknown.”

The Heavenly Worthy said: “In the past Dragon Han years, I, together with the Primordial Heavenly King and Most High Jade Emperor, encountered the Numinous Treasure True Script upon this land, issuing laws to save people atop the Floating Luo Void Mountain. Phoenixes, peacocks, and golden-winged birds flew over the ridges. In an instant, suddenly five-colored radiance illuminated a land, revealing hidden and manifest alike. Upon the Void Mountain, I expounded the True Script, composing ten volumes of marvelous scriptures, beginning here to issue laws to save people, wishing to let the Dharma’s sound flow and transform future generations. The teachings expanded. At that time, people and birds and beasts all received deliverance. Therefore, the birds constantly utter extraordinary elegant sounds; hearing their music, all naturally awaken to the Dao, generate good hearts, and practice good thoughts. All men and women of the kingdom attain true Dao. Being born in this kingdom is due to karmic merit from seven hundred kalpas past, with good names recorded in the heavenly lands, causing birth here. The kingdom has divine birds that sing elegant sounds six times a day, named Ultimate Bliss Kingdom. Born into this era, they have immeasurable blessings. After I depart, the true scriptures will be hidden; the heavenly cycle will hasten; the kingdom will be destroyed; future generations will be devastated; they will not encounter scriptures or teachings, drifting through the five sufferings and eight hardships, men and women dying young, great pain indeed. Therefore I now speak this scripture, so that the people of this land may know the karmic roots of their past lives, opening the crossing for future generations to deliver them. Understand my words clearly, diligently apply your mind.” The Seven Qi Heavenly Lord bowed and received the command; all saints rejoiced. At that time, the Wei Luo Great Blessing Hall World’s Western Na Jade Kingdom was perfected, and the Daoist practice extended to the Northern Extreme.

The Northern Extreme Yuan Fu Qi Xian World’s Yu Dan Kingdom

The Primordial Heavenly Worthy, upon the Northern Ridge of the Yu Dan Kingdom in the Yuan Fu Qi Xian World, sat atop five-colored mysterious clouds. The Northern Boundless Great Saints, flying heavenly divine kings, supremely true great gods, Five Qi Mysterious Heaven Dong Yin Shuo Dan Yu Jue Five Spirit Mysterious Elders, Black Emperor Heavenly Lord, Mysterious Nourishing Five Qi Heavenly Lord, Supreme Spirit Lord, Night Light Jade Maiden, and various spiritual officials of the Northern Village, countless in number, gathered all at once on the Northern Ridge. The kingdom’s land was all condensed water essence, with lapis lazuli saturating the earth. The kingdom had a sealed pool, five hundred li in length and breadth. The pool contained flowing essence jade mushrooms, within which was a natural mysterious cavernous pavilion. The pavilion was as tall as the clouds, fifty li in circumference, with golden carved inscriptions all around, naming the pavilion on all four sides. The place was dark and dim; no light reached the four sides; it was always like the dark night, unseen by people. The men and women of the kingdom drank the pool’s water; their faces were like jade and fat; initially free of illness and sorrow; they lived three ten-thousand years without premature death. After death, their bones did not turn to ash; for ten thousand years they did not decay or smell. The kingdom had no rites or music, only knowing straightforward hearts. This kingdom is named the Land of No Affliction.

The Heavenly Worthy asked the Black Emperor Heavenly Lord: “Why is this kingdom named the Land of No Affliction? What marvelous methods exist?” The Black Emperor Heavenly Lord bowed and answered: “Since entering this realm for five million kalpas, within one kalpa’s cycle, the mysterious pavilion appears bright and clear; after the kalpa passes, it darkens. Below the pavilion is a cold pool. The men and women of the kingdom drink and eat there; their faces are like jade, without signs of aging or illness. They live their full years; after death, their bodies do not turn to ash. Therefore it is named the Land of No Affliction. The men and women of this land only know birth; they do not know whence they come, yet obtain such longevity. They only wish the Heavenly Worthy to reveal what is unknown.”

The Heavenly Worthy smiled gently, emitting five-colored radiance from his mouth, illuminating a kingdom. The mysterious pavilion appeared bright and clear, transparent on all sides, like midday sun. The city and palace shone with brilliant colors, beyond description. The people of the kingdom were filled with boundless joy. The Heavenly Worthy said: “The Numinous Treasure True Script first issued laws to save people in this land. I sealed the heavenly script within this pavilion, hence its name, the Mysterious Pavilion. Below the pavilion is the cold pool, all flowing with numinous crossings. Therefore, people drink the pool water and gain years without death. After I depart, the pavilion’s scriptures will return to the Yu Dan boundless heavens. The heavenly cycle will hasten; myriad disasters will arise; premature death and injury will afflict Heaven and humans; future generations will be devastated; they will not encounter scriptures or teachings; drifting through the five sufferings is unbearable to behold. Therefore I now speak this scripture, so that the people of this land may know the source of their karmic fate, opening the crossing for future men and women to deliver them. Those with good hearts should be granted the text, so that they may live and deliver suffering amid myriad disasters. Understand my words clearly, receive them truly, and diligently practice; do not be negligent and mislead future generations.” The Black Emperor Heavenly Lord bowed and received the command; none in the kingdom were not joyful.

The Heavenly Worthy said to the Supreme Dao Lord: “The Five Elder Emperor Lords and the Numinous Treasure have karmic connections through countless kalpas of life and death, meeting each lifetime, teaching without end. The True Script was given to each of the Five Elder Emperor Lords, each receiving a complete marvelous scripture and secret formula, stabilizing the five directions. Their kingdoms are full of blessings and virtue, causing men and women to live long lives without premature death or injury, all attaining their years, free from worry or suffering, never enduring the Eight Hardships, their forms without aging, the kingdom without sorrowful sounds, only filled with wondrous elegant music. The kingdom’s joy is passed down kalpa after kalpa. Other kingdoms and foreign lands in the four directions lack such blessings. Men and women there do not see scriptures or teachings, do not know karmic fate, drifting through birth and death, wandering the Five Paths without return. The lack of universal blessing is truly pitiable. Now I shall again widely open the Dharma teachings to universally deliver the various heavens, so that men and women of these mixed borderlands and foreign lands may all turn their hearts, enter my Dharma gate, be rescued from suffering and the Eight Hardships, and see all goodness, none failing to change their hearts. The Seven Patriarchs will receive their blessing and return to human birth; blessings will spread everywhere, and the world will rejoice.”

The Heavenly Worthy perfected the five-direction lands, delivering all people, all receiving the bright teachings. Each one naturally aroused good hearts and intentions, thinking of the great Dharma, not violating scriptures or precepts, not practicing evil, not committing illegality, their bodies without a speck of impurity. Universally practicing compassion, revering and obeying the spirits, respecting elders and loving the young, acting in accord with nature, causing their lives to be long and forms without aging. The Dharma’s sound expanded; the various heavens revered it. Foreseeing these mixed borderlands and foreign lands of short life and lacking blessings, wherever the Dharma was heard, all were delivered and lived long lives, none not rejoicing. At that time, men and women all came to submit and take refuge. The Heavenly Worthy then returned to the Chang Le Abode. These mixed lands, large and small, poured in, impossible to forbid.

The Heavenly Worthy then closed the heavenly light for three days and three nights, so that the light would not shine. He gathered wood to a height of about two hundred zhang. The Heavenly Worthy sat upon the woodpile, burning himself with fire. The fire blazed, illuminating the four directions, brightly revealing the various kingdoms. Men and women from afar saw the Heavenly Worthy sitting on the fire, unable to approach and reveal their hearts. The Heavenly Worthy wished to observe their hearts, thus told those who came: “If you desire longevity, enter the fire and receive the Dharma with me.” Those with devoted hearts and great longing for the great Dharma, numbering seventy-two thousand four hundred and fifty, cast themselves into the fire, all reaching the Dao before him. The Heavenly Worthy then bestowed the scriptures and Dharma within the fire, granting it as they entered; their bodies were all delivered, then they disappeared invisibly. Those who did not enter numbered four hundred thousand; seeing those who entered could not come out, all said they burned to death, so they retreated and returned to their homelands. Those who entered first arrived at home; those who did not enter came later. When reunited, they lamented and sighed, regretting beyond measure. Those delivered all gained longevity, bodies free of pain, forms not aging, living all thirty thousand years until death. Those with good hearts diligently cultivated scriptures and teachings, all attained deliverance.

The Heavenly Worthy said to the Supreme Dao Lord: “In the Dragon Han era, I was the formless ever-present lord, emerging to teach and transform. At that time there was Heaven and Earth, sun and moon shining, the Three Phenomena complete. There were men and women, birth and death; though yin and yang existed, there were no rites or ceremonies, nor the five flavors or clothing. Chaos spontaneously generated. I used the Dao’s transformation as a metaphor, gradually awakening and enlightening, teaching benevolence and righteousness, returning hearts to faith. At that time, lifespans were all long. Those who did not believe in the Dharma had short lives. After I departed, Heaven and Earth were destroyed; darkness prevailed for countless kalpas, no light for eons, above no colors, below no abyss. Winds and marshes opened voids, dim and obscure, formless and shadowless, boundless and infinite. Chaos without end, called Yan Kang. Until the Vermilion Bright opening of light, Heaven and Earth restored, yin and yang began, people were complete, and birth and death existed. I again emerged, called the Nameless Lord, teaching through the Numinous Treasure, delivering heavens and humans. At that time men and women had utmost sincerity and longing, upheld scriptures and precepts without weariness, all attained true Dao, their bodies and bones flying, moving naturally through emptiness. Even those not attaining Dao lived long lives, dying ascending to Heaven, reborn lifetime after lifetime, the turning wheel unextinguished, later all becoming immortals. After I departed, within one kalpa’s cycle, Heaven and Earth were again destroyed, light vanished. Within five kalpas, dim and obscure, the three qi and chaos mixed, born from the cycle. Until the Kai Huang era, the Numinous Treasure True Script opened the Three Phenomena, Heaven and Earth restored, five writings shone brightly, sun, moon, and stars illuminated. Thus the four seasons and five phases, yin and yang were born. I, within the Primordial Azure Heaven, called the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, opened and expanded the Dharma teachings, perfecting the heavens. People first appeared, men and women simple and honest, tying knots to walk, without rites or ceremonies, no five flavors, no clothing, no five colors, no writings; naked and exposed, mingling with birds and beasts. Using the Dao to transform, gradually hearts arose, knowing benevolence and righteousness, rites and music revived, covering forms and tastes, blending with the Five Phases. Thus the teachings spread, Dharma sounds flowed, scriptures widely disseminated, admonishing the ignorant, returning hearts to faith, gradually entering the Dharma gate.

At that time, the Heavenly Worthy traveled to the western river’s edge, sitting upon the Weak Water, emitting five-colored light from his mouth, universally illuminating the heavens and the borderlands of the four directions, everywhere seeing the light. The Heavenly Worthy divided his form into millions, appearing everywhere simultaneously. Men and women everywhere saw the Heavenly Worthy within the five-colored light as if in the same place. Wherever they were, elders and youths, men and women all went to bow. The Heavenly Worthy followed their lands; from his mouth he emitted the Numinous Treasure’s five volumes of True Script, radiantly shining beyond description. He spoke the ten volumes of marvelous scriptures, granting precepts and prohibitions. He declared to men and women: “If you desire longevity, come to register your name, sign the cinnabar script iron contract, bite your arm and swear blood, vow faith and devotion, receive the Dharma and depart.” At that time, men and women of all ages from the borderlands of the four directions all turned their hearts, bringing gold, silver, brocade, five-colored patterned silks, pearls, jade, and treasures, countless beyond measure, coming to the Heavenly Worthy. They humbly received the Dharma precepts and revered the marvelous scriptures. For seven days and seven nights, the radiance shone brightly; the four directions returned to normal. The kingdoms’ precious faith filled the entire kingdom. The Heavenly Worthy at once bestowed upon the poor, filling the hungry; the rich lacked nothing; poor and rich were equal; no one harbored resentment. The heavenly records noted those with prior good merit and names in the registers, all attained deliverance, flying through the vast sky. Upon entering the Dharma gate, all lived long lives of thirty-six thousand years. By the first year of the Supreme Emperor, the forms of men and women in the heavens changed to pure simplicity, but their hearts gradually grew lax and corrupt. Fearing decay and decline, the orthodox teachings incomplete, therefore I fashioned my body and kingdoms to perfect their hearts. After I depart, within half a kalpa, future men and women’s hearts will be broken and corrupted, turning to suspicion and discord, disbelieving scriptures and teachings, generating jealousy and harm, competing for victory, attacking one another, speaking falsely, creating their own methods, disrespecting Heaven and Earth, slighting the spirits, killing, lusting, and performing improper rites, praying to evil spirits. Men and women will curse one another, indulge in lust, steal without cause, unwilling to accept karmic fate, bringing injury upon themselves, entering evil paths, enduring suffering and hardship, living short lives filled with worry and vexation, wandering the Three Paths and Five Ways. Born and dying by themselves, calamities following one another, flesh and bone separated, truly heartbreaking. Now I speak this scripture to deliver those who can be delivered in future generations. Those with good hearts should clearly receive and listen, deeply remember my words.” The Supreme Dao Lord bowed and accepted the command.

The Heavenly Worthy said: “I have observed the heavens from countless kalpas past until today. The highest saints and great gods who have attained Dao in the upper heavens, as well as the true immortals of the heavens, the Three Pure Ones, the Nine Palaces, the Five Peaks, and the flying immortals, all have received deliverance through the Numinous Treasure, only thus becoming true immortals. Next, observing the Southern Hill Vermilion Palace and the Nine Spirit Blessing Halls, the heavens provide karmic blessings; souls and spirits naturally receive heavenly cuisine. None fail to uphold the Numinous Treasure in the world, practicing fasting and precepts, generating natural hearts, performing merits and virtues, attaining deliverance and ascending to the Blessing Halls to partake of heavenly cuisine. This scripture is honored and marvelous, delivering countless beings. At the great kalpa’s turning, Heaven collapses and Earth sinks, the four seas merge into darkness, gold and jade dissolve, myriad Dao powers end, but this scripture alone remains, its Dharma unbroken. All other miscellaneous methods—breathing exercises, health cultivation techniques, transformation scriptures, and scattered popular texts—are all within the Six Heavens and the Desire Realm. When the small kalpa comes, their methods all perish without remainder. The miscellaneous talismanic charts of the Great Clarity, the Great Peace Daoist scriptures, miscellaneous Daoist techniques, and minor scriptures all circulate within the eighteen heavens above and below, within the Form Realm. At the great kalpa’s turning, Heaven and Earth change cycles, their texts vanish without remainder. The Jade Clarity Upper Dao, the Three Caverns Divine Scriptures, Divine True Tiger Script, Golden and Jade Characters, and the Numinous Treasure True Scriptures all issued from the Primordial, residing above the Twenty-Eight Heavens in the Formless realm. At the great kalpa’s turning, their texts all return to the supreme Great Luo’s Jade Capital Mountain’s seven-treasure mysterious platform, beyond the reach of disaster. The Great Luo Heaven is the heaven above the five hundred million five thousand five hundred and fifty-five heavens. Therefore, the Great Profound True Scripture, Numinous Treasure Profound Scripture, Profound Void, Profound Nonbeing, the Scripture of Nature, rise and fall with the cycles, encompassing all scriptures, the sect of the heavens. The determined cultivator who long cultivates attains immortality, eternal life, and delivers the world, flying by day, riding dragon chariots, penetrating the void. Those who can uphold it, offering reverence and support, the Seven Patriarchs ascend Heaven, turning the wheel as holy kings, generation after generation without end, connected with good karmic roots.”

The Heavenly Worthy said: “These four chapters are the marvelous works of the Four Heavenly Emperor Kings for deliverance of fate, constantly chanted by the Four Heavenly Supreme True Immortals and Jade Maidens, retaining spirit and calming qi, harmonizing form and soul, their elegant sounds wondrous and unmatched, wisdom penetrating the void. Therefore, the upright cultivators of the four directions receive the Dharma’s sound, naturally attaining true Dao, living long lives. On the day their fate ends, they go straight to Heaven, generation after generation without end, turning the wheel as holy kings. Their Dao is lofty and marvelous, honored among all scriptures, nurturing life and protecting death, the great vehicle Dharma gate. Future men and women’s hearts and cycles will differ greatly from this life’s pure simplicity and true faith. Constantly harboring doubt and discord, disputing and harming one another, self-inflicting injury to their years, not speaking of the evil deeds they commit, all saying scriptures and teachings have no spirits. After I depart, the scriptures and Dao will return to the Great Luo Heaven above the Three Realms. Observing their hearts from afar, there will be those who can be delivered. You diligently propagate and transform, so those with hearts may hear the Dharma, deliver themselves from roots of suffering and vexation, see light within their bodies, and meet good karmic connections. Those who do not believe will bring destruction upon themselves, drifting through birth and death, wandering the Five Paths without release. How diligent I am! Therefore I emphasize and admonish, unable to bear seeing future generations obstinate and pitiable. Thus I leave clear precepts: diligently practice and do not be negligent. Supreme Dao Lord, great saints of the Ten Directions, supremely true honored spirits, all bowed and received the command, then departed.”
