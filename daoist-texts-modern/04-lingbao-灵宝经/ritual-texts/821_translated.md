This *Sublime Scripture of the Numinous Books of the Many Heavens* serves as the grand deliverance of beings. For multitudes of beings grow ever more numerous, stirred by wild imaginings. The great deliverance begins from the original non-being. When the cloud of false thoughts is lifted, the sun of wisdom shines forth clearly. Thus, the spirit condenses the realm of insight; the transformations of the Five Domains bring forth recognition that illuminates the profound and penetrates the mysterious; the sages of the Ten Directions become perfectly pure. Therefore, the verdant forests resound with echoes, the golden ridges radiate light, the southern forge tempers sound, the cold court bathes in virtue—all realms manifest together the illumination of the numinous books. Hence, they are called the *Numinous Books of the Many Heavens*.

The Primordial Heavenly Worthy, with numinous intelligence, fashioned these characters to universally plant among the myriad sages and heavenly spirits. This is the *Sublime Scripture for Delivering Life*. "Life" means fixed destiny. The destinies of sentient beings are fixed in three kinds: first, the destiny of present affairs; second, the destiny of past karma; third, the destiny of the dao. The destinies of affairs and karma obscure the destiny of the dao and cannot manifest it. Therefore, by practicing the *Numinous Books of the Many Heavens*, one delivers the destinies of affairs and karma, leading them back to the destiny of the dao.

The destiny of affairs is that the eyes perceive colored forms, the nose smells fragrant or foul scents, the ears hear sounds, the tongue tastes sweetness or bitterness. The six roots each have fixed objects and cannot access the profound use; thus it is called the destiny of affairs. The destiny of karma is the learning and habits of past lives manifesting in the present. If one did not study before, one is foolish now; if one was full of anger before, one is ugly now. All retributions of form, length, and size are fixed by past karma and cannot be changed in this life; thus it is called the destiny of karma.

These two destinies of affairs and karma are both illusory fabrications, thus they cover and obscure the true nature of the destiny of the dao. Since these destinies are illusory, they can be removed and dispatched. If one studies the numinous books of the sages, one plants the numinous illumination of spirit; false thoughts naturally perish, like a bright lamp shining in darkness, turning darkness into light. Now the numinous wisdom is bright, turning affairs into dao; the destiny of the constant dao is originally fixed and never changed. This sublime scripture makes the destiny of affairs into the numinous and wondrous deliverance of life, hence it is called the *Sublime Scripture for Delivering Life*.

This volume is broadly divided into three parts:

**First**, a chapter introducing the origin and cause of the scripture’s dharma, questioning the binding of the false and constant, always revealing the supreme bliss as the original existence.

**Second**, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, in the *Changle* (Long Happiness) classic, reveals the five earth transformations and clarifies the two fundamental laws of original nature.

**Third**, the final chapter expounds the scripture’s purpose to demonstrate its transmission.

### On the Preface (Three Sections)

**First**, the reason for the reappearance of the dharma king;  
**Second**, the manifestation of blessings and retributions;  
**Third**, the clear acceptance and awakening of the assembly.

At the time of the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, it was the era of Kaihuang. In the great hall of blessings, the capital of the Dao Sovereign’s governance, the *Changle* abode, he spoke this to the great saints of the many heavens. The Primordial Heavenly Worthy and the supreme fruit of the many heavens traveled here together, then he breathed out the numinous books to bestow upon the Dao Sovereign. The great hall of blessings had already harmonized the teachings of the Dao Sovereign’s former karmic destinies.

The *Changle* abode produced the false constant and the constant false, each with three scriptures: one, binding the body to immortality; two, holding the teaching of life and liberation, binding our joy to constancy; three, living in the blessed hall kingdom, with no destruction of constancy. Yet none knew the origin of the root, nor the remaining forces reaching their utmost; sitting in the midst of blessings and fruits, thus it was the constant of the Heavenly Worthy.

Now the Primordial issues two questions on binding and movement to summon the Dao Sovereign. He recounts the answers he has seen, truly the ignorance of the false and constant about beginning and end. Then the Primordial smiles, five-colored light issuing from his mouth, descending and breathing out, commanding the teaching of the numinous books’ true text, the power of wisdom’s light, to illuminate and extinguish all false and constant delusions, all forms of blessings and fruits vanish. Thus the Dao Sovereign questions, and the Primordial answers. This is the true text, forceful as a staff stirring a wheel, revealing there is yet an ultimate limit leading to impermanence.

In days past, the force’s resonance deeply reached the Ten Directions, so that men and women of this land knew the text but not other lands. Thus the former teaching is now for the future not to come, hence it is for other lands. Now the Primordial, with the great saints of the many heavens, speaks the ten volumes of the numinous books’ sublime scriptures to entrust to the Dao Sovereign and to deliver the heavenly beings of the Ten Directions. At this moment, the Dao Sovereign and the assembly all rejoice.

The Primordial Heavenly Worthy, in the *Changle* abode, presents four chapters, the main scripture in two texts:

**First**, clarifying the five earth transformations, generating the benefits of blessings to enter constancy.

**Second**, the Heavenly Worthy instructs the Most High Dao Sovereign beneath the Dragon River, revealing the original intent of divine transformation and deliverance of life to secure true constancy.

This text is divided into three parts:

**One**, enumerating the beginnings and ends of the five directions, arising transformations, growth, and blessings, thus distinguishing purity and impurity, suffering and joy.

**Two**, instructing the Dao Sovereign on the five elders in one chapter, clarifying the five elders’ transformation of the Ten Directions, sharing the same root as the Primordial, thus inheriting the sacred decree and commanding the assembly to honor and accept.

**Three**, the Heavenly Worthy completes the chapter on the five directions, explaining the function of power, revealing the gathering of divine fire, clarifying beginning and end.

This can be arranged by the seven directions, exemplified in three parts:

**First**, presenting today’s teaching of true constancy, thus listing the assembly of pure children, extending to the false constant emperor’s realm.

**Second**, the Primordial instructs below, issuing questions on binding and movement, removing attachment to former teachings as false and deluded, joyfully revealing appearances to summon the self-manifested answers.

**Third**, the ignorant and unexamined below, clarifying diligent hearts to petition, thus the Primordial answers this appearance, that former teachings have remaining force, counted as false. Hence there is the past and future impermanence manifest; now the teaching of the constant emperor is respectfully received. This begins in this land, the central land. The central land is the heart. When the heart is pure, the eyes, ears, nose, and tongue are pure; thus the teaching begins in the central direction, completing the four heavens.

---

The Primordial Heavenly Worthy, in the *Changle* abode, presents four chapters. Below, the first clarifies the Primordial as the transforming mother, accomplishing the central Dao Sovereign’s vehicle. The Primordial transforms and governs the Dao Sovereign’s comprehensive mastery of the Ten Directions, causing life to manifest its great meaning, broadly encompassing all directions, thus briefly revealing the four directions, the rest to be known.

These four chapters have three intentions:

**One**, all list the states of countries achieving the utmost wonder, and the comrades practicing the same karma, traveling into their lands, witnessing the changing worldly appearances, questioning binding and movement, causing doubt to arise. Hence two questions on the Milky Way: one, whether to learn immortality; two, what wondrous methods exist. Causing them to self-narrate their fruit of realization, not knowing it is the false constant, then narrating what they see and verify to simplify the Primordial.

**Two**, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy instructs the Blue Emperor below, answering the original cause. In former Dragon River years, I once issued the numinous books’ true text to deliver beings; the remaining force thus had all appearances. After my passing, I showed the force of blessings and retributions, responding to the utmost time, commanding progress in cultivation to deliver life and change the false constant.

**Three**, the emperor and assembly understand and follow, thus the Blue Emperor bows and receives the decree, the assembly of saints all rejoicing. Among these chapters, the text rises and falls; the three chapters share a similar appearance but differ in fruit of verification and strange appearances. Some have verdant forests with purple characters, some have red fruits with white rings, some have cold pools with numinous grace—all are formed by the remaining force of the true text. Verification shows these are false constants.

In the *Changle* abode, the numinous treasure true text is spoken forth as the method to deliver beings, beginning in this land. At this time, compassion and transforming power govern, pervading the Ten Directions’ boundless worlds. The supreme saints, flying heavenly kings, wondrous conduct perfected beings, and the myriad evil beings of the boundless worlds all gather simultaneously.

Hence the text below says: “The borderlands of the four directions.” Causing the great earth to transform into molten gold pouring over the land, the borderlands become jade and lapis lazuli treasures. This reveals impermanence to manifest constancy; the dharma nature is not truly combined; sages and worthies have no different path; thus the crossing points differ, but the secret accord is truly the same.

Initially, within binding constancy, the teaching of impermanence is spoken; later, the transformed lands’ impermanence is shown to manifest constancy. Initially, binding constancy is the emperors’ verified immortality, and various wondrous appearances and joys. The teaching of impermanence is to see the true text within the light. The transformed land is the molten gold pouring over the earth. The true text’s essence appears in the four verses recited below, uniting with the central land above, forming the five texts.

---

The Primordial Heavenly Worthy instructs the Most High Dao Sovereign: This concluding explanation transmits the numinous treasure true text to deliver the assembly of saints. The method of transmission and deliverance is the sacred succession of saints, the cause and condition never broken. Now the scripture records the Heavenly Worthy’s numinous wisdom as the numinous treasure true text, entrusted to the Dao Sovereign, who then entrusts it to the five elder emperors, each receiving one copy, to nourish and pacify the beings of the five directions, so they do not suffer sorrow or undergo the eight hardships, but only hear the myriad wondrous sounds, meeting kalpa after kalpa, the true text never ceasing.

The force rides to harm the borderlands of the four directions, where blessings and virtue do not reach, where the true text is not seen nor the dharma sound heard, leaving life to birth and death, falling into evil roots—most pitiful indeed. This reveals evil karma to encourage practice, thus it says to greatly open the dharma teachings, universally deliver the many heavens, so that these mixed lands all return their hearts.

The text below says that riding the force harms those without affinity and thin blessings, who cannot hear in advance. Hence the text says other lands and foreign regions lack blessings and virtue, do not see the scriptures and teachings, and naturally walk the evil paths.

The Heavenly Worthy completes the five directions’ lands. This chapter concludes the true text, not only accomplishing the five directions but also delivering all beings of the Ten Directions, all receiving the bright teaching. From start to finish, this chapter is full of joy, explaining respect for the teaching and its benefits, saying this leads to deliverance and long life.

From this time, men and women all return their destiny to the Heavenly Worthy, clearly establishing the place of binding constancy, unfolding the teaching of impermanence, thus the fire essence refines itself.

The Primordial Heavenly Worthy instructs the Most High Dao Sovereign on the Dragon River chapter, the main scripture’s second part, divided into four texts:

**First**, revealing that all beings originally exist, speaking the false constant’s teaching of impermanence, showing the provisional teaching to gain benefit, thus saying it is long-lasting.

**Second**, the chapter of wandering visions, showing the extinction of divine powers as true wisdom, each offering treasures to manifest constancy. Later, those who do not receive and are stained by conditions also gain.

**Third**, the chapter of thorough observation, simplifying provisional and actual, then discussing the superiority and inferiority of constancy and impermanence.

**Fourth**, listing the four directions for delivering life into true constancy in verse, reciting this to reveal the Primordial’s teaching of the numinous treasure’s difficult-to-hear words to the Dao Sovereign.

The Primordial instructs on the Dragon River: from the Kaihuang era onward, the numinous treasure texts began to open and circulate. From the Dragon River onward, the causes and conditions of the five kalpas’ generation and cessation are told in order, also revealing the Heavenly Worthy’s timely titles and arising figures.

Now this Dragon River time is the former Dragon River, the completion kalpa; Yan Kang is the destruction kalpa. The Dragon River time is the former Dragon River; the first year of Dragon River is the later Dragon River; the former Dragon River is destroyed. The text says: after my passing, heaven and earth were destroyed, becoming wind, marsh, cavern, and void, called Yan Kang, the great kalpa. Yan means long; Kang means peaceful. In the midst of long peace, after the five kalpas, the Dragon River is completed. The current text does not go out but directly comes forth, reaching Chi Ming and Kaihuang, the affairs of the five kalpas.

The five kalpas are: former Dragon River, then Yan Kang, then later Dragon River, then Chi Ming, then Kaihuang—five in total. In Kaihuang, there is also the Supreme Emperor. The Supreme Emperor is the Dao Sovereign acting as the teaching master, facing the Supreme Ultimate and all truths. The Primordial Heavenly Worthy is the transforming master, issuing dharma to the Dao Sovereign.

In this text, the former Dragon River’s Primordial issues his title, formless and eternally constant, beginning with heaven, earth, sun, moon, and the three images, with men and women but no ritual codes. I use the transformation of the dao as metaphor, not yet issuing the true text. After my passing, destruction came as Yan Kang; later Dragon River was completed; reaching Chi Ming, heaven and earth restored, people complete, riding the former Dragon River’s karma.

I again appeared, titled the Nameless Sovereign, using the numinous treasure dharma to teach and deliver the many heavens and beings, still not issuing the true text. At that time, men and women rode the former karma’s body, fondly revering and serving. After my passing, heaven and earth again destroyed, dark and gloomy, the later Yan Kang. The three breaths were chaotic, blown by great winds; the souls of beings rode the fate to be born in the upper realm, where wind wheels obscure them.

Reaching Kaihuang, I again appeared, titled Primordial Heavenly Worthy, first issuing the numinous treasure true text, brightening sun, moon, stars, the four seasons, and Five Phases, thus completing birth. I, in the first azure heaven, titled Primordial Heavenly Worthy, first gave birth to the true text, opened and expanded the dharma teaching, accomplished the many heavens and the Dao Sovereign, issued the red script true text for the many heavens, along with the numinous books of the many heavens.

From this we understand that the beings of the many heavens, by Kaihuang, encountered the true text, the cause and condition long enduring, finally able to hear it. Men and women simple and honest, tying cords as they walked, this is due to riding the karma of the former kalpa; thus they encounter the flowing and unfolding dharma sound, and beings naturally return their hearts, gradually entering the dharma gate.

---

At this time, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, in this chapter, reveals impermanence to manifest constancy. Hence the Heavenly Worthy divides his form into millions, simultaneously everywhere—this is the time of Kaihuang’s dharma preaching. When the teaching ends, he intends that future beings follow the teaching to understand and practice it as constant.

Thus the Primordial travels to the Western River’s Weak Water, breathing out five-colored light, universally illuminating the many heavens and the borderlands of the four directions, universally revealing brightness, as if all were one place, showing the sign of extinction to break the delusion of attachment to teaching and faith, explaining the meaning below.

Hence there are millions of divided forms, simultaneously everywhere—these are transformation bodies. The dharma body and transformation body do not produce scriptures; the physical body produces scriptures to deliver beings, also called the true and responsive two bodies. The dharma body may also be called formless and eternally constant, the transformation body may be called the Primordial’s born body, the colored body may be called the Primordial Five Elders, or the Most High Dao Sovereign. These four names encompass all bodies, though there are countless forms, never exceeding these four.

Whether male or female, all universally see the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, as if sharing one place. This is divine power not shared. If shared, there would be two dharmas to speak of sharing, not one place. Now one place means not shared. Thus, wherever one is, young or old, male or female, all go to bow to the Heavenly Worthy, according to their lands, uttering the *Numinous Treasure Five Sections of True Text*. This is the same numinous treasure speech as the Heavenly Worthy, thus not shared.

---

Under the dazzling radiance, he broadly explains the affairs of transmission and teaching, with cinnabar scripts and iron edicts, carrying gold and silver, filling a whole country, all received and obeyed by the Heavenly Worthy’s dharma precepts and sublime scriptures. The Heavenly Worthy bestows at once, wealth and dharma both bestowed, all-pervading without exception.

Those entering the dharma gate all gain a lifespan of thirty-six thousand years. At the first year of the Supreme Emperor, the middle kalpa of Kaihuang, this is the subtle long-standing attachment to traces, neglect giving rise to faults without self-awareness, some killing, lust, and offerings, indulgence in desires, self-born evil paths, all suffering experienced—this is the present time.

This reveals faults to show one should reform, thus the text says: Now this scripture is spoken for future lives, to deliver those who can be delivered. The admonition commands those with heart to receive attentively, thus the Dao Sovereign receives the mandate.

---

The Primordial Heavenly Worthy says: I have observed the many heavens. This chapter concludes the numinous treasure true text, most honored and precious, urging later ones to respect it. The text lists my observations of the many heavens, from countless kalpas until today, with supreme heavens attaining the dao, great saints and gods innumerable and boundless. Yet all who attain the dao do so by the numinous treasure true text.

Next, observing beneath the Southern Hill’s Vermilion Palace, broadly explaining the benefits gained from numinous treasure people, thus saying this scripture is honored and wondrous, delivering countless beings.

From the great kalpa’s transition, briefly listing many scriptures destroyed by great calamities, only this scripture remains. All other miscellaneous dharmas below are listed with their names lost to disaster; those lost scriptures no longer send forth remnants.

At the Jade Pure Supreme Dao’s level, listing scriptures not lost and showing their returning places—this is the Great Net. At the level of the scholar and cultivator, joyfully praising the beautiful force, urging cultivation for benefit, unbroken through generations, with good causes and conditions.

---

The *Numinous Books*’ true form is re-titled, having one grade and four chapters, received and chanted by the many heavens and many perfected beings, harmonizing form and soul, spirit and numinosity, to deliver their lives.

The four chapters each have three sections:  
**One**, stating the origin of the numinous books for delivering life;  
**Two**, listing the numinous books’ verses for chanting;  
**Three**, long prose concluding with verses, naming those who guard and reward, and the benefits of chanting, with the seven ancestors rejoicing together.

The Eastern Splendor breathes forth the numinous wind; the Western Palace harmonizes the clear jade sound. The Primordial, in the Eastern Splendor Palace, breathes forth the teaching of the divine numinous wind; thus the Western Palace perfected beings hear, receive, and awaken, harmonizing into the clear and resonant jade sound. Without the cause and condition of teaching in opposition, receiving the clear jade sound would not arise.

Now the two families of disciples receive, thus it says the two breaths form an empty cavity; in the great void, the mind is born; two add wisdom and understanding to form sound in the cavity; thus the disciple’s mind of wisdom awakens in the great void, receiving the numinous books unfolding as long strips, spreading out as teaching, thus forming the precious text’s verdant forest.

The phoenix’s song reaches the heavens; the Primordial breathes the numinous wind, not only harmonizing the Western Palace but also the divine phoenix’s song. The numinous chapter’s sound pervades the world, responding to the six times and eight festivals, chanting and communicating the true nature.

Above are the life-delivering children; on the numinous treasure text are the life-delivering numinous children, pulling out the heavy darkness of night, bright numinosity illuminating and extinguishing the long shadow, preserving form through kalpas, using preservation of form as the dao’s use. Using it as the dao’s form, the dao’s form is long-lasting, thus it is said to be vast and unfathomable.

The long record of undying years. Record is a name. Form and name both made undying, vast and enduring, undying years indeed. They float with the kalpa’s rise and fall. Sun and moon illuminate the numinous soul. The numinous soul is like the sun and moon’s illumination, always bright and clear, like the revolving star wheel turning southeast without ceasing.

The divine illumination is like the sun; all stars cast down their forms and shadows, thus it is said the nine stars cast down their forms and shadows. Nine means to lift and raise; why specifically point to the seven stars of the Northern Dipper? All stars fall likewise.

The treasure flower gives birth to the five hearts. The numinous treasure characters are treasures fallen, naturally giving birth to the five hearts. The five hearts mean metal, wood, water, fire, and earth do not overcome each other, sharing one true nature. There is an undying spirit, harmonizing with my cinnabar gold. Spirit and I harmonize; the true dao’s cinnabar manifests, like diamond’s hardness and indestructibility.

The red script examines essence and breath; the jade secret is wondrous and profound. The numinous books’ characters, jade chapters, red script, and jade secrets are clear, examining and gathering human essence and breath, reaching the wondrous dao. Today, at the Vermilion Palace, there are records and books no demon can invade.

Crimson clouds and emerald jade void, the numinous wind brushes the Supreme Subtle. This is the Primordial issuing the southern numinous books’ true text. Jade Void is the Heavenly Worthy’s title. Crimson clouds form characters, emerald brilliance issuing from the Jade Void’s mouth as numinous spirit; the wind teaching fans and brushes the Supreme Subtle’s sound, gaining the vast six blacks’ removal, vastly breathing forth the radiance of wisdom’s illumination.

Sentient beings ride the light scene of my wisdom sun, shaking the reins and riding smoothly, then returning into Heaven’s principle, thus it is called following Heaven’s return. There is the numinous wisdom vermilion child, illuminating and pulling out the numinous night’s darkness, the cavity of yang’s illumination, refining the fallen brightness.

The brightness becomes jade chapters, with power able to deliver people’s years and life; thus chanting the numinous chapter can give birth to people’s spirit wisdom, that is, the numinous song of the five spirits opening. The numinous spirits open awakening, naturally gaining long souls without end, merging with the light scene as one light, one thought entering the nine enclosures.

The nine enclosures are the Primordial’s nine heavens’ palace enclosures. The soul entering the nine enclosures then gains the term of countless kalpas to the distant beyond, thus having limitless lifespan. Hence it says the splendid life does not wither or decline.

Flying beings open the heavy gate. The Primordial commands flying heavenly spirits to spread and speak the profound gate; the southern palace perfected beings clearly see the dark gloom, forming the wisdom mechanism and brightly issuing it. The wisdom mechanism brightly issues, fixing the life-delivering measure in the Vermilion Mound’s palace, thus it is called the crimson register.

The register’s name is fixed, then the spirit completes the form and flies. The blessing flows to the seven ancestors; thus it says the seven ancestors ascend to heaven, blessings and virtue towering high.

The turning wheel of the empty cavity soul. Turning the law wheel of the numinous books, transforming and gathering the soul and spirit in the cavity, thus able to open my nine profound dark gates. The spirit rides it to awaken, thus it says the night scene unfolds the morning sun, like the morning sun shining and fluttering, riding the numinous wisdom’s rotation, returning to the path of long life.

---

The Kun Terrace gives birth to the clear sound. This is the Primordial in the western Kun Terrace, breathing out the numinous books to form sound, with clear jade sound resounding, thus having the jade purity’s added elegance, brightening the nine darknesses’ gloom and dispersing it.

There are treasure chapters filling the great void’s dao, treading true colors and entering the formless. Brocade clouds, emerald and vermilion sun, the numinous books’ dharma cloud wisdom arises like brocade clouds’ emerald brilliance shining on the vermilion sun, also called the perfect splendor chasing the moon, giving birth and growing brightness.

It blends natural black wisdom, vast and vast, making the nine directions distant and all pure. Pure people have six wisdoms, purely completing Brahma conduct, the five spirits self-invite to high numinosity.

The crimson dwelling is a peaceful dwelling. The five king spirits dwell in the crimson dwelling, brightly shining in the vermilion child, able to last and endure, never withering for countless kalpas.

The ever-present good life lord is the transforming master in the Kun Terrace. The ever-present good life lord unites with the Great One Lord, jointly holding the imperial peaceful life register, thus it says to protect life and deliver the talisman register, refining the soul’s golden splendor in the imperial court.

Life is in the golden splendor court, naturally returning to the undying void; the soul and spirit flutter, riding the law wisdom’s movement, giving birth to wisdom and talent. The seven mysteries all enter the good life’s southern palace; decayed bones also gain fresh and pure glory.

Long songs delight the body, sitting together on floating clouds, graceful and easy, freely playing, riding the floating clouds’ green carriage, wandering carefree beyond the Great Net. The great demons of the Three Realms cannot lightly offend.

---

Flying steps enter the northern purity, able to ride the northern five-added mysterious heaven’s numinous books, thus gaining deliverance of life, stepping into the northern purity’s pavilion. Holding the true sect and self-inviting, receiving the upper origin’s warm wisdom, riding this light scene to gaze upon the mysterious dao’s platform, the four-sided palace, naturally producing brocade clouds’ cultivation and raising.

Within the palace are the gathering life-delivering numinous children, titled the Great One Supreme Emperor Lord, issuing dharma in the palace, summoning the assembly of saints of the Ten Directions to gather, raising light covers, feather robes filling the empty realm—how bustling indeed!

The Ten Directions all long hold the deliverance of the Nine Nether registers, annotating the upper golden record and red script texts, thus holding and spreading around the golden splendor palace court, named the fluttering deliverance broadcast.

Also raising green covers riding the wind in circles, with the cinnabar sky’s dharma cloud realm, brushing and raising the correct wisdom’s numinous chariot, building for me the upper origin’s palace, pulling out my life record, issuing the nine nights’ gate, delivering my life book to the southern palace’s Vermilion Mound’s gate, lifespan long preserved for countless kalpas.

The residing spirit dwells in the glory of the crimson mansion, the palace of the red child, brightly illuminating the three passes and five viscera, all self-bright and pure, thus the form receives undying breath, naturally giving birth to the treasure soul.

Thus gaining the blessing flow of the seven ancestors to deliver the southern palace, the gate of blessings and celebrations for generations. This delivers the life of three generations.

---

The Primordial Heavenly Worthy says: The right four chapters, this one chapter concludes the one grade four chapters, using these to circulate among the many heavens and many perfected saints’ realizations.

The many heavens’ highest saints, perfected beings, and jade maidens below, narrate the chanting, faith, acceptance, and benefits. Future men and women, heart and fate turning, below this is narrated for those doubting and divided, indulging in wild conduct, jealous and self-exalting, thus all manner of evil comes. After my passing, they enter the torturous Five Paths; this is shown below to reveal faults and urge reform, thus the mandate is received and departed.
