#### The Most High Profound Numinous Treasure Scripture of the Fivefold Refining for the Extinction and Salvation of the Living Corpse — Upper Scroll

At a time when the Heavenly Venerable was in the Fragrant Forest Garden of Chang Le, he instructed and transformed seven thousand two hundred and forty children. The ritual affairs were roughly complete. The Wise Children and the Wheel Heaven Children advanced to pay respects and addressed the Heavenly Venerable: “Today’s service seat overflows with joy beyond measure. The myriad heavens open their pardon; all light shines forth. The dark prison of the underworld, the land of accumulated cold nights, the three paths and five sufferings, the hungry ghosts and dead souls—all are granted release and return to blessings. The Three Officials cease their judgments; birth and death rejoice together. Yet the shadowy souls newly opened have not yet entered the turning wheel; the corpse spirits flee and fall, the decayed bones without moisture sink into the nine lands, wandering the earth officials, flying in confusion, unable to return. The earth’s domain hastens its gatherings; the forms of corpses find no rest, further suffering distress, looking up to petition the heavens. Now that pardon is opened, all is renewed universally; the imperial dao flows freely, its grace pervades the Ten Directions. Humbly we hear that the Heavenly Venerable has already bestowed great compassion and wishes to extend imperial favor universally. Grant that those to be delivered are delivered, those to be born are born, those to be turned are turned, those to be returned are returned. If past karmic ties are not severed, those unable to return remain in the corpse’s old residence, lingering in the nine springs, oppressed by myriad spirits, incompatible and unwelcomed, their flying souls homeless, unable to reach descendants. The great transformation now arises; it is fitting to universally remove these burdens. If there are still essentials within the law, please proclaim them, report below to the earth officials, that they may pacify, comfort, and soothe, all made peaceful; the nine offices and right divisions guard their bodies. If mercy is granted, then all heavens rejoice in peace; birth and death bear no resentment; blessings flow for countless kalpas, generation after generation without end.”

Then the Heavenly Venerable universally commanded the Heavenly Emperors, the Great Supreme Dao Lords of Limitlessness, the Great Holy Assemblies of the Ten Directions, the Most True Lords and Elders, the Flying Heavenly Kings, the Five Elder Emperor Lords, the Southern Supreme Officers of Life and Salvation, the Registers of Records and Fate, the Supreme Holy Lords of Longevity, the Mysterious Harmonious Jade Maidens, the Perfected Ones, and the countless multitudes without number, all to sit once more. Now it was time to open the gates of the dharma for the Wise Children, to explain the ancient canon of the Dragon Han and the Profound Capital, the jade treasury of the Nine Netherworlds, the female azure jade script, to rescue and deliver from the dark prison of the underworld, the land of accumulated cold nights, the three paths and five sufferings, the hungry ghosts and dead souls, so that all might see the light. Proclaim to the heavens, each clarifying the jade characters and natural mysterious script, universally announcing to the heavens, earth, water offices, sun, moon, stars, the celestial pivot and jade balance, the Three Realms and Five Emperors, the Five Sacred Mountains and Spirit Mountains, the Nine Lands and Spirit Officials, the Profound Origin, Profound Abyss, Profound Void, Profound Spirit, Profound Nothingness, Limitlessness and Infinity, no high no low, no form no color, no sound no echo, no great no small— all spirits and deities, each clearly assigned their duties. Now commanding the souls condemned by past offenses, their good and evil merits and faults, their years, months, days, and hours, all matters listed and distinguished, their former residences and corporeal remains located according to their domains, all to be pacified and comforted, guarded and supplied by earth deities, no disturbance permitted, according to merit accomplished. Those to be moved are moved, those to be delivered are delivered, those to be turned are turned, those to be born are born. The earth officials respond in accord, severing water pacts and oaths, removing celestial writings of darkness, all made clear and visible. Then the fourfold assembly of Wise Children joyfully performed their bows, raising hands and snapping fingers to acclaim goodness.

At that time, the thirty-two Heavenly Emperors took their seats. Each commanded flying heavenly spirits to unveil the Purple Yang Jade Platform, open the true jade treasury, and produce the celestial middle spiritual sound natural jade script of boundless profound chapters, to entrust to the earth officials, to deliver all people, to pacify corpses and settle spirits, to protect souls and record gods.

The Supreme Supreme One Qi, One Qi, Supreme Supreme Limitless No Summit No Color, Vast and True Great Dao, Primordial Heavenly Venerable, commanding the Central Yellow Primordial Heavenly Lord, by the Yellow Emperor’s Supreme Mysterious Female Azure Talisman, they announce to the Central Earth Office’s nine divisions and spirit officials to open deliverance for all dead souls of the Center, to pacify and settle corpse forms, to guard and comfort, forbidding earth officials from driving or disturbing, just like the female azure script of the golden dragon courier’s journey.

The heavens each command flying heavenly kings to use the celestial middle spiritual sound natural jade script female azure talisman command, also informing the Five Directions, Five Emperors, Five Sacred Mountains, and Earth Office spirit officials, each according to their talisman command, to uphold the great dharma. The imperial dao now shines clear. At this time, the heavens are bright and the air pure; the three luminaries pause their wheels; stars shine through the void; the celestial pivot and jade balance stand still; rivers and seas are silent; mountains and peaks swallow the mist; the time is harmonious and the air clear; golden winds brush away dust; the heavens bear no floating clouds; sun and moon pour forth their nectar; the five sufferings are released; the long night opens souls; withered trees bloom flowers; dead bones return to humans; qilin dance and phoenixes soar; birds fly and sing joyfully; the heavens leap and scatter flowers, acclaiming goodness. The Heavenly Venerable, delighted, composed a hymn:

Red Bright returns and transforms, mingling and dividing.  
Yin and yang forge change; their dao is natural.  
The mysterious chart turns seven times, returning at nine.  

Primordial command spirit chapter, boundless profound scrolls.  
The nature of impermanence, qi governs the nine dawns.  
Yang light subtly awakens, bright scenes ride the smoke.  

Three returns, five refinings, harmonized with seven nectars.  
Colors shine brilliantly, each returning to its original spirit.  
Great dharma simply delivers; decayed bones return to humans.  

Precious self’s wondrous dao, ascending to the highest truth.  
Returning the origin through five refinings, the supreme dao’s spirit.  
Illuminating sun and moon, penetrating the nine lights.  

The heavens open pardon, the dark night is mysterious and clear.  
Decayed bones transcend steps, refining and transforming self-born.  
Breathing in spirit harmony, penetrating the dark into the nether.  

Divine marvels change ten thousandfold, flying souls reverse forms.  
Riding smoke, driving the void, ascending to the imperial court.  
Jade script proclaims command, earth office peaceful.  

All who receive deliverance universally enter the light.  
Possessing precious self’s script, generation after generation transform and live.  
Light leaks slowly, wind blades punish each other.  

Jade chapters and spirit script birth vermilion light,  
Five spirits bind essence, illuminating the Ten Directions.  

Four-eight positions combine the Five Phases,  
Arranged stars, sun, moon, yin and yang communicate.  

Establishing heavenly truth to protect the Supreme Emperor,  
Opening the dharma gates, all are the same.  

Maitreya’s great thousandfold dao flourishes,  
Golden throne joy beyond measure.  

The heavens leap and play spirit chapters,  
Opening my wondrous dao to awaken the young child.  

Grant you endless kalpas of life,  
Nine turns to true position, immortal king.  

Secret within the bosom, guard it carefully, do not reveal.

When the Heavenly Venerable finished the hymn, the Heavenly Emperors, the Great Supreme Dao Lords of Limitlessness, the Great Holy Assemblies of the Ten Directions, the Flying Heavenly Kings, the Five Elder Emperor Lords, the Southern Supreme Officers of Life and Salvation, the Registers of Records and Fate, the Supreme Holy Lords of Longevity, the Mysterious Harmonious Jade Maidens, the Lords and Spirit Consorts, the Perfected Ones, and the countless multitudes of seven thousand two hundred and forty children all rose together, flicking incense and scattering flowers, circling three times to the left, then facing north to bow, raising hands and snapping fingers. The thirty-two heavens, sun, moon, and stars all shone simultaneously; beneath the earth, the nine netherworlds, limitless profound abysses, light and shadow penetrated mysteriously, no longer dark or hidden but universally visible. Kṣitigarbha manifested, emitting golden jade dew forms; mountains, rivers, and streams were all equally peaceful; white bones received qi; decayed corpses regained souls; the nine lands were serene and safe; the earth officials peaceful; all beings universally delivered without bias. The great dharma flowed and transformed; the imperial dao expanded; universally announcing to the heavens, sun, moon, stars, the celestial pivot and jade balance, the Southern and Northern Dippers, the Registers of Fate and Records, Lord Han the Chief Recorder, the Southern Palace, all lands and waters, the Five Sacred Mountains and Spirit Mountains, the Three Officials and Nine Divisions, the Twelve River Sources, the long night’s domain within the nine netherworlds, the four supervisors and five emperors, all divine beings, each following the great dharma, universally celebrating as one. Now is new, without above or below, without limit or end, without depth or distance, without hidden or obscure, without boundary or border, without great or small, without beginning or end. All spirits and deities snap fingers to proclaim commands, obeying and revering accordingly.

In the year of the Grand Duke, month, day, hour, in some heavenly county, town, and village, a yellow plain chapter report is made, presented on the golden dragon.

The female azure ancient canon writes this text in vermilion on yellow silk; the master at the deceased’s location, at the hour of the rat facing north, burns five incense fires, performs the five pacifications, and presents the yellow silk chapter. The text is exposed overnight; at dawn next day, each text is buried in its place to pacify spirits and settle form. Those who practice it, the female azure text says, “The nine ancestors’ shadowy souls all immediately emerge from the long night, their bodies entering light; the Three Officials remove their judgments; the heavenly court records their names; providing their kitchen meals; for thirty-two years all return to their former form and are reborn. Those not yet returned, their corporeal old residence is guarded by the Five Emperors, earth deities protect and comfort, no disturbance allowed; within a hundred years, none fail to transform and return to the human path. The Three Realms’ registers are very clear; the wise penetrate its ultimate principle, examining good and evil, cause and effect, clear without falsehood. The foolish take fate as false, calling the Three Officials mere charcoal, how pitiful indeed.”

The Heavenly True Sovereign said: “In former times, in the Red Bright Heaven, there was a Daoist surnamed Zheng, styled Ren’an,功 and virtue incomplete, died in the northern barbarian region of Chang Mountain. His son Zhongming apprenticed under Master Mysterious Harmony, using this text to pacify Ren’an’s corpse palace for thirty years. Ren’an was delivered and should have returned to the human realm, but was burned by a savage man; his form and bones then rose mysteriously, now known as the Southern Palace’s South Emperor Old Lord. His path of attainment is now inscribed at the Supreme Ultimate Southern Palace South Pavilion, very clear indeed.”

The Heavenly True Sovereign said: “In the land of Good Endurance, there was a Daoist surnamed Xian, styled Xinran, apprenticed under the Impermanence Child, receiving the Numinous Treasure extinction and ascent transmission.功 and virtue insufficient, died in the Azure Origin Heaven, buried in the flowing birth state. The Impermanence Child used this text to pacify his corpse form. After a hundred years, a flood washed it away; thereupon he transformed and was born anew, now called the Primordial Spirit Old Lord. The Southern Palace records his path in the Purple Tenuity Pavilion.”

The Heavenly True Sovereign said: “In the Abandoned Worthy World, there was a Daoist surnamed Hao, styled Fuming, fond of mountains and waters in youth, abandoned home to study afar,功 and virtue incomplete, died under Mount Earth Mirror. His son Shaoxin apprenticed under the Northern City Master, using this text to pacify Fuming’s corpse form. After seven hundred years, he was refined by water and fire, then returned to life among humans. Later apprenticed under Black Text Master, received ascent transmission, now known as the Emperor of the Mysterious Old. The Southern Palace now records his path in the Northern Origin Mysterious Window.”

The Heavenly True Sovereign said: “In the Central Origin Heaven’s Southern Floating Pear World, there was a Daoist surnamed Wang, styled Duming, traveled and studied in youth, apprenticed under Master Butcher True, receiving five texts for ascent to immortality.功 and virtue insufficient, died in the eastern mountain Guangling. His son Jingxiu sought Master Dai Zhong to receive this text, pacifying the corpse form for ninety years. Encountered the great desolation of the eastern mountain; people dug soil for food, exposed his corpse, and he immediately transformed and was born anew. Later attained the Dao and ascended to heaven, known as Jingxiao Perfected.”

The Heavenly True Sovereign said: “These gentlemen all accumulated learning and extinction, their Dao work nearing completion, thus receiving this text to return to life among humans, all transcending void steps and space, ascending the golden palace, receiving the title ‘Natural.’ Their deeds are distant and beyond ordinary understanding. Among the nearer ones are disciples of the Yan Sect: Master Night Light, Master Stone Lord of High Hill, Master Hongya, Master Golden Mother, all receiving the Numinous Treasure extinction and fivefold refining method and ascent transmission. Master Yan died at Mount Long Hill in Yuyang Lu County; Master Gao died at Mount Gao Fu in Zhongshan Wenxi County; Master Hongya died at Mount Lang in Wuwei Guzang County, all receiving this text to pacify their tombs. Master Yan’s tomb collapsed after years, his form transformed, later entering the great cave of Mount Meng’s Golden Court, receiving scriptures as Immortal Minister. Master Gao’s tomb collapsed after seventy-two years, was discovered by people, coffin opened, form flew, now known as the Central Sacred Mountain Perfected. Master Hongya’s tomb opened after one hundred twenty years, corpse form flew, receiving scriptures as Qingcheng Perfected. These sages all received the extinction method, ascent transmission, and spirit pacification way, thus attaining exalted void tombs, riding high clouds, roaming the Purple Tenuity, receiving the title Perfected. These recent events are no longer distant transmissions. The Primordial Heavenly King now unveils the Primordial treasure, announcing to the Supreme Ultimate Immortal; those who encounter it will have their past lives recorded for ten thousand kalpas, registered in the Upper Clarity, destined for immortality. How can the heavens and humans not accept the female azure’s mandate, keeping it secret and treasured?”
