## The Numinous Treasure Refining and Deliverance: The Five Immortals’ Yellow Silk Charter for Pacifying Spirits and Settling the Divine

The Profound and Numinous Treasure, the Red Emperor Master of Utmost Truth, the Supreme Great Master, your servant, one named Jia, humbly bows and reports:

To the Supreme Supreme Supreme One Qi, One Qi; to the Supreme Supreme Supreme Limitless, No Apex, No Color, No Light, Vast and Boundless Utmost True Great Dao, the Primordial Heavenly Venerable; to the Thirty-Two Emperors; to the Most High Great Dao Lord, Jade Majesty:

I, your servant, by the original transformation of the Primordial, open the heavens and pardon the hidden prisons of the netherworld, the three tortures, the five sufferings, the hungry ghosts, the dead souls, and lead them forth from the long night into all-encompassing light. The imperial Dao having been molded, the dead bones return to humanity; the Three Realms are purified and serene; the Earthly Palace is at peace.

I now petition to extinguish and deliver, entrusting the corpse to the Great Yin, lodging the form with the Earthly Official. My功 (merit) is slight, my virtue scant; those not yet granted are all under the female azure talisman’s command, following their assigned governance, to comfort and soothe, to provide for their encampment and guard. They must not be disturbed, so as to return and lodge once more in human form.

At this time, all the great holy hosts of the heavens—Limitless Most High Great Dao Lord, the Five Elders Supreme Emperors, the Flying Heavenly Divine Kings, the Southern Prosperity Upper Palace, the Longevity Registrar, the Benevolent True Lord, the various Primordial Lords and Spirit Consorts, the Mysterious Harmonious Jade Maidens, the various Perfected Ones, the seven thousand two hundred and forty children—at once snap their fingers, universally announcing to all heavens, all lands, all waters, the sun, moon, stars, the Celestial Pivot and Jade Balance, the Five Emperors and Five Sacred Mountains, all numinous mountains and Earthly Palaces, the Three Officials and Nine Bureaus, the Twelve River Sources, the profound caverns and abyssal hollows, where there is no high or low, no deep or far, no boundary or limit, no great or small, infinite and boundless, all spirits and deities, that all must hear and know.

The golden seal and jade script are entrusted to the Mysterious Harmonious Jade Maiden, decreed henceforth as new. With reverence, the great法 (method) is upheld without deviation. Though Heaven and Earth’s great cycles pass, the text remains clear and precise.

Now, following the ancient female azure upper palace canon, to clarify the sacred Dao, for your servant Jia of a certain county and village, a pure and faithful disciple of both genders, aged thus and so, born under the Bingwu fate, registered under the Red Emperor, receiving qi in the seventh month, the cinnabar heavens receiving yang, prior功 incomplete, walking amidst the defiled world, stained by dust and filth, destined for extinguishing and deliverance, entrusting fate to the Great Yin, lodging form with the Earthly Official.

Now, within the central heavens of a certain village, a palace is established as a dwelling place.功 slight, virtue little, unable to return by oneself. Now, seeing the Earthly Palace’s urgent pursuit, incompatible with peaceful repose, the soul flutters and the spirit scatters, the corpse’s form without lodging.

Respectfully following the bright true great法 of golden seal and jade script, I petition above to the natural heavens, the jade-character female azure talisman command, to inform below the nine Earthly Spirit Officials of a certain heavenly land, to pacify and settle Jia’s physical form and earthly residence.

I petition the nine-qi azure heavens’ blue spiritual living divine true person, from the Eastern Peak immortal, riding the azure dragon with ninety million riders, bearing the nine-qi celestial chart and the azure emperor female azure talisman command, to descend to the eastern village’s nine Earthly Spirit Officials, open the long night’s palace of the nine netherworld hells, extract Jia’s soul and spirit, return them to the former dwelling.

Those to be transformed, transform; those to be delivered, deliver; those to be born, be born; those to be returned, return. Those not yet born, clearly pacify the corpse’s form, comfort and guard, never to be disturbed.

As the female azure text prescribes, with azure-patterned silk ninety feet long, or nine feet, to offer to the nine-qi heavenly lords, as a token of deliverance and extraction.

Again, I petition the three-qi cinnabar heavens’ red spiritual living divine true person, from the Southern Peak immortal, riding the red dragon with thirty million riders, bearing the three-qi celestial chart and the red emperor female azure talisman command, to descend to the southern village’s nine Earthly Spirit Officials, open the long night’s palace of the nine netherworld hells, extract Jia’s soul and spirit, return them to the former dwelling.

Those to be transformed, transform; those to be delivered, deliver; those to be born, be born; those to be returned, return. Those not yet born, clearly pacify the corpse’s form, comfort and guard, never to be disturbed.

As the female azure text prescribes, with red-patterned silk thirty feet long, or three feet, to offer to the three-qi heavenly lords, as a token of deliverance and extraction.

Again, I petition the one-qi yellow heavens’ yellow spiritual chief, the commander of spirits and true person, from the Central Peak immortal, riding the yellow dragon with twelve thousand riders, bearing the one-qi celestial chart and the yellow emperor female azure talisman command, to descend to the central boundless, limitless, no high, no low, no deep, no far, no boundary, no limit Earthly Palace and all its spirit officials, open the long night’s palace of the nine netherworld earth peaks, extract Jia’s soul and spirit, return them to the former dwelling.

Those to be transformed, transform; those to be delivered, deliver; those to be born, be born; those to be returned, return. Those not yet born, clearly pacify the corpse’s form, comfort and guard, never to be disturbed.

As the female azure text prescribes, with yellow-patterned silk one hundred twenty feet long, or twelve feet, to offer to the one-qi heavenly lords, as a token of deliverance and extraction.

Again, I petition the seven-qi white heavens’ white spiritual living divine true person, from the Western Peak immortal, riding the white dragon with seventy million riders, bearing the seven-qi celestial chart and the white emperor female azure talisman command, to descend to the western village’s nine Earthly Spirit Officials, open the long night’s palace of the nine netherworld earth peaks, extract Jia’s soul and spirit, return them to the former dwelling.

Those to be transformed, transform; those to be delivered, deliver; those to be born, be born; those to be returned, return. Those not yet born, clearly pacify the corpse’s form, comfort and guard, never to be disturbed.

As the female azure text prescribes, with white-patterned silk seventy feet long, or seven feet, to offer to the seven-qi heavenly lords, as a token of deliverance and extraction.

Again, I petition the five-qi mysterious heavens’ black spiritual living divine true person, from the Northern Peak immortal, riding the black dragon with fifty million riders, bearing the five-qi celestial chart and the black emperor female azure talisman command, to descend to the northern village’s nine Earthly Spirit Officials, open the long night’s palace of the nine netherworld hells, extract Jia’s soul and spirit, return them to the former dwelling.

Those to be transformed, transform; those to be delivered, deliver; those to be born, be born; those to be returned, return. Those not yet born, clearly pacify the corpse’s form, comfort and guard, never to be disturbed.

As the female azure text prescribes, with black-patterned silk fifty feet long, or five feet, to offer to the five-qi heavenly lords, as a token of deliverance and extraction.

Furthermore, I offer five taels of gold, or fifty jin of iron, to honor the Five Emperors, to pacify and guard the five directions.

Now, Jia should follow the established example of opening deliverance; the nine Earthly Officials each according to their territorial bounds, manage the encampment and guard, provide as needed, ensure the form is peaceful and the spirit guarded, the soul not scattered.

When功 is complete, the form shall return to the old dwelling, receive the ferry and be born anew.

May the Five Emperors nourish and feed the Great Harmony’s primordial essence, guide the qi to nurture the spirit, drink of the Three Lights, the mysterious influx of the vast spring. Jade mushrooms fill the body, radiance early bright, fragrance overflowing early sweet, the soul roams the Upper Clarity, clothing and food natural, descending to attach to the palace and dwelling, merging with the light, never to be apart, sharing transformation and birth.

Today is a great celebration, delivering countless beings, opening deliverance for all, none not following, honoring and upholding the ancient法, listing功 before the heavens.

Whoever violates the female azure, shall be stripped of office and punished in body, bound by old decrees, the golden dragon courier proceeding. Humbly I submit this memorial, beseeching report.

Your servant Jia, sincerely fearful and respectful, death penalty, death penalty, kowtows twice in report.

Empty three lines—your servant surnamed so, belonging to county, village.

To the Supreme Supreme Supreme One Qi, One Qi; to the Supreme Supreme Supreme Limitless, No Apex, No Color, No Light, Vast and Boundless Utmost True Great Dao, the Primordial Heavenly Venerable; to the Thirty-Two Emperors; to the Most High Great Dao Lord, Jade Majesty.

On the year Jiazi, month so and so, day so and so, hour so and so, at such and such place, a yellow plain charter was composed and presented on golden dragon.

---

According to the female azure ancient canon, this text is written with vermilion brush on yellow silk, performed at the deceased’s location, facing north at the hour of the Rat, burning five incense sticks, offering the five pacifications, then presenting the yellow silk charter, exposing the text overnight.

At dawn the next day, bury the charter on all sides to pacify the spirit and settle the form.

Those who practice it, the female azure text says:

The nine ancestors’ netherworld souls all immediately emerge from the long night, their bodies entering the light.

The Three Officials judge and record their names in the heavenly register, providing their kitchen and meals.

For thirty-two years, all return to their former forms and are reborn.

Those not yet returned, their forms and old dwellings become guarded by the Five Emperors’ attendants, protected by the earth gods, comforted and soothed, never to be disturbed.

Within one hundred years, none fail to transform and be reborn into the human path.

The Three Realms’ registers are clear and distinct.

The wise discern their utmost principle, examine their good and evil, cause and effect, clear and truthful, not false words.

The foolish accept fate and say otherwise.

The Three Officials’ realm is one of suffering and ruin—how truly lamentable!

The Celestial True Sovereign says:

In former times, within the Red Bright Heaven, there was a Daoist surnamed Zheng, styled Ren’an.

功 and virtue incomplete, he died in the northern border of Changshan among the Rong tribes.

His son Zhongming apprenticed under Master Mysterious Harmony, using this text to pacify Ren’an’s corpse and dwelling for thirty years.

Ren’an was delivered, destined to return to the human realm, but was burned by hunters; his form and bones rose in gloom.

Now he is the Southern Emperor of the Upper Palace.

His path to the Dao is clear and marked; now inscribed as the Supreme Ultimate Upper Palace Southern Pavilion, very distinct indeed.

The Celestial True Sovereign says:

In former times, in the Kingdom of Good Endurance, there was a Daoist surnamed (Wang + Huang), styled Xinran.

He apprenticed under the Impermanent Child, receiving the transmission of Numinous Treasure Extinguishing Deliverance and Ascension to Heaven.

功 and virtue insufficient, he died in the Green Origin Mountain, buried on the Isle of Flowing Life.

The Impermanent Child used this text to pacify his corpse.

After one hundred years, a great flood washed away the place, and he transformed and was born anew.

Now he is honored as the Primordial Spirit Elder Lord.

The Southern Palace records his Daoist deeds in the Purple Tenuity Hall.

The Celestial True Sovereign says:

In former times, in the Abandoned Worthy World, there was a Daoist surnamed Hao, styled Fuming.

In youth he loved mountains and waters, abandoned home and wandered afar.

功 and virtue incomplete, he died beneath the Earth Mirror Mountain.

His son Shaoxin apprenticed under Master Northern Enclosure, receiving this text to pacify Fuming’s corpse for seven hundred years.

He was refined and delivered by water and fire, then returned to the human realm.

Later he apprenticed under Master Black Text, receiving the transmission of ascension to heaven.

Now he is the Emperor of the Mysterious Elder.

The Southern Palace now records his Daoist deeds in the Northern Primordial Mysterious Window.

The Celestial True Sovereign says:

In the Central Primordial Heaven, Southern Floating World, there was a Daoist surnamed Wang, styled Duming.

In youth he traveled and studied, apprenticed under Lord Butcher True, receiving the five-script transmission of ascension to immortality.

功 and virtue insufficient, he died in the Eastern Mountain Guangling.

His son Jingxiu sought Master Dai Zhongjun, received this text to pacify the corpse for ninety years.

During the great desolation of Eastern Mountain, people dug earth for food, uncovering his corpse, and he immediately transformed and was born anew.

Later he completed the Dao and ascended to heaven, known as Perfected Jingxiao.

The Celestial True Sovereign says:

These gentlemen all accumulated learning and extinguishing deliverance, their Daoist achievements nearly complete, thus receiving this text to return to human life.

All transcend void and step through emptiness, ascend the Golden Pavilion, receiving the title of Natural.

Their deeds are not distant or obscure, beyond the understanding of the world.

Examining the nearer ones:

The disciples of the Yan Gate, Master Night Light; Master Stone of High Hill; Master Golden Mother of Hongya—all received the Numinous Treasure Extinguishing Deliverance Fivefold Refining method and transmission of ascension.

Yan Gate disciple died at Changqiu Mountain, Luoxian of Yuyang.

High Hill Master died at Gaofu Mountain, Wenxi County of Zhongshan.

Hongya Master died at Lang Mountain, Gusu County of Wuwei.

All received this text to pacify their tombs.

Yan Gate disciple’s tomb collapsed after forty years, his form transformed, later entering the great cave of Meng Mountain, the Golden Court, receiving the title Immortal Minister.

High Hill Master’s tomb was opened after seventy-two years, the coffin rotted and his form flew forth; now he is the Perfected One of the Central Peak.

Hongya Master’s tomb opened after one hundred twenty years, his corpse and form soared, receiving the title Perfected One of Qingcheng.

These sages all received the extinguishing deliverance method, the transmission of ascension, the Dao of spirit pacification, thus attaining exalted emptiness, soaring purity, riding the empty high mists, feasting in the Purple Tenuity, receiving the title Perfected One.

These recent events are no longer distant transmissions.

The Primordial Heavenly King commands the opening of the Primordial treasure trove, to inform the Supreme Ultimate Immortal.

Those who encounter it will have their past lives recorded for ten thousand kalpas, inscribed in the Upper Clarity, destined to attain the immortal path.

How can the men and women of the heavens not heed the voice of the female azure, keeping it secret and treasured?
