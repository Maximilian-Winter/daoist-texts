The Heavenly Venerable said:  
The First Grade of the Upper Origin is the Heavenly Official. At the genesis of primordial qi, the Three Luminaries shine forth, condensing the azure, yellow, and white qi, establishing the Three Palaces of the Upper Origin. The foremost palace is named the Supreme Mysterious Capital of the Primal Yang, the Seven Treasures Purple Tenuity Palace. Here gathers the azure primal yang qi, presiding over the Supreme True, the Natural Jade Void High Sovereign Emperor, the myriad heavenly emperors, the highest sages, and great spirits. This palace is layered with five hundred fifty-five billion five hundred fifty-five million five hundred fifty-five thousand five hundred and fifty-five strata, also containing five hundred fifty-five billion five hundred fifty-five million five hundred fifty-five thousand five hundred and fifty-five layers of azure yang qi.

Their garments are azure feathered flying robes. Within the Purple Tenuity Palace is the talisman of life extension; when inscribed and placed to secure the Eight Directions, the qi of the eight quarters swiftly arrives, responding to the living. Destroying the talisman by fire causes the person to dissolve with the smoke, returning to qi. Only those who have attained the Way through golden slips and jade names may wield this. The text emerges once every forty thousand kalpas, governed by the Solar Fire Official, enacted by the Supreme Mysterious Upper Prefecture.

The Upper Origin Heavenly Official establishes three palaces, three prefectures, and thirty-six bureaus; the Middle Origin Earth Official establishes three palaces, three prefectures, and forty-two bureaus; the Lower Origin Water Official establishes three palaces, three prefectures, and forty-two bureaus. Heaven, Earth, and Water Three Officials govern nine palaces, nine prefectures, and one hundred twenty bureaus.

Those who study the Way and perform good deeds or commit evil sins are each examined by their respective officials, all recorded accordingly. Heaven, Earth, and Water Three Officials each establish their own palaces, prefectures, and bureaus, with countless branches and alternative names, serving as inspectors and punishers, correcting the merits, faults, sins, and evils of people, listed in the Correct Bureaus. The one hundred twenty bureaus are the Correct Bureaus of Heaven, Earth, and Water.

Birth, death, sins, and blessings all begin with the body spirits, influencing and corresponding naturally. Humans are born from qi; qi condenses into spirit. If one can nourish qi, the spirit endures. Inner reflection and guarding the true self ensure the true self does not depart from the body. Those who obtain the Supreme Mysterious life extension talisman see the thirty-six thousand spirits condense qi into visible forms, rising with the human body, ascending to Heaven in broad daylight, galloping on cloud chariots, soaring into the void. When essence and qi are lost, myriad spirits scatter, the spirit wanders, qi disperses, and the empty corpse perishes.

The Three Primal Grades of Precepts contain sixty offenses each, totaling one hundred eighty precepts, each with yin and yang, left and right, water, fire, wind, and blade officials and examiners. The fifteenth day of the first lunar month is the Upper Origin’s day of precept review. The fifteenth day of the seventh lunar month is the Middle Origin’s day of precept review. The fifteenth day of the tenth lunar month is the Lower Origin’s day of precept review. These three days each year, all earthly and heavenly officials of the Five Emperors, Five Sacred Peaks, Spirit Mountains, Three Realms, and the Three Water Prefectures’ officials and punishers, countless and immeasurable, near and far, great and small, all gods and spirits, ascend together to the Supreme Three Heavens’ Mysterious Capital of the Three Primal Grades. They bring the records of those who have attained the Way and those yet to attain, the common people’s sons and daughters’ birth, death, fate, and karmic roots, merits and faults, weight and rank, all reported to Heaven. On these days, the Limitless Heavenly Venerable, the myriad great saints of the Ten Directions, the Thirty-Two Heavenly Emperors, the Flying Heavenly Divine Kings, the Most High Jade Void Supreme True Great Spirits, the Limitless Great Dao Most High Lord Lao, the Lords and Masters, the Five Elder Emperors, the Southern and Northern Poles, the East and West Two Splendors, the Nine Numinous True Mothers, the Southern Upper Origin Lord, the Supreme Harmony Jade Maiden, all arrive simultaneously at the Three Primal Grade Palaces. Once the assembly is complete, the heavenly flying immortals, divine immortals, true immortals, jade maidens, the Long Life Fate, Record, and Killing Officials, the Southern and Northern Dippers, the heavenly sun, moon, stars, celestial pivot, jade balance, and all gods arrive solemnly. The three palaces, nine prefectures, one hundred twenty bureaus, yin and yang, left and right, water, fire, wind, and blade examiners calculate the birth and death registers of Heaven and Earth, cross-checking and verifying. Those with good merits are recorded in the Blue Register; those with heavy sins are recorded in the Black Register, each compiled into a volume, reported to the Three Officials, listing merits, faults, good and evil, with no error. On these days, those who can follow the Three Primal Grade method of repentance, purify fasting, and burn incense, and act according to the mysterious regulations for one hundred days, will have the earthly officials and military guards of the right separate their gates and doors. After eight years of practice, they will all receive the Three Officials’ recommendation, be recorded in the Blue Register, and attain immortality, their Dao not lost.

The Dao Lord respectfully bows and dares to ask the Heavenly Venerable:  
Regarding the weight of merits and virtues, the stages of deliverance, the order of high and low, which comes first?  
The ancestors bore heavy responsibilities, stopping at their own bodies, flowing to descendants.  
If one’s own body commits evil, the body itself receives the retribution; it also harms ancestors and predecessors.  
Now seeing the common people’s sons and daughters, witnessing their worldly birth and suffering, enduring all hardships, unable to free themselves.  
Also seeing the dead’s forms and souls distressed, wandering the Three Paths and Five Pains, the Long River, Cold Court, Wind Blade, enduring countless kalpas without liberation.  
The scriptures sometimes say: the evil of the past body harms descendants.  
Sometimes say: one’s own sins are heavy, harming ancestors.  
Sometimes say: good and evil each have their karmic match, birth, death, sins, and blessings each have their fate.  
If such retribution of good and evil karmic matches is so, then all should return to one body, and there should be no further delay.  
Also say: without merits to deliver, the ancestors’ exiled souls cannot be freed.  
When merits are established, birth and death open to peace.  
If each has a karmic match, those who do evil will sink for countless kalpas, enduring the long night of the netherworld; how then can great merits be established to redeem and deliver oneself?  
If descendants build merits for the deceased, then delay and error occur, with no difference in principle.  
My shallow and narrow understanding cannot comprehend this.  
Since the Heavenly Venerable has opened the great pardon and clarified birth and death, it is fitting to make clear the judgments of the hidden and manifest, not allowing the ignorant to be confused by two contradictory doctrines.  
Having been honored with promotion and appointed to general command, I must proclaim the correct law and reveal the future life, wishing the Dharma’s sound to flow through the heavens, unbroken for countless kalpas, the orthodox Way enduring forever, birth and death receiving blessings and great pardon clearly.  
Therefore, I humbly present this petition, earnestly hoping the Heavenly Venerable will graciously bestow a single compassionate glance.

---

Then the Heavenly Venerable joyfully replied:  
Excellent, excellent. Your question is profound indeed.  
Though you have penetrated the spiritual void, the hidden source is not fully grasped.  
Though you have viewed the great existence, the Dragon River is hard to illuminate.  
Qi is inexhaustible, numbers cannot be counted to the end.  
Death returns to life, darkness returns to light.  
Heaven and Earth revolve like a wheel, human birth and death like shadow following form, thus it is difficult to end.  
Qi follows qi in succession, various birth conditions arise, good and evil, calamity and blessing, each with karmic roots.  
Neither Heaven nor Earth, nor human, but precisely the heart.  
The heart is spirit.  
The form is not truly mine.  
That which gives me life comes from emptiness and nature, relying on conditions to lodge in the womb, receiving transformation and birth.  
My birth parents are not my true original parents.  
They are greatly beloved and honored beyond measure.  
The parents who gave birth to me now are my lodging conditions, receiving nurturing and care, thus I repay them with propriety and call them parents.  
Therefore, the form I receive is not truly my form.  
It is lodged as a house, used as a dwelling to shelter me.  
Attached to it as form, it shows existence and non-existence.  
Thus, those who attain the Way no longer have form.  
When I have no body, what harm can there be?  
The reason there is harm is because I have a body.  
With a body, a hundred troubles arise; without a body, one enters nature.  
If one acts in accord with the Way, body and spirit become one.  
When body and spirit unite, that is the true body, returning to the original parents and attaining the Way, no longer suffering, never dying.  
Even at extinction, the spirit departs but the form does not turn to ashes.  
The whole life returns to its root, never departing.  
If the body commits a hundred evils, sins end and death occurs, called death.  
Death is destruction, returning to the lodging birth parents.  
If karmic debts are not finished, one cannot return to the true parents.  
The spirit fills the suffering and labor, forming dust; dust flies and transforms into vapor.  
When soul and spirit are freed, they mix with vapor, thus soul and vapor transform, unite as one, and are reborn, returning to human form.  
Form and spirit follow each other, never departing.  
Thus, good and evil, each body has its counterpart; how can blame be placed on ancestors or descendants?  
Before the Dragon River, until the Red Bright era, old texts said birth and death each belong to one body, neither extending upward nor flowing downward; sins and blessings stop at one, each bearing their own body.  
After the Red Bright era, reaching the Supreme Sovereign, human hearts were corrupted, men and women impure, jealous and harmful, contending and wounding each other, hearts unstable, invoking ancestors above and descendants below as oaths and evidence, accusing the divine, yet not believing themselves, breaking their oaths, causing the Three Officials to bind the registers.  
The body perishes, the ghost officials err, harming ancestors and descendants, causing calamities to spread, great and small connected, never resolved, disaster reaching the entire clan.  
Such evil people seek great calamity themselves.  
The scriptures clearly say they will never be united.  
The wise accumulate deeds and take responsibility for their own bodies, not seeking others.  
The old true texts are not empty words.

---

The Heavenly Venerable again told the Supreme Dao Lord:  
The great compassion of the Way is to deliver others first.  
No merit, no reward; no virtue, no promotion; no faith, no deliverance; no practice, no immortality.  
Those who build merits do so for Heaven and Earth, the Three Luminaries, the emperors and lords, the common people, ancestors, family, all beings, and themselves.  
The scripture says: to deliver oneself, one must first deliver others.  
If the multitudes cannot be delivered, one cannot deliver oneself.  
Great compassion is vast and far-reaching, benefitting endlessly, relied upon by Heaven and humans, especially the seven ancestors and grandparents.  
Can sins and blessings not be added?  
As for merits and virtues, there is cause and effect, sincerity and self-examination, Heaven’s turning of deliverance, one-minded feeling, human and spirit opening together, much more so for those lodged in the womb, receiving nurturing and growth.  
When compassion is deep, how can one not build heavy merits to open deliverance and repay the impoverished souls?  
Since the Dragon River until the Red Bright era, those who attained the Way and those in the present blessings, noble gates, good karmic lives, none but accumulated merits and virtues, their merits touching the heavens, bringing mutual repayment.  
Those who escape the long night of the Nine Nether and Long Night, none but those whose merits deliver and redeem, returning to the human world.  
The Southern Hill Vermilion Palace Nine Capitals Highest Grade all have their names, the principle of retribution, no error in the slightest.  
Year and month follow each other clearly.

---

The Dao Lord bows and says:  
Now hearing the Heavenly Venerable speak of karmic matches, merits, and retribution, all doubts vanish, heart joyful and clear, no lingering hesitation.  
I shall diligently devote my heart, proclaim the great Dharma, universally show the limitless world’s common people, sons and daughters, all to follow and uphold, everything clearly seen.

---

The Supreme Dao Lord reports to the Heavenly Venerable:  
Having received enlightenment and all doubts resolved, not discerning merits and virtues, which come first?  
Seeing the true scripture and wisdom’s highest grade deliverance of sin roots, to this end, and also having surplus methods, faith, vows, deliverance, teaching children, establishing quiet dwellings, offering to masters and treasures, spreading incense and oils, lighting lamps to illuminate the night, hearts practicing good thoughts, saving all beings, compassion, loyalty, filial piety, distributing to the poor, feeding the hundred birds, without stinginess—among these merits, which have weight and which are equal in rank and honor?  
Please graciously instruct.

---

The Heavenly Venerable said:  
All merits built have no great or small, no high or low; their merit is equal.  
The weight of retribution depends on the human heart.  
If the heart acts without laziness, enduring hardship without retreat, this merit is hard to name, virtue hard to call.  
Only sincerity without focused practice can at most avoid sin.  
Without heart, superficial goodness and giving bring no gain.  
A wealthy household cherishes treasures, unwilling to give, seeking deliverance of sin roots, only pushing their heart to seek the Way, hoping for great reward; this is vain and fruitless.  
Heaven’s Way does not force people to give treasures or make merits.  
Thus, observing stinginess and seeking the heart’s intent, if one has but does not give, what can be sought?  
The poor who generate heart, with firm and clear will, diligently serving the lineage, laboring without weariness, the Way already knows.  
Such people’s merits touch the heavens.  
Thus, giving treasures corresponds to the heart, pushing the heart corresponds to treasures; their merit is equal.  
The ancients sought the heart; the latter age seeks treasures.  
The ancients said without heart no immortality; the latter age says without treasures no deliverance.  
Therefore, with ten thousand pounds of gold, one volume of immortal scripture given to the poor mountains, in the latter age people covet gold, not scriptures.  
Gold harms the body; scriptures extend life.  
Knowing this, yet unable to avoid stinginess and greed, how can one attain the ultimate Way?  
Thus, those who do not propagate the Way are called so.  
The true scripture’s method, wisdom’s highest grade, deliverance of sin roots, applied to birth and death, is very weighty.  
As for scholars, their bodies not yet settled, dwelling in clamor, how can they avoid gain and loss?  
All actions and deeds carry sins and blessings.  
Thus, the Three Officials, Nine Prefectures, One Hundred Twenty Bureaus, left and right, yin and yang, water, fire examiners govern human gain and loss.  
Good merits are listed in the Left Official; evil deeds in the Right Palace, each by year, month, day, distance, and weight, examining and urging merits and virtues.  
Retribution is like the meeting of waves, bound to arrive, never missing by even one.  
Only the weight and distance differ.  
Now this is told to diligently proclaim, so that all good men and women in future lives know Heaven and Earth respond unexpectedly, truly and clearly.  
Now entrusted with the Three Primal Grade repentance method.  
The ancient scripture of the Primal Origin Supreme Way is secreted within the Three Primal Grade Palaces, appearing once every ten thousand kalpas, not transmitted to future generations.  
Those who hope for its chapters and titles will free their karmic roots, untie their bonds, and release themselves.  
Treasure and practice it, and great blessings will surely come.  
Lightly reveal it, and disaster will come to destroy the clan.  
Speak with utmost sincerity, deeply heed the regulations.  
The Dao Lord rejoices, bows, and salutes.  
At this time, all heavens simultaneously praise and bow to carry out the teaching.
