## The Most High Great Dao: Three Primal Grades of Precepts for Repentance and Atonement, Supreme Method

The Heavenly Venerable spoke:

All who cultivate the supreme method must, on the fifteenth day of the first, seventh, and tenth months, at the three times of dawn, midday, and midnight, bathe their body and form, cleansing with five fragrant herbs. When bathing, face southwest, using a golden ladle to stir the fragrant water, turning thirty-two times to the left toward the southeast.

Close your eyes and envision sunlight resting upon your left eye, moonlight upon your right. The five planets, adorned with tassels, crown your head. Five-colored clouds swirl around your body. The Azure Dragon and White Tiger, Vermilion Bird and Black Tortoise, Lion and White Crane array themselves to your left and right. Immortal children hold your cloth, jade maidens scatter blossoms, flying immortals ride steeds, guarding your form.

Then, tap your teeth twenty-one times, chanting the incantation:

> Heaven is clear, air pure, five colors shining bright.  
> Sun and moon emit radiance, bathing my body’s light.  
> Divine channels cleanse within, incense lifts and refines essence.  
> Light and shadow penetrate, illuminating the Supreme Clarity.  
> Qi resists dust’s embrace, five palaces receive spirit’s grace.  
> Sins vanish in three realms, calamities dissolve in nine darknesses.  
> Evil roots severed clean, blessings and fortune arise serene.  
> Today I vow great wishes, all pledges here confessed.  
> My body receives liberation, ascending to the imperial court blessed.

Upon completion, swallow the incense water with thirty-two turns. Then cleanse the five spirits through bathing. After bathing, don your crown, belt, and robes. Again, tap your teeth twelve times, chanting:

> Five impurities now cleared, eight lights shining bright.  
> Today I undergo refining, sins vanish, blessings ignite.  
> Forever with the Five Emperors, fasting true, highest spirits in sight.

Then step forth into your chamber, proceeding to practice the dao according to the method. Facing east, burn incense, tap your teeth thirty-two times, and recite the prayer:

> Most Supreme Three Heavens, Mysterious Origin, Primordial Three Qi, Most High Lord Lao,  
> Summon forth from my body the three and five merit officers, left and right officials and messengers,  
> Left and right attendants bearing incense, dragon riders, jade youths attending incense, jade maidens conveying words,  
> Five Emperors’ direct seals, direct day incense officers, each thirty-two in number.  
> Those who emerge are solemnly arrayed, opening the true officials and spirits of this land and domain.  
> I now properly burn incense and walk the dao, presenting my petitions and wishes.  
> May the true qi of the Ten Directions enter my body swiftly,  
> So that my summons reach the Most Supreme Heavenly Venerable, Most High Great Dao, True Supreme Emperor of Limitlessness.

I, disciple so-and-so, born of past karmic affinity, granted life by the dao’s transformation, enlightened by Master of the Three Caverns, so-and-so, who revealed and lifted me, opening salvation from decay, studying scripture and method, overwhelmed by boundless grace.

Yet I was born and raised in the mundane world, five spirits contending, dust deep and sins foul, never self-aware, growing with sin. Mountains and seas accumulate, from past lives until now, unaware of fate’s origin. Through countless kalpas until today, sins are recorded in heaven and earth, in which register? Held by the Three Officials, detained by earth’s servitors.

Though I strive to cultivate, no response is felt; true spirit does not descend, demons assail, thoughts scatter, five spirits flee. I constantly fear that one day I shall return to the dark abyss, entangled in endless kalpas, never to be freed.

Therefore, on this great auspicious day of the Three Primal Celebrations, I purify and burn incense, first humbly repenting all offenses committed in past lives and this present one—sins unforgiven by Heaven, unpardoned by Earth, unpitied by spirits, unrelented by ghosts, countless offenses and transgressions.

Violations of the Three Primal’s one hundred and eighty precepts, the Three Officials’ nine palaces and one hundred and twenty offices, yin and yang, water and fire, left and right central palaces’ examining officers.

Now I burn incense, returning my body, spirit, and fate to the Most Supreme Heavenly Venerable, Most High Dao Lord, the Thirty-Two Celestial Emperors, the Great Saints of the Ten Directions, the True Lords and Ancestors, Flying Heavenly Kings, Celestial Immortals, Earth Immortals, the Five Sacred Mountains’ perfected beings and jade maidens, the celestial sun, moon, and stars, the Jade Balance and Celestial Pivot, and all spirits and officials of the Ten Directions on Earth, the Three Realms’ Five Emperors, the Three Officials’ Nine Palaces and One Hundred and Twenty Offices, the Three Rivers, Four Seas, Nine Rivers, and Eight Extremes’ host of gods and spirits.

I beseech great grace: wholly forgive and absolve all sins committed in past and present lives. By the merit of this incense offering, uproot the root of sin, erase the black register of the Right Palace, sever the records of the Right Office, and grant passage into the Left Palace’s record of longevity and vitality, that I may be saved by immortals and forever enjoy boundlessness.

Upon attaining the dao, I shall ascend into the formless, uniting with the True.

### First, facing east, perform nine deep bows, kneeling long, and say:

I, so-and-so, now surrender my fate to the Eastern Limitless Most High Spirit Treasure Heavenly Venerable, the Great Saints who have attained the Dao, the True Supreme Spirits, the Supreme Clarity Mysterious Origin Most High Three Heavens Limitless Great Dao, the Celestial Elder of Heaven, Most High Lord Lao, Most High Ancestor, Emperor Lord Lao, Emperor Ancestor, Azure Spirit Supreme, Lords of the Heavens, Heavenly Emperors and Ancestors, Supreme Emperor Lords, Nine Elders of the Immortal Capital, Nine Qi Ancestors, and so forth, hundreds of thousands of layers of Dao qi, one thousand two hundred official lords, Supreme Clarity Jade Throne Eastern Extreme Elder Azure Splendor Great God, Prime Minister Sima Azure Youth Lord, Golden Palace Rear Saint Emperor Lord, True Yang Prime Azure Spirit, Spirit Treasure Nine Immortal Lords, Azure Harmony Jade Maidens, Chief Immortal Jade Gentlemen, all spirits of the Eastern Limitless World.

I humbly pray for great mercy and pardon, forgive me for all offenses committed from past lives until this day—disrespect toward the great saints of the heavens, all spirits of the Eastern Limitless World, sun, moon, stars, four seasons, Five Phases, wind, rain, thunder, lightning, clouds, and mist; disrespect toward masters and elders, the Five Sacred Mountains, Four Rivers, Three Rivers, Four Seas, Nine Rivers, Eight Extremes’ perfected beings, immortals, jade maidens, local spirits of the East, the Three Realms’ earth deities, the Three Officials’ Nine Offices, all divine beings.

I have deceived my masters, betrayed the dao, defiled the heavenly scriptures, stolen sacred texts, altered spiritual sounds, spread the supreme dharma for profit, privately transmitted teachings, broken the Five Emperors’ covenant, plotted rebellion, acted without loyalty, kindness, filial piety, love, or benevolence; rebelled against sovereign and father, harmed living beings, plundered people, violated others’ wives, committed kinship transgressions, mingled clans, envied and competed, sought fame and status, spoke with forked tongue, attacked the virtuous, drank wine, ate meat, polluted the five spirits, cursed and insulted without cause, acted without reason, on fasting days showed capricious anger, slighted orphans, the lowly, widows, abandoned the elderly, oppressed the poor, favored the powerful.

Such sins are countless, accumulated over lifetimes, tightly bound and unyielding.

With this incense, I return my fate to the East, humbly beseeching great mercy and pardon, forgiving all sins committed from countless kalpas until now.

I vow to renew myself, to obey prohibitions, and never to offend again.

I petition to erase the Three Officials’ sin records, the Right Palace’s black register, and sever the root of evil, to be recorded in the Left Palace’s azure register of life.

On this great auspicious day, I open my heart and humbly confess, surrendering to the Heavenly Venerable, beseeching gods, immortals, and true lords to unite with me in the same lineage, fostering auspicious connections, so that in future lives and countless generations, I may forever enjoy naturalness.

Most High Limitless Great Dao, Most High Dao Lord, Most High Lord Lao, Most High Ancestor, Supreme Mysterious Elder, Limitless Great Dao of the Ten Directions, Dao Virtue Saints and Heavenly Venerables, True Supreme Heavenly Emperor, Heavenly Emperor, Celestial Master Lord, Spirit Treasure Fasting Master.

We, once foolish mortals, unworthy and lowly, yet fond of the Dao and joy in immortality, mistakenly entrusted with the dharma, have attained the Nine Mysteries of Ascending Radiance, our will exhausted of folly, striving with hair and skin, jointly guiding each other.

On this day of the month, at this hour, in this county and village, we establish the fasting altar, burn incense, recite scriptures, contemplate spirit and truth, day and night, at this hour walk the Dao, offering thanks for cultivation.

When the matter is complete, we summon the flying immortals of the Three Caverns, celestial immortals, earthly immortals, five-direction heavenly soldiers and riders, attending scripture and incense jade youths and maidens, spirit treasure officials, fasting supervisors, all true beings, Five Sacred Mountains, Four Rivers, Four Directions supervising true officials and spirits, who visit the True Palace, present offerings to the highest immortals, confer ranks and imperial titles, assign offices and true posts, all according to the Supreme True rites.

May we seek the Dao and attain the Dao, seek immortality and become immortal.

May we divide and transform our forms, seventy-four directions, descend the Three Primes, descend the green carriage, fly to Supreme Clarity, ascend the Nine Heavens of Ascending Radiance, sun and moon shining together, Three Treasures united in wheel.

Yet we humbly confess, Most Holy One, supervising our alchemical intentions, our study of the method is incomplete, our fasting rites imperfect, our ceremonies not fully in accord, our conduct flawed, violating regulations, corrected by the Four Supervisors, held by the Five Emperors, bearing countless offenses and sins.

We beseech pardon and forgiveness, pity our ignorance, that we do not see our sins and punishments.

Within our bodies dwell the five true officials, who, according to merit, ascend to the Mysterious Capital, receive ranks, complete their duties, then return to us, ascending with us, flying through the vast emptiness.

We humbly report all this, trembling with reverence, bowing twice.

---

Having completed thanks, turn left, return west, face east, light incense three times, and chant:

> Incense officials and messengers, left and right dragon-tiger lords, incense bearers, dragon riders,  
> Command that in my quiet chamber and fasting hall, natural golden liquid, elixir essence of myriad spirits, and rare herbs converge before this incense fire.  
> Grant that I may attain the Dao, thereby obtain immortality, my whole family blessed, above and below receiving grace,  
> Ten directions’ jade youths and maidens attend incense and smoke, convey my petitions directly to the Limitless Most High Great Dao.

The Heavenly Venerable said:

This Three Primal Grade Sincere Repentance and Atonement Supreme Method, within the Three Primal Palaces, hides the form and spirit, refining the root of sin with focused thought.

Cultivating immortality and ascending the Dao, the scholar practices thrice yearly.

When practiced, the heart, elixir, and mind are fully devoted, spirit and form endure hardship without rest, sensing and penetrating the heavens.

The Three Primes erase sins from the black register, the Northern Emperor removes death and grants rebirth, the Three Officials endorse merit in study, the Supreme Mystery records it among the highest immortals.

Those who seek the Dao must endure hardship to attain clarity, must have elixir to feel response, must be diligent to succeed, must have merit to obtain, must have will to conquer, must have heart to complete.

Let the body labor at the start, the spirit rejoice at the end, ultimately attaining non-action, entering naturalness.

Those mired in sin cherish play, treasures, worldly pleasures, momentary glory—how can they know the end? The end returns to suffering, burning in the three palaces, endlessly sinking through myriad kalpas. When will they return?

Thus, the wise and foolish differ, their aspirations and deeds diverge. The foolish prize beginnings, the wise cherish the end. Foolishness and wisdom are distinct—how can they be spoken of alike?

The Heavenly Venerable said:

Those studying who have not attained the Dao bear their karmic burdens, recorded by the Three Officials, held by the Nine Palaces, examined by the one hundred and twenty offices, evil roots unextinguished, demons invading, five spirits contending, body afflicted unknowingly, sins daily growing, true spirit fleeing.

Though seeing many methods, the root of sin is not released, only laboring the mind, gaining nothing until death.

Now, on the great auspicious day of the Three Primes, the heavens return to their seats, saints gather, reviewing the records of life and death, merit and fault.

The Dao method is universally compassionate, loving and nurturing all beings.

Those whose sins are seen are recorded in the death register, bound through kalpas, never freed, learning is useless—how grievous!

Now the Purple Yang Jade Register is opened, revealing the Three Primal Grade Sincere Repentance and Atonement Supreme Method, to save learners and complete their merit, proclaiming the heavenly laws and all their articles.

Learners who have not attained the Dao, regardless of merit or fault, all with heart accept the great method, extinguish the sin registers, and have their names entered in the immortal register.

Henceforth, universally proclaim to the heavens: no high or low, no deep or far, no great or small, no end or limit, no hidden or obscure, no sound or echo, silent and profound, mysterious and penetrating, great wisdom origin.

The Three Palaces, Nine Palaces, one hundred and twenty offices, all spirits and gods, none do not accept and serve.

At this time, the great saints of the heavens, Limitless Venerables, Most High Dao Lords, stand long, raise their hands, announce to all, snap fingers in approval.

At this moment, the Heavenly Venerable opens great mercy; all men and women who begin study reverently cultivate the great method, all are saved, their bodies gain immortality, ascending to the void by day, rising to the imperial palace.

Those with good hearts and faith who revere and uphold it all gain salvation, turning the wheel of life and death without passing through earth’s servitude, their merit complete, virtue full, attaining the immortal path, ranks equal to flying immortals, roaming the Ten Directions.

The Heavenly Venerable said:

Those who, on the great auspicious day of the Three Primes, cultivate the Three Primal Grade Sincere Repentance and Atonement Method, the Three Officials and Nine Palaces’ right registers, the Five Emperors’ endorsements, list their names in the heavens, true beings rejoice, myriad gods open pardon, karmic bonds loosen, sin roots universally dissolved.

The Three Assemblies are fully moved, the Three Palaces, Nine Palaces, one hundred and twenty offices examine and arrest, erasing black registers, severing old roots, inscribing names in the Left Contract Azure Register, guarded by myriad spirits, overseen by the Three Realms, welcoming by officials, demons subdued, a thousand disasters prevented, Dao truth naturally arising, attaining immortality.
