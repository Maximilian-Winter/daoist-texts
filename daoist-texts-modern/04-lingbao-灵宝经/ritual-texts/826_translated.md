Lady Qing of the Most Profound Dao said:  
The Ultimate Dao Jade Emperor, in the primal kalpa of Dragon Han, above the Three Heavens, together with the august saints of the heavens, the true immortals of the Ten Directions, and countless great sages, expounded the Great Law of the Three Caverns—the *Three Primordials’ Scripture of Sincere Marvels*. At that time, the officials of the Three Realms, the heavenly gods and immortals, numbering in the hundreds of billions, all gathered, respectfully seated, attentively listening to the Dharma’s sound.

Then, the Primordial Heavenly Venerable addressed the great assembly:  
“I now broadly proclaim to all beings within and beyond the Three Realms the wondrous Dharma of the Three Vehicles, the precious Scripture of the Three Caverns. To enlighten humans and heavens alike, I descend in accord with conditions to receive the beings of the Lower Origin. In the final age, men and women hear not the Dao’s law, suffer wrongful killing, and many do not complete their destined years. This is because living beings’ karma is heavy and sins deep, turning away from true transformation, forsaking the genuine for the false, resorting only to evil conduct. After death, their souls find no refuge, bound and lodged in the hells of Fengdu. When kalpas end and mountains vanish, there is no way to liberation. You beings must save all within the myriad worlds, throughout the lands of the Ten Directions, all faithful men and women. From now on, they shall recite the *Three Primordials’ Precious Scripture*, Lady Qing’s wondrous canon. The merits of this scripture transcend the heavens above and aid the long night below; blessings are boundless, grace abundant. It spares one from the moment of life’s end, preventing the soul’s descent into Fengdu to suffer retribution.”

At that moment, the Heavenly Official of the First Origin, the Purple Tenuity Emperor, Lord of the Nine Qi, formed the talisman of life and the primal breath of the first yang, embodying utmost truth. He dwells in the Palace of the Purple Tenuity, Upper Palace of the Mysterious Capital’s Primordial Yang, adorned with seven treasures and the azure mist. His throne is of five clouds, his bed of purple gold; he leans on a table of blue jade, holding a jade scepter. To his left and right, ranks of gods and immortals stand in orderly guard. His palace of the First Origin stretches fifty million li, formed entirely of azure and dark blue qi. He presides over the Supreme True Natural Jade Void High Emperor, the celestial lords and true immortals, the sovereigns, ministers, empresses, consorts, princes, crown princes, officials, their retinues, and all the people under heaven—noble or humble, guilty or virtuous. Among them, the divine officials and bureaucrats all embody the qi of nature itself. None but those recorded in the Golden Pavilion Jade Registers as having attained the Dao may behold this.

Within the Purple Tenuity Palace are three courts: left, right, and central. The left court governs birth, overseen by the Solar Fire Official; the right court governs death, overseen by the Lunar Water Official; the central court governs birth, death, sin, and merit, overseen by the Wind Blade Official. These three courts manage thirty-six departments, each commanding nine hundred million officials. On the evening of the First Origin, they examine all within the myriad worlds and Ten Directions’ lands, the causes and effects of birth, death, sin, and merit. All beings, devout and reverent, pay their respects.

The right thirty-six departments of Immortal Officials are under the stewardship of Lady Qing of the Most Profound Dao, belonging to the Purple Tenuity Palace. Each court has one chief examiner, one thousand two hundred clerks, twelve thousand soldiers, and one hundred twenty thousand officers. They oversee the records of those who have attained the Dao, those who have not, the registers of merits and demerits, the sovereigns, ministers, heavenly princes, empresses, consorts, officials, and all faithful men and women.  

On the fifteenth day of the first lunar month each year, the Heavenly Official of the First Origin, the Purple Tenuity Emperor, examines the myriad worlds and lands of the Ten Directions. From the highest heavens, the registers of the ascent and descent of gods and immortals, the stars overseeing the rise and fall of lands and nations, to the rulers, worthy ministers, princes, and all beings’ allotted terms, down to the fish, dragons, and transformations of myriad creatures changing their forms, rising and sinking through months and years.  

Within the Three Paths and Nine Courts, the names of sins and their years and kalpa limits are recorded. Those destined to be born human have their names erased from the Long Night’s register and inscribed in the Left Palace’s ledger. Those destined to become various colors of evil spirits, demons, and ghosts are recorded in the Right Palace’s black register. When their time is fulfilled, they again transform, receiving punishments according to their karma’s weight.  

Among them, sinful souls become myriad creatures, distributed by severity of sin: some as wolves, tigers, leopards; some as donkeys, horses, camels, mules; some as cattle, sheep, geese, ducks; some as chickens, dogs, pigeons, owls; some as deer, foxes, rabbits; some as sparrows, flies, insects; some as beetles, snakes, rats; some as ants, mosquitoes, gnats; some as deer, qilin; some as turtles, tortoises; some as dragons, giant clams, mountain spirits; some as whales, sea horses; some as snails, shellfish, fish; some as pheasants, peacocks; some as hawks, falcons, flying squirrels; some as toads, fleas, lice; some as centipedes, millipedes; some as loaches, jellyfish; some as crabs, spiders; some as strange beasts of various forms, birds, fish, and wild beasts flying wildly.  

Such myriad creatures, some running, some flying, some walking, some sitting; some with many feet, some without feet; some born live, some hatched from eggs; some dwelling in dryness, some in moisture; some nesting in trees, some living in caves; a hundred forms, a thousand transformations, impossible to name precisely. Some dwell by ancient trees and strange rocks; some inhabit deep pools, springs, and marshes; some cling to hills and cliffs; some dwell by wells, stoves, ditches; some live among humans as various monsters. All these myriad beings bearing life’s mandate await their appointed time of reckoning.  

On the night of the Heavenly Official’s examination, they transform according to karma, receiving rewards or punishments, revolving through kalpas, living and dying according to cause and condition, with no further distinctions.  

If there are faithful men or women who resolve to write and copy this scripture, distribute and recite it, offer incense, flowers, and precious canopies to the heavens, all their sins shall be utterly extinguished. Whether during the eve of the Three Primordials’ day, ritual offerings to the heavens, or on the ten auspicious days, reciting this scripture brings boundless blessings.

Lady Qing said:  
“The merits of this scripture can dissolve the grudges of a hundred lives, erase sins accumulated through myriad kalpas, extinguish faults of the embodied, remove calamities born of falsehood, liberate from the suffering of birth and death, and relieve hearts burdened by evil. From now on, if any beings suffer official calamities, illnesses, curses, or enemies, they should recite this scripture. If plagued by pestilence, epidemics, or invaded by ghosts and demons, they must hold this scripture. If seeking prosperity, venturing into the sea for wealth, or undertaking construction, moving earth, establishing homes or tombs, they should recite this scripture. If encountering misfortune in fame or office, setbacks in rank, journeys by boat, or fears of storms and waves, they should recite this scripture. If wishing to open the path through the long night, rescue wandering souls, resolve past calamities, and save the suffering in the netherworld, they need only recite this scripture to gain immeasurable blessings.  

If locusts, floods, warfare arise, causing rulers to worry and people to perish, then at a pure place, or ancient altar or sacred temple, establish a Daoist altar, hang banners and canopies, and recite this scripture continuously. When lamps are lit, great rituals performed under the five stars and heavenly constellations, the land will be purified and peaceful, times harmonious and customs tranquil. Locusts and warfare will naturally dissolve, floods and droughts will be overcome.  

If faithful men or women are born under misfortune, with declining fortunes, long illnesses beyond cure, or repeatedly imprisoned, or possessed by evil spirits, they must copy this scripture, distribute it among beings, and recite it together. Those who do so will see disasters resolved, evils vanish, lives prolonged, and blessings multiplied.”

Lady Qing said:  
“All beings revolve through birth and death, their retributions and rewards manifesting without the slightest error. They all await the day of the Three Primordials, the night of the Three Officials’ records, to be assigned birth and death, wealth and poverty, human and ghostly paths, and myriad beasts. Those destined for blessings are inscribed in the Left Palace; those destined for ghosts or beasts are inscribed in the Right Palace. All await their appointed time.”

Lady Qing said:  
“All faithful men and women who attain the name of immortal shall have their merits and demerits recorded on jade tablets. Some may have their fallen grades and karmic retributions removed, just as in the Purple Tenuity Palace’s registers. They are sealed in the Mysterious Capital’s Bright True Jade Chest, the First Origin Heavenly Official’s White Palace, awaiting the day the Three Officials assemble the saints to determine the registers of ascent and descent of gods and immortals, and the deep causes and effects of good and evil men and women, their lifespan calculations and limits, down to the Nine Nether Realms, removing the limits of birth and death, the stirring of life and transformation, decline and flourishing. On the day of the First Origin, these are reported to the Most High Void Emperor Dao Lord.”

Lady Qing said:  
“If within the myriad worlds and lands of the Ten Directions, all good and evil men and women, their birth, death, sins, merits, weights of karma, and lifespan calculations—year, month, day, and limit—are all separately recorded in blue and black registers and presented to the Upper Palace. If their good merits are sufficient, they shall ascend to the Purple Tenuity Palace. Those who revere the Mysterious Primordial Supreme Great Law are said to be in the Left Palace of the Supreme Ultimate, their names inscribed in the Golden Register, carved in the Immortal Departments. The Earthly Official’s guards are instructed to record these in the Upper Palace, protecting the Three Realms from all external demons, just as Lady Qing’s laws decree.”

“Now, inscribe the azure and dark registers. I hereby record the Supreme True Chief’s registers of birth and death, listing the categories as follows. You beings must reverently observe:”

- Supreme True Chief’s register of meditation titles, ranks, merits, and demerits  
- Supreme True Chief’s register of all saints’ court rituals, revolving merits and demerits  
- Supreme True Chief’s register of great saints’ banquets and attendant merits and demerits  
- Supreme True Chief’s register of birth and death charts and registers of merits and demerits  
- Supreme True Chief’s register of birth and death fate registers and calculations of merits and demerits  
- Supreme True Chief’s register of merits and demerits’ weights and measures  
- Supreme True Chief’s register of ghosts and spirits’ duties, retributions, and revolutions of merits and demerits  
- Supreme True Chief’s register of ghosts and spirits’ exile and liberation years and limits of merits and demerits  
- Supreme True Chief’s register of ghosts and spirits’ ascents, liberations, deaths, and rebirths of merits and demerits  
- Supreme True Chief’s register of dead souls’ refining and rebirth registers of merits and demerits  
- Supreme True Chief’s register of immortals’ attainment of the Dao, purity, ranks, and merits and demerits  
- Supreme True Chief’s register of myriad demons’ songs and sounds of merits and demerits  

Previously, the Supreme True Chief oversaw all merits and demerits within the Three Realms and lands of the Ten Directions. Each year on the eve of the Three Primordials, the blue and black registers are submitted to the Upper Palace, revealing the depths of sins and merits, the opening of liberation, and the manifestation of karmic retribution, with no distinction between humans and heavens. You beings must recite this scripture, hold incense and flowers, make various offerings, and you shall have your calamities forever removed, blessings increase like the vast ocean, lawsuits not invade, and life and death find peace.  

I now proclaim to all beings within the myriad worlds and lands of the Ten Directions: repent all sins so that they may be entirely wiped away, no more evil retribution. Repent all good men and women who do not believe in the sacred Dao scripture’s sincerity, harboring doubt and divided hearts. Repent disciples who slight the supreme Dao’s sacred texts, who criticize the classics. Repent disciples who steal Dao images and scriptures, or deface them, or hold them without reverence for master and tradition. Repent disciples who self-teach the Three Caverns’ scriptures and methods, then pass them on to disciples. Repent disciples who slight their masters, breaking vows. Repent disciples who slander their masters, disrespecting Heaven’s righteousness. Repent disciples who conceal the Three Caverns’ scriptures, preventing their circulation. Repent disciples who obtain immortal scriptures and wondrous methods, then recklessly transmit them to unworthy persons. Repent disciples who receive scriptures but do not follow the prescribed rules, lightly divulging spiritual texts. Repent disciples who transmit scriptures but do not respect the master’s agreements. Repent disciples who receive scriptures but do not open the way for all beings. Repent disciples who destroy or damage the Mysterious Primordial Sacred Dao scriptures, images, and ritual objects without cause. Repent disciples who transmit scriptures without reporting to the heavens, covenanting with the Five Emperors and Three Officials, violating ritual protocol. Repent disciples who receive scriptures but lack faith and respect, belittling the law and masters. Repent disciples who block the Daoist path, preventing its spread, seeking fame for themselves. Repent disciples who on the new and full moon days neglect masters, behaving arrogantly. Repent disciples who on fasting and offering days fail to offer incense properly, neglecting all beings. Repent disciples who recite scriptures carelessly, lacking a heart to save beings, boasting of their quickness. Repent all who seek the Dao but act out of order, competing for merit and fame. Repent disciples who after receiving the Dao, when their families suffer disasters, fail to reflect on their faults, blaming the Dao and masters. Repent disciples who slander good people, falsely accuse the sun and moon, lightly regard the sacred Dao, and honor heretical teachings. Repent disciples who engage in double-tongued slander, drink wildly, and criticize the four ranks. Repent disciples who are greedy, arrogant, and defile the true vehicle. Repent disciples who have cursed ghosts and spirits, spoken false words, and killed living beings. Repent disciples who have committed adultery, obscenity, jealousy, theft. Repent disciples who deceive masters, disrespect the law, and reveal immortal secrets. Repent disciples who slander scriptures, forcibly suppress beings, and do not follow the true Dharma. Repent disciples who speak ill of others to gain fame, whose words and hearts contradict, secretly practicing poison and evil, belittling immortals and sages, relying on their own merits. Repent disciples who bully fellow students, neglect beings, causing unrest. Repent disciples who defile the Three Treasures, damage true rituals, judge sacred texts as false, favor heretical teachings, slander the Great Vehicle, cause the good to act badly, rely on wealth and power to damage spiritual texts, deceive beings to bring calamity, envy and harm the virtuous, destroy immortal temples, call truth false, seize blessed lands, ally with evil to protect the strong, destroy mysterious altars, damage spiritual abodes. All such sins, upon hearing and reciting this scripture, shall be entirely extinguished.

Moreover, repent disciples from beginningless time until today who have harmed good and benefited evil, sought profit at others’ expense, forbidden beings, cut off grain and water, enforced harsh laws, set fire to mountains, harmed sentient beings, dried up streams, killed insects and fish, cut off springs, deprived others of love and respect, divided kin, sought profit and fame, harmed the good, scattered poison, killed sentient beings, exploited beings for their own abundance, falsely interpreted scriptures against the sacred heart, disparaged spiritual texts as false, failed to investigate the Three Caverns’ origins, destroyed the Three Pure Ones’ scriptures and images. Such countless sins are as numerous as dust and sand, beyond reckoning, all recorded by the Thirty-Six Departments of the Heavenly Official, the Wind Blade’s examination.

If within the myriad worlds and lands of the Ten Directions, all faithful men and women, from beginningless time until today, or their parents, siblings, kin, or relatives have committed such sins, they must recite, copy, distribute, and recite this scripture among beings to gain boundless blessings and endless merit. All such sins, old and new calamities, shall be extinguished and all shall be liberated.

At that time, the assembly of heavens bowed and faithfully practiced, composing this hymn:

“Primordial Heaven, Originless Beginning, Supreme Dharma King.  
Grace pervades the Three Realms, blessings reach the Ten Directions.  
All beings rely on this, all creatures thrive.  
The Dharma’s sound flows and changes, rescuing existence and extinction.  
The Nine Nether Realms find liberation, the Five Pains are without calamity.  
The cold pool thaws, darkness flows with light.  
Reciting, holding, and offering, yields boundless blessings and auspiciousness.”

Lady Qing of the Most Profound Dao said:  
The Second Origin’s two ranks, the Earthly Official Pure Void True Lord, commands the left, right, and central three courts, totaling forty-two departments. The Immortal Officials of the three courts are all composed of the qi of the Cavern Void, Pure Emptiness, and Primordial Chaos. Their palaces each stretch fifty million li, presided over by the five emperors and the gods and immortals of the Five Sacred Mountains. The total number of Immortal Officials is nine hundred million. They govern all beings within the myriad worlds and lands of the Ten Directions, recording all good and evil men and women’s births and deaths, their karmic retributions, lifespan lengths, wealth and poverty, and the numbers of years, months, and limits.  

Even the birds and beasts of the world, all moving creatures, insects, and fish, their times of transformation, all follow their allotted limits, recorded in the Purple Tenuity Upper Palace, awaiting the Heavenly Official’s examination. Those who transform according to blessings and alter their forms according to karma each have their own lifespan and limits. If a being has many karmic obstacles and suffers misfortune, offerings of exotic flowers, precious fruits, pure water, and fragrant incense should be made day and night with diligent sincerity, reciting this scripture, performing the Three Primordials’ rituals, observing the eight festivals, and speaking of merits. They will then have their calamities forever removed, their names recorded in golden tablets.  

The merits of this scripture can cure myriad diseases, dispel all suffering, resolve disasters, eliminate all evils, gather a thousand auspicious signs, attain a hundred blessings, support lifespan calculations, and rescue those sunk in the netherworld. You beings must hold and maintain it to gain boundless blessings. Now I reveal the positions of the forty-two Immortal Officials of the left, right, and central three courts. You beings who can offer them support will aid those in the nether prisons beyond measure. All are devout and respectful.

The right palace’s forty-two departments of Immortal Officials are established by Lady Qing of the Most Profound Dao, belonging to the Cavern Void Pure Emptiness Palace. Each court has left, right, and central divisions. Each court has one chief examiner, one hundred twenty clerks, one thousand two hundred officers, and twelve thousand soldiers. They govern the gods of the Five Sacred Mountains, the Nine Earthly Soil Emperors, the Four Pillars and Eight Extremes, all Immortal Officials, and those who have attained the Dao, as well as faithful men and women’s records of merits, demerits, sins, and blessings.  

Those with great blessings are examined every three years; those with medium blessings every nine years; those with small blessings every twenty-four years. Sins and merits proceed together, rewards and punishments correspond. Their registers are sealed in the Five Sacred Mountains’ Cavern Palaces, awaiting the eve of the Three Primordials, the day the Three Officials assemble the saints, and the night of examination. The upper examination reviews the limits of gods and spirits’ transformations; the middle examines all Dao practitioners’ gains and losses in the myriad worlds; the lower examines all ghosts and spirits’ transformations and duties within the Three Realms.  

Throughout the lands of the Ten Directions, all mountains, caves, rivers, seas, earth, stones, ancient trees, springs, dragons, lions, peacocks, phoenixes, turtles, tortoises, insects, fish, tigers, leopards, monkeys, deer, dragons, pheasants, wolves, dogs, pigeons, sparrows, mice, flying creatures, fish, and wild beasts—four-legged, two-legged, many-legged, or legless; live-born or egg-born; nest-dwelling or burrow-dwelling; water or mud inhabitants; relying on ancient trees or springs; inhabiting spiritual altars, wells, stoves, hills, ancient tombs, or sacred relics—each with various forms and strange appearances, these beasts, spirits, demons, and ghosts, whether bringing blessings or disasters to humans, all await their appointed destiny and examination.  

Though they dwell in the world, they are not fixed. If they cannot harm humans, at the time of examination they shall be transformed into human hostages. Their wealth, poverty, and lifespan are all subject to their karma’s measure. Those who harm beings in various ways, disturbing all living creatures, at the time of reckoning shall be transformed, experiencing renewed suffering as lowly beasts or low ghosts, enduring death through the Nine Nether Realms with no escape.  

If beings encourage knowledge, write and create this scripture, distribute it to the people, and recite it together, they will gain boundless blessings, be upright in human form through lifetimes, live long lives, and their blessings will extend to descendants.

Lady Qing said:  
“These Immortal Officials govern the Three Realms, the Nine Earths, the Five Sacred Mountains, the Four Pillars, and all beings, men and women, recording their good and evil deeds in blue and black registers, along with the sins and merits to be liberated, karmic retributions, examination dates, and those not yet liberated, all recorded in the Pure Emptiness format and reported to the Upper Palace.”

At that time, the Primordial Heavenly Venerable addressed the heavenly assembly, the true immortals of the Ten Directions, the wondrous practitioners, and the heavens’ sun, moon, and stars:  
“You true immortals, from now on, on the day of the Three Primordials, descend to the Pure Emptiness Cavern Yang Palace of the Northern Capital, gather and examine all the registers of birth, death, merits, demerits, sins, and evils among all beings on the nine lands of the earth. Record and verify the registers of life and death, writing each name in the blue and black registers. All human and ghostly transformations, all birds and fish shape changes, and their appointed times must be reported to the Upper Palace.”

At that moment, the heavenly gods, immortals, stars, the Five Sacred Mountains, the Four Directors, the Five Emperors, the Eight Extremes, true spirits, officials of the Three Realms, all immortals, each obeyed orders and faithfully carried them out. The heavenly assembly then said to the Heavenly Venerable:  
“When the Three Officials examine the registers within the myriad worlds and lands of the Ten Directions, all beings’ good and evil, men and women, birth and death, sins and merits, recorded in blue and black registers, with calculations of years and months according to the severity of evil and distinctions of events: those destined to live are recorded in the Left Palace; those destined to ascend as immortals in the Central Palace; those destined to die in the Right Palace. The smallest details of merits, demerits, birth, death, years, months, and days must be without error.  

If faithful men and women have many karmic obstacles and suffer misfortune, they should write and distribute this scripture among beings, recite it themselves, offer incense, flowers, and various offerings to gain boundless blessings. All calamities will heal, karmic obstacles vanish, lifespans lengthen, blessings extend to life and death, and dragon spirits all bear witness. You beings must trust my words, act according to good Dharma, and repent.”

Within the myriad worlds and lands of the Ten Directions, all faithful men and women, from beginningless time until today, may have committed sins such as employing unorthodox persons, speaking vain and false words, greedily taking for themselves without satisfaction, hoarding wealth and treasures, enticing the good to evil deeds, wishing harm to benevolent people, destroying and scattering sacred teachings and scriptures, killing all beings for pleasure, shooting wild beasts and birds, burning mountains and hunting, killing all sentient beings, using gold and silver treasures as eating vessels without shame, indulging in greed and desire, burning sacred Daoist altars, temples, statues, and scriptures, polluting food and drink, craving impure flavors, eating pungent spices that defile the Mysterious Primordial Immortals, wantonly destroying scriptures and laws, gathering crowds to kill living beings, plotting against kind and benevolent kin, betraying masters, plotting against the land, slandering the Great Dao and sacred scriptures, trading coarse goods for fine, destroying the images of the Most High Dao Lords and Jade Maidens, recklessly pointing at stars and falsely predicting fortunes, burning all beings’ granaries and homes, cutting down sacred altars, trees, flowers, and gardens, associating with evil friends and slandering the good, disparaging sacred Daoist scriptures, misunderstanding mysteries, misinterpreting scriptures, deviating from the sacred heart, practicing barbarian illusions, slandering the Great Vehicle, indulging in worldly pleasures, mocking the Three Treasures, praising the world but contradicting in heart and mouth, falsely judging good and evil, lacking filial piety, revealing immortal secrets, attacking good people without cause, relying on power to deceive commoners, oppressing the poor and weak, fabricating scriptures, slandering the Mysterious Primordial Sacred Dao, forging false books, slandering the Mysterious Celestial Truth, teaching fools to commit various evils, being arrogant and disdainful of masters and fellow beings, taking private revenge under the guise of law, abandoning kin without cause, causing miscarriages, violating clan and kinship, poisoning waters to kill fish and insects, causing fights and grudges without cause, gathering crowds to stir up demons, sending false letters to slander the Three Caverns’ Great Vehicle truth, forging scriptures, disparaging the sacred Dao, practicing sorcery to deceive beings, disturbing the good to commit evil, improperly taking and rejecting, belittling the old and ugly, oppressing the poor and sick, calling falsehood truth and evil righteousness, bullying all beings, allying with evil to harm the good, envying the superior to bring down the wise.  

I now reveal these sins to you beings, as numerous as dust and sand, spoken through endless kalpas, beyond reckoning. To eradicate these sins, you must reverently recite this scripture, offer incense and flowers, make various offerings, and all calamities will vanish, evils cease, and blessings multiply. The Three Officials, Five Emperors, Three Realms, Four Directors, and all Immortal Officials will examine without error. You Dao practitioners and those yet to attain the Dao will see all good and evil beings, their birth, death, karmic roots, merits, and demerits recorded in the Three Heavens and reported to the Five Emperors.  

On the day of the Three Primordials, the Infinite Heavenly Venerable, the Ten Directions’ Great Saints, the Thirty-Two Heavenly Lords, the Flying Heavenly Kings, the Supreme Jade Void True Jade Emperor, the Infinite Great Dao Lords, the Five Elders, the Eastern Splendor, Southern Pole, Western Spirit, Northern Truth, and all flying heavenly immortals, true immortals, jade youths and maidens, the Lords of Longevity and Fate, the Registers, the Executioners, the heavens’ sun, moon, and stars, and all true beings shall all be present.  

If within the Three Realms and lands of the Ten Directions there are faithful men and women who follow the Three Primordials’ method of repentance, perform the Seven Saints’ rites of life extension, burn fragrant incense, banners, flowers, and precious canopies, make various pure offerings to the heavens, and recite this scripture, they shall gain boundless blessings. If faithful men and women read and recite this scripture, they shall receive the Three Officials’ elevation of goodness, the Fate Office’s life extension, their names removed from the Blue Register of the Capital, and the following praise shall be spoken:

“Supreme Unity’s wondrous Dao, illustrious and mighty Dharma King.  
Supporting Heaven and Earth, generating Yin and Yang.  
The Dragon Han’s destined cycle, the Five Greats’ fragrant legacy.  
Red brilliance manifests, the Nine Elders bestow auspiciousness.  
The Supreme Emperor’s final kalpa, divine treasures radiate light.  
Compassion nurtures all things, rescuing existence and extinction.  
The Nine Nether Realms open liberation, the Five Pains all pacified.  
All beings rely on this, enjoying boundless blessings.”  

At that moment, the Dao Lord bowed and said:  
“I have heard that the Ultimate Dao Jade Emperor constantly proclaims the true Dharma, reveals it to all ranks, opens the great compassion transformation, bestows mercy on all beings, so that birth and death are both liberated, the hidden and manifest are both saved. Let the Dharma’s sound flow and spread, broadly aiding the heavens, through countless kalpas and causes, never to cease. The Supreme Unity’s wondrous Dao blesses the Ten Directions; birth and death are graced, existence and extinction all supported.”

The Heavenly Venerable said:  
“All faithful men and women, from beginningless time, with primordial qi continuously flowing, various forms arising, good and evil, blessings and calamities all stem from the root—not Heaven, not Earth, nor man—but from the mind itself. The mind is spirit. The form is not truly mine, the name not truly mine; what I give birth to comes from emptiness and nature, condensed qi forming the body. Therefore, I receive form, but the form is not truly mine. It is lent as form, shown as appearance. Those who attain the Dao no longer have form.  

All beings suffer afflictions because they have bodies. With bodies come a hundred evils; birth and death follow form. If one can align the mind with the truth, the Dao is unified. When body and spirit are both complete, one becomes a true person, returning to formlessness and attaining the Dao. No more afflictions arise; one never dies; the form does not turn to ashes; one’s whole life returns to its origin.  

All beings whose bodies commit a hundred evils must endure myriad sufferings and cannot yet return to life. These good and evil bodies each have their causes and effects; how could the dark sages be blamed? In the limitless heavens and worlds, all you Dao adherents must copy this scripture and distribute it among beings. Its merits are inconceivable: it resolves heavenly calamities and aids the long night below. The blessings of copying support life after life; the merits of reciting bring endless wealth and honor.”

At that moment, the heavenly assembly, the Three Primordials, Nine Offices, Five Emperors, Four Directors, and all true beings bowed and praised. From now on, if within the Ten Directions’ worlds and myriad lands there are floods, droughts, wars, and disasters causing people to suffer and die, then at the northern gate of the land, or at a pure place, or within an ancient altar or pure chamber, establish a Daoist altar, hang banners and images, perform great rituals under the five stars and the Twenty-Eight Constellations, and the Three Primordials’ Immortal Officials will cause the winds and rains to be timely, wars and disasters to cease, rulers to be wise, the world peaceful, and people prosperous.  

If any beings’ families suffer illness, decline, curses, invasions, evil spirits, epidemics, madness, or disasters from qi or ill stars, they should strictly maintain their homes, set up images and burn incense, recite this scripture, and all calamities will heal. Life after life, they will gain boundless blessings, and we heavenly beings will always protect them. Wherever faithful men and women recite this scripture and set up the Mysterious Celestial House, no disaster will remain unresolved, no calamity unremoved, wishes fulfilled, and all blessings attained. You beings must follow this teaching and order.”

At that moment, the true beings bowed and practiced, chanting this hymn:

“Supreme Unity Dharma King, the unacting teacher.  
Containing Yin, emitting Yang, parents of Heaven and Earth.  
Ninety-nine transformations give birth, ancestors of all things.  
Ocean of wisdom, pure and deep; vast source of Dharma.  
Mighty over all heavens, connecting the Three Realms.  
Ranks gather to bear grace, all creatures rely.  
Power endless, existence and extinction all peaceful.  
Bathed in mysterious power, transcending all hindrances.”

## Scroll Three

Lady Qing of the Most Profound Dao said:  
The Third Origin’s three ranks of Water Officials embody the qi of the Cavern Origin, Wind, and Marsh, the essence of morning vastness. The Three Officials of the Third Origin are: one, the Palace of Yang Valley Cavern Source; two, the Palace of Azure Splendor; three, the Palace of Cold Night. They govern the Nine Rivers’ Water Emperors, the Twelve Stream Maidens, the Three Rivers, the Four Seas’ Water Palaces, the rivers’ sources within Dongting, and the aquatic clans of fish, dragons, flood spirits, and myriad water beasts and scaled creatures dwelling in moisture. They also govern all faithful men and women’s birth and death registers, year, month, and limits within the myriad worlds and lands of the Ten Directions. Their officials number nine hundred million.  

They also govern the left, right, and central three courts of the Third Origin. The left is called Clear Source, the right Cold Night, the central Clear Spirit. These three courts total forty-two departments, governing human good and evil, birth and death, karmic retributions, and registers of limits. All are devout and respectful.

The right forty-two departments are established by Lady Qing of the Most Profound Dao, belonging to the Yang Valley Cavern Source’s left, right, and central three courts. They are the Wind Blade’s examination, governing the Nine Rivers, Three Rivers, Four Seas’ Water Palaces, the accumulation of night’s dead souls, exiled duties, kalpa years, and myriad ghosts and spirits. They record all names of those to die, all merits and demerits of good and evil men and women within the Ten Directions’ worlds and myriad lands, down to the myriad water spirits, dragons, flood spirits, and the disasters of water in streams and valleys. At the great assemblies of liberation and kalpa, the blue and black registers record the birth, death, sin, merit, and karmic weight for each according to their deeds.  

Within the palaces, each stretches fifty million li, filled with the qi of wind, marsh, and adamantine essence. They govern all water sources, rivers, lakes, and water emperors, the affairs of dark waves, long night’s dead souls, ghosts and spirits, and all good and evil men and women’s records of merits, sins, karmic retributions, and years of punishment, as well as the numbers of souls serving sentences, fish, dragons, and flood spirits. All await the Three Officials’ examination day, the Five Emperors’ assembly night, the day of the Jiazi Gengshen cycle, or the three meetings and five twelfths days, when the Nine Nether Realms’ palaces open to examine the souls of the long night, liberate spirits whose karma is fulfilled, and distinguish the paths of humans and ghosts. These myriad creatures receive life according to blessings and punishment according to karma.  

Thus, in great and small kalpas, the blue and black registers record the Three Heavens’ merits, demerits, sins, and karmic retributions, birth and death, cause and effect. Those destined to live are recorded in the Left Palace; those destined to ascend as immortals in the Central Palace; those destined to die in the Right Palace. The myriad water spirits’ affairs and the three ranks’ succession of birth, death, sin, merit, karmic weight, and examination of years and limits are all recorded according to deeds.  

Moreover, within the Ten Directions’ worlds and myriad lands, if there are virtuous scholars and all beings who repent from the vast kalpas past, who have ever harbored anger toward fellow disciples, falsely accused the good, held poison in their hearts, failed to release and save the dead, gained wealth and forgot masters’ grace, failed to repent on heavenly fasting days, slandered masters without reason, mocked those who revere the Mysterious Primordial Dao, encouraged evil deeds, forbade good thoughts, rejoiced in others’ faults, wished discord, turned away from the sacred Dao and the heavens and stars, polluted the Five Sacred Mountains and Nine Rivers, deprived the good of their desires, greedily sought worldly treasures, spoke falsehoods to escape beings, claimed others’ merits as their own, caused beings harm, hunted birds and beasts, frightened the poor and sick, disrespected officials, spoke improperly of right and wrong, falsely predicted national decline, lacked wisdom, clung to minor laws, slandered the Great Dao and sacred texts, indulged in unrestrained wandering, sought high rank without humility, set traps to kill birds and beasts, ruined others’ homes, deprived travelers of clothing, seized others’ wealth, worshipped ghosts after receiving the Dao, exposed their bodies before the Three Treasures, cursed wind and rain, disrespected the Three Lights, abused power to borrow and not return, harmed things for fame, gluttonous and unrestrained, arrogant toward the Mysterious Celestial, disrespected Heavenly Lords, insulted elders and rulers, encouraged unfilial behavior, trusted foreign illusions, deceived gods and men, hoarded food without charity, stole and destroyed sacred texts, adorned themselves excessively, wore unclean clothes on high seats, defiled masters’ halls, failed to comfort masters and friends, abandoned scriptures, disrespected laws, favored the rich, neglected the poor, failed to care for sick masters, neglected the sick, failed to burn incense at Daoist gates, laughed and joked in immortal halls, failed to perform merit transfers on fasting days, sought wealth without pity for poor and old, blamed Dao and masters for family misfortunes, accepted offerings without shame, violated transmission agreements, failed to thank the Five Emperors and Three Officials on the Three Primordials’ day, failed to cultivate good thoughts on the ten auspicious days—  

I now reveal these sins to you beings, as numerous as dust and sand, spoken through endless kalpas, beyond reckoning. To eradicate these sins, you must reverently recite this scripture, offer incense and flowers, make various offerings, and all calamities will vanish, evils cease, and blessings multiply. The Three Officials, Five Emperors, Three Realms, Four Directors, and all Immortal Officials will examine without error. You Dao practitioners and those yet to attain the Dao will see all good and evil beings, their birth, death, karmic roots, merits, and demerits recorded in the Three Heavens and reported to the Five Emperors.  

On the day of the Three Primordials, the Infinite Heavenly Venerable, the Ten Directions’ Great Saints, the Thirty-Two Heavenly Lords, the Flying Heavenly Kings, the Supreme Jade Void True Jade Emperor, the Infinite Great Dao Lords, the Five Elders, the Eastern Splendor, Southern Pole, Western Spirit, Northern Truth, and all flying heavenly immortals, true immortals, jade youths and maidens, the Lords of Longevity and Fate, the Registers, the Executioners, the heavens’ sun, moon, and stars, and all true beings shall all be present.  

If within the Three Realms and lands of the Ten Directions there are faithful men and women who follow the Three Primordials’ method of repentance, perform the Seven Saints’ rites of life extension, burn fragrant incense, banners, flowers, and precious canopies, make various pure offerings to the heavens, and recite this scripture, they shall gain boundless blessings. If faithful men and women read and recite this scripture, they shall receive the Three Officials’ elevation of goodness, the Fate Office’s life extension, their names removed from the Blue Register of the Capital, and the following praise shall be spoken:
