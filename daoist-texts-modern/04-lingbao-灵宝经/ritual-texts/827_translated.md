## The Most High Profound Numinous Treasure Scripture of Destiny, Cause, and Condition Illuminated

At that time, the Most High Dao Lord feasted upon the Radiant Great Rosy Clouds above, and addressed the assembled True Ones, saying:

“The great virtue of Heaven and Earth is called the Primordial Dao; the treasured virtue of Heaven and Earth is called the Initial Dao; the connecting virtue of Heaven and Earth is called the Human Dao. These three Dao combine their virtues, their precious transformations hidden and preserved—the origin of emptiness and non-being, the sovereign transformation before all else.

Nüwa with her serpent body, Fuxi with his scaled form, yin and yang mingled in chaos, creation yet undivided. The Three Sages meditated together; the Five Emperors began the origin; the Dao was fulfilled and virtue accomplished; fortune and misfortune divided. Radiant transformation spread and flowed, gradually giving rise to causes and conditions, the tokens of good and evil, change and movement already established.

In the Great Ancient times, simplicity and purity prevailed; the teaching of the wind was easy to follow. In the Middle Ages, falseness grew, harm and calamity flooded the heavens; outward trust did not move; the root of the Dao was violated.

The virtue of Yu governed with clarity, his merit in water control was praised; he was raised by Shun, managed the labor of mountains and rivers, opened and connected the Four Rivers, saved and delivered myriad people. Born to receive abdication and succession, he passed away governing Zhong Mountain.

The Lord of the Moon Palace, the illustrious Water Controller, was granted by Heaven the treasured talisman; those who pass through drowning are made whole. The methods of the Three Treasures ascend and transform here—excellent, excellent! Thus the Dao is proclaimed.”

The Dao Lord said: “My Dao is lofty and subtle, hidden and manifest, easy to understand. It transforms according to goodness, descending to bestow precious writings. In later generations, evil will multiply, trust in words will be scarce; people will stagnate and be deeply mistaken, causing pain and suffering beyond words. I constantly reflect on this: good and evil must be distinguished; if good virtue is not cultivated, one will recklessly incur guilt and resentment.

You must diligently cultivate purity, forever seek liberation, cross over disasters, long preserve joy, receive harmonious teaching and transformation, and great peace may be spoken of.”

The Dao Lord said: “I worry for the future, for birth and death, sin and blessing, tangled in destiny. Accumulating goodness brings celebration; blessings naturally follow. The essence of the Dao, those who obtain it also transcend as immortals.”

Yin Sheng bowed his head and said: “Excellent, excellent! Now I receive the precepts, to proclaim and spread without partiality. Yao preserved Shun and Yu; what destiny, what cause and condition, born with sage knowledge, enjoying long blessings, laboring in water control, their merits seen in the world. What cause have I, then, to be confused and withered? Why suffer distress, sorrow without joy? What deep virtue is there to be a celestial being? What hidden virtue can fix flight to immortality, avoiding the eight calamities, protecting and crossing over descendants? Now I bow and weep, begging to know the causes and conditions.”

The Dao Lord said: “Excellent, excellent. Your questions are most fitting. The precepts of future generations you may fully hear. I warn concerning destiny, cause, and condition, birth and death, sin and blessing, all clearly illuminated. I only wish that later generations clearly accept teaching and transformation. The Heavenly Dao is impartial, only favoring the good. Be cautious, be cautious. Hear my words.”

The Dao Lord said: “The supreme great Dao of the Three Realms divine-transforms all things, striving to save all beings, universally aiding sentient life, enabling crossing over the world of Five Turbidities—can such merit be spoken of? Now the Five Poisons approach; drive out the world’s rebellion and evil; distinguish the worthy and good. I fear you will fall into evil, be reborn among beasts—this brings sorrow and pain. What sorrow to bear?”

The Dao Lord said: “At that time, lords and ministers fight each other; no good or evil, no great or small, no noble or humble, no teacher or friend. All suffer violent calamity; bodies die and names vanish, not one remains. Those born without cultivating virtue encounter these disasters. Harboring jealousy within, no kindness or compassion, slandering one another, confused and chaotic—such people fall into hells and hungry ghosts. Taking momentary glory, not diligently cultivating blessing, guarding against future births in foul evil, oppressed and insulted by others, slaughtered and tormented cruelly—can this be spoken of?”

Yin Sheng asked: “When future generations suffer kalpa calamities, by what methods are they taught? Truly pitying all beings, all may receive good retribution, because of great merit, born into good causes, dying free from the Three Paths and Five Pains, long ascending to halls of blessing, naturally clothed and fed—this can be called excellent, excellent indeed.”

Yin Sheng said: “According to the Sage Lord’s words, please explain what causes and conditions lead a person to be born noble among immortals, worthy and joyful. Again, what causes lead to birth among ordinary mortals? What causes lead to birth among earth and mountain realms, with pain and suffering beyond words? What causes lead to birth among slaves and servants, hated by people, full of distress and unhappiness? What causes lead to birth among virtuous and chaste good people, with fragrant body and mouth, honored by others? What causes lead to birth among coarse and ugly people, constantly despised and insulted, acting unkindly? What causes lead to birth among the privileged and leisurely, honored by people, always receiving offerings, wishes fulfilled? For such conduct, I only wish you to reveal the source of awakening and liberation, to skillfully save and cross over, long enjoy precious blessings, such great peace, free from bitter heat.”

The Dao Lord said: “Hear carefully my precepts, ponder my earnest words. Now I explain clearly for you the essential subtlety. The responses of virtue are only six matters:

One, a compassionate heart that does not kill living beings, nurturing and sustaining all things, universally saving and delivering, enabling safety.  
Two, loving and cherishing the worthy, not harboring theft in the heart, only desiring to give and relieve the poor.  
Three, holding the mind pure and chaste, single-minded in diligence, abandoning distant sights and sounds, not violating precepts.  
Four, sincere and earnest, not deceitful or false, guarding speech and avoiding faults, not greedy or impure.  
Five, not drunken or intoxicated, keeping clear and pure.  
Six, holding the mind in reverence and awe, personally believing in the Dao.

Practicing these six matters, one is born above heavenly beings, leisurely flying immortals, clothed and fed, honored by others, becoming teacher and friend.

At that time the blessing is sung by the Dao:

> Not killing grants long life, free from pain and constant suffering.  
> All receive heavenly rank, body safe and supported.  
> Not stealing keeps one pure and noble, wealth naturally gathers.  
> Seven treasures build the palace, joy and peace for all.  
> Not lusting means no chaos, body always clean and pure.  
> Born upright and proper, virtue shines bright and clear.  
> Not deceiving, breath fragrant, words always loyal and true.  
> Speaking the Primordial Dao, discourse brings success.  
> Not even a drop of wine passes the lips, no error or fault.  
> Always wishing to see splendid fruits, served by heavenly beings.  
> At life’s end ascending to heaven, twenty-five spirits welcome.  
> Ten thousand blessings descend naturally, light forever radiant.

The Dao Lord said: “Next, six matters lead to birth among humans. What are these six?

One, giving and saving the poor, heart constantly mindful of suffering and scarcity.  
Two, holding precepts diligently, not committing the ten evils.  
Three, enduring insult and bearing with patience, not speaking falsely.  
Four, exhorting and transforming the foolish and stubborn, urging reverence and caution.  
Five, single-heartedly serving the dharma, full of compassion and loyalty.  
Six, loving life and hating killing, not doing wrongful deeds.

Practicing these six matters, one is born among humans, wealth and honor often attained, wishes fulfilled, generosity widespread, future generations born human kings, revered by ten thousand nations.

Virtue and conduct thus, the Dao sings:

> Giving brings great blessing, wealth naturally comes.  
> Born always noble, passing on joy through generations.  
> Holding precepts with respect, receiving the nine honors.  
> Diligent and reverent, avoiding evil, body preserved long.  
> Patient and humble, anger not shown in speech.  
> Insults endured without reply, blessings and longevity natural.  
> Diligent and not lax, mindful of Dao always true.  
> Actions aligned with Dao, at death becoming heavenly beings.  
> Mind true, never retreating, loyal and truthful words.  
> Offering to all virtues, born without hardship.  
> Able to do these six good deeds, born human again.  
> Face upright and proper, naturally noble in body.”

The Dao Lord said: “There are also seven ugly evils, causing death in hell, tested for countless kalpas without end. What are the seven uglies?

One, unfaithful and unfilial, insulting the Dao’s honor, dying young or maimed, falling into hell, tested for tens of thousands of years.  
Two, falsely invoking ghosts and spirits, cursing the good, body afflicted with calamity and trial, suffering unbearable pain.  
Three, destroying shrines, disrespecting the Three Honored Ones, body heavily punished, torment unbearable.  
Four, full of doubt and little faith, denying ghosts and spirits, perverting the Dao, defiling the Three Luminaries, body afflicted with all diseases, constantly imprisoned in heavenly jail, consorting with all evils, children born crippled, dying young in hell, suffering for ten thousand years.  
Five, kinship utterly broken, hearts invading and harming each other, slandering ghosts and spirits, filthy and arrogant, cruelly disbelieving the truth, thus dying prematurely, never reaching allotted lifespan, falling into hell, suffering countless pains.  
Six, rebellious and disobedient to law, shackled and imprisoned by father and lord, disrespecting elders, speaking evil first, body stripped and flayed, dying young without remedy, future generations harmed by beasts, calamity spreading to descendants.  
Seven, afflicted with jaundice and leprosy, jealous and violent, evil never leaving the body, encountering disaster and calamity, dying in hell, falling into boiling cauldrons for countless kalpas.

Such evil deeds, the Dao sings:

> Stingy and greedy, not giving, selfishly stealing, not supporting parents.  
> Hoarding wealth, greedy and arrogant, not helping the old and poor.  
> Wife, children, and servants not clothed or fed, watching hunger and cold.  
> Sitting upright guarding possessions, dying as starving ghosts.  
> Body never full, suffering sores and ulcers.  
> Begging east and west, family all destroyed.  
> Crafting lies and slander, life and death stripped and torn.  
> Molten copper poured in mouth, tongue pulled halfway out.  
> Mouth forced to swallow, intestines rotten.  
> In life not thinking good, in death suffering burning pain.  
> Ulcers and sores lightly tormenting, tested for tens of thousands of years.  
> After punishment, reborn lowly, evil delighting in killing and stealing.  
> Body maimed entering hell, suffering disaster for countless kalpas.”

The Dao Lord said: “There are also five evils, born among beasts. One, violating precepts by stealing, refusing to repay debts. Two, lusting after kin, disrespecting Heaven and Earth. Three, wrongfully harming the innocent, lightly swearing without regard for law. Four, seeing good but disliking it, hearing evil and following it, body severely tested, calamity spreading to descendants. Five, deceiving superiors and cheating inferiors, disloyal to lords, abusing power, wronging loyal and good, delighting in slaughter, skinning cattle and sheep, pain and poison unbearable, heart like wolves and jackals.

All these five acts cause death in the Eastern Mountains, rebirth among beasts, suffering from the Five Poisons, wise and foolish alike. Such is the retribution, the Dao sings:

> Always stealing in heart, refusing to repay debts.  
> Loving to kill and hunt, unlawfully making worldly ties.  
> Acting without sincerity, quick to anger over small words.  
> Sinful without awareness, liking evil and disbelieving truth.  
> Future birth among beasts, oxen, sheep, donkeys, and horses.  
> Stinking and foul, always burdened, tested for ten thousand kalpas.  
> Internal lust violating kin, struck down by thunder and lightning.  
> Death in hell, hanging upside down in fire.  
> Mocking and slandering true Dao, future birth full of suffering.  
> Molten copper poured in mouth, always hungry and cold.”

The Dao Lord said: “There are also five virtues, born noble and honored, respected by all, practiced throughout the world, the heart of people’s return. What are the five virtues?

One, giving without stinginess, grace flowing everywhere, universally aiding the poor and urgent, merit spreading in all directions.  
Two, offering to the Supreme Dao, reverently serving the Three Treasures.  
Three, pure thoughts, fasting and precepts, calm, gentle, and humble to others.  
Four, enduring insults without complaint, not seeking argument, the Dao thinking of itself, named ascending immortals.  
Five, loving to refine Dao energy, clearly understanding celestial patterns, entrusting the heart to the Dao, the Dao always present, penetrating the Nine Palaces, able to become earth immortals. The worldly ignorant call this impossible; here is the proof.

The Dao sings:

> Giving always without stinginess, universally aiding and calming all.  
> Receiving purity and honor in body, the world sees one ascend immortal.  
> Offering and loving Dao and virtue, fasting and precepts reveal true numinosity.  
> Quiet thought never lax, seven ancestors ascend heaven.  
> Enduring insult without anger, born upright and proper.  
> Learning and loving Dao and virtue, becoming honored among humans.  
> Acting with gentleness, humble and lowly to others.  
> Saving urgent and dangerous, able to extend life long.  
> Reverently serving the Numinous Treasure precepts, clearly refining the Nine Palaces Dao.  
> Entrusting heart and trusting emptiness, lifespan as long as Heaven’s age.”

The Dao Lord said: “There are also five evils, always born lowly, as slaves and servants. What are the five evils?

One, arrogance and pride, disrespecting parents.  
Two, stubbornness and rebellion, heart not reverent.  
Three, licentiousness and disorder, not honoring the Three Treasures.  
Four, self-centeredness, theft on the body.  
Five, owing debts and fleeing, refusing to repay.

These five acts cause constant birth among lowly people, as slaves and servants, beaten and humiliated, always hungry and cold, life insufficient.

The Dao sings:

> Truly there are fools, arrogant to parents.  
> No reverence or respect, future birth lowly.  
> Seeing treasures without respect, offending elders.  
> Acting without kindness or filial piety, future birth as slaves.  
> Clothing and food reliant on others, beaten day and night.  
> Born always suffering, death without escape.  
> Licentious and lustful, utterly disbelieving ghosts and spirits.  
> Future birth suffering hunger and cold, deeds meeting hardship.  
> Owing debts, cursing ancestors, poor and miserable.  
> Future birth as cattle and sheep, oppressed by people.”

The Dao Lord said: “There are also five good virtues, always seeing good causes, born among humans, breath fragrant and pure, body and mind always peaceful, honored and respected by others. What are the five virtues?

One, utmost sincerity loving truth, born not deceiving others.  
Two, reciting scriptures and practicing Dao, single-minded without division.  
Three, diligent fasting and precepts, delighting in the immortal Dao.  
Four, teaching others to do good, not doing wrong or evil.  
Five, earnest and compassionate, universally aiding urgent needs, much faith without doubt.

These five good virtues all lead to birth among noble people, breath fragrant and pure, not falsely offending, mind always peaceful, honored and revered, never poor in life, accumulating merit over time, gradually seeing heavenly immortals.

The good retribution is thus, the Dao sings:

> Firm faith loving the Dao, compassion always tender.  
> Simple meals, body clean, after transformation ascending heavenly mysteries.  
> Reverently serving the Three Treasures, not proud to parents.  
> Utmost sincerity without deceit, this is loyal and filial conduct.  
> Guarding speech, not lying, acting with care toward all.  
> Exhorting others to avoid sin, mindful of dharma without violation.  
> Helping the poor and rescuing the urgent, merit greatly weighty.  
> Increasing lifespan and joy, life full of peace and happiness.  
> Making friends practicing righteousness, respecting each other like parents.  
> Closing off evil, promoting good virtue, filial piety moves the spirits.”

The Dao Lord said: “There are also six misfortunes, acting without Dao, filthy and fallen in body, frame low and withered, always encountering hunger and cold. What are the six evils?

One, scheming without sincerity.  
Two, utterly disbelieving true Dao, hearing dharma and wishing to destroy it, never loving goodness, always slandered.  
Three, not mindful of good precepts, mocking true persons.  
Four, defiling and insulting elders, many evil deeds.  
Five, poisonous heart, cruel and rebellious, slandering good people.  
Six, mind always thinking evil, without reason angry, born lowly, always hungry and cold, given to others as servants, day and night without rest, body foul and ugly, never joyful.

The Dao sings:

> Deceitful and fond of lies, never truly sincere.  
> Heart and mouth opposing, always suffering disgrace.  
> Rebellious and slandering, dying and falling into hell.  
> Molten copper poured in mouth, bitter poison long-lasting.  
> Drunken and fond of curses, not believing in ghosts or spirits.  
> Iron hook fastened to tongue, pain beyond words.  
> Escaping to be born human, breath always foul.  
> Hated by people, disasters afflicting.  
> Evil thoughts always meeting, wherever going punished.  
> Unjustly imprisoned, suffering all poisons.  
> Death again in hell, next birth as beast.  
> Wandering among Five Poisons, sorrowful and humiliated.”

The Dao Lord said: “There are also five virtues, born to good places, always abiding in Dao and dharma, respected by all, words obeyed, accumulating goodness to five hundred, later seeing immortal lords. Next born to be Daoists, eager learners opening understanding.

The highest wishes for the five virtues are to commune with the subtle mysteries.

One virtue is delighting in immortal truth, reverently serving the Three Treasures, chanting scriptures and turning the dharma wheel, roaming and returning through kalpas old, offering incense preserving emptiness, ascending and crossing over from suffering.  
Two virtue is the immortal sage’s roaming, merit protecting the body.  
Three virtue is wishing to be among humans, refining the Three Primes Dao.  
Four virtue is praising the Supreme Clarity, not eating yet self-satisfied.  
Five virtue is roaming the void, sins temporarily overturned.

The good retribution is thus, the Dao sings:

> Reverently serving the Three Virtues, proclaiming and urging good deeds.  
> Wishing to see immortals and sages, long attaining true personhood.  
> Wishing to nurture all the worthy, no difference from me and you.  
> Our hearts calm and free, diligently practicing the Dao with utmost sincerity.  
> Day and night studying, wisdom becoming heavenly beings.  
> Yin Sheng transforms the Western lands, universally spreading true Dao.  
> Earnestly loving immortal truth, accumulating thoughts without difference.  
> First wishing to ascend and roam the void, communing with the subtle mysteries.  
> Accumulating goodness without limit, giving grace without stinginess.  
> Merit moves immortal truth, naturally descending elixirs.”

The Dao Lord said: “Following the world’s ways, this method again issues from the Three Realms Dao. The highest method is Supreme Clarity, flying and transforming, contracting the Profound Truth. Next is the Boundless Kalpa, incarnating as Tathāgata, roots the same, transformations slightly different, later teaching the farthest barbarians.

The Ten Directions’ Central Kingdom is hard to transform; thus the West is completed. My Dao is that of Laozi, guiding Yin Sheng’s time, uttering five thousand words, refining the embryo for ten years, the circumnavigation three turns, gathering complete blessings. Only my Dao practices goodness; see and deeply heed this.”
