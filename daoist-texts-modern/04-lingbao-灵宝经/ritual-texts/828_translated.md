## The Most High Guide and Lead Three Luminaries Precious True Sublime Scripture

In the era of the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, within the Red Bright World, the Dan Spirit realm, in the Vermilion Phoenix City, inside the Palace of Radiant Mist, there stood the Hall of the Three Qi and Dan Blossoms. There, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy presided, accompanied by the great saints of the heavens, the supremely true honored spirits, the Five Elder Emperors, the Golden Palace’s later sages, the Three Pure Ones of the Primordial Limit, the Most High Sacred Exalted, the Eastern Flourishing Great Emperor, the Western Numinous Golden Mother, the Thirty-Two Heavenly Emperors, the Eighty-One Heavenly Lords, the Mysterious Harmonious Spirit Consort, the Great Bright Jade Maiden, and the countless host of the Unrestrained. Together they calibrated the Heavenly Origin, controlled the great floods, measured the kalpas of tribulation, and according to the registers of the Three Primes, delivered all beings.

Within the Three Realms and the Nine Hells, submerged beings of various sorts, all myriad spirits acclaimed peace and beheld the Dharma gate. The underworld was tranquil and serene; the eight shadows opened wide; accumulated ailments were dispelled; records of sin were erased; foreseeing the heavenly light, all were graced with great celebration. In the boundless worlds of the Ten Directions, under the authority of the Dao’s might and numinous power, in a flash, all came together in unison.

At that moment, from the farthest East and West extremes, suddenly a wondrous light shone upward into the vast space, entering the Dharma assembly. Nine colors radiated exquisitely, dazzling and brilliant, sparkling with fresh splendor, shining and flowing with fragrance, impossible to gaze upon steadily. Then appeared heavenly lords and emperors, perfected beings and immortals, jade maidens and jade youths, heavenly attendants and their retinues—all bearing round halos above their heads, lotus blossoms beneath their feet, filling the two directions, arriving simultaneously.

Upon entering the assembly, they bowed and saluted the Heavenly Worthy, burned incense and scattered blossoms, offered homage and courtly respect. When the rites were complete, each withdrew to their original place, seating themselves on the left and right sides according to rank. Then the Most True raised his banner of faith, the Divine King wielded his standard, heavenly music and ethereal songs intertwined, myriad sounds interweaving, shaking heaven and earth, joy beyond words.

Before the assembly ended, the Universal Virtue Sublime Practitioner rose from his seat, paced with calm elegance, and approached before the Dao. Bowing deeply, he addressed the Heavenly Worthy: “In this assembly, there are two groups from East and West, whose forms and spirits are outstanding, their appearances dignified, their movements composed, their wondrous light brilliant. What method of cultivation do they follow? Who is their teacher? By what cause and condition have they attained this rank? I beseech you to reveal and instruct, to teach what has not yet been heard.”

The Heavenly Worthy replied: “Universal Virtue Sublime Practitioner, you have attained the highest true rank, having passed through many kalpas, comprehending the hierarchy of saints and sages, the stages of true fruition, the inner and outer distinctions of high and low, shallow and deep practices, all thoroughly perceived without exception. The cultivation of the two groups is likewise fully known to you. Your question arises because within this assembly are some young saints and newly ascended immortals whose practice is not yet broad; seeing those gathered, they harbor silent doubts. You also wish to reveal their cultivation, to illuminate later learners, thus you ask, broadly opening the wondrous gate for future generations, creating great Dharma benefit. This heart of yours is vast and universal, beyond thought. Sit again and listen carefully; I shall explain for you.

The transformation of the Great Dao precedes all beginnings, neither existence nor nonexistence, supremely subtle and silent, beyond sound and sight, neither form nor emptiness, mysterious and profound, without end or beginning, ready to reveal and unfold, gradually manifesting creation. Within the vast void’s dark stillness, first the Dao qi divides, faintly showing form and sign; the clear and turbid differ: the clear and floating become Heaven, the turbid and dense become Earth. The two qi separate, one yin and one yang; the essence of yin and yang congeals into sun and moon. Yang reaches its extreme at nine, the sun contains nine rays; yin reaches its extreme at ten, the moon divides into ten hues. The moon moves swiftly and restlessly, the sun moves slowly and gently; the moon cuts and completes, the sun generates and transforms. The two images alternate, shining and illuminating the center; all things respond and connect, giving birth and transformation below.

Further, from the two images, qi condenses; sun and moon divide essence, dispersing into stars, fixed as rivers and mountains. The five stars and five dippers interweave in heaven, setting proper order and governing hidden and manifest. All things, great and small, are struck by this. Within the sun, moon, and stars, each has palaces and mansions, lords, ministers, and officials, overseeing duties and functions. Immortal ranks and divine officers, officials of sin and merit, each within their domain, none lacking in arrangement.

Among these officials, some are born with vigorous qi, some accumulate merit to be promoted, some follow their cultivation and learning, attesting to the rank they occupy. All are collectively called the Three Luminaries, responding to the Dao’s transformation. Each bears a natural jade character, the script of the Eight Assemblies, hidden within the Three Palaces, never transmitted to the world. Now I will bestow this upon you, to descend and transform all beings.

This is called the Guide and Lead of the Three Luminaries, commanding and governing true qi, following prescribed vows and oaths, cultivating according to the Dharma. After eighteen years, the功 (achievement) is complete and the Dao attained; qi and Dao unite, lifespan infinite. Those from the two directions who long cultivate this Dao,功 (merit) full and virtue complete, form and spirit ascend together, residing in the Three Luminaries’ palaces, belonging to the Three Luminaries’ retinue, their form and bearing radiant and brilliant, shining forth resplendently, distinct among the host of gods and immortals. If功 (merit) accumulates without ceasing, they advance according to rank, from Three Luminaries’ lower immortals to saintly positions, cultivating in accord with the Three Grottoes, their affairs mysteriously identical.

This Dharma existed before countless kalpas, at the dawn of the vast indistinct, transforming with the Jade Pure Sacred Teaching, together transforming all heavens. The Two Views and Three Vehicles are equally without distinction. Do not harbor doubt about the Great Dao.

Then the Heavenly Worthy commanded the chief scripture officers, the Guardian True Grand Historian, the Registrar of Vows, the mysterious upper officials, the Jade administrators of the Four Officers, and the chief officers and attendants to open the Morning Splendor Treasure Hall, respectfully present the Dan Scenery Jade Box, and produce the Three Luminaries’ Upper Chapter, the Eight Heavens’ Jade Characters, the Nine Transformations and Eight Assemblies, subtle and profound secret texts, according to the Four Extremes’ clear regulations, to instruct Universal Virtue Sublime Practitioner. The heavens in their seats, myriad saints arrayed in ceremony, the Three Realms and Four Offices all gaze upon this.

At this, Universal Virtue Sublime Practitioner faced north, knelt long, bowed his head and received the scripture. All beings of heaven and earth voiced in unison, acclaiming goodness. Then, using white jade as slips, inscribed in gold, the scripture was stored in the Yu Yi platform and the Jie Lin pavilion. Within four hundred years, it was transmitted to three persons.

After the scripture was fully received, the Heavenly Worthy said: “The two groups from East and West, the sun and moon immortals, guiding and commanding the Three Luminaries, have attained true rank, their spirit and form clear and bright, illuminating the assembly. To the many who observe, this is wondrous indeed, yet among all directions’ incarnations, all true immortals’ radiance, this is not especially unique. Do not generate doubt or division, lest you lose good功 (merit).”

Soon the Primordial Heavenly Worthy appeared, along with the multitude of humans and heavens. Each in their form emitted subtle wondrous light, illuminating the vast space, blending heaven and earth, with myriad colors and forms, endlessly transforming. Like the Seven Treasures Mountain shining with hundreds of thousands of suns, mingling with the sun and moon hosts without distinction.

The Heavenly Worthy said to Universal Virtue Sublime Practitioner: “The Great Dao’s profound功 (achievement) births and transforms all things. Each follows form and nature, with various depths. Laws are bestowed according to conditions, opening deliverance for all. Cultivation is practiced according to circumstance, with degrees of difference. Myriad transformations differ, yet all return to one Dao. The Dao itself is without two; returning to the One Origin, when one attunes to the Dao, one forgets even this One. Not bound by self or other, not tied to existence or nonexistence, serene and tranquil, beyond words and thought. Kalpas and tribulations end, but this Dao always remains. Dwelling in the wondrous gate is called attaining the Dao.”

Having spoken thus, the heavenly chariot was ordered to return to the Great Luo. The assembly of gods and immortals, heavenly spirits and most high sages, within and beyond the Three Realms, having fully comprehended the true meaning, bowed to the vast void, saluted, and withdrew.

This is called Flowing Essence, also called Nurturing Infant, also called Dharma Qi, also called Yang Jade, also called Cloud Splendor, also called Dao Immortal, also called Nine Transformations, also called Fixed Light.

All heavenly true immortals delight in practicing it. The Sun Lord, Moon Emperor, and starry officials constantly accord with it. The true constant Dao is universally admired.

Primordial qi emits heavenly flowing essence, humming and surging as nurturing infant, extending and guiding Dharma qi, commanding and governing Yang Jade, irrigating and refining Cloud Splendor, transforming and guiding Immortals, soaring through Nine Transformations, body born with wondrous hues, hands turning fixed light, leaping shadows in vast space, ascending and crossing the Three Realms, forever escaping birth and death, flying and ascending to the upper palace.

The Nine Blossoms contain the Nine Dao; the Eight Colors delight the Eight Directions. Radiant and splendid, revealing the true body, flowing essence returns to the Great Radiance. Below is the Abyssal Spring Palace; above is the land of no-where. The body extends and flies, suddenly all forms forgotten.

Plump flesh no longer ages; attuning to this is called Fixed Light. Forever feasting in the Great Bright Hall, this is the land of no night. Gathering traces, returning to the root, nine turns condense true constancy.

Taking the talisman, bowing to the true, guiding the body, swallowing qi, the two luminaries mix, the Three Luminaries unite. My body transcends, merging with light as one. When responding, returning to existence; when silent, entering non-being. Wandering freely in the vast void, hidden yet seen without limit. By this freedom, one is called the natural utmost true person, also named the Primordial Five Elder Numinous Treasure Thirty-Two Heavens Fixed Light Perfected One.

Constantly with the Ten Extremes Great Saints, Ten Splendid High Perfected Ones, Four Heavenly Emperors, Five Elder Emperors, attended by thousands of perfected ones and myriad gods, officials of the Three Realms, roaming and resting at the Grotto Yang’s palace, the Supreme View platform. There are the Imperial Ancestor Heaven, Harmonious Yang Heaven, Kong Ascending Heaven, and Soaring Crossing Heaven. Each of the Four Heavens has thirty-six countries; countries have lords, ministers, and lands; peoples, emperors, birds, and Kunlun; Jade Capital and Golden Palace; Mysterious Metropolis and Five Sacred Mountains; divine and immortal offices; great marshes and famous mountains; eight majestic divine beasts, flying, diving, roaming, resting; scales, fins, feathers; hills and forests stirring, transforming into Seven Treasures, illuminating the Four Directions.

The Dharma drum shakes the void; numinous sounds combine in harmony, singing the Most High Eight Assemblies’ chapters. There are beginners among the immortals, gaining premonitory vision and hearing, ascending registers and flying order, from order rotating the Dipper into the Leader, swallowing primordial essence, blending spirit and subtlety, hands turning the Six Perfections, feet stepping the Nine Blossoms, leaping the body through emptiness, merging with light, forever ascending the wondrous Dao, eternally abiding thereafter.

Heavenly writings and jade scripts are carved in jade characters within these platforms, called the Primordial Eight Heavens’ Talisman Mandates.

Those who guide and lead revere swallowing the elixir, transforming substance and changing form, refining the awaiting body, entering the formless Dao. When cultivating, separate chambers preserve the Dao, pure fasting and dustless, with the six yang months, six qi harmonizing, heavenly true response. Sometimes atop the spiritual hills and immortal mountains, concentrating spirit and mind, one can immediately ascend and communicate. Among common folk, such thorough response is difficult.
