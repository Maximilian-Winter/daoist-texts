## Scripture of the Twenty-Four Births of the Numinous Treasure of the Cavern Mystery

The Three Divisions and Eight Scenes reveal the natural numinous truths—great transformations foretell the appointed times. The Radiant Red opens the light; the three scenes shine brilliantly; the Five Kalpas begin to divide. The Primordial Heavenly Worthy, together with the Great Saints of the Ten Directions, the Most True Worthy Spirits, the Limitless Most High Dao Sovereign, the Flying Celestial Beings, the Mysterious Harmonious Jade Maiden, and the countless hosts without restraint, all sit together at the Cypress Pavilion on the Southern Floating Cavern Yang Upper Hall at Bailingshe. They engage in clear discourse, serene and unbound, speaking simply and naturally. Their numinous voices blend in perfect harmony, singing wondrously the bright truth. The heavens rejoice, the sun and moon pause their wheels, the stars silently pass by, the Nine Heavens circle the passes, rivers and seas lie still, mountains swallow their mists, dragons and qilin leap forth, and humans and spirits alike exult.

At that time, the Most High Limitless Dao Sovereign bowed his head in reverence and salutation, then addressed the Heavenly Worthy: “Today, attending the seat, the Great Desert opens the dusk; the Limitless World reveals all clearly. The dharma’s sound vibrates afar, its grace spreads to the Ten Directions. Passing through the great cause, kalpa after kalpa births transform; the sacred seats revolve, each taking their place in the Perfect Truth. Now is the time to nurture and govern, to dissect the Six Heavens, examine the kalpa’s principle and movement, measure the myriad peoples, calculate the long night, inspect the Three Officials, bear heavy labors and duties, joys and sorrows beyond words. I dare to attach myself to the numinous wind, to sound forth from my heart. Previously, together with the Primordial Heavenly King, we were in the long mulberry green forest garden, hearing the Heavenly Worthy universally proclaim to the Great Saints and Worthy Spirits: ‘The Cavern Mystery’s celestial numinous treasure jade secrets contain three divisions and eight scenes, twenty-four diagrams. Above correspond to the twenty-four truths; the middle division holds the twenty-four energies; below guards the twenty-four births. The numinous chapters shine brilliantly, wondrous beyond the void and cavern. Those who behold them, the Nine Heavens record their names in golden slips; life and death are transformed to immortality. The coming era hastens; three and five bring injury and loss; myriad beings suffer short lives, dragged through eight hardships; wind knives pain the body; the five sufferings afflict the infant; sinking into the long night, unseen by the three lights, unknowingly facing fate, living and dying at random—this wounds the heart, pains both humans and spirits. Now the great compassionate Dao practice, its favor widely flourishing, I humbly beseech the Heavenly Worthy to have pity and compassion, to directly rely on the profound methods, to teach what has not been heard, to enable those who have not seen to see, those not yet perfected to perfect, blessings to flow to all, to receive grace through countless kalpas. If thus instructed and taught, one must immediately take up the divine drum and wind, spreading waves far and wide, cleansing the Three Realms, solemnly inspecting all demons, rectifying the Six Heavens, beheading the hordes of evil, securing the nation and nurturing the people, bringing yin and yang to peaceful rest, bright transformation fully arising, the Dao flowing through the great void.’”

Then the Heavenly Worthy raised his face with a smile. From his mouth issued forth energies of blue, yellow, and red, their light penetrating and illuminating all within and beyond the Ten Directions—no shadow, no concealment—dawn of a kalpa’s brightness. Golden scripts, purple characters, jade texts, and cinnabar seals shimmered brilliantly within the three energies. The three and eight scene spirits, the twenty-four truths, each came forth with a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, hovering above the mysterious void, assisting and guarding the numinous writings. The heavens, sun, and moon scattered splendid radiance; myriad crossings and irrigations; flying fragrances entwined eightfold; myriad saints praised and celebrated; all at once paying homage to the truth.

The Heavenly Worthy declared: “Now is the birth of all things, joy beyond comparison, heart poured forth, feelings without concealment. One must follow the profound methods, the seven treasures to pacify the spirit, a golden altar, to bestow upon the child the path of the true spirits. The Dao’s reverence and dharma are weighty; once every forty thousand kalpas enacted, to descend and save beings. Secrets, if truly revealed, descend; if leaked, calamity arrives. Now I announce this clearly—know it well.” The Most High Dao Sovereign rejoiced and sighed with delight, standing facing north to receive the command.

The Heavenly Worthy summoned the Nine Radiances of the Supreme Truth, the flying celestials of the Ten Directions, and the jade attendants of the scripture. Donning the jade essence of the Nine Radiances, he produced golden scripts, purple characters, jade texts, and cinnabar seals—the three divisions, eight scenes, twenty-four diagrams—magnificently displayed on a white jade altar floating in the void. A nine-colored kerchief, cloud essence tied into flying embroidered canopies, hung suspended above the scripture. Great saints of the heavens, Limitless Heavenly Worthies, flying celestial kings, and the three heavens’ perfected beings all simultaneously supervised and pledged their oaths. Incense was burned, flowers scattered, numinous chapters chanted, circling the palace city three times, all following the ancient rites with reverent and natural majesty, entrusted to the Dao Sovereign. The ritual roughly completed, the three scenes returned to their places, and all truths withdrew. At that moment, the Red Radiance shone at midheaven; whether male or female, none failed to model virtue, return their hearts in faith, and all attained salvation in the world.

In the first year of the Supreme Sovereign, on the second day of the ninth month, the later sage Lord Li journeyed to the Western River, touring the Eight Gates. There he encountered the Primordial Heavenly King riding the Eight Scene jade chariot, drawn by a nine-colored mysterious dragon, three pure flying clouds guiding the assembly of immortals, holding a splendid banner, lion and white crane accompanying, singing and howling harmoniously, floating through the air to meet above the Western River. Lord Li bowed and requested to ask the Heavenly King: “In the past, I was instructed and given the celestial book with jade characters of the twenty-four diagrams. Though I have obtained the text, I have yet to fathom the wondrous chapters; though there are diagrammatic praises, there is no image. Cultivating in seclusion, the subtle principles are difficult to explain. Now meeting the Heavenly Worthy, my joy is beyond words. I humbly request your grace to perfect and fulfill the utmost Dao truth.”

Then the Heavenly King breathed forth the Cavern Mystery’s inner observation jade talisman, bestowing it upon Lord Li, instructing him to purify for one thousand days, to incense the five fragrances upon his body, facing east to wear the talisman. The forms and spirits of the child appeared clearly; naturally, understanding would arise, and all doubts would vanish. Lord Li bowed, accepting the teaching, fully following the heavenly rites, fasting for one thousand days, facing east to wear the talisman. The three and eight scene spirits appeared within his body. Golden scripts, jade characters, and the twenty-four diagrams shone brightly in the void, their text and colors radiant and clear, penetrating endlessly, their strands natural. At that time, he was commanded to summon the chief immortal of the diagram to paint the images. Golden scripts, purple characters, jade texts, and cinnabar seals formed the sound here. From the Southern Pole Supreme Radiance Queen, the East and West Flowers, the Southern and Northern True Lords, the Five Mountain Immortals, and the Pure Void Perfected—all received the true texts, and these were the images written by the later sage, each linked accordingly.

Kṣitigarbha Bodhisattva issued and poured forth, golden jade dew formed bodies, white bones generated energy, decayed corpses returned to humans, dragons and qilin leaped, birds and beasts flew joyfully, the Three Realms long in happiness, humans and spirits rejoicing.

That day was a great celebration, kalpas renewed.

In the great cycle, they shall collect the texts and return to the Great Net Seven Treasure Mysterious Terrace Purple Tenuity Palace.

Now the three caverns govern the fate, *Lingbao* descends teaching, first saving and ascending immortal officials’ vacancies, requiring worthy ones to fill the heavens, certain emperors, perfected beings, certain mountain lords.

Without spiritual response, forty thousand kalpas forbid proclamation. Violating oaths and breaking trust, leaking numinous texts, birth and death parents, long closed in the dark night, body perishes in the five paths, wind knives for ten thousand kalpas, dare not speak. Following the methods with sincerity, life and death become immortal, all conduct unified, bright true texts.
