## The Most High Profound Numinous Treasure Scripture of Flight through the Three Realms, Penetrating the Subtle, Inner Contemplation, and Marvelous Dao

The True Person of the Supreme Ultimate said:  
The Most High Numinous Treasure that flies through the Three Realms conceals and preserves the highest dao. One who can maintain long fasts and cultivate practice will, within one hundred days, have all illnesses removed; their complexion will shine bright, white hair will turn black again, and fallen teeth will regrow. After two hundred days of practice, marrow fills and bones are replenished; intestines transform into sinews; scars and burns vanish; stiffness and limitations in bending and stretching dissolve; hoarseness, ailments, blindness, and deafness are all healed, enabling clear sight and hearing. After three hundred days, one passes through entrances and exits without obstruction, commands ghosts and spirits, soars through empty space, treads upon floating clouds, roaming freely as one wishes, journeying beyond the distant Kunlun. After three years, one attains the dao and becomes true, roaming and feasting across the Eight Extremes, riding the qilin, with the White Tiger supporting, the Azure Dragon shielding the dust. After five years, one summons and travels the Three Realms, ascending to the rank of immortal king.  
The marvel of this is spoken here; the dao is magnified by human effort. Is it mere persuasion? Truly, the august existence magnifies the dao, but when the dao remains, people vanish. Great indeed is the treasure of the Most High Numinous Treasure!

The True Person of the Supreme Ultimate said:  
The Numinous Treasure Most True Jingyang, Dan Yang, Gan Yang, ascending Heaven with the Jade Talisman, the Most High secret of the Jade Capital Mountain, Golden Pavilion Upper Palace—none but those with immortal appearance, those destined to be immortal kings, immortal lords, or immortal nobles, may receive it. If you encounter it, your fate will be mysteriously united; your name will be inscribed in the Supreme Clarity, bearing credentials to pledge and receive.

The True Person of the Supreme Ultimate said:  
Disciple and master must each first fast for thirty days, then fast facing each other for three days; each must purge all evils, seek the void and numinous, and then there will be response at the appointed time. Only then should one inscribe talismans, wear the amulets, and proceed with the rites.

The True Person of the Supreme Ultimate said:  
Take the refined qi through ingestion and exhalation, preserve the spirit in stillness, bearing the Most True.

The True Person of the Supreme Ultimate said:  
Enter the chamber for three sevens (twenty-one days) to see the true numinous; transformations arise and vanish, shortening or lengthening life; shift the source, block the flow, and take the Jingyang.

The True Person of the Supreme Ultimate said:  
Water refines eight stones to fix the golden essence; boil the sands, soar and chant, swallowing the yin elixir.

The True Person of the Supreme Ultimate said:  
Contemplate the heart, spirit, and dao, preserving immortal wandering; aim for rare traces and thoughts, ingesting the Gan Yang.

The True Person of the Supreme Ultimate said:  
The talisman is vast and misty, gazing upon the luminous mountain; may one look up to the clouds and contemplate the heavenly grace; desiring to ascend the cloud void and grasp the ascent to Heaven.

The True Person of the Supreme Ultimate said:  
When the dao is fulfilled, wear the talisman to ascend Mount Hua; ascend the heavenly steps and suddenly submit. Ingest refined qi, exhale and inhale essence, preserve the spirit in stillness, bearing the Most True; enter the chamber for three sevens to see the true numinous.

To cultivate the Numinous Treasure flight through the Three Realms, one must practice the gates. Always from the first to the fifteenth day of the month, enter the fasting hall and quietly contemplate; make the ten fingers into gates; primordial qi flows directly to the ten fingers, all warm; the soul exits from within, guiding and returning; stop after ninety breaths.

Then swallow, thrice five times, and finish.

The True Person of the Supreme Ultimate said:  
The Most High Numinous Treasure conceals wandering flight through the Three Realms’ highest dao. Without truth, none can seek it; without dao, none can learn it. If one refines diligently for five years, one can transcend and roam the Three Realms, ascend the Jade Capital; this is the utmost marvel of the Three Caves; the dao that crowns all scriptures. Those who cultivate it should keep their hearts detached and free from all external burdens. If not so, even accumulating years will yield no gain; only wasting heavenly years in wandering sights—how sorrowful indeed!

The True Person of the Supreme Ultimate said:  
When transmitting the pledge and trust, as in the five old methods, the jade secret essentials are given. But separately carry three taels of superior gold, and the life-pattern brocade according to the year’s measure. If you can diligently learn, you will become a guest of the Most High, roaming the Golden Pavilion, ranked among high immortals. Can one not strive? Can one not be diligent?

The True Person of the Supreme Ultimate said:  
If one violates the pledge and recklessly transmits, or transmits without regard to the years and limits, or transmits without pledge and acts recklessly, the guilt reaches the seven ancestors chained in Meng Mountain’s stone, filling the night river; ten thousand kalpas unreversed; one’s own body perishes; how can immortality be expected? Be cautious and clear!
