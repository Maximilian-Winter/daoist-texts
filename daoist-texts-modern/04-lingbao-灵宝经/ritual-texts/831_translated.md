## The Supreme Numinous Treasure Chapter on the Spirit Herbs

Secretly I hold that the art of extending life originally stems from ingesting elixirs to attain longevity. The *Grand Treasure Secret Manuscript* states: "Immortals command spirits." Thus, Guangchengzi dwelled atop Mount Kongtong, revealing the dao of governance and bestowing it upon Xuanyuan. Chisongzi ascended to the Kunlun Palace, consumed the water jade, and taught the Flame Emperor. Following the wind and rain, rising and falling, they scrutinized auspicious signs, journeyed through famed mountains, observed plants and trees, and elucidated the hidden and obscure. The spirit herb, also called the essence form, manifests in myriad varieties, truly difficult to distinguish. Therefore, illustrations and records are drawn, descriptions affixed and transmitted, inviting seekers to search and obtain the path to immortality.
