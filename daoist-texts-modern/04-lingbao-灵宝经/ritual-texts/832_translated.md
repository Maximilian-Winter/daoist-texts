## Scripture of the Primordial Heavenly Venerable on the Marvelous Scripture of Transformation through the Profound Cavern

The Primordial Heavenly Venerable took his seat upon the floating summit of Mount Yucha in the Western Na Heaven, the crimson peak of Fuluo, the cinnabar recess of mystery. Beneath the seven-jewel jade forest and towering trees, he sat adorned with a nine-colored silk cape, a robe and kerchief woven of flying forest threads, a crown of a hundred transformations in an instant, and a sword that nurtured the morning light and the sun’s bell of extension. Around him were five thousand myriad spirits of the high perfected ones attending his seat.

At that moment, he commanded the Five Elders, the Supreme True Ones, and the Left Duke of the Immortal Capital to unfold jade-frosted seven-colored purple treasure phoenix-feather cases, revealing five volumes of scarlet script with authentic characters, chanting the *Upper Scripture of Transformation through the Profound Cavern*. The jade tones surged in four bursts, the wondrous echoes arrayed in eight formations. The wind stirred vermilion and white banners, summoning a grand assembly of myriad gods. The mysterious patterns flowed elegantly, adorned by the purple void’s embellishments. The Most High Sage rejoiced, scattering jade radiance universally. The heavens leapt with joy, all realms opening bright.

Fragrant blossoms and music without measure filled the air. Celebratory smoke gathered in eight assemblies, golden winds swept in four clearings. Three lights paused their brilliance, seven spirits shone with dazzling clarity. Eight paths gleamed resplendently, the profound observation knew no bounds. The clear, resonant calls rose to the upper capital, divine grace reaching far and wide. The condensed truth overflowed within, releasing the spirit to journey alone. The vital energies soared lightly to the heavens, the body extended through the five images.

Dragon patterns shone upon the azure ferry, colors radiated among the lofty clouds. The essence danced in the orchid grove, feasting beneath flying canopies of the eight scenes. Dragons reined at the pure ridges, phoenix carriages soared with lofty gazes. They crouched in the cavern to scatter clouds, sped the cinnabar chariot to race freely. Treading the nine mists to fix their gaze eternally, they soared beyond the three heavens to dissolve thought. Whirling long smoke floated as shade, spreading sun brilliance to brush the bright decree. The sun emitted majesty, lightning bolts raced to stir thunderous echoes. Bells intertwined in radiant flashes, four extremes veiled in wildness.

At leisure in profound awakening, they beheld the great image of transformation, washing in orchid ponds, cleansing the sullied blue waves. Refining the soul in the jade waves, they gathered at the Daoist assembly. Golden spirits shimmered and fell, the six perfections subdued (wandering). Principle and transformation reached the nine extremes, harmonizing vital energy eternally. Nourishing joy within, kindness spreading without. The cavernous numinousness molded fate, containing truth and issuing proclamations. Looking up and down the profound cavern, transformation reigned supreme. The Most High Dao and Virtue universally crowned the divine lineage. Lofty and grand was the great pattern, revered by all heavens.

The wondrous truth now shone forth, myriad vital energies converged. Dark perception and mysterious communication, great stillness and profound subtlety. The principle was wondrously contained and flowing, deep and clear with purple radiance. Surging waves of the hidden void, holding the supreme moment. Vastly descending into the nine darknesses, the sun’s gate opened wide. Wings folded in the upper pavilion, spiritual transformation balanced the two polarities. Gems and jade stirred the sounds, myriad echoes mourned themselves. Phoenixes sang in the orchid garden, phoenix cries rose on cloud ladders. Horses startled the abandoned homes, dragons raced the mysterious rivers. Seven primal breaths ceased, three lights paused their turning. The immortal sovereign extended reins, the primordial lord opened the gate.

The upper realm was not yet complete; below it bestowed the four utmost. In a fleeting instant, suddenly the nine enclosures expanded. The dark assembly met the eight surges, entering the profound subtlety. The Great Emperor upheld the wheel, the Five Elders held the banner. Golden tigers led the charge, heavenly steeds pursued behind. Fierce horses bared their throats, venomous beasts spat majesty. Heavenly soldiers seized evil, the scarlet script captured the wrong. Heavenly demons lost their vital energy, myriad essences were destroyed. Jade truth inspected and admonished, no great or small escaped. The three heavens’ true dao, six vital energies galloped. Dark grace washed away filth, cleansing the cold pools. Daoist temples shone anew, spiritual transformation circled nine times. The Great Abundance had four passages, the five domains leveled evenly. The whirlwind released unimpeded, fitting the heart’s endeavor.

Vast and boundless was the Great Beginning, distant and pure. The august current responded to the turning, myriad truths spontaneously born. Dense and flourishing, dragon trunks spread glory, myriad kinds scattered like wild blossoms. Vermilion light stirred the jade, soaring wings pierced the purple firmament. Soaring feathers brushed the jade clarity, two images shone lightly, eight paths gleamed brightly. The Moon Maiden warmed the brilliance, the Sun Boy raised the essence. Flowing to irrigate the heavens, gathering the eight darknesses. A hundred harmonies scattered fragrance, fragrant winds wildly displayed. Dim and clear was the spirit, flying wheels with azure feathers. Radiance dazzling and brilliant, scattering over seven cities. Golden youths held kerchiefs, purple concubines cradled infants. Irrigating the jade firmament, scattering blossoms in the vermilion court. Towering trees drummed branches, round images blossomed finely, myriad existences opened wide, sounds echoed in the empty blue.

Mournful tones issued forth, phoenix songs also rang. Subtle and constant was the rhythm, phoenix chants merged as one. Celebratory smoke intertwined and vanished, vermilion fire and golden bells. Vital energy accepted no veil, the scene cleared and naturally sprouted. Lofty and graceful in the upper void, one could forget all feelings. High pouring of the lower vital energy, spreading spirit on distant journeys. Compassion for the world, mourning the vulgar, bowing to harmonize all life.

Therefore, on the Jade Isle, the Yellow Register’s slips were carved: the Emperor inscribed the name of Great Abundance, the Great Desert inscribed the vital energy of the Jade Mansion, the Boundless inscribed the age of the vast kalpa. Those who can gather rigor in transformation prolong health without decline; those who refine in the profound cavern find myriad gods naturally at peace. Bowing to chant the cavernous chapter, myriad ghosts take no form. Marvelous indeed is the numinous might, solemn and vast in its stillness, lofty and grand the lineage of virtue, the utmost spirit of the Most High Sage.

Thus, he commanded the Five Elders, Supreme True Ones, and Left Immortal of the Capital to reveal the essentials of the eight paths of transformation through the profound cavern, to show those who come in future ages to cultivate and study, so that they may refine the subtle and ascend to immortality.

### The Eight Seasonal Assemblies of the Celestial Court

**Day of the Beginning of Spring, at midday:**  
The high perfected ones and great gods gathered all immortals at the Supreme Palace of the Great Ultimate. They fixed the jade slips, golden tablets, and purple scripts, recording the names of those who have attained immortality, inscribing them in the mysterious register, arranging characters in the directions. On that day, the Heavenly, Earthly, and Water Officials of Heaven, the Five Mountains’ true spirits, and the great gods of the Four Seas all rode in jade chariots of the eight scenes, five-colored cloud carriages, and were escorted by vermilion phoenixes; some rode flying dragons. Immortal youths and jade maidens, numbering ten billion, held banners and pennants, scattered blossoms and burned incense, floating through the air, illuminating the heavens, traversing the eight directions. Each held the register of immortal studies, reviewing the Supreme Palace, cross-checking merits and faults, correcting records of good and evil.

They were presented by the Three Officials and protected by the Five Emperors, their names inscribed on jade slips, carved and recorded in the Supreme Palace, and announced to myriad spirits. Those who violate prohibitions have their offenses recorded in the nine courts, their punishments witnessed by the Three Officials, executed by the Four Bureaus, corrected by the Five Emperors, all erased from the registers, transferred to the ghost officials, where good and evil are judged. After three days of assembly, the heavens, sun, moon, stars, and all earthly spirits were solemn and reverent.

Those who study should on this day bathe and fast, enter their chambers at midday, expose their bodies at midnight, face north, bow twice, knock their heads and strike their cheeks nine times, confessing all hidden offenses and grievous faults since beginning their study of the true dao, asking forgiveness for unforgivable crimes, with a sincere heart empty and profound, inside and out without concealment, begging for explanation and release, drawing out the seven mysteries, their hidden souls ascending, their bodies flying as immortals. When finished, they click their teeth nine times and softly chant:

> Northern Mystery High Perfected, Great Immortal of the Great Ultimate,  
> Mysterious Void ten thousandfold, Numinous Transformations a thousandfold,  
> Auspicious day and good hour, assembly at the high dawn,  
> Three lights merge in darkness, eight vital energies spread,  
> Four bureaus open to inspect, Five Emperors confirm immortality,  
> Begging to remove past offenses, erase the root of sin,  
> Inscribe the name in the Nine Heavens, carve in the numinous pavilion,  
> Unfold the seven ancestors, gaze upward to receive mysterious grace,  
> Ten thousand wishes carved and assembled, none unmet as spoken.

Then they wear the talisman of the Great Ultimate’s refining transformation and true spiritual birth, swallow it facing upward, and cease the nine knocks. If one practices this dao for eight years, their jade name will be inscribed in the Supreme View of the Great Ultimate, becoming one of the immortals of the Great Ultimate, their destined body able to fly and ascend to the Supreme Clarity.

On this day, the Heavenly, Earthly, and Water Officials, the Five Mountains, Four True Ones, and great gods of the immortals all came, riding cloud carriages, feathered canopies, and twelve flying dragons. Immortal youths and jade maidens scattered blossoms and burned incense, holding floral banners, floating in the air, surveying the eight directions, ascending the Jade Terrace, recording the weight of practitioners’ scriptures and deeds, selecting and awarding the Supreme True Ones.

After three days of assembly, the heavens, sun, moon, stars, and all earthly spirits were solemn and reverent.

They also beg to be freed from the punishments of the seven ancestors, to draw out the hidden souls, leave the three paths and five sufferings, exhaust the souls and ascend, their bodies attaining immortality. When finished, they click their teeth nine times and softly chant:

> Great Elemental Supreme True, High Immortal Great Spirit,  
> Today reporting above, auspicious clouds circle the carriage,  
> Banquet in the Jade Court, gathering in the Purple Court,  
> Registers and books inspected, sins recorded and lives carved,  
> Five Emperors confirm the record, East Flower records the name,  
> Dao accords with supreme wishes, I present the wondrous scripture,  
> Ten thousand times awaiting the journey, hoping for divine spirit,  
> Jade Emperor opens pardon, all matters confirmed,  
> Transforming scenes and changing bones, ascending to Supreme Clarity.

Then they wear the talisman of the Great Elemental Jade Terrace’s true transformation immortal treasure, swallow it facing upward, and cease the nine knocks. If one practices this dao for eight years, the Great Elemental True Man will descend to their chamber, revealing divine form, enabling ascent and flight to the Jade Terrace’s Supreme Palace.

The Five Emperors gathered immortals at the Purple Tenuity Palace, listing the Four True Ones of the Great Ultimate, reviewing the registers of merits and faults in the study of the dao. On this day, the heavenly officials, river and sea water emperors, and the five mountain spirits all rode cloud carriages, feathered canopies, flying dragons, and vermilion phoenixes. Immortal youths and jade maidens burned incense and scattered blossoms, floating through the air, holding floral banners, five-colored flowing bells, arriving in solemn assembly. They ascended the Purple Tenuity Palace, listing practitioners’ merits and faults, reviewing and recording the registers. After three days of assembly, good and evil were distinguished.

The seven mysteries examine the souls, drawing them out from the three paths and five hardships, leaving the dark servitude, ascending to the blessed hall, praying for the gods and immortals to grant flight to Supreme Clarity. When finished, they click their teeth nine times and softly bless:

> Five vital energies return spirit, total truth and clear purity,

The eight seasonal assemblies are the celestial court’s great celebrations of true revelation. At these times, myriad gods gather, great saints of the heavens, heavenly true great gods, wondrous daoist true men, and the sun, moon, stars, five mountains, five emperors, river and sea gods, and countless multitudes all assemble simultaneously, for three days of grand celebration. They reckon the heavenly true ones, distinguish good and evil, record merits and faults, separate diligence and negligence, all listed in the Nine Heavens, each accompanied by the Three Palaces and Nine Courts, Official of Fate, upper bureau, large and small, light and heavy, all fully recorded.

Practitioners on these days fast, first confessing offenses, burning incense and reciting scriptures, earnestly reciting spells and precepts, invoking divine spirits. The Four Bureaus assist, the Five Emperors support, recommending and recording all in the jade registers. Those who obtain this do not know the great celebration days of the heavens, nor the assembly times of the Most High Sage, nor the method of first confessing offenses. How then can past judgments be resolved, how can sin names be removed? Without this, the seven ancestors long remain in hell; how can one hope to fly as an immortal? The two divisions of spring and autumn are the heavenly origin’s judgment of life and death, the day of testing myriad immortals in the true view. On that day, one must not be discouraged or confused, but focus and meditate deeply, live long in the dao, avoid wrongdoing. One must not lightly practice, but first confess offenses. Once vows are set, the heavenly origin carves the slips; if one never offends, the upper immortality is assured. If one offends again, the officials punish, and the heavenly origin no longer accepts their confession. The immortal path is distant; the body becomes a lower ghost, the clear display of sin and merit. This single day is the key; practitioners should be cautious.

Those who cultivate the upper dao, think spirit and preserve truth, enter the profound cavern of transformation, observe the four seasons’ forms and scenes, seek the essentials of flying immortality, yet do not know to repent and confess on the eight seasonal days, recite wishes and spells, remove sins and fix life with true methods, the divine truth is distant and invisible, the mind hopes for response, but it is difficult to expect. On these days of repentance and confession, no sin remains unscattered, no spirit fails to protect. The words of spells and incantations, once uttered, bring response. Thus, thinking spirit, within ten years one will see true gods; the seven ancestors will be freed from the three paths and hidden souls, transform and receive transformation in the Southern Immortal realm, the body will be free and soar, relying on the empty heavens to roam and fly.

This is the Primordial Supreme Dao, secreted in the palace of Great Abundance above the Nine Heavens, following the bright true regulations and ranks, transmitted once in myriad kalpas, lightly revealing the numinous script, avoiding calamity to the seven mysteries, the body without hope for immortality.

These eight numinous true paths of transformation through the profound cavern jade scene hidden talismans come from the jade chapters of the Most High, serving to assist the divine scriptures. They should be inscribed on colored silk ribbons and worn on the body for eight years. Those who persevere will have their true men remove their censures and surely attain the upper immortality. Those who cultivate the dao and preserve thought, hoping for flight and soaring, dispersing sin records and inscribing names on golden slips, should all wear talismans and act accordingly. For the years of the Grand Duke, one’s birth sign, the sixty-year cycle, and the year of the Metal Monkey, all should wear talismans according to the season, not necessarily on the exact festival days.

Those who do not obtain these texts cannot resolve their sin names, cannot remove the divine truth, and are far from immortality. Those who obtain them ascend to Heaven in broad daylight—this is truly transformation through the profound cavern.
